Mill?n 1981:230; 1993). Set in a highland valley near the northern frontier of Mesoamerica, evidence of Teotihuacan's presence is found 700 km farther north and 1200 km to the south into regions where different languages were spoken and very different cultures flourished (fig. 1).2 Because these distant cultures were themselves distinctive, the intrusive nature of Teotihuacan's goods and ideas is obvious today. And we wonder why they were there. Art historians are particularly sensitive to stylistic differences and anthropologists to cultural differences. Both tend to polarize the contrasting traits they observe and Teotihuacan offers oppositional sets at every level when compared to other parts of Mesoamerica. Consider the total planning and calculated construction of the vast city; its teeming, tethered population; its urban architecture, facade sculptures, and countless paintings. Yet Teotihuacan was clearly as much a part of the Mesoamerica culturally defined by Raul Kirchoff (1981) as were the Maya, Veracruz, Oaxacan, and later Mixtee and Aztec cultures. Like these other cultures, the people of Teotihuacan built stepped, pyramidal structures with temples, dedicated human sacrifices, played a ball game, sustained warriors, and were regulated by combined solar and ritual calendars. Evidence for some of these defining characteristics at Teotihuacan is indirect and equivocal, and has led to setting it in a retrospective cultural isolation. For more than twenty years some scholars have considered it methodologically unsound to use Aztec analogy to explain Teotihuacan and, as a consequence, there has been no recent systematic attempt to prove or disprove the presence of a dominant Nahua-speaking culture at the great city.3 Thus Teotihuacan remains supremely important, but remote, and even mute (Pasztory 1992:302). The compact highland city versus dispersed lowland settlement, corporate versus individualistic rule, cyclic versus more linear historic time, and illiterate versus literate elite: these are a few of the powerful contrasts made between Teotihuacan and other Mesoamerican cultures to the south, especially the Maya. In such comparisons the forced dichotomies tend to suggest anonymous and uneducated leaders at Teotihuacan who ruled the faceless masses within endless cycles of agricultural events. But it is the last of these contrasts, illiterate/literate, which is most unjustifiably dismissive of Teotihuacan culture and effectively allows mystery to prevail about what language was actually spoken there.4 Teotihuacan was an oral/aural culture. Knowledge was passed face-to-face; you could not look it up (Goody 1968:28; Stock 1983:14-15). The memory of the elders provided continuity, as did the singing of hymns and the telling of myth, perpetuated in the linked repetition of ritual. Much of the specialized knowledge of the priesthood would have concerned the Creation, Teotihuacan's role in it, and probably also the birth/emergence of the Teotihuacan people from a cave. It may be such a cultural creation narrative that is sung 1. I wish to express my appreciation for the constructive criticisms of George Cowgill, Saburo Sugiyama, and two anonymous reviewers. 2. To the north, at the site of Alta Vista, Chalchihuites, located at the Tropic of Cancer (23?27' north latitude), there is evidence that Teotihuacan astronomers were measuring the single zenith sun on the summer solstice at this end point of the sun's northern trajectory in the northern hemisphere (Aveni et al. 1982); whereas far to the south, at Copan, Honduras, the true eastern frontier of Mesoamerica, the calendar was observationally defined by the dates of the two zenith passages of the sun?the same dates that were chosen to determine the orientation of Teotihuacan, even though they had no observational zenith passage significance at Teotihuacan (Coggins 1993). 3. Art historian George Kubier objected to the methods of Eduard Seier and Mexican scholars who assumed that Teotihuacan could be explained with Aztec models (1973b, 1984; Willey 1973). Kubier rejected ethnohistoric analogy because, he contended, true cultural continuities are masked by superficial change whereas what appears to be constant has actually lost, or modified, its original meaning, leaving a disjunction between old and new forms. This important criticism has tended to discourage research into continuities that may have existed between Teotihuacan and the Aztec, at least among art historians, as has the unresolved debate about the significance of Tula, the place and the idea (summarized in L. Jones 1995:45-52,417-425). 4. In emphasizing differences between Teotihuacan and other parts of Mesoamerica I do not mean to belittle Teotihuacan. It is rather because of its extraordinary and singular cultural success that I stress its illiteracy, in comparison to the Maya. I believe the city proudly chose to perpetuate its distinctive oral tradition, rejecting the more southern kinds of literacy. This attitude was basically perpetuated by the Aztec. Literacy was also apparently rejected within Maya territory, in the highlands and on the south coast. It is difficult for modern culture to believe that literacy might not be both inevitable and most highly desirable.</page><page sequence="3">18 RES 29/30 SPRING/AUTUMN 1996 Figure 1.

This Teotihuacan mountain with a cave and water, which is repeated in more realistic form on the wall below, may be the origin of the N?huatl word, altepetl (altepetl water-mountain, Karttunen 1983:9), that denoted a city and the king. In the Tepantitla mural the priests flanking the goddess idol are both sowing and uttering flowery precious greenstones?a common combined metaphor for noble speech in N?huatl literature.5 A second, nobler and more esoteric category of priestly knowledge also involved the Creation at Teotihuacan, but at a high level of abstraction. This was the calendric knowledge that was invisibly preserved in the hemisphere's grandest mnemonic device?the city of Teotihuacan itself. The theological character and uses of this numerical system will be discussed below; it is introduced here to identify a sacerdotal specialty in numeracy which coexisted, perhaps unknown to the populace, concurrent with the celebration of the mythic history of the divine Teotihuacan. At Izapa, considered later in this paper, an analogous distinction between the religious mythology of the people and the abstruse numerical theology of a priestly elite may be illustrated on the late carved Stela 25 (fig. 15). In both of these places, evidence of subsequent disruption in religious ritual and of change in the development of the site may imply a struggle against the power of a priesthood and its specialized knowledge. Teotihuacan?city of the gods Planned and built de novo in a broad watered valley northeast of LakeTexcoco in the Basin of Mexico, Teotihuacan grew dramatically from its earliest related settlement of about 150 b.c., until a.D. 150 when it reached its full size of 20 square km with a population of 60,000-80,000?and more than 100,000 by a.D. 300 (Cowgill 1992:91, 96). Teotihuacan was the most populous and the first urban place in the hemisphere. The city's growth entailed a deliberate concentration, probably a conscription, of the regional population, to build it (R. Mill?n 1992:388-390). Such an undertaking 5. Knab and Sullivan 1994:213.

Wall painting, Tepantitla, Teotihuacan. Detail of top section. Drawing: Elizabeth W?hle. implies an extraordinary vision coupled with extraordinary powers of persuasion. Who conceived it? Where did they come from? What language did they speak? A thousand years later, the Aztec state was much bigger, but its capital was packed onto an artificial island in LakeTexcoco, where divine guidance had predicted and prescribed its settlement. For the Aztec, Teotihuacan was where the gods were born, or reborn as celestial bodies; its astounding pyramids, superhuman scale, and metric perfection testified to the divine creation that had occurred there when time began. Mesoamerican creation stories describe a series of creations in which the generative deities fail and start over three or four times. Only one of the remaining colonial accounts explicitly describes the primordial ocean that preceded all creation, although it is probably represented visually on the facade of the Temple of Quetzalcoatl at Teotihuacan. This ocean is described in the Popol Vuh, a Quiche Maya scripture from the highlands of Guatemala: Now it ripples, now it still murmurs, it still sighs, still hums, and it is empty under the sky. Here follow the first words, the first eloquence: There is not yet one person, one animal, bird, fish, crab tree, rock, hollow, canyon, meadow, forest. Only the sky alone is there: the face of the earth is not clear. Only the sea alone is pooled under the sky; there is nothing whatever gathered together. It is at rest; not a single thing stirs. It is held back, kept at rest under the sky. Whatever there is that might be is simply not there: only the pooled water, only the calm sea, only it alone is pooled. Whatever might be is simply not there: only murmurs, ripples, in the dark, in the night. Only the Maker, Modeler alone, Sovereign Plumed Serpent, the Bearers, the Begetters are in the water, a glittering light. They are there, they are enclosed in quetzal feathers, in blue-green. Thus the name "Plumed Serpent." They are great knowers, great thinkers in their very being. And of course there is the sky, and there is also the Heart of Sky. This is the name of the god, as it is spoken. And then came his word. . . . Let it be this way, think about it: this water should be removed, emptied out for the formation of the earth's own plate and platform, then comes the sowing, the dawning of the sky-earth. . . . And then the earth arose because of them, it was simply their word that brought it forth. For the forming of the earth they said "Earth."6 In their need to understand Aztec culture, the sixteenth-century Spanish friars recorded religious hymns and poetry, like the following description in the 6. Dennis Tedlock, trans., Popol Vuh (1985:72-73). Tedlock's is the most recent translation of the Popol Vuh into English. It is more compact than the Munro Edmonson translation (1971), which uses poetic couplets in a looser, more redundant style that may reproduce the quality of the original oral epic. However, both Tedlock and Edmonson translated from an eighteenth-century copy of the 16th century Quiche Maya version written in the Latin alphabet and supposed to derive from a pre-Hispanic version written in a Maya script (Edmonson 1971: vii-viii)?although there is little evidence that such a script, or any system of true writing, existed (after ca. A.D. 100) in the central and western highlands of Guatemala.</page><page sequence="5">20 RES 29/30 SPRING/AUTUMN 1996 Florentine Codex, which also alludes to the waters that contained the complex primal generative force: Mother of the gods, father of the gods, the old god spread out on the navel of the earth, within the circle of turquoise. He who dwells in the waters the color of the bluebird, he who dwells in the clouds. The old God who inhabits the shadows of the land of the dead, the Lord of fire and of time.7 This Aztec hymn mentions the primordial sea, as at the beginning of the Quiche Popol Vuh, while the many creation accounts from towns around LakeTexcoco told of the later sequence of creations, as an introduction to stories about the gods and men and their own specific migration, settlement, and rulership histories (Le?n Portilla 1963:28-61). The Popol Vuh creation story (which also involved subsequent creations) served, in the same way, as the foundation for the history of the Quiche people. In the Aztec accounts, Teotihuacan (a real place) is where the fifth Sun (or current creation) began. However, the story began there during the preceding fourth Sun. The fifth Sun was named 4-Water after the name of the day and the manner in which it would destruct, and indeed it was destroyed by rain and floods?"thus life ceased, and the heavens no longer were, for they had fallen to earth."8 The waters lasted 52 years (a complete calendar cycle) thus effectively separating the next Sun (or age) from previous time. At Teotihuacan, at midnight of that last day, a god was deputized to leap into an enormous fire, the "divine hearth," but he lost his nerve and another, humbler, deity immolated himself instead and became the Sun. (Le?n-Portilla 1963:43-44). This account, and its variations, explained the spectacular, sacramental events that occurred at the completion of every period of 52 years in central Mexico. All fires were extinguished, in emulation of the blackness at the end of the fourth Sun, leaving the world in darkness and in terror that time had stopped and the sun would never rise again. A human sacrifice was made at midnight, in a reenactment of the immolation of the god, and fire was drilled in order to insure the return of the sun and the resumption of time. The various N?huatl narratives of the "Suns" place the creation of the divine sun, and thus the beginning of days (time), specifically at Teotihuacan, while the Quiche Maya creation story similarly refers, in later parts, to its own local mountains and to local dynastic history. These variants share reference to the primordial waters and to a blue-feathered compound deity that dwells in them.9 A second important trait shared by these accounts from two different regions and languages is that in their historic sections both celebrate the city of Tula as the source of their cultural/dynastic history.10 Thinking the city The act of creation involved knowing and thinking in the Quiche account quoted above. The unitary deity (including the Plumed Serpent) "enclosed in quetzal feathers, in blue-green," thought and talked about it, then simply uttered the word "earth," and eventually ... the Maker, Modeler, mother-father of life [proceeded] to complete the emergence of all the sky-earth: the four-fold siding, four-fold cornering, measuring, four-fold staking, halving the cord, stretching the cord in the sky, on the earth, the four sides, the four corners.11 The gods create the world in its four, directional divisions as it is always described and understood in Mesoamerica. Their imposition of geometric form is the distillation of divine thought?although this order is never evident in the amorphous shapes of the natural world. Such a divine four-fold staking and measuring with the cord created the geometrically ordered Teotihuacan, which was itself a model of the "sky 7. Le?n-Portilla (1963:32-33), from the Florentine Codex, compiled by the friar Bernardino de Sahagun. The Aztec name for this old god, the Lord of fire and of time, was Xiuhtecuhtli (fire/year lord). Observance of George Kubler's principle of disjunction, which postulates a lack of symbolic continuity between Teotihuacan and the Aztec (footnote 2), requires avoiding Aztec deity names like Xiuhtecuhtli, Tlaloc, and Quetzalcoatl. The "Old God of Fire and Time," the "Storm God" and the "Plumed Serpent" are more neutral, methodologically correct, and mostly used here. 8. Le?n-Portilla (1963:43) translates this creation account from Historia de los Mexicanos por sus Pinturas. 9. In the N?huatl Florentine Codex quoted above (note 5), not in the historic annals. 10. In the Quiche Popol Vuh, the current fourth Creation deals with first sunrise and migration from "Tula" (Edmonson 1971:5059-5263; Tedlock 1985:171-176), while in the historic Aztec Anales de Cuauhtitlan the current fifth Sun was "when the Toltecs began . . . earth and sky were established . . . light came, and it dawned." (Bierhorst 1992:25-26); subsequent chapters detail the history of Tula and Quetzalcoatl as prefatory to the genealogy of Aztec Cuauhtitlan. 11. Tedlock (1985:72). Dennis Tedlock's Quiche informant explained that these phrases describe the measuring of land. Tedlock notes similar references to measurement by the gods in the Yucatec Maya Chilam Balam of Chumayel, where footsteps measure space and days measure time (1985:243).</page><page sequence="6">Coggins: Creation religion and the numbers at Teotihuacan and Izapa 21 earth."12 Not only was Teotihuacan laid out in a measured rectilinear grid, but the pattern was oriented to the movement of the sun, which was born there. This orientation to the sun was esoteric because the focal horizon point had no local observational importance before it was chosen to regulate the calendar (or the daily count) of Teotihuacan?and the vast Pyramid of the Sun was oriented toward it.13 The days were counted beginning with the second of two sets of days (April 28-29, August 11-12) when sunset occurred at this point on the horizon as viewed from the Pyramid of the Sun; the 365-day year was organized by a combination of solar events and numbered groups of days of numerological significance. Beginning August 13 there were 260 days until April 29, then 52 days until the day before summer solstice, summer solstice, and another 52 days until August 12.u Thus the year was divided into sacred number bundles of days, which allowed for the accurate prediction, by counting, of each major solar event.15 Except for counting purposes, these two orientation days had no obvious celestial significance at Teotihuacan, so it is evident the system must have been invented at the latitude where important solar events did occur on the critical April 28-29 and August 11-12. These were the dates of the two solar zeniths far to the south, at the latitude of Copan and Izapa (see map, fig. 1).16The second of the two dates, August 11-12, was more important because it also marked the last day of the previous age (the fourth Sun) at Teotihuacan. In the south, where these dates do correspond to the zeniths, August 11, was the Calendar Round day 4 Ahaw 8 Cumku and the final day of the previous Maya Long Count period (or age) of 13 baktuns which ended in the year 3114 b.c. The next day (5 Imix 9 Cumku) marked the beginning of the new calendar and of the fifth Sun at Teotihuacan. The Calendar Round is the only calendar count known to have been used, from the beginning, everywhere in Mesoamerica.17 This recondite solar and calendric information explains the orientation and layout of the sacred city, implies the day on which the calendar began, and indicates that theTeotihuacanos were using a numerologically significant division of the year that had been adopted from a latitude far to the south, where it had observational significance, and was thus its likely place of origin. In the first century of our era at Teotihuacan the earliest Pyramid of the Moon was built at the northern end of the great axial Street of the Dead, followed by the earliest large Pyramid of the Sun on the east side (fig. 3) (R. Mill?n 1992:388-393). The huge Pyramid of the Sun faced the determining western, or sunset, point on the horizon and a lava tube/tunnel beneath the pyramid that opened out in this direction was probably another determining factor in the orientation (ibid.). Seen as a cave, this tunnel may have denoted the cave of origin of the founders of Teotihuacan; such a cave of origin figured in later Aztec myth and imagery (Heyden 1981). Late in the second century A.D., after several enlargements of these pyramids, a completely different kind of construction was built directly south of the Pyramid of the Sun, and south of the R?o San Juan, which had at this time been channelized to cross the Street of the Dead on a perpendicular east-west course. This new structure was a vast square enclosure, 400 m on a side, with "walls" measuring 70 m wide to support 15 "temples" spaced around the top of the four sides; 12. Unlike most Mesoamerican art, Teotihuacan imagery has no sky register?no indication of a sky that is the abode of the gods or ancestors. This, I suggest, is because Teotihuacan was the "sky-earth"; the ambient air?or the level of human life in most Mesoamerican monumental art?is the sky at Teotihuacan. 13. The Pyramid of the Sun faces directly toward the azimuth 285?25'; this western orientation determines the overall orientation of Teotihuacan at 15?25' east of true north. 14. The Mesoamerican Calendar Round comprises two concurrent counts of days: a solar, agricultural count of 365 days, and an esoteric, astrological count of 260 days. It takes 52 years before a particular day, doubly named in the two cycles, recurs (365 x 52 = 18,980 days = 260 x 73), and the numbers 260 and 52 are of great symbolic importance. 15. David Drucker (1977) has summarized the literature on the orientation of Teotihuacan and worked out the possible significance and uses of various orientations relative to the history of Teotihuacan itself (see also Mill?n 1992:387-388). 16. At the Tropic of Cancer (23?27' north latitude) the sun is at the zenith at noon only on the summer solstice, June 20-21. To the south, at Copan (14?50' north latitude) the sun passes directly overhead on April 28-29 and returns south to pass directly over Copan again on August 11-12; the April and August zenith passage days are evenly spaced around the summer solstice. At Teotihuacan (19?4V north latitude), between the Tropic of Cancer and Copan, the zenith dates May 17-18 and July 25-26 are closer to summer solstice than at Copan. (The pairs of days reflect the fact that the solar year is actually 365.25 days long and the solar event may occur on one day or the other.) 17. There has always been disagreement about the unbroken continuity of the Mesoamerican two-part calendar; I follow Alfonso Caso (1967:63-64), Munro Edmonson (1988, chap. 1), and David Drucker (1987) in accepting its unchanging character. Any differences between calendars are found only in those aspects of the solar count that reflect local seasonal and probably politico/religious choice, like when to begin and end the year, not in the actual count of the days. This position entails recognizing the Mesoamerican sanctification of the numbers and their counts over observed solar phenomena, since it requires ignoring leap year, or the variance of the actual year from 365 days.</page><page sequence="7">22 RES 29/30 SPRING/AUTUMN 1996 Cerro Gordo Pyramid ^ of the _ Pyramid Moon ~ of the_: --fi^-~:'T?

David Drucker has shown how the Ciudadela, with its 15 circumferential temples, might have been used for the computation of various concurrent Mesoamerican calendric counts?the ritual cycle, the solar cycle, and the Venus cycle (1974). The Ciudadela was an architectural and perhaps a sacramental innovation for which the river was diverted to conform to the site's orientation; moreover, its construction may signal a change in ideology and politics at Teotihuacan and a new focus for the site (Cowgill 1992:105-107). The internal focus of the enclosing Ciudadela was the pyramidal substructure known as the Temple of Quetzalcoatl (Feathered Serpent Pyramid) (fig. 4). Excavators in this century have found 120 associated sacrificial burials; these, when not solitary, were organized in pits in groups of 4, 8, 9, 18, and 20?all numerologically significant numbers in Mesoamerican calendrics?that might total the supreme number 260 if the entire pyramid were excavated (Cabrera 1993:106).18 These potent and magical numerical sets 18. This mass sacrifice at Teotihuacan may possibly be recalled in</page><page sequence="8">Coggins: Creation religion and the numbers at Teotihuacan and Izapa 23 were, of course, invisible, but they served to sacralize the construction of this pyramid, which was completely decorated with an unknown number of identical sculptured supernatural creatures.19 In addition to his excavations at the Temple of Quetzalcoatl, Saburo Sugiyama made measurements throughout the center of the site and identified a reasonably consistent ancient measure of 83 cm, which he termed theTMU (Teotihuacan Measurement Unit) (1993:112-113). He found that this measure had been multiplied by well-known Mesoamerican sacred numbers (of days)?52 (years in the combined ritual and solar cycle), 73 (ritual cycles in 52 years), 260 (days in a ritual cycle), 584 (days in a Venus cycle), and 819 (a cycle of days otherwise known only in much later Maya, four-directional contexts [Kelley 1976:57-59])? to determine the dimensions and layout of the city. These measurements, like the orientation, constitute another demonstration of Teotihuacan knowledge of the calendar and, as in the orientation itself and in the burials, these priestly counts were ineffable and invisible. The temple of Quetzalcoatl When completed near a.D. 200, the Temple of Quetzalcoatl was decorated with carved stone taludes and tableros (fig. 4). The talud-tablero architectural motif was symbolic of the city of Teotihuacan itself (Kubler 1973a; Gendrop 1984); wherever the talud tablero decorated a structure after a.D. 250, it is evidence of Teotihuacan contact, usually even settlement. Structurally, the talud-tablero is as arbitrary as the imposed grid plan of Teotihuacan itself (fig. 5). The unstable rectangular tablero is precariously cantilevered to project outward horizontally from the sloping talud of the pyramidal structure behind it (Acosta 1964:21-22). This geometric effect is enhanced by a rectilinear frame that is frequently (as on the Temple of Quetzalcoatl) decorated on all four faces with chalchihuite (fig. 6). These are green-painted, perforated disks that signify precious greenstone (jade) and preciousness in general. Hasso Von Winning believes they signify water at Teotihuacan (1987:2:11). They also resemble the circular signs that denote the count of individual days (each denoting "one"). Recent excavations have confirmed that the pyramid had seven tiers of talud-tableros, with a single monumental stairway on the west (Cabrera and Sugiyama 1982:1 79), while the two side walls of the stairway balustrades were once painted with conch shells (fig. 4).20The sloping stone talud at the base of each level had a single carved, elongated profile of a feathered serpent with its head facing the central stairway, while modeled seashells (conchs and scallops) surrounded the gentle undulations of its body (fig. 6). Within the rectangular frames of the tableros, many short, feathered serpents undulate in a similar seashell environment, their fierce heads projecting directly outward. These have always, with little argument, been identified as Quetzalcoatl (green-feathered serpent in N?huatl and a deity and culture hero). A second frontal head projects outward just before the rattlesnake tail of each short serpent. Compared to the front heads, these are rectangular, covered with square, crocodilian scutes.

When they failed to do their duty they were killed by their siblings, who had been born from the same cave (Bierhorst 1992:149-150). If this much later myth should refer to the spectacular mass sacrifice that dedicated the Temple of Quetzalcoatl, then it might support George Cowgill's hypotheses about the local origin of the victims, and a subsequent radical change in Teotihuacan religion and politics at this time (1992:107). 19. Reconstruction drawings of the Pyramid suggest there may have been about 370 projecting "heads" including headdresses as heads (Cabrera and Sugiyama 1982:179) and possibly more on a temple structure on top. This number is close to 365 or 400, but each short facade serpent had two "heads"?one serpentine, the other a headdress?so a count of whole serpents would be half the number of heads. 20.

Talud-tablero of the Temple of Quetzalcoatl, Teotihuacan. Drawing: Elizabeth W?hle. for years, has recently been explained convincingly by Saburo Sugiyama (1989) and Karl Taube (1992) as representing headdresses, which Taube further identifies as Xiuhcoatl, the fire serpent. Headdresses at Teotihuacan serve as naming devices that declare authority, affiliation, and priestly role while frontal (full face) portrayals are deity images (Kubier 1967:7). Thus, the short, frontal serpents would represent the divine Quetzalcoatl with a Xiuhcoatl headdress. The difference between the feathered sea serpents on the talud and the tablero is that the former are solitary, in profile, and without headdresses. The frontal tablero serpents that wear the headdress of Xiuhcoatl, God of Fire and Time, represent the compound, green-feathered creator deity that subsumes the old fire god in the primordial sea described in the Sahagun text quoted above, and also as described in the Popol Vuh. Both Quiche and Aztec creation stories describe complex creator deities, usually with both male and female elements. The primeval, crocodilian inhabitant of the sea before creation {Cipactli) is a female force and is also the first day of the calendar (L?pez et al. 1991:99). The male energy may thus be in Xiuhcoatl and the rings on the headdress denote the number two, naming the serpent as the male-female creator god(s), Ometeotl or "two-god."21 In the past, the two forehead rings were thought to identify the rear "head" as the storm god, Tlaloc, who usually wears such rings as goggles. The headdress does not represent Tlaloc, but it should be noted that the fangs of Tlaloc are visible below the upper jaw, or within the gullet, as if Tlaloc were the one wearing it (fig. 6). In addition to the Xiuhcoatl identity, Karl Taube notes the resemblance of this crocodilian form to the war serpent regalia particularly evident in Maya regions and associated with Venus (1992). In this context, the two circles with internal crosses on the forehead of this headdress might denote "two" and be read as two Venus glyphs that refer to the two (morning and evening star) phases of Venus (Coggins 1980). Probably one of the key reasons for the Mesoamerican sanctity of the number 260 was that each of the two periods of Venus visibility averages 260 days (Aveni 1991:309-310). Apparently the Postclassic association of Quetzalcoatl with the dual planet, Venus, existed centuries earlier in the Ciudadela at Teotihuacan where, in addition to the Temple of Quetzalcoatl, an isolated temple in the western part of the plaza was decorated with Venus cycle signs (Cabrera 1982b:foto 6);22 other significant indications of Venus symbolism in the Ciudadela are discussed by Sugiyama (1993:114, 116, 121). In 1981 Michael Coe suggested that the Temple of Quetzalcoatl represents the "initial creation of the universe from a watery void through a series of dual oppositions" (168). The sea is evoked here by the wavy undulations of the talud serpent, the seashell 21. Saburo Sugiyama informs me that in his dissertation he has also identified the forehead rings as of numeric value, but that he rejects the Xiuhcoatl interpretation for the headdress. He views the top half of the headdress "head" as the same as the later, trapezoidal Mexican year sign, with its characteristic knot. Thus the headdress of the serpent has its own headdress and identifies the underlying calendric role of the serpent (Sugiyama, pers. comm.; 1995:76-77). I agree with this brilliant interpretation and have noted that such a piling up of headdresses occurs on the La Mojarra stela, as discussed below. 22. These quadripartite signs, probably representing a Venus cycle, are found associated with pairs of disks that may have numerical connotations (like those on the Temple of Quetzalcoatl headdresses) carved on the taluds and tableros of three seventh century temple platforms at the Maya city of Tikal in Guatemala (Strs. 5C-53, 5D-43, 6E-144) (Rodriguez and Rosal 1987).</page><page sequence="10">Coggins: Creation religion and the numbers at Teotihuacan and Izapa 25 backgrounds of the balustrades, the taluds and tableros, and probably by the rows of chalchihuitls that frame the tableros (fig. 4).23 Taken together, these marine motifs suggest the pyramid is to be understood as being underwater, and it is conceivable that the primordial sea was actually recreated inside the Ciudadela in a reenactment of the Creation, if only once or twice, at a 52 year interval, before the pyramid was burned and partially covered by the later "adosada" structure that was added to the front.24 The Ciudadela is like no other Mesoamerican structure (fig. 3);25 it enclosed, with polished, plastered walls, the polished, plastered floors of a huge interior plaza and thus could have served as a watertight container, and I have postulated that it was flooded periodically (1986).26 In such a flood the water would surround and rise up the terraces of the Temple of Quetzalcoatl, which are decorated with shells as if under the sea; then, at the time of the recreation, the water would be emptied, allowed to ebb, as in the Popol Vuh description: "The water should be removed, emptied out for the formation of the earth's own plate and platform, then comes the sowing, the dawning of the sky-earth." The creator deity which thinks this act is the "Plumed Serpent... in the water, a glittering light . . . enclosed in quetzal feathers, in blue-green" (Tedlock 1985:73).27 In the tableros of the Temple of Quetzalcoatl, the Plumed Serpent is wearing its thinking or creating cap?the headdress that may identify the God of Fire as the Old God of the Year or Time mentioned in the N?huatl excerpt quoted above. Quetzalcoatl was understood by the Aztec to be the creator of structured time, or the calendar, within an "omni-present uncalendarized time/' as Alfredo L?pez Austin et al. have recently noted in a discussion of this temple (1991:95, 99). The dialectic within divine thought between chaos and order, nature and culture, and the formless and the structured is the implicit message of the Temple of Quetzalcoatl and, by extension, of every Teotihuacan talud-tablero, wherever one was built. The naturally sloping talud may signify the underlying mountain or created earth, and thus be understood to refer to the cave of origin, as in the painting at Tepantitla. The tablero is a nonstructural architectural ornament; its quadrangular and artificial form is a conceptual accretion that contrasts with the 23. A comparable, and probably derivative, architectural program with similar imagery of the primordial maritime environment is found in the modeled stucco "tableros" of Str. 1-sub at Dzibilchaltun, Yucatan, built about 500 years after the Temple of Quetzalcoatl. There, the sea is identified by sea creatures, with signs for waves and shells. The bodies of the Dzibilchaltun serpents intertwine and undulate to suggest the feathered serpent or K'uk'ulkan, by showing a wavelike serpent, or kukulkan, in a typically Mayan play on words (Coggins 1983, 1988:76). 24. Whereas 52 years denoted a completed Calendar Round cycle, two times 52, or 104 years marked two complete Calendar Rounds, 73 x 520 days, and the simultaneous supremely important completion of 13 Venus cycles. 25. The long rectangular "Systems M and IV" at Monte Alban are similar in completely enclosing (much smaller) plazas; they postdate the Ciudadela by at least three-four centuries (Fahmel Beyer 1991:107-119, 132-140). 26. This suggestion was met with skepticism by some Teotihuacan archaeologists. It presents a Cecil B. DeMille scenario and is very difficult to demonstrate, so skepticism is appropriate. However, I believe one criticism was that the R?o San Juan is lower than the Ciudadela, and thus could not have filled it. I offer the following bits of evidence in further support of the theory: the course of the river was moved north to accommodate construction of the Ciudadela (Mill?n 1992:391-392; Sugiyama 1993:111), and immediately to the east of the Ciudadela there was once a reservoir at what is one of the lowest, most frequently flooded points at the site (Martinez and Jarquin 1982:42-43; Mill?n et al. 1973:map). According to the map, the banks of the R?o San Juan are 2,275 m (above sea level), while the modern floor of the Ciudadela is two-three m higher (Romero and Monz?n 1982:189-194). Two summary reports on the 1980-1982 excavations at Teotihuacan mention that Patricia Quintanilla located a drain, or aqueduct, that connected the river to the Ciudadela at a very deep level (Cabrera 1982a:32) and excavated a (connected?) canal within the Ciudadela that delivered water to a "pit" at the exact center of the compound (fig. 3) (Rodriguez 1982:56, 67-68). Quintanilla describes, very briefly, her excavation of this central "pit" or pool (5.67 m x 4.70 m in diameter) which was discontinued at a depth of about five m (2,272 m above sea level) when the water table was encountered (1982:185-187; Sugiyama 1993:fig. 3). Furthermore, during the installation of modern drainage in the western half of the Ciudadela, an ancient drain was located at a depth of 2,274.98 m (Romero and Monz?n 1982:189-191 ). Thus, the water table and the river were not much lower than the floor of the Ciudadela, and if the river were dammed, particularly in the summer rainy season, water could have been diverted through a drain into the Ciudadela for a reenactment of Creation, on August 12-13 and in the months preceding. If present at the early date of such a flooding (which need not have been deep), the apartment compounds flanking and to the east of the pyramid could have been walled off, or allowed to flood. Water management was highly developed in Preclassic Mesoamerica; the apparently ceremonial diversion of water through drains and its impoundment in lagunas is attested at Early Preclassic Olmec San Lorenzo (Coe and Diehl 1980:30, 118-126); whereas at Late Preclassic Tlalancaleca, Tlaxcala, much closer to Teotihuacan, ceremonial structures were placed so that water channeled from a spring might flow around and between them (Garcia 1981:259-260); while far to the south at Izapa, Preclassic drains and lagunas were found at the center of the site (Lowe et al. 1982:167-173). 27. In the Popol Vuh, the word that describes the primordial sea before the Creation is "pooled" (see above). Edmonson's translation of this Quiche word (emanik), used more than once in this context, is both "pooled" and "dammed" (1971:119.131.133); this seems to imply confinement of some kind.</page><page sequence="11">26 RES 29/30 SPRING/AUTUMN 1996 underlying talud and may be understood to signify measured space and numbered time. Like all such dualities, these are found at different scales at Teotihuacan. On a larger scale, the talud is to the tablero as the valley is to the city, or on a smaller scale, within the tablero, as Quetzalcoatl is to the headdress. Together the talud and the tablero signify Teotihuacan, where time began. Teotihuacan knowledge Tablero knowledge was sacred, secret, and confined to measurements and to chosen words. Esther Pasztory characterizes Teotihuacan figures that wear the nose pendant or plaque that covers their mouths as effectively mute (fig. 7). In discussing the uniformity, abstraction, and remoteness of Teotihuacan art, she speaks of deliberately hidden meanings, yet emphasizes the importance of speech as evident from the ubiquitous speech scroll (1992:302-306). "Teotihuacan silence and secretiveness can give way to speech [she states] but. . . this speech has local meaning" (305). Pasztory makes a distinction between two kinds of communication analogous to the distinction made here between two kinds of knowledge, and consequently between two kinds of speech. Tablero speech may be symbolized in a highly conventionalized stone deity head that is reduced to headdress, earflares, and rectangular "nosebar" (Berrin and Pasztory 1993:172), or mouth plaque (fig. 7a). Here the plaque may be interpreted as the sign for the tablero, or for calculated, hidden knowledge as it was articulated by this god(?). Whereas on a ceramic mask (fig. 7b) (which probably comes from an assembled incense burner used in lineage ritual) the mouth plaque mimics the complete talud-tablero, as well as the common conventionalized butterfly shape (Von Winning 1987:1:115-124; Kubier 1973a:32). This ceramic "portrait," perhaps of a lineage founder, memorializes him as a speaker of talud-tablero, or Teotihuacan, knowledge and, by use of the visual pun of the butterfly, also conveys the meaning of the soul after death. The butterfly symbolized the soul of the valiant Aztec warrior and, like the butterfly, both the soul/spirit and words were lighter than air. On this ceramic mask, the mouthpiece symbolized the revered Teotihuacan words of the ancestor. At Teotihuacan, religious and calendric knowledge were specialized into a popular creation religion tied to the Pyramid of the Sun and various separate priestly counts; these involved the sun, the ritual calendar, the Venus cycle (with a focus in the Ciudadela), and perhaps the 819-day count, and others for which we have no evidence. These two complementary categories of Teotihuacan religion and ritual were symbolized by the talud-tablero temple facade, which related to human beings only in its adaptation as a mouthpiece and a sign for Teotihuacan speech. Before time began Someone was counting time before Teotihuacan, or its plan could not have been determined by the number of days between solar events. If the talud-tablero signified a particular body of sacred calendric knowledge, its origin might help explain the founding of ' " '.' '.. * .iS???y*- ' .' ? . : /. A B Figure 7.

According to Ang?l Garc?a Cook, the talud-tablero was present about 60 km southeast of Teotihuacan, in the Puebla Tlaxcala Valley, by 350-300 B.c. (1984:32). There, the large planned town of Tlalancaleca, oriented to the cardinal points, or equinoxes (1981:fig. 8-7), was densely populated between about 800-300 b.c., with sophisticated terraced irrigation, canals, and reservoirs. Tlalancaleca was probably the capital of a "regional theocratic state" (ibid., 258) where by the middle of the fourth century B.c. they built stuccoed talud-tablero-faced structures with flat balustrades like those 500 years later at Teotihuacan (ibid., figs. 8-10). This northern Puebla Tlaxcala Valley culture grew and prospered until about a.D. 100, when Garcia Cook postulates much of the population moved to Teotihuacan (ibid., 260).28 George Cowgill states that talud-tableros are unknown at Teotihuacan before a.D. 150 (n.d., 5), perhaps implying that they were introduced with the construction of the Ciudadela. If this were true, then the dramatic changes at Teotihuacan at about a.D. 150-200 may have involved the introduction of a new religion associated with talud-tableros at the Temple of Quetzalcoatl, and the temporary eclipse of the old creation religion, with its mountain and cave of origin, as exemplified by the Pyramid of the Sun. Teotihuacan's main route to the Gulf Coast was across the Puebla-Tlaxcala Valley, and the only "foreign" motif known on the talud-tablero temple structures of the Street of the Dead is the interlocking scrolls traditionally associated with the central Gulf Coast,29 while the famous stone ballcourt marker that exhibits such scrolls was ritually cached in a compound in the southern part of the site (Rattray 1992:73, 111 ). It is clear that the relationship between the two areas was active at an elite level in the third century A.D., and probably long before. Ancient Aztec tradition suggests theTeotihuacanos came from the Gulf Coast (Le?n Portilla 1992:12-14), and some linguists believe the language of Teotihuacan was probably Totonac (Justeson et al. 1985:68), which is now spoken between Teotihuacan and the coast. Tlalancaleca (1200 b.c-a.d. 100) in the northern Puebla-Tlaxcala Valley, near where Totonac is spoken (Arana 1953), was contemporary with the Olmec on the Gulf Coast, and the presence at the site of stone sarcophagi may indicate the local burial of an Olmec-related elite (Garcia 1981:252). Central Gulf Coast Olmec culture, from 1200-500 b.c., was probably the intellectual cradle of Mesoamerica (Coe 1989). A system of written signs was developed within the greater sphere of Olmec influence many centuries before Teotihuacan's founding, and in the first century b.c., central Gulf Coast descendants of the Olmec were erecting monuments and recording dates. By the second century A.D., around the Bay of Alvarado, dates and historic events were carved in a writing system that was ancestral to Mayan hieroglyphics. Also used was the Maya Long Count, which is the cyclical (nonobservational) calendar that began August 12, 3114 B.c. on the day after the Calendar Round day 4 Ahaw 8 Cumku, which determined the orientation of Teotihuacan.30 Early links between Teotihuacan, the Puebla-Tlaxcala Valley, and the Gulf Coast have been noted to suggest that the esoteric tablero knowledge reached Teotihuacan from the central Gulf Coast by way of the elite culture of the northern Puebla-Tlaxcala Valley. Gulf Coast knowledge A huge basalt stela from La Mojarra (fig. 8), from the south central Gulf Coast of Veracruz, records two Long Count dates, in the years a.D. 143 and 156, contemporary with the vast hydraulic and construction projects at Teotihuacan in which the R?o San Juan was moved and the Ciudadela built. Some analysts of this inscription identify Venus glyphs in the inscription and believe these denote the conjunctions of planets (Hall 1991; Macri and Stark 1993). Another Long Count date, six years later, that is related to the La Mojarra Stela inscription was inscribed on the small, greenstone Tuxtla Statuette; according to Robert Hall (1991) this may involve calculations that use the 819-day count (which is a product of the sacred numbers 7, 9, 13, and in later Mayan inscriptions is associated with the four directions and their colors). As noted above, the 28. The excavations at Tlalancaleca were limited salvage operations, so it is difficult to evaluate the relative dates of the other significant cultural traits present at this site (Garcia 1981, 1984). 29. These are in the "Edificios Superpuestos," northwest of the Ciudadela (S?nchez 1991) where, in addition to the well-known "Templo Pintado," a talud-tablero "altar" from the earliest phase, may also exhibit coastal motifs (ibid., 68, 71). 30. Long Count dates are known from three south-central Gulf Coast locations on the northern margin of the old Olmec heartland, around the Bay of Alvarado: a stela from Tres Zapotes records a date in 31 b.c.; the La Mojarra Stela (discussed below); and a greenstone statuette from Tuxtla with a short inscription records a date in a.D. 162 (Meluzin 1992). A fourth monument from Alvarado bears an illegible inscription in what may be the same script (Covarrubias 1966:fig. 29). This tall stela apparently shows an Olmec captive seated before a ruler/ballplayer.</page><page sequence="13">28 RES 29/30 SPRING/AUTUMN 1996 819-day count apparently figured in the layout of Teotihuacan (Sugiyama 1993:111 ) and this Gulf Coast inscription may provide further (hidden and inferential) evidence for its Late Preclassic use. The long inscription on the La Mojarra Stela surrounds a commanding figure who wears a complicated and imposing headdress (fig. 8). In ancient Mesoamerica, the headdress identified the role and carried the message, as noted in regard to the Temple of Quetzalcoatl tableros. This headdress comprises five subsidiary heads, which can be sorted into two categories: maritime and celestial. The principal one, a long-"lipped" head without lower jaw, looms over a headband with two smaller versions of the same head, except these have triangular headdresses of their own, which are shark teeth. The large head of the headdress has two headdresses of its own, which further identify it. In the place of the smaller heads' shark teeth, the large head has a shark. This shark's head (with a Venus eye) has its own shark fin headdress and a long, piscine body outlined by a cord and a row of what may be baby sharks.31 The front half of this headdress is a squared, bearded human head with solar characteristics and rectangular frames that denote the year count. Thus this powerful person wears a shark headdress that wears a smaller solar count headdress. The shark signifies the count, probably of the Venus or 260-day cycles, because the word for shark, xok, in Yucatec Mayan also means count.32 The La Mojarra Stela was found in a river near the coast, where the shark was the most fearsome denizen of the nearby ocean and for these people symbolized the terrible generative force in the primordial sea. As in the characteristically humanistic portraiture of the Gulf Coast and later Maya, it is the subsidiary headdress of an identified individual's shark headdress that denoted the sun and the year, whereas the dangerous plumed serpents (rattlesnakes) at Teotihuacan had their own calendric headdresses on the Temple of Quetzalcoatl?entirely without allusion to human beings. Long Count inscriptions from the south-central Gulf Coast testify to the use of the historic Long Count in conjunction with the solar and ritual counts, and probably also with the Venus, other planetary, and 819-day cycles. These are all related to historic individuals and make little allusion to creation mythology, except perhaps in the shark as creator of the count and denizen of the primordial sea. These Late Preclassic proto-Zoque uses of the calendar, writing, and iconography were later developed in the lowland Maya tradition and in Mayan languages.33 J |H_G F E JL_g_B A U^ S ^ B) ^,fca $33 C?

These creatures are usually identified iconographically as fish (Barthel and Von Winning 1989:93, 95), but they may be part of what Shelton P. Applegate, Investigador Titular, Departamento de Paleontolog?a, Universidad Aut?noma de M?xico, a specialist in sharks, believes was a Preclassic culture of sharks that later, inland, was conflated with crocodilian imagery. Shark teeth are found in caches and burials, including a huge fossil tooth in Tomb A at Olmec La Venta (S. P. Applegate, pers. comm.). On the La Mojarra stela, the shark's teeth, the shark fin that resembles a chipped stone knife, and the cord, together suggest a complex of ritual bloodletting. 32. J. E. S. Thompson noticed this pun in the Mayan inscriptions (1944), while more recent research has shown that the English word "shark" derives from the Maya xok, introduced into England by sixteenth-century English sailors returning from the Caribbean (Jones 1985). The La Mojarra inscription is believed to be written in "pre proto-Zoque," a descendant of the Olmec language, while this word and the writing itself are ancestral to Mayan hieroglyphic writing Gusteson and Kauffman 1993). 33. A major problem in understanding this critical Late Preclassic period is the unknown role of the huge Mayoid site of El Mirador in relation to the developments discussed in this paper.</page><page sequence="14">Coggins: Creation religion and the numbers at Teotihuacan and Izapa 29 Figure 9. Incised Femur, Tomb 1, Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas, M?xico. From Agrignier 1960:fig. 1. The same dual relationship seen in the headdress of the La Mojarra Stela, with identical symbolism, has long been known from carved bones excavated from a tomb at Chiapa de Corzo, halfway between the Gulf and the Pacific coasts (Agrignier 1960). Here, two creatures swim in a watery environment (fig. 9). The "front" head is the same as the La Mojarra shark heads, including a secondary row of shark teeth and a fin atop its head. Behind it, apparently independently, the same bearded, framed solar head swims backward. These images make the same distinctions as in the La Mojarra headdress, the Temple of Quetzalcoatl tableros, and eventually in the whole development of the double-headed Maya celestial serpent (Coggins 1988).34 Often called "Izapan" in style, the Chiapa de Corzo bones are really more like the sophisticated sculpture of Kaminaljuyu, in the Guatemalan highlands. They are evidence of the body of calendric knowledge that was preserved and shared in the first centuries of our era by an exclusive, perhaps dynastically related, elite. Found from Kaminaljuyu to Teotihuacan, passing through the lowlands of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and by way of the Gulf Coast, this learning was perhaps embedded in a single esoteric language. Izapa On the Pacific Coast at the southern end of the Chiapas corridor, the Mixe language (related to the northern Gulf Coast Zoque) was probably spoken at the site of Izapa (Lowe et al. 1982:326). Izapa was contemporary with Chiapa de Corzo to the north and Abaj Takalik to the east, but its ceremonial activities resembled neither of these places. There are 253 worked stone monuments known from Izapa (Lowe et al. 1982:89), more than at any other site for 700-800 years.35 Thirty-eight of these are carved stelae, but there are no Long Count dates or historical inscriptions at Izapa and only one possible formal ruler portrait (Stela 4). Izapan carved stelae are extraordinary for a dramatic narrative style, in which each tells a story or reenacts a mythological event. Elsewhere, as at La Mojarra and Abaj Takalik, inscriptions were used to record time in the Long Count in relation to the lives of identified individuals; at Izapa the monuments seem oblivious of history. Like all important Mesoamerican sites, Izapa was planned and oriented to significant astronomical events (fig. 10). The eastern focus is sunrise at the winter solstice, while the secondary, northern focus is a huge volcano, Tacana; the secondary northern focus of Teotihuacan, four-five centuries later, was also volcanic.36 Between 500-200 b.c. at Izapa, pyramidal structures were built along three parallel plazas with north-south axes, and in the east and west plazas both carved and plain stelae with altars were erected in front of them. Apparently unencumbered by the formalizing and abstracting effects of tablero knowledge or of hieroglyphic writing, the Izape?os illustrated the subject of the ritual performed in each of these plazas; in fact, Lowe et al. believe the monuments were organized by a formal ritual circuit (1982:31). Izapa seems to provide graphic confirmation of Mircea Eliade's observation that ritual is often the reenactment of cosmogonie events (Beane and Doty 1975:1:132-140), since the rising, setting, and cycling of celestial bodies was celebrated there (Coggins 1982). 34. Twenty years ago, in an analysis of such "heads" in their many forms, I associated the "front" head with the east, sunrise, and birth, and the "rear" head with the west, sunset, and death. It is evident that these structural symbols are more broadly astronomical and calendric. The eastern, usually serpentine, head may also denote the heliacal rise of Venus, and perhaps other celestial bodies, whereas the western head, which is usually anthropomorphic and often skeletal, signifies the completion or death of calendric and celestial cycles (Coggins 1975:16-19). 35. At Classic Maya Calakmul, Campeche, Mexico, at least 140 stelae were erected (Marcus 1987:53). 36. Three of the four major loci of Early-Middle Preclassic Mesoamerican culture were located near volcanos: (1) the Olmec and the Tuxtla mountains; (2) the Valleys of Mexico and Puebla-Tlaxcala settlements and Popocatepetl and Xitle; and (3) Mayoid sites from Izapa to Chalchuapa, respectively near Volcanoes Tacana and llopongo, with more sites and volcanoes in between. Only the Valley of Oaxaca has no such association (fig. 1 ).</page><page sequence="15">30 RES 29/30 SPRING/AUTUMN 1996 Figure 10. Plan of Izapa, Chiapas, M?xico. After Ekholm 1969:fig. 4. Numbers indicate the monuments discussed. Plan: Elizabeth W?hle. The celestial cycle The east group (Group B) at Izapa celebrates emergence. One east-facing monument depicts the ascent of the flaming sun from the jaws of the crocodilian earth (fig. 11);37 another depicts the heliacal rise of Venus after its disappearance into the Underworld (fig. 12);38 a third, the emergence of a butterfly from its chrysalis (Stela 28); and a fourth (a huge Olmec-related carved boulder), the possible emergence of a figure from the open jaws of an earth monster (Miscellaneous Monument 2; Norman 1976:256-259). At the center of the plaza, at the foot of the main northern pyramid, three plain cylinders each balances a round ball on top (fig. 10, numbers 5, 7, and 9).39 These may be gnomons, used for identifying the two days when the sun was at its zenith, thus identifying the beginning of the year count and the commemoration of the day that time began at the latitude where this had occurred.40 37. Garth Norman interprets Stela 11 in the opposite sense, as the descent of a sky deity into the underworld (1976:112-113). The bands at the top of the monument denote the sky; they are a kind of celestial toponym for Izapa. 38. Garth Norman's discussion of Stela 50 associates the skeleton's pelvis with both the Maya kin sign for a day and the lamat Venus glyph (1976:145-150). This image may provide graphic documentation for an early form of the Venus glyph (see also fig. 8, glyphs C2 and C4) whose quadripartite form denotes a completed cycle of time, as does the solar Win sign (Coggins 1980). The completion of the 584-day Venus cycle, the completion of the eight year solar cycle, which equals five solar cycles, and the completion of the eight days of Venus disappearance (inferior conjunction) are all symbolized here in the skeletal imagery that later defines completion in Maya hieroglyphic writing. 39. Garth Norman interprets these pillars with balls (Miscellaneous Monuments 5-10) as having planetary symbolism (1976:264). 40. The balls on top of these pillars would cast no shadows at noon on the two days of solar zenith and thus might have functioned</page><page sequence="16">Coggins: Creation religion and the numbers atTeotihuacan and Izapa 31 Figure 11.

In the West Plaza (Group A), associated with sunset, the three axial monuments portray the descent of celestial bodies. On the axis of the south structure, a winged figure dives downward toward a tree with crocodilian roots (fig. 13).41 In front of the principal north structure, a toadlike earth monster receives the setting moon into its open jaws (fig. 14) while farther north on this axis, at a higher level, a winged figure descends toward a winged warrior figure (Stela 4). A symbolic structure or rationale for the placement of the Izapan stelae is suggested here, although the actual myths illustrated were surely multivalent in their symbolism and local significance and changed through time in relation to Izapan ritual. The monuments described above all present an astronomical dimension that in ancient Mesoamerica implied the various counts of the calendar. As at later Teotihuacan, inscriptional evidence for the use of the basic Calendar Round at Izapa is equivocal,42 although at Chiapa de Corzo to the north and Abaj Takalik to the east monuments displayed the Maya Long Count in the first centuries A.D. Use of the Long Count involved use of the Calendar Round, but the Calendar Round was older and independent of the Long Count. If the Long Count was used at Izapa, it was secret priestly knowledge, perhaps considered a higher (or a foreign) order of knowledge that was inappropriate for the narrative monuments. Perhaps this was analogous to the distinction between a demotic creation religion of the talud and the hidden counts of the conceptual tablero atTeotihuacan as postulated above. Creation religion and the numbers Different levels of knowledge may be the subject of Izapa Stela 25 (fig. 15), which stood east of the axial winged warrior stela (#4) at the north end of the West Plaza, although other supplementary, rather than contradictory, levels of interpretation may also have been intended.

Norman interprets the two small figures that flank the tree on Stela 2 as the Hero Twins from the Popol Vuh whose miraculous birth depended on a skull/calabash tree (1976:92-94). The direction south tends to be associated with the Underworld in most of Mesoamerica (Coggins 1980, 1988), so the location of this monument in front of the south structure supports Norman's interpretation of this mythical tree, which was located in the Underworld. 42. A few elements like day signs with numbers are associated with each site (painted on stucco atTeotihuacan, carved in stone at Izapa), but these are isolated and lack a larger explanatory context (Caso 1967; Norman 1976:141, 282-284).</page><page sequence="17">32 RES 29/30 SPRING/AUTUMN 1996 Figure 15. Izapa, Stela 25, volcanic tuff, H: 1.28 m. From Smith 1984:fig. 56c. mediating element, belonging to the right half yet tied into the left. On the left side a bird sings among the leaves of the highest branch of a tree with crocodilian roots and bark. This terrestrial crocodile is also seen on stelae 2 and 11 (figs. 11, 13). At the base of Stela 25 the crocodile's snout overlaps a rectilinear frame in which a man stands. The man, whose left arm is severed and bleeding, looks upward toward a huge, ungainly "bird" perched on top of the pole, which the man holds upright in his right hand. This pole, a wooden upright with three wooden cross bars, is set into an olla, or ceramic vessel. The tail of a long sinuous snake ties the body of the big bird loosely to the pole, looping around the crocodilian trunk of the tree to terminate with its head silhouetted against the olla. The big bird, which wears a bird headdress, has crocodilian legs and feet, a long feather tail, and uplifted wings (as if trying to fly away); its visible wing has a serpent motif and rectangular emblem that might be a Venus sign. In later Maya imagery, such "serpent-birds" are associated with the highest heavens and with the larger calendric divisions of the Maya Long Count (Bardawil 1976). At one level, this monument illustrates the evolutionary nature-culture dichotomy that was exemplified in the sequence of creations. In the Popol Vuh, from the mountains northeast of Izapa, the Creator first made the trees and animals. Then, after three failed efforts, an acceptable human being was created. On Stela 25, the natural world of trees and singing birds is contrasted with that of man the builder and man the thinker. He stands on a constructed, rectangular platform and holds a crafted artificial tree, which rests in a manufactured, worked clay container. The crowning glory of these intellectual constructions is a completely unnatural, supernatural bird that denotes the Long Count and thus a particular, arbitrary order that was imposed by the counting of time.43 However, the natural and cultural spheres, while contrasted, are also interconnected here by the snake that twines them together. Man, who organizes the landscape by building and orders time by counting, is portrayed naturalistically, even "poetically" whereas at Teotihuacan, this cosmic dichotomy is expressed conceptually in the solemn and abstract contrast between the tablero and the talud of sacred architecture. The ordering of time is a divine attribute; this Mesoamerican truism leads to a second level of interpretation of this monument, which develops naturally from the first. According to the Popol Vuh, there was still darkness after the third unsuccessful creation of humans?of wooden manikins?who were destroyed. Then a false sun appeared; this was the giant bird Seven Macaw, who proclaimed: I am great. My place is now higher than that of the human work, the human design. I am their sun and I am their light, and I am also their months. So be it: my light is great. I am the walkway and I am the foothold of the people, because my eyes are of metal. My teeth just glitter with jewels. . . . And this nose of mine shines white into the distance like the moon. Since my nest is metal, it lights up the face of the earth. Seven Macaw puffs himself up as the days and the months. . . ,44 Such hubris cannot, of course, be allowed by the gods, so the divine twins, Hunahpu and Xbalanque, determined to shoot Seven Macaw with their blow guns. They shot him in the jaw. He fell from his tree and tore off Hunahpu's arm. The boys' grandparents offered to ease the pain of Seven Macaw's broken jaw and managed to pull his glittering teeth and replace them 43. The structure of the Long Count reflects no astronomical cycles. 44. Tedlock 1985:86. This particular finery could not have existed in the second or third century A.D. if this myth was known at Izapa since there was no metalworking in Mesoamerica for another 600 years. However, shining metallic surfaces were achieved with iron pyrite, crystalline hematite, and magnetite, for instance.</page><page sequence="18">Coggins: Creation religion and the numbers atTeotihuacan and Izapa 33 with corn until "the last of the greatness left him" (Tedlock 1985:94). As others have noted, this stela probably shows Seven Macaw in a "tree" and Hunahpu with his severed arm (Lowe et al. 1982:297-299). It provides the strongest evidence that creation stories like those in the Popol Vuh were known at Izapa in the first centuries of our era, where they may have been reenacted dramatically as by the modern Chorti (Girard 1979; see also Vogt and Bricker, in this volume). In the initial analysis of Stela 25, the nature-culture polarity was considered. At a second level, there is a contrast here between everyman's culture and the rich, powerful, and esoteric culture of the presumptuous bird.45 In the story, the brothers' blow gun prevailed and the grandparents replaced the ostentatious jewels with corn. On the stela the bird has been caught and tamed; it is unable to fly away from its man-made perch. At a third level of analysis, this late stela may prefigure and reflect the end of Izapa.46 At about the time of this monument, Izapan occupation diminished and ritual activity was concentrated in a northern group of buildings while elsewhere, "Izapan" and other Late Preclassic monuments with inscriptions were destroyed (Lowe et al. 1982:28). The story of Seven Macaw might represent the "Izapan" (Mixe language?) struggle against the Long Count-using Mayan speakers of the south coast (to the east) and the Long Count-using Zoque speakers of the Gulf Coast who are together symbolized by the calendric role of Seven Macaw, thus exemplifying a split between the two essential components of the Mixe-Zoque Isthmian tradition. Before the La Mojarra Stela was known, Gareth Lowe postulated a split between the Late Olmec proto-Zoque/proto-Mayan speakers and the Long Count-using Lowland Maya (1977:237). Now, the apparent continuities from the "pre-proto-Zoque" La Mojarra Stela inscription and iconography into the later lowland Maya suggest that the split may, instead, have been between the southeastern Mixe and the proto-Zoque/proto-Mayan speakers. It seems likely that all three cultural/linguistic groups were present at Late Preclassic Kaminaljuyu, where this rupture may have been played out in monument destruction and eventually in the loss of the writing tradition. In these struggles, the proud oral tradition, in which the calendric knowledge was invisible but defined the world and measured time as is likely at Izapa and Teotihuacan, confronted an elite written tradition. In this tradition, the calendar was traced back much farther than human memory. It was recorded, fixed, and tied to the lives of historic men, as at La Mojarra and Abaj Takalik. Later, at Teotihuacan and in the Guatemalan highlands, the oral tradition persisted and prevailed, while the Long Count-using, writing Maya moved north from the Pacific coast and highlands. The second-century Teotihuacan distinction, on the Temple of Quetzalcoatl, between "privileged" numeric tablero knowledge and "popular" creation talud mythology is reflected in the dualities of the contemporary Stela 25 at Izapa, where all such imagery soon ceased, perhaps so that oral tradition might preserve it unseen. Originally, the creation stories of Early Preclassic Mesoamerica, integrated with the Calendar Round near the fifteenth north latitude, were surely shared by the Gulf Coast Olmec and spread northwest from the Gulf into the highland Valley of Teotihuacan, as well as back across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec to where they were forged, changing their relative significance and societal role in each receiving language and culture. These creation myths and their consequent birth and migration stories became separated from the increasingly esoteric corpus of calendric calculation and each culture embodied and enacted this schism differently.47 In the later Classic Maya Lowlands to the north, the calendric knowledge supported dynastic history in hieroglyphic writing, while the creation mythology became invisible and disappeared into the oral tradition. 45. Yet another level of analysis interprets this story as an explanation of the movement of the constellations (Girard 1979:68-72). Gareth Lowe et al. analyze the stelae of Izapa as functional elements in ritual calendrical counts (1982:275-289)?a likelihood that obviates none of the other interpretations. 46. Lowe et al. describe the Late Preclassic Guillen Phase (ca. 300-50 b.c.) following the end of Olmec La Venta as the height of Izapan growth and the succeeding Terminal Preclassic-Protoclassic Hato Phase (ca. 50 b.c.-a.d. 100) as one of reduced ritual activity and no construction at the center of the site (1982:129, 133, 135). The stelae are, as a corpus, ascribed to the Guillen phase, yet Stela 25 is always termed "late," and most analysts date it on stylistic grounds to A.D. 100-200 or later (Lowe et al. 1982:23, fig. 2.9; Norman 1976:136). 47. Perhaps only at Copan, at the sunrise frontier of Mesoamerica, where the zeniths accurately inaugurated the primeval counts of the tablero knowledge, did the named priestly rulers translate them into the Maya Long Count, tie them to their own history (which probably included Olmecoid, south coast, and Teotihuacan ancestry), and write it all down on stone, while still celebrating the old creation stories in monumental art. Only at Copan did the competing strands of this ancient Mesoamerican tradition remain entwined and functional until the end of baktun ten or "the collapse."</page><page sequence="19">34 RES 29/30 SPRING/AUTUMN 1996 BIBLIOGRAPHY Acosta, Jorge R. 1964 El palacio de Quetzalpap?lotl.
