<plain_text><page sequence="1">ALL SCIENCE IS ONE T. SWANN HARDING ABSTRACT The social sciences are not more difficult or complex than the physical and natural sciences. In all the sciences the forces and phenomena are infinite in number, compli- cated, elusive, diverse. The method is alike in all: the workers create causes to explain observed events. There must be abstraction with the assumption that certain axioms are true unproved and that certain factors do not vary or else are negligible in effect. In physics and biology, however, the workers have shown more tendency to agree upon the use of hypotheses, axioms, specific methods, classification, mathematics, and logic than have workers in the social sciences. The scientific worker is always himself part and parcel of the material with which he works. Objectivity, exactitude, and certitude are always but very relatively attained. My peace and tranquillity have been somewhat disturbed on several recent occasions by the fact that certain writers whose capacity for constructive thought consistently arouses my admiration keep saying, with varying choice of words, that the social sciences differ basically, fundamentally, and in kind from the physical and the natural sciences. In other words economics, political economy, and sociology can never approach the certitude and exactitude of physics, astronomy, and chemistry, not to mention geology, botany, and biology. Writing a most stimulating article in the American Mercury in February, I934, Henry Hazlitt based his argument upon the as- sumption that the social sciences are more difficult and complex than the physical and the biological, and therefore that the solution of problems therein is all but impossible. He quoted as an example of the exactitude and certitude of the best of the physical sciences, astronomy, the fact that Leverrier so accurately predicted the existence of the planet Neptune from his observations of the per- turbations of Uranus in its orbit. Indeed the astronomer, Galle of Berlin, had later but to point his telescope at the prescribed spot and there was Neptune. The specific example was singularly faulty because, as Lowell said in I9I5 when he himself was predicting the existence of a trans- Neptunian planet, Leverrier's prediction was predicated upon such enormous errors that its ultimate confirmation was most fortuitous 492</page><page sequence="2">ALL SCIENCE IS ONE 493 and accidental. Ironically enough it later proved that Lowell's own prediction was fulfilled fifteen years subsequently, and a small planet was found beyond Neptune, purely by accident. Indeed other mathematical methods of working out either prediction from the same observations would have invalidated them. But Mr. Hazlitt none the less remarked: "If economics is con- siderably less advanced than astronomy, it is not because economists on the whole are less intelligent than astronomers, nor is it because their methods are inferior. It is simply that the forces they have to deal with are infinitely more numerous, more complicated and diverse, and more elusive." This is the old alibi of the social scientist himself for his failure to accomplish as much as society expects of him. It was repeated in the very same month by another distin- guished thinker. For Max Eastman, writing in the New Republic,' said: "Social science, when it is applied in action on a grand scale, does differ from physical or mechanical or any other kind of engineering in that the scientists themselves are a part of the material they work with, and what they think about the experiment may affect its results." A careful reading of works by modern physical scientists tells pre- cisely the same story. They generally admit that they also are part of the material with which they work and, especially, that what they think about any experiment upon which they are engaged (the thought Mr. Eastman italicizes) always affects the results they se- cure. A little earlier J. J. Spengler was writing also in the American Mercury that "since no social science can attain to the objectivity and exactitude of physics and chemistry no social science can be a science in the sense that these latter are sciences." He also held that "social science differs categorically from physical science," because its exactitude and impersonality are mere pretenses, and because it cannot produce quantitatively statistical studies which will render verifiable predictions about future events. These statements, or at least the deductions drawn therefrom, sound strange to me after a long and arduous laboratory experience with physical and biological science. For in nearly twenty years of I February 2I, I934.</page><page sequence="3">494 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY such experience, actively engaged in research, I never encountered exactitude or certainty; I always found that what I thought about the matter affected the results of my experimentation; I discovered disturbing factors without number and matters that were dis- tractingly. diverse, complicated, and elusive; and I found it ex- ceedingly difficult ever to produce statistical studies that would predict future happenings in such a way that I knew accurately what they would be like. Let me be specific, always seeking to remember my laboratory experience as faithfully as possible. In just what way are the social sciences more complex than and so completely different from the physical and natural sciences? The assertions above are not made by novelists. We can forgive Cabell who, in one of his novels, evidences ignorance of geology and also finds symmetry in precisely that part of nature that is built upon the asymmetric carbon atom, but fails to apprehend it in the inanimate world where it is scienti- fically most prominent. We can forgive Proust for describing a bal- loon rising because it is filled with oxygen-though to be sure he does parenthetically remark, "or some such gas" ! But Hazlitt, Eastman, and Spengler are admirable thinkers. Does their error, if it is such, inhere in their lack of laboratory experience with physical and natural science? First, are the phenomena of the social sciences more elusive or unstable than those of physics, say? Or of biology? We think of the endless catalogues we find in the classificatory sciences-in botany, in geology, and in entomology- of the subtle way in which one class of objects merges into another. Nothing could be more elusive, nor anything more difficult than the attempt, for instance, definitely to show that certain organisms are vegetable or animal in nature. Again the varied factors involved in chemistry, in physics, and in biology are quite as numerous as those in social science. Consider, for instance, the innumerable factors that baffle the best physicists when they seek to explain the interior of the atom or the molecule of some complex compound. Indeed, as Read Bain has said some- where, if electrons were as big as baseballs, their antics would be quite as incalculable and seemingly erratic as those of real baseballs on the diamonds in play. It is because electrons are so minute and</page><page sequence="4">ALL SCIENCE IS ONE 495 that they can be dealt with en masse that they appear relatively orderly. But to this day the exact nature of electrons and atoms remains unknown. The explanations of various research workers differ enor- mously and depend absolutely upon what they think about the problem and how their bias affects the results they deduce from certain sensual observations made at second or third hand. More- over all sciences-botany, geology, chemistry, physics-show worlds forming and dissolving, classifications merging into each other, myriad factors operating, and thought always affecting the results of observation. In the laboratory I want to weigh a small glass beaker on the analytical balance. This is a simple thing. But is it? For the weigh- ing -to be correct the balance must stand upon something that is ultimately founded in solid rock beneath the earth. Sharp temper- ature changes in the room must be avoided. The beaker must have the same temperature as the room and the balance. It must not bear a moisture film upon it. The weights used must have been most carefully standardized and their individual differences from the standard must undergo correction. It must be supposed that gravi- tation or the physical effect of a certain star are no more powerful upon one pan of the balance than upon the other-and so on, end- lessly, through countless factors many of which cannot, properly speaking, be controlled at all. Even then the ultimate weight I accept for the beaker depends upon the number of weighings I make and average. If I make ten weighings and average them my result will differ from what it would have been had I made but eight weighings and averaged them. Just so had Lowell had in his possession the observations made on the rotations of Uranus and Neptune between I9I5 and I930, and had he been able to include these in the calculations he made in I9I5, his prediction of the location of a planet beyond Uranus would have been so far wrong as never to have been verified. But it so happened that, by calculating from the few and erroneous observations at hand in I9I5, Lowell was able quite accurately to predict the loca- tion of that planet, though it proved only one-seventh as large as he calculated!</page><page sequence="5">496 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY Then is there more order and certitude in physics, astronomy, chemistry, and biology than in the social sciences? We have just seen that there is not. The order in any science is placed there by the mind of the scientist which thus affects what is to be regarded as properly within the sphere of that science. As Charles Fort ironi- cally demonstrated, there will always be "damned facts" which every science will ignore with great deliberation. These facts cannot "belong" to that science because it would not be orderly to have them therein. Man's mind by itself makes the law and order that exist in any science, and this he then supervenes upon the raw and irrational activities of nature. But perhaps the social science phenomena are the more intangi- ble? Yet in any science we can only know what our very imperfect senses, aided or unaided, care to tell us. In every laboratory ex- periment I ever made I dealt constantly with intangibles, feeling I was always behind a thick veil seeking to apprehend what was on the other side and wondering often whether there was anything there at all. Genes, cells, protoplasm, electrons, protons, atoms- are all verbal devices, but they elude the grasp. What is protoplasm? There is no possible way of telling. It is a complex substance or a complex of substances that exists in the cells of living organisms. Any attempt to analyze it fails initially because we can analyze only dead stuff. So also any attempt to determine at once the velocity and the position of an electron fails because the mere processes involved in determining the one prevent us entirely from determining the other of these factors. No, the difficulties in all science are of one character. They are such difficulties as that of making honest and accurate observations and keeping accurate and comprehensible records about those ob- servations. This involves both the intelligent use of classification and some facility with verbal usage and the special meanings of words. There is also the difficulty of interpreting data in an un- prejudiced manner, of knowing when and how to use mathematical and logical manipulation, and of avoiding personal bias, or indi- vidual experimental errors, in so far as is possible. The physical sciences have long since utterly outstripped the social in the matter of demonstrating the non-sense of so-called com-</page><page sequence="6">ALL SCIENCE IS ONE 497 mon sense. The world of physical science differs entirely from the world of common sense, whereas the world of social science is much more easily comprehended because so much closer to common sense in structure. The physical and biological sciences are far more com- plex and far more difficult to understand than the social sciences; they are also far harder to apply practically. There is one scientific method applicable in all science. It consists of two parts: (i) the observation of the totality of things as they exist at the moment, and (2) the rational process by means of which causes are created to account for what has been observed sensually. This reasoning machine of ours works with a logic so rigorous that insanity actually intensifies that rigor. If certain things are assumed true as axioms, a point at which all sciences begin, then the machine will inexorably press out for us a definite set of fixed conclusions, precisely as a soap machine will press out perfumed green soap if you give it the proper ingredients, but red soap with an aromatic odor if you give it other raw material. Feed in certain fundamental postulates and you get out science pressed into certain forms. Feed in as Euclid did certain axioms, and you see emerge Euclidean geometry, complete and final, as to itself. But other geometries, altogether different, though quite as perfect, may be derived from the machine by feeding it a different set of axioms. But once the scientist settles upon his axioms, and he always has to do that arbitrarily and irrationally, the sort of logical edifice required will be erected automatically. But that structure of pure logic, says Euclidean geometry, very imperfectly serves the practical needs of the surveyor, who has in his turn to develop em- pirical additions of his own. Thus mechanics is what it is today because it is based on the second and the meter. What is the second? It is I/84,000 of a sidereal day. The length of this day is measured by chronometers which are in turn set by the sun. Hence the scientists assume that the rotation of the earth on its axis is constant, not constantly ac- celerating, before they set out to prove it, just as they invented the fiction of potential energy to save their "law" of the conservation of energy, all of which makes science very simple and bases it squarely upon the happy thought of the scientist.</page><page sequence="7">498 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY The meter was 40/I,000,000 of a terrestrial meridian. But the contraction of the earth made that figure wrong. So the length of a platinum-iridium bar in Paris became the conventional metrical unit. But more recently the wave lengths of certain irradiating atoms-which are variable-have become the unit. These things are all vague, intangible, and elusive. You may object that chronometer time does mean something because if the rotation of the earth on its axis was constantly ac- celerated that would render the time occupied by a chemical reaction variable, which would be, not impossible, but inconvenient. For convenience is the criterion after all, in any science, and in the physical and natural as in the social sciences the convenient assump- tions are made. If new facts appear that will not come within our rules, if the predictions of our science are too often incorrect, we create new causes to account for events and work out new logical systems that will predict correctly. This is true in every science. No logical scientific system can ever correctly predict the totality of all things. If it did it would be reality itself, per se. You can have a system of science called Socialism. That does not apply to present- day half-capitalistic conditions. Its laws are therefore at present true but inoperative. They are no more untrue than are the laws governing steam engines untrue after the railroad has been electri- fied. They are just inoperative. Moreover, a scientific law does not need facts to prove it true, and that is also the rule in any science. If we finally could see electrons, for instance, that would in a sense verify the beliefs of certain schools of physicists today. But if we never do find them, indeed if we get evidence contrary to their existence, the logic of physics will be changed, and new causes other than electrons will be created to account for those things we actually do sense-or those things we seriously believe we contact sensually. Scientific laws are true so long as they operate efficiently and quite regardless of whether there are or are not facts to verify them. The phlogiston theory in chemistry and that of epicycles in astronomy remained true, though the facts really did not sustain them at any time. But in the end so many contrary facts were apprehended that it became inconvenient to let those laws operate</page><page sequence="8">ALL SCIENCE IS ONE 499 any more so they were discarded. The theory of evolution is simply an axiom that permits the reasoning machine to interpret certain facts rationally and to stamp them out into what appears to be an orderly system. Any science is valuable only in so far as it is a system of causes which works best to suit our purposes in the world in which we live and knowing as much about it as we do at the moment. If we saw a group of events happening for the very first time, we could not possibly tell what might be expected to follow thereafter. We could simply observe, note the appearances before us, and try to cut out a logical system to fit. If we do that successfully, we re- gard what we saw as reality, and that is that. If we cannot do it, then we create new causes and from them fashion an entirely new reality, as modern physics did when it told us that this too solid desk had melted into wide open spaces between tiny fragments of concentrated electricity, and matter had dissolved into force. Social science never did anything so opposed to common sense as that. The social sciences also have an empirical branch in which facts are observed and a rational branch which expresses the common character of those facts in the form of laws and then creates causes to account for them. This is just the method of all other sciences. The causes are a system of initial propositions to be proved, axioms assumed to be true without proof, definitions to aid the reasoning process to conclude with certain other propositions that must coincide with the original laws derived from nature, or else the whole thing is hay-wire. We cannot scientifically predict the evolution of a social state any more than we can predict which way an electron will leap. But we can observe facts and record the laws that operate in that state, can discover, for instance, that if certain acts are prohibited certain people will violate the law. We can find out what laws are true. Making them operative is another matter. That depends on condi- tions at the moment. In ethics, for instance, certain situations in everyday life im- pressed upon the minds of men that certain laws operated. If a society were founded upon slavery, man at first enunciated some axiom which "explained" the necessity for and the essential goodness</page><page sequence="9">500 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY of that institution. He said that there were fundamental differences in quality among men, say-thereafter all that followed could be carried on with rigorous logic. The same general rules of what is good actually held in societies of very different character. A hundred and one systems of ethics all led to essentially the same ideas of the good. Yet each one was and is a logical structure which, though true, is inapplicable-save under certain very clearly defined conditions. Official Socialism and Communism are true, but they are at present inapplicable systems, for not even in Russia are they oper- ative. Alchemy and astrology are true systems of thought, within themselves and given their axioms, but they are no longer appli- cable. The physics of hard little billiard-ball atoms remains true, but it is not applicable to the reality physics knows today. There must always be constant transition, variation, and revolution throughout science. However, all sciences use the same general method. I return to my own laboratory experience and assume I am about to undertake research to solve a problem in organic or biological chemistry. First of all, I must make a pure assumption, a hypothesis of some sort, and suppose that a certain cause operates. I have now created this cause to account for a certain observed phenomenon. Even before that I limited my field of operation, because no one scientist can possibly seek to solve all the problems there are. Various factors induce a scientist to select, for instance, the nutri- tion of dairy cattle as his field. He observes that cows give more milk when they eat certain feeds, and he wonders why. He creates a cause to account for this observed fact, whereupon he tries to verify his hypothesis, assuming all the while that certain axioms hold true irrationally and sans proof-for instance, that the moon does not have a peculiar effect on the particular cows he studies. He also assumes that if he analyzes the blood of the cows, and their excretory products, he can discover how they utilized the food they ate. He assumes that cows actually do exist, and that any "compe- tent" person would observe as he observes, and so on. He considers certain factors as invariable, without proof. He assumes that the increasing age of the cows during the experimental</page><page sequence="10">ALL SCIENCE IS ONE 50I period has a negligible effect, that the period of their milk-giving cycle in which they happen to be does not affect his results, that men standing near the cows to perform certain tasks, the insects that bite and annoy them, the character of the water they drink, and so forth-these factors have no significant effect on his results. He assumes that the cows' lack of customary exercise likewise has no effect on them, and that they are not afflicted with some slow, wasting disease as yet undiscernible. Indeed he assumes any number of things. He then varies the feed of the animals, and assumes that this one variable factor produces all the phenomena he observes thereafter. Obviously the results secured by this scientist are affected by what he thinks and he forms part and parcel of his experiment. From start to finish of any piece of research in any science this is true. The scientist can never be completely objective in any science. Ab- solute exactitude and certitude are always denied him. After finish- ing his experiment he must critically appraise his results using mathematics and logic. He tries to be unbiased, but he must always believe something or other, and he is almost bound to think that his work is correct and conclusive. He is more than likely to think that his work verifies the original cause he created to account for the initial observed fact. He is most likely to believe in himself, in his special method, in his hypotheses, in the cause he created, and in the rightness of the conclusions he drew. He thus embarks upon the production of a doctrine. He may lose the ability to progress beyond that original self-created cause. He may become unable to form a new hypothesis, to create new causes as new facts are discovered, and to formulate greater truths. He may lose his revolutionary ardor. He thus becomes by so much less a scientist. In his lecture on "The Physical Sciences" at Cornell in early I934, Sir W. L. Bragg definitely showed that the physicist always forms part of his environment and of the objects he studies. This physicist while observing phenomena "wishes to remain unobserved him- self. It is impossible to remain unobserved, however, because he can only discover what they (phenomena) are doing by making</page><page sequence="11">502 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY them describe it to him. We cannot as physicists be non-interfering observers of any object in front of us; we must interfere with it, and the consequences of the interference cannot be exactly predicted." Sir William next compares the physicist to a man being examined by an insurance doctor as to the exact state of his health in order to enable the company to calculate its profits for the coming year to the penny. But he says in that case "we must suppose .... that the examination put the patient in such a nervous twitter as to make him an altered man. A subsequent examination would show how he had been altered by the last, but would again introduce a new in- calculable element." The physicist or biologist is always an altered man after performing every experiment, and he reacts in new and different ways in the case of each successive experiment because he has now developed certain well-defined expectations as to the be- havior of matter. These things that are supposed to be true only in the social sciences are true in all science because all science is one. There is only one scientific method. Many years ago Comte and Spencer arranged the sciences in a hierarchy. They assumed gratuitously that the social sciences were somehow less scientific than the physical and biological sciences. Their archaic fallacy still grips many moderns. It involves the further fallacy of explanation by reduc- tion, the attempt to explain something in biology by citing certain laws that hold for physics, or something in sociology by citing physical or biological principles. Social scientists have become self-centered, anthropomorphic, and not a little lazy. They tend too quickly to point out the so-called complexity and difficulty of the social sciences as a convenient alibi for paucity of accomplishment. But these notions are obsolete. There is no qualitative difference whatever between the physical and the social sciences. Each science has its own field and is com- plete within itself; each observes and reasons on a basis of those observations. In each science the workers create causes to explain observed events. The workers next seek to verify those causes-to prove them accountable for the observed phenomena. There is but one method in all science and no science is more difficult or complex than</page><page sequence="12">ALL SCIENCE IS ONE 503 any other. Neither is any one more exact or more capable of de- livering inerrant final conclusions. It is true, however, that workers in physics and biology have shown more tendency to agree upon the use of hypotheses, axioms, specific methods, classification, mathe- matics, and logic, than have workers in the social sciences. This is a real but a very superficial and easily amended difference. The sciences do not differ basically from each other. In all of them, without exception, the forces and phenomena dealt with are infinite in number, complicated, elusive, diverse. In each there must be abstraction with the assumption that certain axioms are true unproved, and that certain factors do not vary or else are negligible in effect. In all of them the scientific worker is himself part and parcel of the material with which he works; the results of the scien- tist's experimentation are invariably affected by his beliefs and his own attitudes are in turn affected by his findings. In all sciences objectivity, exactitude, and certitude are but very relatively attained, and scientific predictions are in any case only true to some more or less close approximation. No science differs categorically from the others. The fallacy of thinking the contrary has long blocked progress in certain sciences. All science is one in method and in human utility.
