PROFESSOR TURCHI has undertaken the Herculean task of writing an account of the religion of ancient Rome from the earliest times to the Christian era within the compass of some 350 pages. He has divided his book into two parts; in the first (Gli Elementi) there is a general survey of the character of Roman religion; the second is a con- secutive history not only of the genuine Roman religion, but of the Greek and Oriental cults, of the mystery reli- gions, and of philosophic thought. This arrangement, though it makes for clarity, has its disadvantages. There is bound to be overlapping and repeti- tion, where space is precious; what is more serious, the treatment of the earliest period up to the Punic Wars is compressed into a short chapter of twenty-four pages (189-202), in which there is little room for the discussion of such vital questions as the possibility of a very early debt to Etruria and Magna Graecia. The whole work too suffers from a dogmatism that arises from lack of space, and assumptions are made without discussion on very controversial problems. Thus it is stated, often without a hint of another view, that the Lar Familiaris was an ancestor- god (p. i6), that Mars was originally an agricultural deity (pp. 30, 165), that Lupercus is derived from lupus and arceo (p. 72), Saturnus from satio (pp. 103, 173), Semo from semen (p. 90o), that the ceremony of the Argei is a rain- charm (p. 150), and that the child of the Fourth Eclogue was the son of Pollio (p. 229). Even in a general sketch some indication is needed that such views are not universally accepted. These defects, though they may be regretted by scholars, are due to the magnitude of the undertaking and are not likely to give the general reader a false impression. And the book has many compensating merits. Turchi's general attitude to his sub- ject might be described as 'eclectic'. He is in the main a follower of the tradition of Mommsen, Warde Fowler, and Wissowa. Though he admits Wis- sowa's limitations in confining himself rigidly to things Roman and refusing the help of comparative religion, he holds, and in my view rightly, that Religion und Kultus 'helps to maintain a firm basis amid the fluctuation of the new currents of interpretation'. He therefore insists constantly on the essen- tially Roman character even of the cults which are known to have been adopted from Greece or the Orient (e.g. Ceres, Liber and Libera (p. 86), whose rites were never Dionysiac, and Magna Mater (p. 85)). On the other hand, though he is prepared to follow Altheim in certain of his views, e.g. on the indi- getes (p. 323) and less certainly on the derivation of Volcanus from the Etrus- can family of the Volcae (p. 96), he rejects him elsewhere (e.g. on the anthropomorphic relationships of the divinity pairs (p. 161)), and thinks that he has not proved 'the preponderant</page><page sequence="2">166 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW dependence of Roman religion on Etruria' (p. 316). Full use is made of recent material, of inscriptions published in the last year or two (e.g. on pp. 235, 236), and of archaeology. Notable here are the illus- tration of the ritual of the Compitalia from the Delos paintings (p. io6), and the suggestion (p. 40) that the pontifices are indeed 'bridge-builders', but that their name goes back to the causeways which connected the 'terremare ' settle- ments with the mainland. In his hand- ling of primitive religious psychology Turchi is judicious and often original. The chapter on magic survivals is valu- able, and so are the suggestions that the fire at the Parilia was a magic rite to increase the heat of the sun (p. 84), that gladiators were exhibited at funeral games that the blood they shed might revive the spirit of the dead (p. 113), and that the Arval Brethren were a secret agricultural association, whose rites were not unlike those of the Greek mysteries (pp. 317 ff.). Particularly good is the explanation of the family rites at birth, marriage, and death as rites de passage (pp. 21 ff.). The historical section of the book is very well done, and throughout it religion is kept in touch with social and political developments. There is perhaps a dis- proportionate description of the period of the Punic Wars, and space could have been spared from it for the earliest epoch. More too should have been made of Augustus' welding of Greek and Roman elements into an admittedly Graeco-Roman religion. An interesting feature of the philosophical chapters is the emphasis placed on Pythagorean- ism, which Turchi believes had more influence at Rome than is usually sup- posed; he regards the Porta Maggiore basilica as definitely a neo-Pythagorean place of worship (pp. 329-32). The book is admirably got up, and the twenty-eight plates give illustra- tions which are well chosen and break away from the ordinary tradition. The appendix giving testimonia from Varro, Festus, etc., is a useful addition. Taken as a whole the book provides a valuable sketch of Roman religion. Though it has not the insight and sympathy of Warde Fowler's Religious Experience, it should take its place among the recognized histories and as a compendious book of reference. CYRIL BAILEY.
