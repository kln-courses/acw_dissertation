<plain_text><page sequence="1">Death, Prestige, and Copper in Bronze Age Cyprus PRISCILLA SCHUSTER KESWANI Abstract From the mid third through the second millennium B.C., Bronze Age communities in Cyprus underwent im- portant social transformations in conjunction with mi- gration, changes in subsistence and technology, the development of a major copper industry, and the emer- gence of town-centered polities engaged in metallurgi- cal production and long-distance trade. This paper examines mortuary evidence from the formative Early- Middle Cypriot Bronze periods (or the prehistoric Bronze Age) in order to explicate the ways in which social changes were expressed in ritual practices and, reflexively, the ways in which economic and sociopolitical developments were influenced by the dynamics of ritual performances. It is demonstrated that an elaborate suite of funerary rites involving multiple phases of mortuary treatment, collective burial, and costly prestige displays developed during these periods. It is argued that because these rites came to involve both extravagant and escalating levels of copper consumption in some communities, the social and ideological concerns enacted in mortuary prac- tice created an important internal stimulus for the in- tensification of copper production and the development of local copper exchange networks. This, in turn, helped promote the development of a provisional infrastructure for the rise of elite-dominated, urban copper emporia during the Late Cypriot Bronze Age. Concurrently, the growing importance of exotic valuables within the pre- vailing prestige system served as an incentive for emer- gent elites to establish coastal centers in order to control the trade in copper and imported goods.* INTRODUCTION In traditional preindustrial societies, the com- memoration of the dead through ritual and symbolic representations such as monuments is frequently a central preoccupation of communal life. Funerals may go beyond fulfilling the practical requirements of disposing of dead bodies and addressing the emotional and social repercussions of death. They may also serve as important occasions for negotiat- ing social hierarchies, affirming social alliances, and expressing (through performance and material sym- bolism) certain sanctified propositions about the relationships between individuals and groups, be- tween groups and their ancestors, and, ultimately, between the ancestors and the order of the cosmos.1 There are complex relationships existing be- tween a social order as represented in mortuary practice and the actual hierarchy of power prevail- ing in contemporary social life. A major tenet of early archaeological forays into mortuary analysis was that the details and relative elaboration of the treatment accorded to the dead would be strongly influenced by the social status and persona of the deceased.2 But the dead do not bury themselves, and while ideologies of death, customary practice, and the specific wishes of the deceased may dictate the broad outline of a funeral, mortuary rites are, in the end, social performances staged by the living. Even as the survivors honor and celebrate the de- ceased, they may also embroider or deny certain dimensions of the dead person's past identity, since the honors accorded to the dead will inevitably re- flect upon the status of the funeral's sponsors.3 Con- sequently, mortuary treatments are not isomorphic representations of the social organization in any specific period of time. Rather, they are expressions of the social order as contemporary human actors have chosen to portray it. Understanding the social structures and cultural meanings associated with ancient mortuary practices is, therefore, strongly contingent upon our knowledge of the broader historical context in which those practices were enacted.4 * I am very grateful to NaomiJ.

Parker Pear- son's (1984) and Cannon's (1989) discussions of cyclical changes in mortuary symbolism emphasize the importance of understand- ing any given mortuary complex in relation to the earlier and later mortuary practices of the society in question. Context also encompasses sociopolitical organization as inferred from inde- pendent, nonmortuary lines of evidence (e.g., the extent to which variations in domestic architecture support or conflict with interpretations of social stratification in funerary data) (Bloch 1971, 112-3; Parker Pearson 1984, 71; Metcalf and Hunting- ton 1991, 110). In addition to these elements of local context, information concerning the regional historical or macroproces- sual context (developments in demography, technology, econ- omy, and sociopolitical environment) helps to elucidate the cultural significance or meaning of specific mortuary practices.

Mortuary ritual is a potentially dynamic cultural fo- rum where living participants may affirm or contest aspects of contemporary social structure; where monuments, cemeteries, and other repositories of social memory5 are subject to continuing reinter- pretation; and where traditional forms of symbol- ism may be perpetually modified as participants create new ways of representing prestige and social identity.6 In turn, the ramifications of mortuary ritual (and of changes in mortuary ritual) may ex- tend far beyond the actual funerals into other realms of social and economic life. Rather than being con- fined to an isolated sphere of cultural activity, ritual actions may produce both intended and unin- tended consequences for sociocultural transforma- tions. This is especially relevant in cases where mortuary rituals are key occasions for the construc- tion of group sociopolitical identities and/or where they involve levels of expenditure that affect the larger economy. Although incomplete and imperfect in many re- spects, the mortuary record of Bronze Age Cyprus is nonetheless a rich source for insight into how Cypriot communities constituted their social life in the midst of ongoing cultural change. In this paper, I focus on evidence from the prehistoric Bronze Age, encompassing the Philia fades7 and the Early-Middle Cypriot (EC-MC) periods (see table 1 for chronology), when traditional modes of subsistence production and economy were trans- formed by the introduction of a cattle-and-plow complex, related elements of the secondary prod- ucts revolution, the spread of copper metallurgy, and other technological innovations. These devel- opments may have been associated in part with epi- sodes of colonization from the Anatolian mainland, a phenomenon that, in and of itself, would have created a more complex social landscape on the island.8 In conjunction with these changes, a dis- tinctive complex of mortuary ritual emerged and became progressively elaborated, involving the use of extramural cemeteries, rock-cut chamber tombs and pit tombs, secondary treatment and collective burial, and substantial outlays in material display. The related funerary celebrations, in which the dead were transformed into powerful immortal ancestors, must also have served as important occa- sions for the negotiation of social prestige, the ex- pression of social identity, and the creation or reaffirmation of social alliances between the groups participating in the rituals. Consequently, in the course of mortuary rituals, the social relationships among individuals in the living community and be- tween communities in the larger social landscape could have been periodically realigned.9 The dynamics of mortuary practices taking place in the EC-MC Bronze Age may have held a further potential for social transformation because they sometimes involved the disposal of large quanti- ties of copper-based artifacts10 and small quantities of imported prestige goods in the tombs of the dead. Because mortuary rites entailed both extrava- gant and escalating levels of copper consumption 5 On mortuary practices and social memory, see Hendon 2000; Chesson 2001; Silverman and Small 2002. 6 E.g., escalating status competition may lead to the even- tual rejection of traditional prestige symbols and the innova- tion of new forms, as discussed by Parker Pearson (1984; Cannon 1989 (see supra n. 4) . For examples of the reinterpre- tation of ongoing traditional practices under changing politi- cal conditions, see Bloch 1971; Kus and Raharijaona 2001. 7 This terminology is used in Webb and Frankel (1999) to characterize mid third millennium archaeological occurrences accompanied by Philia-type ceramics. Philia sites are found in the northwestern, southwestern, and central parts of the is- land, and are thought to represent a wave of colonization from southwestern Anatolia. The Philia facies is dated from approxi- mately 2500 B.C. to 2350 B.C. (Knapp 1994a, fig. 1; Webb and Frankel 1999, 5-7). While some temporal overlap of Philia material culture with Late Chalcolithic assemblages may be postulated, the expression "Philia phase" is also used here some- times for convenience as a chronological designation. 8 On the evidence and arguments for colonization and re- lated cultural and technological changes, see Frankel et al. 1996; Webb and Frankel 1999; for a dissenting view, see Knapp 2001. For general discussions of changes in subsistence, settle- ment organization, and material culture, see Swiny 1989; Knapp 1990. 9Yaeger and Canuto (2000, 4) have criticized the simplistic equation of "community" with the archaeological site. In the context of the present discussion, it seems appropriate to use their definition of community: "an ever-emergent social insti- tution that generates and is generated by supra-household interactions that are structured and synchronized by a set of places within a particular span of time" and whose members share "premises or understandings, which can be mobilized in the development of common community identities" (Yaeger and Canuto 2000, 5-6). 10 Compositional analyses have shown that tin-bronzes oc- curred infrequently in Cyprus prior to the Late Cypriot period (Swiny 1982; Balthazar 1990; Gale etal. 1996). The vast major- ity of the metal finds from earlier settlement and cemetery contexts were made from either unalloyed copper or arseni- cal-copper (deriving from impurities in the ore or alloying prac- tices) . Consequently, most of the metal objects discussed here are referred to as copper or copper-based artifacts.</page><page sequence="3">2005] DEATH, PRESTIGE, AND COPPER IN BRONZE AGE CYPRUS 343 Table 1 .

This would have contributed to the devel- opment of a provisional infrastructure for the rise of elite-dominated, urban copper emporia during the Late Cypriot Bronze Age. In addition, the grow- ing importance of exotic valuables within the pre- vailing system of prestige symbolism would have served as an incentive for emergent elites to estab- lish coastal centers in order to control the trade in copper and imported goods.11 INTERPRETING THE MORTUARY RECORD: METHODOLOGICAL AND SAMPLING CONCERNS Interpreting the mortuary record is a complicated task. The material remains of mortuary practices of- fer a ritualized expression of social structure and ideology; they present a partial, filtered view rather than a clear and extensive panorama. On top of this, many elements of funerary ritual (feasts, processions, songs, and dances) may not be archaeologically vis- ible, and some practices may even be destructive vis- a-vis the remains of the dead. Those practices that are "materialized" and amenable to archaeological preservation may be subjected to a variety of natural and cultural post-depositional processes that trans- form their representation in the archaeological record. The deficiencies of sampling, excavation methods, analytical studies, and reporting standards place further limitations on the conclusions that may be drawn from mortuary evidence. It is therefore im- portant to establish at the outset "what portion of the total funerary system is being observed" and the types of questions that can and cannot be addressed with the available evidence.12 In Cyprus, the most common mortuary features of the Philia facies and the EC-MC periods are pit and chamber tombs cut through a hard, white, sec- ondary limestone subsoil known locally as havara or kafkalla\ pit tombs were also occasionally dug in a softer matrix of earth and stony conglomerate.13 Frequently throughout the island, mortuary fea- tures have been damaged or disturbed by ancient and modern looting activities, later building projects, and various environmental processes, 11 For general discussions of the urbanization process, met- allurgy, and trade during the Late Cypriot period, see Muhly 1982, 1986, 1989, 1991; Knapp 1986a, 1986b, 1988, 1994b, 1996a, 1997; Keswani 1989a, 1993, 1996, 2004; Peltenburg 1996.

For a detailed discussion of these issues in the Cypriot case, see Keswani 1989b, 38-43, 86-98; 2004, 22- 35. 13 Regardless of their matrix, pit tombs tend to be relatively small, simple in plan, and are usually entered from the top rather than via an entrance tunnel or dromos; the shallower forms are sometimes referred to as pit graves. In some instances, their form may have been dictated by the constraints of the local geology, although ground suitable for cutting larger chamber tombs was sometimes located nearby, as was the case at Nicosia Ayia Paraskevi (Stewart 1962a, 322; Georgiou 2002, 62) . Where pit tombs or graves occur in proximity to contemporaneous chamber tombs of more elaborate construction, they may be- long to a different phase of the ritual system, as discussed fur- ther on in the text.

Even in the case of tombs found intact or substantially preserved, burial treatments are often difficult to reconstruct. The majority of tombs were used for multiple buri- als; thus whenever a tomb was opened to insert new burials, the remains of earlier burials were subject to potential displacement, disarticulation, or other physical damage, and the associations between individuals and particular grave goods were often disrupted. Certain types of valuable grave goods (e.g., metal items) may also have been removed from time to time.14 Because the treat- ment of specific individuals has so often been ob- scured by burial disarrangements, the focus of analysis must shift from the comparison of indi- vidual burials to the overall study of differences between tomb groups and the associated histories of tomb use.15 The interpretation of Cypriot burial remains is rendered even more problematic by the historical circumstances of their recovery. Several important prehistoric Bronze Age cemeteries located within or adjacent to the copper-rich zones of the Troodos, including those of Politiko, Nicosia Ayia Paraskevi, and Alambra (fig. 1), are known mainly from the work of the late 19th-century excavators Cesnola and Ohnefalsch-Richter, who were mostly con- cerned with obtaining examples of fine pottery, metals, and other valuables for museums and pri- vate collections. Needless to say, they paid little at- tention to details of tomb architecture, burial stratigraphy, the placement and condition of hu- man skeletal remains, or associations between buri- als and goods. Only small selections of their finds were published.16 Although recorded in somewhat more detail, other early excavations (such as those undertaken at Katydhata, Arpera, and Kalopsidha) were similarly compromised by the limitations of the prevailing excavation techniques and objectives of archaeological research.17 As a result, much in- formation concerning the mortuary practices en- acted in the aforementioned cemeteries has simply been lost. Although the standards of excavation and report- ing improved over the course of the 20th century, until quite recently, the recovery and description of grave goods continued to be prioritized over human skeletal remains and their depositional con- texts. In the absence of systematic osteological analy- ses from most excavated cemeteries, our knowledge of tomb demographics, age- and gender-based burial treatments, and details of human health and life expectancy is extremely limited.18 However, evidence from the few osteological studies that have been undertaken, in conjunction with the infer- ences that may be drawn from older excavation re- ports, does indicate that infants and children are highly underrepresented in the EC-MC mortuary sample; this suggests that their mortuary treatment may sometimes have differed from that of adults.19 It is clear within the existing samples of adult buri- als that both males and females are represented, but the extent of gender biases, or combined age and gender biases in mortuary practice, is un- 14 Some of these disturbances may have been "accidents" in the course of making room for later burials, while others may represent secondary phases of mortuary treatment in- volving the deliberate rearrangement or partial removal of earlier burials. Where it is possible to distinguish these prac- tices from one another and from much later looting activi- ties, the disturbances themselves may offer evidence for mortuary rituals, ideologies, and even economic circumstances (when grave goods are removed, returned to circulation, or cached) . 15 These problems are discussed in Chapman 1977, 26; 1981a, 398, 406. 16E.g., Cesnola 1877; Ohnefalsch-Richter 1893. For an his- torical account of early excavations, see Goring 1988. 17Myres 1897; Gjerstad 1926; Astrom 1989. 18 Positive exceptions to this statement for the Philia fa- des and EC-MC periods include the studies of skeletal mate- rial from excavations in the Kalavasos area (e.g., Moyer in Todd 1985; Schulte-Campbell 1986) and at Alambra Mouttes (Cole- man 1996; Domurad 1996) , Marki Alonia (Frankel and Webb 1997, 1999; Moyer 1997) , and Sotira Kaminoudhia (Schulte- Campbell 2003; Swiny et al. 2003). 19 In preindustrial populations, infants and young children may account for as much as 50% of all deaths (Acsadi and Nemeskeri 1970; Weiss 1972). AtBellapaisVounousandLap- ithos Vrysi tou Barba, they amount to roughly 5%-6% of the minimum number of burials reported by the excavators. Recent studies of skeletal samples from Kalavasos (Schulte- Campbell 1986), Alambra (Domurad 1996), and Sotira Ka- minoudhia (Schulte-Campbell 2003) reveal a similar under- representation of the very young. A different picture emerg- es from recent excavations at Dhenia Kafkalla, where fine mesh sieving resulted in the recovery of a much higher pro- portion of infant remains (J.M. Webb, pers. comm. 2005). It is possible that some infants and children were exposed or placed in abandoned settlement contexts, as some recent examples from Marki Alonia suggest (Frankel and Webb 1997, 88; 1999, 90; Moyer 1997, 115). Others may have been buried or stored in pithoi, as was the case with some Philia burials at Kissonerga Mosphilia (Peltenburg et al. 1998, 72) and Marki Alonia (Frankel and Webb 2000, 764) . It is con- ceivable that some EC pithos burials were redeposited in chamber tombs at Lapithos Vrysi tou Barba (see infra n. 32) . The latter site also affords some of the earliest examples of the use of "dromos cupboards" (very small chambers or cut- tings in the dromos walls) for child burials (Herscher 1978, 703-4).</page><page sequence="5">2005] DEATH, PRESTIGE, AND COPPER IN BRONZE AGE CYPRUS 345 1-i a. 4 CD O -s •* ^ N a?

Other interpretive problems arise from past as- sumptions concerning the general program of mor- tuary practice in the prehistoric Bronze Age. Many excavators have taken for granted that all or most of the burials in a tomb occurred as sequential primary interments. Consequently, signs of skeletal disarticu- lation and/or the incomplete representation of body parts have usually been attributed to the effects of tomb reuse, looting, or flooding, rather than to pos- sible ritual practice.21 In some cases, however, the description of burial remains is in fact detailed enough to permit identification of anomalies in bone preservation, articulation, representation, and arrangement that may be attributable to secondary treatment or other ritual practices. Evidence for the emptying of primary burial features (pit graves, tombs, dromos cupboards, and storage jars), along with the chronology and stratification of bones and grave goods in other tombs, further attest to the practice of complex ritual programs.22 The frequen- cies of such practices are difficult to determine, unfortunately, given the blurring effects of tomb reuse, post-depositional processes, and the meth- ods of archaeological investigation. Regional sampling biases of well-preserved and well-reported mortuary complexes also place limi- tations on the conclusions that may be drawn. The EC-MC mortuary sample is dominated by the ex- tensively excavated and relatively well-published cemeteries of Bellapais Vounous and Lapithos Vrysi tou Barba, both located on the north coast of Cyprus. It is inevitable that interpretations of funerary ritual and social structure will therefore be dominated by the trends observed at those sites, although the prac- tices of communities in other regions may have dif- fered from these to some degree. Fortunately, de- spite the geographical skewing of samples in vari- ous time periods, the results of smaller scale excavations at other sites located throughout the island can be used to help define and compare the mortuary practices of different regions. However, the assessment of local variability in these smaller samples is precluded. The deficiencies of the Cypriot mortuary sample have not been lost upon past researchers attempt- ing to analyze prehistoric Bronze Age funerary data.23 Yet in spite of the problems outlined above, there are nevertheless many insights to be garnered from the existing data. The outlines of a ritual sys- tem that sometimes included secondary treatment and collective burial may be discerned in the evi- dence from a number of sites. Variations in the dis- tribution of prestige goods within and between sites can be observed and interpreted, and important long-term changes in patterns of mortuary expen- diture can be defined. In the remaining portion of this paper, I examine the development of ritual programs during the EC-MC periods, the prestige displays associated with those funerary rites, and the ramifications of changing mortuary practices for broader cultural change. THE ORIGINS AND IDEOLOGY OF MORTUARY PRACTICES IN THE EARLY-MIDDLE CYPRIOT PERIODS The defining characteristics of EC-MC mortu- ary practices include the use of extramural cem- eteries of rock-cut chamber tombs and pit tombs (forms illustrated in fig. 2), the reuse of tombs for multiple primary and secondary burials, and the regular deposition of grave goods with the dead. These attributes appear to be distinctive - if not entirely unprecedented - when contrasted with prior Chalcolithic traditions, particularly those of Lemba Lakkous24 and Kissonerga Mosphilia,25 the 20 Analyses of small samples of crania from excavations at the EC-MC sites of Bellapais Vounous (Stewart and Stewart 1950, 374) and Lapithos Vrysi tou Barba (Fischer 1986, table 2; see also Fiirst 1933, 58) suggest a possible bias toward the inclu- sion of males more often than females; however, if the indi- viduals that could not be sexed with certainty were in fact fe- male, the imbalance in numbers is relatively slight. Another small sample from excavations at Alambra Mouttes reportedly contained either four or five males and two or three females (Coleman 1996, 116-23; Domurad 1996, 515-8). A contrast- ing pattern is evident in samples from Kalavasos and Sotira Ka- minoudhia, where females were more numerous than males among the individuals that could be sexed (Schulte-Campbell 1986, 2003). Frankel and Webb (1999, 90) suggest that adult females may sometimes have been disposed of in abandoned building contexts. 21 The possibility of secondary treatment of the dead has rarely been recognized. Cassimatis (1973) does not discuss it, and Webb (1992, 88 nn. 2, 3) contends that it did not occur, except possibly in the act of sweeping older burials aside. One important recognition of the practice does occur in the Swed- ish Cyprus Expedition's (Gjerstad et al. 1934) account of the cemetery at Korovia Paleoskoutella (see further discussion lat- er in the text) . 22 See Keswani (1989b, 87-91; 2004, 31-5) for a discussion of the methodology of reconstructing; burial programs. 23 Bright 1995; Baxevani 1997; Davies 1997; Sneddon 2002. 24Peltenburgetal. 1985. 25Peltenburgetal. 1998.</page><page sequence="7">2005] DEATH, PRESTIGE, AND COPPER IN BRONZE AGE CYPRUS 347 Fig. 2.

Prior to the Late Chalcolithic period, the most common burial treatment for adults at these sites was a single pit grave interment located within a settlement area. Adult burials were rarely accompanied by preserved grave goods, al- though infants and children were sometimes bur- ied with picrolite pendants and other exotic items.26 However, the Middle Chalcolithic extramural cem- eteries of Souskiou Vathyrkakas and Laonas, 20 km to the east of Lemba and Kissonerga, suggest local precedents for several elements of EC-MC funerary rites. Multiple individuals of mixed ages, some of whom may have been subjected to secondary treat- ment, were interred at these two sites in bottle- shaped, rock-cut tombs and were accompanied by diverse arrays of ceramics and ornaments made of bone, shell, copper, and picrolite.27 While at present the Souskiou mortuary complex appears excep- tional for the Chalcolithic period, it is possible that the use of extramural cemeteries and the practice of such elaborate mortuary rites were more com- mon in that era than is currently recognized.28 Important changes in burial practice seem to have been under way at Kissonerga Mosphilia by the Late Chalcolithic period, when the use of chamber tombs for the burial of two or more individuals first becomes apparent.29 The occurrence of Philia-type pottery with these burials raises the possibility that such prac- tices were intrusive, possibly associated with the ar- rival of colonists from Cilicia or other parts of Anatolia.30 Although clear parallels for the entire complex of Philia and EC-MC burial practices have yet to be defined in southwestern Anatolia (the pro- posed heartland of the immigration movement) , the use of extramural cemeteries was quite common in mainland areas. In addition, secondary treatment and collective burial seem to have been well-estab- lished mortuary practices in Syria and adjacent re- gions of the Levant in the third millennium.31 The use of pithoi as burial containers, noted in some Philia and possibly in some EC tombs, is also a dis- tinctive characteristic of many Anatolian cemeter- ies.32 It is therefore probable that the forms and practices of EC-MC mortuary ritual had a dual ori- gin, as the heritage of immigrants blended with the traditions of local communities in an emerging ma- trix of affiliative and competitive social interactions. One of the hallmarks of EC- MC mortuary ritual is the use of extramural or spatially separate cem- eteries, usually located at least a few hundred meters from the habitation areas of the living com- munity. This practice contrasts sharply with the in- termingling of tombs and houses seen in both earlier and later periods of Cypriot antiquity.33 Some burial sites seem to have been small clusters of tombs probably used by a few closely related kin or resi- dential groups, while others appear to be far more extensive: the Philia period cemetery at Vasilia Kafkallia reportedly extended over at least a mile,34 while the Philia EC-MC site at Dhenia Kafkalla has been described as "a vast necropolis," whose size "proclaims it the cemetery of a prominent settle- ment - unless, indeed, it was the sacred burial ground of a province."35 Some settlements may have used multiple burial locations either simultaneously or sequentially throughout the course of their oc- cupations.36 Tombs were cut in a variety of topo- graphical settings, often along ridges and hillsides or in low-lying areas visible from nearby settlements.

( 1 998, 85 ) suggest that many of the adults residing at Kissonerga Mosphilia in period 3b (equated with the Middle Chalcolithic) may also have been buried off-site, possibly at Souskiou. *y Peltenburg et al. 1998, 70. 30 Peltenburg 1991, 30; Peltenburg et al. 1998, 90-2. 31 E.g., Carter and Parker 1995, 110; Chesson 1999; Porter 2002; for much earlier examples, see Wright 1978; Byrd and Monahan 1995. 32 For examples of pithos burials in Early Bronze Age Anatolia, see Wheeler 1974; Carter and Parker 1995.

The intro- duction of plow agriculture would almost certainly have been accompanied by patterns of wealth accu- mulation and transmission that differed signifi- cantly from those of the Chalcolithic era, when hoe cultivation was prevalent.38 As the establishment of households became ever more dependent on the inheritance of farmland, draft animals, and other forms of property, the ideological importance of ties to the ancestors would have been considerable; making permanent memorials or homes for the dead in publicly visible spaces could have been one expression of this concern. Additionally, increas- ing populations, the larger land areas required for plow cultivation and cattle pasturage, and the in- herent complexities of a social landscape shaped by periodic migrations may have contributed to a perception of land scarcity and a growing empha- sis on social boundaries or group membership.39 In such a context, burial areas may well have served as reference points by which both indigenous and immigrant communities could affirm their social identities and their ancestral rights to the land.40 The ongoing importance of "ancestors" 41 in the ideological world of prehistoric Bronze Age com- munities is substantiated by other lines of mortuary evidence. For example, while most of the pit and chamber tombs of the Philia facies and the EC pe- riod were fairly simple in form,42 there are several key instances of architectural embellishment that suggest tombs were viewed as shrines for the ances- tors rather than mere repositories of the dead. At the ECI Vounous site A, tombs 114, 116, and 117 have entrances with carved facades depicting verti- cal uprights and horizontal lintels, which may have been similar to those that framed doorways in settle- ment architecture.43 Other decorated tomb facades have been found at Lapithos Vrysi tou Barba, 44 Vasilia Kafkallia, 45 and Karmi Palealona.46 Vertical panels carved in the dromos of tomb 6 at Karmi have elic- ited comparisons with the unprovenienced cera- mic "shrine" models from Kotchati and Kalopsidha in central and eastern Cyprus.47 The two well- preserved models from Kotchati (one of which is illustrated in fig. 3) show a woman standing beside an amphora in front of a structure with three verti- cal uprights surmounted by bull heads.48 Addition- ally, in the dromos of tomb 6 at Karmi, a human is cut in bas-relief; this may be a representation of the dead or a portrayal of a person paying homage to the ancestors.49 The stylized and sexually ambigu- ous anthropomorphic figurines known as plank idols sometimes found in tombs of later EC and MC date (see examples in fig. 4) may also repre- sent generic ancestor images.50 Whether the Kotchati models represent homage being made to the dead (in the form of libations or other gifts) , reverence to a divinity of fertility (sym- bolized by the bulls' heads), or other cultural phe- nomena remains a matter for speculation.51 What is perhaps most significant is that certain tombs were constructed to resemble places where offerings were made. As the dead received grave goods and animal sacrifices in the course of their funerary 37 As Webb (1992, 94) suggests, some above-ground markers may have been destroyed as a result of erosion and plowing. 38 On the socioeconomic transformations associated with the shift from hoe- to plow-based agriculture, see Boserup 1970; Goody 1976; Sherratt 1981; Knapp 1990; Bogucki 1993. The use of cattle as draft animals is well attested in ceramic repre- sentations of plowing scenes from Bellapais Vounous (Dikaios 1940, pls. 9, 10, 18; see also fig. 5 in the text). 39 The development of social boundaries is suggested by the rise of diverse regional ceramic traditions (Frankel 1974; Her- scher 1976, 1981, 1991). 40 Goldstein 1976, 1981; Renfrew 1976; Chapman 1981a, 1981b, 1995; Charles 1995. 41 See Whitley (2002) for a critique of archaeological invo- cations of the ancestors. 42 The chamber tombs of Vasilia Kafkallia, with their rectan- gular chambers, pillar-like buttresses, rectangular wall niches, and lime-plastered dromoi up to eight meters in length, are important exceptions to this (Stewart 1957, 1962a, figs. 86- 87; Hennessy et al. 1988, figs. 33, 81, 37, 40). 43 Stewart 1939a; Stewart and Stewart 1950, 152, figs. 111- 112; 158, figs. 120, 124b; 162-3, fig. 123. 44Herscher 1978, 705 and n. 14. ™ Stewart 19b2a, 21b. 46 Stewart 1962b, 197; Astrom 1988, fi^s. 3, 4. 47 Frankel and Tamvaki 1973. 48Karageorghis 1970; 1991,142-3, pls. 102:2-3, 103:1-2. 49 Karageorghis (1977, 44) interprets the figure as a repre- sentation of the Cypriot mother goddess. 50 The flat rectangular figurines referred to as plank idols have often been viewed as representations of females (Gjer- stad etal. 1934; Myres 1940-1945, 81-4) , butTalalay and Cullen (2002) have recently interpreted them as generic ancestor figures of ambiguous gender. One such figurine from Swedish tomb 322D was made of marble rather than clay (Gjerstad et al. 1934, 150, cat. 2) . Plank idols are most plentiful at Lapithos but are also found in smaller numbers at Vounous B, Dhenia Kafkalla, Nicosia Ayia Paraskevi, Alambra Mouttes, and Politiko (ACampo 1994, 199-208). 51 See Astrom (1988) for a review of the various interpreta- tions and related bibliography.</page><page sequence="10">350 PRISCILLA SCHUSTER KESWANI [AJA109 Fig. 3.

(After Karageorghis 1970, pl. 1; 1991, pl. 102:2) celebrations, and occasionally subsequent offerings were placed in the tomb dromos,52 it is probable that they were venerated as powerful entities. Such honorific treatment may not only have legitimized the rights of succession and social status claimed by the sponsors of their funerals, it may also have been deemed essential in securing the fertility and prosperity of the living. The inclusion in EC-MC tombs of ceramic models and pottery vessels with coroplastic genre scenes depicting agricultural scenes (fig. 5), food-processing activities, and im- ages relating to human reproduction (women hold- ing babies, embracing couples, men and women in bed together) may be an indication of the interme- diary role ancestors played in ensuring the well- being of their descendants.53 A further indication of the social and ideological importance with which the ancestors were invested is the development of practices involving secondary treatment of the dead. Mortuary systems involving "dual obsequies" have been recognized in ethno- graphic, ethnohistorical, and archaeological stud- ies of societies from North America and Europe to Indonesia and Madagascar. As first defined by Hertz,54 these mortuary complexes usually involve an initial phase that emphasizes the individuality of the corpse, the pollution and deterioration of the flesh, and the separation or removal of the deceased from the society of the living. This is followed by a liminal or transitional period and then by a terminal celebration in which the predominant themes are the purification of the deceased, his or her reunion with the immortal ancestors, the reproduction of the living society, and the end of mourning. The transi- tional period between the primary and secondary funerals allows the corpse to undergo the transfor- mation from perishable flesh to immutable bone or spirit, and effects a distancing between the actual social persona of the deceased and her/his role as an ancestral spirit.55 This period between death and the final ceremonies may also shift the focus of sec- ondary rituals from the mourning of the deceased to the political interests of the living; these interests often center on assertions of social prestige and the negotiation or renegotiation of social alliances jeop- ardized by an individual's death. Furthermore, the 52 See Stewart 1962a, 294; Hennessy et al. 1988, 25, 38; ceramic items were deposited in some dromoi at Vounous; pottery and copper objects were found in the dromoi at Vasilia Kafkallia. 53 A plowing scene is illustrated in fig. 5. For illustrations of various scenes probably related to breadmaking, see Kara- georghis 1991, pls. 72-84; for plank figures holding infants, see fig. 4c here and Karageorghis 1991, pls. 44-47; for scenes of couples, see Gjerstad etal. 1934, pl. 148:5; Dikaios 1940, pl. 35:a; Morris 1985, figs. 506-507. It should be noted that two of the ostensible bread-making scenes alluded to above have been subject to an alternative interpretation. In the wake of Koucky's and Steinberg's (1982) highly controversial argument for the practice of hydrometallurgy in Bronze Age Cyprus, Merrillees (1984, 11) suggested that the coroplastic genre scene on the unprovenienced Red Polished (RP) III Sevres Jar might actually represent the leaching of copper ores (see also Morris 1985, 280-1 ) . This metallurgical interpretation has also been extended to the unprovenienced Oxford Bowl (Mor- ris 1985, 273-4), and to the large RPI cutaway spout jug from Bellapais Vounous, site A, tomb 164A (no. 45, see fig. 6n). Incised, dot-filled circles on the latter object are interpreted by Morris (1985, fig. 487) as copper-leaching structures. How- ever, the viability of hydrometallurgy for extracting copper from the sulfide ores found in Cyprus, and/or the likelihood of its ever having been practiced on any significant scale, has been repeatedly challenged (Constantinou 1982, 22; Muhly 1986, 52-3; Given and Knapp 2003, 69). 54 Hertz 1960 (originally published in 1907). 55Bloch 1982, 223-4; Kan 1989, 289.</page><page sequence="11">2005] DEATH, PRESTIGE, AND COPPER IN BRONZE AGE CYPRUS 351 Fig. 4.

(Stewart 1962a, figs. 92:2, 92:3, 94:2, respectively) staging of a secondary funeral usually allows the heirs the time to amass considerably more resources (man- power and material for the construction of monu- ments, food for feasting, gifts for distribution to the living or for disposal with the dead) than may be available at the actual time of a death, thus facilitat- ing higher levels of consumption in the hospitality accorded to guests and in prestige-related treat- ments of the deceased.56 It appears that dual obse- quies entailing the exhumation and subsequent reinterment of one or more individuals in chamber or pit tombs occasionally took place in Cyprus dur- ing the EC period, and that these practices became more elaborate through time. The Evidence for Secondary Burial Practices in the Early-Middle Cypriot Bronze Age As noted above, most interpretations of prehis- toric Bronze Age mortuary data reflect the assump- tion that all burials were primary inhumations, with subsequent episodes of tomb reuse, looting, flood- ing, and other post-depositional processes being responsible for poor preservation and disarticula- tion of skeletal remains. Although in many instances this assumption is probably correct, there are a sig- nificant number of cases throughout the island where the condition of the burial remains and/or related burial features cannot be explained with- out reference to more complex ritual activities. The most extensive evidence for EC mortuary prac- tice comes from the north coast cemetery of Bellapais Vounous, where, during the 1930s, 164 tomb com- plexes were excavated in two discrete areas, known as site A (with tombs dating almost exclusively to ECI) and site B (with tombs dating mostly from ECII- MCII).57 At site A, approximately two-thirds of the in situ burials were placed in flexed positions on their left sides; many of these burials seem to have been articulated and were probably primary inhumations. At site B, all but a few of the articulated burials were laid out in dorsal positions, some with both legs ex- tended and others with one or both legs flexed. Many of these may also represent primary inhumations; however, the skeletal remains from several tombs at 56Metcalf 1982; Metcalf and Huntington 1991. 57 Excavations were conducted by Dikaios in 1931-1932 (Di- kaios 1940), Schaeffer in 1933 (Schaeffer 1936; Merrillees 1988; Dunn-Vaturi 2003), and Stewart and Stewart in 1937- 1938 (Stewart and Stewart 1950). For tomb chronology, see Stewart 1962a, 387-9; Dunn-Vaturi 2003. Roughly 107 of these chambers appear to have been intact.</page><page sequence="12">352 PRISCILLA SCHUSTER KESWANI [AJA109 Fig. 5. A ceramic model of a plowing scene from an unnumbered tomb (special series 1) at Bellapais Vounous, site B. Height 19 cm. (After Dikaios 1940, pls. 9, 10:a) both sites attest to other ritual treatments. In some cases, individuals were represented mainly by skulls; few if any postcranial parts were present; 58 in other instances, simultaneous, possibly secondary burials had taken place.59 In addition, deliberate disarticu- lation and rearrangement of body parts was some- times apparent. In tomb 164A at Vounous A, for example, two largely complete skeletons were found with their skulls curiously repositioned in front of the bodies, most likely in the course of pre- or post- interment rituals.60 In Vounous B tomb 36, an un- usually large burial group of nine individuals was found, all apparently disarticulated, with the excep- tion of a single, seemingly in situ, skeleton found beneath many pots in the lower stratum of the burial deposits.61 It is possible that the disarticulated buri- als in this tomb represent multiple secondary inter- ments introduced after a primary inhumation. Multiple sequential or simultaneous secondary in- terments may also have occurred in Vounous B tomb 143, where eight skulls and scanty postcranial re- mains were noted.62 Other ritual practices involving the deliberate rearrangement of disarticulated bones may be represented in Dikaios' tomb 31, where three skeletons were reportedly found decomposed and disorderly, one in the southwest and the others toward the front of the tomb. Their positions were unclear because, according to Dikaios, "most of the long bones were found grouped together." 63 The evidence from both Vounous A and B sug- gests that a program of secondary treatment, plac- ing special emphasis on the manipulation and curation of the skull, was practiced for at least some individuals. Secondary treatment sometimes seems to have been associated with individuals who were provided with large tombs and outstanding assem- 58 At Vounous A, see tombs 82B, 118, 153 (Stewart and Stew- art 1950, 55, 164, 186). At Vounous B, see tombs 44, 50a, 125, 141, 143, 146, 156 (Dikaios 1940, 88; Stewart and Stewart 1950, 264, 317, 324, 328, 346, 357-8, fig. 242; Dunn-Vaturi 2003, 5) . In some of these cases, it might be argued that postcranial remains had been removed to make room for additional buri- als, leaving only the skulls of earlier burials behind. However, there are several instances (e.g., tombs 82B, 125, 141, 146, 156) where one or two skulls were the only skeletal remains found in the chamber, and these probably represent second- ary burials in which the skull was the focus of the ceremonies. 59 See Vounous A tombs 84 and 90 (Stewart and Stewart 1950, 68, 94). Unless the pairs of individuals buried in these tombs died at the same time, at least one member of each pair must have been removed from some form of primary storage and reburied with the other individual. 60 Stewart and Stewart 1950, 226-7, fie. 165. 61 Dikaios 1940, 72-4. 62 Stewart and Stewart 1950, 324, 328, fig. 242.

This tomb had the largest chamber floor area ob- served at Vounous A,64 and contained an impres- sive assemblage of grave goods, including a "cult vessel," a ceramic horn, considerable quantities of ox bones, and four copper knives (figs. 6, 7a, 8a).65 Similarly, tomb 36 at Vounous B contained a diverse array of ceramic items, including two horns, a ring vase, and several vessels with modeled bull heads, snakes, birds, and horned animals, as well as a large part of an ox skeleton and other faunal remains.66 Tomb 143 at Vounous B yielded 11 copper-based artifacts, two kernoi and a stemmed bowl, the re- mains of sheep or goat, and an unusual stone axe amulet (fig. 8f).67 However, not all cases of osten- sible secondary treatment were associated with elaborate tomb construction or distinctive concen- trations of metal objects and other valuable grave goods, as is evident in the cases of site A, tomb 82B, and site B, tombs 31, 44, 125, 141, and 146.68 It is possible that some individuals received multiple stages of mortuary treatment regardless of their wealth and prestige (or that of their kin) relative to other members of the community. The north coast cemetery of Lapithos Vrysi tou Barba is located approximately 20 km to the west of Bellapais Vounous, and was used during the ECII- MCIII periods (with tombs overlapping and slightly postdating those of Vounous B) ,69 Despite the ef- fects of flooding and tomb reuse, the burials pre- served in the Lapithos tombs reveal a considerable diversity of mortuary practices. The majority of the individuals whose postures could be determined seem to have been interred in lateral flexed or con- tracted positions, with roughly equal numbers placed on the right and left sides. A few dorsal buri- als with legs flexed and burials in squatting posi- tions were also noted.70 As at Vounous, many of these burials were probably primary interments, but sec- ondary treatment was clearly practiced here as well; this is evident from the deliberate disarticulation and/or incomplete representation of the skeletal remains in cases where post-depositional distur- bances cannot satisfactorily explain their condi- tion.71 In contrast to the situation at Vounous, where all of the mortuary features seem to represent the final phase of mortuary processing for the de- ceased, Lapithos burial features represent both the preliminary and final phases of mortuary treatment and ritual. A series of shallow rectangular features in regular rows, found in the western area of the Pennsylvania excavations, may represent the use of pit graves for primary interments. These pits were sometimes cut by the dromoi of later chamber tombs after having been covered with a layer of soil for at least a few years; it is possible that the original pit burials were exhumed and subsequently reburied in these chamber tombs.72 Another preliminary form of mortuary treatment, perhaps particularly (but not exclusively) used for younger individuals, entailed the storage of the body in a pithos that was later broken and partially reinterred in a chamber tomb.73 Infant burials in dromos cupboards may also have been exhumed and reinterred in the larger 64 The chamber floor was approximately 8.5 m2 in area, as calculated from the published plan (Stewart and Stewart 1950, 227, fig. 165). The mean chamber floor area for tombs at Vounous A was 3.7 m2, with a standard deviation of 1.7 and a range of 1.0-8.5 m2 (n=44). 65 Stewart and Stewart 1950, 228, 230-7. 66Dikaios 1940, 72-6. 67 Stewart and Stewart 1950, 327-36.

Subsequently, a total of 61 multi-chambered tomb com- plexes were excavated by the Swedish Cyprus Expedition in 1927-1928 (Gjerstad et al. 1934) and the University of Penn- sylvania expedition in 1931-1932 (Grace 1940; Herscher 1975, 1978) . Approximately 96 individual chambers from the latter two projects were either intact or substantially preserved. 70 Gjerstad et al. 1934, 72; Myres 1940-1945, 79-80; Her- scher 1978, 786 and n. 23. 71 Examples include Swedish tomb 302B, where four burials were found in disarticulated or partly disarticulated bone piles in different parts of the chamber (Gjerstad et al. 1934, 42); Swedish tomb 306A, where a single individual represented only by fragments of the head, neck, and arms was observed (Gjer- stad et al. 1934, 60); and Swedish tomb 312A, where one of two individuals present was only represented by fragments of the vertebral column (Gjerstad et al. 1934, 84, 77, fig. 37:7). In other cases, such as Swedish tomb 322A (Gjerstad etal. 1934, 147-56) and Pennsylvania tombs 809A, 812A, 813B, 818, and 826B (Herscher 1978), where the skeletal remains of two or more individuals were found in extremely variable states of pres- ervation, it is possible that the incompletely preserved remains had also been subjected to some form of secondary treatment. 72Herscher (1978, 818-9) noted that the cuttings were large enough to have served as shallow pit graves for contracted buri- als, but because they were all found empty, she concluded that they were agricultural. Apian showing the spatial relationship between the pit graves and chamber tombs can be seen in Herscher 1975. 73 In several tombs, fragmentary skeletal remains were found lying on top of or mixed up with pithos sherds; the sherds were sometimes embedded in the chamber floor or propped up with small stones (e.g., tombs 801 , 809A, 81 7B, 823, 825, 826A, 829C, 831, 833C, 305B, 31 IB, 318; Herscher 1978, 786-7 and n. 27).

How- ever, one of the most extraordinary examples of collective secondary burial comes from Swedish tomb 313A of probable MCI date. This tomb had an exceptionally large chamber, an estimated floor area of 20.4 m2, and a rich collection of grave goods that included 80 copper-based artifacts. Fifteen indi- viduals were carefully placed in the tomb's six niches and in a circle upon the floor, with no evi- dent stratigraphic separations or signs of tomb re- use.76 It is possible that one, or at most two, extremely ostentatious mortuary events took place in this chamber, with several individuals having been exhumed and reburied at the same time. Other complex postmortem rituals may be repre- sented in the approximately contemporaneous Swedish tomb 322A. This chamber had the largest floor area among those calculated for Lapithos (mea- suring 27 m2) and was one of the richest chambers found at the site, with 53 copper-based artifacts and a few small ornaments of gold and silver as well. The skeletal remains, however, reportedly consisted of only a few bones on the floor and some finger bones - which have a low aptitude for archaeologi- cal preservation and recovery - in the niches.77 It may be speculated that pre-interment processing (such as primary burial and exhumation) and/or tertiary post-interment rituals (involving the han- dling and partial removal of skeletal remains) con- tributed to the sparse preservation of human bones in this otherwise intact chamber tomb. The existing sample of mortuary data from Lapithos suggests that secondary treatment of the dead was practiced often, although not invariably, at the time the cemetery was established and throughout its subsequent use. The attendant prac- tices appear to have been elaborated through time, with a marked increase in ostentation occurring at the outset of the MCI period. This is apparent not only from the collective burials and complex ritual practices seen in chambers such as Swedish tombs 313A and 322A but also in the levels of mortuary expenditure exhibited throughout the community (as discussed in more detail below). Unfortunately, very little information was recorded about the burial treatments in the later tombs of MCII-MCIII at Lapithos, but it is possible that the very dearth of well-preserved remains from these tombs is related to the ritual practices as well as to post-depositional disturbances.

This tomb, dated from Late 78 The mean estimated chamber floor area for tombs in this chronological group was 11.2 m, more than double the mean for earlier tombs at the site. 79 The Swedish Cyprus Expedition investigated a group of 14 tombs used between MCII and LCII, among which nine seem to have been undisturbed since antiquity (Gjerstad et al.</page><page sequence="17">2005] DEATH, PRESTIGE, AND COPPER IN BRONZE AGE CYPRUS 357 MCI to Early MCIII,80 had a large, roughly circular chamber in which the excavators discerned a total of 15 burials. Eleven skeletons were found along the walls of the chamber, and four others were ar- ranged in the center.81 At least three individuals (skeletons VII, VIII, and IX) seem to have been interred in crouching positions, and as each of the 15 burials occupied a space of only 70 x 90 cm, the excavators suggested that all of the skeletons must have been similarly arranged.82 The burials were surrounded by tomb goods showing no signs of dis- turbance, which is curious, considering the limita- tions of space in the chamber. There was no apparent stratigraphic separation between the burial deposits, or any evidence for multiple epi- sodes of clearance and refilling in the dromos.83 The wide chronological range of the finds could have resulted from the exhumation and collective, simultaneous reburial of several persons of differ- ent generations. Burial remains in Ayios Iakovos tombs 1 and 4 may represent other types of post-interment ritual. In tomb 1, the skeletal remains of 10-12 individu- als were gathered along the south wall on top of a layer of silt.84 The silt contained some small pots, which were the only finds from the tomb. The strat- ification of the dromos suggested that the tomb was deliberately resealed after an episode of distur- bance, leading the excavators to speculate that this was not a typical looting incident but rather an ep- isode of "house-cleaning" in anticipation of future burials that never occurred.85 A similar suggestion was made regarding tomb 4, where both the princi- pal chamber and the side chamber contained very few finds and only fragmentary skeletal remains.86 It is possible that portions of the tomb 1 and 4 buri- als and some of the associated goods were removed to inaugurate the use of a later chamber tomb.87 In the course of such rituals, some of the human re- mains and grave goods may have been selectively transferred to new tombs while others were left be- hind or discarded. Alternatively, some items, espe- cially metal objects and other valuables, could con- ceivably have been returned to use by the living. Such practices would account for the highly vari- able condition of burials in many chamber tombs of EC-MC date, including the four approximately con- temporaneous burials in Ayios Iakovos tomb 7, two of which were fragmentary and two of which were relatively complete.88 The cemetery of Korovia Paleoskoutella on the Karpass peninsula affords perhaps the most com- plete evidence for secondary treatment and collec- tive burial during the Cypriot Bronze Age from any single locality. The site dates to the MCIII or LCIA periods89 and is remarkable for its diverse array of mortuary features, including simple and elaborate chamber tombs, as well as other complexes prob- ably associated with a multistage program of mortu- ary ritual. All of these burial features were covered with earth and stone tumuli; the entire cemetery originally contained about 20 such tumuli, seven of which were investigated by the Swedish Cyprus Expedition. The largest, tumulus 7, lay at the cen- ter of the burial ground and was surrounded by smaller tumuli spaced at regular distances from one another.90 Tumulus 7 was three to four times larger than the others, measuring 22.0 x 17.5 x 3.1 m, and was built up in multiple layers of clay and stone surmounted by concentric casings of rubble.91 Its construction may have taken place over a period of several years, possibly in the course of periodic ritual observances. While the construction of tumuli and other ritual practices inferred at Paleoskoutella have long been regarded as evidence for some atypi- cal and catastrophic event,92 closer consideration 1934, 302-55). Six of these appear to have been cut in MCII or MCIII, while the others may have been first used in LCI. The later tombs (8, 10, 14) are renowned for their so-called mass burials, which probably represent large-scale events of secondary treatment and collective reburial rather than cata- strophic casualties of warfare or epidemic (Keswani 1989b, 272- 8; 2004,91-2). 80Astr6m 1972, 179, 189. 81 Gjerstad et al. 1934, fig. 124:2. 82 Skeleton VII, which was particularly well preserved, was reportedly positioned with the knees drawn up at a sharp an- gle, the tibia partly covered by other bones, and the skull lying near the wall. 83 Gjerstad et al. 1934, 315-7. 84 Gjerstad et al. 1934, fig. 119:1. 85 Gjerstad et al. 1934, 304. 86 Gjerstad et al. 1934, 311, fig. 124:1. 87 In the case of the Merina of Madagascar, Bloch (1982, 213) notes that skeletal remains may be removed from an os- tensibly final and permanent collective tomb in order to inau- gurate the use of a new one, since an individual may not be placed alone in a tomb. 88 Gjerstad et al. 1934, 322-5, fiff. 125:5. 89 Cf.

A few instances of earthen tumuli were observed over Late Cypriot tombs at En- komi (Swedish tombs 7, 10, 11, 13, 21; see Gjerstad etal. 1934), and some EC-MC tombs at Alambra Mouttes were reportedly covered by mounds of earth and stones (Decker and Barlow 1983, 83), suggesting that the use of such markers was not entirely uncommon. 91 Gjerstad et al. 1934, 429-30. 92 Gjerstad et al. 1934, 438; Webb 1992, 94.</page><page sequence="18">358 PRISCILLA SCHUSTER KESWANI [AJA109 suggests that mortuary practices at this site were similar to those postulated for Lapithos and Ayios Iakovos. The Swedish Cyprus Expedition excavated four chamber tombs at Paleoskoutella. Tombs 2 and 5 were both relatively small, crudely cut chamber tombs probably used for primary burials that were subsequently exhumed. At the time of excavation, the tombs appeared to have been cleared of all burial remains and goods, except for a few sherds, with the overlying tumuli being partially or entirely displaced when the tombs were emptied.93 The chamber and dromos of tomb 5 had been systemati- cally packed with rubble. On the basis of this filling and the complete removal of bones and artifactual material, the excavators proposed that the empty- ing of the tombs was a deliberate ritual act rather than an instance of recent looting.94 The burials removed may have been reinterred in more elabo- rate chamber tombs, such as tombs 4 and 7. Tomb 4 contained two poorly preserved burials, thought to have been interred simultaneously.95 Tomb 7, which bears a strong resemblance to Lapithos tomb 313A in plan, seems to have been used for a total of 14 simultaneous burials, some of which were fragmen- tary. Two skeletons in lateral, flexed positions were found in three of the four niches, while the fourth niche contained a single burial. Seven other skel- etons were arranged on the chamber floor below the niches, apparently in similar positions. The excavator, E. Sjoqvist, noted that the placement of two skeletons in each of three of the niches was highly unusual. None of the 14 skeletons appeared to have been displaced to make room for subse- quent burials; several of the burials seemed to have been introduced to the tomb as decomposing corpses or skeletal remains, including three of the individuals on the floor, which should have been among the latest and best-preserved burials. These anomalies led to the conclusion that all 14 burials had been interred simultaneously.96 One of the Plain White sherds found in tomb 2 came from the same jar as a sherd found in the main trench dug through tumulus 7; this fact offers direct evidence for the transferral of burial deposits. 97 Tumuli 1, 3, and possibly 6, along with their un- derlying features, may represent other activities as- sociated with the ritual treatment of the dead. The complex of cuttings beneath tumulus 1 was the larg- est and most intricate, extending over an area of 9.10 x 5.50 m and consisted of two sections where a number of pits (possibly postholes) were found. The finds included a Black Slip II jug, a spindle whorl, and 725 sherds mainly from shallow bowls. Several pits contained strata of "mouldered organic material" and/or bits of burned animal bone.98 The presence of burned animal bone and the large quantity of shallow bowls suggest that food prepara- tion and feasting occurred in this area, lending support to Sjoqvist's interpretation of the features associated with tumuli 1, 3, and 6 as cult places where sacrifices and other religious ceremonies were carried out.99 It might also be suggested that some of these features were used for the process- ing of human remains between episodes of primary and secondary burial; treatments involving expo- sure and defleshing of the deceased could have taken place on structures such as platforms, scaf- folding, or hammocks, for which postholes were required. Some of the pits with the "mouldered organic material" could have been used to collect or burn the secretions of decaying corpses. The use of the features associated with tumuli 1, 3, and 6 as processing facilities for human remains might also explain the presence of thick layers of white clayey earth and rock matter prior to the construc- tion of the mounds. Calling this preparation "des- ecration" is questionable,100 as many cultures practicing secondary treatment view decaying flesh as unclean or profane.101 It is possible that the white deposits in fact represent acts of ritual purification or cleansing rather than desecration. Although the best-documented examples of sec- ondary treatment and reburial come from the sites just discussed - Vounous and Lapithos in the north- west, Ayios Iakovos and Paleoskoutella in the north- east - other likely occurrences of such treatment may be discerned at various localities throughout the island. The cemeteries of Dhenia Kafkalla and Dhenia Mali, for example, are characterized by dis- 93Gjerstad et al. 1934, figs. 163:9, 166:3. 94Gjerstad et al. 1934, 421-2, 426-8, 438. 95Gjerstad et al. 1934, 423-5; 427, fig. 166:1. 96Gjerstad et al. 1934, 431, 438. 97 Gjerstad et al. 1934, 438. 98 Gjerstad et al. 1934, 416-9. The complex of features be- neath tumulus 3 was roughly similar but smaller in scale (Gjer- stad et al. 1934, 423, 420, fig. 163:11-13). Tumulus 6 covered a rectangular shaft with an apsidal niche at the southeast cor- ner, a circular pit in the northwest corner, and a low north- south rubble wall two courses high dividing the shaft into two unequal portions (Gjerstad et al. 1934, 427, fig. 166:4-6).

Several tombs in these cemeteries were small, shallow fea- tures measuring no more than 2 m in length; al- though they appear to have been unaffected by modern looting activity, they contained notably few finds or human bones in situ.102 Their use would have overlapped with other much more elaborate chamber tombs at Dhenia Kafkalla, such as tomb 48, tomb G.W.I, and tomb 6. These tombs, although disturbed, contained large collections of pottery and were used for multiple burials. All of them had large, niched chambers.103 Given the evidence from other EC-MC sites discussed above, it is possible that the disturbance and emptying of the other smaller, poorer mortuary features in the Dhenia cemeteries resulted from the exhumation and reinterment of primary burials in larger and more elaborate chamber tombs. The recent discovery of senet- and mehen-type gaming boards cut in the bedrock at Dhenia Kafkallia104 suggests that funer- als were occasions for social activity and entertain- ment, as in other societies that practice dual obsequies. Other possible instances of secondary treatment and collective burial may be discerned in the cem- eteries of Politiko Lambertis, Nicosia Ayia Paraskevi, and Kalopsidha in the central and eastern regions of Cyprus, as well as in Kalavasos village and Sotira Kaminoudhia on the south coast of the island. Politiko Lambertis tomb 18, one of the larger tombs found at this site and also one of the few in which silver objects were reported, contained a "mass burial" of 12-15 individuals.105 Other "mass buri- als" have been attributed to Nicosia Ayia Paraskevi tomb 13 (a small feature in which Stewart observed nine skulls, some long bones, a few small pots, and metal ornaments dating to MCIII106) and Kalopsidha tomb 28 (where Myres reported a thick layer of bones, including three skulls107). Several tombs with buri- als represented mainly by skulls were excavated by the Department of Antiquities in the ECIII-MCIII cemetery in Kalavasos village,108 and other intact tombs containing only disarticulated human re- mains were excavated by the Vasilikos Valley Project (WP).109 At the earlier Philia-EC cemetery of Sotira Kaminoudhia, located further to the west, the prac- tice of secondary treatment was indicated by the fact that articulated skeletal remains were found in only a few of the 21 tombs excavated. It is also pos- sible that infant burials were exhumed from sev- eral small cist graves containing artifacts but no human bones.110 Social and Ideological Implications of Secondary Treatment and Collective Burial The mortuary evidence discussed above suggests that, in addition to primary inhumation, many complex programs of mortuary treatment were un- dertaken in Cypriot prehistoric Bronze Age com- munities. In some cases, as in the cemeteries of Bellapais Vounous and Kalavasos village, rituals em- phasizing the curation and reburial of the skull seem to have been practiced for some individuals. Further post-interment rituals involving the removal and repositioning of the skull and the grouping of long bones from multiple individuals, along with possible occurrences of collective secondary burial, seem to have taken place at Vounous. Modes of sec- ondary treatment involving the exhumation and reburial of remains from pit graves, pithoi, and dromos cupboards were probably practiced at the cemetery of Lapithos Vrysi tou Barba, where several instances of simultaneous, collective burials have also been noted. Other collective secondary buri- als, sometimes referred to as mass burials, seem to have taken place at Ayios Iakovos Melia, Korovia Paleoskoutella, and perhaps in the cemeteries of Dhenia, Politiko, Ayia Paraskevi, and Kalopsidha. While there was probably considerable variation in 102 See Kafkalla tombs 49, 163, 167-169; Mali tombs 24-26 (Nicolaou andNicolaou 1988) . No dates were proposed for Mali tombs 25 and 26, but the others all seem to have been used between ECIII and MCI or MCII, making them contempora- neous with the lamer chamber tombs. 103Tomb48 (Nicolaou and Nicolaou 1988, fig. 2) contained at least 10 skulls and over 277 objects of ECIII-MCIII date. Tomb G.W.I (Astrom and Wright 1962, fig. 6) measured ap- proximately 5 x 4 m and was reported to have been used for several burials of MCII date. Tomb 6 (Astrom and Wright 1962, fig. 8) was an even larger complex (9 x 4 m) representing the fusion of two tombs and containing approximately 175 objects ofMCI-MCIIIdate. 104Herscher 1998, 320. 105 It measured 3.50 x 3.50 x 0.75 m (Gjerstad 1926, 81). 106Hennessy et al. 1988, 20-1. 107 Myres 1897, 146. 108 Tombs 1, 8, 9, 11, and possibly 5 in Karageorghis 1958. luyE.ff., tombs 39-40, Todd 1986, 28-30. noSee Swiny etal.

Keswani 2004, 49).</page><page sequence="20">360 PRISCILLA SCHUSTER KESWANI [AJA109 the details and frequencies of these practices among different communities and regions, the extraordi- nary collective interments in Lapithos tomb 3 ISA, Ayios Iakovos tomb 6, and Paleoskoutella tomb 7, each consisting of 14-15 carefully arranged burials, would seem to attest to a widely shared complex of mortuary ritual and ideology. The staging of such large-scale funerary events seems to have escalated during the MC period, when energy expenditure in tomb construction and material expenditure in grave goods were also on the rise.111 It is important to note that like other cultures practicing elaborate forms of dual obsequies, Cyp- riot communities did not necessarily accord such treatment to all individuals. At Vounous, Lapithos, and other sites, single or sequential primary inter- ments, as well as mixed primary and secondary buri- als, seem to be represented. In addition, not all secondary burials were distinctively rich, nor were all rich burials clearly secondary. Metcalf's study of funerary rituals among the Berawan of Borneo helps elucidate some of the prac- tical considerations affecting the execution of dual obsequies, and may serve as a provisional model for Cypriot ritual observances. The Berawan believe that the souls of the deceased do not come to rest in the land of the dead permanently until the flesh has decomposed and the bones are dry. Their ideal sequence of mortuary rites, known as nulang, en- tails primary burial followed by a much more elabo- rate and extended second funeral in which the deceased is exhumed and reburied. This second funeral completes the journey of the dead, and many guests are invited to participate in feasting and singing songs for the deceased person. Yet it should be noted that nulang is accorded to a rela- tively small proportion of individuals. This does not necessarily mean that others do not undergo the same journey or transition, only that their transfor- mation is not celebrated.112 Nulang is undertaken mainly when aspiring leaders decide to construct a new and elaborate mausoleum as a display of social prestige, or when seasonal and economic constraints prevent the family from staging an appropriate cel- ebration at the time of death.113 When a suitable tomb is already available, and the family has suffi- cient resources to stage a "grand" funeral immedi- ately, secondary treatment is not practiced. Similar practical contingencies may have affected the choice of burial programs in Bronze Age Cyprus. The construction of large rock-cut chamber tombs (some with floor areas in excess of 20 m2 at Lapithos and Dhenia) , the marshalling of resources for com- munal or pan-communal feasting and hospitality (livestock and other foodstuffs) , and the accumula- tion of grave goods (especially pottery and copper- based objects) to be disposed of with the dead are all factors that may have necessitated a delay in the final commemoration of the deceased. In some cases, secondary mortuary celebrations may have in- volved lavish displays of wealth and largesse; in oth- ers, the overall levels of expenditure may have been lower but no less costly for the sponsoring groups in terms of the efforts required relative to household wealth. Secondary funerals in which multiple indi- viduals were reburied at the same time may have necessitated particularly demanding and extended preparations for both richer and poorer groups alike. The extent of the ideological similarities between the Berawan and Bronze Age Cypriot mortuary com- plexes is more difficult to reconstruct. Among the Berawan, the separation of the flesh from the bones (commemorated in rituals of secondary treatment and collective burial) marks the separation of the soul of the deceased from the living and its incor- poration into the spiritual world of the ancestors. However, notions about the journey of the soul and the afterlife are variable in contemporary societies that practice dual obsequies. Among the Bara of Madagascar, such beliefs are seldom directly articu- lated; the reburial of the deceased in the collective patrilineal tomb ("from mother's womb to father's tomb") may be interpreted instead as a means of restoring the imbalance between death and the vi- tality essential to natural fertility and human repro- duction.114 Cypriot communities, far removed both culturally and geographically from Indonesia and Madagascar, undoubtedly had unique beliefs of their own. However, the concept of an afterlife and the power exercised by the ancestors as intermedi- aries between the natural and supernatural worlds may have formed part of those beliefs. The mem- bers of Cypriot Bronze Age communities clearly believed the dead wanted or needed many of the same goods, provisions, tools, and ceremonial rega- lia that were used by the living. In addition, ceramic models or representations of themes relating to human reproduction and subsistence were some- times among the burial items. By providing the dead with the goods they required and staging the ap- 111 On the social implications of energy expenditure in mor- tuary practice and monumental construction, see Tainter 1973, 1975, 1978; Trigger 1990. 112 Metcalf 1982, 103, 155-7. 113 Metcalf 1982, 159. 114 Metcalf and Huntington 1991, 111-3.</page><page sequence="21">2005] DEATH, PRESTIGE, AND COPPER IN BRONZE AGE CYPRUS 361 propriate sequence of ritual treatment, the living funeral sponsors may well have believed they were transforming their dead relatives into powerful an- cestors whose favor would assure the ongoing fer- tility and prosperity of their kin. Another distinctive feature of EC-MC mortuary practice is the increasing emphasis on tomb groups rather than individual burials, with mean burial group size rising. Most of the ECI tombs at Vounous A were used for burial groups of one to two indi- viduals, with a mean of 1.6 burials per chamber. The later burial groups at Vounous B were gener- ally larger, with a mean of 2.9 burials per chamber. Similarly at Lapithos, mean burial group size was 2.2 within the chambers of the EC and transitional ECIIIB/MCI periods, rising to 4.2 in chambers of MC date. A few very rich chambers of the later pe- riod had unusually large burial groups of 10-15 individuals. This visible increase in group size is attributable not only to the growing numbers of concurrent burials but also to the protracted reuse of tombs over multiple generations, which in turn suggests a long-term identification of kin groups with their ancestors. Concurrently, at Vounous and other sites there seems to have been a shift away from mainly single-chambered tombs toward dual- or multi-chambered tomb complexes.115 Such multi- chambered complexes were prevalent in the north at Lapithos, and in the south at Erimi Kafkalla, Evdhimou Shilles, Paramali Mandra, Paramali Pharkonia and Episkopi Phaneromeni.116 At Episkopi Phaneromeni, one extraordinary "trench dromos" measured 7-8 m in length and opened onto a com- plex of 9 to 12 chambers. The chambers were ar- ranged in four pairs on the long sides of the dromos, their doors almost opposite each other.117 Like the overall increase in burial group size, the construction of multi-chambered tomb complexes probably represents the emergence of strong inter- ests in expressing lineal or other kin ties among group members and links to their ancestors in a highly visible, material, and permanent fashion. The social and biological relationships of the in- dividuals interred in common tombs are all but completely unknown, largely due to the dearth of scientific studies of human skeletal remains. In the case of paired burials, we can rarely even say whether male-female couples or same sex pairs are repre- sented. At least one male-female couple was re- ported in Vounous A tomb 90, 118 but other pairs may have been differently constituted. Similarly, in the case of larger burial groups, we do not know how the individuals were related (biologically or by a combination of descent and other social ties, such as marriage) or whether there were closer biologi- cal relationships among the males or the females included in the same tomb chambers. However, eth- nographic evidence suggests that persons buried together within a particular tomb were more likely to have been linked by kinship or other social ties rather than unrelated individuals who simply hap- pened to die at the same time.119 The construction of ornate niched chambers such as Lapithos tomb 313A and Paleoskoutella tomb 7 suggests prior ar- chitectural planning was undertaken with the in- tention of accommodating specific individuals in a carefully structured fashion, perhaps with forebears assigned to the niches and their descendents ar- ranged below on the chamber floor. Likewise, the symmetrical arrangement of chambers along trench dromoi at Episkopi Phaneromeni may be another indication of burial accommodations planned for specific members of a social group. Thus it may be argued that meaningful, collectively acknowl- edged, and probably kin-based social entities were associated with particular tombs; unfortunately, the basis upon which those groups were defined (e.g., matrilineal, patrilineal, or bilateral kinship ties) cannot be determined at present. The emphasis on collective rather than indi- vidual identities in EC-MC mortuary celebrations was probably consistent with the exigencies of so- cial and economic life. Regardless of the extent to which individuals or individual households might have augmented their wealth and social prestige (through the production of agricultural surplus, the manipulation of alliance and exchange net- works, and the elaboration of their personal para- phernalia) , status claims must ultimately have been underwritten by kin group support. The impor- tance of intergenerational transfers of wealth in establishing and maintaining individual house- 115 Single-chambered tombs predominated at Vounous A, but multi-chambered complexes made up at least one-third of the tomb sample at Vounous B. One particularly interesting complex at Vounous B may be seen in Schaeffer (1936, fig. 10) and Dunn-Vaturi (2003, fig. 23), illustrating the intersect- ing or overlapping dromoi of tombs 70, 73, 75, and 78. Not all of these dromoi seem to have been deliberately joined, but the cutting of several tombs in such close proximity to one another may well have had some symbolic significance. 116Weinberg 1956; Carpenter 1981; Swiny 1981, 82-3. 117Weinberg 1956, 121, fie. 13. 118 Stewart and Stewart 1950, 94. 119 See Keswani 1989b, 82-6.

Another factor may have been the need for cooperation in agricultural labor, especially at the harvest and other periods of intense activity. Kin group support may also have been crucial in meeting ritual responsibilities such as the sponsorship of large-scale mortuary celebra- tions and the fulfillment of marriage payments. Furthermore, it would have enabled households to pool or borrow resources so as to participate in the regional network of exchange in metal, livestock, marriage partners, and other goods. The kinship ties noted above would have been celebrated in mortuary ritual, reinforcing the con- sciousness of lineage or descent group identity through the commemoration of the group's com- mon ancestors. An important corollary to these ex- pressions of group identity was the public affirmation of a group's social status and wealth, an affirmation that was subject to public evaluation based on the costliness of the mortuary festivities. There is strong evidence to suggest that levels of mortuary expendi- ture increased through time as mortuary ritual be- came an ever more important arena for the creation and negotiation of social prestige; this is discussed in the following section. MORTUARY RITUAL AND PRESTIGE IN THE EARLY-MIDDLE CYPRIOT PERIODS The social structure of EC-MC communities has been the subject of conflicting interpretations in recent years. On one side of the debate are those who argue that social and economic life during this time was dominated by "status-conscious" and "weapon-bearing" elites120 with "sustained and in- heritable power."121 Knapp hypothesizes that elite power groups emerged and held sway in the north- ern regions of Cyprus by approximately 2000 B.C., or the onset of the MC period.122 This occurred in con- junction with the secondary products revolution, the development of a local copper industry, and the as- sociated changes in the social relations of produc- tion. He finds evidence for the development of socioeconomic inequality in the high concentration of copper artifacts in a small number of tombs at Lapithos Vrysi tou Barba. Manning interprets the metal-rich cemeteries of Vasilia Kafkallia and Lapithos Vrysi tou Barba as the exclusive burial grounds of hereditary elites who made use of a dis- tinctive prestige assemblage, notably copper weap- onry, in emulation of Anatolian elites. Manning additionally argues that elite groups made use of elaborate ceramic vessels in their burial assemblages; alcoholic beverages were produced under elite su- pervision and consumed on occasions of elite-spon- sored hospitality and largesse. 123 Both Manning and Peltenburg have also argued for a highly stratified social order based on their interpretations of the symbolism of the "sacred enclosure" bowl model from Vounous tomb 22. According to Manning, the representation within the bowl of a male seated on a raised chair and presiding over a ritual scene attests to "an institutionalized, secular form of power con- centrated in, or expressed by, a key individual." Based on his interpretation of the bowl, he concludes that "one may recognize an hereditary elite and all the ingredients for further development into enti- ties like polities or states."124 Peltenburg similarly views the Vounous bowl as the expression of an hier- archical social order dominated by a ritually sancti- fied leader, drawing structural comparisons between the arrangement of male, female, and animal fig- ures arranged inside the Vounous bowl and the de- piction of nature, mankind, the king, and the goddess on the famous alabaster relief vase from the E-anna precinct of Mesopotamian Uruk.125 On the other side of the social structure debate are those who argue that EC-MC society was char- acterized by a relatively low level of socioeconomic differentiation. Swiny has commented on the lack of evidence for a "Chiefdom Stage" prior to the emergence of urban communities in the Late Cyp- riot Bronze Age; he contends that prior to the 17th century B.C., copper production was not extensive enough in scale to encourage foreign trade, local wealth accumulations, or the "creation of status-con- scious elites."126 Coleman, in summarizing the sig- nificance of excavations at the MC settlement of Alambra Mouttes, notes the absence of any distinc- tively large public or private buildings and the lack of "any particular focus of authority or wealth in the village layout." He suggests that while authority fig- ures such as the large male depicted in the Vounous bowl possibly existed, their realm of influ- ence may have been limited to their extended households.127 Frankel draws a similar conclusion 120 Peltenburg 1994, 158-9. 121 Manning 1993, 45. 122 Knapp 1990, 161. 123 Manning 1993; Manning and Swiny 1994.

Davies, based on his study of EC-MC mortuary data, has likewise argued for "a model of broad homogeneity in mortuary practice through- out the prehistoric Bronze Age, consistent with a low level of socioeconomic differentiation."130 The reality, or lived experience, of social struc- ture in EC-MC communities probably lay some- where between these contrasting views. Careful consideration of architectural and artifactual varia- tions between tomb groups suggests that there were significant differences in status and wealth both within and between communities from the onset of the EC period. However, the increase in both tomb size and the quantities of grave goods consumed, and the primarily quantitative (not qualitative) dif- ferences observed in burial assemblages, suggest that a high level of prestige competition was under way throughout the EC-MC periods, and that dif- ferences in status were graded and negotiable rather than rigidly hierarchical. Analyses of the mortuary assemblages from Vounous and Lapithos and comparisons with other cemeteries help illus- trate dynamic changes in mortuary consumption and display over time. Mortuary Display at Bellapais Vounous Burial goods from the Vounous tombs included a rich and diverse array of Red Polished pottery; lesser quantities of Black Polished and White Painted wares; a variety of copper-based weapons, ornaments, and tools; other artifacts, such as spindle whorls and whetstones; and the remains of sheep, goat, and cattle. Figure 6 illustrates some of the more typical shapes of Red Polished and Black Polished bowls, storage jars, and jugs deriving from tomb 164A, mentioned in the previous section. Fig- ure 7 illustrates some of the highly distinctive pots from site A described by the excavators as cult ves- sels" and herein referred to more generally as cer- emonial vessels.131 These include the unusual vase with a modeled pouring scene from tomb 164A (fig. 7a), along with stemmed and tulip-shaped bowls with coroplastic ornaments from tombs 160A and 91, respectively (fig. 7b, c), forms which recur in a number of tombs. Other unusual ceramic items, such as models of bull horns, spindles, daggers, and sheaths, were found in tombs at site A, with additional forms, such as brush models, plank idols, and genre scenes, occurring at site B (figs. 5, 8). New types of ceremonial vessels came into use at Vounous B, such as composite vessels, ring vases, double- and triple-necked jugs, other jugs and bowls with elaborate modeled and incised decoration, pyx- ides and askoi (sometimes representing birds, boats, etc.), as illustrated in figure 9. Figures 10 and 11 illustrate two of the richest groups of copper finds from sites A and B, respectively. At Vounous A, the assemblage of copper-based artifacts consisted mainly of knives, axes, and hook-tang weapons.132 At Vounous B, these same artifact types were found along with pins, razors or scrapers, tweezers, and other copper-based objects. Imported Levantine pottery, faience beads, and gold ornaments were found in a few rare instances in tombs at both cem- eteries, though more commonly at Vounous B. The differences in wealth among tomb groups at Vounous A (dating mainly to ECI), the earlier tomb groups at Vounous B (dating mainly between ECII- ECIIIA) , and the later tomb groups of Vounous B (dating mainly between ECIIIB-MCII) are summa- rized in tables 2-4. The data presented in each table derive primarily from tombs that were deemed intact at the time of excavation or, in a few instances, from those that had substantially preserved collec- tions of grave goods despite some signs of distur- bance. In each table, roughly contemporaneous tomb groups are divided into three or four tiers of wealth, based on the number of copper items per chamber, with the first tier including tombs with no copper objects, and the subsequent tiers includ- ing tomb groups with small and progressively larger quantities of copper. The divisions between tiers are purely arbitrary and should not be equated with 128 Frankel 2002, 173. ™ Frankel 2002, 174. 130 Davies 1997, 22. 131 Many simpler shapes may of course also have been used in ceremonial as well as more mundane contexts, as witnessed by the depiction of the pouring jug in fig. 7a and the jug and bowls found on the ceramic offering table illustrated in fig. 9d. However, I use the term "ceremonial vessels" here to refer to complex forms that seem more likely to have been displayed and used in ritual and/or convivial contexts than in daily, util- itarian activities. 132 These items have often been described as daggers or swords but are more likely to have served as spearheads; see Philip 1991, 67-72.</page><page sequence="24">364 PRISCILLA SCHUSTER KESWANI [AJA109 Fig. 9.

The tiers serve as an heuristic illustration of the extent to which other measures of wealth and en- ergy expenditure (such as the number of pots per chamber or chamber floor area) rose in conjunc- tion with both the increasing copper wealth and the increasing number of burials per chamber. They also illustrate the distribution of particular catego- ries of prestige goods (ceremonial vessels, ceramic models, and imported goods), along with the con- sumption of large fauna (cattle, sheep, and goat) in groups of varying wealth. Some interesting disparities in mortuary expen- diture within the cemetery at Vounous A are illus- trated in table 2. Exactly 50% (20 out of 40) intact tomb chambers at this locality contained no metal items. These tombs also had the lowest means of pots per chamber and chamber floor area relative to the other tiers. However, the percentages of cer- emonial vessels, ceramic models, and large faunal remains contained in the tombs of the first tier were closely comparable to the second tier. It is extremely unfortunate that we cannot assess the degree to which the demographic variables (age and gender) of the burials may have affected wealth expendi- ture, particularly of copper items, in the first tier.133 Yet even if the absence of metal and the relatively small quantities of pottery observed were linked to one or both of these variables, a comparison of the second and third tiers suggests that there were also differences in wealth and prestige-related con- sumption within the "metal-eligible" segments of 133 On the basis of the burials that Rix identified by sex (Stewart and Stewart 1950, 374) , it can only be said that at least one of the intact tombs in the first tier (tomb 116) contained a male burial, and two looted tombs with no copper items (tombs 127 and 153) also contained one or more male burials. Stewart and Stewart (1950, 174) also noted the presence of a child aged 6-12 years in tomb 120. In the second tier, one of two burials in tomb 107 was reportedly a female aged 1 1-13 years; both of the burials in tomb 83 were said</page><page sequence="25">2005] DEATH, PRESTIGE, AND COPPER IN BRONZE AGE CYPRUS 365 Fig. 10.

The twofold disparity in mean pots per chamber and mean chamber floor area between the second and third tiers may have been partially, although not entirely, correlated with increasing burial group size (table 5). However, the low corre- lation value of 0.293 in table 5 also shows that at Vounous A, the quantities of copper items per cham- ber varied independently of the number of burials per chamber; indeed, overall, only one or two buri- als were present in each of the three richest tombs: to be male, and the single burial in tomb 160A was also apparently male. Stewart and Stewart (1950, 94) further identified the two individuals in tomb 90 as a male and a female. In the third tier, one of the four burials in tomb 1 18 was reportedly male. These scanty data do not permit any age- or gender-related inferences.</page><page sequence="26">366 PRISCILLA SCHUSTER KESWANI [AJA109 Fig. 11.

The same three tombs were also among the largest in terms of chamber floor area, and they were located along the highest contour interval of the cemetery. In short, the concentration of copper artifacts in these tombs and its cooccurrence with both large tomb size and patterned location sug- gest that wealth and status differentials existed within the Vounous community as early as ECI. These differences in wealth are quantitative rather than qualitative. The metal goods, distinctive ceramic items (ceremonial vessels and models), and the large faunal remains that occurred in the third tier also occurred in the second and (with the excep- tion of metal) first tiers, albeit with lower frequen- cies. Such patterning may reflect a system of status differences based on seniority within the local kin group structure and enhanced by individual wealth</page><page sequence="27">2005] DEATH, PRESTIGE, AND COPPER IN BRONZE AGE CYPRUS 367 ^ *O cvj « ^ «?2 oVT i!

Moreover, the only instances of imported goods came from a chamber in the middle tier of overall wealth, tomb 164B, where pieces of sheet gold and a jug of prob- able Palestinian origin were found.134 Thus there is no evidence to suggest that foreign valuables were either monopolized or deployed as exclusive pres- tige symbols by the richest "tier 3" groups at this time. The patterns of mortuary expenditure seen at Vounous B are strikingly different from those at Vounous A; in addition, there are also notable dif- ferences between the earlier and later tombs of Vounous B. As shown in table 3, the ECII-IIIA tombs of Vounous B are quite poor in metal in compari- son both to the earlier ECI tombs of Vounous A (table 2) and to the later ECIIIB-MCII tombs of site B (table 4) . A total of 73% (19 out of 26) of the tombs contained no copper items, five tombs had one to two items per chamber, and two tombs had six to seven copper items.135 An actual shortage of metal during this period rather than changes in prestige symbolism and mortuary consumption pat- terns may account for the scarcity of copper arti- facts in the ECII-ECIIIA tombs. This is suggested by the large quantities of ceramics deposited in tombs of all tiers, coupled with the occurrence of ceramic models of metal daggers and sheaths. The correlations among the number of burials per cham- ber with variables such as chamber floor area, pots per chamber, and copper items per chamber are all fairly strong (table 5), which suggests that varia- tions in mortuary expenditure among tomb groups were probably related as much, if not more, to burial group size as to pronounced differences in wealth and prestige. In addition, as was the case at Vounous A, ceremonial vases, ceramic models, and the re- mains of large fauna were found in both the richer and poorer tombs. In the later tombs of Vounous B, all forms of mor- tuary consumption escalated markedly. Nearly 75% (38 out of 51) of the tombs in this group contained one or more copper artifacts. Table 4 illustrates the distribution of the types and quantities of finds within four broad tiers: 13 tombs have no copper items, 13 tombs have 1-3 copper objects per cham- ber, 18 tombs each have 4-9 copper items, and 7 134 For extensive discussion on the origins of this pot, see Stewart 1939b; Amiran 1971, 1973; Ross 1994. 135 The Stewarts' tomb 146 contained the poorest of all the burials (identified as a female by Rix) with no copper items and only five pots. At least some male burials were also lacking in copper, however, as observed in the Stewarts' tombs 132 and 141 (see Rix' identifications in Stewart and Stewart 1950, 374) . There is no information regarding the sexes of burials with copper in the earlier tombs of Vounous B.</page><page sequence="30">370 PRISCILLA SCHUSTER KESWANI [AJA109 tombs have 11-24 copper items per chamber.136 As shown in table 5, the correlations among the num- ber of copper items per chamber, pots per cham- ber, chamber floor area, and the number of burials per chamber are generally as strong as or stronger than those in the earlier chronological groups (ex- cept in the case of chamber floor area and burial group size). However, the increase in ceramics and metal goods consumed in the latest period at Vounous B were not only related to the increasing number of burials per chamber but also to rising levels of mortuary expenditure within the commu- nity at large. This is evident when the mean per capita values of pots per burial (the number of pots in each chamber divided by the number of burials observed) and copper items per burial (similarly calculated) are compared with the per capita val- ues of Vounous A and the early tombs of Vounous B. As illustrated in table 6, the mean pots per burial rose steadily through the three chronological groups defined. Copper items per burial dropped in the earlier tombs of Vounous B but increased considerably in the later Vounous B tombs. The median values for both of these indices also in- creased from the earliest to the latest periods at Vounous, suggesting that kin groups throughout the community were increasing their mortuary out- lays in the context of competitive displays. This same trend is evident in the labor invested in tomb construction. Mean chamber floor area rose from 3.7 m2 at Vounous A to 5.3 m2 in the earlier tombs at Vounous B, and then to 8.3 m2 in the later tombs at Vounous B (table 6). As previously noted, the correlation between chamber floor area and the number of burials per chamber is weakest for the later Vounous B tombs, suggesting that the increas- ing effort devoted to tomb construction was at least partially independent of increasing burial group size. As median floor areas rose, it seems that en- ergy expenditure in tomb construction was increas- ing throughout the community; this in turn may have been related to the growing importance of mortuary ritual as an arena for social display and prestige competition. As was the case in Vounous A and early Vounous B, the wealth of the later Vounous B tomb groups tended to be differentiated by the quantity rather than the specific types of prestige goods accompa- nying the dead. The same types of metal goods oc- curred in both richer and poorer tombs; the main difference is that the richer tombs tended to have a broader representation of types and multiple ex- amples of particular types.137 Similarly, ceremonial vessels, ceramic models, and large faunal remains occurred in all tiers of copper wealth but were more ubiquitous among the richer groups. This suggests that a high level of status competition, rather than ascribed rank or hierarchical control of prestige good access, accounts for the patterns of mortuary consumption observed. The only goods that dis- play any level of exclusivity in distribution are the small number of imports (including a gold earring, varying quantities of faience beads, two Levantine MBIIA pithos jars, and two Minoan daggers) found in tombs of middling to high copper wealth.138 It would not be surprising to find that groups of greater wealth were more likely to participate in long-distance exchange transactions, but the rarity of imported valuables among even the richest tomb groups at Vounous A and B raises the question of whether they were critical components of prestige symbolism at this time. Most lines of evidence sug- gest instead that the most important elements of mortuary ritual involved the display and disposal of goods (ceramics, metals, and valuable domestic animals) and the extension of lavish hospitality to guests from within and beyond the local commu- nity in funerary feasts;139 such practices served as a means of actively creating status distinctions in the context of mortuary ritual rather than as a de facto expression of well-entrenched, hereditary social stratification.140 Mortuary Display at Lapithos Vrysi tou Barba Burial assemblages at Lapithos mainly consisted of Red Polished, White Painted, and Black Pol- ished ceramics (figs. 12, 13); copper-based artifacts (figs. 14, 15); spindle whorls, whetstones, and other 136 As in previous periods, age-sex information is extremely limited. However, it is evident that at least one female was present in each of two large and comparatively rich burial groups where mortuary rites involving secondary treatment seem to have been practiced. These were Dikaios' tomb 36 (9 or more burials and 4 copper items; see Fischer 1986, 28 for the sex identification) and the Stewarts' tomb 143 (8 burials and 11 copper finds; see Rix' identification in Stewart and Stewart 1950, 374). 137 For a detailed illustration of this, see Keswani 2004, table 4.7c. 138 The gold earring came from Schaeffer's looted tomb 59. Faience beads or necklaces were found in Dikaios' tombs 2, 15, and 19, and in Schaeffer's tomb 59, 64, and 72. The Levantine jars (Syrian according to Ross 1994, 22) were found in Schaef- fer's tombs 64 and 68. The Minoan daggers came from Dikaios' tomb 19 and the Stewarts' tomb 143 (Catling and Karageorghis 1960, 110-1). 139 Manning 1993. 45: Keswani 1994. 270-1: Steel 2004. 287-8. 140 See discussions in Shennan 1986; Knapp 1990.</page><page sequence="31">2005] DEATH, PRESTIGE, AND COPPER IN BRONZE AGE CYPRUS 371 Table 6.

High variation in the values of pots per burial within each chronological period resulted in a higher (or less significant) Rvalue of 0.085 for the differences in the means for pots per burial. However, the rising median is a strong indicator of rising per capita expenditure in pottery. stone artifacts; faunal remains; and occasional oc- currences of exotic goods, such as gold, silver,141 lead, faience, and imported bronzes and ceramics. When compared to the goods found at Vounous,142 the ceramic goods at Lapithos were disposed of in smaller quantities, and ceremonial vessels of ornate or peculiar type were less common (fig. 13). Ce- ramic models of objects such as daggers, sheaths, horns, and spindles typical of Vounous have not been reported at Lapithos, but ceramic plank idols (fig. 4) and (less commonly) zoomorphic figurines were found in some tombs.143 Bones of cattle, sheep, and goats occurred less frequently than at Vounous and seem to have been absent (or unidentified) in the latest tomb chambers; however, other interest- ing remains have been reported, including dog bones in Swedish tombs 303A and 322D, and horse bones in Swedish tomb 322B.144 In contrast, metal artifacts were more plentiful in the Lapithos tombs from the onset of the cemetery's use, and their quan- tities increased markedly through time. The differences in wealth among Lapithos tomb groups dating to ECII-ECIIIA/B, ECIIIB-MCI, and MCI-MCIII are summarized in tables 7-9 (us- ing the same format employed in the analysis of the Vounous cemeteries) . Tombs included in the analy- sis were either intact or had substantially preserved collections of grave goods despite possible distur- bance. As with the Vounous tables, the division of Lapithos tomb chambers into tiers of wealth based on the number of copper items present is strictly an heuristic means of illustrating the relationships among various indicators of wealth and burial group size. The divisions are arbitrary and should not be equated with culturally cognized ranks or de facto social classes. The earliest tombs of Lapithos (table 7), dating to ECII-IIIA/B, were the poorest in terms of metal consumption. However, with copper artifacts occur- ring in approximately 40% (14 out of 35) of all chambers, the quantity of metal disposed of was greater than that observed in contemporaneous tombs at Vounous B (table 3). Tombs with no cop- per had the lowest mean number of pots per cham- ber, but, curiously, they also had the highest frequency of large faunal remains. As was also the case at Vounous, the scarcity of osteological studies unfortunately makes it difficult to determine the 141 Gale et al. (1996, 397) have indicated that a number of items described as silver-lead alloys are actually pure lead. 142 See also Davies 1997, 18. 143 On the plank idols, see supra n. 50.

Rich tombs with three to six copper items contained the same type of goods, as well as tweezers, pins, and needles. The mean number of pots per chamber increased con- siderably between each of these tiers, and measures of wealth and energy expenditure (pots per cham- ber, copper items per chamber, and chamber floor areas) were strongly correlated in this period (table 10). Tomb size and ceramic wealth were also highly correlated with burial group size. However, the number of copper items per chamber seems to have varied independently of the number of burials per chamber, suggesting that some groups had more favorable access to copper supplies than others. It is also perhaps significant that ceremonial vessels were found only in three of the richest tombs. In short, at least modest differences in wealth and perhaps in ritual status may have developed among kin groups at Lapithos during this time. Among the tombs dating to the ECIIIB/MCI tran- sitional period (table 8), copper was much more widely distributed, occurring in 74% (28 out of 38) of all chambers - comparable to the frequency ob- served in the latest group of tombs at Vounous B. As in the previous period, the mean number of pots per chamber and mean chamber floor area rose markedly with tier of copper wealth, although the correlations among these variables are somewhat lower than in the previous chronological group (table 10). Differences in material and energy ex- penditure were rather weakly correlated with burial group size, suggesting that wealth and prestige dif- ferences were also partially independent of kin group size. Quantitative differences in copper wealth between the second and third tiers seem especially pronounced or discrete, with 1-5 cop- per items per chamber in the former and 8-14 in the latter. The high frequency of imported goods within the richest tombs is also noteworthy. How- ever, two of the tombs from the poorest tier con- tained distinctive ceremonial vessels, as did nearly half of the tombs in the middle tier - a slightly higher frequency than was observed within the rich- 145 Swedish tomb 31 IB contained the burials of three children who received no metal goods but a fairly large collection of 21 pots (Gjerstad et al. 1934, 79-81). However, similar assemblages were found with other burial groups of comparable size in which no children were recognized by the excavators. While it is likely that some of the poorer burial assemblages in this and other chrono- logical groups at Lapithos were associated with children, others almost certainly belonged to adults of unknown gender.</page><page sequence="34">374 PRISCILLA SCHUSTER KESWANI [AJA109 Fig. 14.

What is perhaps most distinctive about the seven richest tombs is the high frequency of exotic goods found therein. In the third tier, two tombs (309 A and 806A) had unusually high concentrations of copper-based pins and a dearth of weaponry, which might be in- dicative of a concentration of rich female burials.146 Tomb 30 1C contained a notably rich single (possi- bly male) burial, equipped with 3 knives, 2 hook- tang weapons (1 of which was unusually long, measuring 63.6 cm) , 1 razor or scraper, and 2 pairs of tweezers. This person was distinguished by the num- ber and the elaboration of the metal goods present, not by the use of goods differing in kind from those available to other people, as all of these metal types were present in the second tier. Yet despite the wealth of metal objects, only 7 pots accompanied this burial.147 Tomb 806A was used for at least 3-4 buri- als and contained a massive accumulation of 110 pots, including several ceremonial vessels and a Minoan bridge-spouted jar; cattle bones; 14 cop- per-based artifacts; and several small ornaments of gold, silver, and faience.148 Tomb 322B contained a total of 9 copper-based objects, including 2 knives, 2 hook-tang weapons (1 of which was unusually large, measuring 58.6 cm), 1 razor or scraper, and 3 pairs of tweezers. Although only 20 pots were recov- ered from the tomb, 2 of them were ceremonial or cult vessels. Other finds included small ornaments of imported silver and faience and bones identi- fied as horse.149 The range and quantity of items found in these tombs and others of comparable metal wealth suggests that the groups who made use of them enjoyed greater access to local and long-dis- tance exchange networks than did other members of the community. Yet the metal and ceramic types associated with these groups were also broadly dis- tributed amongst other, poorer groups. In the latest (MCI-MCIII) phase of the Lapithos cemetery (table 9), 96% (22 out of 23) of the cham- bers contained copper-based artifacts. The 7 poor- est tombs had less than 6 copper artifacts; 9 tombs of intermediate wealth had 6-22 copper items, and the 7 richest chambers had remarkable collections of 40-80 copper artifacts each. Yet even though some tombs appear extraordinarily rich, it should 146 The three or more burials in Swedish tomb 309A were accompanied by 46 pots, 1 2 copper pins, a fragmentary copper sheet, a ceramic plank figurine, and a spindle whorl (Gjerstad etal. 1934, 70-4) . The three burials in Pennsylvania tomb 806A were accompanied by 10 pins, 1 pair of tweezers, 2 knives, and 1 hook-tang weapon (Grace 1940, 47-9), as well as other ob- jects summarized in the text. There is no osteological informa- tion pertaining to the gender of the burials in these tombs. 147Gierstad et al. 1934, 36-7. 148 Grace 1940. 149 The identification was made by H.

(Astrom 1972, figs. 9:8, 7, 1, 6, 2, 3, respectively) be noted that the quantities of copper present in each chamber were highly correlated with the num- bers of burials present (Pearson's r =0.858, see table 10). Chamber floor area was also moderately corre- lated with burial group size and, more noticeably, copper wealth. However, it is interesting that the number of pots per chamber was not significantly correlated with burial group size or other wealth measures, probably reflecting the lesser impor- tance of ceramic goods in prestige symbolism at Lapithos compared to Vounous and other sites. The metal types found in first tier tombs includ- ed rings, knives, hook-tang weapons, razors or scrap- ers, tweezers, and pins. These same types were also found in tombs assigned to the second and third tiers of copper wealth, though in general, a some- what broader range of metal and imported goods occurred in the richer tombs of the second and third tiers than it did in the poorer tombs. Some of the richest tombs also contained copper axes, awls, spatulas, chisels, and needles. The presence of axes in particular may be noteworthy, as they may have functioned as ingots in prehistoric Bronze Age ex- change networks;150 their disposal in the mortuary context may therefore have constituted a particular- ly flamboyant display of wealth and prestige. The inclusion of smaller utilitarian items, such as awls, spatulas, chisels, and needles, may also have been related to the general wealth of the related kin groups, who conspicuously disposed of any and ev- ery metal type used in domestic life. Ceremonial vessels, plank idols, and imported goods, such as silver or silver-lead rings and faience beads, occurred in both richer and poorer tombs, but some imports (e.g., Minoan bronzes, gold spirals, and a possible Syro-Cilician vessel) seem to have occurred in only a few of the very richest tomb chambers.151 As was sug- gested in the case of Vounous, it is perhaps not sur- prising that groups with greatest access to copper resources were most likely to participate in exchang- es of valuable goods with traders from abroad. As at Vounous, levels of mortuary expenditure at Lapithos escalated significantly over time and throughout the community. While the number of copper items per chamber was strongly correlated with the number of burials present, per capita metal expenditure was also on the rise. Table 11 illus- trates the continuous increases in both the means Gjerstad 1926, 81; Karageorghis 1965a, 286; Astrom 1972, 245; Buchholz 1973, 304 n. 29; see also Reese 1995, 38). Because the only preserved skeletal remains from this chamber be- longed to an adult female aged 18-24 years, Fischer (1986, 29) has referred to tomb 322B as the tomb of a female warrior or "Amazon." However, because the chamber was either loot- ed or considerably disturbed by post-interment rituals, it is likely that other burials, some possibly male, were originally present in the chamber's four niches or on the floor (Gjerstad et al. 1934, 143). lM Three axe or axe-shaped ingot molds have recently been recovered from Philia and ECIII/MCI contexts in the settle- ment at MarkiAlonia (Fasnachtand Wagner 2001, 41; Frankel and Webb 2001, 35-6). i5i xhree imported gold spirals were found in Swedish tomb 322A. Bronze daggers believed to be of Minoan origin were found in Swedish tombs 313CD and 322A; the latter chamber also contained a razor thought to be of Minoan manufacture (Catling and Karageorghis 1960, 110-2) . Branigan ( 1966, 1967) contends that other supposedly Minoan daggers from Myres' tombs 2, 18A, and 18B were actually products of Byblos in Syria. A possible Syro-Cilicianjugwas found in Pennsylvania tomb 805 (Herscher 1978, 160, 802-3).</page><page sequence="36">376 PRISCILLA SCHUSTER KESWANI [AJA109 O CM O&gt; „ 9vT «ttT &lt;°.i^ £$ §•«&amp; g-°g, g-°g, « |-s G c/3 g 5m g3 G en g Sm g-s G c/3 Sm S G c/3 5m G en Sm G c/3 Sm £ uc s-s G g °«&gt; °- K&gt; G C/5 5m H (N rHr- I HH I-H i iii of ^ ^ bo ^ x g g * i i «o n ou ^ .S ^ u. «5S I »ds§ I «gJ3 o I e .S u.

Meanwhile, the level of energy invested in tomb construction (as measured by chamber floor area) more than doubled in the latest period of the cemetery's use. Means went from 5.2-5.3 m2 in tombs predating MCI to 11.2 m2 during the MCI-MCIII periods, when some of the largest chambers covered areas of more than 20 m2.152 This floor area increase can be explained not only by rising burial group size (Pearson's r=0.565, see table 10) but also by increas- ing levels of ritual ostentation and mortuary dis- play. Because the means and medians for pots per burial, copper items per burial, and chamber floor area all rose steadily through time, this phenom- enon seems to have been broadly based within the community (as it was at Vounous). Mortuary Display at Other Sites Although Vounous and Lapithos displayed simi- lar trends in mortuary consumption, it must be con- sidered whether the phenomena observed in these cemeteries were typical of other communities within and beyond the north coast region. For the most part, the evidence is problematic because few well- preserved tombs have been properly excavated else- where, and neither synchronic nor diachronic varia- tions in the treatment of the dead can be inferred from the existing samples. However, interesting similarities and differences in practices of display can nonetheless be discerned at sites throughout the island. The cemetery of Karmi Palealona is located mid- way between the cemeteries of Vounous and Lapithos. Most of the 13 tombs investigated here by Stewart seem to have been similar in plan to the tombs of Vounous, with one to three round or oval chambers of varying size entered via rectangular or bathtub-shaped dromoi.153 Tomb 3A had a compara- tively elaborate plan, with four semicircular burial niches similar to those seen to the west at Lapithos and in northeastern Cyprus at Korovia Paleo- skoutella and Ayios Iakovos Melia. Tomb 6 is no- table for the sculpture of a human figure in bas-relief in the dromos, as mentioned earlier. The only intact burial that Stewart published was found in tomb 11B, or the "Tomb of the Seafarer," a small (1.4 x 1.0 m) chamber with an extremely cramped single burial equipped with a knife, a hook-tang weapon, a faience bead, six locally made pots, and an imported Minoan Kamares cup.154 This burial is of particular interest because it attests to the inclu- 152 It is worth noting that the floor plans of many of the Lapithos tombs were extremely elaborate, with intricate struc- tural features such as buttresses, lobes, and semicircular raised burial niches cut back from the chamber walls, as illustrated in fiff. 2 here. 153 Stewart 1962b, fig. 1. 154 Stewart 1962b, figs. 2-12, pls. 1-11.</page><page sequence="39">2005] DEATH, PRESTIGE, AND COPPER IN BRONZE AGE CYPRUS 379 Table 11.

Far more lavish mortuary festivities may have been undertaken in the community of Vasilia Kafkallia, located west of Lapithos along the north coast. Five tombs with rectangular chambers, pillar-like but- tresses, rectangular wall niches, facades decorated with rectangular pillars, and lime-plastered dromoi up to 8 m in length were investigated by Stewart at this site.155 Although unique stone transverse walls were built in the dromoi, apparently to impede ac- cess to the burials, the tombs were partially looted. The grave goods remaining included a "magnifi- cent" deposit of copper objects, including three heavy armbands, a unique dagger, two knives, two toggle pins, alabaster vases, gold earrings, and large quantities of smashed pottery. Unfortunately, the dating of the Vasilia tombs has long been contro- versial.156 Following Stewart, Hennessy et al. have argued that the complex architecture of the tombs and the sophisticated metal finds from the dromos of tomb 1 imply a date of ECIII or the late third millennium B.C.157 If correct, the elaboration of the Vasilia tombs appears consistent with the trend to- ward increasing mortuary expenditure and competi- tive displays evident at Lapithos and in the later tombs of Vounous. Yet based on the anomalous tomb archi- tecture and the tomb finds, Webb and Frankel have recently argued that the Vasilia tombs are part of the much earlier Philia facies, concurrent or perhaps even earlier than the ECI tombs of Vounous.158 If so, this would suggest that Vasilia had highly elaborated mortuary rites from the onset of the Bronze Age, along with significant access to copper resources and other valuables consumed in mortuary display. Other indications of large-scale mortuary expen- diture come from communities of the central Mesaoria plain and the northern Troodos foothills. Approximately half of the EC-MC tombs excavated at Katydhata and the nearby cemeteries of Linou Alonia and Ayii Saranta contained copper artifacts, and the range and quantities (up to 14 items per 155 See Stewart 1957, 1962a; Hennessy et al. 1988. A num- ber of pit tombs have also been reported nearby (Hennessy et al. 1988, 25). Manning (1993, 45) sees the co-occurrence of these relatively simple burial features with the more elaborate chamber tombs nearby as evidence for well-developed social hierarchy. Unfortunately, the pit tombs were never investi- gated and it is unclear if they were contemporaneous with the chamber tombs. If they were, they might alternatively repre- sent another example of a multistage ritual system in which the dead were initially interred in relatively simple burial fea- tures and then exhumed and reinterred in more elaborate tombs at a later date. 156Swiny 1985, 116; 1986a, 30; 1989, 26. 157 Hennessy et al. 1988, 26, 41. 158 Webb and Frankel 1999, 8, 11.</page><page sequence="40">380 PRISCILLA SCHUSTER KESWANI [AJA109 chamber) of metal types was comparable to the dis- tributions observed at Vounous B and the middle chronological group of tombs from Lapithos. 159 It is more difficult to assess the scale of metal consump- tion in the vicinity of Dhenia, where so many of the tombs have been looted over the years. It is clear that some of the most architecturally elaborate tombs at Dhenia Kafkalla had large deposits of pot- tery and other small finds, presumably deposited in conjunction with costly mortuary festivities.160 Al- though the contents of most of the 50 EC-MC tombs opened by Ohnefalsch-Richter in the vicinity of Politiko have never been completely reported, 161 it is apparent that some of the tombs in this area were extremely rich. Politiko Lambertis tombs 16 and 18 contained silver bracelets, and tombs 16 and 21 con- tained small gold ornaments.162 Politiko Choma- zoudhia tomb 3, a relatively small (1.60 x 1.40 x 1.40 m) tomb dated to MCII and used for at least 10 burials, yielded approximately 500 pots; 60 copper- based objects, including daggers, flat axes, twee- zers; 1 tin-bronze shafthole axe of possible foreign workmanship; and horse and dog bones.163 The rich hoard of copper and bronze objects, including 2 shafthole axes allegedly from nearby Pera (and pos- sibly deriving from one or more looted tombs),164 may also have been deposited in extravagant mor- tuary displays. A similar picture emerges from sites located fur- ther to the east, despite the problems of looting and the scanty recording of many early excavations conducted here. Nicosia Ayia Paraskevi tomb 8 (of MCII-III date) appears to have been quite rich in ceramics (more than 300 in its principal chamber), lead (20 spiral ring fragments), and faience (608 beads), despite being fairly poor in copper finds.165 The presence of even richer mortuary complexes may be signaled by the alleged discovery of 2 tin- bronze shafthole axes in the Nicosia area166 and the well-documented occurrence of a shafthole axe in the looted Dhali Kafkallia tomb G (which also yielded an undecorated bronze "warrior" belt) (fig. 16). 167 Other occurrences of shafthole axes have been reported in the Alambra region.168 Finds from Alambra Mouttes tomb 102, a relatively small and unimpressive tomb containing one disarticulated and one in situ burial, are also of considerable in- terest as they comprise many items found in far more elaborate tombs. The goods from this tomb included 14 pots, 1 copper-based axe, 1 hook-tang weapon, 1 pair of tweezers, 1 scraper or razor, 1 tin- bronze spiral ring, 1 whetstone, 2 bone needles, and cattle bones. These finds were apparently asso- ciated with the intact and later burial identified as an adult male.169 The evidence from this tomb and the "Tomb of the Seafarer" at Karmi suggests that the associated status goods were not the exclusive paraphernalia of a "weapon-bearing elite" but were, instead, prestige items to which most adult mem- bers (perhaps males in particular) of EC-MC com- munities aspired to own and take with them to their graves. Finally, the reported occurrence of horse teeth and bones in Kalopsidha tomb 9 and the re- covery of a number of copper-based items and im- ports of silver or lead and faience in Kalopsidha tomb II170 offer parallels for the type of mortuary consumption observed at Lapithos and Politiko to the west and north. The burial assemblages known from the north- eastern cemeteries of Korovia Paleoskoutella and Ayios Iakovos Melia appear remarkably poor relative to those of the northern and eastern sites just de- scribed.171 At both sites, large and elaborate tomb complexes were constructed, and collective second- ary burial celebrations were evidently staged. At Paleoskoutella, the two burials in tomb 4 were pro- vided with only 14 pots and 2 spindle whorls, with no metal items. The 14 burials in tomb 7 were provided with 102 pots of local origin, 11 small copper-based ornaments, 1 knife, 1 lead whorl, and other nonexotic small finds. Among the MC tombs of Ayios Iakovos, the quantities of valuables disposed of were also lim- 159 See catalogues in Astrom 1989; Flourentzos 1989. 160E.g., tomb 6, with 175 objects (Astrom and Wright 1962) and tomb 48 with 277 (Nicolaou and Nicolaou 1988) . i6i jror summary information, see Gjerstad 1926; Buchholz 1973; Buchholz and Untiedt 1996. 162 Astrom 1972, 151-2. 163 Gjerstad 1926, 81; Astrom 1972, 245; Buchholz 1973, 304-9; 1979, 77-8; Courtois 1986, 73. 164 Astrom 1977. 165Kromholz 1982, 16-8, 32-9. 166 Buchholz 1979, 78-9; see also Swiny 1982, 73-4; Cour- tois 1986, 73-4; Philip 1991, 80-3. lb/ Overbeck and Swmy 1972.

Both Philip and Courtois have interpreted the occurrence of these objects, singly and in pairs, as an indica- tion of the Cypriot adoption of "the standard symbols of power of the Levantine MBA" (Philip 1991, 85, 1995; see also Cour- tois 1986, 74-9; Keswani 1989a, 512-4). 168Cesnola 1877, pl. 5; Buchholz 1979, 79-80. 169 Decker and Barlow 1983, 83; Coleman 1996, 118-9. 170Myres 1897. 171 See Gjerstad et al.

Tomb 6 appears to have been the richest, with 134 pots (roughly 9 pots per burial) and 26 copper- based artifacts associated with its 15 burials (roughly 1.7 copper items per burial). The metal finds in- cluded circular metal discs with relief decoration, which have been identified as part of a Levantine type "warrior" belt.172 An unusually large concentra- tion (approximately 238) of faience beads was also found in this tomb, although exotic goods were oth- erwise extremely scarce throughout the cemetery. In general, it would seem that the remote locations of Paleoskoutella and Ayios Iakovos served to isolate these communities from the major sources of cop- per, as well as from long-distance exchange contacts. This may have limited the availability of metal and exotic goods and, in turn, the propensity to remove them from circulation in mortuary contexts. Variable levels of mortuary consumption are also apparent along the south coast of the island. Im- pressive collections of Red Polished pottery were found in the ECIII tombs excavated at Kition Chrysopolitissa and Kathari173 and in the MCI-II tombs found at Kition Ayios Prodromos. However, as Herscher has noted, metal objects were relatively scarce in comparison to those at Lapithos.174 Whether this is attributable to looting or to regional differences in wealth and mortuary customs remains unresolved, but it may be worth noting that another unprovenienced example of a shafthole axe is at- tributed to the Larnaca area,175 and fasteners de- rived from a bronze "warrior" belt are alleged to have been found in the vicinity of Klavdhia.176 Further to the west, at Kalavasos, the tremendous accumulations of wealth characteristic of some of the Lapithos tombs are also absent. However, basic measures of material expenditure, such as the mean numbers of pots and copper items per chamber (37.2 and 8.7, respectively) and mean numbers of pots and copper items per burial (22.0 and 3.9, respectively), compare favorably with and in some cases exceed the figures reported for Lapithos and Vounous. The two or more burials in tomb 37, dated to the MCII period, were provided with a total of 26 pots, 111 faience beads, 2 whetstones, and 17 cop- per-based objects, including 3 knives, 3 hook-tang weapons, 2 flat axes, 1 razor/scraper, 2 pairs of twee- zers, 1 pin or needle, 2 bracelets, and 3 unidenti- fied objects.177 An even more impressive MCII assemblage was found in conjunction with the seven or more burials in tomb 36; although only half ex- cavated, this tomb yielded 20 copper-based artifacts, including 3 knives, 2 hook-tang weapons, 3 razor/ scrapers, 1 awl, 1 pair of tweezers, 2 pins, 1 clothing ornament, and 7 other items of jewelry. Other finds included 2,608 faience beads, 1 macehead, and 1 whetstone.178 Among the ceramic finds from this tomb was a remarkable Red Polished III mottled-ware bowl with modeled figures possibly depicting scenes of breadmaking or winemaking,179 similar to other elaborate coroplastic ceremonial vessels found in northern communities such as Vounous and Marki. The collections of metal and other grave goods reported in the multi-chambered complexes of southwestern Episkopi Phaneromeni seem modest 172 Philip 1991,84; 1995, 145. 173 Karageorghis 1974. 174 Herscher 1988. 175Buchholz 1979,82. 176 Philip 1991,85; Courtois 1986, 75 and n. 33. The knife, hook-tang weapon, and pin recovered from an ECIII/MCI tomb excavated at Tersephanou near Arpera (Flourentzos 2001) further attest to the availability of copper in this region. 177 Todd 1986,141-2, 163. 178Todd 1986, 139-141, 163. 179 Todd 1986, 151-4, fig. 25:2, pls. 19:3, 19:4, 20-23.</page><page sequence="42">382 PRISCILLA SCHUSTER KESWANI [AJA109 in comparison to those of Kalavasos. Although Weinberg recovered roughly 80 pots from the 12 tombs he investigated, he found only a sparse quan- tity of metal items.180 In contrast, the 13 tombs res- cued by the WP in Kalavasos in 1978 yielded a total of 465 registered objects, of which over 50 were metal artifacts. Mortuary expenditure at Episkopi may therefore have been focused more intensively on tomb architecture than on the disposal of material wealth. However, a somewhat different picture emerges from the Limassol area, where communi- ties may have enjoyed more favorable access to metal sources. Among the four tombs excavated at the lo- cality of Limassol Ayios Nikolaos in the 1940s, tomb 1 had a fairly rich array of finds, including 21 pots, 3 spindle whorls, 4 copper-based pins, 2 needles, 1 knife, a dagger, 1 pair of tweezers, and 1 elaborate necklace made of blue-paste beads and cylindrical spiral bronze beads.181 Also in the Limassol region, an impressive collection of copper-based artifacts was recovered from tomb 21, a single burial tomb in the large EC-MC cemetery near Pyrgos Mavrorachi; finds included 2 axes, 3 knives, 2 pairs of tweezers, 2 chis- els, 1 awl, 1 scraper, 1 necklace, 1 bracelet, and 1 ring.182 Recent archaeometallurgical analyses em- ploying energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence have identified 7 of these items as tin-bronze alloys.183 Among the other finds from this tomb were approxi- mately 70 pots, a faience necklace, several whetstones and mace-heads, and a grinding stone. Belgiorno suggests that this may have been the burial of a cop persmith, given the presence of so many groundstone tools that could have been used in finishing metal objects, and the seemingly perfect condition of some of the metal finds. If this is the case, it is interesting to note that hook-tang weapons were not provided, suggesting that such items were not an integral part of a craftsman's burial complement. This rich array of goods seems to illustrate the special prestige asso- ciated with metallurgical expertise and a strong pro- pensity for conspicuous mortuary consumption.184 Mortuary Ritual, Prestige Displays, and the Construction of Social Status in the Early-Middle Cypriot Periods The mortuary evidence from the cemeteries of Bellapais Vounous and Lapithos Vrysi tou Barba strongly suggests that differences in wealth and so- cial prestige existed within these communities throughout the EC-MC periods. Some of the tomb complexes at these sites are truly outstanding in terms of their size and architectural elaboration, as well as in the quantity and diversity of the metal, ceramic, faunal, and imported goods they con- tained. The burial assemblages of these tombs are distinctive, but not because they contain particular prestige symbols that were unattainable by other members of the community.185 Qualitative differen- tiation in status paraphernalia between groups is difficult to discern, with most of the items (ex- cept for imported goods) present in the richest complements overall being broadly distributed throughout the cemeteries. Instead, two factors dis- tinguish the richest tombs from others of lesser wealth: (1) the presence of diverse arrays of items that may be classified as valuable, exotic, or ceremo- nial in nature; and (2) the overall quantity and re- dundancy of metal types present. Both of these distinctions - diversity and quantity - were probably significantly affected by the number of burials in the tomb chamber, as well as by the relative wealth of a group. Even though the quantitative variations in metal wealth between tomb groups may seem remarkable (e.g., the range of 0-80 copper-based items per chamber observed among the latest tombs at Lapithos), the differences between groups ap- pear graded and continuous rather than discrete or stepped (especially in the latest period) when variation in the number of burials per chamber is controlled (fig. 17). This kind of distribution of wealth and status symbols tends to be found in com- munities with fluctuating hierarchical relations between groups and a high degree of social com- petition rather than in societies characterized by a rigid status hierarchy.186 It is also evident that mortuary expenditure, as measured both by energy investment in tomb con- struction and material outlays, increased over time. The median and mean values for chamber tomb floor area, pots per burial, and copper items per burial rose dramatically between the earlier and later periods at both Vounous and Lapithos, sug- gesting that the propensity for increasing mortuary 180Weinberg 1956, 121. Swiny (1986b, 88) also notes the paucity of metal in unlooted or partially unlooted tombs exca- vated by the Missouri and Kent State expeditions; overall, there were only three burials with weapons and seven burials with a total of seven pins and one needle. 181 Karageorghis 1958, 143-6. 182 Belgiorno 1997; Giardino 2000, 28-9. 183Giardino et al. 2002; see table 13 here for types. 184 For other disturbed tombs excavated between 1941 and 1954, see Beladorno 2002. 185 -phis contrasts sharply with the distribution of prestige symbols in Late Cypriot mortuary contexts, where the highest order valuables such as gold signet rings, Mycenaean pictorial craters, and ivories with carved pictorial designs display an ex- tremely restricted distribution; see Keswani 1989a, 1989b, 2004. 186 See discussion in Rathje 1973; Shennan 1986.</page><page sequence="43">2005] DEATH, PRESTIGE, AND COPPER IN BRONZE AGE CYPRUS 383 Fig. 17. Copper wealth at Lapithos. This graph illustrates the increasing number of copper items per burial through time, calculated by dividing the total number of copper items in each chamber by the estimated number of burials in each chamber. expenditure was broadly based within the commu- nity. It is not simply the case that a few elite groups were expending a great deal more in material dis- play in the later periods; rather, a large number of kin groups were expending more over time. These gross increases in mortuary expenditure, like the increasing elaboration of mortuary ritual in gen- eral, would seem to reflect rising levels of prestige competition within the community at large and the growing centrality of mortuary ritual as an arena for the construction of social status. The ongoing process of prestige competition is perhaps most vividly illustrated by the increases in the frequencies of particular metal types. Another indication is the size patterning of the so-called hook-tang weapons (fig. 15), which were the heavi- est, most ubiquitous, and most impressive items of copper found in EC-MC tombs.187 Table 12 shows that copper items in general, and most individual copper types, became more widely distributed at Vounous and Lapithos over time. Figure 18 details the frequencies of hook-tang weapons by length in successive chronological periods at Lapithos. Not only did the frequencies of these weapons increase through time, but the mean size of the weapons and the variation in size also increased. Apparently, as 187 As noted earlier (supra n. 132), these objects have been interpreted most convincingly as spearheads (Philip 1991). Philip (1991, 68-9) suggests that they may have been (male) gendered status symbols associated with hunting or warfare. It might be speculated, very tentatively, that their use or display was associated with the attainment of a certain age or age group membership; the prestige of individuals within these groups may have depended on achievements in hunting or some other challenge rather than elite status or identity. The ongoing importance of hunted animals in prehistoric Bronze Age Cyprus is attested by ceramic figurines of deer and figures of deer attached to pots (Karageorghis 1991, 102-5, 148-50) , as well as in the frequent occurrence of fallow deer remains (Dama mesopotamica) in settlement contexts. Deer bones, for example, comprised approximately one-fifth of the faunal assemblages, representing at least as much if not more of the total meat consumed, at Sotira Kaminoudhia, Marki Alonia, and Alambra Mouttes (Croft 1996, 223; see also Reese 1996; Croft 2003). However, identified occurrences of deer in mortuary contexts are rare; the animals offered to the dead, and probably also consumed by the funeral guests, were most often cattle, sheep, or goats (Keswani 1994; 2004, tables 4.7a-c, 4.11a-c).</page><page sequence="44">384 PRISCILLA SCHUSTER KESWANI [AJA109 Table 12.

Some of the weapons were so large (up to 66 cm in length) that they were not easy to haft or use, rendering them effectively "baroque," as one analyst has dubbed them.188 When it became difficult to make the weap- ons any larger or more impressive, new material ex- pressions of prestige may have been required. This may be why some groups effectively embroidered their metal assemblages with a more diverse array of utilitarian implements, adding chisels, spatulas, awls, and needles. In the most flamboyant episodes of display, copper axe ingots were included, some of which may have been family heirlooms.189 It is impossible at present to document increases in the quantities of copper wealth in mortuary con- texts outside of Vounous and Lapithos; however, it is clear that lavish displays were under way in the Politiko, Kalavasos, and the Pyrgos-Limassol areas at the same time that celebratory consumption on the north coast was escalating (i.e., from the ECIIIB/ MCI transitional period onward). Moreover, de- spite regional variations in ceramic wares, tomb architecture, and wealth consumption, geographi- cally disparate communities seem to have shared a common set of ritual and prestige symbolism. This is suggested by the island-wide distribution of dis- tinctive metal types, ceremonial vessels, and genre scenes. Participation in the mortuary rituals of kin- speople, allies, and exchange partners in other communities most likely contributed to the diffu- sion of ritual practices and status paraphernalia; mortuary celebrations and prestige displays ob- served by visitors in one community were probably emulated and, when possible, surpassed when the visitors subsequently staged their own rituals. Com- petition between groups within a community en- sured that innovative modes of ritual display were imitated at home, and certain items (such as hook- tang weapons) became the basic prestige symbols to which certain age and gender groups aspired, rather than the private paraphernalia of an heredi- tary "weapon-bearing elite."190 The highly competitive nature of EC- MC mortu- ary rituals helps explain the appearance of ex- tremely rich burial complexes during a period when there is a marked absence of other material correlates of sociopolitical complexity, such as settle- ment hierarchies, tributary networks, elite residen- tial architecture, and monumental public buildings. The above analysis of mortuary data suggests that prestige differentials were graded and negotiable rather than rigidly hierarchical during the EC-MC periods. Mortuary ritual was a major arena in which social status might be affirmed and contested. The prestige distinctions expressed in the context of funerary displays were not yet institutionalized struc- tures of social life and economic production. How- ever, due to the escalating demand for copper and the emerging importance of imported goods in the context of prestige displays, the dynamics of mor- tuary competition may well have set the stage for transformations in economic and power relations at the onset of the LC period. 188 Philip 1991,68. 189Frankel and Webb (2000, 35-6) opine that three flat axes with pierced butts from Lapithos tomb 322A (nos. 23, 6, 62) may have been made much earlier than ECIII/MCI based on the discovery of a parallel mold S850 in a Philia context at Marki Alonia; see also Fasnacht and Wagner 2000, 41 . 190 See also Phillip 1991, 69; cf.

Both the quantities and the lengths of these weapons increased through time. COPPER PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION IN THE PREHISTORIC BRONZE AGE Some scholars have argued that the expansion of the copper industry in Cyprus was associated with the arrival of the Philia colonists familiar with Anatolian metalworking techniques.191 While a handful of small copper items have been found in Chalcolithic contexts, recent chemical and metal- lographic analyses have raised questions as to whether any of these objects were made in Cyprus.192 It is only with the appearance of the Philia facies that copper objects came to form a significant part of the local Cypriot technological and ceremonial repertoire. This is attested by the numerous metal types that have been found primarily in tombs: knives, daggers, axes, awls, razors or scrapers, toggle pins, earrings, and other ornaments.193 Some of these objects (particularly the knives with pierced tangs and flattened mid-ribs, conical-headed toggle pins, and spiral earrings) have parallels at Anatolian sites such as Tarsus and Karatas-Semayuk.194 How- ever, in contrast with the situation in much of EBII Anatolia, where the use of tin was quite common,195 the vast majority of Philia and EC-MC metal items seem to have been made of unalloyed or arsenical copper.196 Tin deposits do not occur in Cyprus; the few tin-bronze objects found in Philia contexts197 may have been imports or, given the otherwise lim- ited evidence for trade, heirlooms from Anatolia. The earliest direct evidence for copper smelting in Cyprus may derive from Kissonerga Mosphilia; here, lumps of copper ore, fragments of two possible crucibles, and fragments of pure smelted copper were found in Late Chalcolithic and Philia settle- ment contexts (periods 4-5). 198 Swiny has argued that an unforged billet of a knife or dagger from 191 Swiny 1982, 71; Frankel et al. 1996; Webb and Frankel 1999, 40.

Interestingly, how- ever, Yakar (1985, 35) alludes to a scarcity of tin-bronze in Cilicia, specifically at Tarsus, in EBII and especially EBIII. 196 On the practice, benefits, and frequency of making ar- senical copper alloys and/ or the production of unalloyed cop- per from ores with arsenical impurities, see Balthazar 1990, 71- 2, Gale et al. 1996, 374; Giardino et al. 2003, 387-8. 197 Four spiral earrings or earring fragments from the Philia phase tomb 6 at Sotira Kaminoudhia were made of tin-bronze or copper containing some tin (Swiny 2003, 376-7). Swiny (2003, 379) suggests that alloys may have been used to make these non-utilitarian ornaments because the resulting color would have resembled gold (see also Giardino et al. 2002, 47; Giardino et al. 2003, 389). Most presently identified tin- bronzes of prehistoric Bronze Age date come from ECIII/MCI or later contexts (Balthazar 1990, 73; Gale et al. 1996, 373-4) . 198 Croft et al. 1998, 188-9.</page><page sequence="46">386 PRISCILLA SCHUSTER KESWANI [AJA109 tomb 6 at Sotira Kaminoudhia may be evidence for the local casting of copper objects at this site dur- ing the Philia phase.199 Other early evidence for casting comes from Marki Alonia, where three in- complete chalk molds for making axes or axe- shaped ingots were found.200 The largest of these molds, S850, was built into the earliest wall found at Marki, dating to the early part of the Philia phase. The other two were incorporated in walls of ECIII or MCI date. The object cast in S850 would have been a large flat axe with a domed pierced butt and a weight of approximately 950-1,050 g, similar to three axes found in Lapithos Vrysi tou Barba tomb 322A. The two smaller molds, S744 and S745, could have been used to produce flat axes with weights of 460-500 g and 220 g, respectively.201 Fasnacht and Wagner propose that these molds attest to the sur- plus production of copper ingots intended for dis- tribution beyond the site of Marki; the piercing of the axe butts may have allowed the alignment of the axes on a string during transport.202 Traces of copper smelting or other phases of metal working have not been found elsewhere at Marki, which lies near the copper ore sources of Kambia, Mathiatis, and Sia, but the discovery of the molds is enough to suggest that metallurgical activity was carried on in the vicinity of the site from its earliest occupation. Evidence for at least small-scale copper smelting and casting activities were discovered in settlement remains at Alambra Mouttes, located in the north- eastern foothills of the Troodos Mountains. The ex- cavation of eight probable houses and adjacent areas dating to the early part of the MC period yielded 3 fragmentary molds, 16 crucible fragments (9 with adhering slag), 16 copper-rich mineral samples, and 17 pieces of slag.203 Analyses of the metallurgical finds suggest that secondarily enriched copper car- bonate ores containing azurite and malachite were being smelted in the crucibles. The high copper content of the carbonate ores (10%-50% copper, compared to the 0.5%-4.5% typically found in the massive copper sulfide ore deposits of the Troodos ophiolite complex) would have permitted produc- tion of copper with relatively small amounts of slag.204 The location of the Alambra settlement on the edge of a sedimentary formation may have been deter- mined at least in part by the proximity of such ores, which are formed when water draining oxidized sulfides and carrying copper in solution runs over chalks and limestone. Coleman argues that the cop- per-working activity within the excavated area A was not extensive and probably served, at most, to sup- ply the immediate needs of the Alambra residents themselves.205 The types of objects cast in the Alambra molds have not been identified. Further evidence for copper mining, smelting, refining, and the production of copper axes comes from the MCI settlement at Ambelikou Aletri in the northwestern Troodos, excavated by the Department of Antiquities in 1942.206 The architectural remains at this site were not extensively investigated, but at least one rambling complex of irregularly shaped rooms was defined in area I.207 Excavations in area I yielded a small, hollow, terracotta object (possibly from the nozzle of a bellows used in smelting) and a double-sided terracotta mold thought to have been used for casting copper axes. Area II yielded two stratified lumps of copper ore and a coarse clay cru- cible. Analyses by Zwicker indicated that the latter object was probably used for remelting copper prills produced in prior smelting with the aid of a man- ganese-oxide flux.208 The excavation foreman also noted possible smelting workshops on the rocky outcrops adjacent to area II.209 Red Polished III sherds similar to those found in the settlement were discovered in the galleries of the Ambelikou mine complexes northeast of Aletri, providing the earli- est direct evidence for mining activity in Cyprus.210 The ore from these mines has been described as medium-grain sulfide ore,211 which may have been exploited at approximately the same time as the carbonate ores mined in the Alambra region. Recent excavations at Pyrgos Mavrorachi in south central Cyprus provide more direct evidence for the labor-intensive smelting of copper sulfide ores212 at an early date.

Mace hammers, heavy ring hammers, and mortars found at the site may have been used in mining copper ores located nearby. A large court used as a copper-smelting workshop, with differ- ent types of furnaces and work areas, may date as far back as the EC period. Concentrations of slag, grind- ing stones, and furnace fragments outside the ex- cavated area possibly constitute evidence for at least four similar workshops on the site. Within the ex- cavated area, evidence has been reported for di- verse metallurgical operations, including the crushing of ores with stone tools, the smelting of copper (using iron oxides as a flux) in four large circular furnaces built of stone and mudbrick, the hammering and washing of the slag to remove cop- per droplets and prills, the melting of copper in pit furnaces prior to casting, and the finishing of copper objects using whetstones. While copper carbonate outcrops have been noted within 300 m of the site, metallographic and X-ray diffraction analyses of slag revealed the presence of copper sulfides.214 The copper produced at this settlement almost certainly exceeded local requirements, and given the highly specialized nature of the activities carried on it is perhaps not surprising that the metal- rich burial in Pyrgos tomb 21 included the tools of a coppersmith. The above discussion serves to highlight both the widespread nature and the variable scale of Bronze Age metallurgical activity. At some sites, such as MC Alambra Mouttes, copper production may have been geared primarily toward the fulfillment of lo- cal needs. Elsewhere, as at Marki Alonia, some level of copper production for purposes of exchange could well have been under way as early as the Phila phase, continuing through the EC period. The ap- parently extensive metallurgical operations involv- ing sulfide ores at Pyrgos Mavrorachi suggest that the production of surplus copper was also under way in the southern Troodos during the EC-MC periods, perhaps as early as the Philia phase. How much of this surplus was intended for local exchange and how much was deliberately pro- duced for export overseas is presently a problem- atic question. Textual references from Mari and Babylon indicate that these Near Eastern polities were obtaining copper from Cyprus (referred to as Alashiya) during the 18th century B.C.215 However, the frequency and volume of this trade in the MC period remains a matter for speculation. If the quantity of imported goods in Cyprus (table 13) and of Cypriot pottery abroad216 are valid proxies, its scale was fairly limited before MCIII. Without dep- recating the social and ideological importance of earlier exchange contacts, it could be argued that Cypriot long-distance trade prior to MCIII-LCI was more sporadic than systematic. The principal stimu- lus for the development of the copper industry in Bronze Age Cyprus was probably local consumption and exchange, including the provisioning of those regions of the island that were far from its copper resources. Indeed, some of these distant communi- ties (e.g., Lapithos) were the most conspicuous con- sumers of copper in Cyprus. Despite the extent and the scale of Philia and EC-MC metallurgical activity at some sites, the quantities and types of finished metal goods found in settlement contexts suggest that copper re- mained a scarce and highly valued resource throughout this era. Table 14 summarizes the types and frequencies of copper objects recovered from settlement excavations in Cyprus to date. In con- trast to the rich assemblages of copper-based arti- facts recovered from mortuary contexts (consisting of large numbers of hook-tang weapons, knives, razors or scrapers, tweezers, pins, and other tools and ornaments), the majority of the items recov- ered from settlement contexts are complete or fragmentary pins and needles, with less numer- ous occurrences of other fragmentary tools such as knives, scrapers, axes, chisels, and awls. The presence of these objects suggests that copper tools were used for a variety of utilitarian tasks. But the fact that relatively small numbers of mainly small and fragmentary items predominate in the settlement finds implies that larger, usable tools were curated and reused over extended periods of time and discarded only when they were utterly useless.217 Broken items of any significant size were my calculations, extrapolated from Constantinou's figures, the production of that amount of charcoal would require the fell- ing and chopping of six 80- to 100-year-old pine trees even before the process of copper extraction began. 213SeeBelgiorno (2000) andGiardino (2000) for the prelim- inary reports. 214Giardino 2000, 21-3. 215Dossin 1939, 1965; Millard 1973; Knapp 1979, 179-181; 1996b, 17-20. 216Popham 1963; Merrillees 1968, 1977, 1992, 2002; Oren 1969; Saltz 1977,Johnson 1982; Catling and MacGillivray 1983. 217 See Webb (1995) for an extensive discussion of curation atMarkiAlonia.</page><page sequence="48">388 PRISCILLA SCHUSTER KESWANI [AJA109 Table 13.

Interestingly, at some localities, such as MC Alambra Mouttes, and even at the LCIA settlement at Episkopi Phaneromeni, stone tools such as axes and adzes apparently continued in use along with metal tools, supplementing or sub- stituting for metal tools when these were unavail- able or considered too precious for everyday use.218 However, both of these settlements have also yielded evidence for at least small-scale copper production and casting. As copper items remained in circulation over extended periods of time and could be substituted with tools made of other materials, the demand for replacement metal in the realm of utilitarian consumption was probably fairly low. Much greater demands on copper producers and copper ex- change networks may instead have been exerted in the realm of ceremonial consumption, where weaponry, tools, toilet articles, and personal orna- ments were subject to very different patterns of use and discard. In this context, ceremonial con- sumption does not refer exclusively to mortuary consumption. Although some copper objects (e.g., knives and daggers) may have been newly made for use as grave goods,219 many of the metal goods found in Cypriot tombs were probably wielded and worn on other festive occasions - when they might be admired, envied, or emulated by others in at- tendance - before they were disposed of in the mortuary context. The role of copper items in lo- cal and regional exchange systems must have been of equal importance, helping to secure the flow of marriage partners, livestock, and manufactured goods such as pottery and cloth within and between communities.220 However, the mortuary context was the last stop for many metal goods, some of which were ceremonially damaged or "killed" before be- ing deposited with the dead.221 This had impor- tant ramifications because mortuary consumption ultimately took those goods out of circulation and created an ongoing need for replacement much greater than the need for replacement of tools in everyday use. As consumption escalated in mortu- ary contexts, activities relating to copper produc- tion and exchange must necessarily have been intensified. That some of the richest tomb collections came from sites far from the copper mines of the Troodos attests to the responsiveness of copper producers to increasing ceremonial demand, as well as to the effectiveness of the exchange networks moving copper between mining regions and coastal areas before the development of urban polities and of- ficially administered tributary systems. The rela- tionships between coastal communities that consumed large quantities of copper, such as Lapithos, and the producer communities supply- ing their metal needs may have been based on kin- ship, affinal ties, and interpersonal exchange partnerships (the same social networks the founders of LC coastal centers relied upon initially to obtain copper for overseas trade). By manipulat- ing these traditional alliance networks and offer- ing new types of prestige goods, emergent urban elites may have stimulated further surplus produc- tion in all copper-producing communities.222 Thus the growth of the prehistoric Bronze Age system of copper production and exchange was fueled significantly at the outset by the demands of the local ceremonial system, and this set the stage for the further transformation and reorganization of the copper industry that followed in the LC Bronze Age. 218Coleman (1996) reports that 14 stone axes were recov- ered from stratified contexts at Alambra, and roughly the same number was found in surfaces surveys; 2 stone adzes were also found. At Episkopi Phaneromeni (Swiny 1986b) , 1 3 stone axes, an adze, and a flaked cutting tool were found. Coleman argues that these and other lithic finds suggest a strong reliance on stone tools for building construction, chopping firewood, agri- cultural activities, food preparation, the digging and prepara- tion of copper ores, and tomb cutting. Stone axes appear to have been used for tomb cutting until late in the MC period at Lapithos, likewise at Episkopi Phaneromeni (Herscher 1978, 713-4; Coleman 1996, 143-8). 219 Swiny (1986b, 88). Giardino et al. (2002, 44) also note that two tin-bronze daggers from Pyrgos tomb 21 show casting defects and were probably made for symbolic purposes rather than actual use. 220 The paramount importance of copper as a commodity in exchange and display may also explain why the composition of many copper artifacts is inconsistent with the exigencies of practical use; e.g., there was the occasional use of strengthen- ing tin and arsenical alloys for personal ornaments, and the only occasional use of such alloys for tools in everyday use (Swiny 1982; Balthazar 1990, 430-2) . It may further explain why cop- per axes display little or no evidence for hafting (Balthazar 1990,360). 221 Stewart 1962a, 294; Astrom 1987, with further references. 222 Recent excavations at Politiko Phorades in the northern Troodos foothills have revealed the presence of a small-scale, probably seasonal, smelting operation, dating to the LCI period. Knapp (2003, 562-4) suggests that many other such mining camps probably existed, and that while there is no direct evi- dence that Phorades or other such sites were officially adminis- tered, some of these enterprises may have become increasing specialized and of more extended duration as the Late Bronze Age progressed.</page><page sequence="52">392 PRISCILLA SCHUSTER KESWANI [AJA109 THE SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF A CONVERGENCE: THE CYPRIOT RITUAL SYSTEM AND LONG- DISTANCE TRADE The establishment of LC urban polities and the emergence of Cyprus as a major player in the east- ern Mediterranean copper trade resulted from the convergence of the local Cypriot ritual system with impinging foreign interests in Cypriot copper re- sources. The dynamics of local systems of mortuary display and prestige competition had a number of important, interwoven ramifications that both in- vited and were transformed by the introduction of foreign prestige goods and elite ideologies. Escalating prestige displays were an ongoing stimulant to the expansion of copper-producing capabilities. An unintended consequence of dis- play and production expansion would have been an increasing visibility and reputation of Cypriot copper resources among foreign traders who made landfall on the island. Any foreign visitor to one of the more elaborate EC-MC funerals would surely have had tales to tell about the riches of copper interred with the dead, and such accounts may well have inspired deliberate future trading visits. Cypriots themselves may also have touted their island's rich copper resources when traveling over- seas. Thus it may be no coincidence that the quan- tities of imported valuables found in Cypriot tombs began to increase at the ECIIIB/MCI transition, when mortuary consumption also escalated signifi- cantly. With the breakdown of the older exchange networks through which Near Eastern and Egyp- tian polities had previously acquired their copper, traders from these regions would have had ample justification for seeking alternative supplies in Cyprus.223 Concurrently, the intensification of local pres- tige competition would have created a demand within Cypriot communities for new forms of status symbolism. Many researchers have noted the ten- dency for competitive status seekers to emulate the prestige goods of higher status groups; this prompts these higher status groups to further elaborate their paraphernalia along what Cannon has referred to as a trajectory of "expressive redundancy."224 When the panache of current prestige symbols becomes diluted by their general availability, and when in- creasing the size and ornamentation of those sym- bols is no longer feasible, social aspirants must ei- ther retreat from display altogether or find new and innovative ways of asserting their status. In the con- text of social competition in early second millen- nium Cyprus, goods of non-local origin may have been highly valued because of their scarcity, exotic allure, and association with foreign elites (whose material culture and ideology may have been per- ceived as more prestigious).225 In identifying with the values and ideology of foreign elites, emergent Cypriot leaders may have begun to posit new status distinctions between themselves and other members of their communities and to create an ideological basis for institutionalized social inequality.226 Although imports were probably too rare to have formed essential components of Cypriot prestige symbolism for much of the EC-MC periods, by the second half of the MC period, quantities of imports and foreign-influenced valuables seem to have been on the rise; many of these items were rich in sym- bolic content and associations. The occurrence of at least eight shafthole axes from the vicinities of Politiko, Pera, Nicosia, Alambra, and Idalion adja- cent to the copper-mining zones of the Troodos and from the Larnaca area227 is particularly notable. Similar axes and "warrior belts" were important paraphernalia in contemporary, high-status "war- rior" burials in Syria-Palestine, with the best paral- lels coming from MBII tombs at Ras Shamra.228 Both the tin content and the craftsmanship of the shafthole axes render them distinct from contem- poraneous Cypriot products, and it is conceivable that they were made by Near Eastern craftsmen work- ing in Cyprus or abroad.229 Axes, in addition to their utilitarian importance, may have been major units of copper exchange from the onset of the Philia facies. The shafthole axes would have been further valued for their more elaborate form and quality, as well as for their symbolic linkage with more power- ful foreign elites. Similarly, traditional sacrifices of livestock may have taken a new turn with the intro- duction of horses, which were important status sym- bols for Syrian and Babylonian elites; horses were slaughtered in a few notably elaborate MC mortu- ary events.230 The importance of axes, horses, and other Near Eastern prestige symbols may have been 223Klengel 1984; Knapp 1986a. 224Cannon 1989; see also Pollock 1982; Parker Pearson 1984. ^ Leach 1954; Flanneiy 1968; Wheatley 1975; Renfrew 1986; Brumfiel and Earle 1987, 8; Helms 1988. 226 See Wheatley (1975, 238-9) for similar developments in Southeast Asia. 227 These are summarized in Buchholz 1979; several other examples have no provenience. 228Courtois 1986, 74; Philip 1991, 80-5, 1995. ^ySwiny 1982, 73-4; Astrom 1972, 245. 230Sasson 1966; Courtois 1986, 74.</page><page sequence="53">2005] DEATH, PRESTIGE, AND COPPER IN BRONZE AGE CYPRUS 393 transmitted in part through personal interactions with foreigners; such symbols may additionally have been conveyed through the observation of Near Eastern iconography, especially glyptics (which sometimes depicted warriors and gods with axes and other weapons, as well as with regal parapher- nalia such as maces).231 Syrian and Old Babylonian cylinder seals probably made their first appearance in Cyprus during the later MC period; they seem to have remained in circulation for several genera- tions, presumably as highly valued heirlooms, be- fore being deposited in LC tombs at Enkomi and other sites.232 Shafthole axes, maces, cylinder seals, horses, and other imported valuables displayed on ceremonial occasions had the potential to set their bearers apart from others with a symbolism not in- herent in locally produced goods. Once initiated, the use of exotic goods in pres- tige displays offered aspiring leaders yet another means of enhancing their political power. Leaders who could provide exotic goods to their support- ers and allies would enhance their own prestige. Those who could parlay their special long-distance exchange relationships into exclusive access to for- eign prestige goods would have advanced their political positions even further.233 This would have necessitated both the control of outgoing copper and the access of foreign traders to the inland re- gions where it was produced. The assertion of such control, through the establishment of coastal em- poria where overseas exchanges were mediated, cre- ated the material basis for a new hierarchical social order characterized by unequal access to foreign valuables and copper resources. The realization of this scenario can be discerned in the changing local and regional distribution pat- terns of copper and exotic goods in tombs of the LC period. Exotic goods seem to have replaced cop- per objects in high- and middle-status mortuary as- semblages from approximately LCIB through LCIIB. Copper weapons and other copper goods occurred primarily in the richest tomb groups (con- trasting with the less restrictive EC-MC distribu- tional pattern), suggesting that copper resources were under tight control. Imported pottery, gold, silver, ivory, faience, glass, and other exotic goods were more broadly distributed; however, the distri- bution of the highest order valuables - the heaviest, most ornately worked, and most iconographically rich objects - was limited to the overall wealthiest groups within the major centers, such as those at Enkomi, Kition, Hala Sultan Tekke, Kalavasos, and Kourion. Moreover, very few of the highest order exotic valu- ables found their way inland during the LC period (contrasting, e.g., with distributional patterning of shafthole axes in the MC period). Lower order ex- otics must have constituted an important element of wealth finance, facilitating the flow of copper through internal exchange networks, but the most important valuables remained in the hands of the now prominent coastal elites.234 CONCLUSIONS Reconstructing the emergence of a complex society in Bronze Age Cyprus is a challenging en- terprise, especially given the absence of a textual base and the small number of excavations that have been conducted at settlement sites dating to the formative EC-MC periods. Far more extensive excavations of cemetery sites have taken place over the course of the past 150 years, but relatively few of these investigations were conducted in accordance with modern standards of scientific excavation, analysis, or reporting. Nevertheless, the existing evidence, with all its deficiencies, is a rich source of information concerning the ways in which Cyp- riot communities experienced and also influenced socioeconomic change through the enactment of their mortuary rituals. At the core of EC- MC Bronze Age mortuary prac- tice was an ideology emphasizing the veneration of communal and kin-group ancestors. This was re- flected in the use of permanent, spatially reserved, extramural cemeteries; in the use and reuse of pit and rock-cut chamber tombs for multiple burials; in the emergence of ritual programs involving sec- ondary treatment and collective reburial; and in the disposal of sizeable quantities of material wealth in both the actual tombs and in the ceremonial com- memorations of the dead. By ensuring that the de- ceased were accorded the appropriate ritual observances and equipped with all the goods re- 231 Stone maceheads were found in Swedish tombs 316 and 320 at Lapithos Vrysi tou Barba and in other Lapithos tombs excavated by Myres and Markides; they were also found in two MC-LC tombs at Ayios Iakovos Melia and in various tombs at Larnaca Laxia tou Riou and Katydhata (see Astrom 1972, 1 59) .

Yet the social ramifications of these mortuary celebrations went far beyond this; mortu- ary rituals were public events, where kin-group identities were reified, social alliances were cre- ated and renewed, status positions were negotiated through hospitality and competitive display, and the symbols and ideology of prestige were widely diffused and emulated. As funerary rites became increasingly elaborate, costly, and competitive over time, their consequences extended beyond the sphere of ritual activity and into the socioeconomic activities of daily life. Competitive mortuary celebra- tions stimulated the intensification of copper production and exchange, and ultimately created a new role for imported goods within the local prestige system. In turn, these developments laid the groundwork for far-reaching sociopolitical changes in the LC period, when certain groups of social entrepreneurs established new coastal centers and began to assert privileged, monopo- listic control over local and long-distance ex- changes involving copper. The status hierarchies negotiated through conspicuous mortuary display during the EC-MC periods were now under- pinned by differential access to and institutional- ized control over local copper supplies and imported valuables. The development of urban or town-centered polities in Late Bronze Age Cyprus has long been viewed as the product of impinging external in- fluences, specifically, the copper requirements of neighboring Near Eastern, Egyptian, and Aegean states, as well as the ideological impact of cultural interactions with these older civilizations. The con- sequences of such long-distance trade contacts in- cluded more intensive copper production, the establishment of coastal emporia, and the emer- gence of urban elites. While the importance of external influences cannot be discounted, what has been lacking heretofore is an understanding of why Cypriot communities were so responsive to external demands that necessitated both higher labor inputs in the sphere of economic produc- tion and greater inequality in social life. This pa- per has attempted to show how a foreign demand for copper, along with a Cypriot demand for the goods that foreign traders offered in exchange, played into indigenous systems of ritual and pres- tige competition. Because of their own internal dynamics and associated cultural values, these sys- tems had already created a productive infrastruc- ture and a social environment primed for further transformation. 33 FOXCROFT DRIVE PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY 08540 PKESWANI@COMCAST.NET Works Cited A Campo, A.L. 1994.
