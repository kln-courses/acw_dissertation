Reviewed by GREGORY BATESON Oceanic Institute, Hawaii This book contains ten previously un- published essays on a variety of aspects of pri- mate behavior. The contributing authors are: Desmond Morris, J. A. R. A. M. van Hooff, Wolfgang Wickler, John Sparks, Caroline Loi- zos, T. E. Rowell, M. Moynihan, R. A. Hinde and Y. Spencer-Booth, Jane van Lawick-Good- all, and N. G. Blurton Jones. The work is of the careful and high quality characteristic of modem ethology. Several essays are of immediate anthropolog- ical interest: Wickler's "Socio-sexual Signals and their Intra-specific Imitation among Pri- mates" starts from the hypothesis that the well-known coloration of the hindquarters of the male mandrill is mimetic of the hindquar- ters of a female in estrus. He suggests that this resemblance may function to enhance the effectiveness of the male's presenting posture. He points out that the organs that are colored in the male are not homologous to those colored in the female and that therefore the resem- blance cannot be due to shared genes. It would be interesting also to know whether the present- ing posture of the male is more than a poor im- itation (possibly even genotypically deter- mined) of that of the female, but Wickler does not discuss this. Whether or not the hypothesis is correct, the possibility of cross-sex mimicry and the consideration of the multiple alterna- tive determinants of analogous signaling devices are of great theoretical importance. Van Lawick-Goodall's fifty pages of data and fifteen photographs of mother-offspring rela- tionship in chimpanzees are beautiful and highly personal. One begins to feel acquain- tance with several individual animals, but if the anthropological reader wants material that he can apply to man, he must achieve his own synthesis. The data do not lend themselves to theory. In part, this difficulty is due to the very loose nature of the social organization of these chimpanzees, and anthropologists who have worked with extremely simple peoples will un- derstand the impasse. In part, however, the dif- ficulty may be due to the writer's evident need to chop the data into pieces small enough for statistical handling. It is interesting to note that these animals, who can particularize their rela- tionship to the environment to the point of evolving elementary "tools," are seemingly un- able to achieve particularity in regard to wounds and pains suffered by their infants. An infant in pain is simply hugged by the mother, who pays no visible attention to the wound. Loizos' review of the subject of play behav- ior gives the reader a fair picture of the variety of approaches that various authors have adopted when faced with these mysterious phe- nomena, so characteristic of man and other mammals. Nobody seems to have applied to these problems the dictum of Marshall MacLu- han that "the medium is the message." The fact of play between two organisms is surely, in it- self, an affirmation of a particular sort of posi- tive relationship. Pseudo-agonistic interaction is, of course, familiar to anthropologists from the peacemaking rituals of many primitive peoples. In general, it seems that primate communica- tion is somewhat more abstract than is dis- closed by these detailed studies. The animals seem to be mainly concerned with establishing or affirming patterns of relationship. Darwin's phrase "the expression of emotions" could al- most be translated today into "messages about relationship." Finally, a word must be said about "anthro- pomorphism." Modern ethologists are very much on their guard against the simple traps of "humanizing" primate facial expressions and so on. But there are more subtle dangers of which anthropologists are acutely aware. We know how fatal it can be to apply our (usually incor- rect) folk theories of psychology and sociology to cultures other than our own. The evolution- ists of the mid-nineteenth century incorporated the social theories of the Industrial Revolution into biological philosophy, and evolutionary biology as here exhibited has not yet been purged of this subtle anthropomorphism.</page></plain_text>
