<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Conflicted Legacy: Paul Sidney Martin as Museum Archaeologist 1925-38 Stephen E. Nash ABSTRACT Paul Sidney Martin excavated archaeological sites in southwestern Colorado for the State Historical Society of Colorado and the Field Museum of Natural History between 1927 and 1938, although he began working for museums in 1925. His work in three realms?research, exhibition and outreach, and collections?helped redefine the role of the museum anthropologist at a time when archaeological research, particularly that based in museums, was in transition away from the search for exhibition-quality objects and toward research-driven expeditions. With data gleaned from relevant archives, in this article I present previously unpublished details of Martin's work to suggest that Martin leaves behind a conflicted legacy from an important era in the development of North American archaeology. Keywords: Paul Sidney Martin, archives analysis, Southwestern archaeology, museum anthropology, Field Museum Paul Sidney Martin (see Figure 1) played an important role in the development of North American archae ological knowledge, method, and theory during the 20th century. During a career that spanned six decades, he ex cavated more than 100 archaeological sites and supervised nearly a dozen surveys in Wisconsin, Illinois, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona. He published 21 monographs, 15 peer-reviewed articles, two textbooks, 16 book reviews, and more than 120 popular articles. He collaborated with prominent archaeologists including Fay-Cooper Cole, Syl vanus Morley, and John Rinaldo. He helped train more than 50 students who became professional archaeologists, includ ing James Hill, William Longacre, and Fred Plog. In 1968, he received the American Anthropological Association's Alfred Vincent Kidder Award for eminence in the field of Amer icanist archaeology. He amassed one of the world's great collections of Mogollon and Ancestral Puebloan material culture, consisting of some 585,000 artifacts, at the Field Museum in Chicago. Although culture history, with a dab of cultural evolutionism, provided the theoretical underpin ning for his research, Martin pioneered efforts to discern precontact social organization through the study of material culture. He became an early convert to, and advocate for, the New Archaeology, primarily by providing intellectual, logistical, and financial support under which professionals and students could test new research questions, excavation methods, and analytical techniques. Published analyses of Martin's career and impact on North American archaeology are few and far between. Be yond an obituary (Longacre 1976), two reflexive contri butions (Martin 1971, 1974), and recent articles by Nash (2001, 2003, 2006), an undeniably important archaeolo gist has received scant?if not superficial?attention in the history of anthropology literature (see Browman 2002:258? 261; Graves and Zubrow 2007; Kehoe 1998:93-96, 116 117; Lyman et al. 1997:128-129; Muller 2002; O'Brien et al. 2006; Smith 1992:115-117). Book-length examina tions of North American archaeologists and anthropologists have been published in recent years, including scholarly bio graphies of museum-based archaeologists Byron Cummings (Bostwick 2006), Arthur C. Parker (Colwell-Chanthaphonh 2009), and W. C. McKern (Lyman and O'Brien 2003). These volumes offer archives-based appraisals of these schol ars, providing a better-informed and less-mythologized un derstanding of their roles in the history of archaeology (see Kerns 2003:xiii). As part of a much-larger research effort evalulating Martin's place in the history of North American anthropology (Nash n.d.), in this article I analyze archival and published sources from the earliest (1925?38) por tion of Martin's career to illuminate previously unexam ined facets in the life of an underappreciated museum-based archaeologist. As Don Fowler (2000:221) notes, the period from about 1850 through 1920 is sometimes referred to as the "Age of AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST, Vol. 112, Issue 1, pp. 104-121, ISSN 0002-7294 online ISSN 1548-1433. ?2010 by the American Anthropological Association.

(Neg ative No. A86384; courtesy of the Field Museum) Museums," as many natural-history museums were founded during this period, and collecting activity by those museums often occurred at an unprecedented, if perhaps unsustain able, pace. At the Field Museum, these halcyon collecting days coincide almost exactly with George Amos Dorsey's tenure (1894-1915) as a curator in the Department of An thropology (Almazan and Coleman 2003). Fully one-third (101 of 309) of the Field Museum's anthropology expedi tions conducted prior to 2001 occurred during this 20-year period, which constitutes less than one-fifth of the museum's history (Haskin et al. 2003). Dorsey's assistant curator of ar chaeology was the enigmatic Charles Lorin Owen, who led collecting expeditions to Arizona, California, and Ohio be tween 1900 and 1913 (Almazan and Coleman 2003:93-94). Although Owen remained at the Field Museum until 1925, a decade after Dorsey's departure, he failed to conduct an expedition after 1913 and published almost nothing during his entire 25-year career. It was Owen's position that Martin was hired to fill in 1929, by which time the Field Museum had been absent from the American Southwest for nearly two decades.1 To frame the analysis of Martin's contributions, I pro pose that, generally speaking, museum-based archaeologists are responsible for making professional contributions in five realms: (1) research (typically, although not exclusively, in the field); (2) exhibition and outreach; (3) collections acquisition and curation; (4) administration; and (5) service, the latter to both discipline and home institution. Although the time, effort, and resources that an archaeologist invests in any one of these realms will change in response to shifting institutional priorities, idiosyncratic historical moments and opportunities, and new personal and professional tra jectories, they provide a common framework on which to analyze the career of any museum-based archaeologist. The first three domains?research, education and outreach, and collections?are salient for this article and will be used to structure a review and evaluation of Martin's contributions from 1925 through 1938, the first phase in a long and productive career. A controlled analysis and comparison of data from unpublished archives, Field Museum collections, and the published record, all of which were created by Martin and his immediate colleagues, will help avoid falling into a presentist trap, in which a historical figure is unfairly evaluated against modern professional standards (Stocking 1965:211). That said, archaeology is a cumulative science in which data sources (e.g., sites) are destroyed as material cul ture and data are recovered. Changes in excavation method must therefore be explicitly acknowledged to properly and critically evaluate the research potential of Martin's curated collections. Table 1 summarizes the Martin-related archives consulted. Given this framework, and the fact that in 1929 Martin was a recently minted Ph.D. and a new hire at the Field Mu seum, three questions come to the fore: Did museum-based archaeology, as seen through the Field Museum and Martin lens, change during the 1920s and 1930s? Did museum ar chaeologists, seen through the same lens, (re)negotiate their commitments to scientific research and the visiting public during this period? Why is Martin, undeniably one of the most successful archaeologists of the 20th century, still un derappreciated, particularly for his work during this early period? BIOGRAPHIC AND ACADEMIC CHRONICLE Born in Chicago, on November 22, 1898, Martin was the fifth child of Adelaide May Martin (nee Sackett) and Ellsworth C. Martin. He graduated from New Trier High School in Winnetka, Illinois, in 1918, having taken a standard curriculum with strong emphases in music, English, Latin, and French. In September, he enrolled at the University of Chicago, where he focused on history and languages before dropping out for a two-and-a-half-year hiatus after spring quarter, 1920. The record is unclear on what he did during this hiatus, but he reenrolled during the winter quarter of 1922. From then until his graduation on December 18,1923, Martin maintained a B- average in courses ranging from his tory and education to sociology and English, the latter of which became his major. Martin had somehow found his scholarly calling, however, for he immediately began gradu ate work in the Department of Sociology, which at that time included anthropology, at Chicago (Stocking 1979). As with many young scholars, a chronicle of Martin's early career yields a confusing mix of fieldwork, course work, and employment.

Cole was hired away by the University of Chicago in 1923 to create an independent anthropology pro gram; Martin was his first Ph.D. student (Stocking 1979). It is evident but not surprising that Martin used Cole's well established professional networks to develop and expand his own professional opportunities. During the summer of 1925, Martin began his long career in museum-based archaeology while surveying and excavating mound sites for the Milwaukee Public Museum (Longacre 1976). The following summer, he became field di rector of the University of Chicago's Archaeological Survey of Illinois. In that capacity, he surveyed 450 Moundbuilder sites, excavated several, and, demonstrating an early com mitment to existing collections, examined 1,200 artifacts in private hands (Browman 2002:258?261). He quickly pub lished a report that, although short on details, set a precedent and standard for prompt publication to which he adhered for much of his career (Martin 1927a). Martin passed his general exams on June 11, 1926, and enrolled in one final quarter of course work that fall. Dur ing each of the next three winters (1926?27, 1927?28, and 1928?29), Martin spent several months excavating sites on the Yucatan Peninsula with Sylvanus Morley of the Carnegie Institution (Browman and Williams in press). As a result of this work, the Temple of Two Lintels at Chichen Itza is still known to some as "Paul Martin's Temple" (Martin 1928, 1929c). Although hoping to pursue a career in Mesoamerican archaeology, Martin suffered simultaneous cases of malaria, worms, and amoebic dysentery in 1929; the ensuing doc tor's orders against travel to the tropics precluded further fieldwork in the region. Thereafter, Martin published only two more contributions on Mesoamerican archaeology, both of which were book reviews (Martin 193 Id, 1937b). In June of 1927, the State Historical Society of Colorado (SHSC) hired Martin as curator of archaeology and ethnol ogy. In August, just before moving to Denver, Martin ac cepted an invitation from Kidder to attend the first Pecos Conference (Woodbury 1993). He was one of the few stu dents to attend and clearly benefitted from the experience (Martin 1927b). The time Martin spent in Colorado must have been exhilarating yet exhausting. In slightly more than two years, through October of 1929, Martin developed a new fieldwork program in southwestern Colorado and conducted two extensive field seasons there (summers of 1928 and 1929) while conducting two winter fieldwork sea sons (1927-28; 1928-29) with Morley in the Yucatan. He researched and wrote his Ph.D. thesis and then defended it</page><page sequence="4">Nash Martin as Museum Archaeologist, 1925-38 107 in Chicago on May 28, 1929 (Martin 1929b). The thesis, entitled The Kiva: A Survival of an Ancient House Type, was a library-based, cross-cultural study of subterranean struc tures coupled with a morphological and functional analysis of Southwestern kivas. One wonders how Martin had time to conduct this research, for he was in the field in southwestern Colorado and the Yucatan, far from academic libraries, for at least seven months between July of 1928 and May of 1929. Nevertheless, and presaging conjectures for which he would later become widely recognized (e.g., Martin 1939b:467), Martin built on Mitchell Prudden's (1903) work to sug gest that site-to-site regularity in room-to-kiva ratios might indicate that some common aspect of prehistoric social orga nization was manifest in the ruins. The degree was conferred on June 11, 1929. In the summer of 1928, while still deeply ensconced in these research programs and while an employee of the SHSC, Martin received word, probably from Cole, that the Field Museum sought to resuscitate its long-dormant re search program in Southwestern archaeology. Among other reasons, Martin applied for the position because he longed for a more intellectually stimulating environment after ar riving in Denver: "There is no one here in this town with my interests and I therefore I have no one to whom I may turn for help or consultation. One needs to be rubbing against the elbows of others, and to be subjected to razz in order to improve."3 On August 22, 1929, Martin accepted a letter of offer from the Field, writing to Sinologist and department chair Berthold Laufer, "I will try to give you and the Museum my fullest measure of effort."4 He proved a man of his word and remained at the Field Museum until 1972. Martin joined a Field Museum Anthropology depart ment that included, in addition to Lauf er, Albert Buell Lewis, assistant curator of African and Melanesian ethnology; J. Eric S. Thompson, assistant curator of Mexican and South Ameri can archaeology; Wilfrid Dyson Hambly, assistant curator of African ethnology; Henry Field, assistant curator of physical anthropology; and Thomas George Allen, assistant curator of Egyptian archaeology (Nash and Feinman 2003:259?261). Despite the fact that he was the junior member of the de partment, it was Martin who was promoted, after Laufer committed suicide, to acting curator of anthropology in 1934 and to chief curator in 1935 (Bronson 2003; Nash 2003). Martin's swift ascent to departmental leadership is a testament to his ambition, networking, and unmatched productivity in research, collections, and outreach (see be low). Martin retired as chief curator in 1964, remained in Chicago as curator emeritus, then moved to Tucson in 1972 for a research position at the University of Arizona (see also note a in Table 1). He died of congestive heart failure and coronary artery disease on January 20, 1974. RESEARCH Martin's training in archaeological field methods came un der Cole in Illinois and Morley in the Yucatan. From Cole, Martin learned the Chicago method of using arbitrary exca vation units to control archeological context and to record, if not necessarily preserve, good provenience data (see below; Browman 2002; Muller 2002). From Morley, he learned the utility of delegating projects to his staff and inherited a similar preference for comfortable, even pampered, field camps (Martin 1950; Nash 2001). The scope of Martin's excavations in southwestern Col orado's Montezuma County between 1928 and 1938 is, by modern standards, enormous. Working with a crew of six men "digging continuously" at Cutthroat Castle in 1928, he excavated 30 rooms, four kivas, seven small towers, one large tower, and 12 refuse heaps.5 Unfortunately, he did not preserve excavation records for this work, but he did publish some sketch maps. The site report includes an archi tectural analysis affirming his interest in reconstructing pre historic social organization (Martin 1929a:9; see also Martin 1929b). Martin had come to recognize two types of ruins in the region: the unit-type ruins on open mesas previously described by Prudden (1903) and the rim-rock type ruins located on canyon ledges (Martin 1930a: 1). In June of 1929, he returned to the field for SHSC with an eight-man crew and spent four months examining the two site types, focusing particular attention on the complex relationship between kivas, towers, and passageways that so intrigued him. He excavated Beartooth Pueblo and Little Dog Ruin, among others, and recovered a much more extensive assemblage of exhibition-quality materials for the SHSC than he had in 1928. Again, no field notes exist for these excavations, although he did publish a report and a popular account of this work (Martin 1930a, 1930b). In the summer of 1929, Martin suffered a professional disappointment from which it would take a change in venue to recover. Through the SHSC, Martin sought Department of the Interior (DOI) permission to excavate Lowry Pueblo, a large, multistoried ruin and one of the archaeological crown jewels of the region. DOI rejected his application, arguing that SHSC did not have the financial resources to ensure successful completion of the project. Whether or not this was true is now irrelevant (and the question seems moot given the extent of Martin's SHSC-supported excavations in 1928 and 1929), but the fact remains that he was denied permission to excavate because he was based at an institution that, in actions if not words, the federal government considered second class or worse. This setback provided Martin yet another reason to jump at the chance of employment at the Field Museum when it was offered. Six months after Martin arrived in Chicago, the Field Museum applied on his behalf for a blanket DOI permit to excavate sites in southwestern Colorado; Lowry was clearly the target. Lauf er used collections and exhibition-related, but not research, goals to justify the application to the mu seum administration. Lauf er noted that the material Martin would recover "would help considerably in filling in a gap in the Museum's Southwest collections and go far toward carrying out the new plans for the Southwest Hall."6 By</page><page sequence="5">108 American Anthropologist Vol. 112, No. 1 March 2010 the end of May, Martin secured critical endorsements from Kidder at the Carnegie Institution and Jesse Nusbaum, direc tor of the Laboratory of Anthropology in Santa Fe, both of whom recognized the Field Museum's professional stature and financial resources, as well as the fact that it had been absent from the Southwest for so long. Nusbaum reassured Assistant Secretary of the Interior John Edwards that he and Kidder would monitor the excavations, thereby acknowl edging Martin's still-junior status in the profession.7 DOI awarded the permit via telegram on June 6; Martin left immediately. Just over one month later, Martin reported to Field Mu seum administrators that work was proceeding slowly, but that assessment is subject to interpretation.8 His crew had built a mining-car-and-chute apparatus that allowed them to move up to 21 tons of overburden per day (see Figure 2). They had already exposed painted kiva murals for which Lowry would become famous (see Figure 3), submitted tree-ring specimens to the University of Arizona for dating, and filmed portions of the excavation on 16-millimeter film stock (see Figure 4).9 Martin nevertheless felt compelled to explicitly report that "[exhibition-quality] specimens are not yet being recovered."10 This statement underscores the different values placed on archaeological excavations by mu seum administrators, who wanted exhibition-quality spec imens, and more scientifically minded archaeologists like Martin, who might find data in many different sources. Martin had returned to Lowry in June of 1931 and filed his first progress report on July 1. Efforts to that point had been focused on preserving the walls that, regrettably, he FIGURE 2.

(Negative No. CSA73501; courtesy of the Field Museum) left exposed in 1930 and that had fallen during the winter.11 He reported that a tree-ring date of C.E. 985 ?2 had been derived for one of the beams submitted in 1930 and was pleased because the date was "earlier than any yet known for Mesa Verde, [and] bears out fairly well my guess, based on stratigraphy and pottery sequences."12 This is one of the few instances in which Martin's correspondence emphasizes his research results and inferences, not object recovery. On August 4, he celebrated the fact that he found "17 pieces of [whole] pottery ... unlike anything in the area" and that Kidder had visited the site and was "impressed with the dig and the complexity of the problems."13 He also noted that they found, off the main site and presumably on private land, an underground spring that had been timbered and cribbed in precontact times and ten pieces of pottery as well as Hopi prayer sticks at the bottom of the spring (see Martin 1931b). Martin "tried in vain to get the pottery for the Museum; some prayer sticks were obtained."14 No record of these prayer sticks or pottery exists in Field Museum catalog or accession files. Less than three weeks later, Martin celebrated the dis covery of 24 more whole or restorable vessels and summa rized his projected accomplishments: "I hope by the end of the season to have about sixty or seventy pieces of pottery, many sherds, bone tools, minor objects, and about one hun dred excellent negatives. ... To date, exclusive of last year's work, we have excavated seven large rooms, two kivas, and have trenched across the diameter of the Great Kiva, which has a diameter of 80 feet."15 After a yearlong fieldwork hiatus in 1932, Martin re turned to Lowry Pueblo in 1933 and 1934. In 1933, he noted that the ruin had evidence of at least five distinct periods of occupation, discernable on the basis of stratigraphic rela tionships and his bond-and-abutment study of the masonry walls, not to mention tree-ring data (Martin 1933a). He her alded the discovery of several bone-tool caches, three dog burials, 30 whole vessels, and the fact that he had obtained a tree-ring date of C.E. 894 for a previously submitted specimen. In 1934, he published a nearly full-page article in Field Museum News to announce that Federal Emergency Relief Administration labor had been used and that "greater progress was made than in any of the three previous seasons of the expedition's work," because the team had recovered 14 partially dismembered skeletons, 44 pieces of pottery, and 4,000 potsherds, as well as "great quantities of arrow heads, beads, axes, bone implements, and other artifacts"</page><page sequence="7">110 American Anthropologist Vol. 112, No. 1 March 2010 FIGURE 4. Martin demonstrating his cinematography skills on the hood of the Southwest Expedition's Pierce Arrow Touring Car in 1931. (Negative No. CSA75691; courtesy of the Field Museum) (Martin 1934a: 3). Note again that in writing for museum members, as well as museum administrators, Martin usu ally emphasized recovery of archaeological "loot," not the solution of research problems. Martin published the Lowry Pueblo report in 1936, only two years after concluding excavations there (Martin et al. 1936). The published theory behind the excavation of Lowry Pueblo is firmly grounded in cultural evolutionism and the culture history paradigm then current among North American archaeologists: Possibly this work will contribute towards the discovery of some of the forces which caused the gradual rise of Pueblo Indians from a low to a higher cultural state. I likewise hope that this study may perhaps... [help complete] the mosaic of Pueblo history which archaeologists working in the Southwest are slowly composing... Thus, I hoped, by exploring [Lowry Pueblo] to... attain a historical perspective which would permit me to solve problems, such as the mechanics of growth of a particular pueblo, the architectural skill of these Pueblo Indians, the size of the population at various periods and its changes, the length of time that the pueblo was inhabited, the pottery sequence, and the cultural and chronological relationship of this pueblo to other large villages in New Mexico and Arizona. [Martin et al. 1936:22-23] Clearly, and at least in retrospect, Martin sought to do more than simply fill in a gap in the museum's collections.</page><page sequence="8">Nash Martin as Museum Archaeologist, 1925-38 111 Martin's use of the Chicago excavation method, motion picture film, and mining technologies as well as his willing ness to make conjectures about prehistoric social organiza tion were all considered innovative at the time. A detailed reading of the Lowry Pueblo site report reveals also that Mar tin was tacitly interested in, or at least cognizant of, research on ancient psychology and culture pattern, perhaps because of his association with Sapir at Chicago (see Hawley 1937). Martin also reestablished an analytical precedent set by John Wesley Powell in 1881 by hiring an architect, Lawrence Roys, to analyze the construction sequence of Lowry Pueblo (Longacre 1999). Christopher Chippendale (1989:23) warns us that "a knowing superiority from hindsight is the easiest and most pernicious attitude to fall into" when writing the history of archaeology, but it is difficult to avoid the impression that, despite these innovations, Martin's efforts amounted to little more than sophisticated specimen hunting, a point to which he basically admitted later in life: "Mostly, we dug out of curiosity, for fun, for specimens, and to write the historical details for these sites and for this time period" (Martin 1974:7). He went on: To be honest, I fear some of [the excavations] were the result of my callow youth: the desire to make a name for myself by aping Kidder, by digging a big ruin and to run substantial stratigraphies [sic] to solve some of the ceramic problems of the area; [and] to obtain a goodly amount of loot for the Museum, for I was, at the time, very museum minded. [Martin 1974:8] A curious footnote in his next monograph (Martin 1938a) underscores the idea that his published problem ori entation for the excavations at Lowry may have developed ex post facto. That monograph contains a three-page section entitled "Problems," which, Martin admits, was written "at the suggestion of Dr. A. V. Kidder and before fieldwork had commenced" (Martin 1938a:236 n. 1, emphasis added). It is admirable that Martin, already an established scholar and department chair at a major museum, remained critically aware of potential shortcomings in his own work. That he would heed Kidder's suggestion in the first place and also acknowledge that fact in print suggests that this was a new stage in Martin's research that he wished to emphasize for colleagues, administrators, and other interested parties. Martin had returned to southwestern Colorado in 1937 and again in 1938 to examine smaller and earlier sites dating to the mid?late C.E. 800s to try to understand their de velopmental relationship to Lowry Pueblo. Although he did not use the term, it is clear that one of his objectives was to understand the regional settlement pattern (Martin 1938a). On July 6, 1937, he prepared a news release emphasizing their ceramic analysis: "Several nights we stayed up until midnight calculating averages, percentages, and totals for sections and quarter sections. The 4th of July was just like another day and we worked like beavers trying to keep pace with the work of the day laborers."16 In spite of this innova tive study, Martin soon communicated his disappointment with the season, thereby belying his, and certainly his super visors', continued emphasis on the acquisition of exhibition quality materials. In response to a lecture request, Martin wrote to Field Museum President Clifford Gregg: "Unless more exciting materials turn up, the lecture would be a to tal flop"17?this in spite of the fact that he later summarized the season's work by arguing that "such [a] thorough inves tigation has never before been carried on in southwestern Colorado" (Martin 1937a:2). Martin's tone changed dramatically just eight days later as the excavation of Basketmaker sites was beginning to gen erate results, news, and greater interest. Martin reported that the excavations were going to push the known archaeo logical sequence in the region back from C.E. 1000 to C.E. 400, and that he was therefore excavating the earliest sites then known in the region. Having thus baited his supervisors, Martin stated flatly that without an additional appropriation of $ 500, he would have to stop digging immediately. A check for $500 arrived less than one week later directly from the pen of Field Museum director Stanley Field.18 Despite having received a DOI permit to excavate up to 15 sites on public land, the four sites Martin excavated in 1937 were on private land.19 An unfortunate, if unintended, consequence of this is that Martin was not required to, and therefore did not, prepare and submit a year-end report to the DOI, and no such summary report exists within the archives. Our ability to understand his unpublished thoughts on the 1937 activity, beyond those above, is therefore hampered. Under Martin's tutelage, in 1937 Carl Lloyd supervised a methodologically groundbreaking archaeological survey. His "discontinuous intensive archaeological survey" exam ined select quarter sections in a 16.5-square-mile area in the Ackmen-Lowry region, as well as one quarter section within Hovenweep National Monument (Lloyd 1938:284?285). His technique was decidedly modern: field crews walked transects separated by 100 feet until each quarter section was completely surveyed. For each of the 180 sites discov ered, crews recorded geographical and archaeological data and collected all surface sherds. Lloyd published ceramic type frequences for the 80 sites from which 50 or more sherds were collected, and on that basis he offered "evidence for a hypothesis concerning the development of McElmo black on-white from Mancos black-on-white" (Lloyd 1938:288? 292). Unfortunately, Martin destroyed Lloyd's field records the following year, after the site report had been published (Lloyd 1938; Martin 1938a; see below). As a result, the collections can no longer be tied to sites on the ground (see below). In 1938, the museum inquired of DOI whether a new permit was required; it was. By late June, and with a new permit in hand, Martin excavated four Basketmaker and early Pueblo sites in southwestern Colorado (Martin 1939a, 1939b; see Figure 5). On July 13, Martin reported the exca vation of a kiva, 81 feet in diameter, as well as a pithouse that yielded 44 burned timbers suitable for dendrochronologi cal analysis. Using a well-worn strategy, he followed with</page><page sequence="9">112 American Anthropologist Vol. 112, No. 1 March 2010 FIGURE 5.

We are in the midst of excavating a large site which is turning out to be too good to be true, but it is much larger than estimated. It will take us another four weeks to finish the few portions which we wish to uncover.w2? The museum sent an additional $600 appropriation on August 1; Martin sent 17 boxes of artifacts back to Chicago two weeks later. After spending nine seasons in southwestern Colorado, Martin had grown intellectually restless. In spite of recov ering wonderful collections and developing new excavation and recording techniques, but arguably because he had ma tured as an archaeological scholar, he sought greener intel lectual pastures. He knew that a new challenge lay south, in the mountainous regions of west?central New Mexico and east?central Arizona, where Emil W. Haury (1936; see Martin 1937c) had recently defined a controversial new ar chaeological culture: the pithouse-dwelling Mogollon. And so, in 1939, Martin began a new phase in his long career (Nash 2003, 2006). EXHIBITION AND OUTREACH In the 1910s and 1920s, museums were undergoing a sig nificant transition from an "object-based epistomology," in which objects where displayed in exhibition cases with little or no explanation (i.e., "the facts speak for themselves"), to one in which exhibitions embodied and presented some aspect of anthropological research questions or theory, par ticularly those surrounding culture history and cultural evo lution (see Conn 1998). When Martin was hired in 1929, the Field Museum had been in its Grant Park location for only eight years, having spent its first 28 years in Jackson Park, on the south side, in the former Fine Arts Building of the World's Columbian Expositon, which is now the Museum of Science and Indus try (see Figure 6). When the move to Grant Park occurred in the early 1920s, the exhibition cases were moved, intact (see Figures 7 and 8). Very little exhibition development had occurred in the decade prior to the move, but in the late 1920s and early 1930s the Field Museum entered a new phase of rapid exhibition development, particularly as ef forts intensified in preparation for the Century of Progress Exhibition of 1933 (Collier 2003; Yastrow and Nash 2003). Almost certainly, Martin was hired with these considera tions in mind, and he spent a remarkable amount of time during his first decade at the Field Museum engaged in ex hibition and outreach activities.

Note the dioramas in center, surrounded by case upon case of objects with scant labeling and even less interpretation. (Negative No. CS A 8193; courtesy of the Field Museum) features; his outreach activities, primarily though not exclu sively in the form of popular publications, sought to make anthropological and archaeological research digestible to the public. An early milestone in Martin's exhibition and outreach effort is a little-known yet remarkable 12 2-page guide to the newly installed Archaeology of North America exhibition in Hall B on the ground floor of the museum (Martin 1933b). The volume provides insights into the Field Museum's exhibition philosophy as well as Martin's understanding of the state of U.S. archaeology at that time. It opens with speculation about Native American origins and the antiquity thereof, during which he incorrectly states that "no such associations [between humans an extinct Ice Age fauna] have yet been discovered" in North America (Martin 1933b: 11).21 Follow ing these introductory comments, Martin summarized the known culture areas in North America and focused on the Moundbuilder cultures of the Midwest, which to that point dominated much of the Field Museum's collections and exhi bitions. Separate chapters on objects of stone, bone, pottery, and mining round out the factual aspects of the volume and mirror the structure of the exhibition as well as his later scientific monographs (e.g., Martin 1938a, 1939b; Martin et al. 1936). He then confronted some fallacies about Amer ican Indians and provided a case-by-case explanation of the material on display. A concluding paragraph in the volume is worth citing in detail, for it reveals Martin's reliance on the culture area?culture history approach to exhibitions, if not research, and offers his justification for why curators collect: The purpose of the Hall of North American Archaeology is not merely to exhibit the handiwork of the North American Indi ans, but to illustrate their history as well as their methods of living as worked out under various geographical and cultural en vironments. The collections on display were not gathered solely because of interest in the objects themselves. They were ac quired with great effort and at much expense in an attempt to save from destruction the priceless and imperishable remains [so] that the history of the Indians may be reconstructed. ... If the specimens are worth collecting and saving, they are worth taking care of; and provision should be made to have them left</page><page sequence="11">114 American Anthropologist Vol. 112, No. 1 March 2010 FIGURE 7. Field Columbian Museum exhibits in Jackson Park being moved to the new Field Museum building in Grant Park, Chicago, 1921. (Negative No. CSGN 40466[ 1 ]; courtesy of the Field Museum) to an institution where they will be catalogued and preserved and where they will help future students and collectors. [Martin 1933b:l 10] In this, Martin touched on the self-serving preservation ist rhetoric, if not ethic, so common among museum per sonnel of the day, who felt they were saving objects "from destruction" and were preserving collections for the greater good of humanity, a justification for unrestrained museum collecting activity that persists to this day (e.g., Cuno 2008). Unfortunately, Martin did not practice what he preached: 95 percent of his collection remained uncatalogued until the late 1990s, and he knowingly destroyed field records on at least one occasion (see below). Throughout the 1930s, Martin presented a number of small, temporary archaeological exhibitions. In June of 1931, he announced the donation and display of the Pere grine figure, a rare flourite anthropomorphic figurine found in extreme southern Illinois (Martin 1931c). In Septem ber, he announced the installation of a full-sized reproduc tion of an Illinois Moundbuilder grave (Martin 1931a).22 With the display, Martin hoped to dispel the myth of the Moundbuilders and clarify a fact that archaeologists, if not the general public, already understood well: the mounds so common in the eastern and midwestern United States were built by ancestors of modern Native Americans, not a mythical race of superhumans (Silverberg 1968). In January of 1932, Martin announced with little fan fare the reinstallation of the North American archaeology collections in Hall 3. This reinstallation did not include the Southwest culture area because "a special hall repre senting its important group of cultures is in preparation" (Martin 1932c:2).23 He then announced new displays of Navajo blankets (Martin 1932b) and copper objects from the Hope well Mounds in Ohio (Martin 1932a). In 1933, he announced the installation of Hopi Kachina Dolls (Martin 1933c). In 1934, he introduced the newly developed science of tree-ring dating to an interested public (Martin 1934d) as well a revamped diorama of the Great Serpent Mound in Ohio (Martin 1934c) and a recently acquired collection of Eskimo toys (Martin 1934e). In 1935, he announced the</page><page sequence="12">Nash Martin as Museum Archaeologist 1925-38 115 FIGURE 8. Field Columbian Museum exhibits being moved from the Jackson Park location to the new Field Museum in Grant Park, 1921. Note protective covering placed over the skeletons in the near exhibit case. (Negative No. CSGN 40496; courtesy of the Field Museum) installation of a Tibetan coracle, or yak-skin boat (Martin 1935b). It is clear that Martin published the announcement only because of L?ufer's recent death, as Martin had no ex pertise in such material. In December, he announced the installation of a model of a Toltec pyramid (Martin 1935a). In so doing, he provided a broader anthropological context for the installation, explaining the ceremonial nature of such structures. After 1935, Martin's contributions to Field Museum News began to emphasize less the installation of new, small ex hibits; instead, he began to provide simply phrased expla nations of anthropological research for an interested public, as he had done so ably in his guidebook to Hall B (Martin 1933b). In 1936, he summarized Sapir's linguistic work that demonstrated the Athapascan roots of Navajo language (Martin 1936c). In keeping with the difficult economic times brought on by the Great Depression, he noted that the trans lation of a recently discovered cuneiform tablet (an "Ancient Promissory Note") from Kish, Iraq, revealed severe usury, in which the lender charged a 100 percent interest rate (Martin 1936a). In December, Martin turned his attention to Hopi secret societies, superficially if understandably comparing them to fraternities on college campuses (Martin 1936b). The concentration of these publications in late 1936 is per haps not surprising, as Martin had not conducted field work since 1934 and his report on the Lowry excavations had just been published (Martin et al. 1936). In 1937, he tackled preventative medicine of Native Americans (Martin 1937d) and in 1938 the "Indians of California" (Martin 1938b). Also in 1938, he published in the North American Review a long-winded and peculiar essay re viewing F. Martin Brown's 1937 book America's Yesterday, in which Brown reviewed significant archaeological discoveries of the previous quarter century (see Martin 1938c). The dozens of short articles published and temporary exhibitions installed by Martin during the 1930s kept the museum membership engaged in, and hopefully excited by, new developments in anthropological and archaeological re search. No other Field Museum curator, in anthropology or any other department, was as visible on the exhibition floor, in Field Museum News, or in the Chicago newspapers during this period (Nash n.d.). This work, arguably more than his field research, may have endeared Martin to the museum administration and enabled his meteoric rise to the top of the Department of Anthropology, which he subsequently dominated for more than three decades.</page><page sequence="13">116 American Anthropologist Vol. 112, No. 1 March 2010 COLLECTIONS During the period in question, Martin published two con tributions based exclusively on objects already in the Field Museum collections. The first is an otherwise anomalous account of the "Bow-Drill in North America," in which he offered a cross-cultural literature review and detailed description of a bow-drill collected by Charles McLloyd and C. C. Graham in Grand Gulch, Utah, in 1890 (Martin 1934b).24 He argued that the piece could not possibly be unique and that similar bow-drills would one day be found elsewhere in the Four Corners region, which they have. The second contribution, coauthored with Elizabeth Willis, is Anasazi Painted Pottery in the Field Museum of Natural History (Martin and Willis 1940). This impressive volume contains typologically sorted photographs of a sample of the 5,000 Ancestral Puebloan vessels collected by "cow-men, ranch ers, antiquarians" in the late 19th century and subsequently acquired by the museum (Martin and Willis 1940:7).25 Martin and Willis (1940) lamented the limited research potential of the collection because of a lack of provenience data, but they appreciated its aesthetic appeal and exhibi tion potential. Their lament rings a bit hollow in light of Martin's failure to preserve field-research records and his failure to properly catalog portions of the collections he amassed. In 193 3, Martin publicly professed his dedication to mu seum collections, their associated data, and the rapid publi cation thereof (Martin 1933b: 110). It is another matter en tirely whether he practiced what he preached or if his desire to obtain a "goodly amount of loot for the Museum" domi nated his developing curatorial sensibilities (Martin 1974:8). Without a doubt, Martin established a well-deserved repu tation for the rapid production of excavation monographs in the museum's Fieldiana series (e.g., Martin 1938a, 1939a; Martin et al. 1936). At the risk of presentism (Stocking 1965), however, the monographs and the collections on which they are based must now be considered incomplete for four reasons. First, Martin did not screen the excavated room fill and routinely ignored entire classes of objects that today are standard components of archaeological assemblages, includ ing faunal remains, sediment samples, lithic debitage, and plainware sherds. For this, he should not be blamed, for fill was not routinely screened until the 1970s and archae ological methods are constantly developing. Nevertheless, archaeology is a destructive science, and specific excavation units cannot be reexcavated to test a prior scholar's con clusions. Limitations in excavation methods must therefore be explicitly recognized as they have a direct effect on the nature and integrity of the collection created and, hopefully, curated. It would be fascinating indeed to excavate Martin's back dirt piles to determine exactly what he chose to leave behind and in what proportions. Second, Martin violated his own decree: "If the speci mens are worth collecting and saving, they are worth taking care of; and provision should be made to have them left to an institution where they will be catalogued and preserved and where they will help future students and collectors" (Martin 1933b: 110). Martin routinely published data on ob jects that he left in the field. Although this is better than not publishing such data at all, it is now impossible to test his published conclusions on the data set he used. As but one example, Martin and colleagues (1936) published data on 1,377 objects from floor contexts at Lowry Pueblo but cat alogued only 598, or just 43 percent, of those objects.26 On reflection, it appears that Martin heeded his supervisors' call and shipped to Chicago and catalogued only the exhibition quality whole and reconstructable vessels, formal stone and bone tools, and human remains, as well as a small sample (ca. ten percent) of the decorated sherds he excavated from Lowry Pueblo and the other southwestern sites. Third, Martin's southwestern Colorado collection has suffered significant losses through attrition, possible petty theft, and probable curatorial culling in amounts that are now impossible to determine. Of the 598 floor-context artifacts mentioned above, only 520 (87 percent) were found during inventory in 1998. The situation is similar for collections from nonfloor contexts at Lowry but is far worse for the 1937 and 1938 collections.27 Fourth, Martin's southwestern Colorado collection and monographs must be considered incomplete because of the lack of original excavation records beyond the photograph and correspondence collections. Rinaldo, Martin's loyal as sistant from 1938?62, noted that his first memory of Martin occurred in 1938, when Martin was shredding Lloyd's 1937 survey notes.28 Martin told Rinaldo the notes were no longer needed because the survey had been published (Lloyd 1938). If Rinaldo's recollection was correct, and the archives sug gest it is, Martin's behavior was inexcusable, even according to professional standards of the time. He had been working in museums for over a decade and had made productive an alytical use of archived field notes and data as early as 1926 in Illinois (see Browman 2002:258?259). Surely, he knew better. Given these lacunae in Martin's collection from south western Colorado, and the startling lack of excavation records, it is now impossible to test Martin's interpreta tions and conclusions using the same artifact assemblages he analyzed. In short, his science is no longer replicable. Martin nevertheless recorded provenience data, sometimes simply written on the objects themselves, more completely than did many of his contemporaries. If one trusts the data on the objects and in the publications, then productive use may still be made, however cautiously, of his collections (see Rinaldo 1950). CONCLUSION To return to the questions outlined at the outset of this ar ticle: Did museum-based archaeology, as seen through the Field Museum and Martin lens, change during the late 1920s and 1930s? Martin's museum-based predecessors, including Dorsey and Owen at the Field, and Cummings at the Arizona</page><page sequence="14">Nash Martin as Museum Archaeologist, 1925-38 117 State Museum, worried less about recording archaeological contexts than he did. Having been trained under Morley and Cole, Martin was imbued with an ethic that called for con trolled excavation and detailed photographic recording?if not, oddly enough, the preservation of field notes. Martin worked for museums, however, and was under pressure to recover exhibiton-quality materials: the SHSC considered his excavations "a failure" if he did not do so.29 Martin's work during these early years manifests itself as a tender balancing act between institutional-collection and exhibition-related goals and the developing disciplinary desire for problem oriented research. By February of 1937, Martin was explicit and ex ante about this problem orientation (Martin 1938a). Did museum archaeologists, as seen through the same lens, (re)negotiate their commitments to scientific research and the visiting public during this period? Martin's commit ment to exhibition and outreach is amply demonstrated by his extensive exhibition development activity at the Field Museum and the 40 popular articles he published between 1927 and 1938, all of which endeavored to make anthro pology and archaeology available to an interested public.30 Before 1935, these contributions emphasized the discovery and display of individual objects, dioramas, or features. After 1935, these contributions focused more on archaeological and anthropological research and making it understandable, and indeed relevant, to an interested public. It is not un reasonable to suppose that Martin's exhibition and outreach activity proved critical in the museum's decision to promote him to chief curator over five anthropological colleagues, all of whom had temporal seniority over Martin. So why is Martin, undeniably one of the most successful archaeologists of the 20th century, still underappreciated, particularly for his work during this early period? In spite of the fact that Martin was well connected in Chicago and that he had well-established professional networks in the Yucatan and the U.S. Southwest, he did not have a regular stream of graduate students working for him, at least partially because neither of the museums at which he worked are, or were, affiliated with a university.31 Martin also chose to publish his research as monographs in the Field Museum's Fieldiana series, not in peer-reviewed journals like American Anthro pologist, American Antiquity, and Science. Although the field of North American archaeology was indeed small during the 1930s, this choice affected his disciplinary and, especially, his historical visibility. Finally, the early portion of Martin's career is simply overshadowed by his work in support of the New Archaeology in Arizona from 1956 until his death in 1974, which involved large numbers of highly productive and visible students and scholars (Nash 2003, 2006). Martin the museum-based archaeologist made signifi cant contributions to archaeological knowledge, method, and, to a lesser degree, theory, between 1925 and 1938. He added thousands of objects to the already impressive col lections at two major museums. He made these and other collections available to an interested public through exten sive, if not unparalleled, exhibition, publication, and out reach activities. But he also compromised the future research value of these collections through poor note taking, occa sional destruction and disposal of associated documentation, and failure to fully catalog and publish the collections he amassed. Had he not published such clear arguments against these practices (e.g., 1933b: 110), his record and behavior might be more easily excused as a product of the times. But Martin knew better and said he knew better. He therefore leaves behind a conflicted legacy. Stephen E.

This is a glaring error. Researchers at the Colorado Museum of Natural History had in 1927 discovered projectile points embedded within the bones of an extinct form of bison at Folsom, New Mexico. It is unclear how Martin could have ignored these important discoveries, particularly as he was based in Denver for two years immediately after the discovery. 22. Although Martin is not listed as the author, it is so attributed here because it is listed in his self-compiled curriculum vitae, he was curator of that material, and the prose is stylistically similar to his other contributions. 2 3. The North American archaeology display was moved to Hall B in 1933 to make room for Malvina Hoffman's Races of Mankind exhibit, which was prominently featured in association with Chicago's Century of Progress world's fair (Yastrow and Nash 2003). 24. Martin 1934b is the only nonreview publication Martin ever published in American Anthropologist. Having easy access to the museum's Fieldiana monograph series and popular publica tions, Martin probably saw little reason to publish in peer reviewed journals. This may account for the fact that he less well known outside of Southwestern archaeology than one might expect. 25. Willis was a "senior archaeologist" at the Field Museum from 1937-40, paid by the Works Progress Administration (Nash and Feinman 2003). 26. In all, Martin never cataloged 95 percent of the Field Mu seum collection he amassed during his 43-year career in Chicago. I catalogued the remainder under a National Sci ence Foundation systematics grant (SBR-9710181) awarded to Jonathan Haas in 1997.
