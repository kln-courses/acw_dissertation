Boston College Museum of Art, Chestnut Hill, Mass., 1995, 108pp., map, 81 b/w, 8 col. plates (ISBN 0-9640153-3-1). Reviewed by Michael Gunn The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York Of all the many thousands of weapons held in muse um collections throughout the world, shields are perhaps felt to be the most accessible to us. Iheir usefulness is either immediately apparent, or raises immediate questions. Almost invariably they have some design engraved or painted on one or both sur faces, enabling us to suspect them of carrying some hidden insult in addition to their role of repelling death. July 1996 127</page><page sequence="2">So it was with interest that I opened the catalogue to the exhibition Protection Power and Display, which was held at the Boston College Museum of Art from 6 October until 10 December 1995. I had expected some grisly scenes, for most of these shields were weapons of war. But there was only one pho tograph strong enough to remind me that shields are not just another type of art object from an interest ing part of the world—a decapitated Ifugao warrior was shown being borne to his burial lashed to his shield. Somehow the rest then resolved itself into the subtleties of aesthetics regarding pre- or post- colo nial designs, 'squirmishes,' and debatable links between design imagery painted onto the surface of a shield and that found elsewhere in redundant sym bolic systems. shields originating in Southeast Asia and in much of Melanesia is restricted by the fact that they have not been made or used for almost a century, and when these shields were originally collected in the field very little attention was given to recording an indige nous interpretation of the design elements or con text or use. A shield was a weapon, which became a curiosity, then finally became an art object. Each or the authors emphasized in one way or another that shields are not just pieces of wood or leather intended to deflect arrows, spears, or swords; but that they have an equally important spiritual dimension attached to them. « shields from the exhibition were featured in the catalogue, together with seven other shields that were portrayed only by photograph or sketch. Now largely located in muse um collections (2/3) or in private collections in the United States (1/3), these shields originated from a number of island groups in the Southeast Asian Melanesian region. Among these were several from the island groups off the SW coast of Sumatra (Simeulue, Nias, and Pagai); one from the Moluccas (Maluku) region of eastern Indonesia; seven from various parts of Borneo; three from Sulawesi (Sa'dan Toraja and the Lake Posa area). Northern Luzon in the rhuippines was well represented with six shields, the southern Philippines had two (from Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago); a Moi shield from Vietnam completed the Southeast Asian section. Melanesian coverage was also quite extensive, with strong representation from the north coast of Papua New Guinea, the Elema and Vailala regions of the Papuan Gulf, several regions of the Eastern and Western Highlands, south coast New Britain, and the Solomon Islands. The Trobriand Islands were especially favored, with three of their shields shown it the exhibition. The five main essays dealt in greater or lesser depth with some of the problems we Westerners find ivtien trying to come to terms with the symbolic sotential of ambiguous objects. Research into Andrew Tavarelli, in his essay entitled "Protection, Power and Display: Shields of Island Southeast Asia and Melanesia," described the visual appearance of a variety of shield types: from the small hourglass-shaped parrying shields collected from the Maluku region of eastern Indonesia, to the heavy rectangular shields used by disparate groups such as the Malol of the north coast of New Guinea and the Maring of the Eastern Highlands. He noted that in many of the cultures in this region of the world warfare was highly ritualized, and that many of the carved and painted images on these shields acted as vehicles of communication with spiritual forces. Steven Alpert, an art collector and dealer special izing in Southeast Asian tribal art, brought his per sonal collecting experience to add flavor to his essay "Indonesian Shields." It is perhaps a pity that his very rare Ataoro shield was not included in the exhi bition and shown in color in the catalogue. Susan Rodgers took a different and almost peripheral route with her "Beyond Shields: Exploring an Indonesian Aesthetic of the Protective Arts," when she discussed aspects of protective encirclement, especially in ref erence to her own fieldwork with the Angkola Batak. In her essay Divine Spheres of Protection: Shields of the Philippines," Floriana Capistrano-Baker examined three regions of Northern Luzon — Bontoc, Tinguian, and Kalinga — and the Mandaya of Mindanao. She pointed out the association between textiles and war implements, where weav ing, head-hunting, and notions of agricultural and human fertility were symbolically related in many Southeast Asian cultures. Michael O'Hanlon, in his "Medusa's Art: Interpreting Melanesian Shields," at first sight appeared to continue the metaphysical theme with "...the powerful visual impact a shield makes may be thought of as providing as much protection as its overtly 'practical' dimensions" (p.77), and then brought the debate back to earth when he noted that "...it is far less easy to detect a semantically mean 128 Pacific Arts</page><page sequence="3">ingful link between shield motifs and cultural themes" (p.77). He then presented two interpreta tions or irobriand shield design — hdmund Leachs 1954 portrayal of a painted shield design as a folded representation of a female anthropomorphic figure, the lower half showing the pubic area. Leach was later challenged by Ronald Berndt, in 1958, who conversely argued that instead the shield design rep resented a male and female about to enrage in sex ual intercourse. In 1986 Patrick Glass argued that the design on Trobriand war shields was a code operat ing on three levels: referring to Trobriand mytholo gy, to copulation, and to Trobriand sacred geogra phy. Wisely, O'Hanlon refrained from entering the fray except to demonstrate through his own field work among the Wahgi that literate symbols are now part of shield design elements, and that their inter pretation is as subject to over-interrogation as is a shield design from anywhere else in Melanesia or Southeast Asia. Overall the catalogue serves its purpose. The only real quibble I have is that not all works cited in the various texts were found in the list of references at the back, and that the Admiralty Islands (Manus) are labelled as 'Trobriand' in the main map on p.n (although this error is corrected on the Melanesian map on p.76). I would have liked all the pho tographs to be in color, for some of the shields were almost completely unintelligible in monochrome (especially the Maring shield no. 35). But otherwise the selection of pieces and editing of the catalogue were both commendable efforts.</page></plain_text>
