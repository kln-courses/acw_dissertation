<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Our Recent Rousseau:  On Paul Shepard Lawrence Cahoone Lawrence Cahoone, Associate Professor of Philosophy at the College of the Holy Cross,  is author of The Dilemma of Modernity: Philosophy, Culture, and Anti-Culture (State  University of New York Press), The Ends of Philosophy: Pragmatism, Foundationalism, and  Postmodernism (Blackwell), Civil Society: The Conservative Meaning of Liberal Politics  (Blackwell), Cultural Revolutions: Reason versus Culture in Philosophy, Politics and  Jihad (Penn State Press), and editor of From Modernism to Postmodernism: An Anthology  (Blackwell). Paul Shepard, a Rousseau armed with modern evolutionary ecology, presents our most  rational primitivism. In his work, ecology recapitulates mythology. His critique of civilization  compares to 20th century critics of “alienation,” except for Shepard the break with  “authentic” existence is not Modern industrialism but Neolithic agrarianism. His argument  remains largely impractical. Yet his late work suggests a reasonable meliorism. He recognized  that his “Techno-Cynegeticism” may find room in a postmodern society that is hostile to  agro-industrial, but not to what Ernest Gellner called “Durkheimian” or pre-agrarian,  social forms. Hope for the wild lies not in razing the modern “system” but in riddling it with  restored wild lacunae. Or, paraphrasing Thoreau, the salvation of the world lies in the feral.  I face a somewhat embarrassing dilemma. While sharing with many a critical  attitude toward the modern world, I reject social radicalism. Reforming the world is plausible,  trying to re-make it is irresponsible, perhaps dangerous. How then can I be fascinated with  Paul Shepard? Shepard argued that the human race took its wrong turn with the invention of  agriculture. In other words, his critique of modernity starts at 10,000BCE! How could anyone  be more radical? This paper is my own tortured attempt at understanding why don’t I think  Shepard was crazy. Who was Paul Shepard? 1 Apparently the first occupant of a chair of “human  ecology” in American academe, his eclectic research program was fueled by ecology,  genetics, anthropology, the history of art, philosophy, and psychodynamic theory, peppered  by references to Martin Heidegger, José Ortega y Gasset, Ivan Illich, Marshall McLuhan,  D.W.Winnicott, Julia Kristeva, and Claude Levi-Strauss. Four years before Arne Naess  invented “deep” ecology, Shepard was arguing that environmental preservation requires a  fundamental re-thinking of humanity’s place in the world (Shepard, 1969a; Naess 1973).  “Man is in the world,” he later wrote, “and his ecology is the nature of that inness” (Shepard  1996b, 111). He explored that ecology through nine books, two anthologies, and many essays,  some reprinted in three collections of his work. However, the best way to explicate Shepard’s view is to ask not, who is he? but  who are we? For Shepard we are the wayward children of arborial primate omnivores,  uniquely intelligent, highly visual, and almost neurotically social. With this sociality came  ontogeny and neotony, that is, individuality and immaturity, hence a premium on learning. As  australopithecine hominids we climbed down from our ancestors’ trees seven million years  ago in east Africa, and moved toward open land, reaching the grasslands as Homo Erectus (or  13 </page> <page sequence="2"> 14 ENVIRONMENTAL PHILOSOPHY Vol. 3 Ergaster) 1.7 million years ago at the outset of the Pleistocene. The savannah is a paradise  of seeds and meat for those smart enough to survive the intensity of its predation. This  habitat was, according to Shepard, the school of human intelligence. In it the flexible mind  of primates reared on subtle, visual clues of social status was re-trained to read the objective  signs of a vast taxonomy of plant and animal life in the relentless predator-prey game of the  savannah. Successful Erectus expanded from Africa into a variety of habitats. Those who  stayed home on the range kept growing their brains, becoming Homo Sapiens proper some  160,000 to 500,000 years ago. By 50,000BCE we invented culture in what Jared Diamond  calls the “Great Leap Forward,” then colonized the globe.2 Domestication of animals and  plants began around 10,000 BCE. Thus, depending on which hominids you count as human,  from 92% to more than 99% of our time on earth has been spent as segmentary, totemic  foragers, that is, hunter-gatherers.3  From this Shepard draws a simple (and not original) conclusion: that the human  genome was selected by and for the hunting-gathering life. His achievement was to explore  the ecological and anthropological implications, showing how our cognition, character,  and cosmology could have developed through classifying predator and prey species and  identifying inner feelings and body parts with such animals. That is, we became human,  biologically and culturally, through predatory relations to wild creatures. This genetic  conclusion also holds out ecological hope; for if, as one of Shepard’s essay titles puts it,  “Wilderness is Where My Genome Lives,” then the foraging self, and its ecology-friendly  lifestyle, remain available (Shepard 1996d). We do not have to “go back” to the Pleistocene, it  is still in us, or rather it is us. Shepard’s normative judgment is clear: the archaic life was superior. He answers his  own question, “Is mythos really more immature than logos?,” with a simple “No.” Echoing   the Enlightenment’s bête noire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Shepard makes civilization the source  of myriad pathologies, charging the sins of the past to the agro-pastoral interregnum, not our  archaic beginnings.4 The excesses of old-time religion were due to patriarchal pastoralists and  matriarchal agrarians; hunter-gatherers conceived the divine as animals. Archaic people are  not sacrificial: the taking of game is ritually celebrated as a gift-exchange, whereas sacrifice is  an agro-pastoral gambit to propitiate the hidden gods of weather and fertility. In segmentary  society there is minimal hierarchy; every family possesses state of the art weaponry (which, I  might add, makes them the advance guard of the republican citizen-soldier we usually credit  to Athens and Florence). Inter-group warfare was minimal, since there are no permanent  structures, domesticated animals, or grain stores to defend or steal. To use a quaint language,  there were no means of production to own. Barring exceptional cases, hunting and gathering  groups of less than five hundred have the lowest environmental impact of any human  economy and little infectious disease.5 Domestication re-designed species and ecosystems,  lowered diversity hence stability, introduced animal pathogens, formed the towns that enabled  epidemics, and instigated the cycle of expansion and collapse of riverine cities due to upland  grazing and soil erosion. Foragers’ expert knowledge of local flora and fauna made the  hours of work short, leaving their days to sociality and culture, that is, dance, song, crafts,  narrative, and ritual; it is farming that ushered in lives of mind-dulling, near-starvation labor.  As Diamond put it, admittedly with tongue in cheek, agriculture is the human race’s “worst  mistake” (Diamond 1987). Last, only archaic peoples know how to deal with death, not as a  </page> <page sequence="3"> Spring 2006 OUR RECENT ROUSSEAU:  ON PAUL SHEPARD 15 fearful termination to be escaped by any means, nor as proof of the inferiority of this world  to the next, but as a transformation in support of life. Their myths metaphorically express the  ecological fact that, as Valerius Geist puts it, death is the release of chemical energy for use by  other organisms (Geist 2001).  Echoing the response of Enlightenment thinkers to Rousseau, some regard Shepard  as a romanticist of the primitive, longing for an idealized origin, a potential reactionary.6  While the romantic charge may be plausible regarding his first book on cynegetic societies  – The Tender Carnivore and the Sacred Game (1973) – this cannot be said of his work as  a whole. Remember that Shepard’s was a lonely fight against both industrialism and the  romanticization of agro-pastoral alternatives to industrialism, making a certain polemical  one-sidedness inevitable. The grain of truth in the charge is that he leaves unmentioned, or  underestimates, some of the drawbacks of primitive life. But he romanticizes nothing. His  first environmental book was in fact a critique of 19th century pastoral art for constructing a  sanitized nature as counterpoint to industrialism (Shepard 1967). Rather than sentimentalize,  Shepard gives hard-nosed arguments for the superiority of archaic life. He may be wrong, but  he is not sentimental. Shepard is sometimes criticized for embracing the “man the hunter” thesis  – the claim that human evolution hinged on the adoption of hunting – a thesis apparently  essentialist and probably sexist.7 To the underlying charge Shepard must plead guilty: he  is a theorist of hunting, his turn to the hunter-gatherer having been inspired by Ortega’s  Meditations on Hunting (Ortega 1972). But his expression of the thesis is not simplistic.  Shepard rightly regards hunting as one species of foraging, along with gathering. He  acknowledges that in temperate zones meat probably constituted no more than 30% of the  archaic diet; it was meat’s cultural meaning that was essential. Shepard – indeed, most  proponents of the “man the hunter” thesis – do not hold that hunting by itself caused large  brains and speech, but only that the neo-primate capacities of Autralopithecus and Erectus  were particularly susceptible to remolding by grassland foraging in general and communal  hunting in particular (something not found in primates). As to the alleged sexism of the thesis,  Shepard denies it outright.8 Foraging societies often give different roles to men and women,  but these roles overlap – gatherers plucking small animals as well as flora, hunters collecting  anything of use. More important, these differences are, in Illich’s term, “vernacular” and  not political; they did not grant one gender a generalized power over the other (Illich 1982).  Further, archaic motherhood was less onerous than agrarian motherhood. Foragers generally  had fewer children. Mothers could not carry more than one infant on seasonal relocations.  Without animal milk and cereals, weaning was delayed until four years of age, and as Sarah  Hrdy explains, frequent night nursing suppressed ovulation, producing a long gap between  pregnancies (Hrdy 1999, 193-5). Shepard accepts Marjorie Shostak’s conclusion that women  are more equal in such societies than in “most” others “including our own” (Shepard 1998,  72; Shostak 1976, 277).  Far from political reaction, Shepard’s corpus resonates most with 20th century critical  theories: the re-evaluation of the “primitive” mentality by French anthropology from Mauss  to Levi-Strauss and even Foucault; German critical psychohistory as practiced by Adorno,  Horkheimer, and Marcuse, and taken up by American feminists like Dinnerstein, Chodorow,  Bordo, and Young; and the Heideggerian critique of Judeo-Christian and Hellenic repressions  </page> <page sequence="4"> 16 ENVIRONMENTAL PHILOSOPHY Vol. 3 of continuity with nature or being. If these saw in Western civilization a self bifurcated from  an abhorred nature – a nature identified with a repressed body and marginalized human  Others – Shepard draws the “natural-historical” conclusion: the antidote is the economy  preceding the bifurcation, in which humans lived interdependently with real, un-enslaved,  undomesticated Others, forming their identities through a “Dialogue of Inside and Outside”  (Shepard 1978, 70 and 1996, 6-7). His work implies that the opposition of culture to nature is  itself an agro-pastoral phenomenon.9 If Shepard’s work calls to the past, it is a past so much  older than the agro-pastoral as to be off any temporal scale of political nostalgia.  Shepard’s major distinction from kindred eco-thinkers is his critique of agriculture.  He literally claims that “agriculture has failed our species.” For him, “The most primitive  cultivator and the most advanced industrialist fall on a single line of progression and  philosophy” (Shepard 1973, 36). Sheep are no better than bulldozers. Like Diamond,  Shepard notes that agro-pastoralists waged global genocide on hunter-gatherers long before  industrialized European imperialism (Diamond 1999). He later admitted that his critique of  the low-intensity “garden agricultures” of Gary Snyder, Wes Jackson, and Wendell Berry  is “in-house bickering,” that their programs would in fact accomplish many of his hopes  (Shepard 1998, 107, n.50). Nevertheless, he insists, agriculture, even small and local, is not  the life of ecological balance. Balance means taking what habitat offers, that is, foraging.  In effect, then, Shepard is our premier theorist of the wild, by which I mean both  what is relatively devoid of human control and what remains outside the network of domiciles  that, permanent or not, structure the human community. Pre-agrarian people are not wild, but  their society is symbiotic with the wild.10 Agrarianism and pastoralism are by definition forms  of domestication, transforming wild fauna into “barnyard animals.” Farming combined with  engineering, writing, and coercive authority eventually made the cities of human civilizations.  The wild, then, is non-domestic, non-civilized, non-agrarian, and non-pastoral.11 The central  process of this wildness is, for Shepard, sacred trophism, something utterly alien to us. The  predator-prey relation is today foreign to most of the human race, and its sacred interpretation  has been heretical for the millennia that transcendent agro-pastoral religions have dominated  the human mind. 12 Today we have no feel for that relation, analogizing it to murder, slavery,  husbandry, harvest, and sport. We must wonder at the distinctive contours of the worldview  of peoples who hold sacred the animals they eat and wear, who talk to them, imitate them, see  them in visions, make them the center of their art, music, dance, and cosmology. Such a world  must be profoundly different not only from that of modern-industrial but of agro-pastoral  peoples as well.  Now, Shepard’s analysis of the hunter-gatherer lifestyle, of our psychic involvement  with animals, and even much of his critique of modern life, is fascinating and often plausible,  if speculative. But when it comes to recommendation, he unfortunately resembles many who  rain polemic on today’s society without explaining their alternative. Shepard implies that  humans can only develop fully and live properly as hunter-gatherers. Even forgetting the  metaphysically high evidentiary burden of this claim and the impossibility of implementing  it, he leaves unsaid the drawbacks of the archaic. Lack of agriculture did not free aboriginal  peoples from inter-group violence; man never killed for bread alone. Likewise unmentioned  are tooth decay and life expectancies under 50. And he considers “A 50 percent mortality rate  among the newborn [to be] a gift of life and health to the survivors” (Shepard 1973, 94). He  </page> <page sequence="5"> Spring 2006 OUR RECENT ROUSSEAU:  ON PAUL SHEPARD 17 implies that the human herd should be culled, which the end of agri-business would certainly  achieve. When, again in The Tender Carnivore and the Sacred Game, Shepard did pose  “practical” recommendations, the result was rather bizarre, involving industrial farming of  microbes for protein and human relocation to coastal high-rises, leaving continental interiors  wild for pursuit of game by small bands of postmodern aborigines – a sort of Le Corbusier  meets Jeremiah Johnson (Shepard 1973, 260-78). But in his last book, Shepard adopted a meliorist approach. Regarding the impossible  return to the primitive, he admits, “But of course I have known all along that there is no  way...for many people to achieve that final recovery of our truest being” (Shepard 1998, 107,  n.50). Here his recommendations are piecemeal, not holistic. Admitting to membership in “the  rag-tag tribe of Wannabes,” he concludes,  “White European/Americans cannot become Hopis or Kalahari bushmen...but  elements in those cultures can be recovered or re-created because they fit the  heritage and predilection of the human genome...tracing back to a common  ancestor that Anglos share with Hopis and bushmen....What we can do is single  out those many things, large and small, that characterized the social and cultural  life of our ancestors...and incorporate them as best we can...”(Shepard, 1998,  173).13 That, I believe, is not inconceivable. For our postmodern age may have a unique  potential. Here I hope you will excuse a short detour. As I have argued elsewhere, it is  plausible to link different conceptions not only of social organization and thought but reason  itself with the three great eras of human economy, the hunter-gatherer, agro-pastoral, and  industrial.14 Each of the latter two has its leading form of reason while retaining earlier forms  for use in subaltern cases. Egalitarian, segmentary hunter-gatherer societies employ what,  borrowing from Ernst Gellner, we might call Durkheimian reason, the consideration of plural  saliences through analogy to narrative exemplifications, deployed with minimal differentiation  among the values or norms of judgment, like propositional truth and social fealty (Gellner  1988). Thus propriety commonly trumped perception.15 But as Shepard explains better than  Gellner, archaic peoples often had vast empirical knowledge; they were the true Baconian  empiricists and Linnean taxonomists. Their oral social norms were pluralistic, open to  unrecognized change, and had, after all, evolved to be consistent with endless generations of  observation in a cyclically stable habitat. Hence their empiricism rarely had to be trumped by  the ritualistic propriety it had grown up with. Agro-literate civilization hinged on two advances in human storage capacity:  nutrition in the form of dry grain, and information in the form of writing, each guarded by  an elite – warriors and scribes, respectively – forming caste hierarchies and the distinction  between high and low culture. Its novel form of reason has been apparent at least since what  Karl Jaspers called the Axial age of the mid-first millennium BCE, that remarkable era of  the early Greek philosophers, Hebrew Prophets, the Buddha, the authors of the Upanishads,  Lao-Tze, and Confucius (Jaspers 1953). What we could thus call Axial or Jasperian reason  judged validity as participation in transcendent principles, yielding logical hierarchies of  propositional truths (“doctrines”) distinguished from practical or aesthetic modes of human  judgment, yet synthesized in the Divine. Cosmos and society formed an orderly whole  from God through aristocracy to peasant, albeit one now, for the first time, open to social  </page> <page sequence="6"> 18 ENVIRONMENTAL PHILOSOPHY Vol. 3 critique in light of transcendent standards. Modern industrial society employs what Gellner  called Weberian reason, which makes modes of judgmental validity mutually independent,  yet therefore dependent on contextual premises. Eventually truth is specialized, social  hierarchy undermined, and the distinction between high and low culture dissolved. I would  then suggest that the postmodern is merely the latest phase of modernization, wherein  Weberian reason erodes remnant Axial cultural forms, allowing elements of what Lyotard  called “metanarrative” to remain as ornamentation (Lyotard 1979). Postmodernism is thus  the advanced course in modernity; in it a vision of the whole, and its institutionalization  in a single logical or social hierarchy, is neither possible nor required for a social order of  internally ruled, discontinuous language-games. Or, as Niklas Luhmann put it, postmodern  society is “a whole that is less than the sum of its parts”(Luhmann 1982, 238). Now to my point: wild spaces may have greater prospects in our postmodern age  than in earlier modernity or advanced agrarian civilization. Certainly modern society has  always been riddled with what sociologist Peter Berger called de-modernizing and counter- modernizing movements (Berger 1973). But something else is going on here. I suggest that  the postmodern is not equally dismissive of all phases of the past; it is particularly anti-Axial,  hostile to the transcendent metanarratives, normative centralization, and political-cultural  hierarchies of agrarian civilization as those endured into modernity. Shepard himself hoped  for a “Techno-Cynegeticism,” suggesting that “There are many striking parallels between  postindustrial men and hunter-gathering men” (Shepard 1973, 277). We can say that they  share at least this: they are not agro-pastoral. Postmodern society seems fairly peppered  with pre-civilized lacunae of social decentralization, democratization of information,  and minimization of high-low and town-country cultural distinctions.16 This relates to  environmental concerns. It is not insignificant that many wild species virtually extinguished in  early-20th century America have in recent decades returned in abundance, managed, of course,  by governmental bureaucracies, the hunter’s tax dollars, and environmental legislation. I am  not suggesting that happy days are here again. I am predicting that if and when happy days  come, that is how they will come, not by overturning “the System” of money-and-power, as  Habermas would put it, but by riddling it with lacunae offering return to the wild (Habermas  1987). For it may be that, with apologies to Thoreau, in the feral is the preservation of the  world.17  Let me now turn to what I think is Shepard’s most unique conceptual contribution. It  can best be introduced by a story he retells from the Haida people of British Columbia.  Long ago, a group of girls were gathering huckleberries. One among them, a well- born young woman... should have been singing to tell the bears of her inoffensive presence  instead of laughing and talking. The bears...wondered if she was mocking them... the  maiden’s foot slipped in some bear shit and her forehead strap, which held the pack filled  with berries to her back, broke. She let out an angry cry, using the prohibited word “bear”...  Near her appeared two young men who looked like brothers. One said... “come with us,  as it is late.” As [she] followed...she noticed that they wore bear robes. It was dark when  they arrived at a large cavern... All of those inside, sitting around a small fire, had put their  bearskins aside. Grandmother mouse...squeaked to her that she had been taken into the bear  den and was to become one of them. Already, the hair on her robe was getting longer. She was  frightened. One of the young bears, the son of a chief...said, “You will live if you become my  </page> <page sequence="7"> Spring 2006 OUR RECENT ROUSSEAU:  ON PAUL SHEPARD 19 wife.” As the wife of the young bear chief, she tended the fire in the dark house. In the winter  she was pregnant...she gave birth to twins, which were half human and half bear. One day  her brothers came searching for her, and the bear husband knew that he must die. Before he  was killed he taught her and the Bear Sons the songs that the hunters must use over his dead  body and the other things they must do to ensure their luck. He willed his skin to her father,  who was a tribal chief. The young men then smoked him out of the den and speared him. They  spared the two children, taking them with the Bear Wife or Bear Mother back to her people.  The Bear Sons removed their fur coats and became great hunters, guiding their kinsmen to  dens in the mountains and instructing the people in singing the ritual songs whenever a bear  was killed, sharing their festival with its spirit, thanking it for the gift of meat and skin, and  ceremonially sending it home to the mountain, pleased with its visit, so that it could return in  another year (Shepard 1985, 58-59). For Shepard this story is not an anthropomorphism meant to reassure people  regarding next year’s hunt or expiate guilt for killing. It is a zoomorphism which explains  human identity and practice via analogy to bears. The bear is the source of the wisdom  imparted; the best hunters are half-bears and their mother became a bear for a while. The key  figures of inter-action are species-ambiguated, phases of a circuit of bear-becoming-human- becoming-bear.  The relation to the bear is social, a gift-exchange requiring proprieties of  respect and gratitude. As in most social relations, this “respect” is indistinguishably moral  and instrumental; that is, propriety ensures survival. The girl was supposed to properly  alert the bears to her presence, just as we should when hiking in country with dangerous  predators. Did she become a bear by being killed and eaten? Presumably, but she endured that  transformation by agreeing to serve the purposes of the bear clan. Under reciprocity the bear  who took the girl must die, but in a way that ensures the continued relations of human and  bear communities. In this exchange the bear provides humans food as well as a lesson in the  secrets of reality. The bears receive the girl as food, an infusion of human traits, and a healthy  limit on their numbers. Shepard would add that the human hunter also serves the bears as a  conduit for the genetic information that constitutes their future; as he remarks elsewhere, the  prey-species uses the predator as much as the predator uses the prey or the ecosystem uses  them both (Shepard 1996b, 24). In short, the story metaphorically expresses an objectively  true relationship of ecological interdependence through which humans make the basis of their  existence intelligible and counsel themselves on the proper way of life.  This is what is most intriguing in Shepard’s work: the meeting of ecological science  and mytho-poetic religion. I do not mean that, having climbed up the ladder of science to  achieve myth, he kicks science away – like the later Heidegger – nor that he takes myth to  be nothing more than empirical hypotheses – as did Sir James Fraser – nor that he accepts a  cognitive relativism that makes science and myth equal – like Peter Winch. As in naturalistic  epistemology, Shepard believes the human organism is capable of knowing its environment  because it developed under that environment’s discipline, evolving the perceptual-cognitive  templates necessary to monitor and respond to it. The information that is transferred  among species and species-members in an ecosystem emerged in human practice and  representation as objective empirical knowledge of natural kinds, their regularities, and their  interdependence. Grasping such information was the sine qua non of evolved homo sapiens  until 12 millennia ago, the knowledge required to survive as human. It was metaphorically  </page> <page sequence="8"> 20 ENVIRONMENTAL PHILOSOPHY Vol. 3 unified in a process-metaphysics of being as the cyclic transmutation of energy among  species, in which identity is dialogical and death releases life back into the eternal world- circuit of kinds. This totemic-animistic understanding is, for Shepard, essentially true. It  took until the late 20th century for science to approach the level of environmental knowledge  embodied in the myths and practices of archaic peoples. In short, in Shepard’s work ecology  recapitulates mythology. For him the primitive is not irrational but differently rational,  uncivilized but cultured, mythical but empiricist, pragmatic in its mysticism, not a sacrifice of  the intellect but a rediscovery of what intellect has overlooked.  To conclude by echoing a quip from the late Marx Wartofsky, if you told me I have  five minutes to live, and ask why I don’t think Shepard was crazy, my answer would be that  of all those I know who have extolled primitivism in the last century, Shepard is the most  profound and plausible. But if you then ask me, “Is he right?,” I would say: “Please...I’m  dying.” Works Cited Berger, Peter, Brigitte Berger, and Hansfied Kellner. 1973.

I  thank Christopher Dustin, Trish Glazebrook, Jim Hatley, and Jonathan Maskit for their critical  comments and concerns upon the paper’s delivery at the 2005 International Association for  Environmental Philosophy meeting in Salt Lake City. I have taken the liberty to add some  footnotes in response to their remarks, with no intention of undermining their criticisms and  no pretence of having satisfied their worries; my additions are simply afterthoughts that might  clarify my own ambiguities and advance the discussion. Last, I am especially grateful to  Florence Shepard for her encouragement and insight. 2 Diamond 1999, pp.39-41. The claim that this era (the Upper Paleolithic) witnessed the  invention of culture in the sense of ritual, artifact, and myth, has also been made by Robin  Dunbar, Chris Knight, and Camilla Power in their edited The Evolution of Culture.  3 “Segmentary” societies lack hierarchy and have minimal division of labor. While commonly  used to refer to agricultural villages, the term’s sociological meaning applies to pre-agrarians  as well. “Hunter-gather,” or the more generic “forager,” plainly refer to a dominant economy  of extraction, and do not imply absence of sophisticated crafts and cultural practices.  Certainly the application of the foraging/agro-pastoral distinction should expect ambiguous  cases, there having been many societies that hunted and gathered and engaged in limited  planting and/or herding. We might then call “foraging” those societies that did not reduce  hunting and gathering to marginal status.   4 Rousseau’s famously laudatory account of “primitive” life occurs his 1755 Discourse on  the Origin and Foundations of Inequality among Men, which earned him the ridicule of  Enlightened Europe.  It is helpful to remember that Rousseau intended this account as an  alternative to the – in his mind, inadequate – descriptions of the “state of nature” given by  the English political theories of John Locke and Thomas Hobbes. Native Americans figured  prominently as examples in this debate, especially for the English.   5 As others have rightly noted, there can be no form of human life that does not impact its  biotic environment. Foragers do not experience a nature unaffected by humans, nor are they  themselves “natural” in opposition to later “cultural” humans. They doubtless carry their  social norms and cultural meanings with them in their interaction with the biosphere, exerting  a pressure of what we might call cultural selection on other species in the simplest trophic  acts (e.g. spreading the seeds of preferred fruits), whose re-constitution of local habitat will, if  stable, go unrecognized by those who cause it. At any rate, Shepard’s view does not presume  a negligible foraging impact on habitat. His admiration for foragers is above all cultural,  an endorsement of their superior way of being in the world. He also believed their way of  being was better for the non-human environment. The truth of that belief hangs only on the  comparative claim that the foraging impact on habitat must generally – that is, regarding  most historical and pre-historical foraging communities – be less, either qualitatively or  quantitatively or both, than the impact of agro-pastoral and industrial communities. In short,  </page> <page sequence="12"> 24 ENVIRONMENTAL PHILOSOPHY Vol. 3 Shepard needs foraging only to be more “natural” – less invasive – than agro-pastoral and  industrial ways, not “natural” simpliciter. See also note viii, below. 6 Which is to say, he seems to some to have gone too far round the logico-political circle of  an environmentalism that, while generally regarded as politically left, is literally conservative  in aiming for a reversion to older patterns of human living and energy use, hence in principle  akin to traditional political conservatism on the “right” (as opposed to free market or  economic conservatism). After post-structuralism, invocations of the primordial are feared as  conservative relapse. But we should remember that a half-century ago, critical psychohistory,  phenomenology, existentialism and Western Marxism – German, French, and American – all  posited the “authentic,” “primordial,” and “originary” self as the normative base for criticizing  “alienated” society. I do not mean to endorse the latter, only to suggest that the politics of the  primordial are not so clear. 7 As once put, the claim that, “In a very real sense our intellect, emotions, and basic social life  are evolutionary products of the success of the hunting adaptation”(Washburn and Lancaster,  1968, p.293) The thesis was made famous by Lee and DeVore in their edited Man the Hunter  (1968), based on a 1966 University of Chicago symposium. It contains a rare Shepard-like  celebration of the archaic lifestyle, Marshall Sahlins’ “Notes on the Original Affluent Society.”  Critics of Sahlin and the collection as a whole might be reminded that when it appeared the  acknowledgement of indigenous peoples, the worthiness of their lifestyle, and the value of the  natural environment were yet in the future. The “hunter-gatherer” way was almost universally  conceived by modern peoples and their scholars, as at best a dark night of terror and scarcity  from which Western-sponsored development must rescue a grateful Third World. At worst, it  was merely savage. Industrialism was after all the universal human future, agrarianism was  the honored source of civilization; but foraging was without value. The collection’s aim was  to dispel such prejudice and to raise the possibility of judging the pre-historic lifestyle by  other than agrarian and industrial standards. 8 That the Man the Hunter volume was compromised by its almost complete neglect of  women is undeniable. See the sequel by female scholars who sought to correct the omission  – Frances Dahlberg’s edited Woman the Gatherer (1981). 9 I mean “opposition,” not “distinction.” Shepard distinguishes culture and nature, and uses  Levi-Strauss to chart their symbiosis. My point is that any notion of culture as providing a  way to transcend, escape, or counter-balance nature is post-foraging phenomenon. 10 “Wild” is certainly a contested term in contemporary environmental philosophy, despite  its pedigree (see Thoreau’s classic essay, “Walking,” in Thoreau 1937). I take it to mean the  un-domesticated. As such, pre-agrarian, pre-pastoral peoples are more entangled with wild  nature than agro-pastoralists or industrialists. Understood that way, the concept of the wild is  indeed crucial to Shepard, since it marks the importation of species otherwise obeying non-  and pre-human ecosystem/evolutionary strictures, into the unique sphere of human artifice,  where their survival and/or flourishing occurs under a drastically different set of constraints.  </page> <page sequence="13"> Spring 2006 OUR RECENT ROUSSEAU:  ON PAUL SHEPARD 25 The result over several generations is “breeding,” the modification of wild species lines. I  have no problem with considering this a matter of degree. If all human-habitat interaction  involves both assimilation of and accommodation to habitat by humans, hunting and gathering  require a more complete accommodation, agro-pastoralism a more complete assimilation (in  effect creation of novel sub-habitats). It is also true that, like others, Shepard does sometimes  allow “wild” to function as synonym of “natural” (as did Thoreau). Some writers go further,  seeming to think of the “wild” as a possible human state, a primordial mode of being  characterized by instinctual de-sublimation. These usages muddy the issue.  11 “Uncivilized” (not “un-cultured”) refers to societies that do not belong to “civilizations.”  Civilizations I take to be cultural-political families of societies or social groups, existing  over many locales and many generations, and exhibiting some common features that serve to  grant endogamous identity (i.e. form a “we”) under some conditions (e.g. inter-civilizational  conflict). A civilization can have a sovereign political center, hence be highly integrated, or  can be composed of several, still large, politically sovereign populations. The civilizations  we know of have been characterized by: large-scale production (as opposed to extraction)  of basic needs; the creation of cognitive (literate) and coercive (political) specialists, each  liberated from production or extraction, enabling both social hierarchy and cognitive-political  centralization; and the formation of cities (hence markets). Foragers are cultured but not  civilized. 12 I would not want to imply that Shepard’s attitude toward the Judeo-Christian tradition,  nor the Axial religions generally (in effect, all major world religions), was or must be solely  negative. The language of transcendent monotheism can be interpreted so as to make it  compatible with polytheistic, animist, or pantheist views. I would only say that any Shepard- like use of Axial religion would have to avoid canonical interpretations. 13 The qualifier “white” seems out of place. Surely non-white moderns have no better chance  at it. 14 See my Cultural Revolutions: Reason versus Culture in Philosophy, Politics, and Jihad,  chapter four and the Conclusion. 15 Gellner’s formulation of “multi-functional” thought is a promising alternative to extant  accounts of the “primitive” mind. His point is that segmentary thought restricts empirical  inputs (depicted in his famous “submarine” diagram), so that it makes sense to say it is raining  as the shaman predicted even if it is not. The reason is that what we would consider the  propositional and social, norm-conforming functions of language have not been distinguished,  or at least not consistently. As Gellner writes, “Language is not merely rooted in ritual; it  is a ritual. Grammer is the set of rules of a ritual performance.... Most uses of speech are  closer in principle to the raising of one’s hat in greeting than to the mailing of an informative  report ”(Gellner 1988, 51). I am suggesting that Gellner’s account is basically right, but fails  to credit the vast empirical knowledge of segmentary peoples, a failing that can be repaired  without overturning his basic idea. </page> <page sequence="14"> 26 ENVIRONMENTAL PHILOSOPHY Vol. 3 16 One interesting example is that, for the first time since the dawn of agrarian cities and  writing, communications technologies are now erasing the information gap between town  and country. George Bush senior watched CNN to get his news on the Gulf War – the same  information available in any small town or rural area with cable television – prominent  urban newspapers can now be remotely printed and sold, and the internet is undermining the  advantage of physical proximity to major urban and university libraries.  17 Thoreau, in his 1862 essay, “Walking,” famously wrote: “...what I have been preparing to  say is, that in Wildness is the preservation of the world” (Thoreau 1937, 613). </page> </plain_text>
