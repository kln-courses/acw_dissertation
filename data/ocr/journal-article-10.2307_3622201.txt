<plain_text><page sequence="1">ELEVENTH-CENTURY ANDALUSIAN AUTHORS ON THE JEWS OF GRANADA By M. PERLMANN It is the purpose of the present study to survey the literary expressions of attitudes towards Jews and Judaism that came down from XI century Islamic Spain. For the first time the Muslim West stepped into the domain of polemics which by then was well developed in the East. More- over the polemics here are not merely theological, literary, bookish, but are related to public affairs, political conditions, social attitudes and resentments, and are centered on the person- ages of the two Nagids, Samuel and Joseph.' Pertinent material has been preserved in both prose and verse. The extraordinary careers of Samuel Nagdela and his son Joseph, who for decades virtually conducted the affairs of the Kingdom of Granada and employed many Jews in government posts, enabled their adversaries to fan the hatred against Jews in general.2 The high standard of life of the bulk of the urban Jews, and their conspicuous role in public life, made them convenient targets for attacks in a society which clung strongly to the view that the infidel should not meddle in affairs of the true believers, and should be kept in his proper place - outside the pale, in humbleness and humiliation3 (vighar, dull). 1 In this respect the Spanish discussions of the XI c. are reminiscent of anti-Christian writings in Mamluk Egypt with their protest against the employment of unbelievers as scribes in governmental offices.

Ibn Hjazm (384-456/994-1064),s the great savant, theologian, and man of letters, dealt with the subject of Jews and Judaism in three works. He produced an Exposure of Jewish and Chris- tian falsifications in the Torah and the Gospels, Izhdr tabdil al- yahud wa-n-nasara li-t-taurdt wa-l-injil. This book, not known as a separate work at present, was incorporated into the magnum opus of the author, K. al-FiSal [or: al-fasl] fi-l-milal wa-l-ahwd' wa-n-nilal.6 Planned as a system of dogmatic theology, the Book of Studies [or: Decision] about Religions, Opinions and Sects, proceeds as an analysis of various groups: sceptics, athe- ists, deists, polytheists, unitarians without a belief in revelation, non-Moslem unitarian believers in revelation, Moslem sectarians. Thereupon Ibn Hazm is able to offer his own construction as the one apt to save the believers. As he incorporated some earlier polemic treatises, the book grew in size, lost in symmetry, and became to a great extent a history of religions and sects. 4 M.

As Fisal was written in 418-422/1027-1030, the treatise Izhar must have been written still earlier, before Ibn Hazm reached the age of 30. In Fisal, Ibn Hazm refers to his disputes with Samuel b. Nagdela (135, 152 end), whom he calls Ismael (135), by which name he was known among Muslims. Samuel was to him "the most learned and most skilled in disputations" (a'lamu- hum wa-ajdaluhum) among Jews.7 One discussion with him took place in 404/1013, i. e. when both Samuel and Ibn Hazm were quite young. Samuel is mentioned as Kdtib but Izhar (if it contained the passage) and Fisal could refer only to the earlier stage in Samuel's career. Even later, Ibn Hazm felt compelled to resume his polemics against Judaism, and this time directly against Samuel, for he heard that the latter had written a pamphlet against the claim of the Koran to divine origin.8 Thus, at present, of three works by Ibn Hazm which dis- cussed Judaism, we still have two: Fisal and the pamphlet Radd, Refutation (or Risala, Epistle). In Fisal we have a unique document: its section on Judaism is the only extensive work written by a Muslim author on the subject; it is the only work of anti-Jewish polemics written by one of the great minds of Islam. A piece of theological writing, it narrows down to textual criticism of Jewish scriptures. But the ingenious notes soon raise historical problems of higher criticism and matters of principle regarding the Muslim attitude towards Judaeo-Christian scriptures.

In case of doubt in translation or interpretation he withholds judgment.?1 He dwells mostly on the Pentateuch (117-204), especially on Genesis (117-153), picks a few passages from other biblical books (204-216) and from post-biblical literature (216-224). He shows a good knowledge of the Pentateuch in Arabic, but less satisfactory knowledge of the other writings criticized." He states he knew Christianity before studying the Jewish scriptures (116). He had many contacts with Jews, and the book still echoes the disputes he had with Jewish scholars. We mentioned two references to Samuel b. Nagdela. Possibly some of the other disputes also involved the Nagid. However, in all the other cases no name is recorded." His impression of the Jewish disputants is unfavorable: he thought they were trying to explain away difficulties with tricks and lies.13 "It has happened to us so often in our disputes with their savants... They are prone to lie... whenever they want to wiggle out of difficulty in a dispute;" a contemptible trait.'4 The author enjoys thor- oughly the confusion, helplessness, defeat of his adversaries when pressed by his unrelenting critique.15 9 155, 209, 224 end.

Sometimes he merely admires the superior- ity of the Koran version of the biblical stories.'6 The analysis of the biblical passages quoted persuades him that the biblical writings cannot be considered divinely inspired, nor can the claim of their ancient origin be maintained. They abound in inconsistencies and contradictions incon- ceivable in God's words.17 Ibn Hazm is on the alert for inac- curacy in numbers, figures: divine data would be free from such mistakes. "I have never seen anybody more ignorant of arith- metic than the person who compiled the Torah for the Jews."'8 The scriptures are found wanting also in matters of geography'9 and history.20 retorted: a) Why then does Metatron mourn and moan over the destruction of the Temple in the first person; b) Why does he regret the Lord's deed? 16 The four rivers of Eden in Genesis are an absurd concoction.

The scriptures want us to believe that Abraham doubted God's word, Sarah lied to God, the daughters of the prophet Lot con- ceived by their father, Isaac and Esau were cheated by Jacob who in turn was cheated by Laban; Israel fought divine force; the chastity of the family life of the prophet Jacob was violated by outsiders as well as by his own children; the lineage of kings and prophets begins with incest and fornication; Moses doubted God's might.21 These stories are marked by crass anthropomorphism,22 plurality in the concept of deity (shirk), and characterizations of God and his prophets as weak, helpless.23 The scriptures of the Jews, then, are mere forgeries, distor- Zerubabel's days, was never regained. In 404 H. Samuel Nagrela pointed during a discussion to the exilarchs in the East as Jewish rulers (wa-hiya qiydda wa-mulk wa-riyasa). "But I said that was wrong inasmuch as the exilarch's command would not be carried out with regard to anybody, Jew or non-Jew. It is merely a title without substance." The Jews were ruled after their return from exile not by the House of David but by Aaronids. Ibn Hazm knows of the Agrippas of the House of Herod (Asin, Abenhazam II, 292 misunderstood this reference) and refers to ancient authors describing them as non-Jews (min ar-rum). - 143 Cf. Goldziher, REJ, v. 8, 121 ff. 2I 129 on Gen 15,7-8, 130 f. on Gen 18 (Abraham addresses the three guests in singular; prostrated before men? ... or else, if he knew these were angels, why the food; meat and dairy dishes offered simultaneously). 132 (Sarah). 133 on Gen 18-19 (Lot and his daughters). 137 on Gen 27 (Esau). 140 on Gen 29 (Laban; 141 the marriages of Jacob violate the law against marrying two sisters). 142 on Gen 32 (Jacob Israel.

The Muslim accepts only the Koran, and only from the Koran he knows of previous revelations, among them one called Torah and one called Gospel, but he finds that the Torah of the Jews at best presents a text that has been tampered with extensively and has no validity. Some Muslims ignorantly reject this concept of forgery (tacrif) and believe in the transmission of the scriptures (tawdtur). Yet even the Koran teaches that tairtf has taken place. This weak- ness of accepting the opinions of the Jews (about their scriptures) may lead to further acceptance of their claims and traditions. Can a Muslim use scriptural arguments? Only a few passages have been left, since they escaped the attention of the Jews, no doubt by Allah's grace, so as to serve as evidence against the Jews (hujja).25 Such are the few a'ldm, predictions of Muham- med's advent.26 Thus, beginning with total rejection of scriptural texts, our author ends with accepting some evidence of the texts, - an old contradiction of Muslim authors.27 Ibn Hazm is quick to point out cases supporting the theory of abrogation (naskh) by divine will of one revealed precept by another. He is quite a dialectician in this matter: God gives life, and takes it (and grants revival); a dynasty's power is trans- 24 144 mufta'ila, mubaddala 158 mularraf, muftara 180 musta'mala, makduba. s2 203 f., 211, 212.

Y., 1940, p. 292 sq.; I. Friedlander in Zeitschr.f. Assyr., v. 26, 93-110). In comparison with earlier authors Ibn IHazm is neither consistent nor original in his exposition. Goldziher's different impression ZDMG 32, pp. 363 ff. is based on comparison with later authors, and is due to the fact that at the time when he wrote (1878) earlier polemics were unknown. 275</page><page sequence="8">276 PERLMANN [8] ferred into the hands of humble subjects; converted enemies become part and parcel of the religious community. Trans- gression against the Sabbath would make forbidden violence against sinners obligatory. "Precepts are commands to perform certain acts for a definite period, and when the period is over the command may turn into its opposite.""8 The text of the LXX differs considerably from the masoretic text. It appears from a detailed analysis of biblical history that ancient Israel did not know the Torah, did not observe and pre- serve it, but rather did everything to make it extinct. Only the High Priest in Jerusalem was in possession of a copy which he used 3 times a year. The Northern Kingdom was cut off from Jerusalem altogether but even in the Kingdom of Judah matters were hardly any better than in the North; nor were the priests faithful. This clearly demonstrates (199: adwa'u mina-sh-shams) that there was no reliable transmission, and that consequently falsification was possible. Only Deut. 32.1-43 was a passage the Hebrews were enjoined to memorize. But it is an objectionable passage as it stands in the present text.29 The oldest Jewish tradition goes back no further than the days of Hillel and Shammai, Simeon (the Just?) and Mar Akiba (II 83). Not so the Muslim tradition: close to us, it can be traced back in detail and verified by trustworthy witnesses [I 115 II, 81]. In Islam tradi- tion goes back to divinely inspired evidence; whilst the Jews cannot bring evidence from anybody in direct and immediate contact with a prophet (II, 7 ff.; II 84). Who then produced the present text? Who was the forger? He must have been a liar, a contemptible character, either an ignorant ass or a conscious, purposeful, malicious, arch- misleader; nay, he must have been a coarse atheist, scoffing and mocking at any belief or religious feeling, who viciously 28 100 . .Ash-shara'i' innamd hiya awdmir fi waqt mafidd bi-'amal mab- dfid.

But in a few passages he names him definitely: Ezra, the Aaronid scribe who flourished sometime before the second destruction.32 From his memory he put together the pieces of old tradition, filling up the lacunae. This took place about 40 years after the 70-year captivity. Actually only under the Hasmoneans did the Torah spread and thus, 400 years after the destruction of the ancient kingdom, a new religion (shari'ajadida) arose, the work of the sages (ahbar). The survey of the biblical writings outside the Pentateuch is brief, sketchy, and abounds in mistakes. Here one does not have the impression of study and real knowledge of the text. Perhaps Ibn HIazm used a set of excerpts supplied to him?33 The still shorter section on Talmudic material was of course 30 120 kadddb muftarin 179 "We have never heard of a more reprehensible character and more corrupt disposition - except those who follow him and believe him."

Biblical passages appear here, evidently as a result of confusion of biblical and post-biblical material.35 The stories remind the author of old wives' tales.36 On such absurdities, and on their authors, the Jews base their religion. These authors were as bad at computations as the bible- forger. The Talmud was also compiled by atheists (mulhidun la dina lahum). They bribed Paul and sent him to mislead the early Christians by teaching them to believe in Jesus' divinity.37 Now the Christians must have been, in the opinion of the rabbis, either right or wrong; if they were right- why did the rabbis want to mislead them? If they were wrong why did the rabbis want to deepen this error instead of putting matters straight? The Jews possibly wanted to corrupt Islam in the same way by fomenting schism by the propaganda of 'Abdallah b. Saba'.38 Ibn Hazm works himself up to fever-heat over the legends about R. Ismael meeting the Shekhina mourning the destruction of the Temple. The Jews, "that is the Rabbanites amongst them," glorify Metatron, the Little Lord (ar-rabb as-,aghZr), on the Day of Atonement.39 This last passage might make us think of a Karaite source. Ibn Hazm mentions Ananites in Toledo and Talavera (99): they accept only what the prophets enjoined, repudiating the rabbis and their inventions.

Ibn Hazm, known for his vehemence, is blunt in these pages. Dirty, vile, filthy, stinking are epithets he frequently hurls against the Jews.4' Everyone who knows them, he contends, recognizes that they are the filthiest people, a villainous breed, false, mean and cowardly (202). Ps. 103,15-16 ("his days are as grass, as a flower of the field") shows an atheist materialist con- cept, he says, "and indeed the religion of the Jews tends strongly towards that, for there is not in their Torah any mention of the next world, or of reward after death .... They combine mater- ialism, plurality in deity, anthropomorphism, and every stupidity in the world." He judges not by chapter and verse only but by the qualities he ascribes to the Jewish people. Jacob filched the blessing assigned to Esau: "By God, it is the way of the Jews. You will not find among them, with rare exceptions, but a treacherous villain (al-khabit al-mukhddi', 138)" "They, both the ancient and the modern, are altogether the worst liars. Though I have encountered many of them, I have never seen among them a truth seeker, except two men only" (156).42 "They are the filthiest and vilest of peoples, their unbelief horrid, their ignorance abominable" (154). Among minds, theirs are like the odor of garlic among odors (180). What a people, what a lineage! Abraham marries his own sister. Isaac is a thief. Jacob married Leah in error.

Sometimes their leaders perceive the truth but will be stubborn against reason in blind fidelity to their ancestors (taqlid al-asldf), and group feeling ('aaabZya), and the desire to perpetuate their worldly position (116: istiddmatan li-ri'dsa dunyawiya).44 Ibn Hazm returned to this subject in the refutation of a pamphlet by Samuel ibn Nagdela that contained notes critical of the Koran. He had heard of the pamphlet but was unable to obtain a copy. Instead he found a refutation of it written by a Muslim, and having learned from it the arguments of Samuel, he set out to refute them with all the knowledge and skill he could muster.45 The Refutation consists of an introduction, eight chapters, epilogue and conclusion. Each of the eight chapters refutes an argument of Samuel's: the latter is reproduced, followed by deprecatory remarks and a logical rejoinder. In a counterblast, 42 Cf. 131, 213. 43 Cf. 135, 147 f. 44 99 f. Some share the view of the 'Isawiya that Jesus and Muhammad also were prophets. "I often came across prominent Jews that were close to this view." From an ancient Aaronid's history Ibn HIazm concludes that prom- inent Jews of the first century had recognized the truth in the teachings of the Baptist and of Jesus. Asin Palacios (Abenhazam II, 45, 212 f., n. 87) concluded that Ibn Iazm had read Josephus. This is improbable. Ibn HIazm used a Yosippon text. Cf. ed. Gunzbourg-Kahana col. 361. S. Krauss, Leben Jesu p. 238 f., 300 n. 6. The Christ passage occurs, e. g. in Ta'rikh Yusifus al-Yahkud, Beirut 1872, p. 211 f. In the passage on the Ananites (p. 99) Asfn Palacios (v. II p. 211, and n. 85) evidently misinterpreted the rJJlj Ul-iJ of the text. The Jews could not call them the followers of Anan "the exilarch". Possibly, the Arabic con- ceals a distortion of o''l o'swp (i. e. "the Ananites whom the Jews call Karaites and heretics").

The epilogue lists Jewish errors and sacrileges. Thus the pattern used in Fisal appears here in reverse: first comes the defense of the Koran, then follows the critique of a bible passage. Again we find theological material, or rather critique and counter-critique of passages of sacred texts of Jew and Muslim. The real difference between the two works (apart from size) is the specific tone of the introduction and the conclusion of the pamphlet. Here Ibn Hazm attacks the Jews, especially Samuel, for their domination of the country, the state and its resources. But even more bitter, perhaps, is his feeling against the ruler or rulers who allowed matters to reach such a stage. Muslim kings, absorbed in worldly matters, neglect their faith; building castles, enjoying pleasures; greed makes them neglect even the defense of the believers against infidels. The Jews, devoid of power, use fraud, hypocrisy, false submissiveness to work their way into high society, and know how to conceal their hatred for the Prophet and his community. In his impudence Samuel even dared to write against the Koran. Of him one might say with Mutanabbi: "If nobly you act towards a noble man, you gain his fealty; But if nobly you act toward a villain, he will rebel. To greatness, generosity in place of the sword is as harmful As the use of the sword in the place of generosity." "Oh, God, we complain to Thee for the rulers of our faith absorbed in wordly affairs neglect the observance of their religion; absorbed in erecting castles - may they soon abandon these they do not cultivate their sacred faith which accompanies them in the life to come, in their abode eternal; absorbed in piling up riches - sometimes with results fatal to their own lives, and helpful to their enemies - they are deflected from their faith and people which gave them strength in their earthly life, and can secure to them life eternal.

I was fortunate, and obtained a manuscript con- taining a refutation written by a Muslim. So I copied out the passages the polemist had reproduced from the work of that ignominious ignoramus. I proceeded at once, with God's help, to refute his evil thoughts. By God, his argumentation proves how poor is his knowledge, how narrow his mind, about which I already knew something.

The arguments of the Jew are futile, his reasoning poor. And his is the leader ('amid) of the Jews, their great man, their scholar. If he at least knew Arabic! He asks why the Koran ascribes healing power to honey (16.71) since those who are fevered, or whose bile is inflamed are made worse by honey. Does God say that all diseases are cured by honey? Not at all. The text says very clearly: some people. Such a statement is true. He might have remembered that a biblical prophet (II. Kings XX.7) performed cures with honey; and in that hodge-podge (ikhtil2t) which the Jews call the Torah, the highest praise given to Palestine is that it flows with milk and honey. The epilogue lists biblical (and a few talmudic) passages, illustrative of anthropomorphism, contradictions, the coarseness and stupidity of the Jewish scriptures. The Jews were promised 283</page><page sequence="16">284 PERLMANN [16] a land of their own but find themselves under Muslim yoke. Their exilarchs are bastards, and so were their kings and Moses, all begotten in unions unlawful under their own law. A short review explains how the Torah was compiled by Ezra. The theological scriptural section is thus sandwiched between attacks on Granada's ruler and his Jewish minister. The ruler is threatened with the people's discontent and Allah's wrath, while Samuel is denounced as a man blinded by wealth, arro- gant, devoid of "the slightest knowledge of human nature, with no understanding of the resources of the Arabic language."4sb The poetical counterpart of the publicist's motifs in Ibn- Hazm's Refutation can be found in the poem by Abu Islaq al-Elbiri directed against Joseph b. Samuel.46 It also threatens the ruler with popular discontent for employing a Jew in high office, and decries Jewish domination of the country. Several sources ascribe to the poem a role almost decisive in bringing about the outbreak of 1066 which put an end to the forty years of administration of Samuel and Joseph, and in which Joseph was killed among three thousand other Jewish victims.

A sincere friend of the Sinhaja Berbers, the poet offers them advice. Here, too, from the very outset, responsibility for the evil of Jewish domination is placed squarely on the ruler. Your lord has sadly erred And his foes are rejoicing He selected an infidel to be his Katib Who, if your lord wished, could have been a believer... It was not even of their own (the Jews') making For from our midst arises the accomplice.49 The king is also addressed directly; how could he, shrewd man that he is, overlook the evil while all over the land people deplore the rise to power of the bastard upstarts. This makes the prince unpopular. Appointing the Jew is also against the word of Allah. There is an undertone of intimidation and threat: The earth trembles from their (the Jews') immorality And is almost heaving under us all.

The Jews have broken the covenant (i. e. overstepped their station) and compunction would be out of place.53 They are in charge of your secrets But how can the faithless be trusted. Muslims are poorly fed while the infidels gather at sumptuous feasts. They slaughter animals in the town's market places and the Muslims eat what remains.54 Above all rises the evil image of the Jewish courtier. That ape of theirs had his home paved with marble And made the purest of springs flow thither. Our affairs are his charge And we have to wait at his gateSS While he ridicules us and our religion. Proudly the Jews ride about the city; their prayers rise louder than those of the Muslims.

There were intrigues against Joseph, and the king was told: "He devours your wealth, has become master over most of your possessions, and erected a palace better than yours. By God, remove him and gain the sympathies of the Muslims by getting rid of him."59 Apparently, there was an attempt to rise against Joseph when rumor spread 56 Cf. Peres 240.

It is remarkable that in the memoirs Samuel figures as the venerable Abu Ibrahim ash-Shaykh (Andalus v. 6), and only Joseph comes in for rough treatment. In an illuminating passage Samuel's appointment is explained (ib., 11 f. tr. p. 30): There was in the Jew so much shrewdness and skill in handling people that was well suited to the time of Samuel and Badis and to the people who were intriguing against them. Badis therefore used Samuel out of distrust for (isti1ashan) others, and because he saw the ill-will of his own kith and kin; further because Samuel was a Jew, a dimmi, not aspiring to any power. Nor was Samuel a Spaniard who might have become dangerous in a crisis by joining hands with a prince of another race (or: line). Badis needed monies with which to woo his kith and kin and to secure power (the editor translates wayuzawilu bihd amra-l-mulki: et de regler certaines affaires). Badis could not do without one like Samuel who would collect for him sums with which to carry out his plans ((yajma'u lahu mina-l-amwal md yudriku ma'ahd-l-idml), without imposition, right or wrong, on any Muslim; and because the people of the city (Granada) and the treasury officials were mostly Jews, and Samuel would collect the monies from them and give them to Badis. 59 269/292.</page><page sequence="21">[21] ANDALUSIAN AUTHORS ON THE JEWS OF GRANADA that he had had the crown prince poisoned. Feelings ran high and his life was in danger "This was the foreboding of his de- struction".60 Aware of the intrigue against him, Joseph allegedly said: "Our scoffing at the people has been for the sake of the sultan's glory. We have believed ourselves safe from them under his protection. Yet now there is no more hope: no sultan to grant us safety, while a vile rival is plotting against us at the court and the populace seeks our destruction. And we are few and weak upon the earth"6' Rumor had it that Joseph was plotting with a neighboring ruler in the hope of establishing a Jewish principality. "He betrayed us". A drunkard's shouting in this strain mobilized the mob, resentful of the unprecedented elevation of Jews in office.62 There were also laudatory poems honoring the Nagids. In rhymed prose a Muslim says "I profess the religion of the Sab- bath openly when I am with you, and in secret when I am with my own people". This seems to be an exceptional case.63 For that matter the Muslim sources recognize the high attainments of the Nagids, mention Joseph's wide intellectual interests, his excellent Islamic library, etc. Still the main point remains: the Nagids, infidels, ruled over Muslims. Joseph "did not know the humbleness of the dimmi or the filth of Jewishness".64 It seems that the feeling pervading all the utterances of the Muslim authors was one of resentment at the sight of temporary suspension of dull, humiliation, through the rise of the Jewish courtiers.64a It is also instructive that Jewish authors felt most 60 266/285. 6 269/292. 62 Ib.ta, p. 266 and al-Bayan: wa-ddlika anna h&amp;dd-l-la'in ftlaba an yuqlma li-l-yahiud daula (This accursed one sought to establish a government for the Jews.)

Daniel also described our humiliation solely under Ishmael- may God crush him soon! (Daniel VIII.) ... We have to bear the humiliations they impose upon us, and their calumnies which are beyond human endurance.
