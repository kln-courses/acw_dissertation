This almost photographically accurate panorama, in which every detail seems executed with love, has a nostalgic sense of place which sets it apart from contemporary city views. Touches like the smoke rising from the chimneys recall "the blue smoke curling up from a cottage chimney" which epitomized Cole's feeling of relief after a storm in the Catskills, and his remarks on "cultivated" land scape "mingled with a thousand domestic affections and heart-touching associations"2 suggest the city's significance for the artist and will help clarify what is unique, personal, and American about a painting that may seem but a charming period piece of the Age of Sentiment. Emotional concentration on familiar architecture, such as in Cole's painting, was rare in his time, despite Romantic feeling for specific location which began to flourish in nineteenth-century landscape painting. His contemporaries had a passion for fact and imaginations that could "wrest a significant statement out of particularities."3 But Cole's choice of the par ticular would have seemed unexciting to many Ro mantic painters for whom "significance" lay in the formal, or obviously dramatic, emotive possibilities of the isolated fact, or in featuring its picturesque ness (Fig. 2). His city cannot be compared with that of painters like Dahl or Corot who saw Florence in more purely pictorial and painterly terms; or with the generalized vistas expressing cosmic space and atmosphere like those of Turner. Nor had the con creteness of particular fact the significance for Cole that it had for naturalistic painters. The vehicles for Romantic mood were often dominant nature and weather conditions. Cole, however, exploited these in a way that reveals his sympathy with past painters of ideal landscapes, like Claude Lorraine and Richard Wilson. The luminous distance and radiant atmos phere enveloping the city are a poetic setting that idealizes Florence (a function that the foreground figures also undertake). His classic way of idealizing here (though not his realism) links Cole with his Classic-Romantic German contemporaries rather than with the moodier English and Scandinavian weather interpretations which have more in common with some of Cole's other landscapes. His ideal here is an unhackneyed subject, rooted in reality, and the influence of an Italianate tradition in this painting is modified and differs from that influence in the paint ings of his American contemporaries. Just as this city-scape can to some extent be pin-pointed in its contemporary European context (although as fur ther analysis will show, it is in many ways representa tive of its time), it can also be isolated from the Italian landscapes of Cole's countrymen, yet emerge as characteristically American. At the same time, the painting is exceptional within Cole's own oeuvre, while remaining very much his own. Most Americans who went to Italy in the first half of the nineteenth century were intrigued by the ro mance of classical ruins, of obviously picturesque sites like Tivoli, and of local color provided by pious and musical peasants. They sometimes interpreted these in the "Gothic" style and mood of the German Romantics. But on the whole they saw Italy through eyes oriented by two centuries of Italianate landscape tradition, and to them Italy-land of a classic ideal, rich in a poetry of the past which their own country lacked-was the pictures of Claude and Salvator Rosa come true. Italian Landscape (Fig. 3) painted in 1830 by Washington Allston (then dean of Ameri can painters) years after his return from Italy, illus trates the Romantic impact of that country on Ameri cans. Their Arcadias were often filled with a mood of reverie more dream-like than that of Cole's Flor ence, and are based either on intrinsically Romantic motifs, or on ones more imagined than real. That Cole himself to a large extent shared this vision of his American contemporaries is evident from such paintings as Italian Landscape (Fig. 4) and from the silhouetted Neapolitan grottoes and templed hillsides of his Arcadian scenes. Other views, though more realistic and monumental than the latter, share the typically Romantic subjects and moods of his generation. Like all the rest he painted a smoking Mt. Aetna and "his Roman aqueduct breathes the sublime desolation of the Campagna ... the silent arena of a vanished world."4 In his own day Cole was most famous for his moralizing canvases, The Course of Empire and Voyage of Life. Now he is best known as founder of 13</page><page sequence="3">BELOW: Figure 2. A View of Florence. Oil on canvas. Karl Rottmann, German, 1797-1850. Hamburg, Kunsthalle. RIGHT: Figure 3.

Less well known are the commissioned views of country seats like that of Monte Video, architec tural subjects which are almost swallowed in their natural surroundings. There are also drawings and engravings of city views, but these were probably done especially for publishers of histories of Ameri can topography5 and are not as sentimentally treated as View of Florence. Nor, to the writer's knowledge, do any paintings of these city views survive. What then does this apparently atypical architec tural landscape represent in Cole's career? This began soon after his arrival in America. Lured with his family by Wordsworthian descriptions of the Ameri can wilderness from England where he was born in 1801, he wandered from 1818 to 1825 between the Ohio frontier and New York City, delighting in the forests and mountains. In 1821 an English book on painting illustrated with engravings after Claude, Salvator Rosa, and others fired his ambition to ex press this delight in paint. His graphic experience had consisted of apprenticeships to a calico designer and wood engraver in England. For the rest he was largely self-trained. Perhaps this lack of practical guidance together with his poetic, literary bent ac counts for the influence on him of current aesthetic theory, a composite of classical tenets and Romantic ideas. According to the former, reality should be studied only in order to be idealized in imagined "compositions." Landscape, considered lacking in that human emphasis most capable of elevating and instructing, was ranked low in the hierarchy of sub jects by critical opinion. Pantheistic Romantic litera ture, however, extolled raw nature as equally capable, through religious and emotional associations, of ele vating the spectator. These theories with their double standard of realism and idealism, emphasizing ex pressive content over form, took root in Cole's mind.6 .Throughout his career he tried to reconcile them, since his love for nature was combined with ambition and a strong religious moral sense. Because, like many of his contemporaries, he tried to express poetic concepts in paint and because of his concern with elevating content, his work must be viewed as "at least half literary efforts"7 and the moral sought. 14</page><page sequence="4">Figure 4.

Fortunately this theoretical background was sup plemented by practice. Following the "classic" rules, Cole painted landscapes by selecting from his truth ful outdoor sketches those which could be combined in studio compositions based on those of old masters available through engravings.8 In 1825 these early landscapes were successful in New York. National ism was flourishing in America and Cole's paintings of the American wilderness, with their Romantic sentiment of nature were acclaimed as patriotic odes by a public eager for a great native art. But the means for training artists in America were few, and long standing precedent sent them to Europe and, since Allston's visit, to Italy. So Cole set off for Europe in 1829, and after spend ing two years in England and France, arrived in Flor ence in 1831. He soon felt a freedom there which he expressed in a letter to the critic William Dunlap. "Florence to me was a delightful residence... ." There was "freedom from the cares and business of life, the vortex of politics and utilitarianism that is forever whirling at home .... The pictures of the great Ital ian masters . . . are produced on principles of truth and not on abstract notions of the sublime or beauti ful. I do not believe they theorized as we do .... They loved the beauty they saw around them and painted."9 The close correspondence between the sketches made in Florence (Fig. 5) and the later painting suggests that this realization (however temporary in effect) may have encouraged him to rely more on his own vision and to modify his views on "composed" land scapes. The same tendencies may have been encouraged by his companion in Florence, down-to-earth, Horatio Greenough of the "form-follows-function" aesthetic. In Greenough's milieu Cole's interest in architecture developed (while he remained loyal to American nature). He made many drawings of the buildings of Florence and after his return to America was to paint architectural fantasies in a firmer, dryer style and to submit a design for the facade of the Ohio capitol. His style acquired a neo-classic flavor evident in the objective View of the Quirinal (Fig. 6). This work reveals his passion for architecture, but lacks that more sentimental emotion which was to Cole the chief desideratum in art, and perhaps because of this 15</page><page sequence="5">L'~ .: I.. p n es :??;;r :ri. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~9 :11::~A` .h; N, ---w ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~,~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Fakut a', G inn i e r Figur S VN Detroit InstituteofArts (couesyoftheArchivesofAmericanArtMicrofilmDivision) .. .. . . ... :~~::Fi i' I ? i:de :i~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~iii?~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~'i Bel ze; .?,,? ; j :%~ "?"

For it was not Rome, but the smaller more provincial Florence, where country and city combine, that Cole loved as his second home. Out of his memory of Florence may have been born Cole's dream of a future American architecture, expressed in a letter against the current imitative styles10 and in his lecture on American scenery."1 This dream sprang from a disillusion: in his Ameri can landscapes Cole never introduced a town or vil lage. Actual urban life in America had been distaste ful to him; he had found the wilderness spoiled by crude new towns with "none of the beauties of art."12 Moreover, among the ruins of the Campagna near Rome, where he had spent several months in 1832 before returning to Florence, Cole caught what was in the air and in such writings as Volney's Ruines ...: a preoccupation with the stages and ultimate doom of wordly power and progress, the theme of his Course of Empire. Like his idol, Claude, Cole dreamed of a Golden Age. But Cole, living in an age of practical utopianism, believed with inconsistent optimism in its actual renewal. Because of his American circum stances, perhaps Florence represented for Cole the perpetuation of a civilization where art and Christian virtue still survived in harmony with nature.13 After his return to America the melancholy theme of the Course of Empire, and the chopping down of trees and installation of a railroad near his Catskill home, must have increased the poignance of Cole's memory of Florence. For, despite his early love for the wild, he had written in 1828, "the sublime fea tures of nature are too severe for a lone man to look upon and be happy";14 and, in 1841, "although American scenery is often so fine, we feel the want of associations such as cling to the old world. Simple nature is not quite sufficient. We want human interest to render the effect of landscape complete."'5 Thus Florence represented what was lacking in America's rural landscape and in a wilderness succumbing to progress.16 A younger Cole, however, had been stirred by scientific progress and excited by the popular pano rama spectacles. It has been pointed out that Cole's paintings are the first step in the development of the panoramic painting that was to be the mode of his American successors.17 View of Florence is Cole's 16</page><page sequence="6">j"~ m .....bp S ~~~-"~~~~~~~ ~~ ~.---?: ??, i.......':, E , Dalkon :: If-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~F -:~:?? t.r???:, i.: -.4 I ~ ~~i ~ , :~,i'~~~~:, ~?.: i:: ?~~. j- . - . : .

The panorama as a pictorial principle is "the equivalent of a wide angle view in photography,"'8 enlarging the bird's-eye view used by landscapists to convey effects of cosmic space. Cole's Oxbow, painted in 1836, follows this principle, but there the space feeling is subordinated to melodramatic emphasis on contrasting moods which give it a feeling of tension. The panoramic composition of View of Florence, however, well supports Cole's theory that "in pic tures of a quiet character it is proper to introduce much detail. When we view the lovely scenes of nature, the eye runs about from one object of beauty to another; it delights in the minute as well as in the vast."19 Florence is spread out horizontally, full of minute detail, given vastness and unity by the two horizontals of the foreground and background joined by the diagonal of the Arno which gives a dynamic recession in space. Compared with the more staged and generalized Italian landscapes of eighteenth-century painters like Richard Wilson, the realism and dynamic space feel ing, the immediacy of the presentation, the sparkle and vigorous handling of the nineteenth century are clearly evident in Cole's view. He has also abandoned the traditional foreground framing devices on which he often relied-such as large trees which in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries gave a distant focus to the ideal landscape by dwarfing the back ground. Yet his treatment of the sky and luminous distance, his eye for the lyrical river and mountains, the pastoral touches, remind us that his favorite painters were Claude and Richard Wilson.20 And the zoning of his canvas in rather flat, silhouetted planes, making abrupt but clearly constructed transitions in space, probably results from his early study of en gravings after these masters (in which the atmos pheric perspective and tonal gradations would be largely lost) as well as from his graphic training in England. In the foreground Cole resorted to a conventional device for establishing the panoramic point of view. He emphasized the horizontal wall to detach the viewer from the view, to suggest a limitless expansion in space, and to inspire a contemplative mood. Ranged in a row against this wall the tiny figures 17</page><page sequence="7">"read" like an explanatory caption. The meditating monk, the musical peasants, and the goats, instead of merely reflecting an eighteenth-century love for local color with pastoral connotations seem more seriously intended than, for example, the Rococo gathering in Italian Landscape (Fig. 4) and represent the moral of the painting, the Christian and pastoral virtues of Cole's Golden Age. That Cole may have sensed an awkwardness here and had difficulty inventing fore grounds is suggested by the unfinished View of the Quirinal (Fig. 6) in which he attempted to avoid the wall cliche of View of Florence by experimenting with roof-tops over the lightly sketched balustrade with the familiar potted plant. To the traditional and contemporary elements in View of Florence are added those characteristically American ones which Cole, surrounded by them and painting from memory, loved. Thus the Apennines are treated like the Catskills of Cole's rural Ameri can landscapes of this period, while an American crystal clarity of atmosphere throws the city into sharp detail, although notations on the sketches de scribe the day as hazy. Cole expressed his interest in light and atmosphere in metaphysical terms.21 But while his treatment is less empirical than that of the European and later American luminists who painted out of doors, it anticipates the American luminist style: "a minute attention to carefully drawn detail, delicate modulations of tone, and a broad envelop ing effect of light."22 In a broader sense as well, View of Florence is typically American. Respect for truth to nature, demand for literal realism, and high valuation of conscientious treatment can be attributed to the same positive puritanical strain which "gave Romanticism a deeper ethical interest in the New World"23 and resulted in Cole's moral responsibility toward his art and public. Cole's own later works were criticized for "having too much the appearance of paint,"24 and Cole himself was shocked by the British "mania for generalization" and by "the ostentatious gaud of art that tempts the eye but touches not the heart."25 High finish was not only the reputed hallmark of an old master, but a sign of conscientious craft, and Cole was appalled by the lack of glazing and varnishing in contemporary Italian painting. A similar puritan ism underlay the preference of an earlier American public (whose religion was almost anti-aesthetic and whose outlook was by necessity somewhat utilitarian and materialistic) for informative and useful like nesses of people and places. These traits, tempered by Nationalism and Roman ticism, persisted in the genius of American painting for characterizing the particular and in its increas ingly emotional realism. They are clearly evident in the local emphasis in Cole's View of Florence and in its meticulous execution and smooth finish. They continue with Cole's successors, Church and Bierstadt who, in huge panoramas of American scenery, tried to reconcile local realism and a growing interest in atmospheric effects with a popular demand for na tive art in a grand style. Perhaps one can look for a more recent parallel to Cole's "sense of place" in the American regional schools of the twentieth century, in the houses and towns of a Hopper or a Burchfield. These buildings reveal the significance of a local kind of architecture which, through the artist's deep familiarity with it, acquires an anthropomorphic character; like Cole's Florence they are represented for nostalgic reasons because they are home. To Cole, home in America was the wild and rural landscape, but as his remarks show he missed the symbols of society's harmony with nature which give man security and roots in vast spaces."" The town architecture, that for him could characterize home in America, he foresaw only in the future. The specifically local and homesick mood evoked in Cole's provincial treatment of Florence is rarely found in European architectural landscapes, except in certain post-war paintings. One feels that European painters were used to houses and towns long a part of their heritage and environment. A real city is seldom focused on as intrinsically expressive of it self in an anthropomorphic way. Looking at a Hop per, however, makes one become conscious of the buildings representing a local essence in human terms. The moods Romantic landscape painters evoked in capturing effects of nature and the weather, later American painters found in domestic architec ture. Cole's View of Florence seems to foreshadow this development. ELIZABETH OURUSOFF Assistant, Department of Paintings 18</page><page sequence="8">161.39.
