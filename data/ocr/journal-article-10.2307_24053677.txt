The Adelie penguin Pygoscelis adeliae and the south polar skua Catharacta maccormicki are two of the most familiar birds of high latitude Antarctica. Casual observations would suggest that at penguin colonies where skuas are present, penguins provide a bountiful resource on which the breeding skuas depend almost exclusively. In this book, describing their interactions as prey and predator at Cape Bird, Ross Island over five seasons in the late 1960s, Euan Young shows that appearances are deceptive. Skua and penguin come together during the breeding season because both require the same snow-free nesting sites and access to open water. Their principal prey are key elements of the food web of the Ross Sea, respectively the Antarctic silverfish Pleuragramma antarcticum and the krill Euphausia crystallorophias. Most skuas feed on fish at sea for much of the time during the breeding season. Their intense territorial defence, however, enables a few pairs to monopolise penguin breeding groups, yet even these vary in their interest in penguins as a prey resource. Skuas cannot overpower adult penguins and can take only eggs and chicks, but many are indifferent even to these. Nevertheless, a few individuals inflict intense and sustained prédation pressure. Such birds, through single-mindedness and willingness to take risks, can greatly augment the food available to them but only by targeting vulnerable nest sites or penguins that are temporarily inattentive during squabbles or nest changeovers. Yet even for skuas breeding amongst the penguins the rewards are limited. Penguin eggs are not profitable for food until well incubated (the contents of fresh eggs are easily lost when broken) and chicks are only vulnerable for a short period. Once they grow to a size that a skua cannot lift in an aerial attack, chicks in the centre of a breeding group are invulnerable and skua attacks are only successful at the periphery. Yet at this stage in the season the colony periphery is reoccupied by returning nonbreeding penguins who vigorously resist skua attacks. By the time parent penguins desert the colony the chicks are too big to be successfully attacked. A further factor limiting the skuas' opportunities for prédation is that the breeding seasons of the two species are out of phase with each other; penguins begin breeding sooner and finish earlier than skuas. Thus, from mid-season onwards and by the time skua chicks are at their most demanding, the penguin colony is deserted and there is little food remaining. The skua breeding season is one of food shortage and almost none rear both their chicks. Exclosure experiments proved that penguin breeding failure was widespread without the influence of skuas and that the skuas themselves inflicted only minor losses. Indeed, provided the penguin groups within a skua territory were not so small and exposed as to be fatally vulnerable, a</page><page sequence="2">90 NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY, VOL. 19, NO. 1, 1995 territorial skua afforded protection against marauding skuas from other territories. Penguins not so protected were fair game for all. Overall, the picture that emerges is of an indifferent predator not well equipped to exploit its most visible apparent prey. Yet such prédation pressure, even if sporadic, has undoubtedly shaped the evolution of penguin breeding behaviour in dense colonies. It is in the skuas' exploitation of their fish prey and the decision making processes that drive prey switching that the gaps in our knowledge are greatest; an attempt at a detailed comparison of the energetics of foraging at sea and at the colony shows how much work is yet to be done. Euan Young's book will find its readership mainly amongst polar biologists. Other ecologists will find many rewarding insights into predator-prey interactions but these are scattered through some quite long descriptions of the minutiae of the study. For example, the basic descriptions of the birds' behaviours are augmented with such detail of their variations that they can seem merely pedantic. The individual chapters would have greatly benefited from summaries of the main points they make. Happily, this precise description is frequently made more accessible by an apt turn of phrase, an occasional anthropomorphism, or wry aside from the observer himself. The 'feel' of the Antarctic environment at Cape Bird as a place to do fieldwork is well described, and the ability of the author to 'think out loud', whether about the birds' behaviours or their energetics constraints, is illuminating to the non-specialist. The long gestation period of the present book has had an interesting consequence - the style of study is very much that of descriptive natural history, nowadays unfashionable, but the data are presented with the benefit of a modern behavioural ecologist's hindsight in a clear framework of precise and searching questions. It is the fastidiousness of the original observations that made such a re evaluation possible and which makes this a benchmark study of predator-prey relations.
