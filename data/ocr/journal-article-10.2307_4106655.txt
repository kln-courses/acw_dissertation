<plain_text><page sequence="1">PURPOSE AND INTELLIGENT ACTION By MR. ALASDAIR MACINTYRE AND PROFESSOR P. H. NOWELL-SMITH I-ALASDAIR MACINTYRE The scope of this paper is restricted by its aim. Its aim is to carry through an analysis of the concept of intelligence such that it might both illuminate and assist the empirical enquiries of psychologists. But this aim could be frustrated by attending to it too closely and too narrowly. What we need is not perhaps from the outset to concentrate upon what psychologists have done and said, but rather to put the psychological enterprise into conceptual perspective. So the first part of the paper will attempt to provide an analysis which will be independent of anything that may have been achieved in psychology. It is in the course of this initial analysis that the important links between the concept of intelligence and the concept of purpose will be exhibited. I When I call a piece of behaviour intelligent the precise way in which I intend to characterise it will usually be clear from the context in which my judgment is made. For it is certainly the case that the word 'intelligent' may be put to a number of different, if related, uses. I want to distinguish three different concepts of intelligence, three senses of 'intelligent' therefore. In distinguishing them I also hope to bring out their intimate inter-relationship. But I am not claiming that these are the only senses of the word. The first sense is that in which we ascribe intelligence to someone who learns to carry through correctly some routine performance. Someone may object at once that being able to carry through a routine is never a mark of intelligence; do we not, as Ryle and others have remarked, precisely contrast intelligent</page><page sequence="2">80 ALASDAIR MACINTYRE behaviour with well-drilled, routine behaviour? Sometimes we certainly do. " Don't act like an automaton; show some intelli- gence ", we say. But we do apply the word 'intelligent' to routine performances where the routine is sufficiently intricate; and we also apply it to individuals who show themselves capable of acquiring a sufficient variety of different simple routines. By a routine I mean any performance for the carrying through of which a recipe can be provided. Anything which could be carried through by a machine counts as a routine. Deduction, chess-playing, cross-word puzzle solving, cooking and ship- building are all routines. Routines have recognized beginnings, middles and ends. The mark of successful routine behaviour is that it passes from the beginning to the end by means of rule- governed methods. The agent need not be able to formulate the rules governing his behaviour, but his passage from initial to final position must be more than a lucky stroke and he must be able to recognize and to distinguish cases of rule-following and rule-breaking. The evidence necessary to show that the agent's achievement was more than a lucky stroke is evidence of ability to repeat the behaviour. It is certainly possible to characterise as intelligent a single and unrepeated performance, but in so characterising it we commit ourselves to holding that the agent could in similar circumstances repeat it. In this, as in most, but not all other senses of 'intelligent' we ascribe many varying degrees of intelligence. ' Unintelligent' and 'intelligent' are normally used with reference to the standards of attainment which can reasonably be expected from those who share the relevant characteristics of the agent. So that a performance which would be classed as unintelligent, or at least as not particularly intelligent, in an adult may be considered highly intelligent in a small child. The second distinct sense of 'intelligent' to be considered is one in which a man may be capable of mastering highly intricate routines and yet be rightly called 'unintelligent.' Here for the first time the concept of intelligence appears as linked to the concept of a purpose. Suppose an adult to be playing a game of chess with a sick child. The sick child is desperately anxious to win; the adult is playing the game in order to keep the child</page><page sequence="3">PURPOSE AND INTELLIGENT ACTION 81 happy. But the adult exercises all his skill to win again and again and the child in fact is bitterly disappointed. An onlooker might well stigmatise the adult's behaviour as thoroughly unintelligent; but the manifestation of skill at chess would undubitably be evidence of intelligence in the first sense. We are therefore confronted with a new sense of 'intelligent', that namely in which to say that an agent is intelligent is to say that his use of routine, techniques and skills is well-designed to achieve whatever purpose the agent has in mind. In this sense of' intelligent ' to grade a performance as more or less intelligent or unintelligent is impossible unless one knows what the agent's purpose is. The purpose is not necessarily written on the face of the performance. Consider the case of a man who uses subtle techniques of flattery towards someone powerful who is well- known to be suspicious of adulation. " How unintelligent of him," people say, " all that he can do if he goes on like that is to antagonise the Vice-Chancellor." But suppose his aim is to antagonise. Then in this sense his behaviour is highly intelligent. As with the first sense, to call a man intelligent in this sense is to suppose that what he achieves is not just a lucky stroke. The appropriateness of the use of the routine, technique or skill for achieving the agent's purpose must be capable of some sort of justification which will involve one or more empirical generalisations. But once again also the agent need not be capable of formulating the justification. So much the two senses have in common. But how much more have they? Can a man be intelligent in the second sense without being intelligent in the first sense? At first sight the answer seems to be straightforwardly 'No.' For a man cannot (logically cannot) put routines, techniques or skills to the service of a purpose unless he is master to at least some extent of the routines, techniques or skills in question. But this consideration only seems to provide an unqualifiedly negative answer to our query if we ignore the distinction between being able to put a routine, technique or skill to the service of some purpose and being able to see that the routine, technique or skill is well-suited to the carrying out of that purpose. 'Seeing that' is in this F</page><page sequence="4">82 ALASDAIR MACINTYRE context a matter of being able to recognise what kind of per- formance would be appropriate to achieve the particular purpose; it does not necessarily involve being able to formulate the justification of its appropriateness. Someone might always be able to see what to do, but never have the requisite skill to do it. He would be intelligent in a sense closely akin to and parasitic upon this second sense. Clearly one might manifest intelligence in this last sense in either of two ways. One might show that one recognized the technique appropriate to one's purpose by saying what it was; or one might show one's recognition by attempting to employ the relevant technique even although one failed to do so. Thus manifestations of intelligence in this sense are not restricted to language-users; and this is true of intelligence in the central as well as in the peripheral uses of this second main sense of 'intelligent'. An animal may, for example, use trial and error methods to find out which of several techniques is well- designed for his purpose; or may dispense with such methods and still exhibit intelligence in the choice of technique by repeatedly choosing appropriate techniques. It follows that we may ascribe intelligence to animals, using 'intelligent' in the second as well as in the first sense. To this point I shall return. The third sense of 'intelligent' to which I want to draw attention is that which enables us to stigmatise a man as unintelli- gent because, although he is a master of techniques and skills, and although he is capable of selecting the appropriate techniques and skills for carrying through his purposes, he is inept in his choice of purposes. So a man may be more or less intelligent in his ambitions, for example. A man may be criticised as unintelligent because he devotes himself almost entirely to a single project so that the rest of life is neglected; or he may be criticised as unintelligent because he dissipates his life in too great a variety of projects. The criteria here are those of whether the agent will or will not in fact be satisfied by the kind of life which his pursuit of his particular purposes is bringing into being; and whether he will be as satisfied as he would be by some alternative kind of life. Again, it is in the light of this</page><page sequence="5">PURPOSE AND INTELLIGENT ACTION 83 criterion that one might criticise a man as unintelligent because he devoted himself entirely to trivial pursuits such as stamp- collecting, when capable of far more than this. Can one be correctly called intelligent in this sense without being intelligent in the first two senses also? Here the answer is unqualifiedly ' No '; for it is one of the marks of' intelligence ' in this sense that a man should select purposes which he has some reasonable chance of achieving. This requires that he should be a master of certain routines, skills and techniques and that he should be able to make use of these in such a way that their use is well-matched to his purposes. Clearly although one cannot be intelligent in any degree in this third sense unless one is to some extent intelligent in the second sense, and although also one cannot (with the one qualification which I noted) be intelligent to any degree in the second sense unless one is intelli- gent to some degree in the first sense, it does not follow that the more intelligent one is in the first or second sense, the more intelligent one is in the second or third sense. One man might far excel another in intelligence in the first sense and be far more unintelligent in the second sense; so also with the second and third senses. What does mark off this third sense of 'intelligent' is that to ascribe intelligence in this sense is to imply that the agent is capable of reflective choice, that he can pose alternatives and be criticised for selecting that which will in fact not satisfy him in the long run. To call someone unintelligent in this third sense may be to make such a criticism or it may be to criticise the agent for having chosen without adequate reflection. Hence in this third sense the concept of intelligence has application only to language-users. An animal cannot in this sense be intelligent or unintelligent. It is important that the criterion for deciding whether this concept has application or not is that of whether the agent is capable of reflection, not whether the agent does reflect. For in ascribing intelligence to an agent in this sense one is not asserting that the agent did deliberate about his purpose, but only that he could have done so, and may therefore be criticised for not deliberating or for not deliberating adequately. Once again the agent need not be capable of formulating a F2</page><page sequence="6">84 ALASDAIR MACINTYRE justification for what he has done or not done, but a justification must be formulable. This last point is worth making in case it should be thought that the scales are being weighted in favour of a Platonic- Aristotelian type of life in which reflective theorising plays a large part, and against a Tolstoyan type of life in which reflective theorising plays little or no part. For the Tolstoyan contention is that one makes better choices of purpose by not reflecting; and this is a consideration which not only can only be urged by a reflective agent, but one which it only makes sense to urge in the case of reflective agents. To be a Tolstoyan is not therefore to escape or to be excluded from ascriptions of intelligence in the third sense. There is a further and more important point to be made about the relation between intelligence in all three senses and deliberation. When we judge a man's choice of purposes or his matching of technique to purpose or his carrying through of a performance to be intelligent or unintelligent, we criticise it in the light of what a man would have done who had deliberated before he decided or acted. Unless we knew what it was for action and choice to flow from deliberation, we should lack criteria for judging intelligence. Even the man who performs his complex routine like an automaton is said to do so intelli- gently because rules are formulable and we know what it would be for someone to be aware of these rules and to apply them. Men syllogised before Aristotle; and they also recognised fallacies before Aristotle. But only since Aristotle has it been possible to justify the application of criteria to syllogising performances and to make sense of what syllogisers and fallacy-detectors were doing before Aristotle. Thus the relation between deliberation and intelligent action can be fitted neither into what Professor Ryle (" Knowing How and Knowing That", P.A.S., 1945-6) once called the prevailing view of intelligence nor into what I shall call the Rylean view (doing perhaps about as much injustice to Ryle as Ryle does to the once prevailing view). The antithesis between the latter and the Rylean view is that it is held either that every intelligent action is necessarily preceded by an act of deliberation or that the relation between intelligent</page><page sequence="7">PURPOSE AND INTELLIGENT ACTION 85 action and deliberation is purely contingent and that the concept of intelligent action can be elucidated entirely independently of the concept of deliberation. The Rylean view derives its strength from the fact that we can undeniably cite numerous examples where we ascribe intelligence to behaviour without committing ourselves to asserting that a prior act of deliberation took place. Indeed it follows from some of my earlier arguments that we can do this. Moreover as a matter of fact there obviously are cases where people do behave intelligently without prior acts of deliberation. But from these considerations the Rylean conclu- sion does not follow. (It could perhaps only be thought to follow by a rigid application of the analytic/synthetic dichotomy to conceptual analysis.) What we have to do is to distinguish those types of ascription of intelligence which are central to the concept from those which are peripheral. I have already argued that unless we know what a man would do who had deliberated before acting we would not know how to judge behaviour intelligent or unintelligent. Unless we possessed the concept of intelligent behaviour as the type of behaviour which usually follows from successful deliberation we should not possess the concept of intelligent behaviour. Intelligent behaviour which is not in fact preceded by deliberation we understand to be intelligent by considering what the outcome of deliberation would have been if it had occurred. Thus it is entirely consistent to assert both that intelligent behaviour may occur without prior deliberation and that the concept of intelligent behaviour cannot be elucidated except with reference to the concept of deliberation. This can be elucidated further by considering an argument of Ryle which may appear fatal to my case. Ryle has claimed that the traditional view of intelligence necessarily involves us in an infinite and vicious regress. For on the earlier view, for a piece of behaviour to be intelligent, it must be preceded by an act of deliberation. But this act of deliberation must itself surely also be intelligent, if the behaviour which flows from it is to be so, and if every piece of intelligent behaviour must be preceded by an act of deliberation, then there must be a second act of deliberation prior to the first. But this too must surely</page><page sequence="8">86 ALASDAIR MACINTYRE be intelligent, and so must in turn be preceded by yet another act of deliberation. And so we must proceed. It follows that for any intelligent behaviour to occur an infinite series of intelligent acts of deliberation must first occur. But this is impossible. Hence it is concluded that it cannot be necessary for every piece of intelligent behaviour to be preceded by an act of deliberation. This argument, which is rightly considered fatal to the earlier view, might also be adduced against the view which I have tried to state. For I have suggested that the paradigm cases of intelligent behaviour are those in which the behaviour was preceded by deliberation. And this involves me in holding that there must be some actual cases of intelligent behaviour which are preceded by deliberation. It might appear that I am not committed to this. For all that I have so far argued is that to call a piece of behaviour intelligent we must consider what someone would have done who had deliberated before acting in the particular situation. Now this, it might be thought, could be taken into consideration even if nobody ever had deliberated before acting. For we could understand what it was to deliberate and what it was to act even although these had never been conjoined in our experi- ence. But this would be a mistake. For the relevance of asking what someone who deliberated would have done does not lie merely in the fact that intelligent behaviour is rule-governed, but in the fact that it is a true empirical generalisation that deliberation on what to do commonly promotes success in or acting relative to our purposes. If this generalisation were not true, then the advice " Stop and think! " which is so commonly and rightly offered to children would not be in place. We are misled here not only by the fact that there are some cases where deliberation does not help but also by the cases where deliberation is not a sufficient condition of practical success. But neither of these considerations entails that there need be no cases where deliberation precedes intelligent behaviour. All this involves me, as I suggested earlier, in holding that there must be some cases where intelligent behaviour is preceded by an act of deliberation. This might be thought</page><page sequence="9">PURPOSE AND INTELLIGENT ACTION 87 to subject my agreement to the difficulty presented by Ryle's regress. For it might be argued that in what I have presented as the paradigm cases of intelligent behaviour, the behaviour must be preceded by an act of deliberation. But this deliberation must itself also surely be intelligent, and since we are in the realm of paradigm cases, these acts must be intelligent and be preceded by yet further acts of deliberation. And so proceed ad infinitum. But this argument rests upon a mistake. For what my argument implies is only that for all pieces of intelligent behaviour we must be able to consider what someone who had deliberated would have done and that for some pieces of intelligent behaviour there must be actual precedent deliberation; and not that the acts of deliberation in these last cases must themselves be further preceded by other such acts, but only that we must be able to ask and answer the question about what someone who had deliberated would have done. Hence no infinite and a fortiori no vicious regress ensures. The first part of my argument is now concluded. All that I have aimed to do is to distinguish three related senses of 'intelligent' and to defend the necessary connexion between intelligence thus defined and deliberation. The only point that perhaps needs re-emphasis is that although one may predicate ' intelligent ' in the first two senses of agents incapable of delibera- tion we could not have the concept that we have unless we knew what deliberation could effect in such cases. And thus it follows that there has been genuine insight in the views both of those who have seen something uniquely human in intelligence and those who have extended the concept to animals and machines. For what the argument shows is that where agents incapable of deliberation are concerned we have extended a concept that begins from deliberation; but that no difficulty is involved in the extension. Men, animals and machines can all be called intelligent in the first sense; men and animals can both be called intelligent in the second sense; and men alone can be called intelligent in the third sense. The justification of these last assertions and their further implications will be discussed later on in the paper. But if the</page><page sequence="10">88 ALASDAIR MACINTYRE distinctions already made are to be employed on such speculative topics it would be wise first to show that they can be put to some use in connexion with the ordinary run of psychological discussions. The second part of the paper will therefore begin by enquiring why these distinctions have been insufficiently noticed by psychologists and what consequences might follow if they were attended to. II What follows is a highly schematic and general attempt to outline the attitude to intelligence developed by empirical psychologists. In trying to say what psychologists have in common and ignoring their points of disagreement I shall of course blur the picture. And when I proceed to criticise the psychological attitude the lines of development indicated will be ones already taken by some psychologists. This points to a growing sensitivity to conceptual points in contemporary psychology. But at the same time work upon intelligence by psychologists has grown out of an intellectual tradition in which the elucidation of the concept of intelligence has been tied very closely to the concept of intelligence testing. It would be a caricature of the situation to suggest that psychologists have first devised their tests and then defined intelligence as what was measured by such tests; but it would be a caricature of the real situation. Professor R. Knight, basing himself on Spearman's work, defined intelligence as " the capacity for relational, constructive thinking, directed to the attainment of some end ". (Intelligence and Intelligence Tests, p. 16.) This definition, whose force depends on the sense assigned to the key terms in it, brings out the central feature of the psychologists' view of intelligence as the capacity to carry through some specified task successfully. A large possibility of conceptual confusion is embedded in it. The first source of this is that by making the tasks in which intelligence is manifested such that success or failure in them can be tested publicly, attention is concentrated on behavioural criteria and drawn away from questions of purpose. The</page><page sequence="11">PURPOSE AND INTELLIGENT ACTION 89 behaviourist assumptions of so much empirical psychology strengthen the likelihood that purpose disappears from the conceptual scene. For one cannot discern whether someone has or has not been successful in achieving his purposes simply from observing his behaviour in a limited context. This is what I meant earlier when I asserted that the purpose is not necessarily written on the face of the performance. This elimination of any relationship to purpose from the concept of intelligence is aided by the ambiguity of the term " end ". For this may refer either to the purpose for which a routine was carried through or to the completion of the final stage of the routine. The purpose for which I solve a puzzle may be to win a prize, or admiration, or to reassure myself as to my skill or to allay boredom; the setting out of the solution is the same in each case. I may carry through to completion the same routine performance for a variety of different purposes; or I may carry through to completion a variety of routine performances for the same purpose. This distinction is com- pletely obliterated by quasi-behaviourist attempts to equate achieving a purpose with completing a routine. Consider, for example, Professor C. A. Mace's assertion that a causal sequence is teleological in character " whenever a sequence of events occurs which satisfies certain conditions, viz.: (i) that for the sequence in question there is a possible state of affairs, E, such that its introduction at any stage terminates the process; (2) that phases which promote E are repeated and continued whilst those that are adverse to E are discontinued; (3) that with repetition the process approximates to a form in which every phase is relevant to the promotion of E." (" Mechanism and Teleological Causation" in Readings in PhilosophicalAnalysis, ed. Feigl &amp; Sellars, p. 538.) Is E the state of affairs in which a routine is completed or a purpose achieved ? The word " teleo- logical" is an effective instrument for obliterating important distinctions here. If we obliterate such distinctions we cannot distinguish intelligence in my first sense from intelligence in my second sense. Moreover, by concentrating attention upon the performance of limited tasks intelligence is made to consist in an ability to fabricate means for a given end. This suggests</page><page sequence="12">90 ALASDAIR MACINTYRE that intelligence cannot be ascribed where choices of end are concerned. Just as behaviourism reinforced the first possibility of confusion, so that philosophical tradition which counterposes reason and the passions is at hand to butress this one. Hume and the Utilitarians are both ancestors of those who see intelli- gence as limited to the assessment of rival methods of attain- ment of goals and irrelevant to the choice between rival goals. Here the ambiguity of " end " is also at work. For just as this word can refer both to the completion of a routine and to the purpose for which the routine was carried through, so it can also be ambiguous as between the purposes a man has and the satisfaction which he aspires to gain from achieving them. And this latter ambiguity effectively obscures the distinction between my second and third senses of " intelligence". Thus, to consider intelligence in terms of the performance of certain limited tasks and to grade as intelligent the man who achieves the "ends" set to him by these tasks is at least to risk conceptual confusion. But how much does this matter? Provided the psychologist is clear and consistent in his usage, is it not open to him to use "intelligence" as he likes? This rejoinder ignores the point of the psychologist's enterprise. For the psychologist claims to be able to provide us with predictive techniques for assessing intelligence in our sense of the word, or at least in a sense akin to our sense. It is open to the psycho- logist to invent any technical terms that he can find a need for; there is no a priori reason for giving fewer rights to " G" than to "meson" or to " chromosome ". But like " meson" and " chromosome" in the end " G " has to be made intelligible in terms which start from the non-technical. If therefore the psychologist conceives of intelligence in terms of the performance of specifiable, limited tasks, and reference to purpose and satisfaction is eliminated as it is in most classical systems of testing, then it might be thought that what is being tested is intelligence in our first, and not in our second and third senses. But this would be a mistake. Consider the following argument which in the light of my earlier conceptual analysis might be launched against the whole project of intelligence testing.</page><page sequence="13">PURPOSE AND INTELLIGENT ACTION 91 It might be argued that if the subject does well in the test, nevertheless he may never find in the world outside the test- situation purposes to which he can match the skills exhibited in the test. This would be either through inept choice of purposes (unintelligent in the third sense) or through inability to match skill to purpose (unintelligent in the second sense). If on the other hand the subject does badly it might be because he found in the test-situation no purpose which he wanted to achieve and thought it worth while to manifest his skill in order to achieve. So that in either case the predictive value of the test would be low. (" Purpose" here can include " unconscious purpose " in either a non-technical or a Freudian sense.) This argument is flawed by its apriorism. Clearly if subjects who do well in tests do tend to do well afterwards in other situations then it is clear that those who find a purpose in the test-situation towards the achievement of which they are pre- pared to use their skills also find such purposes in the world outside. But tests are predictively successful in this way. And this shows that it is not just intelligence in the first sense, but also intelligence in the second sense that is tested; indeed, what we have shown is that intelligence in the first sense cannot be tested unless intelligence in the second sense is also tested. Something, however, stands in the argument. If the subject is graded highly in the test we can have some expectation of future success; it does not follow however that if the subject does badly we can expect future failure with the same degree of confidence. For the subject may find purposes worthy of manifestation of skill outside the test-situation which he is unable to discover inside it. And this remains a possibility no matter how long the run of failure to manifest certain abilities. That it does so is something of which only conceptual analysis can remind us. Psychologists have recently paid more and more attention to this possibility. Another worth while field for attention here is that of the extent to which in the presentation of results of intelligence testing what are in fact conceptual points may be presented as</page><page sequence="14">92 ALASDAIR MACINTYRE empirical discoveries. Cattell and Eysenck both report as a discovery that those of higher intelligence tend to have more balanced personalities. But if the intelligence tested is intelli- gence in the second sense, and we have seen that it is, and if to have a balanced personality is in part at least to have found purposes to which to harness one's skills, and I think that this is implied in Cattell's and Eysenck's use of this and kindred terms, then that to be intelligent is to have a balanced personality is in part at least a conceptual not an empirical discovery. Nonetheless all these points concern an enterprise which by now has secure empirical foundations and it might be thought that at best conceptual analysis could aid only in the negative task of avoiding confusion in the interpretation of the results. Much more is at stake however than this. For the psychologist is concerned not merely to measure but also to understand intelligence. Now whereas we have seen that intelligence testing in fact concerns itself with intelligence in our second sense, the failure to distinguish between the completion of a routine and the purpose for which the routine was undertaken may lead the psychologist to suppose that it is intelligence in the first sense only which is tested. And this may lead to an attempt to explain intelligence mechanically, a project which is appro- priate to intelligence in the first but not in the second sense. This misconception could lead to serious theoretical incoherence and sterility and it can only be cleared up by returning to the assertion that intelligence can be predicated of machines, animals and men in the first sense, of animals and men in the second sense, and of men alone in the third sense. The last of these three assertions affords no difficulty. For it was clear that a necessary condition of being intelligent in the third sense was to be a language-user. Now it is of the essence of being a language-user that not only can one frame forms of words but that one can use the same form of words for a variety of purposes. The proponents of the thesis that automata might exhibit the intelligence of the language-user are apt to concentrate on cases where the machine, as they would put it, 'says' that such-and-such is the case, when such-and-</page><page sequence="15">PURPOSE AND INTELLIGENT ACTION 93 such is in fact the case. But what of the occasion where the machine 'says' that such-and-such is the case, when this is false. What criteria could be used to distinguish a mistake from a lie and both from a joke? In what situation could we con- ceivably say, "Take no notice, Pegasus is only pulling your leg "? To ask these questions is to answer them or at least is to go far enough towards answering them to make it clear that machines are excluded from intelligence in the third sense because they lack purposes, and cannot therefore be language-users. Animals are excluded from intelligence in the third sense because, although they do not lack purposes, they lack language in the sense of a system of signs adequate for deliberation. So far as intelligence in the second sense is concerned machines are excluded, again on the grounds that they lack purposes. But animals are no longer excluded, because to them purposes can be ascribed. We can make precisely the same distinction between the completion of a routine and the achieve- ment of a purpose in the case of animals which we make in the case of men. A herring gull may go through the routine of showing fight either to warn off intruders or as part of courtship. An ape may use a stick to play with a ball or to bring a banana within reach. This distinction cannot be made in the case of machines. Here no criteria can be given for distinguishing between the end state of the machine which would mark the completion of a routine and that which would mark the achieve- ment of a purpose. What would it be for a machine to carry through a routine to a successful completion and find that it had failed to achieve its purpose? Thus in both the second and third senses of "intelligent" machines cannot be called intelligent because machines cannot have purposes. That they cannot is perhaps clearer than why they cannot. To make this clear the concept of a purpose must be elucidated further. When we ask " What was his purpose in doing that ?" of a man, how do we expect to find an answer? We may either ask the agent or we may look to the context of his action, Sometimes one of these courses will afford either no answer or a false or misleading one. The agent's purposes may</page><page sequence="16">94 ALASDAIR MACINTYRE be so devious that only his own avowal will betray what that purpose is. Or his purposes may be so transparent that his denials and even his honest denials will carry no weight with us. An example of the former is the man who practises syste- matic conscious deception on others. An example of the latter is the man who is self-deceived, so that he does not recognize the ambition, jealousy or love in terms of which alone his actions are intelligible. Thus when we speak of an agent's purposes there are two different sets of criteria. A man can only be said to act for a certain purpose, if there are some circumstances in which he will or can be brought to avow it. A man whose honest avowals do not cohere sufficiently with his actual conduct (such as the man who continually frequents the company of some young woman, gives her presents and so on, but denies and denies to the point where deception is out of the question that he is in love with her or even very much interested in her) ceases to be eligible for recognition as a rational agent. He does not know what he is doing in too profound a sense. The class of those eligible for recognition as rational agents has of course shifting boundaries. Freud taught us new techniques for bringing the self-deceived and the self-ignorant to a point where they could recognize and avow their purposes. To have said this about avowals is to have brought out the point that the agent's avowal of a purpose cannot be the sole criterion of his having a particular purpose. There are also certain socially recognized criteria; if these are not conformed to, an agent's avowals of purpose will simply not be listened to; and if they are adequately conformed to, no amount of disavowal on the agent's part will be listened to. At the one extreme is the case of the man who commits some appalling crime of mass-murder and when asked why he did it says " To see if my gun worked ". At the other extreme is the case of the man who, not having been drugged or hypnotised, approaches a young woman and utters the form of words " Will you marry me? " No amount of disavowal of intention to propose will save him in the subsequent breach of promise action. Thus we can only identify the purposes of those agents whose</page><page sequence="17">PURPOSE AND INTELLIGENT ACTION 95 actions fall recognizably within the classificatory schemes which our social conventions afford us. Since it makes no sense to speak of purposes, unless specific, identifiable purposes are in point, to speak of a purpose outside a rule-governed form of social life either does not make sense or only makes sense because we can extent our concepts analogically. This we are in fact able to do in the case of animals. Animals have biological needs more or less similar to our own and live in groupings more or less similar to the groupings of human society. When I spoke of the purposes of herring gulls and apes and I had to use such words as "courtship " and "play ". If I could not have done this, I could not have spoken of purposes. But to recognize someone as using a technique or skill to serve his purpose of courtship or play is in the first instance only possible in human society where actions are conventionally classed under and made intel- ligible with reference to those headings. My refusal to acknowledge that machines can be intelligent in anything other than my first sense does not therefore rest upon either of two lines of argument which have often been adduced. It is not that machines are excluded because they are artefacts; if biochemists can learn to progress in the manufacture of living matter, who knows which of the pages of contemporary science fiction may not all too literally come alive? Nor is it that machines are excluded simply because they are not equipped with language. It is rather that their lack of language is a consequence of the fact that it makes no sense to ascribe purposes to them. Of course, in order for purposes to be ascribed to an agent in the fullest sense the agent must be a language-user. But we can extend ascriptions of purpose to animals, in a way that we cannot extend them to machines, because animals have recognizable forms of social life and machines have not. The point of this latter part of the argument in my paper is this. If it makes no sense to ascribe purposes to machines, then explanations of purpose in the behaviour of either humans or animals which refer only to causal mechanisms are necessarily inadequate. This has an important moral for psychology. Psychology is a border-line subject. It hovers between the</page><page sequence="18">96 ALASDAIR MACINTYRE mechanisms of the neuro-physiologists and the r6les, functions and ideal types of the sociologist. A topic such as that of intelligent action will only be fully dealt with by an account which links these up. The approach to intelligence from the standpoint of intelligence-testing is just the type of approach liable to insulate and restrict the psychological discussion. What I hope is that the conceptual analysis which I have offered will suggest psychological treatments of the topic of a more adequate kind.</page><page sequence="19">II-P. H. NOWELL-SMITII IT is the duty of the second symposiast to comment on the contribution of the first, a duty not always congenial and not always performed. But Mr. MacIntyre's paper, because rather than in spite of its limitation in scope, makes the task more pleasant than usual. I have three criticisms to make of his main thesis, and I shall then follow him in discussing the relevance of these issues to psychological theory and practice. MacIntyre gives us three senses of 'intelligence', built up as follows: I1 the ability to carry through a routine successfully, 12 the ability to make use of routines in a manner designed to achieve whatever the agent has in mind, and 13 the ability to choose purposes wisely. Each sense brings in a new concept, first routine, second purpose, third reflective choice or delibera- tion; but the scheme is so built up that the concept of routine remains basic to each sense. (i) This scheme lays too much emphasis on attainment, on the ability to carry through a routine, and says nothing about ability to learn.' Yet surely, if any one thing is of the essence of intelligence, if any one thing distinguishes the bright boy from the dunce, it is the ability of the former to pick things up quickly. The ability to learn can, of course, only be tested by testing attainments, performances, what has been learnt; but tests of attainment can be, though they need not be, also tests of ability to learn, and it is only when they are that they can be properly called intelligence tests. It is not only MacIntyre who forgets about learning; psychologists write books about intelligence and books about learning, but seldom mention learning in their books about intelligence; so it looks as if I must be wrong; but I shall stick to my guns and try to explain this anomaly later. 1 Strictly, MacIntyre characterises 11 as ability to learn to carry through a routine performance correctly. But he immediately drops 'learning' and carries on as if he had written ' ability to carry through '. G</page><page sequence="20">98 P. H. NOWELL-SMITH (ii) My second criticism is of the idea that intelligence is the ability to carry through routines. MacIntyre anticipates the objection that we normally contrast intelligent behaviour with routine behaviour; but I do not think he answers it satisfactorily. On this head he says (a) that we are prepared to predicate intelligence of anything which can carry through sufficiently complicated routines or a sufficient variety of routines and (b) that routines are rule-governed processes for which recipes can be given. I shall try to counter these defences in the course of a frontal assault on the conception that routine behaviour can ever be intelligent. (iii) MacIntrye introduces the notion of purpose only at stage 2; I hold that there is no standard sense of' intelligence' which does not bring in the concept of intention, aim, end or purpose. There is considerable variation in the use of these words; so I propose to legislate arbitrarily. By 'intention' I shall mean what is described by a man who gives an honest answer to the question' What are you doing ? ', by' purpose ' what is described when he gives an honest answer to the question 'Why are you doing it?'; and I shall use 'end' and 'aim' to include both intentions and purposes. The distinction between intention and purpose is relative. Thus the adult in MacIntyre's story might, in answer to the question 'What are you doing?', have replied either 'I am playing chess with John' or 'I am amusing John'; but whenever two such answers are so related that we could say that he is doing a for the sake of doing b or in order to do or achieve b, I shall limit intention to a and purpose to b. My thesis is that intelligence can be shown in behaviour which lacks purpose in this sense, since it can be shown in things that we do for their own sake, but that it cannot be shown in behaviour which lacks intention. Neither intention nor purpose needs to be in mind before the action is done. A man who grabs at a child to stop him falling over a cliff does not form the intention of grabbing; he just grabs; but his action is both intentional and purposive, since he could properly say 'I grabbed the child to stop him falling over the cliff'. Reflex actions cannot be intentional or purposive, however successfully they bring about some state of affairs which the agent wishes to bring about,</page><page sequence="21">PURPOSE AND INTELLIGENT ACTION 99 but an immediate reaction to a situation, even though clumsy and ineffective, can be.2 I am not arguing against MacIntyre's distinction between II and 12. We can certainly say that a man is being intelligent (in playing chess well) and also unintelligent (in trying to win against a sick child). My point is rather that in describing Il in terms of carrying through routine performances, MacIntyre has misdescribed it; to show intelligence a man (or animal) must intend to do something. This is really implicit in some of the things that he says about routines; so it may look as if I am quarrelling only with his use of the word 'routine'. In a way this is so; but the point is not a trivial one. For, as MacIntyre says, some psychologists have a tendency to be over-mechanical in their accounts of intelligence, and the use of the word 'routine' to describe behaviour that is, in some sense, intelligent, is a powerful temptation to be so. The hall-marks of routine performances, according to MacIntyre, are that recipes can be given for carrying them through and that they pass from beginnings to ends by rule- governed methods. If 'giving a recipe' here means only that we can describe the beginning and the end of the process and enumerate its steps, this is a true account of a routine, but rather trivial. A routine will be anything which has a fixed beginning, passes through fixed steps in a fixed order and has a fixed outcome, and this admirably describes the operation of a machine. But the trouble is that the word 'recipe' here does no work; as soon as we put it to its normal work, the idea of intention comes in. For a recipe is not just a description of a process; it is an instruction for doing or making something. We can have recipes for cooking eggs, making boxes and other operations which can always be done in the same way, and no doubt one can learn to go through the steps in a purely routine way; but 2 I deliberately exclude unconscious intentions, purposes and aims, not because they are unimportant or because I disagree with what MacIntyre says about them at the end of his paper. I exclude them because I do not think that a man would be called intelligent in respect of his unconscious aims, however well-adapted his behaviour was to achieving them. We could of course give a use to ' intelligent ' here. G2</page><page sequence="22">100 P. H. NOWELL-SMITH to speak of a recipe for any of these operations is to imply that someone is interested in the outcome, even if this is only the performance itself. Instructions for executing a dance would not normally be called a recipe, but this would not be too violent an extension of the word; but to say that water flowing in a fixed channel is following a recipe is altogether too violent. The same point can be made in connexion with the word 'rule-governed'. To say that the flow of water is rule-governed is to be anthropomorphic or theological; for the kind of rule that MacIntyre has in mind is not just an actual restriction like the banks of a stream, but a rule that is to be followed and could be contravened. In the primary sense, to have a purpose or intention is to purpose or intend to do something, but there is a secondary sense in which a thing can have a purpose or intention in the sense of being used or intended for a purpose. If we allow the secondary sense, we can say that the movements of the parts of a watch are rule-governed, also in a secondary sense, since they conform or fail to conform to the rules laid down by the watch-maker; but they are not rule-governed in the primary sense. Can machines be intelligent? MacIntyre sees that it is a consequence of his theory that machines and animals can have II. I hold that machines can in no sense be intelligent and that, though intelligence can be predicated of animals, it is not II as MacIntyre defines it that is predicated of them. Left to himself, the plain man has no tendency to predicate intelligence of machines except as a joke. The tendency comes from theoreticians who have philosophical or scientific axes to grind. Philosophically they may wish to underplay the distinction between animate and inanimate or that between human and non-human, and scientifically they may wish to explore those analogies of structure and performance which undoubtedly do exist between the human brain and some machines. With this aim I am not out of sympathy; the names 'adding machine' and ' electronic brain' have point ; but the first of these tempts us into the following fallacious reasoning: "Adding machines can add; adding is a kind of thinking; so adding machines can think. Thinking is an exercise of intelligence; so adding machines can exercise intelligence." We then hedge by calling</page><page sequence="23">PURPOSE AND INTELLIGENT ACTION 101 this just one sense of 'intelligence'. But if we put in the quantifiers which English so frequently and deplorably omits, the fallacy becomes obvious. Thinking includes both intelligent and routine performances; hence the kind of thinking that adding machines might, with a stretch, be said to do need not be an exercise of intelligence. MacIntyre may have been misled here by his tendency to omit learning. A person who can add must have some degree of intelligence, since he must have learned to add; but a machine does not learn to add, so that, if I am right about learning, its ability to add is not a proof of intelligence. Machines can take over some of the jobs that were formerly done only by intelligent beings, and they may do them more efficiently; but this does not entitle them to be called intelligent. There is no more reason to say that a machine thinks for us on the score that it takes over a part of our thinking than to say that a car walks for us because it takes off our legs the job of getting us about. Machines also lack intelligence on the grounds that they lack purposes in the primary sense; it makes no sense to say that a machine wants or intends or is trying to do something. They do not lack purposes in the secondary sense; indeed they are typically things which are made and used for a purpose; but successful performance in a machine consists in its doing what its designer or user intends it to do, not in doing what it intends to do. Like MacIntyre, I should not debar machines from intelligence on the grounds that they are artefacts; but I should not, as he does, admit something made by a bio-chemist while excluding something made by an engineer. If an artefact could learn and could intend, it could be either intelligent or stupid, no matter what it was made of or by whom it was made; but it would not be a machine if it passed these tests. Can animals be intelligent? We certainly do predicate intelligence of some animals though, since we might always be mistaken, it does not follow that any animal is intelligent. The philosophical questions here are 'What are we saying of an animal when we call it intelligent ? ', 'What observed character- istics of animals make it plausible to ascribe intelligence to them ? ' That we do not mean to say that the animal is capable of carrying through a complicated routine or a great variety of routines</page><page sequence="24">102 P. H. NOWELL-SMITH follows from the facts that it is not typically to animals which can do these things that we ascribe intelligence and that, when we do ascribe it, it is not in respect of such performances. MacIntyre's two examples (the herring gull and the ape) are significantly different from each other. What he calls " routines of showing fight or to warn off intruders or as part of courtship " really are routines, but it is doubtful whether we can attribute either intention or intelligence to such performances. It is true that they do in fact tend to produce certain results (victory, dominion or mating) which are prominent also among the ends pursued by intelligent beings, so that there is a natural tendency to say that the animal intends the results, that it is trying to warn off intruders or to captivate a mate. If we do say this, we must then go on to say that an animal who does these things in a manner likely to succeed is showing intelligence; for his behaviour is well-adapted to his purpose. But simple success does not, alone, constitute good adaptation of behaviour to purpose, since a well-made lawn-mower or chronometer also (necessarily) succeeds. To predicate intelligence we should need to believe that the animal intended the actual outcome and, in the case of routine behaviour, it is difficult to see what the evidence for this could be. The difficulty lies in the fact that the behaviour, however complicated, is routine, so that it would always be open to us to say that it was simply a mechanism triggered off by a situation. The animals sometimes mis-called 'social', such as bees, termites and ants, ought, on MacIntyre's criterion, to be regarded as the most intelligent; but they are not. Intelligence is typically ascribed to the primates, to dogs, horses, elephants-in short to the animals usually found in circuses. It is not the complication or the variety of routines of which they are capable which makes these animals intelligent; rather is it the fact that they can be trained and that what they can be trained to do can, in at least some cases, hardly be called a mere routine. A dog can be taught to respond correctly to a wide range of stimuli that have nothing in common except that they fall under some general concept, which shows that the dog is, in some sense, able to grasp the concept. For example, if it has been trained to go through a hoop that is always presented to it in the same position</page><page sequence="25">PURPOSE AND INTELLIGENT ACTION 103 it will try to go through it when it is placed in a different position; its behaviour in novel situations is flexible while the outcome remains the same; and it is this that leads us to say (whether rightly or wrongly) that the dog has got the idea that it is supposed to go through the hoop and intends to do this. Ants and bees do not solve problems; but the evidence strongly suggests that apes do, and not, as Watson thought, through the chance success of random movements; and if they can be said to solve problems they can be said to be intelligent.3 Routines and Flexibility. MacIntyre lists deduction, chess, cross-words, cooking and shipbuilding as typical examples of routine performances. Of these the last two could certainly become routines. A chef may become so expert at making omelettes that he never makes an unnecessary move and always makes the same moves in the same order, and there is no reason why automation could not be applied to shipbuilding. The case of cross-words is doubtful and interesting, but I shall not discuss it; instead I propose to say quite a lot about chess because it provides an excellent example of the difference between routine and intelligent behaviour. (a) Openings can be routines. Two players might agree to play the Ruy Lopez and instead of setting up the board as it appears after White's fifth move they might set it up in the normal way and play through the first nine moves. They would then be going through a routine. It is an important feature of this case that an onlooker could learn to make these nine moves without knowing either the rules of chess or what constitutes winning. (b) Some end-games can be routines. Place both kings and one white pawn anywhere on the board and a good player will tell you either that White can win or that Black can draw. This 'can' has nothing to do with the skill of the players; for there is either a specifiable set of moves such that White will win whatever Black does or a specifiable set such that Black 3 See Kohler: The Mentality of Apes and, for some of the philosophical implications of Kohler's evidence, Holloway: Language and Intelligence, Chapter 4.</page><page sequence="26">104 P. H. NOWELL-SMITH will draw whatever White does. We might put this point by saying that one can know, in the 'philosophical' sense, what the outcome will be, as one cannot know the outcome of any opening or any typical middle-game position. There is no scope for originality, brilliance or even intelligence on either side. In practice Black would either resign or claim a draw; in the latter case the draw would not have to be adjudged and in the former it would be inept to say "You shouldn't have resigned; your position was not all that hopeless "; for, if the position is hopeless, it is known to be so. White can fail to win if he makes a mistake in the sense of' slip ', but not in the sense of 'error of judgment'; for there is no scope for the exercise of judgment at all. As with all routines of any complexity, the player must exercise care and attention; but he cannot exercise judgment or intelligence. It might be argued that these cases are not pure routines because there is scope for choice, which is absent from case (a). But though there is scope for choice, the moves could still be learnt as a routine in the form ' If White . . . . K to K3, Black . . . . K to K4'. From some positions the formula would be enormously long, but, however, long it is, the case is quite different from that of the first move in the game of which (though we can say that some moves are good and others bad) we cannot say what the outcome of any move must be. So here too it is logically possible for all the moves to be learnt as a routine by someone who knew neither the rules nor the object of the game. (c) My purpose in showing the routine character of openings and some end-games is to bring out by contrast the fact that the middle game cannot be reduced to a set of routines. (Notice that one says 'openings' and 'end-games' but 'the middle game ', not 'middle games '.) There are general maxims of strategy, but you cannot pass from any of these maxims to an unambiguous answer to the question 'What move should I make now?' You must know when and how to apply the maxims. A certain move may be a good application of the maxim ' Get control of the centre', but fatal in your position; or this maxim may be the right one to apply in your position, but the move you make ill-adapted to getting control of the</page><page sequence="27">PURPOSE AND INTELLIGENT ACTION 105 centre. Playing the middle game well is a matter of becoming proficient in the selection and application of maxims, seeing and seizing opportunities, making combinations, spotting your opponent's weaknesses; it is not a matter of learning routines, of acquiring fluency and facility in going through a series of set moves. By contrast with the routine situations, it would not be possible for anyone to learn how to play the middle game without knowing both the rules and the object of the game. You must know the rules, since they limit the choice of permissible moves, and without knowing the object you would not be able to distinguish a good move from a bad one, and hence not be able to make an intelligent choice. It might be argued that the intelligence required for playing the middle game is really 12, the ability to select a routine well- adapted to achieve a wider purpose. But this would require us to call the actual making of moves routine performances, which we cannot do. Routine character (as MacIntyre says of purpose) is not written on the face of performances. We can say that Q to B5 is a routine move in this position, but not that it is itself a routine move; and in the middle game there are no routine moves in any typical position. To conclude this part of my paper, we can speak of intelligence and stupidity only where we can speak of exercising judgment, of good or bad choices, right or wrong solutions, and all of these entail the concept of intentional action. The connexion between intelligence and learning is, by contrast, not logically necessary; Pallas Athene might spring fully-armed from the head of Zeus; but since in fact she does not, since the intelligence displayed in performance by the paradigm case of an intelligent being (homo sapiens) is in fact always learned, the idea of ability to learn is in fact deeply embedded in the concept of intelligence. II Do psychologists forget about learning? I come now to the bearing of these remarks on the theory and practice of psychology. The reference to learning is important since it has a bearing on the question 'What is tested by intelligence tests?' Vernon also gives us three senses of 'intelligence ': IA " the underlying</page><page sequence="28">106 P. H. NOWELL-SMITH inborn potentiality, that is some quality of the central nervous system, determined ultimately by the genes ", IB " the all-round ability or mental efficiency that children or adults actually display in everyday life at school or at work ", and IC, the Intelligence Quotient as technically defined.4 IC is what is directly tested; but the important question is 'Of what is it a measure? With what non-technical sense of " intelligence " is it roughly correlated ? ' Here there seems to be not only disagreement among psychologists but also confusion due to the complexity of their definitions of 'intelligence' in the non-technical sense. On some views the I.Q. is a measure of inborn intelligence, as opposed to acquired knowledge; and this is the view commonly taken by the layman. Vernon emphatically denies it. We have, he says, no means of testing inborn intelligence (IA); " this quality is purely hypothetical; it is a legitimate hypothesis, but we have not at present any means of observing it and have little prospect of ever being able to do so." If IA is really a quality of the central nervous system, this seems too despondent. I shall try to show later that Vernon's despair is due to a confusion about what it would be to be able to assess IA and to a very proper, but only half-formed doubt as to the propriety of calling any quality of the nervous system 'intelligence' at all. Vernon goes on to say that it is IB that has an empirically tested high correlation with IC (which is what makes intelligence tests useful in practice) and that IB is not inborn, but acquired. On the last point he is certainly right. Whatever inborn capacities human beings may have, their actual performance at school or at work depends on such traffic with the world as they have had. Unless the capacity to learn a language, which is inborn in almost all human beings, is developed at a suitable stage (roughly before the age of six) by contact with language- users, it cannot be developed at all and the child will not rise above the animal level of intelligence. There is no reason to believe that those children who have failed to develop the power of language through lack of contact all happened to be congenital morons; it is far more probable that their power 4 In Studies in Education, No. 7, pp. 189-215. University of London, Institute of Education, 1955.</page><page sequence="29">PURPOSE AND INTELLIGENT ACTION 107 to learn became atrophied because it was not developed at the right age. But this inborn capacity is not the capacity to use a language; it is the capacity to learn one; and once this is grasped the conflict between Vernon's view and the view that IC may be a measure of something innate is seen to be less acute. IC cannot be a measure of inborn efficiency, since there is no such thing, all efficiency being acquired. But it may well be a measure of inborn intelligence, in the sense of capacity to learn. It is because Vernon, like MacIntyre, thinks of intelligence in terms of efficiency of performance rather than in terms of capacity to learn that he rejects the idea that an J.Q. test might measure something innate. Whatever psychologists may say in their introductory remarks and in their attempts to define 'intelligence ', the concept of I.Q., as they actually use it, supports the view that it is supposed to measure something innate. The test score gives the child's 'mental age', i.e., the chronological age at which that score could be expected of an average child. His I.Q. is his mental age divided by his chronological age and multiplied by 100 to eliminate fractions. Thus if a child of 10 does as well as an average child of 12, his I.Q. is said to be 120. Suppose that John, Tom, Dick and Harry all get the same score; if there is, as in fact there is, a high correlation between the test score and their actual all-round efficiency, we should expect their all-round efficiencies to be about the same. But suppose we now learn that, at the time of taking the test, John was ten and the others twelve, John's I.Q. is higher than theirs, so that, in spite of what Vernon says, I.Q. is not directly correlated with actual all-round ability, IB, though it is, of course, a function of it. What, we might ask, is the point of multiplying the test score by mental age over chronological age? The answer is obvious; what we are trying to get the measure of is not the child's present efficiency of performance, but his capacity to learn. John differs from the other three in that he has reached the same level of performance in a shorter time. Now this difference too may be (and doubtless is) in part due to environ- mental factors such as parental attitudes, emotional disturbances and the like; but if the test is to be a test of intelligence at all, it must be possible to find ways of eliminating these factors, and</page><page sequence="30">108 P. H. NOWELL-SMITH there is no reason to suppose that John's higher I.Q. is not partly innate. There are other considerations which support this view. (i) I.Q. tests are widely used as selection criteria for different types of schooling; and clearly what we want to know, especially about young children, is not just the extent of their accomplish- ments, but the educability which these accomplishments show. (ii) Psychologists aim at making their tests 'culture-free', which in itself shows that they are aiming to test something innate, not in the sense of some capacity to perform which would be present in the absence of all cultural surroundings, but in the sense of something to which differences of culture are indifferent. Most of the work here has been done on attempts to construct tests suitable for children from very different societies, for example Europeans and Arabs. But (iii) some of the principles on which tests are constructed, though not thought of in terms of culture- freedom, are obviously designed to eliminate differences of home background as much as possible. Thus the vocabulary employed in most tests is limited to words that it could be reasonably supposed that every child of a certain age who speaks the language must have come across. Children are asked 'What is to blood as white is to snow?', not 'What is to the rose, Ena Harkness, as white is to snow?' The question is supposed to test their ability to spot relations, not the extent of their vocabulary or the range of their knowledge. (There are also vocabulary tests; but these, as well as testing the range of the child's vocabulary, are also tests of intelligence in that they show that he has acquired this vocabulary in a greater or less time.) In the light of these facts, it would seem that the reason for the surprising fact that the word ' learning' is hardly to be found in the index of any book on intelligence must lie in the fact that books about intelligence are really books about the capacity to learn through and through. But because this is not explicitly recognized, there is considerable confusion of aim. Implicitly, if I am right, at least some of the tests are designed to test capacity to learn, but since they are explicitly thought of as tests of efficiency of performance, their construction does not take sufficient account of the difference between capacity to learn and actual possession of knowledge. Vernon says of mental tests</page><page sequence="31">PURPOSE AND INTELLIGENT ACTION 109 that " they are looked on as the clever psychologist's magic for finding out things that could not be revealed in any other way. This is quite wrong. Tests are nothing more, nor less, than well-chosen samples of people's thinking and behaviour. If intelligence testers could collect a sufficiently broad sample of everything that the layman recognizes as intelligence, then IC would be identical with IB." This is right as far as it goes; IB and IC are both capacities to do things, and only such capacities can be directly demonstrated. But it does not follow that both IB and IC may not depend on the capacity to learn to do things (indeed there would be no point in bringing age into the scheme at all if they did not) and hence that IC may not be a measure of some inborn capacity. If there is such a capacity, it cannot be identified with Vernon's IA; for it is not a quality of the nervous system. Vernon's idea that we have no means of assessing inborn intelligence because we have at present no means of observing, it, with its implication that if we ever were able to observe it we should then and then only be able to assess it, rests on a confusion between a capacity and the physical characteristics that a thing must (contingently) have if it has the capacity. A capacity is not the sort of thing that ever could be directly observed; but it can be assessed, and that without observing anything except performances. Doubtless my car would not have the capacity to do 50 m.p.h. unless it had an engine; but the connexion between engine and capacity is contingent. What is meant by 'capacity to do 50 m.p.h.' is simply that the car can do 50 m.p.h. and this capacity is tested by observing its performance, not by looking under the bonnet. In the same way, capacity to learn could be tested by people who had never heard of the central nervous system. Differences in capacity to learn may be connected with differences in the structure of the nervous system and these in turn may be genetically determined; these are matters for empirical investigation; but the testing of capacity to learn need not wait upon physiological discoveries. Do psychologists forget about purpose? MacIntyre says of Knight's definition of intelligence that it " brings out the central feature of the psychologists' view of intelligence as the capacity</page><page sequence="32">110 P. H. NOWELL-SMITH to carry through some specified task successfully ", and he sees here a large possibility for confusion. This is, I think, unfair to Knight, who actually says that intelligence "is the ability, when we have some aim or question in mind, to . . ." and defines it as " the capacity for relational, constructive thinking, directed to the attainment of some end ". Thus he does not, as MacIntyre suggests, define it in terms of carrying out some task set by the examiners, but in terms of the agent's own goals. It is true, of course, that answers to the test questions will be judged right or wrong according to their conformity to the answers which the examiner has in mind, and psychologists may sometimes omit to notice that the child has spotted some recondite and unintended relation or forget that he may do badly on purpose because he does not want to go to the grammar school. MacIntyre is certainly right in saying that a high I.Q. is a better guide to future success than a low one to future failure, if only because a low score can be faked while a high one cannot; but it is an exaggeration to say that Knight "eliminates any relation to purpose from the concept of intelligence ". The confusion between 'end' (intended goal) and 'end' (actual outcome) can certainly be made; notoriously it is made in the Argument from Design; but I see no reason for attributing it to Knight. It is true that what is tested is a performance- the papers could be marked by a machine-and that the purpose of a performance is not written on its face. But this only involves a confusion between purpose and outcome if we take 'purpose' to mean, what MacIntyre means by it, namely the ulterior purpose for which the performance is done. A child may try to do as well as he can for a great variety of reasons, and we cannot tell from his performance what his purpose was; but his II (in my sense) can be tested, since we are entitled to assume that if he got a large number of answers right he intended to do so. Getting full marks in an I.Q. test, like solving a cross-word, for whatever ulterior reason the task is undertaken, implies not only an outcome-certain words written in certain places-but a correct outcome, and this implies a grasp on the part of the examinee of what he is supposed to do, an intention to do it and the ability to succeed. The fact that psychologists may sometimes neglect the purposes for which examinees try to</page><page sequence="33">PURPOSE AND INTELLIGENT ACTION 111 succeed, though worth pointing out, is not sufficient to support an accusation of confusion. Utilitarianism. McIntyre's criticism of Hume and the Utilitarians for not allowing that intelligence can be shown in the choice of ends raises issues too large to be discussed at the end of a paper. I shall only comment briefly. (i) Hume, in a passage which I take to be archetypal of what MacIntyre has in mind, says that reason can only influence action in two ways, either by the discovery of' proper objects ' of an existing passion or by the discovery of suitable means. This is certainly too narrow if we insist on an accurate use of 'means' and 'ends'. For example, choosing a particular way of implementing a general policy is not choosing a means to an end; it can certainly be done intelligently or stupidly; but Hume could allow for this and other cases without any radical admission. He does not even need to say that an ultimate end, something chosen for its own sake alone, cannot be intelligently chosen; for all he must insist on is that reason alone cannot determine choice. (ii) MacIntyre marks 13 off from 12 in two ways. It implies a capacity for reflective choice, deliberation; but since 12 may also, though it need not, involve this, it will not serve to mark off 13. The crucial criterion is that the object chosen is not chosen for any ulterior purpose, the criterion of successful choice being the contribution which the chosen object makes to the satisfactory character of the man's life as a whole. MacIntyre is right in distinguishing the object-satisfaction relation from the means-end relation and right also in saying that intelligence and stupidity can be shown in choosing ultimate ends. But I doubt whether this introduces us to a new sense of 'intelligence '. In so far as intellectual abilities enter into such things as choosing a wife or a career-and I don't wish to deny that they do-they are surely the same abilities that are covered by 12: being good at seeing possibilities and assessing evidence, knowing one's own character and limitations, and so on. These general abilities are involved wherever reflective choice is involved, not only in large-scale choices or choices of ultimate ends. (iii) Since intentional action is wider than reflective choice,</page><page sequence="34">112 P. H. NOWELL-SMITH there is point in saying that a being capable of the latter can be intelligent or stupid in ways not open to a being capable only of the former. But how much turns on this? Hume's withers are not wrung; but it is certainly possible that psychologists may fail to test the important intellectual abilities that belong to reflective choice. The simple types of test based on synonymy, opposites, analogies, etc., cannot test excellence at deliberation; for a brilliant child might get the answers right straight off, without considering and rejecting alternatives. He has certainly not reflected or deliberated, but there is something that we might call quasi-deliberation here. Suppose that a child is asked 'What is to blood as white is to snow?' and, on giving the right answer straight off, is asked 'Why did you not say warm or liquid ?' It would be surprising if he could not answer that one, and his failure to answer it would lead us to suppose that his answer to the first question was a lucky guess. To think of blood is to think at once of at least some of the properties that he credits it with; he thought of something red, wet and warm; so that he did select colour as the relevant property and (in a way) reject temperature and state as irrelevant. The important question here is whether or not this gift for selecting the right answer straight off is or is not highly correlated with the ability to deliberate in the full sense, and this is an empirical question that I have never seen discussed. If there is no correlation, then psychologists either fail to test deliberative ability or test it only when the questions are such as to force even the most brilliant child to reflect. It would certainly be of interest to know if there is a high correlation; for if there was we should have a simple test for phronesis, and that is not lightly to be despised.</page></plain_text>
