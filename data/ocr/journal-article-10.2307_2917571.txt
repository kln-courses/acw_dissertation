<plain_text><page sequence="1">HEINE'S Sonnenuntergang AND AN AMERICAN MOON-MYTH. I do not know what may be the source of the beautiful moon-myth in Heine's "Sonnenunter- gang " (Die Nordsee, Erster Cyclus 3), whether from Classical antiquity, Jewish or German folk- lore, or the poet's own fancy. Both its pathos and its anthropomorphism seem to mark it as essentially Heinesque, but that, of course, is not to say that it may not be a bit of folk-lore turned, like the Lorelei, by Heine's delicate art into a poignant modem lyric of love and woe. In any case, it is unlikely that Heine got the suggestion from the mythology of the American Indians; yet the myth is (or rather was) to be found in all its essential features among the traditions of the Wyandots of Kansas and the Indian Territory. According to W. E. Connelley,1 who seems to have been a careful investigator and who unques- tionably had first-hand knowledge of the Wyan- dots (he was adopted into one of their clans), the Wyandot sun and moon myth runs as follows: " The Little Turtle made the Moon for a wife for the Sun. Many children were bom to them, and these are the Staxs that ' run about the sky,' as the Wyandots call the stars that move like the sun and moon. " After a time the Sun was displeased with his wife, the Moon. He drew her into the subter- ranean passage-way, and would have destroyed her there if the Little Turtle had not come and rescued her. He robbed her of all her heat and much of her light, and so maimed her that she could not keep pace with him in the sky. The New moon represents all that was left of the Sun's wife when the Little Turtle rescued her from her husband's wrath. The Little Turtle cured her to that degree that she regained gradually her original form; when, however, she had attained this, she immediately sickened from grief because of her husband's inattention and neglect, and pined away, diminishing daily until she altogether disappeared. When next seen she was again of the same size and form as when res- cued by the Little Turtle; then she increased gradually, animated with the hope that when she had reached her former fullness she could recover her husband's favor. Failing in this, she again wasted away; and this has been repeated over and over to this day; and it always will be until the end of time." How slight a change is needed to transform savage folk-lore into most acute and self-con- scious poetry of civilization-bow near we still are, in our imaginings and emotions, to " primi- tive man "-may be seen by a glance at Heine's poem. Just one item, the bise Zungen, is added, and we have Sonnenuntergang. Einst am Himmel glanzten, 1 Wyandot Folk-Lore. By William Elsey Connelley. Topeka, Kansas: Crane &amp; Co., 1899, p. 72. Mr. Lang, in his Myth, Ritual, and Religion, records a California Indian moon-myth somewhat resembling this of the Wyandots.</page><page sequence="2">206 MODERN LANGUA GE NOTES. [VoL xx, No. 7. Ehlich vereint, Luna, die G6ttin, und Sol, der Gott, Und es wimmelten urm sie her die Sterne, Die kleinen, unschuldigen Kinder. Doch b6se Zungen zischelten Zwiespalt, Und es trennte sich feindlich Das hohe, leuchtende Ehpaar. Jetzt am Tage, in einsamer Pracht, Ergeht sich dort oben der Sonnengott, Ob seiner Herrlichkeit Angebetet und vielbesungen Von stolzen, glickgehirteten Menschen. Aber des Nachts Am Himmel wandelt Luna, Die arme Mutter, Mit ihren verwaisten Stemenkindern, Und sie glinzt in stiller Webmuth, Und liebende Miidchen und sanfte Dichter Weihen ihr Thriinen und Lieder. Die weiche Luna I Weiblich gesinnt, Liebt sie noch immer den sch6nen Gemahl. Gegen Abend, zitternd und bleich, Lauscht sie hervor aus leichtem Gew6lk, Und schaut nach dem Scheidenden schmerzlich, Und m6chte ihm iingstlich rufen: "K omm I Komm I die Kinder verlangen nach dir ... Aber der trotzige Sonnengott, Bei dem Anblick der Gattin erglfilt er In doppeltem Purpur, Vor Zorn und Schmerz, Und unerbittlich eilt er hinab In sein fluthenkaltes Witwerbett. H. M. BELDEN.
