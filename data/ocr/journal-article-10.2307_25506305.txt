Fanning National Parks and Monuments Branch, Office of Public Works, Dublin and J. G. Hurst Inspectorate of Ancient Monuments, Department of the Environment, London Appendix by J. G. Hurst and J. M. Lewis (Communicated by E. Rynne, m.r.i.a.) [Received, 28 November 1974. Read, 28 April 1975. Published, 10 October, 1975.] Abstract A garderobe deposit in Ballyhack Castle, Co. Wexford, discovered during conservation works, contained an associated group of seventeenth-century imported pottery, a clay pipe and portion of a metal chafing-dish. The pottery consisted of a Spanish olive-jar, fine decorated wares of French, Portuguese, Dutch and English origin, and some English coarse wares. Their presence on this site was most likely the result of trading connections enjoyed by the Itchingham family who held the castle at the time. The deposit probably dates from the final period of occupation during the Cromwellian period. Introduction Ballyhack Castle1 stands beside the quay of the small fishing village of the same name on the eastern shore of Waterford Harbour, guarding the narrowest passage up-river to the ports of Waterford and New Ross. In early medieval times there was a house of the Knights Templars at Ballyhack which was subsequently taken over by the Knights Hospitallers.2 The present castle is a typical Irish tower-house of fifteenth or sixteenth-century date, five storeys high with a number of interesting features, including a small chapel recess in the eastern wall of the third floor. This latter feature, possibly designed for the use of a small religious community, may indicate some association with the Knights Hospitallers. The castle (PL II) is now a National Monument (No. 516) in the care of the Commissioners of Public Works, and a programme of preservation works on the building was recently undertaken by the National Parks and Monuments Branch of the Office of Public Works. During the course of this work, in the summer of 1 The castle is located in the townland of Ballyhack, parish of St. James and Dunbrody, barony of Shelbourne, Co.

They were discovered when the workmen were clearing the blocking of the outlet to a small garderobe shaft situated in the north-east corner of the castle. Mr. Louis Feeley, the clerk of works for the site, realising the probable import ance of the discovery, collected the objects for safe-keeping and subsequently notified the Inspector, Mr. D. N. Johnson, who asked him to inform one of the writers (T. F.) of the find. On examination, it was clear that the assemblage contained an associated group of imported pottery datable to the mid-seventeenth century, together with portion of a metal chafing-dish and a clay pipe. The find is of considerable importance in view of the ever-increasing occurrence of these wheel-made pottery types from current medieval and post-medieval sites in Ireland.

The surviving sherds enabled a complete reconstruction of the amphora shaped jar. It is unglazed and the coarse red micaceous ware has a grey, gritty core with buff surfaces. Height : 35cm. Max. diameter : 18.5cm. This is the typical elongated ' Middle Style ' shape A, with a collared type^B rim, characteristic throughout the seventeenth century.4 There are two basic shapes, elongated and globular, and they are widely distributed in north-western Europe from Ireland to Holland. Stratified complete examples are Vare, however, as unbroken jars are generally those dredged up from the sea while those found in archaeological sites are generally in a fragmentary condition. An appendix to this paper fists comparative material from Ireland and describes and illustrates the two main ' Middle Style ' types, found in Wexford Harbour and off the Fastnet Rock. Saintonge Type B polychrome bowls and dishes (Fig. 2) 2. A single surviving sherd from the central area of a flat-bottomed bowl. The fine off-white fabric has a white slip painted with brown and green and covered with a clear glaze. The applied roundel depicts a lion passant (PL III : 1). There is an example from Noordeind, North Holland, with an eagle,5 and there is another with anthropomorphic design recently found at Enkhuizen, also in Holland.6 3. Roughly half of the polychrome dish was preserved though badly shattered along the outer edge of the rim. The pink fabric has a mottled brown and green paint over a white slip, the whole covered by a clear glaze. These polychrome dishes are typical of the mid-seventeenth century. 4. A number of matching sherds from a two-lugged bowl with a plain rolled rim. The orange-pink fabric has a white slip covered with a mottled green and brown paint and a clear glaze. The surviving lug was applied, and has an off-white fabric as opposed to the pink of the bowl itself. It is decorated in relief with a design showing a face encircled by dancing suns (PI. 111:2), probably copied from the series of fine Palissy wares.7 This is a typical type of decoration on lugs and rims.8 4 J.

Several matching sherds from a dish with a simple rim and a ring foot. The off-white fabric is tin-glazed in the typical blues and white. Blue squiggles on the white outer surface and, internally, a panelled design in dark and light blue on the white ground (PI. IV :1). 6. Portion of a bowl with a simple rolled rim and a ring foot. Off-white fabric. Tin glazed in blues and white-blue splashes externally and a design containing stylised plant and leaf forms internally with a dash rim (PL IV :2). 7. One sherd from a third delftware bowl similarly glazed in blues and white. Mr. Michael Archer, of the Ceramics Department of the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, after examining photographs of the sherds has suggested that Nos. 5 and 7 are of probable Portuguese origin, dating to around the middle of the seventeenth century, while No. 6 may be Dutch. This is the first time that Portu guese delftware has been certainly identified from these islands though a few sherds from the large Plymouth series have been suspected as such but are really too small to be certain. Its absence from Ireland or Britain has always been surprising in view of the close contacts that existed at the time between Britain and Portugal and particularly when one recalls that Spanish imports dating from the same period have been found in southern Ireland and south-western England. Southwark cups (Fig. 3) 8. Portion of a small cup with the characteristic manganese colouring and white tin glaze on its outer surface. Off-wThite fabric with greyish-white tin glaze internally. This decoration is typical of Southwark delftware in the second quarter of the seventeenth century.9 9. The surviving portion shows the small cup-handle and the complete base. Glazed all over with a light grey tin glaze. Off-white fabric. Donyatt Type sgraffito (Fig. 3) 10. Almost half of this handled pot had survived. Hard-fired grey fabric. Greenish brown sgraffito decoration on a yellow ground splashed with brown and green on the neck and handle. The decoration consists chiefly of cross-hatchings on the neck and stylised leaf-motifs on the body (PL V:l). Greenish-brown internal glaze.

A single body sherd from a shallow bowl with slightly everted rim. Rilled below rim and near base. The red fabric has a yellowish-brown internal glaze but no decoration. This fabric is very similar to the North Devon sgraffito wares. 12. A rim-sherd of a chafing-dish in similar ware retaining portion of a pulled and twisted handle. Greenish-yellow glaze internally with traces of a white slip on the outer surface. The wavy rim is cut out of the thrown rim; the spacing is uncertain because the surviving portion near the handle may not be typical. Eight have been estimated but with a wider spacing there may only have been six. This is presuma bly an attempt to copy French chafing-dishes which often had eight knobs in the seventeenth century.11 Donyatt Type slipivare (Fig. 3) 13. The major portion of a flanged-rimmed pot with pulled and folded-over handle. Red fabric with a grey core in places. Dark green glaze. Decorated with trailed slip wavy lines and squiggles. (PL V : 2) This is best paralleled in the Donyatt area,12 in the mid-seventeenth century. Smoothware (Fig. 3) 14. A small tankard almost half of which has survived intact. Bands of parallel grooves below the rim and at the slightly splayed base. The fabric is hard-fired to a reddish grey and glazed a brownish green. This fabric is typical of Devon and is associated with the North Devon sgraffito and gravel-tempered fabrics in the seventeenth century. 15. Two body sherds, probably from a jar. The pale red fabric is fired to a light grey and glazed a yellowish-green internally. 16. A rim-sherd from a large vessel. The grey, well-fired fabric has a dark green glaze. Gravel-tempered ware (Fig. 4) 17. Rim-sherd, with typical laminated appearance from a large bowl. Hard reddish fabric with sandy, gritty core. Dark olive-green internal glaze. 18. Another rim-sherd from a somewhat similar but smaller bowl. The orange coloured fabric is well-fired and gritty. Brown internal glaze. These bowls with heavily moulded rims are the most characteristic production in gravel-tempered ware. 19. A pedestal base from a chafing-dish. Hard-fired red gritty fabric. Olive green internal glaze. 20. Another pedestal base from a chafing-dish. Well-fired reddish fabric with a grey but less gritty core. Yellowish-green internal glaze. 11 J. G.

There has not been an adequate study of these wares in England but they were exported in large quantities to America13 where there is a similar chafing-dish from Jamestown, Virginia.14 It is, therefore, useful to have these examples in a stratified seventeenth-century group.15 The date range of gravel-tempered ware is very wide throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. 18 C.

The bowl and portion of the stem of a small clay pipe. The bowl has traces of milling around the lip and a flat circular-shaped foot. The stem is of average thickness, with a rather small bore. The pipe is of a typical seventeenth century form datable to c. 1640-6016 and already known in this country from a seventeenth-century house site at " Thady's Fort ", Co. Clare.17 The Metal Chafing-Dish (Fig. 4) 22. The cast bowl is of copper alloy and was in a fragmentary and corroded condition when recovered with the pedestal-base missing. The bowl is slightly shaped above the carination and the rim flanges out to form a ledge from which rise three pointed dish-supports. Traces of double incised girth-lines are the only visible decorative feature. A small perforated projection for a ring-handle survives on one side. The perforation is now angled vertically, an indication that it is probably rivetted to the bowl though any trace of a rivet is obscured by corrosion. Similarly, all traces of the handle-staple on the opposite side are also obscured. Fragments of a number of fruit-stones18 were discovered adhering to the inner surface of the bowl. A flat piece of similarly corroded metal was found with the bowl but did not belong to it ; it is probably portion of the flat dish which would have rested in the dish-supports so completing the vessel. Diameter (rim) of bowl. 17.9cm. Mr. John M. Lewis of the National Museum of Wales, who has made a recent study of metal chafing-dishes, reports as follows on the Ballyhack specimen: " There can be no doubt that this bowl belongs to what I have called ' Type B \ The profile, the diameter and section of the rim, the thickness of the metal, the fonn and size of the dish-supports and staple, all correspond well with the vessels in the National Museum of Wales and the British Museum.19 Unfortunately there was no direct dating evidence for this type, the suggested date of fifteenth-sixteenth century being based on typological considerations?similarity of manufacture to Type A dishes and the fact that pottery versions with pointed dish-supports were being produced in Lincoln shire kilns c. 1475-1525. The date, therefore, is not a matter that can be pressed. 16 D. Atkinson and A. Oswald, ' London Clay Tobacco Pipes ', /. Brit. Arch ol. Ass., 32 (1969), 177, fig. 1,10. 17 E.

The dated context of the Ballyhack find is, therefore, useful for dating the dish rather than vice versa and suggests that the type probably continued into the seventeenth century. Appropos the suggestion made in the article that Type B was of English manufacture,20 it is interesting to note that the Ballyhack vessel is the second find of this type that has come to light since the article was published, the other being an old find from the belfry of St. Peter's Church, Winchester, which is still, as far as I know, in private hands." Discussion There are a number of documentary records extant which shed some fight on the history of Ballyhack and its owners in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. In the later fourteenth century the preceptory of the Knights Hospitallers at Ballyhack appears to have been only a ' subordinate ' of nearby Kilcloggan (Templetown), and at the Dissolution in 1541 William Keating, the last preceptor of both houses, was awarded a pension of ?18 per annum.21 There is no mention of Ballyhack in the list of possessions of Kilcloggan, but the neighbouring Cistercian Abbey of Dunbrody was possessed of " nine tenements and eight cottages in the town of Ballyhake '\22 These were granted initially to the Countess of Ormond, but on October 4th, 1545, all the possessions (including Ballyhack) of the dis solved monastery of Dunbrody in the county of Wexford were granted to Sir Osborne Itchingham,23 a Deputy-Marshall of the army in Ireland. From that time on the Itchinghams are frequently mentioned in the various documentary references to Dunbrody (their chief place of residence) and surround ing places such as Duncannon and Ballyhack. Edward Itchingham, the son and heir of Sir Osborne was regarded by the English as not above suspicion, and there is an interesting reference mentioned by Hore in his History of the Town and County of Wexford to an accusation made in 1580 that the above-named Edward was in league with pirates " and did receive part of the goods robbed by them and stolen within the haven of Waterford '\24 Nevertheless, in 1597 we find the same Edward acting as Deputy-Constable of Duncannon Fort.25 20 Ibid., p. 64. 21 J.

His good relations with the local merchants is exemplified by an inden ture dated the 20th January, 1612, where he is cited as a party to a settlement, possibly a marriage settlement, together with a number of other gentlemen including two merchants of Waterford City?Solomon Strong and Patrick White.27 When the rebellion broke out in 1641 the Itchinghams, like many other English Protestants, fled, probably to England or to the safety of Duncannon Fort.28 Their estates at Dunbrody, together with other properties in the area including the castle at Ballyhack, fell into Irish hands. Hore gives a vivid account, taken from contemporary sources, of an attack on the castle and hamlet by the English forces in 1642.29 The attackers burnt the fishing hamlet, but were un successful in their attempts to take the castle which was not regained by the English until 1649 when Cromwell's forces took it, and so gained control of the passage up river, as he himself states :30 " We have taken Ballyhack, a little castle lying upon that river, which commands it so that no relief can come from Waterford to that forte (Dun cannon) nor any put to sea for trade." The Civil Survey of Wexford, written down in 1654, lists the castle as being at that time in good repair and in English hands circa 1640.31 The owner was John Itchingham (grandson of the above John), the sole proprietor in the parish of Dun brody.32 In both the Civil Survey and the Book of Survey and Distribution he is given as the proprietor of some three score acres in Ballyhack prior to 1640.33 After the rebellion of 1641 was crushed and the Cromwellian settlement enforced in the 1650s, the lands and castle at Ballyhack were not forfeited but were restored to the Itchingham family. From a reference given by Hore it would appear, however, that John Itchingham did not survive the rebellion.34 The castle at Ballyhack, which, as we have seen was in good repair c. 1654, was proba bly re-occupied by some member of the family or a lessee. Its subsequent history is difficult to trace, but from an account of that part of Wexford, written in 1684 26 Records of the Rolls, Vol. II f. 98, (Lodge's MSS in the Public Record Office, Dublin). 27 Deeds and Wills from Inquisitions (Chancery), Co.

Leigh describes Ballyhack in the following manner : " ... it is a sad place to looke upon and has not about a h?lfe a dozen Houses, and an old pile of a castle, besides a fue Cabbins . . . "36 This wording would suggest that the castle was by that time, i.e. 1684, nothing more than an empty ruin, and if so provides us with a probable terminal date for the deposit in the gardrobe. The clear associations, (outlined in the documentary evidence) which both the site and the Itchingham family had with the trade of Waterford port will suffice to demonstrate how such a wealth of imported pottery could find its way to this small castle. Another Irish site, again defensive and coastal, has yielded a fine assemblage of sixteenth and seventeenth-century imported wares, viz. the promontory fort of Dooneendermotmore, Co. Cork,37 though at this site the im ports were most likely the result of piracy and ship-wrecking.38 The actual date, from the archaeological evidence, of the deposition of the pottery and other objects in the garderobe at Ballyhack presents some difficulties. The Spanish olive-jar could be from any date in the seventeenth century, while the Saintonge decorated w^ares are of early seventeenth-century type. The English slip-wares are, however, more likely to be after 1650 than before, while a date in the middle of the century or slightly earlier can be given to the Portuguese delftware. The best dating evidence is perhaps provided by the clay pipe which points to a date early in the third quarter of the seventeenth century. It is, therefore, suggested that the deposit dates to the years after 1650, which would seem the most likely period, especially if the English fully cleaned out the castle on its recovery from the Irish. To a large extent it is clear, therefore, that the historical and archaeological evidence coincide and, as a postscript, it might not be too rash to suggest the decade after 1654 as the actual date of the deposit. We know from Robert Leigh's account that the large limestone house built before the rebellion at Dunbrody by John Itchingham was never finished and still stood waste in 1684.39 Ballyhack Castle may, therefore, have served as a family or estate residence during the Cromwellian period. In 1660 John's daughter and heiress wras married, at the age of thirteen, to Arthur Chichester, Earl of Donegal.40 The estates passed to the latter family41 and the link with the Itchingham name was broken.

The probable date of its final abandonment, on the evidence quoted above, could be placed around 1660, plus or minus a few years. The disused garderobe shaft may then have served as a rubbish-pit and the pottery and other objects deposited therein.

APPENDIX THE SPANISH OLIVE-JAR IN IRELAND By J. G. Hurst and J. M. Lewis The occurrence of sherds of Spanish olive-jars at Ballyhack offers an oppor tunity to publish two such complete vessels from Ireland that have recently come to light, together with a list of Irish sites that have so far produced this material. ' Olive-jar ' is a term used for a class of vessels in use from the sixteenth to the nineteenth century as containers for exported olive oil, olives-in-brine, or wine. They seem to have been made in south-west Spain, probably round Seville or Cadiz, and were much used in the export trade to the Spanish colonies in the Caribbean and Central America, where they have been the subject of a detailed study by J. M. Goggin.1 In northern Europe their distribution is coastal, the west coast of Britain participating in this general trend,2 so that their recognition in Ireland must come as no surprise. 1 The Spanish Olive Jar: an Introductory Study.

Fig. 5?Spanish olive-jars from Wexford (1) and Fastnet (2). {Reproduced by permission of the National Museum of Wales) 1. The Wexford jar (Fig. 5:1) was found by Mr. Michael O'Brien, Maudlintown, Wexford in 1972, and donated by him to the National Museum of Ireland (Reg. No. 1972:357) through the good offices of Dr. Brendan Swan of the Old Wexford Society.3 The vessel is wheel-thrown, and buff in colour, being 45cm high and 20cm in maximum diameter. It has a typical amphora shape, resembling in profile a rather stubby carrot, and looks as if it might have been thrown in two separate sections. The opening is surrounded by a heavy ' ring-mouth ', its external profile narrowing towards the lip, which was made as a separate piece and is typical of these vessels. The surface is irregular, with faint wheel-marks. 2. The Fastnet jar (Fig. 5:2) was trawled off Fastnet Rock in 1942, and was deposited in the National Museum of Wales in 1959 by Mr. T. F. Powell, a former director of the Cardiff firm of Neil &amp; West. It was presented to the National Museum of Ireland (Reg. No. 1974:61) on permanent loan in 1974. It is roughly globular in shape, measuring 23cm in height and 21cm in maximum diameter, with a capacity of about 3.5 litres. Its body below the shoulder is faintly corru gated with wheel-marks. In contrast to the ' ring-mouth ' of the Wexford jar, it has a simple everted rim. The ware is buff-coloured and porous, with occasional large grits of up to 8mm maximum dimension protruding through the regular surface. It is not possible to tell what the original surface finish might have been, as the vessel has been much affected by long immersion, being encrusted in places 3 Our attention was drawn to this vessel by Mr. Etienne Rynne, Department of Archaeo logy, University College, Galway, to whom we are indebted.</page><page sequence="15">Fanning and Hurst?Mid seventeenth-century pottery group 117 with calcareous remains of tubular worms and other marine organisms. There is also a small area of vertical striations, caused no doubt by the battering it has received. The dating of olive-jars presents some difficulties, owing to the lack of dated contexts, and also because the three basic shapes (globular, elongated and pointed) seem to be contemporary : e.g. all three types are known from the Florida wreck San Antonio of 1621,4 and also from a limited area (probably one wrreck) in the estuary of the river Ranee, Brittany.5 Goggin bases his chronological scheme on an excavated sequence from a single site,6 and it depends to a great extent on the typological details of the mouth. According to this scheme, the Wexford jar would belong to his ' Middle Style ' to which he assigns a date range 1580-1780. The Fastnet jar cannot be fitted into his scheme: the globular shape and high everted mouth are features of the 'Early Style' (sixteenth century), but it lacks the handles and the method of construction of his early vessels, by which each side is thrown separately and joined together down the line of the handle; on the other hand, while its profile is closely comparable with some of the ' Late Style ' (1780-1850) jars, these do not appear to include the high everted mouth of the Fastnet vessel. It would be wrong to place too much reliance on the universal application of this chronological scheme. The gradual accumulation of a repertory of samples from dated contexts is the method that offers most hope of success. Olive-jars from Irish sites (provisional list) Co.
