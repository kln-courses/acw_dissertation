<plain_text><page sequence="1">[i6] DOGON CULTURE-PROFANE AND ARCANE MARY DOUGLAS SOME years ago Madame Dieterlen astonished the anthropology students in London University with the wealth of detail about Dogon culture which was at her command. They were not less impressed when she explained that the first twenty years of field research among the Dogon had been the most arduous and that sub- sequent work was more and more rewarding. Now the already considerable ethno- graphy of the Dogon is enriched by two major documentations, Le Renardpdle by Marcel Griaule and Germaine Dieterlen, and Ethnologie et langage by Genevieve Calame-Griaule.' Madame Dieterlen describes how willingly the Dogon associated themselves with the research: answering questions put by successive ethnological expeditions since I93 they had come to see that unless they themselves took a much more active role the programme would never be realized. In 1947 the main priests of a particular region took the initiative to co-operate more fully by allocating a highly competent instructor to the late Marcel Griaule. After daily lessons and daily confidential reports to the priestly council, the book Dieu d'eau was recorded. The gesture was all the more generous since the Dogon in making it knew that they thus exposed them- selves to years and years more of deep research into their culture. These books bear the mark both of Dogon enthusiasm and initiative, first in the impressive depth of detail in which their culture is recorded and second in that it is still presented as seen by the Dogon themselves. The pale fox is the enigmatic principle of disorder in Dogon cosmology. He is anti-society, anti-law, the disobedient son of the creator who committed incest with his mother, the Earth, and was three times punished, first by being turned into an animal, second by being circumcised, and third by being deprived of human speech. But he remained a source of knowledge and of power, used by humans in divination. Le Renardpdle is a transcription of the full myth sequence of Dogon esoteric know- ledge. Volume one deals with the creation of the world. The second volume will deal with the history of the first sixty-six years of human life on earth. Dogon initiates receive this knowledge at the last stage of instruction. The book contains spon- taneously offered Dogon illustrations of the symbols used in their sacred drawings and a Dogon exegesis of the myth and of accompanying rites. It is offered as a source book for comparative religion on the themes of sacrifice, totemism, African astronomy, and many other matters. The authors do not intervene in the role of critics, or even as interpreters. They are mere editors of work in which the Dogon themselves express their own thought. This means to some extent that the future researcher is expected to do his own field-work in the two volumes to produce and test his own hypotheses. One drawback of this method is that two volumes are short for present- ing all the data about the religious doctrines of a culture. Some selection has evidently 1 Le Renardpdle, par Marcel Griaule et Germaine logic et langage: la parole chez les Dogon, par Genevieve Dieterlen, Paris; Institut d'Ethnologie, 1965; Ethno- Calame-Griaule, Paris: Gallimard, I966.</page><page sequence="2">DOGON CULTURE-PROFANE AND ARCANE been made. But it is difficult to know where the cuts come and to distinguish the voice of the theologian from that of the sacristan. The other drawback is one to which I shall return: any wish to know more than the Dogon themselves know about the relation of culture to society is naturally frustrated. Ethnologie et langage, by contrast, carries the stamp of the author's mind and training. Lucid, methodical, and penetrating, this is a model for ethnolinguists, but it is not a book about a language from the linguistic point of view. Rather it is an account of Dogon reflections upon language in general and on their language in particular. M. Leenhard has done something of the kind in Melanesia much earlier (1947) and D. Zahan for the Bambara (I963). This volume is a remarkable addition to the range, not only because of the elegance of presentation but because of the profound insights of the author as well as of the Dogon themselves. The late Professor Griaule was fond of insisting that the wisdom of the Dogon matched that of any of the great classical cultures which have formed the European tradition. The solid basis for his enthusiasm is now made very clear by his daughter's account of what might be called the Dogon theory of knowledge and sociolinguistics. Subtlety for subtlety and insight for insight a close comparison between Logos and Dogon So: would be fascinating, though of course the insights are not the same in the two cultures. Equally interesting would be a comparison of sexual symbolism, the idea of duality in Plato, say, and in Dogon. Here, instead of underlining similarities, I wish to fasten attention upon certain crude differences, for it is starkly clear that the Dogon attitude of mind, for all its wisdom, could never have become the progenitor of modern civilization. We have here the opportunity of recognizing what is essentially characteristic of the primitive culture. The Dogon have created out of their reflections on speech a symbolic structure uniformly embracing their entire universe. The grain of millet in its husk-the human foetus in its placenta-the world in its atmospheric envelope are each analogs of the others. The constituent materials and morphology of speech are seen to correspond to those of cereals, of man, of woven cloth, of the whole cosmos. The same intricate harmony of images is drawn down and across from one level of experience to the next. Reading it is like gazing through a microscope at a flourishing form of life, confusingly alien and familiar. An aperture may be the mouth of a monster, of a dwelling, or of a man; plants and animals exchange their characteristics and fish have drolly human faces; women are less like humans than cosmic powers, while men are less like men than solemn ritual figures on processional banners, with sudden un- expected lapses into human vanity. The lens through which the Dogon see them- selves in this way is their theory of speech. Many primitive cultures use one relatively narrow range of experience for develop- ing a symbolic code. Nilotic peoples do this to some extent with cattle symbolism. Lienhardt has shown how such primary experiences as those of colour are mediated for Dinka children by prior reference to cattle colours; a man's image of himself is mediated by his identification with an ox, his experience of society is summed up in a series of animal sacrifices which give material for profound reflections on the nature of life and truth (Lienhardt, I96I); Ndembu develop something comparable by reflecting on the common qualities of juicy elements in men and trees: different coloured saps are classified with blood and milk and bile and from their likenesses c 17</page><page sequence="3">DOGON CULTURE-PROFANE AND ARCANE a cosmic harmony is derived (Turner, 1966). The Bushmen, reflecting on the mor- phology of human and animal bodies, have developed what Levi-Strauss has called anatomical totemism. And so on. But the originality of the Dogon in this list is that they confer an intellectual unity on experience by reflecting thus on the nature, power, and effects of language. On first view this would presuppose a degree of self-consciousness about the pro- cesses of thought which would lift their culture clear out of the class of primitives. If they are capable of self-reflection, if they can put speech itself on a slide and inspect and analyse it, they should be brought forward at once to take their place in the twentieth century where such self-analysis is the favourite occupation of philosophers and artists. The prospect is an exciting one. It is not fantastic to hope that the fully recorded epistemology of an ancient West African culture should produce a kind of breakthrough for us. It could at least produce a new perspective such as that pro- duced in European art at the turn of the century by the impact of African sculpture. Sociolinguists may well find in this book that points of view which they are struggling now to assert, such as the total relevance of social context to the study of language, have long been accepted by Dogon colleagues. However, without being a linguist myself, I hazard the guess that the Dogon approach is not likely to provoke startling new sets of hypotheses. For experience which is mediated by an elaborate cosmic symbolism based on speech itself is scarcely more universal or less hidebound within the circle of its metaphors than experience which is mediated by cattle, tree, or food symbolism. Perhaps more restricted. Thought needs to be free and agile for per- forming the acrobatics of introspection, but Dogon thought is weighed down by the embellishments of its speech symbolism. It starts off with an encouragingly empirical set of discriminations. The Dogon divide the world into two categories, those with and those without speech. Babies and animals are in the latter class, for speech is essentially the faculty of speaking an articulated and meaningful language. All living beings have voice and so do musical instruments, but the latter have a form of speech of their own. To some extent every social interaction presupposes an exchange of words and every individual action is a form of expression: speech, therefore, is synonymous with action. Action is the final outcome of speech and speech is the instrument of thought. At one end of the scale thought counts as a form of speech, for one uses words for thinking without giving them voice. At the other end, social intercourse is speech at its most vital and effective. The biological processes by which speech and thought are related are quaintly mechanistic. The different elements of speech are diffused in the form of water throughout the body. When a man speaks the words issue as steam, the water of speech having been heated by the heart. If a thought is not expressed in speech, then it is cooled by the pancreas and retains its watery state, but it can always be re-heated. So thought is a latent form of speech: a thought which does not seek expression in words is not a thought at all. Dogon reflections on speech are inevitably interwoven with their conception of the nature of man, of his place and destiny in the universe. Speech is the means of expres- sing social rules, tradition, etiquette, and learning. The universe is the work of a creator whose act of creating is speech itself. His world is entirely composed of signs, nothing in it is without significance for men. i8</page><page sequence="4">DOGON CULTURE-PROFANE AND ARCANE 19 The author's use of the word ' humanism' to describe this man-centred religious world-view is very Durkheimian. It runs counter to the usage of Renaissance scholars who use humanism for the shattering of the primitive, anthropomorphic world-view of medieval Christianity. Here again, as much as with Platonic metaphysics, a parallel could well be drawn between the Dogon idea of the body as an image of the cosmos and the Christian doctrine of the Mystical Body of Christ, the marriage of Christ with the Church, the physical world of signs and messages from God to man, and so on. How the Dogon discern the constituent parts of speech depends on the Dogon view of personality. This involves their complex numerical symbolism, which has often been discussed in other publications. Here the Dogon part company frankly with empirical observation. The human body has 22 parts: 22 is the key number of the universe and the basis of all taxonomy. They arrive at 22 in a highly arbitrary fashion. The first 9 parts of the body are feet, shins, thighs, lumbar region, stomach, chest, arms, neck, and head. So, puzzlingly, the 2 feet only count as I, the z thighs as i more. To this basic 9, which henceforth takes on the symbolic representation of the human body, is added io for the io fingers-thus making 19. Nineteen again takes on significance as a base number for representing a human person. To this is added 3, the number of the male sex, which gives 22. Thus we start with a numerical symbolism whose units are arrived at, not by simple counting, but by a process of evaluation and summation. Blood, which includes all bodily liquids, irrigates and gives life to the body as rivers to the earth: it includes a substance, blood-oil, which gives strength and health and procreative power and plays an essential part in the production of speech. When it comes to the eight invisible grains of cereal which are thought to lie in the clavicles, we are far from observed reality and fully in the realm of metaphysics. Their irrigation, drying, and germination determine the course of an individual's life and speech. Finally there is nyama or vital force, a fluid carried by the blood, genetically differentiated for each individual. Nyama reacts powerfully to speech. The composition of the personality is analysed in much more minute detail with significant variations for male and female such that each sex carries com- ponents of the other sex in complementary positions and qualities and is differently linked to the terrestrial waters of marsh and stream. In the last analysis the human being appears with a material frame, the body, distinct from the external world but in close osmosis with it thanks to the circulation of common elements through both. The human person is not closed but open to its environment and bathing in it. But persons are separate from other persons and speech is like a canal, affording com- munication between them. As Dogon consider speech as an emanation of the human being, they also see it as duplicating all the essential characteristics of bodily existence. The body of speech is sound formed, like the human body and like the earth, of water, air, earth, and fire. Water is necessary to speech as it is to all living things: without saliva speech becomes dry; air is the basis of the sound vibrations and it carries the steam charged with sound; earth gives speech its weight or meaning; the structure of the discourse corresponds to the skeleton of the body, this distinguishes speech from noise; fire is the warmth of speech, it can be burning or cold according to the mood of the speaker. Speech also contains oil which makes it unctuous and pleasing. Speech is articulated and sexed, like the body. High pitch is feminine, low is masculine.</page><page sequence="5">DOGON CULTURE-PROFANE AND ARCANE It too contains grains of cereal; empty, vain words are without interest or result. The nyama or vital force of speech derives from that of the speaker, and it carries power and conviction. Like the nyama of a person, it is borne along in the blood- stream of the body and finally depends on the water in the body. The decision to speak is taken in the head, where the brain communicates with the clavicles via the larynx. The clavicles are likened to a granary, guardian of the spiritual principles and of speech, source of vital energy; the grains contained therein bathe in water and are perpetually in a state of germination, producing the energy which circulates in the body with blood. When the words chosen by the brain begin to stir up the liver, the pressure produced by the filling of the lungs sends the steam up to the clavicles which have a final part in authorizing the speech to come out of the mouth. There is no need here to follow the detailed analysis of speech production which derives from this crude physiology and simple psychology of cold and hot emotions. Nor is it necessary to summarize the detailed classification of forty-eight types of speech, except to say that each is assigned to a type of work, an animal species, a part of the anatomy, certain plants and insects, and to one or other sex. So far from producing a modern linguistic philosophy in a primitive setting, the Dogon have merely used their linguistic sophistication to create another highly structured type of symbolic patterning-a totemism of linguistics, as it were. To take one example, the first of the forty-eight types of speech may be translated as trivial speech whose motif idea is aimless scattering. Its corresponding word is the broad- cast scattering of seed by the farmer; the animal is the red monkey who raids the fields and disperses the efforts of the farmer; they also compare the Fulani pastoralists to the red monkey since he waits till the farmer has finished for pasturing his live- stock: the bodily organ is the stomach, since the red monkey does not digest the millet which he has gobbled up greedily, and is subject to diarrhoea-another kind of scattering; the corresponding plants are cereals of too poor a quality to keep for seed, but suitable for beer; grasshoppers are associated with this kind of speech since they defecate as fast as they eat, suggesting profitless activity; the sex is feminine. The forty-eight kinds of speech are divided into two groups, one under the sign of Nommo, the other under the sign of Yourougou. This division relates to the myth of creating of the universe. Amma, the creator god, first made two androgynous twins; one of these revolted against paternal authority and committed incest with the Earth, its mother. The other saved the world by his self-sacrifice. The first was turned into a pale fox for his crime, the second, Nommo, brought its human, animal, and plant populations to the earth and took over from the creator the mastery of speech. Nommo and the Fox, his brother, are in continual conflict. According to the author, the Fox represents fallen humanity, subject to its own destructive instincts; Nommo represents humanity idealized and triumphant. The speech of Nommo is human speech; the speech of the Fox is mute, a language of signs made by his paws and only able to be interpreted by an initiated diviner. But the forty-eight recognized kinds of speech are not all human speech, nor are they divided equally between human speech under the sign of Nommo and divinatory signs under the Fox. The twenty-four classes of Nommo are balanced against those of the Fox as follows. 20</page><page sequence="6">DOGON CULTURE-PROFANE AND ARCANE Fox i. trivial speech 2. commercial speech 3. angry speech 4. gay speech 5. confidential speech 6. divinatory speech 7. riddles 8. judgements (of old men) 9. judgements (of head priest) io. scolding I . names 12. threats I3. internal speech I4. last words 15. numbers I6. traditions 17. circumcision and excision i 8. purification rites I9. thanks 20. beer drinking z2. prayers 22. commands 23. discussions about inheritance 24. forbidden subjects I. false promises 2. contradiction 3. stuttering 4. truth (unexpressed) 5. apology 6. dream speech 7. insults and breaches of taboo 8. truth (expressed) 9. congratulations on a marriage Io. disputes and ritual songs of masks i. courtship 12. children's ritual games of theft 13. seeking the truth 14. learning to speak 5. concerning impurity of circumcision I6. formulas of healing and sorcery 17. bad fortune and mourning 18. love-making of spouses 19. menstruating women 20. burial and death 2I. taking up an old matter 22. boasting 23. irrelevant speech 24. nasalized speech There is a complex interplay in these ideas with the symbolism of sex and of life and death. The world of the Fox inverts the associations and values of the world of Nommo by means of a very complex parallelism of opposites. It is too simple to say that the Fox has the world of night and death and obscurity, Nommo of day and life and clarity. One can only admire the cool dexterity with which Madame Calame- Griaule draws out the contrasts in her bold but subtle hypotheses. The third part of the book is concerned with speech in social life. The growth of a child to maturity is treated as a progressive acquisition of the adult speech appro- priate to its sex and accompanied by rituals averting the dangers of bad forms of speech and encouraging the growth of good forms. Each recognized social situation is defined by its type of speech and speaking roles, though not as unequivocally as Nuer define kinship by cattle transfers. For example, the relative inferiority and unreliability and irrationality of the female sex is continually symbolized by these means. Inarticulate forms of speech lie in the area of communication which most interests me and to which I myself would be disposed to come to the Dogon for enlighten- ment if I were more optimistic about the wider application of their ideas. The object of all behavioural sciences is somehow to go behind the external forms of behaviour and to discover other information than that which is overtly expressed. Since the latter is often puzzling and contradictory, some of it often makes better sense when its hidden aspects are revealed. Silence, hesitation, contradiction, and confused speech, are as interesting as clear speech. But Dogon comments on these show no special Nommo 21</page><page sequence="7">DOGON CULTURE-PROFANE AND ARCANE profundity. As presented here they recall the researcher who is content to classify his matter rather than to recognize and solve a problem. The speech of the drunkard has neither oil nor grain, it has more beer than water, it is gusty and goes in big zigzags. False promises are equivalent to theft. At this level of interpretation the Dogon seem not to know the experience of having one sort of speech rise up in the mind while another sort involuntarily issues from the mouth. At the level of linguistic analysis they seem to be so impressed by speech as a thing in itself that they never con- template words as representing experiences which might have assumed alternative expression. They can hardly entertain a Whorfian hypothesis about the interaction between language and thought, since they allow for no difference between the two. Though they know that a man can utter lies they do not here admit that he can be deceived himself by the power of his own words. To compare their theory of speech with that of our linguists reminds me of the riddle about training the mind and minding the train. Both are structuralists but the Dogon structure their analysis while the linguists analyse structures. For example, when Professor Halliday declares that all behavioural activity can be analysed on the double axis of chain and choice, he proceeds to draw an analogy between the struc- ture of selections which can be made in eating and in speaking. The distinction between range of possible breakfast foods and range of possible meals in the day equally applies to a distinction between grammatical selections (I961). The Dogon also draw parallels between language and food, as they do between language and everything else. Halliday may not derive from his analogies an argument in favour of a particular breakfast cereal or for the subjection of women. But when the Dogon are drawing their complex pattern of analogies they are directly sustaining a political concept. They are not rejoicing in a spirit of inquiry, but celebrating a particular social order. This is why I am dubious about the late Professor Griaule's comparison of Dogon with the most significant aspects of Greek philosophy. There is no scope in such an atmosphere of thought for a Hippocrates to demand empirical evidence for the grains of cereal in the clavicle. Madame Calame-Griaule herself notes this rigidity when she asks what place is allowed to freedom in Dogon esteem. ... on peut craindre que trop de codifications n'aboutissent a un formalisme sterile, qui ramenerait la societe au peril d'immobilisme qu'elle voulait justement eviter. Nous pouvons nous demander quelle place la societe Dogon fait a la liberte. And here she answers the question posed above concerning Dogon sophistication about the relation between words and the reality they signify, the relation between form and content, language and thought, and the rest. Divination, by consulting the obscure sign language of the Fox, precisely aims at freedom from the formal conditions of knowledge. Divination gives access to a reality which is free of the restrictive frame of time. Undoubtedly the Dogon have recognized that behind the world of spoken interactions there are other important relations to be known. At the levels at which they themselves are so articulate they seem to have completely separated the understanding of overt human behaviour from the understanding of hidden motivations. But I have no doubt that at the less articulate but practical level the two theories fuse together, each complementing the other. 22</page><page sequence="8">DOGON CULTURE-PROFANE AND ARCANE Most unfortunately this practical level of interaction is not recorded. Griaule and Paulme have published accounts of how the system of interpretation would work, with hypothetical cases. But there is no study of an actual divinatory session, still less of any related series of divinations. M. Griaule's Notes sur la Divination par le Chacal do not tell what social acumen or what external sources of information the diviner uses to guide his interpretation or what social situations are changed by divination. Denise Paulme likewise (I937) examines the technique of divination but not its social context. If only the high metaphysical subtlety of the French could be allied with the low sociological cunning of the Anglo-Saxon. Then we could hope for the Dogon to come alive off their processional banners and enact for us just how individuals use these oracular techniques for manipulating real situations. Sorcerers are mentioned ten times by Madame Calame-Griaule as associated with impurity, with night, dis- covered by divination, and so on. But who gets accused of sorcery and for what sort of offence ? An insight such as Steiner's analysis of truth ( 954) or Lienhardt's relation of truth to social reality in Dinka sacrifice (op. cit.) or Mrs. Elizabeth Marshall Thomas's graphic description (1965) of Dodoth divination for predicting cattle raids, would marvellously illuminate these records. This dividing line which the Dogon draw between two kinds of language and truth also divides anthropology into two parts: in the part of Nommo, systematic analyses of formal symbolic structures; in the part of the Fox, systematic attempts to pierce the veil of recorded utterances and reach hidden knowledge about those obscure areas of experience in which symbolic forms are generated and have effect. I have said that the two works under review are based on the Dogon official view of themselves. But they do not seek to relate informants' statements to practice. Thus they fail to observe any contradiction between ideal and actual. The authors accept the system as the Dogon themselves describe it, and are content with very summary statements of the social structure. Quick though they are to see movement and dynamism in the realm of ideas, they still present Dogon society as a static, conflict-free system. Griaule-Dieterlen say that Dogon marriage is stable (p. 28) and Calame-Griaule says it is very unstable (p. 324). The analysis of social institutions is so simple that the contradiction does not matter. They are content with bluntly asserting that the symbolic structure accords with the social structure, but social structure is under- stood in a very broad sense as relations based on age, sex, and authority. Or, chez les Dogon, comme ailleurs, l'organisation sociale, politique et l'economie sont en interdependance avec le systeme des croyances, ceci en fonction d'une apprehension globale, dans la vie sociale, du monde surnaturel, du monde des vivants et de celui des ancetres. (Griaule-Dieterlen, p. 24.) But what a pity to leave this interdependence at such a level of generality-' comme ailleurs '. Many dual systems of cosmology have been recorded, and dual social systems too. Duality in itself is now too gross a concept for classification. At this time it would be marvellous to know whether particular varieties of dualism are associated with any particular varieties of social structure. It is possible to imagine several ways in which the four tribal groupings of the Dogon interact to produce a social duality which might relate dynamically to their world view. But who would be content to leave it 23</page><page sequence="9">DOGON CULTURE-PROFANE AND ARCANE to the imagination? The relations of the lineages and four tribes could be sustained by straight structural opposition of the Nuer-Tiv type, or it could be based on a Tallensi model of complementary interaction, as David Tait once worked out (I 95). It need not be based on structural opposition at all, but if it is we would like to know at what level and in what contexts the oppositions are overcome. Whereas at the level of sacred symbolism, a follower of the Greek Orthodox rite might have much in common with a member of the American Episcopalian church, at the level of ideas about conscience, death, and judgement they might disagree profoundly. The English social anthropologist has a traditional bias to curiosity about the latter kinds of disagreement. What do the Dogon think about sin ? It is not enough to dig in their mythology for the answer. Without going back to Robertson-Smith, we know that Calvinists and Catholics with access to the same sacred myths have different ideas of evil. The presentation of their myths and cosmological ideas rouses a longing to reach the hidden areas of Dogon social experience, the arcane knowledge which only the esoteric techniques of the sociologist can reveal. But we cannot have recourse to the Fox to reveal the secret sphere which lies behind and across the formal Dogon view of themselves. BIBLIOGRAPHY CALAME-GRIAULE, G. I965. Ethnologie et langage.

Le regrette Professeur Griaule insistait sur les similitudes que l'on trouve dans les cosmologies Grecque et Dogon, mais les differences ne sont pas moins instructives. Nombre de cultures africaines utilisent un champ d'expdrience limite pour developper le code de leurs symboles cosmiques. Les Nilo-Hamitiques font preuve d'un symbolisme reposant sur le betail, les Ndembu d'un symbolisme base sur les secretions corporelles, les Bushmen utilisent une morphologie animale, les Dogon expriment leur savoir au moyen d'un symbolisme linguistique et numerique que l'on peut considerer comme une sorte de totemisme linguistique. Le 24</page><page sequence="10">DOGON CULTURE-PROFANE AND ARCANE systeme est des plus arbitraires, pas du tout empirique et rigide. Ii est evident que la structure sociale a laquelle appartient cette cosmologie, n'est pas pour encourager les querelles philosophiques. C'est la une grande diffdrence avec la Grece d'Hippocrate. Les diffdrences entre les centres d'interet de l'anthropologie chez les Anglais et chez les Fran~ais, se signalent par le manque d'information, chez ces derniers, concernant l'interaction de la structure sociale et de la cosmologie, la preeminence etant donnee a cette derniere. Ces etudes ethno- graphiques fournissent le point de vue officiel que les Dogons ont d'eux-memes; elles ne se contentent pas d'exposer les declarations d'informateurs, et ainsi il n'y a aucune divergence entre les idees et la realite. On a deja etudie de nombreux systemes dualistes en cosmologie ainsi que des organisations sociales dualistes. Il est possible que l'importance de la gemelleite, dans la culture Dogon, corresponde a un fait social d'opposition entre deux lignages. De toutes faSons, tous les rapports pouvant exister entre leur cosmologie et leur structure sociale valent la peine d'etre pris en consideration. CONTRIBUTORS TO THIS NUMBER R. G. WILLIS.
