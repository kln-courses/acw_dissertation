The exhibition was based on fieldwork conducted in Mali by Jean-Paul Colleyn, who also wrote the accompanying catalogue. It included Catherine De Clippel's field pho- tographs together with objects from private collections in Milan, Venice, and Bergamo. A chi wara from the Museo di Scienze Naturali E. Caffi in Bergamo and a Kono mask from the Museo delle Culture Extraeuropee Dinz Rialto in Rimini were the only museum pieces on display. "Bamanaya" dealt with a large and com- plex subject in a very compact installation con- sisting of a single room lined with twenty-five glass cases, and with another case in the mid- dle of the gallery. The concept of Bamanaya essentially means Bamana-ness or Bamana eth- nicity, per the glossary in Mary Jo Arnoldi's Playing with Time: Art and Performance in Central Mali (Bloomington, 1995). It was also explained ----D WI PIETRO NOTARIANNI by Colleyn in a text panel as a "path within a culture...and a way to relate to the world which is expressed in two ways: through a masked dancer and through trance." Bamana associations, which are instrumental in the political, social, and religious arenas, use distinctive masks and other objects during yearly festivals and rituals. Six basic sec- tions addressed key aspects of the concept of Bamanaya. Each section alternated between photographic cases and object cases devoted to the different associations. The first section introduced the viewer to Mali and gave an overview of its history, including a discussion of the Ghana Empire, the conversion to Islam, Mansa Musa, and the Songhai Empire. An excellent map highlight- ed the Bamana area. A copy of "The Dance of the Chi Wara" by L. Levol-Darribere was ex- hibited alongside an elegant chi wara figure from the Museo di Scienze Naturali E. Caffi. The continuing interrelationship between Islam and the concept of Bamanaya was illus- trated by lovely photographs of the Tadyana Mosque, elders partaking in a philosophical debate, and a Nya sanctuary in Morona. Photographs of ancestral doors and a name- giving ceremony in Nyienso suggested the 81</page><page sequence="2">importance of social organization and individ- uality. The concept of death was beautifully illustrated with a text by Pascal Baba Coulibali (Ntiola, 1990). The following four sections looked at asso- ciations chronologically, as they figured in a person's life. Ton initiation associations and Sogow masks were the subject of the second section. The Bamana regard Ton as a large cooperative whose duties are to help people and organize yearly cultural activities that include masquerade and theatrical perfor- mances. The photographs documented mas- querades in Tadyane, Sogow musicians, and a Koteba masquerade in the village of Kirango. An elegant Sogo antelope headdress was dis- played, as was a Yayoroba puppet ("beautiful lady"), the latter shown with a photograph of la Yayoroba in the village of Markala. The third section, "Ritual as Experience," acted as an introduction to initiation associa- tions and how they affect a person's life. Photo- graphs representing a dance for the Nya ritual, harp players, and children drumming for a chi wara were particularly compelling. The subject of the next and largest section was Jow initiation associations, including the Ntomo, Kore, Jo, and Gwan. The Ntomo asso- ciation is essentially responsible for the reli- gious and social education of uncircumcised boys. During the initiation festivals, members wear wooden face masks. Photographs of an Ntomo mask in Markala were used to contex- tualize five Ntomo masks on display. A five- horn example with a small anthropomorphic figure of a monkey was striking because of its stark lines and simplicity. Many Kore association masks have abstract features. Representing antelopes and hyenas, they signify a member's level in the association and "educate the community about responsi- ble behavior" (Patrick McNaughton, The Mande Blacksmiths: Knowledge, Power and Art in West Africa, Bloomington, 1988, p. 104). Four hyena masks and a Sula mask were displayed in this section, along with a beautiful photo- graph of a mother of twins, who is thereby entitled to belong to the Kore association. The Jo and Gwan associations, the latter concerned with fertility, have both male and female members who participate in dances and performances. Members of the Jo associa- tion use little wooden figures, maani ("little person") or nyeleni ("little pretty one"), that represent a woman in the prime of life. The five extremely stylized figures on display were dressed and adorned with scarification motifs. The fifth section explained secret and vol- untary associations such as the Chi Wara, Komo, Kono, Manya, and Nya, essential ele- ments in the political, social, and judiciary are- nas. The Chi Wara is well known because of its graceful antelope headdresses. Photographs of a Chi Wara couple, a drummer, and a farmer illustrated the importance of this association in agricultural communities. "Bamanaya" in- cluded eight vertical headdresses, one of them a lovely example from the Segou region. The extremely powerful Komo men's association functions as a source of protection for the community. Its leadership is restricted to 82 smiths. In addition to a Komo mask, a rather unusual figure of a vulture was shown. Such figures are used for divination practices. A text panel explained the power and secrecy of some of these associations and their objects most efficiently by quoting Sedou Traore from McNaughton's The Mande Blacksmiths, p. 129: "The Komo mask is made to look like an ani- mal. But it is not an animal, it is a secret." The Kono association was represented by a fine horizontal mask from the Museo delle Culture Extraeuropee Dinz Rialto and by photographs of sanctuaries that highlighted their ephemer- al, fantastical shapes.

The sixth section, on possession rituals such as the Nya and Nankon, included photographs of Nankon association dancers, a Nya proces- sion, and individuals in trance. Several pho- tographs of altars (boli)-particularly the image of the boli in Manya-strikingly con- veyed the strength and secrecy that surrounds such objects. alrican arts * winter 1999</page><page sequence="3">PIETRO NOTARIANNI Left: Maani figure of the Jo association.

The concluding section concerned black- smiths. Bamana smiths are ritual specialists and are considered to have great knowledge of medicine, amulet making, and divination. The photographs illustrated anvils and, most important, smiths preparing altars. A central case was entirely devoted to "strong" objects. There was a Komo shirt, a mask, a friction drum, and four protective charms. The case also contained four boli in the form of composite figures made of fiber, mud, wood, and sacrificial materials. The exhibition strongly illustrated the fact Bamanaya is not a homogeneous phenomenon, nor it is one that can be easily explained. Its aim was not to highlight masterpieces but rather to use objects to illustrate important aspects de- winter 1999 ? atrican arts scribed in the text panels and shown in the pho- tographs. With this in mind, the show might have been more effective if there had been fewer objects and greater emphasis on De Clippel's excellent photographic material, which, with the text panels, effectively expressed and ex- plained the central theme of "Bamanaya." It was regrettable that the labels did not include dates for photographs or objects, nor was there information on provenance for all the objects. This exhibition was on view while the back part of the gallery was undergoing remodel- ing. I was pleasantly surprised by the number of visitors and by the equally lively discussions "Bamanaya" engendered, despite the whir- ring of drills and the pounding of hammers. Considering that Italy is becoming increasing- ly pluriethnic, one hopes that an exhibition like "Bamanaya" will help to heighten the Italian public's awareness of African societies, their dynamism and their art, and encourage future exhibitions.

SIGNES PLURIELS Galerie Nationale Dakar, Senegal March 19-April 23, 1999 Reviewed by Peter Mark The works of thirteen contemporary Sene- galese artists exhibited in "Signes pluriels" vividly attested to the dynamic vigor of con- temporary painting and sculpture in this West African nation. Art, pace Arthur Danto, is not dead. Anyone doubting this observation had only to view this vibrant show at Dakar's Galerie Nationale. The challenge of giving voice to local cultural traditions through painting and sculpture has led to innovative 83</page></plain_text>
