<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE TERMINAL Steven Spielberg, U.S., 2004 Responses to September 1 1 in American cinema have been few and far between, treating the political present with kid gloves. So American viewers sick of seeing contemporary social realities denied in favor of those safely ensconced in the past ( Chicago , Seabiscuit ) will embrace the first 20 min- utes of Steven Spielberg's The Terminal. Here, elaborate crane glides and vertiginous high angles ere- ate an ominous introduction to an America that is very much this one. Eastern European traveler Victor Navorski (Tom Hanks) arrives H in New York's JFK International Airport and finds himself thrust into the insulated, poly- glot disorientation of today's immigrant expe- rience. "Business or pleasure?" is repeated in an endless cycle by ticket-taking automa- tons, in quick flashes that precisely mirror Schindlers Lisť s opening montage of disembodied German- Jewish voices and names, stamps, and passports. A contem- porary nightmare of Starbucks, Burger King, and Borders, the airport's vertically stacked structure of capitalist excess is nearly anthropomorphic in its ability to intimidate. Upon crossing the gate's threshold, Hanks is whisked away by guards and brought directly to the office of Stanley Tucci's smug Tom Ridge stand-in, Frank Dixon, who informs the uncommunicative traveler that his homeland has broken FILMCOMMENT 73</page><page sequence="2">Review into catastrophic civil war, that he technically doesn't "exist" as a citizen, and that he must wait in the terminal for diplo- matic reclassification.

His English vocabulary reduced to a series of confounded yeses, Hanks's fish-out-of- water Navorski brings Spielberg's "little boy lost" archetype into a weary, suspicious world. A single drop of sweat caught in a shimmer of light as it trickles down his tem- ple while he awaits interrogation speaks volumes about cur- rent immigration restrictions and dehumanization tactics. However, as political reality sets in, the reality of The Terminars agenda comes crashing through. Sadly, Spiel- berg has less on his mind here than it seems - Navorski's decision to take up residence in his transit-lounge prison soon becomes fodder for a series of belabored slapstick gags; the palpable sense of alienation is summarily allevi- ated by a trio of reassuringly adorable multicultural air- port workers; and, finally, there is the requisite mismatched romance with a gorgeous neurotic stewardess (improbably gorgeous, unconvincingly neurotic Catherine Zeta-Jones, whose mechanized movie-star poses drag the entire project down to a soul-deadening level). Sorry, but this simply isn't the climate for Capra-corn.

The film's re- ported connection to the case of Iranian exile Merhan Karimi Nasseri, who lived in Charles de Gaulle airport for 15 years, is tenuous to the point of abstraction. While Spielberg has touted produc- tion designer Alex McDowell's mam- moth airport set as a tribute to Jacques Tati's Playtime , he cannot help but turn Tati's ethereal modernist construct into a high-concept jungle gym, a miniaturist exercise closer to The Sugarland Express's matchbox-car demolition derby than a critique of capital- ism. This vague homage - with Hanks as a bungling everyman innocent caught in an architectural whirligig, pratfalling and slip-sliding on modern (in)conveniences and staring slack-jawed at the imposing tableaux of reflective surface interiors - is simply too weightless to carry the material's political implications. Hanks's beady eyes and befuddled manner initially project a universal disorientation, a M. Hulot for the age of globalization. But as the plot kicks into gear, the film reveals its true colors: it's an update of Meet John Doe , with Hanks as Spielberg's Gary Cooper. The result is disconcertingly irrelevant. Of course, Spielberg's detractors will chalk it up to the usual conservative formulas, while the Armond Whites of the world try to recoup it as some sort of blissed-out pop- political fusion. Spielberg's uneasy relationship to Ameri- can history is what's particularly at stake here: his tendency to mix the true pain of human isolation with a constant clear-eyed belief in an ultimate good has proven most divisive in his depictions of specifically American values (1941, Saving Private Ryan , Minority Report). His masterful Amistad - with its protagonist similarly captured, detained, and finally sent packing due to U.S. governmen- tal loopholes - may have recuperated our country's mani- fest historical injustices into what is ultimately an overly reverent tribute to democracy, but his final shot of Djimon Hounsou's single tear brought us back to a past we should not forget. At the close of The Terminal , when Tom Hanks triumphantly emerges into a glistening New York City win- ter wonderland right out of Miracle on 34th Street , Spiel- berg again brings us to the past, at a moment when our eyes should be on the present. - -Michael Koresky The Terminal is in general release.</page></plain_text>
