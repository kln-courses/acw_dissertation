THE EXCAVATIONS . . . . . . 267-84 Fuad Safar PREFATORY REMARKS ROBERT J. BRAIDWOOD HE following report, dealing with one of the very earliest bulks of village materials in the Fertile Cres- cent, is of tremendous importance to our understanding of the beginnings of settled life in the area where, subsequently, ur- banization made its first appearance. The Tell Hassuna materials are a very signifi- cant addition to the raw stuff on which must be based our interpretations of the origins of civilized life in the Near East. In carrying on two seasons of excavation at Tell Hassuna in these troubled times, the Iraq Government's Department of Antiquities thus continues a program which keeps the scholarly world heavily in its debt.' Our knowledge of the earliest village materials of Western Asia, to this date, has been briefly indicated in a recent issue of this Journal.2 Essentially, the known materials seemed to suggest a sequence of some six fairly distinct prehistoric3 as- semblages in north Iraq; fewer in some of the surrounding areas.

The Samarran painted sherds in the Ninevite I context had to be accounted for either by stratigraphic intrusion or as the first trace of the incoming assemblage which was believed to replace Ninevite I. The latter alternative was favored, and it might have been postulated that, after an indefinite floruit of its own, the Ninevite I assemblage was gradually submerged by the assemblage of which the Samarran painted style was the most extravagant (and only known) part. The recent detailed consideration of the Samarran painted style' ended with this tacit assumption: that, while only the painted pottery, and a few flints from Baghouz, were known, a full Samarran assemblage must have existed and simply awaited rediscovery, whereupon it would take its place as the second of the North Iraq sequence. Following McCown,8 it was assumed that the Samarran painted style was Iranian. The remaining four of the prehistoric village assemblages of the Mosul region,9 while being generally confirmed as to se- quence at Tell Hassuna, did not occur in great quantity, so that we are not con- cerned with their details here. It will be apparent from the body of this report how the Tell Hassuna materi- als have vastly elaborated this tentative picture of the earliest village cultures in North Iraq, and also wherein they indi- cate how the picture was in error. Lloyd and Safar's report indicates the sequence shown in Chart I. 4M. Mallowan, AAA, XX (1933), 127-86 and esp. P1. LXXIII. Other claims of similar or equally early materials in the Tigris drainage await sub- stantiation; e.g., those cited by V. Christian, Alter- tumskunde des Zweistromlandes (Leipzig, 1940), pp. 91-95, as "Saktcheg6zii-Stufe." Tne Hassuna ma- terials now emphasize the misleading character of Christian's nomenclature when applied to the Mosul region. Mr. Lloyd, in correspondence, disclaimed any resemblance between the Hassuna materials and "Gawra XXVI" (cf. E. Speiser, Asia, XXXVIII [September, 1938], 536-43), on the basis of such in- formation or materials as he has available in Baghdad for making judgment. 6 This is no reflection on Mallowan or his methods; had his budget been larger, he would undoubtedly have opened more areas and have had more material to present. His Ninevite I pottery, as presented, con- sists mainly of painted wares, but includes painted- and-incised and simply incised wares; the latter is "the most important feature of Nin. I" (loc. cit., pp. 149-51, Pls. XXXV-XXXVI). A few sherds of "burnished ware" and "slip ware" are mentioned but not illustrated. The small objects consist of: crude clay lumps (found "in the debris of a hut settlement" [hence architecture?j classified as jar sealings but bearing no design (ibid., p. 134, P1. LXV: 1, 2, 5); a "dry clay" whorl (ibid., P1. LXIX:6); flint and obsidian, of which one characterless obsidian blade is shown (ibid., pp. 143-44; P1. LXVII:21); and the bones of pig (ibid., p. 179). 6 Ibid., P1. XXXV: esp. 2, 9, 13; cf. JNES, III, 66. 7 JNES, Vol. III, esp. pp. 65-69. 8 Cf. D. E. McCown, The Comparative Stratigraphy of Early Iran (SAOC, No. 23 [Chicago, 19421), pp. 35-36; JNES, I (1942), 437-38. However, in a letter of April 15, 1945, Captain McCown wrote: "My atti- tude is that we do not know whether Samarra, or its Iranian counterpart, is earlier, so we cannot say that it spread from Iran .... especially since we are with- out a nice series in Iran developing into a Samarra- like pottery." 9 As indicated in Table 1, JNES, III, 67; namely, Halaf (Arpachiyah variant), Transitional Halaf- Ubaid, North Iraq Ubaid (cf. n. 2 above), and North Iraq Uruk. In passing, it might be noted that the Oriental Institute has very recently received H. Schmidt, Tell Halaf, Vol. I (Berlin, 1943), and that there is now no question but that the type site also contains materials of the Transitional Halaf-Ubaid (cf. Amouq D) and of the Ubaid (cf. Amouq E) types, as well as the classic Halaf material.</page><page sequence="3">CHART I LEVELS STRATIGRAPHY AND ARCHITECTURE DETAILS XV XIV Disturbed materials, which include sherds of Assyrian, Ubaid, and Halaf type XIII XII Appearance of Ubaid type of pottery This range of floors appeared only XI in the small sounding, 2, on the crest of the mound, and in a connecting trench; total depth- X ca. 4.5 m.

We do not intend to ex- amine here the details of the various in- terpretations they offer but rather mean to indicate only matters related to the two major questions which we think the report poses. It must be understood that the points which follow arise from our general understanding of prehistoric Near Eastern materials and from such information on Hassuna as the following report contains. We have not, of course, been able to in- spect the Hassuna materials first hand; such being the case, Lloyd and Safar's opinions must bear much more weight than our own. In the first place, it seems less convinc- ing to us than to Lloyd and Safar (cf. pp. 262, 272, below) that the materials of the three camp sites of Level Ia are so separated from those of the Hassuna levels which follow. We are not necessarily inclined to see the "beginning of a well- defined epoch" with the first appearance of painted pottery, especially if the phrase has any implication of broad ethnic or cul- tural changes. Stated positively, we should imagine that the materials of Level Ia re- flect a parent-group whose descendants elaborated the assemblage into the form seen in Levels Ib-VI. This does not pre- clude the possibility that some of the new traits may be borrowed ones. Lloyd and Safar themselves indicate the possibility of continuity in several instances."1 The second major question posed by the Hassuna material regards the status of the Samarran painted style. Was this distinctive pottery ever part of an autono- mous assemblage of its own,"2 or was it simply a kind of "luxury ware" factor in the general North Iraq assemblage of Hassuna III-VI type? Our present specu- lations have left us uncertain as to how the possible relationships of the Samarran and the Hassuna archaic and standard wares might have been interpreted, sup- posing that Tell Hassuna had been exca- vated before Baghouz and Samarra. Lloyd and Safar, after considering the second alternative (p. 260), were evi- dently convinced by our, and McCown's, published arguments'3 as well as by their own assessment of the facts, and have considered.the Samarran pottery to be de- rived from Iran (pp. 265-66). Since we are now confronted with two painted styles which are not only contemporary with but even earlier than the Samarran style (at least at Tell Hassuna itself), we must urge the full consideration of the second possibility. It is entirely conceivable to us, for example, that some single group of (perhaps even traveling) craftsmen'4 might have appeared within the general North Iraq "Hassunan" milieu, develop- ing a very special style of their own out of the Hassuna archaic and standard tradi- 10o And, of course, with their interpretations of ma- terials from other sites, with which we also do not always agree, e.g., their interpretation of the Mersin materials. 11 E.g., the Level Ia wares are classified under "Hassuna archaic" in Fig. 5, and not in a separate column; the characteristic Level Ia straw tempered wares are said to persist "from level Ib upward," although with increasing rarity (p. 277); the idea offered that the profiles of "Hassuna level" grain bins originated in Level Ia jar forms (p. 268). It is our own opinion that the main lithic types are set in Level Ia, and seem to be continued. Apropos of Level Ia generally, we accept its ap- parent "neolithic" character, but again doubt the significance of a terminating "cultural revolution" marked simply by the appearance of painted pottery, and should much prefer what is implied by Childe's definition of the neolithic (cf. Man Makes Himself [1939), pp. 74-117) to that used here (cf. p. 264). The sustenance pattern indicated for Level Ia (p. 262) might include "farmers" if the recognition "hoe" is correct for the objects of Figs. 19-20, as Lloyd realizes. 12 As we ourselves suggested (JNES, III, 65 and passim) and as Lloyd and Safar imply (pp. 266, 281-83, below). 13 Cf., however, n. 8 above. 14 Cf. JNES, III, 64, n. 39.</page><page sequence="5">TELL HASSUNA 259 tions in painting.'5 Such a supposition would meet the points raised by Safar (p. 282) in favor of diverse origins for the Samarran painted style as against the Hassuna archaic and standard painted styles.16 It would also solve the where- abouts of the elusive "Samarran assem- blage" by making the Samarran pottery one trait of a developed North Iraq "Has- sunan assemblage," of which Levels III- VI at Tell Hassuna itself were simply one manifestation. Whatever may be the exact interpreta- tion of the available and the still undis- covered facts, it is clear that the full Has- suna range, Levels I-VI, yields the ma- terial aspect of an extremely interesting and important cultural milieu. In prob- able contact with, but differing essentially from, the earliest village milieus of both Syro-Cilicia and Iran, the culture reflected by the Hassuna materials must stand in an ancestral sense to the great Mesopo- tamian cultural tradition. For their ex- posure and presentation of it, Lloyd and Safar deserve the very highest praise.17 I. INTRODUCTION SETON LLOYD The modern village called "Hassuna," which houses about twenty families of Jabur Arab cultivators, lies five miles northeast of Shura and twenty-two miles due south of Mosul. The prehistoric mound (P1. I, 1) which takes its name from the village is situated a thousand yards due north of the village at a point where two small wadies meet and continue as a single tributary of Wadi Qasab (Fig. 35). It rises out of a shoulder of arable land between the two depressions, reach- ing a maximum height of 7 meters above an outcrop of limestone in the nearest perennial water channel. The entire area covered with occupational debris could be inclosed in a rectangle of about 200 X 150 meters. Half a mile farther down the same wadi and east of the modern village there are, on the right bank, traces of a consid- erable medieval Arab settlement with ruins of stone houses and, on the left, a second mound of about the same dimen- sions as Tell Hassuna with sufficient sur- face material to suggest that it represents a period intermediate between the prehis- toric and Islamic sites already mentioned. Where the Mosul track crosses the wadi there is a stone well still yielding sufficient water for the flocks of the village. Shura and Hassuna lie approximately in the center of a wide undulating upland, limited on one side by a gypsum escarp- ment which falls away several hundred feet to the Tigris Valley and, on the other, by the uncultivable desert of al-Jasirah. It is crisscrossed with wadies which carry water in the spring, and many ancient mounds of all sizes testify to the agricul- tural potential ivhich the winter rainfall 15 We find ourselves unable to accept the conclusion that the Samarra and Baghouz occurrences consisted only of the Samarran painted pottery, as is now re- ported. For an account of the developments of new styles of pottery decoration, cf. Ruth Bunzel, The Pueblo Potter (New York, 1929), esp. pp. 83-89. 16 Detailed microscopic analysis of the three wares involved here might be very enlightening. 17 We feel particularly honored to have been asked to edit the report for content, to have been in corre- spondence with Mr. Lloyd regarding Hassuna since the first season's excavations there, and to have had him accept several of our suggestions as to quanti- tative treatment, terminology, etc. Certain minor inconsistencies and typographical errors appeared in the manuscript only in its final checking; there has not been time to rectify these by mail, and they are indicated by initialed footnotes. Several short sec- tions of the manuscript, not particularly germane to the argument, have been left out, owing to govern- ment restrictions on paper for the Journal.

Both Samarran and Halaf sherds are well represented in surface finds from the district, and unmistakable fragments of Hassuna pottery were found by a mem- ber of our expedition on a neighboring mound much larger than ours.' Tell Hassuna was discovered in 1942 by Sayid Fuad Safar, M.A., when he was operating as Inspector of Antiquities with Land Settlement officers. The surface pottery was plentiful, and the collection which he brought back to the Iraq Muse- um included a large proportion of frag- ments similar to the incised ware of Nine- vite I as well as some authentic Samarran painted ware, including an almost com- plete bowl. There were several other Samarran fragments, of the type with in- cisions as well as paint, and, since the col- lection included fragments of the now familiar painted-and-incised Hassuna ware also, it could be inferred that in this mound one might study the evolution of the painted Samarran ware from the in- cised ware of Ninevite I through an in- termediate stage where both forms of decoration were combined. This theory in the course of time proved incorrect, but its stimulus was in any case small com- pared with that of the long-awaited oppor- tunity of studying a Ninevite I settle- ment as near the surface as one assumed this to be. Arrangements were accordingly made for a test excavation to be undertaken in the spring of 1943, and the work, which began on April 2, lasted just over five weeks. The results were so surprising that work was resumed in the following spring, when a second season of six weeks was brought to a successful conclusion on May 10. The total finds as they stand now seem to justify fairly definitive publication, and, unless in the future some particular aspect of the new material appears to war- rant further study, the excavation of Tell Hassuna may be considered closed. At the opening of the first season about one-third of the mound on the southeast- ern side was under cultivation (lentils). The remainder had a thick covering of grass and flowers (see P1. I, 1). After a careful study of surface indications we be- gan the first sounding at the edge of the cultivation about 20 meters southeast of the summit, and to our great satisfaction this subsequently proved to have been the exact center of a pre-Halaf settlement. During the following weeks an area of about 50 square meters (Sounding 1; see Fig. 35) was carried down through seven principal occupation levels (now num- bered from the bottom upward) to virgin soil, which was reached 7 meters beneath the summit of the mound (see P1. I, 2, and Fig. 33). After a meter of confused surface material including a rather large propor- tion of Halaf and Ubaid sherds, the first definite occupation level (V) was reached, with ruins of adobe houses and a consist- ent manifestation of a culture apparently identical to Ninevite I combined with a large proportion of Samarran pottery. Later in the season it was decided to check the stratification of the mound by making a trial pit (Sounding 2) 23 meters to the northwest (see Fig. 35). To our sur- prise this encountered successive occupa- tion levels of the Ubaid and Halaf periods and did not, in fact, produce a single sherd of Samarran or Ninevite I character until it reached a point 3.5 meters beneath the summit. This we took to imply that, at the end of the Samarran period, the occu- pation center of the mound had shifted northwestward (away from the confluence of the wadies) and that the earliest Halaf occupation had been beside and only par- 1 Since the excavations closed, sherds of both "Hassuna standard" and "Hassuna archaic" wares have been brought for our inspection from a mound called Tell Bayar in the Ain Sifni district northeast of Mosul.</page><page sequence="7">TELL HASSUNA 261 tially overlapping the mound which al- ready existed. The work of the second season con- sisted of extending Sounding 1 eastward and northward until it comprised an area of about 2,500 square meters (see Fig. 35)2 and carrying down these extensions through the successive levels already ob- served. Various circumstances made it necessary slightly to restrict the sounding when the lowest subdivision of Level I was reached, but this, as will be seen later, did not impair the value of the evidence which we obtained of the earliest settlers. In or- der to confirm our previous inferences from Sounding 2, we simultaneously en- larged it by cutting a trench 2 meters wide, linking it to Sounding 1 (see P1. I, 3). The interesting result can be seen in the section of the mound which we have now been able to draw (Fig. 33). Among the finds from Tell Hassuna, as is usual with prehistoric sites, the pot- tery contributes most to the historical picture which the mound has to offer. The best preliminary impression of our major results can therefore be obtained from a glance at the pottery chart (Fig. 5). The classification of the pottery for the pur- pose of this chart was greatly simplified by the discovery at an early stage in the excavations that, from the second level above virgin soil (Ib) up to the arrival of the Halaf people at Level VI, we were dealing with a consistent and extremely individual local culture whose develop- ment and evolution could be studied through a succession of clearly marked stages. Running parallel to this culture and surviving it into the lowest Halaf levels there was in Levels III-VIII an extrane- ous culture known as the Samarran, which was represented by ample ceramic evi- dence. From the first arrival of the Samar- ran pottery to its ultimate disappearance there was no perceptible sign of its style or material being in any way influenced by the indigenous Hassuna potters. Simi- larly, although Samarran pottery was evi- dently treated locally as a superior com- modity, there were only rare instances of any local imitation of it or of adaptation of Hassuna pottery to the Samarran style. The principal evidence for the extraneous character of the Samarran pottery is the existence and partial evolution of the vari- ous forms of Hassuna ornament before its arrival and its survival (presumably as an imported commodity) for some time after the indigenous Hassuna culture had been supplanted. The Hassuna pottery itself consists of what we have called "standard" and "ar- chaic" pottery (see Fig. 5). The former, which in its fully developed form occurred from Level III upward, can conveniently be divided into three classes: painted, in- cised, and painted-and-incised-all of which, curiously enough, were represented among the sherds from Level I at Nine- veh. The undecorated pottery in these levels has little significance. In Levels Ib- II burnishing was fairly general among the plain pottery, and the painted ware was characterized by the use of thick glossy paint or of mat paint on a bur- nished surface. Wherever deep soundings have been made throughout Palestine, Syria, and Cilicia, this phenomenon is common in the approaches to the neo- lithic,3 and at Hassuna we have provi- sionally designated such pottery as "ar- chaic." The two clearest lines of demarca- tion are between Levels Ia and Ib and at Level VI (see Fig. 5). These, in fact, mark, respectively, the beginning and the end of the local Hassuna culture.

Jericho, Megiddo, Judaidah, Sakje Geuzi, Carchemish, and Mersin.</page><page sequence="8">262 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES Level VII upward (occupations, of course, represented in Sounding 2 only) it has been entirely replaced by Halaf material, while in Level Ia, directly upon virgin soil, none of the elements by which it is char- acterized had yet appeared. The whole of the material from Level Ia has, in fact, to be treated as a separate assemblage. Apart from eight fragments of burnished bowls, one bearing a trace of paint (Fig. 7:1), the pottery, which is plentiful, con- sists entirely of a very coarse straw-tem- pered ware with a dark core. Combined with the flint- and stone-polishing indus- tries, this suggests that there need be no hesitation in applying to Level Ia the designation "neolithic," regardless of which current definition of the word is to be accepted (spe p. 264). Equal in importance to the technologi- cal results in the ceramic sphere is the so- cial picture produced by the excavations of the earliest settled community yet found in Mesopotamia. There is abundant evidence of the beginnings of agriculture. Actually, our first neolithic settlers left on the clean soil of the wadi bank evidence which suggests a society of herdsmen and hunters rather than farmers. All traces of their huts or other shelters had disap- peared, but the simple domestic assem- blage which remained in place around the ashes of their fires included obsidian lanceheads, sling ammunition, imple- ments for dressing skins, and a great quan- tity of animal bones. The only evidence to show that they sowed as well as reaped consisted of large stone "hand-axes," al- most always with traces of the bitumen by which they were attached to wooden hafts, probably for use as hoes in breaking the ground. Levels Ib and Ic, however, manifest a series of innovations which constitute an important first step in the evolution of an agricultural society. The settlers now live in adobe shelters. Again they break the ground with stone-headed hoes, but their flint-toothed sickles also are found almost intact. There are corrugated terra-cotta trays, which seem to us to have been used for "husking" wheat or barley, and sunk beneath the floors of the houses are great spherical grain bins built of clay, coated outside with bitumen and sometimes lined with gypsum plaster. Flour is ground be- tween two flat-sided basalt rubbing- stones, and bread is baked in clay ovens only slightly different from the modern Arab tanour. Furthermore, the potters' art has improved immeasurably. Com- paratively finely made vessels are now decorated with paint or point-scratched designs, and the main elements of the Hassuna standard style are already in evidence. There are even crude attempts to combine the two forms of ornament. By the time the imported or purchased Samarran pottery appears on the scene in Level III, the settlement has become a village in the accepted sense, and the adobe houses show the first clear signs of planning. Their rooms are usually grouped around or beside an open courtyard where the flocks could be inclosed at night. All through the so-called "Hassuna" levels there is considerable use of flint and obsidian. Throughout the entire 7 meters of occupational debris there was no trace of copper. Other minerals found in all levels included quantities of red ocherous paint, probably of the type used for deco- rating pottery, antimony, from which to- day Arabs make kohl for the eyes, and malachite, from which in Egypt the Bada- rians made a paste for the same purpose.4 Personal ornament seems to be confined to the simplest bead forms and amulets. Apart from a female face modeled and 4 See Brunton in Antiquity, III (1929), 456-67.</page><page sequence="9">TELL HASSUNA 263 painted on a Samarran vase (P1. XVII, 2), the only representations of human beings are crude and rather incompre- hensible unbaked clay figurines of the primitive "mother-goddess" type. At almost all levels we had the good fortune to find human remains. Infant burials in pottery jars beneath the houses were fairly plentiful. These were supple- mented by an undisturbed, orderly burial in Level Ic and an adult skeleton in Level Ia which may have been buried in orderly fashion. Two adults had been thrown ap- parently without ceremony into a grain bin of Level III. Some bones found in Level IV may represent a sectional burial. A preliminary examination of the animal bones has indicated the presence of toad, rat or similar, ox, ass, sheep and/or goat, possibly gazelle, wild pig, and hare (see p. 284). The post-Hassuna finds were limited by the size of Sounding 2. They contributed nothing new to our already extensive knowledge of the Halaf and Ubaid cul- tures5 but merely served as a most con- vincing stratigraphical check. It should perhaps be added that any- one observing these excavations with the broader view of the historian would have been, above all, impressed by the evidence here of the continuity of human life in re- mote places. There is little doubt that farming people of one race or another have lived and worked at Hassuna almost with- out interruption for close to seven millen- niums; and today, moving for a few weeks among the peasants of the modern village, we were repeatedly confronted by aspects of their life and even details of their sim- ple paraphernalia which have scarcely changed in that time. As we worked on the mound, the barley ripened in the fields around us, and on the day in May when the work was completed the local work- men returned immediately to the village to fetch their sickles. The harvest began with a tiny ceremony (P1. XXI, 2), and, as the long line of men stooped to their work, one saw beyond them the countless generations of their predecessors carrying the burden of human endeavor out of the mists of the past. II. HASSUNA'S PLACE IN PREHISTORY SETON LLOYD In an attempt to assess the correct lo- cation of the Tell Hassuna finds in the prehistoric sequence, a difficulty which confronts one is the equivocal character of the present terminology. The term "neolithic," for instance, has at times been most arbitrarily applied. The earliest levels, for instance, at Sakje Geuzi, Judai- dah,6 and Nineveh itself have all been placed in this category, while absence of copper provides negative evidence for treating the Samarran pottery7 and, in fact, the whole range of the Hassuna de- velopments in the same sense. On the other hand, in Palestine, Iliffe8 is so cau- tious as to group the whole of the earlier village cultures from the Tahunian up- ward under the noncommittal term "neo- 5 Any attempt to study the several stages in the evolution of the Tell Halaf style and its transition to Ubaid must await the publication of the University of Pennsylvania's work at Tepe Gawra. 6 [Not as yet by its excavators.-R. J. B.] 7As Braidwood points out in JNES, III (1944), 65, n. 41, the cupreous metal objects from the name- site cannot be admitted as evidence. 8 J. H. Iliffe, A Short Guide to the Stone and Bronze Ages (Jerusalem: Palestine Archaeological Museum, 1937).</page><page sequence="10">264 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES lithic-chalcolithic," while Childe9 even admits the possibility that the Natufian may more correctly be called neolithic. Perhaps the most interesting evidence in this respect is to be found in the lower levels at Mersin.10 Here there is no very noticeable division between the pre-Halaf painted pottery and what follows. Direct- ly beneath the fortified village at Level XVI (13.50 m.), in which Halaf pottery was found, there are 4 meters of settle- ments characterized by crude-brick walls and rather primitive painted pottery in many ways most surprisingly similar to our Hassuna archaic painted ware. But at 9.50 meters there is a change so com- plete that it undoubtedly represents an important migration or at least a primary epoch in cultural evolution. For from here down to the base of the sounding all walls are of stone, and not a single sherd of painted pottery was found. Garstang and Burkitt have understandably selected this as the line of demarcation between the neolithic and chalcolithic phases. But, whether or not it can be connected with any terminology at present accepted, it seems to us that this cultural revolution at Mersin may be safely treated as a point of departure in reckoning the significance of related material from elsewhere. In a word, since we are inclined to accept Burkitt's application of the term "neo- lithic" to the pre-painted pottery era as opposed to the immediately following phase, which he has designated "proto- chalcolithic," and since this Mersin proto- chalcolithic matches in so many respects our Hassuna archaic assemblage, we have equated the 9.50-meter dividing-line at Mersin with Level Ib at Hassuna and applied the term "neolithic" to the dis- tinctive society of our earliest settlers only. The archaic painted ware and the neo- lithic coarse ware from Tell Hassuna have, in fact, many parallels elsewhere, none of which need in any way conflict with such an assessment. Other affinities of the "ar- chaic" painted ware seem to be as follows: in the absence of Braidwood's final publi- cation of the Syrian Expedition materials, he has kindly informed us that in his new terminology "Amuq A" would correspond to Mersin "Neolithic" and "Amuq B" to the proto-chalcolithic at the same site."' We therefore assume that the painted pottery of the old Judaidah "XIV" period may be equated to our archaic painted ware. At Sakje Geuzi12 the buff ware with pink slip and red paint sounds unmistak- ably familiar. At Carchemish,13 Law- rence's description of painted pottery found at the 20-meter contour in the "citadel trench" seems to correspond. The painted ware of Jericho IX14 must be very similar, and the fact that it succeeds the coarse "neolithic" wares is significant. Painted pottery from virgin soil at Megid- do, illustrated by Shipton, who cites par- allels from the neolithic levels at Jericho,15 may tentatively be included, in spite of its occurrence directly beneath middle- chalcolithic material and Shipton's reluc- tance to date the stratum in which it was found (XX) earlier than early chalco- lithic.'"

The main technical feature of such ware is the use of mat or lustrous paint on a burnished surface or of heavy lustrous paint on a mat surface. At Hassuna almost always the clay surface is pink and the paint red (see pp. 278-79). As for the affinities of the neolithic coarse ware from Tell Hassuna, it is re- markable that in every case not only the fabric (see pp. 276-78) but various types of lugs also are paralleled elsewhere. Coarse ware at the bottom of Schaeffer's sounding at Ras Shamra18 (Ugarit V) shows mamelon-lugs near the mouths of vessels, and "ledge handles." In stage 2 of Jericho IX the straw-tempered ware has "knob handles" just below the rims of vessels. Shipton's coarser ware in Megiddo XX has knob-lugs. Lugs of the "nipple" type occur in the neolithic pottery of Mersin also.19 Plain lightly burnished pottery from Levels Ia-II at Tell Hassuna has obvious parallels elsewhere. It seems, as we have already said (p. 261), to occur in the ap- proaches to the neolithic at almost all the sites mentioned so far. Certain other burnished wares from the early levels of Tell Hassuna are worth ob- serving, particularly gray and black bowls sometimes with high burnish amounting to polish. We found hardly more than a dozen sherds, and the best examples oc- curred as late as Level IV or V,20 where they were contemporary with Samarran ware; yet they cannot by any means be ignored. Both black and gray types, after actual comparison of the sherds, are seen to be identical with such wares from Sakje Geuzi (see p. 278). This means that they may have equally close relations in the deepest levels at Carchemish, Ras Sham- ra, Judaidah, and Mersin, or even at Tasa in Egypt, although the impressed decora- tion in evidence at most of these sites is lacking. Nearer home were found two or three similar sherds in Ninevite I, others at Arpachiyah,21 below level T.T. 10, and Chagar Bazar,22 on virgin soil; while the dozen fragments of the corresponding "ceramique noir" recorded by Ghirsh- man23 in the lowest level at Sialk in cen- tral Iran probably constitute our only pos- sible link with the plateau except through the Samarran. Generally these highly burnished wares occur with much greater frequency to the west of Iraq, and, partly owing to their reappearance from that direction in the mid-chalcolithic, that is, "Uruk" period, it has become difficult not to associate them with modern Turkey. Among the early Hassuna settlers they perhaps represent the last remnants of a long tradition elsewhere and, combined with the character of the first painted ware, might be taken to suggest for our first arrivals a northwestern origin. It is strange how little can be said of the Hassuna standard pottery in its ma- ture form. We have already referred to its three main subdivisions in respect to decoration, all of which had already ap- peared side by side with the archaic pot- tery in Level Ic and, by Level III, could 17 AAA, Vol. XX (1933), P1.

[It is not clear from the publication that this pottery is burnished.-R. J. B.]</page><page sequence="12">266 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES be said to have reached maturity. We know of no parallel for the standard painted ware (which is distinguished from the archaic class by the invariable use of mat paint on an unburnished surface), except in Ninevite I, nor for the combina- tion of mat paint with incising. Point- scratched sherds of Ninevite I type found by Mallowan at Arpachiyah and Chagar Bazar and by McEwan and Braidwood at Judaidah, of course, invite comparison with our Hassuna incised ware. Generally speaking, we can only again stress that the aggregate of these styles constitutes a strongly individual ceramic industry, ob- viously vernacular in character and not demonstrably related to any known con- temporary culture. Its occurrence among surface finds elsewhere will no doubt be detected from now onward with greater frequency owing to our knowledge of its significance, and it is to be hoped that in this way some idea will eventually be gained of the extent of its distribution. The clear distinction which we were satisfactorily able to substantiate between the indigenous painted wares and the con- temporary Samarran pottery has already been referred to (p. 261) and will be en- larged upon below (pp. 281-83). The in- fluence of one upon the other is, in fact, negligible and calls for no special mention in this context. Since we are therefore able to treat this new Samarran occurrence objectively, it would be only proper for us to examine it in the light of the exhaustive analysis of the Samarran style which ap- peared in a previous number of this Jour- nal.24 Yet there would be little point in here checking the authenticity of our Samarran material against the repertoire of patterns and shapes presented in that analysis, since a single glance at Herz- feld's original publication of the type-site material is enough to convince one of the identity of our material.25 It is regrettable that Tell Hassuna cannot supply the cul- tural setting for the Samarran pottery, which, as Braidwood points out, is badly needed, since the setting in which it is here found must rather be identified with the indigenous society. The circumstances of the occurrence are simple. It arrives with the style already fully developed in Levels III-IV. A great many vessels show signs of riveting or mending with bitumen, which suggests that a certain value was placed upon them.. This pottery reaches its maximum frequency in Level V and disappears in Level IX, after surviving well into the Halaf period. At the time of writing, unfortunately, no copy is avail- able here of McCown's article26 in which the Iranian origin of the Samarran style is discussed. It seems unlikely that the new occurrence will add to or detract from his argument, since geographically Hassuna is about halfway between Samarra itself and Baghouz"7 and since it has contrib- uted no evidence of a formative period in the evolution of the Samarran style. In fact, if we assume that no further confir- mation was necessary of the position of Samarran pottery in the prehistoric se- quence, then the anthropomorphic jar neck found in Sounding 2 (P1. XVII, 2) is almost the only contribution which Tell Hassuna has made to our knowledge of the Samarran pottery style. 24 Braidwood et al., JNES, Vol. III, No. 1. 25 We do, however, indorse the criticism which these authors have leveled against the loose applica- tion of the term "Samarra" and commend their effort to prevent its perpetration. 26 D.

It may be mentioned here that surface material which would probably be considered true Samarran pottery has been brought to us from sites as far east of the Tigris as Kifri.</page><page sequence="13">TELL HASSUNA 267 III. THE EXCAVATIONS FUAD SAFAR GENERAL OBSERVATIONS During the entire period of the indige- nous culture (Levels Ib-VI) at Hassuna the only building material is adobe. The walls, however, improve considerably in symmetry and regularity in each succes- sive reoccupation. By Level IV the group- ing of rooms and sometimes even their special functions are easily comprehen- sible. The section of the village excavated at this level (Fig. 31 and P1. VIII, 1) can in fact be taken as characteristic and is extremely interesting (see p. 274). Bread ovens, hearths, and fixed stone mortars are features which give character to the various rooms and courtyards. Ovens appear as early as Level Ib (see P1. I, 2, beside standing figure), at which stage they consist of a simple clay barrel tipped toward the ground at an angle of about 300. By Level II they have become more spherical and roomy, but the fallen fragments in one example (P1. II, 2; see also p. 273) indicated that there was still a single opening through which the fire was laid and kindled, the ashes raked out, and the bread inserted. The presence of two or three "sling-pellets" among the ashes made one wonder if they had been used as pot-boilers. A rough clay "stop- per" lying on the top of the oven suggests some sort of venthole for creating a draft. There is little more to be said about the village architecture of Tell Hassuna. Pe- culiarities of building at various levels and details of adobe composition, pavings, etc., are discussed under their respective occupations. Apart from infant burials, no well-pre- served skeletal remains were found during our first season (1943), but in 1944 this important deficiency was made good. Be- neath the floor of Room 6 in Level Ic was an undisturbed burial which we were able to remove in toto and have now displayed in the Iraq Museum (see Pls. II, 3, and III, 2). The body was lying in a fully con- tracted position with the head toward the north, and there were no traces of any tomb furniture. Some measurements show the height of the individual to have been from 4 feet 2 to 4 feet 6 inches, but it has not yet been possible to determine wheth- er or not it was an adult. Three sides of the grave were formed by the foundations of the walls of the room, while the fourth was supplied by a row of large stones (see Fig. 28). The upper jaw and part of the cranium, which had completely decayed, have been restored for exhibition purposes (see P1. III, 2). An adult skeleton found in the first camp site (Level Ia) was slightly disar- ranged (see P1. III, 1). It is by no means certain that this was a deliberate burial, and an alternative possibility is mentioned elsewhere (see p. 271). If, however, it was a deliberate burial, a large storage jar near the head and a stone hoe which also lay among the bones could be considered tomb furniture. The orientation and per- haps the position corresponded to those of the undisturbed burial mentioned above. Two more adult skeletons apparently were flung unceremonially into a grain bin of Level III, one with the skull missing (see p. 273), while a solitary, crushed skull was found in a rubbish pit in Level IV. The only other human bones were found in two small groups in opposite corners of Room 4 of Level IV (see p. 274). There was no head, and it seemed unlikely that they signified a "sectional burial." We found altogether a dozen infant burials in pottery jars from Level Ib up- ward. Coarse ware, incised, and painted-</page><page sequence="14">268 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES and-incised jars were used. Plate XIII, 2, shows a painted-and-incised jar used for this purpose and beneath it a local imitation of Samarran painted bowls which accompanied the body. Sometimes a small plain drinking cup was placed be- side the bones. Perhaps the most interest- ing of all was the burial of two infants in the same tall-sided incised bowl in Level II (P1. III, 3; see also p. 273). The head measurements are consistent with those of newborn children after a normal period of gestation, and we at first assumed them to have been stillborn twins. Later, how- ever, the development of the teeth sug- gested that they had lived some months after birth. This burial also is now pre- served in the Iraq Museum. More than thirty circular grain bins were encountered during the work in the main sounding (No. 1). None was found in Sounding 2, a fact which suggested that they were peculiar to the indigenous cul- ture. With a single exception they were constructed of 6-cm. walls of fine unbaked clay tempered with straw. Outside they were heavily coated with bitumen, obvi- ously deriving from the mineral source a few miles away at Hammam Alil on the Tigris. In some cases they were lined with whitish gypsum. In the earlier levels (Ib- III) their shape approximated that of the coarse-ware jars of Level Ia (see pp. 276- 78), from which they probably origi- nated. The basin-like lower portion has a double-ogee curve to a small flat bottom (P1. IV, 1-2), and the walls of the upper structure curve inward to a narrow hole- mouth (P1. II, 1). The earliest example found appears at the left in Plate VI, 2. It belongs to Level Ib and is made entirely of gypsum. In the later levels the original shape was almost forgotten; carination had disappeared, and the bottom was roughly rounded. The grain bins averaged about a meter in diameter, though they occurred as large as 1.50 m. and as small as 60 cm. It was easy to deduce that they had invariably been constructed on the surface and then lowered into position underground with their mouths just above the pavement, since there was always loose filling (10-20 cm. thick) between their sides and the stratified debris around them. Hence they could not have been coated with bitumen in situ. Inside, decayed chaff and carbon- ized grain beneath a deposit of fine clay from seepage water often testified to the purpose for which they were used. Broken bowls obviously used as dippers some- times provided further evidence. It was natural to find that the bins had had an alternative function as repositories for rubbish. Large quantities of animal bones were not uncommon, and a bin of Level III contained two incomplete human skeletons. One need not look far to find similar devices for storing grain. Circular "silos" occurred in contemporary levels at Mer- sin,28 and underground storage is the regu- lar practice in the modern village of Mersin. The majority of bone implements found in association with the indigenous Has- suna pottery were points and spatulas (see P1. X, 2). The former differed in no way from the normal bone awl found in most early periods all over the Middle East, being sharpened and polished at the end only.29 Two examples, however, at the extreme right and left of the central group in Plate X, 2, were sharpened at the sides also. There is little doubt that their main function was piercing skins, though some similar tool must have been used by the Hassuna potter in decorating his in- cised ware. Spatulas were often pierced at 28 AAA, Vol. XXVI (1939), P1. XLI. 29 No traces were found of pierced points such as occur in the early levels at Mersin (ibid., Pl. XXXIV, 35, 36).</page><page sequence="15">TELL HASSUNA 269 one end, apparently for suspension. The example at the extreme left in the bottom row has a tang showing traces of bitumen which probably attached it to a handle. A single point in the central group has similar traces of bitumen, but heavy bitu- men "grips" such as were common in the Ubaid period are missing. The two chisels in the central group belong to the Halaf period. The shinbone above the central group has one cutting-edge. Since in our department there are no experts with sufficient experience to com- ment authoritatively on the fairly large quantity of stone objects, flint, and obsid- ian found in the lower levels at Hassuna, we have presented drawings and notes on the most representative examples.30 By far the larger number came from what we have assumed to be neolithic camp sites in Level Ia. These included the better- made stone hoes with a heavy coating of bitumen for attachment, many of the largest polished celts, and, among the obsidian, a magnificent javelin head (Fig. 22:9) comparable with those found in the neolithic levels at Mersin. With the first adobe walls sickle blades begin to appear in large numbers. Traces of the sickle- blade industry itself were found in an im- pressive domestic group in Room 17 of Level II (see Fig. 29), where some of the blades lay among the flint nodules from which they had been flaked. In the same find-spot occurred a large section of a complete sickle with the flakes still set in the original bitumen. They were not ser- rated but set overlapping, and upon the bitumen were traces of the wooden back- ing which gave strength to the implement. An even better-preserved example, found in Level III (see p. 274), appears in Figure 37, where we have attempted a recon- struction."1 The curve of the "blade" is determinable, but the method of attach- ment and the angle of the handle are pure speculation based on Egyptian hiero- glyphic and other representations. Plate XI, 1-2, shows a selection of beads, pendants, and other small orna- ments or amulets from the Hassuna levels. Beads are of simple shapes, and by far the most delicately carved and polished ap- pears in the center of Plate XI, 2. Tur- quoise is perhaps the most interesting im- ported material, as it is rare in early pe- riods in Iraq. Spindle whorls occur at all levels. They are of the usual double-cone shape, made commonly of baked clay, sometimes orna- mented with paint, and less often of stone. They differ not at all from those which characterize the chalcolithic and proto- chalcolithic cultures throughout the Mid- dle East. Symbolic clay figurines of the "mother-goddess" type take forms which reappear in the post-Hassuna levels. Com- pare, for instance, our examples in the second row of Plate XI, 1, and those of the Halaf period found at Arpachiyah.32 30o lit is interesting that different techniques pre- vail for the celts and hoes. These -same techniques carry on into much later periods in Mesopotamia. The celts are polished (afterchipping? and/or grind- ing?), especially along the working-edge; the hoes are only chipped. The hoes (cf. esp. Fig. 20:1) would seem to be ancestral to the Ubaid chipped hoes (see R. Camp- bell Thompson, The British Museum Excavations at Abu Shahrain in Mesopotamia in 1918, P1. VII:B; or the Uqair examples, JNES, Vol. II [19431, PI. XXIX, lower left). Chipped hoes also appear in Sialk I and II. The only one illustrated (see Ghirsh- man, op. cit., P1. LVI:3) is triangular in shape and fairly similar to the Hassuna example, Fig. 25:2, but has a more pointed butt and straight sides. The Sialk celts were also flaked but may be polished in addition. The Hassuna sickle blades (if the examples drawn, Fig. 23:2, 10; Fig. 24:1, 9; probably Fig. 26:15, are representative) are made on irregularly shaped blade segments or on flakes. In this, they differ from the sickle blades of other available early village assemblages (e.g., Judaidah, Mersin, Sialk), which have neat sickle blades made on small narrow blade sections.-Linda S. B3raidwood.] 31 This sickle as well as all the stone, flint, and obsidian finds were drawn by Mrs. Seton Lloyd. [In subsequent correspondence, Mr. Lloyd called atten- tion to the Natuflan straight form of hafting (cf. Iliffe, op. cit., P1. III). The straight haft is also present at Sialk (cf. Ghirshman, op. cit., Pi. VIII:2).-R. J. B.] 32 Iraq, Vol. II, Figs. 45, 46, and 47.</page><page sequence="16">270 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES Our largest figurine (P1. XVIII, 2), how- ever, is in many ways unique. It was un- fortunately poorly preserved because it had not been baked, but the "mother- goddess" foxm is easily recognizable. There is an unexplained excrescence on the left thigh, and one of the truncated arms is missing owing to a blow from a pick. The head or headdress was found in five fragments. Two of the fragments are suggestive of curved horns, each showing the impression of a reed which ran through the center to strengthen it. They are of greenish clay, contrasting with the reddish clay of the body. At the top of Plate XI, 1, are three sherds of a very unusual painted bowl. It was decorated with heavy thick paint in two colors-chocolate and pale pink-- on a mat cream slip. DETAILED DESCRIPTION32a A. THE CONTOUR MAP (FIG. 35) A survey of Tell Hassuna showed that the site is surrounded on three sides by shallow wadies which combine in the area mapped to form a single stream, meander- ing eastward to join the larger Wadi Qasab. Only the mound itself and the plow- land directly adjoining its base showed any notable signs of surface pottery. For the contours a datum point was selected in the stone bed of the wadi exactly north of the center of the main sounding (No. 1). The highest contour in the plan is 6 me- ters above this and encircles the flat top of the mound. This part had never been cultivated, owing to numbers of large pro- jecting stones, deriving mostly from the Assyrian occupation. The two soundings made in 1943 are marked in solid black, while the hatched areas represent the ex- tensions of both made in 1944. B. THE SECTIONS (FIGS. 33-34) Section CD represents the entire exca- vated area. A great deal of information about the sequence of occupations may be gained from it. Levels Ia-VI represent pre-Halaf occupation of the site, and the pavement line of Level VI indicates the shape of the mound at the time when the indigenous Hassuna culture began to be displaced by that of the Halaf people. As has already been mentioned, it shows that the center of the mound and therefore of the village was originally almost in the center of Sounding 1, but that the new arrivals spread westward, away from the confluence of the wadies, building a new village partly on the western slope of the existing mound and partly on the pre- sumably flat ground beyond. Such a phe- nomenon is extremely common in Iraq today, where hundreds of modern villages are built on the flanks of ancient mounds. At Tell Hassuna the later occupations were of sufficient duration to create a new mound whose center was some 40 meters to the west. In Sounding 2, Level VI (which occurs at the surface in the center of Sounding 1) is buried beneath the re- mains of at least eight distinct later occu- pations (Levels VII-XIV in section CD). Beginning at the surface their pavements slope sharply westward with the curve of the earlier mound (P1. I, 3) and then flat- ten out, until that of Level IV is practi- cally horizontal. A fifteenth occupation level is represented by a stone pavement just beneath the surface at the summit of the modern mound. If we judge by the pottery, etc., this is almost certainly As- syrian. One end of the Sounding 2 trench can be seen in section AB (Fig. 34), a cross-section of Sounding 1. Here the northward slope of some of the pre-Halaf pavements suggests that on this axis the section excavated was not quite in the center of the earliest settlement, which 32a Sections A, B, and C of this heading were written in collaborat ion with Mohammed Ali Mustafa.</page><page sequence="17">TELL HASSUNA 271 probably lay equidistant between the two wadies. An area in the center was left un- excavated below Level II owing to an acute shortage of labor at the end of our season. C. ARCHITECTURE SOUNDING 1 A detailed account of the architectural remains at Hassuna must begin with Level Ia, where, paradoxically, there were no traces found of any buildings at all. As already mentioned (p. 262), the only traces of the earliest settlers were pottery, implements, and other personal belong- ings grouped around the ashes of their campfires. The ground in the neighbor- hood of this domestic assemblage was most minutely examined for evidence of any type of shelter, and, though traces of woven reed matting were found in several places (Fig. 38), there were no post-holes to suggest huts. It has therefore been pos- sible only to suppose that tents were used, perhaps similar to the modern Bedouin beit esh shaDar, or some even more primi- tive type of weather screen which left absolutely no trace. In any case, their manner of living per- sisted over a fairly long period, for, in the comparatively small area where the exca- vations were carried down to virgin soil, we were able to distinguish three distinct occupational sublevels actually consisting of the residue from three superimposed "camp sites" (see Fig. 27). The first-comers pitched their camp on the clean water-borne clay of the wadi. The most prominent accumulation unit centered around an oval hearth (Fig. 27:14) in which wood ashes still lay upon a foundation of sherds and pebbles set in a kind of primitive cement (see P1. V, 1). A second, smaller hearth (No. 16) was perhaps used for some special sort of cook- ing. Between the two and beside a large pottery vessel lay a human skeleton with the bones only slightly disarranged (Fig. 27:17 and P1. III, 1). In spite of the prox- imity of the jar and two flint hoes (No. 15) which lay near the head, there were reasons for uncertainty as to whether or not this was actually a deliberate burial. Its orientation, like that of the burial in Level Ic, was to the north, and the posi- tion might originally have been a loosely contracted one; but its location near the hearths, on the original soil among a litter of domestic objects, does not preclude the possibility that this individualhad died unattended after the camp had been tem- porarily abandoned. There were half-a- dozen more pottery jars in the vicinity of the hearths, of various sizes but generally conforming to the shapes common among our neolithic coarse ware (see pp. 276-78). A miscellany of other objects included clay "sling-pellets" (No. 19), "poker- stones," and small boulders (Nos. 20-21), most likely used for pounding. Isolated jars were probably connected with accu- mulation units whose hearths were not located. In square D4 there was an irregu- lar hollow in the original ground surface which can be seen in section AB (Fig. 34). By the time the second camp (P1. V, 2) was established, the remains of the first were covered by about 30 cm. of debris. It seems likely that it is represented by a single accumulation unit. The most inter- esting group occurred some distance from the hearth (Fig. 27:5), which was a slight- ly sunken oval, roughly paved and filled with wood ash. A large broken coarse- ware jar (No. 7) was full of charcoal. Its fresh condition and the well-preserved organic form of the wood suggested pre- pared fuel rather than carbonization by age. A more complete but smaller jar (No. 10) was completely filled with the bones of toads (see p. 284). We were inclined to think that they had perhaps been used for</page><page sequence="18">272 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES food, until a similar jar, left exposed dur- ing the night, was found in the morning to be full of small green toads rapidly dying in the sun. Other objects include the jawbone and horn of a goat (Nos. 12- 13), flint hoes (Nos. 9 and 11), a polished celt in greenish stone (No. 6), and a neat pile of "sling-pellets" (No. 8). All these are illustrated elsewhere. The shape of a large jar found in square E2 (Fig. 6:13) is appropriate to Level Ib and was per- haps intrusive from above. The third camp establishment (P1. VI 1), 30 cm. above the second, also seems to be represented by a single accumula- tion unit, though the hearth must have been located beyond the limits of the ex- cavation. Associated with it was an infant burial (Fig. 27:1) in a coarse-ware jar (Fig. 6:12); a second jar, probably for water or food, stood beside it-a prac- tice followed in later levels also. Apart from the usual "poker-stones" and "pounders," there are a bone awl (Fig. 27:2), a polished celt (No. 3), a flat curved stone with traces of grinding on the concave face (No. 4), and a large stone roughly hollowed to serve as a mortar (No. 5). The notable change in culture above Level Ia has been mentioned elsewhere (p. 262). One important characteristic of the new culture is the use of build- ings with adobe walls. The earliest of these is a single room (Fig. 28:1) in Level Ib which was rebuilt with additions in Level Ic. It was poorly built, and its main significance is that it represents the earli- est construction yet found in Iraq. In Level Ic (Fig. 28) a greater number of similar walls and fragments of walls came to light. They varied in thickness from 20 to 45 cm. and were either straight with squared corners or roughly curved. They appeared to constitute at least three houses or units. In one the rooms were grouped around a recognizable courtyard (No. 16), and some had obvious junctions. Room 25 contained a primitive bread oven and a number of storage jars, mostly of standard incised ware, for food or drink. Room 20 contained another such jar and a stone mortar, but otherwise might have been the principal dwelling-room of the group. Room 12 and the fragmentary walls adjoining it were probably out- buildings. Room 14 was a small detached bake-house, and in the courtyard near by were the mouths of two circular grain bins. Rooms 20 and 23 were damaged by intrusive storage jars sunk in the ground from above. The single room of Level Ib was rebuilt and incorporated in a building consisting of at least three rooms. At the west end of Room 6, about 40 cm. beneath the floor, was a complete human skeleton (Pls. II, 3, III, 2) in a grave inclosed on one side by large -stones. The body lay in a con- tracted position facing almost due east and was unaccompanied by any kind of provision for the afterlife. Being better preserved than that in the first camp site of Level Ia, it was removed complete and is now exhibited in the Iraq Museum. The third building unit in Level Ic (No. 11) was unique in Hassuna architecture in that it was circular. The compartments into which it was divided, however, with their pottery, bread ovens, and heavy deposit of wood ash, give it an unmistak- ably domestic character (see P1. VII, 2). The principle of construction must have been a sound one, since it survived into the period represented by Level II. Throughout these buildings the floors were of tamped earth and ashes, unevenly laid as is usually the case with a previous- ly occupied site. It will, in fact, be seen that, as the mound rose in height, the floors of the houses developed a distinct slope which proved convenient for throw-</page><page sequence="19">TELL HASSUNA 273 ing off rain water. There was seldom any difficulty in tracing the floors, owing to the accumulating layers of ash. The walls were built of lumps of mud of various sizes in a manner approximating the local modern practice. Smaller lumps were used to fill the gaps, and the faces were smoothed. In tracing them, it was hard to articulate the individual lumps for three reasons: (1) the clay was tempered with fine straw or pounded scrub, but the lumps were not dusted with the same ma- terial as is the usual practice today; (2) the clay contained gypsum ingredients which tended to cement the lumps to- gether; and (3) the lumps were evidently not allowed any time to dry before being used. The walls of Level II (Fig. 29) were of finer clay and stood to a greater height (in some cases 1 m.) than those beneath. There was a slight improvement in build- ing technique (see P1. VII, 2). Greater lengths of walling appear, although the planning was not always clear. There were apparently two main groups of rooms. Rooms 1-4 and 7 with courtyard (No. 12) form a possible dwelling unit. Room 1, with a well-preserved bread oven in one corner (P1. II, 2; see also p. 267), was clearly of domestic character. In and about the oven were variously shaped "poker-stones." A baked clay "stopper" found on top was perhaps to cover a vent or inspection hole. A couple of "sling- pellets" had fallen or been placed in the fire and were baked hard. No trace of a door was found in Room 4-a phenome- non which occurred often in later levels and which led us to assume that such rooms were merely stores accessible through hatches high up in the walls. Part of the house was demolished by grain bins intrusive from a higher level. The second group of rooms is in no way self-explanatory but probably also con- stituted a dwelling. By far the most pro- lific area was No. 17 (P1. IX, 3), which, although it seemed to have no relation to the section of wall at its west, produced an astonishingly large accumulation of domestic objects. They included at least six complete incised jars and fragments of others; two large coarse-ware jars, one with saucer-shaped cover (cf. Fig. 6:13); a large group of flint nodules with a dozen worked flints and chips; several flint blades set in bitumen, and an almost com- plete sickle (cf. Fig. 37); at least five bone awls (cf. P1. X, 2); a pounding-stone, two spherical polished stone balls (cf. P1. X, 1), and miscellaneous stones; the horn of a sheep or goat and bones of small ani- mals; numerous "sling-pellets"; lumps of ocherous paint and other minerals; and knuckle bones. In the northwestern corner of the excavated area we found an infant burial (P1. III, 3) in a tall-sided standard incised jar accompanied by two vessels for food or water. The bones appeared to be those of twins (see p. 268), and among them was a tiny pottery cup for drinking. East of this burial were the remains of the circular building founded in Level Ic. The walls of Level III (Fig. 30) showed an intelligible plan. A large house with rooms grouped around a courtyard (No. 21) was separated by a narrow passage (No. 18) from another house. No indi- vidual room had particular character ex- cept No. 10, in which the mouths of two sunken grain bins showed in the floor and a large coarse-ware receptacle lay beside them. One of these bins contained two human skeletons (one with the head miss- ing) whose disposition suggested that they had been thrown into the bin with- out ceremony. The position of a beam which had spanned the room in the center was marked by a semicircular projection in each long wall. Room 14 contained a large coarse-ware milk jar with knob</page><page sequence="20">274 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES handles (see P1. XII, 2), and Room 16 yielded two complete incised jars. Passage 8 ended in a doorway with a stone-paved threshold, and adjoining the southern jamb was a pivot stone for the door-the earliest yet found in Iraq. Outside this doorway two unbroken standard painted jars (Fig. 2:5-6) were found in what might have been a deposit of rubbish in- truding from the level above. In the north- west corner of the sounding we found a clay platform with a grain bin on one side and a square recess on the other. Lying upon it was an almost complete sickle (see p. 269) composed of flint blades set in bitumen, with traces of the wooden back- ing which presumably was attached to a handle (Fig. 37). A 30-cm. deposit of trod- den earth and ashes in the houses of this level suggested a prolonged period of se- curity. Easily the best-preserved groups of buildings found during our excavations were in Level IV (Fig. 31 and P1. VIII, 1). They afford a satisfyingly detailed picture of the prehistoric village and the character of its houses. We clearly had parts of two houses, and their similarity in plan to houses occupied by Arab fellahin in the modern village of Hassuna eventually led us to attempt an imaginary reconstruc- tion, which may be seen in Figure 36, along with a sketch of the ruins made during their excavation. The more com- plete house comprises about eight rooms grouped around Courtyard 13. Five of these (Rooms 3-6 and 15) compose a single almost symmetrical unit which is worth observing carefully. If one assumes that climatic conditions in North Iraq in antiquity were approximately the same as today and that the materials available for roofing have not greatly changed, one is probably safe in imagiping that low- pitched roofs of branches and mud such as are today the universal rule in every village from Sherqat northward and Has- suna eastward have been so for an im- mensely long time. Furthermore, the unit mentioned above is exactly adapted to this form of roof, since the two pairs of rooms (3 and 4 and 6 and 15) are sepa- rated by walls which, if linked by a short beam across Room 5, would support the ridge. It is in this way that we have re- constructed the building, assuming at the same time that the wall between Rooms 1 and 17, on the cross-axis, has the same function..The fact that Rooms 4, 6, and 15 had no visible doorways is puzzling. Here again, however, one may easily sup- pose that they were stores accessible at a higher level than that to which the walls survived. In the southeast and southwest corners of Room 4 two small cavities cut slightly into the walls were full of human bones (without a head) probably belong- ing to the same skeleton. Whether these represent a "sectional burial" such as is often found in the Halaf period or whether they represent the unceremonial disposal of human remains is unknown (see p. 267). Some of our best examples of both Samarran and indigenous wares were found in Rooms 6 and 15 (Fig. 31:30, 42, etc.). In Room 15 there were also a large pile of sling ammunition and one fine long obsidian blade (Fig. 26:6). Room 5 had a well-made bread oven in one corner. In the doorway to the courtyard was a thresh- old made of large potsherds. Just out- side was an oval hearth and near by in the pavement a channel *which carried off rain water through a stone-lined opening in the south wall of Courtyard 7. Among the objects found in Courtyard 13 were a flint hoe (No. 55) and a fine painted bowl (No. 68). In the southeast corner there was a low mud bench against the wall. The unit composed of Rooms 10 and 11 is particularly interesting. In our recon- struction (Fig. 36) we have left it incom-</page><page sequence="21">TELL HASSUNA 275 plete in order to show the courtyard be- hind. Room 11 was much damaged by two intrusive grain bins, but its character re- mained clear. Three pairs of facing but- tresses must have served to strengthen the walls and to shorten the span of three beams for a flat or penthouse roof. There was an oven in one corner, a door leading to Courtyard 9, and another to Room 10. Otherwise the only object of interest was a small clay figurine (Fig. 31:32). Room 10 also had an oven as well as several stone mortars and a pestle. Courtyard 9 had a hearth, and the mouth of a grain bin was visible. Courtyard 7 produced some good pottery (Fig. 31:45, 50-51) and other objects. There is little doubt that Rooms 10 and 11 belong to a sepa- rate house which includes Courtyards 7 and 9, since rain water from Courtyard 13 drained into No. 7 at a point where, if the whole complex had belonged to a single family, there would have been a doorway. Rooms south of Court 13 probably be- longed to an adjoining house, the court- yard of which (No. 23) was provided with a hearth. Throughout these buildings the adobe walls were well built and straight; they were about 45 cm. thick and remained standing to a height of about a meter. Rooms 6 and 15 had been destroyed by fire, a fact which possibly accounted for the number of objects preserved beneath the burnt debris of the roof. Here for the first time some attempt had been made to improve the floor surfaces inside the houses. Rooms 1, 3, and 4 and part of Corridor 2 were paved with a mixture of clay and chopped straw, usually about 3 cm. thick. A high percentage of straw was also used to tem- per the fine clay of which the walls were constructed. The excavated area of Level V seemed to have been fairly completely built over (Fig. 32). A long unbroken wall running east and west through the center divided the buildings into two distinct groups of dwellings. In the northern group one house consisted of nine rooms clustered around a central court (No. 16). Rooms 7-9 produced a fine collection of Hassuna standard pottery (Fig. 32:52, 68-71, 73; e.g., Fig. 3:2-3). In the southern unit Room 2, which contained two grain bins, was possibly an open court. Room 1 had another bin and, in addition to a large milk jar with knob handles, produced a striking clay figurine (P1. XVIII 2; see also p. 270). Rooms 5 and 11-12 in the northern group and 21-24 in the southern group probably belonged to separate houses partially destroyed by denudation of the mound. One intrusive grain bin near the edge of the sounding measured nearly 2 meters in diameter. Here and there the floors were thinly paved with clay and straw. Almost the only recognizable traces of building in Level VI were the remains of a small kiln (P1. VIII, 2). Its wall, which remained standing to a height of only a few centimeters, was oval in shape with a door at one end. It was roughly paved with stone. A well-laid pavement of large flat stones occurred near the surface of the northern end of Sounding 1, and there were remains of a stone building which had stood upon it. SOUNDING 2 Sounding 2 consists of the pit dug in 1943 in the center of the mound and the trench (see P1. I, 3, and Fig. 33) cut in 1944 to link the pit to Sounding 1. The levels represented were distinguished mainly by the pottery which they pro- duced (see Pls. XIX-XXI, 1), but some other finds and characteristics may be mentioned.</page><page sequence="22">276 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES In Level V there were fairly equal amounts of Samarran and indigenous pottery.33 Among the Samarran finds was the remarkable painted jar neck with a representation of a human face, partly in relief (P1. XVII, 2). There were no walls within the area of the sounding. In Level VI there was an increasing preponderance of Halaf pottery. There were still no walls, and the most conspicu- ous objects were a very large bone chisel and a knife (P1. X, 2:19 and 25). In Level VII three adobe walls crossed the trench. There was also an unexplained round structure of the same material. There was a great quantity of fully devel- oped Halaf pottery, a very little Samar- ran, and what seemed to be chance sur- vivors only of the indigenous wares. In Levels VIII-X there was very little change in the pottery. It was practically all Halaf ware with some classical poly- chrome fragments. We found a complete large jar and a spouted bowl, both of Halaf types, in plain ware. There were walls, still of adobe, in Level X. In Level XII, soon after the first ap- pearance of Ubaid pottery, were the first walls built of rectangular sun-dried brick. The bricks measured about 30 X 30 X 15 cm. and were made of rather poor clay mixed with sand and ashes. From Level XIV upward the stratifica- tion was unreliable, owing to the proximi- ty of the surface. There were buried stones and the remains of a stone pavement, as well as some pottery belonging to the As- syrian occupation. There is little to be said of the traces of the final occupation which we found at the summit of the mound, save that at some comparatively late date this little eminence was chosen as a site for a soli- tary farmhouse or police post. The charac- ter of both the stonework and the pottery associated with it suggest that they were Assyrian. D. POTTERY In consideration of the great emphasis laid on ceramic results at Tell Hassuna, it seems worth while here to mention the method used in the field to classify and study the great volume of pottery found. As far as possible, every single sherd was washed on the site and marked with its provenience. Each evening the group found during the day was carefully ar- ranged and laid out flat in a sherd yard in the camp, while the more complete pots went to the workbench for provisional mending. It was thus possible to ascertain what pieces were missing and to make a further search among the loose sherds found in the same area. At the end of the season, when our schedule of types was complete, the sherd yard was finally re- arranged according to the newly distin- guished categories, and the group repre- senting each level was photographed. These photographs (e.g., P1. IX, 1-2) give one an immediate impression of the proportion in which the various wares oc- curred. Also, in order to establish this pro- portion exactly, the sherds were counted. The chart in which the results were tabu- lated (Fig. 5) constitutes one of the most important results of the excavation, since here at a glance one may see a complete34 classification of all wares found and the chronology of their occurrence. COARSE WARE The most important materials included in this category are the coarse straw-tem- pered vessels of the first, second, and third camp sites in Level Ia. Apart from eight 33 [Level V, and the ceramic proportions indicated here for Sounding 2, are apparently not included in the chart, Fig. 5.-R. J.

Furthermore, they occurred in very considerable numbers, as many as twenty- nine having been found in the compara- tively small area excavated. The shapes vary in their proportions though not in their essential character, all being, as it were, variations on a single theme. The basis seems to be a rather flat saucer or bowl upon whose rim was built an upper structure which either curves sharply inward to make a squat hole- mouth vessel (Fig. 6:4, 5, 9, etc.) or rises steeply to make a tall-sided jar (Fig. 6:1, 2, 7, etc.). The lower portion usually has a flat double-ogee curve ending in a small flat base. It seems just conceivable that our shape originated in a clay basin mod- eled in the ground, upon which an upper structure was built to increase the con- tent. 35 The ware itself seems broadly similar to the earliest found at Jericho.36 It is buff in color with blackened core and a generous tempering of straw, which, when left on the surface, has disappeared, leav- ing impressions in the clay. The surface outside is wet-smoothed, occasionally shows signs of a very slight burnish, and is sometimes mottled with tiny cracks (P1. XIII, 1). The tall-sided vessels usual- ly have a group of two or more "nipple lugs" on either side just beneath the rim (Fig. 6:1, 7, 15, 17). There are examples also of semicircular or horizontal "knob- ledges" (Fig. 6:16) as in Jericho IX37 and one T-shaped ridge (Fig. 6:20). Finally, there are examples of a dent in the rim for pouring (Fig. 6:18) and of a hole just be- neath the rim, perhaps for the same pur- pose (cf. Fig. 6:22, from Level Ic). The purposes for which these vessels were used seem to have been various. The more squat shapes were probably storage jars for meat, etc., but were used for in- fant burials also (e.g., Fig. 6:12). In one case a tiny drinking cup of the same ware was laid beside the body. The taller ves- sels, which stood up to 60 cm. high, were more in the character of milk pails or water coolers. One broken example (Fig. 27:7) was full of charcoal. There was some indication that the largest vessels had been used for storing grain, It is perhaps significant that later, when the possibili- ties of bitumen and gypsum had been realized, underground grain bins much larger in size but of essentially the same shape, with an ogee curve from a small flat base, were constructed (P1. IV, 1). The vessel appearing in Plate I, 2, had un- doubtedly been used by the first arrivals at the site, since it was actually sunk in the original clean soil, possibly for cool- ness. Beside it stood a simple cup of the same ware probably used as a dipper (P1. XIII, 1, upper right). From Level Ib upward straw-tempered vessels appeared with increasing rarity, and a new shape became common. This is a rather large pear-shaped jar with a turned-up neck (cf. Fig. 6:13); one of these (from Level II; see p. 273) had a saucer-shaped lid inverted over the mouth. Beginning in Level II, a new and most interesting coarsely made vessel (Fig. 3:8-10, P1. XVIII, 1) came into general use. This, for want of a better ex- planation of its purpose, we have called a "husking-tray." It is a flat-bottomed oval dish, usually about 60 cm. long by 40 cm. wide, with slightly outsloping sides about 15 cm. high. The whole inner sur- face is corrugated with deep grooves or pitted by jabbing the wet clay with a stick. One example was thinly coated with bitumen outside. Our suggestion that the purpose of these trays was for separating 86 Cf.

In the later levels, however, coarse ware was confined mainly to large almost vertical-sided oval vessels with lug han- dles (Fig. 3:7 and P1. XII, 2, right), to which we gave the name "milk jars." BURNISHED WARE The majority of bowls from the earliest levels (see Fig. 7) are burnished outside. The clay is buff to pink with grit temper or brown with a black core. The burnish- ing was done with a pebble over a light slip. It is sometimes perceptible from the texture of the surface only and creates little if any gloss. From Level Ic upward the slip is sometimes almost white and the rims are flattened (Fig. 7:21-28) as in archaic painted bowls. A carinated bowl from Level Ia (Fig. 7:1) has traces of a band of red paint at the rim beneath the burnish-the earliest example of painted decoration yet found in Iraq. Burnishing was sometimes applied to quite large flat- bottomed dishes (e.g., P1. XIV, 1:13, and Fig. 7:29). Two burnished bowls require special mention, although they were found in levels V and IV, respectively. One (P1. XIV, 1:9) is of finely burnished black ware such as was found in the "Neo- lithic" levels at Sakje Geuzi38 and other sites. The fine gray clay carries a heavy black slip, and the burnishing amounts to a polish. The other (P1. XIV, 1:11) has a smeary gray slip and is highly burnished inside and out. It exactly matches sherds from Sakje Geuzi in the Iraq Museum. A few jar sherds from the lowest levels (Fig. 7:17-20) also show signs of burn- ishing. ARCHAIC PAINTED WARE The earliest painted pottery from Tell Hassuna has such clearly defined charac- teristics to distinguish it from that of the later levels that we felt justified in calling it "archaic painted ware." Actually many of the designs persisted in later levels, but the technique is distinctive and easily recognizable, resulting, for instance, in an almost uniform red color for the paint. The clay is pink, buff, or brown and the slip cream or pinkish-cream. All the ves- sels are handmade. Apart from the almost universal tendency toward red paint on a pinkish ground, the surface finish is the most notable criterion. There are four separate treatments which can be de- tected by close examination, but they all result in a similar slightly glossy effect. They are (a) lustrous paint on a mat sur- face (e.g., Fig. 8:1, 4); (b) lustrous paint over a burnished surface (e.g., Fig. 8:5- 6); (c) mat paint over a burnished surface (e.g., Fig. 8:10); (d) total burnishing over a mat paint (Fig. 9:10-11). It can thus be readily understood that the archaic painted sherds are easily distinguishable from the standard painted ware, where both paint and surface are always mat. The shapes may be roughly divided into bowls and jars. The bowls vary from shallow dishes (Fig. 8:1-2, P1. XIV, 2:8) to deep, almost vertical-sided, cups (P1. XIV, 2:3). The rims are often flattened on top, sometimes creating a slight ridge around the rim (see Fig. 8). This never oc- curs in the later standard painted bowls, but occasional mat-surfaced bowls with flattened rims found in the deepest levels may be said to represent a transitional stage (e.g., Fig. 8:17, 22-24). The shal- lower bowls are sometimes painted inside with a centrifugal design (e.g., P1. XIV, 2:8). One fragment (Fig. 8:1) has a trace of some sort of leg support. The painted designs are usually restricted to a deep band of ornament beneath the rim which is itself painted. The bands almost always consist of opposed groups of oblique lines forming a sort of overlapping-chevron pattern. 3s AAA, Vol. XXIV (1937), Pls. XXIII, et seq.</page><page sequence="25">TELL HASSUNA 279 The jars (e.g., Fig. 7:30-31) are almost spherical with fairly tall, almost vertical necks. The necks usually are painted either solid or with reversing triangles of opposed hatching. For the rest the design is restricted to the shoulder and consists of a row of crosshatched triangles or of reversing groups of concentric triangles. Free triangular spaces between the cross- hatched triangles are often filled with large "blobs" of paint (Fig. 9:3) as in the standard painted jars. The similarity of the Hassuna archaic painted ware to the "proto-chalcolithic" pottery from Mersin39 (levels between 13.50 and 9.50 m.) has been mentioned elsewhere (p. 264). HASSUNA STANDARD WARES This pottery consists of incised, paint- ed, and painted-and-incised wares (see Fig. 5). In all three the shapes may be divided into jars and bowls. The incised ware is similar to that which predominated in Level I at Nine- veh. Its character hardly ever varies, al- though there is a wide range of sizes, from storage jars nearly a meter high to tiny carinated bowls. The clay is buff or pink- ish, tempered apparently with fine sand and showing occasional large white grits. The vessles are covered outside with a thin cream slip which extends over the mouth. The slip sometimes acquired a localized pink "blush" in baking. The designs were drawn with a fine point, pos- sibly a sharp flint or bone stylus which cut lightly into the clay. The drawing was un- doubtedly done while the slip was still wet, for the body was not exposed by the incisions, and hence the liquid slip closed in again after the point had passed. If the slip had been applied after the decoration was cut, the finely incised lines would have become filled and so disappeared. It is important to note that the decoration is almost invariably linear and that there are no traces of the "slashing" or "jab- bing" technique used sometimes in Samar- ran pottery. As is the case with all indige- nous Hassuna pottery, the vessels are handmade, and there is no indication of the use of any kind of wheel or tournette. Jars (see P1. XV, 1-2) are almost globu- lar with short, almost vertical, or, more rarely, slightly outturned, necks. Bowls vary from large, tall-sided, rather coarse, vessels of a type sometimes used for in- fant burials (P1. III, 3, and Fig. 3:5) to wide, shallow, sometimes carinated, forms. The decoration of the latter always con- sists of a herringbone pattern which ex- tends downward for some distance from the rim (Fig. 4:7 and P1. XV, 1, middle). The standard painted ware (Figs. 11-12 and P1. XVI, 1),40 which developed from the archaic, was still handmade, with a slight improvement in the tempering of the clay, and the vessels were fired at a higher temperature. The clay itself is still buff to pink, and the slip varies from cream to a more rare pinkish or greenish. The paint is rarely red, as it is in the ar- chaic ware, but varies through red-brown, brown, and dark brown to almost black. Bowls have slightly flattened or round bottoms and almost always plain rims (Fig. 11:13 and 15 being exceptions). There are occasional tall-sided forms (Fig. 11:8) such as are more frequent in the painted-and-incised class. Opposed groups of oblique lines as in the archaic painted bowls are still the most common decora- tion. Numbers of other motives occur, however, sometimes beneath a band of crosshatching at the rim (Fig. 11:3, 10, 23-24). Some ornament often occurs in- side the rim also (Fig. 11:3, 4, 9, 12, 17, 18).

Standard painted jars (Fig. 12) are squatter and have shorter necks than those of archaic painted ware. The necks are painted solid, with crosshatching, or with groups of opposed oblique lines. On the shoulders rows of crosshatched tri- angles or chevrons are the rule, again with round "blobs" of paint in the intervening triangular spaces (e.g., Fig. 2:3-5) which, however, are sometimes filled in solid (Fig. 12:12, 15). Two jars (Fig. 2:7, 10) have unusual characteristics which sug- gest that they are clumsy local imitations of Samarran jars. Two unbroken exam- ples are shown in Plate XVI, 1:2-3. In some ways the painted-and-incised ware is more distinctively characteristic of the indigenous Hassuna culture than any other, combining as it does the kind of point-scratched ornament first found in Ninevite 142 with some of the simpler motives of the Hassuna standard painted ware. It began in level Ib in the form of ordinary incised ware with occasional painted additions. At this stage the slip was occasionally burnished. By Level III it showed a fully developed combination of shapes and designs. The clay and slip correspond closely to those of the incised ware. Characteristic shapes and patterns appear in Plate XVI, 1-2. The bowls include tall-sided cari- nated vessels (P1. XVI, 2:2 and 3) and shallow forms (Figs. 9:27-28; 13:1, 4, 6, 9, 10-14) very similar to bowls of incised ware. They, too, have a band of point- scratched herringbone ornament beneath the rim outside, but painted decoration was added inside the rim. The ornamen- tation of the tall-sided carinated bowls is somewhat different. Almost invariably there is a crosshatched painted band be- neath the rim outside. Below this is an area of point-scratched herringbone (Fig. 13:18-19) or reversing triangles of solid paint and incised hatching (Fig. 13:7, 16, 22, 23) ending with a painted band at the carination. Another motif is alternate bands of incised hatching and reserved lozenges on a painted ground (Fig. 13:17). The most perfect unbroken example of this class yet found (P1. XVI, 2:2) is of pinkish clay with a localized pink "blush." The paint is bright red-brown. Beneath the carination are what appear to be two potter's marks. Painted-and-incised jars do not appear in any quantity until Level IV. One of the earliest examples (Fig. 3:1) is similar in form to the standard painted jars. In later specimens the body varies from squat to egg-shaped and the neck varies in height, usually sloping inward slightly (Pls. XVI, 1:6; XVI, 2:4-5). (The jar shown in P1. XVI, 2:1, is an exception to this rule and resembles Samarran jars.) As in the paint- ed jars, the necks are often ornamented with painted crosshatching or opposed groups of oblique lines (see Fig. 14), but here these motifs sometimes are varied by the addition of a band of reserved lozenges (Fig. 14:2, 10). The body de- signs, which seld6m reach below the point of maximum diameter, consist of incised herringbone, incised hatched triangles al- ternating with solid painted triangles, and painted bands. One jar (Fig. 3:2) bears a potter's mark somewhat resembling a bucranium(?). A large complete jar of this class (P1. 41 AAA, Vol. XX (1933), P1. XXXV, 5. 42 Of the ten sherds figured by Mallowan as "com- bined painted and incised wares" in Ninevite I and II (AAA, Vol. XX [1933], P1. XXXV, No. 21, and P1.

The bowl shown beneath it (P1. XIII, 2), which was found inside the jar with the body, is a crude local imita- tion of a Samarran shape and motif. SAMARRAN WARE We had the good fortune to find a num- ber of almost complete vessels of the striking painted ware first found by Herz- feld at Samarra (see Fig. 1 and P1. XVII, 1). This ware has been so minutely ex- amined both by Braidwood et al. in con- nection with the Baghouz occurrence43 and by Herzfeld himself that further de- scription is hardly needed, except in rela- tion to characteristics now found for the first time. At Tell Hassuna there is little remark- able about the actual ware. The clay varies from buff to pinkish or occasionally bright pink and red. It is usually medium- baked with rare instances where firing has been sufficient to turn it greenish. It has a rather thick cream slip with a mat finish. With one exception the decoration is al- ways monochrome, various colors occur- ring in the following order of popularity-- chocolate, red-brown, red, dark brown, brown, and black. The frequent combina- tion of red paint and pink clay suggests that the firing may have affected clay and paint equally. Sherds from a single pot have zigzags of alternating pink and choc- olate paint (P1. XI, 1). The shapes which occur at Tell Has- suna have been roughly classified, like the local Hassuna wares, as bowls and jars, but among the variations on these two themes most of the types found by Herz- feld are represented. (1) Wide bowls with outturned rims (see P1. XVII, 1, and Fig. 1:4, 6) are Herzfeld's Schiisseln; (2) the bowl shown in Figure 1:3 could be an ex- ample of the Fussschalen, since the ring base in the drawing is restored only from the marks of a circular fracture on the base; (3) a carinated bowl (Fig. 1:7) and three ordinary bowls (Fig. 1:5, 9, 10) are examples of the Ndpfe; (4) deep bowls (Fig. 17:4, 7, 34) are examples of flache Tipfe; (5) a wide-mouthed jar (Fig. 16: 20) is an example of the tiefe T6pfe; (6) a second type of wide-mouthed jar (Fig. 1:1) represents the Becher; (7) Figure 18:2 is a Topf mit kurzem Hals; (8) Figure 1:8 is a Flasche mit hohem Hals. In fact, almost the only relatively unfamiliar Samarran shape found at Tell Hassuna is that of the tall jar neck (P1. XVII, 2, and Fig. 1:2) ornamented with a human face partly in relief. This fragment is, as far as we know, a unique and informative pic- ture of a human being of this very early period. Particularly remarkable are the vertical lines on cheeks and chin which suggest tattooing and the dab of paint on one side of the nose which perhaps repre- sents a type of nose ornament still worn by women in North Iraq. The line of the eyebrows is emphasized with chocolate paint. The pronounced part in the hair is reminiscent of a much later, protohistoric life-size head of a woman found at Warka in 1939.44 In addition to the complete vessels, we found approximately 450 sherds of recog- nizable Samarran ware, representing about one-tenth of the total volume of pottery. Since in certain levels these were found side by side with the local standard painted and incised wares, it was at first natural to speculate as to whether the one was derived from or at least a local imita- tion of the other. By the end of our first season the following evidence was already available to suggest a negative answer to both these possibilities: (a) The Hassuna shapes and designs were already in the process of development in Levels Ib-Ic 43See JNES, III, 47-72. 44 Guide to the Iraq Museum Collections, P1. XIV.</page><page sequence="28">282 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES long before the arrival in Level III of Samarran ware. The latter arrived already fully developed, but, far from superseding the indigenous wares, it remained in a quantitative minority until Level VII, where the indigenous culture had been entirely replaced by Halaf material. (b) Frequent riveting of Samarran pots (e.g., Fig. 1:4 and P1. XVII, 1:9) suggests that the ware was regarded as a superior com- modity which should not be discarded. It is therefore hardly too much to assume that it was brought from a distance rather than locally made. In order to consolidate this argument, it became necessary early in the second season to range the two wares side by side and study their characteristics. It was then possible to reach the following con- clusions: a) In the Samarran ware the clay is better tempered and fired and the slip is thicker and more carefully applied than in the Hassuna pots. b) Hassuna shapes show far less variety than Samarran, and each has distinc- tive characteristics. For instance, almost spherical jar forms with fairly high verti- cal necks occur in both, but in the Has- suna examples the rim is almost always straight (see P1l. XV, 1-2), whereas in the Samarran it is slightly outturned (Fig. 1:2, 8). Jars with very short necks sloping inward (see P1. XVI, 1-2) are peculiar to Hassuna. c) Painted-and-incised decoration in Samarran ware is limited to jars with a band of such ornament on the shoulder. The incisions do not resemble the Hassuna point-scratched ornament but are always in the nature of "jabs" or "slashes" (cf. Fig. 3:6 with Fig. 18:14). d) The color of the paint in Hassuna wares is rarely red but varies through red- brown, brown, and dark brown to almost black. The rich, almost purplish, choco- late paint so common in Samarran ware is a rarity. The designs themselves con- stitute one of the biggest distinctions. Hassuna bowls are almost always deco- rated with a wide band of some sort of grouped hatching beneath a single nar- rower band emphasizing the rim. Samar- ran bowls have several parallel lines at the rim and a great variety of characteris- tic patterns beneath. Hassuna jars have a simple pattern of crosshatched triangles on the shoulder often with large spots of paint in the spaces between. These are never seen in the Samarran. The most common Hassuna neck decoration is cross- hatching, whereas Samarran jar necks al- most always have groups of two or three diagonal lines only. Finally, there is an instantly recognizable difference in the application of the paint. The Samarran designs are admirably regular and tidy. Groups of parallel lines are thick and straight and close together, usually with thinner spaces between them than the thickness of the lines. Bands of 'cross- hatching seldom overrun the limits of their field. In contrast, the Hassuna paint- ing is careless, with hatched lines not truly parallel, wide spaces between them, and crosshatching untidy (see Fig. 11:5, 6, 10, 16). As a result of all these differences, there was usually little difficulty in definitely allotting a specimen to one or the other of the two groups. Yet it has to be admitted that there are occasional doubtful exam- ples (e.g., Fig. 1:7) which combine some characteristics of each. These we were in- clined to class as local imitations of Sa- marran ware, since the Samarran potters would be less likely to bother to copy an obviously inferior technique. It is in consideration of all this evidence that we have assumed the Samarran pot- tery found at Tell Hassuna to have been not the work of local potters but a cornm-</page><page sequence="29">TELL HASSUNA 283 modity- imported from elsewhere by the indigenous people of Hassuna during the latter half of their sojourn in that village. HALAF AND UBAID WARES Except for a few sherds from near the surface in Sounding 1, these wares were found in the later levels of the mound represented in Sounding 2 only. They oc- curred in sufficient quantity and prepon- derance to establish incontrovertibly the stratigraphical evidence which we re- quired, yet in themselves they contribute little to our knowledge of the two wares, which have been so exhaustively studied by the excavators of Arpachiyah and Tepe Gawra. We have thought it best to postpone any detailed examination of the eight-hundred-odd sherds found or any search for evidence of the separate phases in the stylistic development of the two wares and of the transition from one to the other already detected elsewhere, par- ticularly because to do so in the absence of a final publication of the conclusions on this subject reached at Tepe Gawra would obviously be presumptuous. We have therefore contented ourselves with pub- lishing characteristic groups of sherds from each level (Pls. XIX, 2-XXI, 1). The chronological evidence provided by the frequency of their-occurrence may be seen at a glance in the chart (Fig. 5). ASSYRIAN POTTERY The late pottery found in association with the stone pavement and terrace near the surface of the mound has little bearing on the main theme of the Hassuna investi- gation. Some complete vessels were found, including a long-spouted lamp, and these together with the main sherd shapes were recorded and are to be incorporated at a future date in a more general corpus of Mesopotamian pottery. SUMMARY The cultural isolation of material found in Level Ia has already been referred to. The vast majority of the pottery is straw- tempered coarse ware. The only excep- tions are, in fact, eight fragments of burn- ished bowls, one of which has faint traces of a line of paint around the rim (Fig. 7:1). Both burnished bowls and coarse ware, however, continued to be found (the latter in slightly changed shapes) until Level II.45 The first acceptable examples of our archaic painted ware occurred in Level Ib, in which there were altogether twelve sherds. They are mostly rather thick, with heavy lustrous paint on a burnished slip; in quality they are most astonishingly like the earliest painted ware at Mersin (see p. 264). The archaic painted ware at Has- suna reached its highest preponderance in Levels Ic and II, diminished in Level III, and disappeared completely in Level IV. In the meanwhile Hassuna standard incised ware had appeared in large quanti- ties in Level Ib and throughout the next six levels continued to be far the most popular ware in use. Above Level VI, after the arrival of the Halaf ware, it dis- appeared except for chance survivals. The standard mat-surfaced Hassuna painted and the more elaborate Hassuna painted-and-incised wares were in Level Ic, already running parallel to the archaic painted ware, though the combination of paint and incisions in the early stages is hesitant and clumsy (Fig. 9:18-28). These two wares reached their peak in Levels IV and V, respectively, and ceased alto- gether after the arrival of Halaf ware. The Samarran pottery occurred first in very small quantities in Level III, reached its maximum in Level V, by Level 45Note, however, that the burnished bowl, P1. XIV, 1:9, and the coarse ware "husking tray," Fig. 3:9, are both from Level V.</page><page sequence="30">284 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES VIII was represented by nine sherds only, and subsequently disappeared except for occasional survivals. Halaf sherds were found in very small numbers near the surface of Sounding 1, in Level VI. In the same level in Sounding 2 they already exceeded the Samarran sherds in numbers. Levels VII and VIII were exceptionally rich in Halaf pottery, which continued almost to the surface. From Level XI upward, characteristic "North Iraq" or "Arpachiyah" Ubaid ware accompanied it in fairly large quan- tities. In the chart (Fig. 5) we have been able to inclose in heavy lines the levels in which the various wares can definitely be said to be represented. A single sherd of Halaf ware found about a meter beneath the sur- face in Level IV was at first disconcerting, but its significance was subsequently par- tially neutralized by the discovery of a second sherd from the same vessel at a much higher level in Sounding 2. APPENDIX I PRELIMINARY REPORT ON ANIMAL BONES46 BY THE BIOLOGICAL SECTION OF THE ROYAL IRAQI HOSPITAL It is possible to say with reasonable certainty that among the remains are those of the following animals: Toads.-Many fairly well-preserved vertebrae and other bones, the frontal parietals and sacral vertebrae being typical. Rat or close relative.-Complete left innomina- tum. This should be readily identifiable with modern specimens available for comparison. It should be borne in mind that rats are burrowing animals and that the bone might be of later date than that indicated by stratification. Hare.-Firm fragment of a femur only. Sheep and/or goat.-Goat or sheep remains were among the most numerous and, according to the Veterinary Department, cannot be easily separated. Some of the smaller bones of this type might be gazelle. Wild pig.-Several good fragments of skulls with teeth. Ox.-A few teeth. Ass.-The head of a tibia bone bearing close resemblance to that of a modern donkey. It is highly probable that herds of Mesopotamian wild ass roamed the area in early times. Other animals may be represented, but it would be necessary to go through the collection with a complete series of modern bones for com- parison. APPENDIX II REPORT BY THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAQ CHEMICAL LABORATORY The following are the results of tests on the exhibits obtained by us: Specimen labeled "Clinker from Hearth in Level III." This specimen consists largely of silicaceous material with traces of carbon. A little calcium carbonate is present. No soluble potash salts remain, bUt this might be expected, as the specimen appears to have been leached with water. Specimen labeled "Paint(?) from Levels III and V." The material is largely a natural iron oxide (Fe203). Specimen labeled "Paint(?) from Level Ic." The material is largely a natural iron oxide (Fe203). Specimen labeled "Red Ocher from Level lb." This is similar to the two preceding specimens. Specimen labeled "Metal(?) from Level Ia." This is galena, the black sulphide of lead. It is today used as a substitute for stibnite, black antimony sulphide (kohl), in the pigment used round the eyes. This material is very dense and heavy (s.g. 7) and may have moved downward considerably. A geologist's opinion as to a near source would be interesting. Specimens labeled "Traces of Metal." In all 46 [In Mr. Lloyd's letter of April 10, 1945, we were informed that, while exact proveniences were not kept for the unworked bone, the specimens all come "from true 'Hassuna' occupation" levels. Cf. also the goat horn in the second camp site of Level Ia, p. 272.-R. J. B.]</page><page sequence="31">TELL HASSUNA 285 cases these consist of natural basic carbonate of copper (malachite). We have searched for any trace of free metal therein, but none has been found. I am of the opinion that this material could not have been derived by corrosion of metal fragments. APPENDIX III REPORT ON SPECIMENS SUBMITTED TO THE IRAQ GOVERNMENT GEOLOGIST Specimen 1.-Level IV. A large yellow sample weighing about 1 kilogram. This is an admixture of limonite (yellow ocher), i.e., 2Fe203.3H20, and gypsum sand in about equal proportions. Traces of quartz sand are present. A good smooth ocher is obtained by simple washing and decanting. This sample recalls limonitic sandy alluvium occurring in small patches in the Fatha (Tigris) gorge 110 km. south of Shura. There might be similar deposits in the Qaiyara-Hammam Alil district, but we have no specific record. The Fatha gorge is chiefly remarkable for some seep- ages of crude oil, bitumen, and sulphurated hydrogen and for impregnation of sulphur in alabaster (gypsum). The sulphur is sometimes associated with limonite. PAINTS FROM DIFFERENT LEVELS Specimen 2a.-Green material of crystalline- radiating fibrous structure. This looks like and is malachite (basic copper carbonate, CuCO3. Cu(OH)2). It is associated with quartz and some limonite. Traces of copper carbonate are recorded from the Tuz Khurmatu district (no nearer locality is likely) and from Ora. Tuz Khurmatu is 100 km. from Shura. Specimen 2b.-A small yellow specimen. This is native granular gypsum heavily stained with limonite. It is analogous with Specimen 1 and probably from the same locality. Specimen 2c.-A small specimen of pale-pink brick color. This gives reactions for hematite (ferric oxide, Fe2O3) in high proportion, gypsum in fairly large quantities, and lesser amounts of dolomite (MgCo3.aCaCO3). It is fairly hard, though silica-free, and is amenable to grinding. The pale-pink color is the natural result of dilu- tion of hematite with two white constituents, and this is probably a natural rock fragment. Dolomite is a common constituent of Kurdish limestones; proportions of this magnesium car- bonate constituent are present throughout more than 1,000 feet of limestones and marls near Fatha, and therefore there is nothing improbable about the derivation of this fragment from the same neighborhood. There must be possible localities in a belt of country of great length, west of and roughly parallel with the Euphrates, but the distances involved make them less important. Specimen 2d.-Of the four samples which fol- low, only this one is now soft enough to allow color to be rubbed off freely on to brick, pottery, or similar hard material. The shape and the smoothed surface of this fragment suggest that it may have been so used. The color is brick-red, and the principal constituent is hematite. Exami- nation with a lens shows it to be a somewhat unhomogeneous mixture of several shades of -red, one of them a less common magenta tint (cf. Specimen 2g). Particles of gypsum are numerous, having a dehydrated appearance, and there are traces of carbonized plant remains. This seems to be artist material not perhaps in the untouched state of natural ocher. It may have been exposed to fire accidentally or by design. Specimens 2e-f.-Two more somewhat brick- like (red) fragments, f being darker than e. They are hard but could be ground for pigment, such grinding being quite usual. The hardening might be secondary, owing to the setting of gypsum on taking up water after partial dehydration. There are some carbonized plant remains, which may indicate firing. Since g can be matched at Fatha and since there is a family resemblance between d, e, f, and g, all may have come from the same place. Specimen 2g.-This specimen has a somewhat magenta tint. This shade is met in the range of colors in deposits stained with iron oxide but is less common. Traces have been noticed round a spring with sulphurated hydrogen at Fatha. Specimen 3.-This specimen suggests modi- fication of natural red ocher (hematite) resulting from grinding and probably washing and de- canting, the fine material being allowed to settle from suspension. It shows under a lens a very delicate laminated structure.</page><page sequence="32">286 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES Conclusions.-Fatha gorge is a likely source of the iron pigments and Tuz Kharmatu of the copper (green). Other known sources for such materials are less likely in view of the much greater distances. Iroi oxides come from north of Rutna, east of Ser Amadia and Jebel Sanam (south of Basra); copper carbonates from Ora in northern Iraq on the Turkish frontier.
