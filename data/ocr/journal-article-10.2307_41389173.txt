<plain_text><page sequence="1">Listening Otherwise, Music Miniaturized: A Different Type of Question about Revolution Rey Chow Hong Kong 1990: a place caught in post-colonial nostalgia, the simulacra of late capitalist technological advancement , the terror of communist takeover in barely seven years , the continual influx of un- wanted refugees , the continual outflow of prized citizens. Hardly a second goes by without some commercial transaction taking place. "Merchandise for emigration " becomes the mainstay of many stores , which are chroni- cally offering "sales. 99 Who are the oppressed of this place? There are many. They are faceless , voiceless , living in refugee camps , housing estates , rented rooms , rented beds, and other unknown corners of the overcrowded colony. Inside the packed spaces of the working city, the oppressed one most commonly encounters are the keepers of ubiquitous department stores and supermarkets - bored, unpleasant, expressionless, unhelpful salesmen and women, earning minimum wages, doing hardly anything day in and day out. These "sales specialists 99 neither make, finance, nor earn profit from the merchandise they sell. To that extent they have a similar relationship to the merchandise as the buyer /consumer - with one significant difference: once the transaction is over the buyer/consumer can leave, while the sales specialists are stuck in their jobs and their boredom forever. What accompanies them is the eternal Muzak in the stores, or, if they are lucky, they might be able to listen to their Walkmans secretly once in a while. In response to the imperative to give everyone "a voice," it is now a trend to raise the question "Who speaks?" in the investigations of oppressed peoples. Versions of this question</page><page sequence="2">130 Discourse 13.1 include "Can X speak?," "What does it mean to speak?," "Who has been silenced?," "How to speak?," and so forth. These are questions of linguistics and narratology applied to issues of power. In one respect, such questions are based on the assump- tions of classical - what some might call "vulgar" - Marxism: superstructure (speaking) on top, infrastructure (economic privilege) at the bottom. I want to clarify at the outset that I have no problem with vulgar Marxism as such. For all the attacks it receives, the vulgar Marxist refusal to let go of the strategic role of economics in shaping social vocal structures continues to yield some of the most powerful (!) results of cultural criticism to date. But while it effectively raises our consciousness in regard to the privileged positions enjoyed by those who are economically successful, the question "Who speaks?" tends to remain useless in its capacity to change existing economic power relations. This is because the posing of the question itself is already a form of privilege, mostly affordable for those who can stand apart and view the world with altruistic concern. The question that this question cannot ask, since it is the condition of its own possibility, is the more fundamental one of the inequality between theory - the most sophisticated speaking instance, one might say - and the oppressed. Like anthropologists, medical doctors, zoological re- searchers, and their like, theorists need "objects" to advance their careers. The current trend is for theorists in the humanities to discover objects of oppression for the construction of a guilt- tripping discourse along the lines of "Who speaks?" and thus win for themselves a kind of moral and/ or rhetorical victory. Strictly speaking, we are not only living in the age of "traveling theories" and "traveling theorists," as the topic of a recent issue of ajournai indicates,1 but also of portable oppressions and portable oppressed objects. Our technology - including the technology that is the academic conference, the visual and aural aids with which we present our "objects," the field trips we take for interviewing and for archeological purposes of every kind - is what makes portability, a result of mechanization whose effects far exceed the personal mobility of speaking humans, an inherent part of "voices," even though this portability is often ignored in our theorizing. The problem with the question "Who speaks?," then, is that it is still trying to understand the world in the form of a coherent narrative grammar, with an identifiable (anthropomorphic) sub- ject for every sentence. The emphasis of the question is always on "who." From that it follows that "Who speaks?" is a rhetorical</page><page sequence="3">Fall-Winter 1 990-91 131 question, with predetermined answers which, however, cannot change the structure of privilege against which it is aimed. Obviously, it is those who have power who speak - this is the answer this question is meant to provoke. What if we were to attempt another type of question, one that is not centered on 1) the act of speaking and 2) the quest for a grammatical subject? How might the issue of oppression be approached? This brings us back to the scenario with which I began this essay. In Asian cities like Hong Kong, where oppres- sion is multifarious and contradictory in nature, the question to ask, it seems to me, is rather: what are the forms of surplus? Further, how does surplus inhabit the emotions? What is the relationship between surplus, the emotions, and the portability of oppression? What plays? I will lodge these questions in the realm of contemporary Chinese popular music. The Collective and the Composite Any attempt to construct a discourse about contemporary Chinese popular music needs to come to terms with the fact that many linguistically determined senses of "discourse" do not work. One can even say that much of this music is about the inability or the refusal to articulate and to talk. This is not simply because humans are, after all, animals that cannot be defined by their speech alone. It is also because inarticulateness is a way of combatting the talking function of the state, the most articulate organ that speaks for everyone. When you listen to the songs by mainland China's young singers such as Cui Jian, you'll find that they are lively, Western- ized, and full of the kind of physical, rhythmic quality that we associate with rock music. Cui Jian's music poses a familiar problem about the emotions involved in our listening - the problem of physicality. Adorno has warned us against such physicality: "The physical aspect of music ... is not indicative of a natural state - of an essence pure and free of all ideology - but rather it accords with the retrogression of society."2 The diatribe of retrogression is a formidable heirloom in the house of popular cultural theories. But treasures of the past are most valuable when they are pawned for more pressing needs of the present. If the physicality of a particular music is indeed retrogressive, we need to ask why.</page><page sequence="4">1 32 Discourse 13.1 Contemporary popular Chinese music raises many issues similar to those of rock-and-roll in the West. Foremost among these is that of the music's critical function in regard to the dominant culture. Any consideration of popular cultural forms confronts questions like the following: if such forms provide alternative practical consciousnesses to the dominant ideology,3 are the modes of subversion and resistance in them not infinitely reabsorbed by the dominant culture? Are such forms capable of maintaining their autonomy? Furthermore, how do we come to grips with such practical consciousnesses when that category indispensable to traditional Marxist social analysis - class - seems no longer adequate in mapping the cultural differentia- tions that persist beyond class distinctions? Take the example of American popular music. For many critics, the problem posed by this music is how to locate in it a genuinely oppositional function when class distinctions in the United States are more often elided than clearly defined. One might say that it is the impossibility of identifying any distinct class struggle - and with that, the impossibility of legitimizing the notion of class struggle itself for social criticism - that in part accounts for Adorno's reading of American popular music as a massive numbing. The blurring of class distinctions - as reflected in "easy listening" music - is inordinately discomforting for the sober Frankfurt School critic. The disappearance of the category of class struggle, which is inherent to the old distinction between high culture and mass or commercial culture, is a point argued by Fredric Jameson.4 Following Jameson, Katrina Irving writes: "The op- position of highbrow and lowbrow with its in-built notion of hierarchy is eliminated, and yet another site of difference around which a counter-hegemonic discourse might have been articu- lated is removed."5 It is, thus, when we focus on what still remains for many as an indispensable category in social criticism - class struggle - that contemporary Chinese popular music, despite its resonan- ces with Western popular music, poses the greatest enigma. China is a "Third World" nation, and yet where do we find the expression of class struggle in its popular cultural forms these days? Instead of exhibiting the classic "symptom" of a "Third World" nation in the form of an obsession with "class," contem- porary Chinese popular culture "speaks" a different language of "oppressed" emotions. In the realm of music, we find the conscious adoption of Western models of rhythm, instrumen- tality, recording, and modes of distribution for the production of discourses which are non-Western in the sense of an inattentiveness</page><page sequence="5">Fall-Winter 1 990-91 133 to class struggle. Many of the motifs that surface in contemporary Chinese popular music, like their counterparts in fiction, television, and film, can be described as individualist and populist - troublesome terms for Western Marxists who at one point looked to Communist China for its Utopian aspirations. Such motifs are surfacing at a time when the mainland Chinese official ideology is still firmly "communist." Therefore, while the perception of class is undoubtedly present in the subversive emotions of contemporary Chinese popular music, it is present less as an agency for struggle than as the disciplinary cliché of the dominant culture to be struggled against This is precisely because "class struggle" has been lived through not merely in the form of critical talk but also in everyday experience, as official ideology and national culture. (In mainland China, "struggle" is a transitive verb, an act one performs directly on another: thus, "to struggle someone.") Speaking of his inability to deal with the directly political, Roland Barthes says (in an interview): "these days a discourse that is not impassioned can't be heard, quite simply. There's a decibel threshold that must be crossed for discourse to be heard."6 Barthes's statement offers us a way of defining "dominant" culture in musical terms, not only as that which crosses a particular decibel threshold as a rule, but also as that which collectivizes and mobilizes with its particularly loud, in- deed deafening, decibel level. If revolution is, among other things, a technology of sound, then its mode of implementation is that of mechanized and institutionalized recording, repetition, and simplification. As early as 1928, the Chinese writer and critic Mao Dun used the technology of sound in a discussion of "proletarian literature" to indicate the danger of the new politi- cal orthodoxy which based its moves on prescriptive slogans: "I . . . cannot believe that making oneself into a gramophone shouting 'This is the way out, come this way! ' has any value or can leave one with an easy conscience. It is precisely because I do not wish to stifle my conscience and say things I do not believe . . . that I cannot make the characters in my novelette [Pursuit] find a way out."7 The past forty years of Chinese communism can be described as a history in which class struggle is used as the foundation for the official culture of a nation state. The question "Who speaks?" underlies the most brutal of political exterminations. The "who" that is identified through arrests, purges, and murders as the landlords, capitalists, and running dogs is replaced with the "who" that is "the people." Entwined with nationalism and</page><page sequence="6">134 Discourse 13.1 patriotism, and strategically deployed by the state, "the people's speech" that supposedly results from successful class struggle forms the cadences of a sonorous music. One thinks of pieces such as the "International Song," "Dongfanghong" (The east is red), "Meiyou gongchandang meiyou xin zhongguo" (There would be no new China without the Communist Party), and many others that are standardized for official celebrations to invoke patriotic sentiments. Official state culture champions an irresistible grid of emotions that can be defined by Susan Stewart's notion of "the gigantic," which "we find ... at the origin of public and natural history."8 Gigantic emotions are the emotions of reverence, dedication, discipline, and nostalgia, all of which have to do with the preservation of history as it ought to be remembered. Such an institution of memory is, in the words of Friedrich Kittler, "an act of sheer and external violence."9 In a Third World nation whose history is charac- terized by a struggle against imperialism as well as internal turmoil, the history that "ought to be remembered" is the history of the successful collectivization of the people for the establishment of a national community. Many examples of contemporary Chinese popular music, however, follow a very different trajectory of sound. Here, the question about popular cultural form is not a question of its ultimate autonomy from the official culture - since that official culture is omnipresent - but how, against the single audible decibel level amplified at random with guns and tanks, popular music strikes its notes of difference. The words of one of Cuijian's most popular songs, "Rock and Roll on the Road of the New Long March," allude to one of the founding heroic events of the Chinese communist state, the Long March to Yanan. The last few lines go as follows: What should I say, what should I do, in order to be the real me How should I play, how should I sing, in order to feel great I walk and think of snowy mountains and grasslands I walk and sing of Chairman Mao Oh! one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. By recalling the words, I don't mean to imply that the truth of Cui Jian's music lies in its verbal content. Rather, the disjunctur- ing of words from music points to the significance of the partial - of emotions as partializing rather than totalizing activities which jar with the symphonic effects of official culture.</page><page sequence="7">Fall-Winter 1 990-91 135 There is, first of all, the difference between the "decadence" of the music and the "seriousness" of the subject matter to which the music alludes. Without knowing the "language," we can dance to Cui Jian's song as we would to any rock-and-roll tune; once we pay attention to the words, we are in the solemn presence of history, with its insistence on emotional meaning and depth. This is why Cui Jian's music so deeply antagonized the officials in the Chinese state bureaucracy that he was dis- missed from his post in the Beijing Symphony Orchestra and prohibited from performing in Beijing a couple of years ago.10 The official Chinese repudiation of his music is moralistic, aiming to reinforce a kind of obligatory cultural memory in which the founding deeds of communist ancestors are properly honored instead of being "played with" - least of all through the music imported from the capitalist West. But as we look closely at the words themselves, we see that even the words - the medium in which solemn historical emo- tions can be respectably lodged - partake of the "play" with tradition. Instead of words with sonorous historical meanings, Cui Jian's lyrics read more like grammatically incoherent ut- terances. Even though they conjure up "historical" images, his words speak against literate and literary culture by their choppi- ness and superficiality. The Long March, one of the nation's best-selling stories since 1949, is a signifier for something vague and distant, and Chairman Mao, a mere name to complete the rhyme. In reacting against Cui Jian's music, the Chinese authorities were therefore not clinging to solemn words as op- posed to flippant music but rather to what does not exist either in the words or in the music, namely, an idealized notion of official history. Therefore, while the difference between the words and the music exists in terms of their semiotic orders, the words and music are also mutual renditions of each other insofar as they both dis-member and dis-remember official history. The words, by becoming illiterate, turn into physical sound, thus joining the music in the production of a kind of emotion that is, one might say, "beyond words." By associating emotion with musicality and physicality, I may be reinvoking many of the oldest myths about each of these terms. It is often argued that it is the association of music with emotionality that is responsible for its relegation to the realm of the irrational, the feminine, and the simply pleasurable. At the same time, as we examine a non-Western culture such as the Chinese in the 1990s, we notice a resurfacing of precisely such notions about music and the emotions. The discoursing of the</page><page sequence="8">1 36 Discourse 13.1 emotions here is therefore at an interesting crossroads. How do we describe the emotions of a music that is resisting the oppres- siveness of a communist state culture when that music is relying on mythic paradigms against which theories of music in the West are currently struggling? In other words, how do we theorize the significance of music-as-emotion at a time when it is precisely the reduction of music to emotionality that must also be critiqued? The problem of emotionality, it would seem, is the problem of surplus in the sense that emotionality is what exceeds the limits by which its functions can be rationally charted. Music, it is well-known, has always been theorized as a pure form, as that which signifies nothing. In the words of Julia Kristeva, for in- stance, music's semiotics is such that "while music is a system of differences , it is not a system of signs. Its constitutive elements do not have a signified." For Kristeva, music "takes us to the limit of the system of the sign. Here is a system of differences that is not a system that means something, as is the case with most of the structures of verbal language.'41 Because of this "empty," trans- linguistic status, music suits the theorizing of surplus the best because it provides a means of suggesting what goes beyond. One might say that it is the use of music's power as surplus (as that which cannot be safely contained) for a criticism of the straitjack- et of orthodox state ideology that is most evident in the making of Chinese popular music today. And it is this surplus which is commonly recognized as the emotionality of this music. Of course, no matter how excessive the emotions are, they can always be narrativized and thus attributed a more familiar purpose. Dong Wenhua's "Xueyan de fengcai" (Blood-stained spirit) is a good example. This compelling song was first sung for Chinese soldiers fighting in the Sino-Vietnamese War of the sixties. A newer version, resung by Wang Hong, has since then appeared and met with tremendous success among the Chinese especially around and after the Tiananmen Massacre of 1989. The song clearly demonstrates the power of music to harmonize populist emotions. To the extent that contemporary Chinese popular music serves the function of patriotic unification, it shares with its many counterparts decidedly conventional and conservative moments as well. In an account about rock-and-roll, pleasure, and power, Lawrence Grossberg argues that "the affective economy of rock and roll is neither identical to, nor limited to, the production of pleasure."12 If there is an undeniable affinity between emotionality and musicality, we must also add, in Grossberg's words, that "the affective investment, while asignifying, is not a</page><page sequence="9">Fall-Winter 1990-91 137 pristine origin (as the concept of libido might suggest) which precedes the ideological entanglements of the articulation of . . . differences. It is a plane of effects, a circuit of empowerment" (102). What kind of empowerment? Grossberg suggests it in these terms: 4 4In the rock and roll apparatus, you are not what you don't listen to (which is not necessarily the same as you are what you listen to) " (103). This statement - "You are not what you don't listen to" - signifies a view of human labor that is not positive but negative, but the meaning of this negativity is the defiant message that human labor cannot be reduced to a narrowly defined political goal. In contemporary Chinese fiction, the forty years of com- munist history are increasingly understood to be the alienation of human life par excellence through what poses as the "collective" good. The collective is now perceived as that mysterious, objec- tified Other against which one must struggle for one's life.13 Such is the instinctual battle fought by the protagonist in the con- troversial novel Half of Man Is Woman by Zhang Xianliang. Work- ing in a labor camp in the countryside where official instructions are regularly announced through loudspeakers, this man reflects on physical labor in the following terms. Describing hard labor as a "trance," he distinguishes between labor and the officially assigned "job": "Ajob is for someone else. Labour is your own."14 This insistence on the difference between the work that is per- formed for a public sphere with clearly organized goals and the work that is one's own, is not an insistence on "privacy" or private property, but rather a resistance against the coercive regimenta- tion of emotions that is carried out under the massive collectiviza- tion of human lives in the Chinese communist state. Contrary to orthodox socialist beliefs, the protest made in contemporary Chinese popular culture is that such collectivization of human lives is what produces the deepest alienation ever because it turns human labor into the useful job that we are performing for that "other" known as the collective, the country, the people, and so forth. In his book Noise, Jacques Attali makes a point similar to that of Zhang Xianliang's protagonist when he comments on political economy in these terms: Political economy wants to believe, and make others believe, that it is only possible to rearrange the organization of production, that the exteriority of man from his labor is a function of property and is eliminated if one eliminates the master of production. It is necessary to go much further than that. Alienation is not born of production and exchange, nor</page><page sequence="10">138 Discourse 13.1 of property, but of usage: the moment labor has a goal, an aim, a program set out in advance in a code - even if this is by the producer's choice - the producer becomes a stranger to what he produces. He becomes a tool of production, itself an instrument of usage and exchange, until it is pulverized as they are.15 We find in the preceding passage a transgression of the classic paradigms in which we are accustomed to consider human labor. What Attali suggests is that "use" itself, instead of being the original, inalienable part of labor, is actually the most basic form of alienation, for it is already an exchange for something else - in other words, it is predicated on an other, a collec- tive.16 At a time when we have become rightly alert to issues in the Third World, it is precisely the problem of "use" that has to be rethought. Something is "useful," we tend to think, because it serves a collective purpose. While on many occasions I have no objections to this kind of thinking, it is when we deal with the Third World that we have to be particularly careful in resorting to paradigms of the collective as such. Why? Such paradigms produce stereotypical views of members of Third World cultures, who are always seen as representatives driven solely by the cause of vindicating their own cultures. To the extent that such peoples are seen as representatives deprived of their individuality and treated as members of a collective (read "Third World") culture, I think that the morally supportive narrativizing of the Third World by way of utilitarianism, however sophisticatedly utilitarianism is argued, repeats what it tries to criticize, namely, the subjection of entire peoples to conceptual paradigms of life activities that may have little relevance to their struggles for survival. In the case of China, I read the paradigm of collectivity as part of the legacy of imperialism imposed upon a "backward" nation. Like most countries in the post-imperialist era, the alter- native to ultimate destruction in the early twentieth century was, for the Chinese, to "go collective" and produce a "national culture." Collectivity as such was therefore never an ethnic empowerment without neuroses, and it is the neuroses which are now surfacing in popular cultural forms like music. At this point in time, the narrative of collectivity does little to explain the kinds of emotions that are played (upon) in contemporary Chinese music, apart from making us notice this music's negativity and, for some, nihilism. These emotions of negativity suggest a</page><page sequence="11">Fall-Winter 1 990-91 139 deliberate turning away from the collective's thematic burdens through light heartedness, sarcasm, and physicality. While such emotions are not capturable in any one medium alone, in this essay I want to emphasize their special connection with music, in part to criticize the privilege enjoyed by visuality in most discussions of postmodern culture. Like popular culture elsewhere, popular culture in East Asia tends to gravitate toward the image. From large-scale concerts by stars to contests for young singers, from the "self-service" performances of the Japanese-style "Karaoke" to the equivalents of MTV programs on Asian television, music is bound up with the fast-pace tech- nologizing of a part of the world which relies on spectacular images for the sustenance of commodity culture. Music is always simply an accompaniment for the visual. Even when fans go to the concerts of their favorite singing stars, one feels that it is the stars' performance on stage, rather than their singing, that the fans have come to see. Music becomes a mere pretext, and singers, instead of performing with the voice, must excel more in their inventiveness with costumes, dancing, and acrobatics. Although contemporary Chinese popular music can definitely be pursued by way of the spectacle of performance, its interest for me lies elsewhere. While the image marks the body, in music one has to invent a different language of conceptualiz- ing the body, that is, of perceiving its existence without marking and objectifying it as such. The body's existence is here realized through what Attali calls "composition," in which the body, instead of always living in an alienated relation to itself through the stockpiling effects of representation, is present for itself and for "the pleasure outside of meaning, usage and exchange" (137). For this new presence of the body to emerge, the previous codes in which it was written must be destroyed. We hear in a song like "Rock and Roll on the Road of the New Long March" the physicality of such a destruction, which comes to us in the form of a composite. Often, "destructive" songs are made up of a mixture of voice, instruments, and versions of older songs, as well as previous sayings, proverbs, and idioms. Now, we may, if we are intent on reading in what I'd call the Western Marxist way, dismiss this as a form of permissive "pluralism." At the same time this composite structure points to a kind of musical mutation, in which no single theme or event is allowed to monopolize the decibel level, so that it is precisely at the dissonance of these musical parts - in the form of debris - that the physicality of these songs makes itself heard. Often, therefore, "destructive"</page><page sequence="12">140 Discourse 13.1 songs do not distinguish themselves from noise. From the actual coarseness of a singer's voice to the insertion of moments of "clearing the throat," from the disharmonious presence of a different musical background in the same song to the adaptation of familiar folk tunes and themes for a heavily electronic music, what we hear is a mutual "plugging" between partial noises - between differences. This plugging is at the same time an un- plugging of preceding codes in which the fundamental distinc- tion between the human voice and the musical instrument, between rehearsing and actual performing/recording, between traditional and contemporary musical forms, becomes itself a part of playing. The distinction between producer and listener breaks down also. In Attali's words, "The listener is the operator." This notion of the listener-as-operator extends composition beyond the realm of music: "Composition, then, beyond the realm of music, calls into question the distinction between worker and consumer, between doing and destroying, a fundamental division of roles in all societies in which usage is defined by a code; to compose is to take pleasure in the instruments, the tools of communica- tion, in use-time and exchange-time as lived and no longer as stockpiled" (135). An example of such composition in East Asia is the form of entertainment, very popular of late, called "Karaoke." "Karaoke" is the singing, done either in public (Karaoke bars and clubs) or in private (with individual machines for the home) , which breaks down the traditional distinction between perform- ing and listening. A person selects a song s/he likes to sing from a collection that accompanies the Karaoke machine, then sings by following the music and the images (with lyrics) on the video screen. What is most interesting is that the common require- ments of "good" performance, such as the excellence of the voice, adequate training and practice, etc., no longer matter. The entire human body, together with its noise-producing capacity, follows the machine's sounds and images. The machine allows one to feel like - to be - an original performer, but one is literally performing as a listener, with all the "defects" that a performer is not supposed to have. One is liberated from the myth of performance, and does not need to "know how" in order to sing any more. In the rest of this essay I will discuss two specific aspects of composition. First, what does it mean for composition to be read, as Attali suggests, "as an indication of a more general mutation affecting all of the economic and political networks" (135)?</page><page sequence="13">Fall-Winter 1990-91 141 Second, what does it mean to say (Attali is here referring to the musical theory of John Cage) that "music is to be produced . . . everywhere it is possible to produce it, in whatever way it is wished, by anyone who wants to enjoy it" (137)? Listening Otherwise The lyrics of the "Song of the Dwarf" ("Zhuru zhi ge"), by the Taiwanese singer Luo Dayou, go as follows: We must hold hands, hold hands tight Beware of the giants waving at you from far away These history-making faces, these figures of the times They are always carrying guns for the sake of the people The road of the Long March is rough Forcing their way into Tiananmen, they arrive at Beijing The index is alluring in the market of "struggle" Revolutionary doctrines fluctuate like stock prices Five thousand years of despotic rule await your cleansing Beware: The characters who revolt against others are themselves revolted against They clutch at their clothes. They need to have face. How many lives has Mr. Marx destroyed The glorious results of war are woven in our compatriots' blood We dedicate the great victory to the people Five thousand years of despotic rule await your cleansing But who can wash the blood on your hands We must hold hands, hold hands tight Beware of the smile on the face of the dwarf who is approaching These faces behind [him] , these great figures - They are always carrying guns for the sake of the people.17 This song, once again, demonstrates that separation between musicality and verbality I mentioned as characteristic of many other songs. In the remarkable lines, "the index is alluring in the market of Struggle '/Revolutionary doctrines fluctuate like stock prices," the mockery of the communist state is achieved by a clever combination of the languages of revolution and the market economy, or rather, by a rewriting of revolution in terms of the market economy, effecting a demolition of the altruistic</page><page sequence="14">1 42 Discourse 13.1 claims made by the practitioners of the Marxist ideology, which is included as part of the 5000-year old Chinese despotic tradi- tion. The clashing of these two usually incompatible languages, revolution and the market, suggests a fundamental need to revamp the bases for both. Their clashing reveals the grounding of emotions not in "nature" but in technology. Because of the ineluctability of technology, what clash are also the thematics of the "Third World" and the "First World." Technology is that collectivized goal to which East Asian cultures, as part of the non-Western world that survives in the backwash of imperialism, have no choice but to adopt. In the case of mainland China, the successful technologizing of an entire nation through the regimentation of life activities in collective form was ac- complished through the communist revolution. In other, non- communist Chinese communities in East Asia, notably Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore, the success of technology is evident in sophisticated modes of living, inseparable from the produc- tion and consumption of commodities. The co-presence of these two meanings of technology - the collectivized and the com- modified - constitutes a unique type of ethnicity in ways that exceed the orthodox paradigms of demarcating First World and Third World economic and political networks. Contrary to the paradigms of struggle and protest - the cultural stereotypes that are being laid across Third World peoples with uniformity, soliciting them into a coded narrative whether or not they are willing to participate in it - the emotions that emerge here imply a new writing of ethnicity. This writing cannot consider the "ethnic" person simply in the role of the oppressed whom we in the West, armed with questions such as "Who speaks?," attempt to "liberate" by giving a voice, a voice that amounts to a kind of waged labor (the permit to participate in the working world with "choice" and "freedom"). The presence of technology means that the deeply historical percep- tion of the unpredictable but oppressive nature of official culture is here conveyed through instruments that are accomplices as well as resisters to that culture. Precisely because historical injus- tice is the very ground on which the struggle for survival takes place, such injustice is often alluded to indirectly rather than confronted directly. The music of Cui Jian and Luo Dayou is as semantically loaded with the feelings of oppression as it is electronically saturated, but the feelings of oppression impinge upon us as an inerasable, because invisible, referent, like a lan- guage with an insistent syntax but no obvious semiotics/signs</page><page sequence="15">Fall-Winter 1990-91 143 with meanings.18 Official Chinese culture, on the other hand, does not only suppress such emotions in order to uphold the glorious version of history; as usual, it would also criticize the electronics in the name of protecting the integrity of Chinese culture against excessive Westernization.19 Operating under the domination of a patriotic rhetoric that cannot be turned off,20 the counter-discourse we find in many popular songs is thus deliberately inarticulate, by way of a music that is lighthearted, decadent, playing to the rhythms of expensive lifestyles in forget- fulness of the wretched of the earth. The forms of nihilism are used consciously for enervation, producing moments of positivity that restructure relations to the political state. On the streets of Hong Kong, Taipei, and other East Asian cities, as one strolls past shop windows among crowds, in res- taurants, bookstores, produce markets, streetside stalls, Chinese herbal teashops - in all such public places, it is not uncommon to hear this kind of popular music being played on the side for entertainment by the people tending the stores. What the music contributes to the public sphere is a kind of "easy," nonverbal culture that conditions passersby, who nonetheless never focus on it seriously. Unlike the overwhelming presence of com- modified images, popular music leads a life on the side, as a kind of distraction made possible by technology, a distraction that, moreover, is not visible. Such listening on the streets is not merely the substitution of one kind of attention for another, the aural for the visual. Instead, because it is always played on the side, as we are doing other things, it is what I would call a "listening otherwise." Listening otherwise changes the meaning of music from its traditional association with a plenitude that escapes concrete articulation on account of its infinity, to that of a part object whose field is always elsewhere. At the same time, this part object is surplus; it is not reducible or graspable in the form of an externalized image. Its excessive partiality requires a different kind of theorizing.21 "Hear There and Everywhere": 22 Music Miniaturized What we need, in other words, is a history of listening - a history of how listening and how the emotions that are involved in listening change with the apparatuses that make listening possible. Traditionally, listening is, as a rule, public. For a piece</page><page sequence="16">1 44 Discourse 13.1 of music to be heard - even under the most private circumstan- ces - a certain public accessibility can always be assumed. Such public accessibility continues even when music becomes portable with the transistor radio and the portable cassette tape player. With the invention of headphones, on the other hand, listening enters an era of interiorization whose effect of "privacy" is made possible by the thoroughly mechanized nature of its operation. But listening through headphones is still attached to relatively large pieces of machinery, which tend to remain stationary. (We use them when we don't want to disturb others occupying the same space.) The form of listening that is a decisive break from the past is that made possible by the Walkman. One critic describes the Walkman this way: "that neat little object ... a pregnant zero, . . . the unobtrusive link in an urban strategy, a semiotic shifter, the crucial digit in a particular organization of sense."23 Even though the popular songs I am discussing may not be consciously in- tended for playing on the Walkman alone, what I would argue is that the conception of the Walkman is already written into these songs. The Walkman is implied in their composite mode of making, which corresponds to a composite mode of listening that involves multiple entries and exits, multiple turnings-on and turnings-off. If music is a kind of storage place for the emotions generated by cultural conflicts and struggles, then we can, with the new listening technology, talk about the production of such conflicts and struggles on the human body at the press of a button. In the age of the Walkman (or its more sophisticated affiliate, the Discman), the emotions have become portable. In contrast to the gramophone or loudspeaker, without which the "gigantic" history of the public would not have been possible,24 the Walkman ushers in the history of a miniaturized music. But the notion of miniature is useful here only indirectly, as a way to point to the need for us to invent another language that would more appropriately describe the partiality of music. Susan Stewart's study of the narratives of the miniature provides us with the necessary assistance. Among the most important characteristics of the miniature, according to Stewart, is that it establishes a correspondence with the things of which it is a miniature. The miniature is thus unimaginable without visuali ty: "the miniature is a cultural product, the product of an eye performing certain operations, manipulating, and attending in certain ways to, the physical world" (55). The miniature is the labor of multiplying and intensifying significance microscopical- ly: "That the world of things can open itself to reveal a secret life</page><page sequence="17">Fall-Winter 1 990-91 1 45 - indeed, to reveal a set of actions and hence a narrativity and history outside the given field of perception - is a constant daydream that the miniature presents. This is the daydream of the microscope: the daydream of life inside life, of significance multiplied infinitely within significance" (54; emphasis in original) . Insofar as Walkman music is shrunken music, music reduced to the size of the little portable machine that produces it, it is a kind of miniature. But the most important feature of music's miniaturization does not lie in the smallness of the equipment which generates it. Rather, it lies in the revolution in listening engendered by the equipment: while the music is hidden from others because it is compacted, this hiddenness is precisely what allows me to hear it full blast. The "miniaturizing" that does not produce a visible body - however small - that corresponds with "reality" leads to a certain freedom. This is the freedom to be deaf to the loudspeakers of history. We do not return to in- dividualized or privatized emotions when we use the Walkman: rather the Walkman's artificiality makes us aware of the impend- ing presence of the collective, which summons us with the infallibility of a sleepwalker. What the Walkman provides is the possibility of a barrier, a blockage between "me" and the world, so that, as in moments of undisturbed sleep, I can disappear as a listener playing music. The Walkman allows me, in other words, to be missing - to be a missing part of history, to which I say: "I am not there, not where you collect me." In the Walkman, the hiding place for the music-operator, we find the music that, to borrow Attali's phrase, "is to be produced everywhere it is possible to produce it ... by anyone who wants to enjoy it." Here, Barthes's statement that "Politics is not necessarily just talking, it can also be listening" (268) takes on a new meaning. For listening is not, as Adorno describes popular music in America, "a training course in . . . passivity";25 rather it is a "silent" sabotage of the technology of collectivization with its own instru- ments. As the machine of what we might call "automatic playing," the Walkman offers a means of self-production in an age when any emphasis on individualist positions amounts to a scandal.26 What is scandalous is that self-production is now openly autistic. The autism of the Walkman listener irritates onlookers precisely because the onlookers find themselves reduced to the activity of looking alone. For once, voyeurism yields no secrets: one can look all one wants and still nothing is to be seen. The sight of the Walkman listener, much like the sight of some of our most</page><page sequence="18">146 Discourse 13.1 brilliant scientists, artists, and theorists, is one that we cannot enter even with the most piercing of glances. (The Walkman allows us for the first time to realize that our "geniuses" have always lived with earphones on.) Critics of the Walkman, like critics of mass culture in general, are condemned to a position of exteriority, from which all kinds of ineffectual moralistic attacks are fired. This position of exteriority amounts to the charge: "Look at yourself! Look how stupid you look!" But the autistic sight is the one which is free of the responsibility to look, observe, and judge. Its existence does not depend on looking, especially not on looking at oneself. The music operator's activity frankly reveals that the "collective" is not necessarily an "other" to be idealized from afar, but a mundane, mechanical, portable part of ourselves which can be tucked away in our pocket and called up at will. This "self' production through the collective requires not so much slogans as it does AA batteries, and it takes place in the midst of other, perhaps equally insignificant, activities. It sub- stitutes listening for the writing of music and demolishes the myth of creativity through a composite discoursing of the emo- tions. The noises and voices of production become ingredients of self-making. Deprived of their images and their bodily presence in on-stage performances, even singers - "stars" and "icons" - become part of the technologically exteriorized "inner speech" of the listener. As such, the emotions of music are dehydrated, condensed, and encapsulated, so that they can be carried from place to place and played instantly - at "self- service."

'God' is thus man himself, the essence of man, the creative movement of mediation, the transforming power of negativity, but perceived in the form of externality, as belonging to some strange Entity existing in itself, independently of man."

Its unstoppable flow makes it impossible, precisely, to listen clearly and attentively. However, if we are to look for a contemporary "expression" of the idealist infinity traditionally associated with music, Muzak is exactly that - an infinity, but an infinity vulgarized. What is still lacking in most theories, on the other hand, is not the discussion of how Muzak numbs people, but how the listener operates it. 22 This is the last statement in an ad for the Sony "Discman" in Esquire, Jan. 1990. 23 Iain Chambers, "A Miniature History of the Walkman," New Formations 11 (Summer 1990): 1. 24 Adolf Hitler wrote in 1935 in the Manual of German Radio : "Without the loudspeaker, we could never have conquered Germany," qtd.
