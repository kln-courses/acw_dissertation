<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sibelius: Symphony No. 5. By James Hepokoski. pp. x + 126. 'Cambridge Music Handbooks'. (Cambridge University Press, 1993, ?19.95/ ?6.95. ISBN 0-521-40143-7/0-521-40958-6.) Cambridge University Press's claim that the 'Cambridge Music Handbooks provide accessible introductions to major musical works ... with the concert-goer, performer and student in mind' sits oddly with this book. The contents page promises three chapters on Sibelius's Fifth Symphony itself, preceded by three introductory chapters designed to place the work in its historical context, of which the third is entitled 'Reassessed Compositional Principles' and is subdivided into 'Content-based forms ("fantasias")', 'Rotational form (varied multisectional strophes)', 'Tele- ological genesis ("phenomenological" reflection)', 'Klang meditation' and 'Interrelation and fusion of movements'. Browsers looking for birthday presents for their 'concert-goer, performer and student' friends may well frown. And the Heideg- ger quotation on the facing page threatens a level of discourse of pretentious inscrutability. Readers of Music &amp; Letters will no doubt take all this in their stride, however, and to those with any inter- est in Sibelius, or the issues of symphonism, or music in the late Romantic/early modem period it can be said thatJames Hepokoski has produced a masterly and engrossing study. It contains prob- ably the best published analytical writing on Sibelius in any language, and it entirely vindicates the author's disregard of the Cambridge guide- lines. The point of Hepokoski's preliminary chapters is 'to challenge and redefine the categories under which Sibelius's music is perceived'. In one sense this is not the most difficult of tasks, since those categories have been so casually applied hitherto. But what Hepokoski proposes is extraordinarily persuasive, and it leads smoothly into a discussion of the Fifth Symphony which is packed with new and illuminating insights. In essence he takes Dahlhaus's hypothesis of a generation of 'mod- ems' born about 1860 and active between 1889 and 1914-a generation which included Elgar, Puccini, Mahler, Wolf, Debussy, Strauss, Sibel- ius, Glazunov(!), Nielsen and Busoni and which may be distinguished from the 'New Music' of the Schoenberg school and the revolutions of Stra- vinsky and the Parisians. He notes the modems' common concern to define themselves within and against the various orthodoxies, both social and technical, of turn-of-the-century art music, and that this concern is most clearly identifiable in a range of 'sonata-deformation' procedures. He also notes their shared need in the immediate pre- Great War years to confront the radical innova- tions emanating from Vienna and Paris and adjust their stylistic assumptions accordingly. Here is a challenge to music historians to acknowledge the importance of composers some- times thoughtlessly labelled (whether in approba- tion or censure) conservative. Hepokoski proceeds to document Sibelius's attitudes to the crisis and its effect on the compositional issues which came to be embodied in the Fifth Symphony (which are essentially those listed in the second sentence of this review). With this as his context, and having done ample justice to the sketches and the rejected 1 915 and 1916 versions, Hepokoski moves on to a subtle and penetrating scansion of each move- ment in terms of procedures which are archetypal but not necessarily dependent on received formal categories. On the way, he offers fundamental insights into the nature of Sibelian harmony and the referential-affective quality of his textures. Though undoubtedly challenging to the non- specialist, the style of writing manages to convey excitement as well as insight, keeping a judicious balance between structural, anthropomorphic and intertextual modes of description. There are hardly any inaccuracies-I take it that 'dactylic' on page 64 should read 'amphibrachic', and it would be helpful to know that the reference on page 60 to 'bar 105' concerns the finale, not the first movement. There is a valuable concluding note on editions and performance tempos with reference to the composer's known preferences. But it could be said that there are one or two missed opportun- 483</page><page sequence="2">ities in respect of this kind of appendix material. Of all Sibelius's works this is the one that has per- haps exerted the most significant influence. Per N0rgArd, Peter Maxwell Davies and Robert Simpson are among those who have been fascinated by its inner processes, and their major works composed in response to it would have merited some discussion. And among comment- ators who have written seriously about the Fifth Symphony it is odd to find no mention of Tovey (whose 'Thor's hammer' image for the great finale theme will now have to give place to Hepokoski's 'swan hymn'). But this remains a deeply impress- ive book. It may not be an overstatement to conclude that it contains more illuminating musical and historical insight in its hundred or so pages than may be found in the rest of the Sibelius secondary literature put together.
