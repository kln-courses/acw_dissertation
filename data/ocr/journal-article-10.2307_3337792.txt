WEHMEYER he Spiritual Church of New Orleans is one of the most vibrant and complex religious communities in a city well known for its rich sacred her- itage. The almost exclusively African American congregation and cler- gy combine Roman Catholic iconography and aesthetics with a fiery revivalist preach- ing style, and blend mediumistic prac- tices derived from nineteenth-century American spiritualism with African cos- mologies, ritual traditions, and folk medicine. The resulting mix yields an en- nobling and uplifting spirituality with an intensely pragmatic edge. Through spiri- tual "work" involving prayer, candles ("lights"), holy oils, herbs, and the manip- ulation of saints' statues or other sacred images, the clergy and congregants of the Spiritual Churches make a way for them- selves in the increasingly dangerous and hostile terrain of urban New Orleans. One of the most celebrated aspects of the Churches is the veneration (along- side Catholic saints, biblical figures, and the spirits of deceased Church matri- archs) of one or more "Indian" spirits.1 Local history, popular opinion, and pub- lished biographies of Native American historical figures combine to create a rich narrative and ritual tradition surround- ing Indian spirits like the redoubtable Black Hawk. Mass-marketed stereotypi- cal images of Native Americans form the focal point for dramatic assemblage on This page: 1.

This altar is a later development of the one seen in Figure 3. Spiritual altars are organic, evolving structures that change to reflect the needs of the individual or community maintaining them. A fork and a spoon (barely visible above the bottom row of candles) also signal a connection with Kongo- derived Haitian Petwo and Bizango altar traditions. Opposite page: 2.

The iconography of the Spiritual Churches in New Orleans reflects a dynamic mix of religious in- fluences, including Catholicism, revivalism, and African ritual. Black Hawk and other "Indian" spirits are venerated for their associations with these various traditions. The vessel of blessed water with submerged crucifix most likely derives from Spiritualist/Spiritist practices seen through- out the United States and the Caribbean. atrican arts * winter 2000 62</page><page sequence="2">both communal and private altars to these spirits (Figs. 1, 2, 3). Even a brief glance at the altars reveals that they are products of several diverse cultural streams and that there are any number of points of entry for exploration and analysis of the Indian spirit complex. Prior scholarship on the Spiritual Church shows us that this work has already begun in earnest. Scholars like Claude Jacobs (1989) and Andrew Kaslow (acobs &amp; Kaslow 1991), Jason Berry (1995), and photoethnographers Syndey Bird and Michael P. Smith (1992) have offered ex- aminations of Indian traditions in the Spiritual Church which highlight con- nections with Roman Catholic aesthetics, Mardi Gras Indian customs, and events in the life of the historical Black Hawk. There is another point of connection which I feel has not yet sufficiently been explored: the similarities with the nkisi traditions (pl. minkisi) associated with Kongo culture in central Africa and the diaspora. The relationship between Kongo themes and diasporic "Indian" imagery and ritual has been touched on by a num- ber of scholars, perhaps most notably Robert Farris Thompson, who posits a "Feathered Idiom of Transcendence" which ties "Indian" traditions throughout the Black Atlantic to central African roots: The feathered headdresses of the Amerinds, real or imagined, were decisively attractive to eyes primed by the feathered bonnets of Kongo minkisi and banganga. In Umbanda [African spiritualist practice in Brazil], the caboclo element opened the door for a flood of renascent Kongo/Angola elements, including names in Ki-Kongo, gunpowder art, earth blazons, nganga-like headdress- es recoded Amerind, and so forth. (Thompson 1993:190) We find feather emblems also upon the altars of Kongo-influenced Haiti. In the American South tradi- tional African-American healers took names like Doctor Buzzard. (Thompson 1993:28) While Thompson subsequently in- cludes New Orleans's Mardi Gras Indians in his catalogue of plumed spiritual forces in the New World, the Indian spirits of the Spiritual Church are absent. In this discus- sion of the altars created for the spirit of Black Hawk, I wish to suggest Kongo aes- thetics as another influence. In addition, by analyzing Kongo persistence in altars erected for another Indian spirit known as "Uncle" or "Kind Uncle," I hope to illumi- nate aspects of Spiritual Church practice winter 2000 ? atrican arts which have in prior writings seemed somewhat mysterious and opaque. Despite my focus on themes of persis- tence and continuity, I do not intend to present a reductive analysis. The altars draw from a wide range of sacred and mundane traditions. The Kongo material forms only one thematic layer (albeit a very deep and rich one) of a hybrid com- plex within a system that is itself hy- bridized and highly accretive. The characteristics which Wyatt MacGaffey associates with a particular class of the Kongo power figures called minkisi (glossed as "minkisi-of-the-above") line up nicely with the traits Spiritual Church members ascribe to the spirit of Black Hawk and which are made visible and tangible on Black Hawk's altars. In The Eyes of Understanding, MacGaffey writes that minkisi-of-the-above are associated with the atmosphere, used for protection or supernatural attack, for law giving, oath taking, and administering divine punishment. He further tells us that "their signs included lightning, fire, weapons...birds of prey, and the color red.... Many examples.. .threatened the viewer with a spear in an upraised hand" (1993:69-72). Images of Black Hawk on Spiritual Church altars are clearly and dramatically 63</page><page sequence="3">Top: 3. Bishop Oliver Coleman at home with his Black Hawk altar. New Orleans, 1995. Photo: Syndey Byrd. "Indian" and Catholic imagery are readily ap- parent in this altar, with Catholic elements also present in the style of the bishop's vestments. Bishop Coleman preaches at a number of Spiritual Churches and ministries, and serves as spiritual counselor to congregations and indi- viduals in New Orleans and throughout the South and Midwest. Bottom: 4. Black Hawk altar at Israelite Divine Spiri- tual Church. New Orleans, 1997. Photo: Stephen C. Wehmeyer. In this altar Black Hawk is associated with St. Michael the Archangel, who is similarly armed, feathered, and swathed in red. armed, plumed, and painted or orament- ed in red (Figs. 4,5). In two instances I saw replicas of spears added to enhance the martial character of the mass-produced image. In a 1997 interview with Bishop Daniel Jackson, the creator and operator of a Black Hawk altar at St. Daniel's Spiritual Church (Fig. 6), commented: "You know this was an Indian weapon. They didn't use guns. They used spears. That's how they did their work. If there was some- body they wanted to kill...boom!" A moment later he brandished a plastic tom- ahawk, proclaiming, "A working tool for Indians! To cut a right of way!"2 Themes of aggression and righteous retribution abound on this altar, as Black Hawk stands with his tripod of spears, recalling minkisi hung with hollow tubes of gunpowder ("spirit guns") or festooned with spikes and knife blades. The tension embodied in this imposing armory keeps the viewer on guard. One cannot help but wonder about the injustices against which those spears have been raised or what paths that toma- hawk has carved out of a threatening, oppressive society. MacGaffey stresses the association "with birds and other flying creatures" and tells us that minkisi are sometimes equipped with feathers, especially those of raptors, to form a kind of headdress such as the nganga (ritual specialist) himself might wear" (MacGaffey 1988:193). The molded plumes of Black Hawk's statue in Bishop Jackson's altar have been enhanced by the addition of an actual feathered war- bonnet. In a similar vein, the persistent association of Black Hawk with St. Michael the Archangel is easily understood when one accepts both of these figures (armed, feathered, and swathed in red) as visible expressions of the kinds of spiritual forces embodied in minkisi-of-the-above. The similarities between Black Hawk and minkisi begin to look positively con- trived when MacGaffey tells us that "the Bakongo likened the action of minkisi-of- the-above attacking victims to that of a hawk stooping on chickens" (1993:75). When I asked Bishop Jackson to "tell me about Black Hawk," his response was swift and automatic: "I use him for court cases...for justice." While he and other 64 church members I interviewed occasion- ally referred to events in the life of the historical Black Hawk, the most frequent- ly narrated story concerned his spiritual debut in New Orleans. During a famous court battle, the spirit of Black Hawk was said to have inspired Leafy Anderson, the founding mother of the Spiritual Church, to prophesy for the presiding judge; the judge was so shaken by the truth of her revelations that he guaran- teed her and her church immunity from future legal interference. The American flags that drape each side of this altar can be read in different ways. Belonging to a nation formed by those seeking freedom of worship, they might be seen to embody religious free- dom. Or perhaps they recall the victory of the Union over the Confederacy, which, for the Church's Afro-American congre- gations, expresses another kind of libera- tion. The flags might also be seen as a further invocation of the martial character of Black Hawk (although it is somewhat odd that the flag of the nation which con- quered and displaced indigenous peoples should be placed on an "Indian" altar). But when asked about the presence of the flags, Bishop Jackson responded: "They're important because you got three colors there: red, white, and blue." For him, at least, the flags' chromatic symbolism is more important than their political reso- nance. Anita Jacobson-Widding presents a masterly analysis of tricolor symbolism in Kongo metaphysics, exploring the in- terplay of red, white, and black, which atrican arts ? winter 2000</page><page sequence="4">"form a set of symbols of the basic princi- ples that man has to take into account in coping with the known and the unknown" (acobson-Widding 1979:303). On the bish- op's Black Hawk altar, we find the para- digm of red-white-black transmuted to red-white-blue; in central Africa, Jacobson- Widding writes, "[b]lue is regarded as equivalent to black" (1979:154). Bishop Jackson's cryptic explanation of the pres- ence of American flags on the Black Hawk altar suggests a layer of cosmological sig- nificance underlying the more obvious historical or political significance. Jacob- son-Widding asserts that when the three colors are used in combination in a Kongo nkisi, the color red is understood to mediate the forces embodied in black and white: "That which is uncertain, dubious, ambig- uous...or something in between [is] con- nected with the color red" (1979:341). This paradigm is highly appropriate to the Black Hawk complex if we consider Black Hawk (who is "Indian"and thus "red") as a mediator between black and white worlds. A complete analysis of the persis- tence of red-white-black logic in the Spiri- tual Church is beyond the scope of this essay, but the phenomenon certainly in- vites further exploration. I cannot leave discussion of this par- ticular altar without mentioning a can of Schlitz beer tucked behind Black Hawk's leg. Bishop Jackson made special note of it when we discussed his altar: You see I put a can of beer on the altar...when you make him drunk, he'll do anything. Because most people when they drink they get to be a different person, and it's the same way with them [the spirits]. When they drink, they are a differ- ent person. The unopened beer can serves as a con- stant reminder of an underlying ambiva- lence surrounding the Indian spirits in the Spiritual Church. While such spirits are generally perceived as benevolent, they may be sent "on the warpath" if necessary. If the face of the statue is painted with lip- stick or greasepaint, and if "firewater" is offered to Black Hawk in quantity, the spirit can be constrained to "do anything," in the Bishop's words.3 The beer is more than a symbol of that ambivalence; it is the agent by which the spirit may be sent to act belligerently. By placing the can half- hidden on the altar amid the forest of spears and other aggressive accouter- ments, Bishop Jackson creates a feeling of divine tension, rather like the feeling one gets from seeing a match held to a fuse, or an arrow nocked against a taut bow- string. The beer can calls to mind the kind of serious "work" to which Black Hawk might have been set in the past, and more important, the work to which he might be set in the future. This atmosphere of tension and ambivalence surrounds the Indian spir- winter 2000 ? atrican arts its as it does Kongo minkisi: the latter must be approached with a healthy respect that acknowledges their propen- sity to kill as often as to cure. Bishop Edmonia Caldwell, one of the matriarchs of the Spiritual Church and the niece of Mother Leafy Anderson herself, told me tersely: "You rub an Indian the wrong way, you see what you gonna get!" Kongo-derived aesthetics are evident in other parts of the diaspora as well. In Haiti, Petwo and Bizango altar tradi- tions, both of which are known for their strong Kongo influence, use forks and spoons to signal the foreign, and thus powerful and potentially volatile, nature of the spirits with which they work. The Black Hawk altar in the home of Bishops Oliver and Efzelda Coleman (Fig. 1) in- corporates a fork and spoon. Kongo resonances emerge even more strikingly from an examination of the altars associated with a more illusive fig- ure honored in the Spiritual Churches, a spirit usually known only as "Uncle" or "Uncle Bucket." Jacobs and Kaslow offer a detailed description of a ritual called "The Uncle Bucket Service": On a rear or side altar in some churches there is a small pail or bucket filled with sand that is ded- icated to a spirit referred to as "Kind Uncle." Implanted in the sand are always three American flags which are usually said to rep- resent the three persons of the Trinity. However in once instance, an individual explained that the flags represent the spirits of Kind Uncle, Aunt Peggy, and Little Brother. Candles or a votive light may also be placed in the sand.... During one service, the minis- ter introduced the Uncle Bucket ritual by telling the congregation: "We're going to make ready to go to the pail" says the spirit that sits here. Those that's got good off this pail, makes it three nickels, three dimes, or three quarters. Those who do want a job! Those who want rootwork! Those who desire court cases to come! Those who desire victory in your court case, come to Uncle's table! Those that desire rootwork, add to what you have, come to the table! As the organist began playing "When the Saints Go Marching In," the minister directed the worship- pers to form a line and proceed to the rear of the church where there was a small table with the pail on it. At this altar, each person made a silver offering and was then in- structed to place three fingers into the pail of sand, while "making a wish." Having completed these ac- tions, the individual returned to a seat in the congregation. (acobs &amp; Kaslow 1991:115-16) Jacobs and Kaslow's informants offer different explanations of Uncle's identity and origins. This mysterious spirit is identified variously as St. George, a Con- federate soldier, or the spirit of the deceased uncle of one "Mother Price." Zora Neale Hurston also mentions this spirit in a 1931 article in the Journal of American Folklore. Mother Price ranks second to Mother Anderson, She also built up a chain of congregations. The "Spirit Uncle" attends her altars and is represented by a picture of St. George. The original of the Spirit Uncle was an uncle of Mother Price's who had died on the battle field. In all of her churches there is a special little altar built for him with a receptacle for money. One must give him three pieces of money (no pennies). The sand bucket is another sacred article on this altar. It is used to set candles in. (Hurston 1931:319) Hurston's account involves some of the elements associated with the latter- day Uncle shrine: St. George, the offering of silver money in threes, and the "sand bucket." Perhaps the most notable ele- ment which persists is the association of Uncle with things martial, as suggested by the picture of St. George and the belief that Mother Price's uncle had "died on the battle field." Several of my informants in the Spiri- tual Church, however, identified Uncle as "Indian." Bishop Jackson knew this spirit well: "Uncle Bucket. That's another Indian spirit. We give him a blue light." Bishop Edmonia Caldwell likewise identified Uncle as "another Indian guide." The Uncle Bucket shrine at Israelite Divine Spiritual Church sits on a small table to the right of the main altar, nearly invisible behind the organ (Fig. 7). Its resting place is as austere as Black Hawk's is opulent. A blue enameled pail sprout- ing three American flags appears in the center of the table along with a blue seven-day candle. Behind the bucket, concealed in shadow, a smoke-darkened picture of St. George leans against the wall. The statue at the right suggests that Uncle can indeed be numbered among the Indian spirits: its lap is strewn with hard candy and small change-the tradi- tional silver offering. Like Kongo minkisi, which have as many hidden ingredients as visual ones, the Uncle Bucket relies upon strategies of concealment and revelation to com- municate spiritual presence. The three flags attract the viewer's attention to the 65</page><page sequence="5">This page: Top: 5. Black Hawk altar at Way of the Cross Apos- tolic Spiritual Church. New Orleans, 1995.

The pail filled with sand refers to the enigmatic Uncle Bucket, which some Spiritual Church mem- bers identify as another "Indian" spirit, as sug- gested by the figure at right. sand in which they are propped; the eyes are drawn to the flag poles as they dis- appear below the rim of the bucket. Unlike the rack of candles beside the Black Hawk altar, or the Christmas lights bedecking the main altars in many Spiritual Churches, the single blue light before the Uncle Bucket offers little illu- mination. It creates an atmosphere of shifting shadow, a dim, dreamlike envi- ronment for the enigmatic Uncle. The visible components serve primarily to signal the presence of the Bucket's invis- ible components. As Bishop Oliver Cole- man explained: An Uncle Bucket is a special buck- et, because there are special ingre- dients to the Uncle Bucket which I'm not at liberty to discuss. There's things in the bucket like the flags that you see, and there's things in the bucket that you don't see. And of course a lot of prayer and conse- cration goes into it when you're doing it right. This reminder of the invisible inspires respect and ambivalence among contem- porary Spiritual Church members. Many I spoke to seemed to hold Uncle at arm's length. Bishop Jackson remarked enig- matically: "I had one here once, but some of my members didn't like it, so I got rid of it." Bishop Caldwell identified Uncle as a spirit who works "for good and evil.... I had a taste of that Uncle work, and I didn't like it."4 When asked to comment on the flags in the Uncle assemblage, Bishop Oliver Coleman responded: "We have flags around the bucket, the United States flag particularly, because it has to do with lib- erty, with being set free from bondage. Okay? That's one of the very prevalent themes of the Uncle Bucket." 66 african arts - winter 2000</page><page sequence="6">Like the spears and tomahawks on the Black Hawk altar, the flags and image of St. George suggest that Uncle will fight on behalf of those who honor him. Whether they are beset by financial hardship or difficult court cases, they have only to "go to the pail" for libera- tion. While the American flag on the shrine resonates strongly with the mili- tary atmosphere associated with Uncle, one might also point out that the flag invokes Kongo tricolor logic, as it does on the Black Hawk altar. If Uncle, like Black Hawk, inspires an atmosphere of some ambivalence, then the presence of all three colors in his iconic representa- tion makes sense. Uncle is a powerfully pragmatic spirit. He "works for good and evil," for "victory in court cases," and for "rootwork."5 He is black, white, and the red that lies between and beyond black and white.6 Perhaps the most striking connections between the Uncle spirit and Kongo mate- rial are documented in Harry Hyatt's mammoth Hoodoo, Conjuration, Witchcraft, Rootwork (1970). Hyatt offers several accounts of the presence of Uncle in New Orleans from the mid-1930s onward. One informant describes a private candle rite involving one white candle placed behind a blue one: "De white one is Master an' de blue one is Uncle. Yo always say [set?] Master back of Uncle, an' yo' ast him tuh do sech-an-sech a thing an' he'll do this thing: give yo' a job or keep a person down-dey won't prosper." This explana- tion recalls Bishop Caldwell's assertion that Uncle works "for good and evil." Hyatt himself tells us that Uncle is "a well known spirit we shall meet again, this time under the name of Unkus." One of his more cryptic informants, known as the "Unkus Man," discusses his relationship winter 2000 ? atrican arts to this spirit. Although his account is somewhat rambling, and often incompre- hensible, it is worth quoting at length for the light it sheds on our contemporary examination of the Uncle shrine (words in parentheses are Hyatt's): Now we got the spirit of Unkus. (of Unkus, yes.) He one of the greatest law givers on land. You gotta feed him with blood. (You have to feed him with blood?) With blood. (How do you do that?) Well that is by fine infant pigeons or infant chickens that are young. Just kotch 'em and drop something out the door and see if you can get the spirit of Unkus...You must first understand how to call Unkus' spir- it...and if you know how to call Unkus' spirit, you must have some- thing to give him. You can't call him if you don't have blood....but in calling Unkus there's a certain mark... (You say there's a certain mark you make?) The mark must be like a stamp you make with chalk. You...take it with a chalk and mark my hand... [infor- mant demonstrates] (ust as if a person rubbed chalk over the palm of his hand...stamped this chalk handprint on the floor three inches from the door; only instead of chalk, the hand has been smeared with blood. You put your hand flat on the floor?) Yeah...Now when you kin call Unkus-I believe your spirit look like it runnin' so far that you your personal self ought to be able to call Unkus-and we will know who is Unkus, find who he was. Now if you got Unkus with your- self by doing good, ain't no law can come nowhere-nowhere bother- ing round about you. If they don't come as friends to you, they can't come and make no arrest on you. I'm got a boy downstairs right now I took out of jail yesterday. (Who was Unkus?) ...the second child of Mary. (Mary? The Virgin Mary?) He was the brother of Christ...Yeah, 'cause her son was leaving her, they said, she had left Joseph and went to the care of John. And then she go to tending to John, naturally, in the flesh, and she didn't bear no chil- dren for Joseph in the flesh-Joseph was only the foster-father that was faked-that's what we could see- but Unkus-we call him Unkus be- cause we call Christ, Our Father. And the devil's our father, too. (I see, you call this fellow, Uncle?) Yes, call him uncle but you must 67</page><page sequence="7">know how to call his spirit.... Uncle's life is that life-a life that represents air-what you call the spirit of the atmosphere-the mo- tive source of the wind and the light which goes across there called Aurora Borealis...I uses him, I uses him myself for hoodoo. (Now when you make this mark on the floor, you put this blood in there to call Unkus....do you have to do anything more to make him come?) The part you burnm-the flesh of the animal or the bird, which you- you bur the flesh of that animal. That animal is not to be et by me or nobody else, but it burs. Now- and you ask him whatever you will when he's there before you, just ask him and he'll tell you. (What do you do when he appears before you?) Bow yourself like that [He bows.] (What does he look like?) He just be-he don't look more than that high [demonstrates] with a little clock on his belly. (About eight or nine inches high. And what has he on his belly?) A big clock....Yeah, a cock to keep time-right in his belly. He's the spirit of the atmosphere. And he got a nose just like a white man. And he's not a negro at all, got a big nose, and he just stand there with a clock in his belly....And everything you tell him, he going to do it. (Hyatt 1970, vol. 2:1299-1300) Hyatt's informant offers us (among other things) an image of a little man with a clock in his belly.7 While this remarkable image might relate to "figure docks" pop- ular throughout the United States since before the turn of the century, it also calls to mind anthropomorphic examples of the nkisi nkondi whose bellies are capped with mirrors or other shining discs (Fig. 8). If one considers the phonetic similarity between Unkus and nkisi, this connection becomes even more apparent.8 The ritual for "calling the spirit" cen- ters around making "a certain mark" on the floor in chalk, along with a sacrificial blood offering. This is the essence of Kongo ritual in both Africa and the dias- pora, where cosmograms marked in vari- ous substances are sanctified with blood to open a gateway into the spirit world. Considering the qualities previously ascribed to "minkisi-of-the-above," it is not at all strange to hear Hyatt's informant assert that Unkus is "one of the greatest law givers on land." Neither is it strange that he can get one out of jail or be identi- fied with the aurora borealis or the motive power of the atmosphere. Like his Kongo cousins, Unkus/Unce is a swiftly mov- ing, airborne force which metes out justice or, if approached correctly, liberates one from bondage. 68 Keeping these Kongo connections in mind, let us return for a moment to the familiar Uncle shrine with the bucket and flags. In the Kongo-derived Afro-Cuban religion known as Palo Mayombe or Palo Monte, the central icon is a cauldron filled with sacred earths, powerful sticks, feath- ers, knives, nails, and other parapherna- lia. It serves as a home for a particular ancestor spirit, frequently embodied in a kiyumba, or human skull.9 Like its Old World predecessors, this cauldron shrine is frequently called "nkisi." It takes little imagination to link the Uncle Bucket, with its protruding flags and secret com- ponents buried beneath sacred sand, to its Afro-Cuban cognates. While the bucket as a ritual object in the Spiritual Church is most dosely asso- cated with Unde, some church members also have a bucket for Black Hawk. Bishop Edmonia Caldwell, who generally steers cear of "that Unde work," keeps a bucket This page: 8. Nkisi nkondi. Kongo peoples, Democratic Re- public of the Congo.

One informant's description of the spirit called "Uncle" or "Unkus" as a figure with a clock in his belly recalls nkisi figures whose torsos display receptacles containing powerful ingredients, sealed with glass or mirror.

She sets lights in it and works it by "moving the candles and praying." When her church was damaged by floodwaters, Bishop Caldwell was forced for a time to resort to a small Black Hawk altar installed behind her front door. The "Bucket" took the form of a Cafe du Monde coffee can, but it was still filled with pure white sand and held the candles with which to work the spirit. Bishop Coleman likewise keeps a buck- et on his altar for Black Hawk. "Some min- isters," he told me, "put Uncle on the Black Hawk altar...[but] There's a [spe- cial] bucket that you sit on the altar for Black Hawk. Some people do, some peo- ple don't. I use a bucket. I work him with the bucket, because I write in the sand." On Bishop Coleman's home altar, the hallmarks of the Afro-Cuban nkisi-caul- dron, sacred sticks, feathers, and human skull-are replaced with a tin bucket, replica spears, a parade of flags, and a plastic bust of Jesus. A thick steel spike is just visible inside this bucket (recalling the power of iron, and St. George), and in the foreground an aggressive St. Michael presides over a tub of empty vials wait- ing to be filled with herbs and consecrat- ed oil (evidence of both the Kongo and Indian spirits' predilection for healing and rootwork; Fig. 9). Equally dramatic Indian/Bucket altars replete with heads, flags, spears, candles, and crucifixes can be found in churches and homes through- out New Orleans (Figs. 2, 10). The process by which priests of Palo Mayombe bring forth the spirit dwelling within the nkisi is clearly related to the ways in which one invokes the Hoodoo spirit "Unkus" or by which one "works" the various bucket shrines of the Spiri- tual Church. This process predictably involves lighting candles ("setting of lights" in the lingo of the Spiritual Church) and inscribing cosmograms (called pon- tos orfirmas), and frequently includes an offering of strong liquor or a blood sacri- fice comparable to that described by Hyatt's informant.10 While the blood sac- rifice (as far as I know) does not play a part in the veneration of Uncle in the Spiritual Churches, several members have told me that they use whiskey or rum in conjunction with the bucket shrines; and the silver offering to Kind Uncle mentioned by Hurston, Jacobs, and Kaslow echoes Lydia Cabrera's ac- count of the creation of an Afro-Cuban nkisi. The latter involves marking a cross on the bottom of a cauldron, onto which one places "five Spanish silver reales."'l Kongo traditions throughout the Car- ibbean seem to have crept into the Uncle/Unkus/nkisi complex in New Or- leans. Bishop Jackson remarked to me that "Uncle is an Indian spirit...He's one that would sit in a chair. I don't have none here, but he sits in a chair." In the Bizango and Petwo traditions of Haitian Vodou, one often finds containers of powerful spirits bound or tied in small wooden chairs. The traveling exhibition of Haitian religious art, "Sacred Arts of Haitian Vodou" (UCLA Fowler Museum of Cul- tural History, 1995), offered a telling reso- nance in a purportedly "Indian" Zemi stone, bound into a tiny chair. Highlighting the multiple elements linking Kongo spiritual traditions to the Indian traditions of the Spiritual Churches ultimately raises more questions than can be answered in a single essay. We might wonder, for example, to what degree Afro-Atlantic scholarship has influenced the more dramatic examples of Kongo- Indian syncretism seen on Church altars, since the F &amp; F Botanica on Broad Street in New Orleans (which supplies many Spiritual Churches with candles, oils, and Indian images) now stocks publications by scholars of Africa and the diaspora, like Henry Drewal, William Bascom, and Sandra Barnes. We might also wonder how important these connections are to the cergy and congregation of the Spiritual Churches. I recall briefly outlining some of these ideas for Bishop Coleman at an early stage of my field research in New Orleans. He seemed far less impressed with the cross-cultural connections than I was. "Spirit is universal," Coleman said ex- pansively, "and He's a universal God for a universal people." I am reminded of an afternoon when I excitedly asked a cergy member why an Indian statue was placed on an altar to a particular Catholic saint. His answer was somewhat sobering: "It was the only place we had room for it." One must always remember that the Spiritual Church is alternately opulent and thrifty in its metaphysical expres- sions. It is eternally pragmatic, however, and thus questions about the historical or hagiographic origins of a particular saint or spirit guide are far less impor- tant than questions about how that saint or guide can help one lead a happy, moral, successful life in the face of con- stant struggle. Nevertheless, the altars for the Indian spirits examined here do suggest a profound Kongo influence which can no longer be overlooked by those who wish to examine the diverse and dynamic traditions of New Orleans's Spiritual Churches.

The next year they purchased two large collections of historical pottery and Navajo textiles from Fred Harvey. 5. The museum's initial African acquisitions couldn't have been more timely. Beginning with Ghana in 1957, one African country after another gained its independence. On March 6, 1957, page-four headlines in The Kansas City Star blazed: "Day of Great Joy: Prime Minister [Kwame Nkrumah] Sees It as Start of Drive to Free All Colonial Areas." 6. Binkley held a three-part lecture series with this goal in mind. The title of Roy Sieber's guest lecture, "Stunning...but Is It Art?," revealed an impetus to place African art in art his- torical context. A symposium featuring Susan Vogel ("African Aesthetics"), Margaret Thompson Drewal ("Art in Yoruba Performance"), and Mary Jo Arnoldi ("Shared Perceptions: Art of the Western Sudan") also examined this issue.

WEHMEYER: Notes, fromi page 69 [This article was accepted for publication in August 1999.1 In the Spiritual Church, it is customary to begin the service by "first giving honor and obedience to God, second to his dar- ling son Jesus, to the Archbishop, to the Bishops present in the congregation, and to all the deacons and ministers pres- ent in the Church." In this tradition, I must begin by acknowl- edging my "academic spirit guides" whose scholarship has formed the basis for my inquiry: Donald Cosentino, Wyatt MacGaffey, and Robert Farris Thompson. I am also grateful to Jason Berry and Syndey Byrd, who offered both kind hospi- tality and tremendous insights into New Orleans vernacular religion. I must also thank Syndey for the use of her pho- tographs. Last and most important, I offer thanks to my con- sultants in the Spiritual Church without whose generosity and willingness to share knowledge and experience this arti- cle could not have been written. Bishop Oliver Coleman, my chief guide to the mysteries of the Spiritual Church; Bishops Efzelda Coleman, Edmonia Caldwell, Daniel Jackson, and Victoria McSwain; Archbishop Johnson and all the clergy and congregants of Israelite Divine Spiritual Church-you have my deepest gratitude. This article is based on a paper presented at the ACASA Triennial Symposium on African Art in New Orleans, 1998. 1. Throughout this essay I use the term "Indian" rather than "Native American" to refer to the various figures and behav- iors termed "Indian" by church members in New Orleans. In addition to being the accepted designation within the Spiritual Church, "Indian" preserves the distinction between these images and activities and those belonging to local indigenous peoples. As Thompson and Berry have suggest- ed, "Indian" in New Orleans is often better read as coded "African" than as "Native American." 2. Unless otherwise indicated, all quotes were taken from the following interviews: Bishop Daniel Jackson, August 1997; Bishop Oliver Coleman, ALugust 1997, December 1997, May 1998, and (where noted) phone interviews and informal con- versations held over the last three years; Edmonia Caldwell, December 1997; and Efzelda Coleman, December 1997. All photographs (except those attributed to Syndey Byrd) were taken during these interviews. 3. At least one of my other consultants in the Spiritual Church takes serious issue with Bishop Jackson's words, maintaining that Black Hawk always works for right and justice, and there- fore cannot be constrained to "do anything" outside the realm of righteousness.

The presence of Uncle shrines in several highly respected spiritual churches suggests that he is not often asked to work "for evil." As with Black Hawk, there is likely to be debate about the spirit's character, although those who do work with him steadfastly assert his essentially moral nature. 5. "Rootwork" is a broad term for a range of African Ameri- can magical and medical practices involving natural elements like roots, leaves, and graveyard dust. 6. Many Spiritual Church members would be troubled or insulted by the comparison of their worship to "Hoodoo." In his recent article "Hoodoo? God Do!," David Estes (1998) explores the contested middle ground between the work of the Churches and their counterparts in New Orleans tradi- tions of conjure and rootwork. Similar distinctions are often drawn by church members between their Spiritual work and the less moral work of the "Spiritualists" a term they use to designate sorcerers and fdrtunetellers. I do not wish to draw (or challenge) any moral or theological connections between these groups. As a folklorist, my concern is with the similari- ties in practice which point to common backgrounds in cen- tral African culture and metaphysics. 7. Similarly, a large clock bedecked with feather or spear-like projections and surmounted by a crucifix and a portrait of Black Hawk holds a central position above the altar at Guid- ing Star Spiritual Church. It is both a focus for prayer and a dramatic backdrop for a Black Hawk service. 8. I am indebted to my colleague Patrick A. Polk for first bringing the strong phonetic similarity between Unkus and nkisi to my attention. One might also point out that Unkus is a comparatively well-known Native American character in Cooper's Last of the Mohicans. 9.

I conducted one year of research in 1970-71 on the history and political structure of Weh (which then had a population of approximately 5,000) and returned several times in the fol- lowing years. In 1983-84, I spent another year in Weh, this time studying the implications of multiple legal systems for individuals, who took their cases to different court systems. The research was supported by grants from the Deutsche Akademische Austauschdienst, the Max Planck Gesellschaft, and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft. I thank my friends and collaborators, in particular the late Mr. Andrew Kum and Mr. Joseph C. Mebeng, for guiding me and making it possible for me to photograph.
