HOOVER Mills College Federal taxes are to be reduced and the only questions before Congress and the American people are the extent and nature of the reduction. The discussion thus far shows three or four fundamental fallacies which will not down, though repeatedly exposed by every serious student of public finance. Among them are the following : First. It is contended that our internal debt, growing out of the Great War, should not be paid off too rapidly, as it was in- curred in part for future generations, who should share the burden. The error here arises frpm a misconception of what is in- volved in paying off an internal debt. When we tax ourselves for such a purpose.</page><page sequence="2">No. 6] MARCH, 1928 165 we merely take money from the pockets of the tax payers and hand it over to the bond holders, who are in part, the very people who pay the taxes, and, in any event, belong to the present generation. The bonds are destroyed, the tax payers are given tax receipts in an equivalent amount, there is no diminution of capital, nor of useful goods, nor of income; nothing is destroyed, nothing is gained, nothing is lost. What is then the nature of this burden involved in paying off our internal debt? While the taxes are being paid, it is true that the tax payers will have less money to spend, but the bond holders will have more and who is to say that money in the hands of the bond holders will not be as wisely and usefully expended as if left in the hands of the tax payers? In short, tax- ing ourselves to pay ourselves is no burden at all, if looked at from the standpoint of the entire American people, and, conse- quently, the talk of distributing a non- existent burden as between this and future generations is idle when it is not positively mischievous. Second. Politicians in Congress are asking for a lower rate on the smaller cor- porate incomes, claiming that the principle of progression should apply to taxes on corporations as well as individuals. This illustrates the fallacy which consists of thinking that corporations have tax-paying ability, apart from the stockholders. Law makers should learn, someday, that only persons pay taxes, - not things, nor prop- erty, nor this legal fiction known as a corporation. It is nothing more than a convenient way in which the law describes a group of individuals who own its stock; and taxes, nominally laid upon its income, are, in fact, born by the stockholders. Supposedly this reform is urged on the plea that poor corporations, as well as poor individuals, should be favored with lower rates. Corporations have indeed come to be very real things if they are now to be the objects of pity and envy. Demagogy has set a new mark in this anthropomorphic treatment of a fictitious, legal entity. The truth is, that even if one wanted to grant additional favors to those with lower incomes, there is no assurance at all that this plan will accomplish it. The poor are perhaps more disposed to pur- chase stock in a large public utility com- pany than they are in a plumbing shop or a small retail store. For this reason, it is doubtful if the proposal will do what its supporters think it will do, and so far, perhaps, so good. The real danger from the proposal to establish one rate on the smaller corpor- ate incomes and another rate on the larger ones, is that such a differential rate might tend to force an artificial disintegration of the business units, whose incomes are close to the border. Some corporations might find it advisable to dissolve in favor of two corporations whose net incomes would thus be small enough to carry the lower rate. A tax measure which would tend to create an artificial size of the cor- porate unit is to be deprecated. The proposal of Congress to lower the maximum rate on corporate incomes, is sound in theory. As corporations have no tax-paying ability, there never was any argu- ment for levying a tax on their incomes, except as a method of taxing their stock holders and collecting the tax at its source. There would be no objection to this pro- cedure except that such stoppage at source is absolutely incompatible with the appli- cation of the progressive principle. If the principle of exemption and progres- sion is sound, a flat rate on the income of corporations is unsound. Under the pres- ent law, even with the proposed amend- ments, an individual whose income is below the exemption point will pay, nevertheless, the corporate rate on the stock in which savings may have been invested, thus de- feating the purpose of exemption. Proposals to reduce or discontinue taxes on auto sales and admissions are perhaps more debatable. Such taxes are of course bitterly resented by auto manufacturers and theater managers, but if revenue is not se- cured in that way it must be secured in another, presumably by taxes on income. When one considers how simple and cer- tain these tax payments are, as well as the convenient times at which they are paid, and recalls that, by way of contrast, there are 13,000 cases still pending which involve taxes on incomes prior to 1920 and 740,000 cases involving taxes levied prior to 1925, it does not seem so certain that the income tax is superior to some of the taxes we are now abandoning.</page></plain_text>
