<plain_text><page sequence="1">A VERY LATE VICTORIAN By Edward Whiting Fox CC I 1 XPERIENCES," the most recent of Professor I—I Arnold J. Toynbee's many books is in effect the I J second volume (to "Acquaintances" published two years ago) of an autobiographical report. As the titles indicate, the earlier was focused on other people in the author's life, and this on his own development. Even taken together the two do not in any sense constitute a conven tional autobiography. If "Experiences" does begin with some of the author's early memories and progress more or less chronologically, at least through "Part I: Personal Affairs" (the first of three into which the work is divided) the "experiences" it records are largely intellectual. The few events recounted are mostly from his early childhood; his education at Wooton, Winchester, and Oxford, and above all his year in Greece, all leading to the overwhelming climax of "August 1914." His reflections on life, his own and that of his fellow humans in the twentieth century, which constitute "Part II: Human Affairs in My Life time . . will seem familiar to his previous readers. Only "Part III : Reflections," a brief collection of poems mostly in Greek, a few in Latin, and one or two in English, will seem new, and to most inaccessible as well. And yet, even though he adds relatively little detail to what he has already revealed about himself, Mr. Toynbee manages to bring our picture of his character and personality into a new sharper focus. About his day-to-day existence between the cataclysmic end of the nineteenth-century world into which he had been born, and his own retirement in the second half of the twen tieth century, he says almost nothing at all. Indirectly he tells us that he worked "compulsively" both at the "Survey Experiences. By Arnold Toynbee. Oxford University Press. $8.75.</page><page sequence="2">A VERY LATE VICTORIAN 679 of International Affairs" and "The Study of History." While it is easy to believe that either of these two enormous projects would have more than filled a working life, leaving little time for other activity, it would seem that either (let alone both) would also have provided its own intellectual adventure with constant problems to challenge his capacities and change his views. And yet no such struggles and devel opment are mentioned. Instead, Mr. Toynbee confides in us that, with the com pletion of the manuscript for "Some Problems of Greek History" (in 1966 when he was 77) he had finished his agenda, most of which had been drawn up just before, or just after, the First World War. The implications of this revelation would seem to be that he was fully formed by the Victorian world in which he grew up; and that he has spent his long reprieve from the sudden death in 1915 or 1916 that cut short the careers of so many of his contemporaries in completing the "written assignments" he had set himself when he decided never "to sit for another examination." The one distraction from his writing he willingly accepted was travel with its opportunities for reading man's history in his landscape and remains. His reports on these adventures have appeared in other volumes, but from this one we finally come to realize that he is in fact a visitor from the remote land of Victorian England come to study us in what he refers to as our "Brave New World." It is almost a moon trip in reverse, with our voyager from outer time wandering across our planet and through our days assimilating what he sees and pronouncing kindly but largely disapproving judgments on our achievements. This is not to imply, how ever, that he is unduly indulgent to his own old world by comparison. For its sins, it blundered into the First World War, thus committing suicide as well as mass murder. Even with that example before it, the postwar world deliberately repeated the criminal folly of launching another general war and capped it by creating atomic weapons; this last, he obvi ously fears, may prove to be mankind's ultimate undoing.</page><page sequence="3">680 THE VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW Read thus, "Experiences" seems less quaint and idiosyn cratic. No one since the disappearance of Victorian England (and indeed few before it) could hope to match the innate self-assurance of its élite. Lest Mr. Toynbee take offense, it should be added that, in his case at least, this self-assurance is not only utterly devoid of arrogance but morally balanced by an equivalent sense of obligation. Born to the intellectual (if not the financial) "purple" of what must have been, in relative terms, the richest, most powerful, and best educated society in human history, he can afford a candor about himself, as well as the rest of us, that to mere ordinary mortals is nothing short of breathtaking. Seen in this late Victorian context, Mr. Toynbee's two major works take on a new significance. The "Study of History" falls into place in the Huxley, Darwin traditions of evolution. Because by nature, Mr. Toynbee is both benevolent and optimistic (however desperately), the "Study" is a sombre Visio Beatificaas he believes history should be: a vision of man's progress toward his potential for good as well as evil. The "Survey" is the shocked Victorian survivor's clinical record of man's perilous course along what he calls a via dolorosa. Following the advice of "the best teacher [he] ever had," Mr. Toynbee has obviously tried "always to be articulate; . . . always to see the wood ; ... to proceed from the known to the unknown; and to take it for granted that a passage of Greek or Latin must make sense, and to recognize that, so long as it did not, one had certainly not yet got on the right track." That advice, applied to history by one of Mr. Toynbee's assurance, ability, diligence, and longevity trans lates naturally, perhaps inevitably, into his "Study of His tory." Always to see the wood, always to proceed from the known to the unknown, and to continue until it made sense are the three characteristics that have set Mr. Toynbee apart from the bulk of his professional colleagues and, in addition, set not a few of them against him. This apparent perversity in his manner of pursuing his tory inevitably makes his reader wonder why he turned his</page><page sequence="4">A VERY LATE VICTORIAN 681 magnificent preparation and purpose to its study; and as if anticipating the question, he answers that he was first attracted by the accident that he began learning it from his mother and was then drawn on by the possibility he saw of discovering something beyond its facts: "the nature and meaning of the mysterious Universe." Admitting that his quest could be pursued by other routes, he explains that history offered the most congenial one to him, perhaps be cause, in spite of his late nineteenth-century agnostic rejec tion of formal religions, he is attracted by the theology he believes implicit in any history. Resorting to terms he has long since made familiar, he reiterates his conviction that life, and therefore history, is a struggle between the con scious human being's innate self-centeredness, which is the source of all evil, and that same conscious self's capacity for self-sacrifice for love, which he believes is the highest possible human achievement. The most dangerous self-centeredness for him is still its collective form of nationalism, which he seems convinced is a peculiar product of the Judaic, Christian, and Islamic tra dition. This singularly provincial conclusion for a historian of his breadth of view leads him into the only vindictive judgment that mars this book. Because of its chronological precedence, he apparently lays the ultimate blame for na tionalism on ancient Israel; and then dismisses its modern heirs, and their struggle for survival, with intemperate and unbalanced censure. It is saddening to find one of such urbane understanding and pervasive kindliness so stub bornly uncharitable on this one point. However little sym pathy he, or we, may have for Zionism, we have the right to expect a more accurate appreciation of the historical origins of the tragic impasse in the Near East and a greater charity in considering the cruel dilemma by which these courageous survivors of the Nazi holocaust are caught. Mr. Toynbee's heretofore pervasive distrust of all West ern religions he now admits has been somewhat modified by the Oecumenical movement launched by Pope John XXIII.</page><page sequence="5">682 THE VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW Clearly he sees this as one of the most hopeful signs in an otherwise menacing situation, but even this ray of hope would seem to be half negated by his own confession of faith. In a strange theological excursion, he reduces the divine element in the universe to two warring powers of good and evil, comparable to the schizophrenic elements of human consciousness that have so long obsessed him. This Mani chean anthropomorphism, by irreparably dividing what he calls Ultimate Reality against itself, would appear to cut off all logical ground for hope. And yet Mr. Toynbee finally announces his involvement in, and hope for, if not quite faith in, the future. Faith for him, it gradually emerges, lies not in some abstract but omnipotent divinity, tainted as it would necessarily be with acts of gratuitous evil, but rather in the ultimate potential for good, concealed and imprisoned though it usually is, in man himself. In keeping with his Victorian upbringing, Arnold Toynbee has, we realize, tried to live with charity for the past and present, hope for the future, and faith only in the best he has seen in himself and in his fellow men. It is an awesome but inspiring challenge to which he has made a truly Victorian response.</page></plain_text>
