<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARMINE K. MORTIMER The Third Closet: Sollers's War In his essay "A travers le vingtieme siecle," Philippe Sollers wrote: "There are in fact three poorly resolved 'closets' in French politics: the period of 1940-44; the Algerian war; the explosion of 1968."1 He elab orated in "II suffit d'etre douze": First closet: 1940-1942. The weight of repression is absolutely phe nomenal. . . . Second closet: the Algerian war. At the time it was for bidden to speak of war. . . . First closet: a lie. Second closet: a lie. Let's try to see if for the third closet we aren't also right in the middle of a lie. That is the thesis I am continuing to argue.2 And in 2003, he called "May '68" the "specter" that continues to haunt French heads of state.3 May '68 is a specter because it has been put into the closet?hidden by lies?and only its ghost wafts about in the current atmosphere. It is a commonplace that France has long had difficulty dealing with the Occupation and the Algerian war, and there is nothing new about saying that the "solution" to this difficulty is the closet. The French placard contains these two immense skeletons. It is the place to store bad memories, safely out of sight and mind, before that knowl edge has been fully dealt with, or "liquidated," as Sollers wrote. His 1983 novel Femmes [Women), although rather terse about the third closet, recounts the first two in these terms: he says there are two key periods in the history of modern France: 1940-1942, which he calls "the great secret," and 1958-1962, which he calls "the discreet can 1.

Censorship, silence . . . Equivocation . . . ."4 The horrors of the Second World War marked Europeans?and they have been made to repress it: "Even a Frenchman has great difficulty in feeling it genuinely, viscerally ... We were 'protected'... But at what price!" (Women 236). The postwar policy of forgiveness protected the French from the continuing impression of horror, from the memory of shame, but at the price of a monstrous lie: "Truth is, since 1940 the French have been living in shame and self-hatred. . . . Can we call it a case of 'family secrets' on a miserable and massive scale? You can be sure of it. Survivors and descendents are doing everything they can to erase this ill-recognized guilt that is often scarcely suspected?stifled, rot ting, unspoken."5 If there is a social error that haunts Philippe Sollers, it is this need for the French to pretend these things did not happen. He will con stantly remind the world of the contrary. About Mai '68, Sollers says in the journal Tissage in 2005, that "anti-68 thinking starts as early as the seventies and has concluded in a generalized normalization in which money takes on its globalizing dimension" ("11 suffit d'etre douze" 16-17). He calls this normaliza tion a repression or "refoulement,"6 in an analysis that oddly coin cides with a view from the Right by Paul-Marie Couteaux writing in Le Figaro. In Lannee du tigre, Sollers refers us to Couteaux's "hate ful" article that appeared at the thirtieth anniversary of the events, in May 1998, in which we can read the following assertion: "Thus a movement purportedly from the Left has insured the perpetuation of the Right in France, and not just any Right: the political Right of money and media that has reigned since that time under different guises."7 What Couteaux said with smug irony, Sollers castigates?in particular, the reign of money and media?in all his writing since the early 1980s.8 Since that time, Sollers has striven to combat the third closet: France's lies about May '68 and its regression from it.

MORTIMER 171 "Who, for instance, would want to return to before '68? To be brought back to a buttoned-up country, strangled communication, conformism and fossilization of social behavior, complete discordance with tech nical progress and new desires."9 To counteract this regression, as he wrote in 2005, he "transposed" action into his 1982 novel, at a time when "the counter-offensive of mummification had already begun" ("II suffit d'etre douze" 17). It is this 1982 transposition that marks a turning point. In the sixties and seventies, Sollers was a beacon of the intellec tual Left and known chiefly for his activities in support of the avant garde. A brief list of the indications of his leftist leanings in that pe riod must include the Maoist chapter of the Tel quel group; Sollers's trip to China in the company of other telqueliens; his study and trans lation of Chinese poetry; his publication of leftist writers and the avant-garde in art and literature in the book series and journal called Tel quel at the Editions du Seuil; the publication of provocative texts about politically incorrect writers such as Pound and Celine, and writ ers of "la rupture," in Houdebine's expression, such as Bataille and Ar taud.10 Sollers's key texts of this time, from the mid-sixties to 1981, are the critical essays Sur le materialisme and Logiques and the five remarkable, difficult "novels" Drame, Nombres, Lois, H, and Paradis. Philippe Forest, one of the most perceptive of Sollers's readers, writes: "from Drame to Lois, the novel is formed in a geometric space of in creasing complexity, constructed and consumed at the same time in such a way as to bring forth a pure space of writing beyond any repre sentational purpose."11 This refusal of representational purpose char acterizes the Sollersian avant-garde. Then, in 1982, there occurs, mysteriously, what looks like an ide ological turn. Forest characterizes the moment as a turn away from the "new," an "old" new that remains like a nostalgic era to which Sollers clings and which H emblematizes: The history of all this is still being written . . . and ... it is telling us how the balance of power between modernity and tradition was reversed at the beginning of the eighties, how there occurred at that point a return 9.

This history also tells us how there was inaugurated an era of re gression, signaling the stifling of any authentic creation, its shipwreck into the Spectacular, etc., etc. ("Le nouveau est invincible" 97-98) It is noteworthy that Forest could produce this analysis in the context of a conference on Tel Quel and the avant-garde. The term "litterature de recherche" refers to the writers mentioned above, and others such as Joyce and Sollers himself, and their revolutionary effect in writing is comparable to the May '68 effect on social life. In the early eighties, then, there was a retreat to a situation in which any authentic creation was swept into the Spectacle.12 Forest is thus rather cynically describing a turn to the Right in the Tel quel context. A sharp observer of the scene, Forest relates the turn to May '68: "The trauma caused by Tel quel was so deep and so violent that in the eighties the response was the most complete censure. Philosophers ... and polemicists [denounced] the dic tatorship of the 'moderns/ bringing to light the theoretical impasse into which 'the thinking of 68' had plunged French culture."13 The question to ask about this key moment in French intellectual culture is: what is Sollers's position on such a turn to the Right and how do we place him in it? It is certain that something major hap pened in Sollers's trajectory at this moment, traceable in notable bi ographical details. He leaves the Editions du Seuil and moves to Gal limard, which, in Femmes, he wittily and tellingly calls "la banque centrale",-14 the last issue of Tel quel appears, having exhausted its mission,- he starts L'infini, which is published at Gallimard after a brief stint at Denoel; he writes Femmes, his first novel in a new "readable" style,- he publishes book-length interviews such as Le rire de Rome, La divine comedie, and Poker in which he tirelessly exposes his social thought; he continues to write essays collected in important volumes such as Improvisations, La guerre du gout, and Eloge de l'infini as well 12.

The free man is, of course, Philippe Sollers, and that autobio graphical claim is also the ultimate subject of the entire body of writ ing since Femmes, a remarkably consistent content in a wealth of ap parently or superficially different forms. WHAT IS MAY '68 FOR SOLLERS? Sollers's pessimism about society developed gradually in the post-May '68 decades. Late in 1976, Sollers speaks somewhat mildly of a re pression of and a regression from May '68: "The fact is, 1968 was for me the explosion in society of phenomena that had until then been considered marginal, hence coming from another culture. This will return, but I think today we are again in a period of regression, a phase of repression. That's what I feel. Until the next explosion."15 The op timism of "this will return" will disappear as time passes?particu larly with the anniversary commemorations every ten years. He is still optimistic in La part de verite, a 1977 television broadcast about Mau rice Clavel, where Sollers describes May '68 as a time when "speech resides in living mouths"?as opposed to the cadaverized language of other times.16 But by Portrait du joueur (1984), he has his narrator comment cynically that May '68, "the fun thing to do at the time," no longer exists at all.17 At the twentieth anniversary, his article "May '68" published in Uinfini and republished in La guerre du gout, brings the event into the most personal focus: "The woman I married, for instance, is 68. We understand each other implicitly about a thousand shattered things, we have definitively shared an experience of the here and now."18 A 15. Sollers and Edgar Faure, Au dela du dialogue.

At the thirtieth anniversary, reprising a paragraph from a publica tion that same year, he tells the editors of Ligne de risque: May '68 was a project and a conspiracy to attain the real. Having fun was in this case the most superficial aspect of the event. Nothing sud den: a long preparation engendered by society's own negation. Com munication showed how it could be interrupted. Distinctions between class, age, sex, and education became radically visible. So it was out of the question to rub shoulders with the next guy or treat him as if he were what we call a "loved one." Out of the question, as well, to imag ine the unfamiliar as being in the least familiar. Contrary to the eter nal, tenacious dream of the petite bourgeoisie, non-community became admissible at last. (Poker 69, same text in "Reponses aux 'Cahiers du cinema'") If this language seems particularly categorical, it is because Sollers was responding to terms that were Blanchot's in La communaute in avouable in a point by point reversal, leading to his final sentence with its refusal of community, of shared purpose and action. In the same vein, he wrote in "II suffit d'etre douze," in 2005: "May '68 was not made for togetherness but for being outside a completely smothering togetherness,- that is how singularities appeared multiple" (28). Action was not political but rather social and especially individual. Social ef fects were undone; only the individual ones remain. In May 2008, when I asked Sollers what he considered the advances or gains of May '68, he told me: "what France gained or lost does not interest me especially. What interests me is the individual adventure, because I believe that '68 . . . Apart from the individual adventures that it may have produced, one falls back on a political or politicizing discourse that, for me, is not very important."19 But he also accentu ates the very favorable period just before 1968, after the end of the Al gerian war, where society "radiates" and freedom is gained, in partic ular sexual freedom?before the punishment of the "annees de plomb" of the seventies (Interview 2008).20 Thus Sollers comes to stress the personal and individual experi ence of May '68. What May '68 won is the freedom not to be part of a 19. Sollers, interview by Armine Kotin Mortimer, Paris, May 17, 2008. 20.

MORTIMER 175 community and to proclaim that freedom loudly and without shame. That, to my understanding, is a foundational ingredient in the turn to a new style in 1982-1983. WHAT TURNED IN 1982? "I have always said, and am ready to say it again as often as necessary, I belong to the Left, absolutely, without hesitation or reservation! There! ... So why is it that no one really quite believes me? Why do I yet again have the feeling people think I belong to the Right?" (Women 416-17). The character who speaks these words is the narrator-protagonist of Femmes, purportedly an American journalist by the name of Will living in France?but otherwise an image of the author. The question they raise, in a devious manner, may well be asked about Sollers in 1982. That there was a before and an after in regard to May '68 is a com monplace: French society changed in several levels, and many com mentators, Sollers among them, have expressed a range of opinions. For Sollers, the after is characterized by an "affaissement general (gen eral collapse)," as he said in Poker (48). The country took a "turn to the Right," visible in what Sollers quite recently claimed to be the most generalizable effect of May '68. Speaking in a May 2007 television pro gram on France 2 called Esprits Fibres, Sollers rhetorically asks who lost in 1968.21 Not the Right, the Republic, or the foundation of the French state, but the Communist Party, attacked on all sides, bom barded in its quarters, the vociferation of its voice liquidated once and for all. A more metaphorical version of the same opinion is found in Femmes in this form: "A high-speed train with the Stalin carriage un coupled . . . He's in quarantine . . ." (Women 356). May '68 sticks like a fishbone in the throat of the historical imposture of Stalinism, he says on France 2. Against his adversary in this dialogue, Luc Ferry, Sollers emphasizes that May '68 was not a communist movement? and to call communism a historical imposture is certainly to take his distance from it. With rich irony, and a measure of insight, Sollers in 2007 predicts that Sarkozy is dreaming of provoking another May '68: "Sarkozy is going to put all his talent, all his energy, into producing a new May '68, through a generalized conformism: work, family, profit. May '68 is tomorrow" (Esprits libres). Provocative as always, Sollers 21. Espiits libres, television program on France 2, May 11, 2007.</page><page sequence="8">176 Yale French Studies makes himself hard to pinpoint?and I note in passing that such pos turing illustrates his self-proclaimed freedom. In Sollers's opus, this diagnosis of a turn to the Right after May '68 takes a highly personal form. If the before was the avant-garde, war is the term I would propose for the after. La guerre, as Sollers insists, is simply a continuation of the avant-garde by other means: since 1982, Sollers has spread his war farther and wider. To reach a wider audi ence was a strong motivation for his change of style in 1982. The most important of the cluster of events around 1982, as he told me, was his change of publisher, which also means a change of em ployer, because Sollers is an editor as well as a writer (Interview 2008). In Portrait du joueur he describes this change as taking his war into the opposite camp: "I did have to go over to the other side . . . Make war . . ." (18). A key moment comes after the publication in 1981 of the first volume of Paradis (much longer than the second published in 1986). The closeness in time between the first appearance of Paradis as a book and the publication of Femmes accentuates the turn: Paradis reaches an acme, a culmination of the revolution in language that grew progressively through the five novels of rupture; the revolution is realized as fully as possible in Paradis. From then on, starting with the first novel published by Gallimard, Femmes, Sollers's novels aban don abstruse structuralist, text-based programs, geometrical permu tations, and punctuation-free writing, choosing instead their famously readable style. On the face of it, this means a change in style that now accommodates narrative (vs. textual) design, plot, characters, chronol ogy, as well as narrator and narrative discourse. The greatest of these changes appears in the narrator and his dis course. A story is told with a beginning, a middle, and an end, in the familiar Jamesian paradigm. One finds a plot and subplots. Characters act in them and are described by their psychology, intentions, moti vations, hair color, sexual behavior. Events can be arranged in a co herent chronology. Or, as the first page of Femmes puts it: "There'll be details, local color, one scene after another, mix-ups, mesmerism, psy chology, orgies" [Women 3). But what most characterizes the novels since 1982 is the central focus on the autobiographical narrator, a mul tiple portrait of Sollers whose discourse enfolds the novels in their en tirety. An omnipresent and masterful self, Sollers speaks in his own voice, not in the voice of an ensemble, as he did during the most char acteristic moments of Tel quel. All the novels are about Sollers, just as the voice that speaks in his essays is his,- his theory is his own,- his</page><page sequence="9">ARMINE K. MORTIMER 177 reference points are no longer other textual theorists, such as Derrida or Kristeva, but poets and writers: Dante, Rimbaud, Holderlin, Niet zsche, and others. The novels combine events, especially sexual ones, with highly individualistic philosophical essays and reflective dia logues, thus recreating the form of Sade's novels. Sexual freedom is predominant in the novels from Femmes for ward. Although sexuality was not absent from the avant-gardist works, and a sexual relation between an adolescent and a woman of thirty was the root of Une curieuse solitude, his first novel, the shock of the novel published in 1983 came in large measure, if one believes the reaction in the press, from its free-flowing sexuality and the lav ish laying on of sexual relations between the narrator-protagonist and about a dozen women. Portrait du joueur (1984) forced the point home, with its stunning passages describing in detail the programmed sexual relations between the narrator-protagonist and Sophie. Le cceur ahsolu (1987) spreads the free-flowing sexuality to a group of five, and the notebooks of the hero, written in code, record his sexual exploits; the narrator deciphers them in detail. Les folies frangaises (1988) flaunts a sexual relationship between the narrator-protagonist and his eighteen-year-old daughter, France. Le lys dyor (1989) describes a pact between the narrator-protagonist and a high-class woman that runs on sexual tension and culminates in a weekend climax. And so on. Sexual relations abound in all the readable novels. Simply put, sexual freedom is the barometer of freedom in general. Sollers does not hesitate to ground his personal freedom in May '68: "The fact is, I was able to deploy a supplementary freedom that was very personal through all that. The rest, for me anyway, is finally with out interest" (Interview 2008). His terse reply to the Cahiers du cinema in 1988 said the same: May '68 brought him "a redoubled free dom."22 But do these changes, and these themes, constitute a "turn," for Sollers? Critics may have insisted on the break between the five avant garde novels and the ones from 1983 on, but for Sollers there is conti nuity, a continuity that lies in the fight against the Spectacle. If Drame, Nombres, Lois, H, and Paradis are the voice, a contrario, of the Spectacle, "one might believe," Sollers wrote in his 1989 Garnet 22. Sollers, "Mai 68. Reponses aux 'Cahiers du cinema'," L'infini 62 (Summer 1998): 8. In 2008, Sollers considers this one-page text significant enough to reproduce it in the complete index of the first hundred issues of L'nfini, published as L'infini 101-102 (spring 2008).</page><page sequence="10">178 Yale French Studies de nuit, "that Femmes, Portrait du joueur, Le cocur absolu, Les folies frangaises are the only novels with a systematic critique of the inte grated spectacle."23 Thus what may appear as a turn, with the change in style, masks a continuity that for Sollers at least is important. That the turn from avant-garde to war means continuity for Sollers receives further explanation in commentary on Tel quel by the critic most qualified to comment, Philippe Forest, author of Histoire de Tel quel. His description of the change is laced with irony: "Those who praise the adventuresome rigor of Tel quel generally condemn the fu tile regression toward commercial literature or critical impressionism in Uinfini. Those who salute in Uinfini the most vital of journals today sometimes do a bad job of hiding their relief that the Tel Quel page has been turned."24 Of course Forest's purpose is to insist on the con tinuity, especially in terms of a movement forward, between Tel quel and Uinfini. Sollers portrays himself in the character S. in Femmes quoting Joseph de Maistre and proclaiming loudly his adherence to a classical style, while his double, Will, questions: "So where does that leave the avant-garde, modernity, the whole area to which he is usually con signed?" (Women 74). I take this as a subtle affirmation of the change in style for this book?and at the same time, a provocative claim to continuity. "[S. has] always wanted to indulge his classical talents . .. It's a rest from his hazy modern opera" (a periphrastic description of Paradis) (Women 341). As for Sollers himself, the continuity he claims lies not in the claim to be classical even in his radical experimentation with the French language, as in Lois and Paradis, but rather in the con tinuation of the war by other means, starting with Femmes. That there is continuity in content if not in means or methods he has reaffirmed recently: "There is a perfect coherence between Paradis and Femmes. It's just?I felt the need to make the content explicit" (Interview 2008). To make the content explicit?to bring the war into the open ?thus identifies the change. On the topic of May '68, the discretion of Femmes might be con sidered rather surprising. One finds a few references, for the most part allusive or off-handed: "The good old days, 1968, if you can call it 23. Sollers, Carnet de nuit (Paris: Plon, 1989), 29. 24.

(Women 83); 'The old topics of the '60s and '70s ... '68 ..." (195). May '68 has no obvious relation to the explosion that kills Cyd near the end of the book; the police investigation suggests such a cause, but it is dismissed: "Were you involved in political movements of the extreme Left ten years ago?" Reply: "It's been a thing of the past for ages now" (492; similar passage on 293). My sense is that in 1982, Sollers's preoccupation with the manifestations of the third closet had not yet reached the pitch it would attain when continuing commem orations every ten years encrusted May '68 with more and more lies. Moreover, the before-after typology in Sollers's opus does not have the abruptness that characterizes the common view of May '68. One cannot describe the change in Sollers's writing as a moment. The turn to Sollers's Right occurs in segments. During the first half of the eight ies, Sollers continues to produce Paradis (which began to appear in Tel quel in 1974) and to publish it, now in L'infini; the second volume, much shorter than the first, comes out in 1986, at Gallimard as op posed to Seuil; videos produced during this period with the videogra pher Jean-Paul Fargier continue the textual experimentation into the visual domain, an important evolution that will influence Sollers's later writing. Femmes carries the banner forward: the fresco of the human being's misfit in the world and society's flattening effect con tinues from Lois and restates, in different language, the themes of Par adis. In the background, Paradis continues,- but after the 1986 publi cation, nothing new in that vein appears, in spite of the fact that Sollers proclaims that Paradis continues without end. He told me this in 2003. More publicly, but perhaps more ambiguously, in 2005 he wrote of the 1972 Lois that it prepares Paradis, "where things go on to infinity, with no other end than my own" (Poker 141; this interview dates from 2002). Largely because of this claim, I have described Par adis as the basso ostinato of his obsession?but there is no longer any printed manifestation of it. The absence of this avant-garde manifes tation, last seen in 1986 when two "figurative" novels had already been published, must certainly be counted as another indication of a turn, in spite of Sollers's creditable claim that what he did to language with Paradis will finish only with his death. "Figurative" is the adjective that others have used to describe the difference in the writing of the novels starting with Femmes. Andre S. Labarthe in the 1998 television film Philippe Sollers, L'isole absolu, for the series "Un siecle d'ecrivains," speaks of the productive vein of</page><page sequence="12">180 Yale French Studies what he calls Sollers's "romans figuratifs (figurative novels)," begun with the spectacular "changement a vue (visible change)" of 1983.25 And in Femmes, the autobiographical narrator, one of the "Multiple Related Identities" (or MRIs) of the author, uses the adjective "figura tive" with the off-hand comment, "Not all Picasso's paintings were cubist" (Women 59). The war continues in his figurative writing, in which the theme of freedom and its stylistic expression focalize what is for Sollers the war against the closet of May '68. THE ADVENTURE OF LANGUAGE "I always see events through language and not as if events determined the language" (Interview 2008). Sollers quite spontaneously spoke these words, in response not to a question about his writing or his relation to language, but in reply to a general question: what has May '68 brought to you, and to France, that has since been lost? The turn in Sollers is a specific reaffirmation of the relation to language. Sollers readily affirms that his only guide and compass are his writing?what he is writing at any given moment; he has reiterated that he always coincides with his writing. Since at least Jean Ricardou's formulation opposing the adventure of language to the language of an adventure, novels of the avant-garde, including the range of phenomena known as the nouveau roman, were consid ered to have abandoned the language of an adventure?plot, story, etc. ?in favor of the adventure of language: language had become the topic of the novel. This opposition can be updated to mark the change from the avant-garde to the "pleine guerre" [all-out war] in Sollers's work. As of 1982, experimentation with language seems to cease,- or as For est suggests, textual writing became saturated with Lois and perhaps could go no deeper ("Le nouveau est invincible" 100). But Sollers would rather claim that textual writing goes under ground; experimentation with language becomes more subtle with Femmes. The adventure of language has taken a different form. As re cently as 2005, Sollers, invoking Heidegger, grants to language the abil ity to escape absolute anthropomorphism, thus allowing spontaneous revolution,- the writer has the ability to create the language of this rev elation, as he calls it: "I'm keeping the word 'revelation' to indicate that what society buries, a writer can bring to light" (Poker 111). Sim ilarly, in 1977, in speaking about Maurice Clavel, with whom Sollers 25. Philippe Sollers, L'isole absolu, film by Andre S. Labarthe, 1998.</page><page sequence="13">ARMINE K. MORTIMER 181 published a dialogue, Delivrance, Sollers had asserted: "As best I can, I pursue an experiment in the depths of language which is an experi ence of truth in writing" (La part de verite). Clearly Sollers considers that his writing both before and after has this anti-closet power of rev elation, a claim he makes explicitly in Poker: after Heidegger, he has tried to "think and consider simultaneously and in a lively manner everything that has been said and thought in the language that I speak," and he cites as examples not only Paradis but also the 1997 novel Studio and his collection of essays, La guerre du gout [Poker 78). Ultimately, change is observable on a superficial level; the content to which Sollers points remains his writing, his relationship to lan guage, including the signal importance of the vocal expression. FREEDOM AND THE PILE OF BOOKS In 1998, Sollers chose not to grant an interview to Les cahiers du cinema, and his written response to their questions, which he pub lished, merely says that May '68 brought him "une liberte redoublee." To those to whom he does choose to answer, he will of course give the same message: "My books constantly bear witness to this way of liv ing, which must be described as . . . very free. As free as possible" ("11 suffit d'etre douze" 16). Similarly, with Philippe Labro, in the televised program Ombre et lumiere in 2002, asked to define himself, Sollers simply replies "a free man."26 Yet people are not necessarily "getting it." Sollers complains most frequently that people are not reading his books. This complaint has taken many forms and appears in novels as well as essays. In a May and June 1983 interview published in Le rire de Rome, Sollers de scribes what he perceives as a censuring of Femmes, saying: "The main effect has always consisted in an obliteration of all the female portraits, in a general putting forth of the 'anti-feminist7 theme and in the accent placed on the male portraits."27 Speaking with me in May 2008, he still emphasizes exactly the same censure: his women have been put into the closet. The content is there?and ignored. Nor is this effect limited to a simple turning away of the majority from the stack of his books, which Sollers indicates with an expressive gesture 26.

It is as if the twenty-five years of Uinfini did not exist, as if his stack of books did not exist, he says with palpable irony. What is it about the content of a "readable" book like Femmes that is not grasped by the reading public? In his own quirky way, Michel Houellebecq pinpointed the problem parodistically in Les particules elementaires. Bruno first confuses the name of Sollers with a brand of mattresses, then tries to read: "he tried immersing himself in Une curieuse solitude, gave up pretty quickly, succeeded nevertheless in reading a few pages of Femmes ?especially the sex scenes"?and even those passages do not sit well with him: "reading Femmes gave living proof: the only women [Sollers] succeeded in screwing were the old whores from the cultural set; the chicks obviously preferred singers."28 It is a minor and ironic point that old whores and young chicks are no tably absent from the cadre of women in Femmes. Houellebecq's Bruno can only be an ironic guide for the alert reader, but in the very exag geration of this parody he drives home the point that the content is misread. And that is Sollers's chief complaint today. Freedom?his per sonal freedom?has been put into the closet, along with May '68 and the other cadavers. The censure, active repression, and even hatred of which he is the object amount to a closet of falsification that Sollers, inverting the usual expression, scathingly calls "the closet in the ca davers" (Interview 2008). To call his falsifiers "cadavers" is to take the defensive war into the offensive realm. Against such misreaders, Sollers again asserts his freedom. In the Labarthe film, Sollers speaks of his books, his purpose in writing, the strength of the self that comes out in the writing. He refers to all his writing as "One single book, actually, one single voice." If instead of diagnosing a superficial turn to his Right we reread everything to discover how all the works speak, deeply, fundamen tally, with the same voice, we will see how the war continues. Sollers writes even now with his fountain pen and blue ink, fighting to keep his war out of the closet, and shunning the computer screen, because, as he says, "Everything's written with sound, with the internal voice" (Interview 2008). 28.
