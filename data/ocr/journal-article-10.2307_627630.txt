<plain_text><page sequence="1">Types of Ancient Egyptian Statuary, I. By B. HORNE- MANN. Copenhagen: Munksgaard, 1953. Pp. xi + 315 unbound plates in case. Dan. kr. Ioo. This work consists of a pasteboard filing-cabinet containing more than three hundred numbered cards, each about 71 in. by 41 in., on which are reproduced by a collotype process outline sketches, mostly in pencil, of selected Egyptian statues from various collections. This particular 'volume' is the first part of the work to be issued, and is concerned with statues of males only. It is broadly divided into two categories-statues with feet placed together and those with the left foot advanced. Both groups are further subdivided according to the position of the hands. Inscriptions are summarily sketched merely to indicate their location on the statue. Little detail is in fact intended; most faces, for instance, are rendered as featureless masks. Each card gives at least two aspects of a particular piece, and some have several views and two or three cross-sections. A brief index lists the various groups according to their poses. The term ' statuary ' has been broadly interpreted to include specimens which are not normally regarded as the work of the sculptor. There are, for instance, some seventy-five cards concerned with the mass-produced votive bronzes of the Late Period; some twenty others deal with shawabti figures in various materials; six are of pottery figurines, mostly of pre- dynastic date, and two are of anthropomorphic alabaster vessels. Even more surprise may perhaps be felt that a number of cards should be devoted to such objects as glazed amuletic figurines of deities and the crude little wax images of the Four Sons of Horus which protected the wrapped viscera in later dynastic burials. Perhaps it is the inclusion of such specimens that has dictated the omission of some notable examples such as the striding statues of Senusret I from Karnak, the earliest complete royal statues of this type, the unusual standing statue of Senen- mut at Chicago, the Amarna king at Brooklyn with his unique standing pose, the Anen of Turin, the gold Amun at New York, the Tuthmosis III from Medamud, to name a few at random-- the list could be greatly expanded. Within the limits set by Schiifer's original scheme for a typo- logical study of Egyptian statuary, Miss Hornemann appears to have carried out her task with diligence, but the reviewer of this work must constantly ask himself whether such industry has been well spent. Miss Hornemann's outline drawings, competent as they may be, cannot convey subtleties of style nor precision of detail. If collotype was to be used as a means of reproduction, one asks whether photographs, supplemented with line drawings where necessary, would not have served the purpose better. The chief criticism of this work, however, must be that it has remarkably little use. The general public flutter- ing through the cards will seek in vain for any appreciation of the true character of Egyptian statuary; to the philolo- gists, by now the greater proportion of professional Egyptolo- gists, it is irrelevant; the archaeologist uses different tools, and depends upon data other than poses for the dating and identi- fication of statues; and the few serious students of Egyptian art-history will still have to fall back upon their own records, compilations, and evaluations of Egyptian art forms, since Miss Hornemann's summary drawings cannot assist any stylistic analyses.
