<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOUL AND SELF IN THE NEXT WORLD: THE PARADOX OF THE PERFECTED SUBJECT David Williams I am not my soul. St. Thomas Aquinas Christianity, while promising the faithful eternal existence in the com- pany of God after death, also urges the renunciation of self as necessary for earning such everlasting life; we must abjure not only the flesh, but intellect, language, and consciousness as well. The self must disappear entirely to make room for the infusion of the divine. The resulting conun- drum is obvious: if I must obliterate the self in order to exist forever, what is the nature of the identity of the evacuated being who lives eternally? Is there any subject remaining at all after the successful purification of "selfness?" If so, in what does the redeemed creature's individuation and agency inhere? The principal mediaeval discourses that contribute to this question are Christian mysticism, scholastic theology, and poetry. Mysticism empha- sized personal renunciation and apophasis, while scholastic theology pur- sued a more cataphatic and rational analysis of the problem. The literary engagement of the idea, working with the freedom of poetry as well as its constraints, provided an intersection for the mystical and logical visions in which the Christian solution to the aporia of life after death is seen in the poetic integration of mystical and philosophical language. Here I will examine some of the meditations of the leading mediaeval mystics on the nature of the self and the afterlife, as well as Saint Thomas Aquinas' analysis of the same question. I will then discuss the great English poem Pearl, the subject of which is the next world, in order to indicate the coming together of both mystical and logical discourses. R&amp;L31A (Spring 1999) 117</page><page sequence="2">118 Religion &amp; Literature In one of his favorite images Saint Paul dissipates individual identity, both in this life and the next, in favor of the unity to be found in the earthly community of believers, a unity giving rise to the concept of the Mystical Body existing both on earth as the Church militant and in heaven as the Church triumphant, and in the union of the soul with Christ in the afterlife: There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ (Galatians 3:28). If I am neither male nor female, if I retain no national or racial distinction and my personal status is obliterated, am I still me? If all distinctions are to be replaced in the next world by a mystical absorption into the One, how is it possible to understand, let alone believe in, a personal, on-going existence after death? Mediaeval representations of the next world, both literary and theologi- cal, put forth a variety of answers to the fundamental paradox contained within the Christian proposition that we live eternally as distinct agents in an ontological condition purified of difference. Modern philosophy has not foreclosed the question. Criticizing contemporary views of the afterlife as a lugubrious existence without new experience or communication with others, John J. Clarke articulates the problem: "It is not intuitively obvious that the survival of my bare capacity to remember and to contemplate constitutes the survival of what could properly be called 'me'" (217). To the question, "Can we offer an account of survival... which allows for persons, not shadows or memories, to survive, and which makes such survival worthwhile," Clarke responds that mystical language, functioning as a kind of Kantian schema by giving imaginary content to the concept, allows us to speak of the unknown in terms of the known (220). The language of this imaginary content of the concept was provided for the West through the work of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite who, writing in the fifth century, profoundly and permanently influenced the entire theological vision of Christianity, including the views of those who had little sympathy for mysticism. His system was based squarely on the proposition that consciousness of the self and the anthropocentrism of human intellection were the principal obstacles to union with God, and that the beginning of transcendence toward the next world was in nega- tion: denial of the human constructs of language, denial of illusory desires, denial of the self. To his beloved disciple, Timothy, he declared: "By an undivided and absolute abandonment of yourself and everything, shed- ding all and freed from all, you will be uplifted to the ray of the divine shadow which is above everything that is" [Mystical Theology, 1000A, 135). Not only is the self to disappear in the afterlife, but the beatific vision gained thereby is itself negative: "It is not soul or mind, nor does it possess</page><page sequence="3">DAVID WILLIAMS 119 imagination, conviction, speech, or understanding. Nor is it speech per se, understanding per se. It cannot be spoken of and it cannot be grasped by understanding.. . . It has no power, it is not power, nor is it light. It does not live nor is it life" {Mystical Theology, 1045D-1048A, 141). The formidable difficulty of describing the vision of such a reality did not daunt the mediaeval followers of Pseudo-Dionysius. One of the great- est of mediaeval mystics, the early 14th century Dominican known as Master Eckhart, is particularly insistent on the need for the total annihila- tion of the self so as to be able "to know" God. The perfected self is a "wilderness" alienated from itself and from every other reality (120). Beyond self-alienation, salvation requires total obliteration of the self, an event expressed in Eckhart's image of the birth of God within the person. The possibility of the Divinity's coming to life within us is realized through our personal destruction, a violent death that, in fact, we have always yearned for. Eckhart expresses this desire for self-destruction in a powerful metaphor of death by lightning: "When it [a thunderbolt] strikes to kill, whether it is a tree or an animal or a person, at the coming of the blow, they all turn toward it and if a person's back were turned, he would instantly turn to face it" (122). The frequency of images of death and life in Master Eckhart's language points to a fundamental distinction in his thought between life and Being. The death of life permits Being to enter fully into the subject, suggesting that the individuation of the subject is a limiting effect of life, while death makes possible an existence in Being in which the subject is annihilated along with the subjectivities and distinctions of all other beings. In a sermon entitled "Distinctions are lost in God," Eckhart goes so far as to say that the reward for self denial is that we become God (204)! As with many mystics, the metaphoricity of Master Eckhart's language alarmed more orthodox thinkers, and the apparent pantheism contained in such imagery caused him to have to answer charges of heresy. But, like other mystics, Eckhart often seems to withdraw in one place what he asserts in another. In his sermon "Eternal Birth," he confronts the apparent contradiction of a self without self-consciousness: "What is the point," demands the Master's imaginary interlocutor, "of my mind exist- ing if it is to be quite empty and without function?" Rather than dissolving the paradox, the Master's answer reinforces it; the darkness into which he urges the mind to enter is a kind of death in which the self both exists and does not exist: "It has no name other than 'potential sensitivity', and it neither lacks being nor does it want to be" (1 19-20). Eckhart's naming of this death of self as 'potential sensitivity' is curious since it suggests that the desired state of perfected being, in as much as it is sentient, is somehow</page><page sequence="4">1 20 ReMon &amp; Literature physical - an important idea that scholastic philosophy had developed not long before Eckhart's metaphoric expression of it. The English author of the Cloud of Unknowing, writing only a few years after Master Eckhart and, like his German counterpart, heavily influenced by Pseudo-Dionysius as well as by Aquinas, offers similar views on the nature of the afterlife and the correct preparation for it. The 'Cloud' of the title is a darkness into which the self must enter so as to forget everything it has ever known, to cease all intellectual activity, and to refine the self out of existence. The Cloud-author is anti-rationalist and, employing the methods of negative theology, warns his readers against what we call today 'constructivism': "Whoever hears or reads about all this, and thinks that it is fundamentally an activity of the mind, and proceeds to work it all out along those lines, is on quite the wrong track. He manufactures an experi- ence that is neither spiritual nor physical. He is dangerously misled and in real peril" (65). This problem of experience as "neither spiritual nor physical" is perennial. Discussing the Critique of Practical Knowledge, Thandeka identifies the major failures of Kant's philosophy as the epistemising of reality and the inability to conceive of the self as "embodied": The unity of the thinking subject had not guaranteed a necessary link of the subject's subjective thoughts to the actual objective relations entailed in the con- tent of empirical knowledge. This disparity between subjective and objective knowledge sundered the self. The thinking self had no guarantee that its knowl- edge of itself as part of the world of sense actually corresponded to the self's objective reality as part of that empirical sensate world. The self had no guarantee that it had a body. (60) The mediaeval solution is to put away all rational thought and all memo- ries through meditation so that then the self, too, can be transcended: "See to it that there is nothing at work in your mind or will but only God. Try to suppress all knowledge and feeling of anything less than God, and trample it down under the Cloud of forgetting. You must understand that in this business you are to forget not only all other things than yourself (and their doings - and your own!) but to forget also yourself" (Cloud, 1 10). But it is not the true self that is abandoned, it is the self constructed of images, ideas, memories, and desires. The reason why it cannot remain, the Cloud- author explains, is that self-consciousness objectifies the self, making it just another object of knowing, both theoretical and empirical. Such objectifi- cation is the cause of self-alienation, a kind of schizophrenia that in epistemising the self separates us from everything we know and desire, even as it gives us a kind of skewed access to those things. The anxiety that such alienation causes is overcome only when we cease verbalizing and intellectualizing the world and ourselves:</page><page sequence="5">DAVID WILLIAMS 121 So crush all self-knowledge and experience of all forms of created things, and of yourself above all. For it is on your own self-knowledge and experience that the knowledge and experience of everything else depends.... You will find that when all other things and activities have been forgotten (even your own) there still remains between you and God the stark awareness of your own existence. And this awareness, too, must go before you experience contemplation in its perfection. (Ill) It is clear here that what stands between God and the soul is this objectified self, a persistent difficulty throughout human history. Catherine Pickstock, in a recent, masterful critique of post-modernism, has described the para- doxical situation in which the contemporary self absorption of the "lin- guistic turn" leads to nihilism and self-loathing. This is the same catastro- phe that the Cloud-author and all of his mystic brothers and sisters have perceived and warned against: The logical outcome of an immanentist ontology where epistemology is para- mount is, as we have seen, the reduction of being to the "object" whose existence does not exceed the extent to which it is known by the subject. Thus the subject assumes the status of that which confers existence upon reality. But we have also seen that the subject's realm of operation contains contradictory and nihilistic aspects. (Pickstock, 70) The elimination of this objectification is the "death" that both Eckhart and the Cloud-author urge on us. And thus there are two deaths: in the first the limitations of self-fashioning are transcended; this permits the second death in which the true self comes into being. To express the same idea more paradoxically (and thus more truly), death is life and life is death, for in the demise of the objectified self, a true subject is born. Pickstock sees the post-modern as having lost the mystical unity of this concept and thus created a binarism of life and death in which each side of the opposition is conceived in the most reductive manner: life is the attainment of posses- sion and power and the constant gratification of desire; death is the cessation of such yearning and thus the annihilation of the real. Her clarification of two kinds of death illuminates the mediaeval mystical sense of dying into life: Modernity less seeks to banish death, than to prise life and death apart in order to preserve life immune from death in pure sterility. For in seeking only life, in the form of a pseudo-eternal permanence, the 'modern' gesture is secretly doomed to necrophilia, love of what has to die, can only die. In seeking only life, modernity gives life over to death, removing all traces of death only to find that life has vanished with it. And so there is a nihilistic logic to this necrophiliac gesture, this sacrificing of life to a living death so as to ensure that when death arrives to unmask life of its tinsel, he finds only the presence of absence, life reduced to the deathliness of eauivalence. (104)</page><page sequence="6">1 22 Relimon &amp; Literature The aporia of the subjectivity of the negated self is nowhere sharper than in the Cloud of Unknowing where, despite the dionysian presence of nega- tion, the emphasis is ontological. There is a state of being, the Cfoud-author declares, that retains the self in a purified form free of the debilitating cerebral self-consciousness that separates the self from itself. This idea is most economically contained in his lesson that what must be discovered is "not what thi-self is, bot that thi-self is!" Clifton Wolters, translator of the Cfoi&amp;Z-author's works, distinguishes the Christian writer's metaphysics from that of Eastern thought: This is no Buddhist "annihilation" or Zen "satori". Though the soul is seeking to divest itself of "self", offering it up to God in love (for "this is the trewe condicion of a parfit lover") yet in fact it does not "coveit for to un-be," but to be rid of the conscious knowledge of being, "until", as Keeble would say, "in the ocean of thy love we lose ourselves." (Cloud, 155) Nevertheless, the metaphor of the loss of oneself in God's love seems merely to pose the problem in another way. If consciousness of self is lost, what is the nature of the subject who remains? It is certainly reasonable to question the existential reality of such being, as we have seen philosopher John J. Clarke do, for instance. Indeed, the Cfowrf-author, too, was obliged to address the problem by writing a further treatise, the Epistle of Privy Council, to explain to an anxious reader how one can transcend the self and remain an autonomous subject. His explanation is one largely shared by other mystics of the Middle Ages but one first formulated in the more analytical discourse of the scholastics, as we shall see. In the Vision of God, Nicholas of Cusa develops a complex image that centers principally not on man's contemplation of God, but rather on God's omnivoyant gaze which gives being to all that it envelopes. Writing a century after the CfowdP-author, Cusa works under the same intellectual and spiritual influences, especially Pseudo-Dionysius and Augustine, on the one hand, and Aquinas on the other. The gaze that is the center of Cusa's symbolism is both God's vivifying regard of man and the beatific vision accorded to the redeemed in heaven. Since, as Nicholas asserts, God is His vision, the ultimate revelation of the Vision of God is that heavenly life is the meeting of the gaze of God and that of man: "Each face, then, that can look upon Thy face beholdeth not other or differing from itself, because it beholdeth its own true type" (24). The mirror action of God's divine face may suggest at first the absorption of the individual into the One, a loss of selfhood that echoes Eckhart's proto-pantheism. But it can equally suggest an anthropocentrism in which God is appropriated to the self whose subjectivity is universalized. In this sense, God is merely a concept reflect-</page><page sequence="7">DAVID WILLIAMS 123 ing "me" - a construct of human intellect and language. Such relativism seems to lurk in Cusa's words: "He, then, who looketh on Thee with loving face will find Thy face looking on himself with love, and the more he shall study to look on Thee with greater love, by so much shall he find Thy face more loving. He who looketh on Thee in wrath shall in like manner find Thy face wrathful" (24). Cusa's vision is, however, neither an anthropomorphism nor a panthe- ism but, rather, a thoroughly orthodox - if mystical - concept of the relation of the utterly transcendent God and the individuated human agent. Each man, explains Nicholas, finds his own "face" in the "Face" of God, the youth finds a young face, the man a mature face, the aged an old face; but this subjectivity is then transcended by passing beyond the self image one first finds in contemplation. Rising above oneself is described as entering a cloud, a mist, a darkness (26). In a key chapter on alterity, Cusanus explains somewhat more clearly than his fellow mystics the paradox of difference as the ground of both distinction of the self from other and the relation of the self to other: "Thou dost teach me, Lord, how otherness, which is not in Thee, is not even in itself, nor can it be. Nor does otherness, being not in Thee, make one creature to be different from another, albeit one be not another" (66). Nicholas describes otherness as a non-principle and as non-existent, thereby invoking - true to his Dionysian origins - the apophatic concept of non-being. Alterity, because it is negative, is not the principle of being but is constituted by the inherent limitations of every being that anchors that being in finite dimensions. Why the sky is not the earth and vice versa, explains Nicholas, is because neither is "infinity itself." Thus for Nicholas of Cusa, it would seem, the individuality of the subject arises from what might be called the "what- they-are-not" of beings. In a style more evocative of the scholastics than the mystics, he uses the example of Socrates to explain: The being of Socrates emcompasseth all Socratic being, and in Socratic being pure and simple there is no otherness nor diversity. The being of Socrates is the individual unity of all those things that are in Socrates, in such a way that in that one being is enfolded the being of all those things which are in Socrates, to wit, in that individual simplicity wherein nought is found other or diverse.... Howbeit, in this onefold being, when all is said, the eye is not the ear and the head is not the heart, and sight is not hearing, and sense is not reason. (67-68) This analogy tries to suggest the way in which the non-existent principle of alterity can, in a way, subsist in the unity of being. But in being an analogy of the relation of parts to the whole it is less transportable to the question of how individual souls, glorified by being in the presence of God,</page><page sequence="8">1 24 Religion &amp; Literature retain their subjective specificity and resist merging one into the other to form parts of the great whole of Being. While de-emphasizing self-abnegation as the earthly preparation for the next world, Nicholas devotes most of his work to describing the self's experience of God's presence. Saint Teresa in the sixteenth century re- verses the emphasis. She imagines the nunnery itself as a microcosm of heaven: "This house is another Heaven, if it be possible to have Heaven on earth. Anyone whose sole pleasure lies in pleasing God and who cares nothing for her own pleasure will find our life a very good one" {Way 107). Consequently, the residents practice two forms of mortification, spiritual and physical. The reader of the Way of Perfection deduces from the descrip- tion of life in the paradigmatic convent that heavenly bliss is a state of disembodied rapture. The body for Saint Teresa is the first obstacle to human perfection. She calls it an "enemy" and writes out a plan of war against it in which the most effective weapon is death itself: "What does it matter if we die? How many times have our bodies not mocked us? Should we not occasionally mock them in turn?" {Way 96). Teresa recognizes the rigorousness of her "Way" and admits that not all women are capable of the radical self-denial that she requires. The "com- plete detachment" that she describes and insists on is double - the first, a renunciation of the people and things for which we have affection (the "externals", as she calls them); the second, the cessation of preoccupation with the self, its needs and desires ("interior matters"). Like all her mystical predecessors, Teresa uses paradoxical figures to describe the soul's union with God, and in the Interior Castle, for instance, employs the image of the silkworm which must die to attain its destined life, to which she adds, "for death comes more easily when one can see oneself living a new life." {Interior Castle, "Mansions" V, iii, 260). Without exception, but to different degrees, mediaeval mystics anchor spiritual growth in the progressive desiccation of the corporeal, the evapo- ration of the individual psyche, and the transcendence of language into mindless silence. The resultant state of disembodied rapture produced through contemplation in the here and now is taken as a foretaste of the happiness to be experienced in the next world. Nevertheless, in the mysti- cal euphoria of Saint Teresa, in the docta ignorantia of Cusanus and the Cloud, it is an embodied self acting as agent of its own transcendence who enters into and returns from these states of contemplation. In this way mediaeval mystical discourse regularly equates the self with language - both of which simultaneously enable and prevent the attainment of their goals. Language is the principle means by which the human spirit comes to know, in varying degrees, objective reality and the self, as well. In the</page><page sequence="9">DAVID WILLIAMS 125 theological language of Christianity God is described as Word, both as Creator (John 1.1-3) and as Verbum Dei and Redeemer (John 1.14). But human language, like its users, labors under the burden of original sin; it works within the restrictions of time distending knowledge into discursivity, requiring noun, verb, subject, object - strung out in discrete spaces separated from one another, ultimately standing between knower and known, speaker and word, and preventing their true union. In addition to the intimacy between self and language, Christianity also identified language and its knowledge more specifically with the body, the one paradigmatic of the other. When Adam and Eve chose "to know" both good and evil, what they came to know was difference and non-being. The very first reality that is revealed in this new, privative light is the body - one's own body experienced now as not-the-other's: And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked (Genesis 3.7). As language perpetually divides knower from known, speaker from listener, through the very existence of words, so we come to know the self first as the body which is not another's, that is, as a dissimilitude, a negative. Simultaneously the other is defined as that body which is not mine. It is in this sense that alienation is never only from the other, but first of all from the self, through taking as the nature of being that which Cusa called the inherent limitations of being. With the limiting self-assertion of Babel (let us make us a name, Genesis 11.14) the divine sentence placed upon human language was the imposition upon it of grammatike (yp(X|LlJl(XTlicr|) and language's resultant temporality and dependence on negation. The contradictory natures of corporeality and of language in which both carry simultaneously negative and positive values give rise to the mediaeval discourse of transcendence. Images of silence and ephemerality are found together in descriptions of the desire to go beyond the flesh. At the end of his Tractatus Logicus Wittgenstein assures us of a truth about words that every mediaeval mystic held: "He who understands me finally recognizes them ['my words' {meinesdtz}] as senseless, when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them. (He must so to speak throw away the ladder, after he has climbed up on it)" (6.54, 189). Like language which can be left behind when one has truly understood, when one has become one with the object of cognition, the body in mystical discourse can be abandoned, kicked away from the threshold of the next world as one enters into union with God. But just as there is a redeemed language of praise in eternity, a paean uttered by all the heavenly citizens, there is also a redeemed body to articulate it. The mediaeval mystical ratio never allows the slippage of paradox into reductive logic to explain away contrariety. The mystic attempts to enter</page><page sequence="10">1 26 Religion &amp; Literature into the aporia in order to "live" it rather than "know" it. Just as, according to Nicholas of Cusa, God is the coincidentia oppositorum, so too, the mystic becomes the paradox so that it is ontologized rather than verbalized. Thus language is transcended into silence, but that silence is itself a deafening exclamation of eternal doxologos (80^0X0700); the body, which Plato con- sidered a prison, falls away and releases the soul to its eternal life, but without the body the soul is in danger of an amorphous, conglomerate existence in which the uniqueness and individual agency of the subject are unimaginable. The solution to the problem of the nature of the existence of the subject in the next world is found, in fact, in the mediaeval meditations on the relationship of body and soul, both in the metaphorical discourse of mysticism and the dialectical analysis of scholasticism. Convinced of the intimate relation of body and soul, Saint Thomas Aquinas argues that the soul is the body's "form"; he locates body and soul within the single being and points out that one does not exist without the other. Such a principle of unity provides an implicit definition of the human being as an embodied subject. Authorizing his views through citation of Pseudo-Dionysius, Tho- mas argues that the reality of being human is to be a materially embedded spirit: "And yet since the human soul's act of intelligence needs powers, namely imagination and sense which operate through corporeal organs, this by itself shows that the soul is naturally united to the body in order to complete the human species" {Contra Gentiles II, lxviii, vol. 2, 1 74). While soul, as form, is "nobler" than the material body, the relation of the two is best understood through the analogy of the relation of act to potency. Indeed, it is the body that distinguishes the soul of one individual from that of another, giving it its uniqueness and identity. Arguing against the pantheist-materialist views of Averroes, Aquinas demonstrates the impossibility of there being a common intellect, or world soul, shared by all human beings by emphasizing the fact of the soul's embodiment: "For it has been proved that the substance of the intellect has been united to the human body as its form. Now one form cannot possibly be in more than one matter, because the proper act is produced in its proper potentiality, since they are mutually proportionate" (II, lxxiii, vol. 2, 182). Saint Thomas' emphasis on the union of body and soul leaves us, however, with the problem of the inevitable separation of the two at death when the soul leaves the body and enters into the next world. Because the body is generated in time and made of matter, it is corruptible and must decay. Having previously demonstrated that, being purely spiritual in nature, the soul is not corrupted when the body perishes (II, lxxix-lxxxi), Aquinas goes on to describes a dynamic of separation and reunion in</page><page sequence="11">DAVID WILLIAMS 127 which both the soul and the body are purified and perfected. As the body's nature is material, its perfection is physical; as the soul's nature is funda- mentally intellectual, its perfection is one of understanding, and it is death that makes it possible: It must be observed, however, that the soul understands in a different way when separated from the body and when united to it, even as it has a different mode of existence because a thing acts according as it is.... Hence, as long as the soul is in the body, it cannot understand without a phantasm; neither can it remember without the powers of cognition and memory, by which the phantasms are pre- pared. (II, lxxx, vol. 2, 230) Once released from the instrumentality of the body, the soul is freed from mediation, a state which, as we have seen, the mystic attempts to anticipate through mortification of the body and the negation of language. The phantasms that Thomas mentions stand for language generally: images, words, and ideas of human devising. As such they represent the intelligible to the soul but simultaneously distort it. Freed of the mediation of these corporeally generated tools, the soul in its perfection knows things as they truly are. The famous words of Saint Paul express more poetically what Thomas states analytically: For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as I am known (I Corinthians 13.12). The soul does not despise the body in life nor does it reject it when separated from it for, as Aquinas tells us, the soul's identity is intenselv involved with the body it has left behind: Accordingly multitude of souls separated from their bodies results from the sub- stantial distinction of forms, since one soul is substantially different from another; yet this distinction does not result from a distinction in the essential principles of the soul, nor from a different kind of soul, but from the different co-aptations of souls to bodies, because the soul is adapted to this and not to that body, and that soul to another bodv, and so on. (II, lxxx, vol.2, 228) The Angelic Doctor's concept of the "adaptation" of the soul to the body and body to soul is the key to the Christian understanding of personal survival of the individual agent after death both in the dialectical and the mystical traditions. From the Latin adaptare (to fit) and aptus (fitted to, depending on), the word adaptation here carries both the sense of natural suitability and union; body and soul "fit" each other in such a way as to make their accommodation specific to each other, and thus to make it impossible for a particular soul to join any other body. The extended sense of aptus which connotes dependency is also inherent in Thomas' view of the relation of body and soul, for the body depends on the soul for the enactment of its potential, while the soul depends on the body for its</page><page sequence="12">1 28 Religion &amp; Literature instrumentality and specificity. The problem of the distinction of body and soul as a hierarchical one involving the superiority of spirit over matter, Thomas explains within the context of original sin and redemption: the prelapserian body was "proportionate" to its form, the soul, and thus incorruptible; with the coming of sin, death was introduced, but as "acci- dent." In fashioning human nature, God bestowed on the human body something in addition to that which was due to it by virtue of its natural principles. This was a kind of incorruptibility, the result of the body being so proportioned to its form, that as the souPs life is everlasting, so was it possible for the body through the soul, to live forever. (IV, lxxxi, vol. 5, 274) Just as Jesus removed the "accident" of everlasting death and corruption for mankind through his self-sacrifice, so too, his resurrection and ascen- sion provide the paradigm for the understanding of the mystery of eternal life: as Jesus rose to heaven body and soul, so the human self will exist as an embodied agent whose corporeal dimension, like its spiritual, will be fulfilled and perfected to the limits of its potential: "Nor should we deny that all will rise again, although all men do not believe in Christ, nor are partakers in His mysteries. The Son of God took human nature that He might restore it. Accordingly, the natural defect that is shared by all will be repaired, and the dead will rise again" (IV, lxxxi, vol. 5, 279). Saint Thomas also tackles the question of identity and change: "Now, while a man lives, the parts of his body do not always remain the same as to matter, but only as to species: in fact, as regards matter, the parts come and go. Yet this does not prevent a man from retaining his identity from the beginning of his life to the end" (IV, lxxxi, vol. 5, 278). Although it is obvious that the subject retains its existential identity despite development and change, it is equally evident that the body is not the same as it passes from birth to death. How, then, shall we appear after the resurrection of the dead? Will those who died at a young age be raised as children? Will the maimed retain their infirmities? If there be anything lacking to a man's proper quantity, whether because he died before reaching maturity, or because he has lost a limb, the divine power will supply the deficiency. Nor will this prevent the identity of the rising body; seeing that nature, too, makes additions to a child's body from extraneous sources, so that the body attains to maturity; and such an addition does not change its identity: since the child and the adult are the same man (IV, lxxxi, vol. 5, 278). Resurrection, argues Saint Thomas, is specific to the body since its purpose is the perpetuation, not of mankind, but of the individual, and not of the soul only, for the soul has eternal life without the Resurrection:</page><page sequence="13">DAVID WILLIAMS 129 "Therefore it is directed to the perpetuation of the individual... and consequently man will live forever after the resurrection" (IV, lxxxii, vol. 5, 281). Aquinas also provides details of life in the next world and thereby reveals the existential nature of the resurrected self: for instance, we will need no food since growth and decay will have ceased along with all things that minister to growth and decay. Sex, too, will for the same reason have become irrelevant, specifically because the principle end of "the alliance of male and female" is reproduction, the purpose of which is, in turn, the continuation of the species. Since the human species will now be everlast- ing, reproduction will be unnecessary (IV, lxxxiii, vol. 5, 283). The last chapters of the Summa Contra Gentiles are devoted to descriptions of the body and the soul in the next world after the resurrection of the dead. Although the self has no need of food and sex in paradise, this does not mean that it will lack the bodily organs for such activities. This heretical notion Aquinas dismisses with the words from Job, And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh I shall see God: Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me (Job 19.26-27). Nor will the heavenly denizen be in a static state of ecstasy, as if stupefied, for "the bodies of the blessed, after the resurrection, will be agile," acting, moving, and as Scripture describes them, running to and fro like sparks among the stubble (Wisdom 3.7, cited in IV, lxxxvi, vol. 5, 297-8). Thomas rejects as error the deduction that, since reproduction will no longer be necessary and given that the resurrected body will be perfected, all bodies will rise as males: "Just as other members of the body belong to the integrity of the human body, so do those that serve the purpose of generation, both in man and in woman. Therefore, bodies will rise again with these members" (IV lxxxvi, vol. 5, 300). Nevertheless, a certain commonality among the blessed will prevail apparently since we will all be thirty-three years old: "All will rise again at the age of Christ, which is the age of youth, because it is only at that age that nature is perfect" (IV, lxxxviii, vol. 5, 301). The scholastic solution to the paradox of the transcended self's survival in eternity is found, therefore, in the concept of the embodied agent made possible by the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead. A similar concept is found in the poetics of mysticism wherein the paradox of the existence and non-existence of self is understood through the idea of the soul's ultimate incarnation. In the idea of the resurrection of the body is found the resolution of the mystics' negation of self and their disdain of the corporeal. It is the body's post-lapsarian imperfections that must be ex-</page><page sequence="14">1 30 Religion &amp; Literature cised, and it is all the dross - physical and psychological - that the self must shake off in order that the true self, incarnated in the true body raised up at the resurrection, may be realized. Nicholas of Cusa's paradigm for the embodiment of the spirit is the death and resurrection of Jesus. Alluding, perhaps, to one of the current Christological heresies that separated the divine and human natures of Christ, Nicholas declares that both natures were always united in the individual self of Jesus, both in life and in death: "Tis thus, Jesu most merciful, that I look upon the absolute life, which is God, inseparably united unto Thy human intellect and thereby unto Thy body. For that union is such that none can be closer" (1 16). For Nicholas, the separation of body and soul at death is not definitive; the body is not left behind "purely and simply", as he puts it. Like Aquinas, Cusa imagines the soul in heaven in a state of anticipation, yearning for reunion with its body. He employs the analogy between Christ's union of divine and human natures in one self and the relation of body and soul in man: "Wherefore it never was true nor can it ever be that Thy divine nature was separated from Thy human nature, nor yet from Thy mind nor Thy body, the parts without which human nature cannot exist" (116). Perhaps his most impressive insight into the nature of selfhood is Cusa's apophatic rendering of the union of self and other: the self we experience in the world is not the true self, or, at least, it is not the pure self, for it is commingled and confused with images of its own imaginings, base desires, and alienating self consciousness. It is this facet of self with its dimensions extraneous to being that is distilled away in the mystics' self denial as preparation for the complete possession of the true self in the after life. Unlike the view ascribed to Plato of the body as the soul's contamination, the Christian mystic's view is of the body as the soul's instrument and locus of purification. Nicholas is clear in his opinion that there is no union of creature and Creator without that creature being capable of agency: O Lord, Thou Sweetness most delectable, Thou hast left me free to be mine own self, if I desire. Hence, if I be not mine own self, Thou art not mine, for Thou dost make freewill needful, since Thou canst not be mine if I be not mine own (32). The Cfowrf-author is even more theologically specific about the survival of the self after death. In a passage expressing sudden realization that his reader may have misinterpreted the privilege he has accorded to spirit, apathy, and silence, he protests his orthodoxy. The author's equation of language with body and body with language is shown by the fact that what he here retracts is his earlier condemnation of the use of words in prayer.1</page><page sequence="15">DAVID WILLIAMS 131 I am not saying this because I want you to stop praying vocally whenever you are so moved, or to prevent you breaking out, in your overflowing devotion of soul, in normal speech to God with some appropriate word.... No, God forbid that you understand me to mean this! Really, I do not mean this. God forbid that I should part what he has joined, the body and spirit. For God wants to be served with body and soul, both together, as is right, and to give man his heavenly reward in body as well as in soul. (chap. 48, 117) Master Eckhart, too, sees the body as instrumental in that it is the means by which the soul is purified. His pantheism leads him, however, to emphasize union and identification with the One to such an extent that the embodied condition of the soul is somewhat obscured in his thought. Nevertheless, Eckhart's enthusiasm for the concept of unity also informs his understanding of the relation of body to soul, an understanding nour- ished by Aquinas, the "authority" alluded to: One authority says that the soul is put in the body to be purified. If it is separated from the body, it has neither intelligence nor will. It is then One and cannot send forth agents by which it might turn to God. Nevertheless, these aspects are present [in germ] in the soul's core, which is to say, in its roots rather than its activities. The soul is purified in the body through its function in gathering together [all the body's] disparate elements. When [the forces] expressed through the five senses are gathered again into the soul, then the soul is one agent by means of which everything is unified. (Sermon 16, "Being is more than life," 173) The "gathering again" of the sentient forces referred to occurs at the resurrection of the dead when body rejoins soul. In the meantime, as Saint Thomas shows, the soul awaits its companion in heaven: It is unnatural for the soul to be without the body. Now nothing unnatural can last forever.. . . Now the soul when separated from the body is, in a way, imperfect: even as any part is when severed from its whole.... Therefore we must postulate a reunion of body and soul, in order that both in the soul and the body man may be rewarded or punished. (IV, lxxx, vol. IV, p. 270-71) In his analysis of the Survival Hypothesis, H. H. Price uses the para- digm of dream in order to imagine the next world. Presuming that exist- ence after death is disembodied, Price compares the experience of the discarnate mind to our state when we dream. In this "out of body" experience we are "provided with a multitude of objects of awareness about which we employ thoughts and toward which we have desires and emotions" (178). In the Middle Ages poets, notably Dante, frequently employed dream to explore the nature of transcendent reality and as a device to effect suspension of disbelief so as to describe the otherworld. They had inherited a universal cultural conviction that the disembodied</page><page sequence="16">1 32 Religion &amp; Literature state of the dreamer allowed the laws of nature to be suspended and facilitated the communication of heavenly denizens with earthlings. For the Middle Ages, some dreams at least are not primarily psychological events but metaphysical ones which often contain previews of life in the next world. The most beautiful English dream vision is a dramatized encounter between a bereaved father and his deceased daughter glorified in heaven. Exhausted from grief, the father has fallen asleep on his daughter's grave, and - it is specified - leaving his body behind, his "soul forsook that spot in space" (Aon? II, 1,1). The poem addresses the paradoxes familiar to both mediaeval scholasticism and mysticism through the transported father's struggle to understand self transcendence, agency, and contrariety, and in the process reveals an elegiac vision of the nature of life after death. The poetic rendering presents the father as disembodied, not the daughter whom he hesitantly recognizes as someone he has known well, but who is transformed physically. As he approaches his child, her fair face, her fine figure, her ivory brow make her more and more recognizable to the father, but he is not sure: O Pearl, said I, in pearls of price, Are you my pearl come back again? (V, 1,1) It is Pearl herself who raises the question of the embodied condition of the soul both before and after death when she reminds the dreamer of Christ's promise that mankind will rise in the flesh to be reunited with the soul in heaven or in hell (VI, 1, 1-6). But before entering Paradise, she explains, every human being must undergo the separation of body and soul that is death: Your body fair, with senses five, Must first sink down in mire and mold, For in Eden garden, in days of old, Our father's father his life misspent; Each man must suffer a death foretold Ere God to this crossing give consent. (VI, 2, 7-12) Reminiscent of the mystics' meditation on self-abnegation, the father begins to question basic binarisms. The dualities of loss and gain, body and soul, life and death are richly developed by the poet as he traces the father's growth of understanding and gradual acceptance of paradox. His recovery of the lost Pearl has been made possible by somatic loss; must he now, he asks, regain his body and lose his Pearl, only later to surrender the same body to death and rediscover his Pearl where he had left her?</page><page sequence="17">DAVID WILLIAMS 133 That which I lost I found but late - And must I now forego it again? Why must I meet it and miss it straight? (VI, 3, 3-5) The aporetic understanding that loss is gain, and gain is loss is anchored in the mystery of the body that must go through destruction to be perfected, like Saint Teresa's silkworm. Pearl's heavenly body is a cause of much confusion to her rather pragmatic father; how is it, he asks, that though she dies a very young child, she is now a mature young woman and is called "bride" and "queen." Pearl poetically reproduces the doctrine of the resurrection of the body developed in the theology of Thomas Aquinas and other orthodox thinkers: the resurrected body, although the same as the one left behind at death, is, like the soul, fulfilled according to its natural potential. Since the natural destiny of a two year old child is to grow into maturity, so Pearl describes herself: You know that when Pearl first slipped away I was tender of age, by time untried. But my Lord the Lamb whom all obey, He took me to Him to be his bride, Crowned me queen in bliss to stay, Forever and ever glorified. (VII, 5, 3-9) Pearl also invokes the Pauline concept of the mystical body side by side with the idea that each of the blessed is uniquely fulfilled according to his or her individual nature (VIII, Iff). Thus while each heavenly citizen is a distinct "whole", each is also a part - simultaneously both an autono- mous, embodied agent and a limb-like member of the body of Christ. A further paradox is engaged through what might be called Pearl's self- consciousness. Since the re-embodiment of the soul must await the resur- rection of the dead at the end of the world, is Pearl's appearance in the flesh an oneiric illusion produced as a concession to the material under- standing of the dreamer? Pearl reveals her awareness of her own separa- tion from her body : "Our bodies lie on earthen bier / And you go grieving sore distressed". Pearl, however, possesses the understanding of the resur- rection: "But we, with knowledge full and clear / See in one death all wrong redressed" (XV, 2, 5-8). But how is it conceivable that the soul, existing in eternity in a state of its own perfection in the ecstasy of the Beatific Vision, also be in a state of anticipation? One can only wait in time from a position in the present tending toward the future. Can the soul truly be perfect if it is missing something essential to it? Saint Thomas tells us that until body and soul are rejoined, the soul is, in a way, not fully</page><page sequence="18">1 34 Religion &amp; Literature perfected, but subsists in a condition of yearning: "Now the soul when separated from the body is, in a way, imperfect: even as any part is when separated from its whole: and the soul is naturally part of human nature. Therefore man cannot obtain ultimate happiness unless the soul be re- united to his body" (IV, lxxx, vol 5, 271). The implied deferment of this union, while the body remains on earth and the soul in heaven, can only have meaning in human discourse and can only apply to temporal reality. In an existence without past or future, everything already is, and blessed souls are always already joined to the bodies that await them in an earthly future. Thus Pearl can speak of the body which already contains her as still on "earthen bier." Her father, in what suggests itself as an inverted mirror reflection of the process of resurrection, rejoins his body which also lies on "earthen bier" as his dream state is suspended and he awakes. The Pearl-poet's creation of a dialog between a mourning father and his glorified child brings together two distinct mediaeval discourses on the nature of the self. The mystical emphasis on mortification of the body, transcendence of language, and denial of self as preparatory to life in the next world, poses problems of self as subject. Saint Thomas' scholastic use of logical analysis and dialectical reasoning attempts to solve the problem through the concept of the embodied agent. The poetic text, Pearl, is the site of the intersection of these distinct yet complimentary approaches, dramatized through the dialog between daughter and father. Pearl, herself, adopts both perspectives: she reminds her father of his need for mortifica- tion while he still lives at the same time articulating her personal relation to her own body left on earth. Similarly the father combines perspectives: he protests that one as young as his daughter could not have practiced sufficient self-denial to merit the great reward that she has gained, yet also recognizes the embodied Pearl as the same individual that he loves. Saint Thomas seems to speak for both father and daughter and for all Christians when he insists on the essential embodiment of the self, not only in this world, but in the next, as well: "Although the soul is part of man along with the body, it is not itself the whole man, and I am not my soul" (In epistolam xv, lectio ii, vol. 1 3, 281).
