Baudrillard reminds us that the bygone object has a derived value in which the " stigmata of industrial production and primary function are eliminated."4 The frozen moment eliminates both drudgery and creativity. In addition the taste for the bygone which the frozen moment entails is characterised "by the desire to transcend the dimension of economic success, to consecrate a social success or a privileged position in a redundant, culturalised, symbolic sign."5 Behind Mason's remarks and assumptions was the defeat of Native American culture at the very moment when American ethnic linguistics was mounting its challenge to European Indo-European "centrism" in the discipline. Moreover, at both the academic and political levels American linguistics of this period, with its familiar ideology of pluralistic, non-hierarchical representations of human universals gaining ground over monolithic European race theories, historical lineages, and privileging Indo-European linguistic paradigms, is not the uniform ameliorative progress which at first it appears to be. The military and political defeat of Native Americans in the 1880s was absolute and cruel. Colonel Richard Irving Dodge, veteran of thirty-three years' military service in the old West said, " It is difficult to approach the subject dispassionately, for next to the crime of slavery the foulest blot on the escutcheon of the Government of the United States is its treatment of the so-called 'Wards of the Nation.'"6 Dodge advocated the abolition of the Indian Bureau and asked that the defeated nations be placed under military supervision for defence was urgent against predatory scavengers in the wake of military defeat, and further, basics such as food, clothing and shelter needed to be secured. Throughout the period of the rise of American linguistic studies - much of it devoted to the study of indigenous languages ? the condition of Native Americans steadily deteriorated. Edward S. Curtis, reflecting on the United States Govern ment's treatment of the Native Americans of California in 1924, said: "The conditions are still so acute that, after spending many months among these scattered groups of Indians, the author finds it difficult even to mention the subject with calmness."7 The close connections between linguistics, 4 Jean Baudrillard, For a Critique of the Political Economy of the Sign, introd. and trans.

The question of responsibility needs careful framing. While the new school of political anthropology in the United States relevantly reminds us that anthropology is "the child of Western Imperialism,"8 bitterness can also distort. For example, in the excitement of the occupation of Wounded Knee in 1973,9 Franz Boas's "particularism" as a collusive and ahistorical specialisation was condemned as having laid the basis for an imperialist anthropology. The picture is, however, much more complicated. Even a cursory look at Boas's career shows that he fought racist authorities seeking scientific alibis many times; that he protested vigorously the imperialist mood in America after 1898 ; that he inveighed against the use of anthropologists as spies in Mexico ; that Du Bois trusted him enough to invite him to speak to an albeit middle-class audience of Black professionals at the Eleventh Atlanta University Conference; that he publicly announced his intention to vote for the socialist party in 1918, and, in a celebrated moment, defended the North West "potlatch" ceremony from government ban.10 Boas wrote, "The background of my early thinking was a German home in which the ideas of the revolution of 1848 were a living force."11 Boas's particularism had a certain historical merit also. It was both an honest response to the urgent first task of information gathering, and a stance taken at a moment when uncertainty about paradigms was characteristic of many branches of knowledge. One dimension of "particularism," nonetheless, is its view of society as static. The Ethical Code of the American Society of Applied Anthro pology stated that anthropologists should not participate in the "change processes of the groups they study."12 Lame Deer, watching his Grandmother prepare his initiation ceremony, noted: "It would have made those anthropologists mad. Imagine performing such an ancient ceremony with a razor blade instead of a flint knife ! "13 It would not have 8 Gerritt Huizer and Bruce Mannheim, eds.

To a student of the language-and-culture debates of American linguists from the 1870s to the 1930s the more contemporary issues and questions are oddly familiar. I shall (1) explore the language and culture debates of this period in their own terms, while offering some contemporary re readings, and then (2) exemplify some of the questions in the writings of four of the more distinguished linguists : Whitney, Boas, Bloomfield and Sapir. II The field of linguistics as conceived by the linguists themselves was necessarily inter-disciplinary. The relevant disciplines included ethnology, pure science, history, geology and psychology.15 There are recognisable groupings of problems which range from characterisations of process and method to working assumptions. Characterisations of "process" which any combination of disciplines might share in any combination of ways include theses of evolutionism, historicism, uniformitarianism, instru mentalism, psychologism, diffusionism and geneticism. These various "isms" exchanged as well as differentiated their methods and procedures. It is possible, though more difficult than often assumed, to describe a general shift of focus. Thus one could say there was a gradual change of interest in the earlier part of the period under discussion from a concern with language and myth conceived "historically" in which some sort of 14 Quoted from C.

F. K. Koerner, "Towards a Historiography of Linguistics," in Herman Parret, ed., History of Linguistic and Contemporary Linguistic (Berlin, New York: Walter de Gruyter, 1976), 684?718. Koerner's irascible strictures on the state of the art in the history of linguistics and his attacks on Aarslef and Robbins seems to depend on the requirement of "total knowledge" before offering any statement. He himself, however, whenever he attempts to broaden his own perspective tends to fall back on "climate of opinion" arguments.</page><page sequence="5">Linguists from Whitney to S apir 189 distinction was preserved between the civilised and the primitive, to one where language became interested only in itself, myth was degraded, behaviour substituted for history, and the gap between the primitive and the civilised in terms of complexity was erased. Dell Hymes characterises a shift of focus from nineteenth-century "philological ethnology" to "linguistic anthropology," which further developed in the twentieth century into ethno-linguistics, psycho-linguistics, and socio-linguistics.16 The relation between language and culture is beset by hyphens. Yet in the twentieth as in the nineteenth century these hyphens are not only signs of tactical optimism and of professionalising academic empires craving funding, but also point to a not-always-acknowledged set of common aims driving disciplines together. In Hymes's words " the linguistic and cultural theories are of a piece historically and in practice in American anthropology."17 Statements about language and culture draw on a variety of strategies. The present paper is designed to undermine confidence in simple progressions and classification. As early as the 1800s for example, Rask was faced with Cr?ole?Dutch without inflection spoken by Blacks of the Danish West Indies which, while exhibiting the required progressive development of an Indo-European language, nonetheless also had "characteristics generally attributed to the most primitive stage of human language."18 The chief progressivist paradigm in the later nineteenth century was Darwinian natural selection. In Darwin's own works on behavioural psychology it was used to argue for a physiological basis for the emotions.19 William James, on the other hand, used it to develop a model of psychology.20 The Darwinian model of development could be used for many purposes. It could be used to further statistical studies of help to diffusionists. It could be employed on either side of the "psychological"/ "historical" divide. It could both emphasise and deny the importance of origins. It could be applied in hypothesis-building, and, turned into a 16 Dell H.

Natural selection could underwrite both synchronie and diachronic models of change. Its uses also varied in any special instance. Boas, for example, would reject its potentially racist implications in the hands of certain German theorists, while accepting developmental and "primitive civilised" assumptions which were also an integral part of the same theory. The theory might also be arrived at by strange routes. Hymes reminds us, for example, that "Tylor, like Morgan, started on the path that led to evolutionary theory from an interest in the Asiatic connections of American Indians, " and he adds that for most of the Europeans it was simply an assumption that underlay their empirical ethnology.21 Similarly the notion that language was somehow guaranteed by psychology could mean many different things. Discourses bearing traces of both enlightenment and romantic theories complicate the definition of psychology. Only toward the end of the nineteenth century did the assumption of a universal "mind of man" supported by a romantic myth of common origins begin to show signs of breaking down. Hopkins attacked Max M?ller's "etymological mythology" as late as 1900,22 yet word-collecting was still the only thing at that date that most American linguists could do and they did not shrink from the large inferences. Psychology was closely bound up with theories of race and origin, and language was the prime source of evidence. In 1892 Horatio Hale affirmed a proposition at least a century old: "Solely by their languages can the tribes of man be scientifically classified, their affiliations discovered, and their mental qualities discerned."23 Nonetheless suspicion as to what those mental qualities were was growing. James's Psychology (published in 1891), which had started out in a boldly mechanistic spirit and had ended with a meditation on the Fourth Book of Locke's Human Understanding took this very problem for its closing words : " And the more sincerely one seeks to trace the actual source of psycho-genesis, the steps which as a race we may have come by the peculiar mental attributes which we possess, the more 21 See Hymes, Essays, 97.

John Wesley Powell in his famous Introduction to the Study of Indian Languages saw the link of kinship - as did L?vi-Strauss after him - as mediator between language and society. Powell is himself a useful link between Morgan's ethnology and Lester Ward's sociology.25 There were hopes that sociology would fill the gaps between ethnology and psychology. The links between all three are demonstrable in this from Powell: Indian society is based on kinship. For this reason the terms used to designate kinship are of much greater importance in tribal society than in national society. The groups of words used to designate persons by their degrees of relationship will constitute a valuable contribution to linguistic science and at the same time will be of great interest to the student of Indian society.26 Kinship emphasis promoted a language emphasis and a distinction between state and society. Where Henry Adams saw royal families in the South Seas as primus inter pares?1 the linguist ethnologists used kinship ? perhaps unconsciously - to reinforce the defeat of Indian Nations by calling them societies. To be interested in the other socially was a way of bypassing questions of power and sovereignty. In the emphasis on descent, origin, social institution and slow change, the evasion of questions of sovereignty was assisted. Kinship was amenable to statistical treatment which brought it into line with the increasingly prevailing emphasis in sociology itself. Morgan, like many ethnologists, came from a legal background, and his views on society employ legal and universalist?Utopian discourses to bypass the political. Resek's book tells us that Morgan's most successful public lecture was called "Diffusion against Centralisation," and he adds : Its theme, in part derived from his image of the Iroquois and in part from the rejection of the doctrines of original sin and predestination, was that inequality 24 William James, The Principles of Psychology (New York: Henry Holt Co., 1890), 11, 68. 25 Lester Ward dedicated his Dynamic Sociology (1883) to Powell as Powell dedicated his Truth and Error (1898) to Lester Ward.

He pictured the ideal society as homogenous and free of all permanent divisions according to religion, education, ownership of property, or advantages in commercial enterprise.28 " Diffusion," Resek explains, in liberal practice meant least government, and laissez-faire was initially a middle-class hope against the centralism of aristocracy. Brooks Adams brought the concept of " centralisation " back into play in 1899 ln nls The Law of Civilisation and Decay as he surveyed the growth of international corporations which threatened the sources of sovereignty in white American as well. But diffusion was also a way of characterising process in biological, geographic, and linguistic terms. Kinship studies offered a new structural, quasi-sociological approach to Native American culture. Powell acknowledged Morgan's "great work on Consanguinity and Affinity," published by the Smithsonian Institution in his Introduction to the Study of Indian Languages.2* Consanguinity offered a transmutation of "historical" to "diachronic," and "affinity" offered the spatialising connections characteristic of synchrony. Or to put it more crudely, blood and Goethean chemical forces underlay social process. Kinship connections presented an arbitrary show of representations where unconscious totality reigned supreme and which paved the way to structurally-oriented sociology and linguistics from Durkheim to Levi Strauss. "In many ways," Powell affirmed, "the author is indebted to Mr. Morgan as the pioneer into the sociology of the North American Indian."30 Powell, however, who in other respects was an admirable figure with an ideal of public service and a passion for conservation quixotic in the 18 80s, was only one of many voices offering analogies between language and culture. The chief figure before Boas was Daniel G. Brinton whose speculative turn of mind offered a rich profusion, or perhaps confusion, of theoretical possibilities which were to drive Boas into the refuge of practical empirical procedure. Brinton's always lively observations drew on an eclectic range of pre-suppositions from romantic theory to the latest biology and sociology. Contradictory and multiple though these observations were, they are characterisable. A fascination with the unconscious runs through Brinton's many pronouncements on language and culture. While denying the "children of nature" (no less than their 28 Carl Resek, Lewis Henry Morgan, American Scholar (Chicago : The University of Chicago Press, i960), 52. 29 Powell, Introduction, vi?vii. 30 Ibid., vii.

Since it was generally held that words were consciously used and syntax unconsciously used, Brinton, like William James who saw the sentence as a mode of mental operation,32 "ranked the grammatical structure of a sentence superior to its lexical elements. "33 Paradoxically and in practice all the earlier American linguists in the Native American field could do was to collect words from bi-lingual speakers. The lexical?syntactical division, which broke down when the languages became better known, reinforced a kind of epistemological superiority. I know the structure you depend on; you merely offer me the evidence. I play detective to your witness-like unreliability in relation to facts. Ethnic witnesses, then as now, were naturally "unreliable." Brinton went on to develop a theory of "ethnic psyche" - a kind of collective mind analogous to Saussure's langue in that it stressed virtual immortality, was possessed of non-creative and conservative qualities, and bound individuals with the "iron bands of social order."34 For Brinton language was " the most perfect example of ethnic psychical action. It is the product of the group, to which each individual of the group contributes his share..."35 What is fascinating is Brinton's ultimate recourse to psycho-pathology. The agents of Brinton's social morphology are physical and mental disease. Physical disease affects primitive society ? the linguistic Kantians get it both ways ? and mental disease affects civilised society. Brinton moves from a projection of unconscious reason onto the Other (via ethnic linguistics), to a collective potentiality of decline figured as a hierarchical continuum of physical and mental disease. That continuum of physical to mental characteristics, much beloved by psychologists of the period, ensures a democratic fate. The metaphysic of continuity, in short, asserts that common fate of death often used by the moralising powerful: we get it in the head; you get it in the 31 D. G.

That continuity projected itself endlessly into the future as a memento mori or general threat. Evolutionary theory tended to give this endlessly present nervous possibility a certain legitimacy. In Foucault's words, "from the point of view of evolution, illness has no other status than that of a general potentiality."36 Brinton - relying on Virchow's cellular investigation - observed, "Where is the individual who is not diseased?"37 Boas shared with Brinton a reliance on Bastian's geographical provinces as culture areas in order to undermine racism, Aryanism, and soil-and state arguments. He also shared with Brinton an interest in Virchow.38 Nonetheless he vigorously protested certain aspects of Brinton's psychological fatalism.39 Boas made connections between linguistics and ethnology rather differently. In Hymes's words, "Boas creates a stage in which the unity of linguistics and ethnology is explicit with regard to subject matter, implicit with regard to method."40 Hymes is right to note a paradox of practical separation and theoretical integration of linguistics and ethnology in Boas, though that r?int?gration was a working assumption and a goal rather than anything actually achieved, even as theory. In his Handbook of American Indian Languages (1911) Boas stated: It was originally intended to give a somewhat elaborate introduction, setting forth the essential psychological characteristics of American languages ; but with the development of the plan of work it was found necessary to relegate this discussion to the end of the whole work, because without a somewhat detailed discussion of the various languages the essential points cannot be substantiated by reliable evidence.41 After Boas (to whom I shall return later) linguistics and cultural propositions play musical chairs. Kroeber, for example, played down the more metaphysical assumptions of heredity, evolution and structure, yet he too emphasised the unconscious, and saw language as a model for cultural stability and change.42 There are a few moments in Kroeber 36 Michel Foucault, Mental Illness and Psychology (1954), trans.

My point is that they also had certain things in common. 40 Hymes, Essays, 138. 41 Franz Boas, Handbook of American Indian Languages, Smithsonian Bureau of American Ethnology, Bulletin 40 (Washington: Government Printing Office, 1911), v. 42 A.

A comparison of Kroeber's notion of "society" with that of Peirce's is useful. Peirce had turned the notion of the public into a kind of social langue^ explaining continuity as a principle of logic in which chance was programmed Darwinistically into a network of signs. But Pierce still had enough Transcendentalist individuality to make a distinction generally lost in the 1920s: "Man is a social animal: but to be social is one thing, to be gregarious is another; I decline to serve as a bellwether. "4T For all his pioneering of semiotics, Peirce could also emphasise symbolic morphology and change: "A symbol once in being, spreads among the peoples. In use and in experience, its meaning grows. Such words as force, law, wealth, marriage bear for us very different meanings from those they bore to our barbarous ancestors. "48 Wherever a basically synchronie structure was advocated, some device for measuring temporal change was inevitably engaged. Kroeber, while attacking Spengler's historical cultural patterning, nonetheless felt obliged to advocate what he called the " roster of genius in dated history."49 Saussure's juggling of synchrony and diachrony (terms he popularised in his linguistic writings) is well known, and it is instructive to raise certain aspects of his thoughts on language and culture here to see where they coincide with or differ from his American contemporaries and followers. Saussure attacked the notion that a particular grammar was not metaphysically grounded in the nature of things : " the division of words into substantives, verbs, adjectives, etc. is not an undeniable linguistic reality."50 Investigators into Native American languages were coming to this view at about the same time. Stems and modifying elements had syntactical implications, for example. Saussure asserted that linguistics must be carefully separated from ethnology, prehistory anthropology and 43 Ibid., 87.

He stated flatly, "psychological causes do not necessarily underlie linguistic procedures."51 though what he had in mind here was nationalist psychology. A universalist psychology was implicit in his notion of langue. In praising the American linguist Whitney, Saussure extracted a notion of convention from the American's Lockean theory of language. Nonetheless Saussure shared many presuppositions about process with the ethnological linguists, particularly in relation to the role of the unconscious, the uniformitarian model of change, and a certain hypostasising of the time and space process. This is true even though he always found a place for time in his characterisations of change: "By itself space cannot influence language... Geographical diversity should be called temporal diversity."52 It was an essentially diffusionist model popular with post-Darwin theorists. "With Sapir," says Hymes, "comes the second stage, explicit recognition of a methodological role for linguistics."53 There was much else besides, and Sapir's views were modified somewhat throughout his career. There was an analogical role for linguistics in providing models for culture ? the reverse in some respects of the 19th-century practice of bringing a wide diversity of models in science and history to linguistics. Aberle, whose discussion is partially followed here, also points to Sapir's analogies between culture and personality, arguing that his culture and personality theory "developed in the vacuum created by the rejection of perspectives which saw culture as a system, either synchronically or diachronically."54 I shall argue in a moment that more than a theoretical perspective was involved. Systematising as such was to reach its nadir in the 1950s with Bloomfield, when scientism extended phonemes, mor phemes, tagmemems and sememes into behavioremes and mythemes.55 Whorf 's relation to these problems is instructive : " The investigator of culture should hold up an ideal of linguistics as that of a heuristic approach to the problem of psychology."56 Paradoxically such an approach potentially decentred linguistics as a key to culture. Whorf has been badly misrepresented, so one must follow his words closely. He did not say that language projects a world view but only that "a certain 51 Ibid., 227. 52 Ibid., 198. 53 Hymes, Essays, i?8. 54 David F.

A sense of metaphysics is not necessarily a negative quality. It may inspire the will to examine critically the nature of appearance. The negative view of metaphysics held by science tended to suggest that science itself was free of metaphysics. Ill I will now look at four moments in Whitney, Boas, Bloomfield and Sapir in the spirit of textual analysis.59 Kristeva's distinction between epic monologism and Menippean discourse; the first displaying the transcen dental signified and self-presence highlighted by Derrida, the second the carnivalesque, transgressive and irreverent, will be kept in mind throughout, though as we shall see it has some serious limitations in practice.60 In addition I should like to suggest that within any text, and perhaps especially in some of the linguistic texts of this period both types of discourse may be present and in conflict. Nonetheless Kristeva's point holds, " that linguistics especially, establishing itself as the science of the object, lending itself as a model for semiotics and systematics of exchange, turned naturally to rules of kinship and myth as examples of ' community knowledge.'61 Clark Wissler's The American Indian (1917) is typical evidence for Kristeva's claims about the science of the object : As stated in the original preface, this volume is an outgrowth of museum experience. Since the primary functions of museums are those having to do with the conserving of materials and making them available to persons seriously interested, the point of view assumed in this volume is mainly taxonomic, or classificatory and descriptive. In the pursuit of problems relative to man's body, his economic life, his material culture and his art, we deal with objects; speech is made objective by tests and so subject to taxonomic treatment; beliefs, rituals, 57 Ibid., 55. 58 Ibid., 55. 59 Roland Barthes, Image, Music, Text, ed. and trans.

The most famous American linguist of the nineteenth century, William Dwight Whitney, known in his own time for somewhat scathing critiques of M?ller in England, Schleicher and Steinthal in Germany, has been used for many purposes.64 Was he as Aarslef, quoting Br?al, tentatively asserts, "a positiviste convaincu" and if so how can this be related to his " historicism " and " organicism ? "65 Whitney's account of language picks a sceptical path through the thorny controversies of late nineteenth century linguistics. Beneath the then-current terminology one sometimes glimpses the New England Puritan meditating, like Milton's devils on free will and fate ? though like a good empiricist, not on foreknowledge. Whitney touches on most of the issues raised so far in this paper. For Whitney language was arbitrary in the Saussure sense, and it was also conventional.66 The notion of convention, however, was further linked to a notion of language as an institution which suggests that in practice language might not be absolutely arbitrary. Like many other nineteenth century theorists in all disciplines Whitney believed in the law of "economy," romantically celebrated by Emerson and Thoreau among others. Opposed to it was the force of "analogy" (p. 72) - defined in classic Aristotelian fashion as a " delight in discovery of resemblances " (p. 86). Analogy was used by Whitney in many ways, from both justifying and not justifying methodology to an almost spiritual glimpse of the truth 62 Clark Wissler, The American Indian: An Introduction to the Anthropology of the New World, 3rd. ed.

To justify linguistic process Whitney also drew on Darwinian models of change. For example, changing linguistic form "wipes out part of the intermediates which connect a derived element with its original " (p. 125). Certain parts of the argument seem to parallel William James's emphasis on " Practicalism, " goal-orientedness and instrumentality - all seen here in relation to language itself (p. 145). Unlike James, however, Whitney sees that practicalism as socially-oriented; the "final tribunal" for language is the community. In general Whitney was a pragmatist accepting the importance of Indo-European paradigms for practical rather than ideological reasons. While, for example, he thought that the "instrumental" qualities of language in Chinese were poor, he also thought that language capable of accomplishing "great things" (p. 233). Presumably those great things were not very practical. Whitney stood on the threshold of the intensive study of Native American languages. Powell enlisted his help in drafting his Introduction to the Study of Indian Languages (1877). Like Boas later, Whitney distinguished sharply between race and language: The testimony of language to race is thus not that of a physical characteristic, nor of anything founded on and representing such ; but only that of a transmitted institution, which under sufficient inducement, is capable of being abandoned by its proper inheritors, or assumed by men of strange blood. And the inducement lies in the external circumstances, not in the nature of the language abandoned or assumed. Political control, social superiority of culture ? these are the leading causes which bring about social change of speech (p. 271). We might speculate that to an English sensibility the word "institution" may recall Dickens ; to an American sensibility, especially in the nineteenth century, it may suggest those "free institutions" which were the guarantors of "the American way of life" since 1776. Whitney's first discussion of the individual's relation to the community of language occurs in Language and the Study of Language (1867) an&lt;? at once signals his unease about analogy. He first takes us through the standard nineteenth-century analogies before coming to his crowning analogy of the institution. The first analogy recalls the early Darwin : The work of each individual is done unpremeditatedly, or as it were unconsciously ; each is intent only on using the common possession for his own benefit, serving these with his private ends ; but each is thus at the same time an actor in the great work of perpetuating and of shaping the general speech. So each separate polyp on a coral bank devotes himself simply to the securing of his own food, and excretes calcareous matter only in obedience to the exigencies of his individual life; but, as the joint result of the isolated labour of all, there slowly</page><page sequence="16">2oo Clive Bush rises in the water the enormous coral cliff, a barrier for the waves to dash themselves against in vain.67 Thus individual selfishness builds a crystallised pile of shit which works for the common good. It is the dream of liberal economics. Since Whitney says these "considerations" determine the character of the study of language "as a historical or moral science," we are obliged to take them seriously.68 His next analogy is evolutionary and relates to organ development in the human body. Whitney appears more interested, however, in the fact of the organic life-cycle ("birth, increase, decay and death"69) than in adaptiveness ? perhaps again reflecting a certain stoicism and fatalism about disappearing languages. His third analogy is a more full-blooded Darwinian one of individual variation and natural selection. In a footnote Whitney approves Lyell's "lucid and able analogical argument bearing on the Darwinian theory of the mutation of species " in the Antiquity of Man (1863), while disapproving Schleicher's Die Darwinische Theorie und die Sprachwissenschaft (1863) because he takes analogy for truth.70 Whitney's fourth analogy is from geology: "the science of language is, as it were, the geology of the most modern period."71 Geology is probably the most conventional and most-used analogy for language in the nineteenth century. Emerson talked of words as fossils ; Whitney calls them rolled pebbles. As Whitney nears the end of his argument, still ambivalent about the role of analogy, he concludes, " Language is in fact an institution ? the word may seem an awkward one, but we can find none better or more truly descriptive. "72 The analogies of the coral reef, the organism, natural selection, and geology are summed up in the analogy of language as "institution." It is an analogy whose common-sense meaning is politically ambivalent in the late nineteenth century America where "the will and consent of men" seemed impotent against "unconscious growth." The era of Enlightenment political hope in which people seemed free to make their own institutions was threatened by what institutions themselves had become. Perhaps the key institution of the period was the newly legalised limited company whose signs were arbitrary, whose person was a legal fiction, whose individual stocks were at the mercy of the aggregate, and (from the point of view of the small stockholder) in Whitney's phrase "whose single part is conscious and intentional ; [but whose whole]... is instinctive and natural. " What 67 Silverstein, ed., Whitney on Language, 19. 68 Ibid., 19. 69 Ibid., 19. 70 Ibid., IQ n. 71 Ibid., 20. 72 Ibid., 21.</page><page sequence="17">Linguists from Whitney to S apir 201 Whitney says of language as an institution applies equally to that unconscious collective power of the corporations and finance institutions of the twentieth century which are frequently "unrecognised in their working, but inferrable from their effects."73 IV Boas's own account of himself and his intellectual development is as lucid an introduction to his work as that by any of his commentators : On account of my intense emotional interest in the phenomena of the world, I studied geography ; on account of my intellectual interest, I studied mathematics and physics. In preparing my doctor's thesis I had to use photogeometric methods to compare intensities of light. This led me to consider the quantitative values of sensations. In the course of my investigations I learned to recognise that there are domains of our experience in which the concepts of quantity, of measures that can be added or substracted like those with which I was accustomed to operate, are not applicable. "74 The most superficial glance over Boas's life-work shows the presence of a radical plurality of methods and study, accompanied by a profound humanism.75 What is often taken for Boas's positivism is in fact a willingness to use a plurality of methods. Special pleading on either side will come unstuck when the full range of work ? in statistics, physical anthropology, cultural method, metaphor and myth ? is taken into account. Out of respect to this diversity I shall take two contrasting moments: the first is the well-known paper on "Alternating Sounds," the second a partially historical account of the Raven myth of the Tlingit. In relation to the first my approach will differ from that of the linguistic historians who have chiefly confined their attention to a possible parallel with an article by Horatio Hale, "On some doubtful or immediate articulations" and who have, on the whole, found the article a little disappointing: "his analysis of alternating sounds' is a fascinating anticipation of phonemic analysis but not more."76 The specialist historian's view of the past's imagined future may impoverish the significance of texts, particularly scientific ones. Boas found that the problem as to whether sounds alternated in recognisable words of ethnic languages could in fact only be solved by a combination of physical, psychological, and even philosophical approaches. 73 Ibid., 24. 74 A Franz Boas Reader, 42. 75 See George W. Stocking, "The Boas Plan," in Hymes, ed., Studies, 481. 76 Hymes, Essays, 143.</page><page sequence="18">202 Clive Bush Boas begins by summing up psychological work on what was then called sound blindness. Experiments conducted with school children showed that " sounds are not perceived by the hearer in the way in which they have been pronounced by the speaker. "77 Boas's conclusion is that we classify according to the sounds we know in our own language. Scholars of different nationalities demonstrated their own national bias when they attempted to write down unwritten languages. Boas perceived two sources of previous error. Any pronounced sound varied about a hypothetical axis so it was difficult to assign it a fixed place for the purposes of writing. Second, in ignorance of semantic content, a word might well be wrongly isolated and written down. In fact "alternating sounds are in reality alternating apperceptions of the same sound."78 Boas's bottom line is self-reflective awareness. No amount of phonetic training and abstraction will help unless the bias of analytic assumption is itself analysed. The original notion of "alternating sounds" which also supported an a priori notion of " primitiveness " was therefore a scientific error. Perhaps even more interesting is the way Boas argues his case, for he does it by way of a scientific analogy. First he outlines a strictly physiological argument. Physiology shows that the way we emit sounds has a knock-on effect from one sound to another; as in the nose, throat and mouth ? so in the receiving tympanum. This process is then made into an analogy to reinforce the authenticity of psychological cause and effect. The physical and psychological worlds were, at the time, bound into a continuity by using the theory of evolution to connect them "historically." "Distance in time" therefore becomes an important concept and is even reflected at the empirical level of enquiry. Boas states the psychologist's discovery that where sensations have short time or space between them we are likely to make mistakes from physical causes ; where the distance is lengthened the mistakes are liable to be made by mental causes ? that is, by memory lapse. In linguistics proper identifiable units of " least difference " helped to foster an atmosphere in which the concept of the "phoneme" could develop. For the psychologist as for Boas, the problem of how to recognise a new sensation became urgent. Boas by-passed certain obvious philosophical problems in his use of the word "apperceived": "a new sensation is apperceived by means of similar sensations that form part of our knowledge."79 Boas wished to avoid tainting his argument with any suggestion of "consciousness" or 77 Boas, "On Alternating Sounds" (1889), in A Fran? Boas Reader, 7$. 78 Ibid, 76. 79 Ibid, 74.</page><page sequence="19">Linguists from Whitney to S apir 203 mentalism. There was something of a discontinuity between his psycho physiological argument and conclusions which in part depended on semantic inference. Boas's excursions in psycho-physiology may at least partly be seen as designed to provide a scientific rhetoric of persuasion for his humanist conclusions to be taken seriously. When "alternating sounds" are scientifically understood, languages are seen not to be "primitive." When we turn to myth we have an opposite movement. Here paradoxically empirical investigation will limit a universalist psychology as the basis of investigating myth. Unlike most anthropologists before or since, Boas wanted to restore both consciousness and history to myth : " It seems to my mind that the characteristic trait of nature myths is the association between the obscure cosmic events and what might be called a novelistic plot based on the form of social life with which people are familiar."80 This remarkable statement is unfortunately not developed in any detail in Boas's work, for that novelistic plot is still hampered by evolutionary paradigms. While this means that he is endlessly curious about actual historical events of the past and their representation, he also inherits his century's notion that truth resides in the uncovering of origins. One of the best examples of Boas's treatment of myth, historically and structurally, occurs in an essay in The International Quarterly for 1905 and is reproduced in Stocking's The Shaping of American Anthropology\ 1883-1911 : a Fran% Boas Reader. Boas compares the Russian Alexander BaranofFs account of his occupation of Kodiak in southern Alaska in the late 1790s and his subsequent dealings with the Sitka, with a myth clearly related to the historical event told by Sitka Indian descendents. In the Russian account Baranoff establishes Fort Michael by treaty in 1799 anc* invites the Indians to attend the dedication; they refuse, mocking the bearer of the invitation. Baranoff then demands an explanation by walking into the village courageously and unprotected. The Indians are impressed. When Baranoff temporarily leaves the settlement, however, the Indians attack the fort and massacre the diminished guard. Baranoff returns in 1804 to exact revenge. There is a bloody battle in which Baranoff is wounded and the Indians make their escape by night. In the Native American version as Boas tells it the main differences are as follows. The messenger is mocked by having his face painted, the two military encounters become Indian victories, and Nanak (Baranoff) 80 Boas, "Racial Capacity and Cultural Determinism" (1909), in A Fran% Boas Reader, 250.</page><page sequence="20">204 Clive Bush becomes an Odysseus figure (Boas's parallel) looking for his wife and son who perished in the second battle, and then having adventures, three of which at least are recognisable Native American myths. The first involves Nanak/Baranoff arriving at an island containing only women. The Russian and his men are prevented from taking wives by a log with teeth representing their husbands. This Boas recognises as an Eskimo tale. The second event, involving shadowy feathers of a Raven preventing the Russians from carrying away otter skins, belongs to the Raven myth of the Tlingit. The third occurs when Nanak/Baranoff lets down a bucket of fresh water to people of the undersea world which is then returned filled with money. This is related to a Tlingit origin-myth involving a whirlpool "through which the ebb-tide rushes to the lower world and from which the flood tide returns."81 Boas's prime concern with the myth was how it originated and how it was geographically distributed. Today, however, Boas's double narrative illustrates at one level Kristeva's distinction between monologic and Menippean discourse. In the official account the elements of God, history, monologism, Aristotelian logic, system and narrative are exemplified in Baranoff s dedication of the fort to St. Michael, the use of sequential narrative, the emphasis on judicious decision-making, the silent unproblematised authorial voice, cause-and effect logic: the discourse, in short, of a successful boss of a trading company. In the second account, which serves a different function - how to palliate defeat, if defeat it was - the messenger is returned as a clown promising carnival reversals; the logic is co-relational, and the narrative relies on more than narrative content for its effects. Boas says, " The native story teller has filled out the unknown parts of the life of the admired Baranoff with wonderful exploits."82 The Native American version confronts the historical moment with the magic time of story, registers at least ambivalence about Baranoff as hero, reduces the humiliations of power, and in the episode of the money returned for water ? for all the adventures are about theft from Native Americans - tells rulers, as Shakespeare's fools do, how they should act. Here, however, the plot thickens. For what Kristeva's distinction does not involve is the dramatic perception of types of plot across cultures. Might not the Sitkas' account appear monologic to them within their own culture? Might it not be just as official to them as the Baranoff account was to his audience within the assumptions of the Russian trading company ? The act of reading compels us to realise that it is of course Boas who is giving us both accounts, and the Native American discourse appears Menippean from his perspective 81 Boas, "The Mythologies of the Indians" (1905), in A Fran% Boas Reader, 139. 82 Ibid, 139.</page><page sequence="21">Linguists from Whitney to S apir 205 and (if we merely stopped at Kristeva's formal dualism) by implication from ours also. For the representation of carnival can be both official and unofficial. A more subtle interpretation might suggest that the presence of both discourses is necessary as an imperfect mirroring device to bolster the apparent impartiality of the omniscient narrator. In fact colonialist narrative assumes a higher authority from its discourse of narrative fact if simultaneously mythic discourse can be relegated to the sphere of the fantastic. Yet Boas's clear love of the mythic leaves us feeling ambivalent about his strategy of dividing the physical event from the psychological truth : the one a truth of the conqueror the other a truth of the defeated. It is at this point that a reading of the two narratives can be saved from pluralistic relativity. A discourse submitted in defeat against aggression, might be "official," but where the content ofthat discourse can be related to a clear disparity between peoples' ability to control their own destiny ? the examples of myth here being related to historical theft from Native Americans - the carnival-like aspects of the story become (as judged by us in our own time and from our knowledge of the history of genocide in American history) genuinely "unofficial" and therefore critical. The cultural clash is a priori and historical in the profoundest sense, and while no structural dualism can therefore be relied on to suggest an automatic evaluation of the events which appear within it, it can help turn ambivalence into contradiction and formal structure into a critique.83 V Boas would have agreed with Baudrillard that "mythic contents" do much more than bind society together through the "cohesion" of "belief systems."84 Yet there was a profound sense in which Leonard Bloomfield did just that, using language rather than myth. For Bloomfield narrative becomes merely illustrative of a scientistic psychology which thus remains conveniently undisturbed. It is well-known that Bloomfield was much indebted to Albert Paul Weiss's book, A Theoretical Basis for Human Behaviour (1929); yet behind that book, too, lie other texts in social psychology and scientific management. Unlike Boas, Weiss refused to believe that anything not covered by "hard science" was worth an intelligent person's time. All else was "anthropomorphism" and "intuitionism" which "in the past have moulded social organisation."85 83 I should like to thank Dr. David Murray of Nottingham University for his comments on the original drafts of the foregoing paragraph. 84 Baudrillard, 11-12. 85 Albert Paul Weiss, A Theoretical Basis of Human Behavior (Columbus, Ohio: R. G. Adams, 1929), v.</page><page sequence="22">2o6 Clive Bush For Weiss, behaviourism - a term he strongly and polemically defended - was based on the truths of physics. Weiss was unworried that those truths might be in contention. The structure of matter and behaviour was isomorphic. Human behaviour was a form of motion. Weiss's rhetoric drew on a simple world of Manichean struggle between honest scientists and an evil empire of metaphysicians: "Poetry, religion, morality, affection, love, intellect," he says, "for the poet will seem to be a matter of sensations, images, feelings, and spirit, rather than electron-proton configurations."86 The scientistically inclined have never failed to tell poets what reality is. For Weiss there is no Jamesian hesitation between physics and the psyche. Individualisation and socialisation are the happy hunting-ground of motor functions: "Neurologically the word happi ness indicates the extent to which the innate and acquired components of sensory-motor function approach an optimum relationship between the antagonistic processes of individualisation and socialisation."87 Behind Weiss's "scientific" statements was a drive for social control. He asserts that any scientific social control programme will be better than a non scientific one, and there are plenty of problems in what he calls the "social conditions" of "crime, taxation, international relations, artistic produc tion, and free speech."88 Weiss lived in an American era when Paul T. Frankl, an American furniture designer, said of the increasing " stream lining" infatuation - "Simple lines.. .tend to cover up the complexity of the machine age. If they do not do this, they at least divert our attention and allow us to feel ourselves master of the machine."89 Weiss praised Leonard Bloomfield's approach to language, particularly his notion of form as " The vocal features common to same or partly same utterances," and his idea of meaning as the "corresponding stimulus reaction features."90 Yet Weiss admits that the psychological problem of meaning is more extended, and here he introduces the "bio-social" mediation of behaviourism. Behind Weiss is the scientific management movement with its watchwords of efficiency, absence of conflict, instrumentality and adjustment, at a high point of seientistic arrogance in our century. Thinking is replaced by "problem-solution behaviour";91 the freedom of the will is an illusion based upon the "inability to discriminate the origin of implicit reactions."92 The expressions of "fear" and "sorrow" have little "biosocial utility under the reduced activity of 86 Ibid., 67. 87 Ibid., M7. 88 Ibid., 450. 89 Frankl, quoted in Jeffrey L.

Method in Weiss becomes pure teleology ? an ironic result for one who thought he had rid himself of such a clearly outmoded philosophic illusion. Bellamy's white city of Utopian technological efficiency has extended its promise to the engineering of human behaviour. Bloomfield's Language (1933) shows the effects of this kind of thinking. In a context of obligatory sneers at literature, Bloomfield asserts that philologists and literary critics can save themselves a lot of time by turning to observation of normal speech. Thus democratically justified, Bloomfield observes an act of speech?utterance under very simple circumstances : Suppose that Jack and Jill are walking down a lane. Jane is hungry. She sees an apple in a tree. She makes a noise with her larynx, tongue and lips. Jack vaults the fence, climbs the tree, takes the apple, brings it to Jill, and places it in her hand. Jill eats the apple.96 Certainly exemplifying narrative has become a lot simpler since Boas's observations on Tlingit myth. Bloomfield's " analysis " is, however, simply expanded narrative. The structure of the speech utterance - (a) practical events preceding the act of speech, (b) speech, (c) practical events following the act of speech ? is atomised further by simply adding story lines : If Jill has been alone, she might have been just as hungry and thirsty and might have seen the same apple. If she had sufficient strength and skill to get over the fence and climb the tree, she could get over the fence and climb the tree, she could get hold of the apple and eat it ; if not, she would have to stay hungry. The lone Jill is in much the same position as the speechless animal. If the animal is hungry and sees or smells food, it moves toward the food ; whether the animal succeeds in getting the food, depends upon its strength and skill. The state of hunger and the sight or smell of the food are the stimulus (which we symbolise by S) and the movements toward the food are the reaction (which we symbolise by R). The lone Jill and speechless animal act in only one way, namely S-&gt;R97 Fortunately the dashing Jack "performed actions that were beyond Jill's 93 Ibid., 403. 94 Ibid., 409. 95 Ibid., 415. 96 Leonard Bloomfield, Language (London: George Allen and Unwin, 1979), 22. 97 Bloomfield, 23-4.</page><page sequence="24">2o8 Clive Bush strength, and in the end Jill got the apple."98 Boas would have sniffed out a certain myth of origins. This work is still a standard text, and a contemporary British paperback excerpts recent accolades from The Sunday Times, The New Statesman and the Journal of Education. As much as the oppressively limited view of human activity and the obvious sexism, simple minded scientism is a serious issue. It assumes that all problems are solvable in the methods of one problem (no one denies Bloomfield's pre eminence in narrowly defined areas of linguistics), that expertise on one subject enables you to pass judgement on others you have not studied, that the "simplest case" by mystical extension ensures solutions to complex cases, and that contending discourses can be resolved by the obliteration of all others in favour of one. It was Whorf who stated the obvious and with refreshing clarity: "Behaviorism does not show us which lines to work upon in order to be really in accord with human intangibles, except by way of announcing in behavioristic terms, things already obvious to common sense."99 And further, "Words and morphemes, which make the categories and patterns in which linguistic meaning dwells, are not motor reactions."100 VI Sapir, like other linguists discussed in this paper was deeply concerned with the relations between language and culture. The critics remind us that his "view of the relation between language and culture, between linguistics and anthropology, was a continuously changing one. Beginning with ideas and problems set by Boas, he continued to develop their implications, partly in terms of an internal logic, partly in response to factors around him, until his death."101 Aberle has given the fullest account of that development : at first Sapir minimally connects language and culture through aspects of unconscious form, then denies any connection at all, and then in the late 1920s begins to relate culture to unconscious patternings of socialised behaviour, and language to powerful patternings of world view. Finally language becomes a symbolic guide to culture. My own view is that Sapir varies his emphasis among fairly constantly conceived sets of problems throughout his career. For example in 1912, discussing the typical 1890s subject of "environment," he insists, like 98 Bloomfield, 24. 99 Whorf, 41. 100 Whorf, 67; from "A Linguistic Consideration of Thinking in Primitive Com munities." 101 Hymes, Essays, 160.</page><page sequence="25">Linguists from Whitney to S apir 209 Boas, on social and physical "forces." This view does not change much except in the early part of the career the "forces" are seen, in liberal fashion, as operating on the "individual," and by the 1930s the individual has been changed into "personality."102 C. Wright Mills reminds us that the marketing of " celebrities " in the 1920s, as a behavioural reinforcement of success and competition for the masses, made the entire human image into "A Personality."103 The question is whether Sapir rescues the word for human will and conduct. Does "personality" perform unconsciously and consensually in the same way as Saussure's langue is supposed to perform paroled Or does Sapir's " personality " drift from fashion to fashion with some kind of universal market circulating through it? There is a sense in which Sapir's linguistic perspective on culture is not free of "personality" conceived as drifting down a stream of natural process. Like Brinton, Sapir turned increasingly to somewhat idiosyncratically defined psychiatric and quasi-medical solutions in later years. These are bound up with the notion of organism. His ideal of what he calls a "healthy spiritual organism" turns out to be "Athenian culture of the Age of Pericles."104 There Sapir found his possible solution to Bloomfieldian mechanism, hierarchies of high and low culture (never mind that Greek culture was based on slavery), and to "European" culture snobbery. Sapir also has a moral fable to rival Bloomfield's Jack and Jill; it is the telephone girl and the American Indian.105 Worth reading in full for its nuances, its essence is that the Indian, spearing salmon, is culturally a higher type than the telephone girl on the grounds of differentiation of task and fulfilment. Once more a woman takes second place. The point of view is in fact aristocratic, pastoral and nostalgic, and the simplistic contrast offered between the mechanical and the organic relies on images as static as any of those in Mason's alcoves at the Chicago Exhibition of 1915. When Sapir turns from representative individuals to groups there are not dissimilar problems relating to the state of health of their spirituality. Sapir rejects social?psychological divisions into primary (face-to-face) and secondary groups, and realigns that duality into a continuous line bounded by childhood at one end and adulthood at the other. Early-life groups are genetic; later-life groups are symbol-oriented. Brinton's mind 102 The O.E.D. gives the first use of "personality" as "celebrity" around 1889. 103 Q Wright Mills, The Power Elite (New York: Oxford University Press, 1959), 75. 104 Edward Sapir, Selected Writings of Edward Sapir in Language, Culture and Personality, ed. and intro.

In the era of the New Deal, Sapir says that an example of the genetic group might be the family or the state. An example of symbolism-based groups might be a labor union or a political party. Here, however, Sapir becomes a little politically nervous, and quickly adds that "symbolism-based" groups are liable to "psycho logical transference" in the Freudian sense: "membership in a labor union with a dominant leader may have the value of an unconscious psychological recall of one's childhood participation in the family."106 Unfortunately Sapir seems unaware that similar psychological recalls tend to be represented politically in many different ways. A biased press will be quick to point out "father-complexes" in a labor union, but as any presidential campaign will show, it will encourage them in relation to the State. Finally Sapir's most famous notion of social and linguistic process is drift. "Language," says Sapir, "moves down a current of its own making. It has drift."107 Since this statement has elements of nineteenth-century historicism, Sapir is quick to defend himself from a charge of mysticism. Drift has direction, and Sapir confines himself to linguistic examples ; to distinctions increasingly levelled, as a language develops, between subject and object, to fixed sentence positions, to the invariable word. This aspect of drift is ultimately derived from diffusionist theories of group change originally applied to species. For Sapir it is reinforced by unconscious change in language form and structure and a re-socialised view of langue in the Whitney?Saussure tradition, registered at the level of the abstract group. However, Sapir also uses the term "drift" to characterise general culture. Here direction is seen in terms of individual transformation of goal - a Jamesian envisaging of ends - which belongs not to imagination, opportunity, social encouragement, but to - again Jamesian - tempera ment. The transformation of ends thus briefly outlined is far from an accomplished fact ; it is rather an obscure drift in the history of values, an expression of the volition of the more sensitive participants in our culture. Certain temperaments feel themselves impelled far along the drift, others lag far behind.108 C. Wright Mills in his uncompromising way offers some explanations for the popularity of "drift": 106 Sapir, 361. 107 Edward Sapir, Language, An Introduction to the Study of Speech (1921 ; rpt. New York and London: A Harvest/HBJ Book, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1949), 150. 108 Sapir, Selected Writings, 320.</page><page sequence="27">Linguists from Whitney to Sapir 211 The view that all is blind drift is largely a fatalist projection of one's own feeling of impotence and perhaps, if one has ever been active politically in a principled way, a salve of one's own guilt... To accept either view ? of all history as conspiracy or of all history as drift - is to relax the effort to understand the facts of power and the ways of the powerful.109 VII What I hope to have made clear in the course of this essay are a few of the ways in which late nineteenth-century linguistics related to discourses other than itself and with which it was necessarily engaged. The pioneering work of American linguists - particularly in their challenge to the hegemony of Indo-European paradigms ? did not develop along a smooth path, nor was the rhetoric of pluralism, the abandonment of centrist prejudices and the procedure of objective classification without new biases and indeed rather less than liberal attitudes. The political defeat of the Native Americans is, from our perspective, noticeable in the discourses between culture and language. Nor is the defeat confined to Native Americans. The engagement of linguistics with the then-current psychology and sociology, assumptions about what a "society" was, all reflect, in various ways and at various levels of the texts, a new America which was emerging from the 1880s onwards. In every text there are elements which look both forward and backward. Boas's new pro fessionalism sat uneasily with his political convictions. Kinship studies could give linguistic enterprise analogies and working assumptions with which to detail the appearance of the singular within the structure of the multiple and vice versa, thus ensuring a recognition that cultural patterns differed. At the same time it de-emphasised time and the organisation of power implicit in any human activity. The attack on evolutionism and historicism in turn produced its own metaphysics largely concerned with authenticating a kind of fatalism about large general structures whether of grammar or of society. More scientific procedures in relation to both language and cultures ran the risk of turning other human beings into objects of the scientific gaze, and a certain arrogance and anti-humanist bias produced a countervailing dogmatism to rival any nineteenth-century evolutionist. Aspects of the general culture appear in the most moderate and balanced of discourses ; Whitney's grand analogy of the "institution" is a case in point. Both psychology and behavioural psychology played 109 Mills, 27.</page><page sequence="28">212 Clive Bush major roles in connecting linguistics with culture and contributed their own brands of unconscious motivations and models of change. As the older ethnology passed into the more professional anthropology, the complex patterns of issues which had their birth in the nineteenth century underwent certain transformations in terms of emphasis and selection of problems. At best a new relativism pled the cause of difference and otherness; at worst the old problems emerged in new guises. In contemporary America the debates about language and the debates about culture continue with undiminished force. To take but two examples, Clifford Geertz valiantly attempts to rescue mind from the behaviourists and social scientists. Hymes ends his Foundations in Socio Linguistics with an eighteenth-century vision that considers "mankind" and "linguistics" working toward a "unity" yet to come.110 Hymes's unity in the future gives a ideological tinge to Sapir's ends in pious drift, accompanied by quasi-utopian prophecy. Geertz still does not reckon with the actual means of political power, and Hymes struggles between the Talcott Parsons and the Marx in himself. One lesson of this essay is that the academy's thoughts on language and culture are not immune from the pressures of politics. Boas failed to prevent the use of early anthropological linguists as spies for the American government in Mexico. During the McCarthy era Swadesh was forced out of American academic life as a result of his political views.111 The first quotation that heads this essay shows that the relation of one culture and one language to another always involves questions of power. The biography of Sir William Jones reminds us: In the parliamentary election of 1780, as a candidate for the University of Oxford [Sir William Jones's] detestation of the American War and of the slave trade were too strongly expressed to be agreeable to the voters, and he was forced to withdraw from the contest. In the same year he failed to secure election as Professor of Arabic in the University for similar reasons.112 110 Dell Hymes, Foundations in Sociolingustics: An Ethnographie Approach (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1974), 209. 111 Hymes, Essays, 273fr. 112 Edwin Ardener, "Introductory Essay: Social Anthropology and Language," in Ardener, ed., Social Anthropology and Language (London: Tavistock Publications, 1971), lxix.</page></plain_text>
