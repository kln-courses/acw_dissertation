Copyright 1997 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc. ABSTRACT Global engineering is increasingly becoming a prac- tice within the automotive industry. Due to added engineering and manufacturing benefits, more and more new vehicles are being developed with common structure to meet the consumer needs in many local regions. While vehicle development and manufacturing process is becoming global, automotive safety regulations in various parts of the world have not been as uni- form. A good example is the differing requirements for dynamic side impact protection of new vehicles. United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and European Union (EU) have each produced their own distinct test procedures such as, different barrier faces, impact configu- rations, and anthropomorphic test devices (dummies). Although both test procedures have the same final objective - estimate occupant responses in side impacts, they differ greatly in execution and emphasis on occupant response requirements. This paper discusses the differences in both side impact test procedures and vehicle &amp; dummy performance in each case. Both dynamic side impact test data and analytical models are employed for this purpose. A full vehicle dummy- structure finite element is developed to investigate the two test conditions. Comparison of a typical vehicle performance such as, door and bodyside intrusion profiles, contact velocities with dummies, dummy kinematics in both test conditions are exam- ined closely. It is determined that although each test induces different loading and responses, there may be some commonal- ity in impacted vehicle performance. As the side impact regula- tions are still evolving both in USA and Europe, it appears that a unified approach for developing side impact countermeasures to meet the more demanding test condition may result in test mode simplification and robust side impact designs in new vehicles. One of the ideas examined in this paper is designing global new vehicles with a unified NHTSA/European proce- dure that simulates NHTSA side impact conditions with two EUROSID1 dummies, one in the front and one in the rear seat of the impacted vehicle. INTRODUCTION At present, two different side impact test procedures exist in North America and Europe. These are the US NHTSA FMVSS 214 and European Directive 96/27/EC dynamic side impact procedures. A NHTSA or European dynamic side impact test is composed of four basic elements. These are: Test vehicle in stationary position with appropriate weight and instrumentation, Deformable barrier to simulate striking vehicle stiffness at a specified velocity, Anthropomorphic Test Devices (ATD) to help measure injury risk during impact, and Test requirements based on various dummy responses. Although both side impact test procedures have the similar objectives to provide understanding of vehicle and occupant responses, considerable differences exist in all four major entities described above. The procedures have unique dummies and barrier faces in each case. Comparison of Test Procedures The NHTSA dynamic side impact procedure was developed for passenger cars sold in the United States. It is being extended to truck vehicles (&lt; 6000 lbs GVWR) on Sep- tember 1, 1998. The test uses U.S. DOT SID dummies located in the front and rear seats on the impacted side. The barrier is of honeycomb construction with different strength of honey- comb in barrier bumper (245 psi) and barrier body (45 psi). It represents an average U.S. vehicle size and stiffness. The bar- rier impacts with a crabbed angle of 27° to the target vehicle at 33.5 mph. The European Directive dynamic side impact proce- dure has been developed for Ml and N1 vehicles sold in 234</page><page sequence="2">Europe and it is still evolving, mostly in the area of barrier types, vehicle/barrier height and dummy seating positions. The European test procedure differs greatly from the NHTSA side impact procedure in that the barrier face, dummy, dummy mea- surements, impact speed and direction are all different. The test uses a single EUROSID1 dummy located in the front seat on the impacted side. The barrier specification in the European side impact procedure includes corridors for load-deformation behavior. It can be constructed of dense foam or honeycomb materials. Several European barrier types are available cur- rently for side impact evaluation. These include KENMONT, UTAC, AFL, CELLBOND, FRITZMEIER, SHOWA, YOHAMA and PLASCORE constructions. The European bar- rier face is divided into six blocks with varying stiffness and represents an average European vehicle size and stiffness. The barrier impacts perpendicular to the target vehicle at 3 1 mph. Comparison of Dummies The NHTSA side impact procedure includes two US DOT SID dummies, and the European procedure requires one EUROSID1 dummy in the driver's seat on the impacted side. The dummies for the two types of tests are totally different in their construction. The Code of Federal Regulations (FMVSS 214) specifies the US DOT SID Thoracic Trauma Index (TO) and the peak lateral Pelvis acceleration as the two criteria that have to be complied with for a vehicle to pass the dynamic per- formance requirements. On the other hand, European Directive (96/27/EC) requires that the EUROSID1 dummy Head Performance (HPC), Thorax Rib Deflection, Thorax Soft Tissue (V*C), Abdominal Peak Force and Pubic Symphosis Peak Force crite- ria be used for approvals. There are several requirements, as described below, regarding the seating positions for each of these two types of dummies. SID Dummy Positioning • Seats should be placed in mechanical mid position and full down (for the first two years the dummy's H- point must be within the door aperture). Seat backs are in nominal or 25 degrees, head rests full up, lum- bar supports in lowest position and arm rests are low- ered. Dummy is placed in the front seat and rear seats on the impacted side. EUROSID1 Positioning • Seats can be placed anywhere along the full seat track travel and full down. Seat backs are in nominal or 25 degrees, head rests full up, lumbar supports in lowest position and arm rests are lowered. Dummy is placed in the front seat on the impacted side. • Arm is set at 40 degrees with respect to the dummy. Comnarison of Barriers Listed below, in Table 1, is a brief summary of NHTSA and European barriers and test conditions. Table 1: Comparison of Side Impact Barriers T es Barrier Barrier Impact Barrier es Wt Speed Angle Height NHTSA 1360 kg 15.0 m/s 27° 280 mm Euro- 950 kg 13.8 m/s o° 300 mm pean Comparing the two deformable barrier data in Table 1 , it is seen that the NHTSA barrier is heavier than the Euro- pean barrier by 410 kg. Combined with a higher initial velocity the NHTSA barrier has approximately 40% more kinetic energy at the pre-impact state than the European barrier. Based on barrier dimensions and stiffness it is also seen that NHTSA barrier is bigger and stiffer than its European counterpart as the front end of an average US vehicle is bigger and stiffer than that of an average European passenger car or light truck. Figure 1 illustrates the difference in barrier stiffness by comparing dynamic force deflection characteristics of the two deformable faces. Based only on these statistics it may look as though the NHTSA test is more formidable than the European side impact test. 40° i n NHTSA European 300 - / Î / w / « 200 - y o / „ 100--/ - ê / o-r^ T 1 1 1 O 90 100 190 ZOO 250 Displacement (mm) Figurei: Comparison of Barrier Face Force Deflection Characteristics However, the barrier footprint on the body side struc- ture must also be considered. Figure 2 illustrates how the two barrier faces are positioned against a mid size vehicle in NHTSA and European test conditions. The European barrier face being much smaller may contact only the B-pillar whereas the NHTSA barrier face may make solid contact with both hinge pillar and B-pillar. The effect of missing the hinge pillar in European test condition will be discussed further based on analysis results. 235</page><page sequence="3">Figure2: Comparison of Barrier Overlap with Bodyside (NHTSA top / European bottom) ANALYTICAL APPROACH In this study, comparisons of the US and European Directive side impact performances are made using both side impact test data and full vehicle finite element models. Of the two vehicles modeled, one is a four door mid size vehicle and the other is a four door sub compact. The finite element system models of two vehicles contained the same vehicle structure and interior plus corresponding barrier and side impact dum- mies in each test set-up. The nonlinear simulations are per- formed using the commercially available code RADIOSS. Comparisons are made for barrier and vehicle energy absorp- tion, impacted door and body side intrusion and velocities. Attempts are made to identify the vehicle components that play key a role in each test condition. Since the European procedure has only a front seat dummy, in this study the front dummy responses are compared. As different types of responses are sought in US DOT SID and EUROSID1 dummies, for comparative purpose the individual dummy responses are examined in terms of margin relative to corresponding regulatory requirements. In addition to model responses, several sets of US and European test data from three similar vehicle tests are compared for this purpose. SIDE IMPACT SYSTEM MODEL Finite element models simulating dynamic side impact test are in use in the industry for the past several years. The FEA dummy-structure system model contains the vehicle structure, trim/bolster, side impact dummy and a barrier. Details of a typical side impact dummy-structure system model have been published by several investigators [1 3,4,7,10]. The primary component of the system model is of course, the vehicle structure model, built in detail with finite elements to include all sheet metal components, door closures, interior trim/padding, as well as suspension and powertrain components. The barrier model and the SID and EUROSID1 dummies are also created using finite elements based on component crash characteristics derived from various sled test configurations [2,5,6]. The dummy models are capable of predicting the physical responses accurately and sensitive enough to localized impacts as observed in side impact vehicle tests. The side impact system models provide insight into both structural performance such as, intrusions, accelerations, velocity histories and the occupant responses at pelvic, torso and head level. ENERGY ANALYSIS A side impact test involves contact between a deform- able barrier face and the vehicle structure. Initially, the impact energy is mostly contained in the deformable barrier. As the impact proceeds the vehicle structure behaves as the primary energy absorbing component. A breakdown of the strain energy distribution between the vehicle and barrier at 25 and 50 milliseconds is shown in Figure 3 for impact against a mid size vehicle. The European barrier face absorbed about 48 per- cent of total strain energy and NHTSA barrier absorbed about 19 percent at 25 ms. At 50 ms these amounts are 39 percent and 24 percents, respectively. Both at 25 and 50 milliseconds the share of internal energy absorption by European barrier was higher than the NHTSA deformable barrier. Figure 4 indicates how the vehicle internal energy is distributed among the body structural components of the vehi- cle at 25 and 60 milliseconds. It is seen that the major struc- tural subassemblies contributing to the vehicle energy absorption are i) body side, ii) front door and iii) rear doors. The body side, front door and rear door percentages decrease at 60 milliseconds. This is primarily due to progressive inward crush of backup structures, i.e. front flow pan, seat cross mem- bers and roof panel. The rear door in the NHTSA test condition has a larger percentage of energy absorption (18.2%) than in EEC condition (11.1%). This is a direct result of the crabbed angle of the NHTSA barrier. As indicated above it appears that in both NHTSA and European procedures the body side played a large role in absorbing impact energy, followed by front and rear door systems. Figure3: Comparison of Vehicle and Barrier Energy Absorption in European and NHTSA Side Impact 236</page><page sequence="4">Figure4: Comparison of Internal Energy Absorbed by Vehicle Structure Sub-assemblies INTRUSION COMPARISON Shown in Figures 5 are the deformed bodyside geom- etries of the NHTSA and European side impact models. Figure 6 shows vehicles which have undergone similar testing. It is seen that the NHTSA model deformation pattern captures the barrier bumper imprint along the bottom of both doors and the deformation around the lower hinge pillar area. The model also captures the rear door vertical bending about mid belt line. The European model deformation pattern also matches well with what was observed in the test vehicle. Both test and model for the European Directive shows more deformation at the B-pillar and roof side rail joint when compared to that in the US proce- dure. The hinge pillar area is relatively untouched. Figure5: Comparison of Deformed Geometry at 60 milliseconds 237</page><page sequence="5">Figureó: Body Side and Door Deformation of a Vehicle in NHTSA and European Side Impacts The deformation profiles of the front and rear door at the belt line at 60 ms are shown in Figure 7. The Figure includes door profile with a typical bodyside design to meet or exceed FMVSS 214 requirements only and the door profile with stiffened bodyside structure to meet or exceed both FMVSS 214 and European Directive requirements. For the design "as is", the door beltline intrusion in European condi- tion is larger than NHTSA. However, with structural enhance- ments intrusions in European condition are close to or fall below NHTSA intrusions. The European belt line profile is somewhat circular primarily due to the normal impact and soft barrier edges whereas, NHTSA deformation pattern is flat and stretched rearward due to the crabbed velocity vector.

The more protruding NHTSA bumper pro- file and stiffer barrier face accounts for its higher H-point intrusion. This is further illustrated in Figure 9 which shows vertical profile through the dummy's H-point at 15 ms. The 238</page><page sequence="6">flatter European barrie face completely crushes the door outer panel and the NHTSA barrier face deforms only at the bottom portion of the door leaving more door volume at the top of the door at rib level. Figure9: Deformed Door Sections of NHTSA and European Barriers at 15 milliseconds FRONT DUMMY RESPONSES As mentioned earlier, the requirement for dummy response measurements in US DOT SID and EUROSID1 dum- mies are considerably different. Generally, the SID dummy responses are measured in terms of acceleration at ribs, lum- bers spine and pelvic locations. In addition to pelvic G, the other FMVSS 214 requirement. Thoracic Trauma Index (TTI), is a combination of rib and lower spine acceleration. On the other hand, the EUROSID1 measurements include many more variables, such as HPC, rib displacements, rib compression in terms of V*C, and lateral load at abdomen and pubic symphosis locations. The comparison of severity becomes harder in this case since measurements in two dum- mies are so different. However, it is generally seen that meeting the US DOT SID dummy TTI requirement is more demanding than meeting the pelvic G requirement. Similarly meeting the EUROSID1 dummy rib deflection requirement is considerably harder than others. In Tables 2 and 3, the model predicted front dummy responses of the mid size vehicle are shown against the corre- sponding requirements in NHTSA and European Directive side impact conditions.

Based on model predictions, it is seen that for European condition there is only 9 to 14 percents margin for the rib displacement requirement, where as in NHTSA condition there is a 25% margin in TTI for this vehicle. Results from prototype tests of similar vehicles are now shown in Tables 4 and 5, in this case focussing on TTI and rib displacements, respectively. 239</page><page sequence="7">Table 4: NHTSA S.I.

The average rib deflection has a 7-19% margin and in 2 cases there is even a negative margin. On the other hand, TTI in three NHTSA tests has a larger margin of 28 to 38%. DUMMY RESPONSES IN SUB COMPACT VEHICLE WITH STRUCTURAL ENHANCEMENTS Next, the performance of a sub-compact vehicle designed to meet or exceed European test requirements are dis- cussed. Considerable amount of structural enhancements in terms of bodyside reinforcement and other counter measures are added to the base design to be able to meet or exceed the European side impact requirements. The model responses in Table 6 shows that all rib deflections are meeting or exceeding the European requirements in addition to other parameter such as, HPC, V*C etc..

Both pelvic acceleration and Thoracic Trauma Index (TTI) predictions are shown in Table 7 against corresponding NHTSA requirements. Based on model responses, it is seen that the sub-compact vehicle designed for European Directive side impact is already meeting the FMVSS 214 requirements with very large margins.

Pelvic Accelera- J[ 130 | 51 61% ; tlOD({&lt;3) Thoracic trauma • 85 64 24% ! i Index (TTI) It is thus seen that both the mid size and sub compact vehicles provide similar conclusions in terms of front seat occupant responses in NHTSA and European test conditions. Both the model and test data indicate that for a specific vehicle designed with common structure and other common contents, it may be easier to meet or exceed the requirements in US test condition than the European Directive test condition. In other words, a new vehicle with common structure and restraint sys- tem may meet or exceed the US requirements once it is designed to meet or exceed the more demanding European Directive requirements. 240</page><page sequence="8">UNIFIED US/European APPROACH: NHTSA SIDE IMPACT WITH EUROSID1 DUMMIES There is one other major difference between US and European side impact conditions. In the NHTSA test, there is an additional SID dummy located at the rear seat on impacted side of the vehicle. The European test condition thus, can not provide evaluation of side impact protection for a rear seated occupant. To meet this challenge and to explore commonizing other aspects of NHTSA and European test conditions, a third test set up is being looked at in this study. This test condition uses a NHTSA test up with NHTSA barrier face impacting at 27 degree crabbed angle at 33.5 mph. However, instead of US DOT SID dummies, it uses two EUROSID1 dummies in front and rear seats on the impacted side, in same seating position exactly as in NHTSA condition. A simulation of this hybrid test up is also performed in this study. The structural responses such as door and B-pillar velocities are then compared with US and European test condi- tions as in Figure 10. FigurelO : Maximum Door and B-Pillar Velocities As expected the velocity histories are very close to NHTSA condition. Next, the front occupant responses are compared with the European test condition in Table 8; Table 8: Comparison Of Front Dummy Responses EUROSIDl European US w/ Responses Req.

For the same reason, the mid rib and lower rib deflections are much higher than the upper rib deflection. Further investigation of this unified approach is needed based on model and prototype tests of different size and weight class vehicles before any conclusion can be drawn if this is a viable alternative. CONCLUSIONS The following conclusions are derived based on com- parisons of structural and dummy responses of a mid size and a sub-compact vehicle simulating both NHTSA and European Directive dynamic side impacts: Both the model and test data indicate that for a spe- cific vehicle designed with common structure, it may be easier to meet or exceed the requirements in NHTSA test condition than in European Directive test condition. In other words, a new vehicle with com- mon structure may meet or exceed the NHTSA requirements (»če it is designed to meet or exceed the more demanding European Directive requirements. The European barrier face absorb more internal energy than the NHTSA deformable barrier. The flatter European barrier face collapses the outer door panel completely, whereas the NHTSA barrier 241</page><page sequence="9">primarily crushes the lower portion of the door. The three major energy absorbing structural compo- nents in both NHTSA and European side impact tests are the impacted body side, front door and rear door, in order of magnitude. The unified US/European test condition produces very similar structural responses, such as, intrusion and bodyside velocities of the impacted vehicle as seen in NHTSA side impact conditions. However, front dummy responses are considerably different. The unified US/European test procedure might be a potential solution to simplify side impact test modes for global vehicles. However, this finding based on analytical data of one mid size vehicle needs to be fur- ther verified using model and test data for car and truck vehicles of different size and weight class.
