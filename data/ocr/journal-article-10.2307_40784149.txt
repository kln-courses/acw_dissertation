<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHRIS GOODE &amp; SAM LADKIN Some Correspondence I want to begin with "signal to noise? the name of your performance company. It is a term I see becoming problematic in your critical writ- ings. In your article, '"These facts are variously modified': American Writers in an Information Economy" you describe the continuing susceptibility of signals to noise, of data to distortion in transit, which in an industrial context represents a problem to be solved, [but] has in oppositional subcultures become itself a carrier of information, an accepted index of non-fidelity to a prevailing ideal Fidelity to noise in composition-whether it is the intrusion of unex- pected material, suppressed content, formal interference, or the accidents of homophony - appeals to a way of reading that could, at its most extreme or pernicious, operate as a type of ludic freedom. I wonder, however, if there is something in our affective responses to hectically noisy work that overloads the spirit of "play' associated with certain readerly "freedoms'? I think it might be useful to start with a subjective account of my interest in noise in these contexts. When I set up Signal to Noise in 1999- we always describe ourselves as a theater (not performance) company, by the way: from a distance it s a distinction without a dif- ference, but the operations of noise within theater as opposed to per- formance are profoundly and consequentially different- the name was a mark of celebration at having found, in lay cybernetics, a language for describing my own observations of the theater contract. Theater, which is necessarily live (the vast bulk of theater is of course merely performance because it behaves as if it were not live), is inevitably susceptible to the inflexions of contingency. A theater practice such as mine which is not primarily literary is especially subject to multiple readings across the attentions of a diverse audience; not just subject, but vulnerable, unless the acceptance and indeed encouragement of that uncontrolled multiplicity of subjective responses and interpreta- 126 CHICAGO REVIEW</page><page sequence="2">tions is built in, as it were, to the presentation. So that what leaves the stage has already absorbed the turbulence by which it will otherwise be altered before it impacts on the spectator. There is no ulterior value to noise, in other words. It simply seems to me that the airspace, as it were, around theater is inevitably noisy, and to attempt to ignore or counteract that noise is self-defeating and futile. And, you know, why would you bother? If you have a particular message that you don t want disturbed, theater s a ridiculous medium to choose. That would be like choosing to sing into a ziplock bag instead of recording a cd. I was, at any rate, high on noise at the time that I started writ- ing poetry in my present mode. The first poems, which became the sequence "Boomer," arose out of Signal to Noises first theater piece. Without then thinking very hard about the differences between the- ater and poetry as varieties of transmission, I was interested to find analogies for what I took at that time to be a critical commitment to non-control, to the vacation of stable authority, which I felt was a delusion and a bit dirty. In a sense I was feeling my way toward a genuinely theatrical poetry. So those poems are made through manual and automated cut-ups, and countless layers of Oulipian gameplay and arbitrary constraint. I was reading a lot of Mac Low at that time, and of course Cage was always an influence. Though I wasn't so deeply into poetry that I really had any sense of discontinuity between this hardline refusal of control and the meticulously controlled work of the other poets I was into, Prynne and Barry MacSweeney and Doug Oliver. I was still really just giddy with the surface excitements of all these different poets and the thrilling unorthodoxy of their advances through language. What then happened with "Boomer" of course was that I found myself intervening much more than I'd intended, and there was sud- denly this problem, that even after stepping in to tidy things up, the work was still reading as disinterested or disengaged: whereas that root acceptance of instability and identification of the canard of sigificant authority was always meant to be a sort of flourish of engagement, an affirmative embrace of what you might call hermeneutic realism. What "Boomer" actually does, except insofar as some slivers of personal relation can be identified, is to create a rather fetishistic impression of the conditions of theatrical noise, with the originary signal somehow CHRIS GOODE &amp; SAM LADKIN 127</page><page sequence="3">erased or filtered out. I didn't recognize that in quite these terms at the time, but that was obviously the next step, some rapprochement with the signal, and furthermore some (grudging, or uncomfortable) acceptance of myself as signal. So the poetry since then has increasingly sought to dramatize a tension. But this tension is not between signal and noise, because each implies the other; its a conflict between signal and loss-of-signal, a resistance of the total occlusion of signal by noise, in conditions where noise is attractive and promiscuous and the signal is the location of all manner of cultural prestige and falsity that still needs to be refused. What s helped me think about this tension is my increasing under- standing of the signal in theater. The way, for example, that formal and structural decisions do not travel through the airspace, as such, and are much more stable in the live setting than are narratives or symbologies; the ways in which a load-bearing intimacy, and a kind of exemplary or pedagogical eroticism, between actors and audi- ence is possible and plausible; the way that the body persists within and beyond the networks of its scrutiny. All of these are dependable components of the theater signal, and they all occur increasingly in the poetry too. The question of noise in the more recent poetry, in the sense in which you seem to mean it, is somewhat more vexed. I think quick cutting and noise have to be distinguished, at least at an intentional level. I dont on purpose make the surfaces of the poetry noisy in the way that I make the surfaces of my theater noisy. The rapid cuts in much of the poetry are simply doggedly faithful to the perceptual and cognitive narratives of the struggling "I," trying to speak candidly to one insistent apprehension or dispute, in the midst of this rush of information that is both extraneous and irrecuperably insinuated into the ideosphere. In that sense, yes, the world itself is noisy, but this is only a function of the rapid turnover of apprehensive arrivals and departures: the infidelity coefficient of velocity. On a train journey, in five seconds, I see a cow lying down in a field, I think about sex (not because of the cow but because I am a man and we apparently think about sex every few seconds), I see a billboard urging me to book a holiday. Given a couple of minutes with each of these concepts I could arrive at some sort of satisfactory relation with each of them. But on the train, I am presented with a mutant, this on-rushing cow- 128 CHICAGO REVIEW</page><page sequence="4">cock-holiday, and compelled instantly to establish my relation with this grotesque, while all around me people are leaking Placebo from their iPods and talking in unfamiliar languages wherein I recognize only the phrases "Margaret Beckett" or "Simon Cowell ." The ultimate constraint in my work, then, is this: that I feel I have no business writing an out-and-out love poem until I have given a fully accurate account of my actual lived experience of the impediments to writing such a poem. So I am striving to be precise, in the poems, and if this precision and this strain after fidelity generates a sort of sensational dissonance that seems to the reader noisy and therefore functionally endorses their own relation with the work, then that's fine, insofar as the move- ment in the poems is more important than the specific instances of their top-level content. My bureaucratic organization of the poems can sometimes exert a contrary pressure, in that they tend to be blocky and not too nimble on the page; its not a disguise, exactly, but certainly a proxy. Where readerly creativity connects with this certainly does belong to the realm of noise, in that, unlike with theater, I cannot know or anticipate the event parameters of a reader s confrontation with the work: I can only assume that they are compelled to try and gauge the compatibility of my gestures with the stampede of their own private cow-cock-holidays. Hopefully its more like dancing than shopping, in the end. Your work is not neurotic, as it is predicated on a heartening willingness to listen to the outside world in all its determining and over-determined explicitness. Paranoia, though, might characterize your poetry, since paranoia locates language in the world and in the meaningful appre- hension of harm. The symptomatology of paranoia requires that all accidents of language or incident appear motivated. Readerly freedom is limited by the affective attention which is paranoia. Is this paranoid reading of motivations that document harm appropriate to your poetry? The limericks of Edward Lear, which have been an influence on your work, deliver sublimated motivations in their accidents of rhyme and syllable stress. Your use of sestina forms in No Son House is perhaps where your work most closely approaches these concerns. You're quite right to locate in this effort some shadow or implication CHRIS GOODE &amp; SAM LADKIN I 129</page><page sequence="5">of paranoia and harm. The ramifications of accident and emergency within the productions of the work unavoidably mimic, or one can at least say take after, the unregulated hyperconnectivity of paranoiac (or maniacally religious) intuitions. Again, this is partly to do with velocity, with a spectral construction of logical and affinitive rela- tions through which the user travels so quickly and frictionlessly as to perceive only an undifferentiated white light. Lear s anxiety has always seemed to me to be much more vertically organized, in terms of the abysmal nullity of languages response to Lear s own fears for it, its refusal to guarantee its promises outside its own internal transac- tions. That he felt in thrall to this literal absurdity is more, I think, to do with the dynamic inscrutability of his epilepsy, his homosexuality, and his nostalgic dysthymia; it is, as you suggest, a way of smuggling a ideological consolation into the cruelly systematic deferrals on which material language insists. Poor fellow, he wanted the word umbrella to keep him dry. Likewise, if I can t protect my reader from harm, the least I can do is to not build a shelter. You will recall that the title of the recent Matthew Barney/Joseph Beuys show at the Berlin Guggenheim was (sort of lifted from Beuys): Heal the Knife That Cuts the Wound. This fascinates me, in theater as much as poetry, and in the political and ethical activity of both: how do you enact fidelity to a wound, once the possibility of preventing it has been lost? In a way, the treatment of self-harm in "Cot death link to womb dream" and suicide in "Lapse" and "Race hazard testbed &gt; privacy statement" is about the phenomenal conjecture of these ideas at a textual level. Is self-harm a misreading of the body? Are young suicide bombers, in their militant ironization of the body and their express devotion to the recuperating reassurances of textual authority, experiencing a kind of ludic critical jouissance7. I may not personally accept these constructions, or I may not recognize my own frightened ambivalences within them; but the poetry has to, that's a necessity. In "Cot death link to womb dream" self-harm is recorded as "vivisec- tiony" "the living cut" the "spurious lossless format I vivisect crowd scene? The illegitimate "lossless format" makes self-harm a way to lose nothing of the signal the perfect transcription of pain onto the subject. I also recall these lines from "Rare motorcade, arterial bleed": "Language 130 CHICAGO REVIEW</page><page sequence="6">/ is the scab that falls away when the rifts healed" I wonder whether in these passages and in your questioning of the post-emptive ethical imperative (spurred by Heal the Knife That Cuts the Wound,) you had f.H. Prynnes Wound Response in mind? Kevin Nolan has noted that "wound response" "was Pentagon cant during the Vietnam War for a successful strike" Prynne writes, Remorse is a pathology of syntax, the expanded time-display depletes the input of "blame" which patters like scar tissue. ("Of Movement Towards a Natural Place") One reading of the Prynne quote sees remorse for wrongdoing as a pa- thology - that is, knowledge of the causes of disease, but also of sorrow. By ordering and holding harm in time, syntax separates remorse from the incidents that caused remorse. This sentimental education heals the blasphemy of the wound. Guilt is afine way to excise guilt; the feeling of remorse is punishment enough, we tell ourselves, thus replacing re- sponsibility for harm caused with a record of harm that acts as a salve to our conscience. Prynnes interrogation of the satisfactions of remorse can be related to the discussion y ou and Keston Sutherland published as "Six Bits of an Exchange." In the opening gambit, referring to texts produced by the vol- untary adoption of constraints, a question was posed concerning whether the "system-predicate attached to every detail of the resultant text [was] effectively a kind of ethical neutering" I wonder though whether poetry that makes use of formal constraints can act as an ethical model for decision-making? Might not the constrained parameters of this kind of poetry stand in for the difficulties and limitations of our lives and our world? One of the things that I think so remarkable about your work is that contingency - as evidenced by your laudable fidelity to the cow- cock-holiday - always exceeds your constraints. Not only do constraints require from you various technologies of escape but constraints and their effects are subject to intrusions, noise. Does this express something of the differences between your work and that of, say, the Oulipian Harry Mathews?His tonal restraint, flatness of affect, particularly in his recent works, seem alien to your quickness and, urn, incontinence? In his masterpiece of Burroughsian erotica, The Incredulity of Saint CHRIS GOODE &amp; SAM LADKIN 1 3 1</page><page sequence="7">Thomas, Caravaggio creates the most powerfully salient depiction of exemplary wound response that we have. (I say Caravaggio because there's nothing in the Gospel of John that says Thomas did actually poke Jesus in the side after all, despite his avowed intent and the rather generous invitation to do so.) Noise, according to Shannon, increases uncertainty: therefore, the wound- its appearance, its tangibility- must be a signal that dispels Thomas s doubt: because it encourages him into a confrontation with the physical body. Cara- vaggio, as touchingly as any boyband fan, trusts the idea only insofar as he trusts its carnal embodiment. But it's only the body below the surface that carries such authority; the surface appearance of the body may still be a depthless apparition, a commercial presentation, one of a million roaming pin-ups. So as the wound slowly heals, the body becomes less like itself, more like its image. The repetitious stabs of the "Knife" in the last lines of "The steel-workers' proposal for the decommissioning of Beaubourg" are a refusal to accept the impen- etrable breachlessness of the ideal body to the extent that it dictates the parameters of personal trust and responsibility: in the healthy mind (in the healthy body), what has become impossible? What has been forgotten? Healing is a kind of amnesia, and the sterile conditions of its prevailing are always resolutely private. What has become screened off, privileged? Consider the sheer urgency of Thomas s predicament. Where else in Jesus are you ever going to get to put your finger? In other words, the wound may be an instance of failure in the body system, but it is also a local suspension in our failure to know each other within our social system. The body thus becomes the setting for a legible signal, but also its enemy; and for as long as the wound remains, a tension exists between the tendency of the body towards closure and the tendency of the open wound toward information- giving. There is then a civic aspect to this tension, and it is, I would want to suggest, the tension that I want to hold open, not (sadistically, torturously) the wound. Viewers of Marina Abramovics "Wounded Geode" (1994) - a tabletop presentation of an amethyst geode that had been accidentally broken (and therefore opened up) in transit- are given the following guidance by the artist: Instruction for the public: Sit on the chair with feet not touching 132 | CHICAGO REVIEW</page><page sequence="8">the ground. Observe the wounded geode, for a limitless duration of time. I don t know if Abramovic originally wrote this instruction in English or if it s a translation, but the use of "the public" (rather than, say, "the viewer" or "the gallery visitor") seems to me suggestive and deliberate, particularly in the light of what she goes on to say. Firstly, by elevating the viewer, Abramovic makes the geode itself the primary "common ground" of the piece. But secondly, and more importantly, what is that "limitless"? Is the instruction - as I first read it, at the Fruitmarket in Edinburgh- to sit and observe for as long as you please; or, as I now read it, to sit forever, in a spatially fixed relation to the permanent and insoluble tension of this open wound? (The tension in this case is of course slightly different, because this wound can and will never heal: but the anthropomorphic projection redescribes the same situation in equally balanced metaphorical terms. The pressure is constant, the impossibility of intervention equally freighted, the beauty of the multifaceted interior of the amethyst no less germane to the reme- dial impulse in the onlooker.) Fve written elsewhere, in an essay on Géraldine Monk, about the pun as a kind of drone, "in which the interfèrent cross-reverberation of two meanings creates a kind of beating effect": this mineral wound would therefore be just such a pun. I think Lear, paranomasiac duck-rabbit-hunter, would have sat limitlessly weeping with the geode. Necessarily, the wound that does not heal implies, in this civic con- text, an imperative to - what dare we call it? - relevance? Abramovic s instructions prevent the wounded geode ever becoming detraumatized by the recuperative hospitality of the gallery. You have to keep hitting refresh. I'm saying this happens in a public place, absolutely, because it has a mnemonic value. The perseverance of the wound is - not just represents, but is- the persistence of the memory of the slight, in value and in consequence. Think about the medieval "Corpus Christi Carol," famously set by Britten (and recorded by Jeff Buckley, of course: one of the reasons for his grim cameo in "Cot death link to womb dream"): And in that bed there lithe a knight His woundes bleding day and night. CHRIS GOODE &amp; SAM LADKIN 133</page><page sequence="9">(Presumably this is Prynne s reference in "The Wound, Day and Night," though I don t know for sure.) At any rate, and whether this is or isn't a Christian allegory, the perpetually bleeding wound stands at once for memorial and for resistance, in a way that seems even to recall Pater s somewhat devotional desire "to burn always ," railing quaintly against Helmholtz and the heat death of the universe. (There is a smart final leap to be made here, back to Shannon and information entropy, but I dont trust myself not to look down midway and go all plummety.) This all may seem to be at (at least) one remove from the poetry, except at a pictorial level. But there is a strong fascination for me in the stigmatic nature of language. When our action hero - Wound Man, perhaps - is speared (yet again) in the thigh and exclaims "AAAARRGGH," we can all observe a phenomenon of sympathy: a corresponding wound opens up in language. Words fail him, and in his rhapsodic expression of that failure, he emits a variety of noise that may be moving toward or away from verbal language but is not itself quite language. He does not become more articulate (and this may understandably feed back into the pain circuit): he becomes more precise, he makes a vocalization more approximate to his distress. This correspondence between physical pain and wounded language is only an extreme (and, of course, for our many victims, no longer extreme) instance of the pressure exerted by the physical claims of the verbalizing body on the organization of its utterances in countless different ways: and poetry always has been and always must be (quite explicitly, I think) indicative of these parameters - breath management perhaps above all. But the more persuasive proposition I suppose concerns the reciprocal exploitation ofthat stigmatic cor- respondence: the deliberate creation of open wounds within language, wounds that function memorially in the preserved tension between healing and information. The question that pertains is the one I refer to in "Virtual drive capacity in the problem bird": "how to apply. . .the wound to the body." In a way, this merely summarizes the challenge to the reader: to intervene remedially in these poems, to act recupera- tively to soothe the cuts, to graft language or image from elsewhere onto the gaping ellipses; or, alternatively, to work to preserve the signal, to apply it to her own body, however she may understand that task. The ethical underscore here is, simply, that the invoked body (the model body within the poem) is public, communal; in other words, 134 | CHICAGO REVIEW</page><page sequence="10">at the level of language, vivisection and self-harm are indistinguish- able. Not entirely premeditatedly, "Cot death link to womb dream" narrates a terrible encounter with the truth ofthat, and with the erotic radiance ofthat truth. (Where is it that Bataille says Tm losing blood as I speak"? Rampant hemophilia as the hysterical expression of an ecstatic refusal to be assimilated.) The combustion between constraint and contingency in your writ- ing is a highly pressurized, volatile straining of the bureaucratic. The movement of information by bureaucracies smoothes the rough texture of our lives into "the likeness of the fact." Bureaucracy is the speed at which information is moved yoked to the power attendant in stopping it. Bureaucracies collate information by reductive generality and your poetry struggles to uncover the lives submerged in this abstraction. Paranoid, too, because the bureaucratic collation of evidence is an act of surveillance. Suddenly Vm at Kafka and the implication of guilt in all bureaucratic transactions, this time without that personal touch of the actual presence of bureaucrats. The passport office in the uk reads ominously: "Everyone is unique. Let us keep it that way." And as we graft ourselves onto our passports as biometrie data, information, identity, and the body become ever more inseparable. You opened No Son House with a quote from the 2001 census re- port about the disappearance of 900,000 young men from the predicted total population. This fact hides a very public wound, the people whose lives have become registered only by their anomalous negative existence in the balance books of the body politic. I wonder whether your poetry works by confounding and exploding such statistical error margins? We are (circular breathing) speeding up the body gameplay, swift slam crash the admin cortex checkbox cervical vertebrae scapula thoracic vertebrae tailfin cockpit travelator runaround bracelet cherry Vans red channel fallback pants. Swallow. Swift Lumbar vertebrae. Rear view mirror. Dog in the garden, basking idiot smile. Language is the scab that falls away when the rifts healed. ("Rare motorcade, arterial bleed") Is this the administrated body, vivisected into checkbox and salvageable CHRIS GOODE &amp; SAM LADKIN I 135</page><page sequence="11">only by glitch-strewn category errors? By which I mean, yes, tell me about your use of the sestina. Is it a feedback loop? A paranoid nexus? A bureaucrat cc-ing himself into his email? Since you sent your last email, you'll have enjoyed, no doubt, as I did, the emergence of the news that the microchip units in our brave new e-passports have a twenty-four-month warranty. After which, pre- sumably - for the rest of the ten-year lifespan of your passport - the stability of your identity as a traveler can no longer be guaranteed. This feels to me like a big step forward but I don t think it's quite what the Home Office were after. The return always to the body is of course deliberate, and in a way it refers to exactly that anxiety you refer to, around the frightening implications of bureaucracy without a "personal touch." To a degree I still feel conflicted about this: nomadic power is inevitably ahead of the game (I shudder to say game but that s the privilege of irony) to the extent that virus-writing is potentially the only targeted and efficacious political poetry now created. But the viable, more reac- tionary response is to insist on the bodily presence of the bureaucrat, the figure able to hold in each hand a piece of paper and physically to comprehend that these items are connected through him, topically and immediately. An entirely virtualized administrative function will skid across the perceptual field so glibly that its significance is practically inconceivable. Admittedly our political aspirations reside in more than the substance of paperclips and printouts, but a paranoia that within the ghastly logic of its own networks requires and implicates the body is at least not deceptive in that aspect of its revelations. (Let me just say quickly before moving on that I'm not sure I any longer appreciate a consequential distinction between "system" and "constraint," and my guess is that Kestons objection to the mechanical imagery I used in our conversation is roughly continuous with my own abhorrence of the virtual in the terms I describe above. In the context of art work, no open system is arbitrary, for the same reason that no information is zero, and vice versa. As I've already said, a flat disinterest no longer appeals to me - I think it only ever did, tempo- rarily, because of the antidepressants I was taking at that time: and the influence of psychoactive drugs on language management and competence is, as you know, one of the concerns or pressures that 136 CHICAGO REVIEW</page><page sequence="12">has shaped my current practice. But I guess that's for another time.) The protocols of intervention that continually inform the relation- ship between the meaning-producing body and wound-information, and the regulation through systematic means of the impulses arising, finally takes us to the dynamics of the sestina. (I tend to want to say dynamics rather than form here for reasons you'll quickly see.) It was the phrase "data churn," in my poem "Lapse" that made me start thinking about the sestina as a technology applicable to the interest I had in using constraint-based systems to achieve a fidelity to the cognitive and perceptual processes that other (what you might call noise-cancelling) poetries filter out or completely reform. Rather than continuing to work, as I mostly did for a while, with scraps of paper all over my desk and the floor and post-its all over the wall, all the fragments that I wanted to try and pull together in a piece (for example, I vividly remember "Virtual drive capacity" coming about that way), I wanted to find a way of automating the restless recombina- tion of information and ideas, but at a dynamic level. In other words, I dont think I would now, as I did with "Boomer," allow a computer application to create content, to dictate cuts, word order, etc.; but a self- regulating model for creating movement within the empty space of the not-yet-written poem seemed an attractive thought. I'd been trying to write a series of poems (called "Portias Crib"- a handful of them survive. . .) using empty crossword grids, but the walls close in quickly! And anyway I wanted something mobile. "Broken password with linen" was the first sestina poem. (If you disregard the interspersed quatrains, which are there mostly because of the fantasy- which the poem thankfully realizes- of re-enacting at the end the invention of the limerick, by smuggling a proportionately reduced interpolation into the envoi.) What rotates is not end- words but topics. I was reading a book on cryptography at the time, and si- multaneously pursuing a sudden enthusiasm for Cubism and particu- larly Braque, and wondering therefore about the decoding of stylized visual images, and the role of pattern recognition in biometrics: and the experiment of the poem was therefore taking cryptography and Cubism and four other apparently unrelated top-of-mind topics and seeing what ramifying connections were thrown up by this constant forcible rejuxtaposition, in a confined and impacted space. Ultimately of course the connection, and the orientation toward connection, is CHRIS GOODE &amp; SAM LADKIN I 137</page><page sequence="13">personal first, and interior to its own perceptual business, and that's no bad thing. The results may or may not convince - certainly, the last (to date) of the sestina poems, "Oval Prompt B: Love Theme from Melmoth the Twat," with the rotary permutation scaled up to eleven-line stanzas, is chaotically (if cheerily) unsuccessful, though at that stage I made things harder for myself by writing the whole thing quickly in one sitting and prohibiting later revision; but the churn effect continues to interest me. I'd like to see what happens if you speed it up. You'd get something like a drill-bit, right? This is how you end up writing yourself into a psychic replay of Tetsuo: The Iron Man. I don t mean "you," I mean "one." I haven't answered any of your questions, Sam. What did you say? 138 CHICAGO REVIEW</page></plain_text>
