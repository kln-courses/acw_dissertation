<plain_text><page sequence="1">T. S. ELIOT AND THE HOLLOW MEN HYATT HOWE WAGGONER The University of Kansas City THE YEAR I925, unremarkable enough in most respects, de- serves to be remembered for three events which together form a significant triad. In that year were published Theodore Dreiser's An American Trargedy, Alfred North Whitehead's Science and the Modern World, and T. S. Eliot's The Hollow Men. Here are three symbols of an end and a beginning: an end of the dominance of scientism and materialistic naturalism, and the beginning of the re- construction of a livable and believable world out of the fragments. The Jazz Age may be said to slope up to and down from this pivotal date in a more than merely chronological sense. An Amer- ican Tragedy marks the absolute dead-end in fictional naturalism: beyond it lay only neo-naturalism, assuming what Dreiser had preached and relying for novelty on exploitation of ever-increasing extremes of violent, abnormal, and bizarre subject-matter. Beyond An American Tragedy lay only The Sun Also Rises and Sanctuary and The Hamlet. Science and the Modern World, on the other hand, was at once a culmination and a beginning: the culmination of a long line of philosophical critiques of kinetic-atomic physics and the philosophy of science based on that physics; and the beginning in America of a series of rejections of scientism and materialistic naturalism by a constantly increasing and influential body of philosophers, scien- tists, and writers. Widely read and extremely influential, White- head's book spelled the destruction of the old order and laid the foundation for a new. Whereas Peirce had gone unread and James had been suspected of teaching that one should believe whatever proved most comfortable or most profitable, Whitehead was not ignored and could not be caricatured. Anyone who could follow the close logical reasoning and translate for himself the technical language of Science and the Modern World could scarcely miss the point: here was one of the great books of our century. For whether or not one agreed with or could even follow the constructive meta- physics in the book, if one were moderately perceptive one could</page><page sequence="2">I02 Aimerican Literature hardly fail to realize that the very foundations of the scientific phi- losophy which had remained orthodox since the Rennaissance had been shaken. Gertrude Stein, certainly well-read whatever one may think of her experiments in removing logic from language, imme- diately proclaimed Whitehead one of the three great geniuses of our century. And, significally, no one retorted that he was really a "vitalist," a romanticist, or an apologist for the faith. Great genius or not, here was certainly one of the several most influential minds in modern American philosophy laying bare the philosophic ab- surdity of the system of which An American Tragedy was the most ponderous fictional expression. Dreiser begot no imitators, founded no school; it was apparent to nearly everyone that his was a last word, not a first. Whitehead had been preceded by many who had said partially what he said completely, but he was nevertheless in a real sense a beginning, both as a symbol and as a positive influence. The other book of the three that make 1925 a noteworthy year was neither a final expression of the old scientific outlook nor an early expression of the reinterpretation of science, but a rejection of both. The Hollow Men is both a characterization and a repudiation. Modern secular man performs his idiotic dance, his head filled with straw, because he has rejected revelation for science, because he has ignored the other world in order to try to make the most of this. Though what Eliot had to say in The Hollow Men had been said before in The Waste Land, the symbolic significance of the book is not greatly diminished by that fact. For, published the same year as the other signs of an ending and a beginning, it represents an alternative to both: it accepts neither the old nor the new naturalism, but super- naturalism. Such a position was of course not new in English and Amer- ican literature, nor would it have been in any way significant but for two facts: Eliot was a highly sophisticated and an impressively intellectual man, and so could not easily be accused of being a sen- timental reactionary; and his poetry and criticism were so highly respected and so widely influential that he could not be dismissed as insignificant. Often called the most influential poet and critic of his generation, Eliot has thrown the weight of his influence both against the nihilistic "mechanomorphism"' of the until recently 'A term used by Max Eastman in The Literary Mind (New York, I93), p. 5 et pas-</page><page sequence="3">T.

Eliot and The Hollow Men I03 orthodox scientific outlook, and against attempts of Whitehead and others to refashion the scientific outlook better to fit some newly discovered and some previously overlooked facts. After The Hol- low Men, neo-neohumanist manifestoes, neo-Thomism, neo-Calvin- ism, and Pitirim A. Sorokin's shrieks of denunciation of almost everything that makes the modern world modern. "The chief clue to the understanding of most contemporary An- glo-Saxon literature," Eliot wrote in After Strange Gods, "is to be found in the decay of Protestantism."2 And what Eliot asserts to be true of most modern literature, that an appreciation of it to be significant must start with philosophical analysis, is especially true of his own works. A true evaluation of The Waste Land had to wait until very recently, when several critics3 finally clarified what the poet was really trying to say in that poem; perhaps a just and balanced criticism of the first thirty years of Eliot's poetry will be easier to attain if we cease (for this once at least) snapping portraits and focus the critical lens to bring out the background. What is Eliot's relation to scientism and materialistic natur- alism? And what is his solution of the dilemma of the modern temper, the two horns of which are an alien universe and dehu- manized man? It is hardly sufficient to answer these two questions by repeating "Anglo-Catholicism." What is his indebtedness to philosophers? Seeing Eliot in perspective may help to correct the distortions of both his admirers and his enemies. II For a poet the intent of whose verse is primarily philosophic-or moral and religious, as he would probably prefer to say-Eliot has very little to say in his prose about philosophers and philosophy. One might even be tempted to assume, if one did not know the facts of the poet's life, that Max Eastman was unqualifiedly right in calling Eliot's learning "narrowly literary."4 Of all the philosophers, sim, to describe the tendency (the opposite of anthropomorphism) to picture and to explain everything in the likeness of a machine. This mechanistic materialism springing from and subsisting on science is most amusingly illustrated by the Victorian physicist Tyndall, who declared that he could understand nothing (in physics) unless he could make a (me- chanical) model of it. 2After Strange Gods (New York, I934), p. 4I. 3 Especially Cleanth Brooks, in Modern Poetry and the Tradition (Chapel Hill, N.

H. Bradley is the subject of a laudatory essay, and Henri Bergson is given a prominent place in The Rock' and is praised, elsewhere, for his style. Despite Eliot's "intellectualism," his temper of mind is dogmatic rather than spec- ulative; and satisfaction in revealed truth early supplanted any free philosophic curiosity he may have had. But Bradley and Bergson are enough-if we add another, T. E. Hulme'-to enable us to see Eliot's position in relation to the philosophic currents of the twen- tieth century. For from Bradley to Bergson to Hulme to Eliot one proceeds by a series of relatively short and, except between Bergson and Hulme, easy steps. Though Eliot has never so honored them, Bradley, Bergson, and Hulme might almost be said to constitute a tradition. In the essay on Bradley in which in I926 he paid his only full- length tribute to a philosopher,7 Eliot praised chiefly Bradley's early Ethical Studies and his Principles of Logic, paying scant attention to the philosophy which Bradley expounded in the book for which he is remembered today, Appearance and Reality. It is not to be wondered at that Eliot was mainly interested in the purity and grace of Bradley's style, the urbanity and gentility of his personality, and the acuteness of his ethical perception; for by 1926 the Eliot who had once written a doctoral dissertation on Bradley's philos- ophy had discovered that that philosophy was heretical. And so, since he wanted to praise him, he made little mention of the chief things that Bradley had had to say. But Bradley's philosophy has an important bearing on Eliot's development nonetheless. Perhaps the most important thing for which Eliot did not praise Bradley was the latter's analysis of science as abstraction. No doubt to Eliot this contribution of Bradley's seemed, in the middle twen- ties, too obvious, too elementary, to deserve attention: Eliot had Inn? taken it for granted that the scientific method involved ab- 'The Rock (New York, I934), p. 22.

He defies classification, being something of a philosopher, something of a poet, and, according to the common opinion, not much of either. ""Francis Herbert Bradley," Selected Essays.

Eliot and The Hollow Men io0 straction of certain select items from the sum of reality. But his- torically Bradley's perception of the true nature of science was a real contribution, for it was not generally recognized in the early I890's that the system of nature constructed by physical science was "a necessary working fiction"8 only. According to Bradley's analysis, since recognized as valid by all important philosophers of science and now held by most scientists themselves, the very foundation of science is the process of rigid exclusion, of abstraction from a complex whole of the relatively simple facts to be studied.9 Thus traditional physics, for instance, differentiates primary from secondary qualities, locating the former outside and the latter inside our heads, thus simplifying nature by excluding from the area of experience it has chosen for its field all those complications which constitute the reality of experience- color, sound, taste, goodness and badness, the feeling of experience. The result is nature conceived of as matter in motion. Primary qualities-mass, spatial relations, and the change of those relations -are real; the rest is merely psychical. Such a concept of nature, said Bradley, may prove very convenient to the physicist or the chemist; but it remains merely a convenient fiction. No harm is done as long as it is recognized as such, but when the abstraction is taken for total reality and used to discredit the other elements of experience, it is time for the philosopher to protest. We must understand the nature of our abstractions and never forget that they are abstractions: It is doubtless scientific to disregard certain aspects when we work: but to urge that therefore such aspects are not fact, and that what we use without regard to them is an independent real thing,-this is barbarous metaphysics.10 Science, then, is practical knowledge, or, as Bertrand Russell was later to define it, power knowledge." But there is also philosophy, 8Appearance and Reality (New York, I893), p. 490.

The scientist chooses his facts; he selects from a range of possible laws; he picks out the hypotheses which best conform to his body of more generalized theories; and finally he comes to realize that there has been an element of choice in his general theory- systems determined by his ideals of explanation" (p. 37I).

And the only way we can reach total understanding is through total experience, in which thought is only a part. Thought is a tool to help us to attain self- consistency, but we can never be entirely consistent. After thought has done all it can, it remains for direct awareness, the immediacy of feeling, to give us as much as we shall ever know of the nature of reality. All that we find in immediate experience must be attributes of nature-feeling as well as extension, beauty as well as mass. The dead world of kinetic atomic physics is by no means the real world -though it is an element in, that is, an abstraction from, the total reality. So bare and bold a summary does not of course do justice to the complexity and subtlety of the metaphysics of this man who was possibly the most challenging philosopher of his day. Yet it will serve to indicate the relationship between Bradley and Bergson. The central doctrines of Bergson's system are too well known to require full exposition; but since the popular understanding of vi- talism verges on caricature, it may be well to define certain of Bergson's principles that emphasize his relation to Eliot. Starting with the data of consciousness rather than with the philosophic as- sumptions customary since the Renaissance, Bergson finds the fun- damental fact of experience to be what we may, metaphorically, call its flowing quality. Change, not fixity, is the primary datum of consciousness. And change, as we experience it, is creative: liv- ing is a continuous and irreversible process in which each moment of experience is the result of the whole past and in its turn crea- tively shapes the future.'2 If consciousness is thus accurately describable as an irreversible "flow" rather than as a congeries of isolated "sensations" which the intellect groups, distinguishes, and classifies into knowledge, then the avenue to true understanding, Bergson argues, is "intel- lectual sympathy," or intuition. For the intellect in its customary logical procedures breaks up the flow into hypothetical "particles" and proceeds to deal with these discrete "facts" symbolically, in terms of their likeness to the already known. "To analyze, there- fore, is to express a thing as a function of something other than it- self."'3 Intuition, on the other hand, by a simple and ultimately 12An Introduction to Metaphysics, trans. T. E. Hulme (New York, I9I2), passim. '3 Ibid., p. 7.</page><page sequence="7">T. S. Eliot and The Hollow Men 107 inexpressible process of identification with the "thing known," leads to absolute knowledge by allowing the knower to coincide with what is unique in the object-and all objects of experience are unique, all moments of consciousness are unique, never completely like any other. The data of consciousness lend themselves to "in- exhaustible enumeration," to shuffling, classification, analysis; but the essence of consciousness (and so of any reality we can ever know) can be grasped only by "indivisible apprehension."'14 The logical intellect breaks up "time" and "space" (themselves abstrac- tions) into discrete points and instants; but the primary datum of consciousness is felt duration. The product of the logical intellect is relative (though useful) knowledge, that of intuition is absolute. If the inner life includes at once "variety of qualities, continuity of progress, and unity of direction,"15 it cannot fully be represented by images. Still less, however, can it be represented by concepts; for the concept "generalizes at the same time as it abstracts."16 It goes round and round its object, seeking points of comparison with other objects, pointing out similarities, distinguishing differences. "In this way, as many different systems will spring up as there are external points of view from which reality can be examined, or larger circles in which it can be enclosed."17 The systems may all be relatively true, or some may be more self-consistent, useful, and inclusive than others; but they remain what they started out to be, relative knowledge. The mystic who loses himself in contempla- tion of God, the poet who loses himself in contemplation of an object, may not be able to tell us adequately what they saw, but in the process they come closer to absolute knowledge than the scien- tist, the statistician, the logician ever can. So much in brief outline, for Bergson's epistemology. On the basis of this theory of knowledge he proceeded to construct a dual- istic system which distinguished two opposite tendencies in the world, the creative activity of life and the static inertia of the inani- mate, amounting to an "upward" and a "downward" tendency. Neither the individual living creature nor the whole course of or- ganic evolution can be explained as the passive product or the ac- cidental by-product of the random action of matter in motion.18 14 Loc.

Arthur Mitchell (New York, I9II), passim.</page><page sequence="8">Io8 American Literature The mechanistic materialism that was Charles Darwin's contribu- tion to the progress of evolutionary thought19 is as inadequate to explain the upward surge of life, Bergson points out (as Samuel Butler had before him), as mechanistic psychology is totally to ex- plain the sane and mature individual. Against the downward ten- dency of matter-what the physicists call the second law of ther- modynamics, which implies that just as certain elements are breaking up and our sun is dispersing its heat, so the entire physical universe is "running down"-against this downward tendency of matter the vital impulse of life pushes ahead, using the logical intellect as a tool for survival, and always combating the inertia, the limita- tions, the determinateness of matter.20 When we turn from Bergson to T. E. Hulme, we are conscious of descending from brilliance to mere excitement. Hulme was ex- cited by Bergson's philosophy, and he had the power himself of ex- citing others;21 but his excitement seems, at least to one who must judge him by the written word rather than by personal contact, to have been only imperfectly directed into intellectual channels. Hulme's connection with Bergson was one of acknowledged in- debtedness. In I9I3 he translated Bergson's Introduction to Meta- physics, and had he not been killed during the early years of the first World War he might have carried out his plan of writing a general introduction to the master's philosophy. Yet the changes in emphasis and interpretation which Hulme made in Bergson's doctrine were very significant. The dualism which Bergson had observed to exist between mat- ter and life, Hulme expanded into pluralism: there are, he asserted, three separate realms of reality, or, better, three distinct realities, the inorganic world, the organic world, and the world of ethical and religious values. Of these three realities he frequently repeated, "There must be an absolute division between each of the three re- gions, a kind of chasm. There must be no continuity, no bridge leading from one to the other."22 19 See the excellent analysis of Darwin and "Darwinism" in Jaques Barzun, Dar-win, Marx, Wagner (New York, I941). 20 Creative Evolution, chap. ii. 21That Hulme was the originator of the Imagist platform is generally conceded; that he was also, if one may judge from comments of his friends, something of an intellectual leader in his little group of literary radicals, is not so well known. 22 Speculations, ed. Herbert Read (New York, I924), p. 6. For a discussion of the parallels between scientific thought on discontinuity and Hulme's doctrines, see J. G. Crowther, The Social Relations of Science (New York, I94I), pp. 593-599.</page><page sequence="9">T. S. Eliot and The Hollow Men IO9 There was a motive behind this modification of Bergson's phi- losophy. Bergson held that both the biological and the physical sciences were pertinent to a study of man's mental and even his "spiritual" life: Darwin's notion of evolution by accidental varia- tion and adaptation, for example, helped to explain the sinuosities of evolution, though not its direction; and biological considerations were paramount in the development of that tool for survival, the logical intellect, and so influenced one aspect at least of man's spir- itual life. But Hulme would have none of this vitalism that al- lowed science to encroach upon the domain of the spirit. Not only were there unbridgeable chasms between the three realms of reality, but in two of them absolute knowledge was possible: both physics and religion give absolute knowledge.23 Thus religious dogmas are secured from danger of criticism by a conflict with science. The motive of Hulme's changes in Bergsonism is clear enough.24 It appears, then, that Hulme's final philosophy was very far indeed from carrying on that of Bergson. The differences are fun- damental. The real debt which Hulme owed to Bergson was not to the nature of the latter's metaphysics but to the fact of his having "disproved" materialism. For Hulme, Bergson was a steppingstone to absolutism. Further perusal of Speculations substantiates this conclusion. Taught by Bergson's critique of the habits of the logical intellect to distrust logical reason, Hulme planned to write a "critique of satis- faction" which would demonstrate, among other things, that philos- ophy since the Renaissance (why only since the Renaissance he does not explain) has really been little more than wishful thinking.25 The answer to the inevitable question as to where, then, man could turn for thinking not tainted with his desires Hulme had ready: in the realm of the inanimate, to physical science; in the realm of ethical and religious considerations, to dogmatic theology. A rec- ognition of this fact would, Hulme felt, dispose forever of "these bastard phenomena": "Romanticism in literature, Relativism in ethics, Idealism in philosophy, and Modernism in religion."26 When, having disposed of relativism in ethics, Hulme turned his hand to stating his own ethical views, the chief virtue which 23 Loc. cit. 24 See "Humanism and the Religious Attitude," Speculations, passim. 22Loc. cit. 26 Ibid., p. IO.</page><page sequence="10">110 American Literature he felt called upon to espouse was violence.27 Not content merely to translate Sorel's Reflections on Violence (which influenced Mus- solini in his formation of the doctrine of fascism), he adopted militarism as a personal credo and acted upon his belief by en- thusiastically joining in the carnage of the war. And in another respect too he was a Fascist before Mussolini and a Nazi before Hit- ler: being convinced, on what grounds other than literary taste he did not explain, of the absurdity of the "romantic" reverence for the sacredness of the individual personality, believing that "ethical values are not relative to human desires and feelings,"28 and having discovered, further, that the theological doctrine of Original Sin contained the key to all life's mysteries, it was natural that he should conclude that, "as man is essentially bad, he can only accomplish anything of value by discipline-ethical and political."29 Ezra Pound was not the only one among the little group of disaffected intel- lectuals in London just before the war who was a potential Fascist. If we seem to be far away from Bergson by this time, it is not surprising, for despite Hulme's frequent homage to Bergson, the link between them lies almost solely in the fact that Hulme found Bergson's attack on philosophies of scientific materialism and on the pretensions of the logical intellect to be of service in his violent reaction from nearly all that Western culture had stood for in the past two hundred years. Hulme found it easy to move from dual- ism to pluralism, from vitalism to supernaturalism, from the elcan vital to violence. Of one other teacher Eliot has said more in his prose to indicate indebtedness than of Bradley, Bergson, or Hulme: he has acknowl- edged that he began as a disciple of Irving Babbitt.30 That he quickly moved beyond the type of humanism that Babbitt repre- sented is almost certainly owing in part to his contact with Hulme, who influenced so many people more gifted than himself. It was only a few years after the beginning of his voluntary exile that 27 Ibid., p. x. 28 Ibid., p. 47. The Italics are Hulme's. 29 Loc cit. As J. G. Crowther has said (The Social Relations of Science), "Hulme's views contained the essence of the principles of Fascism" (p. 598). Crowther goes on to speculate: "Would he have succeeded [if he had lived] in combining science with an anti- humanist ideology, or would he have abandoned anti-humanist ideology, or would he have abandoned science and become a Fascist? He was perhaps the most penetrating con- tributor to the philosophy to which that part of Fascism which is not mere gangsterism appeals" (p. 598). 3 "Second Thoughts About Humanism," Selected Essays, p. 393.</page><page sequence="11">T. S. Eliot and The Hollow Men III Eliot agreed with Hulme's dictum, "It is necessary to realize that there is an absolute, and not a relative, difference between hu- manism . . . and the religious spirit."'31 Nevertheless, despite Eliot's strictures against humanism, the fundamental similarity between the outlooks of Babbitt and Eliot did not cease with the latter's perception of the necessity of re- ligious dogmas, as the poet himself has acknowledged by saying that Babbitt was "fundamentally on most questions in the right."32 Both men were reacting violently from all that "the generation of materialism"33 had stood for. Though the many critics who see in Babbitt's position a cult of refinement rather than a healthy protest against materialism may be partly justified in their view, neverthe- less one cannot ignore the central fact that looms above all Babbitt's loose talk about the "inner check," above all his aristocratic procliv- ities and lack of sound critical sense: basically his position, however it may have been modified by personal and temperamental bias, was a protest against the moral nihilism of materialistic natur- alism.34 To that extent he and Eliot stand together with E. A. Rob- inson and Robert Frost. Babbitt and Eliot start from the same posi- tion, but one ends by relying on a gentlemanly "inner check," while the other ends by relying on an orthodox Christian God. The influences, then, that have contributed to the shaping of Eliot's two poetic themes-a satirical portrayal of the waste land of the hollow men and a pious call for a return to the faith of the fathers-have been many; but they have all pointed in the same di- rection, all indicated the same diagnosis of our ills. Bradley's rein- statement of value in the world of nature; Bergson's destruction of the superstition that only science, dealing exclusively in quantity and number, could tell us anything of reality; Hulme's diagnosis of the incompleteness of humanism, a diagnosis which Eliot has quoted with approval and accepted as his own; Babbitt's genteel protestations against naturalism-all these must be taken into ac- count in any attempt to evaluate Eliot's poetry in the perspective of the background from which it springs. 31 Speculations, p. 8. 32 Selected Essays, p. 365. 33See Carlton J. H. Hayes, A Generation of Materialism (New York, 1941). 34 One may recognize this fact without losing sight of its twin, that Babbitt's writ- ings do not so much enunciate a philosophy as reveal a personality. The recently col- lected tributes to Babbitt, despite the enthusiasm for the subject that informs most of them, offer evidence for this conclusion. See Frederick Manchester and Odell Shepard (eds.), Jrving Babbitt: Man and Teacher (New York, I94I),</page><page sequence="12">II2 American Literature III It is strictly within the tradition which he carries on that Eliot should condemn scientism and even, upon occasion, science.35 His indictment takes three forms: first, our faith in facts, our belief that "rational knowledge of causes" will solve all our problems and bring the millennium, is a mean and pitiable delusion; second, our abundance of knowledge has decreased the mystery and banished the splendor of life; and third, scientific philosophies are unbal- anced and false, themselves the causes of delusion and wretched- ness. Most fundamental and most often repeated of Eliot's charges against our scientific age is that of moral blindness. As E. A. Rob- inson charged that we have become Children of the Night because we have put our faith in "factual knowledge of efficient causes" and ceased striving toward the Light, toward self-knowledge and wis- dom and awareness of good and evil,36 so Eliot denounces the age that prizes knowledge above wisdom. The two poets make the same charge, only using different symbols to convey their meaning. As Robinson made his characters turn to scientific books in their search for the meaning of life, only to have all meaning elude them; as Frost wonders whether psychology has revealed anything essen- tially new and whether astronomical figures really alter the prob- lem of how to achieve the good life; so Eliot cries, "All our knowl- edge brings us nearer to our ignorance.... Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge ?"37 This deploring of knowledge without wisdom will, of course, be called by some obscurantism. But it is obscurantist in direction only if one is convinced, as many apparently are, that moral choices are illusory or that neutral scientific knowledge is always used for good, or will, in the long run, always be used for good, which amounts to the same thing-an assumption so patently ridiculous in the modern world that one can impute it to no one without imply- ing an insult to his intelligence. The rest, who make neither of these assumptions, can see some point in Eliot's lines, 15It is perhaps needless to point out that Eliot's style has changed in the direction of clarity and directness of statement with the years. For that reason most of the quotations and citations below are from the poems of the last fifteen years or so. 3e See Louise Dauner, "Avon and Cavender: Two Children of the Night," American Literature, XIV, 55-65 (March, I942).

But the circle of our understanding is a very restricted area.

And he de- plores the "excessive amiability" with which the bishops have greet- ed the scientific books that have religious tendencies, wishing that the prelates had not "bestowed this benediction on our latest popular ramp of best-sellers":4 I do not disagree with the literal sense of the pronouncement which I have just quoted rto the effect that famous scientists were now estab- 38Ibid., p. 129. 39Ibid., p. 192. 40The Family Reunion (New York, 1939), pp. 127-128. 41Thoughits After Lambeth (London, 1931), pp. 6-7.

I feel that the scientists should be received as penitents for the sins of an earlier scientific gene- ration, rather than acclaimed as new friends and allies . . . it ought to be made quite clear that these writers cannot confirm anyone in the faith.46 T. S. Eliot the critic and essayist has always been more irritating to many than T. S. Eliot the poet; and in Thoughts After Lambeth and elsewhere in his prose he has expressed sentiments that for ob- scurantism and intellectual pride (a sin he has not yet freed himself of, despite his apparently sincere efforts in that direction) are scarcely to be equaled in the whole body of modern literature. The chief point of Thoughts After Lambeth is that the high officials of the Church are too liberal, too ready to take the data of science seriously,47 too open-minded, too apt to surrender "the citadel" of the Church's authority over the individual; the pamphlet is far more narrowly sectarian than the officially sectarian report of the bishops. Nevertheless, fortunately for his enduring fame as a poet,48 in his verse Eliot has aimed his charges not primarily at science itself but against a civilization that, as a whole, has thought to find in facts a substitute for knowledge of good and evil. When he asks "What is happening . . ./Beyond the Heaviside Layer?"49 Eliot is not calling for more astronomical data to cure the ills of the world. Closer to what may with justice be called obscurantism in the poetry is the charge, occasionally expressed and, in the early poems, frequently implied, that because of the profusion of our scientific knowledge "The bright color fades/Together with the unrecap- turable emotion,/The glow upon the world."50 We are reminded of Poe's youthful "Sonnet to Science" when we read that in our age the mystery is gone, "UPp. 13-14. Italics are mine. 47Cf. his statement, in The Use of Poetry (London, 1933, p. 133), that "The effect of popular astronomy books (like Sir James Jeans's) upon me is only of the insignificance of vast space." (Italics are mine.) The tone of this and other statements in "The Modern Mind" (The Use of Poetry, pp. 121-142) is somewhat different from Frost's feeling that astronomical revelations of the vastness of space do not alter the problem of achieving the good life. 48 It is to be hoped that Yvor Winters has dispelled for all time the illusion that Eliot is a great critical thinker. See Winters's analysis of the confusions in Eliot's critical thought in "T. S. Eliot: The Illusion of Reaction," Kenyon Review, III, 7-30 and 221-239 (Winter, 194I, and Spring, 1941). 4 The Family Reunion, p. 128. Ibid., p. 54.</page><page sequence="15">T. S. Eliot and The Hollow Men 115 And the eye adjusts itself to a twilight Where the dead stone is seen to be batrachian, The aphyllous branch ophidian.51 There can be little doubt that to a degree at least the theme in the early poems of the inferiority of the present to the past derives from this nostalgia for the golden day when mystery still survived. Allied to it is the poet's remark that when applied science has reached into every corner, we shall all die of boredom.52 It is dif- ficult to repress a smile at this touch of romantic longing for the simple life in one who has had so many unkind things to say about romanticism. If the earlier and probably still most commonly held interpreta- tion of The Waste Land were true-that the poem expresses rather than merely depicts futility53-then Eliot's third charge would seem to run counter to the point of view expressed in all the early poems, and we should indeed have evidence of an about-face at the end of the twenties. As a matter of fact, however, when the poet wrote, in The Rock, "O wretched generation of enlightened men,/Betrayed in the mazes of your ingenuities,"54 he was merely adopting a new way of saying what he had said earlier. Cleanth Brooks has interpreted the obscure reference in The Waste Land to the dog55 as meaning either scientific humanitarianism or scientific naturalism; but whether it refers to either one or neither or both is not a crucial point for an understanding of Eliot's criti- cism of philosophies based on science. For even if we leave out of account the vague references and esoteric symbolism of the poems written before The Hollow Men, it is perfectly possible to analyze Eliot's attitude toward scientific philosophies. When he wrote in "Animula" that the modern soul is "shadow of its own shadows, spectre in its own gloom,"56 Eliot meant some- thing more than simply that modern secular man has given up God. Behind the imagery lay some definite notions about the shad- ows and the gloom that modern man has created and now in- "' Loc. cit. 52 Selected Essays, p. 372.

The substance of Eliot's "We have suffered far more than a personal loss- /We have lost our way in the dark"57 is precisely that of Archibald MacLeish's numerous prose analyses of the modern temper, just as it repeats the idea that was the central theme of Robinson's poetry for forty years. We are spectres in our own gloom, not simply because we have given up supernaturalism for naturalism, but because naturalism as Eliot interprets it-that is, mechanistic, materialistic naturalism- makes life meaningless. In our eagerness to be modern and realis- tic, in our hard-boiled determination to believe only in the "publicly observable," we end by denying the significance, or even the real- ity, of value, life, and even the mind that constructed the denial. We end by denying our own experience. Hence the point of Eliot's "A purely 'scientific' philosophy ends by denying what we know to be true."58 Hence also his reference to behaviorism as an "un- balanced" philosophy.59 Because our age is characterized by such "philosophies" as Watsonian behaviorism, the ultimate and, ap- propriately, ridiculous extreme in materialistic naturalism, we are reduced to shadows in our own shadow world. We have preferred knowledge to wisdom, and our knowledge has played us false; for "However you disguise it, this thing does not change :/The perpetual struggle of Good and Evil."60 But Eliot's is not a solitary voice when he tells us this. Even Bertrand Russell, whom Eliot delights to use as the Horrible Example of our scientific sickness, reminded us more than ten years ago that If . . . a scientific civilization is to be a good civilization it is necessary that increase in knowledge should be accompanied by increase in wis- dom. I mean by wisdom a right conception of the ends of life. This is something which science in itself does not provide.6' IV But our scientism, our worship of the factual knowledge sup- plied by science and gathered in the pages of the Encyclopedia Britannica, is not the only reason we are hollow men. We are hol- low men, futile men, made more futile by the knowledge of our own futility, because the behaviorist's conception of man and the physicist's conception of the world, both of which we accept, leave 57The Family Reunion, p. i28.

Eliot and The Hollow Men II7 no room for any other than hollow men. Modern secular man is seen to be hollow not simply from the vantage-point of the re- ligious-philosophic view of life but from the standpoint of modern man's own description of himself and his world. That Eliot's early "waste land" poems do not simply express a refined repugnance for the crudities and vulgarities of modern life (though they certainly express that among other things), that they are not simply an idealization of past glories, can be shown easily enough. But it is common, almost customary, for critics to assume that the famous Thames passages in The Waste Land express di- rectly and without complications all there is behind Eliot's charac- terization of the modern world as a waste land. But the rubbish on the surface and the rats and bottles along the banks of the Thames are not simple and direct symbols of machine-age squalor alone, nor are they intended to suggest that Eliot believes that Renaissance London was without its equivalents of old newspapers and broken beer bottles. The emphasis on the wretched litter is no doubt in part a reflection of the poet's distaste for the by-products of the machine age, and, more particularly, for the democratization (read vulgarization) of modern society; but it is also a reflection of the state of mind of modern dehumanized man. What Mr. Krutch has called "the disillusion with the labora- tory" has neither proceeded simply from nor been confined to the laboratory. It has proceeded from nearly every branch of all the sciences dealing with life, and it has permeated every crack and crevice of our age. Though few, perhaps, perceive it, the primary influence of most modern psychologies may some day be seen to have been antirational.62 Not only have the psychologists explored the irrational compulsions of the subconscious and the reflexes, conditioned or otherwise, but they have implied, and sometimes posited as a "scientific fact," that rationality counts for little if any- thing, that it is chiefly an allusion. Even the philosopher Sidney Hook, positivist and instrumentalist in the tradition of John Dewey, unfriendly to most of what Eliot stands for, has said that "pop- ular behaviorism" and "popular psychoanalysis" render questions "2See, e.g., P. A. Sorokin, Social and Cultural Dynamics (New York, i937); Sidney Hook, "Storm Signals in American Philosophy," Virginia Quarterly Review, XIV, 29-43 (Winter, 1938); and M. J. Adler, "This Pre-War Generation," Harpers, CLXXXV, 524- 534 (Oct., 1940).</page><page sequence="18">ii8 American Literature of value meaningless ;63 translated from philosophical jargon, this simply means that both sciences have, through the pseudo-philo- sophic pronouncements of their practitioners or through the plain implications of their "facts," denied both that man is in any sense a rational creature and that he can, by taking thought and bringing into harmony his conflicting desires and needs, choose, reject, and in some measure shape his own destiny. Man, according to a strict interpretation of these sciences, is nothing but a puppet of "dark, unfeeling, and unloving powers" centered in the subconscious; or he is nothing but a bundle of reflex mechanisms; or he is nothing but a physicochemical machine. Of this picture of a derationalized, dehumanized man Eliot has made much use as an aid in the crea- tion of atmosphere in his depiction of the secular waste land. When Prufrock thinks that he "should have been a pair of ragged claws/Scuttling across the floors of silent seas,"64 not only is the reader's appreciation of Prufrock's irresolution heightened through this ironic contrast with instinctive, prevertebrate "cour- age," but his attitude toward Prufrock is influenced in another way: the crustacean is "natural," Prufrock human and unnatural. Mr. Krutch's lucubrations on the opposition between the natural and the human are here illustrated in a single line. So also in the de- scription of Bleistein. "Burbank with a Baedeker: Bleistein with a Cigar" may, as has been remarked, illustrate the poet's anti-Semi- tism,65 but the reference to the fact that Bleistein is "Chicago Semite Viennese" is not the only device used to increase his repulsiveness: his eyes are not only "lustreless" and "protrusive" but they stare "from the protozoic slime." The evolutionary movement is re- versed in the description of Bleistein to make him more repellent. And it is not only in describing the neurotic Prufrocks and the crass Bleisteins that Eliot makes use of the dehumanized picture of man supplied him by science. In his descriptions of nearly all the lost souls who inhabit the waste land it is implied that evolutionary development has added nothing new, created nothing; that the human personality is reducible to the mechanisms by which it operates; or that the "soul" can be discovered, by analysis, to con- sist of nothing but sordid Freudian desires or nervous impulses.

I can clean my skin, Purify my life, void my mind, But always the filthiness, that lies a little deeper ....66 And in "Preludes" we note the same point of view expressed in a poem written some twenty years before, in the lines, You dozed, and watched the night revealing The thousand sordid images Of which your soul was constituted.67 Or again the same general effect is achieved by a pictorial simile: t. . . as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen."68 Frequently the sordidness or futility of all natural human life is suggested by a reference to man's natural origin: "The silent verte- brate in brown ... withdraws . . . [while] Rachel . . . tears at the grapes with murderous paws.69 Finally, to choose one last il- lustration out of many possible ones, the chorus in Murder in the Cathedral indicates its wise disillusion with natural life by evoking many images, some sordid, some primitive, some suggestive only in their context; but among them is the line, "I have lain on the floor of the sea and breathed with the breathing of the sea-anemone, swallowed with ingurgitation of the sponge .... "70 This is emo- tionally and poetically effective, but a philosopher might tell us that it is a poetic use of the genetic fallacy. It is, however, not simply when Eliot employs the genetic fallacy in its various forms to describe his characters, or when he ironically mimics the jargon of psychology ("The natural wakeful life of our Ego is a perceiving")7' that he draws upon science to de- scribe life in the waste land. Our life, it is true, is made barren by our consciousness of our origins, or, in the unreflecting, by the fact that the origins have never been transcended; but our impotence is made the more complete by our recognition that, on the natural level at least, the universe is alien to our values.

On the natural level, ni- hilism is the only conclusion Eliot can reach. Hence those of his characters who represent natural man are futile, helpless, hopeless creatures measuring out their lives with coffee spoons.80 Though his Prufrocks see their heads grow slightly bald, they know that it does not matter. that nothing at all matters in the least.8" They 72 Murder In the Cathedral, p. 64. 73 Collected Poems, p. 13. 74Ibid., p. 46.

They know that they live "in rats' alley/Where the dead men lost their bones."85 And so, with neither hope nor courage, they go aimlessly, hope- lessly, through the motions of living, In and out, in an endless drift Of shrieking forms in a circular desert Weaving with contagion of putrescent embraces On dissolving bone.86 In "a world confused and dark and disturbed by portents of fear,"87 they have "nothing to do but watch the days draw out"88 as they move through "the dream crossed twilight between birth and dying."89 "The Waste Land" achieves what Eliot has attributed to Aldous Huxley: it elucidates "how sordid a world without any [read correct] philosophy can be."90 That most of Eliot's characters, nearly all of them in the early poems and all who live on the purely natural level in the poems of the last fifteen years, are hollow men in a waste land would not, of course, need to be emphasized after all the hundreds of pages of criticism that have been devoted to an exposition of the fact- would, indeed, scarcely need to be mentioned, were it not that two important facts have been usually ignored or underemphasized in most of the criticism devoted to the poet: read in toto, the poems make it perfectly clear, first, that the nihilism in Eliot's poems is postulated on the revelations of science, not primarily on aristocratic repugnance for the vulgarities of the machine age; and, second, that the a priori conclusion that life would be meaningless in a world completely describable in terms of the data of science is substanti- ated, the poet says, by the facts of modern life because we have chosen to live as though mechanistic, materialistic naturalism were the whole truth. 82 Ibid., p. 45. 83 Ibid., p. 70. 84lbid., p.

Because we have deified science, we are unable to find God. Our philosophy has been put to the pragmatic test and has been found pragmatically true. And what modern asks for more than pragmatic truth? v "We do not know very much of the future," Thomas says in Murder in the Cathedral, "Except that from generation to gener- ation/The same things happen again and again."92 How many poets, philosophers, and saints in how many previous generations have abandoned Reason and despaired of the World because both Reason and the World have been so little in consonance with their deepest needs, have answered so unsatisfactorily their most urgent questions and given so little promise of realization to their best hopes? Eliot has, found in the Anglo-Catholic church satisfactory answers and reassuring promises. What neither Reason nor the World could give, Faith has given. Life in the Unreal City has taken on meaning for the poet who, as air raid warden, directs traffic during blackouts. Taught by his philosophical studies, especially by Bradley, Berg- son, and Hulme, that science does not tell the whole truth; per- fectly able to see, as so many of his less intelligent and sensitive con- temporaries have not seen, that the currently orthodox scientific picture of man, if accepted as exclusively true, would both prove and render life meaningless; and convinced that the tragic plight of the modern world is due to our having "left GOD not for other ' Pp. 28-29. 92 24.</page><page sequence="23">T.

Dialectic"93-holding scientism false, materialistic naturalism unendurable, and modern secularism the tragic result of the joint domination of these two, Eliot has intensified the di- chotomy between naturalism and supernaturalism which it was the chief effort of the late nineteenth century to break down. In "Second Thoughts about Humanism" Eliot's chief criticism of the sort of humanism of which he takes Norman Foerster as representative is that humanism of this variety, failing to take ac- count of the special authority of the supernatural, tries at once to derive comfort from religion (without believing in religious dogmas) and authority from science (without being willing to go the whole way with the scientists and erect a thoroughly naturalistic ethics): I can understand, though I do not approve, the naturalistic systems of morals founded upon biology and analytical psychology (what is valid in these consists largely of things that were always known); but I cannot understand a system of morals which seems to be founded on nothing but itself-which exists, I suspect, only by illicit relations with either psychology or religion or both, according to the bias of mind of the individual humanist.94 The choice before modern man, then, is between naturalism and supernaturalism. There is no satisfactory middle ground. (At times Eliot seems to say that the choice is between High Church Anglicanism, which may lead to Salvation, and infidelity, which can lead only to Damnation;` but perhaps we may safely ignore this stricter dilemma as the product of temporary triumphs of pious zeal over tolerance-which, by the way, Eliot believes a greatly overrated virtue, if indeed a virtue at all.)96 Humanism, that is, is unsatisfactory unless it is strictly subordinate to revealed religion: Man is man because he can recognize supernatural realities, not be- cause he can invent them. Either everything in man can be traced as a development from below, or something must come from above. There is no avoiding that dilemma: you must be either a naturalist or a super- ntrgit97 98 Collected Poems, p. 200. 9 Selected Essays, pp. 396-397.

It may well be, for instance, that if Watsonian behaviorism, the tag-end of materialistic mechanism that as basic assumptions took over from physics a set of dogmas which leading physicists had long since discarded, had shot its bolt and declined in popularity in the I890's instead of in the 1920's and I930's, the poet might not have become so thoroughly convinced of the impossibility of reconciling empiricism with a belief in the meaningfulness of life. He might not. But the philosophic tradi- tion to which he early attached himself certainly made the growth of such a conviction easy. He did not find in Bradley any ground for such a belief, but in Bergson's dualism between matter and life he found much that could be read as demanding, in one who would carry the thinking through to the end, a recognition of an absolute dichotomy between the subject-matter of the physical sciences and that of ethics. The vital impulses, Bergson said, "use" physics and chemistry. Matter is a downward tendency, life an upward. The scientific, analytical intellect falsifies, while intuition (faith?) admits us to a knowledge of reality. Clock-measured time, the time of Reason and the World, conveys but a poor notion of the reality which is duration.9 This dualism running through all of Bergson's philosophy Hulme sharpened and emphasized, even introducing, as an original contribution, a species of pluralism-a process of modification that left religion and morals securely isolated in a region of their own, an area where they possessed absolute authority and might not be challenged by science or empiricism. They were left inviolable and 98 "Storm Signals in American Philosophy," op. cit., p. 43. 9 Eliot has embodied Bergson's analysis of the nature of time in much of his poetry.

Eliot and The Hollow Men 125 absolutely free from any danger to their dogmas that might develop from an interchange of ideas with science. Finally, of course, his early master, Babbitt, stressed the dualism of nature and man, of man's natural self and the "inner check," as much as the pupil was ever to emphasize the dualism of the natural and the supernatural. All roads led Eliot toward Rome, though he was content to stop when he got to Canterbury." VI Eliot's rejection of St. Louis and America for England has value as a symbol: it can serve to remind us of his allied rejection of the American philosophic tradition of transcendental idealism. If Emerson can be said to have himself answered his own call for an American scholar, then it seems clear that the main current of American philosophy has consistently attempted to redeem the natural. Emerson, Whitman, Peirce, James, Royce, Dewey-all, recognizing the apparent contradictions between natural law and human will, between matter and mind, between facts and values, have nevertheless sought to narrow the gaps between these imme- morial anthitheses.'0' All humanists in the most catholic meaning of that ambiguous word, they have sought to link time and eternity together in man's life here and now without having recourse to miracles. The whole body of Eliot's poetry is a reaction from this pattern of thought. But while it expresses a violent reaction, it is not neces- sarily reactionary. It is perhaps too often forgotten that any action is always partially a reaction. As in the case of Robert Frost, a sym- pathetic commentary would interpret Eliot's philosophic progress not as a flight but as a seeking. As he himself has said, "In a world of fugitives/The person taking the opposite direction/Will appear to run away."'02 That fact that the poet anticipated a movement in thought that includes such respected names as those of Aldous Huxley, Reinhold Niebuhr, and Jacques Maritain, the fact that he "reacted" before the reaction took on the proportions of a respectable vanguard move- 100 Eliot has recently (in The Idea of a Christian Society, p. vi) acknowledged his in- debtedness to the Catholic humanism of Jacques Maritain. See also the references to Maritain in The Use of Poetry, pp. I21-156.

But a recognition of the fact should serve to remind critics of the inadvisability of suggesting that his conversion is evidence of premature senility. Like the neo-Thomists, he has found much truth in medieval theology and philosophy which has been ignored or derided since the Renaissance. Like Aldous Huxley, he finds the only hope for humanity to lie in transcending the human. Ex- cept in his strictly sectarian utterances, his thought has been and is closely allied with much of the most challenging thought of our time. But we must not overemphasize the aspect of his thought that may justly be called a reaction. With Bergson (and Emerson) he has sought "at the still point of the turning world . . ./Where past and future are gathered"'03 for the consciousness which is not in time, for what Bergson called intuition of duration. With Robin- son he has sought the Light that would illumine the darkness of this life; and though the light which he has found is somewhat different from Robinson's, the two agree that Time past and time future Allow but a little consciousness. To be conscious is not to be in time.'04 With Emerson and Bergson he has asked, in Bergsonian language, "When will time flow away?'105 And he has echoed the answers of Emerson, Thoreau, Whitman, and Bergson in his answer: Time past and time future . . . Point to one end, which is always present.106 With his unfailing awareness of spiritual values offsetting his inability to understand people through empathy, pruning the af- fectations and obscurities from his style as his faith has grown in certainty and consequently as his desire to be understood has in- creased, Eliot has pictured a generation and an era. Though the hollow men who people most of his poems are the product of a hostile observer, they are not distorted beyond recognition, for the intellectuals of the twenties saw in them a portrait of themselves. Not that he founded a school but that he reminded a generation of the meaning of its own culture-that is Eliot's poetic distinction. 106 Collected Poems, p. 2I5. 104 Ibid, p. 2I6. 105 Ibid., p. i 67. lo Ibid., p. 214.</page></plain_text>
