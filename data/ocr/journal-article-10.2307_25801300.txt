Norman Published online: 27 October 2010 ? Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010 Abstract This paper examines the socio-political processes surrounding spectacular reli gious parades and more private acts of veneration and supplication within the Hueda King dom (c. 1650-1727 AD) in the Republic of Benin, West Africa. The first goal of this paper is to posit the role that such public and private ceremonies played in framing negotiations of political and moral authority. It argues that ceremonial hosts and assembled audience members worked to channel toward their own interests the social, political, and economic outpouring that resulted from ritually sanctioned performances of wealth. The second goal of the paper is to illustrate material and spatial dimensions of such ceremonial spaces. These themes, drawn from a historically well-known polity, work together to aid in comparative theory building on feasting and the politics of spectacle in the deeper archaeological past. Keywords Hueda (Whydah) Kingdom Feasting Parading African Atlantic Introduction The Kings of Fida [Hueda] were formerly accustomed to Annual Pilgrimages to the Snake-House, which was Celebrated with great Magnificence, and concluded with yet greater Presents: For the King not only made very rich Offerings, but also bestowed very large Presents on the great Men that accompanied him...But the present King [Agbangla] hath broke off this Custom, which is accordingly grown in disuse for several Years past. In his last Tour which he made to the Snake-House, he was (as I am informed) accompanied by Monsieur Ducas [Sieur Du Casse], a French Captain, who was ridiculous enough, to the Scandal of all Europeans, to dress himself in Tyger's Skins and other sort of Trifles, and lead the King in this Equipage to the Snake-House.

Norman (El) College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, VA, USA e-mail: nlnorman@wm.edu Springer</page><page sequence="2">240 J World Prehist (2010) 23:239-254 The Dutch trader and slaver William Bosman recorded this account of the kingdom of Hueda (or Whydah) after his visit to the West Coast of Africa between 1697 and 1699 (Bosman 1705, p. 368). The passage describes an earlier (c. 1688) moment in Huedan history when king Agbangla attempted to distance himself from lavish annual public religious parades; events that included impressive processions of meticulously dressed royals and their retainers, resonant music, distribution of gifts, and the?most likely sar donic?participation of at least one European trader. What appeared scandalous when Sieur Du Casse processed with the parade c. 1688 apparently became commonplace thereafter, as European traders often accompanied the parading royal court, though sub sequently they appear to have worn European dress (for a full description see Law 1991a, pp. 51-52). Setting aside for the moment the often pejorative tones and tropes that per meate such accounts, Europeans recorded with awe the material wealth Huedan kings organized for procession between the Huedan palace complex at Savi and the temple of the kingdom's tutelary deity, the python Dangbe (Fig. 1). Some of these riches resulted from Atlantic trade, as from the mid-seventeenth century Huedan kings and traders profited greatly from the traffic in war captives, who were removed from as far away as several hundreds of miles into the interior. At the kingdom's apex, Huedan kings controlled an outlet to the Atlantic Ocean and developed this prime trading territory into an international coastal entrepot. In return for the captives bound for slave societies in the Americas, trade items from throughout the Atlantic World flooded into the area. Yet strife apparently accompanied these gains, as historic accounts record that various community leaders sparred with the king over control of the Atlantic markets located near the Huedan palace complex at Savi (Law 1991b, pp. 59-62). Hueda itself is one of three major polities that hejd sway over the Bight of Benin from at least the mid-seventeenth century AD. At its economic and political apex c. 1700, Hueda is best described as a factious state-like political network with a king and at least 23 com peting elite community leaders living within a region approximately 40 km east-west by 25 km north-south (Law 1990, 1991a, b). The historical record is murky regarding the Ghana Togo Benin ( Nigeria \ Modern Political Boundary Forest Zone 160 km Fig. 1 Bight of Benin Region Springer</page><page sequence="3">J World Prehist (2010) 23:239-254 241 non-elite component of the polity, but based on travelers' accounts, historians estimate approximately 100,000 people living in the kingdom in around AD 1700 (Law 1991b, pp. 58-60). The polity of Hueda, and its namesake the coastal town of Ouidah, are infamous in the history of the Atlantic world as, between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries, approximately 396,000 people embarked from Ouidah beach into the horror of the middle passage (Voyages 2008). For the period between the mid-seventeenth to early eighteenth centuries, elite Huedans leveraged their control over this local channel into the Atlantic world to extract taxes from both African and European traders who moved war captives through their territory (Akinjogbin 1967; Law 1991b). Within the Hueda polity, the center of political deliberation, judicial debate, and economic transactions, located approximately 7 km from the coast, was the palatial capital complex at Savi (Kelly 1997a, b, 2001). Recent archaeological research revealed that a 10 x 10 km region surrounding the core complex was dominated by a vast urban landscape characterized by palatial centers, urban warrens, and agricultural zones (Kelly 1997a; Norman 2009a). In historical discussions of Hueda as an emerging regional trading center for captives bound for the Atlantic world c. 1650-1727, the growing scheduling irregularity of the annual procession to the temple of Dangbe is presented as symptomatic of, and adding to, internal elite factionalism (Akinjogbin 1967; Law 1991b). Although it is well-historicized as a common element of the social and political worlds of the interrelated polities of Allada, Hueda, and Dahomey (Bay 1998; Law 1989; 1991b; Monroe 2007), less attention has been focused on the role that the managed movement of people, goods, and song played in framing political relationships through circulating and sustaining discourses on political authority and morality. This paper attempts to posit stronger links between organized public spectacle and Huedan political processes. It argues that the annual parade to the temple of Dangbe represented the end of a ritual cycle encompassing systems of repayment and remuneration. Fig. 2 Historic polities in the Dahomey Gap Region Springer</page><page sequence="4">242 J World Prehist (2010) 23:239-254 In the Bight of Benin region of West Africa during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries (Fig. 1), the exercise of political power is theorized in terms of the ability of elites to make claims on the labor potential of those living within their sphere of political influence. In the Dahomey Gap region (see Fig. 2), this process is illustrated with examples of non-elite people who presented to elites 'taxes' in the form of compulsory labor and a percentage of their crops (Law 1991b, pp. 34-55, 92-95). Kings of the three best-known Dahomey Gap polities of Allada, Hueda, and Dahomey (Fig. 2) possessed wide latitude to call for labor, knowledge, specialized skills, or even the immediate death of followers. In turn, kings of the Dahomey Gap region provided material rewards for local community leaders, and to a lesser extent the general populace, as one of the numerous mechanisms that made these actions possible (Law 1991b, pp. 79-88). Exchanges of social and material capital were often accompanied by elaborate ceremonial feasts that signaled the final phase of the transaction, and perhaps most importantly, registered the fulfillment of commitments within the public record (Law 1991a). This paper argues that Huedan parades often announced feasts aimed at settling, or renegotiating, social debt. Historical accounts record Huedans who described their deities and cosmological actors as expecting gifts and sacrifice (Law 1991a, b; Herskovits 1932, 1938); this paper argues that non-elite people in the service of Huedan kings did so as well. As public performances where political relations were negotiated through gifting and ritualized consumption, the Huedan grand parade cycle mirrored the ritual and political processes described in systems of local community organization, or Dokpwe (Herskovits 1932, 1938). During associated acts of commensal consumption, patrons feted those in their service to secure social and political relations (Dietler 2001). By focusing on the various scales of ritual process within the Hueda kingdom, this paper attempts to shift the discussion away from top-down constructions where political power is considered to emanate from palaces and radiate out to non-elite areas. In such theoretical constructions, parades and public displays of wealth are considered conspicuous exhibitions of wealth that worked to bolster politically driven ideologies by exhibiting the physical strength, social viability, and economic wealth of elites (e.g., DeMarrais et al. 1996). In place of such top-down models, this paper builds on discussions of spectacle that recognize that non-elite people often compel, coerce, or demand such events as part of their sense of well being (Kus 1989). In the Hueda Kingdom, statewide spectacles were not only instrumental actions taken by elites, but also an expectation of non-elite people, demanded and desired by them as they sought to participate in relations of power. These demands were forged in the daily rituals that non-elite people carried out at their houses, and thus spectacular public feasts drew on the structure, material culture, and rhythm of these. Thus, I begin with a discussion of the archaeological evidence of ritual and feasting at the household level, followed by an exploration of parades and public feasting as understood through historical, ethnographic and oral traditional sources. Lines of Evidence As an Atlantic trading entrepot, Hueda attracted European traders, chroniclers, and diarists. Researchers have mined these European historical sources to produce Atlantic and elite histories of Hueda (e.g., Akinjogbin 1967; Bay 1998; Law 1991b; Thornton 1995). These written sources contain detailed descriptions of Huedan courtly life, as well as the actions of Europeans who, by order of Huedan kings, lived and traded while being largely confined to the palace complex at Savi (Kelly 1997a). To these written documents, researchers have ^ Springer</page><page sequence="5">J World Prehist (2010) 23:239-254 243 added local oral histories to provide alternative windows into the Huedan past (Law 2004). This scholarship builds on the longstanding tradition in sub-Saharan Africa of drawing together written, oral, and archaeological sources in order to produce multifaceted narra tives of the past (DeCorse 1996). Kenneth Kelly first conducted archaeological research on Hueda in the early 1990s (1997a, b, 2001). Kelly focused on the palatial Huedan capital at Savi in order to illuminate continuity and change associated with the massive influx of European trade goods into elite spheres of exchange. Recent research by the author focused on survey and excavations aimed at integrating the Huedan countryside with this emerging narrative (Norman 2009a). This project has provided material evidence from secondary palace centers and village sites that heretofore had been largely omitted from historical and archaeological discussions of Hueda. The Savi Countryside Archaeological project revealed economic integration between countryside sites and international markets at Savi and Ouidah (Norman 2008). In terms of locally produced trade items, there is a striking similarity between the assemblages of smoking pipes and earthenware ceramic hollowware vessels in countryside sites and those recovered by Kelly at Savi. However, excavations at Savi exhibited a much greater range and frequency of imported trade items than those in the countryside. The few imported trade items recovered from the countryside clustered in three main locales: underneath prepared living surfaces inside structures, in purposefully constructed free standing structures near house compounds, and along the exterior of houses along walls within the shelter of roof eaves (Norman 2009a). Ethnographic and historical accounts suggest that Huedans arranged these clusters of imported items (as well as local items, discussed below) in religious rituals. In the Savi countryside, shrines were recovered within the same strata as other domestic assemblages, suggesting broad contemporary living surfaces surrounding the house compounds. The discussion below draws from recent excavations by the author at four relatively large house compounds located within 1 and 3 km of the palace at Savi (Norman 2008,2009a). All of the archaeological contexts described below contain contemporary seventeenth and eighteenth century imported European artifacts. Likewise, all of the contexts discussed below exhibited massive burning; a fiery destructive event sealed the contexts in the early eighteenth century with little resettlement thereafter. Most likely, the broad swath of destruction visited on these sites resulted from a campaign of conquest by the kingdom of Dahomey in 1727, or shortly thereafter (Norman 2009a). Regardless of the cause, the contemporary lens of destruction offers an ideal setting to pose archaeological comparisons. The contents of archaeologically investigated shrines were markedly different than those found in other domestic assemblages. For example, the number and frequency of decorated (e.g., roulette, slipped, and incised) local earthenware vessels and vessel frag ments is higher in shrines than in refuse pits or other living areas. Also, ceramic vessels with anthropomorphic or zoomorphic additions were recovered almost exclusively in settings interpreted as ritual spaces. Three of the vessel forms?a long vase with applied cordons along the neck, a shallow plate with incised decorations on its interior base, and a perforated jar?were also recovered almost exclusively in ritual settings. All three of these forms are available in modern ritual markets, and each is used to mark ritual space and transfer food, drink, and material wealth to shrines. In particular, the jar and plate are used to convey sanctified beverages (e.g., water, beer, spirits) and foodstuff (e.g., palm oil, meat, maize porridge) to shrines. The seventeenth and eighteenth century ritual settings also contained concentrations of highly fragmentary faunal remains. While most of the faunal remains were too decom posed to classify beyond large mammal, several human crania were recovered inside large Springer</page><page sequence="6">244 J World Prehist (2010) 23:239-254 storage jars, which probably helped shield the deposits from highly acidic soil. In preparing these settings, Huedans arranged locally produced ritual ceramics, faunal offerings, vegetal material, and imported trade items around the large storage jars with human crania (Norman 2009b). When comparing ritual spaces to other settings around archaeologically-explored house compounds, imported trade items clustered almost exclusively around ritual ceramics and/ or human remains. Imported wine bottles and bottle fragments, glass beads, hand-made nails and other iron fasteners, and imported ceramics were all recovered in markedly high concentrations in and around shrines. Likewise, shrines contained the highest concentration of imported white clay smoking pipes and cowry shells (Cypraea moneta) (Norman 2009b). Given the material and spatial similarity between modern shrines and the seven teenth and eighteenth century archaeologically observed ones, it is highly likely that these trade items were placed in the shrines as sacrifices to cosmological actors, or staged in these areas for later ritual activity. Today, ritual practitoners initiated into the worship of local deities or vodun, describe 'feeding' such shrines with vegetal and animal sacrifices as well as occasional extraordinary items drawn from further afield. In modern times, family elders alongside hired ritual specialists conduct ceremonies of protection and thanksgiving, among myriad others. Modern practitioners explain that if cosmological work has been done on the behalf of a family, then the deities involved expect a feast of thanks. Eth nographic and historical documents suggest similar religious processes were occurring in the modern and seventeenth century Huedan world (Bay 2008). This paper argues that domestic feasting rituals, materialized in the archaeological record by collections of human remains, imported items, and receptacles for food and drink, are better understood when discussed alongside public acts of feasting. The remainder of this paper uses ethnographic and historical material to draw such parallels. Power, Ritual, and the Theatrics of Social Action This paper, along with the others in the volume, builds on African theories of power which are defined more by their collective than their coercive characteristics (e.g., Arens and Karp 1989). A key component in these constructions is that in African settings, elite political leaders often orchestrate the circulation of resources, rather than accumulating them (Mclntosh 1999). Thus, the exercise of political power is often tied in a direct way to political leaders invoking moral authority to make legal claims over the bodies and labor potential of their followers, rather than through other means such as property rights (Thornton 1995). In societies where both resources and political authority are more dis persed than centralized, more federated than federal (Miller 2004), political power as a potentiality requires a means?often cosmological?of translation into exercisable authority (Herbert 1993, p. 2, 237). In addressing the means and modes of transfer, archaeological theorists are paying increasing attention to the close relationship between theatrical performative acts, nego tiations of influence, and political action (Inomata and Coben 2006). This work grows from a large body of anthropological literature describing the close relationship between the organization and coordination of religious ritual on the one hand and political authority on the other. However, religious rituals are never events that simply maintain stasis and bolster ideological claims of power. Carnivalesque events often level relations of power (e.g., Bakhtin 1984, 1993) and as Turner (1972) vividly describes, moments of ritual fervour hold the potential to cause dynamic structural and political change. Springer</page><page sequence="7">J World Prehist (2010) 23:239-254 245 Indeed, community-wide rituals are often enacted within contested landscapes where people exert earnest emotional outpouring and material sacrifices in pursuit of balanced cosmological relationships and favourable imbalances in earthly political relationships. Alongside serving as theatres of social action where political leaders and their courtiers employ religious rites and associated symbols of office in support of their own regimes, rituals often become interwoven into the rhythm of annual life to the point that popular opinion demands elaborate ceremonies. These spectacular events can then become the burdensome duty of elites and a right of the populace (Inomata and Coben 2006, p. 28; Pearson and Thomas 1994). Thus, elites withholding public ceremonial ritual are at times met with discontent, disillusionment, rebellion or simply non-cooperation (Kus 1989). Once the escalating cycle of ritual has begun, ever-increasing spectacles are required to anchor discourses of morality and prominence to associated regimes of power (Foucault 1977). In turn, the populace at times comes to consider regular spectacular events as a measure of social stability and happiness (Kus 1989). In these ways, religious spectacle can aid in the creation of a sense of rootedness and well-being that links elites, commoners, and the physical landscape while at the same time producing the potential for stress and strain within a political coalition. Nonetheless, ceremonies, whether held at the largest public arenas or the smallest family shrines, can be inhabited by multiple conflicting, contesting, or contrary discourses that debate the moral authority required to lead ceremonies, the proper etiquette and actions necessary to venerate cosmological actors, and disbelief of the ideological and religious institutions promoting the ceremonies. To be sure, if such disbelief is widespread it can lead to societal reorganization, or collapse. However, tensions inherent in ritual that draw fractious distinctions between participants should not be viewed as solely instituting political fission. As Piot demonstrates, ritual can work to foment conflict and differenti ation between actors, conflict that is '...less a threat than it is a feature essential to the system's internal differentiation' (Piot 1992, p. 47). The following section explores the role of spectacular ritual and smaller household ceremonies in framing political discourses, marking distinctions, and producing a sense of community-wide well-being in the Hueda kingdom. Social Strife, Harmonic Fields, and the Politics of Procession The recorded history of the Huedan kingdom, from its first mention in 1671 to its conquest and utter decimation by the kingdom of Dahomey in 1727, is best described through the numerous political conflicts and military actions that rocked the kingdom (Akinjogbin 1967; Law 1991b). Threats to the Huedan royalty came from both foreign and domestic sources. Frequently, rival Huedan elites openly quarreled with the royalty and refused the king's troops permission to pass through their territory. In these historical narratives, non elite Huedans are often described as caught between quarrelling elites and drawn into associated political intrigue. As part of their claims of authority, elite Huedans mobilized material symbols and enacted a series of spectacular performative acts (Law 1989). Daily performances of Huedan political theatre often opened with a resounding sonic start. Phillips (1732, p. 215) recorded that 'When any ...[Huedan nobleman] travels, he has ten or a dozen...[followers] with guns, to attend his hammock, making great huzzaings according to their way, and firing along the road; and when arriv'd at his journey's end they fire a volley, which is the utmost of his grandeur.' Apparently as Huedan elites rode elevated in hammocks through ?l Springer</page><page sequence="8">246 J World Prehist (2010) 23:239-254 Huedan streets large crowds of their followers joined the processions. Thomas Astley (1745-1747, p. 42) referred to '...the great Men of Whidah, attended by their usual Train, and prodigious Concourse of People...' Most likely, such entourages served as protection to traveling elite and physical signs of the ability of individuals to mobilize, organize, and coordinate followers. The parades were prominent displays of wealth in the form of assembled followers and costly European trade items. From historical documentation it is clear that processions coincided with outward displays of humility and obsequiousness. Bosman (1705, p. 345 [italics in original]) chronicled that '...when the King's Wives go to the Field to work, as they do daily by Hundreds, they are certain whenever they meet a Man, to cry out, Stand clear; after which he either immediately falls on his Knees or flat on the Ground, and waits their passing, without presuming so much as a look.' These calls were also fair warning to passers-by, as to touch, or be touched by, the 'wife' of the king carried with it the immediately executable penalty of death (Law 1991a). Astley (1745-1747, p. 44) recorded a similar account of song being used to lighten work given in the form of taxation, and to reward the completion of a day's labor, such that: After these People have sung and danced some Time before the Palace Gate, while the Grandees receive the King's Orders from the first Valet de Chambre, they fly like Bucks to the Places assigned them; and while these armed sing and dance to the Music, near the Grandee, who inspects the Work, the Labourers work briskly to the Tune of the Instruments, so that it seems a Diversion rather than a Toil. They break up the Ground in high Ridges, those of the King's Lands being higher that those of the Subjects. They plant or sow two Days after. At Night they return to sing and dance before the Palace, while the Grandees, who oversaw the Work, give an Account to the King; after which every one repairs home. Elite Huedans employed auditory signaling at home as well, as guards were instructed to fire musket salvos at intervals while they dined. The French traveler and trader Jean Barbot (Hair et al. 1992, p. 642) noted that they said it was 'to honor them and because they are very fond of this noise'. However, this characterization seems to be far too simple a summary. Undoubtedly, the auditory signaling also worked to announce to the broader community the ritualized consumption taking place privately at the tables of Huedan kings and local community leaders (Dietler 2001). There appears to be a close relationship between presentations of copious food and drink and Huedan political maneuverings. European traders recorded that, by necessity, the later kings of Hueda hosted daily meals for local community leaders. Bosman (1705, p. 362) recounted that: Besides these [military and tribute expenses], and the necessary Expenses of his Household, together with the rich Offerings he is obliged to make to his Idol-Gods, he is daily obliged to keep four Thousand Men, and to provide with Meat and Drink; and tho' he doth not esteem his Subjects more than his Slaves yet when he employs them he is obliged to pay them dear enough. This passage is telling on many counts but particularly in its illustration of Huedan systems of reciprocity; food and drink fulfilling?at least partially?obligations for work done. Bosman's characterization of 'obliged' could be parsed and interpreted at many degrees of reciprocal intensity. However, there appears to be ethnographic justification, in the institution of dokpwe, to highlight the agency of local community leaders in maintaining the flow of reciprocal feasts. ^ Springer</page><page sequence="9">J World Prehist (2010) 23:239-254 247 Investigating the early twentieth century colonial remnants of the kingdom of Dahomey, Mellville Herskovits (1932, 1938) recorded dokpwe as a 'force' with the potential to harness human-power towards the needs of an individual in particular or the polity in general. In a similar rendering, the Scottish traveler W. J. Argyle characterized dokpwe as an 'ancient' institution that 'existed before there were kings' in Dahomey as a means of mobilizing communal labor. Argyle suggested that in the early iterations of the polity, when there were no 'chiefs', the dokpwegan was in command of the village. Within this decentralized arrangement, Argyle argues that the male members of the village formed the dokpwe as today, and the cultivation was done communally. Argyle suggests that some what later, with the coming of chiefs and kings, disputes arose as to their respective authority (Argyle 1966, p. 170). Herskovits more thoroughly explored the processes at play in such negotiations of political authority and characterized the politically binding processes of dokpwe as ema nating from the level of the community, specifically village, where the sick could request aid in tilling their fields and a married man could petition for assistance in fulfilling yearly labor responsibilities to his father(s)-in-law. During Herskovits's fieldwork in the early twentieth century, he noted that every community had a dokpwegan, or a man appointed by the king who managed and monitored this system, but not necessarily in the name of the king (Herskovits 1932, 1938). Unlike most political processes in the kingdom of Dahomey described as emanating from the royal line and secondary elite networks, Herskovits described the power behind dokpwe as essentially one of public opinion, where participants are loath to offend the principle of mutual aid and face the ire of their local communities. Herskovits suggested that no member of the Dahomean kingdom was exempted from its call and records one oral tradition where King Gezo of Dahomey paid a fine levied by a dokpwegan after he passed by a dokpwe work detail without offering aid. Researchers have identified elements of the dokpwe in the Huedan past, but have yet to deal with its materiality on the ground, or the ways that ceremonies must articulate and resonate at increasing scales. For our discussion, the important points are that (1) dokpwe served as a social contract binding elite and non elite people and (2) the recipient of labor, military services, etcetera was obliged to host a feast that symbolized formally the end of the work, recognized all who participated in the efforts, and reaffirmed the system of dokpwe itself (Polanyi 1966, pp. 60-66). For the Hueda kingdom, the confluence of feasting, ritual spectacle, and systems of reciprocity? similar to dokpwe?appear in high relief from documentary sources describing the annual procession to the temple of Dangbe. The Huedan Parade Season Kings of Hueda rarely left the palace at Savi, often only once a year. John Atkins (1735, p. 110), the English trader who visited Savi in 1721, noted that at the time of his visit the last king of Hueda, Huffon, had not left his palace for several years. Atkins suggested that one reason for this seclusion was a large 'Dole' he owed to the people. Presumably part of the debt related to king Huffon drawing back from annual public rituals associated with Dangbe. Historical documents are unequivocal in describing Dangbe as the senior tutelary deity in the Huedan pantheon. The European trader Bosman (1705, p. 369) suggested that Huedans evoked Dangbe often, but notably during shared interests and corporate political ceremonies. Dangbe, although a public deity, was closely associated with the Huedan royal family (Law 1991b, pp. 95, 109-110). Springer</page><page sequence="10">248 J World Prehist (2010) 23:239-254 Fig. 3 Procession to the Temple of Dangbe. From Astley (1745-1747, p. 42) The principal ceremony in the Huedan ritual calendar involved the annual parade to the Grand Temple of Dangbe (Fig. 3). During such parades, it appears that a premium was put on attendance and bodily comportment exhibiting calm and control. Astley (1745-1747, p. 33) recorded that notice of the parade was given and the people were required to attend the ceremony where '...Constables, with large Rods or Switches in their Hands, go foremost to keep Order, and make Way. These oblige the People, gathered near the Temple-Gate, to sit on their Heels and keep Silence.' There seems to be some dissonance between the suggestion that crowds were both compelled to attend and in need of parting. Nevertheless, it appears that a large portion of the Huedan population attended the cere mony, with many participating in the procession itself. In describing one grand parade, Astley (1745-1747, p. 43) noted approximately 430 participants, 260 men and 170 women, including the king dressed in the most 'magnificent' manner wearing a gilt 'helmet' with red and white feathers. This number included the 'king's' musketeers; the 'king's' trumpeters; a drum major along with 'many' drummers; flutists; and 'wives' of the king who carried presents to the python deity including cowries, brandy, linens, calicos, and silk. Astley recorded that many female participants processed with gifts of prepared food for Dangbe from the king. Alongside the Master of Ceremonies, Astley recorded that the 'Queen Mother' was borne in a sedan chair and that the king's 'wives' were lavishly dressed such that 'These Women were rather loaded than adorned with Gold Necklaces, Pendants, and Bracelets, Foot-Chains of Gold and Silver, and the richest Jewels.' Astely (1745-1747, p. 33) wrote that as the participants reached the Grand Temple of Dangbe, they assumed positions of humility before the temple gates where '...they prostrated themselves with Faces to the Earth at the Gate, clapping their Hands, throwing Dust on their Head, and giving Shouts of Joy.' It appears that the parading tradition was important even when the king did not serve as the head officiate, as Astley (1745-1747, p. 42) recorded that: .. .the Grandees and People are employed in making Processions to the Temple of the Serpent, to pray that this new Prince may be just as good as his Predecessor, that he Springer</page><page sequence="11">J World Prehist (2010) 23:239-254 249 may cause trade to flourish, and the Laws to be observed; and that he may Preserve the People in their Rights and Liberties. This is the Work each Day. The Nights are spent in feasting one another, Dancing, Acclamations, Music, firing of Guns, and such a Confusion of Noises as is enough to deafen those who are not used to such Extravagancies. Part of the political usefulness of parades to the Huedan royal throne, or in keeping with the royal furnishing of the region, royal stool, involved their ability to evoke the king as ceremonial host of the feast without his actual attendance at the ceremony. Occasionally, the king sent his representatives to the procession without participating in it himself (Law 1991a). As Ray (1987, pp. 67-68) argues, material reserved for ritual contexts that is presented occasionally in public ceremonies serves to 'presence' senior officials who host the ceremonies in absentia. The act of transference operates through the power of con notation in practice, the remote introduction of individuals or categories of person into contexts and interactions in which they are not directly involved. The extraordinary items drawn from West Africa and the Atlantic world offered 'material metaphors' that encapsulated moral (or social) ritual relationships through the portrayal of objects and cosmological creatures (Ray 1987, p. 67). As part of this presentation, one could interpret European participants processing in the ceremony as an attempt by the Huedan stool to portray mastery over European trade, and arguably the European traders (Kelly 1997a). This is quite a different portrayal from that in the passage cited at the opening of this paper with its pejorative sense of the ceremony focusing on European agency and action. Rather, it appears that Huedan kings mustered and presented the moving bodies of European visitors as symbols of foreign elite connections, and perhaps cosmological oddities that, if harnessed correctly, held positive potentiality in terms of the kingdom's future. In a similar sense one may view the presentation of finery drawn from throughout the Atlantic world as a display of cosmological blessing and the participation by such figures as the 'King's Mother' as a portrayal of timelessness and continuity between reigns of fathers and sons (Bay 1998). In terms of cosmology, it is notable that Europeans recorded the 'King's Dwarves' partic ipating. Today, as in ethnohistorical accounts, dwarfism is closely associated with the deity toko and people with short stature are considered to have the ability to channel the forces of toko (Norman 2009b; Herskovits 1938). Thus physical representations of extraordinary elements of the cosmos found themselves in close association and positions of prominence in the grand parades. It appears that such parades related to active attempts by the Huedan stool to frame discourses over authority and prominence. Some of these discourses surrounded the bodies of the participants and involved metaphor and rebus to embed obscured, yet pointed messages within displays of material culture. As Bay (2008) notes, Dahomean artists subtly work expressions of authority, comforting messages, playful puns, and insults with direct political overtones into ancestral memorials. There can be little doubt that Huedan kings attempted, through these displays, to depict their ability to control a range of people and things: the processing bodies of Europeans, elements of Atlantic wealth, and avatars of cosmological actors. At a less subtle level, the auditory displays, assembled combatants, and sheer numbers of participants worked to create blunt reminders that the Huedan stool could organize large, well-appointed parades that directly competed with local community leaders who, as noted earlier, organized rival processions of their own. It is evident from accounts of local community leaders also parading with boisterous entourages through the town of Savi that the parading tradition was used in competing narratives to the stool. As a countermeasure to upstart local political leaders, it is telling that after making procession ^ Springer</page><page sequence="12">250 J World Prehist (2010) 23:239-254 through town to the palace, ceremonial protocol dictated that Huedan community leaders remove their public finery and don coarser cloth before entering the royal audience chamber (Law 1991a, b). While the parades were a chance for the Huedan stool to orchestrate displays of prominence, they were also a time of royal redistribution. Numerous historical documents indicate that a portion of the paraded wealth was bound for Dangbe, his priests, and local community leaders. Gifting rarely occurs without obligation; it normally relates to pro cesses that create or respond to social debt (Mauss 2000). Indeed, it seems likely, that the grand parade was part of the dramaturgical trappings of a feast provided for Dangbe who brought order and riches to the kingdom and for local community leaders who organized labor details for the service of the Huedan stool (Norman and Kelly 2004). The moving nature of the prelude to the feast made the repayment of such debts public. As is the practice today, it seems that these acts of repayment were made in loudly verbalized public events; debtors often announce the transfer of the balance to the lender, thus avoiding confusion over repayment and placing the transaction on the spoken public record. In the next section, I take up again the issues of ritualized obligations, reciprocity, and the multifaceted political dimensions of the feast in and around seventeenth and eighteenth century house compounds. I argue that archaeologically recorded shrines dating to the Huedan era related to a similar series of political negotiations and reciprocal exchanges. Micro-Politics of the Feast, Archaeological Implications In the seventeenth and eighteenth century Huedan world, small ritual spaces and larger free-standing shrines marked points of interaction between cosmological and physical worlds; they were points on the landscape where Huedans implored cosmological actors to congregate. Reciprocity was required to maintain a fine balance between ancestors, members of the Huedan pantheon, and members of a particular family or house compound. There is good evidence from documentary sources that Huedans provided offerings of foodstuff, alcohol, and the blood of sacrificial animals to family shrines (Bay 2008, pp. 43-44; Dapper 1970[1686], p. 307; Labouret and Rivet 1929). From complementary ethnographic accounts and historical explorations that push the bounds of our under standing of Huedan religious traditions back into the seventeenth century, we know that these offerings operated within a social world where vacillating spirits require sacrifice and offerings to attract their attention and fix their concentration on the needs and desires of those presenting the sacrifices (Bay 2008; Blier 1996). In modern times, the structure of the ceremonies where Huedans commune with ancestors before shrines often takes the form of a feast where the assembled family members, invitees, and ritual specialists work to appease and loudly extol cosmological actors with song while food and drink are offered. The archaeologically recovered shrines dating to the seventeenth to eighteenth centuries apparently also served as the repositories for material gifts and offerings associated at least in part with such systems of reciprocity. Imported trade pipes, European glass trade beads, imported wine bottle fragments, and imported nails were all recovered in high concen trations in and around ritual settings. These spaces included offerings cached away under living surfaces, free standing shrines located just outside of house compounds, and offering locales in central courtyards. Locally produced hand-built coarse earthenware ritual ceramics were the other item prominent in these ritual spaces, along with locally produced smoking pipes, quartz cobbles, and European gunflints. It is apparent from both historical records dating to the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and subsequent ethnographic Springer</page><page sequence="13">J World Prehist (2010) 23:239-254 251 research that part of the logic underpinning the social work of shrines and offering spaces was their ability to secure relationships with cosmological actors, who Huedans considered to bring balance and to allay fears and anxiety (Law 1990). Ceremonies and interactions with shrines were both proactive?anticipating future needs and desires?and retroactive and compensatory. Huedans rewarded cosmological work by hosting household feasts for ancestors and cosmological actors. Given the archaeological finding of material wealth pooling in and around seventeenth and eighteenth century shrines within house compounds in the Huedan countryside, it can be argued that both kings and the heads of families organized ceremonial feasts for those who came to their aid. Conclusions We have a Custom which is quite contrary to that of the Ardrahrians. I am obliged to go out at different Times of the Year, and strew great Quantities of Goods and Money amongst the Common People, and make sacrifices to our Gods and Forefa thers, sometimes of Slaves (which part of the Custom I have much broken) some times of Horses, other times of Oxen and other Creatures. (King Agaja, cited in Law 2002, p. 269) In the above passage drawn from an early eighteenth century manuscript, King Agaja of Dahomey recounts to a European chronicler his obligation to distribute gifts to the 'common people' of the kingdom during elaborate ceremonies. This paper has traced a similar theme in the political processes of the nearby Hueda kingdom. It draws on models of African political systems that directly relate relative prominence or 'wealth' to the number of specialists and non-elite followers a leader can assemble (Guyer 1993; Guyer and Belinga 1995). In a commensal turn, the Huedan example illustrates that those who receive service, labor, or support are obliged to reciprocate and specifically to offer feasts and spectacle to their followers. Maintaining the fragile Huedan political coalition apparently required rewarding political followers with food and gifts. Arguably, such royal feasting and feting obligations worked to level the Huedan political landscape by placing burdensome and routine obligations on Huedan kings and their royal coffers. The grand parade to the Temple of Dangbe served as one of the social vehicles through which gifts of food, cloth finery, and durable riches were transferred between the Huedan crown and the principal temple to Dangbe and regional community leaders. Beyond securing relationships between the Huedan stool, cosmos, and elites, it is clear that non elite Huedans attending the ceremony came to view the carnivalesque atmosphere of the parade as a measure of well-being and a yearly respite from quotidian life. Historical documents indicate that non-elite Huedans came to expect the annual parade. It is telling that as the grand parade was not always forthcoming during the yearly ritual cycle, local community leaders orchestrated their own public parading displays through the kingdom. These smaller displays mirrored, on a micro-scale, the structure and pageantry of the grand parade. It is not surprising that local community leaders?many of whom quarreled openly with the Huedan stool?arranged their own processions of people as a means of expressing social prominence by displaying their followers, attracting followers from rival community leaders, and illustrating their ability to organize and orchestrate impressive numbers of people into moving displays of fervor. In the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Huedan social world there were many layers, dimensions, and courses to the feast. From the level of the household, to community Springer</page><page sequence="14">252 J World Prehist (2010) 23:239-254 organizations aimed at mutual aid and co-operation, to associations between elite Huedans; feasting and gifting were integral components of Huedan political negotiations and the exercise of political authority. The requirement on kings to reciprocate through feasts gives new insight into the numerous networks that diffused political authority away from the Huedan kingship. Moreover, it appears that debts to the general population became overwhelming; the steady withdrawal of Huedan kings from the grand parade suggests an inability to resolve social debts through public feasts or public spectacle. Indeed, it appears that non-elite Huedans, who toiled in royal fields, and local community leaders, who organized such efforts, came to expect feasting and grand parades to fulfill social contracts. Such systems of display and reciprocity can also be seen in the archaeological record from research around house compounds of local community leaders. These findings suggest that heads of Huedan families were equally occupied with holding feasts for ancestral figures and other cosmological actors. In the Huedan kingdom, the moral authority to lead was closely intertwined with political or familial leaders serving as good hosts and feasting or feting those cosmological and earthly actors who did work on their behalf. The Huedan example provides a historically well-documented case study to add to investigation in the deeper archaeological past of people who used feasts to secure group cohesion within political coalitions (Palaima 2004; Steel 2004). Such ceremonies are often associated with public mortuary rites that venerated ancestors through sacrifice and gifts of food (Lau 2002). The Huedan example reinforces archaeological findings that choice cuts of meat and exotic foodstuff were part of the suite of symbols employed in the social, ceremonial, and political dynamics of earlier cultural groups (Jackson and Scott 2003). Competitive feasting with diacritical meals that muster such exotic items were social vehicles that marked status relationships between archaeological actors (LeCount 2001). Increasingly, archaeologists are examining evidence of both spectacular and smaller cer emonies as events that punctuated quotidian life and served as markers against which archaeological actors reckoned their relationship with one another and annual seasonal cycling (Schmidt 1996). As power laden events, such rituals hold the potential to integrate increasingly large numbers of people and advance political agendas, particularly as these relate to surpluses and the ways in which they are deployed (Lucero 2003). Feasts and spectacle are part of the fluid negotiations of political authority that characterize daily life. Moreover, archaeological evidence suggests that symbols of the feast permeated daily life and percolated from the household to the most spectacular affairs of state (Smith 2000). With Hueda, we see an example where state-wide ceremonies seize up and stop circulating the stuff of feasts and feting, leading to fractured political relationships. Once large-scale feasts and spectacle are set into motion as a political strategy, it is perilous?to paraphrase Herman Wouk?for those who stop the carnival.
