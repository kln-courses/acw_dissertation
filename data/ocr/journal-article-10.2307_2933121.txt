<plain_text><page sequence="1">Compromised Romanticism in Jude the Obscure MICHAEL E. HASSETT A FEW YEARS BEFORE HE WROTE Jude the Obscure, Thomas Hardy remarked a "woeful fact-that the human race is too extremely developed for its corporeal conditions, the nerves being evolved to an activity abnormal in such an environment.... This planet does not supply the materials for happiness to higher exist- ences." 1 Like much of Hardy's fiction and verse, Jude focuses on the dilemma of a perceptive man in an uncongenial world, and on particular kinds of response to this situation. Immediately ap- parent to someone coming to this book from readings in the earlier nineteenth century is the way this emphasis on "man's refusal to be held in the process of mere general being, and his inability to make his refusal prevail" 2 seems to deny the Romantics' faith in the power of a transcending or transforming imagination. Indeed, Jude Fawley's failures illustrate problems inherent in a "Romantic" approach to actual life. He and Sue Bridehead re- peatedly create imaginative substitutes for reality, but their Romanticism is compromised in practical application. A consistent Romantic response to everyday experience simply cannot be main- tained. As a boy, Jude is keenly aware of life's inequities. Unlike most countryfolk, who think little about their relations with animals and the earth, Jude finds that things do not 'rhyme" as they should, and "mercy towards one set of creatures was cruelty towards Michael E.

In con- trast with the ugliness epitomized by the brown field of Mr. Trout- ham, Jude thinks of Christminster as a place of beauty, a para- disiacal "city of light." This dream of a kind of heavenly Jerusalem is the first of many fantasies accepted by Jude as alternatives to natural life. Imagination is clearly a defense against reality and its conditions, for the university is described as a "castle, manned by scholarship and religion." Later the metaphor changes, but the goal of permanence and psychic safety remains: "Beautiful cityl ... so unravaged by the fierce intellectual life of our century, so serenel" (25, 94-95) Imaginative transcendence is a familiar motive of a certain kind of Romanticism, perhaps best typified by the verse of Shelley: my spirit's bark is driven, Far from the shore, far from the trembling throng Whose sails were never to the tempest given; The massy earth and sphered skies are riven! I am borne darkly, fearfully, afar. (Adonais, 11. 488-92) The significance of Shelley in Jude the Obscure will be further discussed. Here, though, one should note certain particular fea- tures of Jude's variety of Romanticism. Foolish as the boy is upon first seeing Christminster from the roof of a barn-he runs home with thoughts of giants, Apollyon, and Herne the Hunter-this experience recalls other Romantic epiphanies, "spots of time" in which the intractable world yields to a vision of ideal spiritual truth. We know that the atmospheric condition rather than any miracle offers the basic matter of Jude's "vision," but the same interaction of ordinary phenomena and active imagination char- acterizes the insights of works such as The Prelude, Keats's Ode to a Nightingale, and Shelley's Hymn to Intellectual Beauty. Jude's ideal is a recourse from his experienced environment, and so it departs from what he considers the conditions of natural life. Since the Marygreen world seems oriented almost wholly toward physical existence, the dream is of a purely mental and spiritual state of being. The cart driver describes a Christminster to Jude's taste when he says, "As we be here in our bodies on this high ground, 3. Jude the Obscure, Wessex ed.

Similarly, the youth is heartened by the contrast of Dido's lament and "some old woman crying 'Two to-day, baker, and I return this stale one' " (34). A life-pattern characteristic of Romantic figures like Jude is that of the wanderer. Tennyson's Ulysses, for example, is forever denied a normal life in society by the vision that moves before him: all experience is an arch wherethrough Gleams that untraveled world whose margin fades Forever and forever when I move. (11. 19-21) Jude too is uprooted, but would not remain so. His spiritual and intellectual ideal is expressed in transcendental terms, but never could he own the desire To follow knowledge like a sinking star Beyond the utmost bound of human thought. (11. 31-32) One finds that Christminster University is not only a symbol, but a definite place which must be studied for, walked to, and entered. Or if the ideal cannot be grasped in this way, it may be found in the priesthood, or in union with Sue Bridehead. In spite of the scriptural imagery of boyhood, which describes a goal beyond nor- mal experience, as Jude matures we find his aims to be practical, familiar, and rather mundane. Yet this tangible university life which can be worked for and possessed in time retains all the old spiritual significance. What distinguishes his Romanticism, in other words, is the wish to realize spiritual vision in a quite limited way, incarnate in a physical place and actual society that will satisfy all his noblest desires.4 He clearly distinguishes matter and spirit in Marygreen, but wants to unite them in Christminster. Such compromise of the Romantic quest is unusual. A life which embodies the transcendental motive-that of Ulysses or the Mariner, Porphyro and Madeline or the Scholar-Gipsy-is almost always "open-ended," uncircumscribed by time and space. The rea- son is that the vision such figures pursue cannot be formally limited. Coextensive with no single object or activity, it is glimpsed but partially and for a moment. In other novels Hardy considers the frustration of seeking in women an embodiment of 4. "It had been the yearning of his heart to find something to anchor on, to cling to-for some place which he could call admirable" (24).</page><page sequence="4">Compromised Romanticism in Jude the Obscure 435 Romantic ideals: Angel Clare (Tess of the d'Urbervilles), Edred Fitzpiers (The Woodlanders), and Jocelyn Pierston (The Well- Beloved) all are blinded to the value of living persons by such artificial preconceptions. In Jude the Obscure the problem is viewed more broadly, as ideal and real contend in defining attitudes toward education, work, and marriage. Jude's initial conscious in- tention always seems the attainment of spiritual ideals, yet simul- taneously there is a need for realistic form. Both tendencies arise instinctively, the one from Jude's natural sensibility and imagina- tiveness, the other perhaps from a country person's affinity for concrete forms and processes. With his sense of the real and his desire to achieve a transcen- dental life of mind and spirit, Jude must seek an imaginative via media. Thus for some years he employs fantasies which offer much of the satisfaction of an incarnate, circumscribed ideal, while avoid- ing the disillusionment and loss of spiritual freedom that accom- pany engagement in real life. This can be seen on the night of his first arrival at Christminster: "he began to be encircled as it were with the breath and sentiment of the venerable city. When he passed objects out of harmony with its general expression he allowed his eyes to slip over them as if he did not see them" (91). He mentally peoples the city with the spirits of deceased genius, Ben Jonson, John Henry Newman, and others. The illusion proceeds until "Jude found himself speaking out loud, holding conversations with them" (94). This incident is brief, but it shows the pattern of Jude's "Romantic seeing." On a small foundation of fact he builds an imaginative edifice, a situation or relationship with strong emo- tional content.5 He rejects the artifact when he perceives its distance from reality, but until then it can serve as the desired embodiment of a dream. Thus about the schoolmaster to whom he is not "unromantically close" Jude sees an aura of scholarship, about Sue (his basis is the fact of her occupation) a halo of Anglican sanctity. A favorite method is to use physical nearness as the founda- tion for an imaginary situation, as when Jude, in the cathedral at Christminster, feels he is in communion with Sue and all she represents, although they have not met: "The girl for whom he was beginning to nourish an extraordinary tenderness was at this time 5. The phrase "the embroidery of imagination upon the stuff of nature" (54) is appropriate.</page><page sequence="5">436 Nineteenth-Century Fiction ensphered by the same harmonies as those which floated into his ears; and the thought was a delight to him" (107). "Thus he kept watch over her, and liked to feel she was there. The consciousness of her living presence stimulated him. But she remained more or less an ideal character, about whose form he began to weave curious and fantastic day-dreams" (104)." Jude's sensitivity to "living presences," his need for reality, leads to submission to physical nature. Only a far more thoroughgoing visionary could achieve the life of pure mind and spirit. He ignores certain premonitory lessons, such as on the evening during his preparation for Christminster when he is moved to chant Horace's Carmen Saeculare to the rising moon and setting sun. He repents, because the pagan song is inconsistent with the desire to be a Christian divine. The heart of the inconsistency is unre- marked, however. Horace's poem combines worship with a peti- tion for natural fertility and fruition: To pregnant wives give large increase, Let earth with corn and flock o'erspread, Weave yellow wreathes for Ceres' head. Let wholesome streams, sweet air and grassy food Cherish the herds.7 Hardy characteristically includes such reference to primitive fertility ritual as prelude to the distinctive triumph of natural forces. Examples are the Midsummer Eve rite in The Wood- landers, which precedes Fitzpiers' unforeseen tryst with Suke Damson, and the dance at Chaseborough Fair in Tess of the d'Urbervilles. In Jude's case the appeal of physical reality is too great for one who is only half dreamer. Arabella is "a complete and substantial female animal-no more, no less" (42). Her occupa- tion, the characteristic mode of first attracting Jude's attention, and later details like the grease-stained book covers, all emphasize her role in Jude's life. She epitomizes the antithesis of his Romantic dream, the insensitivity of nature. It was "as if materially, a com- pelling arm of extraordinary muscular power seized hold of him- something which had nothing in common with the spirits and 6.

This seemed to care little for his reason and will, nothing for his so-called elevated intentions" (48). Jude's first marriage to Arabella is more important for confirm- ing his Romanticism than for demolishing it, however. For the first time it becomes clear that his imagination is not a peripheral faculty, and that his transcendental longings will not be outgrown. Here, as before in Troutham's field, Jude's imagination causes as well as satisfies the wish for a better world. At the pig-killing, Arabella is attentive only to physical facts and their material con- sequences: "'There!' she cried, [after he spilled the blood] ... 'Now I can't make any blackpot'" (75). This perspective easily refers unexceptional phenomena to an inclusive process of life characterized by stolid physical necessity-"We always do it" (73). "Poor folks must live" (75). Jude's imagination, on the other hand, insists on the metaphysical aspect of the scene, and inference can only yield a vision of universal cruelty. It is "a dismal, sordid, ugly spectacle-to those who saw it as other than an ordinary obtaining of meat" (75). This is Jude's second intense rejection of conditions inherent in natural process. Soon he renews his quest: "There actually rose the faint halo ... hardly recognizable save by the eye of faith. It was enough for him" (86). The point here is that Jude's dream is essen- tial to his personality. It will not be defeated by reality. As the novel continues, however, it is clear that Jude's need for an incarnate ideal is also essential. His personality and career are determined by an ironic inability to maintain pure idealism: even while asserting the alienation of matter and spirit, at least regard- ing the sordid material life he has known, Jude seeks new things and persons that can assume idealistic character. Thus, as Christ- minster becomes more remote as a possessable incarnation of spirit, Sue begins to replace it in Jude's mind. This begins with fantasy, of course, since the conditions of reality-the sexual involvement of a religious married man with his cousin-are more frightening than ever. Sue appears not as a physical being at all, but as "a kindly star, an elevating power" (105). ". . . she appeared to him . . . living largely in vivid imaginings, so ethereal a creature that her spirit could be seen trembling through her limbs" (224). Sue's beliefs, unrealized as they are in her own actions, help Jude progress from satisfaction with the flimsiest of fantasies to an</page><page sequence="7">438 Nineteenth-Century Fiction acceptance of physical reality. These beliefs are summarized in Swinburne's Hymn to Proserpine, which Sue reads in her Christ- minster room: Not as thine, not as thine was our mother, a blossom of flowering seas, ........... ........................ p-.... -pp..... - ------.... For thine came pale as a maiden, and sister to sorrow; but ours, Her deep hair heavily laden with odor and color of flowers, White rose of the rose-white water, a silver splendor, a flame, Bent down unto us that besought her, and earth grew sweet with her name. (11. 78-84) These lines accord with Sue's "Grecian ideal" of sensuous beauty and immaterial value in perfect fusion, and deny the antagonism of flesh and spirit that plagues Jude. Sue has read much nineteenth century literature and assimilated much recurrent thought of the time. She believes in art whose "spiritual motive," according to Walter Pater, "is not lightly and loosely attached to the sensuous form ... but saturates and is identical with it." 8 Behind this aesthetic is the Romantic conviction that physical nature is spiritual (as will be remarked later, this "Romanticism" differs from the transcendentalist variety): I always see the garden and God there A-making man's wife: and, my lesson learned, The value and significance of flesh, I can't unlearn ten minutes afterward. (Browning, Fra Lippo Lippi, 11. 266-69) This is the sense of Sue's emotional insistence to Jude "that to ex- plain such verses as this: 'Whither is thy beloved gone, 0 thou fairest among women?' by the note: 'The Church professeth her faith,' is supremely ridiculous!" (183) Because it is so vague and fluid in his own mind, Jude's spiritual ideal cannot be clearly defined. It is evident, however, that in ac- cord with Sue's views he comes to believe that the attainment of this "better thing" may be conterminous with natural fulfillment. He rejects the Church precisely because of this new appreciation of the value of sexual union: "he saw one thing: that though his kiss of that aerial being had seemed the purest moment of his faultful life, as long as he nourished this unlicensed tenderness it was 8. "Winckelmann," The Renaissance, Modern Library ed. (New York, n.d.), p. 171.</page><page sequence="8">Compromised Romanticism in Jude the Obscure 439 glaringly inconsistent for him to pursue the idea of becoming the soldier and servant of a religion in which sexual love was regarded as at best a frailty, and at its worst damnation" (261). He is bitter at the faults of the institution he once honored, but feels no qualitative diminution in the new and complete incarnation of the ideal: "I am not to be one of The soldier-saints who, row on row Burn upward each to his point of bliss, if any such there be! My point of bliss is not upward, but here." (285) In spite of this change, Jude's Romantic fantasies are not wholly dispelled, as is clear after Sue leaves her husband for him. The fusion of matter and spirit required for an embodied ideal is now sought in the union of an "earthy," "gross," being-as Jude thinks of himself-with a "spirit" or "disembodied creature" (294, 312), the product being "almost the two parts of a single whole" (352). The human pair, in other words, is the desired incarnation, the marriage of opposed principles. Yet this is an abstract solution, a rationalization having no expression in Jude and Sue's chaste life together. According to the theory which Sue expounds and Jude accepts, immaterial reality is the essence, sexual love the form. But in the phrases just cited, the principles of pure spirit and matter reside in Sue and Jude respectively, and the action is one of contiguity rather than fusion. This odd conception suits the peculiar relationship which exists immediately after Sue leaves Phillotson for Jude. More importantly, it suggests that Jude again seeks emotional fulfillment in an imaginative edifice or scheme with scarcely any factual foundation. Not even after Arabella's visit and Sue's sexual surrender is fantasy at an end. To understand this part of the couple's career it is helpful to recall one of Jude's first images of Sue. The descriptive phrase used, "her spirit could be seen trembling through her limbs" (224), clearly is borrowed from Shelley's Epipsychidion: "her divinest presence trembles through/ Her limbs" (11. 78-79). Later, Sue asks Jude to say some "pretty lines" from the same poem, in confirmation of his assertion that she is a "sweet tantalizing phantom-hardly flesh at all." The lines describe Shelley's Emily, a figure much akin to Intellectual Beauty:</page><page sequence="9">440 Nineteenth-Century Fiction There was a Being whom my spirit oft Met on its visioned wanderings far aloft. "'Oh it is too flattering,'" says Sue, "'so I won't go onl But say it's me! Say it's me!' 'It is you, dear; exactly like youl'" (294) The central problem of Sue and Jude's life together is that they seem to identify with the characters and drama of Epipsychidion. Actually, the "plots" of the novel and poem have much in common. Shelley's speaker, like Jude, has long pursued a youthful vision of spiritual beauty, a "soul out of my soul." He vainly sought its realization in ''many mortal forms," wandering through "the wintry forest of our life." After he has married (a qualitatively different affair from Jude's match) the true embodiment finally appears, "Soft as an Incarnation of the Sun." Shelley has trouble here, because he is talking simultaneously about transcendental communion with In- tellectual Beauty and union with a mortal woman. The metaphor of "Twin Spheres of light" ruling a "passive Earth" works very well, but does not harmonize with the earlier Hardy-like diatribe against "the code/ Of modern morals" that forbids more than one object of love. Finally the speaker appeals to his spiritual-mortal companion to fly away with him, a "vestal sister" to his physical being, but a bride to his soul-they are to typify Sue's ideal relationship. The diffi- culty continues, however, for like Emily herself the island retreat is both realistic and transcendental; and the lovers' consummation, anticipated as a wedding of souls, is at once spiritual and intensely sexual. Apparently due to this, Shelley ends by implying that his couple did not attain their supernatural goal. "Woe is me!" says the lover, The winged words on which my soul would pierce Into the height of Love's rare Universe, Are chains of lead around its flight of fire. And the last thought is that love's reward "is in the world divine/ Which, if not here, it builds beyond the grave." 9 9. While believing Epipsychidion successful, David Perkins admits that the "coales- cence" of transcendent and concrete "can scarcely be maintained. If Emily is re- garded as Intellectual Beauty, the union with her would take the poet out of the natural world; if she is a 'mortal shape,' he must make a place for her in his hu- man life. The result is a disunity almost grotesque, with Shelley leaping from one side of the fence to the other."

On Hardy's use</page><page sequence="10">Compromised Romanticism in Jude the Obscure 441 At the heart of Sue and Jude's trouble is an attempt and failure very similar to that in Epipsychidion. All along, Jude has tended to compromise his transcendentalism, to seek embodiments of the ideal in things, people, and situations that have some connection with real life. This motive toward incarnation is most fulfilled in Sue's idea that sexual love is essentially spiritual. In fact, this con- cept implies allegiance to another kind of Romanticism, for the belief that physical nature is spiritual is not in accord with the idea that Life, like a dome of many-colored glass, Stains the white radiance of Eternity. (Adonais, 11.462-63) Jude and Sue claim to have adopted the thought of Keats's odes and the later literature they inspired, which find ultimate value in intense vitality, in natural fulfillment. A basic part of the Keatsian formula, however, is the acceptance of process and decay as in- evitable facts of existence. This the couple denies: although they have embraced reality, they still believe in their transcendence. They feel they are not subject to sickness, sorrow, and other condi- tions natural to the lives of more "conventional" people. With Shelley, they believe that the "soul that loves projects itself beyond the created world, and creates in the infinite a world all its own, very different from this obscure and fearful abyss." 10 Like the speaker of Epipsychidion, they try to ignore the inconsistencies of what might be called naturalistic transcendentalism, and thus do not see that they have become subject to the hazards of emotional and sexual interdependence, the education of children, and existence as a social unit within a larger social fabric. They have "forgotten what twenty-five centuries have taught the race" (358). Jude and Sue sustain their Romantic delusion at first by equat- ing legal marriage and spiritual limitation. The formal contract is the keystone of all evil, as is seen during the wedding service at Aldbrickham, when Sue easily turns Jude's description of the loss of Shelley, see Phyllis Bartlett, "'Seraph of Heaven': A Shelleyan Dream in Hardy's Fiction," PMLA 70 (1955): 624-35. Phyllis Bartlett finds Sue to be Shelleyan be- cause she desires a union solely of mind and spirit. She does not analyze the novel as a whole in terms of Shelley, however, nor does she comment much on Jude him- self. 10. The epigraph to Epipsychidion, trans.

The curse of existence is also reduced to the legend of a curse upon marriages in Sue and Jude's families-again, something that can be easily avoided. In reality, of course, the processes of nature are far more inclusive." The most trying sources of hardship are not local conventions, but illness, the birth of many children, and most significantly, Jude's restlessness. For as the irresistible power of nature becomes more evident, Jude again longs for the unattained ideal: the dream of Christminster recurs, and precipitates the great calamity. It is with powerful irony that Hardy expresses Jude's realization of necessity in a statement from the Agamemnon-"Things are as they are, and will be brought to their destined issue" (409)-for the ideal of "Greek joyousness" earlier symbolized the goal of Romantic transcendentalism. Yet even in their last terrible weeks together, and nearly to the end of Jude's life, the couple depends on fantasies to avoid fully recognizing some inexorable law of "mutual butchery." Unfortunately, their imaginations are no longer of one accord. Sue retains the anthropomorphism which once convinced her of nature's beneficence, and assumes that the death of her children was caused by a conscious agent, an angry God. This supposition of cosmic intellect and motive is a bulwark against chaos or unconscious necessity, and Sue therefore attempts to submit to conditions which, though evil and artificial, are or- dained by divine power. Her last imaginative creation is a morally ordered world, and to the God that governs it she sacrifices her free will. Jude too, though mocked by the vestiges of his early Christmin- ster dreams, still clings to an old fantasy. He will not accept the idea that a sensitive person's only response to existence must be total repudiation, a wish never to have lived. Before their trouble really began, Sue said that this would be the sentiment of the fu- ture; and of course "Father Time" is a prototype. Yet on his death- bed, Jude recalls the fiction that local conventions are the only 11. On one level Jude does disparage formal marriage, for in spite of Hardy's pro- testation to the contrary (Life, p. 271), not all the antinuptial sentiments occur in dialogue. (Would it make a difference if they did?) See p. 357, for example. Also there is Jude and Arabella's amusing landlord, who "doubted if they were married at all, especially as he had seen Arabella kiss Jude one evening" (p. 465). Still, the more significant function of marriage is as part of Sue and Jude's delusion. Their almost paranoiac dread of the legal document itself suggests that they have made it the equivalent of a far larger reality.</page><page sequence="12">Compromised Romanticism in Jude the Obscure 443 bane, and implies that when men gain social mobility and the allowance to love as they choose, his lifelong dreams will be realized: "when our minds were clear, and our love of truth fear- less-the time was not ripe for us! Our ideas were fifty years too soon to be any good to us. And so the resistance they met brought reaction in her, and ruin on me!" (484) At the last, Jude loses hope without gaining understanding: Christminster is a mocking irony and Sue is "defiled," ruined as a spiritual entity by her surrender of freedom and will. Ever in need of an embodied vision, Jude is helpless. His dying wish, to have rested forever in darkness, repudiates an entire life in search of the City of Light. Like Sue in her abdication, he destroys his essential self. In its study of the difficulties and dangers of creating satisfactory substitutes for reality, Jude the Obscure evaluates the practical worth of Romanticism. In an intensely realized poetic vision, the imagination can radically transform the world. We accept this apotheosis, though obviously in a different way than we accept scientific proofs. But in order for Romanticism to be applicable to daily life, as Jude tries to make it, imaginative and physical truth must coincide. It is this that makes Jude "compromise" Romanti- cism by seeking limited, concrete, embodiments of his ideals. He thinks he reconstitutes the world, while in fact he only creates substitutes, and reality remains intractable. More than private faith is needed to make the imagination effective in the realm of fact. John Holloway cites "continuity with environment" as the necessary condition for successful life in Hardy's world. One must adapt himself to a complex of traditional relationships with nature and other persons, and not pursue private material ends, passions, or ideals. In Jude the Obscure, a self-generated, and therefore false, vision arises from a misevaluation of the character and power of the Romantic imagination.12 12.
