This is, in part, because the regulatory sci ence and sociology of expertise that inform policymaking can exacer bate a preconceived separation between humans and other beings. This article begins by exploring the limits and inadequacies of cur rent agricultural policy through an analysis of the antimicrobial politics of food safety, from the creation of organic compost to ar tisanal cheeses. Next, it considers the shortcomings of natural re sources policy in light of another set of emerging human-nonhuman relationships: the reemergence of wolves in Wisconsin. These case studies are useful for rethinking how policymaking should focus more on relationships between people and nature and less on individ ual human agency and exclusive, separate elements such as an en dangered species or pathenogenic microbes. Lastly, this article concludes by describing possible natural resources policy attributes conducive to building and creating new relationships of stewardship and sustainability. I. INTRODUCTION: MICROBES AS AN EMERGING NATURAL RESOURCE A flood of new information about microbial life, generated during the past decade by advances in genetics research and information tech nologies, has opened up new possibilities for industry and offered a fun damental rethinking of some of our most basic ideas regarding species, organisms, and evolution. New lab technologies have allowed scientists to move beyond isolated explorations of single, cultured microbes to be ing able to analyze the collective genomes of thousands of microorga * Mrill Ingram is a geographer based at the University of Wisconsin where she pursues research on human-environmental relationships.

Scientific research on microbial behavior reveals that individual microbes of the same species can exhibit quite different behaviors and that microbes communicate and respond to environmental conditions in complex ways.1 In this section, a brief summary of some of the new microbial science and its implications is provided. Also discussed is food-safety legislation and practices that have emerged in the wake of a number of large-scale food illness out breaks caused by microbial contamination of food as well as a contradic tion between new science about microbes and existing agricultural policy. Current agricultural policy is dominated by a "command-and control" approach to human-microbial relationships; however, actual control over microbes is proving an elusive goal. The ability of microbes to evolve rapidly makes controlling them a challenge, and, as is dis cussed in the following section, efforts to exert control run counter to many sustainable agricultural practices and may actually compound problems.2 Microbes form heterogeneous assemblages of different species called biofilms. Biofilms represent a prevalent mode of microbial life and involve a shift in both the physiology of individual cells and also in the behavior of those cells. "We liken the multispecies bacterial biofilm to a city where bacteria settle selectively, limit settlements of new bacteria, store energy . . . and transfer genetic material horizontally all for the good of the many," state researchers Watnick and Kolter.3 These biofilms have been discovered on a wide array of natural and human-made sur faces including human skin, the surface of the ocean, hot springs, water pipes, and teeth. The nature of these microbial communities is inspiring a rethinking of long-held notions about life's processes and organization. Scientists have observed microbes communally discarding and absorb ing genes as needed, in response to changes in their environment. This "horizontal gene transfer," the non-genealogical transfer of genetic mate rial from one organism to another, explains the rapid development of 1.

For example, the human forearm has been found to harbor some of the most diverse assemblages of microbial species anywhere on the body.5 The human gut has "indigenous" microbes that researchers believe play a positive role in intestinal health, but some of these microbes have disap peared due to the widespread use of antibiotics. Other types are associ ated with lower rates of asthma in children.6 Pharmaceutical and other industries are watching these developments carefully, banking on com mercial technologies relating to everything from treatments of bacterial infections, to environmental cleanup and energy production.7 Reading the pages of scientific publications and the mainstream press detailing these remarkable discoveries and their implications, one might be led to anticipate a growing appreciation for microbial diversity 4.

'Survival of the fittest' literally implies that there can only be one winner from the forces of selection, whereas in a communal world, the entire distributed community benefits . . . The most general sense in which we mean competition ... is the complex dynamical rearrange ment of the community structure.

There are certainly calls for a shift in discourse and practice;8 however, a tolerant view of microbes has been challenged by recent food-related illnesses. Furthermore, many U.S. policies related to managing microbes in agricultural production reveal a dominant antimi crobial and command-and-control approach, with broad implications for agricultural practice.9 Although new restrictions on the indiscriminant use of prophylactic antibiotics in meat and egg production have emerged,10 antibiotic drug use continues to be routine in spite of increas ing evidence of the spread of antibiotic resistance in animals, people— especially farm workers—and even soil. In fact, increased concern over food safety in recent years has encouraged new policies and manage ment practices that actually discourage microbial diversity and fly in the face of longstanding sustainable agricultural practices.11 II.

COLI 375 reflection of an increasingly concentrated industrial food production sys tem. Our troubled food production system and concerns over public health and food-related illness have led to new "clean farming" practices, which ironically run directly counter to farming practices developed by sustainable farmers with human health and the larger healthy function ing of the food production system in mind. In this Part, food-safety regu lation is examined in terms of sustainable farming practices and food safety risks. This new regulation ignores existing beneficial human-mi crobial relationships with unfair implications for the people most inti mately involved. These regulatory relationships affect everything from farmers working to create compost to nourish organic crop fields to growing produce in a way that minimizes synthetic chemical use and even the methods for producing a variety of specialty cheeses. The extremely dangerous, sometimes lethal, 0157:H7 strain of the common Escherichia coli (£. coli) bacteria was found in Nestlé Toll House refrigerated cookie dough made in Virginia in June 2009 after 72 people in 30 states were sickened. In October of 2008, salmonella bacteria in pea nut butter from a Peanut Corp. of America plant in Georgia killed nine people, and an estimated 22,500 became ill. Some of these outbreaks have occurred from contaminated fresh produce, implicating practices in the field as well as food processing. In June 2008, salmonella on serrano peppers grown in Mexico sickened over 1,000 people in 41 states, with 203 reported hospitalizations and at least one death. Dole bagged spin ach processed at Earthbound Farms in California was contaminated by E. coli 0157:H7 in September 2006. The outbreak killed four people, sent 103 to hospitals, and devastated the spinach industry.12 A. Scorched Earth Farm Policies In direct response to the increasing number of large-scale food safety illness outbreaks during this decade, the U.S. Department of Agri culture (USDA) and a number of commercial vegetable producer organi zations and buyers are creating new guidelines to minimize the possibility of bacterial contamination of field crops. These "Good Agri cultural Practices" require farmers to remove vegetative buffers along waterways and around organic crop fields and to eliminate hedgerows, ponds, and other places that might harbor E. co/z'-spreading wildlife.13 12.

Farmers following these guidelines report poisoned wildlife being eaten by hawks and other birds of prey, who then become sick themselves.14 Consumer concern about the safety of food can be a formidable political force. In the 1990s, U.S. consumer groups were very active in changing a recalcitrant food system to include regulation for the produc tion of organic foods, which many consumers saw as a healthier alterna tive to the existing industrial paradigm.15 In an ironic twist on this concern, practices designed to protect wildlife and promote biodiversity, with the end goal of producing healthier crops in a more sustainable manner, are now considered food-safety risks.16 Organic farmers, for ex ample, aim to create a biodiverse farm system and to avoid synthetic fertilizer and pest-control inputs by exploiting natural relationships be tween microbes, insects, plants, and animals to create fertile soil, to man age weeds and pests, and to produce bountiful, nutritious crops.17 However, under the USDA's National Organic Program, organic farmers are required to pursue practices such as planting hedgerows and vegeta tive buffers to minimize soil erosion, provide refuge for beneficial in sects, and increase farm biodiversity.18 All these practices can now be viewed as potential sources of bacterial contamination of crops. 2006, available at http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/Product-SpecificInformation/ FruitsVegetablesJuices/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/ucml68630.htm (last visited Sept. 19, 2010). 14.

COLI 3 77 Fears over food safety in crop production are also challenging sus tainable agriculture by producing legislative proposals that eclipse hard won distinctions between conventional agriculture and organic and other alternative growing practices. Organic farmers are wondering how a new food-safety law might affect the National Organic Program's re quirements for cover crops, intercropping, vegetative buffers, and other practices fundamental to farming systems based on managing interspe cies relationships and promoting biodiversity. For instance, the Food Safety Enhancement Act of 2009, passed by the House of Representatives in July of 200919, authorizes the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to promulgate wide-ranging regulations to "ensure the safety of the na tion's food supply."20 A similar bill, the F.D.A. Food Safety Moderniza tion Act, was overwhelmingly approved by the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee in November 2010.21 Farmer advocates have voiced concerns about record-keeping and surveillance requirements, as well as the types of marketing arrangements that may ensue from the law, all of which can create disadvantages for smaller scale and direct-market farmers.22 B. Limits on Organic Compost Another example of how antimicrobial attitudes affect environ mental policy and limit the practices of organic farmers is the rule for the use of compost in the USDA's National Organic Program. The rule re quires that farmers follow specific guidelines for producing and using compost. These requirements, informed by existing federal agency guidelines on municipal compost production rather than by organic agri cultural tradition, lay out a very specific definition of proper compost. For example, the compost guidelines detail temperatures reached and the number of times the compost must be turned.23 The results provide 19.

Furthermore, the guidelines are scale-insensitive and place addi tional burdens on smaller organic farmers who must keep paperwork and invest in compost pile-turning technologies in order to produce "cer tified" compost.24 C. A Case Study on the Food-Safety Regulatory Limits on Artisan Cheese If the idea of defending technologies that promote a diversity of microbial life seems to be an unnecessary flirtation with risk, it might be useful to consider the regulation of a different product of human-micro bial relationships: cheese. In recent decades, artisan cheesemaking has blossomed in the United States and has provided critical cultural and economic opportunities in a climate that is otherwise extremely difficult for small producers.25 Many of these artisan cheesemakers use unpas teurized milk, also known as raw milk. In the United States, these pro ducers have never been able to legally engage in interstate commerce of traditional raw-milk cheeses such as Camembert, but many make their own popular raw-milk cheeses, including ones styled on cheddar, em mentaler, gruyère, morbier, parmigiano-reggiano, pecorino romano, reblochon, tomme de Savoie, and Vermont shepherd. The artisan cheese industry, virtually absent in the United States until the last 20 to 30 years, is now supporting a diversity of farmers across the country.26 In attempting to control illness outbreaks associated with milk, however, the U.S. food-safety command-and-control approach threatens to ban all raw-milk cheese. A comparison of different regulatory ap proaches to cheese production reveals that U.S. regulations, in contrast to the European Union (E.U.) policies, place limits on agricultural practice 24.

Artisan, or farmstead, cheese production has increased significantly in the United States to almost 900 million pounds in 2006. There does not appear to be any reliable data on the number, size, or ownership of artisan cheese producing facilities, and it is not un likely that, as the specialty cheese market grows, larger dairies may be increasingly moving into what was a dominantly small farm enterprise. However, according to a report pro duced by the California Milk Advisory Board, specialty cheese consumption, produced by at least 350 different farms in that state alone, increased 94 percent between 1994 and 2003, for a value of $6.4 billion in 2003, available at http://www.allbusiness.com/food-beverage/ food-industry-dairy-dairy-products/5542373-l.html (last visited Aug. 4, 2010).</page><page sequence="9">Spring 2010] KEEPING UP WITH THE E. COLI 379 that inhibit the creation of products that many people value highly for economic, cultural, and health reasons. In the United States, the interstate commerce of raw milk was reg ulated in 1949 but the use of raw milk in cheese was not regulated until 1979, at which point the requirement was established that if a cheese is made with unpasteurized milk, it must be aged for 60 days at tempera tures not less than 35 degrees Fahrenheit.27 Advocates of artisan cheese argue strongly that milk, as the essential ingredient in cheese, must be extremely fresh, from healthy, well-fed cows, and unpasteurized. They contend that pasteurized milk negatively impacts the taste and texture of cheese,28 and point to peer-reviewed science to argue that pasteurized milk cheese presents its own risks. Pasteurization, they claim, destroys enzymes in raw milk that aid digestion of sugars, fats, and minerals in the milk and other foods, as well as a cortisone factor that can help con trol allergies.29 There is ongoing disagreement in the United States about the safety of human consumption of raw-milk cheeses, however, and the federal government regularly entertains a complete raw-milk cheese ban.30 In contrast, legislation in countries in the E.U. allows raw milk in cheese production as long as producers comply with self-controls based on the system of hazard analysis and control points. The regulations in both the United States and the E.U. are backed by plenty of peer-re viewed science, but the E.U. also considers "social factors" such as con sumer demand, cultural expression, and economic opportunity.31 The sale of raw-milk cheeses in Europe has been valued at $7 billion annually. The efficacy of U.S. food-safety regulations in preventing food illness outbreaks remains to be seen, but this case study reveals how 27. 21 C.F.R. §§ 133.150,133.182,133.187 all refer to the production of various cheeses, and create a 60-day aging requirements for raw-milk cheese. For example, 133.150(d) states: "If the milk used is not pasteurized, the cheese so made is cured at a temperature of not less than 35 [degrees Fahrenheit] for not less than 60 days." 28. Burkhard Bilger, Raw Faith: The Nun and the Cheese Underground, New Yorker, Aug. 19, 2002, at 150.

Community legislation has on a num ber of occasions recognised that other factors, in particular consumer needs and concerns, must also be taken into consideration during the decision-making process."</page><page sequence="10">380 NATURAL RESOURCES JOURNAL [Vol. 50 these policies can detrimentally and unfairly burden artisan farmers. In contrast to artisan producers, industrial cheese producers' concern is not the highest quality milk, but an assured, plentiful supply of affordable milk that is safe for human consumption even if it has traveled many miles to a cheesemaking plant. While pasteurization is a good way to accomplish this, as a mandatory requirement for cheesemaking, the pro cess shuts out a whole economic and cultural world of cheese production. The human health threats of pathenogenic microbes are very real; we want to be extremely careful in how we manage human-microbial relationships. Medical and ecological science question the design of agri cultural policies that indiscriminately minimize the diversity as well as the number of bacteria in our food system. Misuse of antibiotic drugs can produce more virulent strains of the microbes they were designed to eliminate, and removing vegetative buffers in crop fields also removes beneficial insects and invites an increase in soil erosion and water quality issues. It is not clear that these kinds of regulations will make our food system any safer, but it is clear that these policies have immediate ineq uitable implications for farmers pursuing diverse, sustainable produc tion and for smaller-scale growers who must take on additional record keeping and surveillance technologies. What is circumscribed by current food-safety policy is not only the existence of a particular microbe, but productive, negotiated relation ships between humans and nonhumans worked out over time. The agri cultural policies described above create an idea of risk such that a whole range of possible positive human-nonhuman interactions are precluded, and with the additional negative result that more people are excluded from practices that involve working with a diversity of nonhuman orga nisms. As demonstrated above, these practices affect the production of specialty cheeses and organic compost to nourish crop fields as well as produce grown in such a way to minimize synthetic chemical use and to protect water quality. III. THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT AND WOLVES IN WISCONSIN While these discussions over the pros and cons of relationships with invisible bodies may seem specialized, there are parallels in natural resource policy regarding relationships between people and other types of nonhumans. Protection of wolves under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) for the last 36 years has been remarkably effective in the upper Midwest. Thanks to the ESA, the subspecies eastern timber wolf (later reclassified as the gray wolf) was protected beginning in 1974 and has staged an impressive comeback, especially in northern Minnesota where</page><page sequence="11">Spring 2010] KEEPING UP WITH THE E. COLI 381 they were never totally extirpated. For most of the places in Wisconsin that wolves inhabit, they have only returned in the last one to two de cades, however, and they are returning to a landscape utterly changed from that previously inhabited by their ancestors. Thus, new relation ships have emerged between wolves and their environment, much of which now includes people. These relationships range from positive ones, if people experience a healthier forest ecosystem with more flowers in the woods and fish in the streams, and fewer deer on the roads, to negative relationships, as people repeatedly lose livestock, have to pay for fencing or other types of protection, or lose a beloved pet. As one might expect, this process of developing strategies for coexistence re quires investment, such as providing people with opportunities for edu cation, positive interactions, and a feeling of control and participation in the development of management plans. As will be discussed in this Part, endangered species policy can create barriers to this process by relying on thresholds that are not ecologically defensible, and by perpetuating static notions of nonhuman behavior. A state bounty on wolves existed in Wisconsin from 1865 until 1957. Because of this bounty, by 1900, wolves had disappeared from southern Wisconsin, and by 1950, less than 50 wolves remained, living in the extreme northern part of the state. In 1957, wolves were listed as a protected species, but the wolf population was down to a handful of wolves, and in 1960 it was considered extinct.32 Grey wolves were reclassified from endangered to threatened in Minnesota in 1978, and Minnesota has likely been the source for wolves subsequently moving into northern Wisconsin. The wolf was moved to threatened status in Wisconsin in 1999, when the state's wolf number reached 200. At that point, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Re sources settled on a goal of a minimum of 350 wolves for further delist ing "as a reasonable first attempt at assessment of social tolerance."33 However, a number of subsequent rulings over the past few years by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) to delist the wolf have been fol lowed by challenges from environmental groups and animal rights groups opposed to wolf hunts, calling for a reinstatement of ESA protec tions. Most recently, in September of 2009, the USFWS moved to rein 32. Recovery of Gray Wolves in the Great Lakes Region of the United States: An Endangered Species Success Story (Adrain P.

The area was not considered prime wolf real estate, in part because, while not densely populated by humans, it is crisscrossed by roads and cut off from the wilder, northern forests of the state by a wide belt of land intensively managed for agri culture. Since 2000, however, CFR wolves have thrived, increasingly in habiting areas near humans. One pack's territory abuts the city of Wisconsin Rapids, which has a population of about 20,000 people. Other packs have regular rendezvous sites within view of workers in cranberry beds.35 The presence of wolves in Wisconsin generates a whole gamut of responses, reflected in controversies generated by efforts to delist the grey wolf and to create post-delisting management. Bear hunters who use hunting dogs are a small but very vocal group, concerned over the potential loss of their dogs to wolves. Some people who live near wolves hold some of the more negative attitudes toward the animals because they more frequently suffer from losses of livestock or pets as a result of the proximity. As a result, wildlife managers in the area tend to empha size the need for lethal as well as nonlethal approaches to "wolf-human" conflicts in order to avoid losing public support.36 Other residents of ar eas with wolves have different attitudes. The Ojibwe people, who have tribal reservations in northern Wisconsin, traditionally view the wolf, Ma'iingan, as a brother. For an Ojibwe person, therefore, occasional con flict with a wolf is as natural, and about as significant, as occasional dis agreements with a brother, and likewise, consider lethal control as fratricide.37 The Endangered Species Act is generally regarded as a great suc cess in bringing wolves back to Wisconsin. The ESA has clearly done its job in protecting gray wolves and allowing the animals to return to many areas in the state. At this point, however, a more finely tuned process is necessary to assist people in negotiating different attitudes toward wolves and to come to agreements about how humans and wolves can coexist.

As research on public attitudes and wildlife conflicts reveals, participatory processes are needed where people can be involved in a whole range of activities, including sharing points of view, brainstorm ing solutions, developing feasible strategies, and monitoring wildlife.40 Furthermore, when people on the front lines of human-nonhuman inter actions are not involved in policymaking, results can be counterproduc tive and inequitable.41 Wolf numbers in the upper Midwest have increased to a level that many never anticipated.

Long-held notions of wolves as the epitome of the wild have to be refigured when their geographies become so tightly knitted with human ones. How might a rural wolf, one that comes into regular contact with humans and their property, differ from a wild wolf that lives in the middle of a large wilderness area? For most Wisconsin people—the Ojibwe are certainly one excep tion—their contact with wolves has a short history. Biological and eco logical information about wolves, while a critical part of what we need to know to coexist, needs to be accompanied by stories from people who successfully live with wolves and by opportunities to devise new strate gies for coexistence, whether it is a new livestock protection device or a new form of ecotourism. Thus, a critical piece of a species recovery plan is the socio-cultural context that shapes behavior of wolves and of people as well. IV. FOCUSING ON HUMAN-NATURE RELATIONSHIPS IN NATURAL RESOURCES POLICY Ongoing policy guidance is needed for these unfolding relation ships between humans and wolves in Wisconsin, including supplement ing ecological thresholds in policy with tools that support ongoing management of complex and changeable phenomena. In other words, natural resources policy must also attend to the diverse and complex net works linking humans and the nonhuman species that share the world. Attending to these networks involves appreciating and nurturing ex isting networks, as E.U. food-safety policy does with traditional artisan cheesemakers, for example. Policy attention to human-nonhuman net works also involves fostering new relationships where there are few or predominantly negative ones. In Wisconsin, for instance, the state De partment of Natural Resources for years recruited and trained volunteers from across the state to assist in annual wolf counts.43 In addition, envi ronmental management tools attuned to dynamic ecologies are needed in order to educate people and support participatory conservation plan ning such that people with existing relationships with a natural resource can be heard and become involved in strategizing. 42.

COLI 385 Barriers in natural resources policy to participatory management arise, in part, from the sociology of expertise, in which information cre ated by impartial scientific experts is valued at the exclusion of input from lay people who may not have scientific knowledge of nonhuman beings but have relationships that connect them to these species in other ways. A corollary condition is that, by relying on scientific experts, we also fail to support the continued creation of on-the-ground knowledge and relationship-building by people engaged in various ways of manag ing and making a living in a community. It has often been observed that local sources of knowledge reveal critical information about natural re sources, and that participation in environmental management planning is critical for long term success of any program.44 Ultimately, limited no tions of nonhuman agency (agency being the capacity for humans to make choices and impose those choices on the world) and human-non human relationships may be at the root of the shortcomings of natural resources policy to recognize and build networks between humans and nonhumans. As will be discussed in the following section, this issue stems in part from a combination of a strong idea of individual human agency as independent of a natural world, and a rather weak sense of agency on the part of nonhuman beings such that their behavior can be easily captured in general descriptions of "species" and "thresholds" and controlled through top-down policies. The ESA has been an effective and necessary instrument for wolf recovery. Holly Doremus, who has written extensively about the use of science in the ESA, has written about the law's "strictly science" mandate in order to prevent economic information about the costs of protection from being included in decisions about whether or not a species is en dangered. The mandate renders the law quite limited in terms of guiding a complicated and multidimensional process of negotiation.45 44. See Treves et al., supra note 40, at 1585, in which, regarding participation in conser vation planning, the authors note that "[p]otential benefits include the generation of di verse ideas: participation in decision making may raise tolerance for wildlife or management even in the absence of measurable reductions in threats; participants may offer help to implement or monitor interventions; and participants may gain skills in nego tiation, democracy, and coalition building . . . our method for strategic choice of interven tions based on feasibility requires local knowledge, scientific judgments, and broader sociopolitical experiences. Thus we caution against centralized, rigid, technocratic scoring systems that replace intuition and informal knowledge;" see also Lejano &amp; Ingram, supra note 41. 45. Holly Doremus, Listing Decisions Under the Endangered Species Act: Why Better Sci ence Isn't Always Better Policy, 75 Wash. U. L.Q. 1029, 1056 (1997) (noting that "the reliance on science is, historically, the result of people trying to protect the dilution of the ESA by information regarding the economic and social costs of protecting species"). Doremus also writes: "If society asked which plants were generally preferable, responses would vary</page><page sequence="16">386 NATURAL RESOURCES JOURNAL [Vol. 50 Another take on the inadequacy of the strictly science mandate is the argument that the regulatory biological science that sets thresholds in natural resources law is not truly up to the task of supplying critical in formation needed for effective environmental management.46 Laws rely on clear, predictable, and fair indicators that can be equitable and practi cal to enforce; thresholds provide managers with a critical foundation for clearly defining, for example, a number of species below which their pro tection is absolute. But given the dynamic and multifaceted nature of nature, this is just a starting place. Once legal protection of a species or an area is established, managers need to assess multiple indicators in an ongoing manner. The dynamics between population levels of deer and wolves may differ dramatically between different locations, for example, or vary from year to year depending on climate shifts. In addition, human or social factors are almost always critical not only in the decision of where to set a threshold, but also to changing the level of an indicator itself. The need to monitor the number of human-caused wolf deaths is just one example. In the raw-milk cheese controversy, the existence of a well-estab lished culture of cheesemakers and cheese consumers in France had a major role in creating advocates to inform a policy that is much more sensitive to traditional practices and human-microbial relationships. U.S. organic agriculture offers another example, where early proponents de veloped and advocated for practices that involve working with diverse microbes, plants, and animals, and taking advantage of natural with the respondents' views of the values provided by plants. The question calls for a weighing of incommensurables, comparing beauty, productivity and other features, which cannot be performed on a wholly objective basis. It calls for a value judgment, not a scien tific evaluation." Id. at 1065.

COLI 387 processes, knowledge that was critical in informing recent legislation on organic farming practices.47 In addition, regulatory science is often not disposed to forecast possible relationships between humans and other species. Traditional bi ological science can create very static definitions of species behavior that is perhaps less useful in imagining possible new scenarios for inter-spe cies interactions.48 V. RETHINKING INDIVIDUAL AGENCY IN POLICY Our liberal humanist tradition views agency as held exclusively by humans, related to Lockean notions of the human individual, inalien able rights, and entitlements. Since the Enlightenment, we have banked on the argument that humans are an exception in the animal kingdom, separated from other animals by our own sense of cognition and individ uality, along with other elements including tool use, cultural gesture, friendship, cooperation, a sense of history, of suffering, and so on. This exceptionalism is the basis of how we can have agency and rights to life and liberty and nonhuman beings do not. After years of animal research, every one of these exceptional ele ments has been scientifically shown to be more a difference of degree and not kind.49 In addition, the general post-modern movement, exem 47. See Ingram &amp; Ingram, supra note 15, noting that, "U.S. organic agriculture offers another example, where early proponents developed and advocated for practices that in volve working with diverse microbes, plants, and animals, and taking advantage of natural processes, knowledge which was critical in informing recent legislation on organic farming practices." 48. See Elliot Sober, Comparative Psychology Meets Evolutionary Biology, in Thinking with Animals: New Perspectives on Anthropomorphism, 85 (2005), in which he notes that "[anthropomorphism is defined as the error of attributing human mental characteristics to nonhuman organisms; people are said to fall into this error because they are sentimental and uncritical. It is a revealing fact about current scientific culture that the opposite mis take—of mistakenly refusing to attribute human mental characteristics to nonhuman orga nisms—does not even have a ready name"; see also Gregg Mitman, Pachyderm Personalities, in Thinking with Animals: New Perspectives on Anthropomorphism, 176, 193 (2005), who explains that, in a situation that highlights situations in which scientific assessments of species numbers and detached descriptions of behavior are not enough, different tech niques can be used by scientist-conservationists in order to bring attention to endangered elephants. "Unlike other areas of science and public policy, the authority and expertise of scientist-activists like Douglas-Hamilton and Moss among politicians and the general pub lic derives not from their detachment but from their long years of intimate associations with elephants in the wild." Furthermore, "[t]rading upon intimacy, individuals, and emo tions, scientist-activists like Douglas-Hamilton and Moss have found themselves and the elephants they live with active participants in and beneficiaries of celebrity culture." 49. This has led, in some cases, for some to argue that our system of rights should be extended to animals, as reflected in the work of Peter Singer and Martha Nussbaum, for</page><page sequence="18">388 NATURAL RESOURCES JOURNAL [Vol. 50 plified by philosophers such as Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, and Gilles Deleuze has variously de-centered the individual self, emphasiz ing the societal, contextual relationships that shape and define actions, desires, and power. The general message is that we have been so focused on the idea of the human as based in a rational individuality that we have ignored the relationships that shape us as human beings. Feminist writers including Donna Harraway and Carol Adams have added to this discussion from a different direction, arguing that liberal humanist (and patriarchal) traditions of thought have been a mis representation of the reality of human society, especially as these tradi tions have failed to acknowledge the multiple relations of reproduction that enable and create any single individuality. In sum, they argue, we have never been human—as is defined in conventional humanist tradi tions—and have no desire to be. Philosopher Alva Noe has similarly ar gued that the form of individual is not the only form of being, and that what we think of as our individual selves is the result of our intercon nectedness and relatedness to the rest of the world.50 This de-centering of the individual is accompanied, therefore, with a strong focus on relationships between humans, things, and other beings. Karen Barad offers "posthumanist performativity" as a way to rethink what she sees as passive constructions of nonhumans and things. "Agency is not aligned with human intentionality . . . Agency is a mat ter of intra-acting; it is an enactment, not something that someone or something has . . . [it] is not an attribute whatsoever."51 The idea of example. While this is an obvious trajectory, it is also one that can descend into rather unfortunate questions such as whether this extension would include the right of the an thrax virus to exist. My point here, however, is not to argue for animal rights on par with human rights but to argue for less attention to individual rights of any being, with a focus on the network of relationships that define a being as a resource or a user of that resource. 50. See Christine Smallwood, Backtalk: Alva Noe, The Nation, Mar. 16, 2009, in which, when asked about human relationships with other species, Alva Noe stated: "The classical picture of our human predicament is that we're all interiority . . . we're trapped inside the caverns of our one conscious mind. I'm offering a different picture, where the world and the others around us come first, and we are spread out and plugged in and implicated. Think of a row of bushes: each bush is interwoven with the other bushes, the roots reach down into the ground and entangle with each other. The picture that emerges is we're at home in the world, we're of the world, the world is not a projection or this alien thing, just as other people are not just merely acting bodies but are present for us as meaningful and important. The natural extension of that is to acknowledge that the species boundary is not a particularly special boundary." 51.

COLI 389 agency as emergent suggests that we might productively focus on the relationships between humans and nonhumans and things. Bruno Latour's work on actor-networks, developed with col leagues including Michael Callon, Michael Serres, and John Law, has much to offer here.52 Actor-networks were devised to "reconnect the so cial," a way of comprehending and opening up for study the heterogene ous assemblages of people, animals, and things that are variously connected as a result of social activity. The actors in actor-networks can be microbes, scallops, rocks—any entity that can galvanize activity and interaction. Thus, microbes and cheesemakers associate in a network to produce cheese. Wolves and Wisconsin deer hunters create a common network by their shared geographies of prey. Although their agency is not equivalent, both actors are equally capable of (more or less) predict able action. What actor-networks invite us to do, as we consider natural re sources policy, is to complement preconceptions about "natural" behav ior, with attention to context in order to understand the actions of any particular species or natural resource. Actor-networks relieve us of di chotomies like natural and human, or wild and tame, and invite focused research to explain the behavior of any actor as it is the result not only of anticipated biologically correct behavior but also arising from a situated time and place and interactions with other actors in a network. Thus we might expect different behavior from wolves in Yellowstone and wolves in the central forested region of Wisconsin. Because every actor is under stood to have agency, this approach has the potential to open up strate gies for new relationships by complementing the anticipated behaviors as defined by "species" with openness to unknown associations. Impor tantly, these possibilities for unanticipated behavior and relationships do not mean that we cannot foresee how patterns of equity might play out across different networks. Along with identifying actors in a network, a critical piece of policymaking is analyzing how different policies change relationships such that some groups may be less privileged than others. VI. NEGOTIATING COEXISTENCE Jumping in and out of concepts like "agency" and "individual" can seem like intellectual joyriding—and not always apparently useful in making policy. But a focus on relationship-building between humans and nonhuman species could complement policy like the Endangered Species Act. The ESA has had real success in protecting some 52.

More than eight years ago, Joseph Sax described a shift in envi ronmental law from an "enclave theory of conservation" to a focus on habitat as people realized that species needed to be saved "where they are."54 This shift involved planning for species protection with a whole complex of different interests, and Professor Sax wondered at the time whether we might see new institutional arrangements and a "withering away" of old political boundaries. Certainly, the last decade has not wit nessed a move away from political entrenchment. Yet, given the chal lenges of building new networks where there are none, as in the case of reintroduced wolves into Wisconsin, and of reconfiguring relationships when networks are restricting, as in the case of indiscriminant antimicro bial attitudes informing food-safety policy, we might continue to be hopeful for creating new ways of coexisting. The stories related here about microbes and wolves emphasize, as Professor Sax did, the need to restore not just species, but whole land scapes involving networks of relationships that include humans,55 a core belief of the ecological restoration effort.56 But these are not simple tasks, and are not easily generalized from one place to another. Much of this kind of negotiating, when it happens, is the result of people committed to a place, and who are willing to give and take.57 53. Holly Doremus &amp; A.

The film treats both humans and nonhumans as cultural groups that share a long history of living together and shows how both struggle in the context of forces beyond their control, specifically global climate change, which is reducing the amount of rainfall in the area, and international agreements on national parks boundaries, which have restricted the movement of these traditionally nomadic cultures.

COLI 391 Policy needs to foster a middle landscape, somewhere between relationships of extraction and relationships of total conservation. As noted, regulatory science does not always serve us well as an exclusive source of information about relationships between humans and other species. First, this is because of traditions in biological sciences that pro duce conservative and generalized descriptions of species behavior. Sec ond, while information from regulatory science is a necessary ingredient, it is not sufficient for informing and inspiring stewardship networks on the ground. This is not at all an attack on the process of science, which has served us well and has an ongoing critical role in helping to deter mine the "success" of restoration and conservation efforts, as well as helping inform how monitoring might be used to inform new strate gies.58 But regulatory science should be accompanied by other sources of knowledge—the legitimacy of which may not lie in objectivity—such as personal know-how, duration of experience, and cultural significance. As Helen Ingram and other colleagues have noted during discus sions of water and equity, "[wjater flows through natural and human communities in such close association that abstracting it from its setting and rationalizing it by assigning a quantitative value is to do irremedia ble damage. In this reading of intrinsic value, humans, other living things, and water are inseparable."59 The links that connect human and natural communities are indeed inseparable, and they are often not ade quately captured in markets and are thereby devalued. But these ties are not permanent nor even predictable, and in cases like the connections between landowners and wolves in northern Wisconsin, they do not ex ist or are newly emerging. Incentives might be used to reward whole communities for work ing together to design successful programs that cultivate sustainable, eq uitable relationships. A policy that defines ecological reality as including humans will be more successful. Raul Lejano and Helen Ingram describe how conservation programs "fit" when they are informed by local com munity agendas and capabilities. They suggest co-designing programs He has also worked with the local fish and game department to distribute cattle carcasses along the high perimeter of his ranch in the spring. When hungry grizzlies come out of their dens, they can fill up on the meat of dead cattle, and by the time the grizzlies are done with the carcasses, they can turn to vegetation and leave cattle alone. He also runs fewer cattle so the grass is plentiful, and his cows are bigger and stronger. This both helps his herd avoid being easy pickings for grizzlies and other predators, and also brings a better price at market. 58.

Public recognition and green certification are other strategies for rewarding people for achieving more than meeting a threshold required by law. Technology plays an important role, too. There is a whole range of ways to engage in stewardship, and in some cases people need to inte grate their livelihoods directly into stewardship practices, while in other cases people dedicate free time in pursuing strongly held values of con tributing to a better environment. Whether people track wolves by radio, use cell phones to locate elephants near their farms,61 pull invasive plants to protect an endangered plant species, or turn compost piles with a pitchfork, a whole range of technologies can assist people in engaging with and learning about nonhumans. Restoration and conservation projects rely on monitoring in order to manage adaptively, for example, and monitoring activities are one way of building relationships with a nonhuman species.62 Accessible technologies that provide a diverse set of users with a sense of ownership and responsibility can play a major role in negotiating coexistence and in building rewarding and sustainable networks between humans and nonhuman beings. As the case studies of microbes and wolves suggest, natural re sources policy that respects existing networks between humans and nonhumans, and also fosters new sustainable ones, stands a better chance of achieving its goals—and in an equitable way. 60.
