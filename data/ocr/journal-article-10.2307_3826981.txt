AND LATE VICTORIAN GOTHIC FICTION There is almost always associated with the suggestion of advance in biological phenomena an opposite idea, which is its essential complement. (H. G. Wells, "Zoological Retrogression"). IN THE LAST QUARTER OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY, AS A RESULT OF discussions initiated earlier by Darwin, Spencer, and Huxley, Victorian periodicals featured an increasing number of articles and stories treating psychological issues in the light of the evolutionist hypothesis. At different times between 1873 and 1896 the Contemporary Review, the Fortnightly Review, the Nineteenth Century, and the Cornhill Magazine provided educated nonscientists with explanations of dual consciousness,l primitive man, "Animal Intelligence," and "Heredity in Health and Disease." There were "Speculations about Dreaming" and speculations on "Ethical Philosophy and Evolution." Other essays discussed "Human Personality," "The Growth and Decay of Mind," "Nervous Diseases in Modem Life," and an alleged increase in in- sanity. In many of the same periodicals fiction writers like Walter Pater imagined resurgences of pagan mentality and primitive behavior, and Violet Paget depicted passion-inspired hallucinations.

Throughout most of this same quarter cen- tury Robert Louis Stevenson dramatized abnormality, atavism, and more serious psychological aberration in a series of stories, the most famous of which was The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Notions of dual consciousness, regression, illusion, and genius represent a related group of concepts in which the influence of the evolutionist hypothesis can be traced. All four issues are treated in the work of a representative late nineteenth-century psychologist, James Sully. Indeed Sully's training, professional contacts, and research make him both representative and transitional. Trained in associationist theory by the work of Alexander Bain and James and John Stuart Mill, he also studied experimental psychology under Hermann Lotze and Hermann von Helmholtz, and knew the psychological work of Herbert Spencer thoroughly. Sully's research also evidenced acquain- tance with the work of other defenders of evolution: physiologists like Henry Maudsley and Hughlings Jackson, more popular "journalistic" psychologists like George Henry Lewes and Grant Allen, and scientists like G. J. Romanes. In at least two pieces Sully expressed an awareness of similarities between his views of inherited memory and those of Samuel Butler. Sully's work, including the popular Illusions (with six American editions between 1881 and 1893), exemplified how the influence of Spencer and Darwin was assimilated by associationists, and how to- gether with materialist theories of physiological psychology this hybrid version of psychology offered its own explanation of duality, primitive consciousness, and the phenomena of dreaming. Sully's later work on illusions and genius synthesized the best work of immediate prede- cessors in the field like Taine, Joly, and Galton. Close comparison of an artistic work, Stevenson's The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, with Sully's treatment of these themes will form the basis for developing the broader implications that evolutionist psychology had for other late Victorian fiction. Stated simply, James Sully's characteristically Victorian psychological in- vestigations affirm progressive development in the integrated forms and phases of human consciousness, while evidencing an avid and timely interest in duality, regression, illusion, and genius, "the border- land between the normal and the abnormal,"2 the world of much of L.

Stevenson's tale, on the other hand, questions the achievement and stability of evolutionary development, depicting the disintegration of the individual psyche through phases whose symptoms are recognizably similar to those described by Sully and other evolutionist psychologists. An initial comparison of the works of these two men will show the success with which Stevenson employs current psychological thought to unfold the complex layers of de- velopment implicit in human personality. Beyond showing that Stevenson suggests artistically what Sully analyzes scientifically, I propose that evolutionist psychology helps explain the uniqueness of much - particularly short - fiction in the last quarter of the century. The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and other work by Stevenson like "Olalla" and "The Merry Men," are not the only tales which reflect the growth of evolutionist psychology, but they most clearly follow patterns visible in Sully's thought. Stevenson's work makes more consistent and general use of motifs which are just as vividly presented in the work of Paget, Pater, Stoker, Kipling, and Wells. Even if these writers do not incorporate precisely the same evolutionist ideas depicted in Stevenson's work, the influence of an evolutionist climate is clearly evident in the simi- larity of ideas and their prevalence. In fact it is the relative emphasis on psychological and related evolutionist motifs which suggests that works in this category may be provisionally termed Victorian Gothic. These stories evidence significant modification of even those themes and conventions - madness, bloodlust, and evil genius among them - which characterized peculiarly eighteenth-century versions of the Gothic romance. I We may presume that, for all its archetypal resonances and its permanent attraction, The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is no more a sui generis composition than any other work in a given tradition. Critics and biographers have noted possible sources in Stevenson's religious upbringing. Stevenson himself stated in "A Chapter on Dreams" that he "had long been trying to write a story on this subject, to find a body, a vehicle, for that strong sense of man's double being which must at times come in upon and overwhelm the SUMMER 1982 445</page><page sequence="4">Ed Block, Jr. mind of every thinking creature."3 In essays like "Pastoral" (I,152- 153), "The Manse" (1,163), "Talk and Talkers II" (I,197), 'The Char- acter of Dogs" (1,210-211), and "A Gossip on Romance" (1,251), he also made clear this interest in atavism, dual consciousness, degenera- tion, and unconscious memory. Yet other than these evidences of interest, Stevenson says little about specific sources. One totally ignored source for evolutionist ideas is the work and friendship of James Sully. From about 1876 Sully and Stevenson were both members of the Salive Club, and though Stevenson's let- ters make no explicit mention of the friendship, Fanny Osborne wrote that Sully was among those who by their visits and conversations brightened the life of Skerryvore in the months during which Steven- son wrote The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.4 Sully's autobiography makes much of the acquaintance and elaborates on the mutual influence the two writers had on each other.5 Particularly significant was their shared interest in the importance of dreams to creative writing. Sully even admitted that his essay, "Dreams and their Relation to Literature" (Forum, 1889), was the result of their discussing the dream origins of The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (LF, p. 194), a suggestion that the relationship was complex and mutual. Whatever the facts of the friendship, Sully's attitude to the relationship is clear: "Although I was his senior, the fact of our having joined the Savile about the same time, and still more the 3"A Chapter on Dreams," Works of Robert Louis Stevenson, ed.

The Cornhill connection is obviously the most important for understanding the possible source of evolutionist ideas in Stevenson's work. For in the five years between 1876 and 1882 Leslie Stephen published thirteen pieces by Stevenson and twelve by Sully in the pages of the Cornhill Magazine. In fact it was frequently the case that articles by both appeared in the same issue. Stevenson's contributions included "Virginibus Puerisque" (1876), "Thrawn Janet" (1881), and "The Merry Men" (1882), not to mention several stories and other essays including "Talk and Talkers" (1882). Sully's included a series of essays providing popularized evolutionist explanations of duality, primitive consciousness, illusions, and madness. After examining Sully's specific observations on these matters, I shall use them to illuminate the deeply evolutionist strain in The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Sully's concern with duality in normal as well as abnormal states of consciousness derived in part from his associationist leanings. For Sully, as for Mill and Bain (in System of Logic and The Emotions and the Will), knowledge of one's self and others rested upon two varieties of introspection, one critical and one sympathetic. Each kind of introspection implied a dual mental perspective, one kind requiring that the subject "separate sufficiently the judging part from the judged parts of the individual" (SE,166); the other resulting when the subject projected qualities or feelings onto others on the basis of his or her own contents of consciousness (AHC, 508). Sully elaborated on his notions in "The Aesthetics of Human Character," "Self-Esteem," and "Illusions of Memory." His notions of introspection and duality were also clear in books like Sensation and Intuition (1874) and Illusions (1882). In "Self-Esteem" Sully carefully analyzed the difficulty of achieving an accurate sense of one's own moral character. Citing the research of George Henry Lewes on the origin of cognition in primi- tive feeling, Sully noted that "the feeling of personal worth, with its accompanying judgement, is a product of a long process of instinctive action ... on the supposition that man has been slowly evolved from lower forms, it is clear that the instinct of self-promotion must be the deepest and most ineradicable element of his nature, and it is this instinct which directly underlies the rudimentary sentiment of self-esteem ... " (SE,163). In order to counterbalance the primitive and instinctual source of self-esteem, Sully noted that the individual SUMMER 1982 447</page><page sequence="6">Ed Block, Jr. must regard his or her own character "ab extra, just as a second person would view it" (SE,167). He argued the possibility of such a rigorous splitting of one's perspective on the basis of the introspective capa- bilities of individual consciousness. Sully's discussions of dualism are only one representative example of concern about dual conscious- ness in the decade before publication of The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. In rather specific philosophical and psychological terms, it will appear, The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde dramatizes the scientific issues raised by Mill and Bain in the years prior to 1886. Knowledge of other individuals through sympathetic perception was equally difficult, but for a different reason. In "The Aesthetics of Human Character" Sully invoked Alexander Bain's "theory of rela- tivity"6 to assert that knowledge of another's character depended on the perception of analogies with one's own inner life (AHC, 506). Perception of analogous states through often intense sympathy consti- tuted the key to understanding other human beings. Such a sympathetic act was again possible because of the individual's introspective capa- bilities and the tendency to assume a dual perspective for the purpose of knowing or inferring. The instinctual source of self-esteem is one lesson taught by Stevenson's depiction of Edward Hyde. The acqui- sition of knowledge through intense sympathy receives a somber rendering in Stevenson's depiction of Henry Jekyll's lawyer friend, J. G. Utterson. Besides explaining and reaffirming the associationist's ideas about dual modes of consciousness, Sully defended the evolutionist hypothesis as applied to psychology from very early in his writing career. The first essay of his first book, Sensation and Intuition, defends "The Relation of the Evolutionist Hypothesis to Human Psychology." His contribution to volume one of Mind (1876), a survey of "Physio- logical Psychology in Germany," boldly affirms the continuity of research done by Charles Darwin and Wilhelm Wundt. All of Sully's evolutionist defenses implicitly accept the notions of evolution de- veloped by Darwin and popularized by Thomas Henry Huxley. Methodologically Sully's materialist views agreed with Huxley's de- fense of Darwin in "The Origin of Species" (1860), an essay named after Darwin's great work. Referring to the uniformity of physiological and physical laws, Huxley affirmed: "We know that the phenomena of vitality are not something apart from other physical phenomena but one with them; and matter and force are the two names of the one 6Alexander Bain, The Emotions and the Will (London: Longmans and Green, 1865), p. 41. VICTORIAN STUDIES 448</page><page sequence="7">JAMES SULLY AND GOTHIC FICTION artist who fashions the living as well as the lifeless. Hence living bodies should obey the same great laws as other matter."7 Sully's frequently-enunciated philosophical position also harmonized with Huxley's conclusion in "On the Physical Basis of Life" (1868), a Fortnightly Review contribution that attracted copious critical re- sponse in periodicals during the decade when Sully's major periodical essays appeared: In itself it is of little moment whether we express the phenomena of matter in terms of spirit; or the phenomena of spirit in terms of matter. . . . But with a view to the progress of science, the materialistic terminology is in every way to be preferred. For it connects thought with other phenomena of the universe, and suggests inquiry into the nature of those physical conditions, or concomitants of thought, which are more or less accessible to us, and a knowledge of which may, in future, help us to exercise the same kind of control over the world of thought as we already possess in respect of the material world.8 The high purpose and clear goal of this statement reflect Sully's own purpose and goals for psychology in the majority of his investigations into the nature of primitive consciousness, illusion, and the genius that is allied to madness. It is little wonder that, given the opportunity, Sully and Huxley should be able to work together on a common project. In fact, at the apparently separate promptings of Spencer Baynes, the two evolu- tionists did collaborate in a way on the "Evolution" entry for the ninth edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica which Baynes was compiling. As Sully tells it, "I was at this time writing a philosophical article on 'Evolution' for Spencer Baynes of the 'Encyclopedia Britannica,' and Huxley became my colleague in a peculiar way by undertaking to write for the 'Encyclopedia' a biological article on the same subject" (LF, p. 169). Huxley's initials stand at the end of part one of the essay, "Evolution in Biology"; Sully's at the end of part two, "Evolu- tion in Philosophy." In their respective essays both Sully and Huxley acknowledge the same British exponents of evolution, according the same order of importance to Darwin and Wallace, and reserving to Herbert Spencer the culminating position as general theorist of evolution. From Spencer, in fact, Sully derived his most characteristic evo- lutionist principles of psychology. Sully explicitly traces his interest in the origins of the aesthetic impulse and of double consciousness to Spencer's discussion of "aesthetic sentiments" in The Principles of Psychology. In his Britannica entry on "Aesthetics" Sully acknowledged 7 Thomas Henry Huxley, "The Origin of Species," in Lay Sermons, Addresses, and Re- views (New York: D. Appleton, 1886), p. 262. 8 Thomas Henry Huxley, "On the Physical Basis of Life," in Method and Results (New York: D. Appleton, 1897), p. 164. SUMMER 1982 449</page><page sequence="8">Ed Block, Jr. this debt to Spencer, and the corroborative influence of Bain, as he sought to reconcile the views of his two teachers on the nature and origins of aesthetic experience. Into the late 187os Sully was still taking such evolutionists as Grant Allen and Samuel Butler to task for their divergence from the aesthetic and evolutionary principles laid down by Spencer (CS,417,418). To trace the specific development of Sully's interest in the origins of psychological phenomena, we must look back to Sensation and Intuition where Sully had pointed to "that once universal tendency of the human mind to project its own feelings into every object, animate or inanimate" (SI, p. 15). In his Cornhill essay on "Poetic Imagination and Primitive Conception," Sully later invoked E. B. Tylor's anthro- pological research to assert that personification or "the employment of animistic conception" was a "habit of thought" common to the poetic imagination as the survival of a more primitive "anthropo- morphic mode of thought" (PPC, 295). In a comment pertinent to discussion of anthropomorphic projections in The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Sully said, "Whenever we cease to regard the phenomena of nature as mere facts, . . we naturally glide into this double mode of conception" (PPC, 296). In his research on dreams Sully found a particularly useful example of such duality. In "Illusions of Memory" he stated that "in dreams we often distinctly lose all hold on ourselves, and take up the curious position of spectators at a transformation scene, in which our respectable ego is playing a sort of game of 'bo-peep' with us" (IM,423). "And what happens in dreams," he said, "may happen in waking life. Every act of intense sympathy is for the time a confusion of our own sense of identity" (IM,423). Adopting Spencer's Lamarckian notions of heredity, Sully explained the survival of this mode of con- ception by the hereditary transmission of habits of thought. The deepest ground of this tendency must probably be looked for in the primitive ideas of the race and the transmission by inheritance of the effect of its firmly fixed habits of mind. The undisciplined mind of early man . . . taking his own double consciousness as the type of all existence, actually saw the stream, the ocean, and the mountains as living things; and so firmly rooted is this way of regarding objects, that even our own scientifically trained minds find it a relief to relapse occasionally into it. (I, p. 225). Not only Jekyll but Utterson as well exhibit similar manifestations of double consciousness. Concern with pathological states of dual consciousness was a minor theme of research in the 187os, 188os, and early 189os. In his 1893 essay, "The Dream as a Revelation," Sully sought to explain VICTORIAN STUDIES 450</page><page sequence="9">JAMES SULLY AND GOTHIC FICTION the manifestation of "primitive consciousness" in such similar psycho- logical phenomena as dual consciousness, dreams, and illusions (DR, 358-359). For his discussion of dual consciousness itself Sully used contemporary experiments with hypnosis as further proof of the phenomenon. Psychology has of late occupied itself much with the curious phenomenon of double or alternating personality. By this is meant the recurrent interruption of the normal state by the intrusion of a secondary state, in which the thought, feelings, and the whole personality become other than they were. This occasional substitution of a new for the old self is sometimes spontaneous, the result of brain trouble; sometimes it is artificially brought about in specially susceptible persons by hypnotizing them. (DR, 361). In this more specific reference to pathological duality, Sully's work most nearly resembles the concern which Stevenson makes central to The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. What usually kept such dual states from disrupting the ordi- nary individual's sense of identity were their infrequency and lack of intensity, their submission to volitional control, and the presence of an external point of orientation. Such dual states became dangerous illusions and in fact symptoms of madness only when one or more of the controlling factors were absent. In Stevenson's tale the char- acters of Utterson and Jekyll both encounter situations when one or more of the controlling factors are absent. Sully's study of dreams showed that the dream was a regular occurrence in which lack of volitional control and the absence of external orientation induced varieties of illusion. In "The Laws of Dream Fancy," Sully noted that "the loss of volitional control of internal thought" was one of two reasons for the randomness of dreams (LDF,544-545). In Illusions he compared the similar kinds of loss of orientation characteristic of hypnosis, dreams, and hallucinations. In this way [hypnosis], the mind of the patient is largely cut off from the external world, as in sleep, and the power of orientation is lost. Moreover, there are all the conditions present, both positive and negative, for the hallucinatory trans- formation of mental images into percepts just as in natural sleep. Thus, the higher centres connected with the operations of reflection and reasoning are thrown hors de combat or, as Dr. Heidenhain has it, "inhibited." (I, p. 187). For Sully the psychological state of the genius was a prime example of powerful forces occurring with such intensity and fre- quency that volitional control and external orientation were virtually nullified. In essays like "Genius and Insanity" as well as in The Human Mind (1893), Sully assimilated and distilled the findings of Galton, Joly, Taine, William James, and Arthur Schopenhauer. The SUMMER 1982 451</page><page sequence="10">Ed Block, Jr. intensity of the genius's vision, Sully said, made "the severest demands on the controlling and guiding forces of volition" (GI,964). Among other pernicious effects of such absorption were weaknesses and moral failings, examples of which are copiously recorded in the literature on genius (HM, p. 309). In the character of Henry Jekyll we see the outline of an exceptional intellect subjected to disruptive forces of imagination and single-minded intellectual effort. Even Utterson's search for Hyde is a faint reflection of the single-mindedness of purpose which signals withdrawal of ordinary attention from reality and the consequent minor distortion of perception. II This outline of Sully's thought provides a structure for ex- plaining The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. From compar- ing the two men's work we can infer an implicit purpose in the narra- tive's tracing the effects of Jekyll's fate on the personalities of both principal characters, Jekyll and Utterson. Since all but the last two chapters are told from Utterson's viewpoint, descriptions of other characters, scenes, and events simultaneously depict Utterson's sense of himself, his supposedly rational grasp of events, and his increasing inclination to project his emotions and sympathies onto Jekyll and his environment. From the start the apparently conventional lawyer is intent on solving a mystery. He seeks to explain why the name of Edward Hyde appears in Henry Jekyll's will. To Utterson the con- nection is illogical and suspicious. Though of a "fanciful nature" (E, 18; P, 36), Jekyll is known as a scientist and a gentleman. Utterson's acquaintance with Hyde, on the other hand, revealed only his brutality and irascibility. Utterson's logical mind cannot associate two such diverse characters. In his methodical quest for the connection, however, Utterson epitomizes a complex distortion of an empiricist ideal. Though ascetic, generally self-controlled (E, 7; P, 29), and given to weekly reading of "dry divinity" (E, 16; P, 35), he also indulges his friends' weaknesses and even takes vicarious pleasure, "wondering, almost with envy, at the high pressure of spirits involved in their misdeeds" (E, 7; P, 29). In short one is tempted to say that Utterson represents a conventionally Victorian- that is, a slightly repressed and compensatorily logical and scientific - mind. But as Utterson plunges deeper into the case, VICTORIAN STUDIES 452</page><page sequence="11">JAMES SULLY AND GOTHIC FICTION his single-minded engagement and the circumstances of the mystery put a strain on his merely logical faculties. Through Utterson's re- flections and the way descriptions of setting change, Stevenson conveys a sense of the extent to which Utterson's personality is affected. Utter- son, "the lover of sane and customary sides of life to whom the fanciful was the immodest" (E, 17; P, 35), becomes subject to minor sympto- matic illusions. Like the victims described in Sully's papers on illusion, Utterson and his imagination are gradually "engaged, or rather en- slaved" (E, 19; P, 37) by the mystery of Jekyll and Hyde. Without apparent reason he dreams of Jekyll, and almost superstitiously credit- ing as true the daydream of a figure beside Jekyll's bed "to whom power was given" (E, 19; P, 37), he sets out motivated by the premo- nition of evil to find a cause for the fears his imagination has awakened. Though the signs of Utterson's susceptibility to distraction and potentially dangerous illusion are prevalent, two dramatic examples will suffice. On the morning following the murder of Sir Danvers Carew, Utterson and a police officer set out to find Hyde in Soho, and the effect of the "chocolate-coloured pall" of fog depresses Utterson to an uncommon degree. Seen during "this mournful re-invasion of darkness," Soho "seemed, to the lawyer's eye, like a district of some city in a nightmare. The thoughts of his mind, besides, were of the gloomiest dye; and when he glanced at the companion of his drive, he was conscious of some touch of that terror of the law and the law's officers which may at times assail the most honest" (E, 33-34; P, 48). In the intensity of his desire to solve the mystery, Utterson exhibits some of the tendencies later ascribed to Hyde. Stevenson suggests in this way the strain on Utterson's mental state. The details by which he conveys this strain resemble the distortions of that dual mode of consciousness which Sully had examined in "Self-Esteem." That Utterson shows terror of the law implies an exaggerative distor- tion of imagination. The reference to a "mournful re-invasion" of darkness further implies the beginnings of specifically anthropo- morphic projection. The analogy of London to "some city in a night- mare" suggests Utterson's inclination to compare-if not confuse- waking and illusory perception. On the last night of Jekyll's life, Utterson exhibits still other symptoms of incipient illusion and disorientation. That he himself recognizes the threat to his mental equilibrium is hinted by his desire for reorientation with his own kind. Travelling the streets of London to Jekyll's lodgings, Utterson observes the scene in a way which is no longer purely logical or factual. SUMMER 1982 453</page><page sequence="12">Ed Block, Jr. It was a wild, cold, seasonable night in March, with a pale moon, lying on her back as though the wind had tilted her, and a flying wrack of the most diaphanous and lawny texture. . . The wind seemed to have swept the streets unusually bare of passengers, besides, for Utterson thought he had never seen that part of London so deserted. He could have wished it otherwise; never in his life had he been conscious of so sharp a desire to see and touch his fellow-creatures; for, struggle as he might, there was borne in upon his mind a crushing antici- pation of calamity. (E, 52; P, 63). In the personification of wind and moon, Utterson appears to slip further into a sinister form of anthropomorphic projection. In "Poetic Imagination and Primitive Conception," we recall, Sully had invoked Tylor's Primitive Culture to relate the primitive "double mode of conception" to the "fragmenting of personality" (PPC, 296) that oc- curred even in the normal changes of a person's moods. In "The Laws of Dream Fancy" Sully had also asserted that the confusion of per- ception and imagination which occurred in dreams was the same as the confusion that resulted from the intensity of "excited states of the imagination including pathological conditions. Under these cir- cumstances pure fancies of the mind, by acquiring a certain degree of vividness and persistence, become mistaken for real perception" (LDF, 538, 539). If Utterson does not yet mistake his projections for reality, that fact is only proof that the obvious mental strain of his search has not yet become acute. That Utterson recognizes the threat of illusion is indicated in his wish "to see and touch his fellow-creatures." One of the three conditions for controlling the power of illusion here comes into play. Alone with his fears and anticipations of calamity, Utterson voices a common enough desire for company. In Illusions, however, Sully explained this desire psychologically by noting that "human experi- ence is consistent, that man's perceptions and beliefs fall into a consensus. From this point of view illusion is seen to arise through some exceptional feature in the situation or condition of the indi- vidual, which, for the time, breaks the charm of intellectual solidarity which under ordinary circumstances binds the single member to the collective body" (I, p. 8). The anthropomorphic mode of perception which reflects Utterson's mental condition is exacerbated by his isolated absorption in the mystery of Hyde's identity. Clearly Utterson's mental state is not so precarious as Jekyll's. His otherwise consistent uprightness of character insures that he will not succumb to the promptings of his instincts or give way to psycho- logical dividedness. Utterson's state is only important as mirroring in a fainter way the circumstances which affect Dr. Jekyll. Stevenson VICTORIAN STUDIES 454</page><page sequence="13">JAMES SULLY AND GOTHIC FICTION underlines the points Sully had already made in his scientific work. When beset by powerful emotions and bereft of the ordinary condi- tions for rational control of one's apprehensions and projections, even the ordinary consciousness is susceptible to the powers of mental dissolution. In his search for Hyde, Utterson orients himself to the external world through his communication with characters like Richard En- field, Dr. Lanyon, and Jekyll's servant, Poole. He tests his perceptions and his sense of self against theirs. Jekyll, on the other hand, is forced by Hyde's criminal acts to forego such contacts lest a public trans- formation into Hyde reveal his secret. Without such orientation to his fellow creatures, the disruptive experiences which his experiment occasions make him succumb to illusion and madness. In trying to understand the process of Jekyll's dissolution, we can make even more substantive use of Sully's analyses of the stages of such decline. In the character of Jekyll we see a man of great mental attain- ments and fatal moral weaknesses. In his single-minded devotion to science and his contrasting inclination to evil we see the extremes of character that constitute one nineteenth-century notion of genius. In his "Final Statement of the Case" Jekyll himself reveals the motives which make him conduct his experiment. Ignoring the warnings of moral philosophers and psychologists alike, Jekyll attempts to separate the parts of consciousness which represent the nineteenth century's notion of character. In attempting to sever the moral from the intel- lectual and emotional faculties, Jekyll fails to recognize the effect on human will which scientists attributed to evolutionary development. "The growth of the individual will," Sully said, "is inexplicable without reference to ancestral history and inheritance" (MW, 126). When Jekyll dissolves the bonds which unite the parts of his psyche, he brings back to separate life a primitive nature and starts a process which ends in insanity. Jekyll's experiment may for a moment yield a more primitive freedom of the kind Sully appreciated in dreams (DR, 358, 363) and looked wistfully back to in primitive societies. Jekyll says, "It seemed natural and human. In my eyes it bore a livelier image of the spirit" (E, 83; P, 84). Jekyll, however, desires to experience in everyday life a freedom which is no longer permitted expression in evolved society. "I was the first that could thus plod in the public eye with a load of genial respectability, and in a moment, like a schoolboy, strip off these lendings and spring headlong into a sea of liberty" (E, 85; P, 86). The "sea" of liberty which Sully had reserved for the satisfaction of aes- SUMMER 1982 455</page><page sequence="14">Ed Block, Jr. thetic sentiments is here desired without the limiting powers of will or social restraint. As Sully, synthesizing the thought of his decade respecting genius, had observed, "The man of great intellect or genius has so frequently been characterized by marked moral failings, weak- ness of will in control of the passions and so forth that this fact . . . has led certain writers to regard the organic basis of all genius as a neurosis or abnormal deviation from the healthy type of nervous organization" (HM, p. 309). Jekyll's fate is thus intimately related to and expresses itself in a condition familiar to the age as "the failings of genius." Jekyll lays the blame for Hyde's character on self-love; "his every act and thought centered on self; drinking pleasures with bestial avidity from any degree of torture to another" (E, 86; P, 86). Of him- self Jekyll also says, "I had voluntarily stripped myself of all those balancing instincts" (E, 92; P, 90). The nature, origin, and reason for Hyde's boundless self-love and increasing brutality requires an explanation which transcends the insufficient cause Jekyll suggests; namely that he was personally a selfish creature and that he had taken the transforming drug when "my virtue slumbered" (E, 84; P, 85). Sully's evolutionist explanation of the important balancing effect which will exerts on primitive instincts provides one possible explanation. Through inherited habits as well as societal constraints, the will has evolved as a controlling force in the individual personality. Release the other faculties from the will's power, and primitive instincts and emotions assert their prior claim. The clues to Hyde's personality show Stevenson's acknowledged interest in atavistic manifestations. Like characters in his other stories - not to mention the nonfiction prose pieces like "The Manse" and "Pastoral" - Hyde is referred to as an animal or some primitive form of life. "The brute" (E, 98; P, 94) is "troglodytic" (E, 24; P, 40) and "ape-like" (E, 31, 1oo, 101; P, 47, 96, 97). His "savage laugh" (E, 24; P, 40) and his "light quick way ... like a monkey" (E, 59; P, 67-68) have been frequently noted. But in addition the story concentrates on his degenerate forms of speech. Jekyll's servant Poole hears the creature "cry out like a rat" (E, 57; P, 66). Describing Hyde's return from the Carew murder, Jekyll says, "He walked fast, hunted by his fears, chattering to himself" (E, 97; P, 94). When Poole and Utter- son finally break down the door to Jekyll's cabinet, there is "a dismal screech, as of mere animal terror" (E, 62; P, 69). Among the variety of scientific sources for this concern with primitive language we can VICTORIAN STUDIES 456</page><page sequence="15">JAMES SULLY AND GOTHIC FICTION number Sully's review of Mental Evolution in Man by G. J. Romanes. Here Sully exhibited a parallel interest in a "genealogy of man as the articulate reasoner" (MR, 745). Sully had also called attention in "Pessimism and Poetry" to the primitive expression of emotion. In that essay he had invoked Darwin's The Expression of Emotion in Man and Animals in order to claim that in times of suffering "the force of the older instinct ever and again comes to light" (PP, 223). Hyde's final cry, in this view, expresses the primitive emotion of this primitive side of Jekyll's personality. The most telling symptoms of psychological deterioration are Jekyll's final lapse into illusion and his ultimate dissociation and death. In Illusions Sully explained this process in evolutionist terms. Refer- ring to the psychopathological research of his physician friend, Hugh- lings Jackson, Sully stated: If the nervous system has been slowly built up, during the course of human history, into its present complex form, it follows that those nervous structures and connexions which have to do with the higher intellectual process, or which represent the larger and more general relations of our experience, have been most recently evolved. Consequently, they would be the least deeply organized, and so the least stable, that is to say, the most liable to be thrown hors de combat. This is what happens temporarily in the case of the sane, when the mind is held fast by an illusion. And, in the states of insanity, we see the process of nervous dissolution beginning with the same nervous structures, and so taking the reverse order of the process of evolution. (I, p. 122). The daylight transformation of Jekyll into Hyde in Regents Park is precipitated when "the spiritual side a little drowsed," and Jekyll says, "A qualm came over me, a horrid nausea and the most deadly shuddering" (E, 95; P, 92). Sully's description of the final stages of disorientation and dissociation explains these latter symptoms. The beginnings of such disease, accompanied as they commonly are with dis- turbances of bodily sensations and the recurring emotions, illustrates in a very interesting way the dependence of the recognition of self on a certain degree of uniformity in the contents of consciousness. The patient, when first aware of these changes, is perplexed, and often regards the new feelings as making up another self, a foreign Tu, as distinguished from the familiar Ego. And sometimes he expresses the relation between the old and the new in fantastic ways, as when he imagines the former to be under the power of some foreign personality. (I, p. 290). Though Jekyll still thinks of Hyde as his "other self," he also notes that "he thought of Hyde, for all his energy of life, as of something not only hellish but inorganic. This was the shocking thing; that the slime of the pit seemed to utter cries and voices .. . and at every hour SUMMER 1982 457</page><page sequence="16">Ed Block, Jr. of weakness, and in the confidence of slumber, prevailed against him, and deposed him out of life" (E, 99-100; P, 95-96). Subjected to the unexpected transformations, Jekyll seeks the isolation of his cabinet where further and more frequent dissociation implies the results of his having cut himself off from any source of orientation among his own kind. In penning his final declaration Jekyll is the thoroughly dissociated and abjectly fearful victim of his own experiment. "Should the throes of change take me in the act of writing it, Hyde will tear it in pieces; but if some time shall have elapsed after I have laid it by, his wonderful selfishness and circum- scription to the moment will probably save it once again from the action of his apelike spite" (E, lo0; P, 97). Isolated now from all the world of reality, Jekyll expresses a fear of Hyde's primitive unpredictability. Described here as limited to selfish concerns and unable to think be- yond the moment, Hyde represents Stevenson's most somber picture of the primitive form of human nature. Though expressed here in exaggerated terms, the figure resembles that conjectured by artist and evolutionist scientist alike to reside just below the unstable surface organization of civilized consciousness. III The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is Stevenson's most sustained depiction of psychological aberration treated in evo- lutionist terms. But it is hardly his only work to benefit from the evolutionist perspective. In "The Merry Men" and "Olalla," apparently normal first person narrators are, like Utterson, attracted to kinds of primitive behavior similar to those exhibited by the individuals with whom they have to deal. In these two stories, however, references to the nature of language and the use of speech are the hints left to point to evolutionist explanation of events. Sully's article, "Is Man the Only Reasoner," and his many critical notices on the subject in Mind represent only one example of contemporary scientific interest in the evolution of human speech. In "The Merry Men" a superstitious islander, Gordon Darnaway, degenerates under the combined influences of drink and the mad- dening roar of the waters of Sandag Bay, somewhere off the west coast of Scotland. Darnaway's nephew Charles describes the effect of a storm on the rocks, the Merry Men, whose name gives the story VICTORIAN STUDIES 458</page><page sequence="17">JAMES SULLY AND GOTHIC FICTION its title. It is to this rock-strewn cove that Charles's uncle returns repeatedly, waiting for unwary ships to be wrecked, providing sal- vage booty. Loud above all this hurly-burly I could hear the changeful voices of the Roost and the intermittent roaring of the Merry Men. At that hour, there flashed into my mind the reason of the name that they were called. For the noise of them seemed almost mirthful, as it out-topped the other noises of the night; or if not mirthful, yet instinct with a portentous joviality. Nay, and it seemed even human. As when savage men have drunk away their reason, and, discarding speech, bawl together in their madness by the hour, so to my ears, these deadly breakers shouted by Aros in the night. (III, 157-158). Describing the effect that the sound of the sea has not only on his uncle, but on himself, Charles says: "The spectacle was rather mad- dening in its levity than impressive by its force. Thought was beaten down by the confounding uproar; a gleeful vacancy possessed the brains of men, a state akin to madness; and I found myself at times following the dance of the Merry Men as it were a tune upon a jigging instrument" (III, 159). The pathetic fallacy obvious in both descriptions is evidence that Charles Darnaway is being swept toward a primitive state of consciousness similar to that described in Sully's "Poetic Imagination and Primitive Conception." The connection of speechlessness and madness recalls Sully's observations on the ori- gins of speech researched by Romanes. Like Utterson, Charles Darn- away survives to tell his tale. The uncle, on the other hand, does go mad, and his insanity follows a recognized sequence: an idee fixe, certifiable illusions, a relapse into superstitious fears, and a suicidal plunge into Sandag Bay. All save the suicidal urge were pathological symptoms discussed from an evolutionary perspective by Sully in Illusions and The Human Mind. In "Olalla," which a recent editor-opposing most previous critical opinion - says "must surely be counted in the handful of truly great horror stories in the English language,"9 most of the characters including the soldier-narrator show similar tendencies to recapitulate primitive modes of consciousness. In different ways all three members of a once-great Spanish family exhibit the decline of their race to the soldier who comes to recuperate at their residencia. Felipe, the son, is a half-wit whose preconceptual language appears focused on sensation. He "seemed to live . . . by the senses, taken and possessed by the 9The Supernatural Short Stories of Robert Louis Stevenson, ed. Michael Hayes (New York: Dell, 1978), p. 8. SUMMER 1982 459</page><page sequence="18">Ed Block, Jr. visual object of the moment and unable to discharge his mind of that impression." His speech is a "disjointed babble .. . and yet somehow with an effect that was natural and pleasing, like that of the song of birds" (III, 266, 267). The Sefiora, mother of Felipe and Olalla, has just as little use for speech, also living in the moment. A more frightening manifestation of her primitiveness, however, is her violent bloodlust. Aroused by the sight of blood from the soldier's cut hand, the Sefiora suddenly attacks the soldier and bites the hand. As in the case of Hyde's attack on Sir Danvers Carew, the unexpected im- pulsive act reveals prehuman instincts. The Seiiora's attraction to blood is significant as it represents another modification of a traditional Gothic convention. In the context of the story's concern wth Galtonian notions of heredity, bloodlust represents a manifestation of "de- generacy" such as Walter Bagehot, for instance, had forecast in Physics and Politics. In this way the age-old trope is legitimized in the evolutionist context and as a result invested with a fresh load of sinister connotations. The Sefiora's bloodlust also anticipates the interest in vampirism evidenced most clearly a decade later in Bram Stoker's Dracula. Even the heroine, Olalla, seems to revert to prehuman behavior. As she tends the narrator's twice-injured hand, he describes her verbal ministrations. "They were not words that came to her, they were sounds more beautiful than speech. . . . Yes, they were beautiful sounds, and they were inspired by human tenderness; but was their beauty human?" (III, 306). The narrator intimates what Sully in "The Luxury of Pity" was to assert, using Spencer's term concerning the origin of pitying gestures. These gestures, Sully said, were in- stinctual expressions of care for offspring, developed in even the lowest "subhuman mother. The new emotion [pity] prompted to acts of motherly ministration, which greatly increased the chances of her fragile progeny's survival . . " (LOP, 89). Sully's observations, oddly enough, apply to the narrator not only on the physical but the psycho- logical level as well. Physically wounded, he is also something of a psychological cripple, exemplifying another of Stevenson's favorite character types, the lowland Scot unable to acknowledge his own emotional depths until too late. The index of how threatening these phenomena are meant to be is hinted at, again, as in The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and "The Merry Men," by the narrator's attitude. The wounded soldier has been rapt out of his civilized - and inhibited - attitudes by his infatuation with Olalla. His description of the Spanish country- VICTORIAN STUDIES 460</page><page sequence="19">JAMES SULLY AND GOTHIC FICTION side shows how, under the influence of sexual attraction, his percep- tions experience distortions Sully had identified as poetic but also as basically primitive. "Something elemental, something rude, violent, and savage, in the love that sang in my heart, was like a key to nature's secrets; and the very stones that rattled under my feet appeared alive and friendly. Olalla! Her touch had quickened, and renewed, and strung me up to the old pitch of concert with the rugged earth, to a swelling of the soul that men learn to forget in their polite assemblies" (III, 303). Even more ominous, however, had been the way in which the narrator marvelled at, as he accepted, his own loss of speech when brought face to face with Olalla. "Speech seemed to drop away from me like a childish habit; and I but drew near to her as the giddy man draws near to the margin of a gulf" (III, 298). Both the speech- lessness and the attraction to danger parallel the development of the Darnaways' attraction to the murderous rocks in "The Merry Men." IV Even these few instances should serve to direct new attention to the depth of psychological and specifically evolutionist insights in Stevenson's other work. From a brief look at a few further examples in the work of other writers, we should now be able to comprehend the breadth of the influence that Sully and evolutionist writers like Lewes, Maudsley, Lombroso, and others had on Gothic storytellers in the last quarter of the century. Among Aesthetes who might have counted Stevenson one of their party, Violet Paget and Walter Pater deserve mention. In their handful of Gothic short stories both developed ideas similar to those in the Stevenson tales we have discussed. Paget's "Amour Dure" and "Dionea," published in Hauntings in 1890, and Pater's "Apollo in Picardy" (1893) are only two obvious examples that update Hein- rich Heine's "gods in exile" motif. Pater had explored the modern relevance of the motif in his Studies in the History of the Renaissance (1873), and both he and Paget had followed up on his cultural studies with fictional experiments along the same lines. In all three stories the putative return of pagan deities is seen as a manifestation of re- surgent primitive forces in extraordinary individuals. The protagonists in these three stories, all extraordinary individuals like Jekyll or Olalla, fall prey to primitive forces and go mad or are physically de- stroyed. Although A. C. Benson says Pater paid no attention to scien- SUMMER 1982 461</page><page sequence="20">Ed Block, Jr. tific movements or discoveries, he was sufficiently aware of anthropo- logical notions to refer to animism in his essay on Wordsworth, and again in his long essay, Plato and Platonism.10 This evidence should be sufficient to question Pater's alleged ignorance of current thought. It also shows the way in which an interest in origins connects Pater's notion of emergent primitivism to Sully's work on animistic modes of thought. On the edge of this aesthetic group we might locate the better known Dracula, which develops as gruesome a theme of bloodlust as that found in Stevenson's "Olalla" and in which the interest in psychological explanations of uncanny phenomena is equal to that in The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. The resurgence of primitive power in an asylum inmate - apparently infused with Dracula's own force (chapter twenty-one), the description of Dracula's evil genius (chapter twenty-three), and Van Helsing's psychological explanations of Dracula's purposes (chapter twenty-five) are clear indications that Stoker too was moved by contemporary thought to cast his story in evolutionist terms. As Dracula, unsuccessful in his plan to possess Mina Harker totally, attempts to flee across Europe to his castle, Van Helsing explains the strategy by which his pursuers can trap the count. Contrasting his own party's mental strengths with the count's otherwise formidable powers, Van Helsing perceives a point of vulnerability. "I have hope that our man-brains that have been of man so long and that have not lost the grace of God, will come higher than his child-brain that lies in his tomb for centuries, that grows not yet to our stature, and that do [sic] only work selfish and therefore small."1' A bit later Dr. Seward fits the evolutionist overtones of these comments into the context of contemporary criminal psychology. "The count is a criminal and of criminal type. Nordau and Lombroso would so classify him, and qua criminal he is of imperfectly formed mind. Then, in a difficulty he has to seek resource in habit. His past is a clue, and the one page of it that we know - and that from his own lips - tells that once before, when in what Mr. Morris would call a 'tight place,' he went back to his own country from the land he had tried to invade, and there, without losing purpose, prepared himself for a new effort." (Dracula, p. 300). In these two passages Stoker's contemporary sources are clearly La- marckian, but in a somberly negative way. Both Max Nordau and 0 A. C.

Leonard Wolf (New York: Clarkson N. Potter, 1975), p. 298. VICTORIAN STUDIES 462</page><page sequence="21">JAMES SULLY AND GOTHIC FICTION Cesare Lombroso published widely on the subject of individual and societal degeneration. And the rather explicit connections which Stoker's characters make among mental development in children and primitives, self-centeredness, criminality, and heredity reveal a notable similarity to ideas discussed by Sully. Stoker's scientific references are additional examples of how evolutionist psychology and evolutionist theory generally legitimated traditional Gothic tropes like madness and bestiality. Among other writers, Rudyard Kipling employed what at first appear to be a number of traditional conventions of Gothic fiction. When these conventions occur in combination with references to un- conscious memory, prehuman speechlessness, and unaccountable lapses into violence, however, they modify the conventions and lend them a peculiarly Victorian uncanniness, that is, an atmosphere permeated by the suggestion of evolutionary forces at work- often in sinister and retrogressive ways. Kipling attributed some of these "mysteries" to "the power of the Gods and Devils of Asia,"12 but the effects of such power are clearly depicted as instances of psychological degeneration or hallucinatory resurgences of earlier phases of consciousness. In the Indian tale, "The Mark of the Beast" (1888), the British expatriate Fleete is bewitched by a "mewing" temple leper and quickly begins to exhibit bestial tendencies. He "wolfs" his meat, scares horses by his presence, and when discovered by the narrator exiting his house through a window, "made beast-noises in the back of his throat. He could not answer us when we shouted at him. He spat" (K, IV, 234). To save Fleete, the narrator and Fleete's other friend Strickland de- scend to savagery themselves and torture the leprous "Silver Man" from the temple until he removes the curse. A bit like Utterson or Charles Daraway, these civilized Britons are frighteningly attracted to forms of primitive response even as they seek to overthrow the effects of regression. Kipling also ventured into stories that mixed elements of Pater's and Paget's "resurgence" themes with the more clearly psychical over- tones of illusions. Though a direct link with Sully's work on illusions may be impossible to prove, Sully's book exemplifies the kind of research-on automatism and hypnosis, for instance-upon which depiction of the phenomena in Kipling's story depends. In an updated tale of metempsychosis, "The Finest Story in the World" (1881), a a Complete Works in Prose and Verse of Rudyard Kipling, Burwash edition, 28 vols. (1941; rpt. ed.

SUMMER 1982 463</page><page sequence="22">Ed Block, Jr. normal athletic English youth tells the narrator a story suggesting that the youth had lived earlier as a Greek galley slave. After his muse is coaxed out when the narrator provides him with such appropriate sea tales as Treasure Island (K, V, 176), Mears seems psychologically compelled to add detail upon detail to the story as the "spirit" of the ancient slave moves him. The narrator hopes to profit from tran- scribing more of Mears's recollections, but before he can, Mears falls in love and loses the gift for "automatic" storytelling. The narrator's philosophical conclusion echoes Sully's wistful musings over civiliza- tion's loss of the spirit found in primitives and children. The narrator's conclusion also recalls Olalla's refusal to marry the narrator of that tale lest she bear further degenerate heirs. Kipling's narrator reflects: "Now I understand why the Lords of Life and Death shut the doors so carefully behind us. It is that we may not remember our first and most beautiful wooings. Were this not so, our world would be without inhabitants in a hundred years" (K, V, 203). In its own complex way this passage gives a sinister interpretation to the summary findings of evolutionists from Darwin to Wells. If the human species bears in itself an unconscious recollection of earlier phases of development, that memory must not include remembrance of the greater instinctual free- dom of those phases, lest the self-preservative instinct in living gen- erations be subverted. Once again a specific link between Kipling and Sully's reflec- tions in Studies of Childhood on primitive freedom is probably not possible. This passage, however, clearly evidences an attitude more sober than the Romantic desire for return to a golden age. Regressions or primitive resurgences are not viewed positively, but as inexplicable rifts in the continuity of history. If there is an element of wistfulness, it surfaces in the midst of grave misgivings about such resurgences when they occur in mature individuals. This passage further charac- terizes metempsychosis as a manifestation of inherited memory and gives greater prominence to the power and necessity of self-preserva- tive instincts in the future of the species. These two ideas are aspects of Lamarckian evolutionist thought of which Sully's research is at least one important example. Still another writer attracted to evolutionist psychology was H. G. Wells. His early journalistic writing on scientific subjects shows a shrewd knowledge of the issues in evolutionary thought. An essay, "Zoological Retrogression" (1894), from which the epigraph of this paper is taken, makes explicit the prospect of degradation; the meta- phoric expression of this degradation is the motivating force in many VICTORIAN STUDIES 464</page><page sequence="23">JAMES SULLY AND GOTHIC FICTION of the stories I have considered thus far. In "The Province of Pain" (1894) and "Bye-Products in Evolution" (1895), Wells tries to under- stand the mechanism and some of the puzzling psychological rami- fications of post-Weismannian evolutionist thought. Although in "The Province of Pain" and "The Limits of Individual Plasticity" (1895) he echoes Dr. Jekyll's scientific optimism, suggesting active - even sur- gical - intervention in the course of natural development, in The Island of Dr. Moreau (1895) he depicts the horrors of evil genius, duality, degradation, and insanity which are the result of moral and scientific failures in such surgical experimentation. We might say that Wells, the post-Weismannian evolutionist, questions physiological answers to the problem of deliberate human efforts to improve the race, while the pre-Weismannian Sully had tried to assert a cautious meliorism on the basis of improvements more passively achieved through the opera- tion of Lamarckian inherited characteristics. That Dr. Moreau assumes the possibility of furthering mental evolution is clear from the way he defends his experiments. Turning from an explanation of physiological modifications, he notes the greater ease of performing similar feats with the mind: "'The mental structure is even less determinate than the bodily. In our growing science of hypnotism we find the promise of a possibility of replacing old inherent instincts by new suggestions, grafted upon or replacing the inherited fixed ideas. Very much indeed of what we call moral education is such an artificial modification and perversion of instinct; . And the great difference between man and monkey is in the larynx,' he said, 'in the incapacity to frame delicately different sound- symbols by which thought could be sustained.' "13 This passage unites at least three principal evolutionist ideas seen in Sully's work: that character traits - like self-esteem - are only "grafted upon" older instincts; that these more or less rational traits are the more recent and therefore less stable elements of personality; and that the capacity for speech considered physiologically is a critical issue in evolution. Moreau, obviously a Lamarckian, merely adds an "activist" element to Sully's psychology, basing his optimism on the findings of hypnotists, one of the sources from which Sully himself drew his evidence. Moreau's evil genius is clear from this narration of the rationale and phases of his experiments. Later, among the Beast-Men, the narrator Prendick sees one creature, the Satyr, which for him repre- sents "a gleam of classical memory on the part of Moreau, his face 3 The Island of Dr. Moreau, in The Works of H.

Surveying the total effect of Moreau's experi- mental world, Prendick observes, "Had Moreau had any intelligible object I could have sympathized at least a little with him. I am not so squeamish about pain as that. I could have forgiven him a little even had his motive been hate. But he was so irresponsible, so utterly careless. His curiosity, his mad, aimless investigations, drove him on, and the things were thrown out to live a year or so, to struggle and plunder and suffer; at last to die painfully" (M, II, 123). In these three passages Wells seems clearly intent on depicting in Moreau a variety of the demented genius that we have seen defined by Sully and represented earlier by Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll. Prendick's own acclimation to Moreau's insanity resembles that which affected not only Utterson and Charles Darnaway, but the narrators in a number of the other stories as well: "I say I became habituated to the Beast people, so that a thousand things that had seemed unnatural and repulsive speedily became natural and ordinary to me. I suppose everything in existence takes its colour from the average hue of our surroundings: Montgomery and Moreau were too peculiar and individual to keep my general impressions of humanity well defined" (M, II, 106). Prendick's loss of orientation and resultant sense of blurred distinctions resembles the symptom referred to by Sully as a preliminary to more dangerous kinds of illusion and madness. On Moreau's island Prendick is experiencing a kind of withdrawal from real life which is fraught with the same psychological danger faced by Dr. Jekyll in the isolation of his cabinet or by Utterson, committed single-mindedly to the pursuit of Hyde. Prendick's admis- sion is, furthermore, the author's clearest indictment of the strength, attraction, and danger of such research. And once again, as in "The Mark of the Beast" and elsewhere, habituation culminates in a form of commensurate action. On the death of Moreau, Prendick aids Montgomery in the wanton killing of the now potentially rebellious and violent Beast people (M, II, 136). Having tasted blood, the animals are likely to revert to their former states. Prendick's complicity in the wholesale killing, however, is a clear sign that he has been seriously affected by the psychology and the morality of the island. Taking the tales of Stevenson and Wells together we might say that Dr. Jekyll discovers a lower animal in every human, while Dr. Moreau discovers a lower human in every beast. In this way each writer may be said to depict an implicit threat posed by the evolutionist hypothesis. Like Jekyll, Moreau is a kind of genius, but like those VICTORIAN STUDIES 466</page><page sequence="25">JAMES SULLY AND GOTHIC FICTION Sully described in "Genius and Insanity," he is subject to serious mental and moral flaws. Like Jekyll's, Moreau's experiments yield creatures whose aberrations are metaphors of Moreau's own distorted personality as they are also dire fulfillments of Victorian fears con- cerning the implications of evolution. James Sully's representative psychological investigations of du- ality, regression, illusion, and genius reflect certain evolutionist modifi- cations of late Victorian academic and experimental psychology. Sully's work also illumines both the explicit and the vivid though largely implicit psychological insights that Stevenson and a host of other writers conveyed in their works of Victorian Gothic fiction. At the least we may assert that writers like Sully were seeking to explain in evolutionist terms the same phenomena which many Victorian Gothic fiction writers were treating more apprehensively in their artistic work. Clearer perception of these shared concerns should direct renewed critical attention to additional relations between late Vic- torian psychology and the many psychological tales of which Steven- son's The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is only the best- known example.
