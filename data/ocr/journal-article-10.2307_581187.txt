<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1981-82 INTRODUCTION A year ago I had to preface this section with a report of the severe earth tremors of late February 1981, which centred on the Alkionidhes Islands at the E end of the Gulf of Corinth and were felt very strongly in many parts of Greece, not least Athens itself. This proved the first (and worst) of a long series of tremors. Others have been felt in Athens as recently as January 1982. Although, very fortunately, there were few human casualties in February last, grievous damage to property was caused in some areas. A large proportion ofthe traditionally built houses in Perachora, Plataea and Erythrae was destroyed. Monuments and Museums were not spared; the Museum of Perachora was irreparably damaged (its contents, however, were recovered and removed to the new museum at Isthmia, where broken vases have already been repaired). The saddest archaeological loss of all was suffered at Aegosthena, where the upper part of the almost completely preserved SE tower of the 3rd cent. B.C. fort (cf. e.g. Lawrence, Greek Architecture, pl. 127) fell inwards, destroying in its fall the Mediaeval floors inside. On December 3Ist 1981 Dr N. Yalouris, Inspector-General of the Archaeological Service since 1977, retired. Dr Yalouris has had a most distinguished career in Greek Archaeology both as a scholar and field archaeologist and as an administrator. He has been known for many years for his excavation in Ancient Elis and for the onerous task he undertook in moving the Museum of Olympia, involving the great responsibility for transferring the pedimental sculpture of the Temple of Zeus to a new home, where a fresh arrangement has been made, incorporating the numerous fragments of the pediments that have been identified since the last arrangement was set up. A few weeks after his retirement the new Olympia Museum was formally opened to the public by the Minister of Culture, Miss Melina Mercouri, providing a fitting culmination to Dr Yalouris' career. Though he was succeeded as Inspector- General by Dr George Dondas, previously Ephor of the Akropolis, changes in the structure of the Civil Service led within two months to Dr Dondas' own retirement simultane- ously with that of the Director of the National Museum, Dr G. Konstantinopoulos. At much the same time Dr G. Hourmouziadhes, Ephor of Volos, was appointed to the Chair of Prehistoric Archaeology in the University of Thessaloniki; at the time of writing the consequential changes in the struc- ture of the Archaeological Service have not been completed. Public interest in matters archaeological continued to be great. This was illustrated in summer 1981 by the scale of press reporting on allegations that the condition of the Palace of Minos might be deteriorating and even more vividly later in the year by the press response to the apparently unorthodox manner in which the discovery of the remains of the Stoa Poikile was announced by the Agora Excavations. Discussion in the press of the role of foreign archaeologists in Greece, and of the Foreign Schools generally, was wide and lively though not invariably well-informed. To the pressure upon the Archaeological Service created by the many kinds of development work of which I have written in the past has been added supervision of the construction of the runway for the new Athens airport in the region of Spata in the Mesogeia, an exceptionally heavy extra burden for the Attica Ephorate. This is but one of many examples of extremely rapid - and irreversible - environmental change in Greece, the long term effects of which are increasingly a matter of public anxiety and of government concern. It is widely appreciated that it is not only ancient sites and monuments, and traditional types of urban and rural building that predate reinforced concrete frame construction that are at risk, but except, in the remotest areas, the whole character of the landscape (particu- larly of the littoral), and the survival of the innumerable species of wild life whose presence make Greece of such out- standing ornithological, entomological and botanical interest and importance. The work in the field of the Archaeological Service, of the Archaeological Society and of the Foreign Schools continued on a scale commensurate with that of recent years. As has now been the case for several years, pride of place must be given to N Greece where not only has Professor Manolis Andronikos pursued his very productive investigation of the royal cemetery at Vergina but most rewarding discoveries have continued to be made in the Archaic cemetery of Sindos in the western industrial suburbs of Thessaloniki. Other important finds include an unpillaged tholos tomb of c. I400 B.C. at Kokla in the Argolis. One of the most unexpected finds is the Dark Age hero6n containing a 'royal' burial excavated by a joint Greek- British team at Toumba, Lefkandi, in Euboea, providing a further illustration of the great importance of Euboea to an understanding of early Greek history, to which I referred a year ago. West Crete has sometimes appeared somewhat of an archae- ological Cinderella; discoveries made at Chania during the last two decades have gone far to correct that impression. Recent finds have emphasised the richness of the region in Minoan sites, including a most important LM IIIA tomb at Phylaki and the very unexpected find of an EM tomb at Nea Roumata. A gathering of Greek and foreign scholars took part in May 1981 in a Seminar organised by the Swedish School on the development of Greece during the 8th cent. B.C. Later, at the end of the summer, the I2th Cretological Conference was held at Agios Nikolaos.

CATLING THE STRUCTURE OF ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE Readers of AR may find useful a brief account of the manner in which archaeology is organised in Greece at the present time. In the first place, it must be remembered that all matters per- taining to antiquity are ultimately the responsibility of Government, administered according to the terms of an Antiquities Law. Government at present assigns responsibility for that administration to the Ministry of Culture and Science. The Ministry, in its turn, delegates responsibility to a number of different services and institutions, first and foremost to the Archaeological Service itself. Other institutions involved are the Archaeological Society of Athens, appropriate University Departments and the Foreign Schools in Greece. The Archae- ological Service is a branch of the Civil Service, incorporated in the Ministry of Culture and Science, and thus responsible to the Minister of Culture. Until very recently the Minister has been advised by the Inspector-General, the senior archaeologist in the Service, and by an Archaeological Council composed of senior members of the Service, and senior academic archae- ologists; a number of emeriti also served. The Government elected in October I98I is in the process of revising aspects of the Public Service. The Archaeological Service is included in the changes, not all of which are yet effective; note will be made in the next AR of measures that supersede organisational detail here described. The Archaeological Service is responsible for a wide range of duties. It mans a substantial office organ- isation in the Ministry of Culture in Athens; it mans the many 'ephorias' of antiquities into which the whole country is divided, of which more in a moment. It staffs the Department of Restoration which assumes responsibility for the mainten- ance and repair of standing buildings and substantial excavated remains. It provides the staffs for the Museums of national standing and specialist interest such as the National Museum in Athens and the Epigraphic Museum. It mans the Service's own publication section. With the exception of one or two highly technical and specialised appointments, members of the Archaeological Service are transferable, so that a career will certainly involve service in several different parts of Greece, may take in a spell in one of the National Museums and is quite likely to involve a period of duty engaged on purely adminis- trative duties at the Ministry in Athens. The Mainland, Islands and Crete are divided into 25 Ephorias of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities, 13 Ephorias of Byzantine antiquities and two Ephorias of Recent Monuments. There is also an Ephoria of Underwater Archaeology, an Ephoria of Palaeontology and Speleology and an Ephoria for Antiquities Dealers and Private Collectors. To give an example, responsibility for the Peloponnese is shared between the Ephoria of Argolido- Corinthia (based in Nauplia), the Ephoria of Arkadia-Lakonia (based in Sparta), the Ephoria of Achaea (based in Patras) and the Ephoria of Messenia, Elis and Triphylia (based in Olympia). Each of these divisions is under the archaeological control of an archaeologist, normally of the rank of Ephor, assisted by a number of more junior members of the Service, usually of the rank of Epimelete. Each Ephoria is responsible for the Museums and Collections situated within its territory, as, for instance, the Argolido-Corinthia Ephoria is for the Museums of Nauplia, Epidauros, Argos, Old Corinth, Sikyon, Perachora and Isthmia. The Ephoria also has an overriding responsibility for all the prehistoric and classical buildings and sites within its territory, and is invariably consulted about any matter, minor or major, that concerns its sphere of responsibility. An Ephoria's duty includes the scrutiny of applications to build on or develop areas known to contain ancient remains and the organisation of excavations in advance of such development at known archaeological sites. There is a similar responsibility for the investigation of unexpected discoveries made in the course of whatever kind of development. Naturally, the duty of excavation carries with it the obligation of study and publi- cation of the results of such emergency excavation. The Ephorias are responsible for the supervision of the archae- ological work of those outside the service, Greek and foreign, to whom permission may have been given, through the appropriate channels, either to engage in excavation, to make topographic studies, to examine standing buildings and remains or work upon material in Museum or storerooms. Each Ephoria is required to submit an annual report which, in part at least, will be published in the Chronika (Chr) section of Archaeologikon Deltion (ADelt) for the year in question. These reports include summary accounts of the rescue excavations that each Ephoria has conducted during the period under review, excavations which will in due time be fully published elsewhere, perhaps in a Meletai (Mel) volume ofADelt, perhaps as a monograph. The Archaeological Society of Athens is an independent learned body, founded in I837. Its membership of over 200 includes many of the leading academic archaeologists, more senior members of the Archaeological Service as well as a number of non-professional members who have made notable contribution to the study of Antiquity. Its premises on Leoforos Panepistimiou include a fine library, lecture room and resi- dential accommodation for visiting scholars, Greek and Foreign. Each year the Society undertakes a number of research excavations whose directors are almost invariably its members. Work of great value and importance is sponsored in this fashion; current Archaeological Society (AS) excavations include Rhamnous, Amphipolis, Zakro and Arkhanes. Among the many sites at which the Societyhas excavated in the past are Eleusis, Brauron, Mycenae, Epidauros, Elis, Messene and Thera. The Society has a distinguished publication record. At present, brief preliminary accounts of all the excavations and research projects carried on in the Society's name each year are given in the Ergon tis Archaeologikis Etairias (Ergon) published in the spring of the year following. More extended but still preliminary reports appear, usually after the further interval of a year, in the Praktika tis Archaeologikis Etairias (PAE). Ergon is sparingly illustrated, PAE very much more generously. The Society also publishes its Archaeologikis Ephemeris (AE) every year, continuing a series reaching back to I837. AE contains a variety of papers of which a majority represent definitive publications, whether of an excavation, classes of material or individual objects of particular importance. The Society also maintains a valuable series of monographs, two or three additions to which are made each year. In this series are in- cluded the final reports on major excavations of the Society, exemplified by Sp. Iakovides' Perati: To Nekrotapheion (I969- 70) and G. Mylonas' O taphikos Kyklos B ton Mykenon (I973). While in many cases academic archaeologists and their students undertake excavations under the aegis of the Archaeological Society it may happen that a University Department under- takes a field project in its own name. Current instance of this are the investigations of Dion (Pierias) by the Aristotelian University of Thessaloniki under the direction of D. Pantermalis, and of Vryses Kydonias (W Crete) by the University of Ioannina, under the direction of A. Zoes. There is a very sound tradition in Greece of local antiquarian societies whose interests are spread over the widest spectrum of studies of the past. Most, if not all these societies publish</page><page sequence="3">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, I981-82 5 periodical literature, the contents of which closely reflect the interests of the most energetic members of the societies. Pre- historic and classical archaeology tend not to dominate the activity of these societies, partly because it is unusual for a society as such to undertake field projects (a recent exception to this is the work of the Historical and Archaeological Society of West Crete [Istoriki kai Archaeologiki Etairia Dytikis Kritis] at Vryses Kydonias in I974, published as a monograph of this Society in 1976). The local societies publish much material of interest to Byzantinists, to historians of Greece during the Turkokratia and the early years following inde- pendence; they also form a valuable source for the student of folk history and folk art. In recent years, several of the more dynamic local societies have been responsible for organising conferences or symposia devoted to several aspects of their regional history, subsequently publishing the Acta in their periodicals. For example, the Society for Lakonian Studies (Etairia Lakonikon Spoudon) published in its volumes IV and V (for 1979 and 1980, respectively) the Praktika of the first conference of Lakonian Studies held in I977. These two volumes are indispensable for any serious student of Lakonia. Since the first Foreign School - L'Ecole Francaise d'Arche- ologie - was established in Greece in 840, there has grown up a gradually widening corps of institutes that contribute a strong international element to the study of Greece's past within Greece itself. In approximate order of foundation these bodies consist of a German School (Deutsches Archaologisches Institut), an Austrian School (Osterreichisches Archaologisches Institut), an American (American School of Classical Studies), a British (British School at Athens), an Italian (Scuola Arche- ologica Italiana di Atene), a Swedish (Svenska Institutionen i Athen), a Swiss (Ecole Helvetoise d'Athenes), a Canadian (Canadian Institute of Archaeology in Greece) and an Australian (Australian Institute of Archaeology). There are in addition a Dutch School of Archaeological Surveys and a Belgian Archae- ological Mission. The long established Schools (French, German, Austrian, American, British, Italian and Swedish) all have sizable premises in Athens, including libraries, archives, teaching and lecture rooms. In accordance with the Archae- ological Law, each School may apply for up to three excavation permits in any one year - thus, in theory, there could be 30 excavations a year conducted by the Foreign Schools. In practice, only the French, German, American and British Schools regularly use their privilege to the full and the total number of foreign excavations in a single year rarely amounts to 20. In general, the Schools continue to work at sites with which they have long been associated (French - Argos, Thasos; German - Olympia, Samos, Tiryns; American - Corinth, Athens Agora; British - Knossos, Sparta; Italian - Hagia Triadha, Gortyna). In almost every case there is a particular periodical associated with each School which acts as a regular medium of communication: French - BCH; German - AM and Jahrbuch; Austrian - OJh; American - Hesperia; British - BSA; Italian - Annuario; Swedish - Op.Ath.; Swiss - Antike Kunst. In addition, each School has its own series of monographs wherein the final reports of major projects are published. Some Schools promote the publication of annual summary accounts of overall archaeological activity in Greece: French - 'Chronique des fouilles et decouvertes archeologiques en Grece' in BCH; American - 'News Letter from Greece', in AJA; British - 'Archaeology in Greece' in AR. In addition, Foreign Schools are required to submit annual reports on the course of their field projects for publication in the Chr section of ADelt. From time to time collaborative projects take place whereby a member of the Archaeological Service and a representative of a Foreign School jointly direct an excavation (for instance, the Greco-Swedish excavation at Chania, the Greco-British at Lefkandi, Toumba). Ad hoc arrangements are made for the publication, interim and definitive, of such excavations. Very occasionally, special arrangements are made to allow a foreign mission to run a field project out of series with the permit allocation system within which operates the School of the country in question. Some such arrangement has enabled a 'German Archaeological Excavations' group to work in Thessaly (especially at Pefkakia and Demetrias) for a number of years. The excavation by the American School of the ancient Agora of Athens is itself a special project outside that School's normal programme. RECENT PUBLICATIONS The sources from which this report is derived are explained in previous accounts (AR 1977-78, 3-4; AR 1978-79, 3; AR 1979-80, 3-4 - see also AR 1980-81, 3-4). The slower pace of Greek periodical publication reported last year continued, so that the arrears of some areas of reporting (in particular, the Chr of ADelt) may soon become a cause for concern. To begin with the Archaeological Service's publications, three parts of Archaeologika Analecta ex Athenon (AAA) have appeared - XII pts I and 2 (for 1979) and XIII pt I, for 1980. Archaeologikon Deltion (ADelt) 31, Meletai (Mel) for 1976 was published in 1980, but only came to hand after the last AR had gone to press. The final volume of ADelt 29 Chronika (Chr) - B3 -, describing work of 1973 and 1974 - was published in I98I. The Archaeological Society published Archaeologike Ephemeris (AE) for 1979 during 1981. It also issued two volumes of its Praktika (PAE) - for 1978 and 1979, providing more detailed interim reports of its excavations in those years than those published earlier in the Society's two issues of its Ergon for the same years (use of which was made in AR 1979-8o and AR 198o-81 respectively). It also published Ergon 1980. In the past year the Archaeological Service has published no. 28 in its monograph series - S. Drougou and Y. Touratsoglou, Ellenistikoi Laxefti Taphi Veroias (Athens I980). Note should also be taken of I. Demakopolou's Anthologia Ellenikis Architektonikis: E Katoikia stin Ellada apo to 15° stou 20° Aiona published by the Ministry of Culture and Science (1981). The Archaeological Service was responsible for publishing K. Demakopoulou and D. Konsola's Archaeologiko Mouseio tis Thivas (1981), of which an English version appeared almost simultaneously. This is an exemplary Guide and a welcome addition to the archaeological literature on Boeotia. The Archaeological Society added no. 96 to its series of monographs - A. Pasadaios, I Poli tou Vosporou: Syntomos Systematikos Odigos. There was a comparable slowing down in the appearance of other Greek periodical literature; several of the publications referred to in AR 1980-81, 4 had not been issued at the time of writing. Among periodicals of general interest to prehistorians there have been published Anthropologika 2 (for 1981), and, to classical archaeologists and ancient historians, Archaeognosia 1.2 (Dec. 1980). Of general interest to Byzantinists are vols 3 and 4 (1981) of Symmneikta, published by the Centre for Byzantine Research, National Research Foundation and Byzantina Io (1980) published by the Centre for Byzantine Research, Philosophical School of the Aristotelian University of Thessaloniki. The Deltion 23 (for 1980) of the Society for the History and Ethnology of Greece was published. Balkan Studies 21.1 (1980) was published by the Institute for Balkan Studies. Regional periodicals that appeared include Pelopon-</page><page sequence="4">6 H. W. CATLING nesiaka IA' (Society for Peloponnesian Studies), Lakonikai Spoudai 5 (Society for Lakonian Studies), Archeion Euboikon Meleton KF (Society for Euboean Studies), Makedonika 20 (for 1980) (Society for Macedonian Studies), Amaltheia Pt 46 (1981) (Society for the History and Folk History of the Nome of Lasithi). A welcome is to be extended to a new periodical, the semi-popular Archaiologia, to be published four times a year from 1981. The first part contained an attractive miscellany of well illustrated papers, mainly of a general nature, written by established scholars. Of slightly different nature is a second new periodical, Anagennesis: Papyrologiki Ephemeris published in Athens with the imprimatur of an international editorial board. The Greek Press provides a useful source of very recent archaeological news, including reporting of very high quality (in particular the articles of A. Kalogeropoulou in Kathemerini). Since the basis for many of these reports is in official com- muniques issued by the Ministry of Culture and Science, the essential facts are reliable. (A collection of recent cuttings is maintained in the British School at Athens where it may be consulted). Once more, my warm thanks are due to the Directors of British School field projects who have allowed reports of their I98I work to appear in these pages; I am equally grateful to the Directors of the other Foreign Schools in Greece and those directing excavations in the names of those Schools for sending me reports and illustrations; they make an invaluable contri- bution to the interest and topicality of'Archaeology in Greece'. I am again indebted to the Greek Archaeological Service and the Archaeological Society - and, beyond those bodies, members of the Service and of the Society - for permitting me to publish many illustrations for which they are responsible. I have been helped in the preparation of this report by Mrs Jacqui MacGillivray and by Miss Deryn Howard; the latter typed much of a tiresome manuscript. ATHENS AND ATTICA National Museum. Several publications concerning the Sculpture Collection have appeared. S. Karouzou has published the fragments of the A stela of the two brothers, the greater part of which is in New York, with other fragments in Berlin. The addition of the Athens pieces permit the original exact height to be calculated - 4.234 m. The ground is painted red; the date of the change from red to blue as the ground colour in funerary reliefs is discussed. (ADelt 3I [I976] Mel 9-22; French summary, 353-8). A. Datsouli-Stavrides has published a battered marble head NM 3588 from Atalanti, identifying it as a portrait of the Emperor Claudius; she suggests a headless draped figure, NM 1759, may be a statue of the same Emperor. (AAA XIII [I980] Io9-I8). She also publishes NM 708, from Thera, a worn figure of a young woman of early Antonine date (Fig. I). Her hairstyle resembles portraits of Faustina the Elder. (AAA XII [1979] 280-6). She has also studied a number of marble heads, including three of women, nos. 456 (Fig. 2), 4914 and 4917, of early Severan style. A very fine portrait (NM 330) of a young man, late Severan, is also published (Fig. 3). A second male portrait (NM 459) is dated to the period of the Tetrarchs (A.D. 280-306). (AAA XII [I979] I09-27). The same scholar in AE 1979, 226-30 examines three female heads (NM 523 (Fig. 4), 566 and 1887) of the Severan period. She also has discussed NM 689, from Mantinea, which, following earlier authorities, she identifies as a portrait statue of Antinoos of the type of Hermes; the head NM 518 is cited as very similar. (Archaeog- nosia I.2, 345-8). Fig. i E. Waters discusses an ?early Antonine fragmentary sculp- tured gravestone of a woman composed of pieces in the NM (237) and the Agora. She also publishes NM 54+231, frag- ments of a grave relief of a woman holding a sistrum of the early 3rd cent. A.D. (AAA XII [1979] 215-2I). In the Vase Collection S. Karouzou has discussed and illus- trated the vases attributable to the Fauvel Painter (NM 1571, 1572 (Fig. 5), 14514 and 17552) as part of a wider treatment of Fauvel, French consul in Athens. (AAA XII [1979] I27-49). From the Epigraphic Museum M. F. Billot has published a collection of architectural terracottas of uncertain provenance (but resembling others from Athens and Attica), of 6th cent. B.C.-3rd cent. A.D. (ADelt 31 [1976] Mel 87-135). For the Numismatic Museum M. Oikonomidou has published a summary account of its work since its foundation in 1829. (AE 1979, Parart i-Io). A hoard of I86 Frankish deniers tournois, apparently found in Attica and surrendered to the Numismatic Museum in I963, has been published by M. Krikou-Galanis. Issues are included of the Principate of Achaea, the Dukes of Athens, the Barony of Karytaina, the Sebasto- crators of Great Wallachia, the Despots of Epirus and the Courts of Provence. The hoard was buried in the period 1318- 33, though the majority of coins date to the late 13th and early I4th cents A.D. (ADelt 31 [1976] Mel 326-50). From the Goulandris Collection B. Intzessiloglou has published a small marble head of Herakles, possibly unfinished, that finds its closest parallel in the Oxford Herakles. Both are scaled down versions of the Herakles of Myron. (AAA XII [I979] 93-103).</page><page sequence="5">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, I981-82 7 Fig. 2 Fig. 3 Athens: Akropolis. The Greek Press carried reports of additional conservation required at the Parthenon as the result of the February earth tremors, the most severe to which the building had been subjected since I894. It was also reported that special measures will be taken where it is necessary to dis- mantle parts of the building in the process of restoration. The programme is expected to continue at least into 1983. At the Erechtheion work is very far advanced; the copies of the Caryatids were all due to have been set in place by the middle of the year. (Vima I3.3.8I and, in fuller detail, Nea 7.8.81). Athens City: Agora. The excavations of the American School of Classical Studies continued in 1981 under the direc- tion of L. Shear, who reports as follows (from a more extended account; the help of J. Camp II is acknowledged) (cfi AR 198o-81, 4-5). 'Excavations were conducted exclusively on the property at 13 Hadrian St formerly occupied by the old flour mill. The season began with the exploration of a group of private houses. The major topographical landmark was a N-S street entering the market square at its N-W corner, whence it continued S in front of the major civic buildings along the W side of the square, in use from C into Turkish times, and all structures in the area bore some relation to it. 'The Painted Stoa. Exploration of the area on the E side of the street brought to light the W end of a colonnaded building of the 5th cent. B.C., which, from its massive scale, its superb construction, and its orientation, must have been one of the most important early C buildings in the Agora (Fig. 6). The principal colonnaded facade of the stoa faced SE on to the market square; and its peculiar orientation NE-SW was determined by the broad double channel of the Eridanos River which runs nearly parallel to the S, and must already have been canalized into a great cloaca by EC (Fig. 7). 'The steps and foundations are well preserved in hard poros limestone (Fig. 6). Enough of the building has been cleared to reconstruct its appearance with some accuracy (Fig. 8). Many fragments of Doric columns were found, and these together with elements of the triglyph frieze and the mutular cornice assure its reconstruction as a Doric stoa. That these scattered architectural fragments should be assigned to the building is indicated by a complete block of the triglyph frieze which was measured on the same module as the steps (I.oo m.). This block also shows that marble metope slabs originally slid into slots between the poros triglyphs. The stoa had three steps along its facade beneath the columns and four returning along the W end where the ground sloped lower. The end and rear walls were originally of solid masonry, and the stoa had no rooms behind the deep, open colonnade. Numerous pieces of unfluted Ionic column shafts are to be assigned to the interior order, of which the foundation for the westernmost column was found. A line of poros blocks parallel to the back wall supported a broad bench which ran the entire length of the stoa.</page><page sequence="6">8 H. W.

'. , . . ' W.B.D.,JR. -1981 Fig. 8 shows that the stoa was still standing in the second half of the 5th cent. A.D. The pillaging of the walls and steps, visible at the NW comer, did not occur until the 6th cent. 'Of the two stoas known to have stood on the N side of the Agora, the Stoa of the Herms and the Painted Stoa, only the latter shows a perfect correspondence between the ancient literary references and the new archaeological evidence. All of the evidence points to the identification of the new building as the Stoa Poikile (Fig. 9). Fig. 9 'The most striking movable find of the season was a marble head of a herm, found just above the W steps of the Stoa Poikile in a Byz wall of the 9th or Ioth cent. A.D. The massive head is exquisite LA work near the end of the 6th cent. B.C. Several fragments of the shafts, bases, and curly locks of other herms also came to light W of the Painted Stoa, while three small square bases, placed at the SW corer of the stoa at the time of construction probably also carried herms. In the area of the Royal Stoa, fragments of 25 herms were found. The discovery of so many herms associated with the Royal Stoa and the Stoa Poikile bears out the literary testimony that the herms extended from the two stoas. 'The Early Altar. On the W of the N-S street, across from the Stoa Poikile, was found a very well-preserved altar, the size and position of which suggest that it must belong to one of the major sanctuaries of the Agora (Fig. 7). The entire base and three of the six marble slabs forming the sides of the altar were preserved in their original positions. The altar incorporates parts of earlier structures which had previously occupied the same spot. The base, composed of slabs of blue Acropolis limestone, could be dated to the end of the 6th cent. B.C. Close examination of the altar itself, however, showed that the marble slabs were a later replacement for a slightly wider structure. 'The construction of the altar in its second phase was with- out ready parallel. Marble slabs were set on the old limestone base and clamped together. Inside this rectangle was set a row of roughly-cut slabs of poros of which three survive. Since these served no apparent purpose, they were probably archi- tectural elements of some older monument placed here because they were venerated in themselves. They were carefully cut down to carry the (lost) marble crowning course of the altar, which would have formed the altar table itself; it was probably decorated with a delicate moulding like that carved on the base of the marble orthostats. After construction of the altar had been completed the spaces between the poros slabs were packed with earth and ash gathered from a dump in the sanctuary itself. All the packing from inside the altar was washed in a water flotation sieve, and masses of small burnt bones from the sacrificial animals offered to the deity were recovered. 'c. 410-400 B.C. the level of the A sanctuary needed to be raised. A row of poros blocks was set along the W side of the altar to carry a pavement of marble slabs on which the offici- ating priest stood. The level of the sanctuary seems to have been raised again in the Ist cent. B.C., for a deep earth filling datable to that period was found on all sides of the altar. It was not possible to determine whether the altar ceased to be used at this time, although it seems likely that it continued to func- tion through the R period. If so, the altar and sanctuary should perhaps be attributed to one of those deities whose shrines Pausanias saw in the area. He mentions sanctuaries of Aphrodite Ourania and Hermes Agoraios, and either would be appro- priate tenants of the newly found altar. 'Late Roman Remains. During the subsequent DA and the EByz period grading of the whole area and later deep foun- dations destroyed the LR layers almost entirely, so that the remains consisted only of the lowest concrete foundations far beneath the floor levels of the buildings. Nevertheless, the foundations for two distinct structures could be identified. The more interesting was a colonnade running E-W and lining the N of the LR street which led across the N side of the Agora to the Library of Hadrian. Foundations for a matching colonnade along the S side of the same street had been uncovered ten years ago further E above a basilica of the 2nd cent. A.D. The new foundations proved to be exactly parallel to those found earlier, and they confirm the existence of a major colonnaded avenue, erected A.D. 450-500 and oriented with relation to the main entrance of the Library of Hadrian, lying some I65 m. E of the C Agora. The colonnade on the N side of the street seems to have been interrupted for part of its length by the old faSade of the Painted Stoa which evidently still stood in the 2nd half of the 5th cent. A.D. 'Partly built into the concrete foundations for the LR colonnade was a complete marble stele bearing a HL ephebic decree of 177/6 B.C. The LR structure consisted of the SE comer of an enormous building, probably a bath. This lay to the W of the N-S street and N of the street stoa, which may have formed a fasade for the bath building. Similar concrete foundations had been found in the I96os by the Greek Archae- ological Service in two lots on Hastings Street and on Theseion Street, to the N and W respectively of the area now being explored. Although these foundations almost certainly belong to the same building, the structure was too large and too little of its area has been uncovered to attempt any reconstruction of its overall plan. 'Byzantine Houses. The area currently under investigation n : I z:', i9|i _eq .Ij</page><page sequence="8">To H. W. CATLING seems to have been almost wholly abandoned during the DA, from the Slavic invasions of the 58os until the development of the MByz town in the gth cent. Only the slightest traces of a structure (?farmhouse), could be dated within this period of abandonment. The residential district which came to occupy the area from the 9th through the I2th cents A.D. was built up on both sides of the old N-S street. Several rooms belonging to at least four Byz houses were investigated and clear evidence was uncovered for their continuous habitation and successive remodelings from the end of the gth cent. until the end of the i2th. The most distinctive architectural features came to light in the houses to the E where one room, at the level of the IIth cent., was equipped as a kitchen with hearth, oven, and a deep pithos, or storage bin. In this area was a household well in the courtyard of one dwelling. It was covered with a re-used R marble well-head; its excavation revealed that it had been dug in the Ioth cent., but the filling from its final period of use, datable to the late I2th cent., produced a considerable group of water jars and other household pottery, of which the latter was evidently discarded when the well ceased to be used. Because such wells form the best kind of closed deposits, substantial samples (25 %) of the mud from the well filling were washed in the flotation sieve to retrieve remains of organic materials.' Athens City: General. It is hoped that ADelt 30 B' Chr will be available for use in AR 1982-83, allowing the account of Service excavations in the city (last given in AR 1979-8o, 5-12) to be brought up to date. A discussion of IG I3 138 (I79, I2 79) is published by M. Jameson in Archaeognosia 1.2 (1980) 214-236. In 1982 the Greek Press reported the discovery, close to the Monument of Lysikrates, of the foundations of the enclosure wall of a choregic monument. Three other bases had been found here earlier. (Press of 28.1.82). On the initiative of his widow, Mrs A. Charitonidou, a report on an excavation of S. I. Charitonides in 1956 at Ay. Dimitrios Loumbardiaris just outside the 'Dipylon above the Gates' (on the city's W perimeter) has been published in AE I979. The excavation, on the S side of the road that passed through this gate in the diateichisma towards Piraeus, was not extensive but supplements the detailed study of the area by H. A. Thompson and R. L. Scranton, Hesperia xii (1943) 269-383. Before the construction of the diateichisma in the late 4th cent. B.C. this area of Athens (the ancient Koile) was covered with houses. The excavation identified in turn the floor level of the 4th cent. buildings, the destruction horizon of the buildings (presumably the consequence of constructing the diateichisma), the insertion into the destruction of a burial containing material of the early 3rd cent. B.C. (including a fine terracotta statuette of a seated Eros holding a bunch of grapes in one hand and another fruit on his thigh (Fig. Io)). Over the destruction level were the remains of numerous pyres containing a rich assemblage of objects (including many fragments of West Slope ware and Megarian bowls including moulds (Fig. II)) dating to the 3rd and 2nd cents B.C. Kerameikos. The German School in I98I continued its Fig. ii Fig. io Fig. 13 Fig. 12</page><page sequence="9">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1981-82 II excavation under the direction of U. Knigge at three points. In the cemetery itself, in the course of further work on the plot of the Messenian family, part of the so-called 'corner terrace' was uncovered, and a large number of EHL burials found. The N boundary of the Demetria and Pamphile plot is coterminous with the S side of a 2.0 m. wide passage that separates the 'comer terrace' from the adjacent burial plots. This passage had been made over a number of graves c. 400-350 B.C.; after the destruction of the cemetery in 338 B.C. it was already covered over and out of use. In the consequent fill were found a number of grave monuments displaced by the destruction, doing duty as hard-core; these included a marble funerary lekythos with four figures (Fig. 12). Just within the city walls, in the area of the Sacred Gate at the Eridanos, part of the stream bed was cleared, with embank- ment walls of the 3rd cent. B.C. filled up in the 6th cent. A.D. Below the embankments a street surface of the time of Konon was identified. The examination of House Z immediately S of the Sacred Gate was largely finished. It is clear that the plan of the earliest building (c. 475-450 B.C.) was very different from that of its successor. In some cases its walls retained their red plaster covering, while numerous rf vases and a cooking pot were found on the stone floors. In some rooms the deposits below the level of the earliest house could be examined. This showed that the area later occupied by House Z had been used for bronze working, probably immediately after the building of the city walls. This activity in its turn had covered over earlier grave plots, from one of which probably came a fine rf bell- krater fragment (A - reveller (Fig. I3)). Athens: City Environs. The Greek Press reported that a variety of finds had been made in the National Garden at the projected site for a new building for the Presidential Guard, including a mosaic floor, six pre-R tombs and a grave stela. (Mesemvrini 20.1.82). Great interest was aroused in 1981 by the discovery on Leophoros Olgas of two tombs of 5th cent. B.C. date belonging to a known cemetery beside the ancient road leading SE from the city towards the coastal demes. Both graves were con- structed of slabs and contained a single skeleton. In one were four lekythoi and some fragments of wood. In the second, thought of as 'the poet's grave', were a roll of papyrus (in a poor state of preservation), remains of a tortoise lyre, a possible flute of wood, and a bronze instrument, probably a stylus. At the time of writing, hopes of rendering the papyrus legible are slight. (Vima 26.5.81). Piraeus. The Archaeological Museum was opened to the public in June 198I; the display is notable for its sculpture, arranged under the direction of B. Petrakos. (Kathemerini 18.6.81). A. Andreiomenou has described the gift of antiquities to the Museum by Mrs A. Nomidou, including an Attic rf hydria - Zeus with thunderbolt, four women; c. 440 B.C. (Fig. 14). (ADelt 29 Chr 1008). The Greek Press reported the discovery of the remains of a R public building at the site for the new Law Courts (the blocks confined by Konstantine II, Philellenon, Skeuzi and Leosthenes Sts). Public interest in the future of the area after excavation was great; it was suggested that it should become an archae- ological park. (Mesemvrini 18.3.81; Avgi 20.6.81). Eleusis. In preparation for a definitive architectural history of the Eleusis shrine, G. Mylonas andJ. Travlos (AS) undertook a number of supplementary investigations on the W circuit of Fig. 14 the Peisistratid fortifications, starting from the Asty Gates, and following the wall for IIo m. to the steep acropolis summit (Fig. I5). The previously known tower in the centre of this section was cleared again, with gate to the N, part of the diateichisma to the S. (According to IG II2 1672 of 329/8 B.C. the diateichisma began at the House of the Kerykes and extended W to the gateway 'd&amp;aravTLKpu To 5o oAiXou', which is surely to be identified with this gate SW of the Asty Gates). The rectangular space between the Peisistratan fortification and the diateichisma is to be identified as the ancillary area for the sanc- tuary. From the acropolis summit onwards no trace remains of the wall until the Stadium Gates are reached at the SW corner of the circuit; the suggested line for its course in the missing section must be very close to the original. It is conjec- tured that the site of the Megarian Gates must have been at the W angle of the circuit; the ancient road leading down in this direction W from the Acropolis was cleared for a distance. (Ergon 1980, 22-4). Fig. 15</page><page sequence="10">I2 H. W. CATLING Trachones. 0. Tzachou-Alexandri resumed excavation of the theatre at Trachones (identified as the deme Euonymon), constructed in the mid-4th cent. B.C. Its abandonment after 150 years seems to have been due to continued deposition of detritus in winter storms. (Ergon I980, 24-5). Kantza. The Greek Press reported the discovery of a tomb of the 4th cent. B.C., containing an inhumation in a marble sarcophagus, accompanied by a lekythos. (Akropolis 18.3.8i). Spata. The Greek Press called attention to the archaeological importance of the area of the Mesogeia chosen for the site of the runway of the new Athens airport. At the time of writing little information had been published concerning finds made. (Nea 30.5.81). (AR 1977-78, I3-I5; AR 1978-79, 6-7; AR 1979-80, I7-19). He writes:- 'Work in I98I concentrated on uncovering the plan of the N courtyard and clearing its rooms (Fig. 17) (lettered on plan in the order of discovery). 'The E range of the North Court was formed by two rooms, the southern (VII, cleared in 1979) comprising two compart- ments, the larger with central 'carpet' of litharge-cement and four orthostat slabs (AR 1979-80, 17, fig. 34), and the northern a square room (A) with thin white plaster on its walls and an earthen floor but no built features. O s to is '; Lss I Fig. 17 Fig. I8 Fig. I6 Laurion: Soureza. I. Tsaimou has discussed the arrange- ment of a silver-lead industrial site (Fig. 16) excavated during 1977-78 by the Attica Ephorate in conjunction with the Metallurgical Laboratory of the Polytechnic. A room, part of this complex of c. 350-300 B.C. (which may, in the light of an inscription, be associable with Simos Paianieus - Crosby, Hesperia xix [I950] 213, 216, 225, 228), has been identified as an andron fitted for five couches, very unexpected in the design of such an industrial complex. It seems subsequently to have been put to other uses. (AAA XII [1979] 15-23). Laurion: Agrileza. J. E. Jones, for the British School in collaboration with the Archaeological Service, conducted a final season of excavation at the silver-mine washery and works compound in the upper Agrileza Valley, Laurion 'The N range comprised seven rooms, terraced deeply into the hillside (Fig. 18). The NE room (B) occupied the full depth of the N range and was by far the largest room in the com- pound (I3.60 x 9.0 m. int.); it had thickly plastered walls and a rock and earth floor but again no features, in the three- quarters of its area excavated, other than two column-bases, one square and one round, on its longer axis. Next came two smaller rooms with rather higher floor-levels, one (C) very small and the other (D, part excavated) over twice its size. Both were entered from the room (E) adjacent to the W. Room E was much larger but had a small room (F) built in its NE quarter, apparently an afterthought as its S wall curved in to abut awkwardly against the door-jamb of room D and its W wall made a butting joint against the rear wall, and the socles of both were higher than those of the side walls of room E. The intrusive room F had soft white plaster on its inner</page><page sequence="11">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, I98I-82 13 walls and a blocking raft of stones in the doorway, a still later afterthought. Features in the E half of Room E included a short round column (perhaps a support for a work-surface), and an underground drinking-water cistern. Room E was entered from the court through a S door (with stone steps out- side) and itself gave access not only to rooms C and D but also to a narrow passage at the rear of the big cistern behind Washery C. From that one entered two square rooms which occupied a space equal to the width of the washery-cistern wing of the compound. Room H was an open room with a rather poor cement floor and walls lined with thick plaster laid on in three layers. Room I had a floor of cement generally so perished that only the gravel aggregate remained. Its most notable feature was a Filtration Cistern (4.50 m. in diameter and c. 3.40 m. deep) set rather off-centre and doubtless used to clarify water intended to pass on into the bigger cistern next to the washery. The inflow into Room I was by a channel running down through the W wall from a concreted surface outside. 'In the North Court itself features revealed included (left to right on plan): (I) An overflow conduit from the under- ground cistern in Room E, emerging from below the SE corner of that room and running obliquely across to the middle of the yard, perhaps once to another cistern which had col- lapsed. (2) The steps leading up to the entrance of Room E. (3) A row of 14 cup-like and rock-cut holes extending along the facade of the N range, five of them enclosed within the walls of a shallow room, possibly a lean-to addition (Fig. 19). Fig. 19 'Finds included a small stack of Laconian roof cover-tiles in Room E, roof tile fragments from elsewhere, a handful of small finds (two small bronze coins, a bead, spindlewhorls and loomweights, and iron and lead fragments), and more pot- sherds representing bg, plain, coarse, and combed wares generally supporting the 4th cent. B.C. date previously proposed. A very small quantity of rippled ware of Roman date was recovered from further localised clearing in the S court.' after which there is a gap in the pottery sequence until LH IIIB. The significance of the LH IIIC pottery found is un- certain. It has been established that iron ore was extracted and worked in the A period before intensive lead mining began. Earlier remains near the mine have largely been obliterated by the large scale workings from the 4th cent. B.C. which in- volved the construction of washeries and cisterns and the dumping of refuse. After a hiatus of seven-eight centuries the area was again occupied in the 4th-6th cents A.D., which could imply renewed industrial activity. Rhamnous. Several publications appeared in 1981 on the results of B. Petrakos' resumed investigation of this site on behalf of the AS (AR 1978-79, 7; AR 1979-8o, 16-17; AR 1980-81, 6). His work so far has primarily concerned the buildings of the sanctuary and the funerary complexes beside the sacred way. In AE 1979 Petrakos gave an admirable sum- mary of the results of his work since 1975. Descriptions are given of the funerary periboloi on the S sacred way, including that of Diophantides and two anonymous monuments 500 m. S of the shrine. The work of collecting the scattered archi- tectural members from the buildings of the sanctuary is described. The pieces were planned in situ prior to their removal to a store nearby; study has failed to detect any system in their Thorikos. The Belgian Mission, under the direction of H. Mussche (Ghent) and P. Spitaels (Ghent) have reported on their work at Thorikos during 1980. These results are of particular interest for the history of metal exploitation. It has, for example, been confirmed that lead and silver were extracted in Mine No. 3 during the 3rd millennium B.C. Traces of hammering have been found along the entire length of two veins, still covered by a hard red deposit datable to EH. Thereafter mining continued uninterruptedly until early MH, Fig. 20</page><page sequence="12">14 H. W. CATLING arrangement, thanks to the interference by earlier excavations or treasure seekers. A large building E of the sanctuary with two small projecting rooms has been identified from surface remains: the main building may have been the strategeion and the rooms the phylakteria referred to in the decree ADelt 22 (1967) 38-52 concerning Epichares strategos tis paralias at Rhamnous. On the N sacred way several periboloi have been studied and some new restorations of their appearance pro- posed. These include the periboloi of Diogeiton, of Phanokrates, of And ..... of Pytharchos. From the latter come many fragments of the grave relief from the funerary naiskos which marked this family grave (Fig. 20). The pediment is inscribed with the four names: Epicharides Pytharch(ou); Paramonos Fig. 22 Fig. 21 (Pyth)archou; Timokleia; Pytharcho(s) (Pyth)onos (Oi)ethe(n). Of two stelae belonging to the peribolos, one, sculptured, was inscribed 'Pytharchos Pythokriti' (Fig. 21). Also identified was the peribolos of Phanokrates, associable with which is a particularly fine stela carved with the representation of a grave lekythos, of excellent quality, datable c. 380 B.C. (Fig. 22). Work also concentrated on the peribolos of Hierokles, of which restored drawings are published. Petrakos has also published excerpts from the diary of J. P. G. Derring, director of the excavation by the Society of Dilettanti in 1813, now in the British Museum. Petrakos has also published (or republished) 67 inscriptions from the site. (AE 1979, i-8i). A detailed study of the painted architectural ornament on the surviving members of the Temple of Nemesis has been made by K. Eliakis, combining information from the original publication of the Society of Dilettanti with detailed examin- ation of the material. The designs of I6 point-stars in the roof panels, using blue and yellowish ochre, are both elaborate and delicate. The decoration is considered typical of Attic 5th cent. painted architectural ornament. (ADelt 31 [1976] Mel 244-259). During the AS' 1980 season under Petrakos' continued direction work in the N part of the shrine, where trenches excavated by V. Stais were cleaned, showed the fill of the temple terrace to consist of unwrought stone. At the NE corer evidence was found for the existence of a stoa-like building. More fragments of the base of the cult image came to light, together with pieces of its sculptural adornment. A very large part of the entablature of the 5th cent. temple of Nemesis has now been reassembled in a building constructed for the purpose on site (Fig. 23). (Ergon 1980, 25-6). Fig. 23 A. Kalogeropoulou published details communicated by B. Petrakos of his work on the study and reconstruction of the base of the statue of Nemesis (see also AR 1980-81, 6). Three faces of the base carried relief sculptures; the fourth was plain; the two side faces each had three figures, the right certainly also had a horse and possibly the left as well. Figures at each corner belong more to the front face. Pausanias' description refers to fewer figures than actually existed and he gives a mixed account of figures from all three faces. The base was constructed of two marble blocks. The crowning element is of Eleusinian marble. The base was set up first and the statue subsequently erected upon it. Reconstructions previously proposed for the form of the base are misleading; new finds are required before a reliable reconstruction is possible. A marble table firmly fixed in the floor stood in front of the cult figure, doubtless to keep visitors at a distance. (Kathemerini 22.3.81). Oropos. In Epigraphika tou Oropou (Athens 1980) B. Petrakos has published a valuable addendum to his O Oropos kai to Hieron tou Amphiaraou (Athens 1968), chiefly inscriptions from the ancient site (moder Skala Oropou), many concerned with unknown cults (in particular of the nymph Halia, who may = Leukothea, in honour of whom games were celebrated in the 3rd cent. B.C.) and sanctuaries belonging to the town. ISLANDS OF THE SARONIC GULF Aegina. The new Museum of Aegina was opened in October 1981. (Eleftheri Ora 7.I0.8I). H. Walter has summarised some of the results of excavations in 1979-80 at the Kolonna Hill (German text) whose objective has been to investigate the earlier history of the sanctuary. The remains of a well found E of the temple were examined and interpreted as part of the furnishing of a sanctuary - an 'altar well'. The pottery from the well - chiefly Ioth and 9th cent. cups and skyphoi - will have been used in the cult. Close N of the well was found a G building, thought not to be the shrine, whose remains were probably either removed or built</page><page sequence="13">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, I981-82 I5 over by the LA temple or its immediate predecessor. Close to the 'altar well' a second well was found containing Myc sherds, handmade SMyc cups and several PG vases. This find suggests cult activity as early as Myc times and also continuity of cult. On the S slope of the hill part of the rock was un- covered, which here descends in three terraces. The earliest structure here is the fortification wall of the MH town (Level X). On the upper terrace are the settings for the temenos wall of the earlier sanctuary (to which belonged the predecessor of the existing temple). Three walls lie on the third terrace, in front of which are the remains of carefully constructed build- ings whose back walls are set against a cutting in the rock (Fig. 24). Their identity - cult rooms? priests' houses? shops? - is yet to be determined. A further question not yet answered is the location of the temenos boundary of the LA shrine. On the N side of the hill removal of debris from the acropolis wall has shown that there are several phases of construction.

Sampson has published a recension of the catalogue of PR sites in Euboea, to which he has made numerous additions during fieldwork from 1974-78. Some concern sites already identified (notably L. H. Sackett et al., BSA Ixi [I966] 38-II0), others describe previously unknown sites. The majority of new records are of N and EH date; of great potential interest is the report of many EH I sites.

In AR 1980-81, 7 it was reported that a substantial DA building had come to light in I980 during building operations and that subsequently the owner of the plot had destroyed a large part of what had been found. During 1981, at the invitation of the Archaeological Service, the British School participated in the first season of Hellenic- British excavation jointly directed by E. Touloupa and M. R. Popham, with the assistance ofL. H. Sackett. The results were widely reported in the Greek Press (e.g. A. Kalogeropoulou in Kathemerini 23.5.81); with the approval of the Greek authorities the following account is given by M. R. Popham. 'A further seven tombs and two pyres were found in the Fig. 27</page><page sequence="14">16 H. W. CATLING cemetery area previously jointly published in Lefkandi I: The Iron Age. The new tombs, mostly of the LPG and SPG I stages (Fig. 29a) (i.e. Ioth and early gth cents B.C.) were particularly interesting in adding to the number of Near Eastern objects known to have reached Lefkandi (Fig. 25a,b); they included faience vases in the shape of a duck, bunches of grapes, a pomegranate and a lion. A faience ring with a bezel depicting the ram-headed Egyptian deity may well be an Egyptian import as is likely in the case of two bronze vessels, a jug with lotus-bud handle and an incised situla. There is some fine jewellery (Fig. 26). A pair of bronze wheels may have originated in Cyprus (Figs. 27, 28). One rich tomb, T39, contained several Attic LPG vases including one with a bird painted under each handle (Fig. 29b). In the same burial was a vase of uncertain origin with a strutted handle terminating in a boot (Fig. 30). Two tombs contained vases imported from the N, Thessaly or Macedonia. 'The main purpose of the excavation was to investigate a building revealed by tht Archaeological Service early in I980 Fig. 30 Fig. 28 Fig. 31 in test trenches made following an application to build. This part of the ancient building was subsequently illegally destroyed by bulldozing. Indications observed at the time of discovery suggested that the building was a temple of the PG period (c. Iooo B.C.). 'The excavations just completed have confirmed the date of the building which appears to be a heroon rather than a temple. Sunk some 2.5 m. below the floor was a tomb in two com- partments; in one were the bones of a warrior wrapped in Fig. 29a, b</page><page sequence="15">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, I981-82 I7 ............................

Relief figures of hunters and animals are depicted on the rim of the amphora while the cloth was in such remarkable preservation that its texture and details of its weave are pre- served. A sword and spear of iron lay beside the amphora. At the other side of the compartment was the burial of a woman wearing gilt hair coils, an embossed gold disk over each breast and pins of bronze, bone and gilt-iron at the left thigh (Fig. 3I). Three or four horses had been thrown into the adjacent compartment. 'The building itself is Io m. wide and at least 45 m. long, and apparently apsidal in plan (Fig. 32). It is divided into three sectors, at the W by two projecting square rooms, and at the E by two cross walls. A row of post-holes 2 m. outside the main walls show that it had a peristyle, whose timbers were rectangular. Similar timbers had been placed on either face of the main walls, presumably as supports for a roof which seems to have been of reeds. The walls are of mudbrick carried on a stone socle preserved in places to a height of 1.5 m. Just to the E of the burials a burnt area on the floor suggests it had been used for a pyre. 'Some walls at the W end of the building had canted into a hollow, possibly caused by the collapse of an underlying Mycenaean chamber tomb. This may have led to the abandon- ment of the building. It was subsequently deliberately filled in with stone and mudbrick debris after a high ramp of mud- bricks had been raised up against its N and S walls, forming a kind of tumulus (Fig. 33). The building seems to have been in use only for a short time and has so far produced only a small floor deposit of vases (Fig. 34). These are, however, enough to indicate that its abandonment and subsequent filling happened in the same period as its construction, either in MPG or early in LPG after which the adjacent cemetery continued in use for a century longer.' Eretria. An account of P. Themelis' discoveries in 1980 (AR 1980-81, 9) has appeared in Ergon I980, 26-7. C. Krause and his colleagues in 1980 continued their investi- gations for the Swiss School at several points within the ancient city (cf. AR 1980-81, 8-9). At the Theatre the outer angles of both parodos walls were examined, showing that apart from a 4 m. masonry stretch at each angle, the cavea is supported on an earth bank. Soundings were made at the House of the Mosaics to study the levels in the street and foundations of the building. The opportunity was taken of studying part of the city wall on the W circuit, in Hagelochos St, where it was 2- Fig. 33 I ! I 1- l ',"+ i .

' I/</page><page sequence="16">8 H. W. CATLING Fig. 35 found that here, too, the artificial channel of the stream made in the mid-6th cent. B.C. followed the line of the city wall. This channel was some 6.20 m. wide and its E embankment acted as the socle for the A city wall. The line of the C city wall was set back 4.0 m. from that of its A predecessor. A topographic study was made of the line taken by stream and road in the area between the W Gate and sector E 7, with a combination of excavation and resistivity survey: about 80 m. E of the West Gate the E-W road separates from the course of the brook which here turns away in a SE direction. In the Agora work concentrated on the E Stoa (Fig. 35). The wall remains lie very close to modern ground surface, and it was possible to uncover 40 m. of the building. It consisted of a double colonnade with a row of shops at the back; the outer Fig. 36 colonnade was Doric, the inner seems to have been Ionic. The building was c. 17.00 m. wide; its original length is cal- culated at go m. Coin evidence and a foundation deposit suggest a date in the 4th cent. B.C. for its construction. A deep sounding made within the building revealed a possible earlier stoa; finds of architectural terracottas (Fig. 36) and pottery point to a date c. 550-500 B.C. for this building, though there are signs that it continued in use into the 5th cent. It was constructed on virgin soil. The Prehistoric Levels were further excavated in the Vouratsa plot (see AR 1980-81, 8) where the earliest levels could not be examined because of the height of the water table. Evidence for occupation is particularly full during EH III and MH I, where deposits are up to I.Io m. thick, rich in pottery, chiefly of local manufacture, domestic for the most part, coarse or a finer grey ware. Some are decorated with incised or pointille geometric patterns or are embellished with applique knobs. Many obsidian and flint blades were found. Over this is a shallow level containing Minyan, M and LH IIIB and IIIC pottery; the later material is not definitely associable with any of the structures found. The earlier can be associated with wall remains (including curved walls), stone socles for upper structures in wood or mudbrick. One room had been a store-room, to judge from the remains of grain and pulses. Of great interest is the dis- covery of a potter's kiln in excellent preservation; the structure is I.0 m. diam.; it had a clay floor pierced with holes of 0.03-0.04 m. diam. supported on a clay pillar; the firing chamber is at present below the water level; associated pottery is exclusively PR, but further excavation is necessary for confirmation of the date of the kiln. Finds of the G period were scarce; some pottery was recovered while two pithos graves of children and four cremations with grave goods date to the 8th-7th cent. B.C. A finds were also very rare. It was not until after c. 450 B.C. that the area was built over again, to be abandoned in the 2nd cent. B.C. Among finds from the area is a fragmentary citizenship decree of the late 4th/early 3rd cent. B.C. (A report by C. Krause on the work of the Swiss School in 1981 was received too late for inclusion here; use will be made of it in AR 1982-83). Amarinthos. G. Parlama reports an investigation in 1977 at the Palaiochoria prehistoric settlement (=Euboea Survey 62, BSA lxi [1966] 64-6, pl. I7a; GAC 229-230, F.85) where an emergency excavation uncovered building remains associated with EH II and EH III material, including examples of 'Scored ware' characteristic of Lefkandi I. Fine MH and LH pottery was recovered in disturbed levels; the long history of the site was emphasised by the discovery of two tile graves, apparently of Ch date. (AAA XII [1979] 3-I4). Nea Artaki. E. Micha-Sarantea has described and illustrated palaeoliths from two working areas at N Artaki and a third at Makrykapa; the material is attributed to Lower, Middle and Upper Palaeolithic.

Williams II in the area immediately E of the ancient theatre, last worked before</page><page sequence="17">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 198I-82 19 the Second World War. In a more extended account Mr Williams reports: 'E and MN, EH and G sherds were recovered from the area. All except the N come from disturbed contexts. Only one Protocorinthian or LG grave was found. Pits and fills con- taining E and M Protocorinthian pottery were found in two 5 m. grids, partially sealed by a pebble mosaic floor of the 4th cent. B.C. The floor had been discovered in 1929, and is decorated with a floral centre with animals at the corners. A C well lies beyond the NE corner of the mosaic (Well 1981-2). It may have been abandoned when the building with the mosaic was constructed. The lower fill was of c. 450-425, while the top two meters appear to have been "topped-out" c. 300-250 B.C. Another, much less elaborate, floor is pre- served I0 m. NNW of the first: it is a random scatter of small stones in a cement matrix. Well 1981-9, still largely unex- cavated, lies at the NW corer of the floor, surrounded on its N and E by remains of walls of this room or court. 'A roadway, probably contemporary with the floors, lies to their W, going N-S along the E side of the C theatre. It appears to have been a main artery of the city, going from the area around the Asklepieion and the Lerna at the N to the E parodos of the theatre. Since wheel ruts are clearly distinguished in the accumulated road metals, one can assume that the road was also used by traffic continuing farther to the S, to the Fountain of Glauke and Akrokorinthos. The road was in use for some time before a poros water conduit was laid c. 300 B.C. with its cover slabs protruding above the contemporary road metal. This conduit was abandoned when a clay water pipe was laid beneath the same road. The pipe had a good amount of use and was maintained and cleaned between the time when it was laid and when it was abandoned in 146 B.C. In the associated fills were fragments of S Italian drinking cups, to be added to the growing amount of pre-Roman wares from Magna Grecia at Corinth. 'The most important of the HL remains are the manholes and cisterns of the area. One such manhole served as a northern access to a 20 m. long cistern. In its fill was found a poros aniconic head. The hair is in short S-shaped locks. A very small ear is carved on either side with a plain band at the front of the head connecting the ears. Ears and band are painted red. Because of the short hair, the small, exposed ears, and the use of red paint on areas that represent skin, one assumes that the head is male. 'There is a second, still sealed access to the same cistern. This was reused in the R period as a hiding place for valuables. Another complex, composed of a small rectangular basin, manhole and cistern, lies just N. A third cistern, accessible by a plastered shaft, lies 4 m. NNE of the figured pebble mosaic floor discovered in 1929 and is probably HL. These three cistern complexes were in use until the Mummian de- struction. They were filled and built over within the 50 or 60 years after the city was re-established in 44 B.C. 'The R reconstruction of the area E of the theatre started early. In fact an unfinished tunnel cut into bedrock, probably to serve as an underground aqueduct, may have been started in the first decade A.C. But R reorganisation of Greek Corinth can be most easily distinguished by a new road system E of the theatre. Here one N-S paved street and one E-W paved and colonnaded street attest to a N-S and E-W grid system within the city. Most of the ER buildings, however, that once were used with the road system have been demolished or altered by later inhabitants. The subterranean remains fared better. For example, a 20 m. long corridor-like cistern was found, entered by two shafts. One appears to have been cleared of silt in the Roman period in order to serve as a secret storage place for three cups or lamps, one lamp with tube-like bottom, a bowl, and a plate (Fig. 37) all of glass. The remains of a wooden chest were found with the stacked glass, along with some shaped bone fragments. Fig. 37 'A manhole or pit of interest, really the collapsed top of Well I98I-6, was penetrated by an ER underground corridor. This pit or well shaft lies at the S of the SW corner of the pebble mosaic floor cleared in 1929. The upper fill contained a number of late A fragments of Doric architecture. Impinging upon this pit was a second, with a stone lining. A Doric capital was found built into the stone lining of the manhole, also late A. A Doric capital and the other fragments appear to belong to a single monumental building constructed at the beginning of the 5th cent. B.C. 'R domestic architecture occupies the whole of the E limit of the I98I excavation. One building covers the area between the S colonnade of the E-W R street and the S scarp of the excavation, stretching for over 20 m. The E limit lies under excavation dump upon which the Xenia Hotel of Ancient Corinth now stands. This year only parts of two 5 x 5 m. grids were investigated. Their stratigraphy includes Byz levels with architectural remains, a LR structure and the destruction debris of the ER building. The floor underlying the lowest debris had a coin of Gordian III, A.D. 240, one cooking pot dated within the middle of the 3rd cent., and a large wooden panel with a circular glass medallion set into it. The wood and glass unit was probably from a wall panel or a door. The wood and the glass are slightly burnt, as are the overlying amphora sherds and the roof tiles of the building. The glass panel is now c. 0.58 m. diam. It is composed of two entwined squares, forming an eight-pointed star, surrounded by a band of pale millefiore. A central disc is decorated with three fish and one eel, I6-I7.5 cm long, facing alternately side to side. The eel is of millefiore glass with two twisted canes around the body (Fig. 38). 'Evidence for destruction of the building is beautifully preserved with, in one place, a collapsed baluster 0.90 m. high with running meander carved on one face. The waist-high wall associated with the post has an 0.038 m. thick core of cement with thin marble veneer on both sides. Associated</page><page sequence="18">20 H. W. CATLING Fig. 38 with the baluster is debris of frescoed mudbrick walls, the largest fragment of fresco having figured designs on a red background. One can deduce that the building collapsed onto its furnishings, the walls thereafter, probably all the result of a general fire c. 250 A.C. The precise dates of construction of the earliest phase of the building and of alteration or repair cannot, at the moment, be ascertained. 'In 395 Alaric passed over the area; his destructive powers are to be distinguished in a burnt and abandoned row of rooms that line the E side of the Theatre Street, with many coins on the floors. As renewal of the area started after the sack, old walls were pillaged for their material. One wall trench robbed of its blocks in the sth cent. was filled with a good represen- tative sample of contemporary pottery (Fig. 39), the latest going, possibly, into the 6th cent. A.C. With rebuilding came extensive filling, with the ground level raised over 0.90 m. Thus started a relatively short-lived reoccupation of the area; evidence for later 6th and 7th cent. occupation is scanty, and Fig. 39 still later occupation even more so, even into the IIth cent. A.C. No pottery of the IIth cent. is related to architectural remains. On the other hand, the second half of the I2th cent. is represented by walls, a well, and by much pottery. Occu- pation seems to be industrial. The few Frankish sherds recovered in levels covering the I2th cent. occupation seem to be casual losses, wash or dumped garbage rather than part of an occu- pation level. 'Scattered sherds but no Turkish or modem architectural remains were found. Nothing suggests significant occupation in the area after the I2th cent. A.C.' Nemea. S. G. Miller continued in 1981 his excavation at the Sanctuary of Zeus for the American School (AR 1980-81, I2 with earlier references.) He writes: 'Excavations were spread over a wide area which included the Stadium, the Sanctuary of Zeus, and the Tsoungiza Hill W of the Sanctuary. 'Work in the Stadium concentrated upon the existence of a retaining wall to support the artificial terrace of the N end of the race track. One would expect such a wall by analogy with the stadium at Sikyon, for example, and because of the mention of such a wall by Leake, but Blegen had concluded that no wall ever existed. Our results confirmed Blegen's conclusion and showed that the terrace was built up in successive layers of dumped fill which raised the surface of the race track some 8.25 m. above the surrounding terrain contemporary with the stadium. The ends of these layers seem to have been left exposed in a sharp slope which is still quite distinct. 'Some I40 m. N of the Temple of Zeus the foundations of an early HL small structure were uncovered. Although very close to the modern surface, and lacking any superstructure, the foundations would be consistent with a tetrastyle amphi- prostyle naiskos. 'Closer to the N side of the Temple of Zeus were found significant quantities of LG pottery below an enigmatic two- roomed EC building. Although this pottery was not found in association with any architectural remains, and cannot be necessarily defined as representing a habitation level, it shows that there was activity in this area during the 7th and later 8th cent. B.C. 'More of the fallen blocks of the Temple of Zeus were moved, and their catalogue is nearing completion. This work will result in a study of the feasibility of a physical reconstruc- tion of the temple. 'S of the Sanctuary of Zeus, and of the road which ran along the S side of the Xenon, the remains of several different structures were uncovered. Those directly S of the W end of the Xenon, partially explored in 1978, will require further clearing in order to reveal their plan. Within this complex, however, emerged clear evidence of activity c. I50-IOO B.C. which is, perhaps, to be associated with the epigraphically attested actions of Mummius at Nemea in 145 B.C. These structures also produced many domestic artifacts of the earlier HL period. Of special interest is a mug with the incised graffito: TOU At65. This suggests the identification of these buildings as priests' houses. 'Further to the E another complex of walls also appears to belong to a domestic structure. One of the central rooms was paved with hydraulic cement, and the many ceramic artifacts also have a domestic character. This building, like all those on the S limits of the Sanctuary, was cut at regular intervals by long, for the moment inexplicable, trenches which seem to date from the 3rd cent. A.C. to judge by a coin of Probus. It should also be noted that this building, of c. 300 B.C., has</page><page sequence="19">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1981-82 2I neither predecessor nor successor. It therefore appears to re- present the outer limit of the greatest expansion of the Sanctuary of Zeus in this area during the building program of the second half of the 4th cent. B.C. 'Work on Tsoungiza consisted in part of salvage excavations in a deep-ploughed field, where two areas were very rich. One produced EN pottery and may represent a pit like those discovered in 1926, 1974 and I975 on another part of the hill. The second produced much EH material from what appears to have been an apsidal house. 'Systematic excavations were carried out nearer to the crest of the hill and revealed a room with a stone-lined central hearth and a built platform along one side. The floor was found littered with broken, but complete, vessels of the latter part of the MH period. The organic material included dozens of cloves of garlic, and the absence of fire or other traces of violence suggests that the destruction may have been due to abandonment.' Argos. A summary of the similarity between the Argolis and Messenia in the use of funerary tumuli in the BA and later has been made by E. Deilaki. (Peloponnesiaka IA' 222-231). The investigations of the French School were resumed at several points during I98I. At the Baths P. Aupert continued his study of the levels preceding the construction of the baths (AR 1980-81, 13). Near the E end of the N stoa and below the E stoa fill new wall stumps have been uncovered, consisting of a stone and glazed tile socle surmounted by stuccoed pise; part of the stucco was preserved in situ painted with panels and geometric motifs in polychrome. Pottery from the wall construction dates them to A.D. 25-40. Below one of these rooms was found a HL tomb with terracotta statuettes com- parable to those portraying a seated naked woman found in 1966 in T.250 (BCH xci [1967] 831, fig. 34). An inscription of 170-164 B.C. was found reused (Fig. 40): it records a double Fig. 40 benefaction for an uncertain objective (a) 20 pieces of gold offered by the Ptolemies and (b) donations made by a number of Cypriot towns - Karpasia, Salamis, Kourion, Amathos, Tamassos, Golgoi, Kition, and Paphos - expressed in figures which raise exchange rate problems. A previously unrecorded system of channels for draining waste water from the Baths was found in the upper fill (Fig. 41). A sounding located the angle between the buried stylobate of the original design of the baths and the flight of steps I2.40 m. wide which linked the great internal court with the peristyle. Fig. 41 The earliest road on the N side of the Baths is A; at the E end its pavement is set on a Myc level; further W the underlying deposit contained Myc and G pottery and a single A sherd. The HL paving remained in use up to the building of the Baths in their first form. The road's junction on the SE with the N-S road was found, embellished with a fountain and semicircular basin backed on to the building occupying this corner, all dating Ist-2nd cent. A.D. The W end of the street opens into a small square that gave access to the theatre's S parodos and the back of the skene. C. Abadie and J. des Courtils investigated the N parodos of the Theatre during 1981, concentrating on the clearance of the parodos passage and its relation with the R skene buildings. Study of the area E of the partition wall found earlier (BCH lxxxi [1957] 640-3) has shown that the design for access under- went numerous alterations as the ground level rose. Little remains of the first design and when this plan was modified access to the Theatre seems to have been restricted to the W entrance. The alterations seem to have been associated with the building of some kind of extra installation (a fountain or cult place, with which could be associated the statuettes that have been found in this area). The original design cannot be dated, but the second phase appears to belong to mid-2nd cent. B.C. The large R scene buildings encroached on the E part of the parodos. From this period dates a rapid rise in floor level which led to changes in the access to the theatre. Tiryns. The German School's excavations in the Unterburg continued in 1981 under K. Kilian, from whose more extended account the following summary has been made (see AR 1980-81, 14-16 and earlier references). Neolithic. N pottery continues to be found in significant quantity, but largely from later fills or incorporated in mud- bricks. Only on the E, in LXIV 3 8 (for grid references, consult the plan AR 1978-79, I6, fig. 20), in a hollow in the rock was an undisturbed deposit found containing MN pottery. Any N structures were swept away when the hill was prepared for EH settlement. Early Helladic. Last year's trenches were continued to bed-</page><page sequence="20">22 H. W. CATLING rock, where this did not jeopardize important LH buildings. The presence of the latter prevented a complete understanding of the EH settlement plan. In LXII 39 a raised bench, mud- built, was found, on top of which was burnt straw - bed and bedding? The large building composed of rooms I8o-I85, its W part damaged by the construction of the LH House I, was destroyed by fire. Its abundant pottery is typical EH II, and includes fragments of a relief-decorated hearth-kerb, fragments of several stands, parts of a zoomorphic vase, a bone fragment with incised ornament recalling contemporary examples from Troy and Lefkas. In the W corner of R I85 a large collection of obsidian was found suggesting a workshop. R 196-200 showed well built stone socles for mudbrick superstructure. A burial had been inserted in one wall during EH II. R I99 was rich in pottery, including a large storage vase (Fig. 42), a footed cup, an askos with burnished upper There is a similar steep slope to the W towards the sea. Three superimposed wash levels have been identified of which the middle dates to the end of LH IIIB, repeating the type of material found in the pre-destruction houses: a number of LH IIIC types among a characteristically LH IIIB2 series. Fragments of Handmade ware also occur. In the lowest wash level (only reached in a test) was LH IIIBI pottery; a stirrup jar from this level is, indeed, of LH IIIA type. More work was done in House III; beside the E/W wall of its R 3 five lead cauldrons with asprochoma filling were found. From these and other contemporary contexts, among a mass of normal LH IIIB2 pottery is a bowl with two knop handles (Fig. 43) and Fig. 43 Fig. 42 part and a sauceboat with mottled surface. R I97 had an obsidian-working area, while finds of lead 'buns' are further evidence of industrial activity. This group of rooms perished in a fire destruction comparable to that reported further S in I980. Below R 196-199 were found R 205-206, of the same pot- tery phase - 205 contained a hearth, 206 a remarkable large pottery 'fruitstand' of a kind previously known only in frag- ments. Among finds of particular interest is a stone pyxis lid, pottery recalling Poliochni IV and a fragment of a Cycladic frying pan with stamped spiral ornament. Yet earlier than these rooms, though still EH II, are R 203-204 on the E side of the hill (R 204's S wall - excellent herring-bone masonry - was founded on bedrock; the floor of R 203 consists partly of the natural rock surface, trimmed). The pottery in these rooms has changed character, though forms and decorative style are typical of EH II. T-profile rims are rare; bowls and cups are smaller and are glazed in and out. Sauceboats are common, with broad handles and excellent surface finish. In the same assemblage are bowls with in-turning rim, raspberry-coloured coating and pans coated on their inner surface, features typical of EH I. It seems therefore that these levels at Tiryns represent an earlier phase of EH II than any previously recognized (that it is EH II, however, is emphasised by the fact that decorated hearth kerbs have already appeared, and the spindle whorls and blade industry are indistinguishable from full EH II). LH IIIB. In LH IIIB there was an open space in the area N of House V as far as LXII 35, beyond which the hill slopes away steeply and the relevant levels have not yet been reached. a deep bowl fragment with the very unusual feature of a merrythought handle. There were numerous handmade miniatures, including jugs, pyxides and bowls. On an earlier floor was a possible metal-working installation. A bronze fragment with incised linear ornament might be a tripod leg; two bone instruments could either be tools used in preparing metal moulds or styli for inscribing Linear B tablets. Several objects suggest a lead workshop, including casting droplets and strips of metal with chisel marks. A terracotta figure of a bovid is of unusual form as is a hollow-bodied carefully painted animal. Work continued in House 6, the 'House of the Priestess', where further details of the plan (rooms and corridor, two- room trapezoidal annexe on the S side) were identified. At the S end of the corridor was an ash-filled pit from the upper part of which came a Linear B tablet. Finds from the annexe (which included lead-casting rubbish, a lead weight, part of a cake of slag from iron-working) suggest this was a combined living and workroom. Of interest from the floor deposit is a lentoid flask which may be a Cypriot import; also in the floor rubbish was the marble hilt plate of a parade sword. Fragments of five Linear B tablets were found, suggesting an archive room or office. In LXI 43-LXII 44 the two rubbish levels (LH IIIB2) were very rich in finds. In the lower, pure LH IIIB2 level a round clay house model was found, as well as animal and human clay statuettes; notable were fragments of a four-sided chair/ throne with horizontal transoms, recalling a Cypriot example. A fine fresco fragment with part of the helmeted head of a warrior carrying two spears was found. A lead bar with relief herring-bone ornament may have been some kind of cartoon for casting a bronze tripod leg. The series of Proto-Phi, Phi and Tau statuettes is of considerable importance for establishing the Palace period typology and for comparison with Mycenae. In LXV 38 the excavation of the EH levels to the rock</page><page sequence="21">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, I981-82 23 permitted the citadel wall to be cleared to its base and the foundations studied. The joints were found to be grouted with asprochoma; the foundation trench was only 0.40-0.50 m. wide; the latest pottery from the fill was ofLH IIIA2 type (as distinct from the volume of LH IIIB2 pottery found in the upper foundation trench fill in I979). At the S end of House VI deeper soundings were made, and a destruction level identified associated with pure LH IIIBI pottery (an ivory miniature half column was also found). The excavator compares this destruction horizon with the Mycenae House of the Oil Merchant, etc. Nevertheless, between Houses I and VI on the W of the Unterburg and an equivalent area on the E, no LH buildings have been found earlier than IIIB2. LH IIIC. In LXI 36, at the S corner of casemate 14, a retaining wall was found which in late and developed IIIC had held a considerable terrace. Nearby levels contained early and de- veloped IIIC. Where identified, the LH IIIC late levels lie immediately over IIIB2, erosion is one of several reasons responsible for this juxtaposition. The IIIC history of House VI was elucidated. In R 127 and I27a the latest floors were further investigated. A larnax inset into the floor contained a late IIIC skyphos (wavy band). The destruction horizon of the antecedent rectangular building had been cleared in 1980. Three hearths were found on its floor, one of them surfaced with sherds. From another came the wavy-band krater (Fig. 44) of which other fragments had been found in an Fig. 44 earlier phase of this house. Also made up was a hydria; there was little undecorated pottery and no kylikes. The pottery in the final phase of this building and from RI26 and 136 is IIIC Advanced (including a fragment of chariot vase). Much interest attaches to finds ofLH IIIC Late pottery - amphoriskoi with wavy bands on the shoulder, jugs with the same on the neck, together with examples of a simplified Close Style give (with material previously found) an assemblage which must still be classed as IIIC Late. But such features as high conical feet, deep-bellied amphoriskoi, late lekythoi, curvilinear pat- ternwork on stirrup jar shoulders anticipate what was to come in SMyc, and demonstrate a continuous development. Among IIIC Advanced pottery a figured kalathos is notable, as well as birds in Close Style, and a krater fragment with part of a hunt. More fragments were found of AR 1979-80, 29 fig. 50. Several types of terracotta statuettes and models were found (including chariot wheels). In a IIIC Early level a nearly complete handmade hydria was found, obviously copying a Myc wheel-made coarse ware shape. A skeleton found in LXI.43 lacked the right arm and lower part of the legs, suggesting the formal burial of a mutilated body. In LXI.43, 44 remains of a building were found put up immediately after the great destruction; the technique is careless, and recalls features of R 97. Only a scrap of the floor was preserved, and it seems that the rest of the floor, as well as the mud mortar in the W and S walls of the building, had been washed out by storm water. The presence of an architectural complex of this date in the S part of the site is of particular interest. Post-Mycenaean. A LA level (dated by L Corinthian pottery) was identified in LXI 36, in casemate 14; G material came from the underlying level. Kokla. The Greek Press reports the discovery by K. Demakopoulou of a LH tholos tomb with dromos 23.00 m. long. The doorway into the chamber was plastered and painted. The tomb walls were preserved to a height of i.8o m.; contents include a gold cup, seven silver vases (kylikes and cups), two sealstones, bronze spearheads, a bronze ring, bronze hairpins, an ivory rod and gold sheet used to cover a vase, either bronze or wood. (Vradyni and Ethnos 5.12.81). Epidauros. M. Mitsos has attributed a new fragment to IG IV2 I, 75, a fragmentary stela recording a boundary dispute judgement between Epidaurus and Hermione (a copy of which was found in Hermione=AM xlix [I934] 47) and discussed the interpretation of the text. (AE 1979, 214-7). Halieis. C. Dengate has published a number of inhumation graves originally excavated in I958 by N. Verdelis, found SE of the ancient settlement. The earliest dates to the late 6th- early 5th cent. B.C.; the remainder are 5th and 4th cent. B.C. c. 75% of the pottery was Attic, c. 25% Corinthian; very few local pieces were identified. Other objects are few, but include a good silver finger-ring of the 4th cent. B.C. with engraved design of a seated woman (?Aphrodite) and Eros. (ADelt 3I [1976] Mel 274-324). ARCADIA-LAKONIA Gortynia-Psophis. Ch. Kardara (AS) returned to this site (AR 1968-69, I5; AR 1969-70, 14) to continue work at the shrine and oracle of Aphrodite Erykinis, in particular to locate the sacred spring and complete excavation of the stoa. A clue to the whereabouts of the spring was given by an underground water channel lined with hydraulic plaster S of the official oracular area, but excavation so far has only located part of the S peribolos wall of the main shrine, constructed after the Persian Wars. Below this wall were found many votives, mainly A, but including some Daedalic. The spring was located NW of the channel; the whole of its built superstruc- ture had been levelled inside it. The W half of the stoa was uncovered; the E half is filled with large slabs from the back wall. In front of the stoa were found two terracotta tiles and a red painted terracotta triglyph of 475-450 B.C. The triglyph and one of the tiles came from the temple, contemporary with that of Zeus at Olympia. These pieces were used as spolia in the stoa which continued in use into late antiquity after the destruction of the sanctuary. (Ergon Ig80, 28-9). Lousoi. N.

A marble capital and fragments of 4th cent. B.C. antefixes were found. Megalopolis. Lignite digging to supply the Megalopolis power station continues to bring to light large quantities of the fossilized remains of animals of Pleistocene date, including elephants, rhinocesauri, red deer, hippopotamoi. (Apoyevmatini, June I98I). Megalopolis area. J. Roy withJ. A. Lloyd and E. J. Owens led a team from Sheffield University and University College, Swansea, in a programme of field survey in the territory of Megalopolis in 1981. A strip of land running io km. W of the village of Rapsomati and 3 km. S of modern Megalopolis was walked by three survey groups. The many new sites discovered seem to fall into three main chronological groups: those with bg pottery (51 locations), those with (?) late Byz pottery (7 locations) and those with post-Mediaeval or recent pottery (36 locations). A large number of locations (58) produced finds more difficult to date with precision. Pre-hellenic and R material was extremely scarce. Most of the sites consisted of small scatters of tile and pottery, but occasionally further evidence came to light. Among the bg sites two stood out by virtue of the extent and the content of their debris scatters which included masonry remains (a column drum, wall foundations) and a rotary quern. Another site of the same period produced much human bone and a block inscribed with a personal name. A big late Byz scatter incorporated well-cut masonry. A kiln site with wasters, clinker, daub and hundreds of sherds, mainly of amphoras and jugs, may be of the same period. The survey also recovered important evidence relating to the date and extent of the 'younger fill' of the Megalopolitan plain, and a bias in favour of settlement location close to or on Neogen soils was noted. To what extent this emphasis is due to modern land-use characteristics and recent alluviation is not yet clear. Bassae. G. Koukis and A. Tzitziras (the Greek Geological Institute - IGME) have published a geotechnical account of the present state of the Temple of Apollo Epikourios, explaining the adverse combination of circumstances that have endangered the building's stability; seismic disturbance, water action and the unsatisfactory nature of the limestone used by the builders further complicate difficulties created by the geology of the site itself. (ADelt 3 [1976] Mel 76-86). Pellanes (c. 20 km. NNW of Sparta=GAC 123, C.56). Early in 1982 the Greek Press reported the discovery by Th. Spyropoulos of a LH tholos tomb with chamber 10.0 m. diam., the original height calculated at Io.o m. There appears to be a shallow engraved drawing of an animal - ? lion - at the entrance. The excavation continues. (Elef. Kosmos 3.2.82). Mani. N. Moutsopoulos - G. Dimitrokallis have described a series of 'megalithic' monuments at various points in the peninsula. (Lakonikai Spoudai 5, 385-90). Investigation continued in 1980 of the basilican church at Tigani, under N. Drandakis (AS). 29 burials were excavated within the main church yielding a variety of gold and silver jewellery and other objects of bronze and iron. Concurrently the work of recording the Byz and post-Byz churches con- tinued. (Ergon 9I80, 36). Mani: Phrangoulia. N. Drandakis published an inscription of the IIth cent. on the tenblon of the Church of Phaneromani, and describes a very recent discovery of wall paintings in the church. (AE 1979, 218-25). Phoinikion. P. Kalligas has given a preliminary account of his study of the material (chiefly bronzes) from the shrine of Apollo Hyperteleatas found during the last century, now in the National Museum. Further investigation of the site was made in 1969 by the Sparta Ephoria (AR 1970-71, I4). The life of the shrine had two phases - A and C (550-300 B.C.) when it was the most important shrine in the Parnon pen- insula, and HL and R (300 B.C.-A.D. 395). Given its distance from Sparta, it will have been a very important perioikic centre. That it is no earlier than the 6th cent. B.C. accords with the struggle for control of this part of the Peloponnese between Argos and Sparta, ending in the latter's favour in the 6th cent. An A terracotta disk akroterion from the site shows there must have been a significant temple here. The bronzes are described and discussed. In HL times the shrine became one of the two centres of the Koinon of the Lakedaimonians. The dedications of this period point to the sanctuary's in- creasing importance. The Koinon was reorganised in R times and became the 'Koinon of the Eleftherolakones'; the role of the sanctuary was by now solely religious. A standard votive at this date was a bronze band - the stephane worn by one of the officiants, dedicated to Apollo after service to the god. (Lakonikai Spoudai 5 [i980] 10-30).

Some EH IIIA pottery was found. Nearby, on Prophitis Elias, the burial of a youth was found in a MH pithos. (Ergon 1980, 33). Petrochori (GAC D.io). Tests in I980 by G. Korres (AS) recovered pottery of early and final N in the 'Cave of Nestor'. (Ergon 1980, 34). Tragana (GAC D.I).. G. Korres (AS) re-examined the spoil from Kourouniotis' excavation of Tholos I, finding much LH pottery (including Palace Style jars, tinned vases, and LH IIIC material) and some HL. Other finds include jewellery, beads of semi-precious stone, and a seal (flattened cylinder, sard) representing a couchant gryphon, displayed (Fig. 46). (Ergon 1980, 34). Kaminia Kremmidhiou (GAC D.34). In cleaning the LH complex of small tholoi and pithos burials (AR 1975-76, I5) for balloon photography (Fig. 47), G. Korres found two more MH burial pithoi; one is unusual in that the head of the skeleton lay at the mouth of the pithos. Korres sees this monument as a stage of transition from the MH tumulus with pithoi inserted, Fig. 47 their mouths outturned, to the LH tholos tomb covered by a mound, its dromos reaching the mound's circumference. (Ergon 1980, 34-5). Papoulia: Ayios Ioannis (GAC D.52). G. Korres resumed the clearance of this MH burial complex first investigated by Sp. Marinatos (Fig. 48) (AR 1954, 35; AR 1955, io). Two more large burial pithoi were found in the mound, while two more jar burials of infants were noted in the outer circumference of the mound's foundation. At least two phases in the use of the tumulus can be identified. (Ergon 1980, 35). Lepreon. H. Knell has described the visible remains of the Temple of Demeter (Paus. v 5.6), first noticed by W. D6rpfeld, AM xvi [1891] 259 f. The site was cleaned in 1978, the ground plan clarified and the location of the altar established. Numer- ous members of the order were identified; a date for the building c. 375-350 B.C. is proposed. (AAA XII [1979] 53-9). Olympia. The Greek Press in February 1982 reported the formal opening of the Olympia Museum, and the first oppor- tunity for the public to view the new arrangement of the pedi- mental sculpture from the Zeus temple, to which have now been added over 300 fragments. (Ethnos 5.2.82). M. Mallwitz had reported that the work of the German School in 1981 was confined to the conservation and study of material recovered in recent years. Notable is a collection of early bronze helmets found in Well SO II5/128 (Fig. 49). Fig. 48 Fig. 49</page><page sequence="24">26 H. W. CATLING Fig. 5S Fig. 50 Most are well preserved; they include several of the class with parallel crest ridges, and E Corinthian examples, two of which have graffito inscriptions. These suggest they were the property of Olympia rather than that they were dedicated. Closer study of the bronze animal foot B 10323 found in Well SO I04 shows it joins the cast tripod leg B 7000 (Fig. 50). Work on the col- lection of major terracotta sculpture has led to the addition of the left leg to the well-known warrior figure (Fig. 5I). This addition alters its pose and weakens the suggestion that he is a swordsman on the attack. Attention was given to the long pottery sequence (early 7th cent. B.C. to 7th cent. A.D.), whose chronological framework is now much more secure. This work has led to the recognition of absolute fixes in the second quarter of the 5th and the second quarter of the 4th cents B.C. Architectural study has shown that in the Bouleuterion the facade of the N aspidal building had no columns but only pillars with anta capitals (cf. the so-called pilaster building). Study of the Pheidian moulds has shown they include fragments for a chiton; it has to be determined whether they come from the Zeus statue itself, or from the Nike figure. Mazi Skyllountias. Under the general supervision of N. Yalouris (AS) A. Trianti continued her work on the Doric temple in 1980 (AR 1960-61 I4; AR 1979-8o, 34; AR 1980-81, 20). PR pottery came to light when tests were dug to study the foundation structure of the temple. Elsewhere column drums and a Doric capital were found, and part of the architrave. Some distance from the SW corner of the temple traces of another building made of massive blocks came to light in association with an enclosure wall that surrounds the precipi- tous N and NW sides of the hill. (Ergon I980, 32-3). Ancient Elis. V. Mitsopoulou-Leon has reported on the Austrian share of the project in 198I. She writes: 'Work continued in the area NW of the skene of the Theatre. The basin measures 6 m. in width and at least io m. long; the E wall stretches N beyond the water channel, where it is interrupted by a late tomb. Whereas the channel is constructed of large clay bricks, the walls of the basin are built with frag- ments of Laconian roof tiles and mortar. The floor consists of small pebbles on a layer of mortar; it is higher than the floor of the channel (it therefore seems impossible that they had been in simultaneous use). This proves last year's conclu- sions that the wide-angled foundation and the water channel, which it includes, belonged to a building-phase preceding the basin. Fragments of red wall-painting and some pottery of the 3rd-2nd cents B.C. may be ascribed to this first complex. We now think that a thick floor of stamped clay and pebbles and to the E the level of round river stones (already found during the last campaigns) could belong to building phase 2, thus covering those walls of phase I which were not reused in phase 2. 'W of the basin were found seven stones belonging to an approximately semicircular foundation not yet completely excavated (Fig. 52). A floor of mortar (or stucco) is partly preserved at o.I0 m. below the level of the stones. The strati- graphy suggests we should tentatively date this exedra to phase 2, whereas differences in level make it seem more probable that the big foundation with the half-column in front of the entrance to the E belongs to a still later date. Part of the wall is placed in front of the exedra. Blue paint still adheres to the inside of the walls about 0.25 m. high. 'Generally it is very difficult to draw conclusions because of the extremely fragmentary stase of preservation of walls and floors. In this area 20 poor tombs of 3rd-4th cents A.D. not only destroy the contexts but also reuse old materials. One tomb above the exedra (Fig. 52) had been covered by two large blocks each carved with a half shield in relief (Fig. 53).' An exhibition of finds from the Elis excavations, and of chance discoveries, has been made in the new store at Elis.

The hoard may have been buried in response to the Slav invasion. (AAA XII [I979] 63-71). Fig. 53 N. Yalouris has published an account of the joint Greek- Austrian work for 1980 in Ergon 1980, 30-2. E. Andreou has published a slightly larger than life marble torso of Hermes, datable to the Ist cent. B.C., found in 1967 near the site of the agora of the ancient city (AR 1968-69, I6). He suggests it may originally have adorned either the palaestra or one of the two gymnasia used for training by Olympic competitors in the month before the games. (ADelt 31 [1976] Mel 260-4). ACHAEA Patras. The Greek Press reported the discovery on the N side of the town of a R bridge 20 m. long, 4.5 m. wide; its surface was wheel-rutted. (Akropolis 3.4.8I). P. Agallopoulou-Kalliontzi has published a detailed account of a coin hoard found in rescue excavation in 1973 (AR 1979-8o, 35). It contained 17 silver triobols of the 4th-2nd cent. B.C., made up of 4 autonomous of Sikyon, 3 of Argos, I of Hermione, 3 ofBoeotia, I ofLokri Opuntii, 15 of Megalopolis, 88 of the Achaean League and 2 of Aetolia. The hoard, found in a clay trefoil olpe, was buried c. 150 B.C. (AE 1979, 188-99). S. Bowman has published 30 funerary inscriptions from the Jewish cemetery, the earliest dating to the I6th cent. The onomasticon suggests the community came from at least four different areas - Romaniotes, Sicilians, Sephardim and Apulians. (ADelt 3I [I976] Mel 49-75). Patras: Krini. The Greek Press reports the discovery in 1981 of a LH chamber tomb containing four burials associated with 13 clay vases, a silver ring, a bronze spear and a bronze sword with remains of its scabbard including bronze studs and thin sheet as well as traces of organic materials. (Kathemerini 24.10.81). Kallithea. A. Papadopoulos (AS) excavated three more chamber tombs in the LH cemetery (AR 1976-77, 35; AR 1978-79, 22; AR 1979-8o, 34). Finds include pottery, a tripod lamp, beads, sealstones, two bronze rings with spiral terminals, a 'flame shaped' spearhead (? perhaps a Kephallenia Class weapon: BSA lxiii [1968] Io6-7) and a large bronze fibula of violin bow type, the last associated with a cremation in Tomb 0. This is apparently the first LH cremation recorded in Achaea. (Ergon 1980, 29-30). Priolithos Kalavritou. M. Oikonomidou has published a hoard of I20 EByz coins found at Kokori, consisting of I8 follis, 87 demi-follis, and IS minimi of the 5th and 6th cents Fig. 54 CENTRAL GREECE: BOEOTIA Thebes. A mosaic floor of the 6th cent. A.D. found in building operations in Epaminondas St has been described by M. Georgopoulou. Little could be established about the building to which it had belonged, but the room whose floor it covered may have been part of a bath complex. The chief design was circular, with a central emblenia portraying a female protome inscribed 'MOYCA' (Fig. 54). Other panels contain florals, birds, animals, fish and urns. The work is attributed to a local school of mosaicists, apparently active from the 5th cent. A.D. (AAA XIII [1980] I39-53). V. Athanasopoulou-Penna has published a hoard of bronze coins of the 6th cent. A.D. found in the vicinity of Thebes in 1932. It contained 218 coins (8 of Anastasios, 7 ofJustin I, 87 of Justinian I and 1I6 of Justin II), and had been deposited after 575/6; it is likely to be associable with the Slav invasion of Greece of c. A.D. 580. (AE 1979, 200-13). Central Boeotia. J. Bintliffand A. M. Snodgrass have since 1978 conducted a surface survey for the British School in Boeotia based on the village of Mavromati. They summarise some of their results as follows: 'This year we came on an extensive yet unrecorded site in the Valley of Muses, whose density rivalled that of the centre of Thisbe and whose chronological range extends from at least G to LR. It seems highly likely that this will prove to be identifiable as Hesiod's Askra, ending a two-centuries-long search. We have also investigated the major settlement adjoin- ing the sanctuary of Onchestos; the finds here included sub- stantial architectural fragments and also inscribed sherds. The expedition has now investigated over 50 sites, of which four at most were previously recorded. 'It has become clear that there were two "peaks" of settle- ment in our part of Boeotia, in the later C period (5th-4th cents B.C.) and the LR to EByz (4th-6th cents A.D.). Outside these periods, the fluctuations are sharp, with some predictable</page><page sequence="26">28 H. W. CATLING "lows" (as in the EIA) and some less expected ones: the area is, for instance, extraordinarily thin in prehistoric settlements, although one of our most remarkable discoveries is also our very earliest: a scatter of Middle to Upper Palaeolithic chert tools in a valley to the north of Thespiai. 'Then there are the enthralling problems of the Copaic basin. The starting-point of our work here was our discovery, in 1978, of a substantial Greco-Roman site at a point which, on the orthodox view of the lake-levels, would have lain at least seasonally below several feet of water at the period in question. This has inspired us to focus activity on the former lake-bed and its margins.' Tanagra. Th. Spyropoulos (AS) continued his excavation of the LH cemetery at Dendra in 1980. Four types of tomb have now been identified - the standard chamber tomb, the dug shaft lined with masonry, the pit-cave and the pit-grave. It is suggested that these differences may reflect a social and/or economic hierarchy in the community responsible for the cemetery. From T I9 some 20 LH IIIB vases were recovered (Fig. q~).

(Nea 25.9.81). Delphi (environs). P. Valavanis has published a description, plan and elevation of a square tower probably of the 4th and 3rd cents B.C. adjacent to the modern Delphi-Arachova road, over I km. from the sanctuary (Archaeognosia 1.2, 331-43). Kallion. P. Themelis has given a summary account of his rescue excavation at ancient Kallipolis (AR 1977-78, 38; AR 1978-79, 23; AR 1979-80, 38-9; AR 1980-81, 23).

Ph. Dakaronia has published two fragmentary grave stelae found by chance at Varka, 3 km. NE of the modern village, where subsequent excavation revealed remains of a modest funerary peribolos and two built graves. The better preserved stela (Fig. 56) has a most elaborate crowning anthemion whose style dates the stone to the early 2nd cent. B.C. and places it close to other gravestones found nearby, evidently the product of a local workshop. The stone reads FAauKiCa/ Aavo6co)/ OEi1aTrlEuS TroA?ExapXoS, perhaps a son of the Lanamos son of Glaukias who appears on IG VII 2724C. The explanation for the location of the graves (remote from any known site) is discussed - possibly on a rural estate? (AAA XII [1979] I49-58). CENTRAL GREECE: PHOKIS, LOKRIS AND PHTHIOTIS Tragana (Lokris). The Greek Press reports the discovery of eight G tombs in an unknown cemetery found during the Fig. 58 world with which Kallipolis was in touch, including Central and N Greece, Crete, the Aegean Islands and probably Asia Minor. This is the earliest archive collection; the site was destroyed in 279 B.C. and the archival material from Cyrene, Delos and Nea Paphos date to the 2nd-Ist cents B.C. Other features and finds from the house of the archives are described, including an exceptionally fine terracotta statuette of a winged Eros with kithara (Fig. 58). (AAA XII [I979] 245-79). Kalapodhi. R. Felsch (German School) continued his excavation at this important sanctuary (AR 1980-81, 23-5) in 1981; the early architectural sequence was studied. A strati- graphical investigation was made in squares K 25-6 (see AA I980, 46, fig. 5 and BCHciv[I98o] 626, fig. 92 for explanations</page><page sequence="27">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1981-82 29 of these references) SE of the large C temple and in front of the A temple, where a series of deposits from LH IIIC - SG were investigated. The level marking the LH IIIC-PG transition contained much unpainted handmade pottery; one deposit produced among burnt debris fragments ofpithoi with stamped decoration, and quantities of carbonised cereals perhaps from the pithoi. Among the fine pottery the skyphoi are LH in shape, but their concentric circle designs look forward to PG. Such elements occur in pure LH levels. Definite PG elements like wavy band in Lefkandi style are first met with in the next deposit. The PG levels, in general, correspond quite well with the Lefkandi sequence, though the latest Lefkandi phase developed differently. At Kalapodhi a level containing pendent semi-circle skyphoi is immediately succeeded by a MG level whose links are with Boeotia. Here bronzes (fibulae and other ornaments) become common, and some of the fragments of larger bronze votives (tripod legs and handles of early types) found in later levels must have originated in this horizon. The 8th cent. developments were not wholly clear; above the MG levels comes a LG phase which seems to consist of a terrace fill deposited at the end of the 8th cent. as part of a major re- arrangement of the shrine, involving building two temples and laying out a large cult area which did duty in the 7th cent. Probably to the first decades of the 7th cent. are to be dated the earliest architectural remains of a temple. Since it underlies the large C temple its design is only partly recoverable. But the evidence of earlier foundations and the remains of previous earth altars establish that it is not the earliest building. 22 m. of the S wall is preserved, together with the E front entrance, parts of its earth floor, and its hearth altar enclosed by rough masonry in the innermost part of the cella. Beside the hearth was a feature that might have been the round base for a cult figure, or a bench for offerings. The S wall consisted of a stone socle supporting courses of mudbrick; in the E wall was an entrance with threshold blocks 6.80 m. wide. Traces of door- fittings were found, proving that the building had not been in antis. The N wall had been destroyed during the 7th cent. and survived solely as a robber-trench; the rear wall had similarly disappeared. The building (which was Io.o m. wide) may have been apsidal. In the absence of any trace of roofing material in the destruction it seems likely that it was thatched. The span of the roof will have been so large that two parallel lines of supports seem more likely than a single one, though the evidence has been removed by later building. Integral with this temple and the cult area with its ash deposit is a second temple which lies below the S A temple. Part of its S wall was found in the robber trench of the front wall of the cella of the A temple. This temple (the S temple) may be better preserved than the first described (the N temple); its axis is not parallel with the N temple, but is almost exactly E-W. Substantial remains of other buildings, whose functions and interrelationships are uncertain, mean considerable 7th cent. building activity. With this were found two lapidary inscrip- tions which must be amongst the earliest monumental in- scriptions known. Excavation within the pronaos of the C temple proved the existence of a peristyle surrounding the N (A) temple. The building soon after 580 B.C. measured 42 m. long, I5.6 m. wide. Further work on the small A temple showed its cella had been a simple oikos. With the line of the front wall of the cella level with the second column of the peristyle, this building is of great importance in Doric archi- tectural development. The plan of the first C temple has now been completed. Its cella was longer than that of its successor. Its arrangement is that of a canonical EC temple. The later building, of the last quarter of the 5th cent., included a front hall two spans wide after the pattern of the Bassae temple. Among finds of note during the season was a small ivory head of the 8th cent. with a lead pin, coming from a statuette made in another material or from a piece of furniture. THESSALY Halos. R. Reinders (Dutch School of Surveys) has described the results of a survey (1976-9) of the surface remains of the acropolis and fortified town which has corrected the belief that the acropolis was an A predecessor of the HL town on level ground below - both are contemporary, but a Byz fortress was subsequently established on the acropolis. Though the sea is now nearly 2 km. from the site, it came within 50o m. of the walls at the time of their construction, and the site served as a control of the sea passage between Mt Othrys and the Pagasitic Gulf.

A clearer understanding has been gained of the two earlier churches built on this site. The first (mid-4th cent.) had been built on the remains of earlier structures; its length (excluding the apse) had been c. 37.30 m. with mosaic floors. The second church was built in the first half or mid-5th cent., 67.50 m. long, its floor of marble and terracotta slabs 0.45 m. higher than its predecessor's; on the W was a very large aithrion. The third church was built in the second quarter of the 6th cent., 81.20 m. long, its floors 0.65 m. higher again, and paved in marble except for mosaic floors in the side aisles and the exonarthex.

The narthex has now been completely cleared, and a series of three rooms excavated beside the N wall of the church proper, with which they are contemporary. The most W of these rooms contained several built tombs. At the E end of the N aisle a door leads to a room which communicates with an extensive space originally covered by a brick vault and floored with clay tiles and fragments of reused marble. In front of the N doorway into the narthex were identified two masonry piers which must have carried the roof of a porch of a kind comparable to a feature of the aithrion of the Octagon at Philippi. (Ergon I980, 18-19). THESPROTIA AND EPIRUS Arta (Ancient Ambracia). Within the ancient city an 80.6 m. stretch of a street was found with buildings either side; two architectural phases, C and HL, have been identified. One building, perhaps a prytaneion, suggests this is the public quarter; it has an aithrion with central altar; one of the rooms opening off the peristyle, identified as an andron, has a mosaic floor. (Kathemerini 25.4.81). Kassope. During I980 the collaboration between S. Dakaris (AS) and the DAI architects W. Hoepfner and L. Schwandner continued most fruitfully (AR 1979-80, 42; AR 1980-81, 28). Streets 6 and 7 were completely cleared; the surface of 7 was seen to have been laid following the I67 B.C. destruction, while that of 6 (Fig. 60) was contemporary with Fig. 60 the construction of the HL hostelry. In the hostelry itself, study was made of the underlying building remains, where the main design had remained largely unaltered for 300 years from the 4th cent. B.C. Much 3rd cent. B.C. pottery was found in the S and E wings, including material of West Slope style. The under- lying building had had a central court surrounded by ranges of rooms either in two stages, or a single range with an outer portico. Structural evidence suggests this early building had been two storied. Pottery and coin evidence dated the con- struction of the earlier building to the end of the 4th cent. B.C.; the HL hostelry should be dated to the end of the 3rd cent. B.C. The first structure was probably a public building, a predecessor of the hostelry. Further examination of House 5 revealed a long history from the 4th-Ist cents B.C. It is of standard N Greek type, with central court and no external portico. Its outside walls have been preserved virtually to their original height. The house's interest is enhanced by a series of alter- ations that cover its life, associated with important ceramic and coin evidence, the close dating of which will be of great value to future LC and HL studies in Epirus. Among I39 coins found was a AV coin of Ptolemy I Soter (Ergon I980, I5-I7). Asprochaliko. Representatives of Cambridge University have been working in Ioannina Museum since I979 completing the study of material from the late E. S. Higgs' surveys and excavations of the I960s in preparation for publication (AR 1962-63, 22-3; AR 1963-64, I4; AR 1964-65, I8-I9; AR 1965-66, I3; AR 1966-67, 13-14; AR 1967-68, I3). In I98I the main trench at Asprochaliko was reopened to check the stratigraphy and collect samples for radiocarbon dating. G. Bailey describes the work as follows: 'The sections of the upper deposit within the area of the rock overhang proved to be in excellent condition, due mainly to the cemented nature of the material. In contrast, the S area of the main trench, where the deep lying talus deposits occur, had been filled in with rubble, which was removed. We were also able to clean the S wall of the trench and to draw its section. This is of particular importance, since it allows us to link the E and W sections. Detailed sections of all the trench walls are now being prepared for publication (Fig. 6I). It became ap-</page><page sequence="29">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, I98I-82 31 parent that some 75 cm. of undisturbed basal Mousterian deposit still remained on bedrock in the S area of the trench. This was removed down to bedrock and provided the oppor- tunity to collect samples of burned flint for thermoluminescent dating. Part of a narrow baulk of deposit (about 50 cm. wide) against the base of the W wall was similarly removed. Prodromiou. A short account is given by A. Choremis of the warrior burial found accidentally in 1979 (AR 1979-8o, 41), which can now be seen to have been in a cist covered by a mound diam. I0.0 m. Traces of a pyre were found encapsulated within the mound as was a sealed grave, in which there was an inhumation but no offerings. Details are given of the fine bronze hydria with relief handle escutcheon portraying a drunken Silenos supported by a young satyr wearing a leopard skin (Fig. 62), comparable with another dated 350-300 B.C. (AAA XIII [I980] 3-20). Fig. 62 Fig. 6i IONIAN ISLANDS 'Although some radiocarbon samples were processed from the original excavations, these were all necessarily from the upper levels. Our aim was to collect new samples, with a reliable stratigraphic provenance, from previously sampled layers and from the Mousterian levels. We were able to collect suitable material of bone and charcoal from a number of layers, including upper palaeolithic, micro-Mousterian and Levalloiso-Mousterian levels. Burned flint should provide a useful independent check on any radiocarbon determinations. This means that for the first time we have a good chance of acquiring reliable dates for Mousterian material.' Eparchia of Merope. A report in the Greek Press refers to the discovery near the Albanian frontier of two tumuli containing 30 cist tombs, from the IIth-4th cent. B.C.; associated with the finds were EBA and MBA sherds. (Kathemerini 27.10.81). Ephyra. A. Papadopoulos (AS) conserved the remains of Tumulus B (AR 198o-81, 29); more local handmade pottery, with plastic and impressed decoration, was found, as well as small quantities of Myc. A small MBA cist tomb was found NE of Tomb A; with 2 bronze rings were fragments of local handmade pottery. (Ergon 1980, i8). Kythera. The new Archaeological Museum was opened in Chora during 1981. (Elef Kosmos 9.10.8I). Lefkas. E. Andreou has described the new exhibition in the museum of Lefkas, where finds from Dorpfeld's excavations of I906-12 are displayed, together with material from Service excavations which includes groups from the HL cemetery S of the ancient city and votive offerings from the A and C cave shrine to Pan and the Nymphs at Asvotrypa, Phryni. (AAA XIII [i980] 74-84). Kerkyra. Discoveries made in emergency excavation in the course of development in the area of the ancient city in I973-74 have been reported by A. Choremis, including the following (ADelt 29 Chr 627-44). From the Kanoni area further details are given (634-5) of the discovery of the sculptural pediment of ripe A style at a building site in Figaretto St (AR 1974-75, I9-20). The sculpture is sufficiently worn to suggest that it remained long in situ in the building to which it belonged. Excavation at the site in 1974 was made difficult by the high water table (642-4). Two main levels were investigated, in the upper of which the pediment had been found. Remains of a large court were discovered (at least I2 x 8 m.) paved with rectangular terracotta slabs, on which the pediment had fallen.</page><page sequence="30">32 H. W. CATLING An A Doric capital was found cut for secondary use as the base for a statue; a second base for a statue - ? kouros - was found with traces of lead remaining for the feet. Traces of an earlier floor were identified beneath the paved surface. In the fill over- lying the floor were found fragments of poros column drums, scraps of the sculptures in the pediment, as well as pieces of marble and limestone sculptures. At some period the area was apparently used as a stone quarry. Many roof tiles were also found, some stamped A for Damosios, as well as HL and R terracotta, pottery and other materials. From the earlier, late A and C level, came terracotta votives, the head of a statue of Dionysos, bg pottery and part of an Attic rf cup (I, crouching man). Drainage work in King Paul St, Kanoni, led to the discovery of a R building complex which included part of a mosaic floor with neat geometric design; finds included the torso of a 4th cent. B.C. marble Aphrodite (637-9). Elsewhere in the course of the same work were found building remains and water pipes of late C-early HL. Finds from this complex, rather surprisingly, include an Attic bf hydria (Fig. 63) Fig. 63 (quadriga to r., female driver mounting, palm tree), a fr. bf cup (I, Gorgon running r.) and a bf cup lip (helmeted warrior to r.). Further N in the trench other structural features of un- certain identity were found, HL-R; several water channels were found (627-630). Remains of three periods were found on King Paul St (639-642): (i) An A level, with the foundations for three columns; finds include an Attic bfsherd (warrior) and two SG terracottas. (2) A C level in which two buildings were found separated by a street (good Attic rf kotyle fragments). (3) Substantial remains of a late HL building with a well, in which was a pointed amphora and household equipment. Many coins, chiefly issues of Kerkyra, were found. E of the road between Kerkyra town and Kanoni, a building of developed R date was found to which (apart from a court with mosaic floor) little definition could be given (632). At the Olive Institute (635-6) excavations uncovered additional elements of a known R bath. Earlier material (C and HL) was found in levels preceding the wall construction, including a fragment of a clay mould for a hare. At Benitzes was found part of a R bath building, other parts of which were already known from discoveries in an adajcent plot (cf 0. Riemann, Les lies loniennes 37-4I). Four inhumation graves were found inserted into its remains (632-4). At Ay. Theodoroi St, remains of a rectangular altar (6.50 m. x 2.80 m.) were found in a drainage trench; a 5th cent. B.C. sherd was found in the krepis and may date its construction (630-2). Kerkyra: Lefkimmi. A. Choremis reports the discovery of a marble head of a woman (Kerk. 2428), R work copying a 4th cent. B.C. original (ADelt 29 Chr 636). CENTRAL MACEDONIA Thessaloniki. Public concern at the progress of repairs to the major monuments of the city damaged in the 1978 earth tremors continued in 198I; emphasis was laid bythe authorities on the volume and complexity of the work required (Vima 12.3.8 ). In ADelt 29 Chr 653-674; 676-693 0. Alexandri and A. Rhomiopoulou have given preliminary notes on emergency excavations on development sites during I973-74. P. Lazarides has similarly reported on ECh and Byz discoveries. Sites referred to in what follows may be approximately located from the moder street names (for a street plan see B. de Jongh, Mainland Greece [London I979] I84-5. Better is the Touristikos Hartis Poleos Thessalonikis). Museums. A. Despoini has described the reorganisation in the storerooms in 1973, particularly in the sculpture and epi- graphic collection (ADelt 29 Chr 676). A. Rhomiopoulou describes and illustrates some of the chance finds of sculpture (Fig. 64) and inscriptions that entered the collection during Fig. 64 1974, chiefly from Thessaloniki and its environs (687-91). Ch. Tsiourmi and D. Bakirtzis have published a catalogue and study of the Ionic capitals stored at the Rotonda of the 4th cent. A.D. and later. (Makedonika 20, 218-36). G. Touratsoglou and K. Loverdou-Tsigaridou have published nine coin hoards (six late Roman; three I3th cent. A.D.) in the care of the Byzantine Ephoria. Four of the Roman hoards (4th cent. A.D.) were found in graves in Salonika itself. The mediaeval hoards came from Serres, probably from the area of the Metropolis; one is of particular interest for containing late Latin issues of the Constantinople mint (ADelt 3I [1976] Mel 23-48; English summary, 359-60). In the ancient city many HL, R, LR and ECh features and buildings came to light. The city's walls and street system came to light at several points. Part of the W circuit of the wall was cleared on Irinis and Mavili, where both wall and pro- teichisma were studied; the latter is later than the wall. The</page><page sequence="31">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, I981-82 33 intervals between towers were recorded; spolia (architectural members including seats from the hippodrome and sculptures) were noted (681). A section of the wall of Galerian 11.40 m. long was found in a plot on Philikis Etaireias and Dem. Margariti, preserved to a height of 2.35 m. A second reinforcing wall, 1.40 m. wide, was found on the N side. Two LR graves were found at the N foot of the wall - one contained a pottery jug, two glass birds and a glass sphere (673-4). A section of a N-S road was found on Antigonidhou, and beside it architec- tural elements evidently belonging to a monumental LR building incorporating a colonnade (691). On Philippou part of a R building complex and slabbed street were found, other parts of which had been located earlier in adjacent building plots. In lower levels, HL material was recovered (coins etc. of the 4th-2nd cents B.C. (681-2). Parts of known public buildings were found at several points; part of the palace of Galerian (AR 1970-71, I9) was located in a plot on Vyronos (678). Several water channels were found, some secondary to the main building (658). On the same street were building remains of the 4th cent. A.D., overlying levels of the 2nd and Ist cents B.C., as well as terra sigillata of the 2nd cent. A.D. The site is near the W stoa of the Agora and close to its W decumanus (691-3). A building plot on Makedonikis Amynis and Philippou yielded remains belonging to the crytoporticus of the ancient Agora, which extends as far as the W stoa of the Agora (693). Part of the LR Hippodrome and a group of Byz and post-Byz graves were found at a building site at Hippodromou and Manousogiannaki. Part of the foundation for the seats on the E side of the race course came to light, parallel to which was a built drain for collecting storm water. 32 tombs were found, rectangular masonry structures in serried ranks, overlying the remains of the Hippodrome. The majority were disturbed, but several contained glazed bowls, bronze earrings, spherical amulets, glass vessels and coins (656-8). Part of a rectilinear monumental building was discovered in a plot on Olympou and Agnostou Stratiotou, with a substantial niche built into the NE wall (664-6). On Iasonidou and Christopoulou part of a monu- mental building came to light, one of whose walls included four brick-built arches carried on masonry piers, and traces of an earlier structure (654-6). Part of two adjacent ?LR circular buildings were investigated in a building plot on Megalou Alexandrou. The larger appears to have consisted of two relatively narrow concentric walls 3.80 m. apart enclosing a central area paved with marble slabs, evidently originally open to the sky (661-4). On Philippou 74, a structural complex of several phases was found, chiefly imperial R, but with evidence of later occupation during ECh. The R buildings were founded on levels containing abundant HL material. This part of the city between the ancient Agora and the Rotonda had been particularly densely occupied in R and ECh times (682-7). A confusing building complex was found on Palaion Patron Germanou where LR remains were identified, including part of a house with rooms paved with mosaic in two layers (66I). Quite long building sequences are described at some sites. On Amynta and Mitsaeon an imperial R building was founded on HL remains, and itself replaced by ECh structures (68I). On Valaoritou, remains of several phases, all R, and several water lines were found (653) (Fig. 65). A complex of occupation from HL to LR was found on Philippou and Arrianou (674). Other complexes, all dated LR and later, with two or more occupation periods, were identified on Skra (658-6I), Patriarch loachim and Plateia Ay. Yeorgiou (670), Taskou Papageorghiou (670-2), Gregoriou Palama (666-9) and Egnatias (659). Bath- buildings were located at several points, including one on Prophitou Elia with hypocaustal rooms (673). Others, all datable Fig. 65 to LR, were found on Theophilou and Eleusinos (654), Sophokleous (673) and Mavili (737). Several finds were made in the ancient cemeteries. The Greek Press reported the discovery of a 'Macedonian' tomb on Odos Romanou, close to the E line of the city wall (Avgi 21.11.81). The Press also reported the discovery of 17 A and C tombs in a cemetery in the Ay. Paraskevi district, including at least one warrior burial, weapons, bronze and clay (Attic and Corinthian) vases (Mesemvrini 3I.Io.8I). On Odos Oraiokastrou, Stavroupolis, a mid-4th cent. B.C. tomb constructed of poros slabs with extremely rich contents was found (a similarly rich tomb was found here in 1964 - ADelt 20 [I965] 441 and pls 462-3) includ- ing jewellery of gold and silver, silver and bronze vessels. (Some of this material is described and illustrated in the exhi- bition catalogue Treasures of Ancient Macedonia [Athens 1979] nos 278-306). The most remarkable object is probably the silver-clad diphros, but the gold jewellery includes objects of exceptional delicacy (Figs. 66, 67) (693). On Odos Nigdis a group of LR built tombs was discovered belonging to the W cemetery. One was plastered internally and decorated with red and green painted bands. Finds include bronze coins, pottery and bronze vessels and a bronze buckle (644). A group of 17 LR and ECh tombs found on Ambelonon (also part of the W cemetery) had few finds (691). 82 tombs were excavated in an ECh cemetery at Panepistimioupolis, the majority of which were simple rectangular graves cut into the subsoil and covered with slabs, some of which were reused tombstones, inscribed. Very few graves contained offerings. Tile graves occurred. Others were lined with masonry. Though many of the graves con- tained only a single burial, others had two or three, and several contained skeletal remains from secondary burial. Below one</page><page sequence="32">34 H. W. CATLING of the structural complex at the S portico originally excavated in I9I9 (see Hebrard in BCH xliv [1920] 5-40). The hexagonal structure immediately S of the hall of the ambo was partly investigated; it had a marble dado, and wall paintings up to the cupola which was decorated with mosaics. On the S side of the hall of the ambo an area of marble paving was found and a pair of column bases virtually in situ, in line with the two columns which composed the entrance to the hall of the ambo represent- ing the end of a colonnaded processional way leading from the arch of Galerius to the Rotonda. During the work, a number of graves were found which had been used for a series of burials during the Tourkokratia (742-3). At the church of Panayia Acheiropoietos conservation took place on the mosaics in the soffits of three of the arches in the N arcade (Fig. 69), and on Fig. 66 Fig. 67 Fig. 69 Fig. 68 grave was found an HL grave containing a bg kalyx-krater decorated in relief. A marble funerary relief(Fig. 68), HL, was also found (669-70). The city's later history was illuminated at several points. During conservation work on the Eptapyr- ghion two phases of construction in the walls were observed, one characteristic of ECh masonry, the other typical of the masonry that marks the first years of the Tourkokratia (730). In a plot on Monolaki Kyriakou, a four-period building was excavated (R, ECh, Byz and post-Byz) (737-9). Work on the church of Ay. Yeoryios (=the Rotonda=the Mausoleum of Galerius) involved expanding investigation of the foundations the mosaic floor first found in I927 below the slabbed floor of the N aisle. This floor belonged to a R building of uncertain type. On the removal of part of the mosaic the remains of an earlier chequerboard floor of square slabs, a still earlier floor, mosaic, with a complex geometric design was also found, probably datable A.D. 50-I00 (75I-4). Radical repairs were carried out in the church of Ayios Pantaleimon (Fig. 70). (748-5I). A. Rhomiopoulou reports the discovery of ECh walls in a building plot on Mackenzie King St. close to the church of Ay. Sophia, possibly associable with that church's ECh basilican predecessor (678-8I). The date of the mosaics in the dome of this church has been restudied by K. Theocharidou. The mosaic now consists of diverse elements - the Ascension, occupying the hemisphere, below which are inscriptions and a garland; part of the garland shows signs of later repair. The garland and the Ascension are secondary; parallels point to the 9th cent.; the inscriptions may well date to 690 (540 or 570 are also possible). (ADelt 3 I [1978] Mel 265-73). Th. Mantopoulou has studied the evidence concerning the architectural develop- ment of the vanished Church of Ay. Dimitrios 'parathalassios', destroyed in the fire of August 1890. The church, probably built in the late I3th or early I4th cent., was originally dedi- cated to the Panayia; the dedication was shared with Ay. Dimitrios when his basilica was made into a mosque in I491.</page><page sequence="33">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1981-82 35 Fig. 71 Fig. 70 It became the metropolitan church of Thessaloniki after the church of Ay. Yeoryios (the Rotonda) became a mosque in I590. (Makedonika 20, I75-93). A work of value to students of vernacular architecture is N. K. Moutsopoulos (ed.) Ano Poli Thessalonikis (Salonika, Ministry of Works, 1979). Sindos (Thessaloniki). A most useful summary of the results of the I98I excavation of this exceptional A and C cemetery under the direction of A. Despoini has been published in the Greek magazine Epikaira 19.11.81, 67-72 (AR 1980-81, 29). 120 tombs have now been found, in stone or clay coffins (Fig. 71) below thick alluvium from the Echedorus River (modern Gallicos). The cemetery may be the burial ground for one phase of the nearby settlement mound of N. Anchialos (apparently occupied continuously from PR to R times). This site might be the ancient Chalastra - other possibilities are ancient Sindos or Strepsa. At the time of the floruit of the Sindos cemetery (c. 540-470 B.C.) the area E of the Axios was occupied by the Mygdones. By the 4th cent. B.C. the cemetery had been abandoned and the area was used as a pottery factory; four kilns have been found. The funeral gifts froml the tombs include quantities of bronze objects and iron weapons (whose preservation is poor, thanks to the damp burial conditions), imported Attic and Corinthian pottery, and a considerable quantity of gold jewellery, includ- ing a finger ring with elliptical bezel inscribed AQPON; this must be the earliest known inscription from the area of Thessaloniki. Outstanding are the five gold face masks (Fig. 72), two of which belonged to male burials, three to female. In four cases, the masks were found beside the skulls, but in a fifth (where the bronze helmet was still in situ on the skull) the mask was found covering the face, leaving no doubt that this was its function. Other details have been given in shorter Press Fig. 72 announcements as the excavation progressed, including the following: In March two graves of the 3rd cent. B.C. were found, one containing a child's burial covered with a marble slab decorated in relief with rams and inscribed "Z7ocua ri 18iia ETroriaE" (Apoyevmatini and Nea 28.3.81). Reports of other discoveries appear in June '81, with reference to a very unusual clay coffin decorated in relief. Three tombs datable to c. 480 B.C. were found with Attic and Corinthian vases, bronze necklaces. (Vima 3.6.8 ). During July a child's grave was found with toys - a four-wheeled iron cart, a terracotta pig and a pigeon (Nea 4.7.8I). A tomb found shortly afterwards</page><page sequence="34">36 H. W. CATLING of the 5th cent. B.C. was notable for an Attic bf krater (war- riors, women); the grave contained the skeleton of a warrior with sword, the body covered with gold bands (Nea 7.7.81). Mesimerion (20 km. S of Thessaloniki). A. Rhomiopoulou reports the discovery in 1974 of a built tomb of 'Macedonian' type near a previously discovered tomb of similar type. The new tomb had been pillaged; only a few HL sherds were found (ADelt 29 Chr 697). Dion (Pierias). D. Pantermalis has described excavations undertaken in 1973 and 1974 (cf. AR 1980-81, 29) by the University of Thessaloniki under his direction. Work con- centrated on the central street where a series of poros slabs was found carved in relief with shields and corslets of two types; these probably formed a decorative frieze for a monumental building. Three shrine buildings were investigated (Oikos A, B and C); finds included HL and later sculpture, a bilingual Greek and Latin inscription, and terracottas. One building could be associated with the cult of Demeter, a second with Asclepius. A building adjacent to the W gate in the defence wall was identified as a reservoir. (ADelt 29 Chr 677-700). Dion: Karysta. A. Rhomiopoulou reports the discovery in 1974 in the village of a built vaulted R tomb containing ten burials. (ADelt 29 Chr 697). Ayios Dimitrios Kitrou (Pierias). A. Rhomiopoulou reports the identification of a cemetery of inhumation graves, probably EByz, with few grave goods - bronze rings, bracelets and earrings and remains of weapons. (ADelt 29 Chr 647). Pella. Activity during 1973-74 has been reported by M. Karamanoli-Siganidou in ADelt 29 Chr 708-I4. A new museum was opened in 1973, and a miscellany of chance finds was made during 1974, chiefly sculpture, grave reliefs and funerary inscriptions, including a marble block containing six cup-sinkings, standards of liquid measurement, the one a sub- division of the other (713-14). In a trial excavation in 1974 S of the modern Salonika-Edessa road, W of House I in zone IV, a house 7.0 x 7.0 m. came to light in whose destruction level was a mass of painted plaster. A large cist tomb was found in the modern village, with remains of its grave goods, in- cluding gold jewellery, bg pottery and a lamp (7I0-I3). The Greek Press reported continued research excavation under the direction of M. Karamanoli-Siganidou (cf AR 198o-81, 29). The late 3rd-early 2nd cent. B.C. pottery factories in the NE part of the site have been further explored: their wealth of coins is thought to point to their commercial importance. More than 200 moulds for Megarian bowls have now been found; while the decorative elements are chiefly floral, they include 'Homeric' scenes, scenes from the hippodrome and erotic subjects. Many moulds were found for terracotta statuettes. Apparently found in the same area is a marble head of Alexander. Beyond the town is the circular sanctuary previously reported; this has an altar at the centre associated with quantities of terracottas in a great variety of types, the commonest of which are archaizing korai, pitcher-bearers, matronly figures, torsos of Artemis, fine male portrait heads, bearded, youthful male figures wearing himatia, horses, pigs, bucrania, gorgoneia, etc. The shrine should be one for Demeter and Kore, with a parallel cult of Artemis and Poseidon. Excavation was also undertaken in the 4th cent. B.C. cemetery beyond the NE town limits. Of outstanding interest from this site is an Attic rfhydria of c. 400 B.C. (Contest of Athena and Poseidon), and a fine grave relief of the youth Xanthos shown in profile holding a dead bird, his hunting dog beside him. (Avgi and Akropolis 9.7.8I). Assiros Toumba. K. A. Wardle, for the British School, undertook a cleaning season at the prehistoric and DA mound (cf. AR 1980-81, 30-2). He writes: 'An extended season of study was carried out between June and late September. The opportunity was taken to clean all the walls excavated before I979 in the S part of the main area and to re-examine the plans of each building phase. Now that the bricks had dried and could be seen more clearly it was possible to detect where mud bricks from a different source had been used, often showing the level at which rebuilding took place. In several places it was obvious that an earlier wall had been 'cut back' to sound brick-work and that the replacement was built directly on this. The character of walls also varied accord- ing to their function. Those which enclosed a roofed area were soundly and regularly built while those which separated yard from yard or street were flimsy and frequently patched. As in the modern village these walls may have been quite low, and being unroofed suffered considerable weathering. Although in general stone foundations were not used at Assiros, more have been identified, almost always in walls adjacent to a street where they will have served to protect the exposed foot of the wall from erosion by rain-water flowing along the street. 'In the W area (NA/HC) excavation in I980 had continued until the last available moment; now cleaning and study of the exposed sections, walls and floors permitted each phase to be separated and the plan of the settlement in phase 6 to be com- pleted for the excavated areas (Fig. 73).

Additionally the first IA phase (3), represented by a level of soft grey debris of varying thickness, contains at least two, probably three episodes. There can, therefore, be very little gap, if any, between Bronze and Iron Age deposits. Moreover, the wall alignments of phase 3 follow those of phase 5 closely, whereas the destruction of phase 6 had clearly been so great that wall alignments were changed and in places the streets were built over.

II5o B.C.) can now be predicted from the excavated area (Fig. 73) which comprises some I5% of the total area at the summit of the mound. Two parallel streets running E-W about 8 m. apart probably reach to the edge of the mound on either side. Between and on either side of them are blocks of rooms and yards. Although the yard areas are in general twice as large as the roofed areas, two oversize rooms can be seen in this phase, of which one (Room 20) has a central posthole and may be 6 m. long, while the other is 7 m. in length. No trace of any central N-S street has been found and access in this direction must have been from the perimeter of the mound. One yard extends the full distance between the two streets and may have provided limited communication between them. 'Drainage will clearly have been a persistent problem in a settlement of this kind, especially considering the nature of the local clay which softens and becomes very sticky in wet weather. The gradient of the streets from E to W is sufficient to encourage run-off. Open yard areas seem to have been raised slightly above adjacent streets for the same reason. In several cases, however, the floor levels of roofed compart- ments are at a lower level than the neighbouring street, implying that raised thresholds may have been necessary to keep out the water.' CHALKIDIKI Petralona. Investigation of the cave continued during I98I (AR 1980-81, 32) as did the controversies generated by it. Further excavation, according to the Press, yielded two human skeletons of 800,000 B.P. (Rizospastis 30.5.82). Nea Kallikrateia. A. Despoini reports the discovery in 1973 of C tombs and a very fine stela sculptured in relief (Thessa- loniki 6876) portraying a girl with a dove in her left hand (Fig. 74) (ADelt 29 Chr 677-8). Vrasta. A. Rhomiopoulou reports the discovery in I974 of a hoard of 306 skyphate Byz bronze coins. (ADelt 29 Chr 696). Sane. A. Rhomiopoulou reports the collection of abundant A pottery during the construction of a marina. Material, though chiefly Corinthian, included Attic. The site appears to be one of the 'Euboean' colonial settlements in the Chalcidice (ADelt 29 Chr 696). Sane: Ormos Xenophontos. O. Alexandri reports the discovery in 1973 in development work of a complex of structures destroyed violently; in the destruction horizon nine AV coins were found: two of Constantine Tiberius, three of Mauricius Tiberius, four of Phokas I and two of Heraklios (6Io-4I). Architectural members were also found in the destruction. Nearby a tripartite rectilinear building came to light, as well as some EByz tombs (ADelt 29 Chr 674-7). Fig. 74 N. Nikonanos reports further investigation of late Antique and ECh building remains, including two rooms with badly preserved LR mosaic floors. The building seems to have been used as a bath in ECh times. (ADelt 29 Chr 774). Mariana Olynthou. N. Nikonanos reports the discovery of Byz remains (churches, water mills, water tanks) and an ECh basilica in the area of the ancient city. Mariana is known from documentary sources to belong to the Monastery of Docheiarion. (ADelt 29 Chr 774-6). Potidaea. A. Despoini has reported further on the emer- gency excavation of a 5th-4th cent. B.C. cemetery found in road works, associated with grave stelai suggesting the burials included those of Athenian cleruchs (cf AR 1974-75, 20). Material illustrated includes jewellery (Fig. 75) (bracelets with serpent-head terminals - cf. Collection Hle'lne Stathatos nos I 2-5; fibulae - cf Jacobsthal, Greek Pins 204-8) and imported Attic rf and bg vases, including a rf squat lekythos (woman), a bg pointed amphoriskos and squat lekythos, both with reeded body (Fig. 76). (ADelt 29 Chr 677). Kallithea. E. Yiouri has reported on work undertaken at the sanctuary of Zeus Ammon in I973 (see AR 1971-72, 16-17; AR 1973-74, 26).

M. Andronikos has replied (Greek and English texts) to suggestions that the Great Tomb found in 1977 could not be that of Philip II but that it was made for Philip III Arrhidaios and his wife Eurydike (Lehmann in AJA 84 [1980] 527-3I), seeking in particular to rebut the views that vault construction was unknown in Greece before Alexander's eastern campaigns and that the use of the diadem as a mark of royalty does not predate his travels (AAA XIII [1980] I56-78). The Greek Press in November I98I carried M. Andronikos' reports of his very fruitful season's work in the princely ceme- tery of Vergina. Among the most interesting results were the following: further examination of the feature in the great tumulus at first identified as an altar shows that it constitutes the remains of the brick-built structure on which the funeral pyre was raised; ivory objects were found, and pieces of gold in its debris identified as belonging to the gold wreath from the larger gold larnax. Further afield, as a result of beginning to clean the Macedonian tomb originally found by the French expedition in I86I, a mound nearby was investigated in which three 'Macedonian' tombs were found as well as a small square unlooted tomb, containing merely the ashes of the dead and a small gold wreath placed on top. The other three were pillaged, but of great interest. The largest has a built dromos 7.5 m. long; its facade is Doric - the pediment has an abnorm- ally high cornice. The antechamber's roof is flat, the chamber itself vaulted. The wall rendering is of fine quality, with well preserved red, yellow and white. The door into the chamber was two-leaved, of marble; inside was an imposing stone kline-sarcophagus with a very fine painted foot, and painted decoration. The second tomb has only one chamber, but immediately above the doorway is a remarkable painting: a standing warrior (presumably the dead man) has a woman beside him holding a gold wreath and extending her hand towards him; there is a warrior seated to right. The new tombs appear to date to c. 300 B.C. An unexpected find in the main cemetery area is a roughly built enclosure wall, the function of which is uncertain though Andronikos suggests the possibility that it surrounded the camp of the Gaulish mercenaries of 274/3 B.C. Elsewhere, the defences of the acropolis have been cleared of overgrowth and systematic excavation has begun. The fortification perimeter exceeds 1500 m., with two construction phases, the earlier of the 4th cent. B.C. Two gates and a tower have come to light, as well as piped water lines following the wall. Two houses have been excavated E of the palace, one 2nd cent. B.C., the other with two building phases, HL and R. Near these buildings was a tomb, probably R, constructed of earlier material among which is a fine threshold block and the lower part of a funerary inscription, probably of the 4th cent. B.C. In the tumulus cemetery one of the largest mounds was investigated and found to contain three looted tombs. Two were small, square in plan, their inside walls carefully rendered; one was decorated with painted florals and garlands. Outside the graves was found a deep level with remains of burning and a number of small objects and a mass of pottery; the Attic imports date the deposit to 320/3Io B.C. The bulk of the pottery is local and offers an unusually rich 4th cent. series, pointing to an exceptionally long tradition in Macedonian pottery. (Nea and Makedonika 3.11.81). The parade shield from the 'Philip II' tomb continues to make good progress in the hands of its restorers; the design on the outside includes spirals and maeanders, with a male and a female figure at the centre. (Rizospastis 16.4.81). Verroia. Emergency excavations in 1973-74 have been described by A. Rhomiopoulou, Y. Touratsoglou and P. Lazarides in ADelt 29 Chr 701-6, 714-20, 721-4, 736-7, 755-8. In the ancient town a complex of HL and R buildings came to light in a plot on Prophitou Elia in an area which must have been the R centre. Many HL (Macedonian League) and imperial R coins were found (701). Many finds are reported from the cemeteries (for the topography of which now see Drougou and Touratsoglou, Ellenistikoi Laxefti Taphoi Veroias, Sched. I). 24 late 5th and early 4th cent. B.C. tombs were found in 1973 in the NE cemetery during road widening (two were R), the first archaeological confirmation of the 5th cent. settlement of the town, though even now the finds are a little later than Thucydides' date (i 61.4). Finds include gold jewellery (a fine pair of earrings with terminals in the form of a nude Aphrodite) and much bg pottery. Attic rf vases include pieces belonging to the late groups well repre- sented at Olynthos (Fig. 79) (7I4-7). Later work located a Fig. 79 rock-cut vaulted tomb in the same area, the construction of which had destroyed a number of C tombs. The burials were accompanied by a rich assemblage of pottery (including West Slope types), lamps, terracotta statuettes (some of superb quality), jewellery and metal objects. The complex may be dated 200-I50 B.C. (719, and Drougou-Touratsoglou, op. cit. 45 ff.). Five graves were found in the SE cemetery of the ancient town; at least one was ECh. Three grave stelai (two inscribed) (Fig. 80) were found in loose earth (7I7-8). In the S cemetery groups of HL, R and Byz tombs were found (AR 1978-79, 28). In 1973, some 60 tombs were investigated, including two HL built tombs of 'Macedonian' type; these were in the same cutting, single chambered with vaulted roofs, with a Doric pedimental facade. In front of one was a built cist tomb containing a woman's burial with HL vases and terra- cottas, and goldjewellery. Finds from the built tombs suggest a date in the 2nd cent. B.C. The remaining tombs were chiefly</page><page sequence="38">40 H. W. CATLING Fig. 80 simple inhumations and a few slab-lined graves, sometimes covered with reused slabs, including R and ECh inscriptions (70I). Five tombs were found here in 1974, one of which contained an AE coin of Hadrian. Tomb IV contained reused marble panelling of fine quality as the walls of the cist and the tomb's cover slab (Fig. 8I) (7I7). In the W cemetery a rock- cut vaulted tomb was found with carved pedimental faqade; its contents of pottery, lamps, bronze and iron objects, and gold jewellery, are datable early in the second half of the 2nd cent. B.C. (719; Drougou and Touratsoglou, op. cit. I9-43). A group of ECh tombs was found in 1974 at Kato Eleas, all without grave offerings. Several inscriptions were found, perhaps having been put to secondary use as tomb covers. One inscription of the mid-3rd A.D. refers to an Ephebarch and a Gymnasiarch (721-3). The remains of a small ECh basilica continued to be studied at the Porphyry plot, which seems to have been constructed in immediate association with two vaults, doubtless originally used for burial, and a more extensive cemetery, probably belonging to the Ch community of Verroia (757-8). Among chance discoveries are two marble female portrait heads (Fig. 82) temp. Faustina the younger and Lucilla (724). Edessa. Discoveries in 1973-74 are reported in ADelt 29 Chr 706-10, 739 by M. Karamanoli-Siganidou and P. Lazarides. The Akropolis Wall was found in a plot on Odos Arg. Kytanon and elsewhere; a square tower was found, with Med repairs. A group of LR inhumation graves with plain pottery Fig. 82 and bronze ornaments was found on Argyrokastron and Mazaraki (706-8, 7I0). ECh graves were excavated on Odos Proussis and at Ay. Loukas Longou. Fragments of funerary inscriptions were also found, and some small bronzes (7I0,739). A. Vavritsasworked during 1979-81 in the lower town of the ancient city at Longos. The walls have been cleaned of over- growth, and columns re-erected on the Via Colonnata, the central street of the city. Excavation was undertaken in an area that is likely to prove the urban centre, and has revealed three main phases in the occupation of the site, one early, one late C and HL, the uppermost R and Byz. At one point a room of Phase 2 was identified whose walls and ceiling (?) had been rendered in plaster and painted with architectural designs. Associated with the second phase were child burials in pithoi, without grave offerings, perhaps the result of an epidemic. Much pottery and many coins have been found. (Ell. Vorras 8.3.81). Naousa. Y. Touratsoglou reports excavation continuing in 1973 in a cemetery of the 5th and 4th cents B.C. where 130 tombs have now been dug (ADelt 29 Chr 719-20), and also the discovery of a sculptured R gravestone (seated woman to r.; three frontal busts) (Fig. 83) that marked a cone-shaped pit grave where an inhumation burial was covered by a mass of stone (op. cit. 725).

Sampsaris has published an inscription said to have been found at Palaikastro, SW of Terpni, thought to be the R station at Graero. The text (on a marble stele) is dated 2nd-3rd cent. A.D., recording the construction of a basilica with exedra and three porticos at the expense of a woman who seems to have been a member of the local aristoc- racy. Theories are advanced about the earlier history of the town (Makedonika 20 [I980] i-8). Fig. 84 Fig. 86 Nea Kerdylia (Amphipolis). L. Parlama reports the dis- covery in 1974 of a built tomb of'Macedonian' type at km. 9I on the Salonika-Kavala road. The tomb, datable to the mid- 4th cent. B.C., had a dromos with vaulted roof. There had been a two-leaf marble door into the (? unfinished) chamber. Fragments of the unfinished marble kline were recovered. (ADelt 29 Chr 787-8). Amphipolis. Exploration and clearance of the fortifications was continued in 1980 by D. Lazarides (AS). A round tower was found E of the S summit at a point of great natural strategic strength and importance for the protection of the E flank of the 'long wall' of Thucydides. Among fine Attic rf pottery found at the tower site are a pyxis lid fr., women at work, and a closed vase fr., youth and girl wearing stephanai, left (Figs. 84, 85). Other finds included a gabled marble stele with oak wreath in relief and an unfinished Ionic capital. Three other areas were also excavated - a short section of the wall and a tower with successive building phases at the SE corner of a natural terrace; the site of Gate E, probably of R date; S of this gate a section of wall was found, together with a semi- circular tower (Fig. 86). Beyond the E circuit of the wall a group of seven R tile graves came to light whose contents included terracotta statuettes of a woman, animals and birds (Ergon 1980, I3-I4). Christian Amphipolis. Further clearance was made in 1980 by E. Stikas (AS) of the inscribed hexagonal church (Fig. 87) (AR 1979-8o, 44; AR 1980-81, 33-4), concentrating upon the aithrion (9.45x 12.20 m.), surrounded by porticos whose columns had been carried on slabbed stylobates.

W. CATLING the porticos had been two-storied. While the floor of the open court was paved with white marble slabs, that of the porticos was covered with elegant opus sectile. Fragments of wall plaster with embedded tesserae show some at least of the walls had been decorated with mosaics. An elaborate Corinthian capital was found, recalling others found earlier (cf. AR 1980-81, 33, fig. 57). (Ergon 1980, I4-I5). Podochoria. E. Aliprantis reports the discovery in 1973 of an ECh three-aisled basilica with narthex, exonarthex and baptistery some I5 km. E of Amphipolis. The remains of a later single-aisled church were found at the E end of the central aisle. The walls appear to have been partly decorated with mosaic, partly painted. Parts of the building had mosaic floors. The church had been destroyed by fire (ADelt 29 Chr 838-41). Angisti. Ch. Koukouli-Chrysanthaki has reported on further work in 1974 (in collaboration with W. Hoepfner) on the looted tomb of'Macedonian' type inserted in the 3rd cent. B.C. into a PR settlement mound (AR 1968-69, 24; AR 1978-79, 32). Nearly all the kline has been found; it was painted as well as sculptured in relief; the floor of the prothala- ios was covered with a plain pebble mosaic. On the threshold block of the prothalamos is preserved an engraved line divided at right angles so that the interspaces correspond to the dimensions of the triglyph and metope frieze of the tomb's facade. In clearing the dromos and the masonry of its sides, a wheelmade pot was found in situ between the angle of the facade and the dromos wall. Tests were made in the PR mound itself, in particular at a destruction horizon associated with much pottery including Myc and local imitations. Locally made pottery recalls Chauchitsa and Vardaroftsa wares, and Ayios Yeoryios and Assar Tepe in W Thrace (ADelt 29 Chr 786-7). Nome of Drama. D. Grammenos reports the excavation in 1976-77 of two LBA tumuli near Potamoi and Exoche, in the vicinity of Neurokopion. Inurned cremations and associated pottery, a few small objects and a bronze fibula were found. Much of the pottery is decorated with white colour-filled incisions - inkrustierte Keramik, or Heurtley's Third Incised Style (Fig. 88). The chronology, wider distribution and signifi- cance of this fabric is discussed. A number of other ancient sites located in the vicinity are described (AE 1979, Parart 26-71 [English summary]). Galepsos. Ch. Koukouli-Chrysanthaki reports the dis- covery of three cist tombs containing inhumations of the 6th cent. B.C. Grave goods included bronze fibulae and pottery (ADelt 29 Chr 785-6). Drama. Ch. Penna reports the study and repair of the Church of the Archangels in 1973-74, with a description of the spolia found incorporated into its structure. An excavation beneath the S portico revealed a built osteotheke with vaulted roof; nearby part of the town wall came to light. A LR built tomb, vaulted with two benches was found not far away on Odos Venezeleiou (ADelt 29 Chr 850-4). Potamoi Dramas. The Greek Press reports the discovery, in a small handmade pot, of a hoard of 360 AR coins, closed c. 325 B.C.; it includes 58 staters of Philip II, and small denomi- nations of Neapolis and Thasos (Makedonia 3.7.8 ). Fig. 89 Fig. 90 Philippi. Ch. Bakirtzis has described the newly opened ECh gallery in the Museum containing material, chiefly architectural sculpture and inscriptions, from recent exca- vations at Philippi. Mosaic floors (Fig. 89) from the ECh country house at Piyes tis Voiranis near Bounarbasi have been relaid in front of the Museum (AAA XIII [1980] 90-8). G.

Diomedia (Nome of Xanthi). P. Pantos reports study of a prehistoric occupation mound with abundant surface pottery, particularly LN (=Karanovo III). He regards the site as of exceptional importance. The site continued in later occupation, when it will have been within the territory of Abdera. (ADelt 29 Chr 828). Koutson (Nome ofXanthi). D. Triantaphyllos reports the discovery of an extensive settlement between Koutson and Vaphaiika, SE of Xanthi. Test excavations showed a long, varied occupation. A possible funerary peribolos of the early 5th cent. B.C. had been built over by a HL house; in its ruins was an extensive LR cemetery, probably 4th cent. A.D. Stephanos of Byzantium refers to one town, Vergepolis, in this region (which must have been under the control of Abdera) but there is no evidence yet to support the identification of the site with Vergepolis (ADelt 29 Chr 8Io-3). Abdera. D. Triantaphyllos reports the excavation in 1973 of a cist tomb and two funerary pithoi within the ancient cemetery. The cist contained a polychrome glass alabastron, terracotta statuettes of women dancing (traces of gilding) (Fig. 91) and fine gold jewellery - earrings with flying Eros pendants, finger ring with Eros flying with a wreath to a woman (Fig. 92), ring setting for a gilded ring representing Fig. 92 Fig. 93 Aphrodite and Eros, and two necklaces, one link-in-chain and with a most elaborate clasp (Fig. 93). Two gold branches of olive leaves and flowers made up a funerary wreath. On one of the pithoi was a terracotta of a seated woman, a terracotta female protome, a glass ring stone (Herakles and the Lion). Other tombs came to light in the Abdera cemetery at Agrip Chair (ADelt 29 Chr 809-Io). D. Triantaphyllos describes many chance finds from the site of the ancient city reported in I974. These include fragments of a Clazomenian sarcophagus (see also R. M.

Mikron Doukaton (Nome of Rhodope - 9 km. S of Komotini). D. Triantaphyllos reports the discovery in 1974 near the road between Komotini and Maroneia (near ancient Lissos) of a late 7th and 6th cent. B.C. cemetery of inhumation graves of which I5 were excavated. Grave goods include pottery (imported and locally made), bronze fibulae (Fig. 96) and finger rings with spiral terminals. (ADelt 29 Chr 802-3). Fig. 95 cranes, etc. (Fig. 94). The piece is probably of local manu- facture, with much in common with the Albertinum group; date 500-470 B.C. Fragments of several grave stelae were found, as well as a remarkable terracotta statuette of a her- maphrodite, dancing (Fig. 95). The lost inscription BCHxxxvii (1913) 138, fig. 14, has been rediscovered and transferred to the Komotini Museum; it refers to the cult of Zeus Eleftherios and Rome (ADelt 29 Chr 820-2). Thermal (Nome of Xanthi, near Bulgarian frontier). D. Triantaphyllos has reported the discovery in I974 of a cave at Belenkaime containing (Thracian) EBA pottery (ADelt 29 Chr 822). Nomes of Xanthi and Rhodope. D. Triantaphyllos continued in 1973 and 1974 his archaeological exploration of the remoter parts of the Ephorate of Thrace (see AR 1978-79, 32-3). In Rhodope near Saracene (near the Bulgarian border) a cemetery of uncertain date was identified at Yiourkarki Tchai, a fortified hilltop at Asar Tepe'. Near Ano Vyrsine three un- datable sites were noted; others (including a fortified hilltop) near Myrtiski. Among sites in the lands of Smigada is a mound at Mesti with N and early EBA pottery (two other prehistoric sites have been reported nearby in the past). In Xanthi, sites have been recorded near Komnena. A fortified site near Kalyva (close to the Bulgarian frontier) was probably in HL and R use. Another fortress was identified on the W of the Nestos. Near Thermai is a rupestrian relief of Mithras and the Bull above a Fig. 96 Maroneia. The ancient city continued a focus of chance discovery and planned research by the AS and the Archaeo- logical Service from 1973-74 (D. Triantaphyllos and E. Kourkoutidou-Nikolaidou, ADelt 29 Chr 792-4, 798-802, 815-7, 834-5). Inscriptions, grave reliefs and part of a 'sundial' were added to the Archaeological Collection (792-4). Part of the ancient theatre was excavated in I98I (Nea 9.81). During 1980 E. Pentazos (AS) at Palaiopigadha continued to explore a HL building previously excavated in part (where a mosaic floor was found). A neatly paved area was found, with a shallow stone-lined pit at its centre, waterproofed with hydraulic plaster, and remains of a marble perirrhanterion on the floor. Between the mosaic floor and the paving the remains of a stylobate for six columns came to light and part of a piped Fig. 94</page><page sequence="43">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, I981-82 45 water supply (Ergon I980, ii). Excavation in 1973 near the beach at Ayios Charalambos investigated a monumental gateway, possibly Hadrianic, some of its fine masonry over 3.0 m. high, perhaps a gate into the Agora (Fig. 97). The area was replanned in Byz times when shops and stores were built among the remains of the gate (798-802). A bath building of the 6th cent. A.D. was partly cleared 500 m. E of the city wall 34-5). The whole of the E fortification has been cleaned up to the scarp, and to N and E of the tower where foundations came to light, as they did on the N side of the settlement, including five structures datable to the site's second phase. Finds in the W cemetery included burials in stone-built graves and pithoi, with some fine gold jewellery. From other tombs came rf palmette squat lekythoi, a pyxis with lid decorated with birds in rustic bf style, rfskyphoi and a reeded bg mug (Fig. 99). A pair of silver bracelets with ram's head terminals is notable. (Ergon 1980, II-3). Fig. 97 Fig. 99 Fig. 98 (8I5-7). A tile grave W of the W wall contained Ist cent. B.C. vases and a lamp (798). An ECh mosaic of the early 6th cent. A.D. was investigated at Palaiochora, probably from a basilica (Fig. 98) (834-5). A number of other sites, some pre- historic, have been recorded near the ancient city (8I4-5). Nome ofRhodope. D. Triantaphyllos reports topographic studies during 1974, describing numerous newly identified sites in the vicinity of Nea Santa, Kinyra, Iasio, Dione, Asketes and others (ADelt 29 Chr 817-20). Komaros (Nome of Evros - 5 km. N of Mesembria). P. Pantos has described a walled acropolis site near the village. Surface pottery is Greek, not Thracian, and suggests a C military post to control the Samothrake peraia. (ADelt 29 Chr 825). Mesembria. A. Vavritsas (AS) continued work on the fortified settlement and associated cemeteries (AR 1980-81, Alexandroupolis. P. Pantos reports the discovery in 1973 of 2 HL tombs in the town. One contained a bronze coin of Ainos of 280-200 B.C. (ADelt 29 Chr 825). D. Triantaphyllos reported the discovery in 1981 of seven R tile graves with 4th cent. A.D. coins during development work. (Akropolis 7.7.8I). Traianoupolis (Nome of Evros). P. Pantos reports the dis- covery in 1973 of tombs of the 5th cent. A.D., one a brick- built vaulted two-chambered structure. (ADelt 29 Chr 825-7). Didymoteichon (Nome of Evros). P. Pantos reports the identification in 1974 of the R cemetery of ancient Ploti- noupolis (ADelt 29 Chr 823). Ch. Bakirtzis has reported the investigation of post-Byz features in this important centre of communications, including rock-cut storage depots for water- pithoi and potters' kilns producing glazed wares. He demon- strates the site's importance as a pottery manufactory until relatively recent times (Balkan Studies 21 [I980] I47-53). Orestias (Nome of Evros - near the Bulgarian and Turkish frontiers). P. Pantos reports the excavation of a cremation grave of the ist cent. A.D. covered by a tumulus 12.0 m. high. A pit dug into the old ground surface had been used for burning the body. The ashes of the dead, a sword, sandals and a textile were placed in a smaller slab-covered pit. In the cremation pit were clay and bronze vases and iron strigils. (ADelt 29 Chr 823). CYCLADES Siphnos: Ayios Andreas. Examination of a room in building I on the acropolis continued in 1980 under B. Philippaki (AS). This seemed to have been an open working area in LH times (fragments of pithoi, kylikes, tripod cooking pots, animal bones); between the LH and G levels a fragment of a Ioth cent. PG skyphos with conical foot was found. The G room had been spacious, with a broad entrance whose threshold survived. (Ergon 1980, 39).</page><page sequence="44">46 H. W. CATLING Tenos. A. Hadji-Vallianou reports the discovery of a group of LR buildings in the Chora. Earlier spolia was found built into this masonry, including an inscription, part of which reads iEpila o TTS 'Api I TpEirs I Tnv|ovEiKl n o n Evo (for a shrine of Poseidon and Amphitrite on Tenos cf. AR 1974-75, 22). Also reused was a relief of a reclining man, Hermes stand- ing to right regarding the reclining figure; right of the couch a herm and a standing woman. (ADelt 28 Chr 870-I). Paros: Koukounaries. Work continued in 1980 on the LH and DA citadel under the direction of D. Schilardi (AS) (AR 1979-8o, 45 and refs; AR 1980-81, 35-7). Further confirmation was obtained of the violent destruction of the site at the LH IIIB2-IIIC transition, and the abandonment of the later settle- ment at the end of G. At the SE sector of the hill-top the third basement store was partly excavated; few decorated vases but several pithoi were found, and other objects fallen from an upper floor. Finds included a bronze double axe and a frag- ment of unworked rock crystal. The LH buildings belong to a carefully designed complex some 18 m. long, orientated N-S with three parallel ranges of rooms at right angles to the axis of the fortification wall. Other rooms were later additions to E and W. In the upper levels more PG pottery was found. A steatite G seal was found with a plant motif and a horse protome. (Ergon 1980, 38-9). Syros. A. Manthos has described surface remains, including rock cuttings and substantial building blocks on a peak on the S side of the bay of Galessa on the W of the island, associated with G and later pottery and tile fragments; an A inscription incised on a sherd is illustrated (AAA XII [I979] 39-46). Naxos. In 1980 B. Lambrinoudakis, for the AS and the University of Athens, continued his excavation at Grotta at several points. A building complex of the 4th cent. A.D. later became incorporated in a paved area surrounding two walls with water channels. Nearby was found the foundation of a rectangular PG house, with at least two phases of occupa- tion, the first ending in an earthquake. Much important G and O pottery was found in the overlying fill, and fragments of sculpture, relief pithoi and six inscriptions (one a decree of the Naxians honouring Stilbon son of Megareus, another a small dedicatory altar of a priest of Dionysos Euphanes "UrrEp ECov cEpa3cTocV"). Further excavation at the Vasilakis plot 50 m. from the sea confirmed the stratigraphy of this area, where a 3 m. fill covers the imperial R horizon, while the LH buildings are found 4-5 m. below the water table. Also at Grotta the Underwater Ephoria began the survey of the drowned part of the town revealed by air photography (AR 1980-81, 37, fig. 65). During the demolition of the Skordili house a fine E Cycladic marble statuette 0.525 m. long was found, with the head of another and an E Cycladic pottery pyxis. (Ergon I980, 36-7). D. Hadji Valianou reports the discovery in 1974 in the Chora of ii cist tombs and 6 pot burials, all HL. Nearby, a child burial in a pot was accompanied by a terracotta statuette of the 3rd cent. B.C. and other remains of similar burials (ADelt 29 Chr 867-70). At Tsangri study continued under the direction of B. Lambrinoudakis of the A temple of Gyroula. In the Tsangri area B. Lambrinoudakis reports the discovery of HL settlements at Pararyarma and at Panagitsa at the NE side of the Tsangri valley. At Ano Potamias evidence of an ancient marble quarry has been found. At Kato Potamias are remains of an ancient oil factory. Details of the piped water supply for the ancient city of Naxos are also reported (Archaeognosia 1.2, 37I-3). A. Mathaios published a 7th cent. B.C. funerary inscription built into the Church of the Transfiguration at Damarionas; it records that Arkithales made a tomb (oikos in the text) for Dameas. The only parallel for this use of oikos for a tomb is IG XII.7, 442 from Aigiale in Amorgos (Archaeognosia 1.2, 325-9). Amorgos: Lefkes. L. Marangou has reported the results of trial excavations in 1979 at Ayia Irini, where remains of buildings of excellent masonry have been found with pottery and other finds of ? late 4th-early 3rd cent. B.C. Later pottery was also found (Dodoni © I75-94). Amorgos. E. Andreou has listed a number of antiquities to be seen on the island (Chora, Katapola, Rachidi and Xyloke- ratidi). (ADelt 29 Chr 872-3). Ios. E. Andreou reports the location of a number of ancient sites, including PR, HL and R material at Pounta, at Psathis (PR and HL) and at Manganari and Mylopotamos (HL and R). (ADelt 29 Chr 872). Pholegandros. E. Andreou reports in 1974 a site at Kiparia with LH, G and C pottery. (ADelt 29 Chr 873). Thera: Akrotiri. Very interesting results were reported in 1980 by Ch. Doumas (AS) directing supplementary investi- gation and study of the LBA town on behalf of the Committee appointed to carry on the work of Sp. Marinatos. At the West House work was completed in the ground level rooms 3A, 3B and 3F, where some pottery and stone objects were found. From the ground level of room 6 continued the removal of vases including a pithoid jar with painted decoration of swallows and a bridge spouted jar with an unusual combination of painted grass reed, grape cluster and heads of barley (Fig. IOO). In the space between the West House and the House of Fig. Ioo the Ladies (see e.g. Plan I in Thera VI) the volcanic debris has been removed. The S front of the House of the Ladies has been exposed, and is seen to have suffered severe damage. It is of great interest that five distinct levels of pumice were observed at the S side of the House of the Ladies, each representing a distinct volcanic explosion. Under these was found fallen</page><page sequence="45">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1981-82 47 masonry from the destruction of the house that had taken place before the explosions. Its clearance revealed a piazza between the two houses. Study has been completed of the 'Saffron Gatherers' frescoes (Cover; Fig. IOI), establishing that these frescoes belong to two different compositions. One design embraces the two women 'peplophoroi' and the woman injured on the rocky ground. This painting adorned the N wall of the lustral basin. On the E wall of this room had been a painting of a shrine crowned by horns of consecration. The actual saffron- gatherers had adorned the N and E walls of the room overhead, which should be connected with cult activity. Among very many vases repaired, attention is drawn to a fine pithos decorated with a dappled bull and dolphins (Fig. 102) (Ergon 1980, 40-I). P. M. Warren has published a pre- liminary study of the stone vessels from Sp. Marinatos' excavations at Akrotiri, distinguishing material fabricated in local Theran stone from imported vessels (AE 1979, 82-113). Ch. Doumas and P. M. Warren report surface finds of L Cycladic III type at Monolithos on the E of the island. LH III pottery (including very probable LH IIIC) is evidence for the reoccupation of part at least of the island by the I3th cent. B.C. (AAA XII [I979] 232-6). Therasia. E. Andreou reports study of the site at Riva, at the NE end of the island where foundations of late HL build- ings are preserved and much surface pottery of HL and R types survives. No trace of a M settlement excavated last century in the S of the island now remains. A few prehistoric sherds were found on the surface (ADelt 29 Chr 872). ISLANDS OF THE AEGEAN Thasos. The work of the French School continued on the city site in I98I. In the garden of the French Excavation House a trench revealed part of a building with a deposit of fragments of stamped amphorae and bg pottery of c. 400-350 B.C. A. Jaquermin continued work at the Artemision (Guide de Thasos fig. 4 no. 5; AR 1979-80, 46-7; AR 1980-81, 38) where the extent of the sanctuary was fixed by the discovery that its NE angle was occupied by a house whose earliest phase dates to the 4th cent. B.C. and must precede the peribolos wall found earlier (e.g. AR 1965-66, I8). With modifications, this house existed from the 4th cent. B.C. to the 3rd-4th cent. A.D. Within the peribolos, below the terrace fill, where many terracotta statuettes and protomes were found, traces of buildings were found preceding the terrace. Among finds of note are a fragment of a marble kore (Fig. 103) from the fill Fig. 102 Fig. IOI Fig. 103</page><page sequence="46">48 H. W. CATLING Fig. 104 of the lower terrace and a headless female statue from the make-up of a late wall. A group of I5 Thasian amphorae (6 stamped) were found in a pit in the corner house (Fig. I04), where several Thasian bronze coins were found in the fill of this building's second phase. J. des Courtils continued his examination of the Monument of Thersilochos (Guide de Thasos fig. 4 no. 23 and p. 70; AR 1980-81, 38-9) when the whole of the interior was cleared of its fill and found to have contained no feature of any kind, an important result in attempting to determine the building's function. D. Mulliez, at the request of the Kavalla Ephorate, investi- gated the Divanakis and Vulgaridis plots adjacent to the Tokatlis plot where, in 1964, remains of an ECh building were found (AR 1965-66, I9); the height of the water table prevented investigation of the deeper levels. While additions were made to the plan (now clearly not of a religious building), its full extent remains to be discovered. A. Muller and D. Mulliez continued their investigation in 1981 of the Valma plot (AR 1980-81, 39), chiefly of the ECh building found in the previous two years. SW of the large rectangular room (plan, AR 1980-81 fig. 70) private baths were found. From a room with two apses (? apodyterium) led an opening which must originally have given on to the 'Rue de 1'Acropole', until its S end was closed off by a small plunge- Fig. I05 Fig. Io6 pool, paved and lined with marble. Beyond were two hypo- caustal rooms (Fig. 105). SW of this complex is a yard bounded by a badly built wall, with access to the stoke holes for the hypocaustal rooms and the outflow for the plunge pool. The torso of a male portrait statue was found in the yard's fill of ash and soot (Fig. 106). A. Despoini has reinterpreted reliefs now in Paris from the Passage of the Theoroi. She relates their iconography to the cult of Apollo on Delos, and suggests they may have been set up to mark the entry of Thasos into the Delian League. (ADelt 31 [1976] Mel I66-77). Thasos: City environs. Ch. Koukouli-Chrysanthaki reports a trial excavation at Tsoukolario in 1973 1.5 km. S of the city, near an ancient mole, where a number of Doric column drums had been reported. Five R graves were found, and masses of Thasian wine amphorae, suggesting the presence of a pot factory (ADelt 29 Chr 777). Further excavation in the area was carried out by E. Kourkoutidou-Nikolaidou for the Byzantine Ephorate. From the uppermost level came abundant glazed Byz pottery over a rectangular structure within whose fill was a layer of broken glass vases and panes of glass. The floor of an earlier building was found below with coins prob- ably of Arcadius (A.D. 395-405). The floor evidently extended beyond the limit of the later building; into it had been cut a cist grave containing an inhumation without grave goods. Nearby excavation revealed the remains of a single-aisled apsidal Byz church with roughly paved floor, incorporating much ECh spolia in its construction. Adjacent were found the remains of an earlier much larger apsidal building of uncertain identity and date. (ADelt 29 Chr 831-4). L. Parlarma reports the excavation of part of a cemetery of the 4th cent. B.C. on the road W from the city towards Prinos. Contents of 13 tombs included funerary garlands, jewellery, coins and vases. A marble theke was found containing a bronze hydria. (ADelt 29 Chr 788). Thasos: Theologos. Ch. Koukouli-Chrysanthaki continued in 1973 her investigation of the Kastri settlement (AR 1973-74,</page><page sequence="47">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, I981-82 49 32; AR 1975-76, 28; AR 1977-78, 57) where excavation was taken down to bedrock. Though no structures were found in these lowest levels, the pottery points to relationships with the MN levels of Dikili Tash. Two new trenches were opened to study the latest periods of occupation and test its relationship with the cemeteries nearby. Parts of two buildings have been identified, with a sparsely paved area between. In one was the continuation of a stake-framed house found in 1971, apsidal or elliptical in plan. An internal line of stake holes seems to have divided the apse from the rest of the structure; vases and small objects were found on the floor. A deep ash layer overall suggests a fire destruction. Two occupation phases are repre- sented in these trenches of which the stake-frame house is the earlier, to be equated with Troy VII BI, and regarded as transitional LBA-EIA; it has links with Phase C at Vardaroftsa and with the settlement at Chauchitsa. The later phase, equivalent to Troy VII B2, is of EIA date. These 2 phases were also observed in the neighbouring cemeteries - at Tsiganadika (AR 1977-78, 56) a number of burials were dug in built graves; finds included handmade pottery (often decorated with grooved patterns) and, once, two iron daggers and animal bones. An adjacent tomb contained a mass of pottery and bone, more probably the result of constant reuse than looting. A tomb was dug at Vrysoudhes, E of Kastri; this contained at least five successive burials the latest of which (judging from a fibula found with it) must be 8th-7th cent. B.C. Other tombs were dug at Larnaki (AR 1975-76, 28); more incised pottery was found and an iron knife. (ADelt 29, Chr 778-85). Y. Garlan, for the French School, continued his study of the island's pottery factories. In I980 he worked again at Vamvouri Ammoudhia (AR 1979-80, 47). The heavy facing surrounding the firing chamber of the large kiln is 4.80 m. square in plan associated with a roughly rectilinear network of walls 0.60- 0.70 m. wide. 253 amphora stamps were found. In 1980 he located another kiln site at Kalonero (E side of the island); the 50 stamped handles found on the surface seemed early in the series, just before 300 B.C. In 1981 he undertook a short excavation at this new site. 1726 amphora stamps were re- covered, representing 68 identifiable names, 27 of early type with the makers' names Aristagores, Demalkes and, apparently, Leophontos. 33 others are of later type (29 of the years 340-310 B.C., 4 of c. 270). The series provides important information on the succession of eponyms and attributes (Fig. 107); note Fig. I07 Fig. io8 the use of the pilos and the bow in its quiver. It was also ob- served at the site that some of the stony surface scree was the result of ancient surface mining; with this are to be associated building remains, some R. Finally he reports the discovery at Kalami, i km. E of Koukos (AR 1978-79, 36) of 50 rupestrian inscriptions on the shore recording 'acclamations pederas- tiques' (Fig. 108). Dating from the mid 4th cent. B.C. they include I5 proper names and a dozen epithets, from a simple KcaAo to a sophisticated &amp;oTEporrpoacorroS. Samos. H. Kyrieleis, for the German School, continued his excavation at the Heraion in 1981 (cf AR 1979-80, 47-8; AR 1980-81, 4I). The paving of the Sacred Way was lifted over an extensive area; on the S side the slabs had been removed in antiquity, though the packing below remained; this allowed the chronology of the Roman paving to be checked. A bronze coin of Caracalla dates its laying to the early 3rd cent. A.D. For the first time an extended section of the gravel-surfaced A street came to light, on the same course as its successor but o.60 m. below. No R house remains were found near the street. Some lengthy LR walls should be interpreted as court- yard or boundary walls. On the N side of the street is an extensive, deep rubbish deposit, dated c. A.D. 340 on coin evidence. Of new topographic interest is the identification on the N edge of the excavation of the SE corner of a building foun- dation of the 6th cent. B.C. which can only belong to a temple. It is a sturdy limestone construction 1.20 m. wide. At regular intervals there project from the S facade anta-shaped foun- dations. The length of the facade of at least 20.0 m. means the building is an impressive one, built on a similar orientation to the 'North Building' on the Sacred Way to the SW. The temple stood at least 1.20 m. above the level of the Sacred Way. The difference in height is accounted for by a rectangular terrace 39.5 m. wide, whose S retaining wall diverges from the axis of the temple, but is pretty well parallel to the Sacred Way. This retaining wall consists among other things of re- used column drums of an A temple. The terrace wall was consolidated by the insertion into its coursing of vertical orthostat blocks some of which had been identified in I98I, decorated with large incised designs. In an A level S of the terrace wall a collection of bronzes damaged in antiquity was found, among them a preponder- ance of griffin protomes. An incomplete kouros statuette is notable, as well as the head of an A male statuette (Fig. 109). The underlying prehistoric levels were also further investi- gated, isolating at least three EBA building phases (Fig. IIo).</page><page sequence="48">50 H. W. CATLING Fig. IO9 Fig. Ino The top level includes impressive rectilinear buildings. Slightly deeper lay a fortification wall 2 m. high, including a tower. Parallel with this were the stone foundations of a very large building, the upper part of whose walls will have been of pise. Several fireplaces were found of this phase surfaced with pot- sherds. Two at least had originally been domed ovens. At several points remains of a fire destruction were identified. Walls of a still earlier phase could not be fully investigated as the result of the high water table. The uppermost of these levels is to be equated with Milojcic's 'Heraion I' phase =early Troy II. The large building is equivalent to Troy I. Though the earliest level cannot be closely dated because of the problem of fully excavating it, it must belong to the early 3rd millennium. The prehistoric levels were sealed by flood levels, not built on until the A period. Fig. iii Samos: Kastro tou Lazarou. K. Tsakos describes a fortified site on Mt Lazaros in the centre of the island (Fig. III) that had evidently been hastily built as a refuge at the time of the Arab incursions in the 7th cent. A.D. Finds of undecorated pottery are illustrated and discussed. A number of other sites are described on the N of the island, chiefly EByz, and a list is given of the ECh churches of Samos. (AE 1979, Parart 11-25). Lesbos. Discoveries in ancient Mytilene during 1973-74 have been described in ADelt 29 Chr 855-65. Adjacent to the Metropolis part of a monumental LR public building was excavated: its mosaic floors lie over two earlier stages of floor- ing, the next adjacent of which dates to the 3rd cent. A.D. A semicircular peristyle (diam. c. I2.0 m.) of six columns en- closed an area at the centre of which was a small circular altar (Fig. II2). Among material found out of context is a LC Fig. 112 decree (to be published by B. Petrakos). Elsewhere there was found part of a R building of the 2nd cent. A.D. having a room with mosaic floor; nearby were three portrait heads identified as Agrippina the Elder (Fig. II3a-b) (855). A group of 27 LC tombs was found N of the ancient city; grave goods included decorated and bg pottery, locally made terracottas, weapons and strigils (855-9). The discovery of 9 more tombs (apparently R) in 1981 was reported by the Press (Mesemvrini 1.4.81). B. Petrakos has published a most useful account of the Kastro of Mytilene, together with new detailed plans. He gives a full description of the inner keep and its fine arsenal. Reference is made to the use in the construction of the Kastro of spolia from antique buildings, particularly the theatre.

Doumas reviewed the controversy concerning E Cycladic settlement in N Crete, doubting whether the Arkhanes evi- dence will carry a colonizing explanation. (AAA XII [I979] 104-9). Knossos. P. M. Warren completed a fourth season's excavation in I98i W of the Stratigraphic Museum (AR 1978-79, 36-7; AR 1979-8o, 48-50; AR 1980-81, 73-92). 'In the N area parts of a R building were found in trench B. One room had a series of terracotta disks set in the floor, some beside cement slabs; in an earlier phase the room was decorated with polychrome wall plaster, of which many fragments survived. In this house the most interesting find was a small ivory or bone roundel, one side carved with a female profile bust, the other inscribed AIBIA. 'In the NE area two wells cut down through the LM IB house (see below) were investigated. The pottery from both, kindly examined by Prof. J. N. Coldstream, is LG, c. 725-700 B.C., and includes many restorable vases in coarse and fine wares, including fragments of cremation urns and their white on dark painted lids. The wells appear to be a little later than the 8th cent. pit found in 1978 a little to the W (trench L), with its MG oinochoe. 'Removal of baulk WX in the S part of the site revealed LM IIIC walls and pottery which supplement previous knowledge of the 12th cent. settlement. 'Investigation of a suspected step on the W edge of the Great Circle (LM IIIA) proved successful. A large block was found set against the lower course of the Circle, and another projecting under it, with loose earth beyond and Rfoundations directly above. It looked as if a third block had been removed, and the whole construction formed a stepped approach, o.80 m. wide, up to the circular platform. On the platform cleaning of the R foundation wall revealed that it had cut through a beaten earth floor, of which a patch was preserved. This was the original earth floor of the platform, the earth and slab floor found in I979 lying above it and representing a slightly later usage. These discoveries strengthen the hypothesis that the Circle was a platform for dances and other ceremonies. 'Part of a LM II house was revealed in the NW section of the site (trenches B and F/FG). Small one-handled kylikes had al- ready been found on a paved floor in F/FG in i980; excavation in I98I in the W part of F/FG produced a staircase area and a probable S entrance to the house. To the N (trench B) was a group of small rooms in the construction and for the floors of which gypsum had been much used. These rooms were decorated with painted wall plaster, with red and orange curv- ing bands on a white ground. The W room of those excavated in trench B had several LM II pots on its earth floor, including a stirrup jar, a jug with degenerate lily patterns, a small, plain, one-handled kylix and a tripod cooking pot. Well made mud brick walls indicated a second constructional phase here. Associated with the LM II constructions in trench B were two lentoid seals, showing richly dressed women, one dancing, the other making a seemingly ritual gesture. 'In the S area (trench X) the N edges of large buildings were found. The pottery suggests a LM II date and includes a three- handled stirrup jar with decoration similar to that of a jug from the LM II 'Unexplored Mansion'. From the same context came</page><page sequence="50">52 H. W. CATLING a fragment of a chlorite vase with relief decoration showing rockwork and spirals. In a level a little above was found the upper part of a fine vase with circling foliate bands and other LM IB motifs, very similar to a jug from Palaikastro (Unl- published Objects fig. 35). It is provisionally dated to LM IB, apparently continuing in use during LM II. 'Excavation of the LM IB house in the N part of the site was completed, with interesting additions to the account in AR 198o-81. I) A test below the floor of the Cult Basement Room showed that the floor rested directly on the natural. This part of the house seems to have been built and used only in LM IB. On the SW and E however MM walls were reused or built upon. 2) The remainder of the interior of the small room S of the Room of the Children's Bones was excavated and pro- duced many vases apparently fallen from above. Among the 60 or so pieces found in I98I were a footed incense burner decorated with spirals, a fine jug with plant style design and a speckled pattern jug. 3) Final cleaning of the Room of the Children's Bones yielded more plain vases from the lowest level on the W and, from the doorway on the E, a conical cup and two fragments of bones. These and four others from cleaning here are probably human. 4) Cleaning in the N-S Corridor and excavation of the room S of the Room of the Children's Bones each produced a rectangular limestone block with cut dowel holes on two faces and one end. They are very probably froln the staircase which had been suggested to lie over this area giving access from the S road entrance to the original upper floor. Fig. 1I4 'Excavation of the E half of the North Court yielded a large sherd deposit on the floor, with two incense burners, and fragments of several of the cult vases found in the Cult Base- ment Roolm to the S, further proof that the vessels had origin- ally stood on the upper floor. The sherds also included more pieces of the fine amphora with wavy stripes and marine style pieces showing that what had previously been considered a cup rhyton is apparently the lower part of one such and the upper part of a bridge-spouted jar. With the pottery was a limestone pedestalled lamp and a natural, uncut triton shell. The deposit included a few snails and two human bones, one an eye orbit fragment with a knife cut mark. These bones and snails will also have belonged to the upper floor deposit; the main concentration of snails, together with a few bones, had fallen into the Cult Basement Room with the pithos which contained them. 'All the North Court material lay on the paving of the Court; this included a stone column base, which indicates that the area on the E of the Court was a roofed cloister (Fig. 114). 'E of the North Court and the Cult Basement Room is a room of which the E half was excavated in I979 (AR 1979-8o, 49, room with frescoes). This was completed within trench H in I98I. At the N end further fragments of fresco were found, fallen from the upper floor and much destroyed and colm- minuted in the clayey fill. The m1ain piece, skilfully extracted by P. Petrakis and cleaned over many days by P. Moskhos, comprises a frieze of circular garlands, originally at least 0.75 il. long and at least 0.14 in. high (Fig. II5a). Parts of five garlands are preserved; each has in the centre a pair of papyrus plants or papyrus and lily in comlbination, with an attached bow; the garlands consist of red lilies, palest brown myrtle or olive with red dots for fruit or flowers, split red lilies round a blue and black hoop, blue leaves of dittany or possibly ivy round a blue and black hoop, and red flowers having green centres with black dots, anelnones, ranunculus, poppies or cistus. The garlands are painted on a golden yellow ground. The work is a masterpiece of Minoan ability to combine nature and art. A reconstruction by Mr. J. Clarke illustrates the whole work (Fig. II5b). Cleaning of the pieces found in the room in 1979 reveals a fraglmentary scene with crocuses beside a streall, columlns with festoons and parts of buildings painted in black, white and blue on a red and yellow ground. All these paintings decorated an upper room at the time of the LM IB destruction. 'Beside and below the fresco fragmenlts was a pottery deposit, also fallen. It includes a fragmentary cup or chalice by the painter of the Phaistos grass jug or his workshop, a pedestalled lamp of serpentine and a lentoid seal with a man apparently attacking or sacrificing a large animal. The floor of this room was attractively rendered with a square paved area in lime- stone, surrounded by gypsum slabs. The interstices were filled with white and red plaster. 'From this E room a short passage opened off to the S, onto two small corridors. The N of these was choked with carbonized earth and may have supported a staircase to the upper floor. In the corridor were a few spherical loomweights, part of the upper floor collection of which 79 had fallen into the Cult Basement Roolm ilmmediately to the W. The S corridor had no LM IB destruction finds, but a curious, fragmentary vessel with white decoration on red, perhaps an anthropomorphic vase with applied traces that may be snakes, seems to belong to a pre-LM IB accumulation in this SE corner of the house. 'LM I levels were also reached on the W of the site in trench J and baulk JN. There were parts of two buildings with an E-W passage between, on the same orientation as the main</page><page sequence="51">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, I98I-82 53 Fig. ii5 a and b E-W road to the N. Together with the evidence of a paved road found in 1980 in the SE of the site the picture emerges of deliberate planning in this area of the city in LM I, an area directly linked to the palace by the main E-W road. In the LM I levels associated with these W buildings was a lentoid seal depicting a richly dressed woman and a dog on its hind legs. 'The remainder of the LM IA level in trench U (AR 198o-81) was excavated in 1981 and several more fragmentary fine decorated vases found. The material now includes three Vapheio cups with spirals, a cup painted with crocuses, two plant style bowls and a bowl with tortoiseshell ripple decoration. 'MM was represented in deep soundings, over 6 m. deep, in the S of the site. In trench W well-built walls were found at this depth, on the same alignment as the LM I buildings and roads to the N. Near the preserved tops of the MM walls were parts of two skeletons, one apparently a female aged about 15. A small bowl, MM I-II, was with them. They were not burials, but the cause of death and reason for their position is unknown. In MM levels above fragments of crucibles came to light. Similar MM fragments were found in trench P in 1978 and it is probable that there were MM metal-working areas here. 'The major MM discoveries were in the NW of the site. A plastered floor painted red and the lower steps of a staircase ascending E were found in 1980 (AR 1980-81), with MM II pottery above. The floor was found in 1981 to rest directly on natural and the house to which it belonged was thus built in MM II. Excavation in 1981 S of the red floor revealed more of the house, while the same level reached directly to the N produced parts of rooms which were very probably within the same house. S of the red floor was a basement room whose floor consisted of the bedrock rising steeply to the W. Its walls were covered with fine plaster, painted in greyish blue. Within the room was a substantial pottery deposit of c. 60 vases, mostly undecorated but ranging from large jars to tiny miniatures; there are bridge-spouted jars, a cylindrical pyxis (Fig. 16), an imitation of a stone bowl, carinated cups and a metal-imitating chalice cup. With the pottery were the horn cores of a goat (agrimi?), large amounts of animal bone (apparently joints of meat), and small bird and fish bones. 'To the S of this room was a second staircase, with seven steps preserved ascending W. Both staircase and walls were carefully plastered and painted greyish blue. The top of the stair was cut off by the LM II house (described above) built over the MM II remains. At its lower end it gives onto a white plastered floor which had been reused and partly built over by the LM IB room S of the Room of the Children's Bones. The MM II rooms to the N produced about I5 more vases, while one room has a white plastered floor with red borders rising a little up the white plastered walls, a style to be repeated in the LM IB house about 200 years later.' Archanes: Turkogeitonia. During 1980 I. and E. Sakellarakis continued their investigation of the palatial build- ings first located in 1965, where a stratigraphic test had been made in I979 (AR 1979-8o, 50). More walls and a stone water conduit were found, belonging to the main complex. One room contained a stone base for a double axe. One area produced a rich series of LM IB pottery (Fig. II7). The site was particu- larly rich in loom weights. Among many small objects Fig. II6 Fig. 117</page><page sequence="52">54 H. W.

The same excavators returned to the great M cemetery (AR 1977-78, 6I-3 and refs; AR 1978-79, 37-8; AR 1979-80, 50; AR 1980-81, 42), excavating rooms 2 and 3 of the mortuary building I6; room 2 contained six sarcophagi and a total of I8 burials. Among finds were four seals. 23 burials were found in room 3, the majority in 4 pithoi and 3 sarcophagi; finds included 3 seals and 3 amulets. More work was done SW of Tomb F, in the area where Cycladic figures and many obsidian blades had been discovered. The head and neck of a very large marble Cycladic figure was found and more obsidian. In supplementary work on Tomb F two complete Cycladic figures were found. (Ergon I980, 48-9). Juktas. The work of the AS at the peak sanctuary, first studied by Sir Arthur Evans, continued in I980 under A. Karetsou (AR 1977-78, 63 and refs; AR 1978-79, 38; AR 1979-8o, 50; AR 1980-81, 42-3). The N extension of the range of sanctuary buildings was defined. As well as architectural members finds included numerous terracotta statuettes of humans and animals, a votive terracotta hammer, a table of offerings, scraps of gold leaf and many conical cups. The fill contained pottery of the early neopalatial period. Further E a new terrace was found, on whose S side was part of the old palace period sanctuary dump. A fine bronze statuette of a male votary was recovered (Fig. 119) as well as a much earlier stone kernos, reminiscent of finds in the Mesara. Tests showed that almost certainly the N, open air, part of the shrine had been arranged on a series of terraces. The N (surely the main) entrance in the cyclopean wall which surrounds the shrine and the 'High Peak' of Juktas was cleaned. Unfortunately no evidence was found to date what must be a fortification wall unique for Crete. (Ergon 1980, 46-8). Ayia Pelagia. St. Alexiou has further discussed the HL building excavated by him and identified as an andreion- prytaneion. (ADelt 29, Chr 883-5). He continued his excavation in 1974, exploring further the LM III levels underlying the andreion-prytaneion; part of a MM III building was identified. (ADelt 29 Chr 899-900). Kastro Kephala Almyrou (S of Ay. Pelagia). St. Alexiou reports the study in 1974 of the fortified acropolis associated with LM IIIA2, IIIB and, possibly, IIIC pottery, perhaps to be associated with internecine struggles between the Achaean settlers or as a protection against an anticipated Dorian attack. (ADelt 29 Chr 900-I). Mallia. The French School's investigations were continued in 1981 at several points. O. Pelon re-examined the area where, in 1936, the two famous 'epees d'apparat' were found and, in 1946, a number of vases of Chamaizi type below the Neo- palatial rooms III I and III 2 (NW area) where a large room with stuccoed floor was discovered, its full extent not yet ascertained; it must measure c. 7.20 x 7.35 m. Its plan is un- usual, containing a series of low platforms, drains and large collecting pots countersunk in the floor (Fig. I20). Some fill untouched by the earlier excavations confirms that the two deposits excavated in 1936 and 1946 were contemporary and that they are datable to the period of the first palaces, i.e. to MM II, and that this is the context in which the swords were found. Fig. I20 J. C. Poursat continued his excavation of the workshop partly investigated in 1980 (AR 1980-81, 44). On the E side a second building was found, one of whose rooms was a semi- basement. From the same building came moulds for casting bronze objects including a fragmentary double axe mould and a multiple mould for chisels (Fig. I2I). J. P. Olivier re-examined some of the Rooms in House Aa originally excavated in 1931 (cf. Et. Cret. IX [i953] 43-7). A beaten earth re-occupation floor was certainly identified in one room and probably in a second overlying an original plastered floor. Both floors are associated with coarse pottery of MM III/LM I type. A silver ring with intaglio of three women was found in the fill between the two floors. Soundings revealed that a predecessor underlay this building; pottery does not suggest a significant difference in date. C. Baurain and P. Darcque explored an area adjacent to the</page><page sequence="53">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, I981-82 55 Fig. 122 Fig. 12I NE corner of the Palace to solve topographic questions. Remains of walls may have belonged to entrance systems to the palace at this point; further a deep fill was found covering MM III structures, below which were MM II buildings with rich deposits of finds. Of exceptional interest is an almost complete LM IB triton shell of chlorite, the whole of whose surface is decorated in relief, including a libation scene in which the participants are two Ta-Urt demons. The discovery in 1978 of a submerged building at Paralia tou Mylou, not far from Maison Theta is reported by A. Guest-Papamanoli. The rectangular structure is up to 37 m. E-W, 25 m. N-S and divided into parallel compartments 3.0 m. wide. There is no evidence of date, but it recalls other drowned buildings at the LM settlement of Ayii Theodoroi, near Nirou Chani, supposed by S. Marinatos to be harbour installations. (AAA XIII [I980] 99-IOI). Smarion Pediadas. D. Hadji Valianou has published an account of the ancient topography of the vicinity of this village 5 km. NW of Kastelli Pediadas. Occupation seems to have been continuous since MM III. At Leivaditsa, a hilltop W of Smarion, a cemetery has been identified, including a small tholos. On the evidence of pottery found in the disturbed fills, and of typology, the tomb should be dated before the end of LM IIIB. At Spitakia S of the village a settlement with M and post-M occupation was identified. At Lenika 500 m. E of the village are traces of a C and HL settlement. Signs ofLM III and post-M cemeteries were noted at several points S of the village. The chief site is Troulli tis Korphis, I700 m. E of Smarion, on the summit of a hill commanding the whole region; a complex of walls has been cleared here, possibly to be identified as a peak sanctuary with a building of megaron plan at its centre, possibly to be regarded as one of the earliest post-M sanctuaries, perhaps contemporary with the megara 137 and 138 at Karphi, earlier than the temples of Prinias. (AAA XIII [I980] 20-60). Lyttos. A. Lembessis reports the discovery in 1973 at Koukades of a HL tomb containing a clay sarcophagus with gabled lid (Fig. 122). In one of the narrow ends was a spherical projection, giving the coffin a slightly anthropomorphic appearance; the skull lay in this projection (there is a parallel from Gordion). The sarcophagus contained a rf pelike of c. 330-320 B.C. and a spouted jug decorated in the manner of the Hadra hydriae. (ADelt 39 Chr 886-7). Odigitria. The Press reported discovery of an EM and MM complex of built tombs with rich contents, including 52 seals of ivory, steatite and faience; several are theriomorphs. Also found were 25 amulets, one in the form of a turtle/tortoise, four gold bands and eight necklaces, 30 small bronze tools, daggers and ornaments, many obsidian blades, over Ioo EM and MM clay vases and c. 25 stone vases. (Apoyevmatini 1.4.81). Kommos. The excavations of the American School continued in 1981 under the direction of J. Shaw (Toronto), who writes: 'During past years, excavation has concentrated on the N hilltop, the hillside to the S and, further S, the area where hill- side and beach meet. In the first two areas we have uncovered substantial remains of MM II-LM IIIB houses. In the lower area, a series of monumental LM buildings has appeared, above which were built a series of temples and related structures dating from EPG through ER times. 'Little work was done in 1981 on the hilltop, the houses of which are slowly being prepared for publication. On the hill- side, however, a series of trenches allowed us to explore more MM houses, built during a prosperous period and at least partially destroyed, then deserted, after an earthquake in MM III. In the E part of this area, the layout of entire houses con- tinues to be obscured by later MM reuse, as well as by the upper LM structures which cannot be undermined. Stratigraphically, however, there are some advantages to the situation, for example one area produced a splendid ceramic series, including stratified examples of early and late Kamares polychrome eggshell ware (MM IIA and IIB). Nearby a burnt area pro- duced a fine series of objects, including a rare abrader of emery. Not far from this room was another lined with slabs, in the corner of which was a stone platform, on which had been set a spouted stone basin which could have been used in the process- ing of oil and/or wine. The two rooms mentioned are separated by an LM stairway with nine well-worn steps. 'The SW part of the hillside was particularly productive, for the lack of overlying structures made it possible to open up a number of MM III rooms belonging to a single large house already partially explored in previous seasons. We were able to retrieve many complete vessels often found upside down on the floors (for hygienic reasons?). One storeroom, partially excavated in I979, produced over 6I vessels broken but other-</page><page sequence="54">56 H. W. CATLING Fig. 124 Fig. 125 wise entire, representing an unusally complete collection of storage vessels, including 5 rhyta (Fig. 123), from the MM III (post-Kamares) phase. Above one of the rooms was found a fine bronze double-axe. 'In the third, S area, where the C-HL Sanctuary level was essentially completed in 1980, we excavated three large trenches and one small one around the latest temple (Temple C) with the twin aims of locating Iron Age structures built around the lower, earlier temples (A and B) and, below that, of further defining the character of the monumental LM buildings which had appeared earlier W and S of the temples. The only IA structure was on the E of Temples A and B: set within and above multiple burnt court surfaces was a large altar, c. 1.52 x 2.30 m., about 5 m. from the facades of Temples A and B and probably corresponding to a late phase of Temple B (8th cent.). Within the altar were thousands of fragments of burnt bone, now being studied in relation to similar deposits from other phases of the temples, all part of the rituals of sacrifice and dining which characterize the temple series. 'N of the altar, with blocks of its S wall set on top of a large Minoan wall is another IA building, only part of which could be explored. Upon its latest floor was much pottery, including complete vessels and sherds of imported Eastern wares, corresponding to an early phase of Temple B (c. 825-750 B.C.). This is now the only unexcavated IA structure near the temples. 'The M levels below the sanctuary continue to surprise because of the monumental scale of the architecture, even though the small finds are disappointing. Along the shore, inland from Building J with its pier-and-door partition and broad doorway to the N, we excavated a large trench that exposed a very thick and high (1.80 m.) ashlar wall composed of krepidoma, rectangular orthostat-like blocks set upon it and other blocks set upon them in turn, all apparently contempo- rary. This is the first known occurrence in which a M orthostat course is surmounted by ashlar masonry rather than mud brick or rubble construction. N of Building J and this monu- mental facade is a wide (2.85 m.) E-W road paved with worn limestone slabs, bordered along its N edge by a retaining wall and drain, a minor branch of the road passing through the wall and continuing up the hill to the LM and MM houses already discussed. The E-W road, however, continues to the E, and there is evidence to show that it (and the orthostat wall) continued below the later temples to emerge on the other side. For instance, on the S line of the road, E of the Greek temples, we have discovered an immense Minoan wall. With its ashlar face on the N, this is the N wall of a large LM I building, only partially excavated, which extends eastward. 'S of the road and on the same E-W line, therefore, are Building J, the orthostat facade, and the building just men- tioned, the three possibly forming a unit. On the N they faced the road, on the S a large court paved with pebbles. It is clear that shortly after or even during LM I the form of the court changed as large buildings were constructed on it. 'The E-W road is most significant, and is like the road search- ed for in this area during 1924 by Sir Arthur Evans. The road found now, terminating at the Libyan Sea, was not only a major avenue for Kommos town but most likely represents the chief entry by sea into south central Crete. Conversely, it was probably the exit from the Mesara by sea, at least during LM I-III. Ships involved in such trade could have been pulled up on shore or anchored behind the small island which at that time projected at least 5 m. from the sea. The road, therefore, contributes to our understanding of the region as a whole; it was the chief link between the sea, Phaistos and thence Knossos.' Hagia Triadha. In a short season in 1981 for the Italian School V. La Rosa completed the trial begun in 1980 (AR 1980-81, 44). The results confirm that the megaron must be the first post-palatial building to have been constructed at Hagia Triadha. Tests in Room 58 revealed that the Villa is built immediately on pre-palatial levels, containing Ayios Onouphrios ware. Kalochoraphitis Mesaras. A. Lembessis reports the ex- cavation in 1973 of a LM IIIB chamber tomb I km. from the village on the road to Tymbaki. At least five clay larnakes were in the chamber, and 80 pottery vases, ten animal terracottas, a bucranium and a duck-shaped vase. There were also bronzes, and two stone vases, a stone crescentine amulet, beads and seals. Some human remains had been removed from the larnakes and interred in two pits to make room for extra burials. One larnax is richly decorated - included are a chariot, a ship, a stag, birds, a bull hunt, a bucranium, palm trees and wild goats. (ADelt 29 Chr 885-6). Gortyn. N. Allegro, for the Italian School, investigated the HL wall whose remains are to be traced for over I km. from the bluff opposite the Ay. Ioannis hill to the locality Pervo- lopetra. Work concentrated on the W part of the wall at Pervolopetra to the point where it links up with the N-S Fig. 123</page><page sequence="55">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, I981-82 57 fortification wall. Two rectangular towers break the line near Pervolopetra, and a gate was identified through which the path passed leading from one part of the circuit to another. A. Karetsou has reported the excavation in 1973, at the Mesara Agricultural Research station, of part of the HL-R cemetery of Gortyn, including a HL mortuary complex, consisting of a large rectangular building, connected left and right with semicircular ancillary structures. Finds include two hemispherical silver vessels with stylised floral ornament in relief (Fig. I24). Fittings from a (gilded?) silver necklace include a herm, a dolphin, palm, wheel, Herakles' club, human figures. Beyond the mortuary building another ten tombs were found (built cists, thekes and tile graves), LHL and ER. One large vault was constructed of good reused archi- tectural material. Grave offerings included terracotta statuettes, bronze coins, glass beads and vessels; a jasper ringstone is carved with a portrait of Livia (Fig. I25). An elaborate once vaulted mausoleum was found nearby containing a sarco- phagus; with the burial was an electrum ring. Below the floor were eight built graves; finds included pottery, mould-made lamps of Ist and 2nd cent. A.D. types. (ADelt 29 Chr 889-94). EAST CRETE Kyra Siteias. K. Davaras reports the excavation in I974 of a group of small built tombs, consisting partly of square chambers and tholos-type roofs, partly of similar structures built around a pithos containing the dead. The graves date to LM and PG; one was unlooted; it contained 4 skulls, 25 vases and three fibulae and a pin. (ADelt 29 Chr 931-2). Siteia. N. Papadakis describes the discovery in Papanastasiou St in 1977 of a very large deposit of 7th cent. B.C. terracotta votives (Fig. 126), evidently a sanctuary dump belonging to an important G and O shrine. The floruit of the shrine should be Fig. I26 soon after 650 B.C., for most of the material is mid-Daedalic. The character of the votives suggests the shrine was dedicated to a fertility goddess. (AAA XIII [I980] 61-7). Itanos. K. Davaras reports the identification of several rural settlement sites, mostly M, between Vai and Toplou monastery. (ADelt 29 Chr 93 3-4). Kato Zakro. N. Platon (AS) undertook his eighteenth season at the M palace and town during 1980; many parts of the site were investigated, and further very large amounts of material have been recovered. Among points tested were the following: (I) The SE wall of the Palace enclosure was followed along its S course. At the far end was a circular structure, probably a well. Its S part had been roughly rebuilt after the destruction. Among material found nearby are Canaanite jars; most finds date to MM IIIB-LM I. (2) In the Palace's W Court the W course of the buttress wall of the first terrace was examined together with a complex of associated structures. Pottery, etc., from the associated fills is MM IIIB- LM IA. (3) In the furthest house on the N side of the Road to the Harbour floors above its middle terrace were cleared; LM IA material was found. (4) Similar investigation was made of the furthest house S of the Road to the Harbour. Some rooms were floored with stone slabs, others with clay. Finds included quantities of pottery, a bronze knife and a silver pin. Pottery from below the floors dates to LM IA; the building was reoccupied in LM IB. (5) A few more metres of the paved Road to the Harbour have been cleared. (6) More work has been done in Hogarth's house B, especially in rooms XIX and XX. Room XIX had two floors; there was abundant pottery of many forms in the upper while the lower preserved MM IIIB-LM IA material. Other rooms also produced rich depsoits of pottery, etc. In House A began the work of uncovering the extension of the House of the Sealings, revealing much architectural detail. House D, E of House B, has also been investigated, and consists of over ten rooms, with LM IB adaptations of LM IA designs. Quantities of pottery were found. Tests below floors yielded early palatial material. The E limit of the house has yet to be located; it has a LM IA destruction horizon. (Ergon 1980, 4I-5). Epano Zakro. A. Karetsou investigated further the LM I farmhouse/villa previously excavated by N. Platon and by I. Sakellarakis (AR 1965-66, 23). Vasiliki. The reinvestigation of the M settlement (originally excavated by R. B. Seager) continued in 1980 under the direc- tion of A. Zoes (AS) at four points. (i) In the SW, where rooms previously excavated by Seager were uncovered and consoli- dated. These date to the latter phase of EM IIB. In the same area the MM IA house X was excavated. A large deposit of EM IIB and later loom weights was found. (2) In the same area examination continued of the 'strong' building O, still undated (3) In the neighbouring Area P stratigraphic evidence indicates important EM IIB buildings; much Vasiliki ware was found, and a little light-on-dark style. (4) On the E of the site work concentrated on a complex of EM, MM and LM remains. The W part of the area produced EM remains. Some of the stratigraphy is here linked with the MM IA house F; from a foundation level associated with this building came two cups, one of typical EM III light-on-dark type, the other MM IA with decoration in white. The close association of these two vases is significant for solving the problems of the origin of the light-on-dark style. (Ergon 1980, 45-6).</page><page sequence="56">58 H. W.

Finds include decorated pottery of LM IIIAI-IIIB2 types (Fig. I27a,b), bronze weapons and implements, ornaments and sealstones. (ADelt 29 Chr 917-21). remains of a horse were found in one tomb. Other finds included pottery, bronze weapons and beads. (Nea 30.6.8I). Phylaki Apokoronou. The Greek Press reported the discovery in 1981 of a partly looted LM IIIA tholos tomb with almost square chamber (3.40 X 3.65 m)., recalling the form of the Malame tholos. It is approached by a narrow dromos I I. m. long, with wedge-shaped section; the construction is of well cut square blocks. At least nine burials were found, in poor condition, with traces of burning. Most important among the finds are the ivory embellishments of a wooden box, including heads of warriors wearing boar's tusk helmets (Fig. I28), plaques with sphinxes and wild goats, and figure- of-eight shields of different sizes. Other ivories include the head of a pin with the representation of two seated human figures, frontal, embracing, and two small human statuettes. Gold finds include a necklace of rosettes and a (pTl'KTrlpac for the hair. Many beads of clay and stone were found, and two stone rings whose bezels have intaglios, also bronze and silver rings and I5 sealstones. Amulets of semi-precious stone (rock crystal, amethyst, sard and sardonyx) were carved with animal protomes or complete animals. The bronzes (including weapons and vessels) were in poor condition and are in process of conservation. The tomb contained little pottery; a tinned kylix is reported. (Ethnos 4.11.81). Almyrida Apokoronou. E. Bourboudakis reports the part excavation in 1973 of a three-aisled ECh basilica on the S flank of Phoinicia. The setting for the altar and the the ambo were found in situ (Fig. 129). The floors of the bema and the main aisle were covered with mosaics. (ADelt 29 Chr 94I-3). Fig. I27a and b Fig. 129 Fig. 128 Apodoulou Rethymnis. The Greek Press reported the discovery of built tholos tombs in the LM cemetery. The Akrotiri Kydonias. A. Guest-Papamanoli and A. Lambraki have published the material from the caves of Lera, on the NW side of Akrotiri, and of Arkoudia, on the NE. The Lera cave was occupied through N and EM; relatively little MM was found but a significant amount of LM III. The cave was also resorted to in historic times, particularly from the 5th cent. B.C., when it was the scene of a cult of Pan and the Nymphs (numerous graffiti). The evidence of use in the Arkoudia cave was much less abundant; N material was not found, and the M sequence was intermittent only. An un- identified cult was observed here in historic times.

Papapostolou have reported on chance discoveries and emergency excavations during 1973-74 in ADelt 29 Chr 917, 921-9. An account of the discovery of the linear A archive in 1973 (AR 1973-74, 40) shows it was not in situ on the floor as found; it may have fallen from an upper floor, or was washed down from a building higher up immediately N (926-7). A description is given of the 1973 joint Greek-Swedish excavation at Kastelli within the LM town (AR 1980-81, 47) when levels dating both before and after the LM IB destruction were investigated. In both cases much pottery was recovered. MM levels exist below the LM IB building (917). Ergon 1980, 49-50 reports the continuation of excavation at Kastelli under Y. Tzedakis (AS), particularly at the Mathoudaki plot where a new trench (no. 7) was opened in which LM IIIB buildings were found, associable with those found earlier in trench 5. The buildings had been destroyed in a fire; a number of vases were found, including stirrup jars. Additionally Room A and its plaster floor was completely cleared. It was built in MM III and had a very long life, involving a number of alterations. 60 m. W of the Mathoudaki plot MM III-LM I buildings were found. MM III and LM I pottery was found in 1973 on Odos Daskaloyianni, on the E edge of Kastelli (927-8). On Odos Sphakion a LM IIIA2-IIIB chamber tomb was found in 1973, containing painted vases, a bronze 'one piece' spearhead and a bronze knife (926). At Ay. Ioannis a chamber tomb was found in 1974 containing ten LM IIIA2-IIIB vases (928-9). Two built tombs were dug in 1973 on the S of the modern town, probably 5th cent. B.C. Each tomb contained two compartments; in one of the tombs each compartment contained a sarcophagus in which were two skeletons. Finds included pottery and a bronze strigil (92I-5). In 1981, development work led to the discovery of a R building (2nd cent. A.D.) with plastered walls in good con- dition. (Mesemvryni I4.3.8I). Vryses Kydonias. The Greek Press reports excavation in 1981 by the University of Ioannina at a C-HL settlement on the W slope of the hill of Ay. Yeoryios AG level was also found. (Vima 22.9.81). Nea Roumata Kydonias (20 km. SW of Chania). The Press reports the discovery by Y. Tzedakis in 1981 of a small built EM tomb. The floor was slabbed, the upper part of the roof composed of a single stone. It contained a single crouched burial accompanied by two vases, dating to the N-EM tran- sition; it recalls a grave at Krasi and tombs in the EM cemetery at Ay. Phota in E Crete, but has strong Cycladic links. The contemporary settlement was identified nearby. (Ethnos 6.Io.8I). DODECANESE Rhodes. Chr. Doumas has reported in ADelt 29 Chr 946-8I the results of emergency excavation during 1973-74 in the ancient city and its environs. For the account that follows J. Kondis, 'Zum antiken Stadtbauplan von Rhodos' in AM lxxiii (1958) 146-58, should be consulted, particularly for the reference numbers to the ancient street grid; also G. Konstantinopoulos in AAA III (1970) 55. For the cemeteries, P. M. Fraser, Rhodian Funerary Monuments (Oxford 1977), I-8 and plan facing p.I. Parts of the city fortifications were identified at several points (for the modern street names, see the plan G. Konstantinopoulos, Rhodes [3rd edn, 1971] p. I3). At the junction of Lindou and Gregoriou V, the wall was found 3.5 m. wide, still 2.0 m. high (959). The proteichisma was found on Garibaldi, 2.90 m. wide. Important for the date of the pro- teichisma was an HL inscribed gravestone in secondary use in the structure. Part of the city wall itself was found nearby, and a ?tower (968-70). Elsewhere the size of the proteichisma varied. On Parodos Pan Rodiou the proteichisma of the Myrialli tower (ADelt 23 [I968] Chr 446) was found, 2.80-3.00 m. wide (959). On Garibaldi an inspection pit was found for a large sewer which must have passed through the city wall not far off (974). On Meg. Konstantinou a large open built and partly paved water channel 5.0 m. wide was found extending S beyond the wall in the direction of the supposed city ditch, with a possible bridge (948-50). On Konst. Palaiologou part of the city wall was found, 2.90 m. wide, and, associated with it, part of P40, the cir- cumferential road, with P39a at right angles to it; groups of buildings with remains of their drains were found in both angles. In one building 16 small rooms were preserved and what appears to have been the aithrion of the house (968). Many elements of the ancient grid were identified, frequently associated with a succession of surfaces which often concealed lines of pipes either following the course of the streets or lead- ing to/from the houses, traces of which were in many cases located beside the streets. The account starts at the N of the ancient city, and moves clockwise. On the N of the city PIa was found in Othonos and Amalias (954). Nearby was part of P29a, with eight successive road surfaces. Beneath was a small drainage channel, near which a square well-head was found. On the other side of the channel was a line of plain pottery amphorae set upright within the road surfaces. Nearby, again, was part of a massive wall 2.70 m. wide resembling the city wall; such a location would however be difficult to explain (950-I). The junction of P3 and P29b was found on Vas. Sophias and Soph. Venezelou, while house remains were located at the junction of P39 and P2d; in one of three wells associated with the house were HL pottery and coins (970-2). P39 was found again on Ethelonton Dodecannesion together with part of a house fronting it (970). On the E side, on Bevin and Canada were parts of PI7 and P35, the former with five successive surfaces and three water lines; on either side were remains of buildings (948). In the SE sector, on Princess Alexia, P32y and its junction with the previously unknown P23b were found, both 5.30 m. wide. Both roads had drains along their central axis; water channels discharged from neighbouring buildings into these drains (955-7). P32a, with traces of a private house on its W side, was found on Parodos Ayias Anastasias (972), while P35 (four surfaces) was found on Yalouri and Ay. Nikolaou (973). P40 (the circumferential street) appeared on Australias (974). From the S sector, part of P32 was located on Ay. Anastasias, with traces of adjacent buildings while PI8b came to light in Antismenarchon Volonaki (973). In Ay. Lauras a section of P29b was found, with seven successive levels and built water lines and wells (948). In the SW sector part of P27b was found on Pindou; from fill in the plot came an inscribed statue base belonging to a priest of Aphrodite (946). On Ypsilandi and Nikitai part of P20 was found, and again on Ekpaideftikou, where there were 3-4 superimposed surfaces (973). P20 was found again in KonstL Palaiologou 8.40 m. wide, with four surfaces. Four piped water lines were found em- bedded in the make-up (970). The W part of the city was represented in a plot on Kennedy and Diagoridon by part of P26b and building remains on either side. The street was 4.50-4.70 m. wide, with a central drain fed by water channels from adjacent houses. 12 different water pipes were found within the make-up of the street. Two ovens/furnaces were found within the building complex (957). From nearer the</page><page sequence="58">60 H. W. CATLING Centre of the city, part of P38 was identified on Cheimarras with built drains running down its centre and structures facing it to the E in whose fills HL and R pottery was collected (946). Part of P28a came to light on Antismenarchon Volonaki, with 13 different piped water lines in its makeup (954). The junction of P8 and P28 was located at Plateia Navarino (974-75). In a plot on Navarino excavation located parts of P38 and Pio. The latter was 10.0 m. wide, and had eight surfaces; pipe lines were found in two of the surfaces. Nearby a quarried channel for a water pipe was found. Part of P28 was found, with four sur- faces. The parallel streets P28 and P38 were 46.80 m. apart. In the area bounded by P28, P38 and Pio were found several built subterranean chambers and wells. One well-preserved vaulted and windowed chamber was 9.44x3.34 m. Finds from the plot included the upper part of a statuette of a Muse resting her head on her right hand, ofthe type ofthe Melpomene of the Rhodian sculptor Phyliskos (Fig. 130) (95 -4). Fig. 130 Investigations were made at a number of public and other buildings. E. Zervoudaki reports study of the stadium in I973 in collaboration with Fr. Krinzinger (Innsbruck). This shows that in setting out the race course the unit of measurement was a foot of 33.726 cms (i.e. the 'architectural' foot, not the 'athletic' foot). Three building phases are identified: the first should belong to the original design of the city, the second c. Ioo B.C. and the third R imperial. The starting mechanism and finishing line were examined without certainly establishing how they functioned, but cf. the older stadium at Isthmia (965). A building complex was found on Odos P. Mela, the earliest element in which had been an imposing ?public structure (948). On Th. Sophouli and Cheimnarras a building was examined with mosaic floor down one side of which is inscribed AYEITI- BEPIANAIT (955). On Pindou house remains associated with geometric mosaic floors were identified (970). On Io. Kazouli a series of rectangular structures was found associated with many animal bones, very large numbers of miniature vases, lamps, terracotta statuettes, bronze coins, etc., all belonging to the ancillary areas of a sanctuary which dates from at least the 4th cent. B.C. A bronze object with an inscription to Demeter identifies the deity. Earlier finds in the neighbourhood point to the existence of a more extensive sacred area (966-8). Finds are reported from the ancient cemeteries, particularly on Sophouli where two built rectangular tombs were located. One tomb was pillaged, the second contained a theke inscribed with the name of the deceased. Gifts included glass vessels (972). Four rock-cut tombs were found at another point, one pillaged. Two contained a single skeleton, the last tomb two. One of the single burials also contained a theke with cremation and a hydria similarly used as a cremation urn. The double grave contained two thekes with cremated remains. (977-9) Another plot on Sophouli yielded 80 tombs. Finds included inscribed altars and thekes, a terracotta ash urn with an inscription in ink, and an Attic rfbell krater (Fig. 131) (975-7). On the extension of Odos Sophouli an ancient quarry was found and a remark- able curved rock-cut passage 1.5o m. wide associated with which was cut a channel containing a lead water pipe leading to a cistern. From the fills came a number of inscribed grave- stones (977). Fig. 131 AtJenio a group of tombs was dug, of which I6 were graves (some used repeatedly), I were ash urns and there was a single hydria used as a cremation urn. (959) A number of interesting finds were made in the city. From a plot on Amerikis came an ostrakon with a text of I3-I4 lines of ink-written Greek described as a letter (Fig. I32). This, found in a rescue excavation of the I96os (ADelt 19 [I964] Chr 462), is now in the Rhodes Museum (966) Marble sculpture - seated male figure (Fig. 133), standing youth in chlamys - was found in the fill of a cistern on Kennedy (972-3). A series of stone ballista balls each with an indication of weight upon them - M, K, A, AF, AA, O, H, NB, 5 - was found on Sophouli and Diagoridon (974).</page><page sequence="59">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, I981-82 6i Fig. 132 Fig. 133 The Greek Press reports the conservation and relaying of four fine 4th cent. B.C. pebble mosaics recovered from the ancient city. Among the subjects portrayed is a centaur, and Bellerephon and the Chimaera. The floors are considered next in quality only to those of Pella. (Nea 26.6.8I). Trianda. The Greek Press referred in 1982 to continuing excavation at the M and Myc settlement first excavated by the Italians before the war. Tephra was found whose analysis has suggested it should be related to the destruction of Thera. (Kathemerini). Agia Trias. The Greek Press reported the discovery of a rock-cut family tomb in which the vaulted roof was apparently supported by caryatids cut in the living rock, as were the three funerary couches adjacent to them. (Nea 26.8.81). Sorone. E. Kollias reports the discovery of an ECh cemetery at Dipotamos, dug into an earlier settlement. (ADelt 29 Chr 982-3). Aphantou. Chr. Doumas and E. Kollias report respectively the discovery in 1973 of a HL Cemetery at the Golf Course, and in 1974 of two HL tombs on the N edge of Rhodes air- port. (ADelt 29 Chr 961, 984). Kallithea. Chr. Doumas has described a number of grave- stones, many inscribed, found in the ancient cemetery at Karakonerou. (ADelt 29 Chr 962-4). Archangelos. A. Sampson has given a preliminary account of his investigation from 1978 in an occupied cave at Koumedo in the village lands of Archangelos (AR 1980-81, 48). The upper levels included LH and HL pottery mixed with earlier material; below was a succession of floor deposits associated solely with 'prehistoric' material. The N pottery is under study, together with surface collections made elsewhere in Rhodes and at other sites recently identified by Sampson on Nisyros, Kos, Karpathos and Alimnia. Fabrics include a red slipped ware, a white painted ware (on red or black ground), black burnished and pattern burnished. Connections are seen with pottery from Tigani, Samos and Ayia Gala, Chios. Some other material is tentatively identified as EBA. Some of the LBA pottery from the upper levels recalls the Minoan-type pottery from Agia Trianda. (AAA XII [I979] 24-39). Massari. Chr. Doumas reports the discovery in 1973 of three graves in a C cemetery in rectangular pits. (ADelt 29 Chr 96I). Lindos. In 1982 the Greek Press reported the discovery of an EA fortification wall over 2.00 In. wide near the theatre. In the same area walls were found with G-HL pottery. (Vradyni 12.2.82). Kos. I. Papachristodoulou and Ch. Kantzia have reported briefly on exploratory investigations in an extensive area S of Gregory V St, SW of the Odeon (see C. and C. Mee, Kos [I979] I9). This revealed considerable traces of the city wall, extensively robbed in R times; c. 22 m. further W a 57.50 m. stretch of retaining wall was found up to 2.50 m. high, in excellent masonry, connected in some way with the city wall. SW of these walls was found an ECh mosaic floor and nearby 30 R cist graves. Within the limit of the city wall a R mosaic floor, house remains and a water conduit came to light. (AAA XIII [I980] 102-5). In 1974 further excavation was undertaken at the site of the 'Terme del Poctos' previously excavated by the Italians (Boll. d'Arte I950, 219-20); a room with mosaic floor was un- covered. (ADelt 29 Chr 979). Chr. Doumas reports the discovery of a R villa in 1973 at the 'Dimitra Beach' hotel complex; sited on sloping ground the house was built on a series of terraces. Two of the rooms were found to have floors of terracotta slabs. (ADelt 29 Chr 961-2).</page><page sequence="60">62 H. W. CATLING In ADelt 29 Chr 964-5, 980--1, Chr. Doumas has reported a variety of discoveries of 1973-74 in the smaller islands: Symi. A prehistoric settlement is identified (traces of walls; obsidian) at Varoucha (964). Patmos. At Aspri Bay a prehistoric site was found (millstone, obsidian) (964). Kalymnos. Part of a substantial R building - ? bath - was found at Ay. Antonios Panormou (980-1). Astypalaea. E Cycladic (Keros-Syros) pottery was found at a known site at the entrance to the Vathy gulf. There is much obsidian on the N shore of the gulf(98I). Telos. A. Sampson has reported discovery of a site close S of Megalo Chorio associated with large quantities of pottery of M type, suggesting yet another Dodecanesian M 'colony', perhaps MM III-LM I. (AAA XIII 1I9801 68-73). Karpathos, Saros and Kasos. In Karpathiakai Meletai 2 (1981) 99-161, and by personal communication M. Melas has further described the results of fieldwork in search of pre- historic sites (AR 198o-81, 48) in the group of islands. He reports 16 sites (ten on Karpathos, one on Saros, five on Kasos) where LN and EBA pottery have been found. Another 25 (20 on Karpathos, two on Saros, three on Kasos) have produced only lithic material, and are not closely datable. 44 sites in the three islands have yielded M and Myc material. Most seem to have been small farmstead-type sites near the coast, chiefly of the Old and New Palace periods. Four sites are near the S coast of Kasos; little M occupation has been found in N Kasos, where Myc evidence is stronger - ?popu- lation shift. Six sites are known near Pigadia in Karpathos, including the M settlement at Xenona. In 1979 a chamber tomb and M deposits were found, associated with MM III-LM Ia pottery. In the Afirartis plain 14 more sites have been found, including Palaio Mitato, where house remains and pottery seem to belong to a fire-destroyed house. At Ton Stavrou to Kefali a LM IIIA chamber tomb appears to have been destroyed (Fig. I34). Near Arkasia a settlement and cemetery were found, the latter at Vonies, where a chamber tomb was found in 1978, with up to four burials, one in a clay larnax; traces of a cremation were noted. 60 LM IIIA2-IIIBi vases were found (Figs. I35a,b; 136). The cremation suggests a connection with the Muvkebi cemetery in the Halikamassos Fig. 134 peninsula. Other M sites have been located on the W coast of Karpathos. Among sites in the N and NE part of the island is a M cemetery at Aperi. The British School at Athens H. W.
