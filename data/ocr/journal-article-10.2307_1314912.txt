<plain_text><page sequence="1">Matthew Arnold and the Castration of Culture By Jan Gordon O God that madest this beautiful earth, when will it be ready to receive Thy saints? Joan in Shaw's Saint Joan But the reign of the real St. Paul is only beginning. Arnold, St. Paul and Protestantism Matthew Arnold's difficulties in choosing a suitable vocation are well known; as a matter of fact, we may owe the very diversity in his thought to a failure to accommodate a remarkable intelligence to the needs of his time. The movement from dandaical poet to the stuffy spokesman of culture in the mid-eighteen sixties and thence to the more pious sphere of religious thought is an evolution remarkably similar to that found in a number of Arnold's twentieth century successors: T.S. Eliot and R.P. Blackmur among them. And, typically, it is the late Arnold that is least familiar to us, if for no other reason than because his mutterings about the Bishop of Winchester and his commentary of St. Paul seem most alien to a culture that has moved so far beyond "Sunday Morning." Yet, our understanding of Arnold's achievement is seriously hampered without a consideration of those statements with which he culminated his career: St. Paul and Protestantism; Literature and Dogma; and God and the Bible. As Arnold the poet had muttered that his was an age Between two worlds, One dead The other powerless to be born, Arnold the pious had apparently, late in his life, discovered a way to give religion a new life based not upon righteousness but upon an iconography of the imagination. Such an iconography has a characteristic spatial and temporal dimension; man's internal and external relationship with his God must be reconciled with the development of faith. But before con- structing this new basis of faith, Arnold had to locate that point in time when Protestantism had been Hebraised, when the emphasis upon psy- chology and experience in St. Paul's Epistles had been transformed into the talismanic character that accented strictness of obedience, letter rather than spirit. 55 Matthew Arnold and the Castration of Culture</page><page sequence="2">It was in constructing this new basis of faith that Arnold revised and substantially altered his vision of the role of culture developed in Culture and Anarchy a decade or so earlier. The shape taken by these revisions have considerable significance to an era when the "cultured man," the goal of our educational institutions, seems to be under such fire. Today, minority groups, as well as the "naturalistic" educators, prefer to re- place the decadent, effete man of culture with the "feeling" man who responds spontaneously to his environment. The authority of culture rapidly becomes the authoritarianism of class brutality, so the argument goes. Paul Goodman, among others, has suggested dis-education as a way of removing class from the classroom and authority from authors. Yet, Arnold, perhaps more than any other critic, realized in his late religious works the expense of making culture a religion. In an effort to replace a dying faith with an alternative to the dry historicism of biblical criticism, he was to equate culture, conduct, and religion. Arnold thought that he was democratizing culture by making it a part of the experiential order, when, in actuality, he was sounding the death-knell for the old- fashioned man of culture by laying the foundation for his parodists. In so many ways, Matthew Arnold's writings on religion constitute a new genre, a kind of anti-historical biblical criticism. The rise of a gen- uine historical criticism of the bible in the nineteenth century is a familiar feature of our cultural history. Ernest Renan's La Vie de Jesus and Strauss' Leben Jesus both attempted to treat not Christ but the more elusive Jesus of Nazareth-the man who existed not in incarnational time but in linear, chronological time. The psychic shock to Victorian con- sciousness is familiar enough; George Eliot praying to a crucifix above her desk while translating Renan into English is but one of the emblems of Victorian doubt in the process of confronting process. It was part of a general movement in the middle of the nineteenth century that historicized the sacramental, and it belongs to the same sphere as does the work of Chambers and Lyell in geology. Not only the Saviour, but the very act of creation was to be seen as part of an on-going process that participated in time rather than transcended it. Uniformitarianism and historicism are really situated on parallel tracks in the nineteenth century; if both the creation of the earth and the creation of our Gods are still going on, then could it not be said that both forms of creative activity are anthropomorphic-efforts of a decidedly human and self-interested imagi- nation to provide some "still" point of origin? This process by which Gods were brought down to the earth is nowhere better illustrated than is the Millais painting Christ in the House of His Parents where the Christ child in the carpenter's shop, devoid of the illuminating Pre-Raphaelite 56 Matthew Arnold and the Castration of Culture</page><page sequence="3">aureoles, appears as a pouting child amidst sawdust, not the Paraclete in alien corn. Matthew Arnold knew perfectly well that Newman had forestalled many of the difficulties that were to beset nineteenth-century faith by making Catholicism a function of history in his An Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine. Contrary to existing in the mainstream of the evolu- tion of Christian thought, Protestantism was placed on a three-hundred year old sidetrack by Newman who saw the effort to purify the' Church as but another corruption, another wolf in sheep's clothing, not unlike the Monophysite heresy of the fourteenth century. Whereas earlier the allegation that a religion was not historically valid would have been greeted as a tautology, Newman made it the sufficient justification for the Oxford Movement. To return to the Mother Church was to return to history. Rather than destroying faith by desacralization, a properly applied historicism would enrich our commitment by making the central Christian experience more immediate. Arnold's grand design in his religious writings bears a certain resem- blance to that of the former Vicar of St. Mary's for whom he had such admiration, although the result is far different. Newman had arrived at a conclusion which was untenable for Arnold by discovering the seat of the developing power to be in the Church. For Arnold, philosophy and criti- cism inevitably tend to alter and develop Church-doctrine. The seat of this developing power is never in the Church itself, but elsewhere. Hence doctrine does not "develop" but is rather merely the outward manifesta- tion of the inner life, whereas for Newman doctrine develops as a natural expression of the worshippers. Like Levi-Strauss years later, Arnold is challenging the whole notion that structure precludes development. Puri- tanism had gone astray by substituting calling, justification, sanctification for the cardinal points in Pauline theology: dying with Christ, resurrec- tion from the dead, and growing into Christ. The doctrine of imputed righteousness which Calvinistic Puritanism had gathered from Paul turns out, upon examination, to be a secondary notion which he himself con- tradicted or corrected. St. Paul and Protestantism, like Arnold's other uses of antitheses, Hebraism and Hellenism and Culture and Anarchy to name just two, is decidedly part of the dialectic of history, not an ex- istential paradox. And that is precisely the point. History itself corrupts in the case, say, of the Epistle to the Romans, by accentuating those aspects of faith which are relevant to the survival of the particular interpretation. Arnold at- tempts to illustrate this idea by examining the term sacrifice which he sees as containing three notions: the idea of winning the favour or buying 57 Matthew Arnold and the Castration of Culture</page><page sequence="4">off the wrath of a powerful being by giving him something precious; the notion of parting with something naturally precious; and the suggestion of spontaneous expiation. Protestantism, for Arnold, has sought to emphasize the first in an attempt to put something at stake. The hint of a binding agreement-in return for your status as an elect group, you must give up something-conceptualized the experience of "suffering," the act of dying to the life of Christ, into the vocabulary of the covenant-bound Jews. An "elect" was substituted for the "chosen People." The purpose was doubt- lessly the infusion of fear necessary to propagate the faith, a rather normal accompaniment to so many pedagogical systems. The expense of such Hebraising, although it clearly completes the historical gap separ- ating Old and New Testament, is the negation of the experiential basis of sacrifice. What Arnold has done is to say that historicism elucidates the fabric of experience at the expense of denying it. Like the modern anthropologists who refuse to remove history from the obligation of de- vising a code with which to analyze its object, Arnold sees historicism as essentially self-interested. The central sacrifice of Christianity- Jesus' surrender of the individual self and selfishness-is precisely the opposite of the self-interest which is a part of the historical success of the faith. In order to place the necessity of "dying into the life of Christ" on an experiential basis, Arnold must redeem all of history, and with it the historicism with which the nineteenth century damaged traditional faith. The first step in this process is his equation in St. Paul and Pro- testantism: "by Protestantism, of course, I mean Puritanism." Like the Newman who argued that development (and our understanding of the idea of development) is dependent upon a reconstitution of one's whole being, Arnold chooses to emphasize the subjective growth neces- sary to true apprehension. He converts Newman's distinction between notional and real assent to the spatial metaphors of contraction and ex- pansion: "We put on Christ; we identify ourselves-this is the line of Paul's thought-with Christ." And only in this way do we act in joyful con- formity with God's will, instead of in miserable rebellion to it. Such a pattern represents a decided departure from Arnold's earlier writings on culture where he had encouraged the cultivation of our "best self," a sense of identification with the best that had been thought and said in the world. Earlier, in Culture and Anarchy, Arnold had appealed to our abil- ity to transcend the boundaries of class with all of its implied private loyalties and acquisitiveness. Now, culture and harmony are possible only through grace and peace-the annulment of our ordinary self through the mildness and sweet reasonableness of Jesus Christ. We identify not with verbalization of cultural ideas, but with the experience of individual 58 Matthew Arnold and the Castration of Culture</page><page sequence="5">loss; true religious identification for the Christian hence involves the real experience of sacrifice not a recognition of its historical evolution. In reshaping history by demanding the individual's involvement in its rhythms, Arnold is transforming biblical criticism into theodicy, so that the very texture of his work participates in his demands: that the individ- ual life be sacrificed to an externally referential order. The three books relate respectively a Fall (during which history commences); the account of the history of that Fall; and a "confession." Literature and Dogma is the strange "bible" of Arnold's attempt to "recast religion." Realizing that the denial of self in one's conduct may complement the earlier demand to discover a "best" self (by producing either schizophrenic "selves" or certain layers of identity), Arnold is able to associate his aim of a revived faith with the ambitions of a reju- venated culture. By associating culture and faith in his "Preface to the First Edition," Matthew Arnold recapitulates his notion that the best part of religion is its unconscious poetry. The shortcut to culture is the possession of the right kind of faith, and Arnold establishes the interrela- tionship of the two as clearly as T.S. Eliot was to do later in Notes To- ward a Definition of Culture. But the implications of Arnold's attempt to make culture and religion interchangeable (via their sharing of the imaginative language of poetry) are profound. As we shall see, one apostle could well have been Oscar Wilde who regarded himself as the logical successor to Matthew Arnold in so many spheres. Rather than defining the function of the critic as that of "seeing things as they really are," Oscar Wilde was to parody Arnold- ian objectivity in the aphorism which precedes The Picture of Dorian Gray: "The critic is he who can translate into another manner or a new material his impression of beautiful things." Upon arriving in America, Wilde was to establish his credibility by stressing their common Celtic origins. Even more important than these assumed surface similarities were Wilde's efforts to press Arnold's thinking to, and perhaps beyond, its logical limits. If the cultured man must convert his convictions to con- duct, then self-sacrifice, the renunciation that will somehow purify one's being, is a necessary prerequisite. Rather than writing objectively about culture as he had earlier, the Arnold of Literature and Dogma and God and the Bible demands that we convert our very being to culture. The re- sult may well have been the process by which the cultured man was equated with the stylized, aristocratic dandy. In the act, his "sweet rea- sonableness" is proved upon the pulses of experience, and culture be- comes the attribute of a fairly exclusive human being. Although he would have probably been the last to admit it, Arnold's demands, in giving cul- 59 Matthew Arnold and the Castration of Culture</page><page sequence="6">ture a religious base, served to give it and its priests an iconography. Such an iconography obviously emphasized the stylistic fictions rather than the historical dimension of the faith. It is almost as if Arnold were playing into the hands of those fin-de-si&amp;cle hedonists who would make "experience" a religion complete with its own sacred and secret rites. In a desire to democratize culture-as-conduct, Arnold was unwittingly making it the provence of the elite. Arnold's God is a curious "figure" whose dim outline is established only insofar as it reflects the potential of an imaginative being. By defin- ing God as the "stream of tendency by which all things seek to fulfill the law of their being," Arnold in effect is saying that the phrase "trust in God" would be but a righteous way of counseling one to trust in the laws of conduct. For Arnold a system of theological notions about person- ality, essence, existence and consubstantiality is artificial and is the opposite of revealed, since it is a religion which comes forth in no one's consciousness. And the experience of faith for Arnold involves a radical change of being that would internalize the emotion. We talk about causa- tion when we should be talking about much simpler things: the power, the grandeur, and the necessity of righteousness. Arnold never once disguises the fact that he favors a popular religion, untainted by the extravagance of theologians. Unfortunately, it is a religion of nuance. And like any number of populists, he has a healthy respect for "aber- glaube"-the term that Arnold used to describe that added or "Extra- faith" which is a historical function of development. Rather than emphasizing the superstition that is part and parcel of "Aberglaube" (actually the two words are probably synonymous), he elects to associate it with hope and the workings of the imagination. As such, "Aberglaube" is the poetry of life, that part of religion that exhibits the collective con- sciousness of a race that wishes, by accident or intent, to go beyond the immediately verifiable that is the incessant object of the Hebraists. The difficulty stems from the fact that "Aberglaube" tends always to imagine itself science, to assume that it is part of the letter of the faith. Such is the intrinsic rage for order of all art. And it is precisely the letter of faith that, as Arnold well knew, was most vulnerable to assaults at the hands of nineteenth-century science. By taking itself literally, "Aber- glaube" was hastening its own destruction, for unlike superstition, sci- ence is always at the mercy of advances in science. It was, of course, Arnold's way of saying that scientific development kills while the more natural "Aberglaube" giveth life, even if it is more nearly akin to fantasy life. In Arnold's scheme, Christianity obviously arose from the Decadence 60 Matthew Arnold and the Castration of Culture</page><page sequence="7">of the Hebrew faith. Originally, Judaism had a national and social function both of which are uniquely capable of a mechanical exterior performance in which the heart has no share. Presumably, one may observe rites and ceremonies, hate idolatry, abstain from murder and theft, and yet have one's inner thoughts disordered. If the very power of religion lies in bringing emotion to bear on the three-quarters of life that is conduct, then we must eventually reach a condition when we no longer act out of respect to duty, but follow the commandments instinctively. And yet the Igraelites lost their primary intention, obviously suggesting the want of inwardness and feeling. This was remedied by adding mercy and humility to judgment and justice. And there arose a new "Aberglaube"; the mild, inward, self- renouncing, sacrificed Servant of the Eternal became the Messiah. The future and the miraculous engaged the Christian imagination as part of the "Aberglaube"-designed to explain the circumstances surrounding a new creation as the covenant had explained the Commandments of the past. Arnold, of course, sees the man of culture as identical with the religious man since each are involved in a suspension of acquisitive will that he denoted as the "ordinary self." Interestingly, he shows himself closely allied to the Schopenhauer of The World as Will and Idea who sought some mode of renouncing the endless willing that had become such a metaphor for German idealism in the nineteenth century. Unfortunately, Arnold's Empedocles does not have the alternative of suicide-the mean- ingless alternation of excitement and ennui continue even after the famous leap into the crater. But in general, the search for that "assiette"-a condition of full being- characterizes both Arnoldism and Schopenhauerian vision. By understanding that all language, including the language of the Bible, is metaphoric, Arnold is requesting that the religious men of the future be sophisticated specialists in linguistics, if not poets. The Word is to be replaced by something far more fluid and temporary-Aberglaube-in which all the people can participate. In elasticizing religious dogma he transforms the Book into books (with a small "b"); the collective wisdom of civilization has an equal share in the shaping of communal participa- tion. As such, there should be no question of validity when talking about religion, since validity has reference to truth, not metaphor. Of even greater interest is the real message behind Arnold's cumber- some language, wherein he unwittingly raises the whole question of a popular religion. Although Arnold would probably be the last to admit his membership among the evangelicals, there is a legitimate sense in which he is asking the same question that men like Clapham had done earlier: how do we achieve a participatory religion that will have some claim upon 61 Matthew Arnold and the Castration of Culture</page><page sequence="8">authority? His writings on culture gave him a unique preparation for this task. You will recall that in Culture and Anarchy Arnold had all but given up hope for all but the middle class. Throughout his career Arnold had been suspicious of High Culture, for it tended to induce a tyranny of the elite saturated by "gin and fizz" whereas the lower classes had not the leisure to acquire culture. By concentrating upon a broad-based middle class in both his cultural and theological pronouncements, Arnold estab- lishes himself as one of the early explorers on the frontiers of the phe- nomenon of "pop." Through democratizing the religious "experience" Arnold is reducing the distinction between the Divine and his celebrants. The "not our- selves" turns out to be but an extension of ourselves; His language is pervaded by human metaphor; and even the History of His Presence is coterminal with the history of human experience. Arnold wants to widen the subject matter of faith. However much we discover of Christ, we can never know him entirely, not because the Godhead is transcendent but because we cannot know the construction which each of us brings to Him. The error is the same-we tend to substitute the part for the whole-but the parts are human not Divine. We are to read His word not so much as given but as constantly recreated. Religion is constantly re-forming itself and the only tradition is, quite literally, the tradition of the new, to borrow from Harold Rosenberg. There are difficulties. For one thing, "pop" involves intensive styli- zation and its complement, self-conscious manipulation of an audience. -That is to say that Arnold's revolution against dogmatic theology follows a somewhat standard pattern that associates "pop" with reprimitiviza- tion. He emphasizes "experience" rather than law, feeling rather than the quest for certainty. After Arnold outlines the contours of his faith it becomes clear that the question "is that religion?" which any sane man is prompted to ask upon reading Literature and Dogma or God and the Bible, is perhaps the most relevant query of all. For it is only when man can no longer distinguish religion from ordinary experience that religion can be said to be meaningful. Revelation is not an enlightenment that originates from "outside" and transforms the soul, but is rather a new mode of experiencing the mundane. In the "Conclusion" to Literature and Dogma, Arnold answers the charge that he has denied culture in order to emphasize the other three quarters of existence, conduct or experience. But one comes away not entirely satisfied with the excuse. What he tries to accomplish at the last possible moment is an equation of conduct (experience) with culture: 62 Matthew Arnold and the Castration of Culture</page><page sequence="9">So that conduct is impaired by the want of science and culture; and our theolo- gians really suffer, not from having too much science, but from having too little. Whereas, if they had turned their faculty for abstruse reasoning towards the proper objects, and had given themselves, in addition, a wide and large acquaintance with the productions of the human spirit and with men's way of thinking and of using words, then, on the one hand, they would not have been tempted to misemploy on the Bible their faculty for abstruse reasoning, for they would have had plenty of other exercise for it; and, on the other hand, they would have escaped the literary inexperience which now makes them fancy that the Bible-language is scientific, and fit matter for the application of their powers of abstruse reasoning to it, when it is no such thing. Until the nature of God is as well known as the nature of a cone or a tri- angle, Arnold is in favor of revelling in the ignorance of experience. Cul- ture is required to prevent the mishandling that accompanies metaphysical explanations of conduct (and is for that reason, defined negatively) pre- cisely because culture provides the aesthetic and intellective dimension by which we fulfill the law of our being. The clearer our conceptions of art become, Arnold claims, the clearer will it come to resemble the rules of conduct. What he is pointing to is the predominance of a popular religion which, precisely because it is the collective expression of all the people, will be identical with the myriad ways in which they treat each other. Unfor- tunately, there is some error in Matthew Arnold's mathematics, for it is the nature of the "pop" mode to seldom qualify as popular. The facts of life are that Andy Warhohl and Roy Lichtenstein tend to be less well known among the masses than Andrew Wyeth or Norman Rockwell. And so it is, one suspects, with matters of faith. The theologians have been put in their place at an enormous price: any aesthetic arrangement of experience has become a valid object of faith. One is reminded of the aesthete in Kierkegaard's Either/Or who discovers that the aesthetic life redeems the religious but never the ethical. Sensuousness already existed in the world, but is was Christianity, alleges Kierkegaard, that provided its spiritual determination. The desire for unmediated con- sciousness is dangerously close to heightened self-consciousness. If we simply give an aesthetic dimension to our conduct, then culture and con- duct are identities with some loss in the potency of the former. And it is this loss of emphasis upon culture, the discovery of an inherent weakness in the "cultured man" that is the subject of God and the Bible, indicating as well as anything else a new Matthew Arnold. God and the Bible adequately fulfills Arnold's promises. Rather than the systoles and diastoles of theological history that were detailed in Literature and Dogma ("Aberglaube" invades and then re-invades in 63 Matthew Arnold and the Castration of Culture</page><page sequence="10">successive chapters), Arnold concerns himself with conduct. Questions of marrying a deceased wife's sister or the burial of nonconformists in state cemeteries surmount the larger historical issues. And one knows that conduct has indeed replaced culture as the basis of Arnold's religion- and his own conduct does not go unaffected. For God and the Bible picks up the motif established in the "Conclusion" to Literature and Dogma and comes to resemble a "confession"-that process by which man re- nounces his ordinary self and assumes the patterned, stylized posture of the saint. If Literature and Dogma is the historical record of Chris- tianity through Arnold's eyes, then God and the Bible is the book wherein the loss of self necessary to complete the historical vision-the sparagmos -is detailed. It is a logical enough step. Once its unconscious poetry is established as the best part of religion, then we are only a step away from making of art a religion and of religion an art. What Arnold has been doing is de- scribing that process by which the Christian faith became decadent, in- sofar as its spirit was encumbered by the rigidity of the letter. And the vision of that last of Arnold's triad of religious books makes the deca- dence even more explicit. Although he wishes to return to the primitive faith (a faith based solely upon conduct), one sees that Arnold's notion of return is strangely like a continuation of the decline. To discover the new self, we must surrender our being in a complex process of individua- tion. The pious Arnold, having undergone a Dionysan torment, reappears as the effete Apostle of Apollo as well as the Apostle of Culture. Arnold would have been shocked had he known that Oscar Wilde re- quested copies of Literature and Dogma and God and the Bible while in Wandsworth Prison. And yet there is a connection. For the man preparing to write a hedonist Apologia Pro Vita Sua, Arnold's eschatology must have been interesting. Like Arnold, Wilde was preparing a new "self' in a complex re-birth ritual. Like so many late Victorians, he was to use the form of the De Profundis to participate in that act of renunciation. To surrender one's being for the "assiette" of artifact involves the ultimate in conduct-self-sacrifice. To imitate the life of Christ is to surrender existence, so that Wilde's conversion is as much aesthetic as religious. It confirms the original sensuousness of the crime, only legitimized with the pseudonym "St. Sebastian." Wilde became a martyr to the culture that denied him his existence. In dropping the "Melmoth" surname and returning to the posture of eternal childhood, Wilde was using the Hel- lenism of the aesthete to redeem his own Hebraic origins. He was exper- iencing the religion of culture, precisely by living it, thereby converting autobiography to art. The aphorison is a Wildian figure upon Arnold's 64 Matthew Arnold and the Castration of Culture</page><page sequence="11">"Touchstones,"--a religious truth in which an aural tautology replaces all logic. The connection that I am trying to make is not as tenuous as it might appear at first glance. Namely, that in discussing the process of a de- cline in faith and the need for creating an aesthetically viable Christian- ity, the Arnold of the eighteen-eighties is pointing the way toward certain aspects of the fin-de-siecle sensibility. In talking of the need for saint- hood, he is perilously close to all those conversions to Catholicism by which disordered men gave order to their lives in a sacrificial gesture. One possible link might be Richard Le Gallienne's The Religion of a Literary Man wherein the aesthete equates religion with the cultivated responses of the dandy to his own work. Anthropomorphism has been transformed into narcissism, and reflection of a doppelganger replaces divine illumination. And today the "culture hero"-the man who surrenders his identity for art on performance-is a part of our collective conduct. The stylization of Tiny Tim (who breaks bread and honey with Johnny Carson) or Andy Warhohl who utters the pop-comic strip jargon "Oh! no! please don't shoot, please don't shoot" during an assassination attempt are both be- ings who have sacramentalized their existence, suspended their ordinary (and one might say, masculine) selves. The world of the aesthete is polymorphous perverse, not hermaphroditic. The aesthetic moment is made sacred at the expense of denying its cultural value. Late in his life, Arnold journeyed to America to convert the heathen, having allowed his hair to grow long-almost as if to return to the dandaical poseur of youth. Before the "amen" to aesthetic Christianity, the faith demanded the sacrificial gesture of a culture hero wandering in the desert-with a multiplicity of selves rather than worlds.
