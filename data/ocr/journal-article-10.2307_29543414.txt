<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE RHETORIC OF MONUMENTALITY LEDOUX AND THE BARRIERES OF PARIS Anthony Vidier None of Ledoux's designs, projected or built, were so immediately and consistently the objects of outrage, criti? cism and condemnation as were the barrieres of Paris.1 The Saline de Chaux had shocked the conventions of court and contractors, but might be dismissed as an aberration in a distant region, in any case no more than a lowly function over aggrandized; the magnificences of private hotels, from the Pavil? ion du Barry to the Hotel Thelusson, were remarked on with curi? osity and amazement, but were no more than expressions of the luxurious follies of their clients; the projects for the Ideal City of Chaux were to be dismissed after Ledoux's death as characteristic of his madness or at least megalomania, but they were in the relatively harmless realm of Utopia; but the barrieres were inex? tricably joined, in conception and realization, to the fate of the ancien regime. Erected in its last years, in secrecy and haste, they were inevitably seen as the visible emblems of fiscal tyranny, the overblown signs of the hated Ferme Generale; their monumen tality and strange forms, exaggerating traditional architectural motifs in scale and placement to the point of caricature, seemed apt demonstrations of economic profligacy. They were attacked by latter-day physiocrats as epitomizing a useless investment in urban embellishment and the evils of a monopoly system of centralized taxation; by reform ministers as denying by their very cost the benefits they were erected to collect; by journalists, who seized on their 'bizarre' nature and ubiquity as objects around which to rally criticism of the government and its agents; by a wide-ranging coalition of special interests, from the tavern keepers outside the tax boundaries whose profits in untaxed wine were undermined, wine traders, legal and illegal, to the pro? prietors of expropriated lands; finally, by architects and critics for their outrageous flouting of all classical canons. What for Ledoux, and a small circle of loyal friends, represented the height of his aspirations as an architect, bringing together the general amelioration of urban circulation at the scale of the entire city with the monumental embellishment of every quarter ? a truly Roman project ? became in a short time the cause of his disgrace, downfall and subsequent reputation. From barrieres to propylees The limits of the city of Paris, from the demolition of the old fortifications in 1670, were defined, not by defensive but by fiscal needs, as the boundaries of an area of taxation.2 The enclosure of milestones erected in 1672, and supplemented throughout the eighteenth century by wooden palisades, marked the points of collection of the droits d'octroi of Paris: the droits d'entree, levied on wine and other liquids; le pied four che, or tax levied on livestock; the droits imposed on straw, wood, coal, cooked fruits, spiced meats, game and poultry. The collection of these dues was in the hands of the Ferme, who complained continually about the difficulties of administering and policing a 'wall' that was often non-existent, that no longer represented the true limits of a rap? idly growing city, that was subject to multiple local laws, that was easily breached by tunnels or openings, and that, in the event, was rendered ineffective by the numerous inns, or guinguettes, that traded in untaxed wine outside the barrieres. The pressure for funds that did not require the assent of Parliament in the early 1780s led the Ferme to commission a report on the wall from one of their company, Lavoisier; in a plan submitted in 1782, the scientist estimated that some six million livres were lost each year through fraud and lack of surveillance and proposed the building of a new, permanent wall commencing with the left-bank quarters that stretched from the Quai d'Austerlitz to the Invalides. Lavoisier's projected route extended the southern boundary of the city in order to enclose the hitherto external properties of the Hopital Generale, the Salpetriere, the districts of Vaugirard, Gros-Caillou, the Ecole Militaire, and the Invalides themselves. In this plan the demands of fiscal order were clearly associated with those of social police; the quarters around the Salpetriere were notorious centres of criminal life, their guinguettes brought together the unemployed, the destitute and the petty thief, those 'dangerous and labouring classes'.3 Tabled under Necker, the scheme was resurrected in the first year of Calonne's administration, joined now to a grand plan of amelioration for the entire faubourgs. The Baron de Breteuil sent copies to Calonne and to the city of Paris who asked for a report from P.L. Moreau, the city architect; accepted in principle by Moreau, it was finally adopted by the Prev?t des Marchands of Paris in early May, 1784, with a commitment on the part of the city to share in the expense of construction with the Ferme. Clearly the city anticipated benefits beyond those of efficient tax collection: 'nous estimons que le projet presente par les fermiers generaux ne peut etre qu'utile ? la perception des droits du roy et qu'il en resultera de grands avantages par rapport ? la circulation des voitures et ? toutes les operations du commerce\4 In his Mem 14 AA FILES 7</page><page sequence="2">oires, published long after the Revolution, the Comte du Mollien, in 1784 a young treasury assistant to Calonne, recollected that such urbanistic considerations were integral to the city's policy: II ne suffisait pas d'opposer ? la fraude une haute muraille, il fallait que cette fortification fiscale e?t son chemin de ronde; quelle f?t isolee au dedans, et plus encore du dehors, des habitations particulieres. Nous im agin?mes de convertir Pisolement exterieur en un boulevard qui p?t embrasser toute Venceinte; ce boulevard devait faciliter toute les com? munications et eclairer la surveillance des commis. II devait en meme temps offrir aux habitants de Paris, dans un circuit de quelques milliers de toises, une promenade nouvelle, et sur un terrain libre.5 Such a peripheral boulevard would not only serve as a kind of cordon policiere for the better oversight of the tax collectors; it would also provide a route around Paris for heavy traffic that otherwise would destroy the internal streets. Ledoux, similarly, found justification for the extensive nature of the works in their attendant contributions to urban embellishment at every level, symbolic and practical. Calonne and Louis XVI, anxious to begin construction of the southern tax wall without too much publicity, arranged for what a later critic, Dulaure, was to characterize as 'qu'un simple arret du Conseil, ni publie ni affiche', issued on 23 January 1785, to ratify a project already several months under way: from May 1784, Ledoux, as the favoured architect of both the Ferme and Calonne, had been asked to prepare preliminary designs; by September of the same year the contractors had been selected; and a month later Ledoux had appropriated some 10,000 livres to buy the first materials. By the beginning of June 1785, ground had been broken around the Salpetriere under the administration of M. de Colonia, Premier Commis des Fermes. By the middle of the year the project was extended to encompass the whole of Paris. Ledoux, conscious of the political and financial pressures ranged against the project, was indefatigable in pushing ahead the work as fast as possible, preparing designs and estimates, visiting sites, and even intervening directly in disputes over expropriation costs. A proprietor in the Vaugirard district, owner of a piece of marshy ground, demanded some 63,000 livres for what the Ferme estimated to be 12,000 livres in value; he was honoured by several visits from Ledoux 'pour lui faire sentir le ridicule de sa demande'.6 Such activism on Ledoux's part largely denies his later attempts to portray himself as the innocent victim of policies not his own, the 'pure' artist interested only in the aesthetic qualities of the work. Personal animosity inspired by the architect's threats and apparently unchecked power must have contributed to an already mythical reputation as an architecte maudit. His own vision of the new building programme was couched in almost Bib? lical terms, as he assumed personal responsibility for the total urban reconstruction of the city boundaries: je transplanterai les montagnes; je dessecherai les marais, comblerai les precipices dont les vapeurs repompees par le soleil, retombent sur la tete des humains quand les tourbillons du serein se condensent; je gonflerai les pentes de la plaine pour ecouler les eaux paresseuses; je presenterai les chemins destinees ? desobstruer l'interieur de la ville; ces magnifiques boulevards, sans exemple pour l'etendue, je les preserverai des fardeaux excedents qui ecrasent le gres, inquietent Thabitant craintif ou preoccupe.7 The general plan called for the construction of a continuous wall, some 3.3 metres high and over 23 kilometres long, along a route that brought into the city a wide strip of largely undevel? oped land, thus increasing the area of Paris itself from approxi? mately 1,103 hectares to 3,370 hectares. Around the inside of this wall was a twelve-metre-wide peripheral road; outside, for secur? ity reasons, was a strip of some hundred metres within which no building was permitted. A sixty-metre-wide boulevard surrounded the city in this zone. At the intersections of entering roads were built the barrieres themselves, sometimes as single pavilions, sometimes as double pavilions flanking the gate, together with additional sentry boxes, storehouses and workshops. Altogether, some sixty major barrieres were planned by Ledoux, most of which were built before the Revolution interrupted the work, despite public outcry, official enquiries and a change of architects. The first complaints were voiced towards the end of 1784; the bookseller Hardy noted in October that 'tout le monde se recrioit contre l'execution de Petrange projet des fermiers generaux' at the sight of the walls, then already three feet high, appearing around the Salpetriere; he lamented the loss to the city dweller of 'du doux plaisir de pouvoir contempler les campagnes verdoyantes comme de celui de respirer, fetes et dimanches, un air pur apres avoir travaille toute une semaine dans des habitations dont un grand nombre etoient aussi tristes que malsaines'.8 This theme of a Paris rendered unhealthy by a kind of forced incarceration, deprived of light and air by a wall comparable to that of a prison, turns the aspiration of the urban embellisher on itself and makes of the architect-reformer an institutionalizer of the urban popula? tion. Walls, by the end of the century, no longer indicate a monu? mental glory, but signify an exclusion common to the cemetery and the prison; the epigrams of 1785 reinforced this metaphor: Le mur, murant Paris, rend Paris murmurant, and the popular rhyme, repeated in opposition pamphlets,9 Pour augmenter son numeraire Et raccourcir notre horizon, La ferme a juge necessaire De mettre Paris en prison, confirmed its attractiveness. By 1787 the fashion of this compar? ison was such that Bachaumont published a poem satirizing the 'decoration' of the prison walls:10 En vain de la muraille immense Dont tu nous cernes dans Paris, Pour des brocards et des ecrits On persiffle extravagance. Pour moi j'approuve ta raison Et j'estime ton plan fort sage; Le Doux selon un vieux adage, II faut embellir sa prison. Another favourite pun played on the names of the officials involved:11 On continue done les Colonnades, Colonnades ou Coloniades. By the beginning of 1786 the Premiere Chambre des Enquetes was hearing complaints from the landowners of the faubourgs, expropriated or about to be; a delegation from Montmartre representing 120 inhabitants was led by the Abbess of the Convent of Montmartre, registering discontent with the path of the wall between Clichy and Rochouant.12 All such manifestations were without effect, however, with Calonne secure in his post and sup? porting the decisions of the Ferme and Ledoux. Between 1785 and the spring of 1787, the works advanced rapidly, and were complete enough to invite detailed criticism of their by now obviously unorthodox architecture. The most com? plete indictment was published under the title Reclamation d'un citoyen contre la nouvelle enceinte de Paris, by Dulaure, a sympathizer with physiocratic tenets. His first attack was based on the argument that such a wall prevented the free circulation of the air throughout the city; 'eile nuit ? la salubrite de Pair', he AA FILES 7 15</page><page sequence="3">asserted, concluding that the city, already in a basin surrounded by hills, would be deprived of some 45,000 cubic toises of air each second by this enceinte, amounting to 1,620,000 cubic feet each minute.13 This went entirely against the best medical advice which was agitating for the removal of the cemeteries, the fosses d'aisance, and the hospitals from the centre of the city precisely to prevent epidemics. The Ferme, therefore, was guilty, for the sake of its revenues, of sacrificing the health and lives of hundreds of thousands of citizens. Secondly, and again according to physio cratic doctrine, Dulaure objects to the enlarging of the city limits which, by enclosing a wider, yet unbuilt area, will simply en? courage an increase in the population. Already the stream of vagrants and job-seekers from the countryside had created a city where 'les crimes et les besoins y sont plus multiplies', where Texemple de la bassese et du crime recompenses, de la vertu humiliee, de l'opulence seule respectee et d'une aveugle emulation etablie par la luxe, porte chaque jour au brigandage, ? la dissolu? tion, aux crimes atroces'.14 The city thus expanded will invade the countryside, deserted and demoralized, and the youth of the nation will be corrupted. Health, police and morals will be undermined by the wall. And the evident sign of this pernicious luxury was, of course, the architecture of the barrieres them? selves, the horrifying impropriety of which he details with gusto. He begins his criticism with a definition of the character appro? priate to such offices: Tarchitecture en doit etre simple et con forme ? l'etat peu brillant peu estime de ceux qui les habitent . . . ce caractere de simplicite qui leur convient'.15 The gates that he observes hardly correspond to such decorum: their decorations, 'bizarre', include columns without bases, deeply cut rustication, armorial bearings; their associations as building types range from the rustic temple of Montparnasse, to the cavern or prison of the Bureau de la Voirie ? a suitable character for a wall imprisoning Paris; small churches, catacombs, tombs, palaces and temples form the rest of the inventions of Ledoux. All contravene the laws and morals of suitability, all aggrandize a function which, in itself, is base. Dulaure concludes, nous devons nous elever contre l'abus, qui blesse publiquement le bon go?t, qui prostitue ? des Commis de Barrieres les richesses de l'architec ture, qui insulte ? la misere du Peuple, en lui montrant avec un appareil triomphant et magnifique, les objets qui aggravent le fardeau de son exist? ence, et en le for^ant, pour ainsi dire, d'admirer les instruments de ses malheurs nous devons nous elever fortement contre cet abus, qui outrage la Nation, en etalant pompeusement son humiliante servitude et les moyens honteux et violent aux quels ses besoins Tont force de recourir.16 Sebastien Mercier, writing his own catalogue of architectural sins committed by Ledoux, will conclude with the equally celebrated slogan, 'Monsieur Ledoux, vous etes un terrible architecte.'17 With the fall of Calonne in April 1787, however, the total support enjoyed by Ledoux from the royal administration was shaken, and the renewed attacks on the now only too evident wall and its obviously megalomaniacal gates forced Louis XVI to accede to an enquiry. Ledoux was called to render an account of the expenses incurred from May 1786 to February 1787, and as a result was ordered to economize by some 700,000 livres by the Intendent of Finances, Douet de la Boullaye, in July. Another, more serious enquiry was launched at the beginning of Septem? ber: Ledoux was ordered to submit all plans, estimates and docu? mentation to a commission of architects, formed of Jacques Denis Antoine and Jean Arnaud Raymond, both members of the Academie (the latter the personal architect of Calonne's succes? sor, the Archbishop Lommenie de Brienne), together with Perard de Montreuil, architect and censeur royale. Lommenie's Control? ler General, Lambert, ordered the commission to verify and in spect the work accomplished to date, but its investigation was hin? dered by Ledoux, who chose to ignore its activities. Lambert personally instructed Ledoux to provide all the relevant papers 'dans le jour', on 4 October, and the architect's further resistance was followed by visits, first of the officials of the Controller General's office, then of Lommenie de Brienne himself, to Ledoux's atelier: the architect either refused to appear or went into hiding for the day. Finally, on 25 November, the King was induced to suspend all work on the barrieres pending the outcome of the enquiry. The commission, hitherto ineffective, was augmented by two more members of the Academie, Hazon, Intendent General des B?ti ments du Roi, and Brebion, Controlleur General des B?timents du Roi. Site visits were arranged, and Ledoux was once again ordered to submit all records to the investigators, as well as to meet with them and abide by any economies they suggested. Despite this, Ledoux was strongly protected within the adminis? tration, no doubt with the backing of the Ferme, who resented this royal interference in what they regarded as a purely internal matter, and was reinstated in his full functions as architect in February 1788. Three months later, the Controller's office tried to reconstruct the commission of enquiry by the replacement of Perard, an avowed supporter of Ledoux, by Roche, a function? ary; the acquisition of land was given over to another royal administrator. It was not, however, until the fall of de Brienne and the reappointment of Necker in late 1788 that Ledoux's posi? tion became again untenable. The reports submitted to Necker indicated massive increases in building costs on every barriere: the Bureau de l'Etoile, for example, estimated by Ledoux at 96,000 livres, had cost some 500,000, while the Bureau de Mon9eau had risen from 26,000 to 70,000 livres, bringing the entire costs to date to over 17,000,000 livres. Necker removed Antoine from the com? mission on the charge of having aided Ledoux to increase his expenses and, in May of 1789, definitively removed Ledoux from the works. Ledoux immediately asked to be judged by his equals in the Academie and, throughout June and July, sent Necker a series of letters claiming innocence of wrongdoing and injury from injustice, appealing first to Necker's sense of professional probity, then to his compassion: 'Vous, monsieur Necker, dont la fortune et les principes sont purs, comment se peut il que votre nom soit place au bas d'une injustice. II faut, ? des affronts pub liques et non merites des consolations publiques et meritees; c'est la loi naturelle, eile est gardee dans tous les couleurs vertueux, eile doit l'etre dans le votre.'18 But Ledoux, and eventually Necker himself, were now no longer working in a state that recognized such appeals from an academician and royalist of the ancien regime: a week after Ledoux's final petition to Necker, on 10 July 1789, and continu? ing for five days, the barrieres were systematically looted and burned by groups recruited from the unemployed and destitute of the banlieu. While these events intersected with the storming of the Bastille on the 14th, they were probably orchestrated by those with direct grievances against the Ferme and the octroi ? tavern owners, dispossessed landowners, wine smugglers and the like.19 In all, out of fifty-five almost completed structures, forty-six suf? fered considerable damage and the destruction of their contents. Antoine, who had been recalled on the final dismissal of Le? doux, was given the task of repairing and completing the construction work; the wall and its toll-gates were ready for operation by the spring of 1790, and the Ferme organized a force of some 600 guards to protect its new offices, pushed through a decree in the Constituent Assembly reaffirming its rights to collect dues within the newly enclosed territories, and began to install its 16 AA FILES 7</page><page sequence="4">s.1 S.K 0 C ?a 1| f I 1 ? ?8'S a cu ?51 ill ?TS ?)

Over the next year, the barrieres and the officers of the Ferme were subjected to more and more attacks from the population living outside the gates (estimated by La Fayette to include some 22,000 workers), joined by 'des fraudeurs en aussi grand nombre\ and aided by the general populace in certain areas. An anxious government voted for a suspension of the entry taxes beginning 1 May 1791; on this day a procession of the Garde Nationale, with a band of musicians at its head, patrolled the wall in an effort to reduce looting and further destruction of the gates, while the population, supplied by a stream of wine carts, celebrated in front of each barriere before marching to the Place Louis XV. Eight years later, the city of Paris reinstated the octroi in a form that survived well into the modern period. Experimental typologies The architectural programme for Ledoux's gates had been sketched, traditionally enough, by Laugier himself; in a long passage towards the end of his Essai he castigated the existing palisades and called for a new monumentality at the edge of the city: L'entree d'une grande ville doit etre decoree, et avoir un air de magnifi? cence et de grandeur. Rien de plus chetif et de plus pauvre que ces barrieres qui font aujourd'hui les vraies portes de Paris. De quelque cote qu'on arrive en cette Capitale, le premier objet qui se presente, ce sont quelques mechantes palissades elevees tant bien que mal sur des traver siers de bois, roulant sur deux vieux gonds, et flanquees de deux ou trois tas de furnier. C'est ce que Ton qualifie du titre pompeux de portes de Paris. On ne voit rien d'aussi miserable dans les plus petits bourgs du royaume. Les etrangers qui passent par ces barrieres tombent des nues, quand on leur dit que les voil? dans la Capitale de la France. II faut argumenter avec eux pour les convaincre, ils ont peine ? en croire leurs yeux, ils s'imaginent etre encore dans quelque village voisin.20 In place of these 'indecent' gates, Laugier demanded the erection of great triumphal arches, the only suitable decoration for capital cities, in order to make of Paris a new Rome. His ideal paradigm was BlondeFs Porte Saint Denis, which was both grand in its pro? portions and simple and strong in its ornamentation. Laugier imagined these arches standing at the end of tree-lined boulevards giving onto large oval or semi-circular places from which radiated the streets of the city. In principle, Ledoux agreed totally with these observations, and made it clear that in his own plans he was responding directly to Laugier: 'Je devillagerai une peuplade de huit cent mille hommes pour lui donner l'independance qu'une ville tient de son isole ment; je placerai les trophees de la victoire aux issues fermees qui mutilent ses lignes de tendances.'21 In practice, of course, Ledoux's vision of monumental character was totally opposed to the conventional, classicizing aesthetics of Laugier. Instead of the completion of Colbert's 'new Rome', Ledoux envisioned a veri? table theatre of variety around the edges of Paris, conceiving each toll-gate as an exercise in differentiation and contrast rather than similarity and unity: like a landscape painter bringing together various fragments of antiquity to compose a picturesque tableau, Ledoux assembled variations of every classical and Renaissance type in transformation and recombination, set like some arcadian natural city in the rustic environs of the periphery: 'tableaux qui se lient aux sites les plus piquants, et dont les effets tiennent ? la magie trompeuse de nos theatres'. The architecture of spectacle is thus transferred from the city inside the theatre to the city itself, and the analogy of changing scenes adopted as a paradigm for the successive images presented by each gate, seen on the move, so to speak, as the traveller beats the bounds of the city along the new ring-road. In this sense, the evident transformational grammar of the barrieres takes on the illusion of one gate merging with and changing into the next: at once a chain of aesthetic association modelled on Lockean and Condillacian precedent, and a literal scene of decomposition and recomposition experienced by a moving subject, 'des constructions dont la diversite rassasie la soif du desir'. The forms of temples, tombs, rotundas, hotels particu liers, pavilions and, more rarely, triumphal arches are conjured up to render the outskirts a field of antique allusion and illusion, as if the Campo Marzio, not far from Ledoux's mind, had been resurrected in Piranesian splendour. The evident eclecticism of such a programme was immediately clear: the 'museum of types' assembled by Ledoux bore a direct resemblance to that being con? structed in scale plaster models by Cassas as a didactic tool for architectural education.22 This too must have formed part of Ledoux's intention; later, in characterizing the collection of his designs in L 'Architecture, he refers to this collapsing of history as a means of providing a readily accessible collection of models for imitation: Persuade qu'en abregeant les annales du temps, et en reunissant les modeles et les principes que Tart y a deposes, je peux lui imprimer a lui meme un mouvement createur qui lui fasse enfanter des chefs-d'oeuvre, et aggrandir son domaine et son gloire, j'ai rassemble, dans une lecture de quelques jours, toutes les richesses des siecles qui nous ont precedes.23 What for the architectural student will be a 'tableau de . . . com? positions aussi variees que nombreuses', presented as an object lesson in the principles of form, composition and character, will for the citizen of Paris represent a collection of 'les vertus du dehors rassemblees dans un cercle pour niveler l'esprit public'. Jacques Guillaume Legrand, himself the first systematic theorist and historian of an eclecticism of types, recognized this quality in the barrieres: On voit que par le choix de ces formes consacrees dans Pantiquite, Parchi tecture moderne a su donner ? chacun de ces edifices le caractere monu? mentale qu'ils devaient porter, puisqu'ils faisaient partie des edifices publics d'une grande ville, et qu'un edifice public, on ne saurait trop de repeter, doit, pour le genre de sa construction et le caractere de sa forme differer essentiellement de la cabane du jardinier ou de la maison de Partisan, avec lesquelles on ne doit point les confondre.24 Legrand, in articulating the 'new genre' offered by the barrieres, points to the underlying justification in Ledoux's terms for these apparently whimsical melanges of classical and Palladian remini? scences. Not high architecture, in the traditional scheme of church and court, nor yet utilitarian architecture susceptible only to the calculations of an engineer, the barrieres were an intermediate, but public, subject. Modern cities demanded triumphal arches for symbolic grandeur, but with different functions that endowed them with fiscal rather than purely representational importance; their architecture could not imitate antiquity tout court. A new public genre, already assayed by Ledoux in the Saline de Chaux and at the prisons of Aix, would utilize the monumental signifi? cance of antique precedents, but dissociate their forms from previous uses. Classical types thus became reduced to signs of monumentality and antique allusion, entirely separated from the functions they earlier embodied, religious or secular. For Ledoux all history thereby manifests itself as pure rhetoric, and an arbitrary rhetoric at that; a collection of fragments referring no longer to any cultural or social institution, no longer, as it were, 'motivated' by their historical context or traditional meaning, but free to be deployed in shifting and transforming combinations, as the elements of a new monumentality. In this game of floating signifiers, the only unifying instrument was Ledoux's insistent abstraction, the geometrical simplification of forms and figures into primary shapes; in the same way as the 'temple' as type becomes quoted without its original referent, so 26 AA FILES 7</page><page sequence="14">the elements of architecture, columns, keystones, openings, arches, are changed into signs that, detached from traditional use or position, simply refer to architectural elements indiscrimi? nately. Thus 'keystones', abstracted and distorted in scale, migrate into pediments; capitals disappear to be replaced by rusti? cation, itself abstracted into a system of blocks. Here the ascription of 'modern' to Ledoux by Legrand seems correct; a reduced lexicon of elements, themselves abstracted in form from classical and Palladian precedents, once detached from their pre? vious positions, now at the disposition of an architect-inventor as a kit of signs that vaguely allude to a historical past or to an archi? tectural function, but which are readily forced into new signifi? cations by juxtaposition and transposition. A later commentator saw Ledoux as pre-eminently modernist in this procedure: Ledoux s'est, dit-on, ecarte du bon go?t, en ramenant l'art ? des formes qui s'ecartent le plus souvent de la severe simplicite des anciens. Nous convenons de ce fait qui d'ailleurs est d'une evidence frappante pour tous ceux qui ont etudie les monuments de la Grece et de Rome. Mais il faudra bien que Ton convienne avec nous que Ledoux qui recherchait principale ment I'effet sous le rapport de l'ordonnance, et la solidite sous celui de la construction, fut oblige de s'ecarter des principes recus par les anciens, premierement parce qu'ils n'offrent pas les ressources necessaires ? une imagination aussi active que la sienne, qui s'attachent particulierement ? la variete, secondement, parce que notre sol ne produisant point de materiaux d'une grandeur et d'une force egale ? celle des marbres que Ton tirait des carrieres et de la Grece et de ITtalie, il lui fallut chercher des formes, des lignes, des coupes nouvelles, pour obtenir avec les parties de petite dimension, et sans melange de fer, la solidite que les anciens obten aient avec des masses enormes. De l? vient que Ledoux rechercha les courbes de differentes especes qu'il parvint ? unir, quelque fois avec beaucoup de go?t, avec la ligne verticale et perpendiculaire de la colonne. Pour rendre justice ? Ledoux, on peut dire qu'il a donne ? ses formes memes l'empreinte d'un genie createur . . ,25 On another level, not readily apparent to observers until the publication of VArchitecture, this proliferation of types without significance, empty of previous uses, held within it the Utopian programme of Ledoux; these temples and public houses, villas and tombs, were, in this, idealized, sense, built as open types, not yet occupied by their future popular uses, not yet redefined by a new and more moral society, not yet appropriated by a perfected people. Architecture was here the avant-garde of Utopia; the buildings were already in place, it remained only for the society to realize the benefits of the new environment. A comparison of the designs for the barrieres with later Utopian projects for the city of Chaux reveals relationships not only on the level of style but also on that of type: the Bureau de la Poissoniere intimates the Maison de Madame des Modes; that of Sainte-Marie evokes the charcoal burner's hut; the Barriere du Courcelles seems to image the Bourse; the Bureau de la Rapee is a type of the market; that of the Chemin d'lvry seems to prefigure the House of the Forest Guards. A number of the barrieres allude to the different Maisons de Campagne designed as a series of Palladian transformations, notably the bureaux of Clichy, Amandiers, La Vilette, Reuilly and Chopinette. We would not be wrong in seeing these buildings as a kind of experimental laboratory of Utopian projects built with disregard for their mundane functions as toll-gates, and looking towards their future reinstatement as true monuments of an enlightened society. Certainly the designs for six enormous state-controlled guinguettes ? cabarets, restaurants and recrea? tion centres for the poor of Paris ? that would enable the govern? ment to take advantage of the receipts from trade in untaxed wine outside the barrieres hover between reality and Utopia in this way. The inn has now become a people's palace, 'pour la premiere fois on verra sur la meme echelle la magnificence de la guinguette et du palais'; the function is both economic and moralizing: Barriere de la Villette Photographs by James Austin.

Ledoux even extends his beneficence to the satisfaction of the entire gamut of desires as, in a wittily planned phallic maison ? plaisir, he transforms the hill of Montmartre into a gigantic machine ? plaisir. Architecture 'de-natured' From the beginning, architectural criticism of the barrieres had to wrestle with what was, for all intents and purposes, a funda? mental breach in the doctrine of decorum; in the attempt to develop a new genre of public architecture, Ledoux had invested a minor, utilitarian function with all the monumental dignity of high architecture. What in Ledoux's rhetorical transposition had elevated clerks' offices into the heirs of classical propylaea, thus making them into public art, had the effect of making an object of use monumental, or worse, making a monument useful. And Ledoux had not been content simply to apply the rules of traditional classicism for this task; he intentionally broke every one of them in the search of a new genre, on every level, from the typological references selected for the pavilions as a whole, to the individual elements and ornamental motifs. Not only did he refuse them the characteristics of triumphal arches ? the only classical precedents suitable for monumental gates; he also endowed each of them with a specific and different character, from temples to prisons. Dulaure noted, 'Ces bureaux, destines ? la perception des droits d'entree, doivent etre seulement simples, commodes et entierement depourvus de luxe qui seroit tres deplace et meme insultant; ils peuvent differer entre eux par leur grandeur, leur disposition interieure; mais ils doivent avoir tous le meme caractere, puisqu'ils ont tous le meme objet.'27 The strong? est and most perceptive critic of the toll-gates was Quatremere de Quincy, who immediately seized on their totally subversive nature, their propensity to explode all the controls of a classical aesthetic: in the first volume of his Encyclopedie methodique: Architecture, published a year before the Revolution, he returns again and again to the subject in articles on abus, bossages, and on the barrieres themselves. In the second volume he finishes his attack under the heading of dorique. In each article the barrieres are used as negative examples of an architecture that oversteps the limits, that demonstrates the abuse of license, the over-utilization of rustication, the wrong-headed 'invention' of new species of Doric order. Quatremere's argument is pitched on three levels: that of the social and political implications of the designs; that of their 'typo? logical' form; and that, most importantly of all, of their assault on every rule of order, proportion and syntax. Politically, the new bureaux des fermes represented for Quatremere a direct example of the extent to which works of art reflect intimately the manners, customs and morals of a people: following the maxim 'the arts are the most faithful mirror of the ideas of a people', he reasoned that the exaggerated and over-luxurious forms were explicable only in a country where the word 'barriere* had for so long been con? nected to the existing, half-ruined wooden palisades surrounding Paris. Compared to the gates of Greece and Rome, triumphal arches precisely suited to their dominant position in the city, or even to the gates of Louis XIV, Saint Antoine and Saint Denis, these new constructions violated all precedent and were thus to be seen as a reflection of the degraded taste of contemporary France. He cited Laugier, whose nostalgia for the Colbertian programme had caused him to call for entries to Paris, decorated with mag? nificence and grandeur: fewer and larger entries were called for, not the proliferation of sixty or so monuments, the smallest of which was more costly to build than the Porte Saint Denis. Se? cond, on the level of typology, Quatremere also agreed with Laugier in calling for triumphal arches: for Quatremere, the 'type' of the triumphal arch was the simple gate; between gate and arch there existed the same link as between cottage and palace, hut and temple, and, on a larger scale, building and architecture. Tombs, temples, prisons not only contravened the typical origin but also offended the propriety of tombs and temples themselves. A gate, after all, straddled a route, like the door to the city, 'announcing an entry', while Ledoux's barrieres, placed on either side of the road, 'indicate nothing': 'Une porte ou un arc in diquent et annoncent une entree; deux maisons situees des deux cotes d'une route n'indique rien; et les grilles qui leur devaient en defendre et en barrer les issues n'auraient ete qu'une supplement banal ? ce defaut.'28 These new 'monumens b?tards' will have the effect of turning away rather than welcoming the stranger. The 'nature' and the 'disposition' of the barrieres were thus improper. But Quatremere's most analytical comments were reserved for their 'architecture'. He admits the general validity of the public's astonishment at their novelty, their 'go?t de decoration etrange et insolite'; he even admires their imposing 'pyramidal' effect, their 'style large et grandiose', their character of strength and contrast. He even recognizes the power of Ledoux's use of 'la fiere austerite du plus male et du plus ancien des ordres grecs'. But beyond this, in detail, Quatremere sees only 'les puerilites des intentions mod ernes'. The hitherto unknown combinations, 'des colonnes appliques ? des genres de torture jusqu'alors inouis; des bossages effrayans heurter, en quelque sorte, tous les sens'. The identifica? tion of Ledoux in some sense as the Marquis de Sade of architec? ture, extending the laws of freedom en abtme, is, of course, cor? rect from the deliberate neo-classicist; the torture of architecture, or the dismembering of classicism, is in the barrieres manifested almost literally. Quatremere finds in each bureau 'licences' of every kind: arches inscribed within pediments, pediments without bases, abachi spanning two columns, freedom of rustication, couplings of columns, distortions of capitals, mouldings; false doors of every kind; 'des plans discordants, des elevations fantas tiques'.29 To such works, Quatremere applies the qualification bizarre: 'presque tous ces monumens paraissent un amalgames de toutes les bizarreries trouvees ou introuvees jusqu'? nos jours; un residu nouveau de combinaisons jusqu'alors impossibles'. The ascription bizarre holds a special place among Quatremere's nega? tive criteria; it is to be distinguished from the mere 'caprice', which implies the deliberate forgetting of rules, and from the simple 'folie' which is the result of madness, of an unknowing fault. The bizarre, on the other hand, is the result of reflection; 'il annonce un projet decide ? les meprises ou ? en faire nouvelles'. It is thus more serious than the caprice, which leads inevitably to? wards abus, and the folie, which produces only more folies: from bizarrerie springs only vices: par un melange inconnu de force et de faiblesse, de richesse et de pauv rete, de grandeur et de puerilite, de severite et de bizarrerie, de colossal et de mesquinerie, par la barbare union des principes les plus discordans et le plus antipathiques, ces edifices, pour la plupart, sont devenue des produits monstrueux, aussi etrangers ? l'architecture qui les desavoue, qu'injurieux au bon go?t qui doit se h?ter de les proscrire.31 28 AA FILES 7</page><page sequence="16">Quatremere has detected in Ledoux that 'sleep of reason', which will engender the genre of the monstrous and the romantic gro? tesque: it is as if Ledoux is seen literally dismembering the body of architecture, once united by its anthropomorphic relations, and playing a fantastic game of 'heads, bodies and legs', in order to produce some proto-Frankenstein monster. Here, of course, Quatremere's sensibility is that of a sculptor and idealist anti? quarian dedicated to restoring the broken body of classicism in its full glory ? theoretically through the ideal of type and practically through the piecing together of fragments. Yet Quatremere, precisely because of this intellectual project, is hesitant to proscribe Ledoux's efforts entirely, whether because invention is a force to be encouraged, or because he subscribes to the view that new conditions of life and art give rise to new re? sponses: 'Un nouveau genre de monumens a paru demander ? 1'architecture un nouveau genre de b?tir.' The fault perhaps is not so much in the initial premise as in the nature of the genetic type offered to the architect, for, 'quand le type ou l'idee premiere ne peut rien offrir de grand ? l'idee de l'artiste, il se trouve induit ? des bizarreries pour pouvoir cacher ou dissimuler le vice de son sujet'.32 From base originals, such as the old gates of the city, only base new products can be created. To the neo-classicist the barrieres were thus no more than mon? strous distortions, empty and ugly permutations, of the order of the monstrous, the grotesque, the caricature. Their relationship to an ideal architectural typology was that of an arbitrary neologism to a truly motivated language. Neither corresponding to an idea rooted in antique precedent, nor formulated according to any discernible new rule, they had no origins and no future. To the Romantics of the generation of Chateaubriand, or even of Hugo, they were equally alien, too far removed from a medieval or folk tradition to seem more than megalomaniacal ruins, giant follies of an ancien regime now fallen by its own folly. And if in this sense they might have participated in the fashion for the sublime, or even the cult of the fragment, they ? like the eccentric designs of Soane ? were finally too much identified with classicism and its attendant Utopias to be accepted. Deprived in their lifetime of the posthumous 'romantic' reputation accorded to Piranesi by the 'opium eaters' Coleridge and de Quincey, they only achieved the fame awaited by Ledoux when a sensibility forged out of mod? ernism's fractures and deconstructive criticism found in them the paradigms of an arbitrary and combinatory classicism en abime.
