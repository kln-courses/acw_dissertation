<plain_text><page sequence="1">Theodore Weiss Part 2: What's in a Name? The Rites and Wrongs of Poetry This is the second of a two-part essay. The first part appeared in the November/December iggg issue of APR. IV t Long before the Romantic poets, Shakespeare most effectively illustrated the pathetic fallacy's perti nence. And with the usually necessary convincing passion. In addition to his unequalled gifts, he was obviously at an advantage. A dramatist, he presents the thoughts and passions of characters, especially as they strive to confuse reality with?to shape it to?their desires. From the start he was concerned with the ways in which nature?human nature as well?affects the human state: the Ovidian trans formation men and women undergo through a change of place, a particular condition or season, or through a basic change of heart. At first, as in the early Comedy of Errors with its storm, its shipwreck, and then its mistaken outcry against magic or bewitchment, mere chance brings change about. Already, however, in this comedy, if only for moments, the magic or enchantment of love and feeling supplants chance and accident. Thereafter, whatever season, error, ghost, or witch may appear in Shakespeare's plays, it is the weather of the heart and its changes the characters must contend with: storms within, which counterpoint, as they help to produce, the tempests that batter many of the plays. But storms themselves in Shakespeare, most of all storms at sea, almost inevitably evoke the pa thetic fallacy. This instance of it must be among the oldest in human expression, so common, not to say "natural," we hardly notice it. Who balks at or feels uneasy before howling winds or the roar ing sea? Certainly such fallacy is to be expected in a small, sea-bound island like England. Thus Cas sio in Othello can say: Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds, The guttered rocks and congregated sands, Traitors ensteeped to enclog the guiltless keel, As having sense of beauty, do omit Their mortal natures, letting go safely by The divine Desdemona. This splendid bit of extravagance, mainly out of Cassio's youthful, ardent gallantry, is, customarily with Shakespeare, tempered by proper awareness, a "seems" or "as if" condition?that is, stormy seas "as having sense of beauty." But first they are "trai tors," "ensteeped" with passion "to enclog the guilt less keel." (The ship is also of pathos, if in reverse.) Ironically enough, whatever the effect of her beauty on nature, Desdemona will not be sufficiently di vine to change that ensteeped, human traitor Iago; on the contrary, her beauty and her innocence will mainly serve to goad his "mortal nature." Unlike the sea, he is indeed human so that, recognizing that beauty and purity, he must hate it for its lack in him, must prove it false, so destroy it. By prodigies like tempests Shakespeare also ex ploited the conviction, still intermittently alive in his time, that great figures, particularly kings, be ing divine, demonstrated the unity of the universe: through such figures what occurred in the body politic no less reverberated through the cosmic body. Shakespeare's Richard II perhaps best em bodies this attitude. In him Narcissus and Orpheus triumphantly, if disastrously, combine. The last of the medieval kings with unequivocal divine right, he believes, understandably more than anyone else, in his divinity. He assumes that his role and his rhetoric, like that of Orpheus, must move not only men but mountains. For is the earth not his? So he says: This earth shall have a feeling, and these stones Prove armed soldiers, ere her native king Shall falter under foul rebellion's arms. However, since he is lyrical and elegiac, rather than epical or fully dramatic (choosing speaking and acting over doing), one can be impressed by Richard's diverse roles, all under the sign of theater: playwright and producer, director, main character, chief audience. He indulges his own fitful moods to the neglect of his kingly duties. He enjoys his rhetoric more than his role (except as that role is powerfully theatrical, commanding a captive audi ence). Thus he looks increasingly to his deposition, a supreme source of material for his poetry. Young as Shakespeare still was at the time of his writing Richard II and still young to the theater and his art, in this play he celebrated his love for his medium. A swan song for the English Middle Ages, Shakespeare's elegy to it, that song in large measure is sung?in elegy for himself?by its very swan, Richard II. And given his nature, a long dy ing song it is. Accordingly, Shakespeare lingers over words and their power. The preciousness of one's own lan guage, one's native breath, is especially asserted by Mowbray on Richard's banishing him. He says: A dearer merit, not so deep a maim As to be cast forth in the common air, Have I deserved at your highness' hands! The language I have learnt these forty years, My native English, now I must forgo, And now my tongue's use is to me no more Than an unstringed viol or a harp . . . ; What is thy sentence then but speechless death, ) Which robs myltongue from breathing native breath? Nowhere else has Shakespeare written more ex uberantly about air become a humari necessity, most of all as it is shaped into the comely words of our native tongue. Love though we may the un common air of our own country, speech is, above all else, what we live on and in: our home-land. Richard, arbitrary as ever in his exercise of power, the power of the word, reduces Bolingbroke's ban ishment from ten years to six. And Bolingbroke exclaims: How long a time lies in a little word. Four lagging winters and four wanton springs End in a word?such is the breath of kings. But his father Gaunt rightly says of Richard: Shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow And pluck nights from me, but not lend a morrow; Thou canst help time to furrow me with age, But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage: Thy word is current with him for my death, But dead, thy kingdom cannot buy my breath. Such the limited powers of kings. Near his own death, Richard seems to relish most of all anticipating becomin g?what in this play he is?a legendary pathetic figure in a cosy story or his lasting, most essential self. With such self absorption, torn between thoughts of transcendent grandeur and self-pity he must inevitably rely on the pathetic fallacy. Bidding farewell to his queen, he falls into a rhapsodic vision: Think I am dead, and that even here thou tak'st, As from my death-bed, thy last living leave. In winter's tedious nights sit by the fire With good old folks, and let them tell thee tales Of woeful ages long ago betid; And ere thou bid goodnight, to quite their griefs, Tell thou the lamentable tale of me, And send the hearers weeping to their beds, For why, the senseless brands will sympathize The heavy accents of thy moving tongue, And in compassion weep the fire out; And some will mourn in ashes, some coal black, For the deposing of a rightful king. Fanciful and lingeringly self-luxuriating as this speech is, it fits Richard perfectly. As though, in ardent anticipation of his end, Narcissus were to deck himself in the flowers he soon will join. At the same time even here reality reinforces Richard's speech; in it the forces of nature as we normally know them are at work. Burning, branches do give off* sap or "weep" and they do crackle or "sympa thize." Furthermore, ashes and coal-blackness, however much they suggest a funeral (or however much nature, remembering a divine king, con tinues to mourn), naturally result from burning. Richard, to stress the wonder more, the unique ness of his story, reminds us that branches are nor mally senseless. Yet the tone of the atmosphere is quaint, snug, sweetly kind: that of a lamentable tale told by a lively fire. Fairies, to some degree still potent in Shake speare's time, supernatural, super-sensitive beings that they were supposed to be, at least to the folk, could also be expected to discern feelings in na ture. More than that, their conduct could affect it. The brawls between Oberon and Titania, she tells us, have upset nature itself. Yet, though the moon, the governess of floods, Pale in her anger, washes all the air, That rheumatic diseases do abound. for all the pale moon's grief and anger, such an en chanted realm is A Midsummer Night's Dream that its moon-coupled earth enables poetry on music and music itself to come into their mellifluous, se ductive own?the music of these two spheres drawn close enough to engage in a dewy, audible duet. Or earthling Bottom and moon-attended Ti tania cohabiting in one flower-bed. Thus Oberon can say to Puck: Thou rememb'rest Since once I sat upon a promontory And heard a mermaid, on a dolphin's back, Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath That the rude sea grew civil at her song, And certain stars shot madly from their spheres, To hear the sea-maid's music. This is enchanting, Orphic night music, appro priate to the King of the Fairies. But the later Des demona, we saw, though no mermaid, will also? at least, in another sympathetic character's eyes? have such super-powers. Taking as the mermaid's song is, the sea, usually rude or stormy, grows civil: mannerliness is established long as she sings. How ever, the song is so potent it also has the opposite effect: certain stars?perhaps brighter or more sen JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2000 39</page><page sequence="2">sitive than others?to hear her, shoot, and madly, from their customarily musical, orderly spheres. Omnivorous as Shakespeare's imagination was, it had to have it at least both, if not all, ways. And here, since he is dealing with a mermaid, he does not bother to correlate the magic with reality. Na ture, if only for a spell, is happily overturned. One might wonder whether, aside from its supreme eloquence, this image is so different from Pope's. But justice may be on Ruskin's side; for in Pope's case it was not the king of the fairies or even a sea-maid but a mere mortal poet holding forth about a mere shepherd girl. Nor, for that matter, can she begin to compete with the charms of a Des demona or a Cleopatra, a royal siren. The magic of a woman singing has often been poets' topic. I think of three poems that echo the mermaid's music. Wordsworth's "The Solitary Reaper" sings in a language he does not under stand (so a good part of its magic, its charm?), nonetheless, so potently that the song brims the valley in which she works to encompass lands as distant?even as it unites them?as Arabia and the farthest Hebrides. And then it sweeps over an cient times as well and, as the poet's song con cludes, into the far future of his memory. The per fumes of remotest space and time enrich her song as it engages and enlivens them. Wallace Stevens's "The Idea of Order at Key West," a much more elaborate lyric, complexly pon ders the place and the power of his woman's song. At first he stresses difference: "She sang beyond the genius of the sea." And the sea's motion made a "constant cry . . . that was not ours." He seems to be on Ruskin's side; the wave?even if a cry? is only sea water: "The water never formed to mind or voice." But the second stanza suggests, "It may be that in all her phrases stirred/ The grinding water and the gasping wind." It may be, even though "it was she and not the sea we heard." That sea "Was merely a place by which she walked to sing." And yet it was more than "only the dark voice of the sea" or "only the outer voice of sky/ And cloud." "More even than her voice, and ours, among/ The meaningless plungings of water and the wind." What is that "more"? All Stevens says is "It was her voice that made/ The sky acutest at its vanish ing./ She measured to the hour its solitude." For "She was the single artificer of the world." But even as this seems a strong statement for a woman-centered world, the line continues, "In which she sang." Nonetheless, "when she sang, the sea,/ Whatever self it had, became the self/ That was her song, for she was the maker." Thus we know "there never was a world for her/ Except the one she sang and, singing, made." Is this her ?or our?triumph and, at the same time, im prisoning tragedy? Even when the singing ended, it left its influence. Or is this what we do with na ture?: "The lights in the fishing boats ... Mastered the night and portioned out the sea,/ Fixing em blazoned zones and fiery poles,/ Arranging, deep ening, enchanting night." And all of it stems from our "Blessed rage for order .../ The maker's rage to order words of the sea/ ... And of ourselves and of our origins,/ In ghostlier demarcations, keener sounds." These sounds comprise our songs and poems. And they play their subtle, important part in our lives. Robert Frost took up this theme late in life with his "Never Again Would Birds' Song Be the Same." His customary canny New England sense, his ten tativeness, appears in the first verse: 'cHe would de clare and could himself believe" [my italics]. Lines later he says of Eve's voice, "Admittedly an elo quence so soft/ Could only have had an influence on birds," and not on larger creatures like man (ex cept as poet?) or nature itself. But now the die is cast and he does declare, "Be that as may be, she was in their song." And though he still hesitates with a "probably," he can conclude, "Moreover, her voice.../ Had now persisted in the woods so long/ That probably it never would be lost." The sonnet ends with a strong, ringing, rhyming couplet, "Never again would birds' song be the same./ And to do that to birds was why she came." Earlier, in "The Aim Was Song," Frost already urged a similar reason for our being here. "Before man came to blow it right/ The wind once blew it self untaught." Then "Man came to tell it what was wrong." And, finally, It was word and note, The wind the wind had meant to be? A little through the lips and throat. The aim was song?the wind could see. Shakespeare, we have seen, much anticipated such effects. In A Midsummer Night's Dream's neigh boring The Merchant of Venice, Lorenzo, like Oberon also praising music, its effect on wild colts, says of Ovid: Therefore the poet Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones, and floods; Since naught so stockish, hard, and full of rage But music for the time doth change his nature. Though he calls Ovid's notion feigning (he does admit the floods "full of rage"), he acknowledges music's influence on all, at least while it is sound ing. All, that is, but Shylock who, harder than the most impenetrable rock, is impervious to music as to any other appeal. Except for the comforting clink of coins. Shylock's opposites, the young Vene Carnegie Mellon University Press American Poetry: The Next Generation Edited by Gerald Costanzo and Jim Daniels A compilation of more than 160 poets under the age of 40 who have already published at least one book with a trade, university, or small press: Rick Agran, Elizabeth Alexander, Sherman Alexie, Rick Alley, Alice Anderson, Daniel Anderson, Aaron Anstett, David Baratier, Joshua Beckman, Erin Belieu, Dina Ben-Lev, Molly Bendall, Jacqueline Berger, Carole Bernstein, Mark Bibbins ...

So one says, "your ar gosies ... Do overpeer the petty traffickers/ That curtsy to them, do them reverence,/ As they fly by them with their woven wings." But here again na ture corroborates their rhetoric. Argosies or flag ships by their greater height do in fact peer over small vessels, which for the bobbing waves do seem to curtsy or bow to the former, as these with lofty sails like angelic wings speed by. More "pathetically," another friend, explaining Antonio's melancholy to him, can say that the threatening rocks, touching but my gentle vessel's side Would scatter all her spices on the stream, Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks. Yet his confidence is such that in very disaster the vessel partakes of her gentlemanly owner's quality. Thus the rocks (a rehearsal of what would happen should that rock Shylock "touch" gentle Antonio's side?), making the sea fragrant with the vessel's scattered spices, dress up the waves, for all their upheaval, in silks. And, briefly at least, they are contained. The sea itself becomes?not so much briny Poseidon?a resplendent young gal lant. Unless this is indeed Poseidon?a god has many guises?prinking himself up in human fur nishings and, whatever his basic nature, become civil or civilized. In later, tragic plays the drama often turns heart wrenchingly on the pathetic fallacy. The major figures assume that their feelings and nature's must be the same. They persist in this splendid folly until, for the course they pursue, the rock of reality, breaking through, wrecks them. A mighty, impassioned character like Othello, believing in nature's animism and its kindred feeling for him, can grandiosely say of Desdemona's sin: Heaven stops the nose at it, and the moon winks; The bawdy wind that kisses all it meets Is hushed within the hollow mine of earth And will not hear't. Lear, like Richard II, expects nature, no less than his subjects, to obey his commands and royally ap proves, "Blow winds, and crack your cheeks!" If such a king cannot call on the pathetic fallacy and make it work who can? But Lear finally learns that "the thunder would not peace at my bidding." Not all his profound anguish and rage, and not his tow ering regality, can waken nature to acknowledge his plight. The storm seems to be collateral, but it does little to comfort or assist him. On the con trary, his misuse of his power would seem to have loosed that storm or chaos in the world. For such a one, old and indurated to power, the failure of the pathetic fallacy or of his will is especially ago nizing. Yet the storm, echoing and equalling his own, is the purgation he must pass through to some peace and understanding. With Macbeth, given the witches and the con fusion between reality and hallucination, his mur derous actions let loose in his nature, the pathetic fallacy is inevitable. Macbeth himself observes, "Stones have been known to move and-trees to speak." Yet, ironically enough, his will clutching at the rational to reassure itself, he accepts an un natural or unrational counsel: the Third Appari tion's promise that Macbeth will not be vanquished till Birnam Wood advances on him. Forgetting his moving stones and speaking trees, he refuses to believe that the wood can be approaching. It is, in Shakespeare's mocking sense, possible; for the wood, only branches of it broken off, is used by the attacking troops to bear before them as camouflage. Nonetheless, fulfilling the prophecy, as if nature itself were indeed aroused by Macbeth's heinous deeds, the wood does move against him. Macbeth's refusal to obey what his instincts know?the inter play between, not to say the oneness of, man and nature?and his acting accordingly, serve to dra matize that knowledge. In a negative way, by his villainy he has disastrously tuned in on and proved the unity of the universe. Another wonderful instance of the pathetic fal lacy in action (that is, a description become active by its account of responses full of feeling) is the wind, reacting differently from Othello's, that en hances Antony and Cleopatra. It is a wind less lim ited in bawdiness. (Only Whitman, as far as I know, takes wind farther: itemizing the things he might worship, he says, "Winds whose soft-tickling gen itals rub against me it shall be you.") Northrop Frye in his Anatomy of Criticism main tains that "Ruskin's pathetic fallacy can hardly be a fallacy when a god is the hero of the action," es pecially a dying one. As we have seen in his inter pretation of the Greeks, Ruskin would, I believe, agree with this conclusion. But what if the figure involved is, not a god, but a god-like, heroic hu man? Magnificently human as Antony and Cleopa tra had been, by the time Shakespeare presented them, their humanness, underscored by their dy ing, enjoyed mythical, if not godly, status.

For her own person, It beggared all description: she did lie In her pavilion, cloth-of-gold of tissue, O'er picturing that Venus where we see The fancy outwork nature. The extravagance of Enobarbus is richly ironic. Yet in that extravagance, coming as it does from a veteran campaigner, one not normally taken in by such lavish lure, one also feels a degree of reality, a sense that Cleopatra was of the quality to encour age, if not exact, such extravagance. The very the atricality of the scene recommends its chief actress. Here a word on poetry and deconstruction might be in order. More than not deconstructionists, even as they derive from poets like Mallarme, have tended to shy away from poetry. And well they might since poetry has by many centuries antici pated their work?put it into superb practice. For poets, as we see in the above lines, delight in and encourage the deconstructive qualities of language; they exploit its resources to the full, its pluralistic life of referentiality and self-reflexiveness, its ap parent and actual contradictorinesses: the multiple pleasures it enjoys as it exercises all its multiquities and its own full private life. In short, one might be tempted to say that de construction is poetry for non-poets. For what is a poem, especially many modern ones, if not the fluidity of the text, the interweaving of all its ele ments and that interweaving going on, pressing on one set of threads, then another, meantime play ing among all of them? Certainly the deconstruc tionists have helped to intensify our sense of this condition: the electricity that generates as one ele ment?sound, letter, word?rubs up against an other and another. The very pleasure and richness of a text does in deed reside in the fact that it is not only one text but as many as there are readers and shifting moods inside each reader?or three hundred and thirteen ways of looking at a black word. And like Cleopatra the text waits to exert its spell, to release its charms by as much as its reader is capable of. Here Enobarbus is such a reader. One might say that the deconstructionists ac cepted the New Critical dictum that a poem is a self-sufficient, self-referential (reverential?) arti fact. In fact, for deconstructionists that is all poetry ?and language no less?is, with no hold on the world as it is. So we have moved from enthusiasm for E. M. Foster's "Only connect" to the present's contrary conviction, "Only disconnect." But Shakespeare is the great connector. And nowhere does he find a happier, more responsive, more fluid medium than the all-fertilizing Nile. That body of water, not soothed or made civil, rather becomes appropriately passionate in reflecting Cleopatra (as though the pool Narcissus looked into should, sighing, seethe for what it saw of it self in him!). But the water is "as though amorous"; its "following] faster" is justified by the oars which speed them up, but also suggests, in the beating and stroking, passionate play. (Close though this passage is to Plutarch, Shakespeare owes him none of its pathetic fallacies.) Finally, Enobarbus tells us that fancy (here imag ination) can surpass ("outwork") nature itself In a work of art (the work Cleopatra has already be come?at least in this description, which does in deed beggar all other descriptions; for is there not a suggestion that Cleopatra is herself a work of art, an endlessly working, responsive spider-web cloth of-gold of tissue?) Yet in his later The Winter's Tale Shakespeare, amending or at least qualifying this idea, gives us his last word on art versus nature. Perdita tells Polixenes: For I have heard it said. There is an art, which in their piedness [flowers] share With great creating Nature. Polixenes replies: Say there be; Yet Nature is made better by no mean But Nature makes that mean; so over that art Which you say adds to Nature, is an art That Nature makes. .This is an art Which does mend Nature, change it rather; but The art itself is Nature. In short, whatever we do, since we are children of nature, is natural. Nature itself providing the means by which we seem to better it, the unity is not broken; on the contrary. The barge scene's pathetic fallacies, whatever their extravagance, are still mainly qualified by "as" or "seems." But the ultimately audacious fallacy occurs when Enobarbus says that, for the barge's "strange invisible perfume," the very air "But for vacancy/ Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,/ And made a gap in nature." This air, good-natured Alexandrian that it is, though attracted by Cleo patra's perfume, apparently shares the Alexandrian horror of vacuity. So it resists the final step of the pathetic fallacy. It is hardly surprising that the breather Anthony, wholly alive beside the statues the other Romans are, a man pre-eminently of the senses and the in stincts, should find the wholly supple, wholly un predictable Cleopatra irresistible, more winsome than all worldly power. As the Old Testament opens with a gust of God blown lustily into the lungs of man, so Shakespeare always inclines to the deep breathers. Imagine such ample lungs filled with Cleopatra's insinuating fragrance! Not satisfied with the stirring performance Cleopatra presents while reclining, Enobarbus offers her much more dramatically and in an act that must seem to demean her: ! saw her once Hop forty paces through the public street; And having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted, That she did make defect perfection, And, breathless, pow'r breathe forth. So alive is she "vilest things/ Become themselves in her, that the holy priests/ Bless her when she is riggish." For a being unique as Cleopatra all acts are becoming. But to The Tempest we must go for the most strik ing use of the pathetic fallacy. Here it serves to high light Shakespeare's interest in the power of the poet (sometimes cast as no more?and no less? than a clown or a jester) as contrasted with that of a king. He had already told us that Richard II en joyed at best negative power. However, through his story he does outlive his own short span. Ironically enough, his engrossment in words to the oblivion of reasonable deeds, even as it cut his kingly career short, ensured him a poetic immortality And of course, though Richard and all the other kings and queens disappeared into the past (ex cept as Shakespeare redeemed them), over the cen 42 THE AMERICAN POETRY REVIEW</page><page sequence="5">turies Shakespeare's reign has extended far and wide. In some ways he is livelier, deeper, more mov ing than ever. Yet we may suspect that, to some de gree at least, Shakespeare resented the peremp tory power of kings. He himself was at best no Orpheus, merely the king of poets, able, whatever his influence on his sovereigns' thoughts and feel ings, to detain them but briefly. However, as though in response to regal power, The Tempest does show what art, words, music can do to and with nature, and man as well. The play opens with a tempest so full-blown that the boatswain, questioned by the royal party and urged to be patient; exclaims, "When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers for the name of King?" Tauntingly he continues, "If you can command these elements to silence and work the peace of the present, we will not hand a rope more." Or try to make this rude sea civil! The double irony here is that this tempest is in deed a man-prompted, man-managed one, but only ?like the play itself?a magnificent make-believe, put on by a duke, if a usurped, exiled one. And at that put on, not by his regal powers, but through the magic he has derived from his books for which he l?st his dukedom. (He tells Miranda that he owns "volumes that/ I prize above my kingdom.") Through books Prospero does command the ele ments to speech or silence. What not even Cleopa tra's charms could do?persuade the air to make a gap in nature?Prosperous can. At least in an il lusory?theatrical?way he has attained the mas tery of Orpheus and the mermaid. Still, even with his magic, he is not impervious or superior to the elements, and not self-sufficient. He needs the unruly Caliban, and recalcitrant Ariel as well, to perform domestic chores for him. That fact should tell us something crucial about Pros pero's powers. And yet he does manage to get Ariel and Caliban to work for him. When he recalls for Miranda his and her banishment and their being set adrift, he says: There they hoist us To cry to th' sea that roared to us; to sigh To the winds, whose pity, sighing back again, Did us but loving wrong. Prospero had not yet mastered his magic. Nor was there god, Poseidon or Aeolus, for Prospero to appeal to. Still the winds would already seem on the way to being Ariel-like, even more so since they sigh, pityingly, back to Prospero and Miranda; and though they do the pair wrong, it is wrong with love, wrong only out of their emphatic love-sighing. But Ariel it is that gives the pathetic fallacy es pecial eclat. An element become a speaking, re sponsive creature is already pathetic fallacy enough. Here at last Shakespeare's career-long concern with air in its diverse manifestations, its gamut from storm to speech and poetry to music, comes to a deliciously embodied climax. Ariel's chores?rang ing from performing a tempest to being music? now done, he reports to Prospero: "Your charm so strongly works 'em,/ That if you now beheld them, your affections/ Would become tender." And he confesses, "Mine would, sir, were I human." Here we have the pathetic fallacy?almost?denying it self, yet also confirming itself. Prospero, under standably moved, replies: Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling Of their afflictions, and shall not myself One of their kind, that relish all as sharply, Passion as they be kindlier moved than thou art? Nature, not human, therefore not able to respond in our fashion, does instruct us, does impress on us, in and by affliction and delight, our kindship, our oneness through feeling, with all the race. With feeling fulfilled in The Tempest, the time has come to break the spell. Our stay on the en chanted island is over; we must return to the state and estate of man alone. Nonetheless, though Pros pero admits that The Tempest is no more than illu sion or play, in his epilogue he is Prospero still, not merely as in other Shakespearean epilogues an actor about to give over his role. And still in the world of the play, as though it were the real world after all, or at least no less real than "the great globe itself" which "shall dissolve." Prospero/Shake speare, having raised the theater to the world, can consider the world a theater. The tempest was an illusion, yet worked on its victims as effectively as reality itself; so at the end we, the audience, must admit the reality of the play's art that has worked on us. In short, the poet is at least as real as a king. And a text, language, poetry, as real as anything else, may well be more lastingly telling than some of the more important so-called real occasions of our lives. V In recent times the pathetic fallacy's appeal seems to have fallen off. An inclining to the colloquial, if not to the literal, the prosaic, and the common place, consonant with our rapidly descending democracy, as well as the always growing author ity of science, may be chiefly responsible. But also, as I noticed earlier, given our basicly skeptical age, doubts have accumulated about language itself, its unbridgeable distance from the world it claims to describe. At the same time writers have increasingly called on us to respect the other and the others. Williams, Pound, the objectivists so called, Olson and many more have insisted on the uniqueness and the rights of each creature, large and small, and even each thing. It is, as well as physical ecology, a spir itual one and a complete equality these poets have been after. Not only should all things be let be as they are, but their natures should be given full voice. If the center of the universe is lost to us, at least we can be released to a mighty company and as an equal among equals. Some poets, going even farther, considering crea tures and things superior in many ways to us, have envied them their imperviousness to our kinds of fears, follies, suffering and hopes. Objects?a rock, a tree?we can especially prize for their objective state as a kind of anchor, a sanity in the midst of our turmoil. That is, if we do not consider them scientifically: then, like us, they become events, whirling configurations of atoms or flashing lights. Each thing is revealed for the intense, volcanic drama it is, as magical as one could wish. Among modem poets concerned with things and the thing itself, Stevens stands out for his life-long preoccupation with nature versus man, particu larly man's imagination. One might say that he took up where the nineteenth-century poets left off. In his writing career he veered from empha sis on one to the other. Usually, however, giving the edge to nature or reality, he little questioned man's and nature's interdependence. Like Ruskin he also flirted with fact, a world in which "the final poem will be the poem of fact in the language of fact." However, he does not leave it there: "But it Story Line Press Grace by John Barr $14.95-paper 324,95 - cloth 'You have ti^yer rea?|i|t^^^gi[iMvthis [Barr's]ambiti!^^ writers and readers north WcNjj Panama Canal." ?Ricjc Moody PUBLISH YOUR BOOK!

JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2000 43</page><page sequence="6">will be the poem of fact not realized before." Beyond all our supreme fictions we might finally arrive at "the the." "In a Bad Time" Stevens says: But the beggar gazes on calamity And thereafter he belongs to it, to bread Hard found, and water tasting of misery. Stevens realized how much our feelings color, even infect, our sense of reality, though reality in the form of disasters or calamity prompts those feelings. Poverty, misery, we have discovered them, made mighty kingdoms of them. In turn, they, as well as joy and gaiety, have helped us as their sub jects discover who and what we are. To a marked degree our nature obliges us to see the world in our own image. Narcissus cannot be completely drowned, not even in the icy waters of fact. Yet Stevens did long for the thing itself, the sun as it is, naked of our barnacling images. (So simi larly Hopkins's revulsion before man's smudge and man's smell.) However, Stevens understood that "this effect is a consequence of the way/ We feel and, therefore, is not real, except/ In our sense of it." At least Stevens also rooted his trust in feel ing or, rather, in the way we feel, in our senses and our sense of things: "sense exceeds all metaphor." But even sense and the senses may be too much, too overlaying. Especially as they make their in evitable way into speech. Stevens's "Less and Less Human, O Savage Spirit" can say: If there must be a god in the house ... Let him move as the sunlight moves on the floor, . . . incapable of speaking, closed, It is the human that is the alien, The human that has no cousin in the moon. It is the human that demands his speech From beasts or from the incommunicable mass. If there must be a god in the house, let him be one That will not hear us when we speak: a coolness, A vermilioned nothingness, any stick of the mass Of which we are too distantly a part. Here Stevens sounds as though he regrets and disparages man's difference from the rest of cre ation; man alone in his humanness is the alien be cause he demands his own speech (not theirs) from beasts and the incommunicable mass. Yet Stevens would seem to want to keep things as they are; let us not gain god's or nature's attention, at least not since we are?or as long as we are?"too distantly a part." Actually here Stevens seems not too far from the staunchest critic of the pathetic fallacy, poetry, the imagination. The human race at best only remotely relates to the other. Yet, by Stevens's lights, so our relation had better be. Is this our paramount hope, that we not overrun nature and reality? That reality preserve itself, intact against our requests, clamorings, blandishments? Now our language may well be no more than a casting of our image and our images upon the world; yet that this language works and we under stand each other at all surely proves its immense, relevant worth. Moreover, as we test that language against our experience, some writers' work seems to be borne out much more convincingly than oth ers'?additional evidence, one might conclude, of language's reality at least for us. If writers are as much written as they are writing (reminiscent of the old notion of the muse, inspiration, etc.), can 22nd ANNUAL FESTIVAL OF POETRY July 30 - August 5, 2000 at the Frost Place Franconia, New Hampshire "There is no other poetic institution in the United States that feels more consecrated to the poem itself."?Donald Hall 2000 Resident Poet is Mark Cox.

And if the race's arts, poetries, languages are merely an invention, an imaginary game, what a magnificent, amazing game that race has been playing. In his "Author's Preface" to Aids to Reflec tion Coleridge said, "if words are not things, they are living powers, by which the things of most importance to mankind are actuated, combined, and humanized." The great poet impresses us by his simultaneously exercising to the full both sides of language: its autotelic character and its resolute grappling with the world, one side strengthening and realizing the other. Like Prospero at the end of The Tempest, aban doning his magic and his island, many modern poets have sought to eschew rhetoric and most po etic devices. For an example of a resolve to live with the bare hands of poetry, one can hardly do better than William Carlos Williams, in say a poem like "Young Sycamore": I must tell you this young tree whose round and firm trunk between the wet pavement and the gutter (where water is trickling) rises bodily into the air with one unduiant thrust half its height? and then dividing and waning sending out young branches on all sides? hung with cocoons it thins till nothing is left of it but two eccentric knotted twigs bending forward hornlike at the top Williams "tells" us the tree (and tells it by what he tells us about it). Thus Williams's poem is, like his sycamore, one unbroken statement (if, unlike the tree, the poem proceeds down, not up, the page; perhaps he should have tried telling the tree from the bottom of the page upward?), with little inter rupting punctuation and, since going on, no pe riod. Syntax with its subordinations and all the rest is maintained. But that might be construed to re produce the internal structure of the tree. Williams claimed "A word is a word most when it is separated out by science, treated with acid to remove the smudges." Aside from his praiseworthy wish to cleanse language of the accumulated sludge of its day and of earlier times, Williams had, it would seem, little sympathy for those who love words because they come to us multi-layered, sea soned, travel-spiced like Othello, the scents and sounds of distant countries, ages, adventures streaming out of commodious sleeves. (One might question whether Williams's adjec tives like "round" and "firm" are scientific and to be found in nature or the nature of the tree. And even he cannot resist metaphor altogether, a little sneaky one, at the poem's end, with ambiguity in being either a horn as on an animal or a musical instrument poet-wise singing itself out.) All his life an imagist and objectivist, Williams was wary of connotation, ambiguity, the vagueness of suggestion the symbolists loved language for. Scientifically trained, Williams lauded objectivity. So his most famous slogan was "No ideas but in 44 THE AMERICAN POETRY REVIEW</page><page sequence="7">things" or "the thing itself." Pound also, with his anti-self-consciousness, his sense of the bottom less (nonetheless shallow!) abyss self-absorption can easily become, opposed imagism to the culti vated indirection of symbolism. He and Williams sought to restore immediacy and accuracy to poetry, strove to make the universe and the mind; object and subject, one again. Of course, such an attitude leaves little room for the great cerebral poets like Lucretius, Dante, Donne. For Lucretius the world was a marvelously diversified One, a uni-verse; with everything?feel ings, stars, dreams, thoughts, wishes, gods, hippo potamuses, etc.?composed of atoms, so basically the same there could be no divisiveness in his world. Even the most subjective is objective. Dante, with the Christian system still viable, except for a repair job here and there, could believe that he could write a poem that would accommodate the whole world. But for Donne, despite his immense mentality, his thinking at his fingertips, the world was already falling apart. He says: And new Philosophy [science] calls all in doubt, The element of fire is quite put out; The Sun is lost, and th'earth, and no mans wit Can well direct him where to looke for it. . . . Tis all in peeces, all cohaerence gone; ... Once, talking with Williams, I mentioned Eliot's "dissociation of sensibility." Williams shrugged, then smiling, shrewdly said, "That never bothered me. I guess I was too dumb. I simply went under it." Through "Young Sycamore," its words would-be correspondents of the tree, we enjoy a kinesthetic experience of its urgent upward thrust, its complex expressiveness. In Pound's words by way of Fenol losa, "The cherry tree is all it does." To participate in the tree's process, its being that is all energetic becoming, we must surrender the self. Instead of losing ourselves as Narcissus did into a flower, we find ourselves by concentrating on and identifying with that flower. Perhaps, after all, Williams's atti tude was not as different from Eliot's, with his the ory of impersonality, as Williams liked and needed to believe. And whatever Williams's and Pound's hardheadedness, certainly Pound had a soft spot for the Greek gods, as Williams did for satyrs and nymphs. But at least these latter were, however mythical, tangible, earthy, "natural" creatures. It is interesting and possibly revealing that, in all this talk about trees, it is thought appropriate for a poet to compare men with leaves (see Homer's and the Bible's generations of men like leaves), but a mistake to compare leaves with men. In Ruskin's words: when Dante describes the spirits falling from the bank of Acheron "as dead leaves flutter from a bough," he gives the most perfect image possible of their utter lightness, feebleness, passiveness, and scattering agony of despair, without, how ever, for an instant losing his own clear percep tion that these are souls, and those are leaves; he makes no confusion of one with the other. But when Coleridge speaks of "The one red leaf, the last of its clan, That dances as often as dance it can," he has a morbid, that is to say, a so far false, idea about the leaf; he fancies a life in it, and will, which there are not; confuses its powerlessness with choice, its fading death with merriment, and the wind that shakes it with music. But Ruskin admits "Here, however, there is some beauty, even in the morbid passage." However much Ruskin finds in Dante's image, one might suggest that he is a bit excessive in his finding mer riment and music in Coleridge's image. Is it not rather the hectic (even to the color), mad dance of death? Williams could aver, "I feel as much a part of things as trees and stones." In Discovery of the Mind Bruno Snell, examining Homer's similes, says: They constitute his only mechanism of describ ing the essence or the intensity of an event. In one simile Hector strives to break through the ranks of the Greek warriors. "But he was unable to disrupt the line.. .for they endured (ischon) ... just as a rock in the sea endures (menei) despite wind and waves." Relevant as SnelFs comments are I quote him at length: the art of the Homeric simile often consists in the wealth of correlations, in the beauty of and the aptness of its less obvious and more remote im plications. But this does not contradict the fun damental rule that the story?in this case a hu man action?required the comparison to achieve full expression. If the rock contributes to the understanding of a human attitude, i.e. if a dead object elucidates animal behaviour, the reason is that the inani mate object is itself viewed anthropomorphically [my italics]; the immobility of the boulder in the surf is interpreted as endurance, as a human be ing endures in the midst of a threatening situa tion. It appears, therefore, that one object is ca pable of casting fresh light upon another in the form of a simile, only because we read into the object the very qualities which it in turn illustrates. This peculiar situation, namely that human be haviour is made clear only through reference to something else which is in turn explained by anal ogy with human behaviour, pertains to all Homeric similes. More than that, it pertains to all genuine metaphors, and in fact to every single case of hu man comprehension. Thus it is not quite correct to say that the rock is viewed anthropomorphi cally, unless we add that our understanding of the rock is anthropomorphic for the same reason that we are able to look at ourselves petromorphically, and the act of regarding the rock in human terms furnishes us with a means of apprehending and defining our own behaviour. In other words, and this is all-important in any explanation of the sim ile, man must listen to an echo of himself before he may hear or know himself. Aside from the fact that there are rocks and trees in us (are we not composed of the same materi als?), we must go in to go out and to find ourselves in the world. Freud in his essay "On Narcissus: an Introduction" (1914) remarks: a certain reciprocity between ego-libido and ob ject-libido. The more that is absorbed by the one, the more impoverished does the other become. The highest form of development of which ob ject-libido is capable is seen in the state of being in love, when the subject seems to yield up his whole personality in favor of object-cathexis. Orpheus through his music moved trees and stones; but Williams, through his music and his sense of the uniqueness of each thing, was moved by trees and stones to become as one with them. And yet is not Williams's impulse, in its need for words and in its very desire to identify, touch ingly, uniquely human, so a kind of pathetic fallacy? As far as I can tell, no stone, no tree, feels itself a part of things or longs to yield up its personality to become another stone or tree, let alone a human being. Surely they do not need to translate that im pulse into words or a poem. They do not need to because, as Wald said, we are "the star's way of knowing about stars," and the stone's and tree's, as well. Nevertheless, trees shoot forth leaves and fruit as we utter words. But differences promptly even "The staff, faculty and peer writers were all first rate. I came to Kenyon with the intent of stretching and growing and left having exceeded my expectations.

Unless one believes by way of breezes in poplar and maple talk, leaves do not utter more than themselves or, were our ears acute enough, a sound in and out of the wind that "tells" us what kind of tree it is. And we, even as we utter words, are not blossoming into opaque, tangible, living and so dying objects, ("O, no?" someone retorts. "What are speeches, poems?") Rather, beyond themselves, our words have meanings, diverse con notations; but that is their liveliness. It is this on going life of words and the changing life among them that comprise both their delight and their trouble. An interviewer, in Paterson, Book Five, asks Wil liams about one of his poems, "Aren't we supposed to understand it?" Williams replies, "There is a difference of poetry and the sense. Sometimes mod ern poets ignore sense completely. That's what makes some of the difficulty." Finally, to the in terviewer's "But shouldn't a word mean something when you see it?" Williams admits, "In prose, m English a word means what it says. In poetry, you're listening to two things ... the sense, the common sense of what it says. But it says more. That is the difficulty." Poets vacillate from one extreme to the other. They yearn, on the one hand, as did Whit man, to be wholly denotative: so his directive to himself that his language be pure plate-glass trans parency. And, on the other, as with Mallarme, to be wholly connotative: words and poems, not only self-absorbed, but self-reflexive, independent (yes, opaque) affairs. Such is the idolatry the word and art are liable to. Since language constitutes the ambience, the living air, of our human world, it can absorb us and block out nature. Either that or some of us would convert the natural world itself into the hu man one altogether?into chairs, cars, planes, houses, public buildings, things. Erich Heller, dis cussing Hegel , speaks of "the ambition of the hu man m ind to dominate reality to the point of usurp ing its place." So Rilke would interiorize or transform the world. As he wrote to his Polish translator on The Duino Elegies: our task is to stamp this provisional, perishing earth into ourseives so deeply so painfully and passionately, that its being may rise again, "in visibly/' in US. WE ARE THE BEES OF THE INVISIBLE. Still, remarking the distinction between words and the world , I think of the idea that plants re spond to talk, to kindness. So several scientists have discovered or at least proposed that trees com municate chemically?that is, pass chemical clues, including warnings, to kindred trees. But poplars, apparently, talk only to poplars; oaks and sycamores cannot understand them. Thus it would seem that trees have their own dialects. Is this mere anthro pomorphism, a succumbing to the pathetic fallacy? Or are these scientists belatedly getting on to what poets have long felt?a unity, a sentience, through out the universe? Epilogue Certain modern poets, like Williams and Rilke, able to identify with other creatures and things and striving to draw their words and the world closer together, seem to have been on the way to dealing with the fundamental dilemma that is dualism. But, whatever Rilke's success, an encounter of his ?this time not with the principal psychoanalyst, but with a soverign poet?suggests something of our persistent problem. Rilke, a good modern man, was proud of not hav ing read this and that, not least of all Shakespeare. His publisher Kippenberger persuaded him to try The Tempest. The result was one of Rilke's most striking poems, "The Spirit Ariel," written early in 1913, probably before his "You from the Outset." "The Spirit Ariel" amounts to a superb report of what happened when the greatest hothouse poet collided with the greatest poet-at-large. The poem expresses Rilke's understandable astonishment and dismay that Prospero should dare to throw away his' hardwon, greatest gift, Ariel or his art, and willingly become "powerless, aging, poor." This even though he will be a duke again. in a burst of feelingful insight, a kind of revela tion, Rilke confesses: Now he terrifies me, this man again become a Duke. How he draws the wire into his head and hangs himseif among the other puppets. And henceforth begs mercy of the play. . . . What epilogue of consummated mastery. Putting aside, standing there with only one's own strength "Which is most faint." Rilke had glanced at Shakespeare before, and known a related terror. He wrote in a letter, "for me he is too much of a mountain, too steep, too amorphous; I clamber and slip and never know just what is happening to me." Such response from one of our subtlest poets! Here, however, in "The Spirit Ariel" Rilke, break ing open past even his extraordinary capacity, must awedly acknowledge a poet far more audacious or secure in his gifts than he. One so attuned to, so realized in, the world that he can even give up his poetry and, no longer needing to impose himself Prospero-wise on the world, let it be. Let himself be a naked, weak creature at the mercy, like the other "puppets," of the play the play that is reality or the destructive element?but also the lifegiving one?submerging us all. Whatever pun in "consummated mastery," a mas tery now consumed or over, as well as a mastery now wholly realized, the epilogue is little different, Rilke understands, from the play that went before. Prospero has willingly yielded to that very nature and its changes, drastic and otherwise, that Rilke recoils from in Freud 's report of him. As even Or pheus ?s life indicated, we cannot expect?dream sublime that: it is?to live at poetic heights more than intermittently. But then do we have to reject art for its mo rn entariness and submit to silence, or at least dairi ness, our becoming anonymously one with the mass of the world? Or does Prospero's insistence at the end of The Tempest that he is, whatever the faintness of his own strength, Prospero still , pro pose an acceptance of our natures and our lan guage, with us still capable of an occasional gleam, even if it cannot be willed into being or long sus tained? In short, an acceptance of things as they are, resembling Freud's in his "On Transience." Or rather something like the Homeric beyond hope and fear. Yet hope and fear also as intrinsic parts of the whole human experience. In his "Autobiographical Notes" Einstein explains why he turned to science: It is quite clear to me that the religious paradise of youth ... was a first attempt to free myself from the chains of the "merely personal," from an ex istence which is dominated by wishes, hopes and primitive feelings. Out yonder there was this huge world, which exists independently of us as human beings and which stands before us like a great eternal riddle, at least partially accessible to our inspection and thinking. The contemplation of this world beckoned like a liberation,... The road to this paradise was not as comfortable and al luring as the road to the religious paradise, but it has proved as trustworthy, and I have never re gretted having chosen it. Never except perhaps after the making of the atom bomb: "I should have been a plumber." Great art (though Einstein does not include it with reli gion and science) also occupies itself with contem plation of this world, But so far we have not, thank goodness, learned how to connect works of art, even Tk? Iliad, with sockets so as to produce a nu clear explosion. Einstein's notes reflect on the wisdom of ab sorption in something larger and more abiding than oneself (even in a universe made of change). We are close to Ruskin here. Einstein's position is most attractive, not least against the recent poetry of often petty self-absorption. Submission to the "merely personal," to the tyranny of "wishes, hopes and primitive feelings," can come to little more than the life of a frantic shuttlecock. But art differs basically from science in its ca pacity?in its passion?for human qualities, feel ings, thoughts. As it delights in minute particu lars and the uniqueness of each thing, rather than the underlying general alone, art at its best loves what it sees and feels too much to abstract or re duce it. Thus even though we applaud Einstein's position, we may question his dismissal of wishes, hopes, and feelings primitive and otherwise. Cer tainly we should strive to escape their domination. Yet their essential importance to us as men and women responding to the huge world, their being in good measure the mark and distinction of our being human, means that they deserve our best at tention. Comprising a very considerable part of poetry's subject matter, they help to make us hu man and to deepen our sense of ourselves and the universe. One might wonder whether Einstein's contem plation, his desire to understand the world, was not prompted, in good part, by hopes and wishes. The whole man is one who lives his life as fully as possible on all sides. Whether one is a scientist or a poet, at best that person is, rather than Narcissus or even Orpheus, something like Odysseus who, after all his travels and adventures, realized that his own world, his own life, and his own mother wit as a human being suited him. Usually that wit, coupled with his gusto, his avid curiosity for the world, his adroitness, and his immense story-telling powers, served him adequately. Human being that he was, he was made to live and to live well under most conditions. With or without the gods we have, in nature and our complement of feelings, thoughts, imagina tion,, the wherewithal to live and to live, at least now and then, triumphantly. Whatever little mercy the play we're submerged in at times seems to ac cord us, we need to remember that it gave us our lives and our roles in the first place. As Williams said, "How foolish to seek new worlds . . , when we must know that any world, warmed by the arts, will surpass the very Elysian Fields if the imagi nation reaches its end there." &lt; Theodore Weiss has co-edited the Quarterly Review of Literature for more than fifty years.
