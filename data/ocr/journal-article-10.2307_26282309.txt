<plain_text><page sequence="1">READING BETWEEN THE LINES AND THE SQUARES frfr David I. Sheidlower We enter into the world of Bend Sinister through an oblong look ing glass. It is a world that mirrors life, but this reflection we've entered, this insomniac's nightmare, itself is reflected in Nabokov's mir ror, a glass silvered with the artist's imagination. The reflection is as complex as if the mirror itself were shattered; but it is not. Bend Sinister is a novel in which Vladimir Vladimirovich Nabokov has placed a great man in a country ruled by a toad, has gone on to realize the tragi-comic possibilities of this situation, and, at the same time, has treated us to a narrative that, by virtue of its many textures, is beauti fully intricate. One of the most interesting of these textures relates not only to the novel, but to a few puzzling details in both Nabokov's auto biography, Speak, Memory, and his collection entitled Poems and Prob lems. The idea of texture is expressed by John Shade in this often quoted passage from his poem Pale Fire: Just this: not text, but texture; not the dream But topsy-turvical coincidence, Not flimsy nonsense, but a web of sense.1 ■Vladimir Nabokov, Pale Fire (New York: Berkeley Publishing, 1968), p. 44. Henceforth, refer 413</page><page sequence="2">A literary texture can be described as a complex of aesthetic devices which are connected thematically. Since these devices are thematically connected, they are thematically justified and relevant. An example of a texture is the complex of sexual images and allusions which Humbert Humbert uses to describe so many things. Another example is mirrors and their effects in the novel Pale Fire. Nabokov's characters usually do not notice the textures in their worlds, but the careful reader does. Nabokov insisted on being completely conscious of the textures he wove into his novels, and he considered them an important part of his works; therefore, to discover the textures in a Nabokov novel and to try to justify the novel's aesthetics is to approach an understanding of how the novel was created and the author's ideas about the novel while he was creating it. In Bend Sinister, one of the most important and, as is typical of Nabokov, most obscure textures is derived from a chess problem which Nabokov himself composed. This problem and its relation to Nabokov explains the origin of the oblong puddle in Bend Sinister and why that puddle is the breeding place for the novel's plot. It also explains the ap pearance of chess, Hamlet, and King Lear in the novel, the title of the novel itself, the puzzling last sentence of Speak, Memory s fourteenth chapter, and a blatant inconsistency in Poems and Problems. Nabokov chose to use chess terminology three times in Bend Sinis ter. The first time is in chapter two when "a lantern moved, knight-wise to check him [Krug]" (BS, p. 6). In chapter six, Nabokov uses this metaphor: "just as a cooked chess problem can be cured by the addition of a passive pawn" (BS, p. 74); and chess appears again in chapter six, when Krug explains to Maximov: "the only move I care to make is to rook my king the long side" (BS, p. 80). Given these three lines and Nabokov's passion for chess problems, it is reasonable to suspect that the lines are clues to a texture which is related to chess problems. If such a texture exists, then its details are certainly not very obvious. For such a texture to exist, it is imperative that there be "pieces" or their equivalent within Bend Sinister. That the main character of Bend Sinister, Adam Krug, and his enemy, Paduk, are the opposing kings seems obvious. But of course there is more evidence than just seeming. In chapter six, Paduk is referred to as a "swollen Tyrannosaurus" (BS, p. 85). Tyrannosaurus refers to a genus ences to PF will be given in the text by title letters and page numbers. The other Nabokov works quoted in this essay are indicated parenthetically by title letters and page numbers directly following quotations: Bend Sinister (New York: Time, Inc., 1964), Pnin (Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1957), Speak, Memory (New York: Putnam's, 1966), Poems and Problems (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1972), and Strong Opinions (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1973). 414 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="3">of dinosaur and the word is derived from the Latin tyrannus, which means an absolute ruler and can also mean a usurper.2 By referring to Paduk by a genus, Nabokov denies him individuality; he identifies Paduk as one of many. Nabokov does this again in the brief introduc tion to his story "Tyrants Destroyed," grouping him with the tyrant of that story, Lenin, Stalin, and Hitler. (It is noteworthy that both Paduk and the tyrant in "Tyrants Destroyed" have the curious habit of biting their nails and that when, in chapter eleven of Bend Sinister, a morti cian is called in to beautify Paduk, the result is a description of the tyrant in "Tyrants Destroyed.") Within their genus, animals are broken down into species. The most common species of the genus Tyranno saurus is rex. Rex is Latin for king and is a chess term used to describe that piece. Just as Paduk can be seen as one of many —and indeed this is the appeal of Paduk and Ekwilism to loyal members of the new regime, as illustrated by Paduk's use of Etermon (BS, p. 69) —Krug is in all respects an individual, to use a chess term that Nabokov was fond of, a solus rex.3 The adjective "swollen" is also revealing; the one men tion of "paddock" (the spelling used when referring to toads in general) in the play Hamlet comes in Hamlet's speech to his mother, where he uses the word to describe Claudius. In this speech, Hamlet also describes Claudius as a "bloat King."4 Nabokov, connecting Paduk with Claudius by paraphrasing "bloat King" into "swollen Tyrannosaurus," is suggesting that Paduk is as much a usurper and villain as Claudius. A comparison of Paduk to Claudius implies a comparison of Krug to Hamlet. Even without the play Hamlet dominating the discussion in chapter seven, the Shakespearean theme of "good" royalty at a disad vantage to the empowered "bad" royalty fits Bend Sinister if Krug and Paduk are accepted as rival kings. Like Hamlet, Krug is a philosopher and a john-a-dreams, unpregnant of his cause.5 Both Krug and Hamlet wear "inky cloaks" of mourning at the beginning of the respective works. Ophelia is discussed at length in chapter seven, and then later, a reference appears that seems to refer to her, when Krug, in his moon burst of madness, jumbles the details of both his parents' death and his son's and then says: "she getting drowned" (BS, p. 213). In that phrase, Krug is referring not to Ophelia, but to Olga, ascribing the cause of Ophelia's death to his wife. Krug is jumbling the facts, but he is doing *Cassell's New Compact Latin Dictionary (New York: Dell Publishing, 1976), p. 230. 'Solus Rex was one of Nabokov's provisional titles for Bend Sinister. See Simon Karlinsky, ed., The Nabokov-Wilson Letters (New York: Harper and Row, 1979), p. 169. However, by the time the novel was published, Nabokov had chosen a title that was a subtler clue to the novel's relation to chess. 4William Shakespeare, Hamlet (Baltimore, MD: Penguin Books, 1957), Act III, scene iv, line 183. *Hamlet, Act II, scene ii, line 553. BETWEEN LINES AND SQUARES 415</page><page sequence="4">so meaningfully because he is identifying his wife with Ophelia and thus himself with her lover, Hamlet. Krug's connection to Shakespeare's tragic royalty becomes even stronger when we turn to King Lear. In Bend Sinister's last chapter, Krug has lost the child he loves, is dressed in a long white robe, and is barefoot and insane. This is Lear's situation at the end of King Lear. In chapter four of Bend Sinister, Yanovsky, speaking of the deposed "Presi dent of State," says: "He all alone. Like King Lear" (BS, p. 39). The logic of Yanovsky's statement is that to be like Lear, one must be alone. In the following chapter, Maximov points out to Krug that Krug is not alone because he has a child. By Maximov's logic, for Krug to be alone — and thus like Lear, according to Yanovsky—he must be without his child. When, towards the end of the novel, Krug loses his child, his similarities to Lear begin. A verbal link is then established between Lear and Krug when Nabokov puts distorted quotations from the play in Krug's mouth. While being arrested, Krug says or thinks (it is unclear which): "Anything, anything, anything, anything, anything. Your boots, dragotzennyi [my precious] have a taste of candied plums. And look, my lips" (BS, p. 183). This is a distortion of the following lines from King Lear: Albany: With boot. ... All friends Shall taste the wages of their virtues. Lear: Never, never, never, never, never. . . . Lookl Her lips.6 Given the amount and strength of this evidence, Paduk and Krug can be identified as the two kings on the "board," if a board exists. The pawn mentioned in this line: "just as a cooked chess problem may be cured by the addition of a passive pawn" (BS, p. 74) is the next piece to be identified. Just as thoughtful speculation leads to a belief that Krug and Paduk are kings, so David seems to be the logical choice for this passive pawn. To "cook" a chess problem is to show that it has more than one possible solution. The problem in Bend Sinister is for the State to "mate" Krug, that is, for Paduk's regime to control Krug by force or persuasion and to prevent him from doing anything unless he agrees to support Ekwilism. From the failure of Paduk's attempts to control Krug through the arrest of Krug's friends, it appears that David does not prevent the problem from having more than one solution, but that David offers the only possible solution. This creates a discrepancy between the meaning of the word "cook" and David's apparent role in the novel, but this discrepancy will be cleared up when the chess prob •William Shakespeare, King Lear (Baltimore, MD: Penguin Books, 1958), Act V, scene iii, lines 302-304, 309, and 311. 416 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="5">lern itself is located and considered. The next consideration is the word "passive," which modifies the David pawn. Certainly David is not actively involved in the political plot of the novel and is in this sense passive.' The identification of Krug and Paduk as opposing chess kings and David as a pawn illustrates the relationship between Krug and Paduk and David's role in the novel respectively. But these identifications are also significant in that chess pieces, like Nabokov's characters, are con trolled by the players moving them. (In the case of chess problems, there is only one player.) The relationship between creator and creation in Bend Sinister is an important one; Nabokov, the ultimate narrator, interrupts Krug's own thoughts whenever he pleases, and it is Krug's realization that "he [Krug] is in good hands [Nabokov's]" (BS, p. xviii) that accounts for Krug's inane and jolly insanity at the book's conclu sion. But the creator/creation relationship in Bend Sinister cannot be fully understood until we know the details surrounding the composition of the chess problem and the problem that Nabokov had in mind when writing Bend Sinister in 1945 and 1946. In the late 1860s, Charles Lutwidge Dodgson published Through the Looking Glass. The volume contained not only the adventures of Alice, but also a chess problem to which the adventures corresponded. (Long before Nabokov wrote Bend Sinister, he was a great fan of Car roll's and had even published a Russian translation of Alice's Adven tures in Wonderland while still living in Europe.) Though there is a chess problem that pertains to Bend Sinister, Nabokov had no intention of making things as easy for his readers as Carroll had for his public by publishing the novel and the problem together. However, he did publish eighteen of his chess problems in 1972, in a collection accurately enti tled Poems and Problems. Nabokov concludes this volume's introduction as follows: "The present collection of a few problems composed recently forms an adequate corollary to my later verse" (PP, p. 15). The intro duction is dated 1969, and this date is a disappointment, since a set of problems composed around 1969 could not possibly have been used by the author in a novel composed in the mid-40s. The "ultra-sophisticated solver" (Nabokov's term) will turn from the volume's introduction—but not from the volume itself—to the problems. Those who do this will find that under the first problem are the words "Composed in Paris mid-May 1940" (PP, p. 182) in place of Nabokov's Cheshire-cat grin. Obviously, 1940 is not recent with respect to 1969; however, it is quite timely with respect to Bend Sinister. This chess problem, which Nabokov called attention to by allowing 'There are a number of images which seem to connect David to the symbol of the lamb (see BS, pp. 85, 88, and 200), but they are more likely an attempt to tease symbol seeförs or a reference to the lamb in Through the Looking Glass than a reference to the adjective "passive." BETWEEN LINES AND SQUARES 417</page><page sequence="6">the otherwise accurate introduction to Poems and Problems to exclude it, also appears in Speak, Memory. Nabokov concludes the fourteenth chapter of his autobiography with simultaneous descriptions of his last days in Paris, the chess problem which he completed during these last days, his attitudes towards chess problems in general, and, in the last paragraph, the official seal that the French stamped on his books and papers as he left that country. At the beginning of Bend Sinister, Adam Krug's family consists of himself, his wife, and his son; they are living in a city that has been newly named Padukgrad, a city divided by a river; and, whether Adam Krug realizes it or not, the new regime is a threat to him and his family. In the few months before Nabokov left Europe —the early 1940s, mid-May included —his family consisted of him, his wife, and his son; they were living in Paris, a city divided by a river; and the impending Nazi oc cupation was a threat to himself and his family. Adam Krug ignores the danger of the new regime, but he does not hesitate to speak of his distaste for its leader and its ideals. Vladimir Nabokov did not ignore the danger which Nazi occupation would present to him and his family— his last few months in Paris were spent borrowing money and making bribes and arrangements to leave Europe. According to Andrew Field's biography, Nabokov did not hesitate to display his distaste for the en croaching Fascists. But Nabokov is not Adam Krug (any more than Melville is Ishmael), and this cannot be overstressed. The similarities be tween Nabokov and Krug listed above identify Bend Sinister as one of Nabokov's novels in which he alters and distorts his own situation, places into it a character who is in some degree similar to himself, and then speculates on the resulting plot. Such speculation allows Nabokov to use his life as material for his books without being autobiographical. (Indeed, as Nabokov's life proved, such speculation grants the author huge amounts of privacy by feeding the reader all sorts of biographical details except the correct ones.) Often cited examples of this type of speculation on Nabokov's part are Charles Kinbote in Pale Fire, who is as careless in annotating John Shade's poem as Nabokov was careful in his annotation of Pushkin's Eugene Onegin, and V. in The Real Life of Sebastian Knight, who, as a Russian beginning to write in English, is careless in ways that his creator is not. The main characters of The Gift and Pnin are two other examples —in Pnin, Timofey's situation is so similar to Nabokov's that Nabokov takes the unfortunate Timofey's place at the end of the book. In general, Nabokov's characters make major mistakes that Nabokov himself avoided making. Adam Krug's mistake is ignoring the threat that Paduk's regime presents. Krug's situation is an extended and grotesque distortion of the one that Nabokov might have been in had he remained in Paris in 1940. 418 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="7">(Perhaps it is merely understatement or perhaps it is for his wife's peace of mind that the fictional death of Olga Krug, however suspicious, is far neater than the rather ugly one that Vera Nabokov escaped, but that millions of her fellow Jews and members of Hitler's other "inferior races" had to face.) In his introduction to Bend Sinister, Nabokov claims to have a link with Krug that is represented by the little puddle in which the plot starts to breed: "this little puddle vaguely evokes in him [Krug] my link with him" (BS, p. xv); any link other than the one between creator and creation is never mentioned in the introduction. Just as Krug's life is in a sense a distortion of Nabokov's (and this, of course, is the link that Nabokov chooses not to mention in the introduc tion), this oblong pool, "shaped like a cell about to divide" (BS, p. xiv), is a distortion of an image from Nabokov's own life. As would be ex pected, the image is from Nabokov's last days in Paris; it is the stamped mark discussed in chapter fourteen of Speak, Memory, a sample of which Nabokov has thoughtfully reproduced directly following that chapter (SM, p. 294). That stamped mark that the French put on Nabokov's papers, in cluding the paper on which Nabokov wrote the problem, is a circle within a larger circle, a very familiar design for official seals. In Rus sian, the word "krug" means circle. The last sentence of the third chapter of Bend Sinister discusses the novel's main character, Krug, in this manner: '"Yes of course —how stupid of me,' thought Krug, the cir cle in Krug, one Krug in another one" (BS, p. 35). If, in this last line, the name Krug is replaced by the word "circle," then the line describes the image of a circle within a circle, the same shape as that stamped mark. Krug's speculation on death offers another such image: the dis integration of . . . the circular dungeon . . . now he can survey the whole circular landscape" (BS, p. 135). In chapter seventeen, Krug as a circle participates in another image of one circle in another when he finds himself in a room which Nabokov describes as "perfectly round" (BS, p. 188). Krug finds himself the circle in a perfectly round room, and he is also the circle within a circular novel. Bend Sinister begins with Krug viewing the same scenery that Nabokov will describe at the end of the novel as his own. Since the novel begins and ends with the same view it may be said to be circular in structure. In Bend Sinister, Krug looks out onto scenery in November that, an entire novel later, Nabokov sees in early Spring. The circle, having made its way through time, can be thought of as a spiral, yet this is not an inconsistency since Nabokov himself describes such spirals as "spiritualized circles" (SM, p. 275). This standard circle within a circle is distorted a number of ways, and these distortions are all part of the main image of Bend Sinister. BETWEEN LINES AND SQUARES 419</page><page sequence="8">If the circle within a circle were crushed or squeezed, the result would be the oblong shape that begins the novel; the image could be distorted another way if the two circles were pulled in opposite direc tions, and this distortion appears as the footprint shape and the cell about to divide; and the "infusoria-like image of ciliated thought" (BS, p. xiv) can be produced by placing the paper upon which the circle within a circle is stamped into water, making the ink run. Through most of the novel, Nabokov gives us either an image, one circle within another, or the product of its distortion; however, he does connect the image with its distortion once within the novel by display ing the active process of the distortion. This occurs in chapter seven teen. In the perfectly round room, Krug "had a throbbing headache: one of those headaches that seem to transcend on one side the limits of one's head, like the colours in cheap comics, and do not quite fill the head space on the other" (BS, p. 188). In these lines, one Krug is over lapping another Krug whom he has been inside, very much like the cell about to divide. Having all this peripheral evidence, we find that both common sense and the last sentence of chapter fourteen of Speak, Memory demands that we look directly at the chess problem "composed in Paris mid-May 1940." This last sentence refers not only to the chess problem, but also to the stamped mark whose relevance to Bend Sinister we have just seen. The sentence reads: "However, it is only now, many years later, that the information concealed in my chess symbols, which that control permitted to pass, may be, and in fact is divulged" (SM, p. 293). The words "control" and "information" constitute a punning reference to the words within the stamped mark— Contrôle des Informa tions. The chess symbols to which Nabokov refers are those that make up the problem he composed during the time his life most resembled Adam Krug's, the same problem to which he called attention by placing it in Poems and Problems. A discussion of the problem alone shall be followed by a demonstration of its connection to Bend Sinister. The only equivalence that a chess problem has with the game itself is that the conditions for mate are the same, the pieces move in the same manner, and white always moves first. Any chess problem has only one possible solution. The object of this particular problem is for White to mate Black in two moves; that is to say, White must make a move followed by any possible move by Black with the result that White will mate Black with its next move. The solution to this problem is White moving its Bishop (xii) to C-2 with the result that of the four moves that are possible for Black, none will prevent White from following it with mate. It should be explained that R (ix), B (xiii), and Kt (xiv) are what is called "pinned," i.e., they cannot move either because they are blocked 420 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="9">by other pieces or because they would place their king in check. When B (xii) makes the key move, it prevents P (xi) from advancing and therefore the only four pieces Black may move are P (v), P (vi), Kt (xvii), and K (x). For the moves that each of these pieces may make, there is a corresponding move by White to follow it and declare mate. Of these four possibilities, the reader's attention is called to K (x)'s move to D-6. This move is followed by White's move of Q (iv) to C-5. We shall have cause to look at that particular solution a little later. The chess problem: Chess problem composed by Vladimir Nabokov in Paris, mid-May, 1940. What makes B (xii)'s move to C-2 the only solution is the existence of P (xi), without which the problem could also be solved as follows: P (ii) to B-8 to become a knight. (In chess, when a pawn reaches the other side of the board, it may become any piece the player chooses, and in this case the knight is the most advantageous choice.) That move would be followed by P (v) to D-6, exposing K (i) to check. White could then move P (ii) —now a knight—to D-7, blocking the check and mating Black. However, the existence of P (xi) prevents all this from being possible, because if White moves P (ii) to B-8 and makes it a knight, then Black can follow with P (xi) to C-2. If Black does this, then when BETWEEN LINES AND SQUARES 421</page><page sequence="10">White moves P (ii) to D-7, no mate occurs since Black can then move to D-6 and avoid White's offensive. On page 6 of Bend Sinister, Krug is walking towards the bridge when a "lantern moved knight-wise to check him." This is a reference to the wrong solution described above in which P (ii) moves to B-8 and becomes a knight with the intention of mating Black on the next move. However, we know that the knight will not mate the Black King on the next move if Black moves P (xi) to C-2, thus ignoring White's offensive. Assuming that Krug is the equivalent of the Black King, then when the Lantern moves knight-wise, his move must be one which ignores the offensive made by White (Paduk's knight on the quay). When writing about this chess problem, Nabokov calls P (xi) to C-2 a "modest dilatory move" (SM, p. 293). The move Krug makes the next day is to take David into the country. Krug does this to gain time before he must tell David that his mother, Krug's wife, is dead —a dilatory move, and one that ignores Paduk's offensives of the night before. Had David not ex isted, Krug would not have gone to the country and his movements in the city, movements of apathy and antagonism, could have led to a number of various reactions from Paduk, including Krug's execution or his imprisonment or his active rebellion. So although David's capture offers the only possible solution to the problem in Bend Sinister, it is his presence that keeps Paduk from provoking Krug into rebellious action since Krug is ignoring Paduk. Any attempt by Paduk to "get" Krug must include David in order to be successful since Krug is too distracted by and concerned about David for any other type of attempt, such as the arrest of Krug's friends, to succeed. To the experienced solver of chess problems, P (xi) sticks out; it is the clue to the key move by virtue of its nonthematic position. All the pieces relate directly to K (x)'s position on the board with regard to White (this is the theme) except P (xi). But just as in Bend Sinister, Paduk's young police state is too inexperienced to realize that arresting David, a seemingly obvious move, is the way to get Krug, so the inex perienced solver will miss the simple key move in the chess problem, which is to arrest P (xi)'s motion with B (xii). In the chess problem, the key move is B (xii)'s, which from the point of view of K (x) is a move from up left to down right. Such a mo tion defines a bend sinister. In the introduction to Bend Sinister, Nabokov speaks of the title as "an attempt to suggest ... a distortion in the mirror of being, a wrong turn taken by life" (BS, p. xii). The term "attempt to suggest" is quite vague for Nabokov, a man who claims to "think like a genius" (SO, foreword). The novel does contain a comical reference to the title in chapter two, when Krug puts his handkerchief "into the left-hand pocket of his overcoat" but on second thought trans 422 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="11">ferred it to his right-hand trouser pocket" (BS, p. 7). But the title only achieves its relevance when it is thought of as describing the key move of the chess problem which is so relevant to the novel and Nabokov's life. Once the key move is made, arresting David in chapter sixteen, the next move must be made by Black. In chapter eighteen, Nabokov freezes the action in the book by describing a "coloured photograph" (BS, p. 213) of the scene in the schoolyard. Paduk is on the right facing the exit and near the wall. Using Krug/K (x)'s perspective once again, we see that K (i) is against the right edge of the board, just as Paduk is against the wall, and if K (i) faces the direction that White is moving, then it is facing a kind of "exit" leading off the board, square A-8. Krug is described as being in the middle of the yard, and indeed K (x) is as near the middle of the chess board as a piece can get. The next thing that happens is that Ember catches Krug's elbow and turns Krug around. On the chess board this could be accomplished by P (v) moving to either D-5 or D-6, turning K (x), so to speak, towards K (i). After Ember has his say, he suddenly drops out of the narrative, but pre sumably when Schamm informs them that "this will never do" (BS, p. 215) he is sending Ember and any others back to their places, just as a solver would move P (v) back to D-7 after seeing that it would not pre vent mate. Schamm cannot be talking to Krug at that point because it is not until later that Schamm is described as turning towards Krug. Schamm is standing next to Krug at this point in the same way that Kt (vii) is next to K (x), and Schamm's "white-feathered" hat is quite like the white mane of the conventional White knight in chess. Earlier, the reader's attention was called to one particular set of moves which follow the key. They were K (x) to D-6, which Nabokov tells us in Poems and Problems is mated by Q (iv) to C-5. In Bend Sinister, Krug begins running towards Paduk shortly after Ember is sent back to his space. What follows is that Krug's left ear is shot off, but he keeps on running and is killed. From the perspective of K (x), Q (iv) at tacks from his left if he had moved to D-6, a move toward K (i). The moves following mate which are never carried out on the chess board are for Black to move and then be taken. This, of course, is Krug's fate, and we can imagine K (x) merrily skipping to C-7, closer to Paduk/K (i), and then being taken by Kt (vii). The artist's imposition of conscious order on the world and the ex pression of this imposition were Nabokov's specialty. Bend Sinister is so finely ordered a novel that Krug's philosophical posture is illustrated with connections to Hamlet; that when Krug becomes an irrational, beaten parent, he appears like King Lear; and that both these textures contribute to the identification of Krug as a king on a chess board. The BETWEEN LINES AND SQUARES 423</page><page sequence="12">novel is so precisely contrived that the last scene of the novel cor responds perfectly to the chess problem concerned with Nabokov's life and the book, the two being connected by the image of a circle within another. In addition, it seems that Nabokov spent the better part of this description of his attitudes towards chess problems dropping hints that the chess problem at the end of chapter fourteen of Speak, Memory is relevant to some work of fiction that he created: I do not seem to convey sufficiently the ecstatic core of the process and its points of con nection with various other, more overt and fruitful operations of the mind, from the chart ing of dangerous seas to the writing of one of those incredible novels where the author, in a fit of lucid madness, has set himself certain unique rules that he observes, certain night mare obstacles that he surmounts, with the zest of a deity building a live world ... In the case of problem composition, the event is accompanied by a mellow physical satisfaction, especially when the chessmen are beginning to enact adequately, in a penultimate re hearsal, the composer's dream. (SM, pp. 290-291) The deity that derives pleasure from chess problems is the one that composed Bend Sinister, "an anthropomorphic deity impersonated by" Nabokov (BS, p. xviii). This deity directs the "penultimate rehearsal" that is held in chapter eighteen of Bend Sinister, one such "incredible novel." This novel does convey sufficiently these "points of connection" which Nabokov speaks of above by achieving a subtle and precise inter relation of life, art, and chess. It would seem that Nabokov expanded the idea of texture to extend beyond just one novel. This essay has dealt with a texture that involves three volumes of Nabokov's works. Are there other such extensions? Perhaps. Perhaps, for instance, the fact that the color pink appears so often in The Real Life of Sebastian Knight is connected with Nabokov's perception, revealed in a 1962 interview, of different letters of the alphabet as different colors. When asked what colors his own initials were, Nabokov replied: "'V' is a kind of pale transparent pink" (SO, p. 17). The narrator of TRLSK is called V.; just as his perceptions saturate the novel, so does the color of his name. Turning back to Bend Sinister, we find that Pnin ties a few of the former novel's details together. Among the shoes presented to Krug at the palace there is "a girl's tiny slipper trimmed with moth-eaten squir rel fur" (BS, p. 125). Later, Mariette's footfalls will be described as "the sloppy tread of her old bed slippers trimmed with dirty fur" (BS, p. 141); it is during this scene that these footfalls are described that Nabokov dubs Mariette Cinderella. As Mariette is in Mac's arms watch ing Krug struggle, "One of her slippers fell off' (BS, p. 182), and, a few pages later, the neanderthal asks Mariette: "Sure you not cold, Cin?" (BS, p. 186). Since Mariette is a spy, her slipper's appearance in the 424 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="13">palace is no surprise, and because one of these slippers falls off later, Nabokov is justified in connecting her to Cinderella. But it takes an ex pert like Timofey Pnin to tell us why Mariette's slippers are not made of glass. Impressing his party guests, Pnin informs them that Cinderella's "shoes were not made of glass, but of Russian squirrel fur" (P, p. 132). By incorporating into his novels such textures as the ones described above, Nabokov achieves a powerful unity, in that the details of his novels are not just important to plot and mood, but also to theme and meaning. His work asks us to be constantly aware of the importance of detail. The more we deal with detail, the more we are dealing with the work itself and the further we get from the vague and meaningless generalities commonly labeled interpretation. Nabokov demands that we deal with his books the way that he dealt with all he read, immersing himself in the work's specifics while, at the same time, grasping the work as a whole. If we choose to read a Nabokov novel and are willing to deal with it on the author's terms, then he rewards us by planting meaning in his details which produce satisfying solutions to the literary puzzles which he has devised. Finally, Nabokov reminds us that just as in a chess problem where the real competition is not between Black and White, but between the composer and the hypothetical solver, so "in a first-rate work of fiction the real clash is not between the characters, but between the author and the world" (SM, p. 290). If, when dealing with a work of art, we wish to accept the author's challenge, then we must search for the unique rules which the author has imposed upon his work and the world, being careful to impose none of our own.
