ONE of the crucial questions that can be asked about a poet is: What views does he express concerning the spiritual element of the universe and its action on man- kind? What does he conceive to be the relation of man to the powers that pro- duced and condition him ? Nowadays all serious poets, except the lyrical, have their powers estimated by the amount of philosophic reflection that their Weltan- schauung, their theory of the universe, exhibits. Assuming that Virgil did not- nay, could not-write the Aeneid without possessing and manifesting some kind of metaphysical system, I shall endeavour in this paper to discover what principles of thought underlie his presentation of the re- lations of gods and men, and are implicit in his use of the word fata. First let us examine the problem: What was the reality of the gods of the Aeneid for Virgil's own beliefs ? Could an enlightened poet, who may be presumed to have read the attacks of Plato and Euripides on the anthropomorphism of the Homeric gods, who had read the De Rerum Natura and was familiar with other Epi- curean and agnostic speculations, believe earnestly that the gods whom he depicted were of moment for the souls of men ? Answers may be found in the Aeneid to show that the poet was not unconscious of the defectiveness of his gods regarded as worthy objects of whole-hearted reverence. Speaking in his own person, the poet questions the goodness of the gods in A en. I. I I, 12. 503, 6. 173. While his gods live on a higher ethical plane than the Homeric gods, yet they do not reach the level of goodness presented by philosophers in the picture of the sapiens; as Jupiter himself allows (12. 839), the Romans surpassed even the gods in goodness. Juno certainly is vindictive and spiteful towards Aeneas (I. 11, 27, etc.), and towards Hercules (8. 292); Venus is wheedling (e.g. 8. 387 ff.); Triton is jealous of a human musician (6. 173); Hercules is amorous (7. 659 if.) ; Neptune, in demanding a human sacrifice for no reason given, is, at the least, arbi- trary (5. 815); Jupiter in especial is vacil- lating and weakly complaisant (io. 624; I2. 8oo, 833); he makes a solemn declara- tion (1. 263), and then goes back upon it or forgets it (io. 8); 1 his prophecy in I. 271 is inconsistent with that of Anchises in 6. 765, 766; in io. 107 he says: ' Rex Iuppiter omnibus idem,' but repeatedly thereafter interferes (e.g. 10. 435, 450, 632, 689), while his prohibition is disregarded by Venus (Io. 332), Tisiphone (Io. 761), Thybris (Io. 421), and violated frequently with impunity by Juno and Juturna (in Book XII.). Juno is of opinion that even 1 Of course some of these defects may be due not to dramatic purposes, but to forgetfulness in the poet. NO. CCXII. VOL. XXIV. M</page><page sequence="2">170 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW after Jove has pledged his word, he may be induced to break it (io. 632), and without instigation from another god he does so (ii. 725). His reputation for veracity is so uncertain that (to omit as prejudiced the taunts against him of larbas in 4. 206 ff.) Palinurus, without incurring any reproach of blasphemy, may say (5. 17) that he would not believe an assurance of safety if it were given by Jupiter himself. Though he in company with Apollo (ii. 789) and fortuna (8. 534) is called omnipotens, his power is limited (9. 6, 94), while his knowledge of the future is circumscribed (4. 227). He is invoked separately by men on only five occasions (2. 689, 4. 206, 5. 687, 9. 625, IO. 668; cf. 8. 572), and on two of them in his limited capacity as sky- god. Was such a figure identified by the poet with the spirit that inly sustains all the furniture of earth and heaven (6. 724 ff.)? If the answer be 'No,' an inference from these facts is that Virgil kept the figures of the gods, taken from Homer and the earlier Roman annalists but purified, in obedience to the epic convention and to the prejudices of Augustus, who thought he could restore to a generation of scoffers the credulous religion of his ancestors by reviving old rites and externals of belief. Showing a similar deference to religious and literary convention, Horace, Ovid, and Propertius employ the names of the gods, but can impart no sincerity into the em- ployment. In himself Virgil probably was as monotheistic as Plato or Cleanthes. In the Georgics he gave the name Pater to the spiritual power which worked be- hind and through the Olympians and through men. In his highest attributes Jupiter is the instrument and representa- tive of the god behind the gods, but he is not to be identified with the spiritual prin- ciple of things nor are his utterances of like validity with its decrees. Now if the portrait of Jupiter in the Aeneid is chiefly a concession to convention,1 prob- ably those critics err who see so much spirituality in his functions that they identify fata with the will of Jupiter (e.g. Heinze: Virgils Epische Technik, p. 286 ff.). That this identification is wrong may, I think, be proved by an examination of the meaning of fata in the Aeneid. But first let me state briefly what I suppose Virgil's scheme of theology to have been. It was this: There is one supreme and spiritual deity whose decrees are fata-inviolable courses of destined events. But the deity has not irrevocably fixed the destiny of every man before his birth. For nations, like Troy and Rome, and individuals, like Aeneas and Dido, there are certain matters of their life which must come to pass; these are actualities determined beforehand in the divine mind, but there are many contingencies which are left to the self- determining human agent.2 The instru- ments of the divine mind are the gods and men. The gods suggest emotions and actions to man, and prompt him in the way of righteousness by their utterances (fata, in the first of the meanings noticed below). Man is conditioned in many ways by the (gods of the) earth, sea, sky, etc., i.e., by his environment, but in the greater part of his life he is a free, willing agent; to those events which he has not willed and cannot refer to a known source, natural or supernatural, he gives the loose name fortuna, but he knows that this fortuna may be part of his destiny.3 The significations of the word fata in the A eneid may be arranged in three classes: 1 Of Lucretius, who in a similar spirit invoked Venus while denying that the gods interfered with human affairs, Sellar writes : 'Though the ultimate principles of Lucretius are incompatible with a belief in the popular religions of antiquity, his mode of conceiving the operation of law in the universe [fati foedera, 2. 254] is not irreconcilable with the conceptions of modern Theism.'-Roman Poets of the Republic, pp. 342, 343, q.v. 2 For a stimulating philosophic statement of this metaphysical position, see Professor W. James's essay,' The Dilemma of Determinism,' in The Will to Believe, p. 181. 3 On this theory the intermediate activity of the gods need not be of great importance to human beings. In the Aeneid the only actions of the gods that were evidenced by objective signs were: Book II.: Appearance of the snakes and of fire on Iulus' head. Book V.: The burning of the ships through Iris. Book VII.: The opening of the gates of war by Juno. Book VIII.: The bringing of armour to Aeneas by Venus. Book IX.: The transformation of the ships to sea-nymphs.</page><page sequence="3">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW i71 I. I Predictions' uttered by a god (from the root fa, cp. I. 261, 262), whether the predictions be accurate or not. Generally they were correct, because the gods had exceptional powers of learning (I. 20) some of the predestined facts, and when the event predicted was in the counsels of destiny only contingent, the belief held by men in the expediency of the prescribed course of action tended to create its own verification. 2. ' An ordained course of events having happened or about to happen.' 3. In some passages the word seems to share in both meanings. The first meaning is the root-meaning. The decrees of the supreme power (some- times mythologically attributed to the Parcae1) are best known by Jupiter, most often declared by his mouthpiece Apollo, who has other mouthpieces such as Celaeno (3. 250), the Penates (3. 155), the Sibyl (6. 66). These get from men a share of the credit of authorship, though the function of all is merely transmissive. From 8. 627 we see that an artisan god like Vulcan might get information about the future from human seers. Jupiter and any of the gods may be mistaken about details, for these are left to the agency of gods and of men (as in Book V. Neptune of his own will, as it seems, and with the help of Somnus delapsus ab astris produced the unexpected effect of the drowning of Palinurus which gives Palinurus a cause of complaint against the accuracy of Apollo, 6. 344), and the purposes of rival gods may thwart one another. The passages in which fata may be in- terpreted simply as 'the spoken word' are: I. 205, 237, 257, 261, 299, 382; 2. 121; 3. 444, 700; 4 110, 225, 340, 440; 5. 656, 703, 709 ; 6. 45, 67, 72, 147 ; 7. 239, 255, 272, 293, 583 ; 8. 12, 133, 476, 499, 512; 9. 137; 10. 67, 154, 417; I I. 112. Total, 35. The passages in which fatum or fata may be interpreted as 'an ordained course of events' are : I. 222, 546; 2. 34, 246, 294, 433, 506, 554, 653, 753 ; 3. 345, 494, 717, 4. 20, 519, 651, 678, 696; 6. 376, 449, 466, 511, 546, 683, 713, 759, 869, 882 ; 7. 50, 79, 314, 594; 8. 292, 334, 731; 9- 94, 648; 10. 35, 113, 380, 471, 501, 624, 740; II. 287; 12. 395, 507, 676, 726, 795, 819. Total, 51. The passages in which the word seems to partake of both meanings are: I. 2, 18, 32, 39; 2. 13, 54,2 257; 3 7, 9, 17, 18o0, 337, 375; 4. 14, 450, 614; 5. 707, 725, 784; 7. 120, 224, 234; 8. 398, 574; 9- 134, 204; io. 16o, 587, 701; 12. 149. Total, 30. With this attempted classification made, let us examine the passages cited to support the identification of fata8 with the will of Jupiter. One passage is Aen. I. 260 ff. Venus has reminded Jupiter of the success of Aeneas which he had promised to her. Jupiter replies (257), 'manent immota tuorumI fata tibi . .. (260) neque me sententia uertit.' But the word sententia ('my way of thinking') may mean 'my interpretation of data furnished to me' as suitably as 'my [unconditioned] will.' Similarly, in I. 278, the words 'c imperium sine fine dedi' are not incompatible with Jupiter's position as chief executor of fata. In 4. I io, where Venus says: 'fatis incerta feror si luppiter unam esse uelit Tyriis urbem Troiaque profectis,' fatis means 'oracles,' and Jupiter is to be viewed as intermediary between ~b OcEov and mankind; for in I. 18 the same qualification is ex- pressed by the words ' si qua fata sinant' without mention of Jupiter's wish. In 5. 784 where Venus says of Juno, 'nec Iouis imperio fatisue infracta quiescit,' the ' It is most unlikely that the Parcae were iden- tified by Virgil with the Moirai who, in Aesch. P.V. 516, Againm. 1026, are spoken of as powers overruling Zeus, for (i) mention of them in the Aeneid is rare and insignificant; (2) by art and poetic convention (as in Catullus and Eclogue 4. 47) the idea of them had become too material and unspiritual. 2 In 2. 154 si fata deum, si mens non laeua fuisset, the alternatives may be (I) the oracles as distin- guished from the Trojan interpretation of them (mens); (2) the course willed by the gods as distin- guished from the Trojan resolve which acted in furtherance of that course. 3 We sometimes read of Jupiter's relation to fatum; but the fact that the plural cases of fata occur in the Aeneid 1o4 times, while the singular cases occur only 15 times, shows that Virgil had no desire to use the word in the abstract philo- sophical signification current-e.g. in Cicero's De Fato. Lucretius, who seldom uses the word, has a passage (2. 254-257) in which fatum and fata seem identical in meaning.</page><page sequence="4">172 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW meaning probably is: 'Juno is crushed neither by commands of Jupiter [privately expressed as in Io. 606; 12. 791] nor by his [public] predictions of an ordained course of events,' by which other gods are checked, as is Diana (11. 587) and Apollo (II. 794). In 3. 375 Helenus, referring to the fact that Aeneas voyages under auspices higher than human, adds:' Sic fata deum rex [ sortitur uoluitque uices, is uertitur ordo.' The meaning obviously is: ' To this end the king of the gods selects his oracles and rolls the circle of events,' which again is not inconsistent with the amount of free self-determined activity that Jupiter possesses. In 4. 614, '[si] sic fata louis poscunt, si terminus haeret,' the words 'fata Iouis' might mean 'utter- ances'; even if they be taken as meaning 'course of events willed by Jupiter,' we may regard Jupiter as the source, either secondary or ultimate. In 4. 651, in the words ' dum fata deusque sinebant,' there is a conjunction of agents that is hard to explain if deus be identified with Jupiter and fata with his will; but if the source of fata be placed elsewhere than in Jupiter's will, the mention of him or of any other god as intermediary is quite suitable. Against the identification of fata with the will of Jupiter many passages may be adduced. Most decisive, perhaps, are the passages where the decisions of fata and of Jupiter or another god are contrasted, e.g. 8. 398, 'nec Pater omnipotens nec fata uetabant' ; 3. 395, ' fata uiam inuenient aderitque uocatus Apollo,' and cf. 2. 121, 3. 337, 4. 440, and 8. 334, 574. In IO. II12, Jupiter unambiguously says: ' Rex Jup- piter omnibus idem; fata uiam invenient.'. In 12. 725, we have the unhappy literary reminiscence, inserted forcibly into a description of a battle scene which without it runs smoothly, of Jupiter weigh- ing the fata of Aeneas and Turnus, although in 1. 793 Jupiter reminds Juno that Aeneas must conquer and ultimately become a god1; one fact emerges from the scene-namely, that the decision of the strife is made by some power other than Jupiter's. In both of these last instances he in an emergency refuses the responsibility of a decision. That he is conditioned by some other power is shown in io. 467,2 where he tells Alcides that he may not inter- fere to save Pallas, for 'stat sua cuique dies,'3 in 9. 94 ff. he must refuse Cybele's wish, because offata, which have not granted to any god the power she requires. He is by implication included among the gods who on the testimony of a goddess, Iris (9. 6), could not have done what the course of events unaided has done. Though Jupiter may promise vaguely, it is for the Parcae to determine the time of fulfilment (9. Io7 ; 12. 150). The foregoing instances show that things happen otherwise than Jupiter knows or intends. But Jupiter and the gods are not the only instruments of fata. In the Aeneid we seem to be presented with other two sources of action-the will of men and the operations of fortuna. What is the place of these motor forces in Virgil's scheme ? In the Aeneid human beings as agents are only a little lower than the gods; men are subject to the influence of the gods only within the sphere of the contingent. This influence is exerted constantly and in diverse manners. Perhaps Virgil in his attempt to justify the ways of Providence to men, was led too frequently to see super- natural influences, because the materialistic Epicureans of his day denied divine inter- ference in mundane affairs. If in some instances he seems to contrast the opera- tions of the gods with the operations of men, the fact that the supernatural influence is mentioned first shows where the em- phasis was put by the poet's thought.. i Cf. also Io. 471-2. 2 This passage, a reminiscence of II. 16. 433, shows an instructive dissimilarity from it. In Homer Zeus, while allowing that it is Sarpedon's portion (uo'opa) to be killed, yet thinks about saving him, but is shamed from that by Hera. Jupiter in the Aeneid never thinks of violating fas or fata (only goddesses, Juno and Cybele, dream of that); further, he spontaneously grows indig- nant because Aesculapius interfered with natural laws (7. 770). 3 But this principle is inconsistent with the ideas in 4. 620: 'cadat ante diem'; 4. 696: 'quia nec fato merita nec morte peribat I sed misera ante diem '; Io. 624, 11. i6o, 12. 149 if., 395.</page><page sequence="5">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 173 In I1. 118 we have the idea that men are preserved by a god [or 'God'] or by their own right hand; in 10. 72 that Aeneas could be misled by his own acts, without prompting from a god; in 9. 184 that men may be roused by the gods or by their own passions; in 9- 253 that they are rewarded by the gods and their own character; in 9. 6oi that the Trojans were led to Italy by a god or by their own madness; in 2. 237 that Aeneas was called to battle by an Erinys, and by the shouting of men. Space does not allow me to discuss Virgil's theory of causation, shown in these passages, and in others (e.g. 12. 554 and 560, II. 901), which have been examined by Professor Conway.1 These appearances and revela- tions of the gods in the Aeneid might be arranged under a scheme such as this: (I) Cases where man unexpectant is affected by the action of the gods ; (2) cases where man unexpectant is affected by a revelation in a dream or by an oracle; (3) cases where man expectant is affected by the action of the gods; and (4) cases where *man expectant is affected by a revelation in a dream. It will be found that in many cases the action of the gods is the reflection in outward nature of the mood of the man's mind, that divine actions and dreams merely bring to a focus feelings already latent. The men being in the way, the gods led them.2 The cases have already been enumerated where the divine working was accompanied by objective signs which would have refuted any scoffer present. The other cases are too numerous to mention here in which the actors have ,only subjective inferences of the activity of the gods, or are quite unconscious of it, while the reader who can overlook what happens before and behind the scenes alone is aware of the divine purpose. Thus in 4. 128 Juno discloses to Venus her purposes concerning Dido and Aeneas; without this knowledge the reader would not detect any divine working in the results described in 1. I60 ff. Many other instances seem to show that the poet would have us always be conscious of supernatural influ- ences ('of environment,' in the modern phrase); yet he does not doubt the reality of the freedom of the will. It is worth noting that Aeneas does not stand waiting for a sign, as some critics who talk of him being oppressed with a load of fata would have us think. In Book I., when the storm breaks, he views it in a quite naturalistic fashion, not appealing to the gods, as the average Roman sailor would certainly have done, but envying his fallen countrymen their quiet death already won. In Book II. he is so full of action that Venus has to recall him to a sense of his duty to his home; when his father refuses to leave Troy, Aeneas in a mad impulsiveness seeks not to argue with him, but is rushing forth to certain death when he is checked by a miraculous sign. All through the poem the gods thrust their favours upon him; like a wise man he uses their guidance, but in action he is prompt and in battle bold almost to the verge of in- discretion. By his own way of thinking (12. 435) his distinguishing marks were not his nearness and dearness to the gods, but his manliness and capacity for endurance. A question not easy to answer is: What is the place of fortuna in this metaphysical scheme attributed to Virgil? If the word fortuna were used strictly, it would imply what no theistic writer-and Virgil was such-could allow, namely, that actions unpurposed by God may happen. The idea of fortuna denies or fails to recognise the action of an intelligent and conscious Governor of events. But in popular language men spoke of fortuna and its effects, though by connecting fortuna with necessitas (cp. Hor. Od. I. 35. 17) they recognised that events were bound by strict laws of causation, and that things which seemed fortuitous were the product of series of causes which stretched beyond the limited vision of man. In Aen. 5. 604, the poet, speaking from the standpoint of the Trojans with their limited knowledge says: 'Hic primum fortuna fidem mutata nouauit,' but goes on to explain from the higher ground of poetic belief that the event was caused by Juno, whose evil purpose was turned to good by inscru- 1 In Proc.

In 1. 625 Iris identifies herself with the Trojan women in their feelings when she asks: ' O gens I infelix! cui te exitio fortuna reseruat ?' In I. 337 Aeneas says that the storm wrought forte sua, but the reader knows how it was brought to pass and why. In 8. 127 Aeneas who has been recommended to seek Evander by the Sibyl, Anchises and Thybris, says: ' Optime Graiugenum cui me fortuna precari . . . uoluit.' This at first seems strange, but the following lines show that fortuna is loosely used as the equivalent of fata (= ' oracles '), for Aeneas mentions the motives that brought him et fatis egere uolentem. Fortuna is to be inter- preted similarly in the speech of Venus in Io. 43 and 49, and of Jupiter 1. 107. Com- pare Io. 435 which says of Lausus and Pallas: 'quis fortuna negarat I in patriam reditus with 1. 438, 'mox illos sua fata manent maiore sub hoste.' Cp. also 6. 532, 8. 574, I0. 457 f. ; I I 43, lo8, 128, 253, 345 ; 12. 593, 677, 694. When fortuna refers to past or present events, the reader, if not the speaker, always knows the divine purpose to which the word is loosely or ignorantly applied; when it refers to future events as in I1. 128, spoken by Drances: ' Et te, si qua uiam dederit fortuna, Latino I iungemus regi,' it means in more pious phrase' if a way be opened up.' Cp. 8. 334 ff., 476-7, 10. 107, 12. 147. In a few passages Virgil contrasts casus and the gods as efficient causes. Here casus seem to mean 'spontaneous unde- liberated action, arising from the passions.' In 9. 211, 'si quis in aduersum rapiat casusue deusue,' the opposition is between reckless passions in warrior and moral enthusiasm in a patriot; in 12. 321 'in- certum . . . quis tantam Rutulis laudem casusne deusne j attulerit,' the opposition is between a foeman shooting at random and wastefully, and a foeman intent on killing some enemy and helped thereto by a god whom he has invoked ; in either case the agent must be a mortal.
