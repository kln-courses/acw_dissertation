<plain_text><page sequence="1">- ARTICLES ROBIN MILNER-GULLAND Tower and Dome: Two Revolutionary Buildings Since the 1960s much informed attention has been paid to the Russian artist Vladimir Tatlin (1885-1953), culminating in the recent appearance of John Milner's expert and sensitive study;' with his centenary year one can only expect such interest, in east and west, has intensified. Though Tatlin's fields of activity were extraordinarily diverse (and by no means all conventionally "artistic"), attention has been concentrated both in his lifetime and since on what is, by common consent, the greatest (or most notorious) of his endeavors: the project, unrealized at full scale and probably unrealizable in his lifetime (though several maquettes have been produced) for his Monument to the Third International, popularly dubbed " Latlin's Tower." Its appearance, known through drawings and photographs of Tatlin's original models, is probably familiar to anyone interested in Russian art or in modern architectural history as a whole: an open-ended double skew spiral of steel girders, standing on great arches, held up by a linked pair of straight inclined struts and a system of lesser openwork supports. The whole was to contain a succession of glass and steel halls revolving at various speeds, and (by most accounts) was to have reached a height of 400 meters.2 Tatlin's project was commissioned, and his plan publicized, in 1919-1920. Throughout the 1920s it was much discussed: generally in modernistic, mechani- cal, and constructivistic terms ("Art is dead-long live the machine-art of Tatlin!" appears in an often-reproduced photograph as a slogan of the two German avant-gardists Grosz and Heartfield). Recent scholars, however-particularly Milner-have analyzed the monument from a rather different viewpont, empha- sizing how (like most great buildings) it is both symbolically complex in itself and linked in very various ways with architectural and intellectual concepts of the past. Though Tatlin did not commit himself in print to explain his tower and its genealogy with the readiness of his distinguished predecessor Gustave Eiffel, 1. John Milner, Vladimir Tatlin and the Russian Avant-Garde (New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1983). Many other articles and books have something to say about the tower (see Milner's bibliography, pp. 236-237). One landmark in Tatlin studies must be singled out, Troels Andersen, Vladimir Tatlin (Stockholm: Moderna Museet, 1968) with much rare photographic material and many valuable texts in Swedish and English translation. The most important Russian sources are L. A. Zhadova, ed., V. E. Tatlin, exhibition catalog (Moscow, 1977), and A. Strigalev, 0 proekte pamiatnika III Internatsionalu in Voprosy sovetskogo izobrazitel'nogo iskusstva i arkhitektury (Moscow, 1973). A book based on a much-expanded version of Zhadova's catalog has been published in Hungarian and is due to appear in English from Thames and Hudson of London. 2. Milner and others give a more detailed description of the monument's projected structure; but it should be noted that there seems to have been no definitive blueprint, and some questions concern- ing Tatlin's intentions (particularly with regard to the inner system of halls) remain unresolved. As for the intended height, Shklovskii (1921) suggests twice that of St. Isaac's Cathedral in Petrograd (about 200 meters), Tschichold (1926) 200 meters higher than the Eiffel Tower (500 meters)-both are quoted in Andersen, Tatlin, pp. 50, 64. An early sketch apparently by Tatlin shows its top as level with that of the Eiffel Tower. Camilla Gray, The Russian Experiment in Art (London: Thames and Hudson, 1971), p. 226, claims "twice the height of the Empire State Building" (nearly 800 meters) but gives no sources. The Empire State Building did not of course exist at that time. A. Strigalev in Zhadova, ed., Tatlin, p. 19, points out that the figure of 400 meters is not accidental, being a hundred-thousandth part of the Earth's meridian.</page><page sequence="2">40 Slavic Review the study of his creative life, his world of ideas, and extensive cultural interests (in which his friend and coeval, the visionary poet Velimir Khlebnikov, played a crucial role) strongly supports the validity of the newer approach to the study of his great project. The relevant chapter of Milner's book mentions and investigates a large number of buildings and ideas that to varying extents can be regarded as forerunners or analogues of Tatlin's project. Some (like the Eiffel Tower) were undoubtedly in his mind; some (like Tommaso Campanella's ideal city) may well have been; others often mentioned were almost certainly not-but the study of monuments in all these categories can heighten our appreciation of the tower's layers of meaning and lasting value. For it is clear that Tatlin-though personally of rather modest and ascetic disposition-invested his work on the Monument to the Third International with considerable ambitions and a sense of destiny (this pattern of the homespun ascetic genius with universalist cultural pretensions is not untypical of modern Russia: leaving aside such well-known examples as Lev Tolstoi or Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, one might point to figures such as the philosopher Nikolai Fedorov, the scientist-visionary Konstantin Tsiolkovskii, the artists Vasillii Chekrygin and Pavel Filonov, the poets Khlebnikov and Nikolai Zabolotskii). In such circum- stances it is by no means inappropriate to mention Tatlin's plan in the same context as buildings that have become, or were intended from their inception to be, as comprehensively emblematic of their cultures as were the Roman Pantheon, the Palace Chapel at Aachen, the Javanese temple-mountain of Borobudur: buildings whose unique status and symbolic eloquence makes them more than merely buildings. Such too were the seven wonders of the ancient world: Tatlin's tower has been variously linked by commentators with the Colossus of Rhodes and the Great Pyramid, but there is an even closer (if previously unnoticed) relationship with the Pharos of Alexandria, a building that (to judge by its still- extant copy, the Roman lighthouse at La Corun-a) combined stories of varied cross-sections with an external spiral-precisely the formal basis of Tatlin's con- cept. Biblical mythology provided Tatlin (more ominously) with the concept of the Tower of Babel: the latter has been envisaged by numerous post-Renaissance artists in ways that relate directly to Tatlin's concept (Livius Creyl's Tower of Babel, engraved in 1670 for Athanasius Kircher, even features an exterior double spiral while there is an interesting Old Russian example in frescoes of c. 1680 at Borisoglebsk). As we shall see, Tatlin's intentions seem, no doubt hubristically, to have aspired to reverse the effects of the legendary fall of Babel by re- establishing universal communication. These are broad considerations; it is the main purpose of this article to focus more narrowly on a single comparison that should help to elucidate important aspects of the specific nature of the tower's individuality. The building with which I shall compare the tower can be categorized together with it in a whole series of respects, even though it was built some 1,230 years before Tatlin's plan was hatched. The comparison is one that Tatlin himself would probably not have made, since the scholarly work that renders it possible had not been done in his lifetime: Though given his interests in the cultural field in question I do not think he would have repudiated it. It differs somewhat from most of Milner's compari- sons in that it takes as its starting point not the formal (above all, spirally based) aspects of the tower or the anthropomorphic qualities to which Milner so tellingly draws attention, but rather the functions, ideology, and multiple purposes of a public building that is also, and primarily, a revolutionary monument.</page><page sequence="3">Tower and Dome 41 The building with which I wish to compare Tatlin's tower is the Dome of the Rock (Qubbat as Sakhra) in Jerusalem. One of the most distinctive structures in the world, it occupies a rather isolated and commanding position near the center of the original temple precinct (the crusaders indeed took it for the temple itself). It was designed by unknown architects at the behest of the Ummayad Caliph Abd al-Malik and completed in A. H. 72 (A.D. 691-692). Although it has sometimes, and misleadingly, been suggested that the building is a mosque, it most certainly is not one (that is, it is not a setting for communal prayer orien- tated towards Mecca). Rather, it is a great sanctuary of novel, complex, and by no means easily interpretable significance. Its structure, building history, and relation to other monuments were fully investigated by Sir Archibald Creswell half a century ago.3 More recently an important article by Oleg Grabar (reworked into a chapter of his subsequent book, The Formation of Islamic Art) has critically reexamined the usual explanations for the dome's construction and put forward a definitive account of what can be established or reasonably surmised about its original purposes.4 Much of my argument in this article will be based on Creswell's and, partcularly, Grabar's researches, though the conclusions reached are, of course, my own. The dome's form is as simple as it is remarkable. A masonry octagon (now gorgeously revetted, originally rather plain, with four unobtrusive doorways in alternate sides) contains two octagonal ambulatories separated by an arcade rest- ing on sixteen re-used classical columns and eight piers. From within these rises, again on piers (four) and columns (twelve), the domical element itself (a drum supporting a two-skinned dome, of basically wooden construction). The ground space beneath the dome is largely occupied by the low irregular mass of the eponymous rock, partly hollowed out into a cave. The interior double octagon and the drum retain their sumptuous original mosaic decoration, covering more than a thousand square meters. In general, despite the external facing and a late medieval reconstruction of the dome itself, the building we see today is remark- ably little changed from that of Abd al-Malik. Creswell and others have looked closely at the Dome of the Rock's stylistic origins. In certain respects it is an intensely original building (some of these respects, not wholly stylistic, will be discussed below). In others it fits easily into a tradition of classical and Christian architecture. Its immediate predecessors are the many centralized, sometimes octagonal, structures of late antiquity and early Byzantium, such as baptisteries and martyria (but going back to the octagon in the Golden House of Nero and ultimately to Greek tholoi as at Delphi and Olympia). Several centralized, circular or polygonal, Christian buildings are known from the Jerusalem area-one of them (the Church of the Holy Sepulcher) also making architectonic use of a natural rocky feature. Creswell emphasizes Syrian antecedents: In a somewhat quaint, but not unconvincing, statistical analy- sis he finds 55 percent of its features essentially Syrian. His primary example is Bosra cathedral, which in its sixth century form had a central element that could be described as a circle within an octagon within a circle within a cube.5 Yet 3. K. A. C.

Within Islamic architecture its position is wholly extraordinary, and it is generally accepted as the earliest building with architectural pretensions in Islamic history. Dissimilar as they may seem, the Dome of the Rock and Tatlin's tower have a, perhaps surprising, number of legitimate points of comparison. These can be grouped under four loose headings: They are both monuments to revolution, have multipurpose public significance, symbolically appropriate the land, and have similar formal qualities. In considering these four groupings we shall tend to move from the ideological "messages" and functions of these buildings to the formal means through which their purposes were (or, in the case of the tower, would have been) realized. It is clear that Tatlin's tower was consciously intended as the first great monumental project of the new Soviet state. Soon after the revolution-in the first half of 1918-Tatlin was engaged in a variety of ways (organizationally, pedagogically, creatively) with the establishment of a new cultural life. An important task entrusted to him by Anatolii Lunacharskii, the commissar for enlightenment, was the organization-at Lenin's urging-of a scheme of "mon- umental propaganda" in Moscow: the setting up of several dozen monuments to heroic and enlightened figures of the past according to the Soviet canon. Most of these memorials, by now long vanished, were portrait statues, conventional in taste, cheap in materials, and shoddy in workmanship. No doubt disheartened by this ambience, Tatlin himself turned to work on a "monument without a beard" (Vladimir Maiakovskii's phrase), one fitting to the new century and the new order, a "symbol of the epoch ... a kind of synthesis of art and life."6 This monument, dedicated to the revolution itself, was the first embodiment of the project for the tower. It was described at some length by the critic Nikolai Punin-a close colleague of Tatlin's-in March 1919 (it is interesting that, while Punin lingers on the basic geometrical forms of the monument's halls, he does not mention its overall spiral shape).7 In the same month Lenin realized a long- held dream by refounding the Communist International; thereafter (the exact date is unclear) Tatlin, "commissioned by the Plastic Arts Section of the Ministry of Enlightenment," as Punin relates, "rededicated" his project as the Monument to the Third International, the name by which it has been known ever since.8 An interesting ambiguity thus lies at the heart of Tatlin's project. It was intended first to commemorate an event, a revolution: In that, it seemed to echo the Eiffel Tower, which was intended to mark the centenary of the French Revo- lution (although built, as leftist Russians scornfully noted, to adorn a trade fair). While the event Eiffel was commemorating was safely part of history and its revolutionary potential exhausted, Tatlin's had only just occurred-was, in fact, still in the making. The rededication to the Third International added a future 5. Creswell and van Berchem, Early Muslim Architecture, pp. 72, 90. 6. Tatlin's words, of 1925, quoted in memoirs of A.

This "future-orientated" function of the monument (surely in itself rather remarkable) is splendidly symbolized, as it seems to me, in its overall "open" quality, in the way its great spirals move toward, but do not attain, a meeting place in the sky. The often-noted dynamism of the tower's overall form, its central element inclined as if to suggest a striding figure (among several possible sources for this effect, Robert Delaunay's painterly deformations of the Eiffel Tower in several works of the 1910s must have played a leading role) again indicates the theme of a monument to future strivings as well as past achievements. The Islamic revolution-as radical in a late-antique context as that of the Bolsheviks was in our own century-had to wait longer for its monument. Sixty- odd years of militant Islamic expansion and difficult consolidation produced not only no monumental architecture, but, so far as we are aware, no buildings of any aesthetic pretensions at all. Whatever the reasons-Islamic puritanism with regard to artistic ostentation, the Arabs' nomadic heritage, their diffident reluctance to enter into competition with the Greco-Roman and Iranian worlds in a field where past achievements were so awe inspiring or any other-the tardy inauguration of Islamic architecture with so sumptuous and ambitious a building as the Dome of the Rock, in so challengingly conspicuous (indeed sacrosanct) a location, was indeed startling. There are no reliable contemporary records as to why it was at that time, at that spot, and in that form that Abd al-Malik founded the dome; but there have been plenty of subsequent, often divergent, explanations. Its purposes, as we shall see, were undoubtedly multiple; but one of them, and probably the most important, was to be a visual symbol of the overwhelming Islamic victory over Christians and Jews, at the heart of the city that was sacred to all three faiths. Its location on Mount Moriah within the temple site defied the Christian prophecy that had kept the area a wasteland for the previous six centuries, but it had the added and greater significance of strong traditional association with Abraham, the figure equally revered by all three "peoples of the Book," a symbol indeed of what they had in common rather than of what divided them.9 The Islamic revo- lution, in other words, showed in its first monument the intention not of obliter- ating, but of superseding and absorbing the older culture; mutatis mutandis, the same could be said of the Marxist-Bolshevik revolutionaries (and emphatically of such a figure as Tatlin) after 1917. For all that the dome is, first of all, a sort of tropaeum, a monument to a victory10-but (like Tatlin's Tower) a continuing victory or conquest, whose 9. There is a further association of the site in Hebrew lore with Adam and the creation of man: Grabar, Formation, p. 53. It is worth mentioning in this context the remarkable and provocative theory of the origin of Islam put forward in Patricia Crone and Michael Cook, Hagarism (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1977). This work views early Islam as an offshoot of Judaism, bent on the physical recovery of the Holy Land. The theory has been vigorously challenged, though the evidence cannot be ignored. If correct the theory tends to strengthen my interpretations of the signifi- cance of the Dome of the Rock; for it is precisely to the reign of Abd al-Malik that Crone and Cook date the emergence of "Islam as we know it," to which indeed the dome's inscription bears vital testimony (Hagarism, pp. 29-30). 10. Grabar, Formation, p. 45.</page><page sequence="6">44 Slavic Review meaning resided in its dynamism. The triumphal quality of the dome's message emerges in visual form from its great mosaic decoration. This is remarkable for already exemplifying the "even covering of the field," which, as Creswell put it, is "the basic principle of Muslim art";"1 yet out of a semiabstract plethora of late- antique stylized decorative motifs emerge the unmistakable forms of Christian and Sassanian-Persian regalia, encircling the central area of the building. Like the arms of the defeated warriors displayed on a tropaeum, these are (as Grabar has finely demonstrated) symbolic "trophies" of conquest and submission.'2 (It is a curious, though perhaps accidental, fact that the Dome of the Rock's silhouette bears a more than passing resemblance to that of the greatest surviving example of a Roman tropaeum, at Adamclise in modern Romania). The dome, however, was a tropaeum turned outside-in; where the Tropaeum Traianum at Adamclise had merely a rubble core and bore its symbols on its periphery, the dome invites one to enter and to move about in order to absorb its several messages. The concept of a monument that was to be essentially dynamic in its assymetry, its formal "uncompletedness," and its built-in mobility'3 is unusual enough, but the innovatory quality of Tatlin's Tower goes further still. It was to be no "dead" monument, but one that hummed with life. Its revolving halls were to fulfill a variety of public functions, and the whole was to act as the nerve center of the very thing it was "commemorating": the international aspect of the new revolutionary order. Above all it was to be a focus-the chief focus in the world-for verbal and written communications: It would be the gathering point for information and would, in turn, disseminate news and slogans (in part through giant projectors beamed upon the clouds). Its significance was to be neither narrowly Russian nor Bolshevik: In Milner's apt phrases, it would be a 'social alembic," like the International itself that "embodies an aspiration towards the unity of mankind sharing the sphere of the earth."'"" Milner also rightly stresses the role of the poet Khlebnikov, Tatlin's friend and colleague, in forming his thought world: The concept of an abstract yet anthropomorphic, "living" monument, a spiritual world center, symbolically bridging past and future, earth and heaven, conveying both visual and verbal messages, putting to rights the fatal legacy of its mythical predecessor, the Tower of Babel, by overcoming the linguistic and spiritual divisions between peoples-all this has a distinctly Khlebnikovian ring.

Much has been written about the mobile aspect of the halls within the tower: in particular, their rotation at set speeds (of a year, a month, and a day) has been noted by commentators as giving it the functions of a cosmic "clock." (In this connection it is not entirely frivolous to note that the Dome of the Rock constitutes a massive sundial-this is made evident in an aerial view of the site such as that reproduced in Grabar, Formation, plate 4.) More subtly Milner points out that the tower's rotating elements would set up a "mobile relationship" with the spirals, resembling a "vast screw turning" (Tatlin and the Russian Avant-Garde, p. 155). The reader will readily appreciate that this aspect brings a whole set of new associations into play. Suffice it here to mention a literary analogue: the futurist poet Maiakovskii's surrealistic vision of a city that "stands on a single screw/all electro-dynamo-mechanical" in his poem 150,000,000 (composed in 1919). 14.

(It is worth noting that Khlebnikov was intensely interested in, and had-like Tatlin- firsthand knowledge of the Islamic world.)'7 As the first great architectural embodiment of this idea the Dome of the Rock had, like the tower, multiple public and ideological functions, in which propoganda not only through images, but also through language played an unusual and crucial role. It too is a building that is given sense through human movement (its floor space, after all, consists primarily of two ambulatories). Those who were to move through it were not only the Muslim faithful, but also representatives of all three great religions of the area, "people of the Book," and to them the building "spoke" directly through the most original feature of its decoration: an immense inscription, 240 meters long, encircling the inner octagon and the drum, consisting of (largely) Koranic quotations (the first such datable inscription, and the earliest instance of what was to become a ubiquitous phenomenon in Islamic art, whose historical impor- tance hardly needs stressing). The texts chosen are not those that would subse- quently become usual for religious buildings, and Grabar has convincingly dem- onstrated that the inscription has an "international" aim and a double implication: "On the one hand, it has a missionary character: it is an invitation, and rather an impatient one, to 'submit' to the new and final faith, which accepts Christ and the Hebrew prophets among its forerunners; at the same time it is an assertion of the superiority and strength of the new faith and the state based on it."18 To the dome's "triumphalist" purposes as a tropaeum, discussed earlier, must therefore be added theological and propagandistic ones and even the intention that (like the great buildings of Christendom) it should be the object of aesthetic admira- tion and wonderment, a lure to unbelievers. Press, 1985 are valuable anthologies of Khlebnikov in English, including futuristic architectural proj- ects that may well have influenced Tatlin. Of course, Tatlin may also have drawn on other written sources, particularly in the Utopian literature of the period (some of which Milner mentions). An interesting comparison, neglected by commentators, may be made with the prose-poem The Tower (published 1917) by the proletarian writer Aleksei Gastev. Other early Soviet monumental towers (notably Iakulev's) and such a scheme as the Bauhaus Cathedral of Socialism open up a broad related field. 16. Joseph Schacht and Clifford Boswell, eds., The Legacy of Islam, 2nd ed. (Oxford: Clarendon, 1974), p. 249. 17. In this study I have avoided questions (at present unanswerable) of any direct influence from the concepts of Islamic art-or indeed from such individual monuments as the Dome of the Rock-on Tatlin's aesthetic. It is quite likely that Islam's characteristic aniconism and suspicion of gratuitous artistic display would have met with Tatlin's sympathy, as would its medievally synthetic attitude to architecture (and, more generally, the uncompromising wholeness, purity, and self-sufficiency of its world view). Moreover Islamic buildings provide many examples of the impressive use of simple geometrical forms. Indeed it has long been usual for commentators on the tower to cite one such structure-the minaret of the ninth century Great Mosque at Samarra near Baghdad-as an ana- logue for the tower. This minaret (and another at the nearby Abu Dulaf mosque) is an impressive conical spiral; it is sometimes, though inaccurately, called a ziggurat (it is doubtful that it derives from Babylonian ziggurat architecture). More interesting still (though neglected by the commentators) is the minaret of the Mosque of Ibn Tulun in Cairo (A.D. 876), where a spiral element is combined with stories of various basic geometrical shapes (cube, cylinder, polygon, hemisphere) such as we meet with in the halls of the tower. Egypt was among the countries Tatlin visited as a seaman in his youth. 18. Grabar, Formation, p. 64.</page><page sequence="8">46 Slavic Review Even these do not exhaust the dome's multiple purposes. Most of the visitors to it, after all, could be expected to consist of Muslim pilgrims, venerating a location (Mount Moriah) associated, as we have seen, with Abraham, the "first Muslim." But from an early date the Rock was doubly sanctified by further association with the Prophet himself, with his night journey and ascension. At an early stage too it was suggested by some Muslim historians that the dome's fun- damental purpose was to become a rival center of pilgramage to the Kaaba at Mecca itself. This idea is hardly probable-indeed for reasons of space physically inconceivable, not to mention heretical-yet the germ of truth may be that the building of the dome reasserted, or gave back to Jerusalem, the spiritual eminence that it had had for so many centuries and turned it irrevocably into the interna- tional spiritual capital of the known world. Standing at a most numinous point of the holiest of cities, the dome would serve as a symbolic omphalos, a spiritual focus for the universalist ambitions of the new political and religious order. Under the chapter heading "The Symbolic Appropriation of the Land," Grabar in The Formation of Islamic Art, discusses among other things the pur- poses of the Dome of the Rock. This chapter admirably suggests a feature of both the buildings under consideration that gives each a quite special place in monumental architecture. All buildings, of course, "appropriate" land (and indeed air) to a greater or lesser extent: In the case of the tower and the dome this appropriation is made physically evident, indeed central to their appearance, in a way that almost forces insistent symbolic resonance upon our perceptions. Scale is an important factor in setting up such resonances, and, despite the fact that the tower was never realized, it is clear that its projected dimensions (outstripping the Eiffel Tower) astonished or alarmed Tatlin's contemporaries more than any other aspect of it. Such magnitude would make the tower's cosmic implications-as a bridge or perhaps ladder (compare the form of the inclined double strut) between earth and sky-almost brutally plain. Yet its implied scale is greater still: As Milner points out, while Eiffel's tower "sits" upon the earth, like a blown-up toy or paperweight, Tatlin's project seems to burrow into the soil or to grow organically out of it. One can argue that it incorporates the terrestrial globe itself as the lowest and most fundamental of the series of "halls" of which it is composed and, so, "appropriates" the entire Earth for the Interna- tional."9 Of course, in growing outwards and upwards it also symbolically appropriates the sky; with its openwork construction it mingles with the air around it, and its truncated, open top is like that of a great reflector telescope, admitting, "trapping," and subjecting to human scrutiny the light of distant gal- axies. It is worth noting that only a decade or so before Tatlin's project the greatest observatory of medieval times, that of Ulu ' Beg, the fifteenth century scholar and ruler of Samarkand (then one of the great centers of Islamic civiliza- tion), had been discovered and greatly discussed. Its surviving relic, a vast sextant, is carved deep into the living rock, linking heaven with the very foundations of the earth. The open circular top of Tatlin's tower also calls forth another association, this time with one of the most original and monumental buildings of antiquity: the Pantheon in Rome, whose enormous semicircular dome has an oculus or round gap thirty feet wide at its summit, letting in (thus "appropriating" and 19. Milner, Tatlin and the Russian Avant-Garde, pp. 175, 179-180.</page><page sequence="9">Tower and Dome 47 being appropriated by) the air, light, and elements. The relationship can be taken further: for (in Wheeler's words) the Pantheon "was dedicated to the seven planetary deities and was in effect an architectural simulacrum of the all- containing cosmos."20 The most obvious way that Tatlin's Tower would have "appropriated" the land, however, was in its intended location. There remains some doubt about this, but there is a stubborn tradition (deriving apparently from T. M. Shapiro, Tatlin's assistant on the project) that its "legs" were to have spanned the Neva River in Petrograd.2" The main stream of the Neva-for example, opposite the Field of Mars, a site that would have corresponded nicely with the location of the Eiffel Tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris-is well over three hundred yards across, and locating here would have necessitated approximately trebling the projected, already remarkable, height of the tower if its arches were to reach from bank to bank. Perhaps one of the narrower downstream bifurcations of the river would have served. Straddling earth and water like the Colossus of Rhodes, in such a site the tower would have represented the very culmination of the constructive process inaugurated by Peter the Great (whose equestrian statue beside the Neva-the legendary "Bronze Horseman"-rears up on a huge block of granite shaped like a breaking wave and half-buried in the ground-itself full of symbolic implications of which Tatlin would have been well aware). If, how- ever, (and a disapproving mention by Lunacharskii in 1922 suggests the possibili- ty22) Moscow might have been the intended location, a different set of associations comes into play: Not only was Moscow by then the capital of the new revolu- tionary state, but historically-from the late fifteenth century-it had been con- sidered by Orthodox Russians the "Third Rome," final successor to old Rome and to Constantinople, and thus spiritual center of the world (might the term Third International have been taken to echo this in a secular context?). A most curious photomontage, dating apparently from the time of the earliest plans for the tower, has recently been published, showing its unmistakable spirals rising up in the ancient heart of Constantinople, overlooking the Golden Horn, counter- pointing and dwarfing the mosque domes and minarets around it.23 If nothing else, this shows the importance Tatlin must have attached to the symbolic reson- ances of its location. The Dome of the Rock is not a huge building, but its monumentality is greatly increased by its relative isolation at the topmost point of Mount Moriah. Closed in upon itself (though sunshine suffuses the central area through the win- dows ranged round the drum), it would seem at first sight to have little in com- mon with those open-topped structures, Tatlin's tower and the Pantheon, that mingle with the sky and its elements. It is a truism that every great dome of antiquity and the Middle Ages can be seen as symbolic of heaven (a "starry" decoration, not infrequent, merely emphasizes the point), but the significance of this particular heavenly dome, and of its relation to the earth, is made extraordi- nary by its situation. Probably the most astonishing thing about the Dome of the 20. Mortimer Wheeler, Roman Art and Architecture (London: Thames and Hudson, 1973), pp. 104-105. 21. Andersen, Tatlin, p. 25. 22.

Through the image of the Prophet's taking flight from that same stony outcrop (whether or not the tradition dates from the time of the dome's con- struction) the Rock and the dome are brought for the visitor into symbolic con- tact. By appropriating into the very structure of the dome this rocky summit at the heart of the sacred city, its builders incorporated into it both a microcosm of the earth itself and a point of contact between the mundane and the supramun- dane. On a more prosaic but politically immediate level, however, we must not forget that this appropriation of the summit of the temple area reinforced what we discussed earlier: in Grabar's words, that "the building of the Dome of the Rock implied what might be called a prise de possession, on the part of Abd al-Malik, of a hallowed area" to be related to the "general practice of setting up a symbol of the conquering power or faith within the conquered land"24-victory and missionary zeal being, in Ummayad Islam as in early Soviet Russia, indis- solubly intermingled. In superficial appearance, even if we put questions of scale to one side, Tatlin's Tower and the Dome of the Rock seem about as unlike each other as could be. The dynamism, asymmetry, openwork character, and modern materials of the one contrast utterly with the static, serene, centralized, closed-in quali;y of the other, with its unforced use of motifs from the traditional architectural reper- tory of the region. It would be absurd to minimize these differences, yet behind them one can discern certain, perhaps significant, similarities not only (as we have seen) of function, but also of the forms through which these functions are realized. These forms, it should first be noted, are in both cases partly determined by a dialectical relation to an earlier building whose form is both imitated and transcended. In the case of the dome the building is the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, in that of Tatlin's Tower, the Eiffel Tower. Both tower and dome lack a main facade, have no special terrestrial orienta- tion (in each case the only important axis is upwards, at a steeply inclined angle)25 and have no main entrance way. Each has an approximately circular ground plan-the "lean" of Tatlin's tower is not as extreme as it looks at first glance, and even the tilting topmost element does not overlap the outer circumference of the great spirals. Fundamentally both are very simply planned structures: a fact that is concealed in the case of the dome by lavish, in part later, ornamentation and in the case of the tower by the plethora of subsidiary struts that support but also obscure the main elements. Evidently for technical reasons the struts were particularly obtrusive in the early maquettes by which Tatlin's project is still widely judged. Various sources indicate that he would have liked to minimize their visual impact. Most remarkable of them is a later maquette (made for a Paris exhibition of 1925) of which only skimpy records survive and which com- mentators, apart from Andersen, have ignored.26 Disregard the framework of 24.

The Dome of the Rock too (as Creswell demonstrated) is a most elegant exercise in simple proportionate geometry,27 also involving the octagon, with its transi- tional potential between square and circle. Both structures make important use of arches (if the tower had been built these would have been particularly evident at ground level). The dome's starkly clean-cut exterior lines (in contrast to many Byzantine domed buidlings) give its silhouette the air of an exercise in extreme neoclassicism as if, say, by Etienne-Louis Boullee. Yet its static qualities do not make it ponderous, and it is even arguable that within its regular plan the dyna- mism of the spiral is implicit: for it is an approximately spiral path that will probably be taken by the visitor who circumambulates both galleries before com- ing to rest at the side of the Rock itself. The classical and even rather puritanical impulse behind the Monument to the Third International is sometimes neglected. It was made explicit in a short public statement, "The Work Ahead of Us," composed by Tatlin and his three assistants late in 1920.28 Here they refer to "glass and iron, the materials of modern Classicism, comparable in their severity with the marble of antiquity" and, more surpisingly, yet significantly, "We declare our distrust of the eye, and place our sensual impressions under control." Maybe all classicisms have within them such a suspicion of merely pleasing aesthetic effects (certainly early Islam had, at least in its public or religious art). Tatlin, as is clear from what such sympathizers as Punin, Erenburg, and Shklovskii wrote, wished also to "purify" architecture, painting, and sculpture: the tower, indeed, was conceived (like any great medieval building) as a synthesis of all three. It is curious, incidentally, to note that a major congruity of materials in both the tower and the dome is the important use made in each of glass. The former would, of course, have employed glass for its transparency, for bringing light into the monument and rendering its inner workings outwardly visible; the latter uses it (in vast quantiites, more than 1,000 square meters) for its reflective power, in the great mosaic decoration that conveys so much of the building's message. Color plays its symbolic part in both structures: In the dome, gold, with its associations of cosmic light, is prominent externally and internally, while the struts of the models of the tower were painted brilliant red. In a perceptive article that was one of the first to revive interest in the tower, John Elderfield wrote of "Tatlin's monumental piece of architecture parlante. "29 (It is no accident that the same term has been applied to the works of Boullee and Claude-Nicolas Ledoux:30 Classical starkness does not preclude but can immeasurably heighten eloquence.) Can there be any other buildings in the his- tory of architecture that "speak" more insistently, yet subtly and modulatedly, than Tatlin's Tower and the Dome of the Rock? And-given the urgency of their messages and the many points of similarity between them-can we be surprised if their voices seem to echo one another through the ages? 27.

Despite the ever-present dangers of anachronism and of making analogies without taking differing cultural circumstances into account, however, I feel that some overriding justifications for the method adopted can be found. On the one hand, it would have been tedious, and for most readers unnecessary, to recount at length the well-known historical events that provide a context-a crucially important context-for the monuments we have been considering. On the other hand, I feel there is positive value on occa- sion in ignoring the passsage of centuries so as to bring into juxtaposition works of art that seem to have been similarly motivated or that pose common problems. Not only may one gain new insights into the works themselves and into one's responses to them-one may establish something about important recurrent human concerns. Here the concern was specific, weighty, and very unusual: to commemorate a victory and establish a physical "presence" on the part of a new social and ideological order with universalist ambitions-not through any ordi- nary monument, but through one that would couple continuing human use with multiple transcendental symbolic resonances. It may be that other buildings in the world fit into this class, but if so I do not know of them. The Dome of the Rock and the project for the Monument to the Third International are each metaphorically located at the intersection of political, social, spiritual, and aes- thetic impulses, of verbal and visual communication, of static and dynamic prin- ciples: It will not be surprising if they still affect us as two of the boldest and most moving phenomena in the history of architecture.</page></plain_text>
