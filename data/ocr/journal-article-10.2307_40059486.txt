<plain_text><page sequence="1">aI LOVE TO TELL THE STORY": BIBLICAL REVISIONS IN BELOVED1 Carolyn A. Mitchell At first I said, aI will not bear His cross upon my back; He only seeks to place it there Because my skin is black." Countee Cullen, "Simon the Cyrenian Speaks" Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed. 1 Peter 2.24 But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him. . . . Luke 10.13 For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe. 1 Cor. 1.21 In Toni Morrison's novel, Beloved, three events, among others, compel the reader to think more deeply about the complex issues of African American spirituality and Christianity. These events, crucial to my R&amp;L 23.3 (Autumn 1991) 27</page><page sequence="2">28 Religion &amp; Literature reading of the story, are the discovery of the "tree" Sethe carries on her back, the brief relationship between Sethe and Amy Denver (the white woman who discovers the tree), and the "Calling" of Baby Suggs to preach. These instances in the text raise important questions about the nature of African American spirituality and religion, questions whose tentative answers address on one level the critical issue of African Americans embracing Christianity, the religion of the slaveholders. The text suggests ways in which this same religion, refigured as heterodox through African American suffering, is the source of liberation for the black community; and through Amy Denver's ministrations to the suf- fering Sethe, the white community's potential for liberation is also suggested. The episodes mentioned above are seminal to the novel because Morrison refigures three gospel stories which are central to Christian hermeneutics: the carrying of the Cross (the tree on Sethe's back), the parable of the Good Samaritan (Amy Denver's healing of Sethe), and the call to preach the Gospel (the ministry of Baby Suggs).2 Morrison, as I will argue, eliminates the distance between doctrine and practice by first telling of unspeakable things unspoken3 as she revises the story of the life of Christ in the context of slavery. Christ's life provides a model for spiritual liberation which has continuing implications for understanding African American history and the impact of this history on contemporary black life. Christ laid the foundation of a liberatory plan that must be activated and completed by us. This foundation is based on the interconnectedness of the spiritual and material, since our role as humans is to contain both spirit and flesh, and because we are bound by and to history as custodians of the earth. Morrison's revi- sion presents a new perspective on an "old, old story" that has yet to be concluded. The significance of this story has important implications for the past and present: Beloved reminds us that the Spirit is still among us, mov- ing us in extraordinary ways; we are reminded, too, that the African American story has not yet been fully told and that a major part of that telling rests in the interpretation of religion and spirituality in black life. The distance between the "standard" version of the three New Testa- ment stories and Toni Morrison's refiguring of them is the distance between religion and spirituality. My premise here is that religion is structured on doctrine and dogma, which is maintained by ritual. Religious belief and practice are subject to historical, social, and cultural change, and are tradition-bound. Spirit and spirituality, how-</page><page sequence="3">CAROLYN A. MITCHELL 29 ever, are the unchanging foundations of religion. Spirit is the non- anthropomorphic God and spirituality is godliness; religion is one way (but not the only way) to express the presence of both in human life. The differences between religion and spirituality cannot be defined to suit all readers. Yet, the premise of this essay is that the distinc- tions are important. Religion is the worship of God; Spirit is God; spirituality is the individual manifestation of God in everyday life and experience. Spirituality creates an authentic relationship to one's own life, calling one to be wholly present in and accountable for this life. Thus, for example, Sethe, thinking she was on free ground, never ex- pected to be apprehended by the slaveholder and returned to bondage. So palpable to her is freedom as life's only real option that she kills her daughter, Beloved. She later negotiates a tombstone for Beloved's grave- "Ten minutes for seven letters. With another ten could she have gotten 'Dearly' too?" (5). Though reprehensible on a religious level, Sethe's actions are profoundly spiritual, given the moral aberration of slavery, and Morrison dares the reader to condemn Sethe for her de- cisions. One may abhor the need Sethe feels of taking life to save life and decry the bartering of her body for a tombstone, but implicit in Sethe's actions is the understanding that simply to embrace physical life at any cost is not freedom. She knows that physical and spiritual freedom are inseparable and slavery violates both. Thus, spirituality can be perceived as a "sliding scale" and Sethe must negotiate her own soul's salvation based on her specific experiences. The paradox in this is that she must make choices where all the options are problematic. Sethe's negotiations are examples of Cornel West's terms, "passionate physicality" and "combative spirituality" (28), terms which describe the tangible struggle between body and soul - not as the traditional reli- gious battle of one to overcome the other, but the more challenging struggle of the two to work in tandem with each other. West's terms suggest the essential nature of spirituality as opposed to religion, where dogma and ritual circumscribe the heterodoxy that reveals the work- ings of Spirit in the exigencies and expediencies of everyday life. Reli- gion is what one "does" on Sunday; spirituality is the extraordinary response to the demands of the unknown arising in daily life. Mor- rison refigures traditional Christian stories using the history of African American enslavement; the reader must understand the concept of the Spirit still working in human life and history as a partial key to the complexity of Morrison's narrative. The first scene that Morrison refigures is that in which Amy Denver discovers Sethe's mutilated back. Amy says,</page><page sequence="4">30 Religion &amp; Literature "It's a tree, Lu. A chokeberry tree. See, here's the trunk- it's red and split wide open, full of sap, and this here's the parting for the branches. You got a mighty lot of branches. Leaves, too, look like, and dern if these ain't blossoms. Tiny little cherry blossoms, just as white. Your back got a whole tree on it. In bloom. What God have in mind, I wonder. ..." (79) Amy prefaces her "reading" of Sethe's back with the words, "Come here, Jesus" (79). Her words link Sethe's tree to the cross of Christ, calling him to come and witness. If Christ's cross represents the sins of humankind, then Sethe's cross represents the sins of slavery. Since Sethe "carries" the cross, she is Christ. Morrison, in this narrative moment, redefines transubstantiation, making it more than the trans- formation of bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ, the ritual celebration of the Last Supper, as I suggest below.4 The tree on Sethe's back unites the literal and figurative meaning of this com- memoration, reminding us that the ritual is empty without are-memory" (Morrison's own refrain used throughout the novel) of the suffer- ing. Spiritual re-memory is acute for Sethe, whose pain physically re-members that of Christ. Her carrying the cross is different from that depicted in religious ritual because Sethe is "real" and both her spirit and body are permanently wounded. Amy's invocation, "Come here, Jesus," is a signal that she is a witness calling Jesus to see his cross reincarnated in and on Sethe. It is also Amy's involuntary invitation to the Christ-spirit to indwell in her as she aids Sethe. As I show later, Amy's action is the means by which she transcends the mores of the slavocracy that have tainted her life, too. Morrison re-positions the journey to Calvary in the historical present, implying that the cross is carried by some humans as long as suffering exists. The conflation of Christ-life / human-life as a con- tinuum is therefore suggested. Sethe's Calvary will be to murder her daughter, Beloved, for she certainly did die figuratively in her attempt to give Beloved life. In both instances, death is the price paid for free- dom. This interpretation presents Christ's suffering as the suffering of a woman, conflating the two. Traditionally, the relevance of the Christ life to the lives of women is so circumscribed by canonical in- terpretation that Mary Daly, the feminist theologian, eliminates Jesus as a useful, relevant model for women. Daly writes: The qualities that Christianity idealizes, especially for women, are also those of a victim: sacrificial love, passive acceptance of suffering, humility, meekness, etc. Since these are the qualities idealized in Jesus "who died for our sins," his functioning as a model reinforces the scapegoat syndrome for women. Given the victimized situation of the female in sexist society, these "virtues" are hardly</page><page sequence="5">CAROLYN A. MITCHELL 31 the qualities that women should be encouraged to have. Moreover, since women cannot be "good" enough to measure up to this ideal, and since all are by sexual definition alien from the male savior, this is an impossible model. Thus doomed to failure even in emulating the Victim, women are plunged more deeply into victimization. (77) Daly's thoughts prompt me to consider the ways in which African Americans claim Christianity, suggesting new possibilities for doctrinal interpretation. Contrary to Mary Daly's critique is the fact that for Sethe, an African American woman virtually broken by slavery, "emulating the Victim" is not the issue. Sethe is the victim; the cross she carries is at the same time literal and figurative. Her pain is both enactment and re- enactment, the merging of present and past action, the price paid now by Sethe, embodying the price paid then by Christ. This is what I mean by transubstantiation. Two significant issues are evident here. One is the "materializing" of transubstantiation in the tree brutally whipped into Sethe's back. The other is the co-joining of Sethe and Amy Denver into a community of two, both now realized as the Christ who "lives and dies" anew in each moment of human suffering. Sethe and Amy are linked in different, but common sufferings; their brief bond renews the Christ life as the life of woman, two lives in which the horrors of racism and sexism meld, providing them both with the opportunity for transcendence. Amy speaks to the extent of Sethe's beating by com- menting on her own beating, thus joining female experiences - poor white to poor slave, the example of transcending the slavocracy men- tioned earlier. Amy says, "Your back got a whole tree on it. In bloom. What God have in mind, I wonder. / had me some whippings, but I don't remember nothing like this. Mr. Buddy had a right evil hand too. Whip you for looking at him straight. Sure would. I looked right at him one time and he hauled off and threw the poker at me. Guess he knew what I was a- thinking." (79, emphasis mine) Another way, therefore, to look at Mary Daly's problems with the "Vic- tim" and victimization is to remember that in embodying suffering, Christians embody Christ who then becomes for them more than an abstraction. Taken from the perspective of an African American woman like Sethe, this embodiment is not symbolic, but literal. Though doc- trine teaches us to believe that the historical Christ was male and fully realized as depicted in the Gospels, reviewing this text through Mor- rison's artistic eye allows a broader spiritual reinterpretation which enhances the orthodox religious interpretation. Yet, doctrinal revision is central to Beloved because the fictional</page><page sequence="6">32 Religion &amp; Literature rendering of African American historical struggle conflates the secular and the sacred, a tradition that shapes significant moments in black life. Since Sethe is a slave and her suffering is uniquely female - she is robbed of her baby's milk by schoolteacher's nephews, who force her to suckle them - she bears the twin crosses of racism and sexism. The "cross" on her back gains additional significance as she recounts her story for Paul D, one of the slaves from the plantation, Sweet Home, where schoolteacher is overseer. Sethe says, "After I left you, those boys came in there and took my milk. That's what they came in there for. Held me down and took it. I told Mrs. Garner [the mistress of Sweet Home] on em. She had that lump and couldn't speak but her eyes rolled out tears. Them boys found out I told on em. Schoolteacher made one open up my back, and when it closed it made a tree. It grows there still." "They used cowhide on you?" "And they took my milk." "They beat you and you was pregnant?" "And they took my milk!" (16-17) Paul D is fixated on the fact that Sethe was whipped, even though she was pregnant; Sethe, herself, is more focused on the violation of that which is the center of her femaleness/womanness - the theft of her milk. This theft is testament to how little the humanity of the slave woman and her child are valued. Yet, schoolteacher will punish the nephew responsible for scarring Sethe so badly because he has de- stroyed property and she is damaged goods, proof of which (according to schoolteacher) is in the murder of Beloved (149-51). What I inter- pret as an example of "combative spirituality" he interprets as canni- balism, justifying to himself the "moral discipline" of slavery. Ironi- cally, the contradictions in his assessment of Sethe's lack of humanity are lost on him.5 The tree on Sethe's back is the physical re-memory of her suffering, as well as that of her people. This tree is intended to help the reader understand why Beloved's death at her mother's hand is preferable to bondage. As Sethe so poignantly says to Paul D years later, "It grows there still" (17), suggesting again the Christ- human continuum of suffering. Amy Denver is Christ, too; like Sethe, her life is not an emulation, but an embodiment of his. She is the Good Samaritan whose atten- tion to the victim robbed and abandoned by the roadside earned him a place in biblical history. Amy does not falter when called to aid and abet a fugitive slave, or touch a mutilated black woman, or bring new black life into the world. She drags Sethe back to life, using spider- webs to ease her back, massaging circulation into her damaged feet,</page><page sequence="7">CAROLYN A. MITCHELL 33 and delivering her baby. Proactive Christianity provides the tension that undercuts passive emulation and dissimulation. Amy's religion is eminently present, representing her sense of urgency and agency. Sethe owes her life to Amy, who is irreversibly linked to black life, both through her own suffering and through her surname, Denver, which the grateful Sethe gives to her newborn daughter. Sethe's suffering is the site of renewal for Amy - a white woman who strikes an effective blow against slavery. Her action is another reason why Sethe knows the potential value of freedom, represented here in a healing touch and in human interaction with a white woman, who extends "lovingkindness," actively accepting the challenge of the Christ example in her life. The reasons why Amy is in flight are curious. On one level her journey to Boston to purchase velvet seems frivolous when compared to Sethe's quest for freedom. Yet, one of Morrison's strengths as a storyteller lies in her ability to suggest plausibility in a vignette such as this. Since Amy is the link between life and death for Sethe, the reader intuits that she must want more for herself than velvet because she gives so unstintingly to Sethe. She is not superficial, though her chatter may suggest this. Amy's life is circumscribed by gender and class, just as Sethe's is by gender and race. Though Amy seems to move more freely than Sethe, Morrison invites us to consider the ways in which Amy's life as a single, young white woman, a fugitive from indentured servitude, is comparable to (but not the same as) Sethe's. Morrison is positively lyrical in her description of the com- monality between Sethe and Amy: On a riverbank in the cool of a summer evening two women struggled under a shower of silvery blue. They never expected to see each other again in this world and at the moment couldn't care less. But there on a summer night sur- rounded by bluefern they did something together appropriately and well. A pateroller passing would have sniggered to see two throw-away people, two lawless outlaws - a slave and a barefoot whitewoman with unpinned hair- wrapping a ten-minute-old baby in the rags they wore. But no pateroller came and no preacher. The water sucked and swallowed itself beneath them. There was nothing to disturb them at their work. So they did it appropriately and well. (84-85)6 Amy's quest for velvet makes sense in the context of a Spirit which prompts her to action that is not "normal" for a white woman of her time. We simply cannot account logically for Amy Denver's fixation on velvet, but we do know that this fixation represents freedom for her. The important point is her decision to go to Boston in the first</page><page sequence="8">34 Religion &amp; Literature place. The ability to move from bondage to freedom is what Amy and Sethe have in common. On this manifestation of courage to step out in faith rests the mutuality in which we see them literally refigured as female Christs. Toni Morrison slips into Beloved a refiguration from the story of Huckleberry Finn and Jim, the runaway slave, floating down the Mississippi River on the raft. Amy, however, is going East to Boston in search of velvet and all it connotes - not West to the territory, like Huck. The conflation of the two stories is suggested in Morrison's description of Sethe and Amy on the river, in Amy's innate sense of moral and ethical values which parallel Huck's decision to stand by Jim even though Huck believes he will go to hell, and in the spunk and determination of character reflected in Amy's parting words to Sethe:7 Twilight came on and Amy said she had to go; that she wouldn't be caught dead in daylight on a busy river with a runaway. After rinsing her hands and face in the river, she stood and looked down at the baby wrapped and tied to Sethe's chest. "She's never gonna know who I am. You gonna tell her? Who brought her into this here world?" She lifted her chin, looked off into the place where the sun used to be. "You better tell her. You hear? Say Miss Amy Denver. Of Boston." (85) Going to Boston to buy velvet is a trope for female adventure, for the rite of passage, for the realization of larger aspirations. The fact that rites of passage turn on moral/ethical dilemmas as well as on physical adversity is important, and Amy passes both tests. Baby Suggs is Sethe's mother-in-law and though "uncalled, unrobed, and unanointed" (87) she preaches after answering the call of the Spirit. Slavery has "busted her legs, back, head, eyes, hands, kidneys, womb and tongue" (87), leaving only her heart. Following the call of her heart and acting out the "foolishness" of the preacher alluded to in First Corinthians 1.21, she collects the scattered members of the slave community, and restores them to themselves by teaching them first to love themselves anew and then to love one another. Baby Suggs gives the people back the preciousness of their tears and laughter; she gives them back their feelings - the first step toward restoration of the human qualities stolen from them by slavery.8 Baby Suggs says, " 'Let the children come!' and they ran from the trees toward her" (87): "Let your mothers hear you laugh," she told them, and the woods rang. The adults looked on and could not help smiling.</page><page sequence="9">CAROLYN A. MITCHELL 35 Then, "Let the grown men come," she shouted. They stepped out one by one from among the ringing trees. "Let your wives and your children see you dance," she told them, and groundlife shuddered under their feet. Finally she called the women to her. "Cry," she told them. "For the living and the dead. Just cry." And without covering their eyes the women let loose. (87-88) Morrison is clear about the limits of religious dogma here as she tells us what Baby Suggs did and did not tell the people: She did not tell them to clean up their lives or to go and sin no more. She did not tell them they were the blessed of the earth, its inheriting meek or its glorybound pure. She told them that the only grace they could have was the grace they could imagine. That if they could not see it, they would not have it. (88) Baby Suggs's ministry is a refiguration of Christ's public life, of his gift of life to the dispossessed of his time (and the model for our time). Though the faces of the dispossessed change, as do the specific cir- cumstances of their poverty, their pain does not change. In Morrison's revisioning of this biblical moment, Baby Suggs provides what the let- ter of religious and civil law cannot. She gives the people the spiritual space to reclaim the Self, which is the God-Spirit that links each of them to their human selves, and to one another. In this, she assumes her own responsibility to be Christ and heal the people. The story of Baby Suggs's ministry is, like the story of Amy Denver's healing ability, a vignette; its fullness is in what it alludes to, but does not say. Morrison chooses a woman to restore the spiritual lives of the ex-slaves, but she models her character after the life of the one person women (in most denominations) are told they cannot emulate in or- dained ministry. However, Morrison suggests that the religion of the called, the robed, the anointed is insufficient to address the needs of those human beings who survived slavery. Baby Suggs preaches "liberation spirituality," Vincent Harding's in- spired term, which suggests the difference between "overcoming" as opposed to "just surviving" adversity. Harding sees the "resources of religion, freedom, justice [as] fundamental contextualizations of our [African American] spirituality." According to Harding, liberation spirituality signifies the movement of God among the people, especially in the African American context of spirit possession kindled by con- gress and communion with others.9 Baby Suggs, in appropriating the authority of the ordained minister, activates the spirit of God in and among the people, filling the void left in them by the prostitution of the Word in the aberration of slavery.</page><page sequence="10">36 Religion &amp; Literature Baby Suggs restores the beloved community, and prepares the peo- ple to withstand the pain experienced in the restoration of Self/self in re-memory.10 As Harding would say, she reteaches the people "the dance of life": they "enter in and out of one another's experience and as they pass through they are affected by and deeply altered by" the experience. Morrison's text supports Harding's exegesis: laughing children, dancing men, crying women and then it got mixed up. Women stopped crying and danced; men sat down and cried; children danced, women laughed, children cried until, exhausted and riven, all and each lay about the Clearing damp and gasping for breath. In the silence that followed, Baby Suggs, holy, offered up to them her great big heart. (88) In dancing and crying until "exhausted and riven," the people experi- ence "the wildness of the divine," Harding's definitive explanation of liberation spirituality. The irresolution at the conclusion of each of the stories revised by Morrison precludes strict comparison with the biblical stories cited, avoiding the danger of essentializing African American history and religion. The lack of closure suggests that none of the stories has ended, neither the biblical, the historical, nor the fictional. The power in non-closure is that the dogmatism of the biblical paradigm is loosened by the fluidity of spiritual interception. The novel self- reflexively aligns with the Bible, challenging traditional interpretations by placing the secular and sacred in necessary tension. Indeed, the narrative structure of Beloved relies on this tension. For example, if, as I suggest, Sethe's Calvary is the murder of Be- loved, then the issue of Sethe's resurrection remains irresolvably vexed and the momentum of the novel depends on this and other physical/ psychological/spiritual contradictions. We tend to forget in focusing on Beloved's death that Sethe attempts to kill all her children. How- ever, she only wounds her sons, Howard and Bulgar; and Stamp Paid manages to rescue the twenty-eight-day-old Denver. Sethe frees Be- loved from slavery, but in the process imprisons Denver, Howard and Bulgar (who leave home to escape the ghostly Beloved), Baby Suggs (from the end of her ministry up to her death), and herself in a house haunted by Beloved. Isolated freedom in a haunted house is better than chattel slavery, but it is hardly an ideal life and Morrison shows us the price each person pays for such vexed freedom. Everyone at 124 Bluestone Road, literally enslaved by the ghost of Beloved, pays an extraordinarily high price for freedom: psychological breakdown, spiritual isolation, and social marginalization. Though buried decently, Beloved refuses to stay buried; Morrison asks implicidy: Who is to</page><page sequence="11">CAROLYN A. MITCHELL 37 avenge her death? Paradoxically, only Sethe can avenge Beloved's death. But Sethe does not succeed in doing so and Beloved's ghost is with us yet. She is the unresolved remnant of slavery in the novel and in contemporary society. The people in the story try to forget her, but she is not forgotten. Morrison speaks for Beloved, her family, and for us: So they forgot her. Like an unpleasant dream during a troubling sleep. Oc- casionally, however, the rustle of skirt hushes when they wake, and the knuckles brushing a cheek in sleep seem to belong to the sleeper. . . . This is not a story to pass on. Down by the stream in back of 124 her footprints come and go, come and go. They are so familiar. Should a child, an adult place his feet in them, they will fit. Take them out and they disappear again as though nobody ever walked there. By and by all trace is gone, and what is forgotten is not only the footprints but the water too and what it is down there. . . . (275) Forgotten? Maybe, but "Beloved" is the last haunting word in the novel. In all of this, Sethe comes perilously close to losing her Self. The cross on her back is no hedge against such loss; yet, its value as a spiritual emblem is not diminished. This is my point: to receive of Spirit/spirituality does not promise the recipient anything except the possibility of more suffering, which describes a thin line between tran- scendence and despair. When transcendence happens, one experiences a moment when finitude is superseded by infinitude. The earthly is stripped away momentarily and we "know" the divine. The suffering implicit in the human condition, as I see it, is defined by the paradox that transcendence is not a stable unchanging phenomenon, but is known in the fleeting moments of spiritual and physical ecstasy and even in the moments of mundane stability that we do experience - but can only hold permanently in memory, if we so choose. Sometimes the only way to know we exist is through re-memory, which is the point of Morrison's novel. The relationship between Paul D and Sethe, fragile as it is, and between Amy Denver and Sethe, brief as it is, are examples of transcendence. The experiences are human, but trans- formed by the touch of the divine. Closure is also precluded by the generational issues at stake here, issues not easily resolved: Sethe's relationship to her mother, Beloved's to Sethe, Denver's to Sethe. The thrice- told story that begins the con- clusion of the novel, the story beginning with the words, aI am Beloved . . ." (210), is a haunting re-memory of the destruction of the African and African American family. Conflated in these lines are the stories</page><page sequence="12">38 Religion &amp; Literature of Sethe's mother, Sethe, and Beloved - intricate variations on the theme of the motherless child. The refiguration of the tree on Sethe's back as the cross of Calvary is one way to look at the idea that the complex freedoms (of consciousness, of spirit, of being) promised in the Gospels have yet to be realized in actuality. Yet, Sethe's suffering does not end for having carried the cross. To the contrary, she will carry it until the day she dies (as she says, uIt grows there still"), in- heriting with it the psychic and spiritual wasteland between death and resurrection, which paradoxically is the part of the Christ story that she cannot appropriate - since she has not experienced physical death. Though Paul D and Sethe have an extraordinary relationship which suggests reconciliation on many levels, his presence in her life repre- sents respite, not resolution. This is what I mean when I suggest that they share moments of transcendence but both of their lives have been permanently damaged by the experiences of slavery. Transcendence allows respite; but while they are alive nothing can eradicate the trauma caused by bbndage. Lack of closure also characterizes Amy Denver's story. We do not know what happens to her - whether she reaches Boston or finds her velvet. Her moment of interaction with Sethe is one of Christian charity, but Amy's act of lovingkindness does not guarantee her a better life. Morrison subtly stacks the cards against Amy and the reader wonders: should Amy actually get to Boston, what of herself she might have to relinquish in order to obtain her velvet. Will she become a prostitute? A kept woman? A factory girl? Or, will she be rewarded in kind for her acts of mercy, her sense of empathy? Last, Baby Suggs's story is equally vexed by lack of psychological and spiritual closure - after all that she does for her people. The reader is left with a profound sense of injustice when the very people to whom Baby Suggs ministers turn on her after the lavish dinner which she prepares for them. Morrison is an astute observer of human nature and her description of Baby Suggs's intuition that her dinner was profligate in the eyes of the people is brilliant. Morrison refigures the parable of the loaves and fishes as Baby Suggs takes account of the disaster that follows her celebratory meal. Morrison writes, 124, rocking with laughter, goodwill, and food for ninety, made them angry. Too much, they thought. Where does she get it all, Baby Suggs, holy? . . . Now to take two buckets of blackberries and make ten, maybe twelve, pies; to have turkey enough for the whole town pretty near, new peas in September, fresh cream but no cow, ice and sugar, batter bread. . . . Loaves and fishes were His powers - they did not belong to an ex-slave who had probably never</page><page sequence="13">CAROLYN A. MITCHELL 39 carried one hundred pounds to the scale, or picked okra with a baby on her back. (137) Baby Suggs knows the people are not so easily rid of slavery's taint (here seen as suspicion even of another black person) as she perceives the community weighing her slave experiences against theirs and find- ing hers less onerous. She tried, but the people are not healed, not whole. Worse, she is condemned by the very orthodoxy that she side- stepped in her preaching. The people do not know how close they are/ were to Spirit and wholeness, and to restoration of the beloved com- munity; instead they revert to rigid orthodox interpretations of Scrip- ture that shield them in their condemnation of Baby Suggs. In this interpretation of Beloved, I attempt to excavate the Christ story from centuries of racist and sexist interventions that obscure its power to renew and to redeem. My interpretation neither denies the problems implicit in the story for skeptics, nor extols the truth explicit in it for believers; both, in fact, might find it troublesome. The point I want to make, however, is that Christ's suffering informs the ways in which many African Americans view their historical (and present day) suffering and Morrison is keenly aware of the power of these views. Through "passionate physicality" and "combative spirituality," Afri- can Americans have the choice to vitalize the Christ story, redeeming an "ideal" Christ from a position of distance and the role of passivity. This vitalization suggests that religious interpretation renders Christ the passive victim, safe and sanitized to preach about, but not to emulate. This is the truth of Mary Daly's observation: "Christianity idealizes" She is correct; the religion, Christianity, idealizes the life of Christ, separates it from us, and reifies it, making it inaccessible. But human life at its most tragic de-idealizes Christ and paradoxically vitalizes the Christ who promises to be present in earthly suffering. This is Vincent Harding's premise in liberation spirituality. Sethe, Amy, and Baby Suggs assume the responsibility for vitalizing Christ in their lives, using their spiritual strength to answer the unforeseen demands of the moment. Their sacrifices elevate the beloved commu- nity as they become - briefly - the living Christ. Whatever we think of the authenticity of the Gospel stories, Morrison's (re)interpretation infuses them with new life. Sethe, Amy Denver, and Baby Suggs each- through Toni Morrison's authorial agency- assume some manner of responsibility for restor- ing the beloved community, though, as with all things human, the restoration is momentary. Sethe gives the gift of freedom; Amy gives</page><page sequence="14">40 Religion &amp; Literature the gift of charity; Baby Suggs gives the gift of spiritual direction. The brilliance of the novel is in Morrison's bold retelling of the three Chris- tian stories, suggesting as she does so, a new hermeneutics located not only in the intersection between spirituality and religion, but also in the intersection of fiction, history, and the contemporary present.

Note Morrison's early focus on this topic in Beloved where Stamp Paid, the black abolitionist who ferries Sethe and the newborn Denver across the river to free territory, who saves Denver from death, and who is rebuffed in his efforts to help Sethe, stop trying: Stamp Paid abandoned his efforts to see about Sethe, after the pain of knocking and not gaining entrance, and when he did, 124 was left to its own devices. When Sethe locked the door, the women inside were free at last to be what they liked, see whatever they saw and say whatever was on their minds. Almost. Mixed in with the voices surrounding the house, recognizable but undecipherable to Stamp Paid, were the thoughts of the women of 124, unspeak- able thoughts, unspoken. (199, emphasis mine) 4. According to Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary, to "transubstantiate" means to transmute. In Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox dogma, transubstantiation is "the miraculous change by which . . . the eucharistic elements at their consecration become the body and blood of Christ while keeping only the appearances of bread and wine." 5. The fact that the overseer is schoolteacher (Morrison's use of the lower case "s" is deliberate) is crucial. His job as overseer is also his "research" opportunity and he teaches his nephews the "scientific" proof of African American intellectual, moral, and aesthetic inferiority, proving that black people are sub-human; he, therefore, believes that he has a justification for slavery.</page><page sequence="15">CAROLYN A. MITCHELL 41 6. The closing stanza of Adrienne Rich's poem, "Natural Resources" is especially relevant here. One is tempted to substitute the word "slaves" for "miners." The women who first knew themselves miners, are dead. The rainbow flies like a flying buttress from the walls of cloud, the silver-and-green vein awaits the battering of the pick the dark lode weeps for light My heart is moved by all I cannot save: so much has been destroyed I have to cast my lot with those who age after age, perversely, with no extraordinary power, reconstitute the world. (67) 7. Huck's tendency to listen to his own heart and to act accordingly regardless of the consequences is what I consider spirituality. Amy's words, "that she wouldn't be caught dead in daylight on a busy river with a runaway" remind the reader that she, like Huckleberry Finn, is still bound by the laws of her time, yet she has taken a great risk. Neither Amy nor Huck seems aware of how generous their actions are and how good they are. They are, however, very much aware that civil and religious law would condemn them. 8. Luke 4.18-19 is the passage that Morrison revises: The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, To preach the acceptable year of the Lord. 9. Dr. Vincent Harding's thoughts were spoken in conversation with a gathering of students in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, March 18, 1987. I am deeply indebted to Dr. Dwight Hopkins of the Department of Religion at Santa Clara University for sharing this tape with me. The concept of "liberation spirituality" was the break- through I needed to articulate fully my ideas about African American spirituality. In this conversation, Harding differentiates between religion and theology, which he defines as Western, academic and abstract, and black liberation theology (spiritual- ity), which, among other things, he defines as African, and as faith in the movement of God among the people. 10. Dr. Joyce King, Department of Counseling, Psychology, and Education at Santa Clara University, suggested in conversation (March 6, 1990) that one explana- tion for African Americans accepting Christanity is that it represented a spiritual alter- native to the beloved community destroyed by the slave trade. Her point is that the concept of African community is located in religions which embrace the sacred and secular, which represents the harmony between Spirit and flesh. Central to this is the belief that Christianity, as African Americans practice it, is different.</page><page sequence="16">42 Religion &amp; Literature WORKS CITED Daly, Mary.
