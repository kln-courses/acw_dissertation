New Haven, Connecticut: Yale University Press, 1962. $15.00 Tourists, amateurs, and scholars habitually note how well Greek religious architecture looks in its landscape-that nature and temple seem mutually enhancing. But few studies deal explicitly with the grouping of these buildings, much less with their relation to the extended site. This is surprising, since the care, ex- pense, and time lavished on other aspects of the architecture suggests that such elemental factors would not have been left entirely to caprice. In his work Professor Scully has attempted to demonstrate and explain the relationships of these buildings to each other and to their situations at some 150 classic sites he visited and photographed with this problem in mind. It was a large task; it is a formidable book, and to it he brought great vigor and inge- nuity. But I expect that his explanations will satisfy few classical archaeologists-though they should provoke serious thought about his many challenging theses, and a difficult problem generally. Four basic themes appear to provide the framework for his exposition: (1) that the sanctuary and its wider environs were origi- nally considered, and apparently continued to be in part, the literal embodiment of the god; (2) that the sacred buildings were surrounded by and oriented toward topographic features of traditional sanctity (the mountain cone and horn, the cleft, and the mound-anatomy of an earth mother-to which the sky, sea, and plain were later added); (3) that the sanctuaries of one god are topographically similar and yet each also expresses his local manifestation; and (4) that the history of this conception of landscape may be traced from (a) its first expression in Crete, where the buildings are set in the body of the goddess, to (b) the Mycenaean sites, where the sacred heights are defiled and inhabited, to (c) ear- lier Greek architecture, in which the previous formulas are subtly modified and there is a synthesis of religious and aesthetic sensitivity toward the sacred landscape, to, at the last (d), the end of the Silver Age and after, when an explicitness of organization suggests aliena- tion from nature and loss of subtlety and force (Roman axial planning follows, repudi- ating landscape, with a consequent involution of orientation). What emerges, then, is not the usual conclusion that the Greeks were es- sentially indifferent to the site but the assump- tion that a complex reciprocity exists between architecture and landscape, an organization of sites as intricately determined as the legion niceties of the Greek temple itself during the best eras. Objections immediately come to mind, and the author anticipates many of them. After all, the temple almost invariably faces East, and Dinsmoor has shown that in some cases the axis pointed precisely toward sunrise on the god's feast day in the year of the dedica- tion. Also, one can hardly turn anywhere in Greece without seeing the "sacred" geographic formations. The author nevertheless suggests that a significant view of sacred topographi- cal features largely determined the choice of site, the orientation of the buildings, and, consequently, perhaps the feast day itself. But his illustrations rarely demonstrate unques- tionable confrontation of the temple axis with the topographical landmarks, even though their appearance remains relatively constant at the distances involved. These discrepancies, however, are implied to be a result of subtle, not forced orientation. And such subtlety ap- pears to be invoked when landscape features are associated with the temple by near-align- ment not with the main axis but with the trajectory of a raking edge or a cross axis, by coinciding with a view from the altar or propylaea, or merely by appearing along a route to or in the sanctuary, juxtaposed with the temple for scale or contrast. Criteria, then, for determining that landscape elements are significant to the sanctuary seem so various as to be applicable to all possible cases. And yet even where the case seems strong, as at Bassae, where distant Mount Lykaion is seen through the pteron and adytum side door from what may be the base of the cult image (also noted by Corbett), the question remains whether the vista is coincidental or, if mean- ingful, whether this oblique view helps sub- stantiate the conclusions based upon other ex- amples, of axial orientation. For a proof, one would require at least equal cogency and like termini in a preponderant number of cases, if not all, but I find no such number in the plates. Like the topographic foci, the several sanc- tuaries of a single god vary. True, they of- ten have much in common, but whether this invariably follows from the nature of the god or stems also from the desire to recreate the character of an older sanctuary, the accidents of appropriating an established site, or some variation on these and other expedients is a serious question. In any case, the situation characteristic of one god was not exclusive, for there are sanctuaries that contain neigh- boring temples dedicated to different gods. One may observe, too, that landscape as- sumed importance in Greek art only during Hellenistic times and even then was over- shadowed by the continued dominance of human subject matter; moreover, even at this late stage space was not actively exploited in temple architecture. But of course the author implies that the builders' use of landscape reveals a primordial and preconscious inter- est in nature whose depth is made evident by its absence in earlier art. It is hard to believe that so elaborate and esoteric a tradition survived, unlike lesser art forms but like some Jungian racial memory, vicissitudes including the destruction of Cre- tan sites, the supposed profanations of the My- cenaeans, and the chaos of a long dark age, finally to emerge as subtle architectural and religious design in both old and new sanctu- ART JOURNAL XXIV 1 90</page><page sequence="2">aries of classical Greece. The maintenance of a tradition of such iconographic intricacy, having mystic and potent sexual meaning not commonly associated with Greek temples, a priori would seem to be the work more of priests and academicians than of architects, but no mention of the proposed orientations ap- pears even in the literature of the Hellenistic period, when assumedly, as a result of roman- tic sentimentality about landscape, the devices of this tradition became obvious and conscious. Writings from this time do discuss the practi- cal orientation of houses, towns, and urban temples, but nothing is said about their alignment with sacred topographical forma- tions (cf. here the excellent review of this book by H. Thompson, Art Bull., XLV, 1963, 277ff., and Scully's reply, id., XLVI, 1964, 119). It is also remarkable that, though many re- finements in Greek temples were discovered during the past centuries, when such subtleties were not fashionable, only now, because of contemporary awareness of sophisticated site- planning, are we able to recognize in them similar niceties of reference to landscape. The classic Greeks were, as A. W. Lawrence so forcefully observed, a rough and alien people by our standards; in the Golden Age they were just emerging from a schematic art, a stage that anthropologists find to be accom- panied by an astonishing indifference to land- scape in present-day exotic cultures. Even if one grants that a physical and spiritual temple-landscape relationship may be evident in some sites, it is not enough, for what the author argues is its universal occurrence. And toward this end, I feel, the interpretations often seem pressed to fit the preconceptions. It would not be the first time that esoteric theory about contemporary artistic practice had been used to explain Greek art and to claim it as an archetype and proof of excel- lence. True, it seems likely that the temple designers were concerned with the over-all appearance of the site, but apparently not in a compulsive or obvious manner. A traditional use of muted accent and a sense of appropriate- ness concerning proportion, visual nicety, and balance, found in the other arts-these princi- ples of design, fused with pragmatic and rit- ual considerations, would seem to be a more reasonable explanation of the free and or- ganic ordering used in most sites over their long histories than a prescribed formula (and the author does in part treat the examples in this manner). The explanation is in any case fascinating and novel, and its validity can and doubtless will be tested in the field. Though exposition of site organization forms its principal part, the book contains a wealth of other material. In fact, it presents a thoroughgoing chronological and topical treatment of religious buildings and deals with a host of traditional issues (detail, ele- vation, and plan of Doric and Ionic temples; the stoa, altar, propylaea, and lesser sanctuary architecture; and theater and town planning, among others), usually as they relate to the effects of this architecture in its landscape. As such, the study is meant to be complemen- tary and ancillary to orthodox handbooks of Greek architecture. The index is a model of excellence. The many panoramic illustrations are especially unusual and valuable; so are the long descriptions of sites and interrela- tionships of buildings, which, like the top- ographic features, the author, with Doxiades and others, interconnects with lines of sight. Each chapter deals also with the character and import of the gods and their influence upon the sanctuaries. An attempt to relate the tem- ple, deity, and site Dinsmoor suggested was desirable, though, characteristically, he did not enlarge upon this problem. The author's extensive knowledge of the literature and the sites, coupled with his in- tense enthusiasm for the subject and a brilliant and creative sensibility, gives his intricate arguments and descriptions a distinct per- suasiveness. And yet at times the presenta- tion can undermine the reader's objectivity. Especially stimulating, but also distressing is his rich and lyric prose, with its ubiquitous anthropomorphic reading of sites and anima- tion of the landscape, as a result of which, for example, Segesta "screams," the plan- ning at Megalopolis becomes "touching," and Kos "thunders."
