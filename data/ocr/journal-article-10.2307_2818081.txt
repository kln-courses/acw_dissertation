<plain_text><page sequence="1">WASP FARM. By Howard Ensign Evans. The Natural History Press, Doubleday, New York. $3.95. viii + 178 pp.; ill. 1963. Frontiers! "My own backyard is full of them" (p. 2) exclaims the author at the outset; and he has indeed made the most of his 8-acre Wasp Farm. Here he observed and recorded hundreds of be- havioral episodes of scores of wasp species, all in the heat of summer, for "high summer is no time for dreaming" (p. 111). These are charmingly told in Fabresque style. As problems arise that seem to call for explana- tions, theories are indulged in (p. 85), though with due caution, for the author holds that wasp-watch- ing is more than "stamp collecting," and he con- cludes that more and more observations must be made before investigators go off the deep end with theorization (p. 149). While marveling at the complexity of insect be- havior, Evans does not allow himself to get into the meaningless intelligence-instinct controversy (pp. 22, 59). When he seems to skirt close to the teleological, as when he speaks of "outwitting the parasites" (p. 69) or "hiding the nest," these ex- pressions may be considered as figures of speech that add zest to the discourse. I have myself a feel- ing for the parasite Evagetes "lurking" about, for in a movie of my own there is a scene of a para- sitic fly at the entrance to a wasp burrow and the first word that comes to my mind in viewing this is "lurking," which implies ulterior motives on the part of the wasp. In general, however, the author refuses to ascribe "motives" to wasps and quite meticulously avoids the anthropomorphism so com- mon among his fellow investigators (p. 76). He does, however, understandably endeavor to evaluate the purposiveness of both behavioral actions and small anatomical structures, which might indeed, as Muller has shown, actually have a use. In the chapter on the "sand lover" Ammophila, a universal favorite, the author takes the oppor- tunity to discuss a number of general considera- tions: (1) the homing "instinct" (pp. 58, 121) or ability to come back unerringly to the invisible nest; (2) memory, or the ability to perform this feat after an absence of several days; (3) the so- called use of a tool (pp. 61-69), as when the fe- male "tamps" sand into her burrow with a pebble held in her mandibles. All students of solitary wasps have marveled at their ability to orient themselves. I have myself seen a bug-catcher come out of the treetops to a point from which it dropped in a perfect plumb line, landing within a few inches of a nest I had not seen. Another wasp climbed with its prey 20 feet up a tree from which it volplaned for 30 feet right to its nest, which it at once proceeded to open. The recent experiments on the biochemical basis of memory in flatworms make one feel that soli- tary wasps may soon enter this picture by virtue of their availability and their definiteness of behavior, as this volume reveals. Tool-using (p. 62) the author discusses conserva- tively. He interprets the tamping action of Ammo- phila in closing its burrow after storage as being just one more pebble pushed into the burrow. The author describes the so-called orientation flights of wasps on leaving their nests (p. 119); how- ever, he contends that memory of physical land- marks is probably not the whole story (p. 121) but that factors of sunlight may be very important M involving orientation by a subtle "light compass," as with honey bees (von Frisch). The author goes on to tell about orientation of another sort, that of positioning the emerged wasps toward the exit, the only way out, in the case of wasps developed in a linear series of cells or compartments (p. 129). From Kenneth Cooper's experiments it appears that it is the larva about to spin its cocoon that orients it- self correctly-but I will not spoil this story for the reader by quoting further. Interestingly enough, the first-laid eggs yield a majority of females. In the tube-inhabiting groups the males would naturally tend to emerge before the females. However, according to the author, in Bicyrtes, a digger wasp in which each callow off- spring is free to leave the nest at will, males also make their appearance "to enjoy the blossoms of white clover" (p. 37) before the females. How gen- eral this phenomenon, imitated by amphibians and birds, may be among the Sphecina the author does not hazard to guess. As may be expected from a person of such long experience (20 years of it) with solitary wasps, Evans philosophizes on the evolutionary changes which wasps have undergone in the 100 million years of their existence. What is the genetic rela- tionship of the different species that "carry their paralyzed prey in 13 different ways" (p. 104)? Is Microbembex, which brings into its nest only car- casses of insects and spiders, more primitive than specialists in predation? Certainly Tiphia, which has no nest at all, and which just stings its prey, lays an egg on it, and leaves it to its fate, would seem to be a long way from the aristocrats of the</page><page sequence="2">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 383 wasp world (Chapter VIII). The progressive daily feeding of the larva (p. 70) may be more primitive than the more common method of storing the nest, laying the egg, and closing the nest once and for all. Many other phenomena are described in the 179 pages of this small but informative and stimu- lating. book. The general "asides," brief comments suggested by the stories, render the book well adapted for collateral, and I may say inspirational, reading for classes in biology. Readers of the book have a bonus in the "Cast of Characters" placed at the end of each chapter, with the derivation of each genus and species name. There are 25 excellent photographs and 16 instruc- tive line drawings. I wonder, however, why the pipe-organ nests have been oriented upside down (Fig. 18). CARL G. HARTMAN</page></plain_text>
