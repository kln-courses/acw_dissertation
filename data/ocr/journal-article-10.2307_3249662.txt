People born in the wooded countryside of Czecho- slovakia or Hungary remember, perhaps, amongst the wonders and delights of their childhood the mira- culously beautiful and poisonous toadstools jumping 263</page><page sequence="2">out of the ground of the forest, startling white balls, and next time you passed them there was, on a pure white stem, a glowing red cap wreathed in or sprinkled with some white matter soft like snow, or having shed it, there was the red round cap -but sometimes it was as flat as a table. There was nothing else like the "fly- agaric" in the forest; when you took it home, its sap drew the flies to it; they sipped it and seemed like dead, but after some time, they flew away. Amanita muscaria, the toadstool, a psychotropic plant, R. Gor- don Wasson proves beyond doubt is the "divine mushroom of immortality". In the most ancient and most sacred Indian scripture, the drink of immortality Soma was prepared from it. Before R. Gordon Wasson, who is an ethnomycologist, no student of religion, no Sanskritist, and no Indian, except those who, more than three thousand years ago, prepared and drank the original Soma, knew what plant it was. "The mystery of the Soma enigma" seemed im- penetrable. It concerned profound experience and sublime creation. In order to create the world, Indra, the creator-god of the Rg Veda, imbibed Soma. More than a hundred hymns of the Rg Veda sing of Soma, "the generator of sacred thought, the generator of Heaven and Earth, of Fire and Sun, of Indra and Visn.u (RV. 9.96.5). The preparation of the Soma juice was a complex ritual, for Soma was a mind-expanding, therefore sacred and magic, drink. In its later function it could be prepared without the entire solemn rites preparatory to the So- ma sacrifice. But it was never a profane drink, nor was it alcoholic. The fly-agaric, Mr. Wasson shows, was the Sacred Element in the Shamanic rites of many tribes in northern Siberia, into the sixteenth century; in the valley of the Ob, the Ostyaks and Voguls still drink amanita juice. From their Uralic neighbours the Indo-Iranians may have learned the secret of the Soma, which the Aryans brought to India. Mycology, anthropology, and linguistics concur in establishing the identity of the Soma plant. The hot Indian climate does not suit the toadstool. South of the Oxus it grows only at an altitude of over 8oOO feet, in the Hindu Kush and Himalayas. When the Vedic Aryans had settled in the Panjab the supply of the mind-expanding mushroom was difficult and substitutes had to be resorted to, possibly already at the time of the 11g Veda. The Divine inebriant vanished from the scene, became a fading though long-lingering memory. The name of the dried plant from which Soma was prepared is often referred to as amlu, the stem. The hymns are silent about leaves and flowers and fruits. It required an ethnomycologist aware of the psychotro- pic quality of the fly agaric to recognize the reason and object behind the absence of leaves, flowers, and fruits of the "plant of immortality"; to recognize, moreover, in the golden-brown color of the Soma liquid the psychotropic amanita juice. Mr.Wasson, enraptured by the splendor of the fly-agaric, illustrates in beautiful color plates the object behind the lauds of the Rg Veda. But is it the physical appearance of the toadstool, the plant of immortality, which they hymn? Is it the cap of the mushroom which is spoken of as "head"? (mirdhan) ? RV. 9.27.2,3 chants how Soma, the conque- ror of the Sun, Heaven's head (divo mirdha), the "pres- sed Bull", the "All-knowing" flows across the strainer. In hymn 1.43.9, Soma is "the head, at the navel of the world, of his children of immortality at the highest place of origin of the cosmic order". This is symbolic language; the navel of the world is the place of the sacrifice. There Soma knows that his "children of immortality"--the gods or the sacrificers--become immortal through him, are ready for him, their head, at the highest level of realization, that is, at the origin itself of the law of the cosmos. RV. 9.71.4 indeed tells of Soma grown on the mountain on whose head the cows add their milk (to the sap of the plant). Here it seems as if the memory of the mushroom growing high on the mountain is fused in the rite preparing the drink with the image of Soma, the head of Heaven. 9.69. 8, one more hymn where Soma is extolled as the "Fathers, raised as the heads of Heaven", concludes the invocations of Soma as the "head of Heaven". Other images too, such as Soma as "mainstay of the sky", as the "tongue of Rta [the "Way" or "Truth"]" show the effect of Soma, the elation, the transcending experience gained by imbibing the drink of immortali- ty. A glimmer of the pristine splendor of the mush- room might have adhered to the dry plants as they were watered prior to pressing their potent juice- the "Bull". It is, however, the effect of the drink and its preparation and not the appearance of the mushroom which expanded the mind, stimulated the vision of the Vedic priest-poets and created the worded utterance, the daring juxtapositions of soaring and primal images of the experience and realization of immortality. Nonetheless a direct reference to the head (Siras) of the mushroom along with the stem (ambu) is made in 9.68.4. In this hymn, moreover, further physical properties of the plant and their transformation in the 264</page><page sequence="3">process of preparing the Soma juice are spoken of. In 9. 68.z Soma is said to become enjoyable (svddate) when he loosens the shoots (updruhah). When he runs across the filter, the god leaves behind the fibers (garyd.i). Thus the entire plant, the stem (amsu; uparuh) and also the head of the mushroom from which the juice is pressed, is depicted in hymn 9.68, while, inter- woven with this description, Soma, the god, is invoked in his transcendental source and also as ritual offering, along with his myth which links his being in heaven and on earth. In 9.93.3 the mixing of milk with the head (mardhan) of Soma, the cap of the mushroom, is alluded to without hyperbole. If, as Mr. Wasson has shown, the Soma plant is spoken of as stem only, it is similarly, parspro toto, referred to as head only (9.93. 3; 9-71.4) whereas both, cap and stipe, are spoken of in 9.68.4. While addressing them- selves to the actual plant, images which the effect of the juice evokes slide across the words of the hymns. Soma, "the head of heaven" is, at the same time, "the mainstay of the sky". Its stem assumes the limitless dimension of the axis mundi. In an essay following the publication of his book on Soma, Mr.Wasson re- cognizes the god Aja Ekapdd, the Uncreate One-foot as the mythical, cosmogonic image of the amsu, the Soma plant. However, the gods have their symbols in visible shapes while they are, at the same time, visualizations of the inner experience and thought process itself by which they come into existence. The Uncreate One-foot is the form of a cosmogony, of an inner experience of orig- ination from out of no-thingness and none, the Uncreate, whence by its extension, into One all numbers and things come forth or are borne by it. The Uncreate One-foot has no dimension. It is the direc- tion from the Uncreate into creation. The "cosmic pillar" is a related architectural symbol. Soma, the "mainstay of the sky" is a symbol by coincidence of its own shape of vegetation and an architectural shape. The Uncreate One-foot is precipitated from and sub- serves the intuitive experience of "becoming". Its direction is from the Uncreate, from the "Beyond" downward. The "mainstay of the sky", however, is a symbol of stasis; though, as pillar of the universe, the upward direction is immanent in it. It is visualized explicitly in the image of the world tree. These im- ages change the one into the other. Soma, the drink x R. Gordon IWasson on Soma and Daniel H. H. Ingalls' Re- sponse, An Essay of the American Oriental Society, No. 7, New Haven, 1971. of immortality, was instrumental in releasing them and in seeing the Soma plant conform with the ex- perience called "Aja Ekapdd". Mr. Wasson links this theme with cognate mythical images of the Siberian forest belt. He also links another frequent Rg Vedic image of the stipe of the mush- room, namely 'the udder' with the breast of the "spirit of the birch" tree who, "emerging to the waist", offers her milk, the drink of life, to the sup- plicant, at the root of the Tree of Life, the axis mundi, at the navel of the earth. His search for the origin of these interconnected myths leads Mr. Wasson to the forest belt of Eurasia, the home of Soma, the fly- agaric. The identity and the home of Soma having been found, 1.g Vedic images now show themselves with a new coherence and consistency. Although not referred to by Mr. Wasson, the image of the Uncreate One-foot, the axis mundi-which carries the six-fold burden of manifestation, i. e. heaven and earth on the three levels of creation -coincides with another image that is its female counterpart. It is the image of the great goddess, who is the Voice or the Word (vac; 10. 1 z25.I). She sings of herself as she carries the inse- parable dyads of cosmic creation, Mitra-Varuna, who are the order, Indra-Agni, who are the creative powers, and the Agvins, the healers of the cosmos. When, in a hymn to Varuna (1WV. 7.87), the singer-seer beholds the triple dyads of creation, the nature of poetry is revealed to him as the "cow of thrice seven names" (7.87.4, 5) a trope for the song itself. It holds the se- cret of creation, the secret of art, the microcosmic equivalent to cosmic creation. The Song, the Voice, the Word, the great goddess and the Uncreate One-foot, Indian correlates of Soma, renew their identity when viewed against the "spirit of the birch". The engram of this primal image subsists in the hymns of the Rg Veda and also in Hindu iconography about two thousand years later when, for example, between the feet, firmly planted on the ground of a post-like image of Visnu from Kashmir, the bust of Bhadevi, the earth goddess, emerges from the ground recalling in shape, position and meaning the "spirit of the birch". Having established the identity of the Soma plant in his book, Mr. Wasson proves the validity of his insight into the myth of Soma by drawing the total image, the primal and perennial setting where the tree of life, the elixir of life, the serpent guardian, and the 26J</page><page sequence="4">eagle are the main figures. By equating Aja Ekapid with Soma, the repeated invocation in the Rg Veda of Aja Ekapdd, the Uncreate One-foot, together with Ahi Budhnya, the Serpent of the Deep can now be experienced at a new level of its meaning--connected analogically with, and acted out in, the Indra-Vrtra myth where Indra, the archetypal Soma-drinker and Vrtra, the Serpent are antagonists in the cosmic drama of creation. Many more implications, reverberations, and inter- connections of the symbols of the Soma cycle are reactivated by the book on Soma and the subsequent essay by Mr. Wasson. The Soma juice was strained through a filter of sheep's wool. It was mixed with water, milk, curds, or honey and other ingredients which considerably lessened its toxicity while preserving its hallucinogenic property. Led by his knowledge of yet another way of making the fly-agaric free from toxicity used by the Koryaks, Voguls, and other Siberian peoples, the author is led to surmise that the same method was known also to the lig Veda. It is peculiar to the fly-agaric to retain its potency when passed through another filter than that of sheep's wool. This filter is the human body. The urine of a person who has taken the fly-agaric is as inebriating as the fly agaric itself. The 1Rg Vedic passages cited by Mr. Wasson are convincing evidence that this use was known. They do not, however, show that it was actually employed by the priests in the ritual of the Soma sacrifice. Two Rg Vedic passages deci- sively support Mr. Wasson's view. The first runs: "In the belly of Indra the most intoxicating one [i. e. Soma] clarifies" (endrasya kuk.sa pavate madintama; 9.80.3). Again, in 9.72.2. the rhapsodizing (mant.sina) priests are spoken of as performing the rite of "milking Soma in the belly of Indra" (Indrasya somamn jalhare yad adubuh). Here a ritual implement, the trough for Soma juice, is referred to. The ritual, symbolic object is equated in form and function with a specific part of an anthropomorphic theophany. Both have one and the same factual base, the human belly as a filter of the Soma: so that "pissing it out day by day, o generous one, you have assumed your most mighty force" (8.4.I0). In these images the unimaginably vast belly of Indra, --full of Soma, the drink of immortality--is the filter of Soma which the Creator God pisses out into his creation; on the level of man, it is the priests, swelled with Soma, who enact the rite of pouring the Soma from pot to trough. There is no room in this rite accompanied by the "birth hymn" of Soma (9.74) for the physical act. There it is a physiological image on one level with the other images in verse 4 of hymn 9.74 where Soma, the navel of Truth, is born. Symbols based on generation (the navel considered as place of origination) and urination are as close to one another as the concrete organs are. Or pots are likened to clouds which are milked for the rain of Soma, or, elsewhere, gods, who, in the form of horses piss out the Soma, come as "naturally" as does the image of the thirsty stag by which Indra is addressed to come to the sacrifice to drink Soma (8.4.I1o) But does this genuinely Indian image not, at the same time--if ever so faintly- evoke the "addictions of the reindeer" of which Mr. Wasson speaks, as well known to the Siberian peoples, to urine and mushrooms including the fly agaric? Image and ritual practice are of the same texture, lifted from experience in support of a realization of the supernatural. We do not know with what kind of rite Soma was used in actual practice for the ful- filment of medico-magical ends, as an atonement- and-medicine against dropsy (udara, the belly swelled by water; I.25.I15,I17) or to fetch back the spirit of one who was killed (10. 57. 3). In magical rites the use of Soma-urine may have had its place. It would seem that together with the fly agaric, the different Shamanic ways of filtering Soma became known in India and were practiced. Mr. Wasson has set right almost three thousand years of ignorance about the "plant of immortality", Amanita muscaria, the fly-agaric. He has vindicated not only the mushroom but also the fly. For it is the fly-and not the bee as generally assumed-who betrayed the Soma to the Advins, the heavenly twins (RV.1.I19.9). Geldner, in his translation of the Rg Veda, decided correctly for the fly, though in his footnote he gave the bee as an alternative. Rg Vedic myth and twentieth century European folk practice know the fly and its reaction to the Divine Mushroom. The "marvelous herb", the ling chih of China, may well be, as Mr.Wasson suggests, a literary reflection of Soma. It revived the dead. This is not a fabulous property added in China to the conception of Soma. In the R1g Veda, 0. 57.3-4, quoted already, the spirit ofa dead man is called back to the dead body by means of Soma. Also from India are the mountain crags which flank the many-tiered mushroom plant--the ling chih on the Noin Ula silk textile. They are piled in prisms, cubistically rendered in the Ajanta manner. 266</page><page sequence="5">In a long chapter of the Soma book, Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty surveys the literature on Soma ranging from the Brdhmanas (ca. 800 B.C.) to researches in the twentieth century, giving a factual expos' of the futile groping of learned minds in the dark for the all-the- while elusive plant of immortality. The images of the Soma hymns had their substratum in the ritual activity of pressing and filtering the drink of immortality. Was the image of Amanita muscaria growing high up in the northern mountains fresh in the mind of the Rg Vedic poets so that while hymning the coming into existence of the drink they sang at the same time the beauty of the miraculous unfolding of the plant? A double reference of the images of the Soma hymns is made plausible by some of their confrontations in the stanzas and by the color pho- tographs in Mr. Wasson's book. If Soma-drinking Indra is likened to a thirsty stag (RV. 8.4.Io) there also, as observed by the author, another image, that of the "Soma"-drinking reindeer, seems to be present. And yet, for all those who, from an unknown, northern Asian past, drank the psychotropic juice of the divine mushroom, only the poets of the Rg Veda found the immortal words to reveal that they "arrived at the Light", that they "found the gods". Wasson's identification of the Soma plant, Amanita muscaria, opens up a new vista into ancient India, into the role of hallucinogens and into the functioning of the creative imagination.
