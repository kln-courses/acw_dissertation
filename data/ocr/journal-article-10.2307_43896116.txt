<plain_text><page sequence="1">Solomon at Pasargadae: Some New Perspectives DAVID STRONACH EMERITUS UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY Well over a hundred years have passed since Cur- zon1 and Herzfeld2 each advanced comprehensive arguments that demonstrated that the extensive archaeological remains in the Dasht-e Morghab, "the Plain of the Water-bird," located ca. 50 km to the northeast of Persepolis, had to be those of Pasargadae, the long lost capital of Cyrus the Great (559-530 b.c.).3 Against expectation, how- ever, very little progress has been made in the meantime to try to explain why the site's Achae- menid monuments came to be assigned, not only in medieval times but also in substantially later times as well, to the agency of Solomon. Accord- ingly, I propose to explore a number of different perspectives that may go at least some way to- wards casting new light on one of Pasargadae's more enduring, unsolved puzzles.4 To begin with, it may be useful to review the testimony of certain of the medieval and later sources that refer to the presence of these sup- posed vestiges of a Solomonic realm. The earli- est report is contained in Ibn Balkhi's Farsnama, a work that was compiled between a.d. 1 106 and 1116. It refers to the "meadow of Kalan" (the present-day Dasht-e Morghab) where "the tomb of Solomon's mother" is described as "a square building in stone which no one dared to look inside for fear of becoming blind."5 Of the Eu- ropeans who made use of the high road between Isfahan and Shiraz from the fifteenth century onwards, the first to offer a relevant observation would appear to have been the Venetian, Josofat Barbaro, who visited the site in 1474. From Bar- bara's account it is clear that the tomb of Cyrus was also known at that date as "the tomb of the mother of Solomon."6 More than a century and a half later the youth- ful Johann Albrecht von Mandelso visited the tomb in 1638. He not only completed an engaging, if decidedly free, drawing of the tomb, but he also questioned the tomb's designation. In response to his queries, the Carmelite Fathers of Shiraz informed him with, as he surmised, "more like- lihood of truth" that the monument represented the sepulcher of "the mother of Shah Sulaiman, the fourteenth caliph."7 One other individual who might be included in this select list of early trav- elers is C. le Bruyn, whose visit took place in or shortly before 1706. He, too, took leave to doubt the name that was ascribed to the tomb, asking how Solomon, who was not known to have left the Holy Land, could have come to build such a distant monument in honor of his mother.8 The doubts expressed by certain of the above- mentioned travelers should come as no surprise. To visitors from Europe the main protagonist connected with the label that was given to the tomb could only have been King Solomon of biblical fame. Such visitors would presumably have been in total ignorance of the existence of a semi-legendary figure of this same name, who represents one of the more colorful personalities in the Qur'an.9 Equally, early European travelers to Fars would have been very unlikely to know anything of two intriguing Solomonic themes in the Qur'an (in which the Prophet/King Solo- man is not only connected with baths,10 but also with a celebrated throne).11 Indeed, it could very well be that the Islamic world's knowledge of the six-stepped throne of the biblical Solomon12 of- fers the best available explanation for why the tomb of Cyrus, with its prominent six-tiered base (fig. 1), came to be associated with the Prophet Solomon in the first place.13 With reference to the name that was custom- arily applied to the tomb of Cyrus throughout 1</page><page sequence="2">stronach: Solomon at Pasargadae: Some New Perspectives Fig. 1. The tomb of Cyrus. A reconstruction. After Stronach 1978: fig. 21. the greater part of the Islamic period, it was usu- ally referred to as the Gabr-e Madar-e Solaiman or "the tomb of the mother of Solomon/714 In addition, two other Achaemenid structures at Pasargadae are associated with Solomonic la- bels. Thus the massive stone terrace that Cyrus erected in the northern part of Pasargadae is tra- ditionally known as the Takht-e Madar-e Sulai- man or "the Throne of the Mother of Solomon"15 and a tall stone tower that represents yet another of Cyrus7 gleaming stone monuments is tradi- tionally identified as the Zendan-e Sulaiman or "the Prison of Solomon.7716 These latter labels are all the more interesting in that the labels of Islamic date that came to be given to other pre- Islamic monuments in Fars often allude not only to Solomon in his own right but to other person- alities as well. Persepolis, for example, was often referred to by European, travelers as Chehel Menar or "Forty Columns77 (a name that also carries the mean- ing of "Many Columns77)17 or was otherwise usu- ally known, especially to Iranians, as Takht-e Jamshid (or "the Throne of Jamshid77). The lat- ter name refers, of course, to Jamshid, "the most celebrated of Iranian kings from the legendary dynasty of the Pishdadians.7718 Furthermore, the adjacent site of Naqsh-e Rustam or "Picture of Rustam77 - Iran7s spectacular home to a unique array of Elamite, Achaemenid and Sasanian rock- cut reliefs - was quite evidently associated, be- ginning at a certain remove from the end of the Sasanian period in a.d. 651, with the legendary Iranian hero, Rustam.19 Yet the Prophet Solomon, as a Qur'anic figure who had the power to call on jinn to construct wondrous objects and buildings,20 was also some- times viewed as synonymous with Jamshid. On the illustrious occasion, for example, of a mili- tary review held by Prince Khalil, the governor of Fars, in the vicinity of Persepolis in a.d. 1476, the following description of the event includes an unambiguous reference to this not infrequent association. 2</page><page sequence="3">stronach: Solomon at Pasargadae: Some New Perspectives When the King of the fourth clime (i.e. the Sun) moved from the North to the winter quarter of the South, Sultan Khalil moved from the summer quarters of Ming-bulak ("Thousand Springs") towards Solomon's Kingdom [the ruins of Persepolis]. As for a long time no review had been held of the troops, which measured the longitude and the latitude of the earth, the Prince decided that on this occasion the army should be sum- moned to a parade . . . When the august parasol reached Istakhr of Fars, Sultan Khalil spent one day at the place of astonishing vestiges [i.e. at Persepolis] admiring the wonderful im- ages. Some chronicles say that in the times of Iranian kings this place was called "thousand columns/7 It was built in the time of Jamshid, who, according to some historians, is Solomon.21 SaM I While it is no longer possible to say for exactly how long any detailed knowledge of the name and the deeds of Cyrus the Great might have lingered on in Iran following the fall of the Achaemenid empire in 330 b.c., it is abundantly clear that, when Muhammad ibn Mahmud Hamadani com- posed his Aja'eb-Nameh (or Book of Wonders) in about 590 h/a.d. 1194, this same author was of the view that the exceptionally finely jointed stone structures at Pasargadae and Persepolis were among the works that could be attributed to supernatural beings.22 The following passage from Hamadani's lively treatise is also not to be overlooked: "Know that the work of a genius or a supernatural being is no delusion, and anyone who has seen the province of Fars, and the palace of Solomon - on him be peace! - let him know that the massive ruins and sculptured figures there are the work of a genius/723 In sum, if it is legitimate to equate the above- mentioned "palace of Solomon" with the site of Pasargadae (not least because the "palace of Jam- shid," i.e. Persepolis, receives a separate mention in the very next sentence), there may be sufficient evidence to suggest that Pasargadae as a whole (as opposed to the tomb of Cyrus alone) was already linked to the name of Solomon in the years before a.D. 1200. Whether or not this suggestion is taken to be valid, there would seem to be every reason to think that the Atabaks (or "great chiefs") of Fars lost little time in associating their rule with Pas- argadae's impressive traces of bygone dominion. The Atabak who sought to take particular ad- vantage of the new situation that presented itself was SaM b. Zangi (SaM I), who reigned from a.d. 1194 to 1226. 24 An active builder, SaM not only constructed the stately Masjid-i Now in Shiraz25 but he also took time to renew the city wall of Shiraz.26 At Pasargadae, in particular, he decided to use the still sturdy frame of the tomb of Cyrus as the focal point of an innovative congregational mosque that was completed in a.d. 12 16.27 White limestone columns and other stone elements were brought from Palace S and Palace P to the location of the tomb, where the columns were used to construct a four-sided, presumably once roofed colonnade that then enclosed the original Achaemenid monument (figs. 2 and 3). The matchless white limestone fabric of the tomb itself was not too greatly affected by its latter- day appropriation. The principal change consisted of the introduction of a shallow carved mihrab on the inner face of the southwest wall of the rectangular tomb chamber (fig. 4). 28 Elsewhere, a handsome depiction of an astrolabe (fig. 5) was carved into the third tier of the six-stepped plinth near the south corner of the tomb;29 and, since the southwest wall of the tomb only faced the direction of Mecca in very approximate terms, a prominent protruding device served to indicate the correct direction in which the faithful ought to pray. In a number of Sard's inscriptions from Pasarga- dae he gives himself the unusual title of "heir to the kingdom of Solomon."30 It is of parallel inter- est that the renowned poet, SaMi, who very pos- sibly took his nom de plume from SaM II,31 also makes reference to SaM I's immediate heir, Abu Bakr, as "the heir to the kingdom of Solomon" in the introduction to his Gulestan ,32 Further- more - in response to the prior use of this title by the Atabaks of Fars (and presumably in response to a continuing undiminished regard for Pasarga- dae's perceived links with Solomon) - the local rulers of Shiraz continued to make use of this same title not only in the fourteenth century33 but even down to the end of the sixteenth century as well.34 A Suggestion Advanced by Ali Sami As we have just seen, there is ample evidence to document the many separate measures that SaM I 3</page><page sequence="4">stronach: Solomon at Pasargadae: Some New Perspectives Fig. 2.

What is less apparent is what led, after the brief flurry of SaM's building activities, to an enduring connection between the ruins of Pasargadae and the name of Solomon. In a view proffered by Ali Sami, who excavated at Pasargadae between 1949 and 1955, the Solo- monic identity of the site dates back to a strata- gem that was devised by the local population at the time of the Arab invasions. In Sami's view, the local inhabitants conceived of the idea of ascribing the ruins to the Prophet Solomon in order to protect the monuments from possible desecration.35 As far as I can see, however, it is quite improb- able that the local Zoroastrian population of the mid-seventh century would have conceived of any such strategy. It would seem far more likely that this identity was bestowed on the ruins at some date comfortably after the introduction of Islam, when the local inhabitants would have been well aware of the Quran's many allusions to Solomon36 and when, equally, the local occupants Fig. 5.

The extension at the top served to indicate the correct direction of Mecca. After Stronach 1978: pl. 38b. of the valley would no longer have retained any memory of Cyrus' reign. In fact, one of the few re- maining points at issue would seem to be whether Pasargadae's long-lasting, latter-day Solomonic status derived, more importantly, from (a) the abiding regard in which "the tomb of the mother of Solomon" was held, or (b) from the qualities of the site as a whole,37 or (c) from the hitherto unexplored "afterlife" of still another component of the site that may have played its own consider- able role in fortifying the site's Quťanic repute. Dhu5l Qarnain At this point it is necessary, I believe, to explore new lines of enquiry. Among other issues that come to mind is the possible relevance of refer- ences in the Qm°an to an ancient king who was known as Dhu'l Qarnain or "the one with two horns."38 References to this storied ruler of an ear- lier age occur in the eighteenth sura, or chapter, 5</page><page sequence="6">stronach: Solomon at Pasargadae: Some New Perspectives of the Qur'an, at a moment when Muhammad's opponents appear to have been planning to ques- tion him about Dhu'l Qamain, presumably in the hope of exposing his lack of sublime knowledge. Part of the sura runs as follows: " 'They will ask you (O Muhammad) about Dhu'l Qamain.' Say, 'I shall render an account of him for you. We es- tablished things on earth for him, and gave him access to everything so he followed a [certain] course . . .' "39 While the Qur'an mentions Dhu'l Qarnain's far-flung conquests and his benevolence,40 it of- fers few other clues as to his identity.41 For many centuries, however, commentators on the Qur'an have frequently identified Dhu'l Qarnain with Al- exander the Great. The principal key to this iden- tification appears to lie in the etymology of the term Dhu'l Qarnain or "the one with two horns" in as much as Alexander, who claimed to be the son of Zeus-Ammon, was frequently depicted on coins of the late 4th century b.c. and later with the ram-shaped "horns of Ammon."42 The Four- winged Figure at Pasargadae Also of relevance to the present enquiry is the nearly 3 m tall winged figure that currently stands in solitary splendor in the otherwise greatly de- nuded ruins of Cyrus' monumental gatehouse, Gate R (fig. 6). Given the four-winged figure's dis- tinctive two-homed crown, it seems to me that it could have been locally regarded - long after its original Achaemenid messages were no longer re- membered - as an actual representation of Dhu'l Qarnain. But before various arguments to this ef- fect are presented, certain general remarks about the original setting, and the principal attributes of the figure should be outlined in brief. Gate R - a designation based on Herzfeld's original label, "Palace with the Relief" - is repre- sented by a building that stands close to the east- em limit of the site. It can be deduced, therefore, that Cyrus wished all who traveled to Pasargadae on official business to approach the site from this direction. Among other reasons for selecting this specific approach, it presumably allowed Cyrus to display the abundant supplies of water that the site enjoyed. These included the perennial flow of the river Pulvar on the approaches to Gate R as well as an artificial trapezoidal lake that Cyrus introduced not too far from Gate R on the line of a canal that traversed Pasargadae from north to south.43 The plan of Gate R (fig. 7) includes a large rect- angular hall with two rows of four stone columns that once rose to a height of more than 16 m.44 The scale of the columns indicates, in fact, that Gate R must have originally been the tallest building at Pasargadae. The building's original complement of eight doorway sculptures included a pair of bull-headed colossi that flanked the main outer doorway and a pair of human-headed colossi that probably flanked the main inner doorway. Such impressive guardians were more or less directly derived from Assyrian gateway colossi of the late 8th and early 7th centuries b.c.; and, besides being synonymous with unexampled royal power, they would appear to have very probably provided the immediate inspiration for the still largely intact colossi of Xerxes' Gate of All Lands at Persepolis.45 The presence of two relatively small side door- ways (fig. 7) underscores Cyrus' characteristic interest in making his palatial structures vis- ible - and inviting - from all four sides. Further- more, Gate R was not connected to any perimeter wall: a novel circumstance that makes this build- ing the earliest freestanding monumental gate- way to have been found to-date.46 The accoutrements of the four-winged figure (figs. 8 and 9) are of special interest. While the overarching appearance of the figure is clearly derived from that of the quintessential Assyrian protective doorway figure (fig. 10), only its four wings are closely modeled on the Assyrian proto- type. In addition, the figure is depicted in a full profile view without, quite obviously, the "bucket and cone" motif that is so often associated with Assyrian anthropomorphic guardians.47 In searching for a headdress with various in- stantly relevant messages (in place of say, the tra- ditional horned headdress of an Assyrian winged protective figure) Cyrus elected to employ the di- vine hemhem crown of Egypt - a spectacular form of crown that already possessed a long history in both Egypt and the Levant. The crown rises from the top of a close-fitting ribbed headdress (fig. 9). The splayed twisted homs "are those of the Ovis longipes palaeoaegiptiacus, a variety of ram ap- parently common during the Middle Kingdom in Egypt, but rare thereafter."48 Two small uraei, each of which supports a small sun disc, can be seen to flank the opposed sides of the crown 6</page><page sequence="7">stronach: Solomon at Pasargadae: Some New Perspectives Fig. 6.

Height ca. 2.90 m. After Stronach 2008: fig. 10a. (which is shown, it should not be forgotten, in an aspective, frontal view). The central part of the crown consists of three bundles of reeds, each surmounted by a solar disc and each set against a ground of ostrich feathers. In addition, a single solar disc marked by concentric circles stands at the base of each of the three reed bundles.49 Cyrus7 employment of the hemhem crown has been attributed to a number of different factors. It is perfectly possible, however, that his decision to employ this unusual crown was taken soon af- ter the fall of Babylon in 539 b.c. At this time its display in Gate R could either have been in- tended to signal the recent extension of Cyrus7 realm to Egypt's eastern border or to signal some- thing of still greater moment: namely Cyrus7 ul- Fig. 9. Gate R. Drawing of the four-winged figure. After Stro- nach 2008: fig. 10b. timate intention to add Egypt to his extended dominions.50 The contemporary messages that could have been linked to the figure's mid-seventh century Elamite royal robe (fig. 9) also call for notice. At the present time I would especially like to suggest that the use of this readily recognizable fringed robe 51 could have been related to Cyrus7 intense, if short-lived, interest - in or near 539 b.c. - in as- sociating himself and his forebears with the an- cient, vaunted city of Anshan at the moment that he was engaged in the delicate task of consolidat- ing his power in his last major acquisition: the city of Babylon.52 As far as the overall interpretation of the four- winged figure is concerned, Ali Sami is among 8</page><page sequence="9">stronach: Solomon at Pasargadae: Some New Perspectives those who have detected a certain dignity and spirituality in the figure and such qualities led him to ask if the relief might not represent the "spiritual counterpart of Cyrus."53 In a less ten- tative assessment, Shapur Shahbazi regards the figure as an idealized representation of Cyrus in which "the exceptional wings, crown, and cos- tume each accord with certain accepted signs of royal power." In addition, Shahbazi takes the former, immediately adjacent presence of a tri- lingual CMa inscription (which still stood above the four- winged figure until the 1860s or the early 1870s) to be "a representation of royalty" that af- firms a link with Cyrus.54 Yet as most scholars have long since acknowl- edged, the figure in the relief lacks all Achae- menid kingly attributes, including a scepter or a bow, a long beard, a lotus held in one hand, a royal tiara, or a Persian robe.55 In addition, it possesses wings, a strictly superhuman attribute.56 Also, at whatever exact date the trilingual Old Persian, Elamite, and Akkadian CMa inscription was carved above the winged figure (fig. 11), this spe- cific copy was never intended to refer specifically to the figure beneath it. As Nylander has pointed out, the rules of symmetry in Achaemenid art would have dictated that this same inscription was carved in eight separate locations within Gate R, eight further locations in Palace S and in at least two locations in Palace P.57 In all these circumstances it is close to im- possible to suppose that the four-winged figure was ever meant to represent a formal portrait of Cyrus.58 At the same time it may be appropri- ate to give Mallowan a final word in this con- tested area. In an article published in 1972 he went out of his way to state that, while "the winged prophylactic genii" of Assyria and Iran were not portraits in any strict sense, they were representative of the "magical and charismatic" powers of the king.59 To this extent, then, I dare- say that the calm demeanor of the four-winged figure at Gate R may still be said to communi- cate something of the charisma of the founder of the Achaemenid empire. Patterns of Preservation at Gate R No matter which way the presence (or the ab- sence) of certain elements in the composite four- winged figure may have been interpreted - and will no doubt continue to be interpreted - the figure's most surprising quality at this late date has to be its nearly intact condition. In a monu- mental building that would have been renowned, not least, for its tall columns, its huge bull- related colossi and its towering mud-brick walls, it is quite astonishing that almost all that still remains above the level of the foundations is a single doorway relief from one of the building's two side doorways.60 Further, it is striking that this carved stone block still stands in its original position - and that, until about 1860, it was pre- served to a height of ca. 5 m (at which time part of the upper portion of the existing block was some- what inelegantly removed).61 Mallowan has called this isolated instance of preservation "a strange freak of archaeology."62 But at this point the highly unusual archaeological evidence from Gate R, where almost every other stone element of the superstructure appears to have been stripped away over time - including the long-visible CMa inscription that once stood directly above the figure (fig. 1 1 ) - can hardly be attributed to the workings of chance alone. In- deed, it would seem more than likely that, at some point close to nine hundred years ago, the one still surviving "two-horned" winged figure at Gate R came to be associated with Dhu'l Qarnain. And, once this critical identification had taken hold, it was presumably only a matter of time before a number of the Achaemenid monuments in the fertile Dasht-e Morghab each came to be regarded, together with "the tomb of the mother of Solomon," as related constructions that had Qur'anic significance.63 Closing Remarks One weakness in this hypothetical reconstruc- tion of events might seem to be the fact that Cy- rus is not mentioned in early Qur'anic exegesis. As Brannon Wheeler has rightly stressed, this circumstance makes it very unlikely that Cyrus was identified with Dhu'l Qarnain at any point in early Islamic times.64 It should be emphasized, however, that the pres- ent interpretation of the contrasted patterns of preservation that can be detected at Gate R does not depend in any way on the winged figure's iden- tification with Cyrus in or near the twelfth cen- tury. Since the name of Cyrus had already passed 9</page><page sequence="10">stronach: Solomon at Pasargadae: Some New Perspectives Fig. 10. Winged genius from the palace of Sargon II at Khor- sabad, probably carved in ca. 710 b.c. Height 3.06 m. After Stronach 1978: pl. 188. from common memory when Ferdowsi began to compose the Shahnama in the tenth century, there is no reason to suppose that a conceivably coeval (or slightly later) interest in the figure with a " two-horned crown " in Gate R should have sud- denly sparked vivid memories of a long-distant Achaemenid past. Instead it would have been only natural for the local population to have at once taken special pride in what would have been perceived as a manifest link with the valley's pi- ous past - and for the local residents to have made every effort from then onwards to preserve what must have been viewed as a quite remarkable, still extant depiction of Dhu5l Qarnain.65 Last but not least, it may be noted that the probable twin pillars of the latter-day Solomonic Fig. 1 1 .

At that time a copy of the CMa trilin- gual inscription, reading "I, Cyrus, the king, an Achaemenid" still stood above the carving of the figure, just as a copy of the same CMa inscription almost certainly did on each of Gate R's other seven original doorjambs. After Stronach 1978: pl. 43a. repute of Pasargadae - namely Solomon's associa- tion with the supposed tomb of his mother and the winged figure's very conceivable identification, at 10</page><page sequence="11">stronach: Solomon at Pasargadae: Some New Perspectives least in local terms, as Dhu'l Qarnain - find an arresting parallel in a very different context. To illustrate the point in question I can do no bet- ter than cite the following few lines from Pris- cilla Soucek's valuable paper entitled ã' Solomon's Throne/Solomon's Bath: Model or Metaphor?" The passage reads: Both Tha'labi and Tabari also describe how after Solo- mon's death Bukhtnassar (Nebuchadnezzar) tried to ascend the throne but was struck by the paws of its lion supports, and Tha'labi adds that Bukhtnassaťs leg ached for the rest of his life. This juxtaposition of Solo- mon and Bukhtnassar parallels a statement attributed to Wahb ibn Munabbih by Ibn Qutayba: Among world rulers there were two believers and two idola tors. The two believers were Sulayman ibn Da'ud and Dhu'l Qar- nayn. The idolators were Nimrud and Bukhtnassar.66 In conclusion, it is clear that, while the elegant, upland site of Pasargadae eventually lost any lin- gering connection with the name of its exceptional founder, it nevertheless acquired a new identity that most probably linked it, at least in the minds of the local populace of medieval and later date, with two personalities who were viewed, in Islam, as world rulers of unusual merit. Notes 1. Curzon 1892: 71-90. 2. Herzfeld 1908. 3. Also, an objective approach to the identity of the monuments can already be detected in various early nineteenth century accounts, including that of James Morier. Above all, Morier (1812: 145) anticipated many of Curzon's arguments with reference to the parallels that could be found between the visible characteristics of the "Murghab tomb" and those classical accounts that include descriptions of the tomb of Cyrus. 4.

With reference to the many separate quali- ties of Solomon that are mentioned in the Qur'an, it may be sufficient in the present context to note that he could command the winds (Qur'an, 21: 81, 34: 11/12, 38: 35/36); that he could communicate with birds (Qur'an, 21: 79, 27: 16); and that he was able to summon demons of different kinds, including jinn 11</page><page sequence="12">stronach: Solomon at Pasargadae: Some New Perspectives (Quťan 27: 17, 39, 34: 11/12) who were capable of creating mihrabs, likenesses, and basins (Qur'an 34: 12). Solomon could also make armor and possessed the wisdom to adjudicate disputes (Quťan 21: 78-81). For a more comprehensive list of the Quran's mul- tiple references to the qualities of Solomon, see, e.g., Souček 1993: 109. 37. As would seem to have been the case with refer- ence to the majestic site of Takht-e Sulaiman in Kurd- istan, where associations with the throne of Solomon are mentioned in Persian literature that dates back to the eleventh century (Melikian-Chirvani 2007: 105).

Since the figure faces, quite exceptionally, in- wards, not outwards, it is perhaps possible to deduce that, in a pioneer departure from Assyrian praxis, its principal function was to prevent malevolent forces from making their way towards the inner appoint- ments of the site on the path of a "processional way" that accorded with the long axis of the gate. Cf. Mal- lowan 1985: 394. 48. Mallowan 1972: 1. 49. Cf. Stronach 1978: 49-50. 50. It may be noted in passing that Barnetťs pro- posal (1969: 420-22) that each of the anthropomor- phic guardian figures in Gate R's side doorways could have been intended to represent a separate "quarter" of the Achaemenid realm cannot be endorsed. Given the abiding predilection for symmetry in Achaemenid art and architecture only matching figures could ap- pear on opposed doorjambs. Accordingly, the pres- ent four-winged figure would have originally found an exact counterpart on the opposite doorjamb, and the guardian figures in Gate R's second side doorway would presumably have subscribed to a related but different design. (For comparable evidence to this ef- fect from the truncated reliefs in two opposed door- ways in Palace S, see especially Stronach 1978: pls. 58-60.) 51. Recently treated in detail in Alvarez-Mon 2010: 15-19 and 23. 52. Stronach 2013: 67. For a date of ca. 538 b.c. for the creation of the four- winged figure, cf. also Stronach 2008: 160. 53.

Even if notions to the contrary have recently gained ground, especially in response to views contrib- uted in the middle of the last century by the Indian scholar, Abu al-Kalam Azad. In this context I should stress that Azad's detailed considerations (summarized, for example, in Sami 1971: 181-95 and published, most recently, in Azad 1996) stand outside the bounds of the present archaeological enquiry. For further discussion, and bibliography, see especially Wheeler 1998: 199-200 and Zarghamee 2013: 543-48. 59. Mallowan 1972: 2. 60. As Sami (1971: 74-75) has noted, Gate R suffered "more damage and destruction" than any other palace at Pasargadae. He adds that "not the smallest section of the eight columns came to light" during the course of his excavations. I can also attest that, in the 1960s, almost all that remained of the two winged bull-headed colossi that originally stood at the outer entrance to Gate R consisted of a few fragments of curled hair and wing feathers. (See Stronach 1978: 44, n. 7, 55, and pls. 47b and 47c.) 61. It is difficult to know exactly why the CMa in- scription was removed. On the one hand this operation clearly resulted in the loss of each of the three small discs at the top of the crown (fig. 11) - a fact that might suggest that the removal of the inscription should be ascribed to the reprehensible nineteenth century Eu- ropean (and not least British) appetite for Achaemenid antiquities or to what has also been referred to as the "Persepolis diaspora" of this approximate date. Cf. Al- len 2013: 209. On the other hand, if the main objective was simply to remove the inscription from the imme- diate presence of the winged figure, this aim was assur- edly achieved (even if the stone block was left, at the end, with a distinctly uneven upper edge). 62. Mallowan 1972: 1. 63. With further reference to the latter-day identifi- cation of the tomb of Cyrus with Solomon's mother, it may be suggested that the tomb was thought to have been "too modest an edifice for Solomon himself" (Stronach 2011: 80). In addition, it is possible to imag- ine that there was an appreciation in the Islamic world of the strength of Solomon's ties to his mother, and that there was a keen awareness of an occasion where it is recounted that Solomon's mother approached him with a petition. As the encounter is described in 1 Kings 2, 19, Solomon bowed low to his mother, remounted his throne, and gave instructions that a separate throne for his mother should be set upon his right side. In other words some knowledge of this biblical passage could explain why, with the tomb already assigned to Solo- 12</page><page sequence="13">stronach: Solomon at Pasargadae: Some New Perspectives mon's mother, it became logical to associate the huge stone terrace at the north end of the site with "the throne of the mother of Solomon." 64. Wheeler 1998: 200. 65. It is also not without interest to note that pres- ent-day visitors to Pasargadae can detect, interspersed among billboards that refer to Cyrus and the first Achaemenid capital, a number of signs that purport to show the way "to the palace of Dhu'l Qarnain."
