[Universidad Nacional Au- t6noma de Mexico, Publicaciones de Dianoia, Centro de Estudios Filosoficos.] (Mexico, D.F.: Fondo de Cultura Economica. I957. Pp. 278.) LEOPOLDO ZEA, a Mexican philosopher who has won renown as an investigator of the history of ideas in Latin America, turns in this volume to a study of the relation between Latin America and the main stream of history. Pursuing this aim he is led on to propound a general philosophy of modern history. Zea thinks of European Christian civilization as having reached a crisis in the era of the Reformation. After the failure of the Erasmian effort to arrive at an inclusive accommodation of the conflicting forces in that society, "modern" or "occidental" civilization emerged, principally in England, France, and Holland. The Iberian peoples regressed to a static defense of the older Christian order. Russia, a peripheral participant in the preceding civilization, tried to fit into the new "occidental" mold but was jealously excluded and isolated, as were Spain</page><page sequence="2">7IO Reviews of Books and Portugal. The main values of "modern" civilization were political democracy and the creation of wealth by liberating the energies of free individuals. Zea's concept of the rise of "modern" civilization owes much to Max Weber, his view of the evolution of liberalism to Hlarold Laski. He believes that Iberia, Latin America, Asia, and Africa have been exploited by "modern" peoples who en- joyed a monopoly of power and that the former have been unjustly denied, through the operation of a kind of double standard, the opportunities to develop the free- dom, national independence, and economic progress that "modern" peoples con- sidered valuable for themselves. The present conflict between Russia and the West, however, is not one between different civilizations, but a power struggle between the USSR and the United States for leadership of the West. Zea discusses those aspects of American life which have made the United States an object of suspicion and alarm to many European intellectuals. He maintains a deafening silence as to any possible deficiencies Russia might have as a leader of civilization. This viewpoint must be noted, but it would be wrong to emphasize it, for Zea is more interested in the relation between the rest of the world and the "occident" than he is in the cold war. Man's hope, according to Zea, is the inclusion of all peoples in the new uni- versal "modern" civilization. In order to achieve this end "modern peoples" must give up their habit of "denying" to other peoples the right to share equally in "western" values. If "modern" civilization would give up its exclusivism, the future of world civilization would be assured. Zea owes much more to Hegel and to Toynbee than he does to Marx, though his views of imperialism have undoubtedly been influenced by Marxism. Like all these thinkers, he sees an overlying pattern in history to which particular events conform. This view of the past opens the way to tendencies that Huizinga has referred to as "inflation of terms, stereotypes, and anthropomorphism." The two former appear when Zea writes of "liberalism," "imperialism," and "colonialism"; he uses these words as if they were unchanging realities and to cover vast com- plexes of human social behavior. The latter tendency is exemplified in his use of the term "occidental civilization," an abstraction he suffuses with human will and emotion and describes as "excluding," "exploiting," and "denying." The importance of this book lies in the fact that it presents a view of history that fits in with the view of the present held by thousands of politicians and in- tellectuals from Jakarta to Mexico City, including not a few continental Europeans. When Zea deplores the arrogance with which western European nations and the United States have assumed superiority and relegated other peoples and races to subordinate roles, he is on strong ground, though his attack might be made with equal justice on the possessors of power in previous crises in human history. To explain the difficulties Asian, African, and Latin American peoples have experi- enced in achieving their goals of economic and political equality with leading Western nations almost entirely in terms of Western exclusivism and exploitation,</page><page sequence="3">Zea: m e'rica en la Historia 7II however, is a distortion of reality. It is unjustifiable to omit from consideration, or to brush off as impositions of the West, obstacles that are as much the result of traditional configurations of the cultures of these peoples as they are the conse- quences of external pressures. Though Armerica en la historia is based on philo- sophical and historical assumptions and generalizations that many will find un- acceptable, it is a stimulating and ingenious historical interpretation of the con- flicts in the contemporary world and an illuminating example of a point of view of some importance in Latin America.
