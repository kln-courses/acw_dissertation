PELLA IN JORDAN 1992: CHALCOLITHIC AND BRONZE AGE DISCOVERIES The 14th season of excavations at Pella in Jordan took place during January-February 1992.1 Excavations concentrated on three areas situated along the southern edge of the main tell of Khirbet Fahl (Areas III, XXVIII, and XXXII), and in the Middle-Late Bronze Age cemetery (Area XI) situated on the north face of Tell Husn.

Ε. V. Nixon (ed.) AREA ΠΙ In trenches IIIC/IIID, two main problems were investigated. The first concerned the date of the massive mud-brick city wall that encircled Canaanite Pella. We have been investigating this fortification for some ten years now, and this season, in a small sondage (2x2 m), reached the bottom of the wall on its inside face. It allowed us to confirm its date of construction in the early Middle Bronze Age IIA period (c. 1800 bc). The second arose through the unexpected discovery of an earlier fortification wall, built on essentially the same alignment as the MBA construction, but positioned some two metres to the west. First indications would date it to the Early Bronze Age IB/II period (t\2900 bc). This earlier fortification wall, rebuilt at least once during its lifetime, is likely to delineate the eastern margins of the Early Bronze Age city. Below this two-phase wall, the trenches reached natural soil. Upslope and ten metres to the west of trench IIIC, in trenches IIIN/IIIS, the southern half of a large Late Bronze Age palatial residence was uncovered. The eastern margins of this structure were first detected in trench IIIC in 1980, and the near-complete plan has been gradually uncovered over the last ten years. The complex, approximately 15 χ 15 m in extent, finds similarly dated parallels in the 'Governors' Residence' type of administrative building, although the Pella example is the earliest of its kind uncovered in Jordan. AREA XXXII A new 4 χ 6 m trench XXXIID was opened some ten metres to the west of the previous western limits of Area XXXII, and an impressive EBA structure (c.3000 bc) was uncovered slightly below the modern tell surface. Although only revealed in a small sounding, this appears to be a substantial structure, with 1.5 m thick stone and mud-brick walls. It would appear that the XXXIID sounding was positioned near the south-western corner of what appears to be a roughly square structure, with walls at least 15 m on a side, and slightly larger, projecting corner bastions. Initial pottery readings, rendered slightly problematic by later MB IIB-C disturbance, would suggest a date in the EB IB period for the construction of the complex, although net-burnished bowl fragments found in loose association with a later phase of the structure might suggest an EB II continuation of use. This area needs more intensive investigation, and it is hoped to begin this during the 1993/94 season. Beneath this EBA material, a series of Late Chalcolithic (c.3500-3300 bc) plaster-lined pits and large plaster-coated storage vessels were uncovered, cut into the natural soil of the tell; the ceramic and lithic material has many features in common with the small Chalcolithic farmstead located on the lower western margins of Jebel Sartaba (Area XIV) uncovered by J. Hanbury Tenison between 1981 and 1983. Although there were no standing architectural features associated with the Area XXXIID finds, the size of the plaster-coated storage vessels, and the large well-constructed plaster lined pits, coupled with slight indications of architecture revealed in the northern baulk in the last days of excavation, suggest a sedentary nature of the occupation. The Area XIV farm can be seen as an outlying component of the Area XXXII Chalcolithic occupation on the main tell. AREA XXVIII In trench XXVIIIA, the north-eastern corner of a very large MBA building was fully revealed by the end of the season. This three-phase construction represents one of the most monumental of our MBA residences, and has been under intermittent excavation since 1984.</page><page sequence="3">Recent Australian and New Zealand Field Work 163 The later phases of occupation date to the late MB IIB period (c. 1700-1650 bc), although at least a metre of what appears to be further MB IIB occupational debris remains to be excavated before the primary constructional phase will be reached. Two further intra-mural burials, positioned beneath internal dividing walls built during the latest, MB/LB period (c.1550 bc), reconstruction of the complex, produced storage jars, small carinated bowls and juglets, and the complete skeleton of a large canine, as well as the remains of two small children. These are to be added to the three burials, richly provided for, that were excavated in 1984, producing Black Polished juglets, an Egyptian faience flask, and pieces of at least two wooden inlay boxes. AREA XI In the MB/LB cemetery Area XI, work continued in the entrance dromos of Tomb 106, where the 'Shackled Man' was discovered in 1990. This year's work confirmed the LB II date (c. 1350-1200 bc) of the tomb, and resulted in the recovery of important alabaster, metal, and ceramic finds. Stephen J. Bourke THE BURQU/RUWAYSHID PROJECT The BurquTRuwayshid Project is sponsored by the British Institute at Amman and Edinburgh University. Final research work and data analysis will be conducted under the aegis of Sydney University. Field work takes place by kind permission of the Department of Antiquities of Jordan. The area under study is the semi-arid 'panhandle' of eastern Jordan, including two distinct landscapes, the rock-strewn basalt harra and the hamad, the gravel-covered limestone plains to the east of the harra (fig. 2). The aim of the project is to understand how human populations have made use of an area where the availability of even basic resources can be uncertain. Despite the apparent limitations of the region, it has become clear that it was used extensively from prehistoric times up to the present. Preliminary study also suggests that there is an underlying pattern to human management of the region which is governed by basic environmental factors such as availability of water and vegetation, but which may vary according to political events and economic strategies within the verdant areas beyond the steppe. Three seasons of fieldwork have now been completed.2 During the first two seasons much of our work was carried out at Burqu0 where a natural rainpool, now augmented by more recent dams, has attracted short and long-term settlement since the Epipalaeolithic periods. Excavations were carried out at a number of sites around the lake. These range in date from Aceramic Neolithic to recent times. Qasr Burquc, a ruined tower and outbuildings at the southern end of the lake, was the subject of detailed study, and records were made of a large number of inscriptions in the vicinity. These include modern Arabic graffiti, earlier Arabic inscriptions, and Safaitic and other rock carvings and inscriptions. Work was also carried out on studies of modern populations, and local flora and fauna. Area reconnaissance added to our understanding of local geomorphology, grazing potential, and herding practices. Specific projects included surface collections at selected sites, excavations at a rockshelter near the 2 A. Betts et al., Levant 22,1990,1-20; Levant 23,1991,7-28.</page><page sequence="4">164 C. Ε.

Saudi Arabian border, and investigation of mahafir, water catchment systems, of which several groups have been found in the Ruwayshid area. Following completion of fieldwork in October 1991, the history of the area can now be reconstructed in some detail. Little is known of periods prior to about the 10th millennium bc. Small scatters of geometric microliths suggest short-term occupation in the Geometric Kebaran period around the lake at Burqu0, and later, in the Late Natufian period. The area saw little use in early Neolithic times, but by the late pre-Pottery Neolithic period, in the second half of the 7th millennium bc, the steppe was extensively used by hunters, using stone-built game drives (desert 'kites') to trap gazelle in the harra. There is little evidence for use of the hamad in the late PPN which may be due to the lack of suitable ground for game drives on the gravel plains. In the early 6th millennium sheep/goat herding was introduced into the economy of the area, and, with this change from hunting to a mixed hunter/herder subsistence strategy open country became more useful. The plains of the hamad were used as grazing areas, probably in winter and spring, while areas close to more permanent water sources, such as Burquc, would have been used more intensively in summer and early autumn when water was in short supply. Sites of this period around the lake at Burqu0 consist of small clusters of stone-walled</page><page sequence="5">Recent Australian and New Zealand Field Work 165 huts, with flint tools, bone, and some exotic items such as stone beads, imported shells, and obsidian. Neolithic herding camps in the major wadi systems of the hamad are of additional interest. It has often been supposed that regions with an annual rainfall of less than 100-150 mm were not exploited until the introduction of camel pastoralism, and yet there is clear evidence for sheep/goat pastoralism in earlier periods. The major wadi systems may also have served another important function as they appear to have acted as corridors along which herders could move and still retain access to water and grazing. Wadis run from the BurquTRuwayshid region down to the Euphrates, providing routes down to the river at Abu Kemal (ancient Mari) to the north, and Haditha to the east. The pattern of land use established by the 6th millennium probably continued in similar fashion for a long time, perhaps until the introduction of camel herding to North Arabia some time around the late second or early first millennium bc. The prehistoric herding pattern is similar to that followed today by bedouin keeping sheep/goat in the region, but this pattern has only recently been re-established as a result of economic and political changes, particularly the introduction of trucks for water transport, and the end of large-scale camel herding by the Rwala and other major tribes. Prior to this change, which came about only a few decades ago, sheep/goat herding was largely confined to the harra where the landscape is less suitable for camels. Archaeological traces of camel herders are even less visible than those of sheep/goat herders. Evidence for use of the hamad in later historical times comes mostly from sherd scatters around major rainpools and from the man-made water harvesting systems, the mahafir. Although several of these mahafir systems may have been in use during the Early Islamic period, there is a variety of types in a wide range of locations, and it is likely that some were built in earlier times. The largest of these is Mahafir al-Shahami, just north of the Baghdad Highway. The complex is on a small internal drainage system and consists of ten artificially excavated pools. The pools are reinforced by roughly laid stone walls, and their downstream sides, although now largely washed out, appear originally to have been low enough to permit surplus water to flow over the top and into the next pool. There are two multi-roomed courtyard houses on the south-east side of the complex, which appear to have been associated with its use. Analysis of pottery from the site indicates that Mahafir al Shahami probably dates to the period from the 7th to 9th centuries ad.3 The only substantial building in the survey area is Qasr Burquc. This comprises a tower surrounded by a series of rooms facing onto a small courtyard. Over the doorway of one of the outbuildings is an inscription referring to construction activities in ad 700 by the Amir Walid. Preliminary conclusions about the buildings suggest that most pre-date the 'Walid inscription', which may refer to a reconstruction of standing remains. The outer buildings may be of pre-Islamic date but their function is uncertain. The earliest structure, the tower, cannot be securely dated, but probably should be attributed to the pre-Islamic period, perhaps the 6th century ad or earlier. The BurquTRuwayshid Project is now complete. The results will provide an analysis of the nature of land use in the region from the Neolithic to the present day. It will also provide detailed studies of particular periods, specifically the Neolithic/Chalcolithic and the Late Antique/Early Islamic periods. Integration of ethnographic data with archaeological evidence will result in a fresh perspective on the significance of the North Arabian badiya in ancient times. Alison Betts 3 S. W. Helms, Early Islamic Architecture of the Desert (1990).</page><page sequence="6">166 C. Ε. V. Nixon (ed.) SOUTHERN HAURAN SURVEY, JORDAN The first season of the survey took place in 1985 with a team of five—three from the University of Sheffield, two from the American University in Beirut.4 Civil war in Lebanon forced the suspension of fieldwork by one of the co-directors, Henry MacAdam, and it was not till 1992 that the present writer was able to return for a second season with now Philip Freeman of Glasgow University as co-director. Work concentrated on three areas of activity. First, Freeman cut a test trench across the line of an ancient wall in the northern part of the village of Umm el-Quttein. The wall had previously been identified as part of what seemed to be the northern curtain of a hitherto unknown Roman fort. The outcome added some weight to this inference, revealing, however, a two-phase wall. Traces of what may have been an external angle tower on the north-west and a gate tower on the south side were also noted. Preliminary analysis of the pottery by Rob Falkner reports a good assemblage of Iron Age and Early Roman followed by a marked increase in the 3rd century ad continuing through the Byzantine and Early Islamic periods. Despite the relative remoteness of Quttein and the modest dimensions of the trench, the assemblage included a fragment of a rare Jerash face-pot of the 6th century—previously only known at Amman and Pella. Also present were numerous tesserae and off-cuts (a church lies nearby), fragments of decorated wall-plaster, glass, and heavily corroded coins. Second was the closer investigation of the water-holding capacity of the Roman town which underlies Quttein."Apart from the two very large reservoirs (pi. 51: 1), three large cisterns were examined; others previously seen or noted had recently been filled in. The total water capacity is calculated at approximately 22 million litres. Figure 3. Southern Hauran Survey 1992. 4 D. Kennedy et al., AAJ 30,1986, 145-53 pis. 21-5.</page><page sequence="7">Recent Australian and New Zealand Field Work 167 Finally, though on a small scale, further sites were sought in the vicinity. In total, to the sixteen recorded in 1985 was added a further eighteen (fig. 3). Notable was the scale of several of these: Site 107, for example, mainly Bronze Age in date, extended over c.30 ha and was previously unknown. Overall, the pottery analysis suggested most new sites were of the Bronze Age or Romano-Byzantine periods (pi. 51: 2). Especially interesting was Site 112, a quarry bearing tool marks and dated broadly by two Greek graffiti cut on a rock face. Three other inscriptions—one an early 4th-cent. ad Latin milestone fragment—were recorded this year to add to those recorded or revised from 1985.5 Once again, the fieldwork was underwritten by the British Institute at Amman for Archaeology and History. REMOTE SENSING FOR ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE MIDDLE EAST In searching for additional sites, the SHS team was assisted by air photos. Some had been available in 1985 but they were now employed systematically both to assist in detection and to evaluate their use for archaeological purposes. Partly for reasons of economy, the SHS 1992 Season was made to coincide with the first period of fieldwork of a project funded by the Australian Research Council, to exploit the over 4000 old air photos acquired from the Jordan Army several years ago, and simultaneously evaluate the other remote-sensing techniques which have been or might be applied in the Middle East. This project is being directed by the writer with the assistance of Mr J Raab-Rust as research associate. As far as the air photos are concerned, there is now a finer appreciation of their strengths (considerable) and limitations. That they are old (1953) is a great advantage. Thus, the photo reproduced on pi. 51: 3 shows the modern village of Deir el-Kahf without permanent habitation. The village laps all around the walls of the well preserved Roman fort and has obliterated most of the extra-mural settlement. The fort appears clearly, as does the extent of the ancient settlement. Also clear are the two large reservoirs to the north-east and south-west, and a succession of cisterns on the south-east, all fed by water deflected from the wadis which pass on either side of the settlement. At the bottom right appears to be a dam across the wadi behind which water could pond in what seems to be a deeper wadi section. Running along the left edge of the photo is a Roman road south to Azraq. For areas in which no air photos are available, however, images or photos from space may well be of value in the future as resolution of 5 m and less permits enlargements to be inspected for actual surface remains. In an arid region with little vegetation to obscure remains and where sites are often visible on the surface, this is an exciting potential. There is, of course, also scope for employing predictive techniques to satellite images as has been common in the United States in particular. However, the soaring cost of space images and the cost and level of expertise required is likely to be too great a hurdle until, for example, foreign institutes in Middle East countries undertake jointly the task of purchasing appropriate imagery and carrying out the classifications for entire countries. This would benefit numerous projects which might be expected to pay for such a service. ZEUGMA ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROJECT Over the past generation, many important archaeological sites have been destroyed or damaged by the building of dams on the Euphrates, Tigris, and their tributaries. Five more are 5 D. Kennedy-Η. MacAdam, ZPE 65,1986,231-6 pi. 9; H. I. MacAdam-D. F. Graf, AAJ 33, 1989,177-97 pis. 24-30.</page><page sequence="8">168 C. Ε. V. Nixon (ed.) now planned in Turkey alone, one of them, the Birecik Dam, is to be constructed only 500 m downstream of Graeco-Romah Zeugma. The andient town has little to show; the relocation of a bridge in the area to Birecik in the Middle Ages plunged the town into decline, leaving only a small village today overlying Seleuceia on the west bank and another on its twin, Apamea, on the east bank (pi. 51: 4). " The town, however, is large—at some 300 ha, several times the size of Pompeii and double the size of Roman London. Finds over the years have included hundreds of inscriptions, statuary (including now a life-size bronze statue), thousands of coins and scores of the stamped tiles bearing the name of the Legio III Scythica whose fortress lay beside the town. Most revealing of the prosperity of the town, however, are the mosaics. Parts of a particularly fine example found many years ago are now in the Hermitage in St Petersburg and in the State Museum in Berlin.6 Another, discovered only in 1992, is a superb scene of Dionysus and Ariadne, 7 χ 3.5 m, and comparable in quality to the best at Antioch. Sheila Campbell has provisionally dated it to the Late Antonine period.7 With the dam due for completion in 1998, there is still time to salvage something of the site and explore the vicinity. A preliminary season is planned for late 1993 with major seasons envisaged from 1994 onwards. David Kennedy David Kennedy EXCAVATIONS AT TELL NEBI MEND, SYRIA Tell Nebi Mend, ancient Qadesh-on-the-Orontes, is a large and historically important site strategically located at the confluence of the Orontes and one of its tributaries, the Mukadiyah, in western Syria. As the scene of the battle between the armies of Ramesses II and the Hittite king Muwatallis, a turning point in the history of Western Asia, Tell Nebi Mend has attracted the attention of travellers and archaeologists since early last century. Yet despite this interest, the site is situated in a region of the Levant that is conspicuous for its scanty archaeological exploration. With a stratigraphie sequence stretching, although not continuously, from at least the Pottery Neolithic (6th millennium bc) to the early Byzantine period, Tell Nebi Mend is well equipped to contribute to our understanding of human occupation in this neglected part of the Near East. Excavations began in 1975 under the directorship of Peter Parr of the University of London's Institute of Archaeology.8 Since the 1990 season the University of Melbourne has been an equal collaborator in this project with responsibility primarily for the excavation and publication of the Iron Age material from Trench V. The broad aim is to provide for the first time a reliable archaeological sequence for the Iron Age of west-central Syria. In accordance with Syrian law, excavations may be carried out only in alternate years, with the intervening years designated as study years. Thus 1990 and 1992 were excavation seasons, and 1991 a study year. During the 1990 season the Australian team reopened Trench V which had not been worked since 1986. The first activity was to clear the trench of eroded material and plant growth, and to consolidate the baulks between the various areas that make up the trench grid. The trench site was then re-surveyed using the datum points established in the original survey of 1978 so that a new plan could be drawn up at the end of the season. 6 J.

Investigations then focused on the southern areas of the trench with a view to excavating the remaining Hellenistic deposits and preparing the trench for major exposures of the Iron Age levels. Hellenistic houses flanking opposite sides of a street oriented east/west were found directly on top of the levelled architectural remains of the Iron Age occupation. The houses were constructed of mud-brick walls set on river-stone foundations with doorways opening directly on to the street. An interesting feature was a stone-lined drain capped with flat stones that ran down the centre of the street. In one house there was clear evidence of metalworking in the form of slag, copper fragments, and charcoal. A large quantity of pottery Figure 4. Tell Nebi Mend, Syria: Iron Age Pottery.</page><page sequence="10">170 C. Ε. V. Nixon (ed.) sherds and also some whole vessels were recovered, as well as some isolated objects including terracotta figurines and several coins. Some work was also carried out in the eastern area of the trench where part of a large, well preserved mud-brick and timber-framed building with a cobbled courtyard dating to the Iron Age period had been exposed. A radiocarbon date obtained from a charcoal sample collected in destruction debris has yielded a calibrated age range, using 95% confidence intervals, between 1035 and 780 bc, with a mean date of 908 bc (the uncalibrated reading is 750±40 bc). Taking into account the practice of using old timbers for the construction of buildings, a later date around the 8th century bc is likely for the destruction of this complex, which accords well with our preliminary study of the material. The destroyed building was soon replaced by a similar one with a closely packed cobbled floor but on a different orientation. In 1992 work resumed on the second Iron Age building. The main aims of the season were to further clear the architectural remains and to determine the layout and function of this structure, and to enlarge the stratigraphie pottery sample for this period of the Iron Age. A large area was uncovered down to the cobbled surface of the previous excavation without locating the southern and western retaining walls. The full extent of the large cobbled room is still to be determined, but the area is much larger than first anticipated; clearly this room is part of a major complex. It now seems probable that a third (later) building phase is also present, since the well preserved foundations of a wall were revealed that had been built obliquely across the cobbled floor. Both this wall and the cobbled floor were disturbed in parts by two large pits of a post-Iron Age date. Probes into the earlier levels were made, though the nature of the Late Bronze-Iron Age transition at Tell Nebi Mend remains obscure, as indeed it is at other sites in western Syria. A preliminary analysis of the Iron Age pottery suggests that the repertoire consists primarily of local wheelmade orange wares (ranging between 5YR 5.5/6 and 5YR 6/7), mostly plain (fig. 4: 3, 10), belonging to the 9th—8th centuries bc. The finer vessels are generally oxidized throughout, while the thick coarse-ware sherds often display a pale beige to dark grey core. Surface treament varies from pieces that have been wet-smoothed (fig. 4: 5) to those that have received either a light horizontal burnishing on both surfaces (fig. 4: 3) or a polish on one surface only. Interesting in this regard is a goblet of pale brown fabric (5YR 6/5) tempered with medium grit (fig. 4: 7). The exterior and interior of its rim are lightly burnished and reserved slipped with reddish-brown (2.5YR 5/6) horizontal bands. Decoration is not particularly common, with relief and impressed rope designs around the shoulder being the most favoured ornaments (fig. 4: 9). Rarer are painted bichrome designs, generally haphazardly executed in fugitive red and brown (fig. 4:11,12). Cooking vessels with a coarse bricky red to dark brown fabric (2.5YR 3.5/6) comprise another ware type (fig. 4: 6, 8). Their surfaces are generally left plain and are often smoke blackened on the exterior. Some pieces, most notably the pedestalled platter illustrated in fig. 4: 4, belong to a third, semi-coarse fabric. Its core is beige in colour (7.5YR 6/4), while its surfaces are slipped in orange or buff. Finally, a rare fine ware is represented by two distinctive, red slipped (10R 4.5/8) and lightly burnished hemispherical bowls (fig. 4: 1, 2). The clay, reddish-brown in colour (2.5YR 5/8), is crisp, well levigated and well fired. The analysis of trace elements of a representative sample of pottery is also being undertaken to assist in the identification of ware types and clay sources in order to shed light on questions of origins and manufacture. Antonio Sagona and Christopher Haymes Antonio Sagona and Christopher Haymes</page><page sequence="11">Recent Australian and New Zealand Field Work 171 EXCAVATION AND SURVEY IN THE BAYBURT REGION, NORTH-EASTERN ANATOLIA: 1988-92 EXCAVATION Over the last three years the University of Melbourne has conducted excavations at BUyiiktepe Hôytik, near Bayburt in north-eastern Anatolia.9 The expedition, which followed a successful reconnaissance of the area undertaken in 1988,10 is providing fundamental data on cultural developments in a relatively unexplored region positioned within a major communication route some 1500 m above sea level. Excavations have focused on three areas: the summit of the site, located to the north, the broad western flank, and the southern end of the site. In order to determine the nature and extent of occupation, the general excavation strategy has been: (1) to investigate by means of horizontal exposures the upper levels of the site, in particular the western flank and the summit. (2) to obtain a stratigraphical section through the site by means of 10 χ 5 m trenches. (3) to recover as large a sample as possible of botanical and faunal remains with a view to determining the economic subsistence patterns. This approach has revealed deposits belonging to five periods. The following discussion covers the periods investigated beginning with the earliest levels. The Early Bronze Age Finds associated with this period include a ceramic assemblage that can be easily incorporated in the Early Trans-Caucasian tradition and that shows links with both Trans Caucasus and east-central Turkey (fig. 5:1-5). Two bone samples have provided a calibrated age range between 3303 and 2615 bc, and 2863 and 2330 bc. Our suspicion that BUyiiktepe was a transit camp during the Early Bronze Age was confirmed in 1992 with the discovery of two very significant areas intended for tents. One shelter is irregular in outline and consists of three roughly circular and joining depressions dug out of the easily workable bedrock. Two depressions appear to have been living-units, while the third is a wide platform used presumably for storage purposes. At the front of the shelter was an internal hearth associated with pottery arranged near the centre of a row of stones placed to hold down the tent covers on its margin. The second shelter is similarly built and contained a plastered hearth area on which was probably positioned an andiron with an anthropomorphic representation similar to large fragments found scattered within the area occupied by the tent. Recent studies have shown that prehistoric communities in this rugged, mountainous region may well have had a fluctuating nomadic, or at least transhumant, component in their economy. At the present stage the Buytiktepe data support this view. The 2nd millennium bc BUyiiktepe has provided the first indisputable evidence in eastern Anatolia of 2nd-millennium occupation. Until our excavations, what happened in this area between the end of the Early 9 For preliminary reports, see A. Sagona-E. Pemberton I. McPhee, AnatSt 41,1991,145-58; 42,1992, 29-46. 10 A.

The contents of illicitly dug graves in the Van area have hitherto provided our only source of information and have suggested that Van belonged to a Trans-Caucasian/Iranian cultural province. So far, the Buyiiktepe evidence comprises a temporary dwelling associated with a hearth and a range of pottery that preliminary analysis suggests is local. A bone sample contemporary with the hearth has offered a radiocarbon date range, calibrated at 95% confidence level, of 1680 to 1310 BC. This level, found towards the end of the 1992 season, is in an archaeologically sound context and is likely to extend across the site. The Iron Age Significant and extensive Iron Age occupation deposits were identified along the western flank and on the summit of the site. Most impressive is a roughly circular structure, with a maximum external diameter, east to west, of 17 m. The structure consists of a thick wall, 2.90 m at its widest point, comprising a stone-rubble fill edged on the inside and sections of the outside with roughly hewn stones. The most interesting features to be revealed in the 1992 season are two, possibly three, semicircular bastions projecting from the outer circumference. Three contiguous trenches on the western flank revealed the stone foundations of a large rectilinear building, whose full dimensions have not yet been recovered. A patch of reddish brown beaten earth indicates that it had a finely finished floor, and a row of upright stones appears to have faced a low bench against the rear wall. A preliminary analysis of the pottery indicates that there are at least three broad ware types and a number of sub-divisions (fig. 5: 6-10). Among the more distinctive types are: carinated bowls with an Outward-sloping rim and fairly thick reddish-brown burnished slip; black burnished delicate bowls with a horizontal groove under the rim on the interior; and a number of polychrome painted fragments. Similarities exist with repertoires dated to the first half of the first millennium BC, quite possibly Achaemenid, in north-western Iran. Our present understanding of eastern Anatolia in the Achaemenid period is poor. Finds of the Iron Age are generally amalgamated in the blanket term 'Urartian'. Yet we know from historical sources that north-eastern Anatolia was a frontier zone in the Persian empire, as indeed it was during the Urartian period. The importance of the Buyiiktepe Iron Age deposit is that it will enable us to distinguish between the various Iron Age material cultures. The Late Hellenistic-Early Roman Period The clearest indicator of Hellenistic building activity is the use of paving stones, evidenced best in trench R36b, which yielded a section of a road, 2.20 m at its widest point, abutting the side of a building. Some paved areas appear to form a small porch positioned in front of entrances to buildings, yet others are segments about 2.25 m in length and 1.0 m wide, seemingly unassociated with any features or structurés. When viewed in the context of the overall settlement plan, however, a patterning emerges in which these segments of pavement mark a series of steps in a network of largely earthen pathways that traverse the western flank of the hill. To date, a rectilinear building with stone foundations laid in a crude herringbone fashion provides the clearest plan of a Hellenistic structure. The Late Hellenistic/Early Roman pottery from Buyiiktepe may be divided into fine-ware and coarse-ware (fig. 5: 11-15). The principal fine-ware fabric is hard and made of a well levigated, well fired clay, usually pale brown to pale orange, often fully slipped, but some examples are also partially slipped or have a second slip, thus creating irregular patterns on the exterior wall. Favourite vessel forms include bowls with incurving lip (echinus bowl) and carinated profile. The dribble patterning achieved by a second slipping is a hallmark of this assemblage. Though the fine-ware seems largely to belong to the Hellenistic tradition in both</page><page sequence="14">174 C. Ε. V. Nixon (ed.) shape and decoration, some pieces may date to the 1st century ad. A small quantity of true Roman Sigillata has also been recovered. Coarse ware, especially the one-handled cooking pot, is common and may be local, but this will be determined by clay analysis. One large coarse pithos had an incised graffito on its shoulder, providing in Greek letters the name of the owner or maker, Vakrianus. The significance of Buyiiktepe in the Late Hellenistic-Early Roman period is that it was situated within a border area: in Late Hellenistic times, between the kingdoms of Pontus and Armenia; and in Early Roman times, between the Roman and Persian empires. The site seems to have been a small native settlement with pottery in a Hellenistic and Roman tradition, but further limited excavation is needed to clarify the architectural remains of this period. The Medieval Period Presently, the only finds datable to this period are eight burials found at the southern end of the site. All were simple pits, with a portion of the edge sometimes defined by upright stones. A standard practice was to mark with a stone the position of the head and feet of the corpse whose top is likely to have been originally left exposed. Whilst there is nothing unusual about the grave types, the mortuary rite is rather curious. With one possible exception, all the inhumations gave evidence of attempts at a secondary articulation of skeletal material clearly indicated by the absence of certain bones, most notably those of the hands and feet. The accurate dating of these tombs will depend upon C-14 analysis of preserved wood. FIELD SURVEY Some 100 sites ranging in date from the Palaeolithic to the Ottoman period have been located and recorded in the Bayburt and Giimushane provinces. Only 8 of these were previously known, discovered by K. Kokten during a cursory archaeological investigation of eastern Anatolia in the 1940s. Many of the pre-Hellenistic sites have yielded evidence of the Early Bronze Age when the region appears to have been settled by bearers of a distinctive black and red burnished pottery tradition known as Early Trans-Caucasian. Also common are finds of the Hellenistic and Roman periods. In 1988, a reconnaissance season, investigations were relatively wide ranging, but particular attention was paid to the Bespinar valley and the upper reaches of the Kelkit valley between the towns of Salyazi and Kose. Work in 1990 and 1991 was more localized. Areas surveyed included the plain of Aydintepe, the area between Bayburt and Maden, and the valley south of Demirôzii.11 The two commonest types of site found are: (a) conical mounds of fairly modest proportions with axial dimensions not exceeding 100 m and a deposit about 8 m; (b) flat sites situated on the valley floor, usually near a stream, or stretched across prominent slopes and rocky outcrops. Their size varies greatly and can only be determined by the limits of the sherd scatter which can be quite extensive (.200 χ 40 m, for instance), or rather restricted (50 χ 30 m). That these sites are typical of the highlands of north-eastern Anatolia, with its harsh climatic conditions, only reflects the relatively mobile life style of many ancient communities, which did not lend itself to the formation of deeply stratified sites. Large-sized mounds do exist, but are few in number. Other types of sites include churches, citadels, and cemeteries.

GOALS OF THE SCSP From the Bronze Age to the'Graeco-Roman era, Cyprus played a central role in the production and distribution of copper to a metals-hungry Mediterranean world. Copper and bronze served many needs, and participation in the copper trade was important in economic as well as socio-political terms. It is curious, therefore, that Cyprus's primary copper-ore production area has never been studied in its regional context. And despite the fact that archaeologists have long acknowledged the importance of this area for studying long-term change in site location and settlement hierarchy, especially in relation to mineral and agricultural resources, no systematic archaeological survey has ever been conducted there. The SCSP will remedy these omissions by undertaking an intensive, systematic archaeological survey in the north-central Troodos foothills, where many of Cyprus's copper ore deposits are located, and where the agricultural plain begins. The area of focus is a 14 χ 4 km stretch of land between the modern villages of Politiko and Mitsero. The survey is designed to examine site location and settlement hierarchy through time, in relation to metallurgical and agricultural resources. We have also developed a systematic methodology for data recording and mapping, predictive modelling (Geographic Information Systems, abbr. GIS), and geo-archaeological field research in order to examine the area's resource potential, look at site location and settlement patterns in relation to different resources, and place sites and cultures of all periods in their spatial, regional, demographic, and economic context. The project team is interdisciplinary and includes specialists in geo-archaeology, archaeo-metallurgy, social anthropology, ceramic ethno-archaeology, Cypriot archaeology and survey, and an archaeologist specializing in GIS. SCSP Field Strategy Two complementary approaches have been defined, to be used interchangeably as field conditions dictate: (1) Quadrat Recording (100 m, UTM aligned); (2) Plot Recording. Our twofold strategy results from intensive reconnaissance in a highly diverse topographical, geological, and cultural landscape. Where man-made or natural features allow ready division 12 The season was funded by grants from INSTAP (Institute for Aegean Prehistory, New York) and from Macquarie University (Sydney). The SCSP is sponsored by Macquarie University and the American Schools of Oriental Research, and was licensed to survey by the Cypriot Department of Antiquities. The team consisted of A. Bernard Knapp, Macquarie University (Director), Steve 0. Held, Nicosia (early prehistoric sites), Ian Johnson, Sydney University (Computing, Mapping, GIS), and Eberhard Zangger, Zurich (Scientific Director). The SCSP enjoys close collaboration with the Cyprus Geological Survey, particularly with its Director Dr George Constantinou, and with Senior Geologist Dr Andreas Panayiotou. Dr Stuart Swiny, Director of the Cyprus-American Archaeological Research Institute (CAARI), provided invaluable advice, support, and accommodation at CAARI during the pilot season. The support of all these individuals and institutions made it possible to fulfil the aims of the 1992 season, and to lay the groundwork for the 1993-96 survey seasons.</page><page sequence="16">176 C.

In areas lacking easily defined and identifiable features, we will use the quadrat-recording method. Quadrat Recording (100 m, UTM aligned) Each quadrat is surveyed as a unit; the archaeological material observed and the dominant environmental characteristics of the unit will be recorded in the survey database. Quadrats are defined in the field by establishing a known starting point, using a Global Positioning System (GPS), then walking on a N/S compass bearing and pacing each quadrat. Periodic checks on transect alignment and quadrat spacing will be carried out using the GPS. Transect boundaries are marked on air photos to ensure contiguous cover when adjacent transects are surveyed. Data will be entered directly into the GIS database using the quadrat UTM references. Plot Recording Using the 1963-series aerial photographs viewed in stereo, it is possible to divide the landscape into individual field plots, or into topographically and environmentally uniform plots in less developed areas. Each plot is characterized by roughly uniform land use, vegetation, slope, and aspect, and is distinguished from neighbouring plots by a change in any of those characteristics. In practice, land use and boundaries, as well as roads, trees, buildings, etc. may have changed in the thirty years since the aerial photos were taken, so that corrections to plot boundaries are required in the field. Additional divisions will be made where major internal variations in archaeological material are found within a plot. In the field, we will delineate each sampling unit on enlargements of the 1:10,000 aerial photos, and record environmental, topographic, and archaeological information for each unit. The sampling unit outline will be digitized into the project's GIS directly from the air photographs. The area of each sampling unit will be determined from the digitized outline (with corrections for scale variation due to altitude). Fieldwalking Method Our survey has two aims: (1) detection of the background artefact scatter and estimation of its density and correlation with topographic and environmental characters of the landscape; (2) the definition of 'sites' as local peaks in artefact density and their detection within the landscape. Our fieldwalking strategy is designed to address both these issues. Within each plot or quadrat, the ground will normally be covered by a team walking parallel at 5 m intervals: we feel that this is the maximum spacing for reliable coverage and recording of the off-site artefact scatter, and for reliable detection of special-purpose sites which may be spatially discrete and of small dimensions. In the second and third years we may cover some areas at wider team spacing, e.g. 10 m, depending on the results of our first year's survey and the need to increase coverage at the expense of detail. We would regard this increased spacing as a site-detection mechanism, justified by observation of characteristic site size, allowing us to obtain a more complete coverage of the survey area and to facilitate the correlation of sites with landscape reconstruction by our geo-archaeologist. We will collect only portable diagnostic material, which will be labelled first by survey unit and, where applicable, by archaeological site. All other cultural material will be counted and recorded in situ by survey unit, for entry into the project database on a daily basis. Sampling Strategy A second major constraint that has helped to determine our survey strategy is the field time available to us. In our first season (1993) we are aiming at approximately 10% coverage</page><page sequence="18">178 C. Ε. V. Nixon (ed.) through a series of regularly spaced transects at 500 m intervals (although these transects will cover 20% of the area, we expect mines, construction, restricted access, and standing crops to reduce this to approximately half). By covering the entire area on a sample basis, rather than one section of the area comprehensively, we shall obtain enough information to allow a stepwise design of the sampling procedure for the following years, whilst avoiding the dangers of failing to cover the entire study area for unpredictable reasons. In the second and third years of the survey, the study area will be stratified according to broad geological categories and the landscape classes they produce. Our database of surveyed units will serve to guide the sampling strategy, in order to ensure representative coverage of environmental and topographic variability within each strata. While our.ultimate goal is to survey all 'available' land in the study area, the adoption of a stratified systematic design allows meaningful results to be obtained at any cut-off point, in case unexpected circumstances or underestimation of survey time required cause us to fall short of our goal. DATA RECORDING AND ANALYSIS Data for survey units and sites will be recorded in databases which have been set up using the Minark Database Management System. These databases will be linked to a GIS, holding topographic and environmental data digitized from published maps, and spatial data relating to the units surveyed by the project. The main data layers in the GIS will form a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) derived from the 1:50,000 scale topographic map and bedrock geology derived from the 2" geological map. Other layers will include springs and drainage networks. The road network, churches, monasteries, and villages will also be included as spatial referents for maps generated from the GIS. We also plan to include a LANDSAT TM image geocorrected and classified for lithological discrimination, kindly provided by the Forestry Department Remote Sensing Centre, Government of Cyprus. The GIS will be used to generate maps for reporting and publication, but also to track the progress of the survey. Reports will be generated comparing the distribution of topographic and environmental characteristics (e.g. slope, aspect, basal geology, distance to water) of the survey sample with the distribution of these characteristics for the entire survey area. The GIS will also be used to analyse the locations of sites recorded during the survey, to determine whether these differ significantly from the null hypothesis that they are distributed without regard to environmental or topographic features of the landscape. If the null hypothesis is rejected, we will examine the correlation of site location with landscape characteristics, and compare the patterning with models of site location proposed for the area. SUMMARY The SCSP will fill in major gaps in the settlement record of prehistoric to modern-day Cyprus. The results of the survey will be closely co-ordinated with those from David Frankel's Australian Cyprus Expedition. Co-operative research by these two projects will facilitate a new and better understanding of Cyprus's complex, long-term history of metallurgical production and development, and its socio-economic impact on the island's inhabitants.

This was followed in 1991-2 with the first season of excavations at the prehistoric Bronze Age settlement of Marki Alonia.13 The Alykos Valley runs northward from the foothills of the Troodos Mountains, joining with the larger Yialias River north of the modern town of Dhali (ancient Idalion). Half-way along the valley, just where the igneous rocks of the Troodos meet the more recent sedimentary rocks of the central plain is the small hamlet of Marki, the focus of this long term research project (fig. 7). icosia Marki Alambra TROODOS 0 25km Figure 7. Map of Cyprus, showing the location of Marki and the partly contemporary site of Alambra Mouttes. The 1990 survey covered about 13 km2 in the vicinity of Marki. Twenty-five ancient sites, ranging in age from prehistoric to medieval were located. The most impressive are those of 13 The 1990 survey season was funded in part by La Trobe University. Primary funding for the excavations is provided by the Australian Research Council, supplemented by some small private donations from members of the Cypriot community in Melbourne, and sponsorship by Gulf Air. Infrastructure and logistical support is provided in Australia by the Department of Archaeology, La Trobe University, and in Cyprus by the Cyprus American Archaeological Research Institute. Students from La Trobe, Melbourne, The Australian National, and Sydney Universities have participated in the project. Their investment of time, energy, expertise, and funds has been, and will continue to be, essential to its success. For preliminary reports, see D. Frankel-J. M. Webb, RDAC 1992, 29-49; id. in: S.

Ε. V. Nixon (ed.) the Early and Middle Bronze Age. Near the extensive settlement site at Alonia are several contemporary but heavily plundered cemeteries. The hundreds of open tombs testify to the depredations of generations of looters. The fragments of innumerable broken pots still litter the ground, but tens of thousands of objects from these sites have found their way into private collections through the illegal antiquities market: an irreparable loss to Cyprus and to scholarship. A short distance up the valley, at the locality of Analiondas Palioklesia, is another interesting complex of sites, dating immediately after the Alonia settlement and its surrounding cemeteries. One of these sites has, almost exclusively, fragments of large pithoi, and appears to be a special-purpose processing and storage complex. This type of site signals a new dimension of social organization of the Late Bronze Age, with more formal social structures. It certainly deserves closer examination, and is an obvious target for research in the area, following completion of work at Alonia in several years' time. Over the next few years this survey may be extended to take in the entire catchment of the Alykos Valley so that we will be able to see changes in land-use and settlement pattern over the whole period of Cypriot history. The first season of excavations took place at Alonia over the abnormally cold and wet Cypriot winter from mid-November 1991 to mid-January 1992. Two separate areas were tested, one on the edge of the steep, high cliff where the Alykos River forms the northern boundary of the site and the other in the flatter, open fields 250 m to the south. In the southern area architectural features are very deeply buried, and so an area of only about 40 m2 was excavated in depth along the edge of an agricultural terrace. The destruction by terracing and the limited size of the excavation meant that no complete architectural units were exposed, but the stone footings of several walls, dividing the area into four separate rooms, were cleared. Some evidence of (slightly) earlier occupation of the area was shown by a number of post holes, pre-dating the construction of the surviving walls, and a small amount of pottery / Marki Alonia 1991 Marki A Ionia 1.991 Figure 8. Marki Alonia, Cyprus: architectural features uncovered in 1991 in the northern part of the site.</page><page sequence="21">Recent Australian and New Zealand Field Work 181 contained within pockets of fill which formed part of the process of levelling the area before the later construction phase. Walls were built on stone footings, using a variety of techniques, with different typés of mud-brick and pisé construction. The quality of wall construction, and the extensive range of pottery and other material show that this will be an important area for future excavation. The area tested in the northern end of the site is a strip about 10 m wide, between an old gravel road and the cliff edge, where deposits are being actively eroded. Here stone walls could be seen both in the eroding cliff face, and showing through the surface of the road (pi. 53:1; fig. 8). Upper deposits were excavated over about 300 m2. Immediately below the ploughsoil, stone-wall footings forming a complex of rooms were located. The constraints on the area examined (imposed by the road and the cliff) limit our current view of the architecture, but future expansion to the north-east is planned for the second season (1992-3). In some of the rooms later occupation deposits were found immediately below the ploughzone (at the level of surviving stone walls). In one small comer of a room eroding off the edge of the cliff, about one metre of fill was excavated, showing that the upper walls were built on levelling fill of some older structures. Other deposits also show evidence of clearance and dumping of older occupation material. The vast majority of pottery is of prehistoric (or Early and Middle) Cypriot Bronze Age Red Polished Ware (fig. 9: a, b, d). There are smaller quantities of other contemporary pottery, including White Painted (fig. 9: e), Black Polished, Black Slip, and Coarse Wares (fig. 9: c). These indicate that the site was occupied from the middle of the Early Cypriot well into the Middle Cypriot Period, that is from about 2200 to 1800 bc. It is too soon to provide a comprehensive account of the pottery and its relationship to that from neighbouring sites, but initial analyses are already proving of interest. For example, the information collected on pottery colours in 1991-2 has provided the basis for a systematic examination of material from several sites, showing a high degree of control of production and a remarkably uniform technology across the island.14 One more unusual item was found, although unfortunately broken and in very poor condition. This is a decorated clay object of a type otherwise unknown in Cyprus, but very similar to horseshoe-shaped hearth-surrounds or pot-stands known from Bronze Age sites in Anatolia and Syria (fig. 9: f). There are few indications of contacts between Cyprus and the Eastern Mediterranean mainland at this time, so that this item has a significance beyond demonstrating aspects of daily life. A parallel project on the ancient and modern ecology of the Alykos Valley is being developed by R. Adams and D. Simmons and Deàkin University. During the first excavation season they were able to extract and identify a range of plant remains from the settlement at Alonia, showing the presence, among other things, of olive, barley, wheat, pea, caper, almond, and pistachio. Despite several recent excavations the archaeology of this period in Cyprus is still laigely derived from cemetery evidence. The settlement at Marki Alonia has enormous potential to compensate for this bias, in several ways. The remains are spread out over accessible, although cultivated fields, and are not too deeply buried. It will be possible to excavate a large area of the site, gaining information on its architectural form and history, showing how the site developed over time, and the internal relationships between different sectors within it. There are good indications of a complex fine-scale stratigraphy. As the other more-or-less contemporary sites tend to be of very short duration, this will provide a unique sequence for the one site, covering some 500 years of the prehistoric Bronze Age.

In particular, the production, in association with the paroxysm, of destructive tsunamis is generally excluded. Previously, on the basis of extrapolation from the Krakatoa eruption of 1883, it was taken almost for granted that huge Thera-generated waves wrought extensive havoc along the coasts of Minoan Crete and elsewhere in the Aegean area and beyond. The Krakatoa and Santorini outbursts are now commonly considered to be only partly analogous. Whereas at Krakatoa, consensus has it, collapse of the centre of the volcanic island and caldera formation were rapid and violent and tsunamis of considerable magnitude were a spectacular by-product, in the case of Santorini gradual disintegration and subsidence elicited relatively minor marine disturbance.15 In the light of recent reassessment and consequent new understanding of what occurred at Krakatoa,16 entrenched opinions are no longer tenable. They are based on a misconception of the manner in which significant tsunamis are produced in the course of such episodes. In the early stage of Krakatoa's terminal convulsion a towering column of ash and gas was projected high into the stratosphere from the eruptive rent. Eventually overloaded with solids and progressively destabilized, the column collapsed with consequent production of what are termed pyroclastic flows, fluidized mixtures of particles and gases that travel at up to 150 m per second and have internal temperatures as high as 600°C. Propelled outwards with tremendous force in all directions the flows thrusted piston-like at first against the sea surrounding the island. Immediate products of the encounter were the largest of the tsunamis that devastated coastal areas of Java and Sumatra. Subsequent collapse and caldera formation were minor contributors to tidal-wave formation. In all key respects outlined, the Late Bronze Age Santorini eruption resembled its 1883 counterpart. Large tsunamis cannot but have been hurled across the Aegean, towards Crete and elsewhere, as pyroclastic flows, possibly with greater kinetic energy than those of Krakatoa, rammed into and were eventually emplaced in the sea. Given that substantial tsunamis must have been generated in the course of the Santorini outburst it is difficult to dismiss the inevitability of destructive consequence for Crete in particular. An interdisciplinary project has been established at Monash University with the aim of identifying and assessing the precise effects. The principal investigators are Joe Monaghan, director of the Centre for Computational Mathematics, Ray Cas of the Department of Earth Sciences, and myself. In 1992 the team received a seeding grant of $31,000 from the Monash Development Fund. It has applied for further funding from other sources. Basic strategy to date involves computer simulation on the basis of the disposition of pyroclasts, and of all relevant surface and submarine topographic features, of the production, propagation, magnitude and speed of the Santorini-generated tsunamis, and subsequent search in the Late Bronze Age archaeological record of Crete for confirmation and elaboration of the model's predictions. In June 1992 Joe Monaghan and I briefly visited Santorini and then went on to Crete to study the topography of coastal Minoan sites in the central north east of the island. As a result of our observations during the field trip, it was decided that special attention should be paid in 13 See, e.g., C. Doumas, Thera (1983) 144. 16 See, e.g., H. Sigurdsson et al., Eos 72,1991,378-80.</page><page sequence="24">184 C. Ε. V. Nixon (ed.) the first instance to the effects of Santorini-generated tsunamis at Gournia, Mochlos, and Pseira, all located in or on the coast of the Gulf of Mirabelo. Highly suggestive data emerge from the original excavation reports of all three sites and from the recent work of J. Soles at Mochlos. Towards the end of 1992 a further direction was added to the project on the initiative of Ray Cas. Once the Krakatoa pyroclastics flows contacted water, their less dense, more gas-permeated content did not plunge to the sea-bed but swept onward above surface at high velocity, incinerating people and structures on or near beaches as far as 45 km distant from the volcano. Cas believes that similar but more energetic and farther travelling flow components from Santorini could have reached Crete, setting fire to buildings inland beyond the range of the tsunamis that followed in their wake. The team proposes to model and then seek traces of the proposed effects. Finally, as is well known, controversy is on-going with respect to the relative timetable of the Santorini volcano's Late Bronze Age eruptive phases and absolute dates of the whole convulsion. The team anticipates making a significant contribution towards resolution. Peter Bicknell KOUKOS, SYKIA (NORTHERN GREECE)' Koukos is an Early Iron Age site on the summit of a hill of the same name, which rises immediately to the west of the village of Sykia in Sithonia, the central sub-peninsula of the Chalcidice peninsula in northern Greece (pi. 52). Excavations began in 1987.17 The site had surface indications of a cemetery and a settlement with a fortification wall, both of which have been tested, indicating a date of approximately the late 10th—7th centuries bc. The excavated area of the cemetery (pi. 52) has produced 98 tombs of three types: cist graves, pit graves, and pithoi. Cremation was the sole rite. In the cist and pit graves the cremations were usually in ash-urns, and it was not uncommon for a tomb to contain several urns. In the pithoi, which may be later than the other tombs, the ashes were sometimes placed directly within the pithos, and sometimes in a smaller vessel, usually a cut-away-necked jug. A major pyre site was found, which, when it had gone out of use, had been surmounted by an oval (commemorative?) peribolos built largely of stone slabs, probably removed from nearby cist tombs. The cemetery had been looted throughout the ages, but despite these disturbances, many finds remained. The pottery, though poorly preserved, is of particular interest, as it reflects two quite different traditions. The first consists of handmade northern types, some confined to the Chalcidice, and some with parallels from other Macedonian sites such as the Early Iron Age cemetery at Vergina. The pots of the second group, which are all wheelmade, are related to the Late Protogeometric and sub-Protogeometric styles of Euboea and the surrounding areas. Finds other than pottery include fibulae, beads, bronze bracelets, iron spearheads, knives and other blades, clay spindle whorls, and stone tools. The most notable are a matched set of six heavy, single-spiral bronze bracelets, and a very large biconical gold bead with an incised pattern; the latter was found in a looter's spoil-heap. 17 The excavation, which takes place as a collaboration between the 16th (Central Macedonia) Ephorate of the Greek Archaeological Service, represented by the Ephor, Dr J. Vokotopoulou, and the University of Tasmania, represented by Dr J. Carington Smith, has been supported by the Institute for Aegean Prehistory, New York, the Australian Research Council, and the University of Tasmania, including the John Elliott Classics Museum.

It may also have been crowded. The main area tested, which covers 274 m2, had been thickly—though haphazardly—settled. Remains of walls belonging to 10-11 different buildings, almost all on different orientations, were found. Some were vestigial, but others substantial. Most, and possibly all, belong to Early Iron Age constructions. In the 1992 season, work was confined to the settlement and concentrated on the most substantial of these buildings (pi. 52). It consisted of a porch and a single, very long chamber, the far end of which remains to be uncovered. The location of the building's other external wall proved its width to have been c.5 m, while its length, still unknown, exceeded 14 m. Part of a knob-handled bowl found on the porch floor is of a type well known from pre-Persian Olynthus. A bothros which had a rectangular stone surround and contained black earth had preceded the large building, being situated beneath its porch floor. This may have been an ash altar, and if so, the succeeding building may also have had some religious function, but finds within it do not suggest this. They consist solely of broken pottery, quite numerous spindle whorls, and very large numbers of pebble hammer-stones. The presence of the latter was explained in the 1992 season, when the scattered fragments of a soapstone mould were found just north of the large building, in what was probably a yard area. An intact Early Iron Age pithos, complete with lid, was also discovered here. The mould, for casting metal, had matrices for a dagger with an unusual tang or handle, plus another blade, on one side, and on the other, placements for billets or rods of raw metal. One of the occupations of the Koukos inhabitants was thus apparently metalworking. Two disused mines, which may have been exploited in antiquity, lie within 5 km of the site, and are the only mineral outcrops known in the Sithonia peninsula. One has deposits of galena/copper, and the other galena/iron pyrites. These mineral deposits may well explain the apparent contact between Koukos and more southerly areas of Greece. . Jill Carington Smith and Julia Vokotopoulou Jill Carington Smith and Julia Vokotopoulou THE ROMAN THEATRE AT TAORMINA, 1992 CAMPAIGN This year's team consisted of Frank Sear of the Department of Classical and Near Eastern Studies at the University of Melbourne, Barry Rowney and Zig Kapelis of the Department of Architecture at the University of Adelaide, Belinda Morgan of the Art Gallery of South Australia, and a Melbourne Honours student, Freya Lombardo. Frank Sear went ahead of the team to spend ten days studying a number of theatres in Greece which are stylistically related to that of Taormina and which he will publish in his forthcoming book on Roman theatres. The team spent the period 21 June-17 July at Taormina and in that period surveyed practically the entire theatre (109 m in diameter) and measured most of the architectural fragments on site. The plans will be drawn up and taken to the site for checking next year. Permission was sought to measure the fragments in the antiquarium and to study the archives relating to the theatre next year. The most detailed plans of the theatre hitherto were published by D. Lo Faso Pietrasanta, Duca di Serradifalco, in 1847.18 These beautiful plans are not accurate. Le belle infide was L. Bernabô Brea's term for them when discussing the theatre with the team. No new plans have been made of the theatre since then. The team's work demonstrated that even the most recent 18 Le antichità délia Sicilia, V (1847) 36-43 pis. 20-25.</page><page sequence="26">186 C. Ε. V. Nixon (ed.) study of the building19 is inaccurate in its chronology. The greatest success of the campaign was the discovery of an earlier scaenae frons underneath the present one. The scaenae frons of the theatre (fig. 10) is of the rectilinear type and is thought to be related to theatres of the eastern Mediterranean. However it was quickly discovered that the columnatio which can be seen today belongs to a later period when the orchestra was transformed into an arena. Underneath the columnatio are the partly demolished remains of earlier podia. The team measured them and found that the podia framing the hospitalia curve inwards to form semicircular niches like those in the theatre at Benevento. In the case of Taormina, because the scaenae frons is rectilinear, the niches are formed by the podia and columns alone. In addition to the columns along the edge of the podia there must have been a column immediately adjacent to each of the lateral doorways. These columns must have fitted into the V-shaped slots in the scaenae frons wall, which are otherwise inexplicable (pi. 53: 2). It will be observed that the slots correspond exactly to the ends of the curved podia and the reconstructed drawing of the scaenae frons shows how the columns were arranged. It is evident that the architect of the Taormina theatre was attempting to create a similar effect to that at Benevento. Figure 10. Taormina, Sicily: scaenae frons of Roman theatre (1:500). The similarity between the scaenae frons of the theatre at Taormina and that of Benevento is very striking, and both have a triple doorway in the centre of the scaenae frons. However because the scaenae frons at Taormina is rectilinear the effect of columnar recession is achieved illusionistically. Illusionistic columns partially slotted into the wall surface of a rectilinear scaenae frons are not unique to Taormina. A very similar device is used in the scaenae frons of the south theatre at Gerasa, although with a semicircular slot. The Gerasa scaenae frons is also rectilinear and the niches are formed by the podia and columnatio alone. How the two theatres are related and how such a stylistic device may have been transmitted is as yet unclear. However, the two theatres are of very similar date. The Taormina theatre is probably Trajanic and an inscription on the seats of the Gerasa theatre dates one of the cunei p fir! 3 \ a a ■noJ n "7 Ml Figure 10.

It might be noted that the Benevento theatre, probably started at the time of Trajan, was dedicated by Hadrian, as an inscription dated to ad 128 attests. The importance of the discovery of the earlier podia at Taormina must be stressed because this type of scaenae frons, with the hospitalia enclosed in curved niches and the regia with a triple doorway, is of a highly unusual type which occurs only in three theatres: Taormina, Benevento and the Theatre of Pompey at Rome, as shown on the Severan marble plan. The date of the scaenae frons of the Theatre of Pompey has been the subject of some controversy. However it is clear that the Roman theatre at Benevento, which belongs to the early 2nd century ad, is based upon that of the Theatre of Pompey in Rome. Now the discovery of an earlier scaenae frons at Taormina, which can date to no later than the early 2nd century ad and which is also related to the Theatre of Pompey in Rome, seems to confirm that the scaenae frons of the Theatre of Pompey at Rome, as shown in the Severan marble plan, does not represent an undocumented Severan rebuilding, but is the rebuilding which occurred as a result of a well documented fire at the time of Domitian. The stylistic connections with Gerasa are also worth exploring and we are considering a visit to Jordan as part of next year's campaign. We propose to evaluate the usefulness of turning our attention to the province of Arabia for future campaigns.
