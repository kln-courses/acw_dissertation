<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOT RIGHTLY HUMAN: Beckett and Animality Shane Weller This essay examines Beckett's treatment of the distinction between human and animal, a distinction that is certainly not one among others, since it arguably founds an entire philosophico-religious tradition running from Aristotle to Levinas, and including Descartes, Malebranche, Kant, Hegel, and Heidegger. I focus in particular on the impact on Beckett of his reading about Wolfgang Kohler's experiments on chimpanzees during the First World War and aim to show that Beckett submits the human/animal distinction to a double pressure, thereby producing a new conception of the so-called 'political animal.' 1. Encountering the Animal Although there is no entry under either "animals" or "animality" in the Grove Companion to Beckett, the number of entries for specific kinds of animal is very large and includes ant, beaver, bees, Buridan's ass, cats, corncrake, Darwin's caterpillar, dogs, donkey, eels of Como, flies, goat, hens, hinny, horse, monkeys, morpion, parrots, rats, serotine, and sheep. Given such a range of animal life in an oeuvre so often charac terized as minimalizing, it is remarkable that commentators have tended to neglect Beckett's treatment of animality - beyond, that is, the identi fication in his works of the Cartesian conception of the animal as ma chine or pure body (corps, corpus) lacking mind (esprit, mens) or soul (dme, anima). The reasons for this neglect certainly warrant analysis, not least because in Beckett the question of animality is as much a po litical one as it is philosophical or zoological, bearing directly upon Aristotle's epochal determination of the human as both the ra tional/speaking animal (zoon logon ekhori) and the political animal (zoon politikon). Among those commentators who have addressed the treatment of animality in Beckett, there has been little agreement. In his 1967 article on Molloy, Philip H. Solomon argues that Beckett makes use of animals to communicate his contempt for the human. The Grove Companion, on the other hand, presents the many animals in Beckett's texts as serv</page><page sequence="2">212 Shane Weller ing for the most part an emblematic function: hens are described as "recurrent emblems" of "the futility of existence, culminating in foolish death" (251); horses are "emblems of man's brutality to beasts" (86); and parrots are "emblems of thought and speech" (428). In striking contrast, Steven Connor has argued that the singularity of Beckett's animals lies precisely in their resistance to both emblematization and anthropomorphism, and in their being presented for the most part in their radical alterity to the human. In Molloy, for instance, "the pres ence of animals arouses a powerful sense of otherness, of a world lying beyond the reach of human language and intention" (30; emphasis in the original). Thus, Beckett's rejection of "anthropomorphic insolence" (Beckett 1976, 202) would be nowhere more apparent than in his treat ment of animal life. At first glance, it might seem that Connor's Beckett is simply repeating Hegel's claim that an "infinite difference" separates human and animal, and that, paradoxically, this difference lies precisely in the human being's knowing that it is an animal: Man is an animal, but even in his animal functions, he is not con fined to the implicit, as the animal is; he becomes conscious of them, recognizes them, and lifts them, as, for instance, the process of digestion, into self-conscious science. In this way man breaks the barrier of his implicit and immediate character, so that pre cisely because he knows that he is an animal, he ceases to be an animal and attains knowledge of himself as spirit. (Hegel, 80; emphasis in the original) The alterity of the Beckettian animal would lie, however, precisely in its resistance to sublation (Aufhebung), and would thus be akin to Der rick's conception of the animal as the absolutely other (le tout autre), its gaze "uninterpretable, unreadable, undecidable, abyssal and secret" (Derrida, 29; my translation). If one accepts Connor's claim regarding the alterity of the animal in Beckett, then the question becomes: What kinds of human response to this alterity does Beckett offer us, and which of these responses, if any, does he underwrite? On the one hand, there are certainly occasions in Beckett when the alterity of the animal is not only recognized but also respected. One example would be the narrator's response to the "completely white horse" in From an Abandoned Work, which Connor describes as an almost "religious awe" (Connor, 30). On the other hand, however, Beckett repeatedly presents human beings attempting to mas</page><page sequence="3">Beckett and Animality 213 ter or appropriate animals through their emblematization, their anthro pomorphization, their being raised for slaughter, and, more generally, their being made to serve a human end. Furthermore, with very few exceptions (the stoats in From an Abandoned Work being one), Beckett does not present animals as violent; rather, violence tends to originate in the human and be directed either against other human beings or against animals. This comportment towards animal life is in accordance with a philosophico-religious tradition that passes by way of both Kant and Descartes and stretches all the way back to Genesis: "And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth" (1:26-27). All of the above would appear to support the argument that Beckett underwrites an ethical ecological attitude to animal life. Through an acknowledgement of animal life in its radical (non Hegelian) alterity to the human, through a respectful awe in the face of that alterity, and a critique of the impulse to master it and to make it serve a human end, Beckett would offer us the model of an ethical hos pitality to animal life that would break with an anthropocentric and anthropomorphic tradition that Derrida sees as running from Aristotle to Levinas, and that would include Descartes, Kant, Heidegger, and Lacan, among so many others. This tradition would constitute the phi losophical substrate of what Derrida terms an unrelenting "war against the animal" (140; my translation), in which the animal is repeatedly thought in terms of lack (manque) - as "poor in world" (weltarm), ac cording to Heidegger - and is determined above all by its inability to respond (repondre). For Derrida, those writers who escape this tradition include Montaigne, Nietzsche, Adorno and Kafka. On the basis of Con nor's reading, and the other textual evidence referred to above, it would appear that Beckett may be added to the list of those who challenge the tradition that makes of the animal the animal-machine. In Beckett, however, things are rather more complicated than this. 2. The Suffering Animal In L Animal done que je suis, Derrida refers us to Jeremy Bentham for the question that should be asked of the animal. This question is not "Can animals think?" or "Do animals possess a mind or a soul" or "Can animals respond?" but rather "Can animals suffer?" (Derrida, 48). And to that question, Derrida observes, the answer is undoubtedly "Yes." As</page><page sequence="4">214 Shane Weller observed above, in Beckett violence very rarely comes from animals, and animals are frequently presented as suffering beings, as victims, or as "Poor dear dumb beasts" (Beckett 1995, 67). In this, Beckett count ers the Christian view (expressed by Malebranche, among others) that suffering results from sin and thus always has a meaning, and that therefore animals do not (indeed cannot) suffer, since, lacking both a soul and free will, they cannot sin. That Beckett was fascinated from an early point by the treatment of animals as in some sense human, and thus in the instability of any clear distinction between human and ani mal, is evident from his having read E. P. Evans's The Criminal Prose cution and Capital Punishment of Animals (1906). Not only do Beckett's animals appear, contra Malebranche, to suffer, but his works contain numerous instances of human beings expressing sympathy for that suffering. In All That Fall, for instance, Maddy Rooney's sympathy for suffering animals anticipates Elizabeth Costello's response to ani mal suffering in J. M. Coetzee's The Lives of Animals (1999). Such sympathy is, however, at odds with that sense of radical - even infinite - difference which also characterizes the human being's relation to the animal in Beckett. In fact, Beckett tends to gender this sympathy for the suffering animal, making it (as does Coetzee after him) predominantly maternal in nature. It is significant that in the fol lowing story, recounted by Beckett to James Knowlson, it is the mother who both feels for, and acts to release, the trapped dog while the father sleeps on, oblivious to the sounds of the suffering animal: I'll tell you an anecdote about my mother and dogs. My father was alive at that time. He was sleeping. She was awake. And there was the sound of a dog barking in the distance, barking, barking, bark ing. She got up in the middle of the night and went out and tracked down where the dog was by the bark; she followed the bark. It was in the garden of a family called Goode about five hundred yards from the house. She got into the garden somehow and found this unfortunate dog in a trap, trapped. And she released the dog. (qtd. in Knowlson and Knowlson, 7) The fact that the trap-setter's name here is Goode is an irony that Beckett would not have missed. However, whether or not the attempt to alleviate the suffering of an animal is in fact an unambiguously ethical action becomes rather less easy to determine once one enters Beckett's works, where the alterity of the animal means that any human interven</page><page sequence="5">Beckett and Animality 215 tion is liable to be catastrophic. When, in Company, the child attempts to improve the condition of a hedgehog, the 'release' granted the ani mal is of a very different kind, namely death. Furthermore, in Beckett the desire to destroy all animal life is not simply unethical, if only be cause it is orientated towards a reduction to zero of suffering. The kill ing of the flea - if it is a flea - in Endgame, for instance, is arguably carried out in order to put an end not just to a life of suffering but to life 'as' suffering. In Beckett, then, this kind of killing would have to be distinguished from the slaughtering of animals to provide food and other materials for human use, and it cannot be neatly categorized as either unethical or psychotic. 3. Becoming Animal Thus far, it would appear that, with a few complicating turns, Beckett insists upon the radical alterity of the animal to the human, that he ad umbrates both an ethical and an unethical comportment towards animal life, and that he underwrites the former, principally by critiquing the anthropomorphization of the animal. However, we also have to con sider the fact that, while animal life is indeed repeatedly presented in its radical difference from the human, Beckett disintegrates the Cartesian human/animal distinction, producing neither a rational animal nor Aris totle's political animal, but rather a human-becoming-animal that coun terpoints Kafka's animal-becoming-human in his "A Report to an Academy" (1917), in which an ape called Red Peter reports on his be ing subjected to a process of humanization. In Beckett, it is often pre cisely the reverse of such humanization that takes place: both Molloy and Macmann, for instance, come to bear an ever closer resemblance to the "creeping thing" of Genesis. This dehumanization carries the ra tional animal back in the direction of the Cartesian animal-machine, but it does so in a manner that wrecks the very distinction between rational and mechanical animal. Descartes's conception of the animal is neatly summarized in Wilhelm Windelband's History of Philosophy, which Beckett first read in the spring of 1933 and from which he transcribed the following pas sage: Animals remain, for Descartes, bodies; their "sensations" are only nervous movements, out of which stimulations of the motor sys tem arise in accordance with reflex mechanism. In the human body, however, the mental substance is present at the same time,</page><page sequence="6">216 Shane Weller and in consequence of this co-existence the storm of the animal spirits in the pineal gland excites a disturbance in the mental sub stance also, which manifests itself in the latter as an unclear and indistinct idea, i.e. as sense-perception, as emotion, or as passion. (Windelband, 414; cf. TCD MS 10967) Less than two years later, Beckett encountered an anti-Cartesian con ception of animality in Robert S. Woodworth's Contemporary Schools of Psychology (1931), from which he took notes on the researches of the German psychologist Wolfgang Kohler, whose experiments at the Anthropoid Station on Tenerife between 1913 and 1917 led him to challenge E. L. Thorndike's argument that, unlike human beings, "Animals learn, neither by reasoning nor by imitation, but by trial and error." In his The Mentality of Apes (1917; English translation, 1925), Kohler addresses the question of "whether the chimpanzee, represent ing probably the most intelligent group of subhuman animals, showed any genuine intelligence" (Woodworth 142). His conclusion is that in fact apes learn not simply through "trial and error" (transcribed by Beckett as "trial and terror") but also through "insight." In other words, for Kohler, the strict Cartesian distinction between human and animal is simply untenable. Beckett draws on the description of Kohler's animal experiments in the mime Act without Words I, where, significantly, Kohler himself becomes the victimizer: the very attempt to determine whether the ape possesses "genuine intelligence" becomes a mode of torture. It is, how ever, with a rather different Kohler in mind that one has to approach Beckett's (ultimately unrealized) choice of a photograph of two chim panzees playing chess for the cover of Murphy (1938). Seeing Murphy and Mr Endon as chimpanzees is not necessarily to see them simply through Cartesian glasses as pure unthinking automata. Rather, the animal is presented as no longer simply other to the human, and the presenting of that which is not "rightly human" - as Murphy is de scribed by the chandler's "eldest waste product" (77) - as a chimpanzee is not necessarily an insult, as it is when, in Proust, Beckett observes that friendship, as "the attempt to communicate where no communica tion is possible," is "merely a simian vulgarity" (63), or when, in End game, Hamm calls Clov an "ape" (1990, 130) because he cannot tell the difference between dialogue and an aside. There can be little doubt that the Cartesian conception of the hu man/animal distinction casts a long shadow over Beckett's own concep</page><page sequence="7">Beckett and Animality 217 tion of the animal, and there are certainly Cartesian-Christian voices in Beckett that insist upon the radicality of that distinction. In How It Is, for instance, the speaker tells the following story about a llama, to whom he turns in search of comfort: "she would not come to me I would go to her huddle in her fleece"; this story is immediately ne gated, however, by other (Cartesian-Christian) voices: "but they add no a beast here no the soul is de rigueur the mind too a minimum of each" (15). In Beckett, then, there is a war between the voice that would insist upon the distinction between human and animal and the voice that would negate or at least complicate it. In other words, the human ani mal is one more of Beckett's pseudocouples, governed by the principle nec tecum nec sine te (neither with you nor without you), as Beckett expresses it in a letter of 29 December 1957 to Alan Schneider (Harmon, 24). Adorno's observations in Aesthetic Theory that "In the similarity of clowns to animals the likeness of humans to apes flashes up" and that "the constellation animal/fool/clown is a fundamental layer of art" (119) certainly appear to owe a great deal to his appreciation of Beckett. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Beckett's problematization of the hu man/animal distinction is certainly at its most forceful when it comes to the chimpanzee, from which he draws what is arguably one of the most significant modes of expression in his oeuvre, namely body language. In early 1935, Beckett read and took a few notes on Otto Rank's The Trauma of Birth (1924; English translationl929). In a footnote, Rank mentions Kohler's The Mentality of Apes, and, on this occasion, Beckett writes a memo to himself to read Kohler's book. The footnote that attracted Beckett's eye reads as follows: To a quite primitive stage of development belongs the mode of representation on one's own body and from one's own material, as it is re-established, for example, in hysterical attacks (Ferenczi, Gebdrdensprache); Freud first called attention thereto, by showing how the hysteric represents on himself also the action, for instance the embrace, desired from the love partner [...]. One must add to this the interesting observations of Kohler in his Mentality of Apes, where he shows that apes express what they want by indicat ing it on their own bodies. Thus a chimpanzee expressed the em brace which her master should give her by putting her arms round her own body. (Rank, 80; cf. TCD MS 10971/8)</page><page sequence="8">218 Shane Weller According to Kohler, then, the female chimpanzee uses her own body as the stage for an enactment of that which she desires from the other. Her gesture of self-embracement both substitutes and calls for the other's embrace. That the possibility of such a substitutive-expressive language of the body would stay with Beckett is clear not least from his decision, forty years later, to have May in Footfalls (1976) embrace herself in a manner that recalls the female chimpanzee observed by Kohler. Indeed, the movement in his later dramatic works towards a purely bodily language is arguably a movement towards the language of an animal, not as what the Oxford English Dictionary terms a being "endowed with life, sensation, and voluntary motion," but as a suffering being, defined by lack not in Descartes's, Kant's, or Heidegger's sense, but because this being 'experiences' lack and 'expresses' that lack by making of her own body both a stage and a substitute. And, as I have sought to demonstrate elsewhere, the act of self-embracement in Beckett has to be thought in relation to another absent 'master,' namely the father, and this in turn lies at the heart of the only bearable version of the political in Beckett, namely the embrace of a highly paradoxical relation without relation (see Weller 2007, 141-59). While countering an entire philosophico-religious tradition charac terized by its emphatic anthropocentrism and anthropomorphism, Beckett's disintegration of the human/animal distinction is not the de nial, negation, annihilation, or sublation of that distinction. Rather, in Beckett, animals - or at least some animals - become, on occasion, those pseudocoupled beings in which the cognitive and the inorganic, mind and stone, or what Heidegger terms the "world-forming" (weltbil dend) and the "worldless" (weltlos), are brought into a highly paradoxi cal relation without relation. Nowhere is this more evident than in the following passage from How It Is: "some animals still the sheep like granite outcrops a horse I hadn't seen standing motionless back bent head sunk animals know" (34). What it is that "animals know" remains, for the no longer strictly Cartesian (or indeed Kantian, Hegelian, or Heideggerian) human, a great unknown, and it is, of course, just such "ignorance" that Beckett identifies as the terrain of his own art (qtd. in Shenker, 148). As a remark made by Beckett to Patrick Bowles reveals, this unknown knowing of the 'animals' is not located simply in an ani mal being that would lie outside human being; rather, for Beckett, that animal which knows lies within the human, and indeed within that which, according to Descartes and the tradition to which he belongs,</page><page sequence="9">Beckett and Animality 219 humanizes the human, namely the mind: "It is as if there were a little animal inside one's head, for which one tried to find a voice; to which one tries to give a voice. That is the real thing. The rest is a game" (Beckett qtd. in Knowlson and Knowlson, 111; emphasis in the origi nal). In place of the Cartesian res cogitans, then, Beckett offers us a little voiceless animal for which - or for whom - he tries to find a voice. No doubt, this makes of Beckett's human the not "rightly hu man," but it also makes of his animal something other than the non human. This is because the human/animal distinction - which, as both Derrida and Agamben argue, lies at the very foundation not only of Western metaphysics but also of Western politics and ethics - is sub jected to a double pressure in Beckett's works. On the one hand, this distinction is radically expanded, to the point at which it becomes abso lute: the animal becomes the absolutely other (Derrida's tout autre), an unreadable eye. On the other hand, however, this distinction is col lapsed, such that the very essence of the human is resituated in the ani mal. Value, here, is located neither in identity nor in alterity, and it is for this reason that Beckett's response to the very concept of animality, and, in particular, to what Derrida terms the "war against the animal" on which an entire anthropocentric philosophico-religious tradition depends, may be described as what I have elsewhere termed an "anethi cal" response; that is, a double movement, both towards and away from any ethical position, including Derrida's "ethic of hospitality" (see Weller 2006). In any attempt to think the politics of Beckett's oeuvre, and to determine what becomes of Aristotle's zoon politikon, one has to return to the question of animality in its anethicality, and in particular to Kohler's female chimpanzee, a suffering being who makes of her body a language. For all Adorno's sense of affinity with Beckett, the expres siveness of this chimpanzee in Beckett's works is not that of Adorno's animals, of whom the latter writes in Aesthetic Theory: "there is noth ing so expressive as the eyes of animals - especially apes - which seem objectively to mourn that they are not human" (113). If, in Beckett, mourning is always that of the not "rightly human," it is not on account of a failure to be human. Rather, this mourning is that of a being whose suffering derives from a sense of its "irremediable solitude" (Beckett 1970, 63), but a solitude that certainly does not exclude the torments of what in How It Is Beckett describes as the "orgy of false being life in common" (76).</page><page sequence="10">220 Shane Weller Works Cited Ackerley, C.
