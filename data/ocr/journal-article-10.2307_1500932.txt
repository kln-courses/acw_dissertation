PREECE, School of Education, University of Exeter ABSTRACT The physical science paradigm, particularly the use of mathematical models and the formulation of general principles, is defended as a method of enquiry in education. Examples of algebraic and topological models are described, and a particular model relating learning to the pace of instruction is discussed in some detail. Two broad generalisations-the Quantitative and Qualitative Principles of Teaching ('more teaching leads to more learning' and 'learning is largely unaffected by differences in teaching style')-are also discussed. Let a hundred flowers blossom and let a hundred schools of thought contend. (Mao, 1962) In her 1987 Presidential Address, Broadfoot (1988) noted that since the early days of the British Educational Research Association (BERA) "we have in fact seen a steady shift away from the more positivist scientific paradigm towards more interpretive models and methodologies", but she went on to suggest the need to "suit the method to the issue" and to "work within both paradigms". This 'hundred flowers' position has been strongly criticised in other Presidential Addresses. Thus, Whitehead (1989), in stressing "the epistemological integrity of our discipline, education", has echoed Simon's (1978) condemnation of "liberal eclecticism in relation to selecting norms and procedures for educational research". Simon advo- cated a distancing of educational research from the methods adopted in psychology and sociology, and he accused researchers aspiring to objectivity of dissecting educational problems into "parts which do not add up to the whole". Similarly, another BERA President used his Address to refer unflatteringly to a Newtonian research paradigm (Hamilton, 1985), and Whitehead has explicitly described objec- tivist, positivist, methodology as totally inappropriate (Whitehead &amp; Lomax, 1987). It is, perhaps, worth noting at this point that the common identification of the philosophy of the physical sciences with positivism is mistaken. Although at the turn of the century some eminent scientists espoused positivist philosophy (most notably Mach), these views were decisively combated, for example by Lenin (1952), and the triumph of atomism reinforced the realist views of most scientists. 297</page><page sequence="2">298 P. F. W. Preece Elliot (1988) has adopted an even more extreme position in rejecting both the scientific, so-called positivist, and interpretative modes of enquiry in education, claiming that these are essentially contemplative and advocating research via policy-making action. But it is surely mistaken to characterise the work of physical scientists as contemplative, and the apparent elevation of action over theory carries with it an unwelcome flavour of anti-intellectualism. Other contributors to BERA journals, however, have shared Broadfoot's more liberal views on research methodology. Thus in a discussion of research in the sociology of education in the first issue of Research Intelligence, Eggleston (1975) argued that "for an area of human interaction so complex as education, the use of the fullest range of techniques available is not only appropriate but also necessary". Similarly, claiming that the division between quantitative psychometric and quali- tative phenomenological and anthropological approaches is unnecessary, Zubir &amp; Pope (1984) have advocated methodological triangulation in which both ap- proaches are used to provide corroboration and deeper insights. Elton (1977) has gone further and, drawing on Bohr's work on quantum physics, has argued that reductionist-mechanistic and holistic-anthropomorphic research methodologies are deeply complementary, each exploring different aspects of a reality too complex to be grasped from one vantage point. Elton suggested that we may have something to learn from physics, and, in the 'hundred flowers' spirit, my intention here is to describe and defend an approach to educational research, imitatio physicce, which is at the opposite end of the spectrum from the subjective, interpretative methodologies currently so fashionable in BERA. There are two features of research in the physical sciences that I believe can be fruitfully incorporated into research on teaching and learning. These are the use of mathematical models and the formulation of broad principles. Thus, for example, Boyle's Law relates gaseous pressure and volume at constant temperature by means of a simple algebraic function (inverse proportionality), which applies irrespective of the identity of the gas. This is a potentially useful rule in practice, although it holds only approximately, and its formulation provided a framework for fruitful investiga- tions of its accuracy and limitations. But, perhaps most importantly, it issued a challenge to theoreticians to account for the rule, and for exceptions to it, and so led to a deepening understanding of the particulate structure of matter. In using certain statistical techniques in data analysis, educational researchers have, of course, implicitly been employing mathematical models. For example, the model which often underlies the use of regression analysis is a bivariate (or multivariate) distribution, so that the relationship between the variables (x and y, say) is statistical and regression lines exhibit aspects of this distribution (Kendall, 1951). Formally, the model states that x and y are random variables such that the expected value of x, given y, is linearly related to y and that the expected value of y, given x, is linearly related to x, the regression lines being given by these two linear equations. In fact, if the conditional distribution of y about its mean value is the same for any x (i.e. only the mean of y changes with x), and similarly only the mean of x changes with y, then the existence of the two linear regressions implies that the distribution of x and y is bivariate normal (Kendall &amp; Stuart, 1973). However, in this paper, as in the physical sciences, the concern is with functional, rather than statistical, relationships among variables, and I have argued elsewhere that it is, in fact, possible to interpret the two conventional regression lines as describing functional, rather than merely statistical, relationships (Preece, 1978).</page><page sequence="3">Imitatio Physicce 299 If two variables, x and y, are both subject to error, then it is not possible, without assumptions about the magnitudes of the errors, to recover a linear functional relationship between the error-free variables by means of linear regression (Lindley, 1947). If x is free from error, however, the linear regression of y on x does indeed estimate a linear functional relationship between the error-free variables (Guest, 1961). Thus, for example, using data from Anderson (1983) on the information gain (N) by 12 and 13 year-old students learning about human health at various times (t) after the beginning of the lesson, linear regression of N on t yields: N= 3.73 + 1.22t. The errors in the measurement of t are presumably negligible, so this may be considered a functional relationship between the variables and, as the correlation between N and t is 0.99, the linear fit is very good. However, Anderson implied that N = 0 at t = 0, and forcing the linear regression through the origin gives a less good fit, and this suggests the possibility of a curvilinear relationship. But, whereas there is only one kind of straight line, there are an infinite number of different kinds of curve, and a merit of mathematical modelling is that it requires the researcher to delve more deeply into underlying processes in order to identify a plausible function relating the variables. In the present case, viewing learning as resulting from a dynamic equilibrium between information acquisition and loss (Hicklin, 1976) is a possible approach, and this yields a negative exponential growth curve: N = 18.7[l -exp(-0.18t)], which fits the data well (Preece, 1984). This model is based on interesting premises concerning learning and forgetting-the existence of individual differences in the aptitude to acquire information but no differences in the propensity to forget-and formulating and testing the model may help to deepen our understanding of the learning process. The dependence of learning on academic engaged time is, of course, well established (Rosenshine &amp; Berliner, 1978), but the property of diminishing returns and the asymptotic ceiling of negative exponential growth curves would have important implications for mastery learning, if confirmed. The dependence of learning on time devoted to teaching is the kind of general principle that I believe it is valuable to formulate explicitly. It may be called the Quantitative Principle of Teaching-in short, more teaching leads to more learning. As in the physical sciences, formulating such general principles can be an important stimulus to research. Thus the Beginning Teacher Evaluation Study (Denham &amp; Lieberman, 1980) employed a model of learning based on the centrality of academic learning time. The importance of time devoted to learning and teaching raises the question of the significance of the pace of instruction (i.e. the amount taught per unit time). I have developed a simple algebraic model relating the rate of learning z (e.g. number of foreign language vocabulary items learnt per lesson) to the pace of instruction p (e.g. the amount of vocabulary introduced per lesson): z = p-p2/4a, where a is a constant (Preece, 1990). This quadratic relationship has proved to be consistent with data obtained by Ebbinghaus (1902), a pioneer of such mathemati- cal modelling, on the rate of learning stanzas from Virgil's iEneid at different</page><page sequence="4">300 P. F. W. Preece speeds. It is a feature of this equation that with increasing pace the amount learnt per lesson rises to a maximum and subsequently falls. This is plausible as a high pace of instruction is likely to reduce the opportunity for rehearsal and the elaboration necessary for retention. The maximum rate of learning is equal to a, which is therefore a natural measure of the pupil's ability. Also plausibly, the optimum pace, which maximises the rate of learning, increases with increasing pupil ability. Thus in a heterogeneous class, the pace of instruction in whole-class teaching cannot be at the optimum level for all pupils, and the above equation has been found to predict correctly the deficit in learning found in an empirical study of high-ability students taught in heterogeneous compared with homogeneous classes (Preece, 1990). The impossibility of adjusting the pace of lessons in whole-class teaching to be at the optimum level for all pupils also has implications for the relationship between learning and class size. This hinges on the fact that, even with random assignment of pupils to groups, the expected value of the range of ability in a group is related to the size of the group, although the expected value of the mean ability is unrelated to group size. On the assumption that the teacher adjusts the style and pace of a lesson to the least-able student in the class, I have accounted for various features of the data collected in the Glass et al. (1982) meta-analysis of research on the relation- ship between class size and achievement (Preece, 1987). However, I assumed that the average learning in a class decreased linearly with the range of ability of pupils, which is not consistent with the above equation relating learning to the pace of instruction. If the teacher adopts the optimum pace for the least-able student in the class and assuming a rectangular distribution of ability, then it follows from the above equation relating z and p that the average amount learned per lesson (z) in the class is given approximately by z = a(l -kw2/a2) where k is a constant, a is the average ability of pupils in the class, and w is the range of ability, provided that w is sufficiently small that further terms in the expression may be neglected. Furthermore, the theoretical prediction from the above model is that k = 0.33. Assuming this quadratic relationship between mean learning and the range of ability in a class, I have obtained a correlation of 0.64 between predicted and empirical effect sizes, using data from the Glass et al. meta-analysis. (With the original linear negative relationship between z and w, the correlation was 0.62.) Assuming a coefficient of variation for ability of 15/100, the best fit with the class- size data requires that k = 0.35, in good agreement with the above theoretical value. This kind of quantitative agreement between a theoretical mathematical model and empirical data is a key feature of much work in the physical sciences. Models are of particular interest and value, however, if they make unexpected predictions. This seems to be the case with this model if it is used to predict changes in pace and learning from lesson to lesson (Preece, 1990), for the logistic difference equation arises naturally, with its surprisingly rich properties which have only been discovered relatively recently (May, 1976). Depending on how demand- ing the teacher is in the light of the learning in the previous lesson, qualitatively different patterns emerge for the sequences of pace and learning from lesson to lesson. For undemanding teachers a decline in learning from lesson to lesson takes place, and for more demanding teachers stability of pace and learning emerges,</page><page sequence="5">Imitatio Physice 301 although the pace may be too slow or too fast for optimum student achievement. For very demanding teachers lesson sequences involving either cyclic or chaotic patterns are found, and this illustrates that unpredictability of behaviour is not necessarily inconsistent with deterministic mathematical models. One problem with algebraic models of the kind discussed above is the need to develop equal-interval, and in some cases ratio, scales if the models are to be operationalised. For example, Walberg's (1981) model of educational productivity, based on the Cobb-Douglas production function, requires the productivity factors to be measured on ratio scales, and difficulties associated with this requirement could lead to a spurious fit between the model and empirical data (Preece, 1985). Item response theory may, however, be a useful means of developing instruments with the required scale properties. An example of the use of item response theory for this purpose is Bryk &amp; Raudenbush's (1987) modelling of growth curves using Head Start data. It may be the case, however, that linear scales cannot in principle be constructed for many of the variables encountered in educational theory. If the relationship between two equally valid scales measuring the same variable is not linear but is smooth and order-preserving, the scales are said to be qualitatively related (Isnard &amp; Zeeman, 1975). In which case, algebraic models are no longer appropriate, but mathematical modelling is still possible with topological models. The algebraic model discussed above relating the rate of learning to the pace of instruction and pupil ability is a particular case of a more general topological model relating achievement to teaching and learner variables (Preece, 1976). In the general model, there is an inverted U shaped relationship between achievement and the teaching process variable, with extreme values of the process variable giving rise to lower achievement. The lesson sequence patterns noted above (stable, cyclic, chaotic) for pace and learning do not occur only with a quadratic function relating learning and pace but arise with most inverted U-type functions. Thus, the general topological model can account for different patterns over a series of lessons, from the stable to the chaotic, of various process and product measures, on the assumption that teachers adjust the lesson process in the light of the product of the previous lesson. The general topological model incorporates an aptitude-treatment interaction, as the value of the teaching variable to maximise achievement depends on the ability of the pupil. It follows that the model predicts a reversal in sign of process-product correlations between high and low ability groups over a certain range of the process variable, illustrating that explicit predictions can be made from topological models. Now in a re-analysis of some data on O-level achievement, Chapman (1979) found clear evidence of just such sign reversals. For example, the correlation between mean O-level physics achievement and a "teacher uses dictated lesson notes often" scale was 0.33 for low achievers and -0.44 for high achievers, with the school as the unit of analysis. Inverted U shaped process-product relationships provide an explanation of the weakness of teacher effects. Thus in a review of a number of meta-analyses of research on various science teaching strategies, Welch (1985) reported an average effect size of only 0.22, and he concluded that " the influence of what the teacher does in the classroom appears minimal". If teachers generally adjust their behav- iour to be near to the maxima of process-product curves, then this weakness of teacher effects is to be expected as even quite large differences in teacher behaviour will only have small effects on pupil learning. This is simply a property of turning</page><page sequence="6">302 P. F. W. Preece points of curves. Just as the dependence of learning on academic engaged time can be usefully expressed as a general principle, I believe that it is also useful to express as a general principle the lack of effect on learning of differences in teaching. I have called this the Qualitative Principle of Teaching-i.e. learning is largely unaffected by differences in teaching style and approach (Preece, 1983). As in the physical sciences, such principles provide a challenge to theoreticians to account for them and to experimentalists to explore their accuracy and limitations. The geometry of warped surfaces (catastrophe theory) provides researchers, from the physical sciences to education, with potentially fruitful tools for topological modelling. For example, I proposed a model of the relationship between classroom disorder and teacher anxiety based on the cusp catastrophe (Preece, 1977), and some confirmation of the underlying causal link between anxiety and disorder was subsequently obtained in a cross-lagged correlational study (Preece, 1979). Cata- strophe theory seems a good candidate for modelling phenomena containing discontinuities or sudden large variations. Thus, it has been used to model the transition between Piagetian stages (Saari, 1977) and the switch from misconcep- tions to scientific thought in pupils learning science (Boyes, 1988). I have used the butterfly catastrophe in a model of judgements in Piagetian conservation tasks (Preece, 1980). This attempted to account for discontinuities in cognition-for example, switching from centering on length to thickness in a conservation task -and the changes in behaviour as the subject progresses through the stages of intuitive, transitional and concrete thinking. As the above examples show, the formulation of general principles and of mathematical models, algebraic or topological, usually involves considerable ab- straction (i.e. conceptual subtraction from the full context) and the value of this is a crucial lesson from the physical sciences. Indeed, Popper (1982) has described science as "the art of systematic oversimplification" and has noted that "theories that are complex may become untestable, even if they happen to be true". This approach to educational research-imitatio physicca-has been presented here in the 'hundred flowers' spirit. "The question whether objective truth can be attri- buted to human thinking is not a question of theory but a practical question. In practice man must prove the truth, that is, the reality and power, the this-sidedness of his thinking" (Marx, 1957). Hence the physical science paradigm has been illustrated by examples so that the 'reality and power', or otherwise, of its products may be judged. Correspondence: P. F. W.
