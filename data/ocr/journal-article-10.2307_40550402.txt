<plain_text><page sequence="1">Between Wilderness and Civilization: bodies, Gesture, and the Aesthetics of Representational Subtraction Peter Williams This paper undertakes an investigation that is both meta- theoretical and pragmatic; meta-theoretical in that it relies upon what many refer to as "Big Theory,"1 and pragmatic in that theory is employed to chart the points of its own exhaustion when the necessary processes of ratiocination fall back onto the bad immediacy of the art or literary object itself. We are, in that moment, returned to the body as a site for the aesthetic, as art and aesthetics are once again hooked up to social praxis in the form of gesture. According to this method, the body would be configured as inseparable from creative activity; the body is feeling felt, it is the fact of thought immersed in the world that it thinks, and it expresses this world while it thinks it. I will argue that theory is necessary for an understanding of that process, but that its articulation takes on a more powerful and pragmatic form when suffused with a vocabulary of retrieval and embodiment rather than the more commonly encountered Big theoretical vocabulary of loss and disengaged rationalist equivalences. There is then a place for dense theoretical machinery that does not reduce to local theories of identity politics, just as there are artistic and literary works that stubbornly resist the easy sorts of politicization endemic to acts of contemporary literary criticism. I am not proposing a sentimentalized return to the body as an answer to the well-documented ills of modern rationality or as an unquestionably affirmative category. After all, the history of aesthetics is littered with the identification of the body as a site for pleasure and an antidote to reified conceptual activity set adrift from 1For a good discussion of what is at stake in the nomenclature for theory, all the local permutations that Big theory has spawned, and the state of theory in the current academic milieu, see Jeffrey Williams' "The Posttheory Generation." © symplokê Vol. 5, No. 1-2 (1997) ISSN 1069-0697, 73-94.</page><page sequence="2">74 Peter Williams Between Wilderness and Civilization sensuous practise.2 Nor do I propose adding to the already familiar and standard Lyotardian pluralism by enabling the propogation of many more "little narratives" always and everywhere encoded in singular and bizarre bodily gestures. Instead I am interested in those moments, occasioned by the enigmatic nature of presence and the subtractive representational strategies employed in the (post)modernist works I identify, when rational responses reach their limits, and we are thrown back onto the immediacy of the object itself. Unlike postmodernists, I do not consider such moments constitute a "poetics of indeterminacy" or a "literature of silence"-affect is not yet only a quality of memory. Rather, the non-representational works I describe generate significant affect at that horizon where a consciousness oriented by their subtractive representational strategies inhabits the interpretive constraints those strategies impose. That immediacy may cause pain rather than pleasure, and any pleasure that might accrue is in the domain of a negative pleasure not well articulated in the history of aesthetic theory. In this moment, meaning and materiality are radically re-sealed and, in the pain of their recombination, we are returned to the (im)possibilities of our own material existence, as well as to the somatic foundations of speech. I must begin by first tracing the inadequacies of existing theoretical approaches when confronting the issues of immediacy and representation in non-representational texts and artworks. Modernist critics tackled the issue of immediacy by aligning it with qualities of presence in representative modernist works. Michael Fried, for example, in 1968 claimed that "Presentness is grace" which one experiences as a "kind of instantaneousness: as though if only one were more acute, a single brief instant would be long enough to see everything, to experience the work in all its depth and fullness, to be forever convinced by it."3 Around the same time, Susan Sontag claimed that "transparence is the highest, most liberating value in art - and in criticism - today," where "transparence means experiencing the luminousness of the thing in itself, of things being what they are" (Against Interpretation 13). Sontag was wrong about criticism - disciples of Derrida ordained opacity over transparence, but she and Fried were right to characterize a trend in typically modernist thinking that positions immediacy and presence in conjunction with some form of "transparence" or "instantaneousness." 2Adorno has been the theorist most subtly and acutely sensitive to such movements in aesthetic theory. For him, it is in the shadow of the horrors and physical wretchedness of Auschwitz that the body most painfully, and most powerfully, penetrates into the previously rarefied world of aesthetics. He states in Negative Dialectics that, "If thought is not measured by the extremity that eludes the concept, it is from the outset in the nature of the musical accompaniment with which the SS liked to drown out the screams of its victims" (365). The only images of the body less than blasphemous then are those of his great exemplar, Samuel Beckett, whose skeletal and mutated figures reverse the plenitude of twentieth century "civil society." •^See Fried (1968).</page><page sequence="3">symplokë 75 The neo-idealist tone of such hypotheses, however, is betrayed by the rhetorical forms in which they are cast - either tautology in Sontag's formulation or, in Fried's case, metaphor. Derrida's early critique of the whole notion of presence clearly exposed how rhetorical forms shelter within their pathos the most decisive movements of the discourse itself. Indeed, Derrida's critique of presence is a critique of ideality itself, and it demonstrates that the immediateness and transparence critics like Fried and Sontag propose are themselves shadows of something else - shadows which set in motion a chain of improper namings that come to rest if, and only if, "metaphorical" is replaced by a more appropriate speech. Part of the difficulty exemplified by Fried and Sontag therefore has as much to do with the method of investigation as with its matter. They have cast vocabularies for presence in terms of an absolute presence, a transcendental or ideal space drawing all contents homogeneously to itself. But even in their most representationally fulfilled guise, modernist versions of presence were already highly abstracted and often configured as present even when literally absent. On the other hand, absence itself has sometimes posed as a kind of presence by being promoted as a site for allegorical hermeneutics or for the imprint of a variety of structural logics and political panoramas. Such attachments are hardly surprising; most modernist works themselves assumed presence as consciousness's starting point, and then proceeded to enlarge that out into and onto the phenomenal world. What followed was a sort of Dedalus voyage into the unknown, often to the accompaniment of a febrile sense of disorientation and nightmare. Emblematically modernist works as different as those of Eliot, Yeats and Woolf demonstrated a modernist consciousness most anxious about submitting its own imagined autonomy and integrity to the over-determining nature of political and historical forces in the social order.4 The polis and consciousness were bitterly opposed, the gut and the gaze violently separated. Modernists therefore straddled reification and risk: they hoped to reify the primacy and autonomy of authorial consciousness, but they risked losing identity's integrity if presence was swallowed or mutilated by cultural processes more powerful than itself. 4One cannot help but think of Eliot as the most prominent example here. We see what could be termed Prufrock's problem as a common theme in all of Eliot's work, even when it is most symbolically disguised. Take stanza III of Ash Wednesday, for example: "At the first turning of the third stair / Was a slotted window bellied like the fig's fruit / And beyond the hawthorn blossom and a pasture scene / The broadbacked figure dressed in blue and green / Enchanted the maytime with an antique flute. / Blown hair is sweet, brown hair over the mouth blown, / Lilac and brown hair; / Distraction, music of the flute, stops and steps of the mind / over the third stair, / fading, fading; strength beyond hope and despair / Climbing the third stair." Here Eliot seems less concerned with the obvious temptations of sexual transgression than with being forced to embrace a state of being that challenges the primacy of authorial consciousness.</page><page sequence="4">76 Peter Williams Between Wilderness and Civilization As a way of evading the threat of loss and dissolution and preserving autonomy and integrity, modernists often made presence more enigmatic through recondite processes of abstraction so that it eluded the grasp of historicism and social pressure. Cubists dissected it and hid it in and between curious depictions of musical instruments, contorted bulls and mechanical nudes.5 Surrealists transported it to the realm of dreams, nightmares and burning giraffes and, in the 1950's, abstract expressionists such as Jackson Pollock assigned it to the transmutability of creative and destructive energies in the artist's unconscious. Presence itself had thereby become a sort of Weberian iron cage, a metaphysical entity implicated in endless processes of signification and interpretation out of which modernists had made something primarily exclusionary, often glorifying, marginalizing or repressing those horizons that were strange, unfamiliar or uncanny.6 Presence, nearly by definition, could therefore never be fully present in modernist versions of representation but, as what Levinas terms proximity, was affected only in the sensibility approaching the cognition that represents.7 If the notion of transparency is to have any currency in the lexicon of presence it must be enlisted in the service of proximity in order to demonstrate how proximity itself can be made more immediate. That is, transparency must dissolve the distance between the sensibility that registers and the cognition that represents. There are a number of (post)modernist artists, writers and musicians who have undertaken such a project. Many of the works of John Cage, Agnes Martin, Frank Stella and Samuel Beckett, for instance, exemplify a significant shift in compositional energies away from the autonomy of modernist conceptions of creativity and unconscious 5The examples here could consist of a list of all the icons of modernist art. I am, however, specifically thinking of Pablo Picasso's Guernica and Guitar, Sheet Music, and Wine Glass; Marcel Duchamp's Nude Descending Staircase and Georges Braque's Portrait of Chess Players. The surrealists include Salvador Dali's Burning Giraffe. Also of interest here is the surrealist poetry of Benjamin Peret and Paul Eluard. In all these works, one cannot help but be struck by the (romantic) attempt to furnish the means for the presentation of pure feeling, to spring excesses of pure emotion from an essentially romantic framework uncontaminated by the already fallen domain of the social. Picasso's sphere was pure space and its differentiation, and it is this space that creates the colors which express states of feeling. The most common term for this dissolution of materiality is abstraction. bFreud reveals "that the uncanny is something which is secretly familiar which has undergone repression and then returns from it, and that everything that is uncanny fulfills this condition . . . the prefix 'un' is the token of repression" (Freud 1955, 245). The uncanny then opens the door for all the allegorical, illusionist and psychological readings of modernist texts so strongly resisted by postmodernists in general, and minimalists in particular. 7Levinas describes the concept of proximity as somehow bridging the distance from which cognition represents (viz., envisions the presence of) its object. This movement was first articulated in his analysis of the caress, but was also extended to touch: "but the caresses are dormant in all contact, and contact in all sensible experience . . . the thematized disappears in the caress, in which the thematization becomes a proximity" (Levinas 191, n.10).</page><page sequence="5">symploke 77 impulses to highly structured exercises in iconic subtraction. Rather than abstracting representational registers they subtracted them, so focusing our attention upon the literalness of art objects and literary pieces and constraining our interpretive practices through a confrontation with the thingness^ of the object of attention itself. Frank Stella, for example, said of his work that, only what can be seen there is there. It really is an object . . . . If the painting were lean enough, accurate enough, or right enough, you would be able to just look at it. All I want anyone to get out of my paintings, and all I want to get out of them, is the fact that you see the whole idea without any confusion .... What you see is what you see.9 Art objects and literary works by these authors and artists were supposed to embody and project the ideal of transparency through pure visuality or literality: the art object is reduced to a purely visual presence, the written text to a purely linguistic play. Readers and viewers are similarly reduced to linguistic subjects' or 'pure eyes' that compel strict behaviors of perception by muting the last vestiges of those subjective responses that might dilute, taint or allegorize a purely pictorial or linguistic sequence. The hypothesis that transparency is achieved through some notion of purity - either visual or linguistic - points to a discontinuity between what should be and what is. It could perhaps be said that these works of art are not what they are supposed to be: instead of being fully or transparently present they still function only as metaphors for presence because the work of art or the literary piece does not grant immediacy of vision but communicates only the dream of that immediacy. The possibility that Stella may be unable to move beyond what he calls the "old humanistic values," for instance, is reflected in the affective possibilities that prolong the sensory contact with his works, that go beyond the immediacy of the paint on the canvas. But the pursuit of those possibilities has not been well handled by contemporary critical vocabularies. The neo-idealist tone10 of much modernist aesthetic discourse has been either silenced or led into hermeneutic cul-de-sacs by these works' recalcitrant orientation towards surfaces and impermeability. And postmodernists have surrendered much of the power of their emphasis on language's quiddity by forfeiting claims on affect and 8aThingness" is here used in the Heideggerian sense of a prolongation of the search for a simplified principle of reality. In this instance, the transcendence of sensation is rejected in favor of the admission of a brute confrontation with the art object itself. See Heidegger (1975). 9Quoted by Bruce Glasser (1968, 157-58). I have already described the main way in which much modernist aesthetic critique is neo-idealist. I would also add that the modernist tendency to assume a transcendental community, sharing universal values and laws, as the basis for aesthetic models grounded in psychological or allegorical readings of artistic and literary works, adds to the idealistic tone of much modernist criticism.</page><page sequence="6">78 Peter Williams Between Wilderness and Civilization history. Instead, in the fashion of contemporary politics, they have staked all on the charisma of those who tell the story. Consequently, we commonly find commentators embracing a vocabulary of failure - a "poetics of indeterminacy," a "literature of silence" or an "arts of impoverishment"11 - when addressing these works. Such characterizations are but more metaphorical descriptors however, reflecting ultimate failure in as much as the logic of their propositions presupposes distinctions that can only repeat what they seek to expose. Structuralism and poststructuralism are not able to advance us much further. While very good at illuminating the ways that rationality renders the terms of its own engagements and constructions, theory that is strictly structural or poststructural offers only what I would call modalizations or disembodied versions of aesthetic experience detached from an affective substrate or a background in the world and its processes. The fact that the 'linguistically positioned eye' that sees is essentially in a body which is also hand, foot and nervous system seems too often forgotten. Octoberists such as Rosaliiid Krauss, for example, find it useful to apply such strategies to their laudatory analyses of modernist artworks,12 but the limitations of their approach begin to be felt when one tries to re-assimilate the results of their analysis back into the visceral and bodily responses to the artworks themselves. We are left with an intelligent but disembodied version of relational reality that gives Cartesian duality more credibility than it deserves because we are encouraged to regard consciousness as immanent and details of the sensuous as indifferent. Indifference is compounded because the (anti-)epistemology of poststructuralist critiques also always focuses on the inevitability of a certain type of failure, to the point where the suggestion that something in a text or artwork does not quite make it, nThese terms are taken from the titles of two important works that attempted to deal with what I have elsewhere termed minimalist works. The first is from Marjorie Perloffs Poetics of Indeterminacy: Rimbaud to Cage, and the second returns us to Ihab Hassan's The Literature of Silence: Henry Miller and Samuel Beckett. My quarrel with the sort of thinking exemplified by these works is that they regard a negative epistemology as ontologically static; "silence" and "indeterminacy" are allowed to close upon themselves and rest as categories of representation, as positive negations. They thereby become ontologies rather then instruments of interrogation. For the purpose of my argument, silence is not "the disruption of all connections between language and reality" (Hassan 22) because, if nothing else, the texts he discusses demonstrate just how much language is a condition of reality. Rather, silence is language's encounter with the uncertain, the contradictory and the unspeakable; it is, finally, a skillfully structured exercise in iconic subtraction. And Perloff settles for indeterminacy because "totality" (a coherent symbolic structure) "is absent" (10). She therefore proposes "undecidability" as the criterion for indeterminacy - a path that inevitably leads to the hermeneutic pound resulting from working texts against interpretive models, rather than letting the texts themselves generate the terms for their own understanding. More recently, but in a continuation of the same critical vein, Bersani and Dutoit have released Arts of Impoverishment: Beckett, Rothko and Resnais. 12Rosalind Krauss has been the most prolific and, I think, the most influential in this critical vein. See particularly Krauss (1977), (1980), and (1984).</page><page sequence="7">symplokê 79 has always already failed or fails to deviate from what it never exactly was, has hardened into a conventional insistence. I am therefore proposing a neo-phenomenological approach to the affect of these highly subtracted works if we are to escape the hermeneutic pound of a poetics of indeterminacy or a literature of silence. Such an approach must begin by, first, mediating the subtracted forms of presence in these works with what Merleau-Ponty calls the "flesh of the world" (mapping the contours of the eye's or ear's orientation to the visible or audible field) and, then, showing how the play of différance in the signals these works generate serve as analogues for our own physical presence. Then, in the spirit of Wittgenstein, by linking our aesthetic responses to the modes of reflexivity that our embodiment can employ, I will suggest that proximity is made more immediate by our cognitive modes of representation being pushed down into the body and its nerve nets where they are expressed as gestures. Presence is therefore affected in the body where it is felt as an affect of the regime of positioning and re-positioning, reading and re-reading that these works impose, rather than an affect of an abstract, conceptual referentiality. Two We can start by allowing the poststructural position that language itself may be shaped by a play of différance which suspends its particular formulations. But then in order not to become completely enmeshed in the turn towards language we must also see the ways that différance itself shapes self-consciousness as an orientation towards the world. This is because self-consciousness can no longer be understood in its more humanistic versions of pure self- awareness pivoting on its own rationality; instead, its relational reality is indeterminate and centerless as it awaits engagement and orientation. Self-consciousness is therefore not something independent of and separate from, in this case, the discursiveness of Beckett's "midget grammar,"13 Cage's auditory signals or Martin's autotelic grids. Derrida reminds us in Positions that the a of différance also recalls that spacing is temporization, the detour and postponement by means of which intuition, perception, consummation - in a word, the relationship to the present, the reference to a present, the reference to a present reality, to a being are always deferred. Deferred by virtue of the very principle of difference which holds that an element functions and signifies, takes on or conveys meaning, only by referring to another past or future in an economy of traces. (28-9) 13 So-called by the writer/traveller/narrator in Samuel Beckett's How It Is.</page><page sequence="8">80 Peter Williams Between Wilderness and Civilization and on these terms it is difficult to see how consciousness can be present to itself or to its objects in any kind of formal or perfect congruence. Self-consciousness is not self-presence. Rather, it is distributed somewhere between the field of language and other sign systems with which we engage the world. Emerging from such a network of signifying relations is a presence present to a re-positioned visual and auditory awareness. But it is not of the self-sufficient or autonomous type. Instead, it is evanescent, appearing in these works only when it is defined against a complex background of other visual and auditory items and relations. Such relations are enacted by a number of modernist and postmodernist writers, artists and composers. In William Carlos Williams' poem, The Attic Which Is Desire (325), we see a movement that is characteristic of many representationally subtracted works: the unused tent of bare beams beyond which directly wait the night and day - Here from the street by * * * *s* *o* *D * *A* * * * ringed with running lights the darkened pane exactly down the center is transfixed This poem leaves no basis, or potential, for action. The verbs are predominantly passive and the participles are past ("ringed," "darkened," "transfixed") pointing to absence or the presence of past</page><page sequence="9">symplokê 81 potentials only. The only immediate presence here (apart from the sign) is the capacity of language to form structural patterns (again like the sign). These patterns render the details of the description on a more abstract level and define the basic contacts between the movement of the sensibility registering the phenomenological details of the scene and the stillness and emptiness characterizing the grammar of the description itself. Williams thereby subtly suffuses the details of a highly subtracted description with a sense of need and desire, preserving affective density while presenting textual spareness. Presence can be only inferred here; it is traced by the eye's movement to the concrete (the subject of "transfixed") from the abstract, empty "unused tent/of/bare beams/' The entire scene itself becomes a transfixed reflection of a contact with a sentient consciousness, now engaged by the traces of its own desire. If presence can only be inferred in Williams' poem, then the recovery of the criteria for presence as a presence in the world that allows for an accurate and historical description seems doomed to a certain failure. The recitation of the elements that might articulate it must therefore assume a new order because presence is now never simply present, but can only be reconstructed from momentary flickers on the edges of one's perceptual field or the sensual stirrings evoked by one's exposure to these representationally subtracted works. Often, presence is held neither in language nor in the world, but in an intermediate state marked by the repetition of precise linguistic formulations representing affective qualities such as desire in the form of recursive symmetries through time. Robert Creeley's work often inhabits the same domain of failure as his narrators lose the narrative, and themselves, in the ceaseless and circular talk of his curious short stories. "Three Fate Tales," for example, begins: I put it this way. That I am, say, myself, that this, or this feel, you can't have, or from that man or this, me, you can't take it. And what I would do, with any of this, is beyond you, and mine. But for this time, yours too. (32) These very Beckettian resonances rely on the semantic instability of the pronouns "it," "that," and "this". As the mobile subject of the paragraph swirls around with the shifting pronouns, Creeley's phrasing is so confounding that narrative folds on itself rather than developing a potential for a referentially oriented sequence. Only the presence of language itself is reflected, so any referential or meaningful item in the narrator's repertoire is only recognized as such insofar as it makes at least tacit reference to other such items in the pronoun list. But as Creeley's story proceeds, we find a repetition of the same desire for the discovery of presence which is given shape only through its inflexion towards the sensuous: It isn't known. I make that sense of it, that it isn't known, any of it. This woman or his girl or what has happened, and</page><page sequence="10">82 Peter Williams Between Wilderness and Civilization how I would have it, or my hand there. To feel. To be felt. Which they want, or I want more than seeing. (33) A capacity for orientation to presence, distributed somewhere in and between the field of language in general and the formal syntax of the work itself, is then affected by its absence. But it can be constructed as an analog of the eye's movement over the spatial arrangement of the words on the page, and is shifting, opaque and semantically inexhaustible. Presence flickers, sometimes caught by the eye or ear as something external or peripheral to the textual content itself rather than as a solid and stable entity within a fully disclosed totality. Presence is treated with skepticism (nothing is simply present), but a distinctive account of the relationship between perception's disclosure of presence and its articulation in symbolic formations such as language is offered. Such a disclosure always flirts with simply reiterating self- reflecting linguistic formulations of the type demonstrated by Creeley before he introduces inflexions towards the sensuous. An extreme example of this tendency is to be found in the work of Gertrude Stein, especially in pieces such as "Patriarchal Poetry" and "Picasso": This one was working and something was coming then, something was coming out of this one then. This one was one and always there was something coming out of this one and always there had been something coming out of this one. This one had never been not having something coming out of this one. This one was one having something coming out of this one. This one had been one whom some were following. This one was one whom some were following. This one was one who was working. (334) Here different permutations of a single linguistic formulation attempt to build on the traces of preceding sentences (so promising the density of a linguistic Cubism), but succeed only in canceling them out. In Stein's hands, this palimpsest maps little more than an empty set. Rather than fulfilling the promise of texture and density, each sentence presents such an accurate index of possible alternative syntactic arrangements that description itself loses all referential quality. Instead it simply enumerates the variety of articulations made possible by a single narrative motif. Presence is therefore so discursive in these texts that one despairs of it ever becoming actual. Or its actuality can only be inferred as an analogue to its absence, so we are caught in the domain of possibility (but not indeterminacy) rather than identifiable location. Yet our responses to the nothingness of these texts and artworks compound in a sort of reflexive immediacy shaped by the likenesses of context and strategy, and the repetition of particular obsessions and desires these works invoke. And while it is easy to see such discursive notions of presence permitting interpretations to cascade one upon the other, it is more powerful to actually inhabit and explore the interpretive</page><page sequence="11">symplokè 83 limitations these works impose as they systematically reduce the range of the meaning-to-say from the said. We can do that by seeing how subtracted, non-referential forms of representation map a distinctive, discursive enactment of presence grounded by, and gravitating around, our own renewed sense of embodiment and its (im)possibilities. Three Carl Andre forces his audience to walk in and around and, sometimes, on his work, rather than standing facing it in a posture with devotional analogues. The freedom that Andre permits entails a mobilization of the viewers, but it is balanced by a constraint: viewers are compelled to accept and align themselves with an underlying geometricization of space that is, at the same time, dense on the surface.14 The play of freedom and constraint is a materializing force for Andre, deriving from the equivocalness of the distinction between three dimensions and two. Through systematic lexical fragmentation, narrative suspension and the use of different referential systems, discourse in Samuel Beckett's Company also manages to challenge the objective limits of representation at the same time that it exemplifies the sentence as a materializing force. Différance as a linguistic entity is fleshed out by the "I" of Company in the form of acknowledgement and acquiescence: the "I" finally acknowledged by the reader as company is derived from the fluidity of the pronominal paradigm which yields an enactment of the way linguistic structures can be materializing forces. This achievement recognizes that the semantic content of each pronoun itself represents différance insofar as it is a position which gathers content only in relation to other pronominal positions. The way that différance opens into and onto the world is then exacted in the display of different pronouns working as functional constituents of the "I," rather than confirming it as the object of a direct and simple reference. These substitutive changes constituting the "I" then become the designation of a presence conceived in such a way that it cannot be expressed directly but only inferred. But it is the co- existence of at least two internal systems of referentiality that becomes the instrument through which inference attains a degree of 14 Andre's Twelfth Copper Corner, which lies flat and tightly abutted on the floor, invites viewers to walk on it. The viewer's upright posture then reiterates the gravitational vector that consolidates sculpture both physically and psychologically. Treading upon one of Andre's metal-plate arrays establishes a physical relation to the art object which is far more direct than most works of art permit. And it also verifies that the sculpture, like most minimalist works, contains no space of its own with the potential to act as metaphor for the transcendence of the art object itself by a meaning. All of Andre's work exemplifies his rejection of the notion that the meaning of a work of art is a numinous metaphysical accompaniment to the visible object. The same argument can also be made for minimalist literary texts.</page><page sequence="12">84 Peter Williams Between Wilderness and Civilization clarity and precision, once the reader is made aware of their convergence on the same composite site. The following passage provides an essential clue to this understanding: Use of the second person marks the voice. That of the third that cankerous other. Could he speak to and of whom the voice speaks there would be a first. But he cannot. He shall not. You cannot. You shall not. (8) Presence, in the form of persons, is here designated through two simultaneous systems of reference: one is the habitual pronominal and lexical apparatus (using the "he" and "you," the "other," "to/of whom" and "the voice"). The other does not use but merely describes the elements of the first system ("the second person," "the third," "a first"). This duplicity of use of the same pronominal system of reference produces the same general ambiguity of reference which characterized the earlier example from Creeley as it also suspends any direct reference to the object, providing instead a figure of it only (as a "first" person). But Beckett's more rigorous use of the two systems clarifies the fact that the passage makes explicit reference to presence (as an "I") because, rather than simply reflecting linguistic structures, the two systems converge in pointing it out: "there would be first" person if he could "speak to and of whom the voice speaks." The complexity of this pseudo-referential discourse works inferentially, showing the elusiveness of locating and naming presence (as, in this case, an "I"), while hiding its essentially relational nature which, however, continually tries to appear in the narrative. A sense of presence is therefore manifested only through the syntactic movements of the text because no discrete lexical unit could adequately capture its complex nature. No single formulation of presence can contain an adequate representation of its fullness and complexity ("Could he speak . . . But he cannot. He shall not. You cannot. You shall not"), but the movement of the negatives here functions crucially to give a sense of that "I". In this way, différance enacts the translatability of persons into referents, primarily through the common method of pronominal exchanges. However, these exchanges do not and cannot reflect a unified, modernist "I" with referential presence and self-sameness; at best they demonstrate a configuration of positions which, while inseparable from language itself, become readable as a constraining sequence or movement of negatives producing the effect of presence in the sensibility that approaches cognition. The nature of presence caught by this movement is the result of our work on the text and its work on us: it does appear, but only as an effect of readability and re-readability rather than as the representation of a conceptual referentiality. In the movement between the two pronominal systems of reference, we are forced to analogously position and re-position ourselves with respect to the lexical codes on the page. These shifts then enable a mode of reflexive</page><page sequence="13">symplokê 85 self-awareness through which we are made at least tacitly aware of ourselves as embodied subjects who occupy a part of the auditory and visual field. We must therefore entertain the dialectic of a dual perspective as we participate in the acts of engagement these works require - we respond and then, at the same time, we are compelled to respond to ourselves responding. To use Merleau-Ponty's term, we are in an "entrelac" - a criss-crossing web of connections between ourselves and our awareness of a strategic positioning and re- positioning. But there is also, to continue his language, a "chiasme" (16), a criss-crossing that involves a split leading to an ineradicable otherness in the sense of what we see or experience. This split is intensified and then paradoxically re-sealed when the object of our attention has been arrested from the background noise and tacit connections that surround us by our engagement with it. The phenomenal world is therefore no longer the potential threat that it seemed to those modernists who saw it as the source of shipwrecked consciousness and the doom of the autonomous subject. For artists such as Beckett, Andre and Stella, consciousness seems already external to the subject who spends a good deal of time trying to gather it from the patterns of attention their works administer. Unlike many postmodernists who dogmatize irresolution and discontinuity, however, these artists exchange impossible definitions of the real with a lucid tautology that skirts the pitfalls, creases and folds of reality itself. Beckett's insistence on the importance of missaying,15 for example, seems to reflect a sort of post- modernist/poststructuralist nihilism inasmuch as it addresses the impossibility of defining, but it never transforms this impossibility into a positive negation. Instead, it accepts missaying as a mode of discourse while seeing, at the same time, that discourse itself keeps changing and does not close on its own impotence. This is an epistemological project orienting our attention toward the content and structure of previous statements which are then questioned as the presuppositions of a present knowledge. But these patterns are not those of the palimpsest, and they do not represent the same kind of failure exemplified by Stein. Instead, the issues for Beckett are verifiability and reference, which are posited so prominently in Company: Only a small part of what is said can be verified. As for example when he says, You are on your back in the dark. Then he must acknowledge the truth of what is said. By far the greater part of what is said cannot be verified. As for example when he hears, You first saw the light on such and such a day. Sometimes the two are combined as for example, You first saw the light on such and such a day and now you are on your back in the dark. A device perhaps 15"Say for be said. Missaid. From now say for be missaid" (Beckett 1983, 7).</page><page sequence="14">86 Peter Williams Between Wilderness and Civilization from the incontrovertibility of one to win credence for the other. That is then the proposition. (7) Once again, there are at least two central sentences concerned with an epistemological issue in this passage. One regards the unverifiable nature of most statements or parts of statements ("By far the greater part of what is said cannot be verified"); the other, of a metalinguistic nature, calls to the reader's attention the value content of any statement ("That is then the proposition"). Thus the narrative invites the reader to see that there is no transparency or immediacy in Beckett's linguistic formulations, which is like saying that sameness can never be maintained in spite of the similarity in referents or the repetition of similar linguistic constructions. Furthermore, what we often perceive to be immediacy is often just another form of translation carried out by devices subjugated by a different logic and directed by a different teleology ("A device perhaps from the incontrovertibility of one [statement?] to win credence for the other"). In order for any (knowledge?) to be achieved, it is necessary for the reader to go through a reflexive formulation which, on the one side does not rely on any a priori ontological objectivity but, on the other, moves beyond the closure of metalinguistic description. We can see how this works concretely in the last two sentences of the above passage, which must be read as one unit. Only together do they produce the right image of a (post)modern episteme: "That is then the proposition. To one on his back in the dark a voice tells of the past." Not only is the linguistic nature of description shown by a metanarrative statement ("that then is the proposition"), but description is itself substantially modified by it because it is impossible for the reader to ignore the visibility of language in relation to the "one on his back in the dark." We are moved from the linguistic structure of a proposition to an embodied, concrete position in the (dark) world. The narrative thus enacts the idea that reading of the text may be nothing more than a series of "better failures," as All of old. Nothing else ever. Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail better. (Beckett 1983, 7) No contextual selection of formalized segments of meaning will ever offer an effective alternative to the universality of missaying. But this also means that interpretive alternatives, while limited, are possible and they can acquire a recuperative effect as a semantic movement in which the value of specific choices can be diachronically retrieved. In spite of Beckett's own embrace of impoverishment these communicational strategies are rich, demonstrating that although access to presence is not assured and there is no effective way of having words map reality directly, there is an epistemological value in interrogating the limits of language (and, perhaps, theory) in relation to presence and reference. That presence itself may exist</page><page sequence="15">symplokë 87 independently of language, and that our access to it may never be instantaneous but always mediated or, like Beckett's later characters, mutated, appeals to embodied subjects who feel themselves living in the world and sharing the need for communication. The chiasmas is crossed, inverted, then paradoxically re-sealed because the density of Beckett's disembodied textures seems to close off the possibility of any emergence at a surface level only, emphasizing instead the possibilities for process as content. Four What possibilities are there for an affective response to Samuel Beckett's Act Without Words? To Agnes Martin's Night Sea? How do we make sense of Martin's claim that her use of the grid form encourages the eye to participate in an uninterrupted, non-selective "free and easy wandering"; an activity she hoped would induce a "holiday state of mind."16 Or Beckett's similar sentiment, expressed in Proust, that the parameters for the divorce of an alert perception from a convention-bound will depend upon a "relaxation of the subject's habit of thought and a reduction in the radius of his memory, a generally diminished tension of consciousness . . . "(54)? Clearly, these texts and artworks are enormously difficult to interpret in the conventional sense, and therefore even more difficult to politicize. In spite of the best efforts of some commentators to assign them high political content, these works' tenuous connection to referential detail and their subtracted representational content evade the easy sort of political allegorizations endemic to so much contemporary literary criticism. This is not to say they are void of political content. Inasmuch as an Andre piece or a Beckett performance can be read as a radical critique of the institutional and perceptual practices that assign certain cultural validations and values to artworks, they are clearly political.17 But this is a 16Quoted in Haskell (1992, 64). 17I have yet to see many powerful, overtly political, critiques of this genre of works. It is true that Adorno, in Aesthetic Theory, homeopathically uses Beckett as an exemplar of the end of a particular sort of bourgeois consciousness by, as Terry Eagleton says, feeding us "sickness as cure." And Anna Chave has condemned what she considers to be the fascist overtones of minimalism by pointing to its "intensely negative response." But the way that minimalist artists use "negative response" and institutional space (art museums) to throw their own work into high relief is similar to Beckett's ambivalent use of "the theater." Both bring to mind the tension in Foucault's conflicted attitude towards institutions and institutional life. On the one hand he is, in one sense, a libertarian hoping to emancipate human life from the shackles of institutions and the powers institutionalized by them. On the other hand, he is unable to believe for a moment that human life could be anything other than institutional life, or proceed by ways other than particular disciplines and techniques. Like most poststructuralists, he is deeply skeptical of the Utopian dream that heterogeneity could ever be completely released from categories and institutions, the forms of discursive and non-discursive domestication, which alone lend it social embodiment. It seems to</page><page sequence="16">88 Peter Williams Between Wilderness and Civilization particular sort of political content claiming our interest only as long as it is considered in the particular situations these works define for us, and against those specific backgrounds in which they are displayed. For much of the power of these works lies in their attempt to illuminate how, and how much, we communicate by appeals to convention. To then invoke conventional and overworked political codes in their evaluation does little more than show how easily those codes are exhausted and defeated by the impermeability of these works themselves, and how strongly aesthetics are able to re-assert themselves over ethics. In one sense, we may therefore profit more from just letting them be, approaching them with a "holiday state of mind," and avoiding protracted processes of ratiocination and exegesis, than using them to test our interpretive prowess. And in many ways, "letting be" is precisely what postmodernism (and, apparently, Martin and Beckett) urges us to do in order to indulge ourselves in the "thingness" of the art objects or their presentation,18 leaving aside carefully constructed and often idealized models of rational and aesthetic response. Instead, we are urged to appreciate them under the terms of their own interpretive constraints and limits, and their refusal to provide audiences with a subject with which to work.19 Viewers and readers are then thrown into a sort of pre-reflective, psychologically Fichtean state that makes the world one's own by reframing their responses under the gestalt of seeing as: seeing non-representational art objects me that an investigation of this conflicted ambivalence, this instrumental dependence upon and fundamental rejection of institutions and institutional life, would yield the most powerful political critiques of minimalist works. löBoth letting be and thingness are Heideggerian terms, but Lyotard makes a similar move, though he uses a different vocabulary, in Just Gaming where he agrees that L'Economie libidinale may give the impression that its theses are not to be discussed because of what he terms the violent separation between its mode of presentation (lexis) and its content (logos). He then says, "But actually they can be discussed ... it is possible to read the book skipping over all the rhetorical machinery, whether spontaneous or not, and perhaps one can realize then that the book is completely inconsistent from this point of view" (5). This seems a refreshingly simple approach to questions of both representation and the protocols of reading, but buried within it is also the familiar concept of the writer's art as a test of the reader's interpretive strength. *9In 1961 Robert Morris stood a gray, two feet wide and six-and-one-half feet long rectangular column of plywood motionless on stage for three and a half minutes. It was then toppled over onto its side by the artist who lay motionless inside it for a further three and a half minutes before the curtain fell. This lack of a subject also brings to mind Samuel Beckett's Act Without Words I and //, and many other 'absurdist' performance and dramatic pieces. But these performances are not simply absurd. Morris's piece, for example, reduced dramatic action to the vicissitudes of a stage prop which resembled the horizontals and verticals of the grids so prevalent in non- representational painting. It dramatized the phallic and anthropomorphic signification of a columnar object which also played upon the climax and anti-climax of performance itself. In denying (or randomizing) the sites for audiences' emotional investments, artists like Beckett and Morris sorely disappoint those seeking some meaning from their works. At best, satisfaction can be gained from the rationalization that the sensation of conclusions indefinitely postponed may be propitious.</page><page sequence="17">symplokê 89 as tokens oí anti-art; seeing them as creating some kind of precipitant vacuum where rarefied aesthetic airs were perhaps anticipated; seeing them as replacing aesthetic detail with the subjective texture of the time it took to reconcile oneself to the object's true and complete emptiness. Seeing as20 could then be aligned with letting be, both articulating presence in these works as a zone of emergence between work and reader or viewer rather than as something transparent, something definite and simply there. The parameters of this zone can be provisionally defined as the overwhelming of our powers of perception and ratiocination by the presentation of simplicity in the processes and relations these works represent - in the ways their surfaces are also depths, in the ways their regulatory laws are everywhere absolute yet nowhere visible. They therefore define an aesthetic mediating the relations between part and whole in such a way that specificity of detail genuinely resists the organizing power of an aesthetic totality, an aesthetic that preserves particularity but fissures identity. Excesses generally point in the direction of a sublimicist sensibility which, in the Kantian sense, comes into play at precisely this limit-point of language and representation where cognitive and imaginative processes inhabit discordant antinomies. At this point some texts and artworks produce an excess of signification. The point is an encounter lacking a language that might phrase it adequately, a point at which language encounters a silence rather than silence simply being language's absence. It is where, as Thomas Weiskel put it in The Romantic Sublime: Studies in the Structure and Psychology of Transcendence, Meaning is overwhelmed by an overdetermination .... We are reading and suddenly we are caught up in a word (or any signifying argument) which seems to contain so much there is nothing we 'cannot read' into it. What threatens here is stasis. A kind of death by plenitude .... Which destroys the seeking for a signifier .... (26-7) Weiskel termed this the "positive" or "métonymie" sublime. I would, however, revise his formulation and, by applying it to the types of representationally subtracted works I have already identified, align it with the 'negative' sublime by supplementing Weiskel's wording with "seems to contain so [little] there is nothing we 'cannot read' into it." This formulation makes available not only the profusion of possible meanings, but also the possibility of the complete lack of them. As Weiskel describes it, in the next phase of the experience, "the mind recovers by displacing its excess of signified into a dimension of contiguity which may be spatial or temporal" (29). On these terms, we compensate for the excess of meaning by channelling it into 20For a fuller discussion of Wittgenstein's "seeing as," duck/rabbit issue, see Gombrich's (1960). See also, Wittgenstein (1968, 194).</page><page sequence="18">90 Peter Williams Between Wilderness and Civilization streams of determinate and continuous imagery which expresses or connotes a sense of that excess from which it sprang. We are thus plunged into an aesthetic domain, or a rather extreme case of what Kant would call an "aesthetic idea." This he defined in The Critique of Judgement as "that representation of the imagination which occasions much thought, without however any definite thought, i.e., any concept, being capable of being adequate to it; it consequently cannot be completely compassed and made intelligible by language" (157). Jean-Francois Lyotard in The Postmodern Condition puts it another way by saying "We can conceive of the infinitely great, the infinitely powerful, but every presentation of an object destined to 'make visible' this absolute greatness appears to us as painfully inadequate. Those are Ideas of which no presentation is possible" (78). The works I have discussed here are neither infinitely great nor are they infinitely powerful. They do however fit Weiskel's description of the métonymie sublime in that they employ formal strategies which invoke similar overwhelming associations, though these may develop as a negative potential rather than a positive one. That is, incomprehensibility itself may be a principle of judgement which ultimately leads to a "holiday state of mind". This violence to one's cognitive prowess resembles Kant's notion of "negative pleasure" when "there is a feeling of the inadequacy of his imagination for presenting the ideas of a whole, wherein the imagination reaches its maximum, and, in striving to surpass it, sinks back into itself, by which, however, a kind of emotional satisfaction is produced" (91). But it may be that Weiskel's notion of economy may be too static. For in our interactions with the world we do broadly strive to achieve states of equilibrium, but this striving does not necessarily reduce to a quasi-mechanical balance between loss of meaning at one cognitive level and a gain elsewhere in a constant total field of mental energy. In the complexity of our embodied engagement with these works, we can accrue net losses or gains without the mediating ministrations of compensation. Then the excesses of signification are handled reflexively and immediately, rather than being channelled into streams of determinate and continuous imagery as we read and re- read, position and re-position21 ourselves in time with the unfamiliar rituals of language and representation these texts and artworks display. 21 1 am aware that the use of the terms position and re-position immediately brings to mind the sort of positional analysis undertaken by Marxist critics such as those of Louis Althusser, and Judith Butler in Gender Trouble. Althusser is careful to separate theoretical from practical ideologies as a way of tempering the determinations of universal law, but both see human action as a sort of blindfolded, manipulated operation which we can only watch helplessly. I would make the distinction in my own use of the terms position and re-position that we are only (though powerfully) oriented by these art objects and literary works, not determined and constituted by them. We therefore enter into a more subtle, a more phenomenological relationship with our cultural world which enables richer versions of an aesthetic than strictly Marxist ones.</page><page sequence="19">symplokë 91 These movements occasion a recognition of the sublime, but following from that realization is a sublime aesthetic rather than an aesthetic of the sublime. The sublime produces a feeling, but it cannot legislate or even find communicative consensus. So while the works of minimalist artists and writers evoke the sublime, they cannot form the basis for an aesthetic of the sublime because they are constituted only by a question rather than the more familiar modernist models of systems or answers. They do, nevertheless, mark an identifiable site for reflection or indeterminate judgement. Kant has established that there is no sensus commuais for the sentiment of the sublime, as there is for the judgement of taste in the estimation of the beautiful: Pleasure in the sublime in nature, regarded as a pleasure of rational contemplation, also makes claim to universal participation, but it presupposes, besides, a different feeling, viz. that of our supersensible destination, which, however obscurely, has a moral foundation. But that other men will take account of it and will find a satisfaction in the consideration of the wild greatness of nature (that certainly cannot be ascribed to its aspect, which is rather terrifying) I am not absolutely justified in supposing. (134) As he takes pains to point out, there can be no sensus commuais because the sublime leads directly to an illumination of one's moral feeling, and moral feeling is a concept of reason that is subjectively felt a priori. The way these works preserve particularity then throws into relief our desire to establish consensus where there can be none, to define a sublime aesthetic where the consensual grounds are themselves a sublime sentiment which forbid exactly the sort of patterning a totalizing modernist aesthetic would require (a transcendent universal community). These works cannot then be aligned with an aesthetic of the sublime. Instead, they constitute a sublime aesthetic, one that is not amenable to political/sociological reduction or moves towards idealized or transcendental "communities." Given the singularity of the aesthetic responses these works impose, and their appeal to our own embodiment and sense of presence in the world, it may be that gestures are our most appropriate aesthetic response. Gestures express those excesses of signification that have been pushed down into the nerve nets of physical embodiment in forms that are both singular and communal; singular in their ability to express one's response to an aspect of the work in an immediate and idiosyncratic way, and communal in their possibilities for an aesthetic language that is unspoken, thereby skirting the need for common language rules or even the assumed, consensual grounds upon which languages are built. Gestures also release us from the protracted processes of ratiocination common to most aesthetic judgments, and they speak well to the particular forms of representation in these works by implying that this sublime</page><page sequence="20">92 Peter Williams Between Wilderness and Civilization aesthetic questions rules or criteria for representation rather than providing intellectual models for it. The regime of positioning and re- positioning in the acts of reading and viewing these texts and artworks require are not just subliminal or singularly, privately psychological. They are often very public gestures fraught with uncertainty and self-consciousness. Who, after all, has not sometimes begrudged Beckett his ability to evoke raucous laughter as the most intelligent response to some painfully precise linguistic impasse, who has not grinned with satisfaction upon the spectacle of bewildered fellow theater-goers squirming in their seats, or getting up and leaving, during the performance of one his very short plays? These responses are not just analogous reminders of our own physical embodiment; they are also expressive of real and significant affect where an impenetrable surface - one that withdraws from every relationship and refuses all dialogue and dialectic - meets an engaged consciousness oriented towards, and momentarily constituted by, its contact with that surface. Modernists and postmodernists alike recognize the importance of the body as a yardstick for affect. We have already seen the three dimensional work of Carl Andre force the viewer to walk in and on and around it. And Marguerite Duras speaks to the essence of embodiment when, in The Lover she claims: The story of my life doesn't exist. Does not exist. There's never any center to it. No path, no line. There are great spaces where you pretend you used to be someone, but it's not true, there was no one. (8) Like the movement of Beckett's negatives, Duras' emphatic repetition of "does not exist" exaggerates the absence of a formal self- identification this narrator must recognize before she can begin to construct a presence from the linguistic signals composing the history which is her own life story. That history, and her own physical presence, is recoverable as she writes because it has been pushed down into the body and its synapses, where the associative pleasures of lips and skin, and the loose arrangement of entwined limbs, are registered. It is the body itself that mediates here, as it seeks, finds and takes "what it likes" and then "everything is right and nothing is wasted" (43). We may now be more clearly able to see what is at stake in Wittgenstein's puzzling linkage of the apprehension of a literary piece or work of art to "seeing" the expression that it embodies. In the gestural communication of that relation, one's own body becomes a signifier, but one that is not reducible to linguistic expression. Wittgenstein compares this to how one might come to see or "get" an expression, aligning seeing an expression with expressing a gesture: "I sing it with quite a particular expression." This expression is not something that can be separated from the passage. It is a different concept. (A different game).</page><page sequence="21">symplokê 93 The experience is this passage played like this, (that is, as I am doing it, for instance; a description could only hint at it). (Philosophical Investigations 183) If a theme, a phrase, suddenly means something to you, you don't have to be to explain it. Just this gesture has been made accessible to you. (Zettel #158) Aesthetic predicates may then be better expressed as gestural counterpoints in "a different game"; gestural equivalents to the "expression" of the work of art or literary piece that throw us back onto the exactness of the work's immediacy and our own relation to it. Gestures then become a particular category for aesthetic predicates because they can never detach themselves from the context of their practical employment, yet remain responsive to cultural pressure and social praxis without ever setting up residence as a universal language. Their meaning does not derive from that peculiar différance and distance from social reality that is characteristic for the depictive function of a sign, but rather, from its concrete role within that reality itself. Wittgenstein has not cured but mollified the pain of the sublime by making it subliminal - pushing it down into the less cognizant domain of gesture, and sometimes even parody. A certain wild bodily force still animates a gesture even though this force has already been bent into a meaningful shape. The corporeal energy of the gesture soaks up the excesses of signification, but it never entirely gives way to pure symbolism because the meaning of a gesture is not reducible to a fixed propositional content. Whereas a sentence expressing an aesthetic predicate always represents the same proposition irrespective of its calligraphic execution, a gesture can acquire a completely different meaning even by a minimal variation of its performance. Gestures can therefore surprise us again and again even if they are well known and well expected. And because gestures derive their communicative force from their connection to the body, their peculiarity locates them in a place on the borderline of the realm of signs where they shift in an area between wilderness and civilization. Perhaps gestures are, after all, an apt expression of Agnes Martin's "holiday state of mind" and the final domain of Beckett's project of the "relaxation of the subject's habit of thought and ... a generally diminished tension of consciousness."
