<plain_text><page sequence="1">JeI JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ISSUES Vol. XXX No. I March 1996 A New-Institutionalist Story about the Transformation of Former Socialist Economies: A Recounting and an Assessment Peter M. Lichtenstein Almost all of the former socialist countries are now undergoing revolutionary transformations from central planning to market economy. New-institutionalist eco- nomics (NIE) is one prominent school of thought that has attempted to explain why these transformations began, how they should be conducted, and where they should end up. NIE explanations and prescriptions are growing in popularity not only within mature capitalist nations, but also within the transforming nations them- selves. I define new-institutionalism as an amalgamation of (1) evolutionary theory, as originated by Alchian [1950] and Nelson and Winter [1982]; (2) the Austrian proc- ess-oriented theory of Hayek [1948]; (3) the property rights theory of Coase [1937]; (4) the transactions cost theory of Williamson [1979]; (5) the contract and organiza- tion theories of Alchian and Demsetz [1972] and Cheung [1983]; and (6) the eco- nomic theory of social institutions developed by North [19901.1 NIE's chief claim to scientific achievement is its treatment of social institutions as endogenous to the structures and forces elaborated by neoclassical theory. NIE economists, like "old institutional economists"2 [OIE], find neoclassical economics to be excessively narrow and mechanistic, to ignore the irreversibility of time, and to fail to account for the allocation of resources to such nonproductive activities as transacting and contracting. However, unlike OIE, NIE adopts the same individual- istic, rationalistic, and hedonistic methodology as neoclassical theory. The purpose of this paper is to articulate and to evaluate NIE explanations of, and prescriptions for, post-socialist transformations. My strategy is in two parts. The author is Professor of Economics, Boise State University. The author wishes to thank Bill Dugger, Chris Loucks, Larry Reynolds, and Edward Slattery for their helpful comments on earlier drafts of this paper. 243</page><page sequence="2">244 Peter M. Lichtenstein First, I assemble the disparate elements of NIE thought and integrate them into a co- herent general theory, or story, of post-socialist transformation. The telling of this story comprises the main part of the paper. Iforewarn the reader that I will tell this story uncritically as if I were an ardent MIE proponent (which I am not). I make no effort whatsoever to evaluate the tale as I relate it. I am metaphorically "trying the NIE shoes on for size." In the second section of the paper, I evaluate the NIE story and offer some gen- eral conclusions about its contribution to our understanding of post-socialist trans- formation. My conclusion is that, while NEI is a robust and logically consistent theory of post-socialist transformation, it is flawed by its reliance on the neoclassi- cal article of faith: that free choice, voluntary exchange, and natural selection will result in efficient, welfare maximizing, capitalist market institutions. It is true that NIE expands the scope of orthodox neoclassical investigation to include the histori- cal dynamics of institutions. Many view this expansion of scope as disciplinary pro- gress. I conclude, however, that NEI is less an extension of neoclassical theory to the study of social institutions than it is a reduction of social institutions to the nar- row confines that can be treated in a model of rational choice and methodological individualism. The NIE Story of Instituional Dynamics The Structure of Social Institutions A social institution is a set of rules that governs human behavior and shapes so- cial relations. Institutions are ". . . regularities in repetitive interactions among indi- viduals" [North 1990, 231]. These regularities stem from interactions in which actors find it to their advantage to agree to certain sets of long-term strategies and practices. These agreements, or institutions, emerge because of the uncertainty that otherwise surrounds repeated decision making. Bounded rationality and opportunism motivate agents to agree to the rules that shape social institutions. Some rules are formally codified, as in national laws, while others are informal, as in social customs, conventions, and codes of conduct. Institutional rules constrain individual choices by discouraging some kinds of actions and by explicitly sanction- ing or encouraging others. Property rights are also rules that define, with varying degrees of precision and enforcement, what people can and cannot do with society's resources. However, not all behavior falls into the domain of actions explicitly or implicitly constrained by institutional rules and property rights regimes. Varying de- grees of freedom exist for unconstrained decisions and actions. Society consists of constellations of interlocking institutions and their respective layers of formal and informal rules. Each constellation of institutions applies to and</page><page sequence="3">A New-Institutionalist Story about the Transformation 245 spans certain partitions of society. These partitions are arenas of human action. They include production, ruling and governance, household subsistence, and politi- cal activities. How these arenas of human action are defined and classified depends on the particular stage of social development, the degree of specialization, and the extent of the market. The market is an arena of human action characterized by voluntary exchange, is costly to use and in which market relations are circumscribed by formal and infor- mal rules. For exchanges that require actions to be taken over time, contracts can be written that warrant and insure reciprocal commitments. The market involves more than exchange of commodities; it also involves exchange of favors, promises, obli- gations, and the like. Thus, the market can also be used to describe human relation- ships in the political arena as well as in bureaucracies and organizations. Social arenas, or partitions, are comprised of goal-oriented organizations that structure human action subject to institutional constraints. Organizations exist to re- duce the uncertainties that would be faced by agents acting in isolation.3 Organiza- tions also serve to take advantage of the wealth-maximizing opportunities that are made available by and are circumscribed by constellations of institutions. The wealth generated by organizational activities will be distributed according to rules defined by these institutions. The organizations into which people are grouped are not anthropomorphic. Thus, it is incorrect to say that corporations, government bodies, unions, and politi- cal parties have their own collective objective functions and preference functions. Organizations are instead made up of individuals, each with their own objectives. The constrained interactions among individuals give rise to a temporary equilibrium that gives direction and purpose to the organization. These equilibria are either codi- fied into written contracts or informally accepted as binding. Organizations bind together utility-maximizing agents with networks of volun- tary contracts [Williamson 1979]. Individuals always have the opportunity to direct their resources and energies at changing the organization structure in which they are located, although the costs and benefits of doing so vary over time and space. For this reason, organizations and institutions are dynamic and always in a state of flux as individuals ceaselessly negotiate and renegotiate the terms of their agreements. Changes in the institutional matrix that result from these negotiations are time-irre- versible due to lock-in effects and path dependence.4 Culture may be viewed as a communications system that transfers, from one time period or generation to the next, social knowledge about institutions, their for- mal and informal rules and property rights regimes, and their constituent social or- ganizations. A culture may also be said to be a genetic code that is transmitted over time and space to successive generations.5 The instruments of culture include relig- ions, philosophies, ideologies, the arts, written constitutional codes, and the like.</page><page sequence="4">246 Peter M. Lichtenstein The classical centrally planned economy [CPE] is a culture in the broadest sense. The CPE culture transfers, over time and space, knowledge about a unique constellation of institutional rules, property rights regimes, and systems of govern- ance.6 The main social arenas, or partitions of a CPE culture, are (1) the Commu- nist party apparatus; (2) the state planning bureaucracy; (3) the managers and workers of state-owned enterprises; and (4) the general public. Each of these four partitions is made up of wealth-maximizing, opportunistic, rent-seeking individuals7 who maximize their utility or wealth subject to resource and institutional con- straints. Principals and agents of each partition interact with each other and make decisions that result in a certain allocation of resources, an allocation that may pro- mote or depress economic progress. Individuals operate within the given rules, yet they also strive to change those rules when it pays for them to do so. It is therefore the personal calculations of individuals, and the resulting interactions between choosing individuals, that will determine the evolutionary path that is followed by the CPE culture. Historical Dynamics: Incremental and Radical Changes in CPE Cultures As with any culture, the given CPE culture is not permanent. Incremental insti- tutional changes always occur because rational decision makers not only maximize wealth within the given rules, but they will also attempt to change the rules. Thus, people continuously recalculate costs and benefits, renegotiate contracts, respecify rules and property rights, and rearrange systems of governance. These recalcula- tions are usually in response to technological changes and exogenous disturbances that alter the relative prices of economic and political exchanges and that induce in- dividual entrepreneurs to believe that they can improve their well-being by doing things differently. New institutional formations will thus gradually emerge while old ones will disappear. The survival over time of a culture's constituent institutional elements will ultimately depend on whether these elements meet the demands of a changing social environment. Radical institutional changes also occur. Endogenous and exogenous events can shock the system, causing dramatic recalculations and renegotiations that lead to a radical institutional transformation. When such a radical change takes place, a com- pletely new path of development is followed. In China, for example, internal politi- cal events after the death of Mao in 1976 led to such a radical transformation. The new Chinese Communist Party leadership coalition, knowing that it had to "deliver the goods" in order to maintain its monopoly power, found it advantageous to initi- ate a sequence of rule changes that altered opportunity costs and greatly expanded the opportunity sets of decision makers. The result has been a new path of social and economic development [Gelb, Jefferson, and Singh 1993]. The Vietnamese Communist Party leadership coalition was similarly motivated after the failure of its</page><page sequence="5">A New-Institutionalist Story about the Transformation 247 collectivization policy in the south and after the Soviet Union withdrew its aid.8 In order to preserve its monopoly power, the party initiated radical reforms (doi mot) in 1987, which altered the opportunity sets of Vietnamese decision makers. While these Asian socialist countries managed to preserve their Communist par- ties, the East European and Soviet nations did not. Asian Communist party coali- tions were willing to make larger sacrifices to preserve their organizations than were the ruling European and Soviet party coalitions. The sacrifices took the form of greater political risks and diminished control over the social economy. If a radical transformation occurs, therefore, it is because individuals find it in their interest to undertake collective actions against the ruling coalition and against existing institutions. In other words, collective action "pays" despite free rider prob- lems and the high retaliatory and repressive costs of civil disobedience. The ruling coalition, aware of and threatened by the possibility of such collective actions and constrained by its own resource endowment, might promote a radical transformation of its own in order to preempt collective action and to preserve its power (e.g., per- estroika, "restructuring," "new economic mechanisms," "responsibility systems," "socialist commodity production," and doi mo). But even in the case of a radical transformation, the new path will never be to- tally new. Natura non facit saltum-Nature does not make great leaps. The "new so- ciety" will always contain many of the institutional elements that previously existed. This is especially true of informal institutions that pattern morality and ethical be- havior, individual attitudes toward risk, responsiveness to material incentives, and the like. As North observed, "how and why [institutions] change incrementally and why even discontinuous changes (such as revolution and conquest) are never com- pletely discontinuous are the result of imbeddedness of informal constraints in socie- ties" [1990, 6]. Strongly imbedded informal institutions take a much longer time to change than formal institutions. A radical transformation to a new path may or may not improve economic per- formance. It depends on the opportunities that are newly made available and on the subsequent sequence of choices that are made by individuals in the polity and in the economy. If new incentive structures, new behavioral constraints, new property rights regimes, and new systems of governance lead to lower transactions costs and an expanded scope for individual initiative, then innovative productive activity will increase, and society will follow what North [1990] calls an "adaptively efficient path of development." If the institutional changes induce people to pay too much at- tention to the redistribution of power and wealth, then the new path of development may reduce opportunities for wealth creation. This would be an "adaptively ineffi- cient path of development." The former case seems to describe the Asian transfor- mation, while the latter seems to describe the European and Soviet experience.9</page><page sequence="6">248 Peter M. Lichtenstein An NIE Story of the Degeneration of CPEs Characteristics of Communist Parties Communist parties are restricted membership, hierarchical organizations that pursue collective strategies that maximize wealth-creating opportunities for its mem- bers. Rank and file party members ("cadres," or "apparatchiks") are opportunistic agents for the party leadership principals. The leadership rules over the party bu- reaucracy, which rules over the government, which in turn commands the economy. The party principals are selected from within the party according to ad hoc rules. The rank and file are selected from the general population according to criteria es- tablished by the leadership. The selection process minimizes goal incongruence among members. The opportunity sets for individual party members (e.g., pecuniary benefits, housing privileges, queuing privileges) are significantly larger than for the general non-member population. These expanded opportunity sets are collective benefits that accrue differentially to all members. In exchange for these benefits, party agents work to fulfill the social, political, and economic goals set by higher levels. Their ability to fulfill these goals is determined by their personal accumulated human and non-human resources as well as by the party resources with which they must work. Their willingness to meet party goals is a function of the members' present value of expected life time benefits, ideological commitment and loyalty, and penalties of malfeasance. The costs of party membership (as opposed to the sunk costs of applying for membership) are negligible. For party members, the opportunities foregone due to membership are always less than the benefits received, and the members' share of total costs of party operations are negligible because these costs are paid from gen- eral tax revenues. These latter costs will include (1) the agency costs of monitoring and metering member-agent performance, enforcing party rules, and administering penalties; (2) the costs of preserving party domination over civil society, including police and military expenses;10 and (3) the costs of "administering" the government and its bureaus. Unlike the collective organizations of Olson [1971], it is always ra- tional for rent-seeking, wealth-maximizing Communist party members to be loyal to the party and its activities and goals, even though party membership is absolutely large but relatively (to the population) small. Party member behavior is constrained by party institutions (formal and informal rules, norms, codes, conventions, loyalties). Nevertheless, considerable scope re- mains within these rules for internal factions to form, each with competing utility functions. These factions compete for control over the policy-making machinery, and the power that any group has depends on the resource endowments available to</page><page sequence="7">A New-Institutionalist Story about the Transformation 249 them and to their competitors. The Communist party is therefore a political market- place in which an unstable equilibrium is normally attained. The dynamics of party organizations can be understood as a series of continuous games played between interest groups with changing memberships. The outcome of these internal party struggles, or games, is incremental and evolutionary social change. Thus, Communist parties have always been in a continuous state of flux, with alternating episodes of glory and infamy, collective and unitary leadership, and reform and retrenchment. Their ability to maintain their monopoly position in the political marketplace has depended on their capacity to: (1) function efficiently as an organization; (2) continue to provide expanded opportunities for members; (3) pro- vide real or imagined economic progress for the whole population; and (4) neutral- ize anti-government actions by party and non-party civilians who have different mental models of how the existing system functions. This understanding of the Communist party as a marketplace provides a mecha- nism for understanding the transformations that have been taking place in the former socialist countries. In China, for example, there was sufficient scope within the Communist party for the emergence of two dominant coalitions: a reform coalition and a conservative coalition. The rise to power of the former coalition was the im- mediate consequence of their members' willingness to trade off the political risk of losing power by failing to "deliver the goods," with the political risk of departing from the "socialist road" and so losing power to the conservative purists. The re- form faction, lead by Deng Xiaoping, was able to insure itself against the latter risk by redefining socialism. This lowered the cost of choosing a set of reform policies that eventually transformed China's development path and resulted in the degenera- tion of central planning in that country. Monopoly Power and Encompassing Interests A recent study by Murrell and Olson shows that the European and Soviet econo- mies "did about as well at exploiting their opportunities for growth from 1950 to 1965 as did market economies" [1991, 250]. Yet, from 1965 to the 1980s, these economies slowed down substantially and fell behind the market economies in terms of "exploiting opportunities for growth." In a manner consistent with the NIE evolu- tionary perspective, Murrell and Olson explain that radical transformations are not instantaneous events. They are instead the resolution of forces that evolve over long periods of time. In the earlier period, the CPE economies were dominated by Com- munist parties with dictatorial powers. Stalin's rule is a case in point. Stalin had an "encompassing interest" in the productive development of the Soviet economy. He had a virtual property right in the Soviet ecowmy, and he calculated that his own power and prestige were direct functions of economic growth. Stalin's complete monopoly of power allowed him to maintain high savings and investment rates in</page><page sequence="8">250 Peter M. Lichtenstein order to maintain high growth rates. Similar stories could be told about other Com- munist leaders such as Mao, Deng, and Castro. The organization of productive enterprises can be accomplished quickly. Yet, according to Murrell and Olson, the organization of coalitions seeking to alter the existing distribution of power and wealth take a much longer time to evolve, due to the difficulties of organizing collective action as outlined by Olson [1971]. Gradu- ally, these coalitions will emerge to challenge the ruling elite, and the latter's en- compassing interest will diminish. The CPE then becomes a mixture of competing coalitions, each seeking to expand their members wealth and power through rent- seeking behavior. Included among tiese coalitions and interest groups are the mili- tary, large state-owned enterprises, foreign trade corporations, regional interests, and trade unions. 1 1 In this way, the encompassing interest of Stalin gradually eroded in the face of emerging redistributive coalitions. The immediate result of the devolution of encompassing interests is the decline in innovation and productive efficiency. Collusion and collective action among and between these groups in CPE's are not obvious; they are informal and inconspicu- ous and often take the form of corruption, information distortions, nepotism, and the like. These resource-using activities inevitably lead to economic stagnation. The Market for Liberty Why have some Communist governments fallen and others have not? Why have the Chinese and Vietnamese Communist Parties remained in power, while the East- ern European and Soviet parties have lost power? And why have those governments that have not fallen still introduced such wide-ranging and radical institutional changes? One way to answer these questions is to view liberty, or the absence of monop- oly power, as a commodity that some people wish to purchase and other people are willing to sell in the political marketplace. 12 We can view a radical transformation of a system as the result of either actual or potential sequential collective actions taken by large numbers of citizens against the ruling Communist party.13 We will assume for convenience that the state planning and managerial bureaucracies remain neutral. 14 The aim of anti-government action is increased liberty, or reduced penal- ties for disallowed or suppressed private entrepreneurial activities. Liberty is thus a diminution of suppression. It is an expansion in the range of unconstrained action, and hence increases in liberty lower the costs of free expression and free action (in terms of reprisal and punishment) for all citizens, activists and free riders alike. 15 Liberty is a collective benefit that accrues to everyone but is purchased by activ- ists and sold by the party. The quantity of liberty actually exchanged will determine whether the radical transformation is partial or general. A partial transformation is one in which everything is transformed except the political system (the Asian</page><page sequence="9">A New-Institutionalist Story about the Transformation 251 model) while a general transformation is one in which the political system changes as well (the Eastern European model). The amount of liberty exchanged depends on the cost-benefit calculations of individual anti-government activists as well as of in- dividual Communist party members. The Communist party leadership will sell successive units of liberty so long as the marginal benefits outweigh the marginal costs. The marginal benefits consist of the expected discounted value of reduced threats to members' lifetime earnings, avoidance of anti-Communist sentiment and retaliation for past repression against citizens, and savings from diminished expenditures of resources on repression (mili- tary, police, and punishment). The marginal costs include the discounted value of lost wealth opportunities and diminished rent-seeking possibilities, the cost of hav- ing to learn new skills,16 and the personal hardships of role renegotiation in a new party environment. How these costs and benefits are evaluated will depend on the party leadership's rate of time discount, the subjective probability of civil disobedi- ence given the party's strategy, attitudes toward risk, party members' utility func- tions, and subjective models of the post-transformation system held by party decision makers. The amount of liberty demanded by activists will depend on a similar calculus. The activists will demand liberty (i.e., continue to participate in civil disobedience and other pressuring tactics) so long as the expected benefits of their actions exceed the marginal costs. The marginal benefits of increased liberty include expanded choice sets and wealth-maximizing opportunities. Marginal costs include time spent on anti-government action and expected punishments. It also includes sizable search costs because information is asymmetrically distributed between the party and the non-party public. The choice will also be influenced by the activists' rate of time discount, attitudes toward risk, subjective probabilities attached to the consequences of collective actions, individual utility functions, and subjective models of the post- transformation society held by activists and their followers. Importantly, the success of collective action will depend on the ideological commitment of activists and the propensity of people to "ride for free. " If the party's supply of liberty exceeds the activists' demand, then evolutionary change will be in the direction of a partial transformation (change from above). This is the Asian model. If the demand for liberty exceeds the supply, then either the party elite will increase the quantity of liberty supplied or a general transformation from below will occur. This is the European model. If supply equals demand, the status quo will be maintained. Planners and Managers: The Logical Impossibility of Planning The economic problems faced by the East European and Soviet economies in the 1980s, and by the Chinese economy in the 1970s, are well known.17 There is a core</page><page sequence="10">252 Peter M. Lichtenstein set of theoretical explanations for these problems, with roots in the work of von Mises who argued against the possibility of central planning. Von Mises reasoned that it was impossible for central planners to make the economic calculations that were necessary to "get the prices right." More recent work has extended this rea- soning by employing advances made in the economics of information, team theory and the "new" theories of the firm, the "new" economic history, public choice the- ory, and legal economics (contract and property rights economics in particular). Not only do these recent advances point to the logical impossibility of economic calcula- tion in a centrally planned economy, thereby supporting the position taken by von Mises, but they also point to the impossibility of "getting the institutions right" [Winiecki 1994]. To understand the logical impossibility of central planning, we must bring into focus the role played by state enterprise managers in the planning system. We as- sumed earlier that state managers were neutral players in the dynamics of regime change. Indeed, experience shows that no clear general statements can be made about their loyalties in an economic transformation.18 Nevertheless, the role played by state managers in CPEs is crucial in understanding why CPEs have failed and why the political struggles over reform and transformation have occurred in the first place. The main criticism of centrally planned economies is that they are inherently X- inefficient. The organizational logic of the CPE itself is flawed and leads to eco- nomic activities that are misdirected and grossly suboptimal. The CPE is not an irrational system, however. Decision makers within the CPE make perfectly rational welfare-maximizing decisions. It is the institutional rules of the CPE game that make the outcomes of individual decision making suboptimal. The CPE organizational culture is hierarchical, bureaucratic, and partitioned into sectors that are administered by ministries and governed by a central planning agency. The institutional rules of that culture define how annual plans are con- structed, how state-owned enterprises are to produce for the plan, how goal fulfill- ment is to be measured, how output and income are to be distributed between consumption and investment and among income categories, and the rewards and penalties that accrue to managers. The property rights regime specifies what people can and cannot do with publicly owned productive resources. Within this CPE culture, a primary relationship is the one between the central planner and the enterprise manager.19 We assume that "the planner" represents the entire planning bureaucracy and that "the manager" likewise represents all state managers. Whatever uniformity of outlook exists among planners and managers is assumed to be arrived at through within-group negotiations and rent-seeking, oppor- tunistic, wealth-maximizing behavior. Thus, the planner's position, as well as the manager's position, is an equilibrium of sorts that is arrived at in the political mar-</page><page sequence="11">A New-Institutionalist Story about the Transformation 253 ketplace. We make this assumption in order to avoid giving groups of people an- thropomorphic lives of their own. The planner is described by a personal utility function that incorporates personal wealth, prestige, and power. The planner endeavors to maximize this utility func- tion subject to a constraint that includes the fulfillment of Communist party objec- tives. As Moore [1981, 193] observes, "These objectives are sought in the context of a set of constraints determined in part by the ideology, culture, tradition, politics, and other characteristics of Soviet society that differentiate it from other societies." The manager is also described by a utility function with similar arguments of wealth, prestige, and power. However, both planner and manager have different at- titudes toward risk, different constraints, and different time horizons. The planner is the principal and the manager is the agent. The welfare of the planner qua principal depends on the intertemporal actions taken by the manager qua agent. But how does the planner get the manager to meet the annual plan objectives in a way that maximizes the planner's utility function and not the manager's utility function? This is a standard principal-agent problem. Both parties have different utility functions, both are opportunistic and rational, and the principal can neither observe nor verify the agent's activities. Knowledge about local productive conditions is owned exclusively by the agent (i.e., asymmet- rical information). The agent takes actions based on information that the principal does not know, so the latter cannot be sure if the agent has made the best choices.20 Moreover, there exists no simple relationship between the manager's work effort and enterprise results: the successes and failures of enterprise activity cannot be as- signed directly to the individual managers, but rather to the enterprise "team" as a whole. In fact, responsibility might even lie with the industry or the ministry itself. In the absence of these informational and goal congruence problems, the deci- sions made by the agent would maximize the principal's welfare. The difference be- tween this "optimal" level of welfare, and the welfare actually achieved by the principal, is a welfare loss. The principal can reduce this welfare loss by expending resources to find out and control what the agent is doing.21 These expenditures con- sist of the costs of monitoring, metering, bonding and enforcement. Rational princi- pals will expend resources to minimize welfare losses so long as the marginal benefits exceed the marginal costs. Because these costs are positive, there will al- ways remain a residual welfare loss. The agency costs of a CPE will therefore be the sum of resources expended on monitoring, metering, bonding and enforcement plus the residual welfare loss that remains when expenditures and benefits are equal- ized at the margin.22 While all economies have agency costs, CPEs are particularly X-inefficient be- cause they are unable to create appropriate incentive systems and optimal contracts. The CPE property rights regime specifies that resources are owned by the state and managers have no residual property rights. Hence, the rules for settling enterprise</page><page sequence="12">254 Peter M. Lichtenstein accounts require taxation of residual incomes and subsidization of enterprise losses. This is the familiar soft budget constraint described by Kornai [1992]. The soft budget constraint is a form of insurance in which the planner perfectly insures the manager against poor enterprise performance. This insurance leads in turn to moral hazard because the manager has no incentive to husband the resources under his or her command.23 Unlike capitalist market economies, explicit and tacit contracts can- not be written between planners and managers that would guarantee future perform- ance and so minimize welfare losses. The institutional rules of a CPE also require the use of quantitative output meas- ures instead of market prices. The enormous complexity of planning an advanced in- dustrial system precludes the possibility of developing and using measures that could grade and calibrate all of the characteristics of the products produced under the plan. This gives rise to adverse selection. Manager-agents possess asymmetric in- formation about the true quality of the goods they produce. With planned prices fixed and unchanging, virtually unlimited opportunities exist for managers to pro- duce low-quality output. The institutional rules governing the assignment of values to commodities pro- hibit the use of the price system as an information system. Because markets for capital and for management are forbidden under the rules of the game, planners are kept in the dark about the performance of their agents. This exacerbates informa- tional difficulties and increases agency costs. The property rights regimes of CPE's therefore make it impossible to "get the institutions right." The CPE property rights regime constrains contracting so that in- formational problems become exaggerated. Agency costs cannot be minimized, and the resulting incentives structures become dysfunctional. The Demise of the CPE The degeneration of the CPE occurs because its social and economic institutions become inefficient and dysfunctional. The decline begins to occur with the demise of the encompassing interests that characterized the CPE in its early years. Increas- ing goal incongruencies arise within the Communist party, central powers becomes dispersed, and opportunities expand for competing factions to challenge the ruling faction. A political marketplace emerges within the CPE. The relative prices used by party members, planners, and managers in making personal calculations change over time, leading to fluctuations in the distribution of power. A continuous process of resource-using negotiations and renegotiations becomes necessary to construct and carry out plans and to preserve monopoly power. Resources are also increas- ingly allocated to other non-productive activities, especially those connected with the distribution of wealth.</page><page sequence="13">A New-Institutionalist Story about the Transformation 255 The result of these developments is an erosion of the production and consump- tion opportunities of the general population. Eventually, the ability to sustain a sta- ble long-term equilibrium is undermined. The system gradually "liberalizes" because the individuals belonging to the various dominant groups feel that it is in their benefit to promote change rather than to avoid it. The process of post-socialist transformation begins. An NIE Story of Optimal Transition Policy Analyzing the transformation of a CPE into a market economy requires that we specify both the speed of institutional change and the sequence in which specific changes are implemented. The last decade has witnessed a profusion of opinions on these two aspects of the problem. There have been Big Bang, Minimum Bang, and gradualist theories of speed and an even larger number of ideas about the proper se- quence in which institutional reforms should take place. New-institutionalist theory leads to a unique set of ideas concerning speed and sequence. Speed. The transformation of CPEs entails both the destruction of old institu- tions and the construction of new institutions. It therefore involves the elimination of old rules of the game and old property rights structures, and the introduction of new ones. More than this, a social transformation consists of the total redesign of the system of institutional selection that decides which rules and patterns of behavior will govern organizations and which ones will not. In short, a transformation is an evolutionary process that necessarily takes place over a rather long period of time.24 While formal institutions can change rapidly, informal institutions and long-standing behaviors and customs change very slowly. As noted above, natura non facit sal- tum. Viewed in the light of normative economics, the speed of transformation ought to be gradual and not abrupt. As Murrell says: . . . whereas in the long run a market system might be the productive eco- nomic environment, in the short run, when routines and expectations are still adapted to the bureaucratic environment of central planning, a swift change- over to the market could be very destructive of the capacity of the existing enterprises to produce output [1992, 42]. New efficient institutions must be allowed to emerge gradually and spontane- ously in response to new policy measures and new opportunities. In this way the J- curve of total output observed in Eastern and Central Europe can be minimized.25 Sequence. A successful transformation should proceed in three stages. In the first stage, the focus is entirely on macroeconomic stability. The initial economic conditions of post-socialist transformations typically have been monetary overhang (i.e., excess monetary balances relative to the supply of commodities available for</page><page sequence="14">256 Peter M. Lichtenstein sale), inflation, and enormous government debt. These conditions must be elimi- nated before anything else is attempted. Macroeconomic stability is achieved by monetary and fiscal policies. The state bank must be revamped and converted into a dual banking system made up of a cen- tral bank and (at first, state-owned) commercial banks. As the private sector begins to evolve, the central bank will need to begin to take an active, rather than a pas- sive, role in credit allocation using real interest rates and commercial bank reserve requirements. Commercial banks in turn will need to be governed by hard budget constraints, and bankers must be given incentives to ration credit according to the expected performance of borrowers. At the same time, the central bank will need to continue to regulate state-owned enterprises in the customary, bureaucratic way. Fiscal policies will also require modification. Debt reduction in the absence of financial markets can only be accomplished via taxation and spending. New tax laws and tax collection institutions need to be devised in order to avoid the loss of reve- nues that normally accompany transformation. Those losses occur as state enter- prises are decentralized, privatized, or eliminated. Fiscal expenditures also need to be reduced by curtailing state subsidies. As with monetary policy, fiscal policy will need to be divided into those measures taken to regulate the traditional state-owned enterprise sector and those taken to regulate the emerging private sector. Once macroeconomic stability is achieved, the second stage can then begin. This stage consists of changes in legal institutions that will facilitate the formation of new privately owned businesses. Property rights laws and privatization rules need to be created that will define how assets can be used, who is entitled to income streams and residual property rights, when and how assets can be transferred, and how as- sets can be retired or destroyed. Laws of corporation also need to be devised as well as commercial laws and laws of fair competition. These laws will enable new private business formation and hence establish the rules of entry into markets. They will also redefine state-owned enterprises as decentralized, autonomous entities. Thus, both state-owned and col- lective enterprises will coexist with private businesses and joint state-private ven- tures, and natural selection will determine which of these organizational forms will survive in the evolving environment. Three additional sets of legal reforms are necessary. The first is a set of bank- ruptcy laws that will harden budget constraints and that will be applied to all enter- prises. These laws in effect establish the rules of exit. The second is a set of contract laws that will enable voluntary contracting and minimize the tradeoff be- tween ex ante and ex post transactions costs [Yang and Wills 1990]. The third is a criminal law that will enforce all of the above legal codes. The third stage is the longest and most arduous. It consists of full price liberali- zation, marketization of human, natural and capital resources, foreign trade liberali- zation, and the establishment of all those state bureaus needed to continue the</page><page sequence="15">A New-Institutionalist Story about the Transformation 257 transformation along its path. One cannot be more specific about this stage because the changes that will occur will be adaptive and emerge spontaneously. The duration of this stage will most likely last for several generations. Figure 1 summarizes the sequence of reforms needed to conduct a successful transformation. Will all of these steps toward a market economy be eventually taken? Once again, it depends on the choices made by the actors involved and on the prices that they face in making their decisions. There is little doubt (in NIE) that individuals will always choose those actions that maximize their wealth-making opportunities. There is also little doubt (in NIE) that a free market society will provide a superior environment in which individuals can efficiently pursue these wealth-making oppor- tunities. Therefore, the answer to the above question is yes, the direction of evolu- tion points to a free market economy. Evaluation of the New-Institutionalist Story Some Specific Criticisms The new-institutionalist story about the post-socialist transformation has many possible variations, and perhaps, in the account just given, too wide a net has been cast over a large body of literature. Nonetheless, the story I have told is rhetorically and theoretically consistent with the mainstream of new-institutionalism. But is the story any good? On the positive side, NIE can be congratulated for paying attention to issues that have been central to heterodox economics for more than a century. By pushing the narrow boundaries of neoclassical economics outward, NIE has brought the ortho- Figure 1.

Lichtenstein doxy into the realm of social and political economy. All social institutions now fall into the purview of economic analysis. This affords enhanced opportunities for dia- log and debate. NIE has also forced the neoclassical orthodoxy to pay attention to history, to the evolution of institutions, and to the causal factors of social change. NIE rejects formalistic models of general equilibrium; it redefines the latter to mean a general balance of social forces, an intuitive description of the momentary institu- tional state of affairs. Finally, NIE has directly challenged the mechanistic, Newto- nian, clockwork vision of neoclassical economics. Social evolution is accepted by NIE as a time-irreversible process, and this is an important and refreshing change in orthodox thinking. Despite these advances, NIE is still an elaboration of neoclassical analysis. While the subject matter has now been broadened to include social institutions, and while an advance has been made beyond mechanistic modeling, most of the criti- cisms of neoclassical economics rendered by heterodox economists continue to ap- ply to NIE and its story of post-socialist transformation. Because it would be futile to consider all of these criticisms, I will focus on a few that are uniquely applicable to the subject of post-socialist transformation. My first criticism is that the NIE story is teleological. The evolutionary arrow points to the inevitable dissolution of CPE societies and the eventual evolutionary unfolding of a free market capitalist social economy. NIE models of social change are predicated on the concept of institutional efficiency. In most versions of this concept, societies with efficient institutions encourage innovation and the acquisition of knowledge, risk taking, creativity, and entrepreneurship. They are characterized by free markets, decentralized decision making, competition, property rights, and bankruptcy laws [North 1990, 80-9 1]. The economic selection process will weed out inefficient organizations, and resources will be allocated to productive and not redis- tributive activities. The result will be rapid growth of material welfare. This de- scription of adaptively efficient economies sounds all too familiar: it is in fact the very idealized picture of Western capitalism itself. This culturally determined definition of efficiency is, in NIE, the goal of all so- cial evolution. Social change is inwardly directed toward this imminent goal by the singular principles of egoism and rational choice. Now, it is true that inefficient in- stitutions can persist due to path dependence and technological irreversibilities. In economies with such inefficient, poorly performing institutions, decision makers de- vote too many resources to unproductive, redistributive activities. This results from inappropriate incentives, which to North [1990] are the root determinants of eco- nomic performance. Yet, in the long run, the evolutionary path of these inefficient countries (e.g., Third and Fourth World nations and CPEs) still leads toward adap- tive efficiency due to the existence of efficient, high-performing institutional role models (e.g., the Western capitalist countries) and the availability of "low-cost in- formation" about these models. Presumably, therefore, support from those who are</page><page sequence="17">A New-Institutionalist Story about the Transformation 259 blessed to those who are not, together with financial, technical, and educational as- sistance, can nudge the process along more rapidly. The gradual evolution toward more efficient (read: capitalist) institutional forms is therefore inevitable as ineffi- cient institutions are weeded out. North is thus able to conclude that "the overall di- rection in the long run is both more predictable and more difficult to reverse" [1990, 104]. This teleological path of development is made more certain when we add the tautology of rational choice, the inevitable breakdown of encompassing interests, and the essentialist26 postulates of the impossibility of central planning. I consider each of these in turn. NIE claims that social institutions change as a result of continuous interpersonal negotiations and renegotiations in which rent-seeking agents seek to maximize their personal welfare. Continuous calculations and recalculations of costs and benefits by agents lead them to periodically demand, and obtain, changes in the institutions of society. In NIE, rational decision makers will eventually choose capitalist market in- stitutions and reject CPE institutions because the former are efficient and provide greater scope for agents to maximize their welfare. Hence, if change takes place, it must be because it is rational; if change is rational, it will ultimately take place. In its initial state, the CPE succeeds only because of the unchallenged encom- passing interests of the leadership. However, in NE, this initial state is unstable and cannot last. In an effort to capture more wealth and power, competitive coalitions are bound to emerge. The inevitable formation of these coalitions undermines the ability of the leadership to continue to deliver the economic progress upon which its continued power depends. While this disintegration has indeed occurred in former CPEs, the inevitability of this result is not (and cannot be) proven. Finally, the end result of social evolution is ensured because of the alleged im- possibility of planning as argued in the von Mises-Winiecki literature. Due to prin- cipal agent problems, the absence of residual property rights, moral hazard, adverse selection, and the like, CPEs cannot "get the institutions right" and are hence inher- ently dysfunctional. NIE has so structured the reality of centrally planned societies that the conclusions-the demise of the CPE and the rise of market capitalism-follow inevitably from the assumed premises-the inevitable formation of opposing coali- tions and the logical impossibility of planning. The NIE story of post-socialist transformation is thus teleological, tautological, and based on assumptions that pass as conclusions. A teleological model with inevi- table outcomes is not evolutionary. In a true evolutionary model, outcomes cannot be predicted, ex ante, from rational decisions that are made today, nor can they be logically deduced, even if we have full knowledge of the circumstances in which agents find themselves. The winners of the natural selection process-efficient insti- tutions with the aforementioned attributes-cannot be identified ahead of time unless</page><page sequence="18">260 Peter M. Lichtenstein we graft onto the evolutionary model a conclusion determined by some deus ex machina. Harmony or disharmony, social stability or instability, economic efficiency or inefficiency, equality or inequality, socialism or capitalism (or some other yet to be developed system) can each be the result of institution-altering decisions that are made today. No matter the prevailing institutional architecture, the future is in fact indeterminate, or "over-determined" to use the language of mathematics. This inde- terminacy is a main premise of classical institutionalism27 and distinguishes it from new-institutionalism. A teleological theory based on tautologies, a theory in which the ultimate outcome is preordained, is of limited use. Some Final Conclusions The NIE story leans in the direction of what Petr [1990] calls an ideological ap- proach to the design of reform policies. Ideological approaches are, according to Petr, "doctrinally grounded, ceremonially constrained, and results defiant." NIE is innocent of the second charge of ceremonialism because it does courageously enter new territory. However, NIE is indeed results defiant because of the tautological character of its rational choice methodology (i.e., results always follow premises) and is doctrinally grounded in its faith in market institutions. The faith upon which NIE ultimately rests is apparent in the way in which power is analyzed. Contrary to Dugger [1990], power is very much part of the NIE story. For new-institutionalist economics, power is achieved through collective action and by the investment of resources in building alliances with the aim of altering or cir- cumventing the rules of the game. Power is achieved when individuals can extract a monopoly profit from their activities (political or economic) and can redistribute wealth and opportunities in a way that benefits themselves at the expense of society. Power is maintained by raising the costs of competitive challenges. All this has been true of Communist parties in CPEs. But in NIE it is a "natural," Machiavellian fea- ture of human behavior that can only be mitigated and regulated by the free market and by competition. The faith lies in the unproved belief that coercion will be ab- sent, or at least mitigated, rather than exacerbated, in a market system. Market sys- tems function very well to reproduce whatever social relations happen to exist. Market institutions would therefore effectively reproduce coercive social relations if these existed prior to a transformation. In this respect, the market ought to be viewed with a healthy suspicion. The doctrinal faith of NIE is naive. Dugger [1990] rightfully accuses NIE of failure to be skeptical of capitalist institutions. In this way, says Dugger, new-insti- tutionalism is not very institutionalist at all. If NIE is insufficiently skeptical of its own market culture, then it will be insufficiently skeptical of the direction that post- socialist transformations have taken and of the directions which NIE promotes. NIE</page><page sequence="19">A New-Institutionalist Story about the Transformation 261 tries to show that since Western European and American economic success is attrib- utable to market capitalist institutions, then these same institutions will also deliver success to former CPEs. This is a non sequitur. It does not follow that it is the absence of Western market institutions that ac- counts for the failures of CPEs. There are uniquely Chinese, Vietnamese, Slavic, and Russian reasons for these failures, and there must also be uniquely Chinese, Vi- etnamese, Slavic, and Russian transition policies that are rooted in what Neale [1991, 473] calls the "processes laid down in detailed rules supported by folkviews that reflect the values that have emerged from national experiences." NIE shuts the door completely to any form of society that is based on social planning. Orthodox neoclassical economics always held the door open to the possibility that some com- bination of markets and planning is feasible. The NIE approach treats socialism as impossible over a longer run. The NIE world is hostile to the allocation of resources to activities that redistribute wealth. NIE discounts entirely distribution activities as being counter-productive. Steps taken to increase equality diminish productivity. As North observed: "The evidence we have with respect to ideologies, altruism, and self-imposed standards of conduct suggests that the trade-off between wealth and these other values is a negatively sloped function" [1990, 22]. But such redistributive activities might be essential in order to achieve a sense of community that a market economy cannot alone achieve. In fact, equality might be essential to increase wealth. However, NIE has cast such ethical concerns to the dustbin of history, along with the CPEs. In summary, the new-institutionalist story begins with the explicit articulation of an approach that consists of methodological individualism, rational choice, and op- portunism. NIE uses that methodology to examine the logic and performance of cen- trally planned economies. That analysis, in turn, leads to a set of transformation policies that would, according to NIE, lead not to a static end state, but rather to an evolutionary social process of system change. That process, according to NE, would expand individual wealth-maximizing opportunities over time and would cre- ate a social environment that screens out inappropriate institutions and selects the "right" institutions. Voluntary exchange and bargaining, with contracts enforced by the state, would ensure that only the "fittest" (i.e., the correct) institutions will sur- vive. It is true that the NIE story makes explicit what the orthodox neoclassical school has always kept implicit, namely, the institutional structures of economies. Many view this as a scientific advance. However, NIE reduces these institutions to the narrow boundaries of rational choice and opportunism. It reduces cultural phenom- ena to individual choice phenomena and in so doing conceals more than it illumi- nates. The NIE story is ultimately based on faith, the faith that free choice, voluntary exchange and bargaining, and evolutionary natural selection will result in efficient</page><page sequence="20">262 Peter M. Lichtenstein institutions that maximize welfare. In the final analysis, the message delivered by NIE to post-socialist societies is "become more like what we imagine ourselves to be. " Notes 1. Many others have contributed to the development of NIE, but their contributions are too numerous to mention here. See Eggertsson [1990] and Langlois [1986] for useful reviews of new-institutionalism. 2. I use the term "old institutionalism" here because this is the label applied by NIE. Most NIE authors believe that the institutionalism of Veblen, Commons, Ayres, et al. is a failed enterprise that is now defunct. Coase remarked that OIE "led to nothing. Without a the- ory, they had nothing to pass on except a mass of descriptive material waiting for a the- ory" [quoted in Williamson 1985, 187]. Coase [1984, 2291 adds elsewhere: "American Institutionalism is a dreary subject and I don't intend to dwell on it." Williamson [1985, 229] also paraphrases Stigler as saying that OIE "failed because it had no positive doc- trines. It led to nothing." North [1986, 235] believes that OIE "died for lack of a theoreti- cal focus." 3. The reason for the existence of organizations is outlined by, among others, Coase [1937], Williamson [1975], Barzel [1982], and North [1990]. 4. See Arthur [1988] on self-reinforcing mechanisms and path dependency. 5. For examples of other biological metaphors in economics, see Alchian [1950] and Nelson and Winter [1982]. 6. The design of a CPE is well known and will not be described in this paper; see Ellman [ 1 989] and Kornai [ 1992]. 7. Rent-seeking is defined by Eggertsson [1990, 279] as "attempts by individuals to increase their personal wealth while at the same time making a negative contribution to the net wealth of their community." Tullock [1991] defines rent-seeking as attempts to intervene in the marketplace in order to capture monopoly profits. 8. See Than and Tan [1993] and Williams [1992]. For a study of Vietnamese policies in the post-unification era, see Beresford [1989], Marr and White [1988], and Fforde [1989]. 9. Perhaps the inefficient path in Eastern and Central Europe is merely the downward seg- ment of the J-effect. 10. Alternatively, the Communist party as a whole can be viewed as an interest group that preserves its monopoly position by raising the costs of a challenge by competing interest groups. 11. See Brada [1991] and Nagy [1991] for analyses of the competition between these groups and the struggle over wealth and power. 12. An alternative approach is Schnytzer [1994]. 13. Note that anti-party opposition is relevant even in the partial top-down type of transforma- tion. In China, for example, the Tiananmen Square uprising in 1989 was only one in a se- ries of anti-government demonstrations over a 12-year period. The possibility that these demonstrations might continue was quite real despite the repressive reaction of the party. See Lichtenstein [1991, chap. 1]. 14. The position of non-party member state managers is uncertain. Some see their interests ly- ing with the party and the preservation of the status quo, while other managers see their interests lying with the activists and a new regime. Much depends on the managers' age, the types of industries in which they work, and their mental models of a post-CPE society. The same might be said of the planning bureaucracy. Some planners might view a trans-</page><page sequence="21">A New-Institutionalist Story about the Transformation 263 formation as an expansion of their opportunity sets, depending on their position and con- nections. 15. A useful survey of different views on liberty is Ryan [19891. 16. Zhao Ziyang's proposed plan to "professionalize" the Communist party in the late 1980s threatened the peace of mind of many party members. 17. General studies of the economic decline of socialist economies include Bergson [1989 and 1991], Desai [ 1987, 1989], Gregory and Stuart [1990], Kornai [1992], Prybyla [1990], and Riskin [19871. 18. See note 9 above. 19. We now assume perfect goal congruence between the Communist party and the central planning agency. 20. A notorious example of asymmetric information comes from the Great Leap Forward in China during which time local cadres knew the actual production statistics and the central planners did not. The local cadres were able to exploit this informational asymmetry for their own advantage and to the great detriment of the Chinese people. 21. This is called "hidden action" in the principal-agent literature. See Arrow [1964]. 22. Moore [1981] argues that agency costs cannot even be calculated in CPEs because there is no clear-cut measure of an "optimal plan." This is due to the fact that plan objectives are themselves ad hoc and continually changing (even during the planning period). The goals are also as much ideologically as economically determined, leading to unclear criteria for judging optimal performance. 23. Moral hazard exists when an individual maximizes his or her own welfare at the expense of another person with whom an intertemporal contract has been made. The contract is said to be incomplete in the sense that all future states of nature are not fully accounted for by the contract, leaving opportunities for rent-seeking behavior. Incomplete contracts oc- cur when the following exist: (1) risk aversion and asymmetrical information coexist; (2) joint production; and (3) contract costs (enforcement) and legal barriers. See Kotowitz [1989] and Stiglitz [1989]. 24. Evolutionary theories are employed by Nelson and Winter [1982], North [1990], and Mur- rell [1992]. 25. The J-curve describes the economic crisis that follows immediately after economic reforms are enacted. It should not be confused with the J-effect in international trade theory. The crisis is (optimistically) followed by recovery and long-term growth. 26. My use of the term "essentialist" is derived from Wolff and Resnick [1987, 15], who ob- serve that neoclassical economists "reduce the explanation of events in the world to a few essential causes." 27. I depart here from the use of "old institutionalism" to describe the Veblen-Ayres-Polanyi- Commons tradition, a term that is also employed by NIE. See footnote 2 above. The term "classical" is more dignified and avoids any suggestion that this tradition is obsolete. I also avoid using "American institutionalism" because the new-institutionalists are also pre- dominantly American and many non-Americans are joining the classical institutionalist ranks.
