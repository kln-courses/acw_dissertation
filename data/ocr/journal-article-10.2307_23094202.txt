<plain_text><page sequence="1">CAROLA GIEDION-WELCKER* (Translated from the German by Ernst Scheyer) Max Ernst: Irony —Myth—-Structure The oeuvre of Max Ernst exists and continues to unfold as a definitely individual achievement. It does so outside of or, better, beyond all "isms," manifestos, artist groups, which have long fulfilled their function as protests or signs of new artistic methods. If we glance back on what is essential in Max Ernst the artist, we find first his unwavering and prophetic rejection of "material reality," which once seemed so permanently secure, but which has become increasingly questionable in our day. Second, we find his continuously adventurous journeys through the realm of the psyche. Like a magician he has constantly searched for testimonials and images, rites and symbols, putting into visual questions those mysterious forces, those daemonic tensions within our conative drives, as well as the hovering world of our deepest dreams. 1 o him anxiety and aggressiveness emerge as stigmata of the modern psyche; yet there is the radiant revelation of Nature (as a field for the exploration of the "miracle par excellence"), which lies bare and is penetrated in her most minute and microscopic structures. All boundaries are gone; everything exists only in permanent metamor phosis: plant, stone, man, animals, as well as the world of dead things which still remain alive for Ernst. If Max Ernst could ever change into an animal, he would certainly emerge as a bird—possibly a bird of dream and prey—with a char acteristic sharp, hooked beak: a bird of bizarre beauty. The heraldic bird in his escutcheon, his totem, must also be winged. As a matter of fact, his private phantom, called Loplop, is such a grandseigneural bird, his alter ego, which turns up in his book of dreams and horrors " La Femme 100 tetes," the one with a hundred heads without a head (as he entitled the book ambiguously, phonetically). To quote from the book: " II est superieur des oiseaux, qui s'est fait chair sans chair et habite parmis nous. . . It is this Loplop which occupies a dom inating position also in his later works and illustrations, ruling over everything as once did the famous Roc-bird of the German Romantics— * Mrs. Giedion-Welcker has written several books on modern art, in which she is an internationally known specialist. 105</page><page sequence="2">106 Carola Giedion-Wfxcker though he now appears in a composite chthonic form, macabre and witty at the same time. tfut there are also anonymous bird inhabitants of his oenvre which flutter, circle, shriek, and hover (Fig. 1). Vulture-like nightingales menace children; pigeons congeal into one monumental pigeon bundle, to rise, so united, into the blue ether, or else they stare out like small imprisoned idols from the latticed bird cages. In the paintings from his most recent years, winged creatures appear in many versions of their species, be it as philosophical "ravens of wisdom" or as sinister bird demons, " les dieux obscures." They light up like " Bengal fire " on a dark sky. New birds are constantly emerging: birds which have held a pro found fascination for him since his childhood. They are the gods of the air, the manifestations of fantastic shapes, the vibrant irritants in a specific feel-climate. Like many others of his archetypal subjects, they are now interlaced into miraculous structures of the great " Nature Weave." He compresses them into 100,000 strata, forming relief-like walls, as in " 100,000 (cent mille) colombesor he structures them into porous giant's-sails. This " tausendfaltige enigmatische Chiffern sprache der Natur," as Novalis once called it (Paul Klee also invoked it in ever new visual images)—this it is that Max Ernst also reveals to us in his work in its many phases and stages of development. ine magician Jtrnst invents (1926) a new means of expression through a technic called frottage for the large prints of his " Histoire Naturelle" (Figure 2). By laying paper over wooden forms and grained stone, and then rubbing over it with a piece of graphite, he produces the finest linear textures, resembling spun materials, that are continuously transformed into a leaf, a bird, a flower, a hair. An enormous eye will suddenly seem to extend horizontally, with thorny lashes and blood vessels like the fine veins of a leaf. Commercial designers have today cheapened this invention. There is constant change in the frottages of the " Histoire Naturelle." The zoomorphic, the phyllomorphic, and the anthropomorphic are in limitless fluctuation fed from the gigantic basin of organic life. Max Ernst achieves in these works a fusion which was then—in 1926—the aim of the Surrealists. He is always and foremost to be seen in this double role: the aggressive revolutionary in technic and subject matter, and the dreamer obsessed by memories. This dual aspect is indicated in the title of one of his pictures: " Reve et revo lution."</page><page sequence="3">Max Ernst: Irony—Myth—Structure 107 Ernst migrated from the left side of the Rhine to France, as did the Alsatian Hans Arp, with whom he cemented a close friendship that lasts to this day. Both originated from the Rhineland in the narrow and wide sense of this geographical designation. Both grew up in the atmosphere of mediaeval towns: Ernst hailed from Bruhl near Cologne, Arp came from Strasbourg. It was these two artists who brought a kind of " pursang " Romanticism to the French group of Surrealists. Ernst betrayed his regional roots in a many-faceted and ingenious manner in a picture dedicated to "Father Rhine," to the river which flows, so to speak, through his youthful memories and, thus, through his personality (Figure 3). The painter interpreted his theme in a surprising way, poetically and pictorially, as mythical per sonification of a river and, at the same time, as a scientific object of study: as if it were an X-ray photo rendering the river in its green blue transparence with all its manifold microscopic details, in all its fluid existence, carrying vegetable and animal life with it as it flows along the everchanging landscape that it waters. The picture, painted at a late return in the year 1953, is a pictorial epos of "Father Rhine," and at the same time is a self-portrait: compare the shape of the skull of "Father Rhine" with that of his creator! He expands elementary nature into a cosmic symbol in much the same manner in which James Joyce condenses and multiplies poetically his Liffey River in Dublin into Anna Livia Plurabelle. There, in Finnegans Wake, one river branches out into a thousand rivulets, and becomes the multiple " river existence " of the world, flowing through the last work of the writer. iiut it is as impossible to fix the Irish writer regionally as it is to pin down the Rhenish painter. He has incorporated many countries, many landscapes during the seven decades of his life. He has immi grated into them, in a literal sense, in order to suck them in emotionally and then to create them afresh. They become the exciting and inciting ignitions, or confirmations of artistic statements of an inner world which he had envisaged and shaped a long time before the actual contact. This artist, with his Rhine and wine roots, possesses ease and grace of mind and of temper, and, like his countryman and friend August Macke, was always opposed to the heavy soul-freighted pathos of the German Expressionists. He became an American citizen after the second World War, living for years in the deserts of Arizona, close to the Indian Reservations, with his American wife, the painter Dorothea Tanning. He lives today with her in the heart of France, in the Touraine, on a farm, distinguished and appreciated as a natural ized Frenchman.</page><page sequence="4">108 Carola Giedion-Welcker 1 his rich and simultaneous development of so many fields belongs to the style of Ernst's life as well as to his artistic method. He talks and writes poetically in three " mother " languages, and he still claims three fatherlands. His manifold expressiveness in life and art does not keep him from concentrating upon one definite attitude of the mind, to pivot around one spiritual goal, to live in one spiritual climate which engenders his most profound impulses of life and creation. This con centration he has striven for since early youth with foreboding and pre cision, pursuing his goal with unerring determination. The direction of the road was charted many decades ago by the young student of philos ophy and painting at Bonn University, after he had been swallowed by the hell of the first World War from which he suddenly emerged to find his true self after a phase of senseless obedience and nameless horror. He wrote in his diary at that time with the cool exactitude of detachment and, at the same time, with a visionary lucidity, "Max Ernst died on August 1, 1914; he experienced his resurrection on November 11, 1918, as a young man who aimed to become a magician in order to find the mythos of his time." What is decisive in this statement is the determined inclination towards irrational spiritual forces, deriving from a wider aspect, which shall illuminate and domin ate his life and the domain of his artistic expression in a most resolute manner. His newly awakened need for action starts with attacks on the petrified ethical and aesthetic cliches and conventions, as a fight against rationalization and repression of the emotional side of life. A pictorial imagery is born with strong poetic "undertones," with witty titles, with a technic that attacks the virtuoso character of " peinture " which then dominated public taste. Collage and photomontage are elevated by Ernst to new means of expression. These become the "moyens pauvres " of which the musician Stravinsky spoke, and which Picasso meant when he said, " Pour moi, il n'y a pas de quartiers de noblesse dans l'art." His artistic career starts like that of the young Paul Klee, with criticism and satire. Utilitarian technical apparatus zooms and buzzes in the Dada-world of Max Ernst. These machines are made of cutouts from old catalogs and photographs. Torn from their functional, logical existence, they exemplify the nonsense of the all-powerful rationality by means of half insane combinations and paradoxical couplings. The climate is fantastic, cruel, fatal, and, most of all, charged with biting irony. They express a love-hatred for the machine,</page><page sequence="5">Max Ernst: Irony—Myth—Structure 109 similar to that found at the same time in the works of Marcel Duchamp, Picabia, and the poet Raymond Roussel. Ernst frequently signs these collages " Minimax " and " Dada-Max." He conjures up a strange world in which he manipulates these unusual combinations of the mechanical, the organic, and the human, breaking down all fixed relationships while pushing them to the absurd. The world seems to have lost its coherence. Une feels in these ten lithographs of 1920, collected under the title "Fiat Modes—Pereat Ars," the psychic atmosphere and the formal influence of de Chirico's mysterious world of dreams and symbols, while in other themes and titles Alfred Jarry's humour noir, and Lau treamont's sadism are manifest. Finally, one should mention the in fluence of Rimbaud's youthful, flaming spirit which invited the reader to a " dereglement de tous les sens," directed towards a total liberation of the powers of hallucination. The Cologne Dada movement—with the drawings, collages, texts and pictures of Ernst in the forefront—reached beyond the political boundaries of Germany into France. Thus, contact was made with the French poets Andre Breton and Paul Eluard. Ernst's friendship with Hans Arp at this time was very close. In 1920 Arp left the Zurich Dada movement to confirm the Cologne Dada-triumvirate: Ernst, Baargeld, Arp. "Holy Cologne" and the English, who then occupied the town, were so irritated that they rose in protest. Ernst participated with his collage exhibit in a Dada-Manifestation that fol lowed in Paris. After this temporary stay in the French metropolis, he took up permanent residence in France, first in Paris, in 1922. in tne group or surrealists which formed in 1924 out of the Dada movement, it was Ernst the painter, in the broadest sense of the word, who gave it visual distinction. His paintings became the group's strongest pictorial exponent, steadily reaching beyond the borders of France. Surrealism brought a poetical and plastic " credo " which was directed towards a new orientation: outer reality was to be inundated by the magic intensity of an all-powerful inner world, and the resulting " Sur-Realite " was to carry within itself the freshness of those sub conscious depths from which it sprang. Visions in words, writings, and pictures were to well up with immediacy, uncontrolled by reason. The influence of Sigmund Freud is as evident here as within the new poetic expression, such as the interior monologue of James Joyce's which so abundantly flows as an everlasting inner movement through Ulysses. The miraculous, as shock, horror, surprise, and dream-vision, was</page><page sequence="6">110 Carola Giedion-Welcker now declared to be true "beauty." But here the "blue flower of Romanticism" did not grow hidden and lost on a far distant flowery meadow: with these surrealist descendants she sprang from the street and the gutter, from the banalities of daily life. Only a fine sense of apprehension was needed to divine the " flower " intuitively. A trans formation of reality took place for those who were equipped with the "I wonder" of Lewis Carroll's Alice. It is quite understandable why just at that time Lewis Carroll's writings (the poetic product of a mathematician) should have produced a lasting impression on the Surrealist poets, particularly delighting and inspiring Max Ernst (the brilliant player of chess and croquette). We experience many varia tions of Alice and her friends in Ernst's work, and also of the mysteri ous " Snark-Spook " which he encompasses with a scintillating finesse in his illustrations. Ernst is no nebulous Phantasus, estranged from the world; he possesses, like the English writer whom he admired, a mathematical clarifying mind, which with scientific exactness can analyze phenomena. Both qualities—imagination and analytical ability are active within him. In 1934 the Kunsthaus in Zurich—nearly thirty years before the latest one (March-April 1963)—organized an exhibition of Ernst's paintings together with the sculptures of his friend Alberto Giacometti. In the introduction to the catalog of that show, Ernst discusses the question, "What is Surrealism? " with polish and precision. In order to clarify his explanation, he avails himself of certain aspects of modern microphysics. But here also, at the core of his statement, is his con fession to functioning as a medium in order to become one with the visible world. Further, he stresses the point that creativity is pri marily the outcome of the anonymous passivity of the artist, in con trast to the " classical" conception which holds that an " act of genius " is achieved through the imperative of the will. He opposes this latter view by emphasizing primarily empathy and fusion with the ever present genesis in nature, from which the individual act of creation can only later be detached. In the Zurich catalog he states his position thus: The Surrealist artist moves on the indistinct frontier between inner and outer world, free, courageous, and self-evident. He registers what he sees there. He lives and becomes active when his revolutionary instinct prompts him to do so.

He creates, in the second half of the 1920 s, free, visionary landscapes integrated with "realistic" impressions of nature (Figure 4). They emerge as somber "Forets-aretes," macabre and fairy tale-like forests, vertical structures which become veritable nests of sun and moon rings. The same circles are found rising and hovering like cosmic symbols in the horizontally stretched " Sea Pictures." Paintings depicting " pri meval hordes" express the mysterious drives and demonic horrors of the barbarian migrations which—for him—are always directed from the East to the West (Figure 5). The figures in them are woven from natural substances, from lichened tree bark or perforated stone sedi ment; they flare up like spooky human flames against the sky. These paintings are followed up in the 1930's by exotic hill towns entitled "La Ville entiere." They consist of the reddish strata of rock; they are deserted and destroyed. When, thirty years later, Ernst came to Arizona he recognized these products of his imagination as truly existing natural phenomena, once again experiencing them in the macabre shapes of the real ruins of European cities after the second World War. Though Ernst had expressed a kind of " anti-peinture " attitude in bis collages, photomontages, frottages, and decallquages, aiming at a new means of expression through these techniques, he turned anew in later years to a very refined manner of painting that is full of rich nuances. Next to his world of structures, he invented the so-called technique of " dripping," which was later to be developed by a younger generation (Jackson Pollock) as action painting. This technique of dripping squirts pigment in a circular motion from oscillating con tainers onto the canvas; it invests a strange head-transformation with i still stranger system of coordinates which seem to waver in space. The resulting picture, created in 1942, which is certainly one of the most original by the artist, is entitled "Young Man (Euclid) Irritated by the Flight of a Non-Euclidean Fly" (Figure 6). Accidental con struction and imagination have here concluded a bizarre alliance. In his later years Max Ernst paints increasingly with minute color particles which may be compared to the transparent scintillation of mosaic tesserae. A good example is his picture "33 Young Ladies Chasing a White Butterfly" (1957). He puts the stress on multiple white particles of pigment which give to the whole the effect of space in fluid motion. His painting " The Marriage of Heaven and Earth "</page><page sequence="12">112 Carola Giedion-Welcker (1962) seems to be merely breathed on canvas. It consists of only a few nervous horizontal lines and a dominant blue color-circle, a mere play of the relations between lines and shapes. We meet here a cosmic language that is still searching and seemingly unfinished, consciously not up to the aim of " final perfection." Lrnst s poet friend, Michel liiitor, understood perfectly the situation expressed in these late pictures; the impressions which they made upon him are set down in a poem dedicated to Max Ernst. The beginning lines provide in a highly compressed manner the heart of the painter's art: L'homme aux yeux fous qui voulait tuer la peinture mais la peinture etait sa vie et fut plus forte. . . . Ernst's development as a sculptor runs parallel to that of the painter. It began with the provocative Dada-creations, proceeded to the objet trouve (in nature), and culminated in the freely invented sculptural realization of his fantasy. Ernst describes, in a letter to the writer sent from House Giaccometti, some stones found on the Forno Glacier: "We found granite blocks, which have been miraculously polished by time, ice, and weather. Why should we not leave it to the elements of nature to do the real work, while we should be content to engrave upon stones, mainly in runes, our secrets." Later, however, Ernst has turned to a free sculptural forming, often stressing a burlesque note, similar to that of Miro. Foremost among these sculptures is the large group composition, "The King engaged in play with his queen" (Figure 7). In this composition he alternates contrasts of sinuous hard smooth volumes with encircled spaces that result in suggestive lightness and spatial tension. It is in his later years that Ernst realises the relations between painting, sculpture, and architecture, first in his farmhouse, St. Martin d'Ardeche, and then in the house which he built for himself in Sedona, Arizona. His most outstanding achievement is a mural in the Corso Bar, Zurich (1934, at present detached and temporarily in the Kunsthaus, Zurich). In this painting leaves and flowers are drawn in colors and lines of the utmost dynamic quality, as though they were in a constant process of anthropomorphic metamorphosis. To review: there remains one great constant in the rich complexity of Ernst's manifold artistic activity. That constant is the absolute dom inance of the irrational, of the world of dreams (though tied to outer</page><page sequence="13">Max Ernst: Irony—Myth—Structure 113 reality), and of the realm of the myth audaciously into our present, to be activated in the double-step of Irony and Depth Meaning (Ironie und tiefere Bedeutung). For Ernst, the world has always been very old while remaining an always young land of fairy tale and fable. "Mundus est Fabula" is the title of a picture made in 1959; through such a work the artist appears as the illustre forgero?i des reves, the daring dream forger of the imagination, who is both audacious inventor and precise artisan. "Art is a game—but a serious one," Caspar David Friedrich, the great romantic creator of dream landscapes once said; Max Ernst seems to convey this romantic attitude of the admired master into modern times.</page></plain_text>
