<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Beauty in the Context of Particular Lives PAULIINA RAUTIO Introduction There is a village in the north of Finland with some thirty inhabitants.  While the villagers do not lead the idyllic lives that are sold as images to  tourists, they also do not lead lives of depression, alcoholism, poverty, and  seclusion—an image generated by research results from the likes of Nation- al Research and Development Centre for Welfare and Health. The ill-being  of rural northern villages is well documented in large-scale quantitative  research,1 but qualitative research on the actual well-being, of what is al- ready good and fulfilling, is scarce.  In this paper I present a research project in education in which I have   collected the data through a year-long correspondence with four partici- pants from a small village. Letters in this correspondence were exchanged  once a month in a way that everyone read everyone’s letters. I asked the par- ticipants to write about beauty. The aim of this research has been to find out  what kind of place beauty, as defined by the participants themselves, holds  in the their everyday lives. In this paper I will discuss some challenges of  researching everyday beauty empirically. I will also concentrate on selected  findings that highlight the importance of context in discussing experiences  and use of beauty.  Everyday life2 has been characterized in research by concepts such as  “time,” “space,” “rhythm,” and “bodily movement.”3 These concepts em- brace an idea of a continuum and refer to everyday life as subjectively ex- perienced and actively engaged in. Everyday life is a contextual process  but one that nevertheless defies definitions bound in time and space. This  is because as subjectively experienced, it entails simultaneously the past,  the present, and the future as necessary for the managing of it. By manag- ing of everyday life I mean a practice that consists of constant reflection,   evaluation, and steering, but one that we are mostly unaware of engaging  Pauliina Rautio is a doctoral student at the University of Oulu. Her research inter- ests include aesthetics, education, everyday life, human-environment relations, and  qualitative methodology.

We are in a way creating our everyday lives as we go. This makes the   everyday a subjective construct instead of an objectively definable unit such  as “a Monday.” And so, instead of an attempt to tame the very vague notion  of “everyday” as something universally shared,4 this research delves into  particular individuals’ everyday lives as uniquely managed continuums.  And to strike a rare positive chord to research on rural northern villages,  I have chosen aesthetics, the notion of beauty in particular, as the vantage  point to this making of everyday.  I’m aligning with Ludwig Wittgenstein and quoting Katya Mandoki in  stating that “beauty is a linguistic effect used by a particular subject to de- scribe personal experiences and social conventions . . . a linguistic catego- risation of a non-linguistic experience.”5 And despite the ambivalence that  surrounds beauty as a concept in scholarly discussion, it is to be noted that  it has remained in constant use in everyday conversation of common experi- ence. When commonly used, “beautiful” still signals admiration, excellence,  and that which is desirable.6 Beauty is therefore future-oriented, bringing  about replication, distribution, and a wish to protect.7 As such a concept and  a word of everyday use, “beauty” orients us to concentrate on the desirable  in our lives at present. In doing so it guides us to evaluate this desirable- ness in light of the past and commits us to replicate and protect it for the  future. Embedded in the use of the concept of beauty is thus a continuum of  evaluating one’s relation to her surroundings. As beauty is not a quality of  objects in themselves but an effect of the relation between the experiencing  subjects and certain objects,8 it is not the objects of everyday beauty that I  explore but the relation of particular people to their everyday life environ- ments through ways of using and expressing beauty.  The significance in thinking of beauty as something we create and use  rather than something that exists objectively is in the realization that we can  change what we find beautiful. Beauty as used by a particular subject is not  fixed but changes and mirrors the changing of that subject herself. In real- izing beauty this way, it becomes a source of reflection into our growth as  human beings. The significance of considering the context of beauty is in the  realization through Charles Taylor9 that our “selves” are not units separate  from our surroundings. We do not change somehow “inside” without an  input or engagement with the “outside.” We change, grow, in an active rela- tion to whatever surrounds us. An aesthetic relation, as this research shows,  is an active one. Background Within anthropology of education, a stance has been taken that humans or  humanity in educational research should no longer be approached as uni- versal phenomena but as and through research of actual persons in concrete  social, cultural, and historical contexts.10 A similar claim has been made  JAE 44_4 text.indd   39 10/14/10   1:58:31 PM </page> <page sequence="3"> 40  Rautio within the field of aesthetics. To balance out the analytical and art-centered  approach of aesthetics, “the aesthetic,” and as part of it, beauty, should be  defined by also referring to particular individuals and their everyday life  contexts.11 To understand beauty from a particular person’s point of view,  we need knowledge of their particular daily lives and surroundings. This is  beginning to be done within what is by now coined as “everyday aesthet- ics.” It is a fairly new area within applied aesthetics, and within aesthetics  in general it has been until recently an overlooked and still somewhat con- tested area of research.  The concrete place of this research, and thus the site of everyday beauty  in question here, is the village of Suvanto, located in the Eastern Lapland,  in the North of Finland well above the Arctic Circle. Nearby rise the fells of  Pyhä and Luosto, both thriving tourist centers. The river Kitinen, dammed  in 1990, runs along this picturesque village that was once voted the most  beautiful village of Lapland. The 1960s saw the decline of population in this  village, and today it is inhabited by about thirty people year-round. There  are four children under eighteen in the village. This part of Finland is one of  the country’s most rapidly depopulating regions. The municipalities of the  North of Finland have also seen drastic cuts in public spending. According  to the National Research and Development Centre for Welfare and Health,  the once “virtuous” regional balance of social welfare in the country has  turned into a “vicious circle” in the North. In spite of the seemingly obvi- ous changes for worse in welfare, the social consequences of the ongoing  socioeconomic transformation and governmental restructuring have so far  received relatively little interest.12  To study the everyday lives of these villagers as unfolding in time and in  a specific environmental and social context, I needed to access more than a  slice of their life. I needed more than one or two interviews. And as I wanted  to approach everyday life as close as possible through the eyes and bod- ies living them, I felt it was not for me to observe anyone’s life but to ask  these people to do it themselves. This is how I came to correspondence as a  method for data collection: it entailed a process in time, but the participants  could write when they wanted and how they wanted—without my imme- diate presence.  I corresponded with four villagers over a year’s time, exchanging letters  once a month and in a way that everyone read everyone’s letters. In educa- tional research, letters and letter writing as pedagogical and professional  tools have been widely documented and researched.13 The use of archived  or published letters is not unheard of either.14 What has not been so eagerly  reported, however, is correspondence being used as a primary data collec- tion method in research that is not about tools of pedagogical practices, and  more precisely, correspondence that is initiated by the researcher and pro- duced for research purposes.15 JAE 44_4 text.indd   40 10/14/10   1:58:31 PM </page> <page sequence="4"> Beauty in the Context of Particular Lives  41  There are four women from the village of Suvanto taking part in this  research.16 The correspondence carried out as agreed throughout the year  with everyone participating. A total of forty-four letters, each from two to  six sheets of typewritten text resulted. As supplementary data, I have col- lected both life-story interviews and thematic interviews from each of the  participants before and after the year of correspondence. The instruction I  gave for the beginning correspondence was for the participants to observe  their daily lives through what they found beautiful and then write about it.  I  encouraged them to think and define “beautiful” as freely as they wanted  and could.  Beauty or beautiful within aesthetics seems to be a debated concept.  Katya Mandoki calls it a fetish of aesthetics. Ruth Lorand expresses in  the title of her paper that she has to defend the concept; and although not  strictly aestheticians, Susan Sontag presents “An Argument about Beauty,”  and Elaine Scarry feels a need to write on behalf of beauty in her book On  Beauty and Being Just.17 Beauty is constantly presented as “problematic” or  “dangerous,” as well as something unjustly neglected and in need of furi- ous defending.18 In this research, the focus is on beauty as a concept that the  participants use and define themselves. Beauty is taken as a positive judge- ment, a specifically personal response or relation to one’s surroundings.  Reasons behind the chosen focus—beauty—lie in that (1) it is a concept  and a word of everyday use and as such is open enough to invite personal,  reflective, and value-laden responses; (2) it makes for a positive and thus an  alternative viewpoint to researching rural northern life, which is usually ap- proached through what is wrong or lacking; and (3) everyday aesthetics as  a theoretical approach is missing from educational research or it is misguid- edly restricted to art education only. Questions around aesthetics are central  to all aspects of education and have implications for a wider array of areas  than the arts alone.19 The ability to relate to your surroundings aesthetically  is a skill that demands a lot of insight into who you are, what your values  are, and where you situate yourself in your community and society. To say  “beautiful” is to judge something as desirable and good. Such a judgment  requires evaluation and reflection and above all an ethical awareness. Aes- thetic perception carries both personal and social significance and a connec- tion to education, to living and growing as human beings.20 On Researching Everyday Beauty Empirically According to most modern learning theories, when educating people the  first task is to find out the level of knowledge or skills already possessed.  For there to be any aesthetic education of the everyday, we need to first find  out if and how beauty has significance in the everyday lives of particular  people. We need empirical insights into the use of beauty. JAE 44_4 text.indd   41 10/14/10   1:58:31 PM </page> <page sequence="5"> 42  Rautio  Theoretical incentives exist to back up such an empirical quest.  Ludwig  Wittgenstein, for one, has famously claimed aesthetics to be severely mis- understood in his time and has called for attention not to words such as  “beautiful” but to the complex contexts and situations and the ways in  which these words are used in real life.21 But as soon as one descends,  if you wish, to an empirical level of studying particular individuals and  particular lives, theoretical and methodological challenges arise: Is it  possible to grasp a subjective experience of beauty in the midst of fleet- ing everyday life?  One of the core questions in everyday aesthetics seems to revolve around  the distinction between an everyday life ordinarily experienced and one  extraordinarily experienced.22 The former is often presented as an under- dog, having lacked attention for too long. Yuriko Saito claims, justly, that  it is important to shed light on the aspects of our daily lives that normally  don’t stand out in their experiential context but have a considerable impact  on our judgments and decisions concerning our daily actions.23 In a simi- lar vein, Arto Haapala advocates for the “familiar” instead of the preva- lent “strange” in aesthetics and makes a Heideggerian distinction between  aesthetics of the everyday per se and the aestheticization of the everyday.24  Such a distinction may well be plausible in theory, but how does one re- search the familiar empirically without necessarily, through this attention to  it, making it strange and extraordinary?  Perhaps due to the method of data collection chosen for this research,  the daily objects or activities that are “strange” or “that make us pause and  take a note”25 are well represented in the research data. The participants  admitted to writing the letters mostly at one go once a month, recalling and  rephrasing their “mental notes” or actual jottings here and there. This way,  the memorable stand-out experiences might be overrepresented at the cost  of the more forgettable, fleeting, and “familiar” moments. Perhaps, unlike  in theory, in practice the line between familiar and strange is difficult to  maintain without familiar always turning into strange. A participant of this  research, Laura, reflects this insightfully: I feel it is impossible to depict genuinely the moment that we   experience something beautiful. As soon as I start to write about it,  to  photograph it or to draw or paint it, all of my thoughts, experienc- es, emotions and memories are there changing and interpreting the  image. The moment I think of something as beautiful is the moment  when the game is already lost. It is already an interpretation of my  mind. . . . I think that the writing of a beauty-experience is a whole  another experience. It has to do with the beauty of telling a story, of  combining things, the joy and beauty of reflection and interpretation.  . . . Even if one is not writing beauty-letters the same thing happens  anyway when noticing something beautiful. You in a way store it in  yourself either for your own use or for to tell someone about it. JAE 44_4 text.indd   42 10/14/10   1:58:32 PM </page> <page sequence="6"> Beauty in the Context of Particular Lives  43 In his review of the first anthology on everyday aesthetics, Jeffrey Petts  finds the distinction between familiar and strange unnecessary and incoher- ent.26 Tom Leddy calls it dualism to separate the ordinary in the everyday  and the extraordinary in the everyday. For him there is no opposition but a  dialectical relationship. Extraordinary exists as a possibility within the ordi- nary, and each moment in everyday life is uniquely precious.27 In the above  quote, Laura struggles with the gap that she feels exists between her genu- ine experience of beauty and an attempt to communicate it. What seems to  constitute this gap for Laura is reflection.  On one hand, she feels that the “game is lost” and the genuine experience  ruined when the possibility of the extraordinary within the ordinary actual- izes through thinking or writing. On the other hand, through this actualiz- ing, through reflecting on and interpreting the ordinary into extraordinary,  she arrives at another experience that she characterizes as beautiful: the ac- tive contextualizing that happens in reflection, the conscious making of con- nections. Laura thus recognizes two related levels of beauty in her passage,  the first being subjective and nonlinguistic and the second intersubjective,  communicable. There is a dialectical relationship in that the first beautiful  brings about the reflected second, and this reflection affects the future firsts  as she “stores” it for later use. She talks about having found new things to  appreciate as beautiful and having widened her scope of beautiful things in  her life.  In her subsequent letters Laura, continues to find delight in both kinds  of experiences, but the movement and alteration between the two proves of  special significance in retrospect. Aiming to find out in this research how  the participants use beauty in their everyday lives, Laura’s passage above  has been of key importance. It seems that education, taken as a process of  our constitutive and perpetual growing as human beings, is located in the  alteration between the first and the second kinds of beautifuls sampled in  Laura’s passage. In between the two kinds there is relational reflection.28  The ordinary, when once reflected and made extraordinary even for a brief  moment, is never the same again. By “relational reflection” I mean what  Elaine Scarry writes when she portrays beauty as prompting one’s mind to  move chronologically back and forth—back in the search for precedents and  parallels and forth into new acts of creation.29 And I mean also what Katya  Mandoki states when she writes about the myth of aesthetic distance and  introduces, instead of distance, a concept of “aesthetic swinging.”  Having judged something as beautiful we have redirected our lives,   repositioned ourselves, even if only slightly. In the words of Elaine Scarry:  “[T]hey [beautiful things] lift us (as though by the air currents of someone  else’s sweeping), letting the ground rotate beneath us several inches, so  that when we land, we find we are standing in a different relation to the  world than we were a moment before.”30 In Laura’s letters there is a  pattern  JAE 44_4 text.indd   43 10/14/10   1:58:32 PM </page> <page sequence="7"> 44  Rautio  illustrating this “lift-and-land” that Scarry writes about. Laura  usually  titles  a sequence with a few descriptive words, such as “In the field,” and then goes  on to write something that has happened to her: “Today I was once again  looking at my house, the yard and the village from that field and thinking of  the beauty of all that I saw.” She then continues to describe, reflect on, and  interpret even on symbolic levels what has happened or what she has seen  or encountered: “Nothing is perfect like in some well-maintained suburb.  The yards are bigger and not fenced, the lawns grow taller and wild flowers  bloom. Bushes are wilder and bigger. In everything, nature and man walk  hand in hand, nature always one step ahead.” And finally, almost without  exception, she lands with a positive note that brings in coherence and carries  on to the future: “On these short walks I’ve collected in me a vast amount of  beauty-memories of this village to use as resources later on.”  At times she might pick up on things later in the same letter or in   following letters as she has recurring themes that keep developing over the  year. The pattern, however, is almost always clear and simple, and as she  sticks with it throughout the year it seems to work for her. In the interviews  after the correspondence year she appreciates precisely this: having the time  and a reason to think about the positive things in her life. She feels that  finding out new things through reflecting and concentrating on beauty in  her life was rewarding. She also connects beauty with her moods: finding  beauty would make her feel good, but also when she was feeling good, she  would find beautiful things around her more easily. All in all, lifting little  things out of her “ordinary” daily life and through reflection making them  “extraordinary” had given her insights into her surroundings, her relations  to other people, and also her connection to her own feelings.  The empirical research of everyday beauty must, in this research, be seen  as research of not the subjective and nonlinguistic daily experiences but of  the reflected accounts that necessarily cumulate to guide all future experi- ences. And this is research of the dialectical movement between the two— how things are brought to be reflected and what is then made of them—that  is, of the active using of beauty in the making and managing of one’s every- day life. Recurring Themes—When Everything Is in Place Yuriko Saito and Elaine Scarry note that a positive aesthetic reaction evokes  not only words but acts such as protection, preservation, and promotion.31  Wittgenstein emphasises actions over words as well, pointing out that when  we find something aesthetically pleasing we act accordingly.32 If a dress  pleases me, I use it over and over again—and this I might do without ever  explicating that it is a beautiful dress. In this research, the act of writing a  letter on beauty, especially one that is read by many and is known to serve  as research data, can be seen as an act of preservation and promotion of  JAE 44_4 text.indd   44 10/14/10   1:58:32 PM </page> <page sequence="8"> Beauty in the Context of Particular Lives  45  positive aesthetic experiences. An aesthetic relation to one’s surroundings  seems to be an active one in a concrete way. In the letters, beauty is very  often connected to doing or something happening.  The themes that keep recurring throughout the year in everyone’s letters  are (1) doings, (2) surroundings, (3) animals, and (4) time. They can be read  as the base on top of which everyone then develops her own more subjec- tive thoughts and reflections on beauty. These four themes appear in the let- ters as mostly unproblematic and almost always bringing an air of relief and  security—of things being alright and in place. Anchored in these themes,  the participants then write of specific instances and reflect on the extraordi- nary, which can be less coherent and more open-ended or even troubling.  When things appear as they should they seem to be taken as good. Using  beauty to reflect on and direct your everyday life seems to be at times a con- scious moral project for the participants. The participants write of their ev- eryday lives in a way that reveals a personal direction. When one accounts  not just any Monday but a beautiful Monday, the writing seems to carry  forward; there is a plan and an intention to repeat in the future what was  beautiful and good then. Apart from beautiful, the false morel stew is also delicious. The mush- rooms are picked, blanched and frozen by a neighbour. Next summer  I want to go and pick some myself. The onions, garlic and thyme from  my own garden make this stew wonderfully local, not to mention the  self grown almond potatoes and carrots along with the self picked  and made lingonberry jam that the stew is served with. It feels good  to make food from what you’ve grown yourself. The most mentioned accounts of everyday beauty have to do with acts or  situations involving the participants doing concrete things themselves. The  letters are bursting with cleaning, painting, planting, growing, knitting,  and sculpting of snow. Yuriko Saito as well as Elaine Scarry recognize this  phenomenon of acting or creating as something that follows an everyday  aesthetic experience.33 They talk about an impulse toward begetting after  the actual aesthetic encounter or experience. However, in the letters of this  research it is often the actual doing that is written about as beautiful. When  considering one’s identity or “self” not as something “inside” that can be  separated from the “outside” but as a relation to whatever surrounds one,  the doings in the letters make sense. In acting and engaging with our sur- roundings, we sculpt and maintain a relation to our surroundings—in a  word, our identity.  That many “-ings” are felt to be beautiful could also be looked at in the  broader socioeconomic context of the villagers’ lives. The employment situ- ation in a remote village in Lapland is not bright. The villagers have had to  adapt to lives where they are making ends meet in ever–changing ways.  They employ themselves, take on various part-time and seasonal jobs, grow  JAE 44_4 text.indd   45 10/14/10   1:58:32 PM </page> <page sequence="9"> 46  Rautio their food, knit and sew their clothes, and chop their firewood—in short,  they survive. Instead of depression and apathy, there seems to be a definite  sense of pride in being able to live like this. The four participants seem to  find their everyday surviving beautiful per se.  Surroundings ranging from the nearby fells to a birch in one’s yard seem  to be mentioned in connection with balance, stability, and feelings of secu- rity. “The tall spruces” or “the river banks” are written about as beautiful at  instances when one is coming home from work or is on an evening walk,  just before going to bed. These are instances in the rhythm of the everyday  when action sequences shift34 and a transition to a following sequence re- quires adaptation.  These accounts of beauty in one’s inanimate surroundings are also  deeply connected to the rhythm of the seasons changing. Sceneries are ad- mired when they are in accord with the season, when everything looks “as  it should.” As with vast scenes of the starry, frosty night skies, the beauty  reported in connection with seasons changing seems to imply a need or a  use for the occasional check of everything being alright in one’s daily sur- roundings. As part of one’s inanimate surroundings, weather is mentioned  as beautiful or in connection with a beautiful event both when it is somehow  exceptional and when it is not exceptional but indeed comfortingly usual.  Unusually sunny February with just enough frost makes for rare snow that  is very good to ski on. Snow as such and the skiing on it are described as  beautiful. Usual temperatures, winds, and rains are reported as signs of a  reassuring cycle of nature and thus beautiful. They are discussed in the let- ters as signs of nature “knowing” something better than humans.  Low degrees of frost are mentioned often, sometimes even slightly   boasting. Not being able to really go outside for three days or having to  wear four layers of woollen socks are all mentioned in connection with ev- eryday beauty. Extreme colds seem to be portrayed as depicting the beauty  of survival; the beauty of knowledge and skills to survive, to live on na- ture’s terms. The beauty of surviving (although there is never a case of life  or death) seems to relate to a sense of balance between control and submis- sion to one’s environment and weather conditions.  The participants write often about their “fellow travellers,” referring to  the animals they encounter in their daily lives. The extent and attention with  which they write about animals is such that it almost shadows the accounts  of beauty having to do with fellow human beings. Apart from pets such  as cats, the frequency that birds are mentioned in the letters is noteworthy.  There are migratory birds such as swans and swallows that appear in all of  the spring letters. There is the Tengmalm’s owl nesting near the village. This  owl’s song appears in everyone’s letters. There are the black grouses that  live in coveys in and around the village. The sight of birds as well as what  the participants say they represent are beautiful: everything being alright,  light and easy and in place. JAE 44_4 text.indd   46 10/14/10   1:58:32 PM </page> <page sequence="10"> Beauty in the Context of Particular Lives  47  One participant writes about her watching of swallows making a nest as  beautiful: not the swallows, nor their nest-making, but her watching of it.  Most participants would agree and do write elsewhere that time set aside  for just watching, sitting, listening, or “just being” is beautiful in itself. Aldo  Leopold’s land ethics and aesthetics and “the feeling of love,” the affection  toward their home village, is evident in the letters of this research.35  Then there is the source of beauty par excellence: time. The fascination  with aged objects is perhaps the most poignant example of time being a  very central theme in the letters. Yuriko Saito writes of historical associa- tions and the aestheticization of transience in connection with the appre- ciation of aged objects. She labels this appreciation as having to do with  human transience and the impermanence of everything. Time for Saito is a  great equalizer, and aged objects exemplify this process: the march of time.36  Based on the participants’ accounts of beauty having to do with aged ob- jects, however, I am inclined to rephrase this.  The most often mentioned aged objects in the letters are pieces of   furniture, old houses and barns, old windows, and household objects.37  How these are described and how their beauty is reflected on in the letters  has to do primarily with a sense of continuation: a march of time but as  the continuation of everything instead of as impermanence of everything.  There’s only a slight difference, but in an educational view it is a significant  one. The participants seem to associate aged objects to the flow of genera- tions, connectedness and continuity, being part of something larger and a  sense of belonging. In short, immortality in a way. The educational and ethi- cal perspective that reaches over generations past and those to come is best  described with the beauty of continuity, rather than that of impermanence.  When beginning to research beauty in everyday life I expected to read  letters of daily happenings such as doing dishes, driving to work, and sort- ing laundry. The amount of existential reflections present in the letters thus  surprised me. I will discuss in the tailpiece of this paper that beauty seems  to be used by the participants often for “situating in time.” Things that feel  beautiful for the participants are those that offer necessary insights into the  passing of time and resonate with one’s everyday life, bringing scale to it.  Beauty in one’s everyday life is not merely found, it is created in continu- ously engaging with one’s surroundings. Beauty is an entry point to the in- tricate webs of significance with which we connect and relate ourselves to  our surroundings but rarely acknowledge. The Context of Particular Lives Analyzing everyday aesthetic experiences after the model of Western   paradigmatic art is said to be misguided as it compromises their rich and  diverse content.38 I would continue that analyzing everyday aesthetic   experiences without attention to particular people and the context of their  JAE 44_4 text.indd   47 10/14/10   1:58:33 PM </page> <page sequence="11"> 48  Rautio lives is misguided for the same reasons—at least in an educational view.  Each participant in this research harbors a unique way of approaching and  defining beauty, to the extent that the letters of these four neighbours, writ- ing from the same small village, could at times read as letters from four  completely different places. Each participant seems to have her own way  of using beauty in her life specific to her current situation and life history.  There is beauty when everything is alright, but the feeling of everything  being alright is to be understood in a very particular context. To one person  the yardstick of “alright” is different than for another.  Seija is the only participant born in the village and the only woman of  her generation to have stayed in the village. She has a husband and two  children. She was the only one in the family who was working at the time  of this research. She worked on and off depending on seasons, mainly in  the tourist industry cleaning and catering. Her son had just graduated from  high school and her daughter finished comprehensive school. The children  lived in a rented flat in a town where their schools were. Seija’s hobbies are  painting, textiles, writing poems, and restoring furniture. The Tengmalm’s owl sings out its existence: bububu-bubu-bubu- bu. . . . 14th of April. On Saturday the swans flew and sang. Wonder- ful, they have returned. One’s mind revives at the sight of them flying  and singing. I was on my way to fell Pyhä again when I saw a willow  grouse by the roadside. It was already two-coloured. Spring is so far.  Snow is still good and the weather beautiful. . . .  This is everyday life in Suvanto apart from other chores. In between there  are glimpses of beauty revealed. Comings, goings, admiring the life in na- ture. Distances are long, but things have to be taken care of and work done.  Children’s school and hobbies have to be supported and favoured. One  leaves her own demands second as long as the family’s wishes are fulfilled.  Seija’s writing is short and descriptive. At times and increasingly toward  the end of the correspondence year, she does engage in wonderings and  even writes down her thoughts in poems. Typical of her letters are the de- scriptions of coming and going, of driving to different places and taking her  children to their hobbies. While on the move she keeps noticing animals  coming and going as well: a moose somewhere, birds everywhere. The core  of her everyday beauty seem to be the encounters with animals, the follow- ing of seasons through different signs in nature, and the coming and going  itself as a concrete way of taking care of her family.  Seija’s writing and her accounts of beauty throughout the year have a  very clear rhythm that follows the seasons. She knows enough to follow  countless signs around her—temperatures, behaviors of animals, weather,  growth patterns of plants—and throughout the year she orients herself   according to her changing environment. She is clearly in tune with her   environment, her home village, and finds beauty in living and breathing  JAE 44_4 text.indd   48 10/14/10   1:58:33 PM </page> <page sequence="12"> Beauty in the Context of Particular Lives  49 at the same pace as her place. The breaks in this pace are what bring about   reflection in Seija. Her unstable working situation and the comings and go- ings of her children keep affecting her life concretely. Her extensive accounts  of driving a car here and there contrast with the stable recurring cycles of  seasons and animals’ behavior that she also writes about. This is where the  dialectical alteration of “ordinary” and “extraordinary” is most evident in  Seija’s everyday beauty: she finds reassuring beauty in the cycles of seasons,  but she also finds beauty in her unpredictable comings and goings as she is  tending to her family’s needs and providing for them.   Then there is Erja, who is a newcomer in the village. She has lived in  Suvanto for a couple of years. She came to the village from the South of Fin- land to find herself (in her own words). Her life history is filled with painful  events and memories and constant moving from one place to another. In the  first interview, she expressed her very conscious wish and attempt “to grow  roots [in the village].” She is single, works in a nearby town, and lives with  her cats and a dog. The stove emanates warmth; fire crackles and the sound of sough  tells of good draught. The porridge kettle smiles contentedly, cheeks  blushing and the porridge coming along in good time. Water is boil- ing in its own kettle. The warmth glows the room awake from the  drowse of the night frost. By the stove there is beauty for all of the  senses. Warmth reaches the dining table. Waves pour out to caress the  breakfast diner whose feet are packed with layers and layers of socks.  Mittens are not needed now. In Erja’s at times very poetic writing, the most striking aspect is the level of  anthropomorphism present. Whatever she writes about—a river, a house, a  barn, a cat, a carrot—is endowed with human characteristics, features, and  feelings. She engages in conversations and relationships with every animate  or inanimate object in her life. “His majesty, the grand white ruler with his  bald head,” is the nearby fell looking onto and guarding her village. The  little sauna building in her yard “with its friendly eyes” greets her as she  comes home from work. Erja seems to be weaving a web of strong relations  to her concrete and instant surroundings in her home village. She writes  about feeling secure with the surrounding woods “watching over me.” Her  conscious, even adamant, attempt to lay roots in this village of her some- what random choice shows in her letters and in the things she finds beauti- ful—almost has decided to find beautiful—in her everyday life.  Erja is also fascinated with aspects in her everyday life that have to do  with living in the North and in a very small village—everything that con- trasts with her previous home environment in one of the biggest cities in  the South of Finland. She mentions the winter period of darkness often as  beautiful, as well as the pouring all-day light in the summer. She marvels  at frozen carrots in her basement, at snow storms and the biting frost. Her  writing seems to say: look, I can make it here, I belong here. She emphasizes  JAE 44_4 text.indd   49 10/14/10   1:58:33 PM </page> <page sequence="13"> 50  Rautio and brings in her knowledge of the village and of life in the North in her   letters. She uses proper names of islands, woods, and fells, is aware of the  right amount of layers of socks and mittens to wear, knows how to make  a fire and orient herself in a pitch-dark village. In short, she seems to find  beautiful those moments in her everyday life that affirm to her that she has  chosen the right place, that she knows enough to make it as a “northerner.”  The third participant, Kaarina, is well over sixty-five, has no children,  lives with her husband, and runs a family tourist business together with  him. She has lived in the village for about fifty years. She moved in the 1950s  from a nearby town when she married Heikki. She has a café that dou- bles as an art gallery in the village. She also organizes painting courses  in the summer. It’s a beautiful sunny day. Sauna-day. I’m just about to go out for a  walk. I must go and look for beauty again around this village. . . . The weather is all right now. I go for a walk. Looking around at the  beautiful things I might find out in the nature of Lapland. Heikki  comes home from fishing burbots. A few fishes kicking there. I make  burbot-soup, so good, not so colourful. . . . Easter flowers shine there on the table, white snow shows through the  window. This spring light is blinding. We laid out potatoes to germi- nate yesterday. There, in the sun, the almond potatoes loll around. Kaarina’s letters are very short and at times read like lists of what she has  done and seen. There’s a distinct pattern though. She keeps writing about  how she has to go and look for beauty. Usually this looking is done during  an evening walk. She then writes about the things she found to be beautiful:  snow, flowers, sunlight, or trees, all of which can be considered “safe,” gen- erally agreed with judgments of beauty. After reporting these, she moves on  to describe something else that has happened and that she wants to share as  well. These other things she does not mention as beautiful straight out, but  it is easy to read them as the more personal accounts of beauty. These usu- ally have to do with doing daily chores together with her husband, with her  waking up too early and just spending time in quiet, or with her socializing  with other people and taking part in various events.  Kaarina seems to have an idea of what should be beautiful, and she is  constantly on the look for this. But it is actually everything else in her letters  that read as more significant and more beautiful to her. Overall, her letters  are balanced between accounts of the utmost tranquility and solitude and  the buzzing and socializing of a tourist entrepreneur.  Seija, Erja, and Kaarina have distinct ways of writing and accounting  for beauty in their everyday lives. What they share in the end is a complex  and dynamic conception of what is beautiful. All keep searching for simple  beautiful things but end up almost inevitably explaining and describing a  web of very complicated connections. There is history, politics, social life,  JAE 44_4 text.indd   50 10/14/10   1:58:33 PM </page> <page sequence="14"> Beauty in the Context of Particular Lives  51 and national culture present along with personal values and beliefs. The  participants seem to use beauty as if it were glue, trying to make connec- tions and find relations between bits and pieces in their daily life—and not  just between any aspects in their lives but those that are significant, valued,  and positive.  In Seija’s letters she weaves a web of significant things that include his- tory and traditions of the village, her woodwork and textile skills, and her  changing jobs and time-consuming driving routines. As the year goes by  she keeps elaborating and adding on to this web. She repeats the basic ele- ments of her web in every letter: seasons changing with all the signs thereof,  traditional chores for the season, her present chores and tasks according to  that season, her current job situation and her children’s comings and goings.  The connecting points in this web are the signs of nature’s repeating cycles:  the coming and going of migratory birds, changing weather, and blooming  times of different plants. It is these connecting points that she mostly writes  about as beautiful, but through them the entire web starts to feel beautiful.  In addition to reading individual participants’ letters, I have read every- one’s letters as one whole correspondence. I have done this asking not only  what the place—function and space—of beauty in one’s everyday life is but  also within which kind of social frame is this place expressed compared to  others. I have searched for shared topics in the letters and have then, based  on these shared expressions, sketched a social frame within which the par- ticipants write and with which they also want to write themselves as dif- ferent from others. This is a frame that seems to challenge the idealizing or  depressing rhetoric of life in small villages of the North. With this frame I  can begin to turn the shades of gray into the black and white rhetoric, which  I set out to do in the first place. The collective frame I have traced from the  correspondence data is this: there is beauty in surviving.  Everyone writes of piles of snow, low degrees of frost, wet summers, old  houses, long drives to work, and seasons of unemployment. Everyone also  writes of the majestic fells, the growing of plants, picking of berries, and  spotting black grouse and reindeer here and there. The elements of prevalent  stereotypical rhetoric are there: the misery and the idyll. But the way these  are tackled as everyday life contents challenges both kinds of rhetoric. Sur- prisingly, most described instances of beauty in the letters have to do with  the seemingly miserable: overcoming resistance such as extreme weather  or unemployment. To survive is to know and endure something that others  living elsewhere do not know nor would endure but instead  label misery.  When everyday life requires an effort—be it shoveling snow or arranging  seasonal odd jobs—your life feels as your own making. When there is no- body to do things for you—usually considered a serious downfall of living in  the rural north—you learn to survive and make ends meet. This seems to be  at the core of well-being, not ill-being, in the everyday lives of the villagers. It  provides them with a sense of pride and control, and agency in their lives.

She married a native villager and is now a mother of three. She  has completed vocational education in restoration and was initially brought  to the village when engaging in a restoration project of old protected hous- es. During her life in the village, she has been a stay-at-home mom, unem- ployed or short- and part-time employed with various tasks that are mostly  unrelated to her education. She is an active member of the village associa- tion and responsible, for instance, for collecting, digitizing, and archiving  old photographs from the village. Her [daughter’s] hair falls on my face, I feel a kiss on my cheek and  then she’s gone. I close my eyes happy. It is good to be home, to know  that you are important and in the right place. I listen to the children  babble in the next room and without opening my eyes I know it’s a  beautiful morning. I will concentrate here on three main themes arising from Laura’s letters: (1)  the growing of plants and of children,39 (2) windows and directions, and (3)  solitude. These are the most recurrent themes, present from the beginning  all the way to the final letter. Of all the participants, Laura’s daily reflec- tions read as the most existential and complex, embracing a multitude  of levels from a sandwich on her hand to the universe surrounding her.  When beauty lifts Laura, or when she seeks to be lifted by it, she truly  flies high and returns to a different everyday than what she departed  from. Laura’s letters have made me coin a concept of “aesthetic escapes”  as educationally significant moments in one’s everyday life. These are  not moments of life-changing decisions but fleeting and small, micro- scale steering maneuvers in one’s life. Escapism and beauty are usually  connected and often found vain, but Laura’s reflective aesthetic escapes  read as anything but vanity. On one cloudy day I decide to wash the windows from outside. . . .  By the old mountain ash I step down and look at what I’ve done. The  window reflects partly an image of the yard, partly a scene from in- side, from the living room. In nine old squares of glass there is my  whole world: in the lower right corner there is a woman dressed in  a worn out scarf and an army green sailing coat, behind her the yard  and the silhouette of a barn with its white door and window li nings  . . . The faulty refraction of the glass, images of two overlapping  glasses that don’t meet, and the simultaneous images of mirroring  the outside and the inside all make this nine-squared window very  beautiful, dreamlike. . . . The window is beautiful because it speaks to  me. It tells me things about my self, my life. I feel it in me and it feels  important and true. It is my self-portrait at the moment. Growing plants and growing children are two important focal points of  Laura’s everyday life that she includes in her letters and finds beautiful  JAE 44_4 text.indd   52 10/14/10   1:58:33 PM </page> <page sequence="16"> Beauty in the Context of Particular Lives  53 time and again. Beautiful is that which is alive, changing, unpredictable  but continuous and thus familiar. The constancy of her children’s rhythms  that Laura is engaged in illustrates this: waking up, going to school, com- ing back, going to bed are constant and familiar events that are varied by  changing moods, thoughts, seasons, holidays, and the like. The constancy  of her plants’ rhythms that call for her attention are moving the plants from  one windowsill to another to follow the scarce light, changing pots, divid- ing plants, expecting flowers at certain times, planting seeds, slowly taking  them outside, planting the seedlings in the ground, watching them grow,  harvesting, and finally cooking something. And this is varied by changes in  weather, in the time she has to spare for gardening due to her changing em- ployment situation, the quality of seeds or soil, the amount of fertilizing—to  name but a few.40  Intertwined in her writing, Laura’s children and her plants keep  growing  as the year goes by. She writes of herself mostly as the onlooker of this  growth and change, which she finds inherently beautiful. She does write in  great detail about the tasks of taking care of her plants both inside the house  and out in the garden. She does refer to her daily tasks of taking care of the  children as well, but she downplays her role or part in their growing. She  might make a remark such as “The kids are outside. I’m doing laundry.” In  fact, she repeatedly writes about experiences of beauty when hanging laun- dry to dry.41 The growing itself—be it of plants or children—Laura merely  admires, often through a window, and attributes to inevitability.  This downplaying of one’s role in bringing about growth might first  seem as the life of someone who sacrifices herself for the good of her family  and finds herself of little value. But Laura does not describe the events of  doing laundry and tending to her children as dreary and happening out of  mere duty. In fact, she rarely makes a point of it being her that takes care of  the children and of the house. It seems as if it is not an issue for Laura but  something that happens effortlessly. She seems to enjoy and find beauty in  being a northern mother.  Laura refers often to the windows of her house. She also includes exact  directions, not only the cardinal but the half-cardinal points as well, in her  description of events. She doesn’t approach her house “from the river” but  “from the northeast side.” The windows of her house are not just windows  but windows facing north, south, east, or west. I have come to see these  two—the mentioning of windows and of directions—as signifying one and  the same thing: that is, the use of something abstract or artificial to frame  her everyday life and aid her in reflecting on it. I look out from the window at the kids running west of the house on  the Aapula fields. The sun shines from behind them as they run, the  three of them, towards the house with soap bubble holders in their  hands . . . After a while the bubbles appear behind the kitchen win- dow when the children have climbed on the stairs behind the win- JAE 44_4 text.indd   53 10/14/10   1:58:34 PM </page> <page sequence="17"> 54  Rautio dow to blow them. Bubbles fly between the stairs and the window  and reflect rounded images of both the stairs and the window. Looking out from a window presents a break in the flow of Laura’s   everyday. It is a routine as well as a conscious taking of time here and there  to  observe beauty and keep in tune with what is happening in her imme- diate surroundings. Laura makes observations through her windows. It is  tempting to suggest that windows are separating her from what is outside  of the house, running and growing free and wild; that the looking through  windows is symbolic of her being somehow confined when the world is out- side; that she is merely passively looking without engaging. But by placing  the remarks about windows in the context of the overall writing, it becomes  clear that looking through windows—and writing about it—is actually very  much an active and thoughtful act of reflection for Laura. She uses windows  and directions actively as tools or vehicles in relating to her environment as  it changes through the year. It was the blue twilight moment when the hues of the sky and the  snow are most enchanting. I turned off all the lights and took Tomi  around from one window to another. This was a chance for us to view  nature’s art exhibition in our own home. Each window portrayed a  different winter scene. Towards the yard the scene was narrower, to  south and west it opened up. No two paintings in this exhibition were  alike. Windows also hold symbolic value for Laura. She speaks of them as the  eyes of a building and writes often not just about reflections of light liter- ally but also mental reflections she engages in when looking at and through  windows. Thus, windows serve a double function as tools for Laura: they  physically frame a part of her surrounding environment and enable con- tinuous observation of changes, but they also seem to provide visual and  concrete platforms or springboards for mental reflection—even in the midst  of daily chores.  Striving for holism, as if weaving webs of significant things, is what  Laura  seems to use beauty for in her everyday life. She expresses over and over  again that beautiful things in her life are dynamic and complicated bundles  of endless connections. In her last letter, she sums up the year of writing: I feel that thinking about beauty and talking about it makes me more  sensitive to noticing it around. On the other hand I wonder why is  it so easy for me to see beauty in my surroundings? Is it because so  many beautiful things have happened to me here? Or is it because  this environment matches with my conceptions of beauty that I find  it easy to think of these surroundings as beautiful? Or have I learnt  to see certain kinds of beauty, is it all a result of learning? Or is it be- cause I’ve chosen this place to live in and I want to see it as beautiful?  I answer in my head to all of these questions “partly,” but even all  of them together don’t form a whole picture. I let it be. There might  JAE 44_4 text.indd   54 10/14/10   1:58:34 PM </page> <page sequence="18"> Beauty in the Context of Particular Lives  55 be something mystical in experiences of beauty that are best left un- touched. So be it. The levels on which Laura has reflected on beauty during this year of   correspondence are impressive. In spite of her being left with more open  questions, she finds the thinking of beauty to have made an impact on her  life. For her, it seems that beauty appears as a very personal theme and an  area in her life. It is the moments of solitude in her everyday life that seem to  make it to the pages of her letters as beautiful—her inclination to find little  slots and spaces in her everyday just for herself.  She describes over and over again little details, arrangements of objects  around her house that she has created just for her own pleasure or amuse- ment. She writes at length of her lonesome walks, the time she spends at  home when the children are at school, or the way she sets her alarm to ring  just a little too early so she can read a chapter from a book before getting  up. She writes that beauty demands time and solitude. It appears—or she  notices it—mostly when she can have a moment to herself. At the end of August I spent a day in the woods. I left after the chil- dren had left for school, biking to a forest nearby with blueberries on  my mind. Blueberries were scarce in the usual berry picking places.  I found them here and there between lingonberry leaves. I walked  around the forest all day. The day held many kinds of weather. Sun  shone brightly, through the clouds and through a haze. It was windy  all day, no sign of mosquitoes and I was wearing just enough clothes.  That’s where I walked around, looked around, smelled, listened and  tasted. Once in a while I sat on a tree stump to eat what I had packed  with me. I breathed in the forest, its lights and colours. The play of  sun in the moist twigs made the whole forest seem like a fairy tale  land coloured with green and silver. Laura is an active onlooker, a content admirer of something she possesses in  realizing that the possessing or controlling of it is impossible. She has in a  sense let go but not given up. As she puts it in one summer letter, “It is as if  I had become part of nature, left all the active observing to others and flown  with the birds, grown with the grass. That’s why all the beauty observations  have come to me through my skin, not my brain.” Tailpiece Beauty both demands time, empty spaces, and creates time in a  way—a  timescale for one’s life. By empty spaces that beauty seems to demand,  I mean literally opportunities in time and space when there are no other  pressing demands and one can just think. Such moments seem to be used as  checkpoints for one’s life course here and there. These are times in the letters  when one is driving home from work, is on an evening walk, has just sent  the kids off to school, or spends a minute walking a path from the  outside  JAE 44_4 text.indd   55 10/14/10   1:58:34 PM </page> <page sequence="19"> 56  Rautio sauna building back to the house. In educational research on  everyday   dynamics, these moments could be situated as transitions between “action  sequences.”42 Or as Erja often writes, empty spaces are there for just “being  present” in one’s life. These spaces are beautiful in themselves, and it is in  these spaces that beauty usually comes about in the letters. Beauty is used in  these spaces for contextualizing one’s life, or a moment of it, in relation to a  timescale of eternal proportions. The scale of relating one’s life in time and  space ranges from planning to go picking mushrooms next week to relating  oneself to one’s husband’s family history.  These empty spaces are like tiny steering maneuvers that we  undertake  daily but rarely notice. They are microlevel adjustments that I take as analo- gous to concepts such as Lefebvre’s “moments.”43 These constitutive mo- ments of Lefebvre are points where one is able to evaluate one’s place and  change one’s direction, to grow as a human being. They are fleeting but  decisive moments, points of rupture and sometimes even revolutionary.   Lefebvre’s moments are memorable and thus not obviously a daily occur- rence. I have concentrated on the fleeting moments of orientation that take  place in daily life but don’t quite make it to Lefebvre’s moments as they  might not stand out on their own. They might go unnoticed had I not asked  my participants to look out for them and write them down for me.  Aesthetics of the everyday is aesthetics of the ordinary. As such it is   usually set against or compared with aestheticization of the everyday as  the making of the extraordinary.44 In their letters, the participants have  both come across beauty and sought it. They have aestheticized their sur- roundings necessarily when writing of the beauty in their lives. One might  reject the dualism of ordinary and extraordinary and propose a dynamic  or dialectical relationship between the two. It is still often pointed out that  the ordinary in everyday life has received less attention than the extraordi- nary in everyday life.45 According to Haapala, aesthetics of the everyday  has fundamentally to do with an existential account of the everyday—the  lived familiar, comforting and safe.46 Paradoxically, then, the beauty of the  everyday according to his view depends on us not noticing the beauty of the  everyday. Should we shed a moment to appreciate the sunlight dancing on  the floor, let alone tell someone about it, we would aestheticize our every- day, making it extraordinary.  Katya Mandoki seeks to shed the negative tone of the term “aestheticiz- ing” by pointing out that it refers to aesthetic as a label that adds value.47  Who would not want to add value to their daily existence? In educational  research it seems crucial to embrace just the aestheticizing. Joe Winston dis- cusses human learning as a process of aligning language and world. He goes  on to argue that beauty as an evaluative concept—for Plato and  Aristotle,  as signaling desirability—aligns our valuations and desires to world in a  deeply personal and formative a manner.48 One of the participants, Laura, is  also clear on this: “Whatever I find beautiful touches something inside me.  JAE 44_4 text.indd   56 10/14/10   1:58:34 PM </page> <page sequence="20"> Beauty in the Context of Particular Lives  57 It changes when I change.” What Laura finds beautiful touches something  inside her, and it follows that what she finds beautiful then changes when  she changes. For Laura then to concentrate on what she finds beautiful in  her everyday is to concentrate also on how she herself is changing. She is  concentrating on how her desires and valuations change—in short, how she  grows as a human being. If this conscious concentrating on beauty turns  aesthetics of the everyday into aestheticization of the everyday, it is exactly  the aestheticizing that is educationally relevant.

I will use the expressions “everyday” and “everyday life” interchangeably, as  nouns, to refer to the central concept of the research: “the everyday” as a subjec- tive construct instead of an objectively definable unit; a lived-in time rather than  measured time. To avoid confusion I will use the word “daily” to refer to, for  example, the nature of an action: “Her daily chores.” Similarly, I will use “daily  life” when referring to an objectively measurable succession of days rather than  to the lived-in totality: “Escaping daily life” will then read as escaping certain  things such as commuting or doing the dishes. Finally, “everyday beauty” refers  to beauty at play in one’s lived-in everyday life totality, not (solely) to beauty in  one’s daily life.  3.

Actually, the data of my research does yield strong evidence that the participants  themselves define and understand—intuitively perhaps, and certainly not sys- tematically in their writing or thought—beauty as not a quality of an object but  of their relation to the object: “Beauty lives in the villagers, in their thoughts and  persistence . . . our beauty is not in commercial objects”; “Old and new together  are beautiful. The beauty meets within me because I appreciate both”; “It feels  healthy to think that we are different as humans and so what is obviously beau- tiful to me, is not beautiful to someone else.” It is, however, a topic of another  JAE 44_4 text.indd   57 10/14/10   1:58:34 PM </page> <page sequence="21"> 58  Rautio paper to map out participants’ intuitive theories of beauty and compare those to  existing academic lines of thought.  9.

While not initially a gendered research, due to the participants being all women  this research cannot avoid addressing gender issues. Furthermore, attitudes  around (everyday) beauty have often resulted in labeling the topic as simply  vain, naïve, or as something women appreciate and do for the lack of better  things to do (see, for example, Sontag, At the Same Time; Saito, Everyday Aesthet- ics, 152-53; Arnold Berleant, “On Getting along Beautifully: Ideas for a Social  Aesthetics,” in Aesthetics in the Human Environment, ed.

I realize the debt here to John Dewey, Democracy and Education (New York: Free  Press, 1967). According to Dewey, experience is about both trying and undergo- ing: “When we experience something we act upon it, we do something with it;  then we suffer or undergo the consequences. We do something to the thing and  then it does something to us in return: such is the peculiar combination” (144-45).  For Dewey, for there to be meaningful experiences, reflection is essential (153). 29. Scarry, On Beauty and Being Just, 30, 46. 30.

To be kept in mind is that all four participants live in very old houses, dating  back even more than a hundred years. Therefore, Saito’s argument in Everyday  Aesthetics (200) that the aged objects appreciated aesthetically are usually “spe- cial” and not in daily use does not wholly apply in this case. The participants  write of their old, squeaky, cold, small, and worn-out-looking houses and yards  as beautiful in their everyday lives. One concrete example is the tedious wash- ing of beautiful old double glass windows that you can’t open from inside. It  is true that the aged objects in everyday use by the participants still function;  were the houses, furniture, or household objects so decayed that they were unfit  to live in or to use, they might lose their appeal as beautiful or indeed become  beautiful as “special” objects. 38. Saito, Everyday Aesthetics, 28. 39. It is worth noticing that as Laura is one of only two mothers of children un- der eighteen in the village, her position is vital to the village. Thus, having and  bringing up children is not only a source of personal happiness to Laura but also  makes her a central person in the village. 40.
