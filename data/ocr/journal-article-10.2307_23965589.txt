<plain_text><page sequence="1">ONTOLOGICALONTOLOGICAL ASYMMETRY IN PHILO AND CHRISTOLOGICAL REALISM IN PAUL, HEBREWS AND JOHN It was no small matter, it was the greatest possible disturbance of things as they are when created and corruptible human nature was made [sc., by Gaius] to appear to have become deified, uncreated and incorruptible . . . for it would be easier for God to become human, even, than for a human to become God (Philo, de legatione, 118).1 Philo is interesting enough in his own right to warrant close attention. But he is also widely used to illustrate early develop ments in Christian theology, or at least to suggest the likely parameters of those developments; and especially is that so in Christology. In what follows I shall first display some examples of the use recently made of Philo by J. D. G. Dunn in his rightly influential Christology Christology in the Making.2 Dunn (and many others) argue that the 'metaphor' of the 'Logos' allows Philo to bridge the 'gulf' he is taken to believe subsists between God and all creation. I shall argue, rather, that between God and us there is for Philo neither gulf nor barrier; yet we for our part cannot reach God: there is an 'asymmetry of knowing'. I shall then argue further that there is for Philo an 'asymmetry of truth': though what we say cannot be true of God, yet we are able to speak truly of reality as we perceive it. In the next stage of my discussion I hope to show that for Philo this reality which we perceive (especially the Logos) really 'is'; it is not a a matter of 'mere metaphor'. Yet this perceived reality does not exist as God exists; there is an 'ontological asymmetry'.3 Fifthly and finally, I shall relate the conclusions I have urged to more of what Dunn says on Philo and the Logos, briefly noting possible 1 This paper was presented to the SNTS Philo seminar, Dublin, 1989. I am very grateful to its members for their generous and helpful discussion. The quotations from Philo are from the Loeb translation by F. H. Colson and others (when J. D. G. Dunn is being cited); otherwise they are my own revision of the Loeb Loeb translation. 2 Dunn, Christology in the Making (SCM. London), 1980. The recent second edition (1989) does not seem to add anything substantial to the discussion of Philo with which I am here concerned. 3 Many writers on Philo find ambiguity or paradox. I would accept David Runia's warning against 'imposing any measure of systematization on the diffuse ness of Philo's thought', (Philo of Alexandria and the TIMAEUS of Plato (Brill: Leiden, 1986), 450 n. 247). I hope that my chosen term 'asymmetry' will be seen to allow something of the complexity of Philo's thought to emerge, without forcing on it an extraneous clarity. © Oxford University Press 1990 [Journal of Theological Studies, NS, Vol. 41, Pt. a, October 1990]</page><page sequence="2">424 F. GERALD DOWNING implications for our understanding of some of the earliest develop ments of Christology. I.I. PHILO AND CHRISTOLOGY IN J. D. G. DUNN Dunn refers to Philo frequently, but especially in chapter seven, 'The Word of God'. Philo has no thought of the Logos as a real being with particular functions distinct from God . . . (227). Philo was using the Platonic conception of a world of ideas to bridge the gulf between God and creation, between God and man ... in the end of the day the Logos seems to be nothing more for Philo Philo than God himself in his approach to man, God himself insofar as he may be be known by man (228, italics original). And Dunn concludes: 'Our task in this section has been to fill out the context of meaning within which many at least of the Fourth Gospel's readers would interpret the prologue to that Gospel' (228 f.). Dunn has already used Philo in a similar way in discus sions of 'Son', 'Man', and 'Wisdom' in particular. Philo is taken as showing that it is very unlikely that early Christians would have come at all quickly to identify the risen Christ with any 'pre existent' divine figure, for 'even Philo (as one might say) did not really really believe in any such figures'.4 In the passages quoted just above, then, Dunn claims to find in Philo ideas of 'the gulf between God and creation, between God and man', 'nothing more than God himself in his approach to man, God himself insofar as he may be known to man', and 'no thought of a real being with particular functions distinct from God'. It is to what Philo himself has to say on these three issues of access, knowledge, and being that we now turn, to see whether 'asymme try' better interprets what Philo actually writes. In this discussion I shall try to follow the important advice that David Runia has urged, and indicate how the main passages of Philo to which I refer operate in their own immediate contexts (especially where the exegesis of scripture is at issue), and only then introduce passages from elsewhere in Philo.5 4 Cf.

Runia also sets Philo in a wide Neoplatonic context (Philo of Alexandria . . .).

A GULF BETWEEN GOD AND CREATION—OR SIMPLY AN ,ASYMMETRY OF ACCESS'? There seems to be nothing in Philo to correspond either word for-word or conceptually with the 'gulf that Dunn (and others) suggest.6 In fact in a whole variety of contexts Philo seems to insist on denying any such possibility. At one (and, I think, only one) point in his LCL translation F. H. Colson offers in the text the following translation 'The gulf that separates God from what comes next to him is one of kind and nature' (de sacrificiis, 92). However, in a footnote he writes, 'Literally "everything that comes after God is found to have descended by a whole genus'" (ibid.). The text he prints runs, αλλ' δλφ γένει καταβεβηκός άπαν τό μετά θεόν εύρίσκεται. There is no warrant in Philo's Greek here for importing the word 'gulf'. The context in Philo is a discussion of the embarrassment caused by God's swearing an oath in the passage of Exodus (13: 11-13) that Philo has adduced to help him comment on Gen. 4: 4 (Abel's sacrifice). Talk of God's oath, says Philo (as he often does with similar embarrassments in the text) is simply a concession to our human weakness. 'We cannot always be recalling to mind that most apt text, "God is not as human is" (Num. 23: 19), transcend ing all human conceptually' (ού γάρ δυνάμεθα διηνεκώς τό άξιον του αίτιου κεφάλαιον εν ψυχή ταμιεύεσθαι τή έαυτών, τό 'οόχ ώς άνθρωπος ό θεός' ίνα πάντα τά άνθρωπολογούμενα ύπερκύψωμεν, de de sac., 94)· Yet this discussion of the oath ascribed to God, and then of God's transcendence, in fact itself forms a parenthesis in a lengthy disquisition on God's effective providential guidance as the owner and giver of each and every gift we have (de sac., 76-97). As we shall see in further passages, God's transcendence certainly entails great difficulties for any attempt on our part to reach him. But it is precisely because he is transcendent that God 6 Drummond, Philo . . ., i. 312; L. Κ. K.

GERALD DOWNING himself can and does reach everywhere, without anything—let alone any gulf—being able to hinder him. The transcendence that precludes our reaching him is the transcendence that ensures that he reaches us. It is anthropomorphism that suggests a deity that could be limited or hindered. However we try to express Philo's thoughts about the disparities in kind between God and creation, the tempting word 'gulf is entirely inappropriate. Philo does use various Greek words that may be so translated (βαθύς, όρυγμα, χάσμα7), but he does so only in ordinary literal contexts. They never appear as metaphors for any division between God and creation, God and humanity. In fact, as already indicated, there are many settings where Philo makes a point of insisting on just the opposite. When there is any suggestion of anything that might separate God from any human (e.g. Gen. 3: 8, Num. 11: 23, etc.), Philo cites Exod. 17: 6, 'Here I am stood, before ever you had being', and tells us that it means 'He who is here is also there and everywhere, filling everything entirely and completely, leaving nothing bereft of himself' {de sacrificiis, 67 f., leg. all, iii. 4, de confusione,confusione, 6-8, 138, de migratione, 183, de somniis i. 241, ii. 221). The same point is insisted on even more emphatically in a similar setting at deterius, 150-8, on Gen. 4: 14, where Cain is suggesting that he may be hidden from God's presence (though here Philo does not cite Exod. 17: 6). So far from Philo seeking some device to bridge any gulf between God and creation, what we find is that whenever any kind of divide might seem to be suggested in scripture Philo immedi ately repudiates it, and does so in the interests of insisting on the very transcendence that talk of a 'gulf is meant by modern commentators such as Dunn to affirm. As we shall illustrate in more detail later, it is true that for Philo God is in a very strong sense inaccessible to humans (even though Philo does not talk of a 'gulf' in this connection, either). But humans are obviously not inaccessible to God, and there is quite certainly no place for Dunn's talk of 'the gulf between God and creation, between God and man'. What there is is an asymmetry of access. An aspect of this asymmetry of access is an asymmetry in knowing, and underlying that there may well be an asymmetry in being. But there is no gulf. Clearly this does leave Philo with problems for safeguarding his conviction of God's transcendence when he is talking of God's involvement in creation. But Philo has other devices than any kind of 'gulf' talk to deal with the issue, as we shall note a little later. See G. Mayer, Index Philoneus (de Gruyter: Berlin, 1974).</page><page sequence="5">ONTOLOGICAL ASYMMETRY IN PHILO 427 III.III. AN ASYMMETRY IN KNOWING? For Philo God exists in a way we humans cannot apprehend, but can only acknowledge (e.g. deterius, 160, de posteritate, 13-14, immutabilis,immutabilis, 55). Even Moses could reach no further, despite his proper reliance on God alone in his search (de fuga, 164-5, de mutatione,mutatione, 7-10). 'From his quest comes the one great benefit of comprehending that God in his being is incomprehensible to all' (deposteritate,(deposteritate, 15). Thus no human conceptuality, and certainly no human language, not even scriptural language is adequate. The best we can achieve is a negative theology, ·'God is not as human is' (Num. 23: 19); he is without quality (ποιότης), that is, without any defining characteristic (immutabilis, 53-4; cf. leg. all., i. 91, ii. 1-2, iii. 206, de legatione, 6, etc.). There thus seems no warrant for Dunn's emphatic assertion that 'the Logos is what is knowable of God God . . . God himself in so far as he may be known by man' (226, 228). God himself is not known. Besides our acknowledgment that 'he is', all we can know are his effects, and how most appropriately to respond (de posteritate, 166-9). That is all that even Scripture enables (defuga, 165, again; cf. de sacrificiis, 60). And in this sense at least we already note Philo accepting something like an 'asym metry of being': God's existence is quite other than ours, so alien that we cannot hope to comprehend it. Philo is also sure that, without betraying or diminishing or in anyway sullying his essential otherness, 'the truly existent' (τό όντως δν) achieves his purposes in the world (e.g. de gigantibus, 45). To do this the unknowable God does not need any vicegerent, anyone to deputize for him. Citing perhaps Isa. 40: 13 Philo insists it was 'with no counsellor (for who else was there?)' that God created (de opificio, 23). He needs no one else, for he can do everything himself (ibid. 46; cf. de cherubim, 77, de plantatione, 50-1, de confusione, 175, de somniis, i. 158).8 He is entirely self sufficient (leg. all., iii. 205). As we have seen, God has no need of any gap between himself and his cosmos so as to preserve his own integrity, and thus has no need to find any plenipotentiary representative to make connections for him (cf. de somniis, i. 142). Moreover, since God (and God alone) understands God, he obviously needs no human metaphors to make himself intelligible to himself (leg. all., iii. 206-7, de praemiis, 39-40). It is not only 'realist' language about divine intermediaries that would seem ruled out by such assertions. There would seem to be no warrant for using the terms even metaphorically to talk of God (or of 'what 8 Wolfson, Philo . . ii. 281 f.; cf. Josephus, Against Apion, ii. 192.</page><page sequence="6">428 F. GERALD DOWNING is knowable of God') either, for about God (as opposed to his 'effects') there would really seem to be nothing knowable but that he is. There would be nothing else to say, even in metaphor.9 Yet Scripture does try to allow us at least to articulate an appropriate response to the God we cannot hope to comprehend. It does itself use human language of God; it does (paradoxically) now talk as though 'God is as human is', as in passages such as Deut. 8: 5, 'as a father ... so God'. Philo insists: 'It is for education and instruction that such words are used, not because they are appropriate to the nature of God's being' (immutabilis, 54, Q.Q. Gen., iv. 4-8). There is no other language available, and God mercifully condescends to our human feeble-mindedness, for 'we cannot always be calling to mind that most apt text, "God is not as human is" (Num. 23: 19), transcending all human conceptuality . . . [but such talk of God is there] to help us in our weakness' (de sacrificiis,sacrificiis, 94-6, again; cf. 101 and Q. Gen., ii. 54). In the passage just quoted (and as we noted earlier) Philo is dealing with the embarrassment of finding God said to have sworn an oath. Later, in a text of Genesis in the LXX (31: 13) Philo reads '1 am the God who appeared to you in the place of God' (where 'Bethel' is translated, not transliterated). The 'God' appearing 'in the place of God' is his Word. And in much the same way, Philo goes on to say, God takes on the appearance of angels so we may be aware of his presence, in such a way that we take what represents his presence not as an image of it but as the original reality {de somniis,somniis, 232). He then ventures this bold explanation: The old story is still current that the deity goes the round of our cities resembling now one person, now another, making a tally of wickedness and law-breaking. Though the story may well not be true (και τάχα μεν ουκ άληθώς), it is still certainly to everyone's clear advantage that it goes on being told. And though [our scriptural] narrative prefers more reverent and hallowed concepts for the one who is, still it tries very hard to provide education for life for ignorant humans, and so likens the one who is to human kind (though not to any one person in particular) . . . By and large we can say that [these] two strands run through the Law code, one concerned with the truth (τό άληθές), stressing 'God is not as human is', the other concerned with the attitudes of the less intelligent, for whom there are sentiments like, 'the Lord God will discipline you as if a human were disciplining his son' {de somniis, i. 233-4, 237).10 9 Goodenough, By Light . . ., p. 64 on Philo's obvious dissatisfaction with his conceptuality. 10 On this see Runia, Philo . . ., p. 438, on κατάχρησις, the (necessary) misuse of language, with references given (de cherubim, 121, etc.), and his 'Naming and Knowing' in R. van den Broek, T.

On the place of such use in our spiritual progress, see deterius, 56, immutabilis, 116, de migratione, 174-5. See</page><page sequence="7">ONTOLOGICAL ASYMMETRY IN PHILO 429 Can we discern any more clearly, positively, and consistently the status of the talk about God, his Word and his powers that Philo accepts from Scripture and tradition? He has insisted that there is no affirmative human way truly to 'characterize' the one who is; there are even places where he says explicitly of scripture what he allows in de somniis may be the case with Homer, that the narrative is 'mythic' and literally untrue (e.g. de opificio, 154, but cf. 156; leg. all.,all., ii. 19). Yet for the most part he talks of 'the Word' and 'the powers' without further excuse. As we have noted, he is happy to take such language as directed to shaping our attitudes and conduct. But though it is not descriptive of the one who is, it does not seem for the most part elsewhere to be labelled 'convenient ethical fiction' either. It seems to be taken as genuinely appropri ate,ate, corresponding in some way to reality as we perceive it. It would not be enough to say simply that it is authoritative (though that is relevant), for Philo in effect refuses to take as appropriate anything that might seem to attempt to describe God, however firmly entrenched in authoritative Scripture. We might have to conclude that Philo is arbitrary and inconsistent. Yet we ourselves ought not simply to opt for that conclusion before we have explored all the avenues Philo opens up for us. The one solution that seems to remain to the puzzle with which Philo faces us here is as follows. When (especially with the help of scripture) we try to think about God, and/or try to respond to him, we are not left in a trackless morass of indifferently inappropriate ideas. Some are better than others, Jewish and Platonic ones in particular. They are not 'the truth'; they are not at all adequate to the truth. But they are still not as inappropriate as much current mythology or indifference (e.g. spec, leg., ii. 165-6). As we have already noted, they do genuinely articulate our response to God and our apprehension of the activity of God in the world, the effects of God on his world. But they are also true of our guided and inspired apprehension of reality as our minds move Godwards —even though our apprehension is still not the truth of the one who is. We can talk truly of our perceptions of divine reality, even though our perceptions are not themselves true to the reality of him who is. We must consider further evidence in support of this conclusion from Philo's exegesis read in context. Philo wonders why Scripture represents the Father of the also L. Κ. Κ.

GERALD DOWNING universe as saying, 'Let us make humankind in our own image, and in our own likeness' (Gen. 1: 26), when he in fact has no need of anyone to help him. God alone knows why it is said, and Philo can only offer 'by probable conjecture what seems plausible and reasonable'. He notes that the plural is only used of the creation of humans, the creation of beings capable of choosing and doing evil, when that must be hateful to God (de opificio, 72-5, cf. spec, leg., i. 329). A platonist such as Philo can only plausibly conceive of such creation at one remove.11 Scripture allows him to conceptualize things this way, and the conjecture may even represent the truth of how the creation of humans took place. It does not represent the truth of the one who is, and who needs no intermediaries. At legum allegoria, iii. 96 Philo includes in a list of recipients of God's prevenient grace, Bezeleel. Allowing his standard etymo logy of the name to suggest the word 'shadow', and without anything in the text at all obviously demanding further explana tion, he then (it seems, gratuitously) introduces a reference to God's Word as God's 'shadow'. In other contexts 'shadow' is clearly a derogatory term, a very poor second to the reality that 'casts' it (de migratione, 12, de somniis, i. 206) if not, indeed, positively misleading (de posteritate, 112, immutabilis, 177, de agricultura,agricultura, 42). Compared with God, 'the Word' is a 'mere' shadow. Philo uses the term again in his explanation of the three divine figures in Gen. 18: two are ('merely') shadows cast, and he insists, 'no one should think the shadows can be properly spoken of as God' (de abrahamo, 119-20). Yet it is by this shadowy Word that, as by an instrument, God made the world, (leg. all., iii. 96, again). This seems to mean that our conception of God's creative activity is at best a shadow of the reality of God's creativity. But it is still more true than not. It is better to conceive things so than in some other way or not at all. It is true to our best theologizing. Perhaps we should discern that the Word, though 'only' a shadow is nonetheless a 'real' shadow, provided by God for us, not a figment of our imagination, or a mere rhetorical play of our own. This certainly seems to be the import of the impressive se quence de posteritate, 13—21. Philo is discussing Gen. 4: 16, with its implausible suggestion that one can put any kind of distance between oneself and the God who has 'filled the universe with himself'. Philo considers kinds of moral and perceptual distance and closeness. Closest, of course, has been Moses. Yet Moses' request to God (Exod. 33: 13) to reveal to him his nature is noble 11 On the Platonic background, see Colson's note to de opificio, 72 ff., Philo, 475; Wolfson, Philo, ii. 272-4; Goodenough, By Light, 60-3; Runia, Philo . . 242-9; cf. Plutarch, de iside et osiride, 369 a,b.</page><page sequence="9">ONTOLOGICAL ASYMMETRY IN PHILO 431 but doomed (13, 18, 21). Moses 'entered into the darkness where God was (Exod. 20: 21), that is, into the sacred realm of formless apperception of the one who is (εις τάς άδύτους και άειδεΐς περι τοΰ δντος εννοίας, 14)12 · · · When this lover of God seeks to understand the being of the one who is ... he gains the one great benefit of comprehending that God in his being is incomprehensi ble to all. . .' (15). Our mind which can move faster than anything else we know would be bound to fall incalculably short of comprehending the Cause' (16). And yet it is precisely in this context of emphatic agnosticism, where we are intellectually far from God that Philo then reaffirms that God is 'intensely close' (έγγύτατα) to each one of us (20). We are far from him, not he from us, for he has 'filled the universe with himself through his powers . . .' 'he takes hold of us through his creative and punitive powers which exist as close neighbours to each of us . . .' (16). God is close and active, we can and do envisage his close activity; it is as close to the truth as we can get to talk of things in this way—and that is so, even though God himself still escapes us. Philo returns to the theme of our possible awareness of God towards the end of the treatise, and re-emphasizes the same point. When scripture talks of 'seeing God' it means being aware of the divine activity, the powers—and at the same time aware that God in himself is not being apprehended. 'When we say that the one who is is seen, we are not using language accurately, but are in a figure of speech transferring the reference to each of the powers respectively' (de posteritate, 166-8). We may compare 'The soul who honours the one who is with him, the one who is, alone in view ought to honour him, not irrationally or ignorantly, but with knowledge and reason. And our reasoning about him recognises (έπιδέχεται)(έπιδέχεται) partition and division into each of the divine powers and excellencies' (spec, leg., i. 209). It would not be appropriate to attempt to survey all the many (and varied) accounts in Philo's extant writings of Word, Powers, Wisdom, and so forth. Perhaps one more passage may suffice for the present purpose. At de somniis, i. 228, where he begins to deal with Gen. 31: 13, '1 am the God who appeared to you in the place of God' (see above), Philo says that scripture 'gives the title "God" to God's primal Word, not offering a grand title out of any superstitious flattery, but with the clear aim of factual accuracy' 12 In the SNTS Philo Seminar (Dublin 1989), de posteriate, 14 and mosis, i. 158 were considered at length. Is Philo hinting at an identification of Moses with the Logos as the world of undifferentiated ideas, Moses as the 'incarnation' so to speak of the Philonic Logos? Perhaps 'assimilated into' would be more apt. It is an intriguing line of thought, but it cannot be further pursued here.</page><page sequence="10">432 F. GERALD DOWNING (εν τέλος προτεθειμένος, πραγματολογήσαι (ibid., 230)). No name, not even the name 'God' is appropriate for the one who is and belongs to no genus; but it is fully appropriate to apply it to God's Word. It is here that Philo goes on to talk of God making himself like angels (έν σώματι άγγέλοις εικαζόμενο ν), so that we may have a way of envisaging his presence (ibid., 232). Angels are ideas (de somniis,somniis, 142, 147;) and ideas really exist, for Philo (spec, leg., i. 327-8). The language he uses he takes to be true to the realities we do perceive, true to beings which truly 'are'. We can know these realities, from Scripture interpreted and from experience and from Platonic and other reflection. Yet this knowledge of divine realities affords us no knowledge of the one who is really real (τό όντως όν). Time and again Philo insists no one, not even Moses, has such knowledge. And that means that the knowledge we have is not in fact knowledge of what is really real. It is true to our perceptions of reality, but not true to reality as such. We may well assume that for Philo there is a coherent and rational relationship known to God between God as Cause and all that we perceive. God is cause of all and knows and understands all (immutabilis,(immutabilis, 28-32). But there is no way in which we can trace that relationship back towards God, from effects to rationally entailed Cause, not even from our valid perceptions of his Word or his (other) powers. There is no effective analogical move from the entirely genuine knowledge we may have of our perceptions of other existent realities to the unknown ultimate reality of the one who is. 'To God alone is it permitted to know God' (de praemiis, 40). There is an asymmetry between God's total knowledge and our partial knowl edge, even though ours genuinely is knowledge of what we perceive. The conclusion is the exact opposite of that urged by Dunn. Rather than what is said of the Word being true of what we know of God while untrue of the Word (where 'the Word' is only metaphor), Philo would seem to be urging that what we say of the Word is true of the Word-—but untrue of God, of whom we know nothing save that he 'is'. There is an asymmetry between our knowledge of reality and God's knowledge of reality. It points to an asymmetry in 'being', in 'existence'. It is to Philo's understand ing of 'existence', and to possible asymmetries in existence as he understands it that we must now turn. V. AN ASYMMETRY IN BEING? The quotation from de legatione, 118 with which this essay begins does certainly, in its own immediate context, suggest</page><page sequence="11">ONTOLOGICALONTOLOGICAL ASYMMETRY IN PHILO 433 something which might usefully be termed 'an asymmetry of being': 'it would be easier for God to become human, even, than for a human to become God'.13 This could be an off-the-cuff rhetorical aside. But it turns out to be carefully prepared for (114) by a discussion using technical terms important to Philo else where, φύσις, προαίρεσις, ουσία. And the assertion does not stand alone; much the same is said briefly at de somniis, ii. 130, and at a little greater length at de mutatione, 181. So 118 is probably best taken as in fact expressing an illuminating entailment of a constant strand in Philo's thought. We may well be justified in taking it that there is an asymmetry in his understanding of how things are. I shall now try to provide further support for this tentative conclusion. Only God truly exists. It is to make this point that Moses is ordered: 'First tell the people that I am the one who is, so they may learn the difference between what is and what is not, and the further corollary that [therefore] no name can properly be applied to me to whom alone existence belongs' (mosis, i. 75; cf. deterius, 160). This sole true existence is simple, undifferentiated, in contrast with of all that is multiple, constituted by its relatedness (de(de cherubim, 114); and in total opposition to the imprecision of disorder (de posteritate, 26-31, de gigantibus, 48).14 Bringing non-being into being is a matter of bringing order out of chaos: the more orderly and unified, the nearer the result is to God's true existence. 'As the one who alone truly is he is also undoubtedly the maker, bringing into being what was not' (τά μή δντα ήγαγεν είς τό είναι, mosis, ii. 100, cf. 267). 'He called the non-existent into being: order out of disorder, distinctiveness out of indifference, similarity out of confusion, identity out of hetero geneity, shared harmony out of disjunction and discord, equality from inequality, light from darkness' (spec, leg., iv. 187, de somniis, ii. 45.15 Philo retains the Platonic concept of the 'non-existent' υλη as 'formless raw material' for creation as organization (spec, leg.,leg., i. 329), accepting the conventional axiom that nothing could come from 'pure' unbeing, 'ex nihilo' (cf. spec, leg., i. 266, de aeternitate, 5).16 God's primacy in all this is safeguarded by 13 That some ancient Greek thought could work with the idea of 'degrees of being' is obvious enough; cf., recently, D. Morrison, adding Aristotelian instances to the common Platonic ones: 'The Evidence for Degrees of Being in Aristotle', CQ,CQ, xxxvii (1987), 382-401. 14 Cf. Plutarch, de animae procreatione 1024A,c.

GERALD DOWNING making him the originator of the ideas {de opificio, 19, and leg. all., i. 22, even more emphatic). God is not simply an artificer (δημιουργός) putting independent ideas into practice, as it were, but their creator (κτίστης, de somniis, i. 76).17 But this is also in some measure to give to this formless matter a share in 'his own excellent nature' (de opificio, 21-2, de cherubim, 86; cf. de fuga, 112, of the Word). The 'non-existent' seems then to be totally undiffer entiated disorder; the only true existence is unity totally undiffer entiated (αποιος, leg. all., i. 36, 51, spec, leg., i. 48, etc.). In between come various kinds of order, and so of existence, 'real' compared with total chaos, 'unreal' compared with the inexpressi ble unity of God.18 Closest to the reality of God are the ideas which he formed. Ideas subsist in God's mind, and so are 'real' {leg.{leg. all., i. 22, spec, leg., i. 327). They are created first, as incorporeal. Then follow the sense-perceptible objects for which they are models {de opificio, 16, 130; Q. Gen., i. 19, leg. all., i. 22—3, de de somniis, i. 186-8). Through these alone can they be approached {de posteritate,{de posteritate,{de posteritate, 18-20). The real existence of the ideas themselves Philo asserts most emphatically: Some maintain that 'the incorporeal ideas' exist in name [only], in a name with no basis in fact, so doing away with the most necessary and basic reality of everything there is, the archetypal patterns . . . the holy tables of the law refer to such people as 'crushed'. Anything crushed has lost its qualities and its form, and can quite accurately be said to be nothing but formless matter; and in the same way, the argument that does away with the ideas confuses everything and reduces it to the undifferentiated and formless state it was in before any order was imposed {de spec, leg., i. 327-8).19 Human minds are 'breathed into' by God, 'stamped'20 with an impress of God himself, 'inseparable portions of the divine and blessed soul' [sc. of God]' {deterius, 86-90; cf. de opificio, 77, 135, leg.leg. all., i. 36, iii. 161). Only so can it be that they are able to escape for a while from their bodies and contemplate the underlying realities represented by the sense-perceptible universe. And be cause they are thus 'stamped' or 'in-breathed' they may indeed come to an awareness of the fact (though not the manner) of divine reality (e.g. de opificio, 143—4 de plantatione, 18-22, de fuga, 91-2, 12 Plutarch, de animae . . .1014B, de communibus . . . 1073DE. 18 Cf.

(1074D). 20 Runia argues for the precedence of 'stamped', 'God and Man . . .', 67-9.</page><page sequence="13">ONTOLOGICALONTOLOGICAL ASYMMETRY IN PHILO 435 dede ebrietate, 99). After death they may even gain unmediated awareness of that reality {de cherubim, 115, de migratione, 174-5, as above; de fuga, 100-4).21 The way we are thus constituted means that our best ideas of divine creative organization are God-given and orderly, and correspond to the divine impress or image, to the reality created and guaranteed by God. Yet even the best of these distinct ideas are still less 'real' than God, for they are themselves differentiated, and make merely relational order out of physical pluriformity. As such they are complex, 'mixed' {immut., 77) in contrast with the undifferentiated simple being of God. Compared with physical pluriformity itself they are none the less highly organized and rational, and as such 'exist' more objectively than do we. Closer to the divine reality than are we ourselves, sharing more fully in that reality, they are 'more real' than we {de cherubim, 51, de gigantibus, 61, de migratione, 193). If 'the one who is' is of his sheer goodness to share existence, to create other beings by shaping formless matter, he can only do so by first forming effective, powerful, creative ideas (powerful and creative in their own subordinate right) which are other than himself and necessarily less than himself in his undifferentiated unity, though still in some sense contained within himself (e.g. de opificio,opificio, 15—25, spec, leg., i. 329, immutabilis, 77-80, de mutatione, 27—8). As distinct ideas they are 'less real' than God, who, as we have seen, alone truly 'is'; but as his creative and effective ideas, his 'powers', they are 'more real' than what they form.22 So Philo can write of God as the 'most generic' (himself of no genus, but the supreme source of all generic orderly differentiation 'into exis tence') 'and next to him, God's Word, with everything else existing in word only, and some things so ineffectual as barely to exist at all' (or, 'in effect barely existing at all', τά δ'άλλα λόγςρ μόνον υπάρχει, έργοις δέ έστιν ού ι'σα τφ οόχ ύπάρχοντι, leg. all., ii. 86; cf. immutabilis, 77, de abrahamo, 119-23). 21 21 Dey, Intermediary World . . ■, pp. 44—6, writes as though for Philo the progress to perfect awareness were possible in this physical existence, whereas for Philo it seems that the requisite shedding of the physical was achieved only in the case of Moses (see above, n. 12, on de posteritate, 14, etc.; and Runia, 'God and Man . . 69-71). 2222 As a possible illustration from a later Platonist, Origen's peri archon i. 2: 6 appears in Jerome's Letter 124: 2 as filium, qui sit imago invisibilis patris, conparatumconparatum patri non esse veritatem; apud nos, autem, qui dei omnipotentis non possumuspossumus recipere veritatem, imaginariam veritatem videri. Rufinus' text offers a less striking contrast: quantum ad ipsum quidem patrem Veritas, quantum autem ad nos . . . imago imago est; cf. H. Goergemanns and H. Karpp, Origenes: von den Prinzipien (1976), Darmstadt, Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, 136; and compare further, R. Mortley, From Word to Silence II 100-4, on Proclus.</page><page sequence="14">436 F. GERALD DOWNING If this is an appropriate characterization of Philo's thought, we would expect him at times to stress the 'objective reality' of the divine forms, agencies and powers suggested to him by scripture and other Jewish tradition (with some prompting from Plato and from the Stoics) and at times to stress their comparative 'unreal ity': their reality in our appraisal of their effects in their impact on our minds, their unreality compared with an abstract definition of unitary divine being. And we might also expect the scriptural context of a meditation to have some part in determining which line Philo takes. Dunn looks for 'vigorous metaphorical style' (220), personifications that are to be taken as our own creative figures of speech. Philo's ontology leads him to expect divinely created and effective ideas 'more real' than are we who receive them and are formed by them. We have certainly found some of them on occasion in Philo characterized as 'unreal'; but that is only in comparison with God, not because they are 'only ideas'. As God's ideas they enjoy a very high level of real existence indeed, for Philo.23 VI.VI. DUNN AND PHILO AND THE NEW TESTAMENT We round off the discussion with a consideration of some of the passages that Dunn lists (220 f.)24, and where he allows that 'on the face of it there would appear to be little room for dispute regarding our question: Philo quite often speaks of the Logos as though a real being distinct from God, who acts as an intermediary between God and the world'. Is Dunn's preferred explanation of this in terms of 'vigorous metaphorical style' or is 'divinely created and effective ideas more real than we' the better characterization for what we find when we look below the surface of Philo's discussion? At quis haeres, 205, the first of Dunn's passages, Philo writes: To his Word, his chief messenger (archangel), highest in age and honour, the Father of all has given the special prerogative, to stand on the border 23 Cf. Runia, Philo . . ., p. 450: 'When the Logos is regarded as the "embodi ment" of God's thought focused on the cosmos . . . the difference between God and his Logos appears to be kept to a minimum, perhaps a matter of aspect rather than level . . . But when the immanent presence of the Logos is stressed . . . The Logos has to all appearances become a hypostasis, a level of God's being given real existence outside God himself.' This retains something of the tensions in Philo's thought; my formulation is designed to do more justice still to Philo. But compare also Dey, Logos . . ., 49 f. 24 In this and what follows I retain with Dunn the LCL translation. The first four of his examples he takes from Dey, Intermediary World.</page><page sequence="15">ONTOLOGICAL ASYMMETRY IN PHILO 437 and separate the creature from the Creator. This same Word both pleads with the immortal as suppliant for afflicted mortality and acts as ambassa dor of the ruler to the subject. The context in Philo is a discussion of 'dividing'. Philo uses Gen. 15: 10 as a springboard for a lengthy disquisition, adducing a variety of other texts of scripture that involve 'division'. He comes finally to the cloud which divides the Egyptians from the Israelites, but which also suggests Moses (as effective symbol of the Word of God) who 'stood between' (Deut. 5: 5), as indeed the cloud also did between God and the people. Taken literally, all the passages that Philo draws on here stress the objectivity of the phenomena experienced. Allegorized they indicate the human experience of being drawn to God by our inspired reflections and of being overwhelmed by their objective cogency, their power, while at the same time they still keep us separate from God as he really is. So, though the reality of God is always other, 'divinely created and effective ideas' seems nearer the mark than 'lively metaphorical style'. Philo can also talk of the Word as 'interpreter and spokesman [prophet] of God' (immutabilis, 138, the fourth of Dunn's pas sages). The section began with Gen. 6: 1, 'the earth was corrupt before the Lord, and filled with inquity', and Philo is drawn to reflect on human experiences of being mastered instead by [good] conviction, as objective as the onset of leprosy. This good convic tion that we experience as entering us from outside is the divine Word, before whom we passively 'conceive', the matter as little in our own hands as was the inspiration of a prophet in scripture. The stress is again on the reality of what comes to us in such experience. To suggest that all this was for Philo simply our metaphorical imagining would be to misrepresent what he wrote. The Word is also 'ruler and steersman of all' (de cherubim, 36, Dunn's fifth example). Philo has been asking what the tale of the cherubim with the flaming swords should be taken as signifying. Again, a picture presented in scripture as objective suggests reflections on experiences that come to us, rather than inventions of our own. A little earlier Philo has recounted some particularly vivid thoughts: But there is a higher thought than these. It comes from a voice in my own soul which oftentimes is god-possessed and divines where [what?] it does not know . . . This voice told me that while God is indeed one, his highest and chief powers are two, even Goodness and Sovereignty. Through his Goodness he begat all that is, through his Sovereignty he rules what he has begotten. And in the midst, between the two there is a third which unites them, the Word; for it is through his rational Word that God is both ruler and good {de cherubim, 27-8; cf. de sacrificiis, 119).</page><page sequence="16">438 F. GERALD DOWNING 'Ruler' and 'steersman' are metaphors created by us, though Philo finds them very appropriate. What they refer to, the Word through whom God rules, is a reality given and guaranteed by God. Dunn quotes further, as his seventh example, This hallowed flock [the heavenly bodies] he leads in accordance with right and law, setting over it his true Word (orthon logon) and firstborn Son, who shall take upon him its government like some viceroy of a great king (de agricultura, 51). Noah's work as a planter has suggested other land-workers, among them shepherds and cattlemen; the latter then indicate to Philo our vices, the former our experience of self-control, leading to reason and virtue (e.g. 44). For this shepherding the disciplined regular ity of the physical universe is the most impressive and obvious enacted example, encouraging us to accept God's own shepherd ing of our souls (53). 'Shepherding' and 'flock' are clearly meta phors. The Word is no more metaphor for Philo than are the sun or the moon. Another sequence chosen by Dunn, his eighth, refers to 'God's firstborn, the Word, who holds the eldership among the angels, their ruler as it were . . .' (de confusione, 146). It comes in a passage where Philo is contrasting man-made polytheism (exemplified by the 'sons of men' who built the tower of Babel) with the objective, given knowledge of (the existence of) the One God, whose accep tance makes us instead 'sons of God'. Especially in the light of the stated contrast we would expect a realistic treatment of that to which our 'knowledge' corresponds. In fact Philo continues: 'If we have not yet become fit to be thought sons of God, yet we may be sons of his invisible image, the most holy Word' (147). The Word is the real object of our awareness, really shaping our minds for an awareness of God—and as really reminding us that God himself is beyond our comprehension. Of him we can only know that he is.25 25 The relation to Philo's original of the passages from Questions and Answers on Exodus Exodus and on Genesis included by Dunn are too unsure for us to build much on them, and warrant only a brief footnote. Q. Exod. ii. 13, the Word as judge, mediator, angel, is explicitly linked to the exigencies of sense-experience (ibid.), as is the next passage cited, ii. 94, on the Word as veil but also as that which enables our seeing. Q. Gen. ii. 62, the last of Dunn's nine passages, expresses very clearly (though some of its language is unparalleled elsewhere) Philo's conviction that there is available to us a God-given reality, truer to God than anything else, and therefore 'real'·—though still not adequate to the truth of the one who is, 'existing in the best and special form' (ibid.): 'the second God, who is his Word'. Dunn also chooses from de sacrificiis, 119 'It is reason (λόγος, Word) which has taken refuge with God'. But in fact here Philo is talking about reason as it is experienced in ourselves, 'the sovereign part of the soul'; and though that is continuous in some way with divine Reason, the passage is not directly relevant to the discussion.</page><page sequence="17">ONTOLOGICAL ASYMMETRY IN PHILO 439 In these contexts the Word and other 'powers' impress them selves on us as very real (to repeat, 'more real' than we are). In other settings, as we have already seen, Philo insists that God alone exists in the truest sense (or perhaps God's Word does, too, in some strong sense). The scriptural contexts of these latter passages deploy anthropomorphisms which present Philo with an apologetic problem. They lead him to stress the precise opposite, with the help of his tag, 'God is not as human is'. Scripture's vivid 'metaphorical' language makes Philo most aware of its inadequacy. That metaphorical language is a concession to our weakness. Talk of God's Word and God's powers is other than such metaphor.26 The conclusions argued by Dunn among others seem now widely off target. The Logos is real, because it/he is less distinct from God than any other reality of which we can conceive. But because our conception of the Logos (itself God-given) does match in some measure the reality of the Logos the Logos must be conceptually distinguishable from God, for us to be capable of conceiving of him at all. Thus the Word is both distinguishable from God and real, certainly more real than any metaphorical imaginings of our own, for he/it is more real than we ourselves. Dunn argues that it is only at the end of the first century ce that the idea of 'pre-existent' divine figures became available (260). But if Philo is taken as a clue to possible early Christological specula tion, he must also be allowed to encourage us to suppose that some people at the time, Jews very much included, would have been readily convinced of the possibility of a real transcendent figure (or figures) as a link between themselves and God, and so, much readier for a 'pre-existent' Christ than Dunn allows. (At the same time they would most likely be much more agnostic about all theological language than are Dunn and many contemporaries in this ingenuously kataphatic age, with its ready talk of 'knowing God' and of 'God's self-revelation'.) Whether Paul and the members of his congregations in particu lar are to be thought likely to have moved in such intellectual circles cannot be argued here. We simply point again to the fact that Philo is widely cited to establish some of the parameters for our understanding of Christian thinking. He may of course represent only some Alexandrian Jewish thought. Yet it is worth noting that Paul does seem to use quite naturally and without explanation some of the common presuppositions of this theology (the 'prepositional metaphysics', the phrase τά μή όντα, the 26 So, for example, compare immutabilis, 55 with 51, in context; de fuga, 164-5 with 162; de mutatione, 7-10 with 1; de posteritate, 14 with 1-9. Cf. also A. Segal, Two Powers in Heaven (Brill Leiden, 1977), 161.</page><page sequence="18">440 F. GERALD DOWNING discounting of our present knowledge of God, along with other oddments of popular philosophy).27 It seems to be very important to Dunn to be able to argue that the early Christians did not simply pick up from the culture around ideas of transcendent figures linking humanity and God, but developed them for themselves (258-61). 'Christian faith . . . may have to be credited with much or most of the stimulus which resulted in this new breakthrough in religious thought' (261). A closer study of Philo suggests that there was in some quarters already a body of careful reflection along these lines, whether or not it was known in any form to Paul or 'John' or the author of Hebrews.28 F. Gerald Downing F. Gerald Downing 27 'Prepositional metaphysics' Rom. 11: 36, 1 Cor. 8: 6, cf. Eph. 4: 6, Heb. 2: 10; τά μή δντα, Rom. 4: 17, 1 Cor. 1: 28, cf. Heb. 11: 3; the discounting of human knowledge of God, 1 Cor. 8: 1-3, 13: 12. 28 Even the extent to which the early Christians were distinctive in addressing prayer to a second transcendent figure, as argued recently by L. W. Hurtado, in his One One God, One Lord, remains very debatable. Although his book has the commenda tion of A. Segal on its cover, it is difficult to see how Hurtado makes a case for a distinctive Christian address of prayer to a divine figure other than God, in the light of for instance Segal's own Two Powers, ch. 6, on 'Mishnaic Prohibitions against unorthodox Prayer'. But I also note in Philo de somniis, i. 163-4, where Philo clearly takes the LXX ευχή, εδχομαι as 'prayer', addressed to the Word; and compare de abrahamo, 127 in the light of what precedes it (God accepts approaches to himself made in terms of (mistaken) address to his shadowy Powers, and with this Q. Gen. 4: 8) and negatively, eg. de gigantibus, 54 (worship truly directed to the Existent is very rare indeed). R. Williamson, Philo, 116, notes that at de somniis, i. 164 Philo seems to address Moses in prayer; but this may rather be a rhetorical apostrophe.</page></plain_text>
