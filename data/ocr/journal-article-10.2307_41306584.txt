Warner Abstract In this article I shall examine the interrelationship between lifecycle ritual, in the form of disposal of the unclean dead, and certain agrarian concerns and rituals of the Russian rural community relating to the early summer and, more specifically, to the Whitsun period. In so doing I hope to shed some further light on a puzzling belief; namely that the interment, both in consecrated ground and in earth generally, of the unclean dead could cause drought and other adverse weather conditions. Documented since the thirteenth century, this belief persisted among the East Slavs until the early part of the twentieth century and often led to the desecration of grave-sites. Introduction Beliefs and practices associated with the unclean dead were first extensively investigated by D. K. Zelenin in his monograph on the victims of premature, unnatural death, in particular drowned girls who, in folk mythology, become water nymphs ( rusalki ) (Zelenin 1916). Part of his monograph was devoted to the relationship between drought and peasant attitudes to unclean corpses and offered many interesting theories but no conclusive answers. After Zelenin's work, little more was written on the subject until, in the second half of the twentieth century, there was a renewed interest among Russian folklore researchers in pagan beliefs and rituals. As far as the subject of this paper is concerned, two scholars in particular must be mentioned. In the 1970s and 1980s, N. I. Tolstoi and S. M. Tolstaya once again drew attention to Slavonic beliefs about the causes of drought, including the malign influence of unclean corpses, in articles based on their fieldwork in the Poles'e, an area spanning parts of Ukraine and what is now Belarus (see, for example Tolstaya 1986; Tolstoi and Tolstaya 1978, 1981). Among the supposed causes of drought identified by the authors, the burial in consecrated ground of unclean dead, specifically suicides and the drowned, played a significant part. Further information, including an extensive bibliography on the wider subject of drought and rain, and in particular rain-making rituals, covering all the Slavonic territories, may be found in the ethno-linguistic dictionary Slavyanskie drevnosti (see Tolstaya 1999a, 106-11; 1999b, 275-6).

Warner "Clean" and "Unclean" Dead From the earliest times a central place in the traditional Russian worldview was occupied by a cult of ancestors, aspects of which still survive today. As in many other cultures, the dead were divided into two broad categories, "clean" and "unclean." In the first group were those who died naturally in old age. Their death was attended with rituals designed to ensure a safe and permanent passage into the "other" world of the dead including, in Christian times, confession of sins and absolution by a priest. Cleansed spiritually and physically, their bodies were laid to rest in holy earth. Their presence there was regarded by the agricultural community as beneficial. In springtime, when the earth warmed up, they supposedly stirred from their long winter sleep and helped the crops to grow. The second group contained those who, for whatever reason, died an unnatural death. They died a "death that was not their own" ( ne svoeyu smert'yu); that is, before the expiry of their allotted time. The group was extremely diverse, including, for example, victims of plague, accident or murder, vagrants who died anonymously far from home and, worst of all, suicides. People who drank themselves to death or drowned were also objects of dread, as were those suspected of witchcraft. Christian notions of mortal sins reinforced pre-existing prejudices. The burial of unclean dead, according to popular belief, far from helping the agriculturalist, might harm crops and produce famine. Mother Moist-Earth A significant factor in the Russian agriculturalist's attitude to the appropriateness or otherwise of inhumation was respect for the sanctity of Mother Moist-Earth, a pre-Christian personification of the life-giving properties of earth. Even in the nineteenth century, many spells, ritual acts and customs reflected a desire to protect, propitiate and thank earth during the performance of everyday agricultural tasks. Underground, in the villages of the dead, the positive relationship between earth and her beneficiaries continued. The association of burial in earth with the "clean" dead was strengthened by the Christian practice of burial in consecrated ground. Orthodox and pagan views of the earth coincided to produce the conviction that these dead must be buried in earth. In Russian peasant society, being prevented, for whatever reason, from burying one's dead in earth was a tragic event. Equally strong was the conviction that the earth must not be polluted with the bodies of those who met an untimely end. According to many legends, the earth rejects them, returning their coffins back to the surface. Harmful Acts of those who Died a "Death that Was Not Their Own" According to the accepted spatial equilibrium, the living occupied the surface of the earth while the bodies of the "clean" dead occupied the space beneath. The corpses of the unclean dead, on the other hand, lay uneasily underground or regained a half-life as revenants. They provoked nightmares, destroyed property, and caused sickness and death in both humans and cattle. They were blamed for catastrophic climate changes, stormy winds, frost and especially drought. A Chronicle entry for 1092 describes how the people of Polotsk were struck down by a mysterious illness one night after a host of demons galloped in on horseback.</page><page sequence="3">Russian Peasant Beliefs Concerning the Unclean Dead and Drought 157 When the demons came back again in daylight they were invisible, but the hoof- prints of their horses could be seen. The people of Polotsk said the dead had come to attack them. Clearly, these were no ordinary dead but unclean dead who had dealings with demons. They may have been suicides who, according to folk belief, become horses for devils to ride ( chertov kon'). In that same year of 1092, wrote the Chronicler, there was drought so severe that the earth shrivelled and forests burst into flame of their own accord (Adrianova-Peretts 1950, vol. 1, 342). An eye- witness account of similar problems supposedly caused by the unclean dead was given by Isaac Massa, a Dutch merchant and diplomat, resident in Moscow at the time of the assassination of the so-called False Pretender Dmitrii in 1606. In addition to the premature nature of his death, Dmitrii was a traitor suspected of sorcery and in league with heretic Catholics. He was denied Christian burial. Details of what happened to his corpse vary but according to Massa his body was flung into a pit. During the night following his death there was a hard and un- seasonal frost that, for a distance of twenty miles around Moscow, shrivelled all plants, from shoots of wheat to the tops of evergreen trees. It looked as though they had been damaged by fire (Obolensky and Van der Linde 1866, 186 and 188). Other reports make clear that the body was flung into the communal burial-pit of a paupers' graveyard but the deep snow and blizzards which followed led contemporaries to conclude the earth would not accept his body, after which the corpse was burned and the ashes scattered on the wind (Snegirev 1826, 250). In order to combat the negative influence of those who died violently and prematurely, a number of measures were taken. Apotropaic Acts to Protect the Natural World from the Unclean Dead Alternative Forms of Disposal The bodies of unclean dead were often taken far from human habitation and abandoned in fields, forests, swamps and ditches, remote places, which were not part of the "safe" environment that ordinary folk regarded as their "own" world. This practice survived for centuries after the Christianisation of Russia and in spite of frequent condemnation by the Orthodox Church. Less understandable, perhaps, was the exhumation of bodies regarded as improperly buried and the disposing of them again elsewhere, a practice that continued into the twentieth century. In 1515, Maxim the Greek, a scholar invited to Moscow to help with the reform of church books, was horrified when he witnessed the victims of murder and drowning being exhumed, dragged into the open countryside and left upon the ground since, according to Maksim, it was man's sinfulness rather than inappropriate burial that would cause the land to be infertile with "heavy frost and lack of rain" (Petukhov 1888, 175). D. K. Zelenin cites around thirty precisely-documented examples of such exhumations, some of which concerned more than one corpse (Zelenin 1916, 66-76). These mostly took place in the latter half of the nineteenth century in the upper and lower Volga regions and in some south Russian provinces. There were also cases from what is now Ukraine. Zelenin found no examples from north Russian provinces, possibly because drought was less common there. In addition, Zelenin referred to another five examples of a more general nature.</page><page sequence="4">158 Elizabeth A. Warner The exhumed bodies described by Zelenin were treated in different ways; a suspected witch was burnt, two bodies were flung into a ravine in the forest, one was cut into pieces, another corpse had its legs chopped off. The last two actions were clearly intended to stop the corpses from walking again. However, in the vast majority of cases water played a significant part in the re-disposal process. The exhumed remains were thrown into rivers, lakes, ponds, swamps and other damp places. Alternatively, water was poured over the corpse or into the original grave-pit. I have found examples similar to those described by Zelenin in eparchial enquiries into the misconduct of priests accused of complicity in such sacrilegious behaviour. These events took place in 1799 and were recorded in what is now Ukraine. The priests were Orthodox and subject to the jurisdiction of the Orthodox Church. In Sinitse, Uman' uezd, the priest was said to have scattered holy water over the grave of a drowned man. Later, local people opened the grave and poured holy water over the uncovered body (Central State Archive of the USSR, fond 796, opis' 80, ed. khr. 976, list 13-14). In two other instances the sinister corpses were accused of causing disease rather than drought. In the village of Spirodonovka, Radomyshl' uezd, people were convinced that a recently-buried man visited his wife and other villagers, who had fallen ill. They intended to exhume the body and burn it but when the corpse was revealed they managed to persuade their priest to pour four buckets of holy water over it in order to stop it walking (Central State Archive of the USSR, fond 796, opis' 80, ed. khr. 976, list 78-9). In the village of Novoselitse, Zvenigorodka uezd, the priest agreed to hold a mass and lead a procession to the graveyard from which, so it was said, several corpses habitually rose from their coffins to cause disease in the population. The priest sprinkled holy water round the cemetery, while some of the peasants uncovered the graves and poured into them water believed to have particular healing properties, saved from the "Blessing of the waters" ceremony at Epiphany (Central State Archive of the USSR ,fond 796, opis' 80, ed. khr. 976, list 13-14). Orthodox Funeral Rites for and Commemoration of the Unclean Dead at Semik and Troitsa Inhumation of the dead, accompanied by the appropriate funeral service and followed at certain times by commemorative acts and prayers for the departed soul, was and remains the normal practice of the Orthodox Church. The deceased is commemorated on the third, ninth and fortieth days after death and upon its anniversary. The Church also recognises a number of special days set aside for the remembrance of all the faithful dead, on which Universal requiems are held. One of the most important of these is the Saturday preceding Trinity Sunday (Troitsa). It was and is considered essential that the dead as well as the living should participate in the saving grace of the Holy Spirit, which, according to Christian tradition, descended to Christ's disciples at this time. This requiem mass, therefore, refers comprehensively to every imaginable form of death. It mentions those who died by any kind of violence or accident - "those who were burnt by lightning or died by frost, or of any wound," "those who became the food of wild beasts and birds and serpents," and so on (Bulgakov 1993, vol. 1, 673). By the nineteenth century, virtually the only category of dead excluded from such remembrance were suicides of sound mind.</page><page sequence="5">Russian Peasant Beliefs Concerning the Unclean Dead and Drought 159 Nevertheless, in the past, those who had died suddenly, without confession and absolution, clearly presented the Church with a problem. Was burial in consecrated ground appropriate for these people or not? Furthermore, as we have seen, many ordinary folk regarded burial for such unfortunates as unacceptable and even dangerous. This led to the institution of special disposal sites, the so-called ubogie doma (lit. paupers' houses), situated in isolated, unhallowed ground, sometimes close to a river or hidden among groves of trees. Accounts dating back to early mediaeval times show that large numbers of unclaimed cadavers - plague victims, suicides, vagabonds, casualties of the harsh climate, of drunken brawls and the footpad's knife - ended up in these places. Samuel Collins, for example, an English doctor who spent nine years in Moscow at the court of Tsar Aleksei Mikhailovich in the latter part of the seventeenth century, wrote of the hundreds of drunks who froze to death on the streets of Moscow during one Shrove week alone and of the sledges he saw bearing their bodies, some with faces and arms gnawed off by dogs, on their journey to the ubogii dom (Collins 1671, 23). There, corpses were cast into a large pit, covered over with quicklime and left until Semik, the Thursday before Troitsa, when a communal funeral mass was held. On this day, charitable Christians would at last cast earth over the open pits and say prayers for the souls of those abandoned there. One of the earliest references to this custom dates to the second half of the fifteenth century and concerns the burial of vagabonds. It mentions that in Moscow at this time people also brought candles and dishes of food traditionally served at funerals. After filling in the old pit they would dig a new one, all as an act of Christian charity (Solov'ev 1959-65, vol. 5, Bk. 3, 212). In the larger towns a grand procession of clergy and "mourners" would make their way to the ubogii dom, with icons and religious banners, followed by a crowd of the indigent, who, after the mass, would receive a generous donation of alms, ostensibly for "remembrance" of the dead souls (Bulgakov 1993, vol. 1, 673). Beggars and vagrants had a specific function in relation to funeral custom. Living on the fringes of society, often with no fixed abode, they were regarded as liminal beings, whose travels on the road had both a material and a symbolic meaning. Through gifts of food and clothing the charitable were, by proxy, feeding and clothing the dead (for further information, see Levkievskaya 2004, vol. 3, 408-11). The ubogie doma were officially closed by an edict of Catherine the Great in 1771, although they survived into the mid nineteenth century in parts of north Russia. Semik was also a time for welcoming the advent of summer and the flourishing of vegetation. Enthusiastic celebrations often followed the gruesome activities of the devout at the mass graves. Before the closure of the ubogie doma in Moscow, according to I. M. Snegirev, those who had assisted in the disposal of the indigent would then wash their hands in the river Samotek and proceed to Mar'ina grove for the Semik festivities (Snegirev 1837-39, vol. 3, 102). By the nineteenth century, in the towns at least, Semik had become largely a secular festival, although requiem masses were still sometimes held in cemeteries or on sites where ubogie doma had previously stood. On these occasions, musicians and vendors of sweets competed with the officiating priest for the attention of the crowds. Significantly, the dark side of unnatural death was thus confronted with the joy of being alive and of new life awakening in the natural world.</page><page sequence="6">160 Elizabeth A. Warner Ritual Games Parodying Funerals and Corpse Disposal at Setnik and Troitsa Throughout the year, the presence in Russian calendar ritual of a death theme is very striking. However, it is in the period beginning around Troitsa and continuing up to the Peter Fast ( Petrov post), a period which, depending on the date of Easter, falls roughly between the first two weeks of May and the first two weeks of June, that we find the most intense preoccupation with the staging of mock funerals. These included the "funerals" of Semik and Kostroma (Kostrubon'ka in the Ukraine) and the "send-off" ( provody ) or "funeral" of the rusalki, accounts of which mostly date to the nineteenth century and early part of the twentieth century Common to these ritual games was the presence, alongside the "solemnity" of the occasion, of seemingly inappropriate behaviour - laughter, erotic undercurrents or excessive eating and drinking. In his comprehensive and authoritative analysis of Russian agrarian ritual, Russian Agrarian Festivals ( Russkie agrarnye prazdniki), Vladimir Propp (1963) concluded that the "death" of anthropomorphic figures such as Semik and Kostroma was part of a ritual designed to increase the productive forces of the land. Death was to be followed by resurrection not in person, as in religions based on the death or sacrifice of gods or spirits of fertility, but in the grasses and grains of the future harvests. Laughter and merriment were seen by Propp as part of this life-generating process (1963, 95-7). Undoubtedly, the ritual funerals have some connection with fertility but perhaps not in the way Propp imagined. The "funerals" of Kostroma and Semik Details of the funeral games vary. However, there are certain common features. The action concerns an anthropomorphic figure, male or female. The role of the main protagonist may be taken by a real person or by an effigy made of straw, reeds or cloth. The figure is either dead from the outset or sickens and dies during the game. Sometimes a mock funeral with "mourners," "lamenters" and a mock priest is enacted. The performance ends with the disposal of the "dead" body, which rarely takes the form of a burial. In one nineteenth-century version from the village of Klimovo, Murom uezd, the body of Kostroma, played by a young girl, was abandoned in its coffin under a birch tree in the forest (Shein 1898-1900, vol. I, Part 1, 370). V. N. Yastrebov described a children's game in which a little boy playing the part of the deceased Kostrubon'ka was dumped in a ditch by the side of a field (Yastrebov 1894, 33-5). In the majority of cases, however, disposal took place in water - a pond, river, lake or swamp. As can be seen, there is a strong similarity with the methods of disposal traditionally used for the unclean dead. The immersion of the body in water is particularly significant. One detailed nineteenth-century description of the death and funeral of Kostroma contains several references to the use of water: "Suddenly, from somewhere or other, there appears a huge tub of water which, just as if a funeral rite is being performed, is quietly poured over the dead Kostroma." Later, her body is placed upon a litter and carried to a nearby pond where it is thrown into the water (Skvortsova 1892, 119). One of the nineteenth-century variants of the "funeral of Kostroma" from Murom uezd described by P. V. Shein includes a song obviously intended as a rain-charm: "... A lovely maiden was carrying water, she</page><page sequence="7">Russian Peasant Beliefs Concerning the Unclean Dead and Drought 161 asked for rain: 'God, create some rain, heavy rain, to soak the grass . . . (Shein 1898-1900, vol. 1, Part 1, 370). Some versions of the "funeral of Kostroma" are accompanied by songs containing suggestions that hers was both an untimely and a violent death. According to one song she was the pretty daughter of a merchant, a "good-time girl" (" gul'livaya"), who died after overindulging in alcohol laced with an opiate (" vina s makom nalizalas'"); indeed, she was possibly murdered through this overdose. As they cast her body into the water, her former playmates sing: "Off she goes, to the demon, into the forest, headfirst into the deep pool" (Shein 1898-1900, vol. 1, Part 1, 370). Here, there is a clear reference to two demonic figures closely associated with the unclean dead - the wood demon ( leshii ), who enticed people to their death in the forest and the water demon ( vodyanoi ), who lived in the deep, dangerous pools on the river and who was keeper of the drowned. Of particular interest is the description of the "funeral of Semik" performed in an unnamed village in Nizhegorod government in the 1850s. Men were excluded from the ritual, except as occasional spectators. The actors were young girls. A suitable house was chosen for the activities four weeks before Semik. Here, the girls lived on their own until Semik, busying themselves with female tasks, such as spinning. Food was either donated by relatives and well-wishers or stolen from unguarded cellars and larders by the girls. Feasting, with enthusiastic consumption of food and beer, began at Semik and lasted three days. On the eve of Trinity Sunday a straw effigy representing the defunct Semik was made and dressed in old, worn men's clothing. The following morning the body was carried on a litter, without a coffin, by four girls, preceded by one of their number dressed as a priest and followed by another carrying an old birch-bark sandal tied to a piece of string, which she waved about like a censer. Meanwhile Semik's "mother" keened over the dead body. The procession ended at a ravine over which Semik's body and the litter were quickly thrown (V.S. 1862, 118-20). The seriousness with which the participants prepared for this event, its extensive and detailed nature, and the presence of many archaic, ritual features (the exclusion of men, the purloining of food, the lack of a coffin), all suggest that this was no ordinary game but a structured ceremony with a purpose other than mere entertainment. Also noteworthy is the fact that the effigy was dressed in old clothing, contravening the accepted practice of providing a corpse with white, new, or at least clean garments. The dressing of the effigies in these funeral games took different forms. Flowers, ribbons or beads were often added to the clothing of female effigies: "The effigy (of Kostroma EAW) is dressed in a sarafan and shirt, a scarf is tied on her head and she is decorated with flowers. Shoes are placed on her feet" (Shein 1898-1900, vol. 1, Part 1, 369). Sometimes even new garments were specified: "They take a sheaf of straw, dress it in a new sarafan and headscarf and hang ribbons and flowers upon it" (Shein 1898-1900, vol. 1, Part 1, 370). The appearance of these "dead" female dolls carries echoes of the way in which the corpses of young, unmarried females were laid out in real life and provides a link between them and the mock funerals of the rusalki. However, references to well-worn or tattered garments may also be found in a number of descriptions of the games: "At Troitsa or on the Day of the Spirit ( dukhov den') young lasses, who had put on their shabby, work-a-day dresses (in spite of</page><page sequence="8">162 Elizabeth A. Warner the fact that Troitsa was a major festival EAW), would gather in a certain place and choose from their number one girl, whom they called Kostroma ..." (Snegirev 1837-39, vol. 3, 134). In one solemn procession that attended the coffin of Kostroma on its way to the nearby river, the participating women and girls wore white headscarves as a sign of mourning, while all the youths dressed themselves in sackcloth ( rogozha ) (Shein 1898-1900, vol. 1, Part 1, 369). It is perhaps not without interest in this context to remember that sackcloth, the garment of destitution and self-abasement, was worn by penitents, as, for example, on Ash Wednesday at the beginning of Lent. As the cheapest and crudest kind of fabric, it also made clothing for the poorest of the poor, the beggars, who were traditionally present during the funerals for the unclean dead at the ubogie doma. The participants in one ritual game in particular, the so-called "farewell to spring," which took place in Simbirsk, Penza and Kostroma governments on the eve of the Peter fast, explicitly reflect in their dress those unlucky creatures who often ended up in the common grave-pits of the charnel houses. A straw effigy was made, which, according to I. P. Sakharov, represented spring, and this would be accompanied on its final journey to the nearby river by a crowd of villagers dressed in "tattered old clothing, representing the lame, the mutilated, the crippled, the blind, and beggars" (Sakharov 1841-49, vol. 2, Book 7, 93). From all the above, I would suggest that the mock funeral-games of the Semik/Troitsa period are closely related to the Semik communal funerals for the nameless dead. They provided another way of offering closure to these victims of fate but at the same time they were apotropaic acts whose purpose was to protect the agriculturalist from the destructive powers of the unclean dead and, in particular, to ward off drought and the famines that followed. People taking part were well aware that their actions were far from innocent, and the clergy condemned them outright as sinful and blasphemous, and warned the peasants that taking part in any Semik play-acting of this kind would actually produce terrible catastrophes, such as famine and crop failure (Shein 1898-1900, vol. 1, Part 1, 370-1). This is clearly a later Orthodox rationalisation, a reversal of the original popular belief regarding the harmful activities of the unclean dead. The "funeral," or "send-off" (provody) of the rusalki Rusalki are complex, ambiguous creatures who appear in the beliefs, rituals and folk narratives of the East Slavs. They dwell in water, on river-banks, and in the forest adjoining rivers and lakes, and are considered to be the wraiths of girls and young women who have died by drowning. Some believed that women who hanged themselves, babies who died before baptism, babies smothered by their mothers and children cursed by their parents could also become rusalki. Since the publication of D. K. Zelenin's work on unnatural death and the rusalki, it has become axiomatic in Russian scholarship to categorise them as a sub-division of the unclean dead. Although the rusalki may adopt various guises in folk tales and beliefs, they are usually envisaged as beautiful young girls. South Russian and Ukrainian legends in particular depict them as alluring maidens dressed only in a loose, white shift. They have pale faces and long, unbraided hair that they comb on the river-banks on moonlit nights. Such details show their relationship to the world of the</page><page sequence="9">Russian Peasant Beliefs Concerning the Unclean Dead and Drought 163 supernatural and the dead. Russian women wore their hair braided and covered. An uncovered head was associated with the sorceress, the "bare-headed woman" (baba prostovolosaya), loosened hair and unbelted garments were signs of limen. Women keening by a graveside, for example, or the corpse of a young virgin laid out for burial, might be seen with loosened hair. The rusalki, it was believed, could be a danger to those who ventured carelessly into water, such as by bathing without first making the sign of the cross. Rusalka week, which, depending on geographical location, could follow or precede Semik, was also the time when the rusalki supposedly came onto dry land, entering the villages and surrounding fields. At the end of this week the peasants rid themselves of their unwanted presence in ritual games similar to the "funerals" of Kostroma, Semik and other anthropomorphic figures. Sometimes a doll was made to represent a rusalka. P. V. Shein provides a particularly vivid account of one such occasion on the eve of the Peter fast in Mikhailov uezd, Ryazan' government, towards the end of the nineteenth century. The rag doll was realistic in appearance with nose, eyes, mouth and hair. It was dressed in a frock, while flowers were placed beside it in the coffin. The girls participating in the game took on the role of priest, deacon and sexton and the funeral procession made its way to the river bank, where the doll's hair was combed loose and the lid nailed on the coffin. This was then lowered into the water, weighted down with stones (Shein 1898-1900, vol. 1, Part 1, 367). The explicitly funereal nature of the above description, however, was unusual for games concerning the rusalki, whose "remains" were usually disposed of in a more rough and ready way. The doll might be torn up, the pieces scattered in a field beyond the village (Snegirev 1837-39, vol. 4, 11), or flung into a ditch beside a field (Grinkova 1947, 179). M. E. Sokolov describes a "funeral" of the rusalka from Samara government, dating to 1899, in which the "dead" doll, made from a sheaf of rye, is carried on a stretcher by old women to the boundary strip between the rye fields (Sokolov 1909, 24). These boundary strips were regarded as "unclean" places. Whether in water or by other means, however, the similarity to the methods of disposal of the unnatural dead is obvious. More often the role of the rusalki was performed by local girls, who would lurk in and around the village, dressed in white, bare-headed, and with their hair loose about their shoulders, until the time came to chase them out. This was achieved at the end of rusalka week, when a noisy crowd would gather, shouting, cracking whips or banging loudly on metal objects. The rusalki tried to catch and tickle unwary bystanders but they were eventually driven out into the surrounding countryside. In some south Russian and Belorussian sources, the rusalki are associated with fields of young rye, where they reputedly gathered to play during rusalka week and where the ceremony of sending them off often ended. According to Vladimir Propp, like other calendar rituals at Shrove and Troitsa, the funeral of the rusalki may be regarded as a fertility rite, designed to ensure the growth of crops (Propp 1963, 77 and 81). There is, however, considerable evidence that the presence of the rusalki in crop fields was mostly regarded as undesirable by the peasants. In one of the versions of the funeral of the rusalka referred to by Propp, the participants certainly mentioned the importance of conducting the "funeral" every year and of casting the effigy into a rye field to ensure a healthy crop. However, their actual description of the ritual itself shows that the effigy was</page><page sequence="10">164 Elizabeth A. Warner not in fact left in the field, but in a ditch beside it (Grinkova 1947, 179). The important thing for the harvest was perhaps not the presence of the dead effigy in the field but the annual disposal of the rusalka as an unclean corpse. The natural element of the rusalki was water. Their appearance on dry land, and more especially in cultivated areas and close to houses during rusalka week, was an invasion of places regarded by the peasants as "their own" ( svoi ), as opposed to regions such as distant fields, the forest, lakes and rivers that were "not one's own" (chuzhie). They protected themselves from the rusalki with many interdictions - against washing clothes, spinning, ploughing and sowing, swimming and so on, during rusalka week. Unlike other unclean dead, the rusalki were not accused specifically of causing drought, but they were the cause of other problems - torrential rain when it was not wanted, winds and storms. The peasants said the rusalki trampled the young crops during their dances or stole the grain. Their relationship with moisture, or the lack of it, was complex. When they walked on dry land they were said to leave behind moist footprints. They could also create streams of water by combing their long hair. On the other hand, if they stayed out of the water without their combs, or went too far away from the water, they could dry up and die (Dal' 1880, 58). If the presence of the rusalki on land was tolerated during rusalka week, it is obvious that, by its end, that presence was no longer desirable. By encouraging the rusalki' s return to their natural wet habitat, the rivers, lakes and ponds, which were also regarded as appropriate places for depositing the bodies of the unclean dead in general, the agricultural community safeguarded themselves and their crops. The activities and games concerned with death outlined above could be seen as the culminating phase of a lengthy period in which the comfort and placation of the dead received considerable attention, beginning with the official Orthodox Ancestor Days on the Saturday preceding Lent and on the second, third and fourth Saturdays of Lent. Cemeteries were also visited and food shared with dead relatives on Easter Sunday and Radunitsa, the Tuesday of St Thomas' week, following Easter week, when, according to popular belief, the ancestors sent a warm breath of air from their graves. This attention to the dead is clearly linked to the resumption of agricultural work. By April the cold covering of snow was beginning to thin and the peasant community turned its thoughts to preparation for spring sowing in the following month. Throughout May, with regional variations, sowing of the main crops - rye, oats and wheat - took place. Almost every saint's day in the folk calendar contained some reference to the sowing of seed. Thus, 21 May was Ivan Pshenichnik (Ivan Sow- Wheat). On this day, too, sacrificial pies were baked for distribution to those substitutes for the dead - beggars and itinerants. Freshly-sown seed requires an ideal combination of sun and rain, so the invocation of rain became one of the agriculturalist's main concerns: "If it rains well three times in May, there will be grain for three whole years" (" Esli vypadet v mae tri dozhdya dobrykh, to i khleba budet na tri goda polnykh") (Nekrylova 2007, 249-50 and 227). Why Inappropriate Burial in Earth of those who Died a Death "that Was Not Their Own" was Thought to Produce Drought In his monograph on the rusalki and unnatural death, D. K. Zelenin examined and rejected various explanations for the belief that drought would follow the burial in</page><page sequence="11">Russian Peasant Beliefs Concerning the Unclean Dead and Drought 165 earth of unclean corpses. E. V. Petukhov, for example, had suggested that drought was seen as a punishment from God for the sacrilegious inhumation of sinners (Petukhov 1888, 168). Certainly, the peasants themselves often offered this as an explanation. However, according to Zelenin, Christianity was unlikely to have been the formative influence on a superstition already recorded in the thirteenth century, not much more than two hundred years after the Christianisation of Russia. True, but it should also be remembered that during the so-called period of dual faith ( dvoeverie ) which followed Russia's conversion, when a Christian practice echoed a previously existing pagan one, there was often a process of reinforcement and it is very difficult sometimes to disentangle the separate elements of the resulting symbiosis. Very early on in its history in Russia, the Orthodox Church was conveying a strong message of divine rewards and punishments, producing in simple people with no understanding of theology an ingrained religious fatalism, in which every kind of disaster was regarded as God's will, and had to be borne with patience and addressed with prayers. For the agriculturalist, rewards and punishments affecting the weather were of particular note. As early as 1068 the chronicler in The Tale of Bygone Years ( Povest ' vremennykh let) wrote of how God punishes obstinate sinners with drought. God says: "I did not allow the rain to fall on you. One place I sprinkled with rain but another I did not sprinkle and that place shrivelled up" (Adrianova-Peretts 1950, vol. 1, 313). This simple philosophy of rewards and punishments was reiterated down the centuries in the homilies of priests and men of God. In the sixteenth-century manual of good husbandry known as the Domostroi the author explains that rain was manufactured in heaven and descended to earth in some miraculous way as a reward for good behaviour, or, conversely, that divine retribution came in the form of "hunger, plague, fire or floods . . . drought or rain without end, unsuccessful years, wicked winter and cruel frosts and lack of fertility in the land ..." (Kolesov and Rozhdestvenskaya 1994, 143). Both Christian and pre-Christian beliefs played a part in popular perceptions of weather conditions. Zelenin himself preferred to see at least a partial answer to the conundrum of the unclean dead and drought in the sacral nature of Mother Moist- Earth. Since the unclean dead, he reasoned, are closely related to demonic forces, they should by rights be disposed of in "unclean places," the haunts of demons. Water, especially when swampy and stagnant, or in the form of deep whirlpools where the water demon lived, was ideal for this purpose. The defining factor in choosing a place of disposal was thus not between earth and, for example, a watery grave, but between a "pure" and an "impure" medium. Earth, being a pure element, took offence, as it were, at the presence of an unclean corpse, turned cold and destroyed crops with un-seasonal frost. Zelenin also thought that originally it was frost, and not drought, that was supposedly caused by the unclean dead. Only later, after the peasants had begun to utilise pools and swamps as places of disposal, did the notion of drought arise. Zelenin interpreted the pouring of water into the graves of unclean corpses as a form of rain-charm, to invoke rain, but how Mother Moist-Earth could prevent rain from falling remained a mystery for him (Zelenin 1916, 81-5). There are a number of points in Zelenin's conclusions worthy of commentary. Firstly, there were in fact peasant beliefs in a continuum of flowing waters - water from below, as in rivers, or from within the ground and water from above, as rain.</page><page sequence="12">166 Elizabeth A. Warner In Vladimir government in the nineteenth century, to give only one example, rainbows were described as arched pipes that drink water from seas, rivers and springs. Rain was then poured back through openings in the sky (Firsov and Kisileva 1993, 118 and 119). So, in theory, if moisture within the earth froze or dried up, this could affect the production of rain. Secondly, there is no reason to suggest that originally frost, rather than drought, was the consequence of inappropriate burial of the unnatural dead. As early as 1274, the Bishop of Vladimir, Serapion, wrote that it is not the burial of drowned and hanged men but the wrath of God that causes natural disasters such as drought, floods of rain and failure of crops. He does not mention frost (Serapion Vladimirskii n.d., 8). Perhaps it is worth remembering in any case that frost and drought are related, in that both cause the death of plants through dehydration. Thirdly, there is the atavistic attitude to earth as a pure element. In fact, burial in earth of unclean corpses was not always rejected by the superstitious. Burials of suicides and those suspected of witchcraft, for example, took place at crossroads and on the boundary strips between fields. In such cases the liminal nature of the chosen places, at the intersection of the worlds of humans and spirit-beings, was the determining factor. For the Orthodox faithful, committal to the earth was and remains a prerequisite for bodily resurrection at the Last Judgement but naturally a Christian burial was and is denied those deemed unworthy. However, the precise composition and treatment of this excluded group has varied down the ages. Suicide victims who killed themselves while of sound mind have always been treated with particular severity. Those killed in a duel, even in the nineteenth century, risked burial without funeral rites and in out-of the-way places, rather than in the churchyard. Patriarch Adrian (1627-1700) judged moral turpitude particularly harshly, refusing Christian burial even in the ubogii dom, not only to suicides and un- shriven criminals killed while committing acts of violence, but also to drunkards and people whose death could be attributed to their own folly, such as by falling out of a swing or drowning while larking about in the water! Their bodies were not to be buried but taken out into field and forest and abandoned there. His predecessor Filaret, on the other hand, had permitted Christian burial for all who died a sudden accidental or violent death while "suicides" of all kinds, including people who drowned while bathing, he consigned to the ubogii dom (Snegirev 1826, 247-8). The acceptance by the Orthodox Church of disposal in paupers' houses suggests ambivalence towards the idea of Christian burial for those who had been denied confession and absolution by the mere circumstance of sudden death. The unseemly huddle of bodies in open pits, the use of quick-lime, the hasty shovelling of earth at Semik, and the communal funerals, bear little relation to the normal Orthodox funeral rites with their emphasis on the comfort and rest of the individual soul and the committal of a cleansed body to holy earth. Pre-Christian veneration of the earth certainly played a part, especially in the distant past, in defining popular attitudes to burial for the "unclean" dead, but it is clearly not the whole story. In fact, of the thirty and more well-documented cases of illegal exhumation presented by Zelenin, not one specifically mentions rejection by the earth or suggests that the earth was offended. In nineteen cases, on the other hand, the</page><page sequence="13">Russian Peasant Beliefs Concerning the Unclean Dead and Drought 167 corpses were exhumed from Christian cemeteries and in two cases from graves close to a cemetery. The other grave-sites were not specified. Five additional episodes of exhumation mentioned by Zelenin, as well as my examples from eparchial records, also concern corpses buried in cemeteries. Furthermore, this circumstance is given as the reason for the peasants' anger in a substantial number of all these cases. It is worth noting that during fieldwork in the Poles'e region of south Russia in the 1970s, N. I. Tolstoi and S. M. Tolstaya found that the exhuming of "unclean" corpses suspected of causing drought had been widespread there and was particularly connected by informants to burial in consecrated ground (Tolstoi and Tolstaya 1978, 107). In fact, both the pagan necropolis and the Christian cemetery were regarded as the home of ancestors ( roditeli ) and respected relatives. The placing of unclean dead alongside them was in itself insupportable and sufficient motivation for their removal. The Hungry and Thirsty Dead I would suggest that with regard to places of disposal, in addition to the opposition pure or impure proposed by Zelenin, the opposition wet or dry may be of at least equal importance. Significantly, hunger, which we usually associate with lack of food, and thirst, which we associate with lack of liquid, are linked in Russian. The adjective sukhoi (dry) can also have the meaning of "without food." Thus a day that is sukhoi is a fast day, when the meat of warm-blooded animals is forbidden. Zasukha (drought) is derived from the same root, as is the term sush' (dry land). In Russian folk tradition the anthropomorphised figure of death is depicted as both hungry and thirsty. In one Russian funeral lament, a widow exclaims that if she had seen death coming for her husband - "hungry from the blue sea" - she would have provided her with all manner of sweet things to eat and honey mead to drink (Chistova and Chistov 1997, vol. 1, 26). In this context we might remember Alan Dundes's comment in his insightful article on the evil eye: "Wet and dry as an oppositional pair means life and death. Liquids are living; drying is dying" (Dundes 1981, 266). The need for the dead themselves to eat and drink was and still is referred to in practices following a death. In south Russia, according to Bulgakov, while a corpse remained in the house, a knife was placed in the drinking water container in order to prevent the corpse from drinking the water at night (Bulgakov 1993, vol. 2, 1293). A widow might offer her husband food on the morning after his death: "Here is a rye bun for you. You had no supper yesterday evening and you've had no breakfast today" (Kremleva 2001, 76). Food, such as bread and pies, together with drink, were placed in coffins. Even today, a bottle of vodka may find its way into the coffin of a drinking man. During the forty days after a death, during which, according to tradition, the soul still lingers near its home, food, water or a glass of vodka are still left out for it. The dead were, and still are, provided with food and drink at funeral and memorial repasts. In July 2008, at a funeral meal in the village of Azopol'e (Arkhangel'skaya oblast'), I noticed that a spoonful of each dish was placed on a plate for the deceased, together with a tumbler of vodka covered with a slice of</page><page sequence="14">168 Elizabeth A. Warner black bread. In the evening the food and drink were carried to the cemetery and left upon his grave. On the fortieth day after death, the deceased was, and still may be, invited by name to return home for the last time and a place is set for him at table. At certain festivals - Easter Sunday, Radunitsa, Semik and the Saturday preceding Troitsa - a visit to one's roditeli at the cemetery, with a meal at the graveside, was considered essential. Families still visit cemeteries and picnic around the graves. Sweets, bread, cake, an upended tumbler or cup may be seen on the grave after such memorial occasions. The intemperate consumption of food and alcoholic drinks at cemeteries was condemned by the Orthodox Church in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. There was such an excess of foodstuffs and strong liquor that, in the words of S. V. Bulgakov, "the memorial meals were comparable to the funeral feasts of pagan times" (1993, vol. 2, 1360). S. V. Maksimov wrote in similar vein in 1903 of the orgiastic celebrations in Russian cemeteries at Radunitsa, after the departure of the clergy: "... then the men turn up at the cemetery and the feasting on the graves begins. The peasants exchange Easter greetings with their dead relatives, carry out acts of remembrance, bury coloured eggs in the graves and pour beer over them. They place fresh turf on the graves, on top of which are laid out all kinds of tasty food, including vodka and beer . . . the mourners call their guests from beyond the grave by name, inviting them to eat and drink at the memorial repast" (Maksimov 1994, 352). The sheer physicality of this intercourse between the living and the dead may be seen in the act of placing food and drink inside the grave-site. If those who died a natural death were possessed of normal appetites, how much more voracious might be the appetite of the unclean dead, who were denied the usual memorial repasts. Many East Slavonic folktales about the unclean dead who walked after death suggest that they did so "in the flesh" since the earth would not decompose their bodies. They kept the appetites they had while still alive. They were noted for their prodigious hunger and thirst. They drank blood, engaged in acts of cannibalism or ate clothing and the swaddling bands of babies, as a substitute for human flesh. If they returned home and resumed a relationship with their wives, the women would dry up and wither away (sokhnut' /chakhnut'). In other words, the dead husbands drained them of life-giving fluids. The revenants of north Russian tales tended to devour the whole body of their victims, flesh and blood together, whereas those of southern parts and Ukraine, known as upir'/ upyr' (vampire), more usually drank blood. On 26 December 1798, in the village of Spiridonovka, Pyatigorsk uezd, Kiev government, a peasant named Kirill Peven' died and was buried in the local cemetery. The following year, after reports of numerous sightings of the dead man, who apparently caused nightmares and sickness, the villagers, together with the local priest, exhumed his body and, according to statements taken at the time, discovered the corpse uncorrupted and with blood under his fingernails (Central State Archive of the USSR fond 796, opis' 80, ed. khr. 976, list 78-9). Physical descriptions of the zombie- like unclean dead often exaggerate the organs of eating and drinking - the mouth, tongue and teeth. Sometimes the ghoul has steel teeth. Time and again we read of how he grinds his teeth, rasps, grates or bares his teeth or sharpens his teeth on a</page><page sequence="15">Russian Peasant Beliefs Concerning the Unclean Dead and Drought 169 whetstone. One nineteenth-century spell against drought describes a coffin which the earth has rejected and the corpse of a drunkard within it. Around the coffin, for a distance of seven times twenty verstas, no rain has fallen. The corpse is golovastyi (big-headed) and zubastyi (toothy), and also has a long tongue which stretches to the crown of his head (Maikov 1869, 574). It is interesting to note the types of unclean dead who were especially subjected to the indignity of exhumation. Zelenin described around thirty cases in detail, to which may be added five from the eparchial records, giving us thirty-five references to specific exhumations. If we omit the examples in which the exact nature of the death is unspecified, we are left with twenty-nine incidents in which nine of the deceased mentioned had committed suicide (mostly by hanging), two were drowned, six were accused of sorcery, three of being vampires and ten were said to have drunk themselves to death ( opoitsy ). Although I cannot claim any statistical evidence from such a small sample, I do, however, see a clear correlation between twenty-one of these cases - the drowned, the sorcerers, the vampires and the drunkards - and the agriculturalists' fear of drought. Zelenin additionally quotes five general references to the practice of exhuming suspect corpses in Russia, every one of which mentions drunkards (Zelenin 1916, 65-6). The Drowned In the popular imagination no differentiation seems to have been made, in assessing the potential harm posed by the deceased, between drowning by accident and drowning as suicide. By the very nature of their death, the drowned, innocent or otherwise, could be regarded as excessive "drinkers" of water. Water had become their natural place of disposal and to bury them in earth was to deprive them of that moist environment to which they had become accustomed. Although death by drowning plays a less prominent part in Zelenin's examples than, for example, the death of drunkards, other research suggests that the graves of the drowned were a frequent object of attention of the superstitious. In the Poles'e region, for example, N. I. Tolstoi and S. M. Tolstaya found that most of the incidents in which water was poured over a grave concerned a drowned person (Tolstoi and Tolstaya 1978, 110). People who Drank themselves to Death Among the categories of the unclean dead frequently blamed for outbreaks of exceptionally dry weather, drunkards occupy a prominent position. This is clear from the relatively large number of drunkards in the exhumations cited by Zelenin, many of which mention the peasants' strong condemnation of the burial of drunkards in or near a Christian cemetery. The Orthodox Church, on the other hand, did not, as a general rule, treat drunkards like suicides, even if it could be shown that the person drank vodka deliberately, knowing that it would lead to his or her death. They were not normally denied Christian burial. People who have drunk themselves to death do not figure in that exceedingly detailed list of those who died an untimely death and for whom special prayers were said at Semik and on the Saturday before Trinity Sunday. Nevertheless, there was some ambiguity in the attitude of the Church. As we saw earlier, Patriarch Adrian's seventeenth-century pronounce-</page><page sequence="16">170 Elizabeth A. Warner ment on who should be denied Christian burial included fatalities involving alcohol abuse. Even at the end of the nineteenth century, the death of drunks remained a subject of controversy for some priests. Not all were willing to provide a Christian funeral. There was no such uncertainty for the superstitious, however, for whom opoitsy were clearly regarded as the most dangerous of the unclean dead. They believed strongly that someone who had drunk to excess in his or her lifetime had the potential to continue quenching their thirst in one way or another after death. Sorcerers and Vampires On 21 September 1799, the Pereyaslav diocesan court reported that in the village of Denisy, following the declaration of a peasant woman, one Anna Loburennova, the recent lack of rain had been caused by the presence in the village of many witches, including herself, the inhabitants sought out those women, stripped them naked and plunged them into the water (Central State Archive of the USSR, fond 796, opis' 80, ed. khr. 976, list 75-6). In this particular case no corpse was involved but sorcerers, both alive and dead, were frequently implicated in the creation of drought. Among the activities traditionally attributed to witches and wizards was the ability to steal liquids in general, and to prevent or cause wet weather in particular. Indeed, sorcerers appeared to have an innate power to deprive things of moisture. This may be seen, for example, in a belief recorded in Elat'ma uezd, Tambov government, at the end of the nineteenth century, to the effect that holes in the ground which appeared after the collapse of grave-mounds were the resting places of sorcerers, and that if anyone was to fall into one and find themselves buried up to the waist they would begin to shrivel up (Zvonkov 1889, 78). Witches reputedly stole milk, sometimes causing the cow to dry up completely. They could even take the milk from a distance, drawing it by their magic into some container or into a large puddle. At Midsummer, on the festival of Ivan Kupala, so it was said, they gathered dew in their aprons. They could steal rain and hide it in a pot, from which they would release it later in the form of floods or hail. Wizards "spoiled" newly-weds, "drying up" young husbands and making them impotent. Down the centuries, the spells witches recommended to love-sick girls and youths used the language of heat to convey the idea of passions that parched the hearts of men and women. These spells were called prisukhi/ prisushki, literally spells to make someone dry up from love (cf. sushit/ to dry). In the spells, blood is set alight, hearts blaze, fire and flame are sent to torment the beloved. In one nineteenth- century spell, the winds are asked to carry the prisukha to the object of desire. They are warned not to drop it on the way, for "If you drop it in the water, the water will dry up, if you drop it in the forest, the forest will wither, if you drop it on the earth, the earth will burn up." The final warning is particularly interesting: "If you drop it on a grave where a corpse lies the bones will leap up" (Maikov 1869, 423). In other words, the dehydrating action of the spell will turn a corpse into the living dead. In supernatural memorates and anecdotes, the unclean dead, and often sorcerers in particular, who walk after death, are associated with hunger, thirst and the ability to absorb liquids. They acquire the same appetites as the vampire and often return home specifically in order to eat. In one tale, the dead wizard returns to his</page><page sequence="17">Russian Peasant Beliefs Concerning the Unclean Dead and Drought 171 home: "After gnawing his way through the door into the house he throws himself upon the cradle, if there is one. He sucks the baby's blood, then turns to any other living creatures in the house. The first crow of the cock finds him lying on the ground, covered in blood" (Kharitinov 1848, 146). Some sorcerers were specifically acclaimed for their ability to manipulate rain-clouds. As early as 680 A.D., the Sixth Ecumenical Council of the Orthodox Church in Constantinople had denounced belief in the so-called "cloud-chasers" who foretold the future from the shape of clouds and who, with the help of demons, drove clouds away to prevent rain or hail on one region or to cause it on some other ( The Rudder (Pedalion) of the Metaphorical Ship . . . 1983, 357-9). Condemnation of such beliefs in the Russian context came with the translation of the compilation of Holy canons of the Orthodox Church into Russian in the twelfth century. "Cloud-chasers" ( oblakoprogonniki ) were known in mediaeval Russia and had recourse to a complex arsenal of magic formulae and actions (Turilov 2002, 533-49). The following anecdote dating to 1891 from Tula government demonstrates the stability of belief in such talents down the ages: "It was said that a certain railway employee had the power to summon winds by waving his handkerchief and that he used this power to keep rain away so that work could proceed unhindered on a stretch of line. Unfortunately, this caused drought as well, to the anger of the peasants. When they lifted a clod of earth over which he had walked and cast it into a pond a shower of rain ensued" (Kolchin 1899, 16). This suggests that the wizard had deprived the earth of its natural moisture by his very presence upon it. Although sorcerers, strictly speaking, do not belong to the same category as the unclean dead, they do share a number of common features. Since they must reject their Christian faith, they die without absolution and their souls pass into the keeping of the Devil who, rather than God, determines the time and manner of their death. They too may be rejected by the earth and become revenants after death, continuing the Devil's work until the terms of their contract have been fulfilled. Conclusion The question of the unclean dead and their involvement in the causing of drought is a complex one, to which there can clearly be no single answer. In Russian folk religion, all the dead were deemed capable of influencing the weather for good or ill. In Ryzan' government in the nineteenth century, for example, during a drought devout old women would order a mass for their dead relatives, whose prayers would then, they hoped, persuade God to send rain (Semenova 1898, 231). Inappropriate burial in earth could offend both Mother Moist-Earth and God, resulting in frost or drought; in one case through the reaction of the earth herself and in the other through the influence of an all-powerful deity upon nature. The exhumation and re-disposal of unclean corpses may partly be regarded as a rite of propitiation, replacing a "pure" resting place with a more appropriate "impure" one. However, the provision of a "wet," rather than a "dry" resting- place may be more significant. We have seen that sorcerers, both alive and dead, could withdraw life-giving fluids from people, animals and nature, including the earth, that other categories of unclean dead, such as the drowned and drunkards, by association with the</page><page sequence="18">172 Elizabeth A. Warner nature of their death, were deemed capable of absorbing liquids and that revenants in general had voracious appetites. In times of drought the provision of abundant food and drink to the living, let alone the dead, acquired the significance of a magical act. In Orlov government, according to Trunov, religious ceremonies for the ending of drought were accompanied by extravagant feasting and heavy drinking that clearly had a ritual purpose. Thus, if any of the clergy did not drink wine their portion was nevertheless doled out into a vessel specially provided for this purpose (Trunov 1869, 8). When examining the belief that the unclean dead were capable of causing drought it is certainly useful to consider it in the context of the hungry and /or thirsty dead. Large numbers of unclean dead were "starved" both spiritually and physically. They missed out on any form of regular "feeding," having to make do with occasional token offerings, such as at Semik, or when local tradition permitted. In Perm' oblast' at Radunitsa, for example, some food was placed under the table. This was intended for those who had died prematurely, who had drowned or died in a fire, who were not worthy to sit around the common table (Kremleva 2001, 84). To forestall their craving for liquid, blood and blood-containing flesh, the unclean dead must be kept moist in other ways, by, for example, the pouring of water over their corpses and into the grave-sites. The concentration of events involving the commemoration of the dead, both "clean" and "unclean," together with the performance of mock funeral games, in the period leading into summer may be linked to the peasants' fear that lack of rain at this time of year would prevent the germination of crops or inhibit their growth. Clearly, for the agriculturalist, there was a correlation between "remembering" the dead, propitiating the unclean dead and ensuring moisture for the successful germination of crops.
