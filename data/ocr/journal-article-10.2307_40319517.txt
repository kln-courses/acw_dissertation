<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Conflict of Science and Religion in Charles Peirce's Philosophy * Yuri K. Melvil Charles Sanders Peirce (1839-1914) has recently become one of the most fashionable philosophers in the U.S.A. Almost unknown during his lifetime, having tried unsuccessfully for decades to obtain a position at a university, failing to publish a single book on phil- osophy, and dying penniless and in complete obscurity, he has un- expectedly become the subject of honor and veneration. During the first third of the century little was known about Peirce except that William James considered him the founder of pragmatism - the teaching which James himself had widely pop- ularized and which John Dewey had systematized and extended to many areas of social thought and transformed into the "almost official philosophy" of America. But increasingly since the end of the thirties Peirce has been awarded the reputation of "philosoph- ical genius/' The growth of the present interest in Peirce has coincided with a weakening of the influence of pragmatism, a process which has already begun, at least among the professional philosophers. The inability of Dewey's instrumentalism to deal with logical and methodological problems brought forth by the development of modern sciences was apparently one of the main reasons for the decay of pragmatism as a philosophical teaching. Pragmatism, however, has remained and probably will remain for a long time *Translated by L. Tikos and E. Stawiecki. 33</page><page sequence="2">Transactions of The Peirce Society to come the dominating method of political thinking of the leading American circles, of the governmental, political and trade-union leadership. The magazine America, published by the U.S. Govern- ment, has knowingly stated that ''American political leaders are inclined to pragmatism." x It is only natural that the adherents of pragmatism are trying at the present time to strengthen its philosophical position by bringing it up to date in accordance with modern logic and the philosophy of science. The collected works of Charles Sanders Peirce, the pub- lishing of which was completed in 1958 and which included many formerly unpublished manuscripts, seemed to open up favorable perspectives in this connection. Peirce not only possessed a tremen- dous scientific erudition but he was also a talented scholar who laid down new foundations in several areas of scientific cognition. An astronomer, geodesist, mathematician, Peirce was one of the greatest American logicians of the nineteenth century, contributing significantly to the development of mathematical logic. It is to Peirce's credit that semiotics (the teaching of symbols) has been established as an independent scientific branch, the importance of which needs no proof in our time. It was precisely this organic union of Peirce with science and his recognition as a scientist which attracted the modern pragmatists. In Peirce's works pragmatism tried to find precisely the thing it lacked - a logical and scientific basis. At the same time some repre- sentatives of the new positivism saw in Peirce a thinker who fore- told a number of their own ideas - in much, if not in everything, a man very close to them in spirit. If Dewey's writings have never attracted much attention among the European bourgeois philosophers, the works and ideas of Peirce are attracting an ever greater interest with each passing year. Not only in the U.S.A., but also in Canada, England, Switzerland, West Germany, and Italy, voluminous monographs are being published about Peirce's philosophy. The bibliography of special works dealing with Peirce contains several hundred titles. In 1946, a Charles S. Peirce Society was founded in the U.S.A., which had as its aim the propagation and study of his philosophy. Among American philosophers Peirce is almost unanimously 34</page><page sequence="3">Science and Religion in Peirce's Philosophy recognized as their most important philosopher. "In our own day," says H. D. Aiken, "the philosophical cognoscenti almost to a man regard him as the profoundest philosophical mind yet to appear on the far side of the Atlantic." 2 Bertrand Russell, whose attitude toward pragmatism is not entirely favorable, makes an exception in the case of Peirce, noticing his originality, his versatility, and the creative character of his mind. "Peirce was undoubtedly a great philosopher," writes Russell. "He reminds one of a volcano, spout- ing vast masses of rock, of which some, on examination, turn out to be nuggets of pure gold." * In Marxist literature Peirce is almost an unknown figure. Mean- while, apart, from the panegyrics which people in the U.S.A. and other countries are singing to him at present, Peirce is indeed an unusual phenomenon in bourgeois philosophy. He is a most inter- esting thinker in whose works the typical contradiction in the con- sciousness of a scientist living in a capitalistic society is depicted with great vividness. The scientific interests of Peirce and his fruitful research activ- ities in the areas of the natural sciences, mathematics, and especially that of semiotics and logic were stimulating sources of interesting and profound ideas about the nature of scientific cognition which have not lost their significance even to this day. In their entirety they represent that which could be called the scientific trend in Peirce's teaching. But Peirce was not only a man of science. Like the American scientific intellectuals of his time he remained a religious man until the very end of his days. Peirce was convinced that "all realty is due to the creative power of God" (6.505), that science is "knowl- edge of God's truth" (1.239), that for the support of the social order and morality "the great catholic church is wanted" (6.443). Peirce's mind was tortured by the insoluble contradiction between scientific vocation and religious consciousness which left its mark of duality on almost all of his works. Peirce clearly recognized that "the most striking tendency of our age is our materialistic tend- ency." 4 The connection of this tendency with the successes of the natural sciences caused no doubt in his mind. In 1871 Peirce wrote that "a man who enters into the scientific 35</page><page sequence="4">Transactions of The Peirce Society thought of the day and has not materialistic tendencies, is getting to be an impossibility" (8.38). But ever since the beginning of Peirce's activity he was not left in peace by the question of "how Christianity will appear if we look at it from a materialistic point of view.'* 5 He soon understood "that the spirit of science is hostile to any religion" (6.426) and that time is on the side of science and works against religion. Science grows without cease, but as far as religion is concerned, "like a plucked flower, its destiny is to wilt and fade" (6.430) . And it was precisely our epoch which discovered obvious symptoms of the "dissolution of the Christian faith" (1.569) . However, despite everything, Peirce tried to save religion and to reconcile it with science. For this purpose, following in the foot- steps of Berkeley, Hume, and Kant, he tried to incorporate both the agnostic and the idealistic basis into the process of cognition, to give an epistemological interpretation of the scientific method and scientific concepts which would eliminate from them all material- istic content. The transformation of scientific concepts undertaken by Peirce received its fullest expression in his subjective idealistic doctrine of pragmatism and, on the other hand, in his objective idealistic evolu- tionary metaphysics. Differing from the Machists, other pragmatists, new-realists, etc., Peirce did not pretend that he was creating a "third line" in phil- osophy. He did not conceal the fact that he was in the same camp as Berkeley and Hegel, and claimed that "I am idealistic." 6 At the same time Peirce as a scientist could not, and did not want to, break with science, with its methods and its logical apparatus. He was excited by the real and important problems of the cognition of nature, of epistemology, of the scientific method and the logic of science. During the course of decades he was able to work selflessly and disinterestedly on their solutions, but he was always concerned with not causing any harm to religion and to its theoretical basis - to philosophical idealism. Not a single serious question of the theory of the cognition did he deal with without having a good look at the possible consequences which it might have on a religious, idealistic world outlook. Therefore, despite his important achievements in logic and se- 36</page><page sequence="5">Science and Religion in Peirce's Philosophy miotics, despite a series of profound hypotheses and insights, despite his subjective devotion to science, Peirce is nevertheless unfaithful to science and the scientific method, frequently identifying himself objectively with philosophers whose conscious effort was to fight science and the scientific outlook. Peirce's works consist of contradictory elements, of fantastic in- terweavings of scientific insight with antiscientific speculations. They are full of interesting hypotheses which are sometimes dis- torted and lead nowhere because of their antimaterialistic prejudices and religious biases, inflicted upon the process of his thinking and giving it a false direction. In this article we are not dealing with the concrete logical-meth- odological ideas of Peirce. We are interested only in certain general problems of his understanding of science and the scientific method, his general epistemological aims - and only insofar as they illustrate the basic contradiction of his philosophy. The highest principle of reason which, according to Peirce, should direct the scientist, is the following: "In order to learn, you must desire to learn" (1.135). This thesis seems to be rather trivial, but its meaning is more profound than it would appear. It is directed, as a defense of science, against those who are eager to see some- thing different in science from the cognition of truth, and is similar to the situation in the Middle Ages when scientists were required "to put into a rational light the faith of which they were already possessed" (7.87). In our time, says Peirce, people often see the meaning of science in "the amassing of social goods" and in the se- curing of "social stability." Sometimes people who consider them- selves scientists are interested in science only "as a means of gaining money." Such a utilitarian attitude, which, by the way, found wide- spread acceptance in the bourgeois society of the nineteenth cen- tury, especially in the U.S.A., Peirce considers amoral and destruc- tive to science. He admits, of course, that the results and discoveries of science may, and even should, aid in the solution of practical problems. But he also assumes that whatever the practical application of science may be, true science "aims at nothing but knowing" (2.1). Science 37</page><page sequence="6">Transactions of The Peirce Society is "the pursuit of knowledge for the sake of knowledge alone."T To the extent that the pursuit of science is fruitful, science appears as "a living and growing body of truth" (6.428) . However, the essence and life of science do not consist of ready-made results of experimen- tal and theoretical research but rather of the spirit which guides this research. People become scientists not because of knowledge as such but because of their "great desire to learn the truth" (1.235). Science is a living process of experimentation, of the proposing of conjectures and hypotheses, of their confirmation, of the rejection of conjectures and theories that are in contradiction to the facts and their replacement with new ideas, and so on, ad infinitum. Sci- ence "is in an incessant state of metabolism and growth" (1.232). Characterizing science in this way, Peirce undoubtedly caught and expressed the dialectical spirit of the science of the new age which is hostile to dogmatism, which is seeking, critical, and questioning, which does not bend before any authority, which is ready to throw it out and "forget every theory the moment the facts of ob- servation appear against it."s But Peirce violated the measure and overstepped the line, separat- ing antidogmatism from relativism. He brought the true idea to its ultimate limit and it changed into its opposite: from a stressing of the critical spirit of scientific cognition it turned into the debasement of the cognitive possibilities of science. Since Peirce contraposes knowledge to the desire for knowledge, he contraposes the truth to the search for truth. He claims that "science consists of inquiry not in 'doctrine'"9; he says that science is "not knowledge, but the pur- suit of knowledge."10 He rejects the definition of science as "the or- ganized system of knowledge," and he insists that knowledge is not at all necessary for the real scientist, for whom it is sufficient to have the desire to know. Contradicting his own definition of science as a living and grow- ing body of truth, Peirce says that as soon as some relatively stable and definite cognitions are formed in the course of inquiry, they im- mediately fall down from the pure sphere of science to the area of practical application, like crystals, so that science has nothing what- soever to do with these cognitions thereafter except in case of a new revision. 38</page><page sequence="7">Science and Religion in Peirce's Philosophy But what is left of science, if one strikes from it all positive know- ledge, all truths that aré confirmed and justified by practice? What is left of science, if from the process of knowing one excludes the continuity and the development of knowledge? In such a case there can be no talk of scientific theory, and science would be reduced to incorporeal inquiry, to a series of solutions of isolated cognitive problems. We arrive at the understanding of science as a capability or a possibility of "solving problems" which has been propagandized by Dewey. And as a final result, a science which would not only strive to- ward truth, but which would release this bluebird from its hands at the very moment when it could be caught, a science which deliber- ately refuses the scientific picture of the world, loses, of course, all rights of voting when it comes to the debate over the problems of world outlook. And confronted by church and religion which praise their own absolute truth, science will be forced into silence. From the "rule of reason" formulated above, Peirce deduces the corollary which he recommends be inscribed upon every wall of the "city of philosophy": "Do not block the road to inquiry" (1.135). This is an extraordinarily important and wise rule. It makes us remember how difficult and complicated the road of knowledge is, along which one cannot know in advance what sort of unexpected things are awaiting the scientist and what kind of "insane" hypo- theses will be necessary for their explanation. The rule also states that there are no areas, and cannot be any, which are taken out of the competence of science, where scientific research would not be admissible. This rule proclaims the freedom of research and rejects attempts of every kind to limit in advance any results which science would then feel obligated to achieve. The scientist is obligated to submit only to facts and to the logic of reasoning. Scientific re- search must "look into the face of truth." No considerations of ma- terial gain, comfort, or self-interest should influence and pressure the scientist and his conscience, because "truth is truth, whether it is opposed to the interests of society to admit it or not" (8.143). Developing this conception, Peirce probably did not suspect that in essence he expressed only the dialectical conception of scientific cognition and of the roads to its development. The rule he formu- 39</page><page sequence="8">Transactions of The Peirce Society lated remains a very important one for science in our time - one could cite many instances of the attempt by dogmatic minds aimed at blocking those roads of science which led to very important dis- coveries. But in carrying out his highest rule Peirce was not con- sistent. First of all, he violated it in a most decisive instance. He de- liberately and insistently tried to exclude the very possibility of a materialistic consideration of any problems of science, thus block- ing for himself the road to their solution, that road which in the final analysis proved to be the only fruitful one. When one of his critics discovered materialistic statements made by him, Peirce re- plied indignantly, "I never promulgated a materialistic idea in my life" (6.605 n.). This claim is not correct, since in a series of in- stances Peirce willy-nilly accepted materialistic positions. However, it is true that he always conscientiously avoided them. Secondly, claiming that the road to inquiry should not be blocked, Peirce did not always understand inquiry as a genuine scientific re- search led by scientific methods and pursuing scientific goals. In connection with his pragmatism Peirce formulated such an under- standing of inquiry which, in fact, denied scientific cognition. From the point of view of Peirce's pragmatism, "inquiry" does not mean at all the process of scientific cognition or "the search for truth." It means only the action directed at the elimination of an unpleasant and restless state of doubt and at the achievement of a pleasant and serene state of faith or stable opinion (see 5.374-376). As a prag- matist Peirce always claimed that thinking was necessary and justi- fied only to the extent that it allows us to rid ourselves of the irrita- tion caused by doubt and that "when doubt finally ceases, no matter how, the end of reasoning is attained" (7.324). According to pragmatism, "inquiry" does not proceed at all from no knowledge to knowledge, but only from doubt to belief. It does not assume either knowledge or truth. Peirce rejects as being a groundless fancy the idea that man strives not simply toward an opinion but toward the true opinion. He claims that the truth or falsity of belief does not have any connection with the goal of in- quiry, "for as soon as a firm belief is reached we are entirely satis- fied, whether the belief is true or false" (5.375). If we compare this view with the view of science as a striving to- 40</page><page sequence="9">Science and Religion in Peirce's Philosophy ward truth, as a search for knowledge for its own sake, then it be- comes apparent to what extent pragmatism distorts the idea of sci- ence and how incompatible it is with the conception of science that we find even within the framework of Peirce's philosophy. According to one of the definitions accepted by Peirce, truth is nothing but "a belief unassailable by doubt" (5.416), or "a final and compulsory belief" (2.29). Here Peirce does not even hint at the relationship between truth and objective reality. He insists upon saying that truth (as well as reality) should be defined only "in terms of doubt and belief" (5.416). In the system of Peirce's pragmatism there are other considera- tions in regard to the idea of truth, especially the consideration, elab- orated upon by James, which later on served as the pragmatic de- finition of truth by preference: truth as "satisfactory," as something which corresponds to our goals, as something expedient. Peirce says, for example, that "truth merely means the way to attain one's purposes" (1.344), so that, according to this, pragmatism "is a doc- trine that truth consists in future serviceableness for our ends."11 This definition demonstrates even more clearly the unscientific nature of pragmatism. It is obvious here that Peirce departs from science and takes a position which is essentially hostile to it. According to Peirce people who violate the highest rule of the scientific method create for themselves quite a few hindrances on the road of inquiry. He criticizes the claim that "this, that and the other never can be known" (1.138), and that this or that element of science is final, ultimate, and "utterly inexplicable" (1.139). Any true scientist and materialistic philosopher would willingly subscribe to Peirce's assertion that "over against any cognition there is an unknown but knowable reality" (5.275). Beginning with his very first works Peirce has always insisted upon saying that in the world surrounding us "nothing can be admitted to be absolutely inexplicable" (5.318). As to the question which agitated innumerable generations of philosophers, namely, "Is true knowledge of the world possible?" we find the convincing answer, "Yes!" in Peirce's works. "Modern science has never faltered in its confidence that it would ultimately 41</page><page sequence="10">Transactions of The Peirce Society find out the truth concerning any questions in which it could apply the check of experiment" (7.87). One can even assert that science, proceeding from experience to a broader explanation of it, "is fore- destined to reach the truth of every problem" (7.77). Denying the existence of the inexplicable, Peirce saw as the im- mediate task of science the explanation of things that are revealed to us by experience. He was decisively against the positivist view, according to which science should only describe phenomena and not have any right to their causal explanation or to their more profound essence. In this connection his polemics with William James are characteristic. James, in full agreement with the spirit of positivism, claimed in the preface to his book, Principles of Psychology, that he would limit himself solely to a strictly scientific point of view, investigat- ing the thoughts, feelings, and certain conditions of man's brain as they are given directly and not proceeding any further than imme- diate data. If psychology goes further, James wrote, then "she be- comes metaphysical. All attempts to explain our phenomenally given thoughts as products of deeper-lying entities. . .are metaphysical."" Peirce cannot agree to this . suggestion. "Nor is it in the least true," he argues with James, "that the physicists confine themselves to such a strictly positivist point of view. Students of heat are not deterred by the impossibility of directly observing molecules from considering and accepting the kinetical theory; students of light do not brand speculations on the luminiferous ether as metaphysical." All these are "attempts to explain phenomenally given elements as products of deeper-lying entities" (8.60). There is no need to argue that Peirce was correct in his under- standing of this most important aspect of scientific cognition. Should science explore the causes of phenomena or only describe them? - this is one of the most profound disagreements between materialism and positivism which stems from the different answers to the fun- damental question of philosophy. In this case Peirce is against positivism. In opposition to James' positivist warnings not to fall into "meta- physics," Peirce says that without a broad philosophic perspective, or as he put it, without a certain "metaphysics," the scientist can- 42</page><page sequence="11">Science and Religion in Peirce's Philosophy not proceed very far even in special investigations. "Perhaps," says Peirce, "he thinks he has no metaphysics, and does not wish to have any. That will be a sure sign that he is badly handicapped with meta- physics of the crudest quality. The only way to disburden himself of it is to direct his attention to it. But he cannot reduce himself to anything like absolute skepticism in metaphysics without arresting his work" (7.82). However, the above-quoted statements of Peirce concerning the cognitive and explanatory power of science do not exhaust all his views on this question, since he could not keep long the position of a scientist. Stating correctly that there is nothing that cannot be explained, that any hypothesis which acknowledges the existence of the inex- plicable should be rejected (see 1.139), Peirce tries to use this statement against materialism. He says that "every unidealistic philosophy supposes something absolutely inexplicable. . ." (5.265). This "something" is, of course, matter. Matter, objective world, nature, are the point of departure for the materialistic philosophy and materialistic natural science. Nature, as Spinoza already understood it, is the cause of itself, and the explanation of it should lead back to it, to its characteristics and laws. The contrary view is that one has to go beyond the limits of nature to look for some kind of supernatural cause, principle or essence, i.e., one must step over to the religious-idealistic position. And this is precisely what Peirce has in mind. For Peirce the scien- tist, the explanation of natural phenomena means "the investiga- tion of causes" (7.85) and "bringing things under general laws or natural classes" (5.289). For Peirce the philosopher-idealist to ex- plain and understand a natural phenomenon means in the final an- alysis to reduce it to some kind of spiritual phenomenon. Since in Peirce's philosophy there are two poles - phenomenalis- tic, pragmatistic and metaphysical, objective-idealistic - the "expla- nation" of natural phenomena takes a two-fold form. In the sub- jective idealistic doctrine of pragmatism nothing can have an ob- jective existence. The idea of a thing, in accordance with the basic principle of pragmatism, is reduced to the idea of its "sensible ef- fects" and of "habits it produces" (5.400-401). The thing under- 43</page><page sequence="12">Transactions of The Peirce Society goes practically an entire anthropomorphic dissolution; it is dissolv- ed in the feelings of the subject and in its habitual behavior. In connection with his metaphysics Peirce recognizes the existence of material things, but he "explains" them, attributing to them a spiritual nature. "Viewing a thing from the outside. . .it appears as matter. Viewing it from the inside. . .it appears as consciousness" (6.268). In other words, "all matter material is really mind" (6.301). Considering the most important task of science to be that of ex- planation, which is understood as the investigation of causes and the discovery of laws, Peirce the scientist did not have any doubts about the most important principle of science, the principle of de- terminism. But, as an idealistic philosopher, he realized that from the earliest times determinism and materialism "went hand in hand, as by affinity they should" (6.36). Understanding determinism - like the majority of the scientists of his time - only as mechanical, "Laplacean," Peirce was convinced that "necessitarianism13 cannot logically stop short of making the whole action of the mind a part of the physical universe" (6.61). And so, despite his scientific con- victions, Peirce argued against the recognition of the universal character of causal connection. He does not deny the existence of the laws of nature, but together with them he introduces into his vision of the world absolute chance as being something that has no cause, something primordial and existing before the existence of law. Peirce considers law to be something secondary, born by chance. Despite the fact that it was Peirce himself who denied the existence of inexplicable things, he now says that "chance. . .calls for no ex- planation" (6.612), because it is the expression of the "pure spon- taneity of mind," of its freedom. Peirce frankly says that if one al- lows only a deviation from the strict observance of the principle of causality, "be it but by a strictly infinitesimal amount - we gain room to insert mind into our scheme" and then to recognize it as "the fountain of existence" (6.61). In this way the explanation here, too, consists of an equation of the phenomenon to be explained with the peculiar nature of mind which apparently needs no explanation, since for the idealist, mind is "the sole self -intelligible thing" (6.61). 44</page><page sequence="13">Science and Religion in Peirce's Philosophy According to Peirce, reality is entirely cognizable. It has nothing which in principle, at least, could not be explained. But he reduces even this true statement to an idealistic absurdity. Peirce says that the whole concept of reality is exhausted by cognizability, that ffcog- nizability (in its widest sense) and being are not merely metaphy- sically the same, but are synonymous terms" (5.275). This is, of course, the purest phenomenalism. Thus, while developing the correct scientific thesis about the cog- nizability of the world, Peirce in the final analysis gave to it a meaning which has nothing to do with science and used it to in- troduce a spiritual prime principle into his philosophy. The most serious obstacle blocking the road of science Peirce sees in the presumptuous pretension to having absolute and infallible knowledge, in "holding that this or that law or truth has found its last and perfect formulation" ( 1.140). "No blight can so surely arrest all intellectual growth as the blight of cocksureness; and ninety-nine out of every hundred good heads are reduced to impo- tence by that malady" (1.13). Peirce says that science, of course, suffers greatly when scientists doubt what they ought to believe. But nothing can be more harmful to science than "for men of science to believe what they ought to doubt" (5.498). The distinctive feature and the strength of science lie in its capa- bility of perfecting itself, of steadily improving and correcting its results. But the possibility of correction and improvement means that no conclusions, no hypotheses of science can be considered as final and absolutely certain. On the contrary, we must consider them as principally fallible ones and therefore subject to correction. The admission of the fallibility of all knowledge Peirce calls "fallibil- ism," and he thinks of it as the basic prerequisite of progress and consequently of the very existence of science. The conviction of the omnipotence of science together with the recognition of the fallibility of all knowledge - this is what, accord- ing to Peirce, makes the spirit of the real scientific method. "Out of contrite fallibilism, combined with a high faith in the reality of knowledge, and an intense desire to find things out, all my philos- ophy has always seemed to me to grow. . ." (1.14). 45</page><page sequence="14">Transactions of The Peirce Society However, the complexity of the problem which Peirce had to face consisted in the clarification of this point, namely, how to unite the recognition of the principal capability of science to give absolutely certain knowledge with the recognition of the imperfection of the statements made by science, of the approximative nature of its theories, of the fallibility of its conclusions. As we already know, according to Peirce, certain (or perfect) knowledge does exist. However, as he assumed, we cannot be quite sure in every single case that we do indeed possess this knowledge. "Perhaps we may already have attained to perfect knowledge about a number of questions; but we cannot have an unshakable opinion that we have attained such perfect knowledge about any given question" (4.63). Peirce also says that there are an essential number of hypotheses of whose truthfulness we are so much convinced that the smallest possibility of doubt in them seems to be absurd. Thus, for example, nobody has any doubt that 2x2 = 4, and "it would surely be downright insanity to entertain a doubt about Napoleon's existence" (5.589). But we must consider as absolute truth the proposition in which we unshakably believe and which we cannot doubt. How- ever, some of these indubitable propositions may, and frequently do, turn out to be not true, but false. For this reason Peirce's final con- clusion is as follows: "While it is possible that propositions that really are indubitable for the time being, should nevertheless be false, yet insofar as we do not doubt a proposition we cannot but regard it as perfectly true and perfectly certain." At the same time, "while holding certain propositions to be each individually per- fectly certain, we may and ought to think it likely that some one of them, if not more, is false" (5.498). Peirce is right when he makes a mark of distinction between real truth and that which we consider to be truth, between knowledge and belief or conviction, however well-grounded the latter may ap- pear to be. He is right when he points out that the difference is not always absolute, that belief can turn into knowledge, and know- ledge, upon testing, can prove to be only belief. But Peirce did not have an objective criterion either for establishing truth or for the difference between knowledge and belief, which he constantly con- 46</page><page sequence="15">Science and Religion in Peirce's Philosophy fused. In his theory of cognition there is a lack of scientific under- standing of practice as being the social, objective-sensual activity of man in which his knowledge and belief are tested by an immediate confrontation with objective reality (with material things) which he can change. As an objective idealist Peirce took no interest in prac- tice; as a pragmatist, i.e., as a subjective idealist, he saw nothing in it except sensations and the habits of the subject, except the satis- faction of his wishes. Speaking of the idealistic aberrations of Duhem and Stallo, the authors of two books on the theory of physics, V. I. Lenin pointed out that "these physicists-idealists are mostly interested in proving the relativity of our knowledge, wavering, in fact, between idealism and dialectical materialism/'14 This remark could, with a certain justification, also be applied to Peirce, since in his fallibilism the center of gravity in the final analysis appeared to be moving away from the recognition of the progressive nature of science toward the statement about the unreliability of the conclusions of science. As a result of this, fallibilism took on a skeptical, relativistic character. Since if led by the principle of fallibilism, science with its own ways and methods can achieve the truth in relation to any problem, then the lot of religion becomes unenviable. And Peirce is again in a hurry to give it a helping hand, exaggerating and absolutizing the relative aspect of fallibilism. According to the definition given by Peirce, "fallibilism is the doc- trine that our knowledge is never absolute, but always swims, as it were, in a continuum of uncertainty and of indeterminacy" (1.171). This entirely categorical statement underlies the weakness and the unreliability of our knowledge, the incapability of man to know anything except in an "uncertain and inexact way" (5.587). The relativistic trend, having achieved a dominating position in Peirce's fallibilism, leads him far away from the scientific position. Despite his frequently stressed conviction that truth exists and can be attained, Peirce says: "I cannot infallibly know that there is any Truth."18 But if this is so, then there is no objective criterion for making a distinction between real knowledge and fiction or illusion. In that case any myth considered as a theory would remain on an equal footing with the hypotheses of science. 47</page><page sequence="16">Transactions of The Peirce Society And so we read: "I do not suppose that twice two is four is more certain than Edmund Gurney held the existence of veridial phan- tasms of the dying or dead to be'* (5.577). If the theories of math- ematics are made equal in their reliability to stories about phan- tasms, then what is the worth, from Peirce's point of view, of sci- entific knowledge? But it turns out that we have no knowledge at all, and there is only ignorance. "There are various ways in which the natural cocksureness and conceit of man struggles to escape such confession of total ignorance. But they seem to be all quite futile' (5.588). It is a great distance from the "fallibility of science*' to "total ig- norance," but in Peirce's fallibilism the distance disappears. The fallibilism exaggerated by Peirce beyond measure leads him to a loss of the feeling of reality, to a complete theoretical confusion. "How do we know on the whole," Peirce asks, "that the past ever existed, that the future ever will exist? How do we know there ever was or ever will be anything but the present instant? Or stop: I must not say we. How do I know that anybody but myself ever existed or even myself exist except for one single instant, the pre- sent, and that all this business is not an illusion from top to bottom ? Answer: I don't know" (1.168). It is not difficult to guess to whom such ideas are useful, and Peirce never tried to conceal it. He said: "To hold a proposition to be certain is to puff oneself up with the vanity of perfect knowl- edge. It leaves no room for Faith."16 And Peirce explains to those who "fail to appreciate the importance of fallibilism" that, given the conditions of the present development of science, the alterna- tive to fallibilism can only be the picture of a materialistic universe, working by the blind absolute laws of mechanics. "This is a philo- sophy which leaves no room for a God!" Only fallibilism permits us to refute it. "And now," Peirce victoriously states, "will you tell me that this fallibilism amounts to nothing?" (1.162). The modern representatives of the "philosophy of science" (of the pragmatist or positivist variety of it) readily take up Peirce's fallibil- ism, though they usually avoid the religious conclusions that Peirce derived from it. "Peirce's fallibilism," writes E. Nagel, "has nothing to do with the malicious scepticism which rejects science on the 48</page><page sequence="17">Science and Religion in Peirce's Philosophy ground that its conclusions are after all not established as being beyond the possibility of error The conception which for Peirce served as a defense of religion, some modern bourgeois "philosophers of science*' take up without any hesitation as a purely scientific one. They do not differentiate between the two trends of Peirce's fallibilism, they do not notice the profound contradiction of his doctrine and claim that "fallibil- ism cannot be separated from the scientific method/118 But in reality fallibilism is like the two-faced Janus. One face of it is turned toward science, the other toward religion. Peirce's fall- ibilism is not only one side of the scientific method, but also a means of making science "harmless," a form of denial of the objective value of scientific theories. Summarizing Peirce's views about science and the scientific me- thod, we must recognize their dual nature and the contradiction of all his statements about these problems. The progressive scientific trend in his views is constantly alternating with antiscientific, ideal- istic, relativistic considerations which frequently annihilate those reasonable ideas which he had. It is true that Peirce, on the whole, has done not a little for a man who was burdened down with anti- materialistic and theistic prejudices. But this truly titanic work to which Peirce devoted almost half a century of his life, together with his many-sided capabilities and tremendous erudition, could have achieved more. Looking into the laboratory of Peirce's thought we see a constant searching, a ceaseless experimentation by a completely honest and well-meaning scientist; we see how he struggled with the problems the road to whose solution he himself blocked by insurmountable hindrances. Peirce wanted to achieve a harmony of science and re- ligion at any cost, and he had to pay a very high price for this hopeless endeavor. Peirce's teaching and works testify convincingly to the fact that the philosophy which tries to defend religion and is hostile to ma- terialism inevitably comes into conflict with science. Can Peirce's teaching strengthen the positions of modern prag- matism? Hardly. To the extent that Peirce was a pragmatist his views did not contain an ounce of scientific character. But to the 49</page><page sequence="18">Transactions of The Peirce Society extent that Peirce remained a scientist, his ideas were as far from pragmatism as science is from religion. Peirce's fate is tragic but instructive. It should make many West- ern scientists take pause. Because in our time, during the irreconcil- able ideological struggle, one cannot, even less than during Peirce's day, hope that one can simultaneously be on the side of scientific development and of religious superstition, on the side of social progress and of ideological and political reaction.
