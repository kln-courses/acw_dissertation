<plain_text><page sequence="1">Yosef Ben-Shlomo THE SPIRITUAL UNIVERSE OF GERSHOM SCHOLEM On February 20, 1982, Gershom Scholem died in Jerusalem at the age of eighty-four. The reactions to his death probably surprised many people in Israel, where he was not well-known by the media, refrained from signing political petitions and wrote very few popular articles during his sixty years in Eretz Israel. And yet, when the news of his death became known, 'the doorposts trembled', to quote from an article in one news- paper. Not only were the President of the State, Israeli government ministers and public figures of all stripes present at his funeral, but there were also people who came especially from abroad (among them, the West German Minister of Education), and the world's press reported on the event. And all this despite the fact that Gershom Scholem was a scholar of Kabbalah-the Jewish esoteric teaching-a subject which is presumably of interest only to Jews, and to only a very few at that; yet for several decades Scholem has enjoyed a high reputation throughout the cultural world. His Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism has been translated into English, German, French, Italian and Portugese, and, together with his other books on Kabbalah and Sabbatianism, is to be found in circles whose primary interest is not Judaism or mysticism. He won prestigious international awards, was elected a member of scholarly academies in various countries, and books and articles were written in his lifetime about his teachings and about his person, i.e., he was an individual who was regarded as one of the greatest figures in Western culture in our generation. Some time ago an article appeared in New York Times in which Scholem was described as'one of the great molders of contempo- rary thought, and perhaps one of the most daring spiritual adventurers of our generation'. His influence on our generation was compared to that of Freud, and quotations were cited from those who thought that 'the tremendous work of Gershom Scholem embraces Freud's discoveries, just as the sea covers the icebergs'. The international reputation of Scholem's work is a notable example of the principle that only through work in the area of a particular culture within a national framework can one attain a supra-national status and rise to achievements of international importance (another example of 21</page><page sequence="2">Yosef Ben-Shlomo this phenomenon is S.Y. Agnon, whose work was more deeply rooted in the Jewish culture, language and tradition than that of any other Hebrew writer, and yet he was the only one to win the highest international recognition). Here, we shall summarize some of Scholem's achievements and examine some of his ideas on Judaism and Zionism. Scholem's work is a splendid phenomenon of our time: the creation almost ex nihilo by a single man of a whole new area of research-the area of Jewish mysticism. Until the appearance of Scholem, this was the most neglected area of Jewish studies. Even those scholars who concerned themselves with the subject approached it with prejudices which ex- pressed themselves both in the standard of research and limited compass of the sources investigated, and the same applied to those few who related positively to the subject (including some non-Jews who were drawn to Kabbalah as a source of the mysteries of early Christianity), but whose romantic enthusiasm beclouded the scholarly exactitude of their ap- proach. Scholem's advent changed this situation completely. With Scholem, Jewish mysticism became for the first time a subject for exact scientific investigation free from bias or apologetics and without enthusiasms which were not based on a solid foundation of scholarship. Scholem was the first to discover and identify many Kabbalistic texts which lay buried in manuscript collections, some of which will provide material for years to come for investigation. In his scholarly work, Scholem revealed an unusual combination of an amazing mastery of the material and a scrupulous exactitude of philological detail with a pene- trating grasp of the profound ideas of the Kabbalah. To this was coupled an understanding of Kabbalah's many-faceted symbolism, and a severely critical historical approach which, nonetheless, included an inspired and imaginative perception of the broad conceptual and historiosophical context It is this particular combination of qualities which made Scholem's work so important, passing beyond the frontiers of Jewish thought until it became a matter of interest to historians of religion in general and of mysticism in particular, to psychologists like Carl Jung and to philoso- phers and historians of ideas. It should be pointed out that the situation today is different from that which existed before the appearance of Scholem. The study of Kabbalah has become a kind of 'fashion' both in Israel and in the world at large, and many books have been written in various languages about Kabbalah and philosophy, Kabbalah and psychoanalysis and even Kabbalah and literary criticism. Departments for the study of Kabbalah and Hassidism have been founded in universities. Writers and artists, both in Israel and abroad, draw on Kabbalistic symbols and motifs and Kabbalistic works, and strange groups and academic courses which present the Kabbalah in a popular and superficial form, advocating easy paths to the redemption of the soul via 'meditations' etc. abound, and even magic and sorcery have 22</page><page sequence="3">The Universe of Gershom Scholem sprung up like mushrooms after rain. Scholem naturally kept his distance from this fashion which provided a fertile breeding-ground for charlatans and imposters, since the Kabbalah, like mysticism in general, contains profound teachings on God and the universe, on man, his spirit, his life and his death. The path to redemption it proposes is not a short and simple one but involves a deep understanding of the mysteries of ex- istence and a constant effort of the will and an activation of the powers of the soul. It also includes what is known as Kabbalah ma'asit ('practical Kabbalah')-the use of amulets, magical incantations, etc., but these are generally marginal aspects of Kabbalah and all the great Kabbalists warned that they are only of secondary importance in relation to the speculative teachings which aim to impart a true understanding of the divine and human reality. This unimportant aspect of the Kabbalah was undoubtedly one of the reasons for the hostile and depreciatory attitude shown towards it by the first scholars of Jewish studies and the maskilim ('enlightened') from the end of the eighteenth century onwards, but there was also a deeper reason for their hostile attitude, as we shall see. This critical attitude, moreover, stood in blatant contradiction to the place held by Kabbalah in the Jewish religion for seven hundred years, from the twelfth century to the period of the Haskalah. During that time, the Kabbalah was thought to be the true esoteric teaching of Judaism, and with very few exceptions all the great Jewish scholars treated it with great respect (many were Kabbalists themselves). This attitude existed in all the various Jewish communities, and even in groups which were opposed to one another like the Hassidim and the Mitnagdim (at the head of both groups were major Kabbalists like Rabbi Schneur Zalman of Lyady, the founder of Habad, and Rabbi Elijah, the Vilna Gaon), and in the whole Jewish Diaspora, from Yemen to Poland, in which the Kabbalah spread especially after the sixteenth century. The nineteenth-century maskilim radically changed this attitude to the Kabbalah. Their attack upon the Jewish esoteric teachings formed part of their struggle against traditional Rabbinic Judaism, and in this they were joined by the German Orthodox Jews who shared with them a certain historical and philosophical approach to Judaism which prede- termined their attitude to mysticism. The outstanding representative of this approach was the historian Heinrich Graetz, whose monumental work The History of the Jews reflected certain prejudices concerning the definition or essence of Judaism which predetermined what did or did not belong to 'true Judaism'. This essence appeared to the maskilim to be identical with the rationalist trend, whose great representative in the Middle Ages was the Rambam (Maimonides). According to this criterion, however, whatever does not fit a'religion of reason' is not'authentically' Jewish but comes from outside Judaism and represents only marginal 23</page><page sequence="4">Yosef Ben-Shlomo groups in Jewish history. The maskilim described the opposition between rationalist philosophy and mysticism and Kabbalah as a struggle between representatives of the Haskalah and 'obscurantists', reactionary 'rebels against the light' who rejected the truth. Thus they projected into the past their own struggles in the nineteenth century against Orthodox rab- binical Judaism, Hassidism and the East European Jewish masses sunk in superstition who were unwilling to receive the 'light of Haskalah'. Thus Graetz portrayed the Kabbalah in the Middle Ages as a dark reaction to the rationalism of the Rambam, and he called the Zohar (the Book of Splendor) the 'great book of lies'. We will not dwell here on Graetz's historical errors and on the im- possibility of dividing the representatives of Judaism into 'good' and 'bad' (great figures of supreme importance from the 'rational' standpoint, such as the Rambam [Maimonides], Rabbi Joseph Caro, the Vilna Gaon and other rabbis who were also major Kabbalists, simply cannot be sub- jected to this categorization). We will merely indicate the chief mistake of his approach: namely, that the Kabbalah was not only a reaction against rationalist philosophy but offered a different approach to all metaphysi- cal and religious subjects, and the real struggle was between two alterna- tive approaches of equal weight and depth (and in several important respects, the second approach was deeper than the first). Moreover, the historical influence of the Kabbalah was in the long run greater than that of rationalist philosophy, which was always the realm of only a few. Kabbalistic symbols and customs were organically incorporated into the life of the general Jewish community: customs such as the Kabbalat Shabbat (the welcoming of the Sabbath) and Sabbath piyyutim-liturgical hymns -such as Lecha Dodi, which became part of the Jewish liturgy, the tikkun leil shavout (the night liturgy of Shavout), the tikkun hatzot (midnight prayer), the hillula de-Rabbi Shimeon Bar Yochai on Lag ba-Omer (the Lag ba-Omer festivity in Meron)- all these derive from the Kabbalah and es- pecially from that of Safed in the sixteenth century, and are connected with Kabbalistic symbolism. Kabbalistic teachings were also at the root of powerful movements in Jewish history like Sabbatianism and Hassidism which in various ways determined the historical development of the Jewish people in recent centuries. The recognition of these facts was the almost exclusive achievement of Gershom Scholem who came to Jewish studies without any preconcep- tion about what is legitimate or illegitimate in Judaism, and with a desire to relate to historical phenomena as they were, without prejudging them as'positive' or'negative'. As a result, Scholem made the first breakthrough towards an objective study of the non-rationalist trends in Judaism and their place in Jewish history, and thus restored to Jewish historiography the balance which had been upset by the approach of the Haskalah, and at 24</page><page sequence="5">The Universe of Gershom Scholem the same time revealed the importance of mystical and Kabbalistic doc- trines and symbols from the point of view of the history and study of religions in general. The negative attitude to Kabbalah also affected the condition of Kabbalistic studies, insofar as they existed, before Scholem appeared. As an example of that condition, Scholem said that when he began to take an interest in Kabbalah he visited one of Graetz's pupils who was reputed to be an authority on the subject, and when the young Scholem marvelled at his library and asked him if he had read the Kabbalistic works that were in it, he answered, 'What? am I supposed to read this rubbish too?' Even those who presented the Kabbalah in the positive light were in many cases charlatans who approached the subject without any proper scientific grounding. Thus, for instance, at the beginning of this century a French translation of the Zohar was published (by a man who presented himself as an Albanian nobleman, but who was in reality an apostate from Poland) which received prizes, honors and critical acclaim, and scholars of the history of religion used it as an authoritative source, although nobody checked the accuracy of the translation or of the thousands of notes which accompanied it. The translator not only tried to insert into the Book of the Zohar the beliefs of Christianity but also added to the translation hundreds of pages of fake quotations from the books of the Kabbalah and even from works which never existed. When Scholem discovered the forgeries, he was asked, 'How do you know that these books never existed, or that no editions of Kabbalistic works exist which contain the hundreds of quotations which you claim are forgeries?' Such was the situation when Scholem launched on the study of the Kabbalah. But before we see how he came to this study, we ought to become acquainted with the personal background which led to his taking an interest in Judaism as such. It was a long story, of which we shall relate only the gist (it is told in detail in his autobiography mi-Berlin Lirusha- layim).l It is the story of a young man who revolted against his environ- ment and his period and transcended them through the force of his personality and his independence of mind: a man who already in his youth had made a clear decision to pursue a Jewish and Zionist path, a path which'appeared to them to be singularly direct and illuminated by clear signposts'. SCHOLEM'S ROAD TO JUDAISM Scholem was born in 1897 to a family which was almost completely di- vorced from Judaism, which had been replaced by an enthusiastic Ger- man patriotism. His father forbade the use of Yiddish in the home, went</page><page sequence="6">Yosef Ben-Shlomo to work in his printing-press on the Day of Atonement and at Christmas decorated his home with a Christmas tree (beneath which young Scholem, when he began to learn Hebrew, found a portrait of Herzl as a Christmas- present from his mother'because you are so interested in Zionism', she said). Scholem's revolt against his paternal home was a reaction against the self-abasement of this totally assimilated Jewry, an expression of Jew- ish pride which rejected an apologetic attitude towards the Gentile world. He claimed that this approach, which developed in him during his youth, indirectly influenced his work as a scholar later on, which was accom- plished 'without turning to look and see "what the Gentiles would say."'2 Similarly, Scholem was not overly dismayed by the crude, aggressive manifestations of anti-Semitism which began to appear in the 1920's. 'I was little affected by this,' he wrote, 'for I had long since made my deci- sion to leave Germany. But it was frightening to encounter the blindness of the Jews who refused to see and acknowledge all that3 and saw it as a passing phenomenon' (Scholem recalls here the reprehensible behavior of the philosopher Max Scheler-'one of the most distinguished philo- sophical minds of his time'-who resorted to all kinds of subterfuges in order to conceal his Jewish extraction). The bitter reckoning with the so- called 'Jewish-German symbiosis' Scholem made later in his essay: 'Against the Myth of the German-Jewish Dialogue'. It was not anti-Semitism which brought Scholem to Judaism and Zionism, but'a strong feeling and love for the Judaism of the past and present' which was already aroused in him before he had reached the age of fourteen after he happened to read Graetz's work which we have men- tioned. He decided to learn Hebrew and to visit a synagogue, and he later began to study the Talmud with an Orthodox rabbi and joined a Zionist youth movement. This aroused the anger of his father, who finally drove him out of the house. Scholem's revolt against his father's home was a rebellion against the whole atmosphere of assimilation which was prevalent among German Jewry and which he perceived as 'pro- gressive deterioration of... Jewish identity' and characterized as a dia- lectical combination of 'a desire for self-relinquishment with a desire for human dignity and loyalty to one's own self (p. 25). These two aspirations were united in the hope of 'full integration and absorption into the German people'. This hope seemed to Scholem even then, before the rise of Nazism, a phenomenon of tremendous 'self-deception'. Scholem claimed that his encounter with this assimilationist self-deception was one of the decisive experiences of his youth. He was struck by the terrible contra- diction between the lack of discrimination of the majority of Jews in all matters concerning themselves and the faculty for reasoning, criticism and vision which others have justifiably admired or criticized in them (cf.. p. 26). Likewise, Socialism and Communism, which attracted some of the best Jewish youth (including Scholem's brother, who was elected a delegate 26</page><page sequence="7">The Universe of Gershom Scholem to the Reichstag and later killed by the Germans in a concentration camp)-did not seem to Scholem to provide a solution to the Jewish problem. He felt that an enthusiasm for universalistic socialist ideas and for movements for liberation of 'humanity' involving a renunciation of Jewish national rights-that too was merely part of Jewish self-deception and it eventually became clear how right he was in this respect. When he was thrown out of his father's house, Scholem went to live with a group of Jews from Russia and Eastern Europe, including Zalman (Rubashov) Shazar, later to become the third President of Israel. Jews like S.Y. Agnon, Bialik, Ahad Ha-Am and others, with whom he later became acquainted, revealed to him a whole world of vital and living Judaism which was almost unknown to assimilated Western Jewry. He continued to study the sources of Judaism privately with Talmudic scholars, since at that time there were no academic institutions for the serious study of Judaism. At the same time he broadened his general education, especially in philosophy, and began academic studies in mathe- matics and physics, which he thought of teaching in a high-school when he emigrated to Israel. In his study of classical Jewish literature, he was repeatedly con- fronted with a lack of people and tools of scholarship which could help him in understanding Jewish mysticism, a neglected area of Jewish studies whose existence could nevertheless not be denied. Scholem found it somewhat difficult to explain the motivation which impelled him to interest himself specifically in the area of mysticism and Kabbalah. But the fact is that despite the deep impression which Graetz's work made on him, he was unable to accept the historian's negative attitude to the Kabbalah and his characterization of the Kabbalists as charlatans, buf- foons, etc. Scholem had a vague feeling that'something' lay hidden in the Kabbalah which had been so much despised by the maskilim, and he was attracted by this 'something'; perhaps it was precisely this general opposi- tion to the subject which aroused his curiousity about this area which no one in his time was capable of explaining to him (and the religious Jews who studied Kabbalah as a revelation of truth would certainly not have been willing to do so). But the beginning of Scholem's interest in Jewish mysticism, when he was only seventeen years old, was connected to a basic urge he felt until his last days: the urge to understand and decipher the enigma of Jewish history. 'The existence of the Jews over the millenia', he wrote, 'is an enigma no matter what the numerous "explanations" may say'.4 One of the answers to that question, as everyone agrees, is the unbroken continuity of the Halakah (practical codification of the Law) which pro- vides a common basis for all generations of Jews in all the areas of their dispersion, over and above all the geographical, social and philosophical differences between them. But Scholem was also troubled by a further 27</page><page sequence="8">Yosef Ben-Shlomo question: is the Halakah really possible without a mystical foundation? Does it not contain within itself an inner life which has enabled it to survive undiminished for thousands of years? And indeed, over a long period, Scholem in his researches revealed a profound connection be- tween Halakhah and the various forms of Kabbalah, as we shall see. The ambition to find one of the hidden keys to the solution of the riddle of Jewish history brought Scholem to decide to change his plan of academic study. He shifted to the Department of Semitic Languages and Philosophy at the University of Munich, and there he decided to write his doctoral thesis on the oldest Kabbalistic text we have- the Bahir (Book of Brightness) which suddenly appeared in the South of France at the end of the twelfth century, but whose sources are undoubtedly older. Scholem translated this text into German and based his commentaries on the earliest manuscript in the library at Munich. Naturally, there was nobody in the university capable of directing him in his work and certainly no one who could assess it, and so Scholem received his doctorate within the framework of the study of ancient Semitic languages. In 1923 Scholem emigrated to Palestine (unlike a great many Zionists and their leaders who remained in exile, he believed in self-fulfillment), and earned his living as a librarian in the National Library. In 1925 he was appointed lecturer at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where he raised up three generations of pupils-scholars in Kabbalah as well as other spheres of Judaism and in the general humanities. The Bibliog- raphy of the Writings of Gershom Scholem published in his honor on his eightieth birthday (Jerusalem [Magnes Press] 1977) contains more than five hundred items. THE KABBALISTIC DOCTRINE OF THE DEITY Here is clearly not the place for an exhaustive discussion of the Kabbalah, but we shall mention a few of its basic ideas. We shall begin with a de- scription of the general conceptual background of the Kabbalah. Medieval Jewish philosophy (like its Christian and Muslim counter- parts) was born of the attempt to combine the philosophical concept of God (which was derived from Greek philosophy) with the image of God which appears in the Scriptures. In this attempt to combine religion and philosophy, God was perceived as the 'first cause' of all that exists, but He was attributed no personal characteristics. He was nothing but the ab- solute infinite essence which was a logical precondition for any finite es- sence, and His dealings with the universe were not expressed in the exercise of His will. This concept of God stands in open contradiction to the living God of religion, creator and sustainer of the universe, who re- veals His will to men and His requirements of them, who receives their 28</page><page sequence="9">The Universe of Gershom Scholem prayers and watches over the world and metes out reward and punish- ment, directs human history, possesses the attributes of mercy and judge- ment and shows anger and love-in one word, the personal God. The Jewish philosophers (particularly the Rambam in his Guide of the Per- plexed), the Christians and the Muslims all attempted in various ways to modify the philosophical concept of God in order to bring it into harmony with the image of the personal God, but they were unable to overcome the discrepancy between the 'God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob' and the 'God of the philosophers'. As against the philosophical concept of God, the Kabbalist put for- ward a completely different concept, which at the same time was intended to solve the problem confronting the theologians. To a certain extent, the Kabbalists concurred with the philosophical requirement of divesting the concept of God of all materiality and anthropomorphism, but they went beyond it. Thus, one of the Kabbalists said about the philosophers: "Our feet are where their head is', or, in other words, 'We begin where they end'. According to the Kabbalistic doctrine of God, the absolute, infinite God beyond all human description whom the philosophers speak about is indeed one aspect of God-the invisible side, hidden deep in the purity of His essence and devoid of personal characteristics. The Kabbal- ists called this hidden aspect Ein-Sof (infinity) and did not refer to it by any of the accepted names of God (the Holy One, Blessed be He, Elohim, etc.), and not even by the Ineffable Name. Insofar as the Kabbalists spoke about this aspect, they took great pains, even more than the philosophers, not to endow it with a personal character. They called it ha-ahdut ha- shavah (the equal unity), ha-metzi'ut ha-gedola (the great reality), shoresh kol ha-shorashim (the root of all roots), ma she-ein ha-mahshavah maseget (that which-not even he whom-thought cannot conceive), ha-davar ha- ne'elam (that which is not revealed) and other similar titles which do not describe any positive characteristics. Concerning this side of the Deity, one of the Kabbalists said daringly: 'Know that the Ein-Sofis not hinted at either in the Torah or in the Prophets or in the other Scriptures, nor in the words of the Sages, but the mystics have received some slight intima- tion of it'. But that is only one side of the Deity, and to the mystic, as to religious people in general, it is the other side that is all-important-the one that is spoken about and is described in the Scriptures and the writings of the Sages, and that side is described in the Kabbalah as a dynamic and or- ganic entity of ten divine forces known as Sefirot (spheres). This entity constitutes the revealed and active side of the godhead. The Sefirot are ratzon (will [of God]), hochma (wisdom), hesed (lovingkindness), gevurah (power), etc. These attributes or forces of the godhead are qualities ema- nating from the Ein-Sof; they are derived from it without revealing its hidden essence. This 'dualistic' concept of the Deity may be understood 29</page><page sequence="10">Yosef Ben-Shlomo by means of an analogy used by the Kabbalists: every man is revealed to others through various characteristics, ways of behaving and actions expressing thoughts and feelings (these can even contradict one another, the same man can both love and hate, show anger and compassion, etc.), but all these are merely the expression of his particular personality, in the brief experience of a rare intimate personal contact (in the same way, perhaps, as one can experience the elusive reality of the Ein-Sof in the mystical experience). At the same time, however, one can say that these characteristics, actions, etc., truly express this personality. Their multi- plicity, and even their inherent contradictions, do not affect the unity of the personality expressed in them, but contact with it can only be made by means of its revealed character traits, actions, etc., which together constitute a dynamic and living entity, a psychophysical and spiritual organism, each of whose manifestations reveals a certain aspect which can only be understood in the context of the whole. The lesson to be understood is clear. The totality of the revealed attributes and actions constitutes,the personal aspect of the Deity through which the world and mankind maintain their contact with God-that is to say, it is the totality of the Sefirot. But beyond it there always remains another aspect which is hidden, obscure, unknowable, and that is the Ein- Sof. The danger of misconstruing this doctrine of the Deity lies in seeing the two aspects of the godhead as separate entities or in attributing a separate existence to the world of the Sefirot, or to each one of them (an error which the Kabbalists call kitzutz ha-neti'ot 'cutting plants'). From the analogy we have drawn it can be seen that the inner personality and its revealed characteristics are not two separate entities, and its contradictory actions and feelings, such as love and hatred, do not introduce a fragmen- tation into the personality. The same applies to the relationship between that Ein-Sof and the Sefirot. Many Kabbalists used another analogy to explain this relationship: the Sefirot are connected to the Ein-Sof in the same way that'the flame is united with the burning coals'. The flame has no existence apart from the coals, but it is only by means of the flame that the active power of the coals is manifested: it gives light, burns, has many functions. On the other hand, the flame has no independent existence apart from the coals, and all its strength is derived from them, and the coals-which in themselves are inactive-do have an existence which does not depend upon the flame. Thus the Ein-Sof has a supremacy over the Sefirot, but in reality it functions only through the Sefirot which reveal its power. THE KABBALISTIC LANGUAGE OF SYMBOLS As against the Ein-Sof, which cannot be described in positive attributes, 30</page><page sequence="11">The Universe of Gershom Scholem the order of the Sefirot can indeed be described in a human language: the language of symbolism, which encompasses the whole of the religious language that we use. All that is written in the Scriptures, in the prayers, etc., also applies to the self-revealing God: that is to say, to the world of the Sefirot. Here the great strength of the Kabbalah is revealed. Not only are the biblical descriptions a symbol of the forces of the godhead but also the whole of existence, every event which takes place, every human action can be given a symbolic significance which connects it with the upper world. Here we cannot exhaustively examine this rich and varied world of symbols, but we will mention only one aspect of them: the first three Sefi- rot, whose names are keter (crown) or ratzon (will), hochma (wisdom) and bi- nah (intelligence), symbolize the spiritual powers of the soul with which it decides on actions, concentrates and carries them out, while the seven lesser Sefirot-gedula (greatness) or hesed (lovingkindness), gevura (power) or din (judgment), tiferet (beauty) or tahamin (compassion), netzah (eter- nity), hod (majesty), yesod (foundation), and malchut (kingdom) or shechina (Divine Presence)-which constitute triangular structures of two oppo- sites plus a synthesis between them hesed, lovingkindness and din, judge- ment, and their harmonious union in rahamim, compassion; and netzah, eternity and hod, majesty, and their union in yesod, (foundation) represent the organs of the human body. Gedula (greatness) and gevura (power) symbolize the right hand and the left, tiferet (beauty) the spinal cord or heart, netzah (eternity) and hod (majesty) the two legs, yesod (foundation) the male organ, and malchut (kingdom) represents the female. This is a symbolism which daringly interprets the biblical account of the creation of man in the image of God, and it bestows a mystical significance on every action which a man performs with his body, and first and foremost on the practical commandments performed by a Jew. Here the erotic symbolism is important, and the relationship between the various forces in the divine entity, and especially between the sixth (beauty) and the ninth (foundation) Sefirot (called the Holy One, Blessed be He) and the tenth Sefira described as relationships of love and sexual union. More- over, the erotic relationship between man and woman symbolically echoes this divine dynamic. Obviously, the Kabbalists did not believe that God has a material shape nor that He performs physical actions, but they expressed the very deep idea that there is some kind of structural parallelism between the world above and this world, and that therefore we can learn from material phenomena about the structure and laws of the world above, in which such phenomena exist in a purely spiritual form. From this viewpoint, the symbolism of the human body is only one example-albeit an especially important one- of the symbolic significance of the whole of existence. The divine light illuminates and is reflected in everything in the world, and 31</page><page sequence="12">Yosef Ben-Shlomo the penetrating eyes of the mystic see it beneath the coarse material clothing. One can easily imagine how shocked the advocates of rationalist phi- losophy must have been by material descriptions like those the Kabbalists gave of God, (the Zohar, for example, is full of very explicit ones, like the detailed descriptions of the organs of the 'male principle' in God and of his sexual union with the 'female principle'). They saw this as a primitive approach and did not understand the symbolic and mythological use of language (today these are much better understood). They failed to appreci- ate the great religious achievement represented by this doctrine of the Deity, and from this point of view it was the conservative and 'reactionary' Kabbalists and not the philosophers who were the daring revolutionaries in religious thought. For in contrast to philosophy, whose doctrines, by their very nature, spoke only to a few, the Kabbalah-despite the fact that its teachings were no less deep and no easier for the 'masses' to understand than those of philosophy- was far more suited for interpreta- tion on different levels, including the most popular level, for its doctrines were expressed not only in abstract concepts but also in concrete symbols. Its use of parallel symbolism not only corresponded to the deepest needs of the religious consciousness, both the primitive and the highly-de- veloped, but it raised up structures of thought and religious imagination which are also to be found in other religions. The divine image pre- sented in the Kabbalah is nearer than the philosophical concept of the Deity to the living God of religion, and there is no doubt that the Kab- balists were closer than the philosophers to an understanding of the nature of religious language. Material descriptions of the Deity occur in the Scriptures and are revealed in the Kabbalah as a legitimate and even essential means of expressing a spiritual, religious content, whereas these descriptions caused the philosophers a dissatisfaction which they at- tempted to overcome in ways whose apologetic intentions were only too obvious. This achievement of the language of symbols reached its climax in the Kabbalah's approach to human actions and the performance of the mitzvot (religious commandments). It was from this that it chiefly derived its hold on Judaism, for here it linked up with the central factor in Jewish history-Halakah. Scholem's supposition of a deep connection between Kabbalah and Halakah proved to be correct. In Kabbalistic teaching, the world of Halakah is the practical framework in which man operates not only in our world but in the worlds above. Every detail of the practical mitzvot has a symbolic significance, and its correct fulfillment affects the condition of the system of Sefirot, and hence the conditions of our world, for our world exists only on account of the abundance of vitality which proceeds from it. Moreover, the divine system requires the activity of men: it derives its power from it, and it is by this means that it is able to 32</page><page sequence="13">The Universe of Gershom Scholem bestow blessings upon our world. Every mitzvah thus becomes an event of cosmic significance, an act which touches the dynamics of the universe. The Jew becomes the leading figure in the drama of the universe; he pulls the strings behind the scenes. This understanding of the significance of the practical mitzvot stands, moreover, in complete contrast to the un- derstanding of the Rambam, who explains the mitzvot through educational and moral-social arguments, and some of them (such as the mitzvot known as'laws' and the sacrifices) are even explained as being derived from cer- tain historical circumstances. Such an approach, invalidating in effect the metaphysical weight of the mitzvot, is hardly likely to arouse the enthusi- asm of the believer in performing them, and fails to harmonize with the all-important position of Halakah in Judaism. The Kabbalists' approach to certain subjects also satisfied the spiritual needs of the Jew and answered the questions which troubled him. This was particularly true with regard to the problem of evil and suffering in the universe. While the rationalist philosophers tried to minimize the gravity of the problem, the Kabbalists treated the reality of evil in the universe with great seriousness and saw it as a consequence of happenings within the world of the divinity itself. These happenings, connected with the inner tension between 'lovingkindness' and 'judgement' in the system of the Sefirot, cause a crystallization of the forces of evil (sitra ahra, the other side) which are the supreme source of evil and suffering in our world, and between them and the forces of good and sanctity there is a perpetual struggle. In this connection, the historical destiny of the Jewish people is also given a metaphysical significance. The sufferings of the Jewish people in exile are seen as the result of a disturbance in the system of the Sefirot, and thus the longing for redemption does not belong to Israel alone, but also to part of the upper world which is also exiled and captive to the supreme forces of evil. THE FEMININE SYMBOL Here it is worth lingering (a little, at any rate) over one of the Sefirot: the tenth one. In their understanding of this Sefira the Kabbalists united two of the most important concepts in Jewish tradition previous to the Kab- balah (in the literature of the Aggadah and the Midrash), and these are the Shechinah (the Divine Presence) and the Knesset Israel (the people of Is- rael). In the earlier literature these two concepts were completely sepa- rate: the Shechinah was the name given to God's presence in the world, while Knesset Israel was the personification of the people of Israel, whose relations with the Holy One, Blessed be He are described as relations be- tween the lover and the beloved, with all the many aspects of such a rela- tionship (hence also the traditional interpretation of the Song of Songs as 33</page><page sequence="14">Yosef Ben-Shlomo an allegory of the relationships between the Holy One, Blessed be He and the Knesset Israel). The Kabbalists united these two concepts into a single symbol of great power: the tenth Sefira, which is both the Shechinah and Knesset Israel at the same time. This symbol incorporates within itself all the significances and associations which were traditionally attached either to the Shechinah on the one hand or to the Knesset Israel on the other. On the one hand, the Shechinah becomes the symbolic participation of part of the divinity itself in the historical process by means of the people of Israel, and on the other hand the historical people of Israel re- ceives a metaphysical status as a symbol of one of the divine forces-the tenth Sefira. This Sefira represents the historical destiny of the people of Israel in the divine system: an important historiosophical idea whose influence on the development of the Kabbalah and on Judaism in general has been enormous. Thus, the Kabbalah took the daring step of including a feminine aspect in the image of the Jewish God, inasmuch as the Knesset Israel is depicted in feminine images and symbols (queen, bride, wife of one's youth, daughter of Zion, etc.). Now, all the erotic descriptions-beginning with the Bible-of the relationship between the Knesset Israel and the Holy One, Blessed be He were interpreted as forming part of the system of relationships within the divinity itself: i.e., they represented the rela- tionship between the sixth and ninth Sefirot, symbolizing the male prin- ciple in God, and the tenth Sefira, symbolizing the female principle in God. It is the spiritual union between them which is the source of fruit- fulness in the world and which brings souls into existence (just as the physical union of man and woman brings the body into existence), and when, as a result of human sin, there is a division between them, the source of fruitfulness is closed up and the Shechinah is banished from her husband, or, in other words, is sent into exile, and then the people of Israel in our world also goes into exile. It is therefore incumbent upon the Jew to do all in his power to reunite the Sefirot and to restore the internal harmony of the upper world, and as a result of this process re- demption will also come about. In their mystical intent, all the mitzvot envisage 'the union of the Holy One, Blessed be He and His Shechinah', and every detail of them serves this purpose. UNDERSTANDING JEWISH HISTORY These are merely brief outlines of a few basic ideas in Kabbalah which Scholem first revealed to the world (they obviously cannot give an ade- quate idea of the great riches to be found in Kabbalistic literature). But although Scholem pursued historical research on Jewish mysticism as a limited and specialized field, that field was revealed by means of this 34</page><page sequence="15">The Universe of Gershom Scholem research to be a model and a key to the understanding of Jewish history. The Kabbalah and its history were transformed by Scholem into a medium whereby Jewish history was perceived as a dramatic process in which various and even contradictory spiritual forces are at work, and at the same time as an organic, dynamic continuity in which the boldest and most revolutionary tendencies played a part. Scholem's starting point in investigating the Kabbalah was, as we have seen, the rejection of all pre- suppositions concerning 'legitimate' Judaism. As a consequence of this point of departure not only was there a change in the general attitude to Kabbalah and in the evaluation of it but every dogmatic approach to Judaism, whether 'Orthodox' or secular, was uprooted. Judaism is pre- sented in Scholem's work as a historical phenomenon of constantly chang- ing form which at the same time possesses an independent identity, which does not lend itself to clear and unambiguous definition, and whose fate cannot be predetermined. This picture of Judaism as a dynamic process is self-evident from Scholem's study of history, but he also gave it conscious expression. Scholem compared the secret of the existence and survival of the Jewish people with all its various layers and strata over three thousand years to the secret of an individual's existence, which cannot be defined according to any fixed rule: 'It does not lend itself to rational analysis', he said, 'for one cannot fathom the secret of this existence. Just as one cannot fathom the existence of a private individual, so I cannot fathom the secret of the existence of this people as an individual living body.' In his several decades of teaching, Scholem expressed personal ideas of this kind, outside the scope of his objective scientific studies, only on very rare occasions. When pressed to express his ideas openly he always answered that these were to be found in his writings'between the lines'. In his last years, however, he did give direct expression to his personal beliefs and also to his ideas on topical issues of Judaism and Zionism. His statements on these subjects are chiefly to be found in Sichah Im Mechanchim (Talks With Educators,5 from which we have taken these quotations) and in his book Devarim Be-Go.6 'Personally,' he said, 'I believe in the existence of absolute values, as I believe in God' (Sichah Im Mechanchim). He also believed in the impossibility of a purely secular morality: 'Morality as a constructive force is impossible without religion. . . . this is an utter illusion of philosophers, not to speak of sociologists',7 for, with- out God, values or morals of real validity do not exist. For this reason, Scholem saw atheism as a point of view implying an absence of values and an absence of constraining moral power. 'I don't understand atheists', he said; 'I never did, [not as a young man and not as an old one]. I think atheism is understandable only if you accept the rule of unbridled passions, a life without values.'8 Scholem's religiousness was not'Orthodox' in the accepted sense. He 35</page><page sequence="16">Yosef Ben-Shlomo did not take upon himself all the religious and halakhic forms which had been created in the past. But he held that the outward forms were necessary in order to express the inner content of religion (in this he was of a different opinion than Martin Buber). This was true, as we have seen, in the case of Jewish mysticism, and so, he felt, it must be with the historical existence of Judaism itself. But the religious forms in which Judaism is expressed passed through changes and transformations, and although Scholem did not accept all the practices of the past, he believed in a 'living Judaism' and he was certain that there were 'utopian aspects which have not yet been revealed in it'. New forms would be created, but something would remain in them from the past. Of that new world of forms, he wrote: 'I am not sure that that will be a world of the Shulchan Aruch-but that is not out of the question'. Scholem believed in certain dialectical laws in Jewish history: i.e., every important phenomenon in Jewish history which is materialized in life and thought is not completely displaced by another phenomenon, even if it is contrary to it, but some- thing of it remains and it may be elevated onto another plane. Thus, there is no clear and unambiguous negation, but reality itself develops through an interplay of positive and negative elements, through the con- tradictions that exist within it. These dialectical laws-the same 'hidden' laws that are at work in Judaism-operated also in the main phenomenon of Jewish history in our time: secularism. In Scholem's opinion, a complete secularization of Israel is impossible, but secularism is nevertheless a necessary stage in the historical development of the Jewish people. It is necessary in order to bring the Jewish people back into history by means of the movement of national rebirth, which Scholem saw as a transition to a higher stage. That stage would not exactly be the traditional Judaism of the past, but it was impossible that it would be secular. Scholem did not believe 'in a world of total secularism in which the religious factor will not manifest itself with redoubled strength.'9 This dialectical approach resembles that of Rav Kook who also saw secularism and modern Zionism as an essential stage in the return to Judaism, although in his case, of course, he saw it as a return to the world of practical mitzvot in its entirety. Scholem also applied this dialectical approach to Zionism. In his work on the messianic idea and on Sabbatianism, Scholem pointed out the high price which the Jewish people had to pay for the messianic idea which it had given to the world. The belief in the metaphysical dimension of redemption had reduced it to a condition of weakness and impotence with regard to the external historical actuality. Zionism challenged this weakness, and its purpose was to bring the Jewish people back to the historical reality by secular means. For that reason, Scholem rejected the identification of Zionism as a messianic movement, yet at the same time 36</page><page sequence="17">The Universe of Gershom Scholem he wrote: 'I admit that this unshakable belief in a specific moral center which bestows meaning in world history on the Jewish people, transcends the sphere of pure secularization. I would not even deny that in it a remnant of theocratic hope also accompanies that reentry into world history of the Jewish people that at the same time signifies the truly Utopian return to its own history.'0 Scholem did not see Zionism as a final goal which was no more than the normalization of the life of the Jewish people: 'I have always con- sidered secular Zionism as a legitimate way', he said, 'but rejected the foolish declaration about the Jews becoming "a nation like all the nations". If this should materialize, it will be the end of the Jewish people. I share the traditional view that even if we wish to be a nation like all nations, we will not succeed, and if we succeed, that will be the end of us.' But in Scholem's view, the uniqueness of the Jewish people, its renewed nation- hood and culture, can be manifested today only in Eretz Israel and not in the exile which is already 'emptied of sparks of redemption'. Despite Scholem's disappointments in many aspects of the fulfillment of the Zionist dream in the State of Israel in our time, he was still convinced that from the historical standpoint, 'what was done in Eretz Israel is the only existential thing created by that generation and not what was drawn off to the Diaspora.'12 Scholem did not propound a full and detailed philosophical system, but he was a great researcher and historian. His primary scholarly con- cern centered around the history of the Jewish people and its spirit; yet, while he did not hazard prophecies about Jewry's future, he did hold to the opinion that a knowledge and an understanding of the Jews' past are essential preconditions for a continuous development towards the future. This, he believed, is an inescapable conclusion, whatever our future has in store. 'A people', he said, 'which destroys its living feelings rooted in the continuity of its existence and its historical reality, the heritage of the generations, will disappear. I believe in the future of our people, but a future founded on a rupture with this tradition would be like a death- sentence, God forbid, passed on the future.'13 TEL AVIV UNIVERSITY NOTES 1. mi-Berlin L'Yerushelayim was published in Tel Aviv in 1982. 2.
