<plain_text><page sequence="1">Biography of a Cottontail. Lucille Trost. 64pp. $3.49. G. P. Putnam's Sons, 200 Madison Ave., New York City 10016. 1971. (Grades 3-6) Sylvi is the storyname of a female rabbit, as adapted from the scientific name Sylvilagus. The text follows Sylvi from her birth to her adulthood and her own mating and family. There is no anthropomorphism here, although it would appear so in the first few pages. The information is factual and faithful to a scientific account of the life cycle and be- havior of the cottontail rabbit. Sylvi is sub- jected to the rigors of the elements and to animal predators, but not man. Her first litter of five succumbs to a storm, but the book ends with her awaiting a second brood. The descrip- tions of nesting and foraging are realistic. Two-color drawings enrich the text. There is no "technical jargon." John P ancella</page></plain_text>
