<plain_text><page sequence="1">Fragments Recalled at Eighty: The Art Memoirs of Ellen H. Johnson edited and with an introduction by Athena Tacha Gallerie, 1993 Fragments is a charming memoir by the leg- endary Oberlin College art historian who died in 1992. Johnson recounts how im- pressed she was with young Athena Tacha's brilliance when she first met her, newly ar- rived on the Oberlin campus from Greece. The two became colleagues, friends, and traveling companions, and Tacha has done us all a favor by gathering for publication the memoirs of this adventurous explorer of the early years of contemporary American art. "Her encounters with the aging Alfred Stieglitz and Alice B. Toklas are as revealing and charming as her friendships with the young Andy Wharhol and Claes Oldenburg. Her sparkling accounts of Australia, Iran, India, and Greece are as full of wonderment as her trips to Europe in pursuit of Cezanne's painting motifs, and her trips to New York in search of promising artists." Johnson also reports on her restoration of a Frank Lloyd Wright house. A delightful por- trait of Johnson (clothed) by Alice Neel graces the slim paperback's cover. Although these memoirs were written when Johnson was ill and in excruciating pain, there is no indication of any loss of her incredible joie de vive. Dorothy Dehner: Sixty Years of Art essays by Joan M. Marter Katonah Museum of Art, 1993 Dehner (1901-94) was fortunate in having as her champion Joan Marter, Professer of Art at Rutgers University. Marter authored a WAJ (F80/W81) article on the sculptor and curated this retrospective, which included still-life oil-on-canvas paintings from the thir- ties as well as drawings and watercolors from all stages of her long career. The pull-out cover, on which is reproduced Low Land- scape Sideways (1962), a 18" x 48" x 6" bronze, is sensational. The exhibition trav- eled to the Hyde Collection, Glen Falls, New York, and the Corcoran Museum, Washing- ton, D.C. "Because of her working methods, her concern for individual expression, and her totemic and mythic imagery, Dorothy Dehner can be associated with artists of the New York School," writes Marter. Her work was also closely related to her life experi- ences. The artist wrote in 1955: "I seldom discard ways, but add to them and use the old ones and carry them all with me as I do 0 my life from childhood." Dehner's artistic career was eclipsed dur- ing much of her 23 years with sculptor David Smith. She had her first solo show when she was 51. Her work, although monumental in conception, was, until the 1980s, small. Dur- ing the last decade she created on a heroic scale, her constructions reaching 12 and 13 feet high. The catalogue reproduces 59 works, plus a selected bibliography and chronology. Astonishment &amp; Power The Eyes of Understanding: Kongo Minkisi by Wyatt MacGaffey The Art of Renee Stout by Michael D. Harris National Museum of African Art, 1994 This two-part exhibition and catalogue be- gins with the history of the African Bakongo from 1880 to 1921, when colonialism took hold. A group of Kongo men recorded many aspects of their history and culture, includ- ing a category of visual representation called minkisi. Part two explores the conti- nuity of this visual form in the art of Renee Stout, an African American. "Minkisi are fabricated things, yet they can be invoked to produce desired effects, they have a will of their own, and they may willfully command the behavior of human beings...people de- pend on minkisi to do things for them, even to make life itself possible." Minkisi are complex objects, until recently sought for their visual interest, with little attention paid to their history, meaning, or function. Stout saw her first minkisi figure in a muse- um when she was ten. "It resonated with her, not only visually but also conceptually." Made of wood, iron, and myriad other ma- terials, the figure, which is reproduced in the catalogue, stands 31" tall, has a large head, raised right arm, rectangular opening in its center, and variously shaped nails hammered into its body. Among Stout's works that evoke minkisi images are Trinity (1972), a 45" tall wood and mixed-media structure that incorporates images of Stout and her mother and sister into a triptych that also recalls medieval gold-leaf altar- pieces; and Fetish No. 1 (1987), 12" high, which, with its nailing, bundling, and wrap- ping, is anthropomorphic. Standing on a base, it is a "sculptural object intended for viewing and contemplation." Also repro- duced in the 150-page catalogue are some of Stout's realist paintings and minkisi-in- spired works by other African Americans. The World of Frida Kahlo edited by Erika Billeter University of Washington, 1993 Frida Kahlo in Mexico by Robin Richmond Pomegranate, 1994 Frida Kahlo-Masterpieces introduction by Keto von Waberer Michael Robertson, translator W.W. Norton, 1994 Salomon Grimberg ended his WAJ (F93/W94) review of seven Kahlo books thusly: "These publications are proof that there is at least one book for every Kahlo adorateur-and who knows, maybe more." These three books are among the "maybe more." The World of Frida Kahlo is the cat- alogue for an exhibit held at the Schirn Kunsthalle, Frankfurt, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. Dolores Olmedo Patinio's collection of Kahlo's work formed the "heart" of the exhibition, which also includ- ed photographs, some published for the first time in the catalogue, as well as folk art objects, votive paintings, pre- Columbian objects, and traditional Indian dress. Also shown were paintings by her friends and contemporaries-her entire world. There are photographs of the kinds of objects she and Rivera collected, of the interior and exterior of her Blue House, now a museum, black-and-white images of friends and family, and more that 100 full- page color plates. The brief essays by Bil- leter, Elena Poniatowska, Irene Hermer de Larrea, Jorge Alberto Lozoya, and Carlos Monsivais are informative. Artist Robin Richmond's work was influ- enced by Kahlo's. She "admired her detach- ment and confrontational style." Richmond roots Kahlo in Mexico, claiming the artist "loved Mexico so intensely that her own in- tensity becomes infinitely more understand- able when set against its vibrant Mexican backdrop." In fact, the first two chapters of her book are devoted to Mexican history. Richmond consulted psychoanalysts and child psychologists in order to better under- stand Kahlo's work and to "penetrate this great artist's mind at many levels." Most Kahlo scholars view her life and works as in- extricably intertwined. Richmond continues this theme, explaining that "her paintings emerge as the inevitable consequences of her thoughts and feelings, fears and fan- tasies, hopes and desires." Some pho- tographs of Mexico and the usual paintings are reproduced. A glossary of Mexican ter- WOMAN'S ART JOURNAL</page><page sequence="2">minology is appended, as are recipes for guacamole and tortillas! The small format (71/2" x 5'/2") Frida Kahlo-Masterpieces is part of Schrimer's (Munich) Visual Library. Keto von Warberer's ten-page introduction begins with a personal response to a self-portrait: "Her expressions as she looked at me disturbed me and confused me, even annoyed me. Her face seemed beautiful and horrifying at the same time, se- rious and expressionless, her glance unwaver- ing. She knew something and was not telling me what it was." It then goes on to report the usual biography and influences. Forty-three works are reproduced in color, some twinned with von Waberer's commentary and quotes from Kahlo or Rivera. A chronology and bibli- ography conclude the book. Hungry for Light: The Journal of Ethel Schwabacher edited by Brenda S. Webster and Judith E. Johnson Indiana University, 1993 The greatest fear of most artists is posthu- mous anonymity. Ethel Schwabacher (1903-84), whose working life spanned the advents of Surrealism, Abstract Expression- ism, and feminism, is fortunate in that her children, Brenda and Christopher, have seen to it that her art and ideas remain in public view. Brenda co-authored an article about her mother in WAJ (S/S 89), in which she quoted liberally from the journals the artist kept during the last 13 years of her life. Not that Schwabacher was neglected during her lifetime. She was part of Betty Parsons's stable and was friends to and helped support many of the early Abstract Expressionists, particularly Gorky. (Her critical biography on Gorky established his position in American art.) But she lived during a period when women's art was de- valued, and when many promising careers were thwarted, the work lost to posterity. Schwabacher writes of her suicide attempt and her long Freudian analysis. The journal "takes the reader into the artist's mind when she was at the height of her powers. She meditates on the sources of her own creativity; she observes the process of her aging and her approaching death." The journals have been condensed somewhat for publication and divided into sections for easy reader access. Each section has an in- troductory commentary that documents in- cidents in the artist's life. Also included are 16 black-and-white images, mostly family photos, and as many color reproductions of her work. The Art of Pamela Kay by Michael Spender Trafalgar Square, 1993 Published by David &amp; Charles in England (with support from the Catto Gallery) and distributed by Trafalgar Square in North Pomfret, Vermont, this lavishly produced book-more than 100 color plates-proves that there is still an audience for traditional still-life painting. Kay, a graduate of the Roy- al College of Art, became, according to the jacket blurb, "one of Britain's leading textile designers." After her children were grown, she turned to watercolor and oil and is now "Britain's most popular painter of still lifes." Much can be gleaned from the chapter titles: "Life, Work, and Art, " "Family," "Travels and Interiors," "Cupboards," "Still Life," "Flowers," and "Gardens." The work shows the influence of the Dutch 17th-century still- life masters, as well as Chardin, Fantin-La- tour, Monet, and Vuillard. Kay does not stray far from women's traditional subject matter, and she comments on each work repro- duced. She aims for constant variety in her work, in color and shape, in weight and tone. Above all, she wants her work to sparkle. Ever so discreet, we lear only that the artist was born "a few months before the outbreak of World War II." WOMAN'S ART JOURNAL O</page></plain_text>
