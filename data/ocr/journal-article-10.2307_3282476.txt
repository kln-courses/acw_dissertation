American Society of Parasitologists 1988 INTRODUCTION J. Ralph Lichtenfels Animal Parasitology Institute, Agricultural Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Beltsville, Maryland 20705 It has been my pleasure as ASP Vice President for 1987 to work with President Bill Campbell to organize and to introduce the President's Sym- posium. In the preface to the third edition of his text- book, "Animal Parasites, Their Life Cycles and Ecology," O. W. Olsen listed 5 basic principles of parasitology essential to an understanding of the subject: (1) a basic classification for under- standing relationships; (2) the general morphol- ogy of adults and larvae, for recognition; (3) the patterns of life cycles, for comprehension of how parasites live; (4) the ecological requirements of all stages of the parasites; and (5) the means of transmission of all stages. I think we can agree that a knowledge of life cycles and transmission patterns are at the heart of parasitology. Indeed, I suspect that the mar- velously ingenious strategies evolved by para- sites for ensuring their survival probably had a role in attracting many of us to the field of par- asitology. The success of this symposium, as judged by the enthusiasm of the audience and the willing- ness of the editors to publish it, is due in large part to the superior contributions of the speakers. However, a contributing factor may be that our society includes many members who have not had classical training in parasitology or have been away from research in this sector of the parasi- tology spectrum for some time. Life cycles and transmission patterns provide a framework or practical reference point for all work in parasi- tology. An understanding of these central con- cepts in our field is necessary for all of us to communicate to peers and laymen alike the im- portance of our work. The 3 contributions were not intended to be exhaustive reviews and authors whose work is not cited should not be offended. Each speaker 28</page><page sequence="2">LICHTENFELS-INTRODUCTION 29 was limited to 30 min so only an overview with selected examples was possible. The word strategies in the symposium title may give the appearance of anthropomorphic design on the part of the parasites. Readers, of course, must realize that successful strategies in life cycles are the result of time and selection pressures. Each speaker approached his subject differ- ently from the others, although all 3 provided new insights into the life cycles themselves, how they evolved, and what they were selected for. Professor Roy C. Anderson discussed the differ- ent strategies used by nematodes and then pro- vided examples of different strategies in each of the superfamilies parasitic in vertebrates. He provided new insight into precocity (growth and/ or development beyond the expected) and gave numerous examples of this phenomenon in nematode life cycles. He agrees with others who believe that intermediate hosts were added after the colonization of vertebrates by nematodes. In contrast to the nematodes, the trematodes, as discussed by Dr. Wesley L. Shoop, evolved from a 1-host pattern in a mollusc to produce sequential generations in the mollusc and then added final, intermediate, or paratenic hosts to achieve complicated 3- and 4-host cycles. Dr. Shoop discusses the highly evolved transmam- mary transmission ofAlaria marcianae from this evolutionary perspective. Professor John S. Mackiewicz discussed the evolution of cestode life cycles and agreed with others who believe a 2-host cycle to be strongly selected for in nature over a 1-host cycle because of enhanced transmission through intermediate host dispersal. He concludes that transmission is usually by passive stages that become incor- porated into the food chain of the host. Parate- nesis as in nematodes and trematodes is impor- tant also in cestodes. Unlike trematodes, asexual proliferation of immature stages is uncommon in cestodes, but the evolution of methods of in- creasing egg production in the final host are com- mon. My final tasks are to congratulate the 3 speak- ers for acting as superb guides to the heart of our discipline; to thank president William C. Camp- bell for the wisdom to select this subject; and, to thank Editors David F. Mettrick and Sherwin S. Desser for recognizing the value of bringing these papers to the readers of our journal.</page></plain_text>
