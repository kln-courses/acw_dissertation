<plain_text><page sequence="1">Introduction: Bereshit bara Elohim : A Survey of the Genesis and Evolution of the Golem Maureen T. Krause Rabbah created a man, and sent him to R. Zera. R. Zera spoke to Him, but received no answer. Thereupon he said unto him: "Thou art a creature of the magicians. Return to thy dust" ( B , Sandhedrin, 65b).1' Few ancient Jewish con- cepts have captured the modern imagination more powerfully and inspired more works of the fantastic than the golem, the artificial humanoid formed of clay and animated through mystical rituals and magical formulas. While the modern golem tends to become destructive and deadly, the creature did not acquire that stigma until the seventeenth century when persecuted Jews invented legends of a supernatural protector. Originally, the golem was created, not for practical purposes, as in legends from the twelfth through the nineteenth century, but for sacred ends: as a way of knowing God by His art in creating man and as a validation of one's piety and mastery of esoteric truths. Golem creation was viewed as the fulfillment of man's potential as creator, not as a usurpation of God's authority. Nor was the activity deemed an abuse of nature but "a pure and holy act." Vivifying the golem also attested to the unique creative potency of the Hebrew language. To unearth the primordial golem and trace its evolution, we must consult Hebrew and Aramaic texts from the 5th/4th century BCE through the Middle Ages, as well as Jewish legends from the twelfth through the nineteenth century. The first written record of the Hebrew word golem occurs in Psalm 139:16 (5th/4th c., BCE) which, according to Jewish tradition, is spoken by Adam: "Your eyes saw my unformed limbs 'golmi ra'u enecha ]" (Judaica, V:43).2 In the literal translation, golem means "unformed sub- stance."3 Verse 15 establishes Adam's tellurian genesis by localiz- 113</page><page sequence="2">Introduction Journal of the Fantastic ing his creation within the earth : "My frame was not concealed from You when I was shaped in a hidden place, knit together in the recesses of the earth." The derivation of his name from ad- amah, "earth," underscores Adam's tellurian origin (Frankel, 2). Specifically, Adam means "one taken from the earth" (Läpple, 44), an etymology stressed in rabbinic and Talmudic commentaries on Genesis (Scholem, Kabbalah, 160). The Jawist manuscript of Genesis 2:7 is also germane to the concept of Adam as proto-golem. Significantly, God is depicted as a potter in this highly anthropomorphic account. Both its lan- guage and content bear an affinity to ancient, non-biblical beliefs. A relief in the Temple at Luxor, for example, depicts the Egyptian creator-god Chnum at his potter's wheel molding human bodies from clay (Läpple, 40).4 Adam's loamy nature is also manifest in Job 33:6 (600-450 BCE) where, according to Jewish tradition, Job addresses Adam: "You and I are the same before God; I too was nipped from clay" (Scholem, "Idea," 160).5 The Babylonian Tal- mud (200 to 500 CE) presents the definitive account of God's initial creation of Adam as a golem: R. Johanan b. Hanina said: The day consisted of twelve hours. In the first hour, his [Adam's] dust was gathered; in the second it was kneaded into a shapeless mass ļ golem]-, in the third, his limbs were formed; in the fourth, a soul was infused into him; in the fifth, he stood on his feet...(£, Sanhédrin, 38b). The later rabbinic collection, Midrash Rabbah (6th to 12th c.), gives a similar rendition: "[I]n the third [hour] He assembled Adam's dust, in the fourth He kneaded it, in the fifth He shaped him, in the sixth He made him into a lifeless body ['asa'o golem], in the seventh He breathed a soul into him..." (XXIX:1). Whereas the Talmud defines golem as "shapeless mass," Midrash Rabbah interprets the term as "lifeless body." The Aggadah (6th- 12th c.) defines golem as "matter without form" (Scholem, "Idea," 160), which is synonymous with the Tal- mudic definition. Nachmonides (1194-1270), leader of the Ge- rona school of Kabbalism, tacitly defines golem as "one without a soul: He was lain as a Golem, as a silent stone, and the Holy One, blessed be He, breathed into his nostril the soul of life; then Adam became a living soul" (quoted from Idei, Golem, 130). Nachmonides' definition, however, is already implicit in those of the Talmud and the Midrash Rabbah. 114</page><page sequence="3">in the Arts Maureen T. Krause The Talmud attributes cosmic dimensions to Adam as golem: "Rab Judah said in Rab's name: The first man reached from one end of the world to the other, as it is written, 'Since the day that God created man upon the earth, even from one end of Heaven unto the other'" ( B , Sanhédrin, 38b). In Genesis Rabbah (2nd-3rd BCE; as quoted in Scholem, "Idea") Adam is described as mute, inanimate, and possessing tellurian powers and strength (XXIV:2; Scholem, "Idea," 162). According to the thirteenth-century Ashkenazic text, Sefer ha-Gematrilot, God inscribed 'emet [truth] on Adam's forehead so that if He desired Adam's death, He could simply erase the alef (the first letter of 'emet) to leave met, "dead" (Sherwin, 18). Significantly, the Talmudic sages and The Zohar (13th c.) consid- ered 'emet God's seal ( B : Shabbat, 55a; Sanhédrin, 64a; Yoma, 69b; Zohar, 2b). Thus, in a sense, the Creator signed His art work with both life and death, thereby stressing the close association between birth and death, creation and annihilation. The mystical work, Midrash Avkir (c. 13th c.), attempts to explain God's reason for initially creating Adam as a golem. The work contends that God's motive was to prevent Adam from being mistaken as a co-Creator: Rabbi Berakhya said: "When God wished to create the world, He began His creation with nothing other than man and made him as a golem. When he prepared to cast a soul into him He said: If I set him down now, it will be said that he was my companion in the work of Creation; so I will leave him as a golem until I have created everything els e..."(Yalqut Shimoni on Gen. par. 34; quoted from Scholem, "Idea," 162-63). The myth of Adam's genesis as a golem was the fountainhead of subsequent human attempts at creating life. His attributes were prototypical for later artificial humanoids; like Adam, these crea- tures were formed of clay, soil or dust; were mute; had gigantic dimensions, and tellurian powers and strength. As part of the creative ritual, some adepts inscribed the word 'emet on the golem's forehead or placed in its mouth a slip of parchment containing the word Schern, meaning "Name," a substitute for the holy name itself. The concept that life could be created through magic stems from Talmudic legends about famous Rabbis of the third and 115</page><page sequence="4">Introduction Journal of the Fantastic fourth centuries (Scholem, Kabbalah, 165). Because it reveals that the truly righteous, such as Rabbah, could create a living being, the Talmudic tractate Sanhédrin became seminal to golem cre- ation: Raba said: If the righteous desired it, they could [by living a life of absolute purity] be creators, for it is written, "But your iniqui- ties have distinguished between you and your God." Rabbah created a man, and sent him to R. Zera. R. Zera spoke to him, but received no answer. Thereupon he said unto him: "Thou art a creature of the magicians. Return to thy dust" (65b). According to Rabbi Shem Tov ibn Shaprut, a fourteenth-cen- tury commentator on Aggadah, Talmudic masters were able to create illusions, and Rabbah devised the specter of a man to test Rav Zera (Idei, Golem, 51). However, two centuries earlier, Rashi of Troyes (1040-1105), the great Talmudic commentator and ex- egesist, had affirmed the veracity of man's potential to create life (Ausubel, 186). And the Talmud permitted the creation of life by means of the Hilkoth Yezirah [Laws of Creation] (Sanhédrin, 65b, n. 9; Trachtenberg, 85).6 The Sefer Yezirah [Book of Formation] became the most im- portant work for golem creation because it elucidates God's method of Creation.7 Ostensibly written by an anonymous first- century Jewish neo-Pythagorean, the Sefer Yezirah is a treatise on cosmogony and cosmology, according to which God created through language: "Writing, thought, speech, and action are a unity in the Divine Being" (Kalisch, viii). Specifically, one of the principles of Creation was the manipulation of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet, which were believed to possess creative vitality: The twenty-two letters...form the stamina after having been ap- pointed and established by God. He combined, weighed them, and formed by them all beings which are in existence, and all those which will be formed in all time to come (Sefer Yezirah II). The Sefer Yezirah also details how God used specific types of letters to create individual things. For example, He created each planet, constellation, and human body part with the twelve simple conso- nants (V:5). With the seven double consonants He created height and depth, east and west, north and south, and "the Holy Temple that stands in the center and carries them all" (IV:3-4). Reb Zezlel apparently held that Creation emanated from a 116</page><page sequence="5">in the Arts Maureen T. Krause single letter: bet (Rosenfeld, 9). He clearly based his view on two facts: in Hebrew bet is the first letter of Genesis, Bereshit [In the beginning], and of the second word, bara [created]. The Zohar elucidates: "By wisdom is the house [beth] built; hence the beth (=2) of bereshith, implying that the upper house is built in wisdom and the lower one also..." (1: 29a). The Pythagorean concept of the creative power of letters and numbers was already known in the tannaitic period (c. 10-220 CE).9 According to the Talmud, the Amora Rab (c. 200 CE) held that Bezalel "knew how to combine the letters by which heaven and earth were created" ( B , Berachot, 55a).10 The letters of the entire Torah were also believed to possess creative power (B, Berachot, 55a). According to Midrash Tehillim (1512), God kept the correct sequence of Torah a secret to prevent man from using its magic: No one knows its order, for the sections of the T orah are not given in the right arrangement. If they were, everyone who reads in it might create a world, raise the dead, and perform miracles. Therefore the order of the Torah was hidden and is known to God alone (quoted from Scholem, "Idea," 167). The concept of the creative power of language clearly derives from Genesis: "God said, 'Let there be light'; and there was light..." (1:3). Morever, the Jewish theologian, Philo of Alexandria (1st c. BCE), posited that God devised Logos as an intermediary in Creation: "Logos shaped the world to spare God contact with its finite inadequateness" (Trepp, 249). Similarly, The Zohar identi- fies "Speech," or "Voice," as the creative agent: "For all those deep and hidden things which issue from [God's] thought and are taken up by the Voice are not disclosed till the Word reveals them" (I:32a). 1 The Kabbalistic view that the universe was created through a préexistent Divine language is also supported in the Midrash (Ariel, 115). The creative potency of the Hebrew lan- guage is further underscored by the fact that the terms for "things," devarim , and "words," dibburim, share a common root (Ariel, 1 15). According to the Sefer Yezirah, the Divine Name itself was essential to Creation. The following excerpt also reveals God's system for combining the letters: But how was it done? He combined, weighed and changed: the A with all the other letters in succession, and all the others again 117</page><page sequence="6">Introduction Journal of the Fantastic with A; B with all, and all again with B; and so the whole series of letters. Hence it follows that every creature and every word emanated from one name (II: 5; emphasis mine). The "one name" is an obvious allusion to the ineffable Name of God, YHVH, the Tetragrammaton [Shem ha-Maforash ]. The sec- ond of the two extant recensions of the Sefer Yezirah explicitly cites the Tetragrammaton, specifies it as the source of Creation and delineates a few of its various combinations: He chose three of the simple letters, sealed them with Spirit and set them into His great Name, YHV, and sealed through them six extremities. Five: He sealed Height; He turned upward and sealed it with YVH. Six: He sealed Abyss; He turned downward and sealed it with HYV. Seven: He sealed East; He turned forward and sealed it with HYV. Eight: He sealed West; He turned backward and sealed it withHFY. Nine: he sealed South; He turned right and sealed it with VYH. Ten: He sealed North; He turned left and sealed it with VHY... (1:13; Blumenthal, 19). The creative potency of the Tetragrammaton is underscored by the etymological relationship between YHVH and the Hebrew word for "being," HYH (Trepp, 235). Because YHVH connotes "God as Being," something beyond human comprehension, it may not be spoken (Trepp, 235-36). Adonai [Lord] is said instead.1 Additional substitute names were invented at the beginning of the Talmudic period: the Names of 12, 42 and 72 letters and, later, the Names of 8, 10, 14, 16, 18, 21, 22, 32 and 60 letters were derived from YHVH (Blumenthal, 267, n. 2). According to the Sefer Raziel [Book of Raziel] by Rabbi Eleazar ben Judah of Worms (c. 1160-c. 1230), the "holy and awesome" Name of 72 letters was "the most potent of Names and no magic could be performed without it" (Trachtenberg, 95).13 A total of 72 Names evolved. Some of these Names and their creative force are analyzed in The Zohar. Moreover, the Kabbalistic work, Sefer ha-Bahir [Book of Brightness] - redacted in the twelfth century and attributed to a first-century Mishnaic sage- expounds on the derivation of the 72 Names in terms of Numbers 6:24-26 and Exodus 14:19-21: What is the meaning of verse (Numbers 6:24-26), "May God (YHVH) bless you and watch you. May God (YHVH) make His face shine to you and give you peace." This is the explicit Name of the Blessed Holy One. It is the Name containing twelve letters 118</page><page sequence="7">in the Arts Maureen T. Krause as is written, YHVH YHVH YHVH. This teaches us that God's names consist of three troops. Each troop resembles the other, and each one's name is like [the other's] name. All of them are sealed with Yud Heh Vav Heh. And how? The [four letters] Yud Heh Vav Heh can be permuted 24 different ways, forming one troop.... These are the 24 names of the Blessed Holy One. This teaches us that each army, with its leaders and officers, has 24. Multiply 24 by three and you have the 72 names of the Blessed Holy One. These are the 72 names derived from the verses (Exodus 14:19-21). The Zohar maintains that the Tetragrammaton played an es- sential role in golem creation (Scholem, Geheimnisse, 69), just as this Name was fundamental to Creation according to the Sefer Yezirah. Although the golem is not mentioned in the Sefer Yezirah, Beth ha-Midrash (12th c.), attributed to Judah ben Barzillai al- Bargeloni (late llth/early 12th c.), confirms its importance to golem creation. Beth ha-Midrash recounts that, after studying the Sefer Yezirah, Abraham learned to create a world; Rava and Zera created a calf, and Ben Sira and Jeremiah created a man. Most significantly, the author contends that God Himself used the Sefer Yezirah as a handbook for Creation: When God created His world, He first created the Book of Creation and looked into it and from it created the world....Then he [Abraham] went to "Eber and went to Shem, and knew how to create a world. So likewise Rava and Rabbi Zeira busied themselves with Book Yetsirah and a calf was created to them, which they slaughtered, and Jeremiah and Ben Sira also busied themselves with it for three years, and a man was created to them" (VI: 36-7; quoted from Scholem, "Idea," 177-78). At the time the Sefer Yezirah was written, philosophers be- lieved they could penetrate the secrets of nature (Kalisch, viii). As a result, the work evolved into a magic book for golem creation (Kalisch, viii). Rashi also considered it a magic book and interpre- ted "Rabbah created a man" as "Rabbah created a man by means of the Sefer Yezirah" ( B , Pesach, 50a). In addition, some post-Tal- mudic texts define the golem as "a man created by means of the Sefer Yezirah" (Sherwin, 4). Specificially, Rashi and Joseph Caro (1488-1575), a major codifier of Jewish law, held that Rabbis Haninna and Oshaya used the Sefer Yezirah as a magic book (Ruderman, 112) to create a calf-golem every Friday evening for 119</page><page sequence="8">Introduction Journal of the Fantastic their Sabbath meal ( B , Sanhédrin, 67b). The link between golem creation and the Sefer Yezirah is underscored by the book's title: the Hebrew for "creation" or "formation" is yezur, which normally means "creature," and it appears several times in the text in connection with the results of the letter permutations (Idei, Golem, 13). In the Midrash, yezur occasionally even denotes "human being" (Idei, Golem , 13). Golem creation was granted religious sanction by Rashi him- self: "They [Chanina and Oshaya] used to combine the letters of the Name [Shem ha-Meforash ] by which the universe was created; this is not to be considered forbidden magic, for the works of God were brought into being through His Holy Name" (quoted from Trachtenberg, 84). Hence, creating a golem by combining the letters of the Tetragrammaton was deemed neither a usurpation of the Creator nor an assault on nature but "a pure and holy act through which man could confirm that he was created in the divine image and endowed with the divine creative powers" (Ruderman, 112). Golem creation was also meant to imitate the Creator, bear testimony to His greatness, and know God through His art in creating man (Idei, Golem, xxvi-xvii). The role of the occult and theurgy in Kabbalah led to the Kabbalistic belief in magic (Ariel, 186). The Kabbalists believed in the inherent magical power of the Hebrew alphabet and devised a fine art of combining the letters to elicit their highest potential (Trachtenberg, 82). They also learned the 72 Names of God and permuted the letters of the Tetragrammaton for magical purposes, believing that mastery of the Names bestowed the power to ma- nipulate the Creator's world (Trachtenberg, 80). The Kabbalists further held that the creative potency of God's language was manifest in human language. They maintained that, by ordering the letters of the Tetragrammaton into every possible combination while contemplating the mysteries of Creation, they could project some of this elementary power into the golem (Scholem, "Prague," 337). The Kabbalists regarded golem making as a confirmation of man's creative power (Scholem, "Prague," 337). Hence, produc- ing a living being was the greatest act a Kabbalist could perform (Bergmann, 42). In fact, the golem was so fundamental to Kabbalistic speculation that it was considered a replica of Adam 120</page><page sequence="9">in the Arts Maureen T. Krause (Scholem, "Prague," 83). However, some Kabbalists correlated speech with reason. Consequently, an anonymous Kabbalist of the early fourteenth century declared that, although the golem had an animate form, it was actually dead since it lacked speech and the knowledge of God (Sholem, "Idea," 194). Some medieval Hebrew texts characterize the golem as a manifestation of the cooperation of the master and the Divine power of the mystical letters and Divine Names, not as a display of the powers of nature (Idei, Golem, 261). The golem was deemed neither a part of nature nor a biological aberration -as are mon- sters-but an unnatural exception, an ephemeral being whose creation and destruction were premeditated (Idei, Golem, 261). The texts also reaffirm that golem creation proved the power of the Hebrew language, as Moshe Idei indicates: "[I]t is the firm belief in the unique character of this language which enabled the ancient and medieval Jews to approach this topic [the golem] not as an imaginary issue, but rather as an existing category as possible and probable as any other rare phenomenon" (Golem, 262). In the Middle Ages the conception of creation underwent considerable refinement, resulting in various prescriptions for golem making. These formulas included combining the twenty- two letters from the Sefer Yezirah (Idei, Golem, xxvii-ix) and- in some cases - the myriad alphabets, the Name of 72 letters and the letters of the Tetragrammaton. Five of the extant prescriptions are described here. One is Sefardic and four are Ashkenazic in origin. The Provençal and Catalan Kabbalists, however, were relatively indifferent to golem creation (Idei, Golem, 96). The oldest extant formula appears in Pelullath ha-Yezirah, the last chapter of Sefer ha-Shem, a commentary on the Sefer Yezirah by Rabbi Eleazar ben Judah of Worms (Scholem, "Idea," 184). Eleazar specifies that two or three adepts form the golem by kneading virginal mountain earth in running water. Then they recite the combinations of the alphabets derived from the 221 "gates" along with each letter of the Tetragrammaton and the Name of 72 letters (Scholem, "Idea," 185).1 One sequence pro- duces a male golem; another a female - the first known reference to this possibility. A reversal returns the golem to dust (Scholem, "Idea," 186). According to Eleazar, God used identical letter combinations to create the universe (Idei, Golem, 57). However, 121</page><page sequence="10">Introduction Journal of the Fantastic Eleazar considered golem creation a purely mystical practice (Idei, Kabbalah, 100). In Sefer Havvei ha- 'Olam ha-Ba ' the ecstatic Kabbalist, Rabbi Abraham Abulafia (1240-1292), set a precedent by devising a formula specifying that each part of the golem must be created separately. He ascribes specific groups of letters to each part of the golem: its head, torso, and limbs. To form the golem, the adept needs a bowl of pure water, a spoon, and precisely weighed earth. He slowly blows each spoonful of soil over the water. With the first spoonful, he bows his head and loudly prolongs a letter of the Tetragrammaton in a single breath until he can no longer sustain it. Then he recites the letters for the parts of the head, the torso, and each limb (Scholem, Kabbalah, 188). Despite his golem for- mula, Abulafia considered spiritual creation superior to corporeal creation (Idei, Golem, 102). The prescription developed by the Pseudo-Sa'adya (13th c.) reflects the ritualistic character of golem creation (Scholem, "Idea," 186). His formula derives from a line in the Sefer Yezirah : "So the circle 'galgal' closes before and behind" (II, 4; Kalisch). Hence, the adepts draw a circle around the creature and walk around the circle while reciting the 221 alphabets. Or they shape a body from virgin soil, bury it, and draw a sphere and a circle around it. They walk around the form 442 times, reciting one of the alphabets with each circuit. Walking forward vivifies the golem by the power of the letters; walking backward, while reciting the alphabets in reverse, makes it sink into the earth and die (Scholem, "Idea," 186-87). The Pseudo-Sa'adya warns of the danger inherent in erring. The students of Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha (1st half 2nd c., CE) walked backward by mistake and, through the power of the letters, sank into the earth up to their navels. Hearing their cries, the Rabbi had them recite the alphabets while walking forward, and they were freed (Scholem, "Idea," 186-87). An anonymous prescription from approximately the four- teenth century is unique in its specification of the steps preliminary to the technical aspects of golem creation. The adept takes the finest pure earth and recites the combinations until he achieves inspiration [shefa' ha-bokhmah]. Then he rapidly recites the com- binations and turns the "wheel" of combinations as fast as possible, bringing down the holy spirit [inspiration].15 Only then is the adept 122</page><page sequence="11">in the Arts Maureen T. Krause in the proper temper to create the golem (Munich manuscript, 341 folio 183b; Scholem, "Idea," 187-88). An intriguing development occurred in fourteenth-century Germany. The Spanish rabbi, Nissim ben Reuben Girondi (c. 1310-c. 1375), reported that scholars engaged in demonology ap- plied the Sanhédrin passage as their guide for golem making but added the unprecedented stipulation that creation must take place in a "vessel" (. Hiddushim to Sanhédrin, 65b; Scholem, "Idea," 197). It is tempting to assume that the "vessel" was a retort, given the influence of alchemy on Kabbalah (cf. Ariel, 187). However, Rabbi Girondi predates Paracelsus by approximately two hundred years. And the use of semen - an ingredient for the homunculus - in creation was unknown to the Jews (Scholem, "Idea," 197).16 Nonetheless, Rabbi Girondi's report anticipated the contempo- rary association of the golem and the homunculus. Rabbi Abraham ben Mordecai Galante, a sixteenth-century Ashkenazic Kabbalist quoted by Rabbi Abraham ben Mordecai Azulai (c. 1570-1643) in Zohar 'Orha-Hammah, advocated a novel approach to golem creation- novel in its incorporation of the letters of Adam's name. New dust is gathered, spread on the ground, and inscribed with the name of the thing to be created. Each letter is then combined with all the alphabets. Next, all the alphabets are combined with each letter of Adam's name ( alef , daled, mem), thereby animating the golem. To destroy it, the process of creation is reversed, causing the golem to return to dust (Idei, Golem, 69). Notably, this golem was able to speak because, as Rabbi Joseph Ashkenazi (181 1-1880) explained, it had a "lower soul" like man's (Idei, Golem, 71).17 Other golems were mute since, according to Seferha-Bahir, the faculty of speech is provided by the soul, which could be infused into the golem only by the sinless (cf. Sholem, Kaballah, 192).18 Whether the golem had a soul became the subject of debate. Nachmonides argued that, because medieval philosophical He- brew commonly designated "human being" as ha-medaber, "one who speaks," the golem's muteness proved that it was not human (Sherwin, 7). Rabbi Isaac ben Abraham (13th c.), the leading scholar of Provençal Kabbalah, asserted in his commentary on the Sefer Yezirah that a mute golem was worthless since it lacked a soul. He also contended that, if Rabbah created a man, he destroyed 123</page><page sequence="12">Introduction Journal of the Fantastic him because it did not possess the soul that instills speech (Idei, Golem , 135).19 By contrast, the Pseudo-Sa'adya held the extrava- gant view that the golem had the highest level of being, possessing both vitality and a soul (Goldsmith, 19). An anonymous sixteenth- century Talmudist insisted that, although the golem was soulless and mute, it did have nefesh, "life" (Goldsmith, 19). Moses Cordovero (1522-1570) contended that the "new creature" had only hivvuth, "existence" (Goldsmith, 19).20 The golem also became the subject of a halakhic dispute that lasted from the seventeenth to the eighteenth century. The first to make a halakhic issue of the golem was Rabbi Zevi Hirsch ben Ya'aqov Ashkenazi (1660-1718). He decreed the golem ritualis- tically irrelevant in an effort retroactively to absolve his ancestor, Rabbi Eliyahu of Chelm (d. 1583), who had performed the "dubi- ous" act of creating a golem (Idei, Golem, 217-18). Although the golem provoked diverse reactions among the halakhists, none denied its reality (Idei, Golem, 213). They even prohibited the slaying of a golem (Idei, Golem, 219). Rabbi Zadok ha-Kohen of Lublin (1823-1900) in fact maintained that Rabbi Akiba Eger ben Simhah Bunim (c. 1720-1758) should not have destroyed his golem (Idei, Golem, 223). Nonetheless, Rabbi Zadok judged the golem an idolater, yet ruled that- like a minor - it could be included in the minyan required for the blessing after a meal (Idei, Golem, 220). By contrast, Rabbi Jacob Emden (1697-1776) held that the golem - like the deaf and dumb - had to be excluded from the minvan (Idei, Golem, 219). However, since Rabbah and Rav Zera were associated with golem creation, the halakhists legitimized the activity, even though sorcery was otherwise unlawful (Idei, Golem, 214). They ruled that a golem was an animal in human form and could not take part in religious services. The halakhists also decreed that artificially created animals need not be ritually slaughtered before eating (Rosenfeld, 19). For the Hasidim, golem creation was a mystical rite of passage and the validation of one's piety and mastery of esoteric truths (Sherwin, 13-4). The pietists [Hasidei Ashkenaz] regarded the act as a test of spiritual perfection, and the creation of a speaking golem as a righteous imitation of God's creation of Adam (Idei, Golem, 28). The Talmudista, practical Kabbalists, and Ashke- 124</page><page sequence="13">irt the Arts Maureen T. Krause nazim believed the golem to be a living being (Scholem, "Idea," 177). The Ashkenazic Hasidim and the ecstatic Kabbalists, how- ever, considered the golem a mystical vision culminating in ecstasy ("Golem," 197, 775), not a living being. They perceived the golem as the materialization of one's astral body, or tzelem, namely the non-physical projection of the physical self (Ariel, 186, 134). De- spite his contention, noted earlier, that the golem had only hivvuth [existence], Moses Cordovero expressed the curious futuristic view that the golem was the so-called "formal blueprint" of future man (Idei, Golem, 288-89). Thus, he inadvertently anticipated twentieth-century attempts to create life from inorganic matter and to fabricate perfect human beings through genetic engineering and cloning. Unaccountably, sixteenth-century Jewish mystics banned fur- ther experimentation in golem creation (Frankel, 63). Nonethe- less, the golem did not expire but thrived in legends.21 Exactly when the golem became the subject of legend is disputed. Beate Rosenfeld maintains that golem legends were prevalent from the fourteenth to the seventeenth century, particularly in Germany (19).22 Gershom Scholem argues that such legends did not arise until the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries when famous German Hasidic scholars became their subjects ( Kabbalah , 198). David Ruderman contends that golem legends were extensive in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries throughout Jewish communi- ties, especially in Eastern Europe (112). However, they all over- look the earliest legend: the twelfth- century account of Rabbi Samuel the Pious (12th c.), who created a golem to accompany him as a bodyguard on his travels (Ausubel, 186).23 A remarkable fifteenth-century legend is recounted by Rabbi Joseph Solomon Delmedigo (1591-1655) in Mazref le-Hokhmah (1625): Solomon ibn Gabirol (1020-1057) created a female golem as a servant. To animate it, he inserted into its mouth a piece of parchment inscribed with Shem (Idei, Golem, 233). After being condemned to death for practicing black magic, ibn Gabirol was reprieved upon proving that the creature was not human- it was assembled of wooden hinges and pieces of wood (Sholem, "Idea," 199). Both ibn Gabirol's mechanical golem and Rabbi Abulafia's formula for creating the golem part-by-part anticipated the con- temporary literary metamorphosis of the golem as robot. 125</page><page sequence="14">Introduction Journal of the Fantastic Later, Rabbi Isaiah Horowitz ben Abraham ha-Levi (17th c.) wrote in Shenei Luhot ha-Berit that a female golem could be created through certain name combinations- as Rabbi Eleazar had written five centuries earlier. Rabbi Horowitz also believed that Joseph's brothers may have used their knowledge of the Sefer Yezirah to create a female golem. Since Joseph was unaware that the female was a golem, he informed his father that his brothers were engaged in incest (Idei, Golem, 235). As these accounts show, the intent of golem creation had changed by the twelfth century: mystical and spiritual motives were replaced by utilitarian ends. In the legend of Samuel the Pious, his male golem provides a useful service as a bodyguard. Ibn Gabirol's female golem performs practical work as a maid servant. In Rabbi Horowitz's account, the female golem has an equally pragmatic function as a sexual object. In the seventeenth century, the purpose of golem creation transformed again. Now the golem was made for an altruistic purpose: to protect and defend the Jewish community (Sherwin, 17). Simultaneously, however, the golem metamorphosed in some legends into a latently dangerous being that eventually had to be destroyed (Scholem, Kabbalah, 191). In 1682 Johann Schmidt also described the golem's inherent threat: "[I]f after forty days the piece of parchment is not taken from their forehead, they inflict great damage upon the person or possessions of their master and his family" (quoted from Held, 67-9). Johann Wülfer and Christoph Arnold reported the legend of Rabbi Eliyahu in 1674 (Scholem, "Idea," 200-04). However, a manuscript by a Polish Kabbalist predates their report by about two generations (Idei, Golem, 207). The manuscript was written shortly after the rabbi's death, i.e., between 1630 and 1649 (Idei, Golem, 208-09). Rabbi Eliyahu's descendants also disseminated the legend. Rabbi Zevi Hirsch Ashkenazi ben Jacob (1660-1718) mentions his grandfather's golem in his Response 9c (1700). Rabbi Ashkenazi's son, Rabbi Jacob Emden (1697-1776), writes in Megillath Sefer (1896) that Rabbi Eliyahu created a golem, which had to be destroyed because it became dangerous; it also acciden- tally injured the rabbi by scratching him during the removal of the Schern (Scholem, "Idea," 201). In another version by Rabbi Emden, the golem went on a rampage before the rabbi could 126</page><page sequence="15">in the Arts Maureen T. Krause destroy it (Sherwin, 17); in a later version, the rabbi was killed by the golem (Goldsmith, 17). According to Scholem, the legend of Rabbi Eliyahu became the model for subsequent golem legends, including that of Rabbi Loew ("Idea," 202-03). Idei disagrees, arguing that it was the legend of Rabbi Loew that became the prototype for subsequent golem legends. He adds that Rabbi Loew was the subject of the most extensive tradition involving the golem {Golem, 251). More- over, the legend of Rabbi Loew is the most famous of the golem legends (Minkin 5:45). The first major account of the legend appeared in the seventeenth-century work, Sefer Nifla'ot MHRL [Book of the Miracles of the Maharal', a quasi-authentic report attributed to Isaac ben Samson ha-Kohen (d. 1624), one of Rabbi Loew's sons-in-law (Ausubel, 186). But Emanuel Eckstein and Gershom Scholem proved it to be a forgery (Scholem, Bibliographia, 24, n. 192). The legend of Rabbi Yude-Leyb ben-Betsalel, the Maharal of Prague (1525-1609)- popularly known as Rabbi Loew- exists in many versions.24 One account opens with the (Hebrew) words: "Ah By Clay Destroy Evil Forces, Golem, Help Israel: Justice." These ten alphabetized words were revealed to Rabbi Loew in answer to his dream-question - a unique Kabbalistic element - re- garding a way to combat the evil priest Thaddeus and the blood libel. Rabbi Loew arranged the words according to formulas in the Sefer Yezirah and discovered the secret of creating a golem. He engaged his son-in-law and his best pupil as assistants. After midnight on the second day of Adar in the Jewish year 5340 [February 2, 1580], they went to the banks of the Moldau, where they drew a man three cubits in length. First they stood at his feet, facing his head. Then each made a clockwise circuit around the form while reciting a different formula. In another innovation, Rabbi Loew carried the Torah scroll as he circled the figure while chanting a formula. He inserted a piece of parchment inscribed with Schern into the golem's mouth, and they chanted, "The Lord God formed man from the dust of the earth. He blew into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being" (Genesis 2:7). And the creature came to life. The rabbi com- manded him to arise, instructing him to obey his orders: to spy on the Jews' foes and shield them from persecution. The golem 127</page><page sequence="16">Introduction Journal of the Fantastic performed his assigned tasks, informing Rabbi Loew of anything suspicious so that preventive measures could be taken. Ultimately, the golem averted a blood libel. One Sabbath, Rabbi Loew forgot to remove the parchment from the golem's mouth, as was his practice to give the golem rest. The golem remained idle until he could no longer control his increasing strength. Finally, he went on a destructive rampage. Rabbi Loew stopped him, realizing that the golem had to be destroyed. He took the golem to the attic of the Altneuschul Synagogue, where he and an assistant reversed the order of cre- ation. They stood at the golem's head, facing his feet, and then made a counter-clockwise circuit around him. They stopped at his head, where they recited a formula. They repeated the ritual until the golem perished. Then they wrapped the corpse in two worn prayer shawls and hid it in the attic genizah under stacks of leaves from old prayer books. Afterward they burned the golem's clothes and ritually washed their hands. Rabbi Loew then issued a ban barring entry to the attic. The golem's remains are said to rest there to this day. This synopsis of the legend of Rabbi Loew is based on two literary accounts: the most important literary version, Nifla'ot Maharal im ha-Golem [The Miraculous Deeds of the Maharal with the Golem, 1909], by Rabbi Yudl Rosenberg (Idei, Golem, 252) and an adaption of his work by Chayim Bloch in Der Prager Golem. Von seinem "Geburt" bis zu seinem "Tod" (1919), which appeared in English in 1 925 under the title The Golem: Legends of the Ghetto of Prague. In contrast to Bloch's version, the golem never became a menace in Rosenberg's account. The golem was destroyed only because the passage of a law against the blood libel rendered him superfluous. Despite the variations in their accounts, both authors made an invaluable contribution to the wide dissemination of the legend (Idei, Golem, 251-53). That the golem legend was associated with Rabbi Loew is considered a mystery by some scholars since- as they claim- he was neither a Kabbalist nor a scholar of Kabbalah ("Judah Low," Jewish Encyclopedia, 355). However, this association is no mystery since the Maharal "unhesitatingly associated himself with the world of Kabbalah" ("Judah Loew ben Betzalel "Judaica, 10:375). Rabbi Loew's supernatural activities were revealed by his great- 128</page><page sequence="17">in the Arts Maureen T. Krause great grandson and famed rabbinic authority, Rabbi Naftali ben Isaac ha-Kohen (1645-1719), in his 1709 correspondence with Rabbi Zvi Chacham. He refers to Rabbi Loew as his "ancestor, the Maharal of Prague who, as is well known, made use of the holy spirit." Rabbi Chacham later published these letters in his Re- sponsa (Goldsmith, 31). Rabbi Zevi Elimelekh Shapiro of Dynov (1785-1841) states in Benei Yissakhar that the Maharal wrote under the inspiration of the holy spirit [ruach ha-kodesh ] and performed magic by means of the Sefer Yezirah (Idei, Golem, 252). Rabbis Naftali and Zevi thus confirmed that the Maharal was indeed a Kabbalist. Moreover, ordinary Jews considered the Maharal a Kabbalistic magician-alchemist and invented many legends about him (Unter- man, 110). Evidence also suggests that he was esteemed as a wonder rabbi (Rosenfeld, 30). As a scholar and leader of Ashke- nazic Jewry, the Maharal was revered not only for his rabbinic knowledge but his mystical learning ("Judah Low," New Standard Jewish Encyclopedia, 1083; emphasis mine). Most significantly, he was renowned for translating Kabbalistic ideas into more popular terminology, thereby developing a unique system of thought that highly influenced Jewish thinkers (Unterman, 110). Despite Idel's claim that the Maharal's works exhibit no plau- sible links to the golem {Golem, 25 1 ), Rabbi Loew did, in fact, refer to the golem. In Be' er ha-Golah (1598), for example, he argues that the creation of a calf by Rabbis Chanina and Oshaya was a form of lawful magic:25 According to the tractate Sanhédrin, part 7, magic is punishable by death....There is also a form of magic which is permitted, like the one which Rabbi Chanina and Rabbi Oshaya practiced when on the eve of every Sabbath, after studying the book Yezirah, about the creation of the world, they created a three-year old calf and ate it...(quoted from Bokser, 5). In Sefer Hiddushei he explicitly writes of the artificial humanoid, namely Rabbah's golem. Like earlier scholars, the Maharal finds the creation of a speaking golem improbable: When he [Rabbah] purified himself and studied the divine names in the Book of Yezirah, he thereby cleaved to God, blessed be He, and he created an artificial man. But he [the artificial man] lacked the faculty of speech, since his [Rabbah's] power was not 129</page><page sequence="18">Introduction Journal of the Fantastic great enough to bring a speaking soul in mm...(Aggadot Maharal Mi-Prag, 2: 166; quoted from Idei, Golem, 107). Hence, Rabbi Loew's association with the golem legend is no enigma. In the eighteenth century when Prague developed into a cen- ter of Kabbalistic study, Rabbi Loew became increasingly central to Kabbalistic legend (Goldsmith, 31). Rabbi Loew inspired nu- merous golem legends from the seventeen through the nineteenth centuries. A well-known seventeen-century legend concerns the Ba'al Shem Tov (1700-1760), the founder of Hasidism, who cre- ated a golem as a servant but found it too stupid to do the work (Unterman, 86).26 A famous eighteenth-century legend involves the great Lithuanian rabbinic authority, Rabbi Eliyahu, the Vilna Gaon (1720-1797). He confided to his disciple, the future Rabbi Hayyim ben Isaac Volozhiner (1749-1821), that as a boy he had attempted to create a golem. As he was making the preparations, a mysterious form passed over his head. Frightened, and con- vinced that Heaven had intervened to stop him due to his youth, he immediately discontinued his activities (Scholem, "Idea," 204).27 Hans Ludwig Held contends that the "mysterious form" was the rabbi's double and therefore the golem itself (155-61), which Scholem finds improbable ( Kaballah , 204). However, the rabbi could have experienced a mystical vision of his astral body [tzelem' (a precursor of the double), which is plausible in terms of German Hasidic mysticism. Further support for Held's reading is found in a passage of The Zohar describing a bizarre hybrid of a golem and a double that haunts the sinner: "It molds itself into an exact image of that human and moves into his house to torment him" (Matt, 92). Inspired by the legend of the Maharal, legends of famous and obscure rabbis creating golems evolved among European Jewry as late as the nineteenth century (Scholem, Kabbalah, 203).28 For example, the last golem legend, that of Reb Dovidl of Dorhiczn from the province of Grodno, Russia (c. 1800), recounts how he created a golem as "Shabbos goy" to heat the Jews' houses and perform other work on the Sabbath. One day the golem acciden- tally kindled a blaze that destroyed the entire town (Minkin, 5: 45). With the grim conclusion of the legend of Reb Dovidl, the monu- 130</page><page sequence="19">in the Arts Maureen T. Krause mental history of the golem came to an abrupt end- as if the legendary golem had perished once and for all in the conflagration of Dorhiczn. However, just after the turn of this century, the golem was resurrected to serve, destroy, and kill again- no longer in legend but in literature and the arts. The fascination with the creation of artificial life that originated in antiquity endures to this day. The magic, however, no longer resides in the words of God but in the language of the writer, artist, and musician. Many inventive minds from various nations have created- and continue to create -un- told literary, artistic, and musical works based on the legend of Rabbi Loew. The legacy of Rabbi Loew in literature and the arts is the topic of this special issue. The essays treat several genres: the novel, short story, drama, visual arts, film, and opera. The themes include Abraham Rothberg's The Sword of the Golem as a defense of Judaism, the golem maker as the creation of another being, the golem in children's literature, the golem's metamorphoses as a female in Spanish-American literature, its transfigurations in art and film, its industrial modernization as a robot, and its apotheosis in opera. With intent, the essays are not arranged chronologically but in sequence from traditional to non-traditional epiphanies of the golem. This introduction has attempted to provide the historical back- ground necessary to assist the reader in decoding the golem's modern mutations in comparison with its Jewish antecedents. The articles themselves deal almost exclusively with twentieth-century works. This is not mere happenstance. The golem's uncanny allure is as potent today as when it first rose from the earth, and its mute voice continues to speak as seductively as when the golem was first called to life. Notes 1. B is the abbreviation used throughout this essay for the Babylon- ian Talmud. It is followed by the title of the individual tractate. The Talmud is divided into the Mishna (the text of the oral law in Hebrew) and the Gemara (a commentary on the Mishna in Aramaic). The Mishna is divided into six Orders, collectively called the Sedarim, and comprises 63 tractates, among them the Sanhédrin, Berachot, Pesach, Sota, Shabbat, and Yoma, which are quoted here. 131</page><page sequence="20">Introduction Journal of the Fantastic 2. Pentateuchal quotes are from The Torah (Jewish Publication Society); citations from other biblical works are from the Tanakh. 3. Moshe Idei and Byron Sherwin maintain that golem also means "embryo," which Gershom Scholem disputes ("Idea," 161). 4è The creation of artificial anthropoids was part of the magical practices of many other ancient cultures, including the Roman and Chi- nese (Idei, Golem , 4). The Greeks and Arabs claimed to make idols speak ("Golem," Judaica , 753). In Jewish tradition, idols were animated by the names of God. For example, Gehazi carved a name of God into the muzzle of Jeroboam's bull idol (1 Kings 12:28), and it recited the Deca- logue ( B , Sota 47a). 5. Significantly, Aristophanes (400 B.C.E.) characterizes man as a "creature of clay" (Läpple, 44). 6. According to the T almud, the Sefer Yezirah antedates the Hilkoth Yezirah ( B , Sanhédrin 38b, n. 9b), which also seems to have been a tract on name magic (Trachtenberg 84). However, they may not be discrete works: Hilkoth Yezirah could be a reference to the Sefer Yezirah (cf. "Golem," Judaica, 754). 7. There is no single standard system of transliteration from Hebrew to English. Hence, Yezirah is also spelled Yetzirah. Other such alternate spellings will be evident later in this essay and the articles that follow. 8. The date of the Sefer Yezirah is disputed. For example, Isidor Kalisch ascribes it to the second century (v), while Arnold Goldsmith dates it from the third to sixth century (18). 9. Creation also involved the sefirot [numbers]: "There are twenty- two letters by which I am, Yah , the Lord of Hosts, Almighty, Eternal, designed, formed and created by three sefirot this whole world, and formed by them creatures and all those that will be formed in time to come" {Sefer Yezirah , 37). 10. The Zohar concurs: "Bezalel possessed such great wisdom that he knew how to combine those letters of the Alphabet by which heaven and earth were created..." (IV:152a). 11. The Zohar maintains that the creative utterance was bereshith , which was replaced by reshith [beginning] after being was created (I:30a). 12. The pronunciation and meaning of YHVH have been lost. The Zohar explains the ineffability of YHVH as follows: "[T]he nearer a thing comes to the realm of the hidden and undisclosed, the less it is made mention of....On the same principle, The Divine Name Sublime, the essence of the hidden and unrevealed [YHVH', is never uttered, a name denoting the revealed 'ADNY' being substituted for it" (IV:230b). 13. See Trachtenberg for the spelling of the Divine Names, particu- larly the Name of 72 letters (96). 132</page><page sequence="21">in the Arts Maureen T. Krause 14. In the Sefer Yezirah the "gates" are the patterns according to which the letters are combined. 15. In Kabbalah the "wheel" refers to a Sefirot of Circles (Berg, 115). 16. The German physician and alchemist, Paracelsus (1493-1541), attempted to create a synthetic anthropoid, or homunculus, by allowing blood, semen, and urine to putrefy in a retort. 17. By "lower soul" Rabbi Ashkenazi meant nefesh , the "life force" (cf. Birnbaum, 419). The Torah applies nefesh hayyah to both man and animals (Lev. 17:11; Deut. 12:23), (Birnbaum, 420). 18. According to the Kabbalistic work, The Secret of the Name of 42 Letters , Ben Sira made a speaking golem (Idei, Golem , 17). 19. Rabbi ben Abraham was likely referring to the "higher soul," or ruach (cf. Ariel, 126). 20. Cordovero and the sixteenth-century Sefardic Kabbalists avoided the term "golem," preferring the phrase "new creature" (Scholem, "Idea," 194-95). Arnold Goldsmith interprets hiyyuth as "the life force," whereas Rabbi Sandra Katz translates it as "existence." In the Kabbalistic hierarchy of souls, nefesh is the life force of all living beings; ruach is the higher soul, associated with religious transcendence; and neshamah is the highest soul, attainable by pious disciples of Torah (Ariel, 125-26). The Zohar terms nefesh the "ordinary soul," ruach the "impulse of the spirit," andneshama "the supernal soul" (IV:25a) 21. Golem legends are related to earlier Jewish tales in which the dead are resurrected by placing in their mouth or on their arm a slip of parchment inscribed with God's name. They are killed by removing a piece of parchment containing God's name written backward ("Golem," Judaica, 755). 22. Beate Rosenfeld erroneously states that golem acquired the meaning of "artificially created man" in the twelfth century (1). This definition existed ten centuries earlier in the Talmud: "Rabbah created a man..." (£, Sanhédrin, 65b). 23. According to the New Standard Jewish Encylopedia , golem leg- ends began circulating in the twelfth century (775). 24. He is variously referred to as Loew, Loewe, Lob, Löb, Löwe, Lev, Levi, Liva, Liv, Leib and Leyb. His honorific, Maharal , is the Hebrew acronym for "Aforeinu ha-Rav Rabbi Liva," meaning "our teacher, the master Rabbi Liva" (Goldsmith, 21). 25. The MaharaTs other Kabbalistic works include Netivot Olam and Tiferei Israel (Berg, 176). 26. His given name was Israel ben Eliezer; his honorific, Baal Shem 133</page><page sequence="22">Introduction Journal of the Fantastic Tov , means "Master of the Good Name." 27. From Rabbi Hayim's introduction to the Vilna Gaon's commen- tary on the "Sifra de-Tseni'utha," a part of the Zohar (Vilna, 1819). 28.
