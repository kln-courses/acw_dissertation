<plain_text><page sequence="1">COMMENTARIES AND REJOINDERS 97 REFLECTIONS ON DOING WELL, NOT GOOD Writing to a young novelist in 1935, Ernest Hemingway drew a sharp dis- tinction between fully realized character in art and personal value systems of the author: "Don't just think who is right. As a man things are as they should or shouldn't be. As a man you know who is right and who is wrong. You have to make decisions and enforce them. As a writer you should not judge. You should understand."1 Carlos Baker suggests that Hemingway's attitude reflected a deep com- mitment to the belief "... that the writer's basic obligation was to do well rather than do good,"2 a creative modus operandi allowing the artist to con- tribute meaningfully to the culture through allegiance to some inner-directed series of impulses nonaligned with any externally ordered political or re- ligious ideology. The crux of the matter - the relationship of aesthetics to various ideologi- cal systems - involves not only the writer who, like Hemingway, may see his efforts as necessarily divorced from external value orderings but also the reader whose personal ideological allegiances may have a bearing, consciously or not, on the degree, kind, or type of critical rapprochement with a given work of literature. The subconscious temptation, of course, is to perceive art as "meaningful" if correlative to a favored ideological position and "non- meaningful" if not. But if we denigrate art for exhibiting and illuminating particularized ide- ology, noting the resultant wooden or stereotyped character and thematic didacticism, should we then praise nonintentional ambiguity in character or theme, the creation of no-meaning or a final vagueness as the alleged repre- sentative "theme" matching post-modernist ideological bewilderment? Or can a better answer be found in our historical and contemporary fascination not so much with the various ideologies constructed by man but with the essen- tial definition and the apparently anomalous behavior of man? Certainly, literary art, in its metaphorical response and in theme, has seemed constantly involved with the central problem of human identity and motivation. These primary human questions, asked over and over again through the long centuries, revolve repetitively around the issue of human definition, the search for a clear and definitive description of the nature of the human being. The second consideration - how should one live human life?-flows inevitably from whatever decisions were made regarding the first question of human definition and purpose. Of major importance, then, in dealing with historical evidence suggestive of worked-out human definitions is the evidential hypothesis of man's para- doxical predilection to shift categorical positions. This projection, so puzzling to us, views the human as both saint and sinner, angel and devil, a creature ap- parently incapable of accepting any given descriptive pattern as definitive. Man, in this construction, would seem to have a chameleon nature, unless (and again, the paradox overwhelms) one decides that an adaptable non-fixed nature does in fact constitute the single salient natural attribute. Or, one can ponder that the developed consciousness of man, a consciousness which seems to give him the ability (and desire) to act dichotomously and perversely, serves as his sole innate characteristic.</page><page sequence="2">98 COMMENTARIES AND REJOINDERS It is little wonder, this kind of evidence suggests, that a multitude of "final human definitions" have been presented to us through the centuries, each definition claiming ultimate truth, yet each unique gestalt strangely generative from the same pool of evidence. Do the varying historical gestalts, however, give evidence of the final tri- umph of the artist throughout history: the constant awareness, sometimes acute, sometimes dim, that man is somehow one, yet a multitude; that man is both microcosm and macrocosm of our universe; that man can be cipher and infinity at the same moment? And the art that evolves from these multi- faceted perceptions is not a reflection of man as he should be according to some particular political or religious orthodoxy but rather a vision of man as he seems to be to the individual artist writing at a particular time. Unless the individual character is lost in allegorical or symbolic abstraction, he is of interest to the artist not as carrier of one or another value systems, but as a being who moves, talks, thinks, laughs, feels, hates, loves, and, finally, ponders his own existence. That is to say that art, regardless of how from time to time we may try to squirm out of this necessity, can function successfully only if the artist creates both a cast of characters with whom we can readily identify and empathize, and a series of actions which we agree is correlative, even in sym- bolic form, to our own experience. The concern is human: the artist may use as subject butterflies, cockroaches, or great whales, but these mythopoeic or archetypal nonhuman bases are transmuted through grasp of metaphor into human fascinations. To the artist in history--and most certainly in the 20th century--life's the thing; and to the extent that nature, thought of here as that multiphasic raw material of both our internal bodily life and our external environment, has been perceived as hindrance to life-fulfillment (or life itself, in the recog- nition of mortality), our centric anthropomorphism has caused some to define nature as enemy to ideal human value systems. The prima facie evidence, however, suggests the paradox that the source of human endeavor can also be its scourge and this can be psychologically and philosophically bedeviling. A sound example is Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises which utilizes an opening Biblical quotation to point to the ironic contrast between transitory man and apparently eternal nature. The primary characters in the novel fight a futile battle against both the unfulfilled demands of their own "nature" and the environmental "nature" which proves meaningless, hostile, a "joke" on human aspirations. The "joke," however, is based on the inability of the char- acters to break away from extant value systems and human definitions con- nected to these systems no longer applicable, from Hemingway's point of view, to contemporary man. It is impossible, therefore, to evaluate the novel relative to its adherence or not to a particular religious or political value system, unless one simplistically and quite unfairly denigrates the work as counter-productive in character development, action, or theme to whatever ideology has been chosen as "correct." The novel's reality, finally, is its own. John Barth's remarkable short story, "Night-Sea Journey," is another case in point. The tone of the story is lyrical, the language richly metaphorical, and the form at first allegorical. As the reader moves deeper into metaphor,</page><page sequence="3">COMMENTARIES AND REJOINDERS 99 however, the primary allegorical structure expands outward through inten- tional ambiguity to include multiple layers of symbolic meaning, each con- nected to the central metaphor of some kind of creature/swimmer who finds himself in a vast, dark sea, swimming toward what may be a distant shore, the motile sperm in its fecundating journey. The narrator/swimmer wonders why he is where he is, and what he should do; his reflections and his final decision to keep swimming toward some force constitute all the "action" in the story. On the primary allegorical level, of course, the creature in the sea is man, the sea is human life in nature, and the swimming process is human desire to find cogent meaning in life. The distant shore in the story is perhaps final human definition and purpose, yet it remains tantalizingly beyond reach. Barth, at one point or another in the narrative, capsulizes the major historic political and religious ideologies in symbolic allusive form for consideration and evaluation on the part of the swimmer. The orthodoxies are rejected, yet at the end of the story, instead of "sinking" into a nihilistic mode, he finds and accepts as a valid motivation for human life, for "swimming," the great SHE force - illusive, mysterious, non-definable, yet triumphantly present. Thus Barth creates, through a series of rationally ordered symbols, a final aesthetic gestalt which accurately reflects the wonder of multi-dimensional man and his political and religious preoccupations. The meaning of life here seems to be life itself; and Barth, in declining to advocate any particular political or religious orthodoxy as singularly correct, ends by speaking for all positions, allowing individual definitions and per- ceptions of the SHE force in the narrative. All seek to reach the "distant shore," and this expressed "yes reaction" toward continued life struggles, re- gardless of apparent paradox or ultimate futility, generates interesting tenta- tive definitions of man as the searcher and human purpose as the search. The suggestion, of course, is that valid aesthetics, that is, artistic construc- tions which live on in our imaginations, have the capacity to transcend par- ticular ideologies by focusing directly on the myriad possibilities of individual human personality and character. And that we can make a better world, not by forcing characters or actions into fixed molds, or slipping into propaganda or polemics, but by understanding each other through a free aesthetic pro- cess of identification and empathy. And to do this the artist must feel no constraints, must feel relieved of any need to promulgate a given ideology or define good or bad along the lines of a particular moral or ethical system. Hemingway's concept of "doing well" reminds us that aesthetic integrity, as perceived only by the individual artist, need never be feared by free men in a free society. The quest toward aesthetic truth can only enhance political or religious orthodoxies if the systems are operationally valid and if they have real currency in the intellectual market place. If this strength exists, the sys- tems emerge unconsciously, automatically, from the artist's own condition of human freedom and find their way, therefore, quite naturally into character, action, and theme. The artist, in short, speaks most profoundly when most profoundly free. Fran Polek Gonzaga University</page><page sequence="4">100 COMMENTARIES AND REJOINDERS Notes 1.

THE VALIDITY OF PERSONAL RESPONSE A student confronting a work of art for the first time in an introductory art history or art appreciation course is often capable of making only one re- sponse: "I like it" or "I don't like it." This kind of statement has become anathema to instructors everywhere. At best we react with mild annoyance or suppressed satisfaction when the predictable undercurrent of sophomoric groans or sighs greets a slide flashed upon the auditorium screen, and we condescendingly pause while the spasm spends itself. However, I would like to suggest that personal response might actually assist the meaningful discussion of art, in the classroom as well as in the museum or faculty lounge. Our bias against the validity of subjective responses to art may be based on the assumption that all relevant statements concerning any discipline must share the capability of being publicly verifiable, of being based on evi- dence which may be examined and evaluated by others. "I like it" or "I don't like it" is thus a non-institutional assertion, being public only in its conclusion. What precludes discussion of personal responses to art, I would suggest, is the absence of a nontechnical, lay language by which a work may be ana- lyzed vis-a-vis the observer. If art has the power and the charm to move us, we must concede that statements expressing how and why it moves us might be of some value, if they could be clearly articulated. Perhaps what we really disdain is the introductory student's inability to articulate coherently why he or she does or does not like a work. The issue is not entirely the avoidance of value judgments. If pressed, we might each admit that we "like" or "don't like," to one degree or another, every work we encounter. Yet we somehow feel that our bases are more sound, our tastes more informed, our values more legitimatized by our years of exposure and study. We feel that we can safely state, "This is a master- piece," or "That is camp," and explain why. We can flash our light arrows here and there upon the screen of our darkened classroom and publicly demonstrate the genius of a work's composition, the skill of its rendering and coloration, the successes of its attempted techniques, the complexities of its iconography, and the richness of its ideas. To seal our cases, we can present former, contemporaneous, or later works which we can similarly establish as inferior or superior to it or which our original demonstrably influenced or was influenced by. We can overwhelm our students with the range and facility of our historical knowledge and our visual discrimination. It is possible for us to do so primarily because we have mastered a vocab- ulary designed to express formal, internal, verifiable qualities of the work and its historical context. It is this language and this method which our students</page></plain_text>
