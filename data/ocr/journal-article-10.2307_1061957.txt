<plain_text><page sequence="1">Carl Hentze GODS AND DRINKING SERPENTS More than a half-century has passed since the Leipzig sinologist Conrady stated that the achievements of research in ethnology should be included in sinology, and today we take his claim for granted. In his time it aroused attention and opposition. Sinology at that time was a discipline which was attempting anxiously to construct a wall isolating the culture of ancient China from every other culture. The fiction was to be maintained that there had originally taken place in China a cultural development which was incomparable to any other in the world. However, as Conrady challenged preconceived ideas, even he had not considered that not only those cultures which can still be understood through direct contact, but also those which have long since perished are ethnological entities. In short, it is not possible to construct a new Great Wall of China between ethnology and archeology. Unawareness of the discoveries and excavations out- side China no longer excuses foolish errors either in the evaluation of objects found on Chinese territory or in textual research in sinology. If the ethnological and sociological observations made and conclusions arrived at outside China must be referred to for the understanding and decoding of textually verifiable occurrences in ancient China, as Marcel Granet did almost forty years ago, then objects found outside China can also contribute much to decipher- Translated from the German by Joyce Adams. 179</page><page sequence="2">Gods and Drinking Serpents ing the meaning of objects found within Chinese territory. In certain cases, archeological finds from ancient Oriental high cul- tures even provide the keys to the understanding of objects excavated inside China. Some objects from the earliest cultures of the Near East, the discovery of which has been made known only recently, will prove the correctness of these methodological demands. I shall begin with well-known objects. Figures 1-4 show a late Neolithic Chinese ceramic representation with a human face. For years I have continued to reproduce and discuss this extraordin- arily important find in almost all my books because every time something new could be said about it.1 I need to repeat my earlier conclusions only briefly. What is decisive, however, is the addi- tional result of comparison with new finds from the Tigris- Euphrates Valley. The Neolithic ceramic group comprised under the name Pail- Shan, Kansu Province, contains only funerary ware.2 Thus it is certain from the outset that these must have religious significance. The head of an anthropomorphic god with a pair of horns is represented. On the back of the head hangs a serpent in such a way that the serpent's head appears on the crown of the head between the hornlike growths and in the very center of the head above the nose. The head itself rests on a star-shaped base divided into nineteen sections. Six sections are filled out with two lozenges apiece, making twelve lozenges in all. Each of the other thirteen sections contains one undulating line. The numbers 12 and 13 indicate a lunar calendrical system. The god's face is flat like a disk and somewhat indented as well, so that it is almost plate- shaped. On this slightly indented disk, only the nose and eyebrows are in faint relief. Stripes run across the entire face of the god. These particulars are especially significant due to their corres- pondence to sacred images inside and outside China. We must not overlook any of these details, for only in this way will we perceive that they all belong together and that they are, moreover, re- garded from one object to another, flawlessly meshed and dove- tailed in their meaning. There is first of all the star shape of the base. Since this shape is duplicated in two more ceramic grave figures from Pan-Shan, 1 The latest summary is found in my Tod, Auferstehung, Weltordnung (Zurich, 1955), pp. 176 ff. 2 J. G.

Were these figures at the same time star-shaped lids of vessels ? This remains uncertain, though there are comparable objects of this kind from primitive America.3 The stripes on the face are common to all these figures (Figs. 1-6); on one of the figures they form zigzag lines (Fig. 5) which are intended to portray a weeping god over whose face the water flows as tears and as saliva. This can be easily recognized in the numer- ous primitive American parallels (Figs. 7-9), in which the water flows not only over the face but also, as saliva, over the lips.4 The painting of the face indicates only one of the characteristics of this figure, and we must not draw the premature and one-sided conclusion that we have before us nothing more than a god of water and fertility. Only more thorough-going investigations can give us an accurate picture. It is generally advisable not to form an oversimplified concep- tion of the historically early religions. This is also true of those so-called primitive races which we have actually been able to investigate. Moreover, the religions of a Neolithic age already in decline are, in view of their advanced level of development, not at all comparable with those of primitive races. The oversimplifica- tion of prehistoric forms of religion and thought merely serves to constrain a historical development into the shortest possible span of time. For this is a basic approach which was common before 1900. Even if it is still employed occasionally, it is and remains outdated. Such an attitude was possible when almost nothing was known of a Neolithic age, nothing at all of a Paleolithic age, and, concerning primitive races, only what could be made more or less compatible with prejudiced systems of research. It makes an anti- quated impression for a discipline to ignore its own development and progress so that it may continue to support a standpoint which was customary seventy years ago. The god with the tear marks appears also in a find from earliest Mesopotamia (Fig. 10). We need only place this ceramic from the Tigris-Euphrates Valley next to those from China (Figs. 4-6) to comprehend immediately that we have before us the Chinese ver- sion of an older Mesopotamian prototype: it is the same weeping god. Moreover, it too has under the neck the points converging in a star shape (Fig. 10). In this instance the points of the star are 3 M.

Figs. 13-19. 181</page><page sequence="4">Gods and Drinking Serpents painted on and the entire figure is the upper portion of a sacred vessel. Comparison with the Chinese objects (Figs. 1-6) proves to us that the painting of the vessel (Fig. 10), and thus especially the star points, are more than arbitrary decoration, and that they originate in a fundamental meaning. The conjecture that the Chinese heads (Figs. 1-6) were once lids for vessels is somewhat reinforced. The close and frequently emphasized relationship between the Neolithic Kansu pottery and the ceramic products of the earliest Mesopotamian cultures is probably nowhere else as evident as in the present instance. And indeed, any questioning of this relationship was always undertaken unmethodically, that is, without any valid reasoning whatever,5 and was only intended to separate Chinese culture from its very beginnings rigidly from every other culture in Asia. We shall now examine the striking fanlike decoration on the star-shaped base of the Chinese Neolithic pottery (Figs. 1-4). I have already said that in the arrangement of the decor, the twelve lozenges lie opposite thirteen undulating lines. In view of the painted traces of tears and saliva and the intended star or ray form, the division of the total number of nineteen sections into two adjacent, basically different groups is not to be dismissed as aesthetic frivolity. It is moreover obvious that one motif, let us say only undulating lines or only lozenges, could have been employed throughout. However, this was not at all what was intended. As will be further verified below, the numbers 12 and 13 are used in the lunar calendar; the number 13 indicates the epagomenal adjustment. This intention in regard to the lozenges and the undulating lines can be demonstrated on the basis of other examples, first of all from China itself, and indeed from the same Neolithic discovery site. On the Pan-Shan vessel (Fig. 11), the lozenge system is drawn within a circle, which itself is inclosed by an S-shaped spiral. In the center of each lozenge a lunar crescent is painted. We count ten crescents for each circle. Since the circle with the lozenges is repeated only three times on the rounded surface of the vessel, we arrive at a total number of thirty crescents, making a month of thirty days. The S-spirals curling under in opposite directions indicate movement in opposition, which we find in unmistakable form in China in the Yin-Yang symbol. It can also be encountered 5 Cf. Werner Miiller's pertinent comments in Die heilige Stadt (Stuttgart, 1961) p. 258. 182</page><page sequence="5">in objects from the period of the "Contending States," as a very recent excavation proves (Fig. 12).6 The number 3, which is expressed in the three circles with lozen- ges as well as in the number of crescents (Fig. 11), has epagomenal significance.7 Then let us recall the 6 x 2 lozenges on the back of the head (Figs. 1-4) from the same discovery site, and the thirteen sections with undulating lines, an arrangement which, as already stated, corresponds to epagomenal calculation. This fact is still more pertinent when we single out another vessel from the funer- ary ware of Pan-Shan (Fig. 13). Here we see that the spiral incloses a circle, in the middle of which are found undulating lines and, specifically, the very character for shui (water) which is familiar from Chinese paleography.8 It could be objected that the crescent-shaped marks of Figure 11 came about purely by accident in the decoration of the vase. Such an objection is proved invalid when additional vessels, still from the same discovery site, are examined. Figure 14 is a Pan- Shan vessel seen from above. There are two S-spirals, which pro- vide the setting for four circular fields. Three circles contain three lunar quadrants with a total of twelve crescents. In a fourth circle are the raindrops. In the face of such evidence, there can be no objection and no doubt: the decor is quite consciously differen- tiated. The idea of the decoration as accidental or as aesthetic frivolity is not a possible working hypothesis, but rather results from faulty observation. In addition, we also find these lozenges with drawings at their centers on bronze vessels of the Shang period (Fig. 15). Again the count indicates calendar numbers.9 The bronze vessels belonged to a death-rite (Totenritus). They must not be regarded apart from this, their inherent designation. Here we pause for a moment to reflect: what is the moon-god with its traces of tears and saliva, with the water marks, with the numbers used in calendrical reckoning, with the serpent on its head and back, doing among the dead? The moon is a visible symbol of death and renewal. It is well known that water belongs to many moon-gods, not only in China, but also in almost the entire world. The serpent sheds its skin and symbolizes renewal. f Report on the Excavations of the Relics in the Wei-district (1956) (Chinese). 7 W.

Again and again for millenniums man has tried somehow to take hold of time. Time can only be overcome when it is taken hold of. The Moon, the character for "water," and the serpent are visible things. Time is an abstraction. It is a yearn- ing for knowledge about the lawful order in nature. Here begins a road of analyzing and abstracting which can never again in the history of mankind be abandoned. Somehow, then, in the course of milleniums, this way of analytical cognition must be combined with what Goethe called "anschauende Urteilskraft," or "discern- ment through beholding." The "whole truth" cannot be deduced from analytical abstracting knowledge. Coming to grips with time is a fundamental problem, and in view of the cyclic concept it concerns the dead perhaps more than the living. Time is painted on the circular or square vessel, on the circular, star-shaped base of the head (Figs. 1-4). How could it be otherwise? Time extends in all four directions; it revolves in a circle; it is cyclic, and that is recurrence; it is part of ancestor-worship; it can be calculated. Pictorial representations serve to make it comprehensible, to put it at our disposal. They enable us to take possession of time. That is the attempt to bring the abstraction into the image. Calculable, determinable time is a shield against chaos. Here the quantitative- causal tendency exists alongside visual perception. Both must sub- mit to being combined in a way which is never completely satis- factory in the attempt to satisfy the longing for a "whole truth." We touch upon an essential characteristic of the religions and the history of religions, and thus of cognition. The investigation of the significance of such phenomena must not be underestimated. It is significant that today, particularly from the modern natural sciences, the warning is heard: in the pursuit of differential-causal regularities in nature, "discernment through beholding" must not be forgotten if a total view of life is to be obtained. We are confronted with a development in which the humanities have lagged farther and farther behind the natural sciences for well over a century. This was probably inevitable. However, today the natural sciences are seeking the way back from and out of the rationalistic-positivistic past. Many scholars in the humanities are somewhat perplexed at this necessary reversal and participate in it only hesitantly. In short, it is sometimes possible for the humanities to fail in the very task to which they have been called. This survey was necessary to summarize the results to which we have been able to advance thus far. From this background of 184</page><page sequence="7">insights already attained, those now to follow will emerge more clearly. I have already shown that the weeping god with the flow of saliva in China goes back to far older Mesopotamian gods. If the inventory of decor motifs and symbols of Neolithic painted ceramics arose under Western influence, what about the calendar lozenges ? When excavations were undertaken beneath the palace of Phaistos on Crete,10 a ceramic vessel from the Middle Minoan era was found there (Fig. 16). The decoration is a circle surrounded by rays. As on the Chinese heads (Figs. 1-6), we find a center encircled by rays (Fig. 16). The inner circle is divided into squares. In the squares are dots. The decoration is damaged here and there. The two dots in the far left in the third or fourth row from the top must have corresponded to two dots in the same rows on the far right. One of these dots has disappeared completely; others are only partially gone and can still be identified. We arrive at a total of thirty dots, thus at a number used in lunar calculations. In the same way, we count twenty-four dark rays and twenty-four light ones. The decoration of the vessel is shown clearly to be related to the cult and the stars; now we can also perceive its correspondence to the ceramics from the Pan-Shan group with their lozenge decoration (Fig. 11), and to the Shang bronze vessels with lozenges and central dots (Fig. 15). But what is the serpent doing in the very center of the god's head (Figs. 1-4)? Why is it located just there? I have already said that it sheds and renews its skin. But this does not exhaust its significance. To comprehend combinations of ideas one must proceed more thoroughly, and this can only be achieved when new data, which broaden our horizon, are brought into the investi- gation. Included in the exhibit "7000 Years of Art in Iran," which originated in Paris and was shown afterward in various other European cities, was a clay figure of a ram, which until then had been barely known. It was represented in two versions from different collections. In our reproductions of both figures, Figures 17-19 belong together, and Figure 20 is the second version. Before we proceed to the meaning of the animal sculptures, we must make clear what animal is involved. The Paris catalogue refers to a bull, as does a German one from the exhibit in the Hiigel 10 Doro Levi, "Discoveries beneath the Palace of Phaistos, Crete," Illustrated London News (January 19, 1952). 1* 185</page><page sequence="8">Gods and Drinking Serpents Villa, Essen, 1962. The archeologist does not always have a hand- book of mammal zoology on his desk, nor is he always a frequent visitor to zoos. Perhaps he should be concerned with both from time to time. On the animal's horns, horizontal convolutions, or more accurately knottings, are reproduced with all possible clarity. If it is meant to be a species of cattle, it could only be an Asiatic water buffalo, but this designation proves impossible, since the horns of water buffalo are usually angular and never round. Round bull's horns with knots and horizontal convolutions do not exist, only those with a pronounced sideward flattening. If sheep's horns are not round, they are at least less flattened and they also have horizontal ridges. On the colored cover illustration of the Essen catalogue is a bronze ibex from ancient Iran. Its horns are authentically provided with gilded knots. In this catalogue, it is not referred to as a bull. To be sure, there is in Iran neither a species of cattle nor one of wild sheep whose horns bend upward so abruptly, so like a lunar crescent, as on the two sculptures. Thus there is an arbitrariness in the representation which must not be overlooked. One may ask whether this question of designation is so important ? Yes, it is important, and I will give the reason now. Between the ram's horns, in the very center, a serpent raises its head. What can its purpose be ? On a Kudurru (a boundary-stone) of the time of Nabukudrossor I (500 B.C.), the well-known symbols of the sun-god Samas, the Venus-like goddess Istar and the moon- god Sin are united (Fig. 21). The symbol of the moon-god Sin is a serpent that drinks from a lunar crescent, from the dish containing the light of the new moon. Thus, the serpent insures its eternal transformation and renewal, for it is after all an earth-bound creature that lives only upon or under the earth, in darkness. Thus, it must shed its skin, which means that it first crawls off, appearing to die and stiffening, but then slips out of the old skin and begins a new life. And now we know why the ram's horns are somewhat forcibly bent into the shape of a crescent; it is because the serpent does not drink from the horns, but from the crescent which they form. Now the thread of the discovery which we have just made can be easily unraveled to some extent. I have also found the serpent drinking from the dish between the crescent horns on a pottery fragment from the proto-Elamitic period (Fig. 22). This time it is again a ram, also with a horn curvature of the type under dis- cussion.ll 11 Memnoires de la delegation en Perse, Vol. XII, Fig. 397. 186</page><page sequence="9">From Tepe Mussian comes a clay animal figure which I cannot identify more exactly because I am not familiar with the object itself, but only with the reproduction.12 Therefore I cannot say whether the horns have been broken off on the side of the head or whether perhaps a horse is to be portrayed (Fig. 23). At any rate, the serpent is drinking from the lunar crescent. Moreover, the animal figure is intentionally painted black and white in order to indicate the transition from darkness to light, death to life. Again the serpent is drinking from the dish of immortality. Only now can we say that this image is no different from the Neolithic Chinese figure (Figs. 1-4). The serpent appears just above the indented plate-shaped face, and it drinks from this plate, which causes streaks of water to run across the god's face. The serpent licks at the water. The face becomes the dish. In this face, in this dish, moon water is gathered. Between light and darkness there is a passing of time and a tem- poral problem. First there is a spatial problem, because the moon as heavenly body wanes, because there are partial or total eclipses of the moon, and because this heavenly body wanders, traversing space. That is the measurable element which leads to the act of abstraction. But the more fundamental reason for this order, why and whence death and life came to be, is immeasurable. It belongs to the realm of experience, perception, and reflection. The measur- able and abstracting element and the immeasurable lying beyond it must meet and be condensed to a unity. Thus, we find on the flanks of the ram (Figs. 17-20) the calendrical reckoning, again in the form of lozenges with a central dot. The lozenges are aligned on a band and form a light contrast to the two sides of a dark border. I was able to hold one of the two Iranian ram's figures in my hand, and could thus count the lozenges. The result is not guaranteed to be correct since the figure has suffered during such a long period. The excavation was not scientific; the condition at the time of excavation is unknown and restorations have been undertaken. The number of lozenges on the left side is uncertain; some forty lozenges could still be counted. On the right side are forty-two lozenges, a number from the lunar calendar. In order to reach a better conclusion, I would have had to hold the other figure in my hand as well. I could only look at it through the glass of the display case, and even the very good photographs sent me do not facilitate an accurate count, especially as this piece was also restored in large measure. 12 G. Wilke, Religion der Indogermanen (Leipzig, 1923), p. 136. 187</page><page sequence="10">Gods and Drinking Serpents The results which we can obtain from the consideration of the two ram's figures are not yet at an end. We have seen the serpent in the middle of the head and between the two horn-like growths of the Chinese anthropomorphic god (Figs. 1-4). We also found there the lozenges as calendrical elements, and we found the very extensive correspondence of this Chinese head to its much older Mesopotamian predecessor (Fig. 10). But we have also just seen the symbol of the Mesopotamian moon-god Sin (Fig. 21), and on the left beside it the symbol with eight rays for Samas, the sun-god, and on the right that of Istar. the Venus-like goddess. The symbol for Samag consists of many pointed rays. Precisely such rays form the base of the Chinese god (Figs. 1-4). They are the symbol of the sun-god Samas which is chiseled into the stone of the Kudurru (Fig. 21), this time laid flat and brought into relief under the head. Thus the symbolic elements which, on the one hand, belong to the sun-god and. on the other. to the moon-god are related. Here the circle of our investigation is already flawlessly joined. because we also find the circle of pointed rays under the neck of the very old Mesopotamian god (Fig. 10). Here too, then, symbols which in themselves are different have been welded into a unity. If with this finding as a starting point we again regard the rays and the fanlike decoration on the base of the Chinese head (Figs. 1-4), we can understand better the numbers 13 and 12 (for sections with undulating lines and with double lozenges): the lunar and solar symbols have blended into a unity and the different numbers actually indicate the necessary corrections of the lunar calendar through epagomenal calculation, as has already been pre- supposed. My explanations may be surprising, even irritating, because they are new. Only one thing cannot be disputed: that everything I say can be seen clearly and that it can be proven in detail for that reason. There can be no doubt of the Mesopotamian origin of this astral symbolism. Therefore, the conclusion must also be drawn that in the high cultures of Mesopotamia-starting with the oldest representation (Fig. 10), that is, about 3500 B.C., up to 500 B.C., the time of the three gods on the Kudurru (Fig. 21), and surely continuing subsequently-there existed a body of thought set down and transmitted in images. The finding of the two clay figures of the rams has enriched to an unusual extent our possibilities of gaining deeper insights into ancient complexes of religious ideas. We want to utilize these possi- 188</page><page sequence="11">bilities still further, in that we proceed step by step, cautiously securing each step before we dare to take the next. We can prove one more important fact by comparing with the ram the three divine symbols on the Kudurru. The symbol for Sin, the moon-god, completely corresponds to the serpent drinking from between the horns. The clay figures of the ram were ritual objects (Kultobjekte). Thus, it was possible to unearth two versions of the ram at once, and surely there were very many more versions. But if the main element of this portrayal can only be understood in terms of the cult, then it is no longer possible to dismiss the remaining decoration as merely aesthetically ornamental and un- related to any meaning. It can only be a scriptlike depiction coming from an era still without script or an era during which script was still completely dependent on pictorial representation. That is a further reason for the blending of abstracting elements with purely objective ones. We have already recognized that the lozenge system corresponds to a calendar, that this calendar belongs to the crescent horns and the drinking serpent, that the serpent is renewed, the calendar is renewed, time is renewed, the moon is renewed. Nothing, no detail stands for itself. In that case, the zigzag lines on the front of the ram's breast have their owni meaning as well: they are the water lines with which we are already familiar. We have observed the zigzag lines which formed the flow of tears and saliva on the faces of the god. Why are these zigzag lines located on the ram's breast? Because it stood facing the west. Facing the west, the serpent drinks the water of life from the dish of the lunar crescent, that is, from between the horns. The west is evening. I am anticipating a step in the chain of reasoning and shall explain the connection of the ram to the west with more certitude. For this, to be sure, inspection of completely different objects is required. Yet we did not want to leave the ram's figures without considering them as thoroughly as possible. Moreover, we have said nothing as yet concerning the form of the rams. In the exhibition catalogue the term "vessel" is used, and an article by Ghirshman even refers to a rhyton.13 In fact, there are many rhyta in animal form, and we can agree to the inclusion of all Oriental vessels in animal form under a common denominator, so that the formal element is the determining one. But ought one to refer to these sculptured rams as vessels merely because they are hollow and have a round opening in front like 13 R. Ghirshman, "Le Rhyton en Iran," Art. A4.ie, Vol. XXV, No. 1 (1962), Fig. 10. 189</page><page sequence="12">Gods and Drinking Serpents the rim of a vase ? At the very front, a sculptured animal's head emerges from this opening. One can drink from every rhyton. But whoever wanted to drink from this vessel would inevitably realize that the liquid divides inside the opening to the left and right of the small animal's head, pours out in two streams, cannot reach the mouth at all, and runs over chin and clothing. Thus the object cannot have been used for a ritual drink at all. If it were a vessel, it would be horizontal, but in its actual form it can hold no liquid. Moreover, there is on the opposite side, on the rear part of the ram, a small hole. This hole has not been bored as an afterthought, but was made in the clay while it was still soft. If in a ritual act the priest lifted up the ram with the head turned upward and closed off the rear hole with one finger, it could be filled with a liquid which was at once allowed to run out. The ram is not a drinking vessel in the sense of a rhyton. Why then the small animal's head in the front at the rim of the opening? What kind of animal is it intended to be ? In spite of first impressions, it is probably not a serpent's head, although it looks like one. The head of the ram from Prince Firdu's collection (Figs. 17-19) has in my estimation been inauthentically restored. On the other vessel, from the Mossadek Collection in Frankfort, this head has been preserved (Fig. 20), while on the other hand, the serpent's head between the ram's horns has been broken off. I was able to hold the clay sculpture from the Mossadek Collection in my hand and study it thoroughly. It is to be expected that a serpent's body would be visible in the hollow, but there is only a head. It is precisely the serpent's body, not its head, which would seem essen- tial to the observer, for there is really no occasion to represent a reptile by means of its head. This is especially true here, for the serpent lies in its entire length along the ram's back. For symbolic purposes it is crucial that the serpent's body shed its skin. How- ever, in the case of the clay sculpture from the Mossadek Collection the head in the opening is square, like the large ram's head above. On one side of the small head in the opening are small scars where something, probably horns, has been broken off. We would then have a small replica of the large ram's head: the small ram as new- moon light, shining forth from the hollow, that is, the vessel. This interpretation of the small head seems to me possible in view of the incontestable meaning of the main representation. It gains probability when we note a similar representation on an animal- shaped Shang ritual vessel in China: in front, the large ram as the main subject, then on the handle, in the very back and below, the 190</page><page sequence="13">small ram (Figs. 24, 25) with its head inclined downward. Liberated from darkness, it emerges from the jaws of another symbolic animal, which spews it forth. If this representation existed in China alone, I would have reservations. But that is not the case: in the three bronzes from the Nezu Collection the large skull masks are repeated in reduced size on the legs, with the ram among them.14 Something should be said in addition about the style and dating of the clay ram's figures. The catalogue of the exhibition "7000 Years of Art in Iran" dates the sculptures at 1000-800 B.C. They are said to have been found in Tepe Giyan. The style is intimately related to that of the painted pottery from Susa. The parallel angles above the decorative band with the lozenges are, in my opinion, a typical element of the style of Susa II. I am inclined to believe that the ram's figures must be dated about 1000 years earlier. The catalogue of the Munich exhibition gives 3000-2000 B.C. as the date. We would also find in the religious significance of the decoration a link with the ceramics of Susa I and II. More decisive, in my opinion, would be a further reason for an early date: as will be seen below, an intimate iconographic relationship obvious to everyone can be proved between, on the one hand, the Iranian ram's figures and, on the other, the Chinese bronzes in animal form from the Shang period, which are dated at around 1400-1300 B.C. But since the migration did not go from east to west, as proven by other examples collected for this article, a late date for the Iranian figures is incongruent with historical development. To carry out the plan of this investigation, I must discuss the vessels of Susa I and II somewhat further before proceeding to the Chinese figures. An ibex is painted on a goblet (Fig. 26). Its picture is framed. To the right and left of this frame are two black triangles, the vertexes of which meet. The triangles joined at the vertexes have been identified by Anton Moortgat as symbolizing the phases of the moon.15 Now the body of the ram also consists of two similarly joined triangles or, if viewed correctly, of a double axe. According to what we already know about double axes and triangles meeting at the vertexes (which indeed in Crete [Fig. 27] are joined without 14 Cf. my "Lichtsymbolik und die Bedeutung von Auge und Sehen im iltesten China" (Studium Generale, XIII, No. 6 [1960], 333-51). 15 A. Moortgat, Die Entstehung der sumerischen Hochkultur (Leipzig, 1945), p. 22 and Ill. 4. Cf. also B. Hrozny, Die dlteste Geschichte Vorderasiens und Indiens (Prague, 1943), p. 33. 191</page><page sequence="14">Gods and Drinking Serpents differentiation to the bull's head16), there is no sense of style involved, but rather what A. Moortgat calls the "magic symbolic value" of painted ceramic decoration. Inside the circle formed by the crescent horns of the ibex, there is a row of obtuse angles connected by a thin central line. That is the well-known ancient Sumerian written character for plant. On another Sumerian bowl (Fig. 28), the ibex can be seen again, this time characterized by his small beard. Beneath and between the animals is painted the character for water, as a series of parallel M's or as double undulating lines. We do not intend to discuss all the details of this decoration from Susa. We are here only concerned with proving that, like the ram, the ibex with its curved horns is an element of lunar and aquatic symbolism. The ram, both as three-dimensional sculpture and as sacred vessel, occurs in China (Fig. 29) with exactly the same characteris- tics as in earliest Iran (Figs. 17-20). The Chinese animal sculpture is of bronze. Between the markedly crescent-shaped horns of the Chinese ram appears a serpent-like creature.17 Without a doubt we are confronted with the same iconographic conjucture as in Iran. in which the serpent lies between the crescent horns with its head on the crown of the ram's head and drinks there (Figs. 17-20, 22-23). Above the front limbs of the Chinese bronze (Figs. 29-30), on the right and left sides, there is an eye in high relief. In front of the eye (in the photograph [Fig. 29], to the left of it) is a bird's beak. The entire figure of the bird is portrayed in highly orna- mental "baroque" style. It is executed so that it faces the same direction as the ram. The disk of feathers around the bird's eye allows us to determine what kind of bird is intended, namely an owl. The owl's facial disk is a striking phenomenon. Even when a disk of feathers is found around the eyes of other birds, for instance some species of pheasant, this nevertheless is nowhere as evident as among owls with their frontally fixed eyes. This is still more apparent in the case of a naturalistic owl's figure which also appears under the ram, that is, in subordinate position (Fig. 25). The beak appears in sharp profile, behind it and to the right, the eartuft of a horned owl stands out in high relief, and at the foot 16 Ren6 Dussaud, Les Civilisations prehelleniques dans le bassin de la mer Egee (Paris, 1914), Fig. 245. 17 In this case, probably not a reptile, but a salamander larva, as I have observed elsewhere; cf. my Bronzegerdt, Kultbauten, Religion im altesten China (Antwerp, 1951), P1. CIII, Figs. 292-297. The intention is the same as for the serpent: it must always be a creature that sheds its skin, changes, is renewed. 192</page><page sequence="15">of the bronze is the owl's claw. The wings have been formed into serpents. Obvious logic tells us that the owl can belong only to evening and night; therefore, the main representation of the bronze ram's figure faces the west. This confirms a statement which we have already made concerning the Iranian ram (Figs. 17-20). A serpent-like creature is again stretched out between the horns of the Chinese ram (Fig. 25) and across its back. The group of Chinese ritual vessels just described, with the ram's head and with the serpent between the horns, is connected closely enough with the group of ritual vessels now to be discussed that the following assertion may be made: these two groups are so tightly meshed that they can be understood only when viewed together. As a typical representative of this second group let us discuss Figure 31. The main figure does not have ram's horns, but rather two goblet-shaped horns. That they are really goblets is evident not only from the form, which resembles that of ritual bronze goblets of the type Tsun and Ku, but apart from this, in that the paleographic symbol for ch'uan (flowing water) appears on it (Fig. 32). Between these horns in goblet form lies a butterfly caterpillar (Fig. 3 la, b), a creature which, like the serpent, sheds its skin and is transformed. In addition, a serpent is stretched out over the animal's back. According to everything we have been able to discern, the caterpillars and serpents drink from the vessels, that is, from the horns in goblet shape, the miraculous water of renewal and immortality.' Why those must be goblets instead of a dish (i.e., crescent) is explained naturally by the following facts: In the primitive culture of Susa18 originates the representation (Fig. 33) in which the serpents drink from the goblet which the goddess carries on her head, or in which they hang down the goddess' back and creep upward (Fig. 34). Why then, on the Chinese bronzes, first the crescent horn as a dish (Fig. 29) and then again the goblet horns (Figs. 31, 32)? The solution to what is only apparently a problem is not very difficult: the horizontal moon- dish (lunar crescent in the Orient) is the light of the new moon, and the goblets filled with water which appear as horns can only be the dark of the moon. The alternatives: in one case, the goddess with the serpent and goblet on her head (Fig. 33); in the other, an animal figure with a serpent or caterpillar on its head and back (Fig. 31), are just as easily understood. It may be assumed as 18 Memoires de la dedlgation en Perse, Vol. XII. Figs. 382, 388. 193</page><page sequence="16">Gods and Drinking Serpents generally known that Artemis appears both in human and in animal form. The Diana of Ephesus appears in anthropomorphic form with the goblet on her head. All imaginable animals crawl over her body and cloak. The theriomorphic god in China (Fig. 31) appears with goblets on its head and all conceivable animals creep over its body. In both cases a mother-goddess is intended. One more noteworthy element presents itself alongside the many lines of reasoning which converge here to combine the representa- tions discussed above in terms of cultural history, the history of religions, iconography, and the study of symbolism. In addition to the serpent (caterpillar), several bronze animal figures from ancient China have on their heads the figure of a bird, which also appears on the animal's back, either as three-dimensional sculpture or as relief (Figs. 29, 31). This combination-serpent between horns + bird on back-is not at all accidental, for we find it even in Egypt (Fig. 35). The serpent Uraus between the horns of the bull Apis is, to be sure, a solar symbol. However, the serpent plays a widely varied role in the Egyptian religion, as in the case of the chthonic serpent Apophis dismembered by Re. When and how an Egyptian dogma which arose only gradually led to the association of the serpent Uraus with the sun remains of necessity unclear. However, it is well known that the bull Apis must have been black and ornamented with definite light dots, just as the figure from Susa with the serpent on its head was decorated (Fig. 23). On the other hand, in the Egyptian representation, the falcon is sitting on the animal's back (Fig. 35). It is the symbol of the sun-god Re. The combination: animal's back+serpent+bird is obviously the same as in our Chinese examples (Figs. 29, 31). With this the parallels are not yet exhausted. "Birds on the neck or back of horned animals have been found in extensive distribu- tion in excavations from the Hallstatt period, from Northern and Southern Italy, Hungary, the Alpine countries and later from Western Switzerland."19 It has occurred to some authors that these birds are ox-peckers. Here too, the "terrible simplification" fails due to carelessly over- confident neglect of observation. The figure of the falcon Horus or a sparrow-hawk on the back of an animal is not an ox-pecker. On the well-known vases of Maikop we see a duck sitting on a Mouflon (a variety of sheep), a hawk upon a panther, another bird of prey 19 Summary in Hoernes, Vorgeschichte der Kunst, p. 482.

XXXIX-XL, p. 57. 194</page><page sequence="17">on a lion. By way of contrast, we find in a relief from a Chinese tomb interior of the Han period (Fig. 36) the ram's head in the center and, immediately adjacent to it on the right and on the left, sun-birds in the form of peacocks. These birds belong to the ram just as the falcon, the sun-bird of Re, belongs to the bull (Fig. 35). On the basis of these examples-and there are very many more of them-it seems to me completely evident why one must not dismiss birds on the animals' backs in every case as ox-peckers. Is the same thing not true of a Celtic representation (Fig. 37)? But then cranes on the back of a bull are a sight familiar to every zoologist! Perhaps they are ox-peckers after all? No, for the inscription refers to the bull with the three cranes, to a particular bull with a particular number of birds. Incidentally, on the other side of the stone appears the Celtic god Esu. Since we meet such symbolic birds on the backs of animals in earliest China, in archaic Greek art, in Hallstatt, etc., an Asian origin is not improbable. Now to be sure, one author states that Asian influence on the Celtic religions is out of the question.20 Lambrechts also includes in his book as a matter of course one of the most significant Celtic works of art in existence, the silver cauldron of Gundesstrup. He shows it in photographs from various sides. Unfortunately, one side has remained unknown to him: the very one with the elephants. Lambrechts' work is the only one up to now which undertakes the task of dealing with the subject in its entirety. After one such random sample we shall detain our- selves no more with this pretentiously titled book. The greatly predominating majority of these representations are those of bulls or rams to which the serpent on the head and the bird on the back are joined. Yet without abandoning the meaning- ful content of the religious images gathered for this article, we can state that the serpent on the head and the bird on the back do not appear solely among bulls or rams. I first remind the reader that our point of departure was a Neolithic anthropomorphic god (Figs. 1-4), that we also encounter this god in Susa (Figs. 33, 34) and that it can appear both in anthropomorphic and in therio- morphic form. Sometimes in China the serpent also lies upon the crown of the head and between the ears of the tiger. I include a reproduction of one of these instances (Fig. 38), a Shang bronze. The figure opposite the tiger's head, on the back of the bronze, is an owl whose wings cover the rear belly of the vessel. We have already stated that the owl as bird of evening and night can only 20 Pierre Lambrechts, Contribution a l'etude des divinites celtiques (Ghent, 1941). 195</page><page sequence="18">Gods and Drinking Serpents belong to the west. However, that the serpent accompanies the tiger is consistent with the iconographic purposes of the Shang representations. Subsequently the tiger becomes a well-known symbol of the west, but that is a late and limited development. The tiger is still seen in paintings on grave tiles of the Han period, painted alternately black and white. In every case its head is turned backward.21 The gesture and the difference in color are significant. For we have already found the same thing in the Shang period, in fact on the lid of that vessel (Figs. 25, 39a, b) which portrays as the main subject the ram with serpent-like creatures between the horns. Indeed, we see the tiger on this lid twice: once on the right turned toward the bird (upper world, light) and again on the left side turned toward the fish (lower world, darkness). I have been able to confirm the double role of the tiger in almost all my works, each time on the basis of new data. It too is the theriomorphic manifestation of a god. On a Chinese bronze portraying a stag I also found the bird on the stag's back along with the serpent (Fig. 40). Nor is there here any incongruence with the bronzes discussed above. The serpent is renewed, and the stag's antlers are also renewed every year. The serpent sheds its skin, and the stag's antlers are covered with a skin which is then peeled off. In contrast to other Chinese animal bronzes with a bird on the back, the bird on the stag's back is turned away from the principal figure. It would be superficial to assume in this particular case a lapse in the knowledge of religious inconography on the part of the bronze caster in the Shang period. This is the only case I have encountered up to now in which the bird on the animal's back turns away from the main figure. I cannot explain here in detail the particular reasons which demonstrate clearly the association of the stag with the sun in ancient Chinese ritual iconography.22 It is probably for this reason that the bird is placed differently on the stag's back than on the other animal figures, that is, backward. The following can also be ascertained: on the belly of the vessel, right under the stag's head, a large picture of the sun-bird is to be seen. It is located on the stag's breast as the most important accompanying element, just where, on the figure of the ram, the owl, the bird of the evening and night, appears (Fig. 25). The small bird on the stag's back 21 Cf. the illustration in my Bronzegerdt ..., P. XCI, Fig. 251. 22 Cf. my Das Haus als Weltort der Seele, pp. 84 ff.; and Bronzegerdt .... pp. 119 ff., pp. 210 ff. 196</page><page sequence="19">(Fig. 40) is turned backward. In view of the large bird on the front, that is most probably the result of evolution. Finally, it should be mentioned that the serpent can be seen along with the ram on the handle of a ritual vessel of the Shang period. Here the reptile creeps toward the ram instead of lying on its head (Fig. 41). If we reflect upon this image and think through the juxtaposition involved, there is no divergence from other por- trayals. The serpent creeps up the handle not only in the direction of the ram's head, but also in the direction of the vessel out of which it wants to drink. We see exactly the same thing on a Neolithic vessel of the Pan-Shan group; next to the anthropo- morphic god, the serpent creeps toward the rim of the vessel (Fig. 42). The motif of the serpent that drinks from the vessel and in so doing moves up the handle toward its rim appears also in geo- metric style on a Greek ceramic (Fig. 43) from the necropolis of Rhodes. Later the same motif is preserved on a hydria (Fig. 44). There the serpent again winds its way up the handle to drink. while another reptile glides horizontally around the neck of the vessel and a third lies along the rim. Above this serpent, around the neck of the vessel, extends the picture of a ritual dance in which women take each other's hands, each hand holding a green bough. In every space between these female figures, the water symbol is painted in. Only through comparison with the archaic Greek vessel can we begin to discern what the goddess from Susa (Fig. 33) is holding up in her hands. Unfortunately, the reproduction from Delegation en Perse is somewhat blurred. What the goddess is holding up are the green shoots as on the Greek vessel and corresponding to the Sumerian characters mentioned above. Still later the drinking serpent appears on a brown-figured Attic pitcher (Fig. 45) of circa 650 B.C. Friedrich Matz speaks here of an orientalizing style. The three-dimensionally sculptured god- desses lift up their arms to the rim of the vessel. Their posture repeats exactly what I have already been able to demonstrate in the case of Susa (Fig. 33), where the serpents also drink from the vessel. The green shoots of the dancers from Figure 44 are replaced in Figure 45 by a full-blown flower. It is significant that the paint- ing on the belly of the vessel represents a burial scene. On a Chinese sacred vessel from the excavations at Anyang (Fig. 46), the serpents wind around the rim of the bronze tripod. For that is the very place reserved for the serpents which, after all, 197</page><page sequence="20">Gods and Drinking Serpents want to drink from the vessel. The horizontally creeping serpent next to the one crawling upward to the rim of the vessel has already been noted in the case of the archaic Greek vase (Fig. 44). Furthermore, on the Chinese sacred vessel the serpents are located above the bottle horns with the painted water symbol (Fig. 46). The bottle horns, as we already know, belong to the theriomorphic god or goddess who carries the drinking serpent between his horns or on his back (Figs. 31, 32). So also in the case of the bronze tripod (Fig. 46), those iconographic details familiar from other vessels are again combined in the wealth of their symbolic content. The drinking serpent on the back and crown of the head has been observed among both anthropomorphic and theriomorphic gods both in Susa and in China. In Susa (Figs. 33, 34), this god can be identified clearly as female, as a mother-goddess. But on the Kudurru (Fig. 21), the drinking serpent is the symbol of the moon- god Sin. The androgynous characteristics of the moon-gods should be so familiar that I may simply refer to them here. There is still another way, completely different from the one taken thus far, of comprehending on a broader basis the ancient Chinese combinations of ideas in regard to the ram and its crescent or spiral horns, the painted lozenges, etc. For there remains paleo- graphy, the knowledge of the ancient, even the most ancient Chinese characters. What can it contribute to the subject at hand ? Quantitatively rather little, but it can still enrich our knowledge with some valuable, even crucial insights. In paleography, the character yang (sheep) is the frontally viewed ram's head with the natural spiral convolutions of the horns (Fig. 47).23 However, the first of our pictographical characters shows a curved horn which is bent in a perfectly flat -shape and ends in a point. The two loops of the ram's horn are more or less hung on this horn. It can be seen that, first of all, the concept "horn" as such is emphasized pictographically and then, in addition, the peculiarity of this horn, the spiral convolution. This way of writing the character, with the loop hung on a horn of another shape, makes it possible to decipher another ancient character which until now was understood either incorrectly or not at all. Figure 48 is a human figure seen from the front. It has horns which, just as in the character for yang (sheep) described above, are curved upward, ending in a point. Thus this is a primary form, and it is certain from the beginning that only a true horn is to be 23 Sun Hai-po, Chia ku wen pien, IV, 14 ff. Takada Chushu, op. cit., Ku chou p'ien, LXXXIX, 16. 198</page><page sequence="21">portrayed. On the tip of the horn is hung this time not the spiral of the ram's horn, but a circle with a spiral motif. However, this spiral motif is the same one regularly encountered above the bottle horns (Figs. 31, 32), those bottle horns on which the character for water is also found. And between these bottle horns lies the serpent or the caterpillar. Precisely this combination of horn and spiral motif is the same as that seen from above on the Pan-Shan ceramic (Fig. 14) or the dish from the period of the Contending States (Fig. 12) and then again on the Pan-Shan ceramic with the lozenges (Fig. 11). And now pre- cisely these lozenges are found in the written character (Fig. 48)! In view of this, one may well say, complete conformity, two aspects of the large human figure, standing with legs spread apart, become evident. First, it corresponds in its posture to the character for t'ien (heaven), which originally indicated a high god (Fig. 49); second, it is combined with a boxlike mask which has been drawn over it (Fig. 48). This mask is divided into lozenges, and on the side appear the horns with the spiral motif hung on as described above. Beyond this, we do not want to forget or overlook the fact that the volutes of the ram's horns probably belong to the same sym- bolic category as the double volutes or double spirals on the painted ceramics (Fig. 14). We call to mind in addition the lozenges on the Neolithic ceramic head (Figs. 1-4) and the lozenges on the Iranian ram (Figs. 17-20) which combines the horn and the lozenge system. The written character (Fig. 48) also represents a calendar god or the high god t'ien with the calendar mask, that is, in a special function. For with him originated the secret of time, which is the possibility of calculation, of abstraction. A previous explanation (to be sure, one adorned with a question mark24) was worded as follows: a man with oddly arranged hair. The interpretation is as far-fetched as it is foolish, even if only because it overlooks the troublesome question of why the "man with the oddly arranged hair" has a box divided into squares in place of a head. In spite of the question mark and the uncertainty thus expressed, this attempt at interpretation may be judged typical of a particular basic approach. This "very odd hair arrangement" is something which could perhaps occur, and with this rational supposition can be avoided any questions concern- 24 Takada Chushu, op. cit., XL, 24. Nakashima, Shit ch'i yuan yian [sic], II, Part 3, 201 verso, refutes Takada's interpretation. For him, the symbol is either a masked figure or a creature of fable, in which he is surely correct. Cf. also my Gottergestalten in der altesten chinesischen Schrift (Antwerp, 1943), pp. 38 ff. 199</page><page sequence="22">Gods and Drinking Serpents ing religious symbolism. Such interpretations are obviously conditioned by the need to assert something or other if only in- vestigation of religious questions can be avoided by means of the assertion. Yet it is precisely such questions which are of greatest concern for these ancient high cultures. In considering the matters here presented, I have everywhere avoided discussing those artistic details whose wealth of meaning we cannot or cannot yet fathom. It is inappropriate to pose riddles, as I shall demonstrate later at greater length. I only mention as examples of unexplained details the parallel angles on the ram's back (Figs. 17-20) or the checkerboard pattern on the bowl from Susa (Fig. 28). The idea expressed by some authors in the last case that the checkerboard pattern in painted ceramics can have been derived from basketwork is to be refuted completely as the result of faulty consideration of the evidence. There is no reason for inserting at some arbitrary spot on a ceramic bowl-an object sub- ject to limitation by color and painted with all kinds of symbols (vide Moortgat)-an image more or less foreign to the material, such as a window, an image which at once is assumed to imitate basketwork. These are very poorly considered solutions. In the case of the checkerboard pattern, we may perhaps assume a tem- poral and numerical symbolism appropriate to the other images. The alternating black (dark) and white (light) squares would then provide the foundation, just as chess, even in the Near East, in Mesopotamia, may in the earliest times have been the game of a priestly caste, again with the original intention of calculation, of abstraction. In this connection one can expect the pronouncement of an oracle, and I refer again to the view of the distinguished expert on ancient Sumerian culture, Anton Moortgat, who speaks of the "magic symbolic value" of colored ceramic decoration. This phrase of Moortgat's ought to be taken all the more seriously since we have succeeded here in sifting out the meaningful content of the images discussed to an extent that makes it irresponsible to regard inexplicable images as the vestiges of a purely ornamental sense of style. To recapitulate and supplement our results, let us examine a few more images, the meaning of which is only com- prehensible in light of those clear and easily surveyed results which have emerged in the course of these investigations. The head shown in Figures 50 and 51 comes from the same excavation as Figures 7-9.25 The object represented is another 25 Pueblo Bonito. Cf. George H. Pepper, "Hunan Effigy Vases from Chaco Canon," Boas Anniversary Volume (New York, 1906). 200</page><page sequence="23">"plate-face" over the cheeks of which tears are running. They are reproduced by means of dots like the water on the Chinese Pan- Shan ceramics (Fig. 14). And as on this ceramic, an upward and downward spiral appears on the plate-face (Figs. 50-51). It is found on the chin and is the same spiral that you see near the drops or dots on the Pan-Shan ceramic (Fig. 14). The Pueblo Bonito figure (Figs. 50-51) was preserved in frag- ments. One of the fragments can be attributed to the female sex. But the other Pueblo Bonito figure is a hunchbacked old mall (Figs. 7-9). Why and how these two figures, the old hunchback and the woman, belong together can be discerned from the Mayan por- trayals and the Central American codices. Figure 52 (Campeche, Mexico) is regarded as an example of Jaina style.26 Ferdinand Anders believes that the relatively prevalent motif of the old man and the young woman is not to be interpreted simply as a profane love scene, but that it has a mythical background. The old man has a stag's headdress. In the young woman's headdress appears a serpent. Probably the young woman is intended to be the goddess Ixchel. Ixchel is multivalent and has connections with the moon. The stag belongs to the sun, to the morning star, occasionally to the moon. Actually it belongs to these three heavenly bodies because it is the animal associated with the dawn.27 Thus, we have again before us in Figure 52 the serpent on the animal's head. Moreover, an explanation is presented for the two pueblo figures (Figs. 7-9 and 50-51): the love relationship of the old god and the young goddess with the basic idea of divine renewal, the renewal of the heavenly bodies to which the gods belong; furthermore, the renewal of life, the eternal return which has meaning for the entire cosmos and, for this very reason, man as well. The purpose is not at all concentrated only in fertility symbolism, but in a view of the cosmos as an originating and perishing whole. Thus not only is a single accompanying symbol 26 Ferdinand Anders, Das Pantheon der Maya (Prague, 1963), p. iii, Fig. 50a. 27 The stag is a symbolic animal. First the stag loses its antlers. The pedicles (projections of the frontal bone) bleed and seem painful. New antlers, in the form of knobs, begin to grow from the pedicles, arising through the effect of hormones. The animal's body must use up its reserves to force a bony secretion into the so- called velvety knobs, which are covered with fine hair and well supplied with blood. As long as blood still flows through these knobs, the antlers are highly sensitive. When the tissue begins to dry out, itching sets in. But the itching indicates that the tissue is still living and thus supplied with some blood. When the newly formed antlers are rubbed against a tree trunk, they become spotted with blood, while the so-called velvet hangs down in shreds. The blood-stained antlers and the drooping shreds of bloody velvet are the red symbols of dawn and renewal. Cf. further related material in my Bronzeger&amp; ..., pp. 210 if. 201</page><page sequence="24">Gods and Drinking Serpents repeated with these new examples, but many of those with which we have already become acquainted. In summarizing our results and adding to them what can be understood only now, the following observations are to be made. There are several versions of the so-called Artemis of Ephesus. The crownlike headdress of the most famous one, from the Museum of Naples (Fig. 54) consists in masonry. The almost twice life-size Artemis of Albi also still wears the old headpiece (Fig. 53). This very high headpiece must not be described as a crown. Whoever looks at it attentively must recognize that what was assumed to be a crown actually has the form of a goblet or cup. And this goblet is obviously at the same time a house with various openings toward the four terrestrial regions. Yet it would be unreasonable to imagine here something like a tower. Such an interpretation is refuted by the too-narrow base with the powerfully rising super- structures. As a vessel, the high headpiece is derived from the vessel on the head of the Sumerian goddess (Fig. 33). As a house, and as a vessel, it represents the whole world: the world as archi- tecture and the goblet as the container of the world's water (Fig. 53-54). And the world is open on all four sides. From the appropriate gates figures emerge. As a vessel and as a structure, this headpiece of Artemis corresponds to all those other crowning symbols which in the course of this article have been observed on both anthro- pomorphic and theriomorphic figures. We see in the case of the Neapolitan figure a structure with four openings. However, this structure has the curved rim of a goblet (Fig. 53). To this confirmation of the facts stated above with respect to other portrayals, there can be added another with regard to the Artemis figure. From the belt downward, the body is divided into sections. This is true both of the figure from Albi reproduced here and of the one in the Neapolitan Museum. In each of these sections are animals. Surely, then, there have been thoughts of a creation, insofar as the animals belong to the goddess at all. On the other hand, the framed animals are also signs of the zodiac.28 Star and calendar symbolism then! This is a direct reminder of the lozenges and squares which concerned us at the beginning of this article and in which the symbolism of the lunar calendar could be ascertained: it consists of framed dots. 28 Cf. W. Helbig, Fuhrer durch die offentlichen Sammlungen klassischer Alter- timer in Rom, 4th Printing, No. 522. The reference is to the Artemis replica in the Vatican. 202</page><page sequence="25">The goddess' undergarment (Fig. 53), which encircles the throat with a high neckline, is decorated above with the repeated image of Nike bearing the thyrsus (the staff of Dionysus). On the smooth bodice beneath the pearl garlands various zodiacal signs are intro- duced.29 Miltner is of the opinion that the multiple breasts of the goddess are an abnormality inappropriate to the spirit of Grecian sculpture. He considers it much more likely that rows of eggs were added to the garment as another fertility symbol. I find no parallel to this interpretation and do not regard it as sound. Eggs in this location are a still greater abnormality, as they do not come from the breastJ The whole spirit of these Artemis figures is not at all Greek; it is Oriental. As a counterargument, I include a bronze statuette from the earlier Luristan finds (Fig. 55). Again the god- dess with the serpents can be seen. The heads of two serpents look from under her arms with strangely human faces. On her head the goddess carries the dish which became a large headpiece for the figures of Artemis (Fig. 53). The breasts of the Luristan figure are especially emphasized. Perhaps the many breasts (Fig. 53) are better explained by the fact that Artemis can also appear in animal form. In connection with our findings, I mention in addi- tion the well-known figures of the Erechtheion (Fig. 56). Their heads do not support capitals but rather vessels. Erechtheus was a serpent. The Erechtheion was a shrine of spring water and also the oldest shrine of Athens.30 The Kore of Erechtheion carries the vessel on her head and at the same time the house, the temple of the cult. To complete the present discussion of certain complexes of mythical-religious conceptions, we have introduced a vessel from the earliest school of Grecian vase-painting (Fig. 57). The base is a house with window-openings. One possible interpretation of it as a perforated pediment would be invalid simply because on a similar ceramic, owned by the University of California, this base is painted as masonry. Everywhere on the underside of the vase (Fig. 57), the water symbol is painted. It appears as we find it in China (Fig. 32) on the horns of the god, which are at once vessels and houses. Similar horns have also been referred to in the litera- ture as "mushroom-shaped horns" because the upper part is often 29 Franz Miltner, Ephesos (Vienna, 1958). 30 I have only touched upon the entire problem of the Erechtheion as a shrine of serpents and spring water in order to point out the interrelationships. A more thorough study of these problems in this article could make more difficult the survey of the entire subject, which is our chief concern here. In an essay entitled "Die Gottheit mit dem Haus auf dem Kopf" in Antaios (1965), I will write in greater detail concerning the figures of the Erechtheion. 203</page><page sequence="26">Gods and Drinking Serpents spread out like a mushroom cap. In this way, the similarity to the archaic geometric style of the Grecian vase (Fig. 57) is increased. For this vase obviously represents simultaneously a house and a dish. Thus, spring water and earthly dwelling are united in one symbol. Only what can be correctly observed, seen, and ascertained can also be perceived later by another once his attention is brought to it. One can also maintain that such evidence holds up because it actually meets the scientific demands which are made whenever comparisons are made and natural groupings perceived. I mean here a clear language spoken by the objects themselves which is a purposeful statement on a religious-philosophical plane. It is the sole determining factor in the combination of ornamental elements. This combination can thus be neither accidental nor a question purely of style, and any one-sided advance in this direction under- taken by an author remains at the halfway point. One may then refer to a failure of method because this approach can barely penetrate to the periphery of the problems. Representations have their own powers of expression both as stylistic phenomena and as the product of religious-philosophical thought. In this article, as in some earlier ones, I have been forced to upset concepts which have been cherished due to their familiarity. These are: that the earliest Chinese culture can be understood only in terms of China31 and that it is a product solely of Chinese thought and of the Chinese spirit. By cherished theses I mean those upon which for decades so much acumen was concentrated that scholars forgot that even the constant repetition of unproven and poorly constructed hypotheses does not make them more correct. If we completely ignore for a moment the philosophical-religious impetus, then consideration of style leads to the conclusion that in pre- and protohistorical times, China continued to be bound to the west by numerous ties. To be sure, it must not be denied in regard to later developments, at least where the Shang period is concerned, that ties with the West are broken in favor of a sense of style which turns almost completely to the Pacific. The vast extent of the Chinese Pacific coast is the reason for this orientation. Here Asia ends. Even Maspero spoke years ago (if I remember correctly, in his book La Chine antique) of a "fenetre ouverte sur 31 Cf. my Tod, Auferstehung, Weltordnung; my Das Haus als Weltort der Seele; and my "Die Wanderung der Tiere um die heiligen Berge," in Symbolon, IV (Basel, 1964). 204</page><page sequence="27">le Pacifique." Very much could be said on this subject because these undeniably rewarding investigations have up to now barely passed the initial stages. Yet these are questions which I can merely indicate, as it would be inappropriate to treat them here. I mention them because a consideration of style limited to Chinese territory remains sterile. However, if we avoid a one-sided statement on styles and again consider what ought to be stated, then a strong influence of Wes- tern thought can be perceived even in the Shang period, and much later as well. Obviously the highest position in human society in the Shang period, as in the Mesopotamian Orient, was that of the priest. He held this position because he was the master of know- ledge and culture, and the expert on the calculation of time, in which the greatest knowledge of the gods themselves resided. By priests I mean the ruler-priests. On this very elevated plane, mythical knowledge could also be exchanged and disseminated. For the reader must have noticed by now that the mythical sub- jects discussed here involve knowledge-that is, experienced per- ceptions-and not clumsy attempts to explain nature. From experiences concentrated in a few images heavy with content, a remarkably vast and rich art arises! For this reason, the article at hand would remain incomplete if I did not add a few words about the nature and structure of the myths themselves, from which their sculptured or painted re- presentations arise. There appeared recently a noteworthy book by Mircea Eliade on mythical structures.32 If we follow his chapter headings, the mythical elements discussed here can be divided into different groups, such as "Myths and Rites of Renewal" and "Time Can Be Overcome." The latter title involves precisely what I have several times referred to as that which can be abstracted and calculated. Moreover, because with the knowledge of time, previous time and the origins are addressed, the cosmogonic factor which Eliade dis- cusses under the chapter heading "Magic and Prestige of 'Origins'" is also significant for our discussion. In one chapter, "Survivals and Camouflages of Myths," Eliade points out both the on-going development of primeval mythical traditions up to modern times and, at the same time, present-day recastings of bizarre mythical materials which are completely unrelated to the archaic world-view of the early myths ("mentalite 32 Mircea Eliade, Aspects du mythe (Paris: Gallimard, 1963; English trans., New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1963). 205</page><page sequence="28">Gods and Drinking Serpents archaique"). Let us by-pass the political myth of universal salvation. Eliade discusses it; it need not concern us here. We are much more interested in the false myth in its modern development as opposed to the myths of experience with religious- philosophical content which arose in earlier epochs of the human race ("mythe camoufle"). For man, according to Eliade, remains a being who forms myths. One of the subtitles in Eliade's book, "Myths and mass media," refers to a variation which originates with a sometimes minute elite but can easily be extended. And here, on page 187, he comes to speak of modern art, which can be veiled in myth by an extremely small elite. No one dares challenge this myth because everyone is counting on permission to join the elite. Thus in the end what has been truly experienced can no longer be distinguished from what is merely disguised. Eliade introduces only factual material. He makes no value judgments, and I shall not venture to do it in his place. I do not want to review his exposition, but only to call attention to it and recom- mend that it be read. In preserving the distance provided by unemotional reflection, he brings an original standpoint to the present-day consideration of art. Eliade's exposition is of some concern here because this article makes it evident through the use of clear examples, compre- hensible to everyone who is willing to follow the details, how archaic myths of experience in their condensed form contain artistic value and thus in their representation bring forth art, even art of the greatest kind. At least the mention of modern art in this essay is perhaps justified insofar as the best contemporary move- ments in art and style coincide with what was attained in astonish- ing perfection in, for instance, the ram's figure (Figs. 17-20). However, when a disguised myth ("mythe camoufle") does not provide as a fundamental source the initial impetus for creating a work of art, but afterward covers it as with a cloak, a reversal has occurred. Then we are faced with a mythical novum because here art has been inverted into an obligatory manner of regarding art. I emphasize only one deliberately chosen example so that I refrain from any aesthetic statement on the development of art. Such a statement has no place in this investigation. For the tendency described by Eliade in his book has long since been carried over into the consideration of Asian and especially of Far Eastern art and culture. This tendency may attempt to satisfy a longing for the enigmatic and mysterious which are so readily associated with ancient Asian, particularly Far Eastern culture, 206</page><page sequence="29">and with Far Eastern man, and which are understood in part as the most profound wisdom, in part as impenetrability. On a lower level, this longing is satisfied and nourished by mediocre films and other tools of propaganda of the same level. On a higher level, this seems to occur differently, perhaps precisely through a certain point of view with regard to art. Thus we read, for example, in a book on Buddhist art33 that the entire Buddhist art of the Mahayana should be understood as a single effort to represent the absolute by means of the void. Is this not a case of reversal as is the pseudo-myth in the above-mentioned work by Eliade ? First of all there is an utterance which we assimilate optically: namely, the work of art itself. Then follows in addition a cryptic explanation. This explanation should point the way to the work of art, but it demands only to be believed, a goal which indeed is usually attained when we refuse to admit that it is incomprehen- sible. Thus it is expected to make an impression of depth in the sense of a pseudo-myth. What does it mean for a figure of Buddha to be the representa- tion of the absolute by means of the void ? In every country of the world, art is a longing, a magnificent attempt to transcend human limitation through a creative attitude on the part of the individual. The individual's own reduced cosmos is constructed so as to represent the entire cosmos, symbolically, as a step towards the immeasurable. This is also what the archaic myth attains. But each time man must begin anew to take this step. At the very moment when, from the standpoint of philo- sophical theory, art-all art, everywhere in the world-had attained the absolute, it would necessarily cease to exist. For the magnificent experience which is art consists precisely in its leading us up to boundaries. Thus, a figure of Buddha cannot be the ex- pression of the absolute, for then it would not exist at all. And neither is it the expression of the void, for it is tangible, and every piece of sculpture appeals not only to the eye but equally to the sense of touch. In each case, there is an accumulation of errors in reasoning which appear before us in a garb embellished with myth. The example which I cite occurs by no means as an isolated one in the literature of art history. The existence of illusionary knowledge cannot be recognized; it is misleading. Formal explanations claim- ing universal validity are a limitation of the horizon. One could speak here of a myth without experience, that is, with no back- ground. 33 Dietrich Seckel, Buddhistiche Kunst (Stuttgart, 1957). 207</page><page sequence="30">Gods and Drinking Serpents The object of our efforts is that-by combining research in sinology, ethnology, and the history of religions-a genuine, un- corrupted, comprehensible, and direct relationship to Far Eastern culture and to the archaic myth be preserved as a real experience, or restored when it has been lost. The archaic myth contains no errors in reasoning. It is actually the account of an experience, although it appears in a form which seems strange to us today. The mythical account is not concerned with setting up logical relationships in our sense of the term; yet within the frame of reference assumed by the myth, ideas are con- sistently interwoven. Goethe's Faust says: "Am farbigen Abglanz haben wir das Leben." 34 Certainly it is of the innermost essence of art and of myth to contemplate the absolute. In this way the unfathomable can be approached intuitively but never appre- hended for all time. For that would of necessity be tantamount to eliminating all possibilities of expectancy. 34 Faust II, Act I, Scene 1. Bayard Taylor renders the line: "Life is not light, but the refracted color." 208</page><page sequence="31">1 s' !j / / 9\ 0</page><page sequence="32">ttwJ II 3 / 4 \\\\</page><page sequence="33">9 ,;% A C-M ~ . ,! i .!~ ;'~W s IWN- K"I ~ .,~~ I~.~': ~</page><page sequence="34">L L __ II- L</page><page sequence="35">10</page><page sequence="36">11 12 13 14</page><page sequence="37">i I .ii- _:* I : ::: -I 1 I I p:;i r f i: ii::: r 'X'cifsBs?
