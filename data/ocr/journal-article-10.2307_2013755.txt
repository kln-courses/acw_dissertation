Pp. xxii + 483. This work is a revision of the author's " La Reazione idealistica contro la scienza," 1912, made for presentation in English dress. Besides the</page><page sequence="2">526 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY labor of correction and improvement Professor Aliotta has undertaken a certain rearrangement of his material. The constructive portions, for- merly scattered through the book, he has now collected into a concluding chapter which gives the outlines of his spiritualistic realism. The earlier -by far the more extended-parts are devoted to an historico-critical discussion of his immediate theme. The translation runs easily and fluently, in spite of the inordinate length of the paragraphs-the longest, one might conjecture, since the "Kritik der reinen Vernunft." And in so far as can be gathered without the original at hand, the rendering is accurate. Here and there the reader queries whether certain small am- biguities existed in the original text. But in a much greater proportion of instances it is evident from comparison with the sources of the doctrines described that the work of translation has been successfully accomplished. These few ambiguities may also proceed from another cause. Part I., "The Reaction from Intellectualism in the New Theories of Knowledge," ranges from Spencer to Royce and Miinsterberg, considering neo-criticism, empirico-criticism, neo-Hegelianism, Bergson and his school, and prag- matism on the way. Part II., " The New Theories of Mathematics and Physics," covers the non-Euclidean geometry, logic and mathematics, energetics, and the like. The method of presenting these wide-ranging theories is the historico-critical. The doctrines considered are stated by interpretative narration. The critical remarks are appended in separate sections, or suggested in connection with the principal theses. Now and then the reader must be careful to note just where history stops and criticism begins, or even to distinguish the primary doctrine from its iiarrative reproduction. But these blemishes are few and of minor im- portance. In the main, the author puts the reader in his debt by his ex- tended and accurate review of recent thinking in so far as this bears upon his central theme. There are few books which can be so heartily recommended as summaries of recent epistemology, alike in its philo- sophical and in its scientific forms. The trained student will here find reminders of much of his own reading, and in addition suggestive reports of work that perhaps has escaped his direct study. The title of Professor Aliotta's treatise, however, hardly describes its content. It would be more precise to term it The Reaction against Intel- lectualism, and its Culmination in Recent Scientific Methodology. Intel- lectualism the author takes in the widest sense of the word as "those epistemological systems which assign an autonomous value to the cognitive function "; and he counts as " forms of reaction all those which . . . make the value of science and knowledge in general depend upon . . . otber functions of the mind and rank will and imagination above intellect" (p. xxii). Hence he is led to discuss both the conflict between intel- lectualism and voluntarism or emotionalism and the conflict between rationalism and empiricism, intuitionism, etc. So the currents of his thinking cross and re-cross. But there can be no doubt of the point at which his most successful work is achieved. Far better than the majority of recent writers Professor Aliotta recognizes and emphasizes the accurate analysis of the elements of cognition and of their reciprocal relation. He</page><page sequence="3">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 527 will have naught of pan-logism or of abstract dialectic, although it might be said that his inclinations are rather toward the rationalistic than the empirical tradition. He will have naught of empirico-criticism or of pure empiricism or intuitionism, when these are taken in their absolute forms. Thought and intuition, perception and conception he finds alike integral to the cognitive process, so that one-sided systems which empha- size either phase to the neglect of its fellow inevitably lead to reactions of the most extreme type. This is the teaching of history since the time of Socrates, Plato, and the Sophists. And critical analysis shows the his- torical rhythm grounded in the nature of the case. Armed with such principles, Professor Aliotta is in a position of ad- vantage when he examines recent epistemological theories. Empirico- or agnostic evolutionism, neo-Idealism, pragmatism, intuitionism betray their several elements of weakness if they are tried by these critical tests. In particular, he is able to expose the fallacies of the ultra-phenomenalistic views of science. Here too a reaction against intellectualism has gone on. From dogmatic naturalism later methodologists have turned toward the economic and symbolic interpretation of scientific laws, toward science as concrete sensorial prevision, toward "science without hypotheses," toward phenomenalistic energetics, and the like. But this is clearly reaction. And in all these theories, when they are taken literally, it is easy to show the fault. Science never is divorced from thought, for it never can be; perception, even of the simplest kind, includes intellectual factors. The phenomenalistic methodology but repeats the errors of classical empiricism: the elements of intellection necessary to scientific knowledge are tacitly assumed; or the results of intellection are mistaken for pure percepts and substituted in their room; or, if the genesis of thought is considered, its forms are elicited from the data because they have first been introduced among them, etc. In the main the argument here is just and salutary. And it is certainly pertinent to the discussions of the day. The final chapter broadens noetics into metaphysics. As all knowing involves intellection, so it presupposes rational relations to a rational environment. But knowledge is a function of personal subjects alone. Nature, then, is rational and real; but mind is its end and goal. So realism of the spiritual, or as it was formerly termed, of the ideal type is the metaphysical view to which epistemology leads. Further, epistemology implies an Absolute Consciousness to which mind and nature and the relation of the two are present, for " faith in the value of science is faith in God" (pp. 460-5). This consciousness is an Absolute Self-Conscious Personality, eternally active and creative, who may be validly conceived after the analogy of man's nature, since anthropomorphism of a reason- able kind is present in all our thought. These conclusions, as we have said, are stated in the final chapter of the treatise. Much about them is attractive. But they are sketched rather than elaborated in the present work. The burden and the success of this is in epistemology proper.
