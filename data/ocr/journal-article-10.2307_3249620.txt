<plain_text><page sequence="1">Prithvi Kumar Agrawala: Srivatsa, The Babe of God- dess SrT, Prithivi Prakashan, Varanasi, Indian Civili- Zation Series No. XVI, I974, 74PP- "cSrivatsa" is often translated "beloved of fortune." As is evident in his book's title, P.K. Agrawala prefers the translation of Yrivatsa as "babe of Sri," Sdr being the goddess of beauty and fortune. The term lends itself to multiple translations. The forms of the symbol of srivatsa in art are also multiple. In late examples srhvatsa appears and is described as a whorl of hair, a triangle, or a cruciform flower. But in its early form it has four upwardly curved "limbs" symmetrically paired. This form has been described as shield-shaped. The actual form of the early laksana, Agrawala asserts, is that of a crudely rendered baby. It is an abstraction of a human figure, with upreaching arms and spread legs re- duced to nubs, and the head likewise a nub at center top. An Indus Valley terracotta mother holding something at her chest and representations from Lauriya Nandangarh (pls. 1-3) of mothers holding babies abstractly formed are offered as a suggestion of the probable origin of the emblem irivatsa. Agrawala's thesis that the mark of Sri derives from the form of her offspring suggests a startlingly literal source, though one that is not implausible. A. L. Srivastava, writing at about the same time as Agrawala, also is of the opinion that irivatsa is derived from a human figure ("The Srivatsa Sym- bol in Indian Art," East and West 29, 1979, p. 5I). To support his own suggestion Agrawala points to the similarity of a certain type of archaic bronze anthropomorph which has nub "arms" and "legs" 330</page><page sequence="2">similar to a Yrivatsa-shaped ornament worn by the female of a mithuna couple on a terracotta plaque from Ahichchatra (text fig. I8). It seems to be sig- nificant that this Ahichchatra Yrtvatsa ornament, which hangs at the center of a long necklace, rests just over her womb. This object, Agrawala states, was a fertility amulet. The author suggests that the anthropomorphs of c. 15 oo B.C. found in the Gan- getic valley and elsewhere may be related to the srtvatsa symbol and that they were sold along with other metalware as a token of the mother goddess. Srivatsa appears throughout the history of Indian art in diverse materials and in the art of theyaksa cult, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Jainism. It is fash- ioned on coins, clay seals, stupa parts, ayagapattas, and as individual bronzes (fig. 68). Srivatsa is also one of the astamargala, the eight auspicious sym- bols. It appears on the chests of Jain, Buddhist, Vaisnava and Saiva gods, and even on the chest of Garuda (Visnu's vehicle), but interestingly, not on goddesses except as a part of an ornament. Sri, fortune or well-being, is worn as the mark of the great deities. Recently ayaksa image has been re- ported which holds rirvatsa in his hand, which is most unusual (C. Lin-Bodien, "An Early Yaksa from Aktha near Sarnath...," Chhavi II, Banaras, 1981, pp. 294-297). Agrawala's essay is narrowly focused on the ques- tion of origin. It also surveys examples of the emblem. The implications of the context of rep- resentation of irivatsa are not explored in depth. He mentions, for example, that the Buddhists demoted the symbol from the status it obviously had when it was placed on top of the Sanchi stupa torana, without discussing the point. The author likewise sidesteps the issue of the con- text of the semi-iconic Yrtvatsa in a relief from Peddamudiyam. In this stone relief plaque Srivat- savasini Laksmi, with a faceless, crowned human head, sits on an altar with nubby curled-up arms and legs. She sits in a row of deities including Ganeia, Brahms, Narasirhha, the lirga form of Siva, Visnu and his consort, Umimaheivara, and Mahi- sisuramardini. Agrawala illustrates only the detail of irivatsa (fig. 70). What is her role in this group? Another example of irtvatsa in an interesting con- text is cited in a footnote- the Bhita clay seal of the 4th-3th century (A.S.I. Annual Report, *9**-*2, XIX, p. 44) which includes irivatsa on the right, a larger bull (Siva's Nandi) frontally represented in the center, and Visnu's cakra standing on edge on the left. These emblems of Hindu deities are rep- resented as a trinity, with each on an altar or pedes- tal. This was the seal of the officer of the police, as the inscription records. Many other clay seals rep- resent srivatsa alone, but in this grouping irivatsa is apparently given importance equal to or greater than Visnu and Siva, perhaps symbolizing Saktism. Yet in another srtvatsa seal from Basarh, which T. Bloch didn't know what to call (so he called it an "ornamental tribila") Jrivatsa is again a part of a trinity but stands between a conch and a wheel, emblems of Visnu. Curiously, at the time srivatsa appears on such seals the symbol rarely appears on the chests of gods, as noted by C. Sivaramamurti ("Geographical and Chronological Factors in In- dian Iconography," Ancient India 6, 1950o, pp. 44-46). Agrawala has also left unexplained the frequent association in Indian art of Yrtvatsa with the lotus. In some images rirvatsa has lotus parts, while in others it has snake or fish parts. S.P. Gupta has suggested that perhaps the rirvatsa got its form from the combination of the winding rhizome of the padma (lotus) with the nigapuspa (snake flower design), the origin of which he believes to be the realistic depiction of the swollen central stalk from which the lotus rhizome and flowers burst forth (The Roots of Indian Art, Delhi, 1980, p. 325). It seems evident that the rtrvatsa represents a family of meanings. It symbolizes human and vegetal fe- cundity, uniting the two through the broader idea of "Fortune" - fertility, prosperity, abundance - using forms analogous to either animals or plants. The same conception is expressed in the Maurya period on stone discs on which the nigapuspa is alternated with a female figure (P. Chandra, "The Cult of Sri- Laksmi and Four Carved Discs..." Chhavi, Banaras, 1971, pp. I39-148). This female figure standing in a rigid frontal pose is identified as Sri Laksmi, the sign, or goddess, of Fortune. The alteration of her figure with the nagapuspa may be understood as a repetition of interchangeable symbols - one plant, one animal. Agrawala cites literary references to irivatsa, espe- cially descriptions of its form, which are sparse. The frequent proximity of Sri Laksmi and irivatsa images is noted and Agrawala cites the relevant passage from the Srt-prasna Samhita (42.83) pre- scribing worship of irsvatsa (P. 47) wherein the 331I</page><page sequence="3">goddess Laksmi is stated to be hidden or indwel- ling in irivatsa (2.17), and another in which Visnu himself explains to the goddess Laksmi that she had made her place in his rirvatsa after her origin from the churned ocean (25.3 5). Srivatsa may be the ancient aniconic representation of the goddess of Fortune in the same way that Siva is represented in either an abstract or an anthropo- morphic form. Occasionally rivratsa is semi-iconic, personified with a head as in examples from Kave- ripakkam and Enadi, just as the lihia of Siva some- times has a human head. The origin of srivatsa may not be traceable to a single original source, but may be an amalgam of many. A full study of the iconography of srivatsa would question its multiple derivations and associ- ations implied by the changes in its composition, form, and context. The present essay will serve as a valuable beginning to such a study and is a useful reference for its illustrations - I 35 plates and 66 line drawings.
