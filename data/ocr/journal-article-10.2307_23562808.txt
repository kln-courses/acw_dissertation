Anderson has written a thoughtful and provocative book that he intends as a constructive theology. Nonetheless, it may be more accurately described as a prolegomenon to such a theology, given his own acknowledgment of the frag mentary character of his explorations. Indeed, the book reads more like a se ries of essays on diverse, albeit interrelated, topics of both a methodological</page><page sequence="2">214 • Book Reviews and substantive nature that have to be addressed as one works toward a full scale constructive theology of African American religious experience. What makes Anderson's book both interesting and unusual is the distinc tive way he weaves together various threads from different sources and as pects of his own lived experience. He identifies himself as a liberal theolo gian who draws upon the American philosophical tradition of pragmatism. For him, theology interprets actual lived experience in such a way as to en hance human life in the world. From this standpoint, he critically engages the movements of black theology and womanist theology as represented by James Cone and Delores Williams, offering an alternative to their ways of framing crucial issues. The concept of "experience" and its interpretation are central to this book. If the importance of theology lies in its capacity to lay hold of human experi ence in a profound and insightful manner, then any theology that reduces that experience to the point of distortion deserves to be criticized. Although he first realized the importance of experience for theology while reading the work of Cone, Anderson has subsequently become suspicious with regard to how ex perience is actually used within black theology. This is, indeed, the pivot of his critical relation to black theology. Consequently, this book has as one of its main purposes a correction of what he characterizes as an "ideological" use of the experience of black people for the sake of a fuller, richer, and more complex rendering of it. In his analysis of the ways appeal has been made to the slave narratives, An derson contrasts the ideological approach he criticizes to the "genealogical" ap proach he recommends. The latter is a more truly historical and contextual ap proach to the unresolved ambiguities in African American religious experience. Anderson's thesis is that black theology's reductive approach to African Amer ican experience accounts for its estrangement from the majority of black churches. The category "race," on which black theology is based, must today be complicated by class, gender, and sexual orientation, which have to be taken into sufficient account when giving a full-bodied, nuanced, and nonideologi cal interpretation of African American religious experience. Engaging womanist theology, Anderson wrestles with the notion of redemp tive suffering. Unlike Williams, who rejects the notion altogether, Anderson engages in a qualified retrieval of it. The issue boils down to what the term "re demptive suffering" actually means and whether God is conceived in personal terms (with Williams) or in nonpersonal categories (with Anderson). When God is not understood in anthropomorphic fashion as an agent with intentions, then the so-called theodicy problem is really a problem of ethics, not theology, because it concerns the suffering human beings inflict upon one another. This book is rich in many ways, not least because of the integrity with which personal experience is interlaced with deep learning. Although its promise to</page><page sequence="3">Paul E.
