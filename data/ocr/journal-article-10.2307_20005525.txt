<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rel. Stud. I4, pp. 525-537 REVIEW ARTICLE JONATHAN HARRISON Professor of Philosophy, Nottingham University MALT DOES MORE THAN PETER CAN OR ON BEHALF OF THE DAMNED This interesting book,' most of which was originally delivered in Cambridge as the first part of Professor Geach's Stanton Lectures, is a spirited attempt to reconcile God's ways to man. The problem, of course, is that God must know of evil, because he is omniscient; be able to prevent it, because he is omnipotent; and cannot tolerate it, because he is perfectly good: yet there is evil. I cannot pretend that I think this attempt is not just the latest of a long line of failures, but the manner in which it fails is interesting. The book is divided into seven chapters, 'Omnipotence' and 'An ir relevance of Omnipotence', both previously published in Philosophy, 'Om niscience and the Future', 'Animal Pain', 'Original Sin', 'The Ordainer of the Lottery', and 'Hell'. In the last, on Hell, Geach rises to heights of eloquence which makes it well worth reading, for those who believe that their chances of actually going there are small. Geach thinks he is more likely to go to hell than to Australia, but God is not only just, but merciful, so perhaps he is being unduly pessimistic. In his first chapter, Omnipotence, Geach discusses four possible views of what it might mean to say that God is omnipotent, and can do everything. (i) God can do everything that can be described in words which make sense, even though the description in question is contradictory. This view he rightly rejects. (There can obviously be no guarantee that God does not not exist, if God can bring it about that he both exists and does not exist.) (2) God can do everything, provided that doing the thing in question is not contradictory. Geach rejects this view on the ground that there are some things that God cannot do, for example, make a thing its maker cannot destroy, although doing them is not contradictory, for even men can make things their makers cannot destroy. (3) God can do so-and-so if and only if the statement that God does so-and-so is not contradictory. This view Geach rejects on the grounds that there is no logical inconsistency in the statement that God brings it about that Miss Smith never loses her virginity, but, 1 P. T. Geach, Providence and Evil (Cambridge University Press, 1977), pp. 129+XXii, ?4.50.</page><page sequence="2">526 JONATHAN HARRISON nevertheless, God cannot bring it about that she never loses it if she has already lost it. (4) God can bring about anything so long as (a) the statement that God does it is not contradictory and (b) it belongs to the 'realm of future contingency'. This view Geach rejects on the ground that God cannot break his promises, although the act of breaking them is still in the future, and there is no logical impossibility in God's breaking his promises. (Though there is no logical impossibility in God's breaking his promises, it may be Geach's view that it is a necessary truth that he keeps them, in which case he must think, presumably, that there are some necessary truths which can be denied without contradiction.) Geach, I thought, was able to make his case seem stronger than it was by being somewhat capricious about his choice of descriptions of possible candidates for being things which God could or could not do. I can, and sometimes have, tied a knot which I have subsequently been unable to untie. If God, however, were to bring it about that a knot was tied, he would certainly be able to bring it about that it was untied. But why describe this feat as 'making a thing its maker cannot destroy' (which it is) and not as 'making a thing that God cannot destroy' (which it is not) ? Though it looks as if I, but not God, can make a thing its maker cannot destroy, it also looks as if neither I nor God can make things that God cannot destroy. My tying a knot I could not untie could be described in either way; under one de scription, 'making something its maker cannot destroy' it can be done by me, but not by God; under another description, ' making something God cannot destroy', it cannot be done by either of us. Under the description 'bringing it about that Miss Smith has never lost her virginity', a feat may be possible, but under another description, bringing it about that Miss Smith has never lost her virginity after she has already lost it, the feat may be logically impossible. Again, under the description 'breaking a promise' it may be that God can consistently be described as doing something which, since he is perfect, he cannot consistently be described as doing under the description 'breaking a promise which it is wrong to break', and, I dare say, it would be wrong for God, though not for man, to break any promise he has made. (That promise breaking is always wrong for God is my reason, not Geach's, for thinking that it cannot be God will break his promises. Geach's reasons I have discussed elsewhere.)' Unfortunately for Geach, there are lots of contradictory feats which can be described in a non-contradictory way. For example, squaring the circle, which is contradictory, can be described as squaring something, which is not. A feat is not possible because some of its descriptions are not contradictory; it is possible only if none of its descriptions is contradictory. Hence it seems perverse to say that bringing it about that Miss Smith has never lost her virginity (after she has lost it) is something which God can consistently be 1 'Geach on Harrison on Geach on God', in Philosophy, LII (I977).</page><page sequence="3">MALT DOES MORE THAN PETER CAN 527 described as doing, when bringing it about that Miss Smith has never lost her virginity after she has lost it is not something that God can consistently be described as doing. One might as well argue that the view that God can do something if and only if the statement that he does that thing is not con tradictory is wrong, on the ground that, since the statement that God can square something is not contradictory, the view implies that God can square the circle. The view that God can bring about any logically possible state of affairs is surely the view that God can bring about any state of affairs a full description of which is not contradictory. If there could be things which were green and blue all over, a partial description of such things would be that they were blue all over, and, of course, it is possible even for men to bring into existence something which is blue all over. One would not for this reason wish to count making something green and blue all over as a logically possible feat which God cannot accomplish. Geach's argument, that making something its maker cannot destroy is a logically possible feat which God cannot accomplish involves a mistake of the same kind. Geach thinks that this is a logically possible feat because, of course, men can and do make things their makers cannot destroy. But to argue that because God's making something which God cannot destroy is a special case of a maker making something which its maker cannot destroy, and because it is perfectly possible for someone to make something that its maker cannot destroy, then God's making something which he cannot destroy is a logically possible feat which God cannot accomplish, is a mistake of precisely the same kind as arguing that squaring the circle is a logically possible feat which God cannot accomplish because squaring the circle is squaring something, and even man can do that. God's making something God cannot destroy is a fuller description of something which can also be described as making something its maker cannot destroy, and the fuller description is logically contradictory. It is clear, incidentally, that the fact that God cannot make something which God cannot also destroy does not prevent God from bringing about any logically possible state of affairs. My knot's being tied is something that both I, and God can bring about; my knot's being untied is something that God, but not I, can bring about. God is prevented from realizing neither state of affairs by the fact that he cannot make anything which he cannot also destroy. Incidentally, a marksman who cannot miss things which I can miss is able to hit more targets than I can, not fewer. The statement, if I may parody a once popular song, that 'Anything man can do, God can do better' is, Geach thinks, simply not true. There are lots of things man can do which God cannot do at all. I, for example, can play the piano with my fingers, but not with my toes, but God can do neither, for he has no fingers or toes. This leads Geach to a difficulty peculiar to Christianity. Christ was God, but Christ could walk and God cannot. This</page><page sequence="4">528 JONATHAN HARRISON would appear to be contradictory. Geach attempts to remove the contra diction by arguing that there are things that God can do as Christ, but cannot do as God. Just as Jones may attend a committee meeting as Mayor, but not as Chairman of the Vigilance Committee, so God may be able to walk as Christ, but not as God. I did not find this solution to the problem satisfactory. The 'can do A as X' way of talking seems especially well adapted to a situation in which men have different roles allocated to them by conventional rules. Hence to say that Jones may attend the meeting as Mayor but not as Chairman of the Vigilance Committee means that Jones can attend the meeting in his capacity as Mayor, but not in his capacity as Chairman of the Vigilance Committee. I could see that God, like Pooh-Bah, might intercede on our behalf as Christ, and forgive us our wrong-doings as God. Though interceding and forgiving are not contradictory activities, as being able to walk and not being able to walk are, I suppose a rather muddled city corporation might have a rule to the effect that the Mayor had a duty to attend the Education Committee, and also make it a rule that the Chair man of the Vigilance Committee could not attend the Education Committee meeting, and at the same time make the same man both Mayor and Chair man of the Vigilance Committee. (There is nothing contradictory about having a duty to do something and having a duty not to do it, as there is about having a duty to do something and not having a duty to do it.) But though Jones might as Mayor have a duty to do something which, in some other capacity, he had a duty not to do, it would be absurd to suppose that he could as Mayor be tall, dark and handsome, but, as Chairman of the Vigilance Committee be short, fat and ugly. I am afraid that it seems to me that it is just as impossible for one and the same entity to be able to walk, and not able to walk, or to have any of the other physical and mental attributes which Christ was supposed to have and God not to have, as it is impossible for Jones to be both tall and short. My hunch is that a more profitable way of dealing with the problems of Christology might come from abnormal psychology and psychical research, but I am afraid that Geach himself would be horrified at the idea. Geach's own view of the matter is that although the statement that God is omnipotent is incoherent, the statement that God is almighty is both coherent and true. For myself I could see little to choose between the words 'om nipotent' and 'almighty'. To say that God is omnipotent, Geach thinks, means that God can do everything. To say that God is almighty means that he has power over all things. I have argued elsewhere' that the same problems which arise over 'omnipotent' arise again over 'almighty', so I shall not say anything more about the matter here. My own view of omnipotence would be this. (I) God can bring about any logically possible state of affairs. (This, as Geach points out, does not mean 1 In 'Geach on God's Alleged Ability to do Evil', Philosophy, LI (I976).</page><page sequence="5">MALT DOES MORE THAN PETER CAN 529 that he can bring about every logically possible state of affairs collectively. He can bring it about that any man accepts help without giving it, or gives help without accepting it, but not that all men do this.) God can perform any activity which it is not logically impossible for God (though if God is timeless, there may be no such activities). Hence he can annihilate the universe, for this feat, though difficult, is not logically impossible, but he cannot tie a bow tie, as opposed to bringing it about that one is tied, for this feat, though logically possible for men, is not for God. (2) There are some things which are such that it is logically possible for God to do, if he chooses, but not logically possible for him to choose to do. He could bring about pointless evil, if he chose, but it is logically impossible for a perfect being to choose this, or to want to choose this, either. These things God can do, for the statement that evil would result from God's choosing evil entails that he can bring about evil, whether or not it is logically impossible for him to choose to bring about evil. This involves me in accepting what is sometimes misdescribed as a hypo thetical view of freedom; mis-described, because the view is that to say that we were free, categorically, to do something we did not do is to assert the hypothetical that if our wants or beliefs had been different from what they were, we would have tried to do something different from what we actually did, and that if we had tried to do this thing, we would have succeeded in doing it. This, of course, is quite different from asserting that we would have been free, if our wants or beliefs and choices had been different from what they were. This view of freedom Geach rejects - and with prudence, for, if it is true, it makes the problem of evil much worse than it is if his own view is correct. For on this view of freedom an action is free if it has a certain kind of cause, viz., a want or desire of the agent. This means that the statement, that if the agent's wants or beliefs were different, he would do it, entails that he can do it, but that the statement that he would still go on doing it, whatever his wants or beliefs, entails that he cannot help doing it. Hence I cannot help breathing, for I go on breathing, whatever my wants or beliefs, but I can help stealing, because, if I did not want to steal, or did not believe I could get away with it, I would not. The advantage of this view, to one who thinks that the free choices of human beings are just as explicable as the behaviour of inanimate objects, is that it allows one to regard the free actions of a human being as just one link in a chain which has causes, and will subsequently have effects. (Despite Geach's view about conversion, it really does seem to me quite obvious that if a man, who has never set foot in a church all his life until he is forty, from that time onwards becomes a regular church-goer, this change in him must have some explanation.) It is free because if some of its causes - the wants and beliefs of the man or woman who did it - were different, it would be different, which is quite compatible with saying that there exist still earlier causes which make it impossible for these causal factors</page><page sequence="6">530 JONATHAN HARRISON to be anything other than they are. Hence, among the causes of those causes (my beliefs and desires) of my action, there will be many which no human being could ever have done anything about, and certainly some which no one can do anything about now, for they lie in the past. Geach thinks it self evident that, if an action is determined by a set of causal factors over which the agent has no control, it cannot be a free action, but this is a mistake. The truth is that no physical movement of mine can be one which is freely produced if among its immediate causes there exist no wants and beliefs and choices of mine. Among the causes of the causes of my wants and beliefs there will be a set of factors which do not include the wants or beliefs of any human being, but this does not mean that my action is not free, so long as its immediate causes include my wants and beliefs. Geach, as I have already suggested, is right to want to dismiss this view of freedom, for it makes the problem of evil much more difficult to deal with than it is on his own view. For, among the causes of the wants and beliefs which, because they caused me to steal, mean that my stealing was a free action, there may be physiological factors (not themselves wants or beliefs) such as, to take a more than usually exciting example, a brain tumour. Brain tumours can be removed by doctors, and so, afortiori, could be pre vented by an omnipotent, or even an almighty, God. Hence, in my view, one is not allowed the escape that God cannot control the free actions of human beings, for they may be produced by physiological happenings which even a doctor can control. It is simply a logical error to suppose that, since I am responsible for something's happening, no-one else can be; I am re sponsible, for had I not wanted to make it happen it would not have happened. My doctor may be responsible, for if he had cured my brain tumour, I would not have wanted it to happen, and of course God is respon sible, because he could have prevented my having a brain tumour. Though this view has the disadvantage of making the problem of evil more intractable than it would be otherwise, it has the advantage of perhaps making us a little more charitable to those who sin, for it allows those of us who are fortunate enough to say of others' sinful acts, as well as their misfortunes, 'There, but for the grace of God, go I'. A consequence of this view, which Geach will not like, is that if I am offered grace, and freely reject it, God could have brought about a situation in which I accepted it, by altering the causal antecedents of the desires and beliefs which caused me to refuse. Geach may not like the view of freedom that I have just briefly summarized, but, from his point of view, it can at least be said that it does not lead to any problems about God's omniscience. God can foreknow that I will rob a bank tomorrow, so we do not have to choose between saying that he is not om niscient (or, as Prior once held - and I was disappointed that Geach did not comment on this view - that the proposition that he is omniscient takes neuter truth value) and saying, on the other hand, that there are some</page><page sequence="7">MALT DOES MORE THAN PETER CAN 53I contingent future events, the free actions of human beings, which he does not have power to bring about. The problems it does lead to are problems about God's goodness, and there are enough of these in any case. Geach, however, is in difficulties. He wants to say that God's knowledge of the future is not, as is sometimes supposed, dependent upon his seeing it (a feat which Geach supposes - I suspect wrongly - would involve God in either seeing it as present, and so misperceiving it, or seeing it as future and simultaneously present, which is contradictory). God's knowledge of the future is, Geach thinks, like man's knowledge of his own intentional actions; it is just a question of God's knowing what kind of future he intends to produce, and, of course, whatever future he intends to produce, he will produce. But in this case, of course, if God is to know the future actions of human beings, he must both intend to produce them and produce them. Either he does not produce them, and does not know what actions men will perform, or he does produce them, and does know what actions men will perform, but is himself responsible for them. Geach, I think, accepts this as a consequence of his own view, for he says that we must just accept that sin is incomprehensible - here he seems to be confusing saying that sin is incomprehensible, which it often is not, and saying that it is incomprehensible that God should allow sin, which it is - and also suggests that God allows sin because it is a necessary condition of certain virtues. The reply to this latter is that it is impossible to see, by an impartial investigation of what happens in the world, that every sin produces a virtue, and that a man may possess a virtue, for example, a disposition to forgive people for sins against himself, if anyone commits them, without having to exercise it. This latter view Geach dismisses as absurd, but he does not say why. In general, I found Geach's attitude to the problem of determinism and fatalism baffling. He rejects the possibility of inferring the future; says that the belief that every event has a cause is just a prejudice; thinks that God cannot see the future laid out before him; likens the future to a blank sheet of paper on which nothing has been written; thinks that there are alternative futures, but not alternative pasts; holds that the past and present exist, although the future does not; thinks that there can be no proper names for future individuals, though there can be for present and past ones; and holds that the future can be altered, although the past cannot. All this, one would have supposed, is preparing a solution to the twin problems of determinism and fatalism along the lines that the future is 'open' or 'unfixed' in some way in which the past is not, and that the law of the excluded middle, or, at any rate, the principle of bivalence, applies to propositions about the past but not to propositions about the future. But in this case, Geach ought to be worried about God's omniscience, although in fact he is not. On the other hand, Geach likens God to a Grand Master, who can predict exactly how he will defeat his opponents; indeed, the evil intentions of sinful men are themselves</page><page sequence="8">532 JONATHAN HARRISON essential ingredients in the divine plan, which uses these very intentions to accomplish its end. Geach, however, is over-impressed by the chess-playing abilities of actual Grand Masters. They cannot predict exactly how they will mate their opponents for they do not know just what moves their opponents will make. They must have in mind alternative strategies to meet the alternative moves, however inept, of their opponents. Hence either God has alternative strategies to meet moves which he cannot possibly foresee, or he himself foresees, and so, according to Geach, himself produces, the moves to which he subsequently replies. If I am right in thinking that it is this latter view which is Geach's, it is difficult to see how he is any better off than the predestinarians about whom he complains. What is obnoxious about predestinarianism, however, is not, as is usually said, that those who are sent to Hell are sent there for what is God's fault, rather than theirs. The fact that a man is predestined to want to sin, and then to sin, does not entail that it is not the case that if he did not want to sin he would not; hence it does not entail that he is not free, and so does not entail that he does not deserve his punishment. As I have said elsewhere,' if according to Predestinarianism, God, like an omnipotent and omniscient chancellor, awards not only degrees, but the intelligence and industry which results in some, but not others, getting degrees, he cannot be accused of not awarding degrees according to merit. What he can be accused of is behaving like some omnipotent Judge cum-agent-provocateur, who condemns men to eternal perdition for sins for which he is in part responsible. Geach's solution to the problem of animal pain, which involves him in taking a swipe at vegetarianism, one of fairly large number of betes noires who are the objects of intermittent ridicule or scorn, is this. Sympathy with animals whose nature we share is a virtue in man, but sympathy with animals whose nature we do not share is not. It is anthropomorphic to suppose that any such sympathy is possessed by God. I did not find this solution to the problem endearing. I did wonder whether Geach himself was not being anthropomorphic in putting the dividing line, between animals with whom God does sympathize and those with whom he does not, below and not above the human animal. Incidentally, Geach considers only the humani tarian case for vegetarianism, and ignores the valetudinarian and ecological cases, which latter are very strong. That man is prone to sin, is, of course, a platitude. Geach believes that man is originally sinful. That man is originally sinful, Geach thinks, involves two further propositions over and above the one that he is prone to sin, viz., that man would not have been prone to sin, had it not been for an actual historical occurrence, the fall of man, and secondly, that man's nature is so flawed that he cannot cease to be sinful without supernatural aid (if, one I Foreknowledge, Will and Fate (Inaugural lecture, University of Nottingham), Nottingham, 1976.</page><page sequence="9">MALT DOES MORE THAN PETER CAN 533 might be inclined to add, he can even then). Such a belief, Geach thinks, is essential to Christianity, for had not the fall of man occurred, and resulted in original sin, there would be nothing for Christ to have redeemed man from. I do not wish to comment on the view that there ever have in the history of the universe been men in this enviable unfallen state where, Geach tells us, fatigue and disease and old age do not drag a man down so that his mind's performance of necessary tasks is impaired. But I think I must make a few comments upon Geach's attitude to evolutionary biology, the holdings of which would appear to conflict with Geach's view, and which Geach thinks (I am not sure why) gives a picture of man's history which is unduly opti mistic. Geach thinks it is just obvious, if we do not have an axe to grind, that purpose is to be found in those things which are supposed to have evolved by a process of natural selection, a view which he regards as being incredible. Statements about purpose, however, are ambiguous. A man may have a purpose, in that there are some things which he purposes. The eye may have a purpose, in the sense that it has a function. A screwdriver may have a purpose, in the sense that it was made by man to serve various pur poses that he has. Now in the first and second senses I agree that it is obvious that things allegedly produced by natural selection have purposes, but in these senses it is not obvious that there is any incompatibility between this fact and the theory of evolution. If they had been produced to serve a purpose - if they were, this would be inconsistent with Geach's claim that God never wills one thing as a means to another, though he does will a world in which one thing is a means to another - this, though not actually inconsistent with the claim of evolutionary biology would not be supported by it. In this sense, however, it is surely not obvious that anything studied by evolutionary biolo gists does have a purpose. Perhaps if Geach were to start breeding cats, instead of keeping them as pets, he would not find natural selection such an implausible story. Geach seems to think that the fact that animals' reproductive organs have a purpose is something which it is especially impossible to explain by natural selection. The existence of these organs must be presupposed by natural selection, for unless they existed in the first place, parents could not have offspring and there would be nothing for natural selection to select. Hence these organs cannot be brought about by natural selection. For myself, I could not see why this should be so. Amoebas who are the grandfathers of us all did not exactly have reproductive organs, but they still managed to reproduce themselves. Hence there was something to select, even before there were reproductive organs, and I see no reason why more complicated manners of reproduction involving organs, should not have developed by natural selection from these. In Chapter 6 Geach turns to the question whether facts such as that the rain falls on the just and unjust alike are compatible with the weather's being</page><page sequence="10">534 JONATHAN HARRISON a manifestation of divine providence. He thinks rightly, that there is no reason why some things being a matter of chance should be incompatible with a doctrine of providence - though in the sense in which 'happened by chance' means 'happened without design' nothing happens by chance if there is an omnipotent omniscient God - but he seems to think that a universe in which there is chance is incompatible with a universe in which everything is determined. I found it very difficult to see why he should think this. The fact that it is a matter of chance which riders suffer accidents in a given year only asserts that it is impossible to predict, simply on the information that someone is a rider, whether or not he will have an accident. This in no way excludes its being impossible to predict whether or not a given rider will have an accident, given some more specific information about him. In any case, the chance which Geach thinks is necessary to preserve human freedom is a matter of their actions not being completely determined by antecedent causes, and is no way incompatible with those actions having completely determined effects. He quite rightly points out that even in this world sin has natural penalities. In this world, as Bishop Butler pointed out, we see a tendency for sin to have natural penalties superimposed on an order where ills are distributed in a random manner. Gluttony, for example, is followed by indigestion, but there is no reason to suppose that the gluttonous should be more susceptible to railway accidents than are more temperate people. Hence there are a large number of ills which the just and the unjust are equally likely to suffer from. Geach's attempt to vindicate the divinity would have been stronger if he had a theory about the point of the lottery, but I did not find that he had one. The mere fact that there is no incompatibility between chance and divine planning does not explain why God distributes many goods in a random manner. It is true that Geach thinks that, were it not for chance and contingency, free will would be impossible, but he seems to me to be wrong about this. Geach thinks there must be contingency, for if my bodily movements were determined by factors in which my wishes and thoughts and choices played no part I would exercise no control over the course of nature, and so would not be responsible for anything that happened. This is so, but it does not mean that there is no contingency in the world, merely that there is contingency in the material world, and not even then if, as some extreme materialists wrongly suppose, our thoughts, wishes and choices are material. In any case, that there is no contingency in the world is perfectly compatible with some things being a matter of chance, if to say that there is no contingency is to say that everything is determined by some thing, and to say that there is chance to say that everything is not determined by everything. In discussing what he believes is the Christian doctrine of Hell, Geach comes across a problem, which, if I may put it a little frivolously, is that God has promised a time when the saved shall enjoy eternal bliss without</page><page sequence="11">MALT DOES MORE THAN PETER CAN 535 their peace being disturbed by the thought of the damned also simultaneously suffering eternal torment; nevertheless, only eternal torment is a proper punishment for the wickedness of the latter. (One suspects this view is too severe.) Geach has no less than two different attempts to reconcile these two requirements. These attempts, though perhaps not realistic eschatology, are nevertheless logically interesting. According to the first, the time stream bifurcates at a certain point into two streams, one of which will contain the damned in hell, experiencing, as Geach says, one damned thing after another, and another which contains only the blessed in heaven, experiencing one blessed thing after another. Since Geach believes in the resurrection of the body, both these universes are presumably spatially fairly normal - though the blessed, we are told, possess 'Agility', and can move from one place to another 'as quick as thought' (which in my case is sometimes not very quick). If an inhabitant of the blessed universe (Heaven) were to say that the damned no longer existed, and never again would exist, he would be making a true statement; similarly, if one of the damned were to say the same of the blessed, he too would be making a true statement. Geach's other solution is this. He thinks Empedocles has given a good description of the fate- of a damned person when he says 'For the mighty Air drives him forth into the Sea, and the Sea vomits him forth upon the dry land; Each tosses him into the beams of the blazing Sun, and the Sun flings him back into the eddies of the Air.' If we suppose this dreadful business takes a day, then, Geach thinks, the whole sequence of unending torment could be got over in a couple of days, provided that the next cycle took half a day, the third a quarter of a day, and so on. I say 'got over', for after the end of the second day the blessed are supposed to rejoice in the thought that there will be no more suffering, but it is nevertheless also true that the suffering of the damned has no end, in the sense of 'end' which means 'reaches a last event' for, in this series, there is no last event. I had grave doubts about the logical possibility of either of these ingenious attempts to relegate hell to some logically inaccessible Ghetto. Let us take the second first. This, be it remembered, is no mathematically infinite series, as Zeno's was, when the ground covered by the stride which brings Achilles level with the tortoise can be divided into an infinite number of smaller bits, each to be correlated with the similar division of the time he takes to make it. Even one cycle in the life of hell can be so divided, and this fact need cause the damned no extra disquiet, just as the fact that a cake can be divided into half, and that half into two quarters, and so on does not mean that there is any more food for the hungry. For the damned genuinely to suffer eternal misery, it must last an infinite number of (say) days, and, if sense is to be made of Geach's idea that each day will be half the length of the day before, there must be some other measuring unit which it takes half of; if the damned and the blessed share the same universe, then what must happen is that in</page><page sequence="12">536 JONATHAN HARRISON the first day of the life of the damned the sun which shines on the blessed rises and sets once; by the end of the second day of the life of the damned the sun which shines on the blessed must have reached its zenith; by the end of the third day in the life of the damned the sun of the blessed has reached six o'clock, and so on. In other words, if the damned's sun is progressively accelerating the blessed's sun must be constantly slowing down, and slowing down in such a way that it will never quite reach the point which it would have to reach for their second day to be over; it will (asymptotically) pro gress nearer and nearer to it, without ever reaching it, just as if we insist on dividing a loaf in half, and that half into half, we will progress for ever towards a time when there is no loaf left to be divided, but never quite reach this time. Hence the damned, though they will know that their torment is unending, may at least console themselves with the wicked thought that the bliss of the blessed will never get past its second day. Geach's first solution is little better. According to it, as we have seen, the blessed need not worry about the troubles of the damned because the blessed can truly say that they are not now occurring, never have occurred and never will occur. Since the words 'now', 'never have' and 'never will' refer to times in the blessed's time stream, these remarks are all true, though if the damned were to say the same thing these words would refer to times in their time stream, in which case they would be false, for in this time stream, the suffering has occurred, does occur and will go on for ever. What the blessed can say about the sufferings of the damned is that a while ago there was a time when they were going to occur and were going to go on for ever, but this does not entail that it is still true that they are going to go on for ever. It is not, however, as in the other view of Hell, that the sufferings of the damned are over; from the point of view of the blessed, they have never even begun. From the point of view of the damned, however, it is not only true that they will go on for ever; they must go on for ever because the only way in which they could stop would be for the two time streams to amalgamate, and this is impossible, for after the time of their amalgamation there would be alternative pasts. Though, according to Geach, there can be alternative futures there cannot be alternative pasts. It is a peculiar consequence of Geach's view that the two statements 'The blessed exist, the damned do not exist, and only the blessed will exist for evermore' and 'The damned exist, the blessed no longer exist, and only the damned will exist for evermore' can both be true. The first statement will be true when made by the blessed, the second when made by the damned. I think that Geach accepts this extraordinary view because he thinks that he has already shown that there can be alternative futures, but not alter native pasts. It was not clear to me that he had shown this. Even if he had shown that there can be alternative futures, although in a way in which there cannot be alternative pasts (a view which, as I have said, is prima facie</page><page sequence="13">MALT DOES MORE THAN PETER CAN 537 incompatible with God's omniscience) this is quite a different matter from showing that two alternative futures can both be realized. Hell, Geach thinks, is not so much a punishment for sin as the natural consequence of sin. Up to a point I could see that he had something of a case. If Hell exists in separation from God and the company of all nice people, and even the damned need both, those in Hell, I suppose, are likely to be extremely miserable. But according to Geach the damned are not only punished by being confined to one another's company, but by the extreme inclemency of the climate. And it is difficult to see how an inclement climate can be a natural consequence of sin. In any case the distinction between the natural consequences of an action and a punishment, which is not entirely free from difficulty where human punishment is concerned - it is not clear whether the punishment of a child who is left by his mother to burn his own bedclothes as a result of playing with matches in bed is natural, because his mother did not bring it about, or artificial, because she could have prevented it - is extremely obscure when applied to the actions of an omnipotent and omniscient being, depending as it does upon the distinction between what this being brings about and what he simply does not prevent. I enjoyed reading Professor Geach's book. It is forcefully, clearly and arrestingly written. It is enriched by enviable erudition, though it is un fortunate that the reader is not enabled to take more advantage of Geach's scholarship by more specific references to the philosophers - Aristotle, Aquinas, Jonathan Edwards and Schopenhauer are those most frequently mentioned - whose views Geach discusses. The tone is confident, and his enemies, and sometimes his friends, get short shrift, which is perhaps a manifestation of Harrison's Law, that the dogmatism with which a view is held varies inversely with the degree to which it approximates to knowledge. Since, it is said, even the devil may quote scripture for his purpose, I hope Geach does not find it impertinent if I remind him of the scriptural remark: 'Judge not that ye be not judged. For with what judgement ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again', a remark which one hopes was not intended to apply to those who write book reviews. But it was distressing to see the hand which so deftly wields the scalpel so readily resort to a bludgeon. I do not think an analytic table of contents makes a subject index unnecessary. I regard Geach's use of the word 'disimprove' as the work of the Philological Arm; there is no such word, or if there is, there ought not to be.</page></plain_text>
