<plain_text><page sequence="1">ENGLISH THE POPULAR ART IN MEXICO Popular art is the manifestation of the artistic sensibilities of a people. Alhough it is intimately related to the decorative, or minor, arts and may reveal marginal aspects of great art, its strength and importance lie in the fact that while creating an artistic expression it reveals the psychology of the society that has fathered it and reflects its morality and customs. Dr. Atl, in his now classic "Popular Arts in Mexico" which was published nearly fifty years ago says, "Popular arts are those which spring spontaneously from a people as an immediate consequence of their family, civil or religious needs. When they are cultivated under an artistic or com- mercial influence foreign to these needs they cease to be true popular arts." Popular art comes directly from the hands of the people, created under the inspiration of their traditions, but despite this it is not a static manifestation which is denied all op- portunities for change, for this would sap its vigor and destroy it. Rather is it constantly renewed by fresh influences and quickly adapts itself to the changes which affect the society whose taste it reflects. Thus it constitutes a panoramic view of the life and customs of a people in all the triumphs and reverses of its history. In contrast to other lands, whose popular art is on the verge of disappearing and may soon only be found in museums in response to a trend towards mechanization and standardization, in Mexico popular art plays a dynamic role. It is kept alive and vigorous in the consciousness of the people who employ it ih the thousand and one objects of daily life. It is found in their clothing, in hats, sashes, handbags and jewelry; it is utilized in their homes and in their work to make life more pleasant and satisfy the Mexican's inborn urge to live surrounded by art, by artistic objects fashioned from the most diverse materials, such as metal, wood, leather, glass, straw, wax, textiles, bone, shell, chicle and ceramics, all transformed by some magic into a portion of the soul of Mexico, a concrete display of what millions of Mexicans are thinking, feeling and creating. We can say that popular art is manifested wherever Mexicans dress, eat or amuse themselves, in their music, dances and popular festivals, when they laugh, weep or pray. It accompanies them when they pay tribute to their dead and when they gather with the living. And it is the medium through which they communicate with their gods. To survey Mexican popular art is to see the Mexican from the inside, in his home, in the market, in customs and traditions, rituals and dances. It is to share his hours of 97</page><page sequence="2">sorrow and days of rejoicing. It is to perceive him as a whole in body and soul. With reason Dr. Atl considers popular art as one of the most important facets of the personality of a people and says: "It is through its study that one can accurately gauge certain qualities of a people. What can the study of Mexican popular arts reveal to us? I say: a great artistic sensitivity and especially a strong decorative flair, enormous physical endurance, a methodic spirit, a strong spirit of assimilation, an individualistic spirit which changes and organizes with its own stamp of individuality what is assimilated, an ad- mirable manual dexterity and a vivid sense of fantasy." THE INDIAN BACKGROUND OF MEXICAN POPULAR ART. Salvador Novo tells us that in addition to the codices recording the tributes paid to the Aztec Empire which are in effect a catalogue of the rich variety of arts and crafts of the subject peoples, it is to the early chroniclers of the Conquest to whom we are indebted for the first descriptions of Mexican crafts. "In their writings we find a procession of gold and silver work, cotton clothing, spun fibers, he- nequén cloth, palm leaf and rush mats, jaguar, puma, otter, deer and other skins, wood, paper, necklaces, shields, flint knives, brass and copper axes, wooden vessels painted in brilliant colors, bowls and troughs quaintly carved and fashioned', fly whisks, fans, bows and arrows, 'very smooth and painted' bone bracelets, nose plugs, multicolored featherwork which they called 'the shadow of the gods' from which were fashioned panaches, capes and many ornaments, sea shells, turquoise mosaics, gems, cordage, textiles embroidered and worked in feathers, and the san- dals they use instead of shoes." It is to these Indian origins that most of our native crafts owe their bright colors, varied forms and textures and the extraordinary artistic sensitivity they reveal. The great cul- tural legacy of the great Mexican pre-Hispanic sculptors, potters, painters and metal workers was preserved even after the destruction of their culture in the memories of the subjected peoples who made themselves custodians of such a formidable tradition of craftsmanship and brought it forth with renewed vigor in all the works of the cultural endeav- ors of New Spain which were imposed by the European conquerors. Arts and crafts were the most favorable medium for this labor because of their strong and intimate ties with the oppressed classes. Again, Salvador Novo, the chronicler of the City of Mexico, has stated: "In colonial days the old Indian custom of group- ing artisans by trade in certain streets persisted, and even in the past century the streets of Mexico bore the names of the craftsmen who labored in them. Thus one could stroll from Plateros (Silversmiths) across the plaza to Tala- barteros (Leather Workers) or visit the street of Cordeleros (Ropemakers) and others and watch in the small workshops the artisans toiling at their work." EUROPEAN AND ASIATIC INFLUENCES Against this important Indian background was projected, from the 16th century on, the influence of new elements brought in by the Spanish conquerors embracing an age- old tradition to which a great diversity of peoples had contributed: Iberians, Celts, Phoenicians, Greeks, Tartessians, Carthaginians, Romans, Byzantines, Visigoths, Jews, and Arabs, all of whom had left in Spain the imprint of their language, religion, customs, laws and artistic traditions. These new materials and techniques introduced by the Spaniards enabled the Indian craftsmen to achieve a higher level of perfection and new forms of expression, but on the other hand they destroyed all those aspects of native popular art which had been associated with the old cultural and religious forms. Bereft of their gods and cultural expressions, the ancient inhabitants of the land witnessed the destrucfion of the conditions which had made possible the emergence of their peculiar native art which was thus suppressed. Such exquisite arts as featherworking in which the bright plumage of tropical birds was worked into capes, headdresses, fans and an infinity of beautiful objects only survived in a bitter caricature of what had been in the form of bird designs mounted on cards. And even these have now disappeared. The gold and silver work of Indian artists, which so im- pressed European observers on account of its technical and artistic perfection, has also disappeared, first with the melting down into ingots of the marvelous objects surren- dered to the Spaniards whose loss even Bernal Diaz del Castillo mourned as "too beautiful to disappear" and later with the prohibition of the right of the conquered to use or work in precious metals which was an exclusive privilege of Europeans. However, on the other hand, the Indian received encour- agement and instruction from such missionaries as Bishop Vasco de Quiroga, who promoted the development of new crafts such as iron working (all the ironwork of convents and churches was executed by Indian blacksmiths) or stimu- lated the existing crafts to higher levels of perfection such as the lacquer and copper work in the present state of Michoacan and wood carving. The Spaniards. taught the Indian to grow and use wool. He also introduced the distaff, the foot loom, the lathe, glass and iron, fine leathermaking, glazed pottery, the splendor of colonial silver work and also new themes and sources of inspiration, which were usually associated with the rites of the new religion, which when grafted onto the old religious ways by the Indian have produced a distinct and fascinating expression of spiritual fervor. On the other hand, during the entire colonial period New Spain received an intense commercial stimulus from the Orient through the legendary Nao de China (China Ship) which brought oriental merchandise assembled in the Philippines to Acapulco for transshipment across Mexico to Veracruz and thence to Cadiz. The yearly arrival of the ship was the occasion for the celebration of a fair where these exotic goods were sold, exhibited or exchanged. These oriental influences enriched the common cultural heritage and were the inspiration for certain adaptations, such as the so-called Puebla Talavera ceramics with a blue glaze over a white background which originated in Meso- potamia and Egypt and from there were carried to China where, with local adaptations, they became immensely popular. They also reached Mexico direcly from Spain, where during the 16th century they were produced in quantities at Talavera de la Reina which gave them the name they are known by in Mexico. Likewise, there are strong oriental roots (especially Chinese) in Mexican silver work of the 18th century and in lacquerware, especially that from Quiroga with its colored flowers and leaves against a black, white or red background, and that from Uruapan and Patzcuaro where gold inlays have been added. THE RESULTS OF INTERBREEDING Salvador Novo has described in a masterly fashion the basically mixed origins of Mexican popular art. "The first contact between craftsmen of the two cultures took place at Santa María de la Victoria in Tabasco in 1519 . . . Cortes commanded two of his carpenters to make a high wooden cross and ordered the Indians to erect a 'fine and well built altar' Thus Spanish and Indian craftsmen joined efforts to give birth to a new craftsmanship with a dual origin, the Spanish, rich in European tradition, and the Indian." So Mexican popular art achieves a peculiar and attractive aspect with its mysterious and shrouded origins, which combine in a most admirable manner mysticism with a joyous fantasy which is charmingly ingenuous. This mixture on a wide scale is the outstanding charac- teristic of Mexican popular art and has given rise to one of the most extensive and varied assortments of arts and crafts not only in America but in the whole world. In fact, although Dr. Atl considered that Mexico occupied third place in the world as a producer of manual arts ("second place goes to Japan and the first to China") we ourselves hold that Mexico, together with India and China, is one of the trio of countries whose production of artistic crafts is richest, most varied and most valuable, since Japan suffers*from a pro- nounced tendency to industrialize its popular arts, which makes them lose their authenticity. The assimilation of the cultural contributions of so many peoples to Mexican arts and crafts has produced a great complexity of techniques, forms and styles. This mixing of cultures explains the rich variety and originality of this great minor art. 98</page><page sequence="3">COMMON THEMES IN MEXICAN POPULAR ART Due to their complex origins Mexican artisans sometimes express themselves in themes which are startling to other climes and sensibilities. Death Prominent among these is the theme of death, so familiar to us from the great sculptures of pre-Hispanic Mexico, of which the most outstanding example is the majestic and terrifying Coatlicue, Goddess of the Earth and of Life, who wears the mask of death, or perhaps the beautiful skull shaped in rock crystal by the master hand of an Aztec craftsman. The theme is perpetuated in the bittersweet humor of great popular cartoonists, such as Santiago Her- nandez, Manuel Manilla and Guadalupe Posada, who highlighted events in the daily life of the people through the portrayal of figures of skeletons showing an ironic grin full of sarcastic humor in which Death is a personality with human traits, a friend or companion with whom we can make a joke. Diego Rivera said of Posada, "His talent was as corrosive as the acid he used to prepare his etchings in holding up to scorn the Establishment of his day". "Posada: Death has become a carrouser who fights, gets drunk, cries and dances". "A friendly death, a death which becomes a thing of articulated cardboard to be moved by pulling a string". "Death as a sugar candy skull, a death to feed the sweet tooth of children while their elders fight and fall dead or or are hung by the neck". "A reveling death which takes part in dances and visits the cementery to eat 'mole' and drink pulque among the graves." ". . . All are portrayed as skeletons, from cats and bean sellers to Porfirio Díaz and Zapata and including ranchers, artisans and 'dudes' as well as workers, farmers and even Spaniards". Although to a person from the Old World or one who has absorbed its culture the thought of death is a horrifying one, most Mexicans do not consider it as a denial of life, but rather as a complement to it and they accept it so naturally that they eat candy skulls, play with skeleton puppets to produce a macabre dance, buy the little figures known as "padrecitos" which have a chick pea for a head and which, glued to a strip of paper, march in a procession carrying a tiny coffin or gather around a tomb from which when a string is pulled a skeleton appears with a bottle in his hand. Death is also represented in all manner of clay or cardboard skeletons: cyclists, priests, "charros", mothers with children in their arms, street musicians who paradoxi- cally assume oddly lifelike postures, even a couple dressed as bride and groom, ironically portraying Death as partici- pating in the sacrament that perpetuates life! This is a basic idea which goes back to the very roots of the Indian half of Mexican culture. To the pre-Hispanic Mexican death is only a necessary prelude to resurrection; one must die to be born again and it is death which is the great creator of life. The celebration of the "Day of the Dead" (November 2) is a source of inspiration for the artisan who devotes part of his production to it: incense burners for the special altars honoring the dead in the homes or grave ornaments. Those from the State of Oaxaca are very beautiful as are those of Santa Fe de la Laguna in Michoacán, from the Barrio de la Luz in Puebla in black glaze known as "toritos" and surrounded by candles and marigolds, those of black glaze also from Metepec in the State of México, the polychromed ones of Matamoros, Puebla and Ocotlán, Oaxaca, about which are portrayed the dead souls as tiny figures clasping hands. In the states of Oaxaca, Jalisco and Guanajuato polychromed pottery toys representing death are made and in Toluca little tombs, animals, flower baskets and shoes of spun sugar are made for the souls of dead children. Altars are also decorated with garlands of tinfoil and tissue paper flowers and paper cutouts with allegorical figures as well as the traditional sugar candy skulls with tin foil and the names of dead relatives written on the bony foreheads. THE NATIVITY In contrast to all this, another of the great themes which inspire the artisan to interpret it in every possible type of medium is The Nativity which at Christmas time, together with the "posadas" and pastoral plays is a traditionally hallowed element. In the Nativity Mexicans see a symbol of renovation and the Indian or meztizo artisan combines the earthly and the divine in a hope for a better life and expresses this hope in figures and colors which blend ten- derness with gaiety. What material can be more lowly than straw? But what marvelous stylizations of line it acquires, what elegance, in the design of those straw Nativity angels from Tzintzuntzan, Michoacán, as an example and proof of a refined ancestral artistic sense. No less humble and even more symbolic are the small dried everlasting flowers which the people of San Antonio, near Ocotlán, Oaxaca, use to manufacture their Christmas decorations, in the form of a half moon in which are crudely drawn in flowers the three actors in the divine drama, the Christ Child, the Virgin Mary and Saint Joseph. As are those created by an Indian artist, Teodora Blanco,- in Atzompa, Oaxaca, who with her hands seems to "embroider" the soft clay with primitive technique of pastiche and produces delicate objects of great sensitivity and beauty which are becoming known internationally. Equally worthy are the "creches", or "misterios" which Alberto Jimenez, of Arrasóla, Oaxaca, makes of wood and frames in a niche-like scenes from a pastoral play whose images remind us in the priestly gravity of their solemn expressions of the early wood carvings of seated virgins in medieval European art. In contrast to this sobriety, the explosion of Indian ba- roque in clay at Metepec, State of Mexico, is a veritable festival of forms and colors sprung from the deepest layers of Mexican nationality, with its rosy archangels, virgins with embroidered cloaks, kings riding on magenta elephants and camels, where even the traditional animals about the manger are decorated with flowers and colored stars. Among the figurines related to this theme are the out- standing and most original mysterious creatures produced by the potters of Ameyaltepec, San Agustín de las Flores and Tolimán, Guerrero. These tall and slender winged beings are stylized and ethereal, with slanted Oriental eyes and executed in shades of cream and ocher to remind one of Etruscan statuettes with their heads arranged in elegant coiffures. The discreet use of color, the elegance of the slender figures and their enigmatic expressions confer an 99</page><page sequence="4">incomparable attractiveness on these creations which are so different from anything else found in Mexican crafts. Perhaps the most famed and popular "nacimientos" are the miniature figures which are hand modeled and painted in Tlaquepaque, Jalisco, in which in addition to the tradi- tional members of the nativity scene are also added such modern Mexican types as balloon and "taco" vendors, broom sellers, water carriers, postmen, people eating and roasting meat at a fire, shepherds warming themselves at a blaze and many other quaint types with which the poorer classes are familiar in their daily round of activities. Among the themes that are frequently repeated in ceramics is the "tree of life", a traditional wedding present in the form of a candelabrum whose decorative motifs vary ac- cording to the season of the year. Perhaps the best known of all these are the ones from Metepec in the State of México which form an intricate tangle of angels with trumpets, flowers and Biblical characters such as Adam and Eve in a bizarre crowd which displays all the grace and ingenuous- ness so characteristic of Mexican handcrafts, with that prim- itivism of form and color so difficult if not impossible to imitate by those who have neither the grace nor the naïveté of those simple artists as yet unspoiled by academic disciplines. Similar artifacts are found in Izúcar de Matamo- ros, Puebla, with a glazed finish and in Acatlán, Puebla, where the dazzling colors have been replaced by the natural black or dark brown hue of the fired clay, which in combi- nation with the intricate design confers on them an in- comparable elegance and attractiveness. Each piece is unique, true poems in ceramics from the hands of Herón Martínez, one of the most notable workers in this medium. OTHER TRADITIONAL FESTIVALS Practically every occasion and celebration provides a theme and a reason for the manufacture of handcrafted articles. On Corpus Christi Day vendors everywhere sell tiny mules fashioned from reeds or palm leaves laden with scale-sized pots, jars and bowls which are specially made för the pur- pose in practically every part of the country. During Easter Week beginning with Palm Sunday palm leaves braided and artistically interwoven with flowers are sold at church doorways and after being suitably blessed by the priest are taken home and devoutly preserved. In Metepec crucifixes with the figure of Christ are made of polychromed clay and in Oaxaca wooden niches with scenes of the crucifiction or tin niches with figurines representing episodes of the Passion of Christ such as the Prayer in Gethsemane, the Taking, the Three Falls with the Cross and the Crucifixion itself are portrayed. On the Friday before Palm Sunday an Altar of Sorrows is prepared, especially in Puebla and Morelos, with paper cutouts, paper banners, tiny flower pots, hollow pottery sheep which when filled with water and covered on the outside with sticky chia seeds sprout a "coat" of green fleece, blown glass spheres which are filled with colored water and piled on top of each other, paper flowers, decorated candles and carpets of flower petals in the streets wihch are quickly perishable but authentic works of art. On Holy Thursday and Good Friday the traditional and handsome "Judases" are sold, figures representing skeletons, demons, popular personalities, "charros", clowns and so on, made of cardboard which are sometimes more than life size. The best ones are made in Guanajuato and Mexico City. The larger ones are filled with fireworks to be lit on Resurrec- tion Saturday to the sound of "matracas" (wooden rattles) with the apparent object of punishing the traitor Judas but perhaps including a deeper significance in an act of purifica- tion of the past through fire, as a renewal for the new year which the ancient Mexicans celebrated with great festivities at this season, as they considered that the new year began when Nature quickened into spring life. We should not overlook the unique religious concept of the Mexican people, especially those of Indian origins: imper- turbable idols repose behind altars as the well known writer Anita Brenner so aptly put it. The Independence festivities also furnish inspiration for the manufacture of objects with patriotic, inscriptions such as "Viva Father Hidalgo!" "jViva La Independencia!" and figurines of the heroes of the Independence movement, or flags, and uniformed soldiers of the period. The festival of the Virgin of Guadalupe on December 12 is celebrated in various parts of the country and especially in Oaxaca, Texcoco and Puebla with the sale of images of the Virgin, either alone or in her appearances to Juan Diego. At Christmas time, in addition to the nativity scenes which we have already mentioned, "piñatas" form an in- dispensable part of the "posadas" which begin on December 16 and end on December 24. These posadas symbolically reenact the search for lodgings in Bethlehem by Saint Joseph and the Virgin before the birth of the Christ Child. Special songs filled with poetic imagery are sung, a candlelit Pr®" cession, preceded by images of the Virgin and Saint Joseph marches around and knocks at a closed door begging ad- mittance which is at first denied by an answering group of singers within but after an exchange of several choruses the doors are opened and the Holy Pilgrims are granted shelter. All this is a prelude to the smashing of the traditional "piñata", a clay pot filled wih candies and charmingly covered over with cardboard and strips of tissue paper to assume the form of an animal, a clown, a flower or a star. The piñata is hung from a beam and lowered and raised by a rope while the children, one by one and blindfolded and armed with a club, attempt to smash it and bring down a cascade of sweets on which they hurl themselves with shrieks of delight. Nowadays the "piñata" has become a necessary part of any children's party and so, they are on sale in markets the year round. FANTASTIC, OR SURREALISTIC ART Another aspect of Mexican arts and crafts is a trend toward what might be called "fantastic art" which has strong surrealistic tones in Mexican popular art. In this trend can be included the votive tablets or "nearlkas" of the Huichol Indians. A wooden slab is coated with beeswax and then heavy colored woolen yarns are pressed down on this adhesive surface to build up quaint and curious patterns which entirely cover the original surface. Two-headed eagles, blue deer, Tau the Sun, the Corn Maidens, votive arrows, "Our Grandmother" Nakawe, the Fire Grandfather Tatewari, "The Great Planter", Watakame (the Huichol Noah) and other personalities from their magic world are represented in interpretations of their religious myths and the customs of their daily as well as spiritual life. Neither can the surrealistic nature of the cardboard "alebrijes" made by the Linares family in Mexico City be denied. These are odd fantastic animals in which real zoomorphic details are cleverly blended with others born in the imagination of the artist. The same is true of the ex- traordinary glazed polychrome ceramic objects of Ocumicho, Michoacán, in which are shown devils peering up out of the flames of hell or being devoured by serpents and other harmful beasts and dogs and wolves in dynamic attitudes and howling with bulging eyes being strangled by serpents. Such images recall the works of Hieronymous Bosch and the grim "examples" which during the Middle Ages per- suaded people to fear sin by showing them the horrors of hell. i Along i similar lines are the strange beings modeled in ocher clay mixed with raw cotton from Ameyaltepec, Toli- mán, San Miguel Huapan and San Agustín de las Flores, Guerrero. With their eyes sometimes located in their temples and their elaborate headdresses they call to mind extra- terrestrial beings. The figures are portrayed in desperate struggle against enormous serpents which attempt to devour them. They are completely covered with designs in reddish brown and black. Another modest surrealistic genius is undoubtedly Can- delario Medrano of Santa Cruz, Jalisco, Jn whose fertile in imagination have evolved the so-called "Noah's Arks in ung lazed polychromed ceramic, where Biblical characters are mixed in with mariachi bands with a Mexican flag waving over their heads, or the "kiosks of tastoanes" which depict those strangely costumed figures who take part in a dance-spectacle well known in the state of Jalisco in which 100</page><page sequence="5">the actors represent Santiago and the Spanish conquistadors on the one hand and the "tastoanes", or ancient lords (tactoanes) of Mexico on the other. This kind of pantomime goes on all day and ends with the death of Santiago whom the tastoanes arrest and try after defeating him. Paradox- ically the "tastoanes" wear long coats in clashing colors which are cut along the same lines as a dress suit with tails that flap at the least movement, together with short breeches, loudly colored hose and large shoes. They cover their faces with grotesque or ferocious masks of clay or leather rep- resenting a great-nosed individual or perhaps an animal and top off this astounding get-up with tremendous wigs made of cows tails dyed in various colors. The appearance of these "kiosks of tastoanes" with their outlandish costumes as they run downstairs pursuing each other with exaggerated gestures and striking each other with their wooden swords is startling to the uninformed stranger. Also to be classed in this surrealistic group are the crea- tions of Saulo Moreno, who with wire and cardboard makes his stylized openwork animals, skeletons of devils and angels who struggle to carry off the skeleton of a dead person or skeletons swinging from trapezes or dancing. MASKS Another popular medium for artisans is the mask, with its ancient origins so firmly rooted in Mexican tradition. In museums we can observe the marvelous and priceless masks of obsidian, jade, and turquoise mosaic. Even today the use of masks is common in popular festi- vals and particularly in Indian ritual dances. They are made of cardboard, clay, tin or wood, often with additions of animal teeth, fur and hair. Among the most artistically and esthetically valuable masks are the lacquered tiger masks made in Olinalá of colorín wood, with glass eyes and boar bristles; those of Parachico with a great panache which are worn in Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas, in the Dance of the Parachicos; those of Michoacan, such as the "black men", the "old men", "kings" and "Santiagos" and in general the ones which are made by the Yaqui and Tarahumara Indians in Sonora and Chihuahua. TOYS AND MINIATURES Toys and miniatures are found in every type of Mexican popular art. Figures braided from vanilla beans by the Totonaca Indians of Papantla, or the little baskets of flowers, tiny Virgins and other objects made from chicle gum at Talpa de Allende in Jalisco, the wooden rattles and card- board masks, puppets of different materials, clay whistles of ancient design, woven palm leaf rattles in the shape of fighting, cocks with feathers in their tails, small platters, chests and gourd cups from Olinalá, miniatures in pressed glass from Puebla, cardboard figures from Celaya, the tiny "arrocitos" of Guanajuato, tops, toys, marbles, tin soldiers, and in fact thousands of different objects in clay, lead, cloth, glass, leather and paper, all reproduce on a smaller scale the products of our native craftsmen or present their own peculiar characteristics, always executed with verve and ingenuity. But aside from these themes which have inspired our artisans the most important features of Mexican popular art are to be found in textiles and ceramics, which will be discussed in detail in the descriptions of Mexican crafts by states and by regions. Crafted textiles which reflect the influences affecting all the rest of our popular crafts retain such Indian creations as the huipil, skirts, sashes, quechquemitles, and some masculine items susch as the morral and others which reveal mixture of bloods such as the omnipresent "sarape" with its variations in the "jorongo" and the "cobija" or the "rebozo" which is also in general use all over the country. Ceramics is probably the oldest art in the new world and one of the most outstanding. It appeared in México simul- taneously with corn around 4000 B.C. It is the most impor- tant of our native crafts because of its long tradition and abundance through the entire country. From its earliest beginnings Mexican ceramics was an artistic product of the first rank, seeking not only utility but plastic beauty. In the hundreds of thousands of ceramic works, in the human and animal figurines, in the mystical anthropomorphic and zoomorphic stylizations, in the aston- ishing variety of domestic and ceremonial drinking vessels, the extraordinary skill and a prodigious plastic imagination of the Mexican Indian which has persisted to the present day is revealed. On the other hand, in the colonial period new techniques and designs were introduced which were modified to suit the Mexican taste, as in the case of the Puebla Talavera ware of oriental origin which had been introduced into Spain by the Arabs. In view of these different influences it can be said that Mexican ceramics can be divided into three main groups, that which is of purely Indian inspiration which uses the ancient techniques of free hand modeling or moulding under pressure as at Tepacán, Tikul, Coyotepec, Huaquechula, and Ameyaltepec; another group which has directly inherited Spanish techniques and designs with Asiatic influences such as the majolica ware of Puebla, Guanajuato and Dolores Hidalgo; and a third group which has resulted as a natural evolution of both trends and adapted to the taste of the great mestizo population, such as the ceramics of Valle de Bravo, Santa Fe de la Laguna, Tonalá, Tlaquepaque, Tzintzuntzan, Patambán and Metepec. Each part of the country produces its own ceramics which are readily identified by their individual characteristics. They may be porous, burnished, semi-glazed, glazed, enameled or painted. The decoration may be incised, perforated or inlaid. They may be hand moulded, fashioned in pottery or plaster moulds, or thrown on a potter's wheel. Their style mąy be primitive, realistic or stylized and the color of the clay of each region is distinctive. But all of them reveal the skill and imagination of the artisan who made in an infinite variety of forms utensils for domestic, ceremonial or dec- orative use, toys and architectural elements so common in Mexican architecture. So this usually lesser art has come to be the most eloquent expression of Mexican artistic taste. CONTRAST IN POPULAR ART The great variety of formative influences in Mexican popuar art has given it the great complexity and richness which characterize it and permit it to offer such notable contrasts. The delicacy of miniature objects in clay, wood, silver or glass contrast oddly with the clumsy size of a carboad "judas" with its mixture of vivid colors and popular satire. On the one hand is the humility of a clay object produced 101</page><page sequence="6">free hand without a wheel and on the other is the magnif- icence of gold and silver jewelry or the silk rebozos (shawls) of Santa Maria. From a practically indestructible material such as stone or onyx we pass rapidly to such fragile beauties as a decorated candle or a carpet of flower petals or some painted and gaily decorated corn torillas which will only provide a moment's joy. On the one hand is baroque decoration, generally with flowers and animals like the "petatillo" ware of Tonala, Jalisco and on the other the elegant sobriety of a burnished black clay water jar from Coyotepec, Oaxaca. At times the artist handles his pigments with restraint and delicacy, as in the cream and ocher terra- cottas of Ameyaltepec and the burnished red ware of Oco- tlan, Tlaxcala, and at others his colors seem to explode in his hands as in the ceramics of Metepec or the wooden animals of Arrasóla, Oaxaca, with their daring combinations of yellows, greens, pinks, magentas and fiery reds. But always one is aware of an innate sense of proportion and a harmony between even the most daring clash of colors, qualities seldom found in other lands. THE ARTISAN Although generally handcrafts are produced in small vil- lages or Indian communities there are some which come from large cities and even México City itself. This makes for considerable variation in the type of person engaging in such activities. On the one hand there is the Indian living in a remote district who produces objetes for his personal use, clothing and articles for celebrating religious ceremonies with no intention of selling them. On the other hand there is the rural dweller who employs his spare time in handcrafts from local materials either for his personal use or a source of marginal income. And lastly there is the resident of larger cities who devotes his entire time and artistic talents to the manufacture of handcrafts for sale. Such crafts are usually family enterprises in which from childhood the future artisan is trained in traditional tech- niques and artistic taste and by first performing the simpler tasks in the company of all the other members of his family, children, women and adults under the guidance of the dominant member and master craftsman, learns his trade. Although the majority of artisans limit themselves to copy- ing traditional models learned from their elders, occasionally creati /e artists will appear to innovate and create new designs to maintain their craft as a living expression of the artistic feelings of the community without which it would stonate. Such innovators are Herón Martínez of Acatlán, Puebla, Candelario Medrano of Santa Cruz, Jalisco, and Teodora Blanco of Atzompa, Oaxaca. THE IMPORTANCE OF POPULAR ART "If there is anything which truly depicts the personality of a country it is its popular handcrafts." Rubén M. Campos Standardization, which little by little is overwhelming that group of nations who share our so-called western cul- ture, tends to erase those traditions which formerly gave each its own individual character in favor of an imitation of fashions and customs which are admired as more modern or progressive. Thus the beautiful traditions of each nation which were genuinely artistic are giving way to a desire to imitate what is fashionable and the anonymity of mass produced articles is displacing those that are the result of creativity and skill. The impersonal coldness of the machine is dominating the human warmth of the artist. However, in Mexico it is gratifying to observe that there is a growing tendency toward a renewed appreciation of popular arts. This trend should be encouraged not only be- cause mass produced articles can never meet the human desire for art and beauty but also because popular art links the individual to the group in which he belongs, strengthening his personality and national consciousness since popular art is the truest expression of the artistic sensibility of his country.</page></plain_text>
