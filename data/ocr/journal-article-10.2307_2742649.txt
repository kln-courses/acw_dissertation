Smith EUROPEAN UPPER PLEISTOCENE HOMINIDS are classified as either Homo sapiens neanderthalensis (archaic H. sapiens) or H. sapiens sapiens (modern H. sapiens). In the 126 years since the discovery of the Feldhofer Cave Neandertal specimen, numerous hypotheses have been formulated with regard to the phylogenetic relationship between these two taxa. (For discus- sions and analyses of the major ideas see Hrdlicka 1927; Howell 1952, 1957; Vallois 1954, 1958; Brace 1962, 1964; Brose and Wolpoff 1971; Howells 1973, 1976; Smith 1976b; Wolpoff 1980a; Spencer and Smith 1981). Although several of these hy- potheses have been rendered untenable by accumulating data, there is still no universal agreement on the significance of the Neandertals for the ancestry of modern Europeans. At the present time, the controversy centers on the extent to which gene flow into Europe contributed to the appearance of modern European H. sapiens (Howells 1976, Trinkaus and Howells 1979, Wolpoff 1980a, Spencer and Smith 1981). Some paleo- anthropologists favor migration of modern H. sapiens into Europe (sometimes admitting the possibility of some assimila- tion of Neandertals) as the explanation for this phenomenon, while others favor substantial gene flow without extensive population movement. Still others (Brace 1979b, Brace and Montagu 1977, Wolpuff 1980a, Brose and Wolpoff 1981) argue for an indigenous transition from archaic to modern H. sapiens. For a number of reasons, consideration of the relationship between Neandertals and modern H. sapiens in Europe has been based primarily on fossil material from Western Europe. Much less attention has been focused, at least by Western European and non-European anthropologists, on the Upper Pleistocene hominid remains from Central and Eastern Europe. To a cer- tain extent this situation is understandable. In addition to the sociopolitical factors elucidated by Brace (1964; Brace and Montagu 1977), the fact that many Central or Eastern Euro- pean specimens are described and many significant studies are published in languages and/or sources that are not generally accessible to many English- and French-oriented scientists can- not be overlooked. Perhaps more significant, however, is the apparent assumption (perhaps subconscious) of some scholars that Upper Pleistocene hominid evolution in other portions of Europe simply reflects what occurred in Western Europe and that there is no need to investigate closely the fossil hominid material from these areas independent of Western European specimens and evolutionary patterns. For example, relatively little attention is normally paid to Central European Neander- tal remains such as Ochoz and Sipka, even though they were among the earliest discovered. The Krapina remains are rarely afforded the consideration they merit as the largest sample of Neandertal specimens known from a single locality and for the light they shed on questions of variation in European archaic H. sapiens populations. Furthermore, in most considerations of the early modern European H. sapiens sample, material from Western European sites such as Cro-Magnon and Grimaldi gets disproportionate attention, while that from sites such as Mladec and Brno is hardlv mentioned.

This neglect is especially unfortunate because of the strategic geographic position of Central (espe- cially South-Central) Europe between Western Asia, viewed by most "migrationists" as the source for modern European H. sapiens, and the remainder of Europe. Any discussion of the transition to modern H. sapiens in Europe should carefully examine the Central European data. One aim of this review is to attempt to rectify this situation to some extent by examining the Upper Pleistocene hominid remains from South-Central Europe on a site-by-site basis. A second aim is to describe the pattern of Upper Pleistocene hominid evolution in South-Central Europe and its relation- ship with and significance for that in other areas of Europe. Such a consideration should shed considerable light on the transition between H. sapiens neanderthalensis and H. sapiens sapiens not only in this region, but also in the continent as a whole. GEOGRAPHICAL BACKGROUND South-Central Europe is defined here as the Pannonian Basin and the drainage systems that extend into portions of the sur- rounding higher elevations. This region, schematically repre- sented in figure 1, includes most of Hungary, eastern Austria, western Rumania, northern Yugoslavia, and the southern por- tions of Moravia and Slovakia (Czechoslovakia). The high- lands may be visualized as forming two partial crescents, one beginning with the Austrian Alps and extending south and east through Yugoslavia, terminating in the Balkans, and the other stretching from the Transylvanian Alps through the Carpa- thians, Tatras, Sudetes, and Erz and the hilly regions of Bohemia. With some exceptions (e.g., the Alps), these high- lands are not excessively high and are dissected by numerous river valleys; they are not impenetrable barriers, although some (particularly the southern group) are quite rugged.2 Furthermore, to the northwest, the Bohemian highlands pro- vide minimal separation between South-Central Europe and portions of Germany and Poland. Nevertheless, this region is one of the most distinctly defined geographic zones in Europe. Consequently, it is one of the best in which to investigate relatively localized "populational" changes in Upper Pleisto- cene fossil hominids. South-Central Europe was an attractive and productive en- vironment for Upper Pleistocene hunters. Even during cold phases, the plains were grassy steppe, not tundra (Frenzel 1965; see also Butzer 1971), supporting a large variety of herbivores (Thenius 1962). Archaeological sites in the plains are mainly open-air, and many are characterized by extensive loess deposits (see Flint 1971). The lower highlands were character- ized by woodlands interspersed with open grassland (Frenzel 1965, 1968). The majority of the sites in this zone, unlike those of the plains, are caves and rock-shelters. In certain regions, notably the Moravian karst, caves (or at least cave entrances) 2 During the Pleistocene, however, snow lines were considerably lower-during cold periods (Butzer 1971), and other conditions would have made passage difficult at times for Paleolithic hunters. tA FiG. 1.

Most of the fossil hominid remains of South-Central Europe come from the karst and surrounding regions of Moravia and the semimountainous Hrvatsko Zagorje in northern Croatia (Yugoslavia). Sites in Moravia include Predmosti, Dolni Vestonice, Sipka, Kfilna, Mladec, and Brno; the sites of Krapina, Vindija, and Velika Pecina are located in the Hrvatsko Zagorje. Various other remains come from scattered locations including sites in Slovakia (Sala, Ganovce), Hungary (Suba- lyuk), Austria (Willendorf, Miesslingstal), and central Croatia (Veternica). CHRONOLOGICAI, FRAMEWORK The chronological framework (fig. 2) employed here is based on the division of the Wuirm outlined for the Moravian karst by Musil and Valoch (1966) and subsequently applied by Valoch (1968) to Central Europe in general. This framework has worked well in interpreting Upper Pleistocene stratigraphy in Moravia and agrees generally with chronological frameworks employed in other areas of Europe (Butzer 1971, Flint 1971), including the well-documented sequences in the Netherlands (Zagwijn 1974, Grootes 1978) and northwestern France (Woillard 1978, Woillard and Mook 1982). The one possibly significant difference is that in the latter two sequences the Hengelo dates consistently around 40,000 B.P. (Woillard and Mook 1982, Grootes 1978), while in the Musil-Valoch scheme the corresponding Podhradem dates to between 32,000 and 40,000 B.P. The majority of the applicable Podhradem radio- carbon dates are around 40,000 B.P.; only a few are about 32,000 B.P., and there are essentially no dates in the mid- 30,000-year range. It may be that the more recent dates are anomalous. If so, the Podhradem would be equivalent in age to the Hengelo. Obviously, the Musil-Valoch framework can be applied to other areas of South-Central Europe only with considerable caution. Given the complexity of the Wtirm and the differences that can occur even between Wurm deposit sequences from adjacent caves (Butzer 1971, Flint 1971, Zeuner 1959), it is unlikely that any scheme can be applied with great precision over so extensive a geographic region. Nevertheless, the Musil- Valoch scheme has been adequate as a framework in the Hrvatsko Zagorje (Wolpoff et al. 1981) and is consistent with available radiocarbon dates from other areas. Therefore, it appears to allow for at least rough chronological comparisons between the various subregions of South-Central Europe.

Smith: HOMINID EVOLUTION IN SOUTH-CENTRAL EUROPE ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND The Upper Pleistocene fossil hominid specimens of South- Central Europe are associated with Middle and Upper Paleo- lithic assemblages. While a detailed discussion of the archaeo- logical background is neither feasible nor appropriate here, certain aspects of the archaeological framework need to be considered. Recent detailed considerations of the Paleolithic in Central Europe may be found in Valoch (1968, 1972, 1976a), Kozlowski (1975), Ivanova (1979), Chmielewski (1972), Frayer (1978), Coles and Higgs (1969), and Hahn (1970, 1973, 1977). As Valoch (1972:61) has pointed out, the Middle Paleolithic of Central Europe has never been subjected to the type of systematic, detailed analysis that has been accomplished for that of Western Europe. Consequently, it is exceedingly diffi- cult to distinguish assemblages or facies within it. In fact, it is not clear what criteria should be employed in attempting to do so. Despite the difficulties, Valoch (1968, 1972) has identified four such facies: the Central European Typical Mousterian, spread throughout the region and comprised of two subfacies (Sipka Mousterian and Predmosti Mousterian); the Charentian, found in southern Germany but extending into Moravia (Kuflna, upper assemblages [see Valoch 1970]) and Hungary (Erd); the Middle Paleolithic with leaf points, found primarily in southern Germany and Poland but again extending into Moravia (Kfilna, middle assemblages); and the Tayacian, known from the sites of Kfilna (lower assemblage) and Ganovce. The Tayacian appears to be rather early, probably Riss-Wtirm interglacial (Valoch 1970), and exhibits some evidence of rela- tionship with the later Predmosti Mousterian (Valoch 1972). The Charentian seems to be rather late. Some of the radio- carbon dates for Erd (table 1) would place the Charentian from that site in the Podhradem interstadial. Stratigraphically, however, the Lrd Charentian appears to fall in a colder period prior to the Podhradem (Gabori-Csank 1968), and the radio- carbon dates have been questioned (Gabori-Csank 1970). The Central European Typical Mousterian (at least the Sipka type) is found both at early Middle Paleolithic sites (Krapina) and at relatively late ones (Sipka). Of the few radiocarbon dates available for the Middle Paleo- lithic in this region (table 1), many only establish a minimum limit and are not particularly informative. The dates from Lebenstedt (North-Central Europe), Senftenberg, and Erd (e) all predate the Podhradem interstadial and are consistent with stratigraphic indications that most Middle Paleolithic assem- blages predate it. On the other hand, there are a number of dates (Erd, Tokod, Tata) that are quite late for the Middle Paleolithic. All of these dates, however, have been called into question by Gabori-Csank (1970) because they either do not fit with stratigraphic correlations in Hungary or are "too recent" for the Middle Paleolithic. Stratigraphic interpretations at Sipka place the late Middle Paleolithic assemblages in the Podhradem interstadial (Valoch 1965a). The Szeletian and the Aurignacian represent the earliest Upper Paleolithic assemblages in South-Central Europe. Both radiocarbon dates (table 1) and stratigraphic correlations (Valoch 1968, 1972, 1976a) indicate that the Szeletian is the older. Stratigraphic evidence suggests the Szeletian was present primarily during the Podhradem interstadial, while the Auri- gnacian extended from the end of the Podhradem into the Stillfried B (Valoch 1968). The Szeletian has a strong Middle Paleolithic component, and most archaeologists consider it to have evolved directly from some type of indigenous Middle Paleolithic (see Frayer 1978). The high frequency of foliate points in the Szeletian indicates a rather direct relationship with the "Middle Paleolithic with leaf point" tradition, but other aspects of Middle Paleolithic technology and artifact types are also retained and mixed with various elements more Vol. 23 * No. 6 * December 1982 669</page><page sequence="4">characteristic of Upper Paleolithic forms (Valoch 1968, 1972, 1976a; Chmielewski 1972). Earlier Szeletian assemblages tend to be more like the Middle Paleolithic than later ones. Finally, the Szeletian is generally found only in the eastern part of South-Central Europe (Rumania, Hungary, Moravia) and in parts of Poland and southern Germany (where it is known as Jerzmanowician and Praesolutrean respectively). Sites are known from mountain caves and open areas, with the former predominating (Valoch 1968). Many elements characterizing the Szeletian continue into the Aurignacian of South-Central Europe (foliate points, Middle Paleolithic-type scrapers, etc.) albeit in much lower frequencies. Additionally, the Aurignacian exhibits a greater frequency of typical Upper Paleolithic elements (various tools made from blades and bone tools) than the Szeletian and is more widespread. Split-based and Mladec-type bone points are characteristic (see Valoch 1968, Frayer 1978). Although Auri- gnacian radiocarbon dates tend to be more recent than Szeletian ones, some overlap exists (table 1). The Szeletian may simply represent a functional component of the Aurignacian, oriented toward the exploitation of particular resources (see Frayer 1978). Most workers, however, view the two as separate cul- tural units (Valoch 1968, 1972, 1976a; Vertes 1955, 1961; Chmielewski 1972). There is considerable disagreement about the origin of the Central and Eastern European Aurignacian. Although some archaeologists still look to the Near East (Kozlowski 1979), a number-notably Hahn (1970, 1973, 1977), Valoch (1972, 1976a), and Laplace (1958-61, 1970)-emphasize that its roots are evident in certain Central European Middle Paleolithic TABLE 1 RADIOCARBON DATES FOR THE MIDDLE AND EARLY UPPER PALEOLITHIC OF CENTRAL EUROPE SITE (STRATUM) SAMPLE No. DATE B.P.

Furthermore, both Hahn and Valoch (also Binesz 1963, Paunescu 1965) note that the frequency of Middle Paleo- lithic elements in the Aurignacian is significantly greater in the early phase than in later ones. Valoch (1967b) sees the develop- ment of the Aurignacian from a Moravian Middle Paleolithic industry called the "Krumlovian." He believes that the Auri- gnacian developed rather early in Central and Eastern Europe, citing as evidence the early radiocarbon dates from Istil5sk53 and the various Podhradem-age early Aurignacian strata in Moravia. The Eastern Gravettian (Pavlovian, in Moravia) follows, and appears to develop from, the Aurignacian in South-Central Europe. It consists almost entirely of tool types and technology characteristic of the Upper Paleolithic (Valoch 1968, Coles and Higgs 1969). Particularly interesting are the extensive and intricate bone and ivory industries, including both tools and art objects. Burials are also distinctive and include various accompaniments (e.g., Brno 2, Dolni Vestonice, Pfedmosti). The earliest Gravettian is found during the Middle Wurm stadial, and the culture persists until ca. 12,000 years ago in some areas (table 1; Frayer 1978, Valoch 1968, Gfabori-Csink 1970). REMAINS OF HOMO SAPIENS NEANDERTHALENSIS KRAPINA A rock-shelter on the Husnjakovo Brdo, on the outskirts of the town of Krapina in the Hrvatsko Zagorje, Yugoslavia, was excavated by Gorjanovi6-Kramberger between 1899 and 1905. It yielded an extensive array of faunal and archaeological material and the largest series of Neandertal skeletal remains known from a single site. Gorjanovie-Kramberger spent virtu- ally the rest of his life studying and publishing on the morphol- ogy of the fossil remains, the nature of the associated cultural remains, and their significance (Gorjanovie-Kramberger 1906, 1913; see also bibliography in Smith 1976b). In recent years, a number of newer studies have provided additional information on and reinterpretation of the Krapina hominid remains (e.g., Smith 1976b, 1978; Trinkaus 1978; Brace 1979b; Wolpoff 1979, 1980a; Alexeev 1979), site stratigraphy and chronology (Malez 1970a, 1978a), and fauna (Malez 1970b, 1978a). The Krapina deposits are divisible into 13 stratigraphic units, the upper 9 containing cultural material and ranging from the Riss-Wuirm interglacial through what appears to be the Lower Wuirm stadial (Malez 1970a, b, 1978a). While the stratigraphic positions of all the hominid specimens have not been determined from Gorjanovie-Kramberger's field notes (and some may never be), most are from Levels 3 and 4. These two levels have been collectively designated the "hominid' zone" (Gorjanovid-Kramberger 1906) and are correlated with the end of the Riss-Wiirm interglacial.4 A few specimens are Smith: HOMINID EVOLUTION IN SOUTH-CENTRAL EUROPE known from levels stratigraphically more recent than the hominid zone (Smith 1976b, Malez 1978a), but all are from Mousterian levels (see Gorjanovic-Kramberger 1913, Malez 1970c). Although a few Upper Paleolithic-like elements are found in the upper strata, no evidence of Upper Paleolithic cultural units is present. The Krapina hominid remains are fragmentary, at least in part because of cultural processes (Smith 1976b, c; Ullrich 1978). The sample for many elements is large enough, however, to allow considerably more consideration of Neandertal popu- lation variation than is possible with any other series from a single site in Europe or the Near East. For the discussion of Central European Neandertals, the Krapina specimens provide the majority of the pertinent data available. Approximately 800 fragments make up the sample, including almost 200 iso- lated teeth. On the basis of the dental remains, Wolpoff (1978, 1979) believes that around 80 individuals are represented. The total morphological pattern of the Krapina hominids clearly places them within H. sapiens neanderthalensis, and there is no feature that would exclude any Krapina specimen from this taxon (Jelinek 1969; Smith 1976b, 1978; Trinkaus 1978; Wolpoff 1979). Since most specimens are from subadult individuals (Wolpoff 1979, Smith 1976b), some variation in the sample is unequivocally age-related. However, even among adult specimens there is considerable variation. This is particu- larly true of anatomical regions represented by the largest samples-teeth, supraorbital tori, mastoid segments of tem- porals, and mandibles. Much of the non-age-related variation in these and other elements is probably explained by sexual dimnorphism (Smith 1976b, 1980; Wolpoff 1980a; Zobeck 1980; Smith and Ranyard 1980). Metrically, Krapina crania fall in the Neandertal range (often toward the small end) in every measurable feature (Gorjanovid-Kramberger 1906, Smith 1976b), and no morpho- logical feature qualitatively differentiates Krapina and Western European Neandertal cranial forms (Smith 1976b, 1978; Wolpoff 1980a; Alexeev 1979; Jelinek 1969). Neurocranial speci- mens from Krapina exhibit long, broad, and relatively low vaults with receding foreheads and broad occiputs. Temporal bones are characterized by robust mandibular fossae and mastoid processes that project only slightly or not at all beyond the occipitomastoid crest of the cranial base. Faces are relatively large and robust with wide interorbital areas, pillar- like lateral orbital margins, and well-developed supraorbital tori (fig. 3).

(GrN- 4299), is of unknown stratigraphic context and consequently does not serve to anchor any part of the long Krapina sequence (Smith 1976b). 3 Early dates for an Aurignacian-like early Upper Paleolithic component at Ba6o Kiro in central Bulgaria (Kozlowski 1975, 1979) also support this contention and help offset some of the objections of GCbori-Csdnk (1970) to the IstAlldsk5 dates. 'The faunal complex from the Riss-Wurm levels at Krapina indicates a warm or moderate climate (Malez 1970b, 1978a). Above these levels is a 3-m-thick virtually sterile layer containing eight large blocks which have apparently fallen from the rock-shelter roof. Malez (1978a) interprets this layer as marking the beginning of the first Wurm stadial. However, since the earliest phases of the Wtirm may have been mild (Butzer 1971, Zeuner 1959), it could represent the beginning of the first cold maximum of the Wiirm (Lower Wurm stadial, in the scheme employed here), around 60,000 B.P. (Butzer 1971). This could mean that the hominid zone dates to a mild period after the Riss-Wuirm interglacial but prior to the Lower WOrm stadial. Whether the hominid-zone specimens are considered late Riss-Wurm or early Wurm in age is not relevant to their relationships with other European fossil hominids investigated in this paper. Two radiocarbon dates have been obtained on bone from the Krapina deposits (Vogel and Waterbolk 1972). One, taken on Pleistocene Vol. 23 * No. 6 * December 1982 671</page><page sequence="6">able variation in thickness and projection, but all form con- tinuous osseous bars over the orbits which are contiguous with the interorbital and lateral orbital regions in the characteristic Neandertal manner (Smith and Ranyard 1980). Frontal sinuses are large and restricted to the torus, a typically Neandertal feature (see Vlcek 1967a). Nasal-root depressions and canine fossae are absent, indicating that Krapina nasal areas project anteriorly at the midsagittal plane. This creates the "beaked- face" morphology noted by Coon (1962) in "classic" Western European Neandertals. That the Krapina faces conform to this pattern is observable by visual inspection of the C cranium (fig. 3) and is borne out by facial angles (Alexeev 1979). The two specimens at Krapina for which nasal breadths are measur- able (Maxillae C and E) yield values approximately two standard deviations below the Western European Neandertal mean. While this might indicate that Krapina noses were nar- rower than Western European Neandertal noses, it may also be simply a reflection of the subadult age (Wolpoff 1979:112) of both specimens. Prognathism of the lower face is suggested by the presence of a retromolar space (a gap between the last molar and anterior edge of the ramus) in all the mandibles preserving this area. The lower face is also characterized by broad and elongated alveoli (indicated by bicanine breadths and alveolar heights respectively). Mandibles lack both mental eminences and trigones, and their symphyses angle forward from the base to the alveolus (fig. 4). Thus all symphyseal angles (measured from the basal margin) are greater than 900, and the average is 99.60 (Wolpoff et al. 1981). The anterior teeth in the Krapina sample are very large in both crown and root dimensions. In fact, no other Pleistocene sample has anterior teeth as large as Krapina's (Wolpoff 1979, Smith 1976b). That the Krapina teeth are larger than Western European Wurm Neandertal anterior teeth (table 2) is not surprising, since the majority of the Krapina teeth are probably earlier (Riss-Wuirm). Anterior tooth size appears to reach its peak in Riss-Wurm Europe and decrease steadily from this point through the later Pleistocene (Brace 1979a, Wolpoff 1980a, Frayer 1978, Smith 1976b). Posterior teeth are also larger than in later European Upper Pleistocene hominids, but this simply continues a trend in dental reduction begun by hominids in the Lower Pleistocene. Molars exhibit extensive taurodontism. The postcranial anatomy of the Krapina specimens is com- parable to that of other Neandertals (in that it is characterized by general postcranial robusticity), although the predominance of subadult material in the Krapina sample gives the impression of less rugosity than is common in Western European Neander- FIG. 4.

Like other Neandertals, the Krapina people exhibit a complex of features in the pectoral girdle indi- cating a powerful, barrel-shaped upper thorax (Hrdlicka 1930; Smith 1976b, c; Wolpoff 1980a) and muscular hands (Musgrave 1970, 1977). One of the most distinctive features of the Nean- dertal postcranium is a dorsal axillary groove on the scapula (Stewart 1962, 1964). This feature is rare in Upper Paleolithic hominids and virtually unknown in modern humans but present in 57.9% of Neandertals (Trinkaus 1977). At Krapina, 33.3% of adult scapulae exhibit this morphology, while 55.6% exhibit the Chancelade pattern5 (Smith 1976b). Trinkaus (1977) notes that the Chancelade pattern characterizes 36.8% of the total Neandertal scapula sample. One Krapina scapula ex- hibits the only ventral sulcus known for a Neandertal. Trinkaus (1978) finds that the lower postcranial elements at Krapina exhibit the same morphological pattern as those of other Neandertals and differ from those of modern humans only in average degree of robustness and in the presence of an elon- gated, thinned superior pubic ramus (see also Trinkaus 1976a, Smith 1976b). Stature estimates based on reconstructed adult long-bone lengths average 62.6 in. (N = 5) for Krapina, com- pared with 63.3 in. for Western European Neandertals (Smith 1976b). Finally, it was noted in an earlier study (Smith 1976b) that the adult occipitals and parietals from Krapina indicated no lambdoidal flattening or occipital bunning and that this might constitute a difference between Krapina and Western Nean- dertals. After more analysis, it seems that the pertinent regions on the adult specimens at Krapina are too fragmentary to justify such a conclusion. The only specimen which preserves enough of the posterior neurocranium to allow an assessment of lambdoidal flattening and occipital bunning is the juvenile B skull, and it clearly possesses both lambdoidal flattening and an occipital bun (see Smith 1976b: 39 and fig. 3). In sum, the Krapina Neandertals are not qualitatively separable from Western European Wuirm Neandertals on the basis of any morphological feature.6 They do not, as a group, exhibit any feature or complex of features that justifies their being considered "progressive" in comparison with Western European specimens. Differences between the two samples, where documented, are quantitative only and derive largely from the fact that much of the Krapina sample represents subadults. GANOVCE A largely complete travertine endocast (fig. 5) of a hominid was recovered from the Hradok travertine deposits near Ginovce in northern Slovakia in 1926. These deposits had been quarried since the 1880s; between the World Wars, Jaroslov Petrbok collected and reported on some of the paleontological remains they contained, among them an endocast that was recognized as hominid in 1937 and systematically analyzed by Vlcek (1953, 1955, 1969). When the significance of the find was recognized, an extensive, multidisciplinary investigation of the stratigraphy of the locality and its paleontological and archaeo- logical remains was undertaken (Vlcek et al. 1958). This in- vestigation established that the endocast belongs to a complex known as the younger travertine, dated to the Riss-Wuirm Smith: HOMINID EVOLUTION IN SOUTH-CENTRAL EUROPE (epeial th presenceR of Elpa anius andisma_o it HFIG.o5. the G ove . endocast,iateralavie.. _ interglacial on the basis of its vertebrate faunal remains (especially the presence of Elephas anhiqaus) and its malaco- logical and botanical material. Five Paleolithic horizons occur in the Hrftdok travertine complex. The endocast is probably associated with Horizon 4, classified as "Mousterian," pos- sibly a unique regional variant characterized by small tools (Vkek 1969). From the few adhering segments of the vault (portions of the left parietal, temporal, and occipital which are unseparable from the endocast itself) and the general shape of the endocast, an impression may be formed of the general shape of the cranium (Vlcek 1953, 1955, 1963). It is long, quite low, and moderately broad, with its maximum breadth at the level of the midparietal area-a distinctive Neandertal feature (Wol- poff 1980a). In norma verticalis, the occiput appears rather projecting, and there is definite indication of lambdoidal flat- tening. Very probably the cranium possessed an occipital bun. Furthermore, details of the morphology and measurements of the endocast itself are all in the Neandertal range (Vlcek 1953, 1955, 1969). The low and flat frontal lobes, considered particu- larly primitive by Vlcek, may be due to subsequent corrosion (Jelinek 1969). Cranial capacity is estimated at 1,320 cc, only slightly below the Riss-Wuirm Neandertal average and above the average for female Neandertals (Smith 1976b). The Ginovce specimen, like other Neandertals, also exhibits less cranial kyphosis than is the case in modern humans. During excavations in the HrAdok travertines in 1955, natural molds of a partial left fibula and a partial left radius were found (Vkek 1955). Since the bones were apparently not well-preserved before they were molded, nothing significant can be determined about them (VI6ek 1969). OCHOZ A hominid mandible was discovered by Rzehak in 1905 in Svedfxv Stfil Cave, near the village of Ochoz in the southern part of the Moravian karst region. Rzehak classified the speci- men as a Neandertal, relating it most closely to the Krapina and Sipka remains. KIz (1909) and Bayer (1925) argued that, since only Upper Paleolithic artifacts were found at the site, the specimen could not be a Neandertal. Kfit also claimed that it showed distant morphological similarities to the Pfedmosti hominids. Excavations between 1953 and 1955 (Klima et al. 1962, Vlcek 1969) have provided a reasonably clear picture of the geological and cultural stratigraphy of the site, and the presence of several Mousterian levels has been documented. It has proved impossible to determine the strati- graphic position of the mandible itself, but Kilima believes it o See Trinkaus (1977), Smith (1976b), or Stewart (1962, 1964) for further explanations of axillary border morphology. Wolpoff (1980a) has suggested that the juvenile A cranium may represent a transitional Neandertal-early modern specimen. He bases this suggestion on its stratigraphic position (it comes from Level 8 and is the only cranial vault known not to be derived from the hominid zone) and the fact that the vault is rather large for a Neandertal with so little browridge development. Though I do not object to this interpretation, I feel that we know so little about growth and development in Neandertals that this "disproportionate" relationship between browridge development and vault size may prove to be only an aspect of ontogenetic variability and not of phylogenetic significance. Vol. 23 * No. 6 * December 1982 673</page><page sequence="8">comes from a late Mousterian level in the "brown earth com- plex." In 1964, two small human cranial vault fragments and a human molar were found in a layer corresponding to this "brown earth complex" (Vaniura 1965). The fauna of this com- plex from both the 1953-55 (Musil in Klima et al. 1962) and the 1964 excavations suggests a time span from the end of the Riss-Wurm to the beginning of the Wiirm (Vlcek 1969:68). The Ochoz mandible preserves the alveolar region and denti- tion. (Only the right M3 is missing.) The rami and corpus base are missing, probably broken from the remaining portions by geological processes after deposition. Prognathism is indicated by the angled alveolar plane and the certainty that a retro- molar space was present. These and other features of the preserved portion of the mandible compare favorably with those of other Neandertals (Jelinek in Klima et al. 1962, Jelinek 1969, Vlcek 1969). The dentition also conforms to the Neandertal pattern. The teeth are large, with all but one crown breadth (M3) falling within a standard deviation of the corresponding Krapina means (table 2). Only the values for C, P3, and M3 exceed the Krapina means. The anterior teeth, as in other Neandertals, are relatively expanded and quite heavily worn (Smith 1976d), and the molars are taurodont (Jelinek 1969). The 1964 tooth, a right M3, morphologically and metrically indicates Neandertal affinities (VIcek 1969). The two 1964 cranial fragments, portions of a parietal and temporal squama, are largely nondiagnostic (VIcek 1969). On the external face of the mandibular symphysis a gentle concavity begins just below the alveolar margin of the incisors and extends inferiorly to where the specimen is broken-a distance of some 25 mm (see Vlcek 1969: figs. 2, 33, pl. 35). Rzehak (1905), Jelinek (1969 and in Klima et al. 1962), and Vlcek (1969) all consider this to be incipient chin development, comparing it with Sipka and Tabfin II. However, the lower portion of the mandibular symphysis is not present, so its morphology is unknown. Depressions below the incisors are associated with incipient mental eminence development in the Vindija and Sipka specimens, but their presence does not guarantee the presence of an incipient mental eminence. Both the J and H mandibles from Krapina, for example, have depres- sions comparable in development to those of the Ochoz, and neither shows the slightest trace of a mental eminence. In fact, the Ochoz remains would fit imperceptibly into the Krapina sample. SUBALYUK In 1932, excavation of the Pleistocene deposits in Subalyuk Cave, on the southern slope of the Biukk Mountains overlooking the Hor Valley in northern Hungary, yielded the fragmentary remains of an adult and a child in association with Mousterian tools (Bartucz et al. 1940). Unlike many of the other South- Central European Upper Pleistocene sites, Subalyuk was ap- parently not excavated utilizing the best of methodologies, and consequently the stratigraphic positions of some of the finds are open to question. Four stratigraphic complexes com- prised of 18 geological levels are identified in the 1940 mono- graph. The hominid remains are said to be contemporaneous and to come from the lower portion of Level 14 in Complex II (Bartucz et al. 1940). This complex contains "late Mousterian tools" and is supposed to coincide with the first Wurm cold maximum (Lower Wiirm stadial). The earlier Complex I is said to correspond, on floral and faunal grounds, to the Tata loess beds, which in turn are estimated to represent the tem- perature phases of the Early Wuirm (Vertes 1964). The Subalyuk adult is represented by a mandible (preserving the left corpus, with P4 through M3, the anterior portion of the left ramus, the symphysis with left C through right P3, and the right molars) and a few postcranial elements, including a sacrum and a manubrium. The manubrium is ventrally con- cave, indicating a typically Neandertal "barrel-shaped" upper thorax (Coon 1962). Both manubrium and sacrum indicate a very small individual. The mandible, which does not neces- sarily represent the same individual as the postcranial speci- mens, exhibits a retromolar space, receding symphyseal contour, no mental eminence, and taurodont molars (Bartucz et al. 1940: pl. 4, 5). The symphysis and left corpus are high but relatively thin compared with those of most Neandertals, and the alveolar plane is shorter and more vertically oriented than in the Krapina and Ochoz mandibles. Tooth breadths for the Subalyuk adult (Szabo in Bartucz et al. 1940) fall within one standard deviation of the Krapina means, only the Subalyuk canine and third molars being larger (table 2). The Subalyuk child is represented by a neurocranium, most of both maxillae, most of the deciduous dentition, and a nasal bone. Odontometric and morphological features show it to be a Neandertal approximately three years of age (Thoma 1963). The maxillae exhibit no trace of canine fossae; the nose is broad (20 mm) for a young child, and the frontal process of the maxilla is also broad (Thorma 1963). Furthermore, the curvature of the nasal bone (see Bartucz et al. 1940:pl. 6; Jelinek 1969) is vertical or slightly concave for some distance inferior to nasion and then becomes sharply convex. This sug- gests a projection of the nose along the midsagittal plane, which fosters the beaked-face appearance of Neandertal crania. A projecting supraorbital torus is not developed, but, as in other Neandertal subadults (Smith and Ranyard 1980), a distinct outline of a torus (in the form of a slight bulge) is observable (see Vlcek 1970). The neurocranium is long, rela- tively low, and broad compared with those of modern children of similar age (Thoma 1963). Biasterionic breadth is especially large, and there is a distinct indication of lambdoidal flattening and an incipient occipital bun. As in most other Neandertal children (Vlcek 1970, Smith 1976b), a metopic suture is present. VINDIJA Vindija, a large cave 50 km from Krapina, was first recognized as a Pleistocene-age locality in 1932, when Paleolithic artifacts and remains of Pleistocene animals were found there (Vukovi6 1935, Brodar 1938). Since systematic excavations began in 1974, over 80 fragments of Pleistocene human skeletal material, an extensive collection of Pleistocene fauna, and archaeological remains have been recovered (Malez 1975, 1978b, c; Malez et al. 1980). The stratified Pleistocene sediments provide an excellent sequence covering practically the entire Upper Pleistocene (Malez and Rukavina 1975, 1980; Wolpoff et al. 1981). Mousterian lithic material characterizes the Riss-Wiirm through Lower Wiirm levels and Aurignacian and Gravettian the Podhradem through Upper Wiirm levels. A radiocarbon date of 27,000 ? 600 years B.P. (table 1) is associated with the Aurignacian (Malez 1978b). The hominid remains from Vindija can be divided strati- graphically into three groups. The earliest and largest group comes from Level G3 and is associated with a late Mousterian assemblage. This stratum is correlated with the Lower Wiirm stadial on the basis of stratigraphic, faunal, and cultural criteria (Malez et al. 1980, Wolpoff et al. 1981). The middle group comes partly from Level G1, which probably represents the Podhradem interstadial. The only diagnostic artifact from this level is a split-based bone point, which is from the top of the layer and suggests that G1 is Aurignacian. Also included with this group are three isolated teeth from the Aurignacian Level Fd. The latest group comes from Level D and is associated with a Gravettian industry. The Vindija G3 hominid sample consists of some 35 speci- mens. These remains are fragmentary, but various taxo- nomically relevant anatomical regions are well represented. An extensive descriptive and comparative study of these hominids (Wolpoff et al. 1981) has demonstrated that their total morpho- logical pattern warrants their inclusion in the taxon H. sapiens neanderthalensis. This conclusion is based, in part, on the fol- 674 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="9">lowing criteria: the presence, in specimens preserving a supra- orbital area (N = 5), of supraorbital tori of Neandertal form (see also Smith and Ranyard 1980); frontal sinuses that are large and restricted to the torus proper (i.e., do not extend into the squama); the overall morphology and dimensions of the mandibles (N = 4), including the presence. of retromolar space (although the length of this gap is less than in the Krapina mandibles) (fig. 6); the presence of a dorsal axillary groove on the single scapular fragment; the wide anterior alveolus of the maxilla (prosthion-to-postcanine distance); and various aspects of vault morphology (e.g., presence of suprainiac depressions and Breschet's sinuses). Although unquestionably Neandertals, the Vindija hominids have certain features in which they approach the morphology of early South-Central European H. sapiens sapiens more than chronologically earlier Neandertals from the area (e.g., Krapina, Subalyuk). First, the supraorbital tori exhibit a distinct pattern of absolute and relative decrease in both thickness and projec- tion in comparison with Krapina tori (Smith and Ranyard 1980 and table 3). In addition, the relatively greater diminution in the midorbital region reflects an incipient tendency toward the division of the torus into medial and lateral portions (the arcus superciliaris and trigonum supraorbitale respectively). In size and form, the Vindija G3 torus sample conforms to what one would expect of an intermediate between chronologically earlier Neandertals and early modern H. sapiens sapiens (fig. 7). Secondly, the symphyseal angles of all three specimens preserving this area are practically vertical (Vindija averages 870, Krapina 99.60, and Western European Neandertals 950), and there is a slight mental eminence on two of the three (fig. 6). Although these characteristics appear in some Western European Neandertal specimens, they are the exception rather .~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ri IG6T a FIG. 6.

Thirdly, nasal breadths (estimated on the assump- tion of bilateral symmetry) are very small for the two maxillae preserved, more than three standard deviations below the Western European Neandertal mean (see table 4). Both also have alveolar heights more than two and a half standard deviations below the Western' European Neandertal mean. However, while certain dimensions of the lower face exhibit significant degrees of reduction compared with those of most other Neandertals, others (e.g., prosthion-to-postcanine dis- tance) exceed the Neandertal average.7 Fourthly, there is some I It might be argued that some of these features are simply related to small body size. This appears unlikely (see Wolpoff et al. 1981) because some dimensions do not reduce. Furthermore, posterior tooth breadths at Vindija are essentially the same as at Krapina. Finally, though all five (only two of which are definitely adult) post- cranial specimens from Vindija are small, the same can be said for the Subalyuk and Krapina remains. . . 111 1. -Yap-Yi.. n:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I FIG. 7.

Finally, there is no indication of lambdoidal flattening or occipital bunning. It must be noted, however, that the occipitals and posterior parietals are represented by only fragmentary specimens, making determination of the presence or absence of bunning and/or lambdoidal flattening rather tenuous. The Vindija G3 Neandertals as a group give clear indications of morphological change in the direction of what is character- istic for early modern H. sapiens in this region. This makes them one of the most interesting and significant Upper Pleis- tocene hominid samples yet recovered. K&amp;NA Kftlna Cave, some 45 km north of Brno, was first recognized as an important Paleolithic and paleontological site in 1880 by H. Wankel, and further excavations were conducted during the latter 19th and early 20th centuries by Martin K'ii and Jan Knies, who recovered a large series of Magdalenian and Mous- terian artifacts (Valoch 1970). During World War II, the cave housed a munitions factory (Valoch 1967). In 1961, after reviewing its Middle Paleolithic industry, the Anthropos Insti- tute of the Moravian Museum in Brno began a major project at K&amp;lna (Valoch 1968, 1970; Valoch et al. 1970). As a result of these excavations, Kfilna now provides one of the best stratigraphic sequences from the Riss-Wiirm interglacial to the end of the Lower Wtirm stadial in Europe (Valoch et al. 1970), as well as an excellent sequence of Middle Paleolithic com- ponents. In 1965, a right maxillary fragment was found in situ in the Late Mousterian complex at Kfilna of the Lower Wtirm stadial (Jelfnek 1966, Valoch 1967), between 40,000 and 50,000 B.P. (elinek 1980, 1981). The specimen is clearly H. sapiens nean- derthalensis (Jelinek 1966, 1967a, 1969). Subsequently, a right parietal fragment and a few isolated teeth were recovered. The maxiUlary fragment is preserved from the midline to just behind M1 with the canine, both premolars, and Ml present. Jelinek ages the specimen at 14, which is a minimum estimate. The Kflna maxilla has a narrow nose (based on reconstruction of nasal breadth assuming bilateral symmetry) compared with those of Western Eiuropean Neandertals, but its alveolar height and prosthion-to-postcanine dimensions are at or above the Western European Neandertal means (table 4). Compared with the roughly contemporaneous Vindija maxillae, it is much larger in all dimensions except prosthion-to-postcanine. The posterior teeth are narrower (each more than two standard deviations) than the appropriate Krapina means, but the canine is slightly broader (see table 2). Also, there is a slight indication of a shallow canine fossa on the maxilla. The parietal exhibits curvature similar to that seen in Western European "classic" Neandertals and may represent the same individual as the maxilla (Jelinek 1980, 1981). 9ALA In 1961, a human frontal bone was found in gravel deposits of a sandbar in the VAh (Waag) River, near Sala in western Slovakia. Continued searching in the sandbar yielded remains of Pleistocene fauna, including a virtually complete steppe rhinoceros skull (Dicerorhinus hemitoechus), antler of the giant deer (Megaceros giganteus), and proboscidean remains. Sub- sequent fluorine tests support the contemporaneity of the fauna and the hominid specimen, suggesting an Upper Pleistocene age for the Sala frontal (Vlcek 1968, 1969). The presence of the rhinoceros excludes the cold phases of the Early and Lower Wtirm, but an interstadial during these periods and the Riss- Wtirm are possibilities (Vkek 1969). No cultural remains were recovered from the deposits. The Sala frontal is complete, well-preserved, and adult (Vlcek 1964a, 1967a, 1968, 1969; Jelinek 1969). Over the lateral portion of the right orbit is a healed lesion. The frontal squama is rounded in sagittal curvature and appears to be relatively higher than those of some Western European and Krapina Neandertals (Vlcek 1969:161-63). The interorbital area is broad and projected anteriorly, indicating absence of a nasal- root depression and presence of midfacial prognathism. The temporal lines are moderately developed. The most diagnostic and salient feature is the presence of a distinct supraorbital torus, which projects markedly. Projection dimensions are close to the corresponding Krapina means and larger than the Vindija means (table 3). The injury to the supraorbital region has resulted in atrophy and thinning of the right lateral torus, but even excluding this the thicknesses of the torus are reduced and approach the Vindija means more closely than the Krapina means (table 3). There is relatively greater midorbit thinning of the torus (on the nonpathological left side) than medially or laterally, and frontal sinuses are expansive and restricted to the torus. Though the gala frontal possesses some features which can be considered "transitional" or "progressive," its total morpho- logical pattern is unquestionably Neandertal. Vk6ek (1969) believes it to be related to the "transitional Neandertals" of the Near East (especially Zuttiyeh and Skh&amp;l V) because of its morphology and the reduction of the supraorbital torus. The specimen is considered female (Vlcek 1968, 1969; Jelinek 1969), I |~~~~ .9 FIG. 8.

SIPKA One of the earliest Neandertal discoveries was made at Sipka Cave in the karst region near Stramberg, northeastern Moravia. In 1880, Maska recovered a symphyseal segment of a subadult mandible from a Mousterian level (Maska 1882). Since this discovery came at the height of arguments concerning the pos- sible existence of a Neandertal phase of man, the Sipka jaw immediately became a subject of considerable interest. Those favoring the view that Neandertals represented a stage in human evolution (Maska, Wankel, Schaafhausen, Baume, de Quatrefages) argued that this was the mandible of an eight-to- ten-year-old Neandertal child. Virchow (1882) argued that it belonged to a modern adult with a pathological retention of incompletely developed, unerupted permanent teeth. Intense debate followed (see Jelinek 1965 and Vlcek 1969 for details), but, with the eventual demise of the pathological explanation of Neandertal morphology in general, Sipka was ultimately accepted as a Neandertal specimen (e.g., Hrdlicka 1930, Boule 1923, Vlcek 1958, Coon 1962, Boule and Vallois 1957). Maska's excavations at Sipka were extensive and well done for their time. However, questions remained until 1950 regard- ing the division of the strata and the exact portion of the Upper Pleistocene represented in the Sipka sequence. In that year, F. Prosek excavated some sediments not removed by Maska, and sedimentation/petrographic analysis was undertaken by Kukla (in Valoch 1965a). The profiles of Maska and Prosek cor- respond closely (Valoch 1965a) and together provide a rather precise picture of the stratigraphic sequence at Sipka. The most recent Wtirm-age strata contain Magdalenian arti- facts and correspond to the first Late Wiirm oscillation. The oldest appear to be Lower Wuirm and contain extensive remains of the cave bear, Ursus spelaeus (Musil 1965a). The human mandible comes from Level 9 (VIcek 1969:55, 58) and is asso- ciated with fauna said by Musil (1965a) to be characteristic of the Podhradem interstadial. The same conclusion is reached by Valoch (1965a: 17) on the basis of stratigraphic correlation. Also associated with the Sipka mandible is a lithic industry of essentially Mousterian character but containing slightly more than 14% of Upper Paleolithic elements (endscrapers, burins, and borers). Valoch, who analyzed this material using Bordes's French typological classification (Valoch 1965a), considers the industry a Sipka phase of the Central European Typical Mousterian (Valoch 1968).8 Unfortunately, there are a number of problems with the morphological assessment of the Sipka mandible. It consists of only the symphyseal region, the external (anterior) alveolus being largely missing or broken and distorted. Only the base of the symphysis remains intact externally. The internal (lingual) aspect of the symphysis, however, is completely preserved. Moreover, the specimen is a subadult (eight or nine years old, according to Vlcek 1969), and, as Jelinek (1965) notes, it is difficult to judge what the adult morphology would have been. Finally, the original was destroyed in the fire at Mikulov Castle in 1945. The breadths of the incisors, three of which are erupted and present, indicate some slight reduction compared with those of Krapina, Subalyuk, and Ochoz (table 2). The Sipka values lie approximately one standard deviation below the corresponding Krapina means. Several teeth are preserved in Smith: HOMINID EVOLUTION IN SOUTH-CENTRAL EUROPE their crypts on the right side (C, P3, P4), and these also appear small. All the teeth, however, are within the size range of both H. sapiens neanderthalensis and H. sapiens sapiens (Jelinek 1965, Smith 1976b), although the incisors are above the Predmosti range (Matiegka 1934) and slightly above the Early Upper Paleolithic means reported by Frayer (1978). Thickness and height of the Sipka symphysis are within one standard deviation below both the Vindija and Krapina (adult) means. On the ventral (lingual) aspect, the alveolar plane is not strongly angled, and the superior transverse torus is weakly developed. The external aspect of the symphysis appears somewhat receding (cf. Hrdlicka 1930), but there does seem to be some development of a subalveolar concavity below the incisor roots. Both Jelinek (1965, 1969) and Vlcek (1958, 1969) note that this contributes to the development of at least an incipient mental eminence, although they both see the alveolus projecting more anteriorly than the base of the mandible. Jelinek also finds the beginnings of a mental trigone. Finally, while it would probably be quite difficult to separate the Sipka mandible, on the basis of the morphology of the areas preserved, from an early H. sapiens sapiens sample, I concur with Jelinek (1965, 1969) and Vlcek (1969) that it is most reasonably considered late H. sapiens neanderthalensis. REMAINS OF HOMO SAPIENS SAPIENS MLADEC The Mladec caves are located in the karst of northern Central Moravia, beside the village of Mladec (Lautsch). The main cave was discovered in 1828 and originally named the Fiirst- Johanns-Hohle. During the first systematic archaeological excavations in it (1881-82), hominid skeletal remains (Mladec 1, 2, and 3 and other fragments) and archaeological material were recovered (Szombathy 1925). From the information pro- vided by Szombathy and a study of the stratigraphy of the remaining deposits in 1959-63 (by the Moravian Museum), it is known that these finds came from distinctive reddish-brown clayey sediments which constitute the fan of a talus cone formed by materials washed or thrown into the largest chimney of the main cave (Jelinek 1976). These deposits, which eventually closed off the chimney (Jelinek 1978), do not result from habi- tation of the cave. Similar depositional circumstances are com- mon for caves in the Moravian karst (e.g. Zlaty Ki'fn Cave [Prosek et al. 1952]). Later excavations in the same deposits of the main cave by Knies in 1903 provided more hominid re- mains (Mladec 4 and numerous smaller fragments) found with bone and lithic artifacts typical of the Aurignacian (Bayer 1922, Szombathy 1925). In addition, portions of a necklace consisting of drilled animal teeth were recovered (Szombathy 1925), Such items occur commonly in the Aurignacian and Pavlovian of Moravia (e.g., of Predmosti, Dolni Vestonice, Brno II). Of particular importance is the presence of numerous distinctive flat bone points (Mladec points), which are characteristic of early Aurignacian in this region (Jelinek 1978). More human skeletal remains (Mladec 5 and 6 and other fragments) were discovered in 1904 during quarrying at a smaller cave adjacent to the main cave (Szombathy 1925). According to Jelinek (1976, 1978), descriptions of the deposits which contained the human remains in this second cave indicate that they may have accumulated in the same manner as in the main cave. The archaeological material accompanying the hominids in this second cave is identical to that associated with the hominids in the main cave, particularly in the presence of Mladec points. The two deposits and their hominids are, therefore, considered to be contemporaneous. The Mladec hominid-bearing deposits are correlated with the Podhradem 8 This term was first suggested for this industry by Absolon (1933) on the basis of a typological analysis of the lithics. For him, however, it represented the "pre-Aurignacian." According to Vkek (1969), Absolon subsequently claimed that Moravia was not occupied during the Mousterian and that the Sipka mandible was Upper Paleolithic. Vol. 23 * No. 6 * December 1982 677</page><page sequence="12">interstadial (Jelinek 1969, 1976, 1978)9 on the basis of their similarity to deposits in the Podhradem cave and the presence of early Aurignacian cultural material. The Mladed fauna indi- cates a "mildly cold" climate (Szombathy 1925). The Mladec hominid remains are among the largest, oldest, and earliest-discovered Upper Paleolithic-associated skeletal samples in all of Europe. The material excavated by Szombathy in 1881 and 1882 is preserved at the Natural History Museum in Vienna (Mlade6 1, 2, 3, and other fragments), and the Mlade6 5 cranium is housed in the Moravian Museum (Brno). From the postcranial sample preserved in Vienna and the descriptions provided by Szombathy of some of the fragments destroyed in the 1945 fire already mentioned, considerable variation in size and robusticity is evident. The two best- preserved femoral diaphyses in Vienna are slender but exhibit well-developed muscle markings. The two most complete humeral fragments are also slender but have more gracile muscle markings. Fragments of other arm bones, however, are obviously from larger and more robust individuals. Addition- ally, there are at least three innominate fragments from Mladec in Vienna, one of which -is clearly female. Unfortunately, no pubic bones are preserved, and no axillary borders of scapulae are represented. Mladec femora are similar to later Upper Paleolithic femora and unlike those of Neandertals in their pronounced pilasters. The lengths of the better-preserved spec- imens indicate tall individuals. The Mlade6 cranial sample also exhibits considerable vari- ation due largely to sexual dimorphism. The total morpho- logical patterns of these cranial specimens are consistent with their classification as H. sapiens sapiens, a conclusion supported by multivariate analyses. The latter place the Mladec crania in an Upper Paleolithic group differentiated from recent Europeans but more similar to them than to Neandertals (e.g., Morant 1930; Stringer 1974, 1978). At the same time, these crania exhibit features distinctly reminiscent of Neandertal cranial morphology. The MladeZ 1 cranium is well preserved, although only four teeth remain (M1 and M2 on both sides). Breadth dimensions for these teeth are slightly below the corresponding early Upper Paleolithic means reported by Frayer (1978). Upper facial height is moderate in comparison with that of other early Upper Paleolithic specimens, and facial breadth is small. Nasal breadth is moderate, and shallow canine fossae are present. There is a shallow nasal-root depression, and the mid- face does not project to the degree characteristic of European Neandertals (see Wolpoff 1980a: 312-13). Alveolar prognathism, however, is diminished to a lesser extent. The supraorbital region is divided into a superciliary arch and a supraorbital trigone (i.e., the modern European supraorbital morphology). Thicknesses of the supraorbitals consistently exceed the early South-Central European Upper Paleolithic mean (Smith and Ranyard 1980), but projection (though unmeasurable) appears less pronounced. On the basis of the relative size of the supra- orbitals (compared with those of certain other Mlade6 speci- mens), small mastoids, and lack of marked development of other cranial superstructures (also compared with those of other MladeZ specimens), Mladec 1 appears to be female. The vault contour (see Szombathy 1925, Morant 1930) of Mlade6 1 conforms to a dolichocranic modern H. sapiens pat- tern. In the lambdoidal area, however, there is distinct flatten- ing associated with posterior projection of the occiput. The resulting structure is a type of occipital bun found rather com- monly in Upper Paleolithic crania, particularly early Central European specimens. Because it differs from the Neandertal occipital bun in a number of ways, this structure is referred to here as an occipital hemi-bun. In Upper Paleolithic-associated crania, the area of lambdoidal flattening does not extend laterally to the degree observed in Neandertals. This difference is due to the expansion of certain aspects of the posterior parietal area. Viewed from the rear, maximum breadth is high on the parietals (while in Neandertals it is low) and the overall contour is gabled. Viewed laterally (fig. 9), the posterior parietal contour is more vaulted dnd curved than in Neandertals. Furthermore, the height of the planum nuchale (measured from inion to opisthion) is decreased and the plane 'less hori- zontally oriented. Inion is equally obvious in both groups, but in the Upper Paleolithic hominids it tends to project somewhat inferiorly from the remainder of the superior nuchal line. In the later group, this line is generally accompanied by a distinct demarcation, often in the form of a slight torus, between the nuchal and occipital planes. In Neandertals, these structures tend to run essentially in a straight line from inion in the direc- tion of the lambdoidal suture (generally at the level of asterion). In the Upper Paleolithic specimens, the structures incline slightly superiorly as they extend laterallv from inion and tend to approach the lambdoidal suture somewhat above the level of asterion. The Mladec 2 calvarium has a rounder vault contour than Mladec 1 and lacks an occipital hemi-bun. The preserved part of the supraorbital area is identical to that of Mlade6 1 except. that it is less robust. This, along with its small mastoid pro- cesses, indicates that Mladec 2 is also female. Mladec crania 4, 5, and 6 are much more robust than Mlade6 1 and 2. Mladec 4 consists basically of the anterior half of a cranial vault; Mladec 5 is a virtually complete calvarium, lacking most of the base (and slightly distorted by the 1945 fire); and Mladec 6 preserves essentially the same areas as 5 except that the lateral supraorbital regions are missing. These three specimens are probably male and have long and relatively low vaults, lambdoidal flattening, occipital hemi-buns, ex- panded and robust nuchal areas, thick cranial vault bones, and massive supraorbitals. The supraorbital superstructures are basically modern (i.e., somewhat divided into superciliary arches and superorbital trigones) but, especially in Mladec 5 (fig. 10), closely approach the condition of a Neandertal supra- orbital torus (see table 3), particularly that of late Neandertal tori in South-Central Europe (Smith and Ranyard 1980; Wolpoff et al. 1981). Wolpoff (1980a: 311) notes that the cranial contour of Mladec 5 is similar to that of La Chapelle-aux- Saints except for a slightly higher forehead and less projecting occiput. Stringer (1978), however, finds the contours of Mladec FG9.TePvocrnu, laea_iw xiiigawl-eeoe ociia hemi-bun. ;,- - f &lt; 9 In 1922, the remains of five individuals (two adults and three children: Mladed 8, 9, 10) were discovered at the MladeE site. These remains were never studied scientifically and were destroyed in the fire of 1945. According to Jel!nek (1976), these specimens were supposedly from a level older than the deposits containing the other hominids and were reported to resemble "Homo primigenius" (Neandertals). We shall never know, as not even a single picture or drawing of these specimens is known to exist. 678 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="13">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - .. .....~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~........ .... ! ,11._i...1 FIG. 10.

Two partial maxillae are also preserved in Vienna. Both have wide and shallow anterior palates, broad noses, and shallow canine fossae. One has anterior (C, 12) and posterior (m', M2) tooth breadths slightly above Frayer's (1978) early Upper Paleolithic means, while the other's posterior breadths (M', M2, M3) are slightly smaller than Frayer's means. All teeth exhibit extensive occlusal and interproximal att'rition. The Upper Paleolithic-associated hominids from Mlade'c are early, extremely robust members of H. sapiens sapiens that retain (especially in males) certain features reminiscent of their Neandertal ancestry: the form and dimensions of the supraorbital superstructures, the relative s'ize of the nuchal plane, the presence of an occipital hemi-bun and lambdoidal flattening, and certain other aspects of facial morphology. These same features are also found in many other hominids associated with the Aurignacian and Gravettian in this portion of Europe. ZLATf' KUhN (KONEP'RUS) At a cave in Zlat9 Kfiii (Golden Horse) Hill in the Bohemian karst of Czechoslovakia, hominid specimens, Pleistocene fauna, and tools were found between 1950 and 1953 (Vlcek 1957a, 1967c).

The hominid specimens, Zlatf KMnU 1 and 2 (Vlcek in Oakley et al. 1971), are actually portions of a single calvarium, lacking most of its base. Metrically, it resembles Mladec 1, but it is in- termediate in robustness between Mladec 1 and 5. The Zlat9 Kfin calvarium exhibits a well-developed hemi-bun and a supra- orbital area divided into a superciliary arch and a supraorbital trigone. Thickness and projection values for this specimen are among the largest for South-Central European early modern specimens (Smith and Ranyard 1980). The face is represented by both zygomatics and a right maxilla. The zygomatics lack the columnar, pillar-like frontal processes characteristic of Neandertals. The maxilla has a narrow nose and weakly developed canine fossa. The teeth (C through M2) are heavily worn. Their breadths fall consistently within one standard deviation below Frayer's (1978) early Upper Paleolithic means. The Zlaty KMn mandible is robust and clearly of H. sapiens sapiens type. Its symphyseal angle is 810, and a distinct mental eminence and mental trigone are present. Though both M3's were lost antemortem, there was clearly no retromolar space. The teeth (I2 through M2 on the left, C through M2 on the right) are heavily worn and smaller than Frayer's means. A few fragments of vertebrae and ribs are preserved but are non- diagnostic. VINDIJA Two stratigraphically separate samples of hominids are asso- ciated with Upper Paleolithic industries in Vindija Cave. From Level G1 and Fd comes a sample of seven specimens: three isolated teeth from Fd, portions of a left parietal and a right mandibular ramus/posterior corpus from G1, and two isolated teeth also from G,. Level Fd contains Aurignacian cultural remains and is slightly younger than 27,000 B.P. (Wolpoff et al. 1981). Level GI yielded only one diagnostic artifact, a split-based bone point (from the top of the layer, slightly above the hominids), also indicating Aurignacian, and probably correlates with the Podhradem interstadial (Malez et al. 1980, Wolpoff et al. 1981). The isolated teeth are closer in size (breadth) to the Krapina than to the early Upper Paleolithic sample (table 2). Morpho- logically, they could be accommodated in either a late Nean- dertal or an early modern group (Wolpoff et al. 1981). The mandibular fragment is small and has a low ramus height compared with Neandertals (Wolpoff et al. 1981). There is a small retromolar space, and the mandibular foramen area is horizontal-oval in form. The parietal fragment is nondiagnostic. There is no significant difference between these Aurignacian- associated specimens from Vindija and the late Mousterian- associated material from Level G3. This suggests that there is not necessarily a distinct morphological break in hominid forms corresponding' to the Mousterian-early Upper Paleo- lithic dichotomy. Similar continuity has been noted in Western Europe (Leveque and Vandermeersch 1980, 1981; ApSimon 1980). However, the Vindija sample is small, and only one specimen preserves diagnostic anatomical regions. More data are needed to establish the morphological affinities of the G1 hominids. The 34 hominid specimens from Level D are associated with a Gravettian industry (Malez et al. 1980). The morphology of these specimens conforms entirely to the total morphological pattern of H. sapiens sapiens and is consistent with their age. Cranial material is fragmentary and exhibits modern H. sapiens supraorbital morphology and cranial contours. The single mandible has a distinctive mental eminence and trigone, and Vol. 23 No. 6 * December 1982 679</page><page sequence="14">the postcrania (mostly represented by femoral diaphyses) are modern. VELIKA PECINA Velika Pec'ina is a cave on the steep slopes of Ravna Gora in the Hrvatsko Zagorje (Yugoslavia). Investigation of the Pleis- tocene strata in the cave began soon after World War II, and systematic excavations were undertaken particularly in the early 1960s (Malez 1967, 1974). The deposits, 10 m thick, extend from possibly the late Riss-Wurm through the end of the Wiirm and have yielded an extensive sample of fauna and artifacts. Mousterian, Aurignacian, and Gravettian as- semblages are present (Malez 1967, 1974), and several radio- carbon dates are associated with the latter two (table 1). The hominid specimen is from Stratum j, which correlates either with the late Podhradem interstadial or (most likely) with the basal Middle Wurm stadial, consistent with an age of more than 34,000 years. (Stratum i, immediately above, has yielded a radiocarbon date of 33,850 + 520 B.P. [table 1].) The assemblage from Stratum j (see Malez 1967, 1974) probably represents an early phase of the Aurignacian. This is the earliest Upper Paleolithic hominid specimen in South-Central Europe associated this closely with a radiocarbon date. The specimen consists of the right half of an adult frontal bone (Smith 1976a; Malez 1978b, c). Morphologically, it falls clearly within the early H. sapiens sapiens group. This is particularly evident in the morphology of the supraorbital area. The dimensions of the supraorbital projections and the overall dimensions of the specimen are rather small (Smith 1976a; Smith and Ranyard 1980) and suggest a female. BRNO In the immediate vicinity of the city of Brno, Moravia, three hominid specimens were recovered between 1885 and 1927. Brno 1 was discovered in 1885 at Cerveny Kopec (Red Hill) and consists of a calotte, a partial maxilla, and fragmentary postcranial elements (Makowsky 1888).10 No direct associations of this specimen with fauna or an archaeological assemblage were made at the time of excavation, but later excavations revealed a single cultural horizon at the site. The tools are Aurignacian-like, and Jelinek (personal communication) be- lieves that the level dates to the later Podhradem interstadial. Morphologically, the calotte (lacking most of the occipital and nuchal planes) is relatively gracile. Supraorbital development is similar to that of Velika Pecina except that it exhibits more projection. Vault contours are rounded. The maxilla has a deep palate, a narrow nose, moderate anterior alveolar height, and a shallow canine fossa. The teeth are moderate in size, with breadths below Frayer's (1978) early Upper Paleolithic means. Wear on the teeth is moderate to heavy. Brno 2 was discovered accidentally in Francouzska ulice in the center of Brno in 1891. Subsequent excavation (Makowsky 1892) revealed that Brno 2 was a burial, covered with mammoth tusks and red ochre. The grave contained several disks of limestone, mammoth bones, and ivory, all with holes drilled in them, a stylized male figure of ivory 25 cm in height, and several hundred perforated Dentaliun shells. All this suggests a Pavlovian cultural association for this specimen (Jelinek 1957, 1976; Valoch 1968). The specimen consists of a calvarium, a right zygomatic, a partial left mandible, a partial right maxilla, and a few fragmentary ppstcranial elements (Jelinek et al. 1959). The calvarium, exceeded only by Mladec 5 and 6 in size and robusticity, is unquestionably male and has very large mastoids, well-developed supramastoid ridges, a rugose nuchal plane, and a pronounced occipital hemi-bun. Cranial contours resemble those of the Mladec and Predmosti crania (Morant 1930, Stringer 1978). Supraorbitals are very well developed and sec- ond only to those of Mladec 5 in overall size and archaic appear- ance (Smith and Ranyard 1980). The zygomatic is modern in form in that the frontal process lacks the columnar morphology characteristic of Neandertals. The mandible exhibits a worn dentition and a mental eminence. There was possibly a very small retromolar space. Brno 2 served as the basis for the so- called Briinn race (Makowsky 1892) or Brno type (Vlcek 1967b) of early H. sapiens sapiens. Brno 3, an isolated burial covered with red ochre, was dis- covered in 1927 during the digging of a foundation in Zabo- vresky (Absolon 1929). No archaeological industry or faunal remains were associated with the specimen, but Jelinek (1960 and personal communication) feels it is probably Upper Paleo- lithic in age and roughly contemporary with Dolni Vestonice. A cranium and most of the postcranium were recovered but were destroyed by the 1945 fire. The cranium, described by Matiegka (1929), was smaller and much more gracile than Brno 2 and probably female. The supraorbital projections were weak and similar in size and form to those of Dolni Vestonice 3. The cranial contours were rounded, with little indication of lambdoidal flattening. The face was gracile, with a narrow nose and canine fossae. PREDMOSTI The largest series of human remains from the Upper Paleolithic in Central Europe was recovered from the open-air site of Predmosti in northeastern Moravia. The first excavation of the Predmosti site was undertaken by J. Wankel in 1880, but finds were documented from the locality as early as 1571 (Matiegka 1934:12). Wankel recovered the first hominid specimen, a right mandible (Pfedmosti 21), in 1884, lying under a mam- moth femur. Maska began investigations here in 1882 and in 1894 discovered the communal grave in Chromecek's Garden (Matiegka 1934, Absolon and Klima 1978), a 4 m X 2.5 m elliptical pit containing the remains of 18 individuals (Predmost'i 1-18) of various ages and both sexes, most with their heads oriented to the north. The grave was covered with limestone slabs and mammoth bones (principally scapulae), a burial style characteristic of the Pavlovian in this region (Jelinek 1969). Two specimens (Predmosti 19 and 20) were found out- side the grave by Maska but possibly belong with the hominids in it (Matiegka 1934). Further excavations by Maska, Kriz (in 1895), and Absolon (in 1928) yielded other hominid specimens. In all, some 29 individuals were recovered. Of these, some are represented by only one or two skeletal elements and could be parts of other specimens. However, at least 20 individuals are definitely represented. If one accepts 29 individuals, they break down into the following age/sex cate- gories (see Matiegka 1934): 15 subadults, ranging from a few months (e.g., Predmosti lI, 12, 13) to midteens (e.g., Predmost'i 5, 7) in age; 6 adult males (Predmosti 1, 3, 9, 14, 18, 23); 2 to 4 adult females (Predmosti 4, 10, 19?, 26?); and 4 unsexed adult specimens. The Predmosti hominids were destroyed in 1945 at Mikulov Castle, although a few distorted fragments were recovered from the rubble. Fortunately, they had been carefully described in two monographs (Matiegka 1934, 1938) and other works (Absolon 1929, Morant 1930). The excavations by Wankel, Maska, Krlz, and Absolon and also by Knies recovered a considerable amount of cultural material in addition to the hominid specimens (Zotz and Freund 1951, Absolon and Klima 1978). The main cultural level yielded several thousand lithic artifacts, a rich bone and antler industry, and various art and decorative objects. The main cultural level is contemporary with the communal grave (Absolon and Klima 1978) and is Pavlovian. Although numer- 10 As Matiegka (1934:83) points out, the numbering of the Brno crania is often confused. The Cerveny Kopec specimen is correctly Brno 1 and was so designated by Makowsky. The Francouzska ulice specimen is correctly Brno 2 but is often described as Brno 1 (see Morant 1930). 680 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="15">ous mammalian species were recovered from this component, the predominance of mammoth remains leaves little doubt that the mammoth was the primary prey of these hunters. Recent excavations by Klima have provided radiocarbon dates for this level which conclusively establish that Predmost'i is essen- tially the same age as Dolni Vestonice/Pavlov. Earlier cultural levels at Pfedmosti contain Aurignacian and Mousterian assemblages without hominid remains. A detailed discussion of the stratigraphy of the site, based on Absolon's excavations before World War II as well as recent work by Klima, is to be found in Absolon and Klima (1978). The adult crania from Pfedmosti show morphological and metric variability, but no specimen has a total morphological pattern that would justify any classification other than H. sapiens sapiens. Cranial contours and overall shape conform to the early modern pattern (see Matiegka 1934, Morant 1930, Stringer 1974, Jel'inek 1969), although certain specimens (e.g., Predmosti 3, 9,18) have relatively low cranial vaults and/or foreheads. Predmosti 3 has its maximum width low on the temporals, indicating an exceptionally wide posterior cranial base. The vault morphology is quite robust, with strong indi- cations of muscle attachments for both males and females. Predmosti males, however, exhibit much more pronounced supraorbital features and mastoid processes than females. Males show more pronounced development of an occipital hemi-bun (e.g., Predmosti 1, 3, 9) and a more robust nuchal plane. Female crania are characterized by hemi-buns (Predmosti 4, 10) smaller than those of the males. Interestingly, hemi-buns can already be seen in several of th'e subadult specimens at Pfed- mosti (e.g., 2, 7). Metrically, the Pfedmost'i males and females exhibit the same degree of sexual dimorphism as the specimens from M]adec, Brno, and Dolni Vestonice/Pavlov. Predmosti supraorbitals are typical of those of early South- Central European Upper Paleolithic hominids (Smith and Ranyard 1980). Thev are thick and project markedly anteriorly but are clearly divided into superciliary arches and supra- orbital trigones. Males such as PPedmosti 3 and 18 exhibit the greatest degree of supraorbital development, but females possess the same morphological pattern (though reduced in size and robusticity). Lower faces of the Predmosti hominids are robust but modern in form. Canine fossae are present, noses relatively narrow and high, distinct nasal-root depressions observable, and prognathism moderate (see Wolpoff 1980a: 313). Mandibles have mental eminences and trigones, although some are only weakly developed (Jelinek 1969). Moderate prognathism is further indicated by small retromolar spaces in certain man- dibles (Predmost'i 3, 1), while the ramus arises in the distal half of the third molar in others. Mean values for tooth breadths all fall very close to the corresponding means given by Frayer (1978) for the early Upper Paleolithic in Europe. The teeth, particularly the anteriors, are heavily worn. Postcranial remains (Matiegka 1938) exhibit considerable variation. Interestingly, little of the variation results from sexual dimorphism. In fact, neither the European Neandertal nor the Upper Paleolithic sample is characterized by marked postcranial sexual dimorphism (Trinkaus 1980). Adult stature, according to Matiegka (1938:68-69), averaged 66.5 or 64.8 in., depending on the techniques employed. Wolpoff (1980a:341) computes averages of 64 and 61 in. respectively for male and female stature at Predmosti. Predmosti postcrania exhibit well-developed muscle markings and marked robustness. Joint surfaces are relatively reduced compared with those of Nean- dertals. Brachial and crural indices (Matiegka 1938:70) show that the limbs of Predmosti hominids, like those of other Upper Paleolithic hominids, are relatively more elongated in their distal elements, unlike those of Neandertals (Trinkaus, personal communication). Pubic morphology is modern. Trinkaus (1977) reports that all Predmosti scapulae preserving the axillary border exhibit the bisulcate or Chancelade pattern. Smith: HOMINID EVOLUTION IN SOUTH-CENTRAL EUROPE However, Matiegka (1938:35) describes Pfedmosti 14 (right and left) as exhibiting dorsal sulci (Neandertal pattern), and his illustrations (pl. 4) appear to support this. In sum, the Predmosti hominids fit nicely into the population of early Upper Paleolithic hominids in this area of Central Europe. They are robust but clearly H. sapiens sapiens. Like many other hominid specimens associated with the Upper Paleolithic, they retain certain features reminiscent of Nean- dertal ancestry. DOLNI VESTONICE/PAVLOV The mammoth-hunter occupation site of Dolni Vestonice (Unter Wisternitz), at the base of the Pav]ovske Vrchy (Pav- lovian Hills) in the Mikulov district of Moravia, was first excavated in 1924 (Absolon 1938). Discoveries of fossil mam- moth remains are mentioned from this area as early as the 17th century, and stone tools were recovered from the site in the latter 19th century (Kli ma 1963). On the basis of collections made at Dolni Vestonice in the early 1920s, J. Bayer concluded as early as 1924 that it was a very important Upper Paleolithic site. Excavations have been conducted at various times since under the direction of a number of scholars (Klima 1963:15-38). The site is on a loess-covered terrace of the Dyje River and consists of the traces of several tentlike huts, a large accumula- tion of mammoth bones, and a large central fireplace. The largest "hut" measured some 9 X 15 m and contained numer- ous artifacts as well as five hearths. Smaller huts generally contained two hearths. Stone and bone tools, decorative items (various types of beads and pendants), and clay figurines were recovered (Kl'ima 1963). Of particular interest are a fired clay "Venus" (recovered from the central fireplace) and other "schematic" anthropomorphic figures. Several of the clay figurines were found in a hut located a few meters from the rest of the settlement. In this small (6 m in diameter) hut were a central oven and over 2,000 lumps of clay, some formed into the heads and bodies of animals (Kli ma 1963). A small sculp- tured clay head (found in 1936 [Absolon 1938]) and a human face engraved on a small piece of mammoth ivory (discovered in 1948 [Klima 1962, 1963]) exhibit asymmetry, with the fea- tures on the left side appearing to droop considerably (see Klima 1963:194). The two occupational phases identified are correlated with the early Upper Wuirm stadial and Stillfried B interstadial respectively (Kli ma 1963:52-53; Musil and Valoch 1966), and radiocarbon dates are available (table 1). The stratigraphic and chronometric ages and cultural remains indi- cate that Dolni Vestonice belongs to the Pavlovian (Klima 1963; Valoch 1968; Jelinek 1969, 1976). Pavlov lies less than a kilometer from Dolni Vestonice and like it is an open site deposited in loess (Klima 1955, 1959a, b). The archaeological remains closely resemble those from Dolni Vestonice and include animal and anthropomorphic figurines, decorative items, hut floors, and lithic and bone industries. The site corresponds to the early Upper Wuirm stadial (Klima 1955) and has yielded two radiocarbon dates (table 1). The first hominid specimen was discovered at Dolni Vestonice in 1925, and ten specimens were recovered between 1925 and 1951 (see VIcek in Oakley et al. 1971). The most complete specimen, Dolni Vestonice 3, was excavated in 1949 from a pit in the settlement covered by two mammoth scapulae (Klima 1963). This specimen has been described in great detail by Jelinek (1954), but the other specimens are described only partially or not at all. Dolni Vestonice 1 and 2 are male and female calvaria (Absolon 1938, Maly 1939) of uncertain con- text. All but Dolni Vestonice 3, 9, and 10 (the latter two being isolated teeth) were discovered prior to 1934 and destroyed in 1945. At Pavlov, a male was recovered between 1954 and 1957 Vol. 23 * No. 6 * December 1982 681</page><page sequence="16">from a burial pit covered with a mammoth scapula and other bones (Klima 1959a). Fragmentary gnathic and dental remains of other individuals were recovered in 1957. The Pavlov male is represented by a very robust cranial vault, parts of the face, and a partial postcranial specimen (Vlcek 1961a, b; Jelinek 1969, 1976). Cranial contours are clearly modern, and an occipital hemi-bun is present (see fig. 9). The supraorbitals are well-developed and, like those of several other specimens (e.g., Mladec 5, Brno 2), approach the condi- tion seen in late South-Central European Neandertals (Smith and Ranyard 1980). While the preserved parts of the face are robust, the nose appears to have been narrow, and the zygo- matic conforms to the modern pattern. The mandible is also robust but exhibits a distinct mental eminence and trigone. There is a small retromolar space. The teeth are heavily worn and tend to fall slightly above Frayer's (1978) means for early Upper Paleolithic tooth breadths. Dolni Vestonice 3 is a virtually complete skeleton, with the postcranium still en bloc. Jelinek (1954; see also 1969, 1976) has provided the definitive description of the specimen. It is a female H. sapiens sapiens, but certain archaic features (e.g., a small occipital hemi-bun) are observable. Supraorbitals are similar in form and extent of development to those of other early Upper Paleolithic females (e.g., Predmost'i 4, Velika Pecina), and deformation is evident on the left side of the facial skeleton. This was perhaps caused by paralysis of the muscu- lature in this region due to nerve damage and results in an asymmetrical face. The left side of the face would certainly have drooped, and effects of this condition (extreme arthritic deformation) are seen in the pathological nature of the left temporomandibular joint. The sculptured and engraved faces mentioned earlier show similar distortions and may be repre- sentations of the person whose remains are known as Dolni Vestonice 3 (Kli ma 1962). OTHERS Although no diagnostic hominid remains have been associated with the Szeletian, two mandibular molars from Silicka Brezova (Vlcek 1957b) and one from Palffy (both in Czecho- slovakia) are suggested to be from Szeletian levels. Unfor- tunately, they yield no useful information. Other Upper Paleolithic specimens from this region were among the earliest such discoveries made. Some of these (e.g., Mladec, Predmost'i, Brno 1 and 2) have already been discussed. Upper Paleolithic hominid specimens were also recovered at Sv. Prokop (Czechoslovakia) in 1887 (Vlcek 1951), Balla (Hungary) in 1909 and 1911 (Bartucz et al. 1940), Palffy (Czechoslovakia) in 1913, and Miesslingstal (Austria) in 1914 (Bayer 1927). Two important Upper Paleolithic archaeological sites, Willendorf in Austria (Felgenhauer 1959) and Istallo'sko' in Hungary (Vertes 1961), have yielded hominid specimens. The Istallo'sko' specimen, dated at about 30,000 B.P., is the germ of a mandibular molar. From the Gravettian horizon (Level 9) of Willendorf comes a basal symphyseal fragment of a mandible and a femoral diaphysis. The former is characterized by a mental eminence, while the rather gracile femur exhibits a well-developed pilaster. Both would appear to be modern H. sapiens. The cave of Veternica in the Medvednica (northwestern Croatia) has produced Upper Pleistocene remains (Malez 1965) including a hominid calvarium. It was formerly said to come from the Mousterian levels (Coon 1962, Skerlj 1958) and inferred to be contemporary with the Krapina Neandertals. Reinvestigation of the stratigraphy indicates that this speci- men, which is dolichocranic but clearly H. sapiens sapiens (Smith 1976a, 1977), comes either from the Aurignacian levels (Malez 1978b, c) or from an even more recent stratum. Additional Aurignacian-associated specimens include the facial skeleton from Svitavka in Czechoslovakia, which is very similar to Dolni Vestonice 3 and Brno 3 (Vlcek 1967c), and the Cioclovina calotte, which exhibits a slight occipital hemi-bun and is similar to the Predmosti crania (Necrasov and Cristescu 1965). Finally, very fragmentary, undescribed hominid remains have been reported from Layer 11 at Baco Kiro in Bulgaria (Kozlow- ski 1979:81). Their fragmentary condition may preclude accu- rate anatomical assessment, but Kozlowski reports that they are primitive modern H. sapiens. Since these remains are possibly associated with a date of &gt;43,000 B.P., a detailed morphological study may establish them as the earliest chrono- metrically dated modern H. sapiens specimens from Europe. EVOLUTIONARY PATTERNS Neandertal remains from South-Central Europe can be divided into two temporal samples. The early sample consists of the remains from Krapina, Ganovce, Ochoz, and probably Subalyuk. The time span represented extends from the Riss- Wiirm through the Early Wiirm stadial. The late sample comprises the specimens from Vindija Level G3 and Ku'lna (Lower Wiirm stadial) and from Sipka (Podhradem). The Sala frontal fits best in the later group on morphological grounds, but it could date to an earlier part of the Upper Pleistocene. The early Neandertals from this region exhibit as a group all the characteristic morphological features of H. sapiens neander- thalensis, and although many have often been considered more "progressive" or more "generalized" in their expression of Neandertal anatomical characteristics than Western European "classic" Neandertals there is no feature or complex of features that supports this. Where cranial, dental, and postcranial comparisons are possible, the early South-Central European Neandertals exhibit the same morphological pattern as their Western European contemporaries. For example, Western and early South-Central European Neandertal samples exhibit identical patterns of supraorbital torus and frontal sinus form, robust upper faces with wide interorbital and columnar lateral orbital margins, absence of canine fossae, inflated maxillary sinuses, buttressed zygomata, mastoid processes which generally do not project below the occipitomastoid crest, broad occipitals with robust nuchal planes, relatively low cranial vaults with receding foreheads, long and broad cranial vaults, high and broad anterior alveolar regions, mandibular symphyses which recede from alveolus to base, absence of mental eminences, presence of retromolar spaces, large and heavily worn anterior teeth, and various diagnostic features of the postcranium (e.g., indications of robust and barrel-shaped thorax, elongated and thinned superior pubic rami, relative epiphyseal and articular surface expansion in long bones, and nonmodern scapular axillary border patterns). The extent of similarity in certain other characteristics be- tween Western and South-Central European Neandertals is more difficult to evaluate, usually because of the fragmentary condition of most of the remains in the later group. Lambdoidal flattening and occipital bunning are characteristic of Western European Neandertals but difficult to document in South- Central Europe because no adult specimen preserves an intact posterior cranial vault. Two juvenile specimens (Subalyuk and Krapina B) do preserve the pertinent area and exhibit at least incipient expression of both features. Furthermore, the contour of the Ganovce endocast also indicates the presence of both features. Midfacial prognathism, another characteristic feature of Western European Neandertals, is difficult to identify in South-Central Europe because no adult specimen preserves a complete face. However, the absence of a nasal-root depression and the midsagittal contour of the upper face in the most corn- 682 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="17">plete face, Krapina C, clearly denotes the presence of midfacial prognathism (see fig. 3). The same features are also evident in Krapina E, and nasal-root depressions are absent in the other Krapina specimens that preserve the relevant areas. Further- more, the contour of the Subalyuk juvenile nasal bone also indicates midfacial prognathism. The only systematic difference which appears to exist be- tween Western and early South-Central European Neandertals is one of average body size. The postcranial remains from Krapina and Subalyuk suggest that the South-Central Euro- pean Neandertals were smaller than the Western European forms; however, this may be due to the apparent overabundance of subadult material represented in the Krapina sample. The late Neandertal sample from South-Central Europe has basically the same morphological pattern as the early sample but exhibits a number of features in which it approaches the early modern H. sapiens condition to a consistently greater extent than the early group does. This fact, pointed out re- peatedly by Central European scholars (e.g., Jelinek 1969; VIcek 1958, 1964b, 1969) on the basis of the rather sparse mate- rial from Sipka, Ku'lna, and Sala, has been confirmed by the discovery of the Vindija hominids. For example, the Vindija supraorbital tori exhibit both metric diminution (see table 3) and certain morphological changes from the earlier Krapina (Smith and Ranyard 1980, Wolpoff et al. 1981), including an increase in midorbit reduction that can be considered an incip- ient stage in the emergence of distinct supraorbital trigone and superciliary arch segments. The Sala torus conforms to the Vindija pattern. Mandibular remains from Vindija exhibit (as a group) relatively vertical symphyses (all less than 900), and two of the Vindija specimens, as well as Sipka, give indications of incipient mental eminences and trigones. The late group also shows reduction in certain significant facial characteristics. For example, the Kfulna and both Vindija maxillae exhibit narrow noses compared with the Western European sample. Further- more, the Vindija specimens (but not Kfilna) have shallow palates and reduced alveolar heights (table 4). Also, the Ku'lna specimen and perhaps the Vindija ones possess shallow canine fossae. Several other indications of change in the direction of early modern H. sapiens are present but less certain because of inadequacies of the late Neandertal sample (e.g., fragmentation and/or unreliably small sample sizes). Both the Sala and certain Vindija frontals appear to have had less receding frontal squama than the Krapina or Western European Neandertal samples (see Wolpoff et al. 1981, Vlcek 1969), and one Vindija specimen suggests that the extent of midfacial prognathism is less than in other European Neandertals (see Wolpoff et al. 1981 for details). Finally, there is some suggestion of size reduction in the anterior (but not so much in the posterior) dentition between early and late Neandertals in South-Central Europe (see table 2). The early modern H. sapiens (early Upper Paleolithic) sample from South-Central Europe exhibits several character- istics that indicate a close connection with late South-Central European Neandertals and suggest an intermediate position between Neandertals and later European modern hominid populations. For example, the supraorbital superstructures, although modern in form, are more salient and robust than in later H. sapiens sapiens populations. Furthermore, the division between the supraorbital trigone and superciliary arch is not always as distinct, and some specimens, such as Mladec 5 (fig. 10), almost exhibit a supraorbital torus. It has been sug- gested (Smith and Ranyard 1980) that the supraorbital region in South-Central European hominids represents a morphological continuum from early Neandertals through late Neandertals to early modern H. sapien,s (see fig. 7 and table 4). Also, hominids associated with the early Upper Paleolithic in Europe are intermediate in tooth size between Wurm Neandertals and later Upper Paleolithic specimens (Frayer 1978, Smith 1976b), con- Smith: HOMINID EVOLUTION IN SOUTH-CENTRAL EUROPE tributing to a distinct pattern of dental reduction traceable from Riss-Wuirm Neandertals through Mesolithic and Neo- lithic Europeans (Brace 1979a, Frayer 1978). Noses (especially at Mladec) tend to be only slightly narrower than those of late South-Central European Neandertals, and canine fossae are not extensively more excavated. Prognathism and facial robustness and rugosity are generally greater in early modern H. sapiens than in later European Upper Paleolithic popula- tions. Occipital hemi-buns are common in the early Upper Paleolithic sample and much less frequent in later European populations. Although these and other features indicate considerable morphological similarity between early Upper Paleolithic and late Neandertal specimens from South-Central Europe, the early Upper Paleolithic hominid total morphological pattern is clearly H. sapiens sapiens. No specimen, not even Mladec 5 or 6, possesses a complex of features that would warrant classi- fication as Neandertal. Stringer (1974, 1978) has illustrated this by means of multivariate analysis of the pertinent material (see also Brauer 1980, Trinkaus and Howells 1979). Multi- variate evidence has reinforced the idea of a qualitative dif- ference between Neandertal and early modern H. sapiens morphology, an idea which has its roots in earlier replacement concepts (Boule 1923). However, neither Stringer's nor Brauer's analyses can include the late Neandertal remains from South-Central Europe, because of their fragmentary condition. If one assumes that overall vault and facial form had evolved in this group to the level suggested by the observable ana- tomical features, then the level of distinction between Nean- dertals and early modern H. sapiens indicated by methodologies such as Stringer's and Brauer's may not be nearly so marked. Despite difference in overall craniofacial form, the high fre- quency with which Neandertal-reminiscent features are found in the early modern sample from South-Central Europe and the documented changes from early to late South-Central European Neandertal morphology in the direction of the early modern pattern provide enough suggestion of a morphological continu- um to require some explanation. There would appear to be three possible explanations11: (1) an in situ transition between Neandertals and modern humans in this area of Europe, without any significant outside influence; (2) a replacement of Neandertals by an influx of fully modern H. sapiens into Europe, with some assimilation of Neandertal genes into the invaders' gene pool; and (3) a transition brought about pri- marily as a result of gene flow, with "progressive" genes being introduced into Europe but no significant influx of modern people themselves. Available evidence provides little support for the second possibility (Spencer and Smith 1981). In order for a fully modern H. sapiens group to have moved into Europe and replaced or hybridized with the indigenous Neandertals, modern H. sapiens would have had to be present in an adjacent region earlier than the appearance of modern Europeans. The area which is generally considered to be the source of modern Europeans is the Near East, and the hominid samples from Skhuil and Qafzeh have been widely cited as evidence of the early emergence of essentially modern populations in this region (Vandermeersch 1981a). Recent archaeological and faunal information indicates, however, that the Skhuil hominid sample is not contemporary with Tabuin Level C, as was previously thought, but more recent (Jelinek 1982; see also 11 These exclude the suggestion that a completely separate lineage existed contemporaneously with the Neandertals in Europe and ultimately resulted in H. sapiens sapiens. Although some French paleoanthropologists hold onto variations of this idea, there would appear to be little if any definitive evidence to support it. Vol. 23 * No. 6 * December 1982 683</page><page sequence="18">Smith 1977). Tabuin is now dated to approximately 50,000 B.P. (Jelinek 1982), and Skhuil is estimated to be perhaps 10,000 years more recent (cf. Higgs 1961, Higgs and Brothwell 1961). The same analysis of Middle Paleolithic lithics in the Near East suggests that Qafzeh is roughly contemporary with Skhiil (Jelinek 1982), and contemporaneity is also supported morpho- logically (Wolpoff 1980a). On the basis of his geological analysis, Farrand (1979) prefers an earlier age estimation for the Qafzeh hominids, but his data are also consistent with 30,000-40,000 B.P. age. If a date of 35,000-40,000 B.P. is correct, the Skhuil/Qafzeh hominids are not significantly earlier (if at all) than earliest modern H. sapiens in South-Central Europe and so cannot constitute a credible ancestral "population" for the latter group. However, should it be demonstrated that the Skhuil/ Qafzeh hominids are older than ca. 40,000 B.P., the replace- ment hypothesis (in some form) would be more difficult to reject. Southern Africa has also been suggested as an area in which modern H. sapiens arose at a relatively early date. Remains of modern H. sapiens from Border Cave (South Africa) and the Omo-Kibish Formation (Ethiopia) are claimed to be in excess of 100,000 years old (Day 1969; Beaumont et al. 1978; Beaumont 1980; Rightmire 1979, 1981), and very fragmentary remains from Klasies River Mouth Cave 1 are more than 65,000 years old (Rightmire 1981). However, although the dating of all three sites appears sound, the contexts of the hominid remains at the first two are open to considerable question, and the Klasies specimens are so fragmentary that an accurate assessment of their morphology may not be pos- 3ible (they have yet to be described in detail). Even if the ages ,or these specimens are accurate, their morphology is con- siderably different from that of early modern Europeans (see Wolpoff 1980a), making it unlikely that modern Europeans represent an actual migration from Southern Africa. The present state of the art in paleoanthropology does not allow a definite choice between the other two possible expla- nations for the transition, because existing paleontological models are inadequate to deal effectively with gene flow (see Weiss and Maruyama 1976). It is impossible at this point to judge what effect gene flow (without major population replace- ment) may have had on the transition from Neandertals to modern H. sapiens in South-Central Europe. Certainly, there were no geographical barriers to populational contact between South-Central Europe and any adjacent region, and it is possible that gene flow played a major role. On the basis of existing data, however, there is no a priori reason that the transition in South-Central Europe need have been based on the influx of "progressive" alleles any more than the transitions in other regions were based on the influx of "progressive" alleles from South-Central Europe. On the other hand, if the presence of modern H. sapiens is unequivocally established in Southern Africa at 60,000+ years and in Western Asia at 40,000+ years, a clinal pattern emerges relative to the earliest appearance of anatomically modern humans. This pattern is continued in Europe, with modern H. sapiens being earlier in Central than in Western Europe. Such a clinal pattern, if ultimately established, is much more likely to be the result of gene flow than of large- scale population movement and replacement because the ob- served regional differences in modern H. sapiens morphology and the existence of a morphological continuum in several areas are difficult to incorporate into a strict replacementist explanation. Whatever the importance of gene flow, the morphological continuum in Upper Pleistocene South-Central European hominids indicates some degree of genetic continuity between H. sapiens neandertkalensis and H. sapiens sapiens in this region of Europe, and on the basis of existing information the simplest and best explanation for this would seem to be that the transition was primarily the result of an indigenous process. RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER AREAS OF EUROPE NORTH-CENTRAL EUROPE Neandertal remains in North-Central Europe (Germany east of the Rhine and Poland) are known from the localities of Taubach and Ehringsdorf near Weimar, the Neander Valley near Dusseldorf, Salzgitter-Lebenstedt in central Germany, and possibly Wildscheuer (see Knussmann 1967). None of these specimens exhibit any such pattern of "progressive" features as is found in the late South-Central European sample, and morphologically all would appear to belong in the early South- Central and Western European category (see Wolpoff 1980a for discussions of the Ehringsdorf and Neander Valley material). However, none of these specimens are demonstrably late (i.e., Lower Wurm stadial) in date. Ehringsdorf and Taubach are Riss-Wiirm in age, and Salzgitter-Lebenstedt dates to the Early Wuirm (table 1). The others are undated. Although North-Central Europe has yielded numerous Upper Paleolithic sites with hominid remains, most are rather late (see Oakley, Campbell, and Molleson 1971). Only the Aurignacian-associated remains from Stetten (Vogelherd Cave) (Gieseler 1937, 1941) and the recently discovered material from Paderborn (Henke and Protsch 1978) and Hahn6fersand (Brauer 1980) seem to be early Upper Paleolithic specimens.12 The Stetten calvaria and the Paderborn calvarium (the latter dated to ca. 26,000 B.P. by amino-acid racemization and 27,400 ? 600 B.P. by radiocarbon dating of residual bone col- lagen [see Henke and Protsch 1978]) are robust but certainly modern. They do not appear to exhibit strong indications of Neandertal-reminiscent features. The various univariate, bi- variate, and multivariate analyses of Henke and Protsch (1978) and Brauer (1980) place Paderborn in H. sapiens sapiens. Perhaps the most significant Upper Pleistocene specimen from this region is the frontal from Hahn6fersand (Brauer 1980, 1981). It has no cultural associations and dates to 36,000 B.P. by amino-acid racemization and 36,000 ? 600 B.P. by radiocarbon (collagen). It exhibits well-developed superciliary arches, continuous over glabella. The arches appear to thin laterally, but it is difficult to determine to what extent because the lateral parts of both sides of the superorbitals are damaged. Brauer (1980:13-14) states that a division into superciliary arch and supraorbital trigone is visible on the right side, so that the specimen does not possess a supraorbital torus in the classical sense. Also, the frontal sinus appears to extend slightly into the squama. Several of the bivariate and multivariate analyses of Hahn6fersand reported by Brauer place it either with Neandertals or in an intermediate position between Neandertals and Upper Paleolithic hominids. Brauer explains this combination of Neandertal and modern traits as the result of hybridization between Neandertals and early modern H. sapiens."3 However, given the early date of the specimen and its morphology and geographic location, it can also be inter- preted as an extension of the same early modern H. sapiens "population" which includes the Mladec, Brno, and Zlaty Kfiun remains in South-Central Europe and thus as a further indi- 12 A specimen from Kelsterbach, near Frankfurt, is reported to date to ca. 32,000 B.P. (Henke and Protsch 1978) but is not yet described. Several of Brauer's (1980) bivariate plots place it clearly in the H. sapiens sapiens group. 13 This interpretation is based to some degree on the assumption that there were early modern H. sapiens populations in Germany (Paderborn, Kelsterbach) at the same time as classic Neandertals in Western Europe. Although many of the latter are dated to Wiirm II, there is little indication that they were contemporaneous with anv modern H. sapiens population in either Western or Central Europe. However, should the Chatelperronian Neandertal from Saint-Cesaire (Leveque and Vandermeersch 1980, 1981; ApSimon 1980) prove to be ca. 33,000 years old, it would make the notion of contemporaneity between late Neandertals in Western Europe and early modern hominids in Central Europe more plausible and increase the attrac- tiveness of Brauer's hypothesis. 684 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="19">cation of a transition between H. sapiens neanderthalensis and H. sapiens sapiens in Central Europe. WESTERN EUROPE Western Europe has yielded an impressive array of Neandertal remains, generally referred to as "classic" Neandertals (see Howell 1952). The majority of these (e.g., La Chapelle-aux- Saints, La Ferrassie, La Quina, and Hortus) are correlated with Wuirm J114 (Heim 1976a, de Lumley 1976, Vandermeersch 1976), between approximately 50,000 and 40,000 B.P. How- ever, for various reasons, the placement of many of the speci- mens (particularly those found early in this century) in Wtirm II cannot be considered conclusive. Only a few Upper Pleis- tocene specimens seem to be pre-Wiurm II (see Wolpoff 1980a), and there appear to be very few systematic differences between the pre-Wiurm II and Wiurm II Neandertal samples in Western Europe. The morphological features which characterize the Western European Neandertals have been outlined, and further detail may be found in a number of recent discussions (e.g., Heim 1974, 1976b; Trinkaus and Howells 1979; Wolpoff 1980a). Present evidence does not unequivocally indicate the pres- ence of a late Neandertal group in Western Europe that exhibits a consistent overall pattern of change in the direction of modern H. sapiens. There is evidence of anterior dental reduc- tion from the earlier to later Neandertal samples (Frayer 1978, Wolpoff 1980a), and reduction of Wiurm II anterior teeth is particularly evident at the late Wurm II site of Hortus (de Lumley 1973, 1976), where the anterior teeth are consistently smaller than those of the rest of the Wtirm II sample. The only other indications of "progressive" features in the WVirm II Western European sample are isolated occurrences of such traits as incipiently developed mental eminences on La Fer- rassie 1 and Circeo 2 associated with what is otherwise "typi- cally" Neandertal morphology. The recent discovery of a Neandertal in a Chatelperronian context at Saint-Cesaire in France (Leveque and Vandermeersch 1980) deserves special attention. Although the preliminary considerations of the morphology of this specimen emphasize that it is virtually identical to earlier (Wurm II) Neandertals (Leveque and Vandermeersch 1980, ApSimon 1980, Vander- meersch 1981b), my limited examination of it in Paris in 1979 left the impression of strong similarity to the Vindija Nean- dertals in the mandible and supraorbital torus. Others (Wol- poff, personal communication) have come to the same conclu- sion.'5 While more information is needed to be certain, the latest Neandertals in Western Europe (Saint-Cesaire and pos- sibly Hortus) indicate some morphological change in the direction of modern H. sapiens. However, if the age of the Saint-Cesaire specimen is comparable to available radiocarbon dates for the Chatelperronian at other sites (e.g., Arcy-sur- Cure), 31,000 to 33,000 B.P., it is somewhat more recent than the late Neandertal group from South-Central Europe. If the available dates are giving the correct temporal picture, it would also appear that Upper Paleolithic technology devel- oped somewhat earlier in South-Central than in Western Eu- rope. Combining this with the indication that the morphological transition between H. sapiens neanderthalensis and H. sapiens sapiens was under way in South-Central Europe before there is much evidence for it in Western Europe, it is possible that the transition in South-Central Europe served as a catalyst for Smith: HOMINID EVOLUTION IN SOUTH-CENTRAL EUROPE events in Western Europe. However, a much better under- standing of the exact chronological positions of many speci- mens (particularly many of the supposed Wtirm II Nean- dertals) and more data on the morphology and chronological position of the latest Western European Neandertals are neces- sary before the nature of the Neandertal-early modern rela- tionship in Western Europe can be demonstrated. Except for the Chatelperronian specimens, the earliest Western European Upper Paleolithic remains are Middle Aurignacian. Thus, a critical gap remains between the latest Neandertals and earliest moderns in Western Europe that complicates assessment of the relationship between them. The earliest H. sapiens sapiens specimens include the robust re- mains from Cro-Magnon and Grotte des Enfants (Billy 1976). However, this robustness, especially in the occipital region (often including hemi-buns), recalls Neandertal morphology, as do other aspects of their morphology (see Wolpoff 1980a). The impression that little difference exists between these speci- mens and modern Europeans (e.g., Boule 1923, Boule and Vallois 1957) is far from the truth, as a significant amount of evolutionary change is documented from the early to late Upper Paleolithic samples in Western Europe (Billy 1976). Thus, the Western European early Upper Paleolithic material is inter- mediate in numerous features between Neandertals and later modern Europeans. At the present time, Western Europe does not provide as convincing an indication of morphological continuity as South- Central Europe does. It is tempting (and perhaps more de- fensible) to hypothesize considerable extraneous effect on the Neandertal-early modern transition in Western Europe and to suggest that at least the immediate source area for this in- fluence was South-Central Europe. CONCLUSION A distinct morphological continuum exists between H. sapiens neanderthalensis and H. sapiens sapiens in South-Central Europe. This is supported by the consistent pattern of change between early Neandertals (Krapina, Ganovce, Ochoz, Su- balyuk) and late Neandertals (Vindija, Kfulna, Sipka, Sala?) in certain features, always in the direction of early modern H. sapiens, and the consistent presence of clearly Neandertal- reminiscent features in the earliest H. sapiens sapiens speci- mens. To what extent this continuum reflects the influence of gene flow from some adjacent region is difficult to assess be- cause of the difficulty of identifying the effects of gene flow in a paleontological context. However, modern H. sapiens can- not conclusively be shown to occur any earlier in any of the regions adjacent to South-Central Europe, including the Near East, than in South-Central Europe itself. On the basis of the data available at present, there is no reason to believe that gene flow into this region from the Near East or anywhere else was any more responsible for the archaic-to-modern H. sapiens transition in South-Central Europe than gene flow from South- Central Europe was for the same transition in the Near East or elsewhere. There is no convincing evidence, either archaeo- logical or skeletal, to indicate a migration of fully evolved modern H. sapiens into South-Central Europe. In fact, both the Szeletian and Aurignacian, which represent the earliest Upper Paleolithic in the region, most likely have their roots in the Central European Middle Paleolithic. Until it can be dis- proven, the simplest and most logical hypothesis supportable on the basis of present knowledge is that the archaic-to- modern-H.-sapiens transition in South-Central Europe was indigenous. The nature of the relationship between this transi- tion and the same transition in areas to the north and west in Europe is not clear. The rather sparse evidence from North- 14 This would be roughly equivalent to the Lower Wuirm stadial of Musil and Valoch (1966). It should be noted that specimens like Neander Valley are often included with classic Neandertals. 15 The archaeological associations of Combe-Capelle and the Chatelperron calvarium are problematic, and neither should be considered of Chatelperronian age. With the exception of Saint- Cesaire, this leaves only a few fragmentary specimens from Arcy- sur-Cure as definite Chatelperronian-associated remains. These specimens exhibit Neandertal affinities (Wolpoff 1980a). Vol. 23 * No. 6 * December 1982 685</page><page sequence="20">Central Europe seems to reflect the same morphological con- tinuity, within the same chronological framework, as is docu- mented for South-Central Europe. In Western Europe, the continuum is less distinct, but new discoveries appear to be closing the gap. Present chronological information suggests that the transition may occur somewhat later in Western Europe than in Central Europe. Although it is certainly a pos- sibility, more data are necessary before suggesting that the origin of modern H. sapiens in Western Europe was the result of influence from South-Central Europe. Finally, although some of the interpretations presented in this paper may not be convincing to all, there is no denying the critical importance of South-Central Europe and its Upper Pleistocene hominid sample to the question of the origin of modern Europeans and the "fate" of the Neandertals. Paleo- anthropology has a long and distinguished tradition in this area of Europe, beginning with the work of Gorjanovic-Kramberger, Matiegka, Maska, Absolon, and others at sites like Kirapina, Mladec, Ochoz, and Sipka. Recent discoveries at new sites (e.g., Vindija, Kfilna, Velika Pecina) suggest that considerable information is yet to be recovered in South-Central Europe and that this region will continue to provide new insights into the nature and course of Upper Pleistocene hominid evolution. Comments by P. ALLSWORTH-JONES Department of Archaeology, University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria. 1 vi 82 Smith's article, following on his detailed studies of the Krapina and Vindija hominids (Smith 1976b; Smith and Ranyard 1980), is a thorough and well-balanced account of the subject which marks a significant advance, and in some respects change of emphasis, compared with the last such general survey published in CA (Jelinek 1969). He argues for a consistent pattern of change between early and late Neandertals in the area, always in the direction of early modern Homo sapiens, such as to suggest morphological continuity between these two. For this thesis to be maintained it is obvious that the chronology of the sites must rest upon a secure basis. I would therefore like to comment principally upon the stratigraphic and artefactual associations of some of the major finds, since-quite under- standably, in view of his primary interest in the hominid material-this is where Smith's analysis is perhaps least authoritative. Recent work in the Netherlands has, as Smith says, es- tablished a well-documented sequence with two successive ("middle" and "upper Wuirm") interstadials, named after Hengelo and Denekamp. Denekamp corresponds to Stillfried B, and Valoch (1976a) has located a dated fossil soil at Brno- Bohunice contemporary with Hengelo. Therefore I do not doubt the existence of a "middle Wuirm" interstadial in Central Europe, but it is questionable whether it should any longer be referred to as Podhradem. Kukla, in his comment on Valoch's (1968) CA article, emphasised the difficulties of generalising on the basis of cave sediments and the particular problems attaching to the Pod Hradem cave. Layer 8, supposed to represent the upper part of the Podhradem interstadial, has a number of C'4 dates ranging from 28,100 to 33,300 B.P., SUffi- cient to indicate that this layer at least can be regarded as the equivalent not of Hengelo, but of Denekamp (Vogel and Waterbolk 1972). Valoch's division of the Central European Middle Palaeo- lithic is not the last word on the subject, and he has himself revised his ideas in some respects (Valoch 1977-78). More comprehensive schemes are those of Bosinski (1967) and Gabori (1976). The revised date for Salzgitter-Lebenstedt (with which hominid remains are associated; Kleinschmidt 1965) is 55,600 ? 900 B.P. (Vogel and Zagwijn 1967); there is another date for Tata of 50,500 + 3,000 - 2,000 B.P. which actually is more consonant with the other data from the site (Vertes 1964). Until Valoch's "Krumlovian" sites are fully published and critically examined it will not be possible to judge whether they really lie at the origin of the Central European Aurignacian; elsewhere, as at Baco Kiro, there appears to be no connection between the Aurignacian and the underlying Middle Palaeo- lithic (Kozlowski 1975, 1979). Comments on some of the individual sites are as follows: Svdzdu'v Stu'l. Klima's excavations revealed five "brown earth layers" (6-2); 5 contained a "late Mousterian" and 2 (the oldest) an "early Mousterian-Micoquian" (Vlcek 1969). Vainura's finds are supposed to correspond stratigraphically to this lower layer, and hence Rzehak's mandible may reasonably be inferred to have been associated with the "early" rather than the "late Mousterian." Subalyuk. I think it is unjust to suggest that Subalyuk was poorly dug; Kadic was always a careful excavator, and by the time he came to this cave (following Dancza's admittedly un- systematic beginning) he had had more than 20 years' experi- ence of working in the Buikk. Janossy (1960) was subsequently able to analyse some micromammalian remains from the cave which have helped to provide chronological precision, such that the upper archaeological unit (Kadic's "late Mousterian") with the hominid finds can reasonably be regarded as somewhat later than Tata but prior to the cold peak of the "lower Wurm" stadial (Kretzoi, cited in Gabori-Csank 1968). Vindija. Until this site is published in full, great uncertainty must remain about the true archaeological associations of some of the layers, particularly Layer G. If the profile originally published by Malez (1975) is compared with that in Wolpoff et al. (1981), significant differences will be observed; in the latter, for example, the Szeletian has entirely disappeared. It is going too far to attribute the whole of Layer G1 to the Aurignacian on the basis of one split-based bone point found at the top, particularly since the layer was disturbed by cryo- turbation (Wolpoff et al. 1981). Similar conditions at Dzerava Skala (Palffy) render the interpretation of that site difficult (Valoch 1969), and at both caves the possibility of significant hiatuses cannot be ignored. It cannot be asserted unequivocally that the G1 hominids are "Aurignacian-associated." Kutlna. The industry with which the hominid finds are associated is now termed Micoquian (Valoch 1977-78) and has a C'4 date of 45,660 + 2,850 - 2,200 B.P. (Valoch 1978). Sipka. It is by no means certain that the Sipka mandible can be referred to the "middle Wuirm" interstadial. Kukla (1954), in his analysis of Prosek's profile, offered both a "long" and a "short" chronology, but in either case he interpreted Layer 9, equivalent to Maska's faunal unit III, as stadial rather than interstadial in character. He regarded Layer 6, equivalent to Maska's faunal unit IV, as no later than "early Wurm." G'abori (1976) points out that some of the species in faunal units III and IV can hardly be regarded as typical for an interstadial and that the Sipka industry certainly does not have to be regarded as a "late" Mousterian. Mladec. In view of what has been said about the Pod Hradem sequence, cross-dating by reference to that site would seem to be at best approximate. But insofar as the archaeological material may be employed, the Aurignacian artefacts from Mladec are best compared to those from Layer 8 at Pod Hradem, which, as I have noted, is Cl4-dated to Denekamp rather than Hengelo. Zlatyi Kui. The artefacts have now been published in full and reassessed (Fridrich 1973, Fridrich and Sklenar 1976); because of the presence of a fragmentary Mladec-type bone point, they are regarded as most probably related to the 686 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="21">Aurignacian, but it is emphasised that the collection is not certainly homogeneous or directly associated with the hominid finds. Others. Hillebrand's (1914) discovery of a child's molar tooth in what he described as a "Protosolutrean" context at Dzerav'a Skala (Palffy) should not perhaps be underestimated; according to him it had a pronounced anterior fovea and in this could be compared to teeth from Krapina. The importance of the find may be enhanced by the fact that three "Neander- taloid" teeth are now claimed to have been found in a similar context (now termed "Jankovichian") at Mariaremete, just west of Budapest (Gabori 1976). The general effect of the stratigraphic amendments suggested is (apart from Kfulna) to shift back in time some of the Ne- andertal Middle Palaeolithic-associated specimens and to bring forward some of the early Upper Palaeolithic ones. Their area of possible overlap in the "middle Wuirm" interstadial is thereby reduced. by NOEL T. BOAZ Department of Anthropology, New York University, New York, N.Y. 10003, U.S.A. 13 v 82 Smith has done a creditable service in reviewing the evidence for hominid evolution in South-Central Europe during the Late Pleistocene (a term preferable to "Upper Pleistocene" when referring to temporal and not relative stratigraphic position). His important observations must be incorporated into any general evolutionary model for Neandertals and Homo sapiens sapiens. However, a simple "Neanderthal phase" hypothesis of anagenetic evolution of H. sapiens neanderthalensis into H. sapiens sapiens, while explaining the situation in South- Central Europe, does not account for (1) a demonstrably more rapid transition to anatomically modern man in Western Europe (Stringer 1978, Brauer 1981); (2) the appearance of H. s. sapiens earlier than in Europe in other parts of the Old World, most clearly in Africa (Howell 1978); and (3) the fact that "Neandertals" are not found throughout the Old World, but only in Europe and closely adjoining areas (Trinkaus and Howells 1979, Santa Luca 1978, Howell 1957). Smith discounts Points 1 and 2 and does not address 3. Boaz, Ninkovich, and Rossignol-Strick (1982) have suggested a hypothesis based on a model by Howell (1951, 1952, 1957) and new data that accounts for the above three points as well as Smith's observations. Contra Smith's unsupported conten- tion, paleogeographical and vegetational features associated with increasingly cold climate after Oxygen Isotope Stage 5e (ca. 120,000 years B.P.) strongly suggest virtual but not total geographical (and thus genetic) isolation of European H. sapiens populations, which subsequently evolved into the sub- specifically distinct H. sapiens neanderthalensis. There was a clinal gradient from Western Europe to the east, and Smith's data amply demonstrate this fact. Toward the glacial maximum at Oxygen Isotope Stage 2 (ca. 30,000-35,000 years B.P.), a period of extremely arid conditions in North Africa and south- western Asia (Sarnthein 1978), H. s. sapiens appeared in Europe. These arid conditions in the south likely were re- sponsible for pushing large mammal species, and with them H. s. sapiens hunter-gatherers, into the colder but more pro- ductive regions to the north. If, as is probable, North African and southwestern Asian populations were H. s. sapiens, sub- specifically distinct but clinally related, their influx into Europe in large numbers likely accounts for the disappearance of typical Neandertal morphology. This replacement probably had a large component of genetic admixture, which explains continuities in morphology to be seen in the paleontological record (Hrdlicka 1927, Schwalbe 1901, Brace 1967, Wolpoff 1980a), transitional forms such as Hahnoifersand (Brauer 1981), and apparently late-surviving Neandertals such as Saint- Smith: HaOMIYI EVOLUTION IN SOUTH-CENTRAL EUROPE Cesaire (Leveque and Vandermeersch 1980). In what could be called the genetic-replacement hypothesis, we would expect such a mosaic pattern of change, as is also observed by Smith in his sample. Nevertheless, Smith rejects this hypothesis, but neither the arguments adduced in his article nor those cited as support (Spencer and Smith 1981) are to me a convincing refutation. Further carefully controlled work in North Africa and southwestern Asia, as well as in the Old World generally, in the time period of ca. 30,000-100,000 years B.P. will be needed to answer these questions. It is, of course, impossible to include all specimens in a review article of this kind, but I was disappointed that Smith did not discuss the Neandertal cranium from Podbaba, Czechoslovakia (Fric 1885, Schaafhausen 1885, cited by Matiegka 1924), un- fortunately now apparently lost. Comparison of this specimen (to the extent allowed by the descriptions and photographs) with the larger hominid sample now known from South- Central Europe might shed additional light on the morpho- logical similarities and contrasts of eastern and western Ne- andertal populations. by C. L. BRACE Museum of Anthropology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Mich. 48109, U.S.A. 6 v 82 Congratulations are in order for a splendid synthesis. All the main issues are identified and discussed in the light of all the available evidence. Given the scattered nature of the latter, this feat in itself is a considerable contribution. Furthermore, Smith accomplishes this without recourse to the dogma and rhetoric which have so often clouded such discussions. My comments, then, will be confined to some relatively minor matters. The "Neanderthal question" continues to fascinate, and agreement continues to be as far away as ever-and it starts with the very way in which one chooses to spell the name. This has been repeatedly discussed, and many including Smith have followed Vallois's recommendation that the "h" be removed to conform with the revision of German orthography in 1901 (Vallois 1952). Others, for example Howells (1974:17), Stringer (1974:318), and myself (Brace 1964, 1979a, b; Brace et al. 1979), retain the older version, "Neanderthal," because that is the way it was spelled when the first recognized specimen was discovered at the site of that name in 1856. The rest of my remarks are of no greater moment and will be confined to details of the Krapina collection, correctly noted by Smith as the richest assemblage of Neanderthal skeletal remains in Europe. Uncertainty continues concerning just how many individuals were represented among the very fragmentary remains. Smith cites Wolpoff's estimate that the number may approach 80. However, the technique and data used to arrive at this estimate are not described in Wolpoff's report (1979), and I for one suspect that it is far too large. From my own examination of the material I have suggested a minimum estimate of 14 or 15 (Brace, Nelson, and Korn 1973:106). Like Wolpoff's, this estimate was based on a study of the teeth. There are no more than ten permanent teeth of a given category for a single side (ten lower right third molars and ten upper left canines), and, given the problem of identifying whether a canine is certainly left or right and whether a molar is second or third, there continues to be some doubt whether there were 9 or 10 adults represented. There are five lower left first deciduous molars and five lower second deciduous molars, both left and right. The minimum number of children, then, was 5. Smith also states that the frontal sinus is restricted to the torus. However, as I showed in 1964 (figure 6), in the specimen Vol. 23 * No. 6 * December 1982 687</page><page sequence="22">catalogued as No. 23 (Fr. 2) the sinus rises up beyond the torus into the diploe of the frontal. Further, Smith refers to the nasal breadth of the Krapina C and E fragments as being two standard deviations below the Western European Neanderthal mean, although that figure is based on unstated specimens. The dimensions of the Krapina nasal aperture cannot be measured on these specimens. The only breadth measure they both yield is the upper breadth of the nasal bones themselves (Martin No. 57[2]; Martin 1928: 661), which is 18 mm and 14 mm respectively. Boule made a reasonable reconstruction of the nasal bones of La Chapelle- aux-Saints from the preserved portions of frontal and maxilla and recorded a breadth of 14 mm (Boule 1912:29). The upper nasal bone breadth can be measured for two other specimens from Krapina-the previously mentioned frontal fragment, No. 23 (Fr. 2), with a measurement of 13.7 mm, and the separate nasal bones numbered 43 (Na 1) at 14.1. The mean of the four Krapina specimens is 15 mm, which is (nonsignificantly) larger than the measure for La Chapelle-aux-Saints. The other measurements possible on the nasal bones of the Krapina C skull (No. 3) again are almost identical to those of La Chapelle. The maximum width (Martin No. 57[1]) is 22 mm for Krapina and 21 mm for La Chapelle. The maxillary border length of the nasal bone was reconstructed by Boule as 29 mm (Boule 1912:29), and my measure for the Krapina C fragment is 26 mm. It would seem, then, in nasal measurements as in the other data mentioned by Smith, that Krapina cannot be dis- tinguished from the Western European Neanderthals. There are some other minor points that can also be made. For instance, while Smith states that there has been a reduction in molar tooth size between the appearance of H. erectus and the end of the Middle Pleistocene, the data show that there is no significant difference between molar tooth size of the Chou- koutien erectus sample and the early Neanderthals from Krapina (Brace 1979b, c). The subsequent difference between the Krapina figures and the available measurements for late Neanderthals in Western Europe (excluding Hortus, where the measurements are even smaller) suggests that a major reduction was under way. This, of course, is entirely in accord with the thrust of Smith's presentation, and, like the other points mentioned above, not only cannot be viewed as a criticism of his masterly analysis, but actually can serve to strengthen the picture that he has gone to such lengths to give us. by FRANCIS B. HARROLD Department of Sociology, University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, Tex. 76019, U.S.A. 18 v 82 Smith's article is a signal contribution to the study of the origins of Homo sapiens sapiens, of just the sort we need-a detailed examination of relevant evidence in one region. It integrates a good deal of factual and bibliographical information not easily available to many readers. His arguments are well- reasoned and plausible, although I wonder whether the frag- mentary and sometimes poorly dated fossils he deals with are sufficient to prove his case. From the perspective of my own research on the Chatelper- ronian in France and Spain (Harrold 1978, n.d.), I find several of the issues raised by Smith important. 1. It is likely that the early Upper Paleolithic of South- Central Europe is distinctly older than that of Western Europe, which apparently does not antedate 35,000 B.P. Bacho Kiro 11, for example, is both old (Podhradem interstadial?) and Upper Paleolithic according to French typological study (Kozlowski 1979); Delporte and Djindjian (1979) describe it as Aurignacian. 2. It is also possible that modern H. sapiens is much earlier in South-Central Europe, given the Bacho Kiro remains; but Smith's cautions regarding their fragmentary and undescribed state are well taken. That still leaves Velika Pecina as earlier than any well-dated H. sapiens sapiens to the west. 3. Given the available information, I think that the Saint- Cesaire find makes a hypothesis of gradual Neanderthal-to- modern evolution less tenable in Western Europe than to the east. A Neanderthal is now associated with the Chatelper- ronian, which appeared rather abruptly in the archeological record, contemporaneously with the Aurignacian (Harrold n.d.; Laville, Rigaud, and Sackett 1980). The Chatelperronian, technologically and typologically Upper Paleolithic, is far more comparable to the Aurignacian than to the Mousterian, though distinct from both (Harrold 1982). The contemporaneity of these two industries is probably no coincidence; one possibility (Klein 1973) is that the Chatelperronian represents local responses to the diffusion or importation of new technology and behaviors. The "critical gap" between Neanderthals and earlv moderns in Western Europe which Smith mentions seems now to be short indeed: Saint-Cesaire is probably 31,000+ to 35,000 years old (the span of the Chatelperronian), while the early modern specimens from Cro-Magnon are estimated by Movius (1969) to be some 30,000 years old on the basis of stratigraphic correlations with the nearby Abri Pataud. It is questionable whether in situ evolution could produce the changes implied by a comparison of these fossils in only one to five millennia. Even if Saint-Cesaire displays facial similarities to the Vindija G3 fossils, all are still referable to H. sapiens neanderthalensis; and the French subject is considerably younger than the Vindija (pre-Podhradem) fossils, probably by 10,000 years or more. Full definition of these issues must await detailed descriptions of the Saint-Cesaire fossils and industry; but on current evidence, the transition to H. sapiens sapiens in Western Europe seems to have been later and more rapid than in South- Central Europe and may have even involved migration. by W. W. HOWELLS Peabody Museum, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass. 02138, U.S.A. 19 v 82 This welcome organization of the materials from the extensive south-central province, and of the Slavic literature on it, is the kind of thing that helps to define and narrow the Neander- thal "problem." The problem is really that of the "fate" of the Neanderthals, and the decisive evidence is not in-new finds continue to be interpreted in several ways. Smith defines the primary hypotheses: migration, gene flow, and indigenous transition. Of these, the extreme position would be the last, since migration and gene flow vary by the proportion of genes that have feet on them. Pure gene flow is a little nebulous in this situation; in any case its action would be slow, as would indigenous evolution. We should do more with models for tribal structure and contact within and between Mousterian and Upper Paleolithic peoples. Smith's own position is cautious enough. He sees a morpho- logical continuum between the above two peoples in South- Central Europe as evidence of indigenous transition here. Northwestern Europe, where the continuum is less clear, may have had an extraneous effect from the east, by gene flow acting on its developing (Neanderthal) population. Within the context of the article, certain problems remain: 1. Compared with that of Western Europe, the Middle Paleolithic material is more fragmentary, with no complete crania or faces. Depending partly on this fact and partly on point of view, the continuum from Middle to Upper Paleolithic may be less convincing to other viewers. 2. The Upper Paleolithic traits seen as retained features of Neanderthal ancestry (in the Mladec and Predmosti samples) are somewhat vague and, especially, may be more in the nature of characters of general robustness rather than specifically of Neanderthal origin (even by admixture): heavy supraorbitals, size of nuchal plane, and presence of a "hemibun." That bunning is a specifically Neanderthal trait is questioned by 688 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="23">Trinkaus and LeMay (1982), who find it to be a phenomenon of growth timing of the cerebral hemispheres, present in most hominid samples at least since the end of the Middle Pleistocene. Furthermore, postcranial robustness is a feature of both Middle and Upper Paleolithic populations (Trinkaus 1976b and n.d. b) but is expressed in quite different morphologies (e.g., of the femur), where a continuum across the transition is not noted by Smith. Parenthetically, light on robustness effects on cranial form may eventually emerge from study of Pleistocene Australian materials. 3. The "fate" of the Neanderthals is only one part of the "problem." A major aspect is the original evolution of the Neanderthals, before the beginning of the Wurm, to the western "classic" stage, the adaptive causes of this, and the cladistic aspects of the whole phenomenon. The real morpho- logical distinctness of the classics from H. sapiens sapiens is unquestioned, certainly for Western Europe; so unless the Neanderthal development is taken into account, its relation to H. s. sapiens is unhinged. In this connection, the whole situation as described by Smith would equally well fit Vandermeersch's hypothesis (e.g., 1981c) that any late Wurm movement or development of H. sapiens sapiens in the West was preceded by Neanderthal evolution- of classics-in Western Europe, followed by Neanderthal ex- pansion eastward, into South-Central Europe and western Asia, producing various intermediate, supposedly transitional forms there. by KUBET LUCHTERHAND Department of Anthropology, Roosevelt University, and Depart- ment of Geology, Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago, Ill. 60605, U.S.A. 7 vi 82 Smith makes a convincing case that the Pannonian Basin constitutes a well-defined natural geographic area for the study of human evolution during the first cold maximum of the WUrm (ca. 58,000-40,000 B.P., vide Butzer 1971:274). It is sharply demarcated by the highlands which surround it, and the drain- age pattern within it suggests that the easiest communication in and out would be to the northwest via the Danube Valley and to the west over the passes leading to northern Italy. There may also have been communication to the western margin of the Black Sea through the "Iron Gate" of the Danube. Hominid sites are concentrated (see fig. 1) precisely at the northwestern and western avenues into the basin, suggesting that seasonal migration of mammals in those areas may have been a major factor affecting site distribution. This possibility is in accord with the interpretation of Neanderthal sites else- where in northern and eastern Europe-e.g., Salzgitter- Lebenstedt (Tode et al. 1953; Butzer 1971:468-71) and Molodova (Klein 1969)-as seasonal hunting camps. It would be interesting to know whether the various rock-shelter, cave, and open sites in the Pannonian Basin differ in the seasons or lengths of time for which they were occupied. Examination of the faunal remains with an eye to seasonality of occupation might provide unique data on the annual round of extractive activities of Neanderthal peoples living there. Animal migration into the Pannonian Basin probably came from northern Italy in the spring or early summer at the same time that northern-steppe faunal elements were moving northwestward up the Danube Valley and out of the basin. In fall or early winter, a reverse flow probably occurred, with northern-steppe faunal elements moving down the Danube and into the basin from the northwest at the same time that more southerly elements were returning across the passes to northern Italy. Such a pattern of faunal movement seems reasonably likely if Frenzel's (1968, 1973) vegetational recon- structions are correct. If it can be assumed to have occurred, Smith: HIOMINID EVOLUTION 11V SOUTH-CENTRAL EUROPE it would help to make sense of the site concentrations shown in figure 1. If, as Smith suggests, the Szeletian industries of the region represent an indigenous development, more or less coincident with the Podhradem interstadial, they provide an additional indication that Neanderthal adaptation in the basin may have been strongly focused on particular local resources and thus may have been correspondingly insular. We have direct indica- tions from ethnographic data on Caribou Eskimos (Birket- Smith 1929) and from mid-Pleistocene hominid distribution patterns in eastern Asia (Luchterhand 1974, 1978) that the association between human populations and their local resource base can be strong enough effectively to isolate those popula- tions from adjacent but somewhat different biomes. Typically this occurs because some part of their resource base either is so attractive or productive as to determine the major adaptive pattern or so critically important for some particular resource or at some particular season that the distribution of that resource limits the distribution of the people depending on it. Since the Pannonian Basin is well-demarcated now and would presumably have been even more so during full-glacial climatic conditions, it was probably adaptive specializations to local resources that produced the isolation and insularity sufficient to allow (or produce) the gradual, indigenous evolutionary changes in the Neanderthal populations that Smith has de- scribed. by RUDOLF MUSIL University J. E. Purkynte, Kotldr'skd St. 2, 611 37 Brno, Czechoslovakia. 26 v 82 Smith outlines the Upper Pleistocene hominid finds from South- Central Europe and, on the basis of those finds and their comparison with those from other regions, resolves some questions concerning their development. Such outlines are highly desirable both for the information they contain and for their identification of possible gaps in our knowledge and establishment of the basis for broad discussion. Like every paper of its kind, this one draws together a large amount of information from different disciplines, and here there is always the possibility of error when there is only one author. I should like to draw attention to two very important problems. The problem of the relationship of H. sapiens sapiens and H. sapiens neanderthaletnsis is an essential part of the paper, and Smith in fact does not offer an unambiguous answer to it. There is, however, some question that it can be solved on the basis of the available information. He is mostly indined to accept the view that the morphological continuity of hominids of the Upper Pleistocene of South-Central Europe indicates a certain degree of genetic continuity between the two subspecies. If they are subspecies of a single species, they must have arisen from a common basis. Since they coexist, one subspecies can- not have developed from the other, their evolution, as in other animal species, occurring through isolation, either geographical or of some other kind. Two subspecies cannot therefore originate sympatrically. If barriers are removed at an early stage of differentiation, the subspecies mostly cease to exist. Therefore I am of the opinion that this kind of explanation does not correspond very well to reality, since it would mean assuming the existence of two populations of the same species isolated for a long time. The other possibility might be phyletic evolu- tion, which assumes gradual changes in the course of the time sequence the categories or subspecies might pass through. This would correspond to what the author is inclined to accept. In that case, however, the two subspecies could not exist at the same time. Another problem, one that necessarily crops up where data is taken from other authors, is that of dating the finds. Its Vol. 23 * No. 6 * December 1982 689</page><page sequence="24">importance-from the point of view of detailed development- is of the first order; all the conclusions stand or fall with the accuracy of the dating. In this case it seems to me that the dating of the find layers of different sites is by no means uni- form and fixed. One may question whether the finds of Krapina, Ganovce, Ochoz, and Subalyuk are really contemporaneous. I am of the opinion that this is the weakest and at the same time the most important point. Of course, this is a problem the author can hardly solve by himself. by C. B. STRINGER Department of Palaeontology, British Museum (Natural History), Cromwell Rd., London SW7 5BD, England. 2 vi 82 I must congratulate Smith for his comprehensive survey of material which has all too often been neglected in studies of Upper Pleistocene hominid evolution. While Western Europe has produced the better sample of relatively complete Ne- anderthals, it has had a relatively poor sample of early ana- tomically modern hominids. The reverse situation has been true in Eastern Europe, and this has led to constant problems in analysing the material as a whole. In addition, the destruction of many important specimens from Czechoslovakia during the last war was a serious blow to palaeoanthropology. While he does not avoid possibly conflicting evidence, Smith presents the best case yet assembled from any area for a local evolu- tionary transition between Neanderthals and early anatomically modern hominids. However, I still believe that the case is not proven, and, as I have argued elsewhere (Stringer, Jacobi, and Kruszynski 1981, Stringer n.d.), we all need to think more carefully about our approach and beware of expecting simple answers to complex questions. Smith makes constant reference to the "Podhradem inter- stadial" and infers that various Neanderthal-like and early ana- tomically modern hominids may date within it. The establish- ment of this interstadial was questioned long ago from the type site (Kukla 1968), and Valoch himself (1968:386) recognised that two separate interstadials, corresponding to the Western European Hengelo and Denekamp, could in fact be distin- guished. From Tenaghi-Phillipon (van der Hammen 1979) and Grande Pile (Woillard and Mook 1982) it seems clear that these two interstadials or interstadial complexes date to ca. 40,000 years and ca. 30,000 years respectively, and the possibility exists that material from this time period may become confused or may be mixed by weathering in open or cave sites. For this reason I have questioned the daimed association of Neander- thal-like hominids and a single split-based bone point, typical of the Aurignacian, at Vindija (Stringer n.d.). We clearly need more, careful, fieldwork and better absolute dates for this critical period of human evolution. Regarding the establishment of evolutionary trends, I must say I regard them with increasing suspicion. First, unilinear gradualism is the only model of evolutionary change considered. Secondly, supposed morphoclines can be proposed only if the samples are well dated in relation to each other and all the relevant data have been taken into account. Recently it seems to have become fashionable to consider the Krapina sample as the only appropriate model for an early Neanderthal mor- phology. The apparent association of the Sala frontal bone with D. kirchbergensis should warn against this assumption, and in particular the more complete Saccopastore crania, well-dated to the "last interglacial" (sensu lato), provide an alternative (and perhaps earlier) model. Proper comparison of the Sacco- pastore and Krapina samples should be a prerequisite for studies of supposed Neanderthal evolutionary trends. Thirdly, there must be good reasons for the selection of specimens for inclusion in the samples. Smith's reason is geographical proxim- ity, but over a period of perhaps 60,000 years, against a back- ground of profound climatic and cultural changes, I do not believe this alone is good enough. For example, it is possible to produce trends as convincing as those he presents using African Middle Pleistocene hominids and southwestern Asian Upper Pleistocene hominids instead of the Neanderthals as the antecedent populations for early anatomically modern hominids in Europe. This is because, by concentrating on the size reduc- tion of brows, teeth, face, and jaws, he is merely illustrating the loss of primitive characters generally distributed in Middle and early Upper Pleistocene hominids throughout the available fossil sample. Much more specific reasons for linking his samples by derived characters should be sought, but this would require careful study of material from outside his chosen area. If a local evolutionary transition of the sort he favours actually occurred, we should be able to identify morphological and metrical features of local significance in European Ne- anderthals, which could in turn be found in the subsequent, supposedly descendant early anatomically modern hominids of the same area. This approach would necessitate wider com- parisons in order to identify such characters, if they exist, and trace them in time and space. Features such as a high degree of occipital "bunning" (but see Trinkaus and LeMay 1982), an anterior placement of nasion, and a frequent occurrence of the H-O mandibular foramen pattern would seem to be relevant for the establishment of a European clade containing both the Neanderthals and early anatomically modern hominids- which is what Smith is really proposing. But the Eastern European material cannot be studied in isolation, for, if his favoured model is correct, it should be consistent with evidence from elsewhere. It would imply that since largely independent evolution of early anatomically modern hominids occurred in that area, similar evolutionary changes occurred in parallel in other areas, unless Eastern Europe was the earliest centre for radiation of early anatomically modern characters to other areas-which I consider unlikely. Through the courtesy of Vandermeersch I was recently able to study the Saint-Cesaire fossil hominid, and I completely concur with the assessments of it published so far (Leveque and Vandermeersch 1981). Seemingly only a punctuational change of major proportions could convert such a late and "classic" Neanderthal into an early anatomically modern hominid, and if we have to consider that alternative all discussion of gradual evolutionary trends becomes quite redundant. Yet the "classic" nature of the Saint-Cesaire fossil does show up the "progres- sive" features of the Eastern European specimens in greater relief. The next problem is whether these "progressive" fea- tures were in fact concentrated in late Neanderthals of this area or were part of the normal variation allowable in a Ne- anderthal population, giving due regard to the smaller body size of the Vindija specimens and a possible preponderance of immature or female individuals in the sample. The fragmentary nature of the Vindija sample leads to difficulties in comparisons, and, from my own data, I wonder, for example, whether the low values for estimated inferior nasal breadth in the Vindija specimens are due to comparison with the more usual maximum breadth values for the Neanderthal and early anatomically modern hominid samples. A more relevant and much more contrasting comparison of the Vindija specimens could be made with only the female specimens of early anatomically modern hominids, such as Mladec 1 and 2, Brno 1 and 3, Dolni Vestonice 3, Predmosti 4, and Velika Pecina. While concentrating on the large supraorbital region and occipital bunning of the most robust specimens, such as Mladec 5 and Pavlov 1, Smith fails to emphasise that other aspects of their cranial form contrast markedly with those of any of the Neanderthals, in some ways even appearing more archaic. In particular, the occipital torus and mastoid morphology of some of these specimens is very robust and utterly different from the consistent and even rather gracile Neanderthal pattern established in Europe over the previous 100,000 years. This anomaly certainly needs explaining if local morphological continuity is proposed. Making comparisons beyond Smith's immediate area of 690 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="25">concern, it seems an inescapable conclusion that a greater number of skeletal characters, whether primitive or derived, is shared between the Neanderthal populations of Europe and southwestern Asia than either shares with the early anatomical- ly modern hominids of the same areas. Similarly, the European and southwestern Asian early anatomically modern hominids appear to have many more characters in common than either has with the supposedly ancestral Neanderthal populations of the same areas. This is as true for the postcranial skeleton as for cranial material, as is shown by recent comparisons of limb proportions (Trinkaus 1981). This does not accord at all well with proposed local evolutionary sequences and surely necessi- tates the recognition of a high degree of gene flow or population movement between the two areas for the Neanderthals and, separately, for the early anatomically modern hominids (fig. 1). The only alternative explanations available seem to be descent from common ancestors that already possessed the shared characters or a remarkable degree of parallel or even convergent evolution, bordering on orthogenesis. As Smith points out, demonstration that the Skhuil and Qafzeh hominids are older than ca. 40,000 years B.P. would make the replacement hypothesis more difficult to reject. The evidence is not yet conclusive, but several lines of evidence suggest that this is indeed the case. Farrand's lithostrati- graphic correlations have recently received independent support from further, but still preliminary, amino acid dates for Tabuin, Skhul, and Qafzeh (Masters, reported in Bar Yosef and Vandermeersch 1981). The age of Tabuin 1 is likely to be ca. 50,000 years B.P., while some of the Qafzeh hominids appear to be of comparable or even greater antiquity. Even if, despite evidence to the contrary (Bar Yosef and Vander- meersch 1981), we accept Jelinek's relative dating evidence that the Qafzeh-Skhull Mousterian assemblages are younger than that of Tabun C, they should only be marginally younger, given the appearance of Upper Palaeolithic technology in various parts of the Levant prior to 40,000 years ago (Bar Yosef and Vandermeersch 1981). This means that early ana- tomically modern hominids apparently existed in southwestern Asia before Neanderthals such as those from Saint-Cesaire and La Ferrassie lived in Western Europe and probably also earlier than Eastern European specimens such as Vindija G1 and Sipka. This accords perfectly with the replacement model, as does evidence of a staggered, rather than synchronous, appear- ance of early anatomically modern hominids from Africa to Western Europe. Whether gene flow, actual population move- ment, or some combination of these factors is proposed is largely a matter of preference, although evidence of cultural continuity must be taken into account where appropriate.

Below, actual maximum similarity in shared (especially derived) characters according to various cranial and postcranial Smith: HIOMINID EVOLUTION IN SOUTH-CENTRAL EUROPE gnacian-like industry in Bulgaria prior to 40,000 years ago is also strong, but although from casts and photographs the hominid remains certainly appear "modern" in morphology, they are too incomplete to allow decisive comment at present. Most of the European early anatomically modern hominids are associated with the Aurignacian or Gravettian (if we dis- count the Vindija evidence), but it would not be out of the question, following the Skhul and Qafzeh discoveries, to expect evidence of such hominids in Eastern Europe at an even earlier date, associated with an antecedent Mousterian indus- try. Perhaps Zlaty Ku'n or Staroselye might actually represent such occurrences? Smith has presented the best case yet from any area for a local evolutionary transition between Neanderthals and early anatomically modern hominids. The case certainly seems a stronger one than can be made for southwestern Asia. How- ever, in my view an even stronger case for the origin of early anatomically modern hominids from the less specialized African Middle-Upper Pleistocene hominids can be made from the available evidence. by ERIK TRINKAUS Department of Anthropology, Peabody Museum, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass. 02138, U.S.A. 7 v 82 Smith's review of the fossil human remains from the Upper Pleistocene of South-Central Europe is an excellent discussion of this important paleontological sample. Treatments of late archaic humans and the origins of anatomically modern humans have indeed tended to overemphasize the Western European and Levantine material, and Smith is to be commended for focusing our attention on the important fossils to the east of the Alps. In addition, this paper is a timely contribution to Upper Pleistocene paleoanthropology; the transition to modern- appearing humans and the associated archeological transition from Middle to Upper (sensu lato) Paleolithic industries have been receiving increasing attention (e.g., Trinkaus and Howells 1979, White 1982), and it is certain that Smith's article and the ensuing discussion will contribute to our rethinking of this, the last major biological and cultural transition in human evolution. Discussions of Upper Pleistocene human evolution seem to be obliged to focus on the phylogenetic fate of the Neandertals, and Smith's paper is no exception to this rule. His discussions are concerned with the extent of continuity of gene pools across the evolutionary transition, and the descriptions of the specimens and samples emphasize those traits that have been deemed of phylogenetic significance. Smith's treatment of this issue is one of the more balanced ones that have been written. Yet, as he states and as I have recently emphasized (Stoner and Trinkaus 1981, Trinkaus n.d. a), once one accepts a role for the Neandertals in the ancestry of subsequent human populations, it is impossible to determine from the fossil record whether that role was a major one (implying little or no increase in levels of gene flow at the transition) or a minor one (implying a marked increase in gene flow at the transition). It may be more profitable for us to table the phylogenetic question and concentrate on deciphering the behavioral implications of the anatomical changes during the Upper Pleistocene and on how the biological alterations were interrelated with the behavioral shifts evident in the contemporaneous archeological record. In his descriptions of the relevant fossils Smith details aspects of both cranial and postcranial remains. Yet, in his descriptions and discussion, it is evident that craniofacial and dental characteristics are considered more important than postcranial ones. This is undoubtedly due in part to the fragmentary Vol. 23 * No. 6 * December 1982 691</page><page sequence="26">nature of all of the Central European Neandertal postcrania and the dearth of late Neandertal postcrania from this region. However, diagnostic portions of the postcrania are preserved for some of these individuals. Furthermore, analyses of Upper Pleistocene human postcrania (e.g., Endo and Kimura 1970; Musgrave 1971; Trinkaus 1976a, b, 1977, 1981, 1982, n.d. a, b; Lovejoy and Trinkaus 1980; Stoner and Trinkaus 1981; Vandermeersch 1981b) have shown that there are a number of significant differences between archaic and anatomically modern humans in limb and pelvic morphology across Europe and the Near East and that many of these postcranial features show little or none of the gradual change through time docu- mented by Smith and others (e.g., Frayer 1978; Brace 1979; Wolpoff 1979, 1980a, 1981; Smith and Ranyard 1980) for dental dimensions and aspects of the facial skeleton. These post- cranial features include pubic morphology, thumb phalangeal proportions, first carpometacarpal articular configurations, upper and lower limb segment proportions, and reflections of postcranial robusticity in the scapulae, humeri, ulnae, radii, hand bones, femora, patellae, tibiae, and pedal phalanges. Although the preserved Neandertal postcrania from South- Central Europe are insufficient by themselves to establish such a pattern for this geographical area, they fit best with the pattern evident in both Western Europe and the Near East of considerable morphological stasis in the postcrania during the time of the Neandertals with a marked shift at the transition to early anatomically modern humans. This interpretation is supported by the presence of anatomically modern morphologies in the postcrania from Mladec, Brno, Predmosti, and Pavlov (Szombathy 1925, Matiegka 1938, Jelinek et al. 1959, VIcek 1961a). If the nature of the transition were inferred primarily from the postcranium, one would probably reach a significantly different conclusion than is indicated by the cranial and dental remains alone. This suggests that human evolution was mosaic during the Upper Pleistocene-an inference that should not be surprising, since the behavioral complexes influencing the evolution of postcranial versus cranial anatomy were un- doubtedly evolving at different rates during this time period. For these reasons I believe that it is incumbent upon human paleontologists to use as much of the fossil record as is available for evolutionary interpretations. The exclusive use of a few anatomical complexes a priori denies the possibility of mosaic evolution and assumes that the anatomical region(s) best preserved in the fossil record is(are) representative of the evolutionary trends in the populations of organisms involved. Further discoveries of human fossil remains and additional analyses of the available specimens will help to clarify many of these questions and perhaps resolve some of the controversies surrounding the Neandertals. However, it is clear that it will no longer be possible to discuss the fate of the Neandertals and the origins of modern humans in Europe without reference to the Central European material. For that we should be thankful to Fred Smith. by KAREL VALOCH Moravian Museum, Anthropos Institute, Brno, Czechoslovakia. 3 v 82 I should like to add a few comments, based on results and ideas arising from new research, to Smith's archaeologically sound article. The sediment group that Musil and Valoch classified as Podhradem interstadial probably includes the Western Euro- pean Hengelo and Arcy. The hypothesis that the Szeletian derives directly from the Central European Micoquian is very well-founded and can be accepted as a certainty. The Upper Palaeolithic components of the Szeletian were taken over from the Aurignacian. A pure Aurignacian more than 40,000 years B.P. appears in Moravia as well as in Bulgaria (Baco Kiro). This puts it towards the end of the Lower Wiirm, prior to the Hengelo. Stratigraphically it is located in Vedrovice II of southern Moravia (Valoch and Oliva n.d.). Moreover, in Moravia there is an original, pre- viously unknown facies of the early Upper Palaeolithic (&gt;40,000 B.P.)-the Bohunician. Stratigraphically and on the basis of radiocarbon data it was first identified at the Cerveny Kopec brickworks in Brno-Bohunice and labelled Szeletian of the Levallois facies (Valoch 1976). It has more recently and con- vincingly been presented by Oliva (1981) as an independent group. One seldom finds leaf-points and never Aurignacian types alongside a dominant Levallois technology. The Szeletian (Valoch 1981) was probably significantly in- volved in the development of the Pavlovian. At Ganovce, the Middle Palaeolithic belongs to the so-called Taubachian, which, in my opinion, is very similar to the south- ern French Tayacian. The Ku'lna Neandertal remains date from the Central European Micoquian (formerly the Charentian of Micoquian tradition) from Level 7a, dated to 45,660 +2,850 -2,200 B.P. (GrN-6060) on a sample of burnt bone from the maxilla area. The lower complex (Level 11) contains a rich Taubachian industry (previously designated as Tayacian). Sipka is a facies of the typical Mousterian with many denticulated and notched forms. At the Cerveny Kopec brickworks, only the Bohunician was found, along with isolated Middle and Lower Palaeolithic artifacts. The site, however, is located quite a long way from the one demolished in 1885, and thus any identification of the Brno 1 skull with the Bohunician is improbable. However, a few years ago a late Gravettian (14,450 ? 90 [GrN-9350]; Valoch 1980) was found at the foot of Cerveny Kopec which could much more readily be connected with the skull. Brno 3 presents a stratigraphic problem. The geologist K. Zapletal wrote (in Absolon 1929:85): "The section of the site where the skeleton was found showed the transition of the gravels of the A-terrace, deposited on uralithic diabases, into arenaceous loam and loess loam.... The skeleton was found just at the contact between the sand and the coarse gravel, at a depth of 2.15 m." From this Zapletal concluded that the inhumation took place at the time of fluviatile accumulation. Today, of course, we know that the A-terrace (approx. 10 m above the present river meadow) belongs to the Riss, and this gives rise to an inexplicable discrepancy between the advanced morphology and the geological interpretation. Dzerava Skala Cave (formerly Palffy-Barlang) contained in one stratum Szeletian leaf-points and Aurignacian bone points which had been mixed together through cryoturbation. At Svitavka, there is only unidentified Upper Palaeolithic, no Aurignacian. by MICHAEL J. WALKER Department of Anthropology, University of Sydney, Sydney, N.S.W. 2006, Australia. 14 v 82 There is no doubt that the Central European evidence for a smooth transition not only from Neanderthal to modern man, but also from Mousterian to Upper Palaeolithic tools, is far better than any from Western Europe. Hints have long been present in Western writing on palaeoanthropology from Keith, McCurdy, and Morant to Coon, Brace, and Wolpoff, not to mention in articles and books in English, French, and German by Eastern European scientists such as Jelinek, Thoma, VIcek, and Vertes. Smith's article is a useful summary of the data, both old and new. It is perhaps to be regretted that it does not deal with Central European Middle Pleistocene hominid remains as well. This is because no less important than the matter of transition versus replacement within the Upper 692 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="27">Pleistocene is the matter of the origin of Neanderthal man and its relation to H. erectus; it has been argued in a recent research report in this journal (Cuenca and Walker 1980, and see Cuenca and Walker 1981 for statistical comparisons) that in Western Europe hominids which can variously be called atypical H. erectus, ante-Neanderthals, or archaic H. sapiens are quite widespread, some of which are perhaps as near to later, modern H. sapiens as they are to Neanderthal, notwith- standing their late Middle Pleistocene age. If, indeed, the Krapina crania are as early as Smith and many other palaeo- anthropologists feel, then their breadth perhaps has its parallel in Fontechevade and the Alicante object (ectocast?), which in other respects are hard to reconcile with classic Neanderthal forms. Perhaps a degree of lability or heterogeneity existed during the penultimate glacial and the last interglacial. If Krapina is, indeed, last interglacial or very early in the last glacial, the occurrence of Carabelli's cusps (a "European" characteristic of modern craniology) is also intriguing; it is less so if the Krapina collection is Neanderthal-Upper Palaeolithic transitional in nature, of course. What all this boils down to is that one of the most important Neanderthal collections known (and probably the most important from Europe) cannot be properly dated. Whatever the stratigraphic care with which recent excavations have been conducted in Central Europe, this awkward lacuna in our knowledge cannot be overcome. Indeed, there is a conspicuous dearth of radiometric dates even from some of these other, more recently excavated sites. This is reflected in the vagueness of the chronology ("Riss-Wurm," "Early Wiirm," "Lower Wurm stadial," etc.), which looks very amateurish compared with Western European schemes. In short, there is much that is usefully summarized in this review, but one feels that it might have addressed itself to a wider range of problems and to the formulation of an agenda for their future investigation rather than contenting itself with arguing a position most people have long since come to accept. by MILFORD H. WOLPOFF Department of Anthropology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Mich. 48109, U.S.A. 15 VI 82 Smith's overview of hominid evolution in the Upper Pleistocene of South-Central Europe could not have come at a more appropriate time. The demonstration of a Western European Neandertal associated with the Chatelperronian at Saint-Cesaire has set the stage for reevaluation of the European Neandertals as potential ancestors of modern European populations (Wol- poff 1981), and South-Central Europe is a critical region for testing the competing hypotheses. Moreover, this region has also provided new evidence bearing on these hypotheses. Vindija Cave in Croatia has yielded what is probably the best case of a transitional sample spanning the supposedly distinct morphologies of European Neandertals and early modern populations (Wolpoff et al. 1981). Yet, excepting Vindija, this review deals with specimens and sites that have been known for a long time. Why this region has been systematically ignored in virtually all considerations of Upper Pleistocene European hominid evolution may be of as much interest to historians of science as the Neandertal problem is to paleoanthropologists. Smith's review is both sufficiently broad and detailed and suitably cautious. My comments should be taken as supple- mentary and mainly concern some thoughts regarding the fate of the Neandertals and the origin of the more modern popula- tions in this region. Mladec, in my view, is one of the critical sites in the European Upper Pleistocene sequence, and the fact that it has been completely ignored in the development of European paleo- anthropology must surely be one of the great historic mysteries of our field. Szombathy's (1925) publication was relatively complete and well illustrated for the time, and the fact that it Smith: HOMINID EVOLUTION IN SOUTH-CENTRAL EUROPE was written in German made it accessible to most Western European and American scholars. Yet, with rare exceptions, beginning with Morant (1930) the specimens are usually com- pletely ignored or, when mentioned, only the females are dealt with. "Mladec man" would have been so much more appropriate than "Cro-Magnon man" as the appellation for the earliest European modern sapiens population, and one wonders how the Neandertal problem would have developed had this been the case. As Smith points out, the Mladec material is not Neandertal. Yet, the approach of morphological details to the Neandertal condition is even closer than he indicates, including in addition to the points he mentions the extraordinarily marked midfacial prognathism that is indicated by the projection of the upper face and the small mastoids that seem to characterize most of the truly early European modern sapiens. The Mladec 1 female has a facial size that is a reasonable match for the Cro- Magnon 1 male's, an indication of the amount of facial reduc- tion that took place within the European early Upper Paleo- lithic. Moreover, the Mlade'c morphology also appears at Zlaty Kui0ni, in the Brno 2 male, and in the Brno 1 and Velika Pecina females. This early sample cannot be simply written off as extraordinarily robust Europeans, with characters that may "seem" Neandertal-like because they are more robust than the modern condition. The fact is that variation in supraorbital morphology, total facial prognathism (indicated by the nasion projection and retromolar space), frequency of lambdoidal flattening and actual occipital bunning, nasal breadth, ex- panded canine size, and small mastoids specifically approach the European Neandertal condition as a complex. This complex does not resemble any other alleged ancestral population such as Skhull/Qafzeh or Border Cave. Regional candidates for the ancestors of this early sample do not seem to be lacking. The Neandertals of South-Central Europe show clear evolutionary trends in the modern direction; as Smith discusses, the presence of these trends can be ascer- tained from the sequence of the relevant sites and does not depend on the (somewhat more problematic) absolute dates. The late remains from Vindija Cave provide as transitional a sample as one could hope to find. It seems to me that by itself this evidence should be sufficient to disprove the contention of significant population movement or other forms of gene flow from outside of Europe as a con- tributing factor to the appearance of modern European popula- tions. What model could account for the appearance of a gradual transition in South-Central Europe, close to the alleged source of "invading genes," but the complete replace- ment of one distinct population by another farther from this alleged source? On the other hand, these data could support the contention that modern Europeans evolved in South-Central Europe and then invaded the west. This would limit the replacement model to the western fringes of the continent. Whether or not such an idea can be sustained depends on the further reanalysis of evolutionary trends in Western Europe, and these were not the focus of this survey. However, I concur with Smith's contention that the Western Neandertals show the same evolutionary trends and that what is lacking in this region is the truly early modern populations whose analysis might resolve the problem in this region as well. Yet, given the likeli- hood that population replacements and gene flow are normal events in the human evolutionary process, one wonders how small the region of Neandertal replacement must become before it can be said that as a general process the origin of modern Europeans can be found mainly in the European Neandertals. Vol. 23 * No. 6 - December 1982 693</page><page sequence="28">Reply by FRED H. SMITH Knoxville, Tenn., U.S.A. 26 vii 82 I am grateful to my colleagues for their well-reasoned comments and criticisms. A number of the commentators (e.g., Allsworth- Jones, Harrold, Luchterhand, Valoch) provide welcome addi- tional information (some new, some overlooked by me) on archaeological and other matters in which their expertise far exceeds mine. All raise interesting and significant issues, and I shall endeavor to address each. Archaeology and chronology. Largely on the basis of Kukla's assessment (1968) of the stratigraphy at the Podhradem Cave, Stringer and Allsworth-Jones raise problems with the use of Musil and Valoch's Podhradem interstadial. Kukla demon- strates reasonable doubt that the section (Layers 8-18) desig- nated as Podhradem interstadial-Wuirm 1/2 in the original report (Valoch 1965b)-represents a single unit. Layers 8 and 9 could represent, on the basis of flora and fauna, either the end of an interstadial or the beginning of a stadial. Further- more, Kukla suggests that the radiocarbon dates from Level 8 (listed as Podhradem A in table 1) are contaminated (but see Valoch's reply). The sparse lithic material from Levels 8 and 9 is clearly Upper Paleolithic but otherwise rather undiagnos- tic-although Valoch (1965a:98-103) believes it is probably early. Despite the problems, it is unlikely that these levels correspond to the Denekamp as Allsworth-Jones suggests. An upper unit at Podhradem correlates better with Denekamp on the basis of, among other things, an unquestioned radiocarbon date and is separated by a unit indicative of a stadial from the complex assigned to the Podhradem, including Levels 8 and 9 (Musil 1965a). Furthermore, the suggestion that some material has been redeposited and mixed with that from significantly older or younger levels has already been refuted (Valoch 1968: 368; see also Musil 1965b). It is also probably true that the other levels at Podhradem Cave (10-18) assigned to the Podhradem interstadial in 1965 do not represent a single climatic period. Thus the site stratigraphy at Podhradem un- questionably needs to be reinterpreted in light of the more complex picture of the Wuirm obtained since 1965. However, the presence of a ca. 40,000 B.P. interstadial is documented at several other sites in the region. Even Allsworth-Jones and Stringer do not seem to doubt its existence. Therefore I see no reason the term Podhradem should not be used in the sense of Musil and Valoch's (1966) original designation. Valoch does indeed recognize two interstadials, equivalent to the Denekamp and the Hengelo; but Stringer's statement of this fact makes it seem that Valoch considers both to be en- compassed by the Podhradem. This is not true. Valoch clearly equates Denekamp with Stillfried B and only Hengelo with Podhradem. He reaffirms the Podhradem-Hengelo equivalence in his comment on this paper. Both Allsworth-Jones and Stringer also question the context of the bone point from Vindija G1 and the assignment of this level to the Aurignacian on that basis. I agree that it should be viewed with caution and that the point might actually derive from Level Fd/d, but the cryoturbation reported at Vindija is not from the part of the cave where the point and its possibly associated hominids were excavated. Thus it is un- likely that this material was redeposited and mixed from widely allochronic levels. Allsworth-Jones also notes discrepancies in the Vindija stratigraphy between the 1975 (actually also 1978) and 1981 reports. These are due to two factors: (1) the addi- tional stratigraphic information collected in the late '70s (which also resulted in the redesignation of some strata) and (2) the determination that the cultural material in Complex G was not Szeletian (see Wolpoff et al. 1981 :501). To the revised radiocarbon dates for Salzgitter-Lebenstedt and Tata (Allsworth-Jones) can be added indications from uranium series dates that the Mousterian at the latter site may be in excess of 100,000 years old (Schwarcz and Skoflek 1982). The radiocarbon date for the Kfilna Neandertal (Valoch, Allsworth-Jones) provides further confirmation that the "pro- gressive" Neandertals in South-Central Europe are indeed relatively later and provides chronometric anchoring for the Lower Wuirm stadial. These dates contribute to a firmer chronological framework for the Mousterian in South-Central Europe. My stratigraphic discussion for Vainura's hominid fragments from Svedfiv Stful placed them in the "brown earth complex" which encompasses all five of the layers mentioned by Alls- worth-Jones. If these finds do correspond to Level 2 (probably Riss-Wiirm in age), and if the Ochoz mandible can be inferred to come from the same level, it would even more clearly place all the Svedfiv Stiul hominid material in the early Neandertal group. However, neither Vlcek (1969) nor Klima (Klima et al. 1962) is certain of the mandibles' stratigraphic position. My statements on the problems at Subalyuk (discounted by Allsworth-Jones) were based on comments by several colleagues in Central Europe. If they are wrong and Allsworth-Jones is right, the stratigraphic position of the hominid finds would also be more securely placed before the Lower Wiirm stadial and the late Neandertal group. I was not aware of the criticisms noted by Allsworth-Jones regarding the correlation of Stratum 9 at Sipka, the strati- graphic level of the child's mandible, with the Podhradem interstadial. If Maska's faunal Horizon IV is "early Wiirm" (which is disputed by Musil [1965a: 133-34]), then the strati- graphically younger Horizon III, including Stratum 9, would be more recent. Whether it corresponds to a stadial in the "later Wurm" or the Podhradem interstadial does not in my view affect the grouping of the Sipka specimen with the late Ne- andertals. It should be noted that the fauna from Sipka was marked by Maska only with the number of the faunal horizon (I, II, III, IV), not with a stratum number. Musil's analysis of the complete faunal samples attributed to each complex indicated to him that each horizon contains fauna representing different climatic conditions. In spite of this, he believes that Horizon III is characteristically Wuirm 1/2 (Podhradem) and that Horizon IV may be of the same age (Musil 1965a: 134). In lumping the hominids from Krapina, Subalyuk, Ochoz, and Ganovce together as an early Neandertal group, I did not intend to imply (as it apparently seemed to Musil) that they were contemporaries, but only that they chronologically pre- ceded the Lower Wurm and the late Neandertal group. Also, the association of a steppe (not Merck's) rhinoceros with the gala frontal (a minor point, since both are found well into the first half of the Wuirm in parts of Europe [Kurten 1968]) does not invalidate the dating of the hominid zone at Krapina to the Riss-Wiirm or an interstadial in the Early Wurm. This dating is based on the total stratigraphic sequence at Krapina, which has been discussed in detail by Malez. It would be impossible to fit the complex sequence (see Malez 1978b) into the available time if the hominid zone were not so dated, and nothing in the faunal evidence disputes this (Malez 1970b, 1978b). Thus, Stringer and Walker to the contrary, there is no reason to question a relatively early date for the Krapina hominid zone material. Of course, a few of the Krapina hominids (e.g., Cranium A) are substantially more recent than the hominid zone. I do not believe that the Mladec cultural material is best compared to Podhradem Level 8 (Allsworth-Jones), primarily because of the paucity of lithic remains from both sites and the absence of Mladec points and other bone tools in the latter. The fact that the archaeological association of the Zlaty K7'u specimen is possibly with the Aurignacian (Allsworth-Jones) rather than possibly with the Szeletian does not necessarily alter Vlcek's chronological position for the specimen. Valoch's indication that Brno 1 is perhaps only 14,500 years old means 694 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="29">it should possibly be removed from the early Upper Paleolithic sample. It is one of the more gracile specimens in this sample, and omitting it would tip the balance further in favor of mor- phological continuity between early modern and late archaic H. sapiens in this region. The same could also be said if Brno 3 and Svitavka are not necessarily early Upper Paleolithic specimens (Valoch), although neither is used in any metric analysis here. In my opinion, the revised cultural terminology (Valoch, Allsworth-Jones) does not affect the issues under discussion in this paper, but it is unfortunate that I did not use it where appropriate. Also, it is not necessary that every site (e.g., Baco Kiro [Allsworth-Jones]) exhibit evidence of indigenous Middle-to-Upper Paleolithic transition for the proposed techno- logical continuum to be demonstrated. There are clearly problems with the Upper Pleistocene chronology of South-Central Europe and with the application of the Musil-Valoch scheme to the area as a whole. Many of these problems, which are also encountered in other areas of Europe, are probably for the most part insurmountable on the basis of present knowledge. There is always the possibility of stratigraphic hiatuses, inadequate floral and faunal data, mixing of allochronic materials, and a host of other sources of error in any attempt to correlate chronological units over a large area. All one can do is strive to be consistent and make maximum use of the information available. The Musil-Valoch scheme may well prove too simple, but as things stand it is the best framework available. Furthermore, our present under- standing of chronology in this region is, I think, precise enough to allow establishment of the three chronological groups of hominids defined in this study. No point has been raised that unequivocally challenges these general groups or their relative chronological sequence. However, there is no denying the need for additional information, particularly from chronometric dating, to anchor and clarify the sequence. Fossil hominid morphology. Brace is correct that nasal breadth measurements are impossible on Crania C and E (museum numbers 3 and 6 respectively). My discussion of nasal breadth was based on Maxillae C and E (museum num- bers 47 and 49 respectively). I could have avoided this confusion by including the museum numbers in the text. The estimate for Maxilla C is not included in table 4 because it exhibits a mixed dentition, an unequivocal indication of subadulthood. My own analysis of Krapina Frontal 23 indicates that the sinus does not extend superiorly into the squama above the level where the torus roof emerges. To my mind this does not constitute ex- tension into the squama. I believe this is more a difference in interpretation and definition than a disagreement on what the specimen really exhibits. Walker suggests that the presence of Carabelli's cusps in the Krapina dentition is unusual if the collection is as early as Riss-Wiirm or an Early Wurm interstadial. First of all, the "cusps," which are common in Krapina upper molars, would in most cases be considered little more than a "trace" com- pared with modern European dentitions (see Cadien 1972, Weidenreich 1937). Furthermore, such features are not rare in other European Neandertals when wear has not proceeded to the point of obliterating them (e.g., Gregory 1922, Sakura 1970). The youth of most Krapina specimens results in rela- tively high preservation of the feature in the sample. Also, Carabelli-like features have been found in even earlier hominid samples than Neandertals (Tobias 1967). Thus I do not con- sider their presence in the Krapina sample particularly signifi- cant. It is true that Choukoutien posterior teeth are smaller than those from Krapina (Brace), but in general early archaic H. sapiens in Europe (Arag6, Krapina, Ehringsdorf) exhibit posterior tooth sizes intermediate between those of H. erectus and those of later European archaic H. sapiens. I agree with Howells, Stringer, and Harrold that a combina- Smith: EOMINID EVOLUTION IN SOUTH-CENTRAL EUROPE tion of fragmentary specimens and individual biases can influence one's assessment of fossil remains. There is no way we can know for certain what the morphology of unrepresented cranial or postcranial elements may be. Perhaps if we had complete crania for Vindija or other late South-Central Euro- pean Neandertals, the evidence for a morphological continuum might not be so obvious, but this is a moot point. We must evaluate morphological patterns on the basis of what is present and available for study. I think the evidence for "progressive" morphology in the Vindija hominids is compelling. Their transitional status is suggested not on the basis of one feature or one specimen, but on the strength of a complex of features common to the sample as a whole. Stringer offers as a possible example of bias the estimation of nasal breadth, suggesting that the breadths given for Kfilna and the Vindija maxillae may not be equivalent to maximum nasal breadth of Neandertals and early modern H. sapiens. In my own experience (see also Martin and Saller 1956:475), maximum nasal breadth is encountered at a level no higher than the inferior third of the piriform aperture. Both Kfilna and Vindija 259 preserve enough of the inferior-lateral aperture border to make me reasonably certain that they could not have been more than slightly broader, if at all, than the mea- surements given in table 4. The curvature of the lateral aperture border in 259 (see Wolpoff et al. 1981:fig. 2) is clearly not broadening at its highest point. It is difficult to believe that' this specimen does not preserve the level of its maximum nasal breadth. Vindija 225 does not preserve as much of the inferior-lateral aperture border, but its curvature is very similar to that of 259. Therefore, 225 has a higher probability of having an underestimated nasal breadth than the other two specimens, but if underestimated it is only by a minute amount. That these features are just part of allowable Neandertal variation, due to an overabundance of juveniles and females in the sample, as Stringer suggests is highly unlikely. There is no evidence of greater representation of females and juveniles at Vindija than at Krapina (Smith 1976b, Smith and Ranyard 1980, Wolpoff et al. 1981) yet Vindija clearly exhibits the progressive trends. For this reason, I also do not see the logic in Stringer's assertion that the Vindija material should be compared only with female early modern H. sapiens. Boaz expresses disappointment that I did not discuss the "Neandertal cranium" from Podbaba, which was discovered in 1883 in what is now a part of Prague. I omitted it mainly because of the questions regarding its antiquity summarized in Matiegka (1924:1-2). Basically, no one is certain what the context of the cranium is. Vlcek (1956) attributes it to either the Wiirm 2 (Middle Wiirm) stadial or Wiirm 2/3 (Stillfried B) interstadial and places it in association with late Aurignacian tools, but he does not include it in his 1971 list. It is, how- ever, an interesting specimen and deserves some consideration. The cranium, destroyed during a casting attempt in 1921, exhibits a low frontal with a supraorbital morphology similar to that of the more robust specimens of early modern H. sapiens in Czechoslovakia. It was these two features which led Fric to describe the find as a Neandertal in 1885. In fact, the presence of a robust supraorbital region and low cranial vault led to suggestions of considerable antiquity for many specimens during this period (Hrdlicka 1907). However, Schaafhausen and later Matiegka (1924) noted that Podbaba's parietal vaulting and other features were more advanced than in Ne- andertals and suggested that it was intermediate between Neandertals and more modern humans. In the most detailed morphological assessment of the specimen, Vlcek (1956) demonstrates that Podbaba's total morphological pattern securely aligns it with the early modern H. sapiens remains from South-Central Europe. That Podbaba is not a Neandertal Vol. 23 * No. 6 * December 1982 695</page><page sequence="30">can be clearly seen in the available photographs (Matiegka 1924:pl. 1 and 2; Vlcek 1956:pl. 2 and 3). I do not underestimate the possible significance of the molar from Dzervana Skala (Palffy) (Allsworth-Jones), but it is virtually impossible to extract useful information, in a phylo- genetic sense, from a single tooth or even several loose teeth. The teeth of Neandertals and early modern H. sapiens are not all that different, and the presence of a large anterior fovea is not necessarily significant in this regard. What is needed are some more complete hominid specimens in association with the Szeletian. I agree completely with Wolpoff's assessment of the signifi- cance of the Mladec sample, including the presence of rather marked upper facial prognathism in comparison with late Upper Paleolithic hominids. Contrary to Stringer, I have not failed to point out (see also Spencer and Smith 1981) the con- siderable differences in overall cranial form between Neander- tals and the majority of early modern H. sapiens. I have stressed the similarities, particularly in the Mladec sample, because they have generally been overlooked. As for the anomalous pattern of mastoid morphology to which Stringer refers, I am of the opinion that the gracile mastoids of Neandertals are to a certain extent an illusion. Neandertal mastoids appear not to project markedly because of the relatively low position of the nuchal plane and the remarkable development of the occipitomastoid crest. Thus, when mastoid projection is measured from the cranial base (digastric sulcus), Neandertals do yield markedly smaller average values than modern H. sapiens (see table 5). However, if one measures mastoid projection from a fixed point on the cranial vault-porion, for example-there is virtually no TABLE 5 MEASUREMENTS ON THE MASTOID PROCESS IN NEANDERTALS AND MODERN H. sapiens MASTOID PROJECTION (FROM PORION- DIGASTRIC MASTOIDALE SULCUS) HEIGHT Neandertalsa X (0) ....................... 6.7 (2.5) 32.6 (4.2) Range ...................... 3.0-11.3 26.0-39.0 N ...................... 22 18 Mlade6 1 (9) ....................... 11.0 32.0 2 (9) ....................... 5.1 31.0 5 (e) ....................... 8.7 34.3 Brno 2 (e) .................... 11.0 34.0 ZlatY KoU'n (c?) ................ 5.4 31.2 Pavlov (e) .................... 16.8 39.6 Dolni Vstonice (9) ............ 5.5 28.0 Early modern H. sapiensa X (0f) ....................... 9.1 (3.9) 32.9 (3.4) Range ...................... 5.1-16.8 28.0-39.6 N ...................... 7 7 Arikaraa X (o) ....................... 9.1 (2.6) 30.2 (3.1) Range ...................... 3.9-14.4 23.2-40.0 N ....................... 99 99 Arikara (e) X (a) ....................... 10.6 (2.1) 32.0 (2.6) Range ...................... 6.4-14.4 27.7-40.0 N ........................ 48 48 Arikara ( 9 ) X (0) ....................... 7.7 (2.2) 28.5 (2.5) Range ........................ 3.9-13.2 23.2-34.0 N ............ 51 51 SOURCES: Neandertals and Arikara.

Further, Neandertals, like modern humans, exhibit considerable variation in mastoid projection and overall size, with some specimens (e.g., Krapina 38-2) closely approaching the modern H. sapiens form (Smith 1976b, Zobeck 1980). I believe (see also Zobeck 1980) that the mastoid acts as an extension of the nuchal plane, functioning primarily as a muscle attachment area and positioner (for the sternocleido- mastoids and splenius capitis). In Neandertals, I suggest that the presence of a large, more horizontal, and relatively lower nuchal plane required only a moderate projection of the mastoid, probably to position the sternocleidomastoid muscles for turning and "flexing" the cranium. With the reduction and more vertical positioning of the nuchal plane, the mastoid was retained at relatively the same level in order to maintain the position of the sternocleidomastoids and perhaps for other reasons. This model is reasonable whether the causal factor in nuchal plane reduction is changes in the timing of brain growth (Trinkaus and LeMay 1982) or changes in the demands on the nuchal muscles relative to dental function (Wolpoff 1980a). In this regard it is interesting that the Mladec 5 male exhibits rather less mastoid projection, measured from the digastric sul- cus, than the Pavlov male, which is probably at least 7,000 years younger. The female pattern is not so clear, with Mladec 1 exhibiting a high value for mastoid projection. The porion- mastoidale height remains virtually constant in all cases. Thus the differences in mastoid morphology may not be ill that significant a difficulty for the continuity model. Stringer also raises the question of occipital torus develop- ment, which is marked in many early modern H. sapiens specimens. I have not dealt with this feature in any detail, but I suspect its marked development in early modern H. sapiens also relates to changes in the orientation of the nuchal and occipital planes and alterations in the dissipation of stresses produced by the muscles affected by these changes. The scope of the paper. I believe my reasons for focusing on South-Central Europe are clear and rational. Concentrating on one region will not, of course, resolve the issue of the archaic- to-modern-H. sapiens transition. On the other hand, discus- sions of the issue on a continentwide or worldwide basis cannot be fruitful unless based on reasonably detailed studies of more geographically localized samples and trends. For this reason, I disagree with Stringer's assertion that geographical proximity is an inadequate rationale for the selection of the sample forming the central focus of this study. Specific and more general studies are equally important, but I do not think it is fair to expect a single paper to cover every possible issue on both levels. For example, Walker believes that I should address a wider range of problems rather than arguing a position almost everyone has accepted for a long time (i.e., morphological continuity in South-Central Europe), but the various comments on this paper demonstrate that the second part of his statement is simply not the case. Furthermore, I did put South-Central Europe into some perspective by discussing patterns in three adjacent regions. There is always more to be done, but I believe that consideration of even a "wider range of problems" was beyond the scope of this paper. Walker, Stringer, and Howells argue that I should have considered the origin of the Neandertals. I did not do so be- cause there appears to be little doubt that the Neandertal morphological pattern develops gradually in Europe through the Mindel/Riss and Riss (Trinkaus and Howells 1979, Wolpoff 1980a). Furthermore, a number of recent considerations of this material are available (e.g., Stringer et al. 1979, Wolpoff 1980b). Thus, while this earlier material is important as a foundation for discussion of the Neandertal-modern H. sapiens transition issue in Europe, I believe the foundation is adequately provided elsewhere. Walker suggests that the Alicante and Fontechevade specimens are hard to reconcile with "classic Neanderthal forms." I cannot figure out what the Alicante specimen is, so I cannot comment on it. However, studies by Sergi (1962), 696 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="31">Brace (1964), and Corruccini (1975) have shown that Fonteche- vade 2 is not morphologically distinguishable from Neandertals, and Wolpoff (1980a) has demonstrated that it fits perfectly well into a single Middle/Upper Pleistocene European lineage. Fontechevade 2, in fact, in most ways makes a nice fit for the Bilzingsleben occipital. Fontechevade 1 would appear not to be contemporary with Fontechevade 2 and probably derives from more recent deposits. I agree with Stringer that the Saccopastore crania are very significant and that comparison of them with the Krapina remains would be valuable. I have not studied the Sacco- pastore crania, but the available data do not indicate to me any great difference between the Krapina and Saccopastore crania, particularly when it is recognized that the less complete male (Saccopastore 2) is more robust than the more commonly pictured female (Saccopastore 1). Metrically, they compare well with other Neandertals (see, for example, Wolpoff 1980a: 313), and where comparisons are possible the females Sacco- pastore 1 and Krapina C are very similar, except that the former appears to have had a broader nose. Unfortunately, the supraorbital torus of Saccopastore 1 is lacking, and this helps give the impression of a higher cranial vault than in Krapina C (when in fact that of Krapina C is probably slightly higher). However, the Saccopastore posterior teeth (P4-M3) do tend to fall toward the small end of the Krapina range. Although a more detailed consideration is desirable, I see nothing in the comparison of Saccopastore and Krapina that calls for altera- tions of my assessment of the latter sample's evolutionary relationships. Models and trends. Holmes once informed Watson that "when you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth." It seems to me that, for the past 50 years or so, the majority of human paleontolo- gists have virtually excluded as impossible the idea that Ne- andertals might have played a significant role in the emergence of modern Europeans. (There are, of course, notable exceptions, from Hrdlicka and Weidenreich to Brace and Wolpoff.) What I have tried to demonstrate is that this possibility should not be so readily excluded. I did not prove, nor did I claim to, that modern Europeans evolved from Neandertals in the absence of external factors, but I have illustrated, at least in South- Central Europe, both a change over time in Neandertal mor- phology (clearly in the direction of modern H. sapiens) and a complex of features in early modern H. sapiens which strongly suggests a Neandertal component in their ancestry. To my mind, this argues for some degree of genetic as well as morpho- logical continuity. However, Howells and Stringer suggest that many of these Neandertal-reminiscent features in early modern South- Central Europeans (bunning, supraorbital development, etc.) are simply reflecting their continued robusticity. Stringer further suggests that concentrating on changes in these features is "merely illustrating loss of primitive features generally distributed in Middle and early Upper Pleistocene hominids." I agree that the transition to modern H. sapiens is essentially the result of a reduction process. It has been demonstrated, however, that the specific pattern of the transition varies in different areas of the Old World (Wolpoff 1980a). Thus the emergence of modern Australians and that of modern Africans are both the result of reduction or "gracilization" from in- digenous archaic H. sapiens, but the degree and patterning of reduction are quite different (see Howell 1978, Thorne and Wolpoff 1981). I believe the pattern of reduction in areas such as occipital bunning, the supraorbital region, and other aspects of the face is characteristic for Europe. For example, although occipital bunning is not restricted to Neandertals or to Upper Pleistocene European hominids (Trinkaus and LeMay 1982), European Neandertals exhibit well-developed occipital bunning with a higher frequency than any other roughly contemporary sample Smith: HOMINID EVOLUTION IN SOUTH-CENTRAL EUROPE of early Upper Pleistocene hominids. In the Near East it is debatable whether any Neandertal possesses a bun, and at best bunning is only weakly developed, even in the robust Shanidar 1 specimen (Trinkaus n.d.b). Occipital bunning is also quite common and well-developed among early modern Europeans, although it takes a slightly different form than in Neandertals. I know of no other early modern sample that can come close to matching the Europeans in frequency or degree of development of bunning. For example, the Skhful-Qafzeh group exhibits no evidence of bunning. Whether one regards bunning as the result of differences in the timing of brain growth (Trinkaus and LeMay 1982) or as an adaptation to increasing nuchal muscle efficiency (Brose and Wolpoff 1971, Smith 1976b, Wolpoff 1980a), it is almost certainly under genetic control. This means that the alleles which influence the development of bunning are present in relatively high frequencies in both European Neandertals and early modern Europeans and in much lower frequencies in other samples. While it is possible that modern peoples moving into Europe might have quickly undergone an increase in frequency and salience of bunning, it is difficult to imagine what factors might have brought this about. Of course, perhaps the colonizers come from some hitherto unknown source population in which bunning was common, but such a con- tingency is beyond our ability to evaluate. Thus I believe that the similarities in pattern, extent, and frequency of bunning between Neandertals and early modern H. sapiens in Europe indicate a considerable genetic continuity between these two hominid types, especially in South-Central Europe. Further- more, as far as I am aware, the specific pattern of supraorbital torus reduction documented in South-Central Europe (Smith and Ranyard 1980), most notably midorbital thinning, is un- like that in southern Africa or the Near East. Thus, on the basis of these and other factors, I believe there is sufficient evidence to allow for the recognition of a European "clade" on the basis of the morphological continuum in the features discussed above and in the text. The question of whether we are, or should be, dealing with "derived" features in the Hennigian sense is not an easy one, because just what constitutes a "derived" feature is difficult to determine (see Wolpoff 1980a: 33-34). Howells, Trinkaus, and Stringer all criticize to some degree my failure to consider postcranial remains in discussions of trends. I did not intend to imply that the cranium was more significant than the postcranium for assessment of evolutionary pattern, and I certainly do not feel that I in any way denied that human evolution is a mosaic process. In South-Central Europe, there are virtually no late Neandertal postcrania, and the material available is not very informative (only the Vindija scapula has any diagnostic morphology); thus, as Trinkaus recognizes, discussing trends in this sample is not really possible. However, even the earliest modern H. sapiens material (e.g., Mladec), which exhibits the most Neandertal-reminiscent cranial morphology, appears completely modern in post- cranial morphology. In Western Europe and particularly in the Near East (Trinkaus n.d.b), no pattern of change over time in Neandertal postcrania has been documented, and the differences in postcranial morphology between Neandertals and the earliest available modern H. sapiens are marked. Most of these differences are related to robusticity, as Trinkaus and others have demonstrated, and in most features Neandertals do not fall completely out of the range of modern H. sapiens. It has been suggested (Wolpoff 1980a) that many of these may represent differences in developmental responses to reduced stress during the growth period in modern H. sapiens, brought about by cultural and behavioral factors. I am inclined to accept this explanation, especially in light of our knowledge on the plasticity of the postcranial skeleton in H. s. sapiens. Vol. 23 * No. 6 * December 1982 697</page><page sequence="32">The same may be true for possible indicators of cold adap- tation (e.g., limb proportions), although Trinkaus (1981) has made a case that some degree of gene flow into Europe is perhaps the more logical explanation for these differences. However, even if this is the case, it does not prove the absence of considerable genetic continuity in Europe. Furthermore, if the modern morphology evolved in a more southerly region, where is the population from which it originated? If the Near Eastern Neandertals represent that source, then we have the same problems of derivation as have just been discussed for Europe. There is virtually no information on the postcranial morphology of Upper Pleistocene Asian and African archaic H. sapiens, so it is impossible at present to document an earlier derivation of modern postcranial morphology from either of these two regions. In Africa, apparently modern postcranial fragments, not yet described, are associated with Omo 1 from the Kibish Formation (Howell 1978), but the geological an- tiquity attributed to this specimen is very questionable (Howell 1978:216). Future discoveries and information, perhaps from new sites and different geographic regions, may reveal such a source, but we must be concerned at present only with the data available now. Stringer and Boaz suggest Africa as the point of origin for modern H. sapiens. Boaz is particularly certain that modern H. sapiens has greater antiquity in Africa than in Europe, and Stringer asserts that the Skhuil-Qafzeh hominids indicate the presence of modern H. sapiens in the Near East earlier than in Europe. If all of the maximum suggested ages for the critical material (e.g., Border Cave, Klasies River Mouth 1, Omo- Kibish, Qafzeh, Skhfil) are correct, one could envision a clinal pattern of the spread of modern H. sapiens from southern Africa through the Near East to Central and finally Western Europe. As attractive a model as this may be to some (myself included to a certain extent), I think there are several problems with it. In the first place, while there are certainly problems with dating and chronology of the Upper Pleistocene in Europe, there are far more in Africa. For example, the Omo-Kibish remains cited earlier are generally considered to date in excess of 100,000 years. But, as Howell (1978) points out, this is open to considerable debate. I have also noted here and elsewhere (Spencer and Smith 1981) my reservations regarding the context of the Border Cave remains, and similar reservations are expressed by Howell, except for the Border Cave 5 mandible. I believe there may be taphonomic problems with its context as well. It is also interesting that the Fish Hoek specimen, which I believe was partially responsible for creating the impression of considerable antiquity for very modern morphology in southern Africa, is now considered to be not 30,000 years old but likely Holocene in age (Rightmire 1978). For the Near East, Jelinek (1982) has already refuted the faunal evidence used by Vandermeersch to suggest an early date (ca. 75,000 years) for Qafzeh. Contrary to Stringer, Jelinek's lithic analysis suggests that Qafzeh and Skhal are younger than the chimney deposits at Taban and thus not necessarily just "marginally younger" than Tabuin C. It may be that amino-acid racemization dating will resolve the issue, but given the documented problems with the technique, particularly in regard to the dating of early American remains (Smith 1977, Bischoff and Rosenbauer 1981), I think we should heed the advice of Protsch (1976) and treat suspiciously the results of amino-acid dates not confirmed by collagen (or other) dates. Thus at present a late date (40,000 to 35,000 or even 30,000 years) would seem at least as defensible as an early one (70,000-80,000 years). It is possible, however, that the future will prove all of these objections to be false and confirm the clinal pattern discussed previously. In this case, I would be much more inclined to view gene flow into Europe as a major, possibly catalytic, aspect of the archaic-modern H. sapiens transition in South-Central Europe. I agree with Trinkaus that it is difficult to know if gene flow played a minor or a major causal role. However, no matter to what extent gene flow is involved, the nature of the morphological continuum in South-Central Europe demon- strates considerable genetic continuity between Neandertals and early modern H. sapiens, at least in this area of Europe. (As I stated and as Stringer, Harrold, and Boaz note, morpho- logical continuity is not so clear in Western Europe.) To my mind, this means that the transition in Europe had at least a very significant "indigenous" component. In fact, I continue to maintain that, without proof of an earlier date for modern H. sapiens in surrounding regions (see above), there is no reason to assume that gene flow into Europe was any more involved in the transition there than gene flow from Europe was involved in the transition in surrounding regions. Thus, gene flow, even if extensive, may very well function more as a modulator than as a catalyst in Upper Pleistocene hominid evolution (e.g., Thorne and Wolpoff 1981). Despite the interesting paleoclimatological model discussed by Boaz to explain the surging of modern H. sapiens into Europe (Boaz, Ninkovich, and Rossignol-Strick 1982), I see no evidence in the South-Central European fossil record to support "genetic swamping" and actual population replace- ment. If this were the case, one should see at least some evidence of the contemporaneity of non-European-like modern H. sapiens and Neandertals in either South-Central or South- eastern Europe. There is none at present, although the Baco Kiro hominid material (which I have not seen) could con- ceivably change the picture. (Also, much of Bulgaria, Turkey, Greece, and eastern Yugoslavia are poorly known from a paleoanthropological perspective.) At this point, I believe it is the concept of complete population replacement, not that of in situ transition, which is the most "extreme" of the hypotheses suggested to explain the origin of modern Europeans (at least in South-Central Europe). Boaz notes that my discussion does not explain why Ne- andertals are found only in Europe and adjoining areas. I believe that it is because the combined action of (1) the morpho- logical and underlying genetic makeup of the initial hominids to populate Europe, western Asia, and North Africa, (2) the nature of local selective forces, and (3) the modulating effects of gene flow between populations in adjacent geographical regions (for details, see Thorne and Wolpoff 1981, Wolpoff 1980a). Boaz's suggestion, which is developed in more detail by Vandermeersch (1981b,, c), is that Neandertals evolved in "virtual" isolation in Europe and then spread southward and eastward into North Africa and the Near East. Both Boaz and Howells suggest that contact between those spreading Neander- tals and modern H. sapiens moving north and/or west toward Europe could have produced the trends visible in the South- Central European sequence. This might be possible, but again it depends on the existence of modern H. sapiens somewhere to the south or east of Europe at an earlier date than in Europe, which has not yet been conclusively demonstrated. Further- more, archaeological data argue against such an intrusion in the Near East (Jelinek 1982). Finally, I do not find Boaz's conception of the degree of isolation of European archaic H. sapiens convincing. If he is willing to allow for gene flow of sufficient magnitude to account for the abundance of Ne- andertals in the Near East and North Africa, which must have occurred prior to 34,000 B.P., why would gene flow of equal magnitude into Europe not have been possible prior to 34,000 years ago? Actually, Boaz et al. (1982:32) do allow for "limited" gene flow between Neandertals and "populations to the East," but even limited gene flow could have prevented the degree of European Neandertal isolation which is a key part of their model. Finally, I agree completely with my colleagues that more research with many different orientations is necessary to 698 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="33">improve our understanding of Upper Pleistocene human evolution. We have much more to learn. Therefore, I certainly do not offer the interpretations presented in this paper as statements of fact. On the basis of what we know at present, however, I believe that a largely indigenous origin of modern Europeans is eminently defensible. References Cited ABSOLON, K. 1929.
