The creature holds a wild boar in one hand and a lion-like monster in the other.13 That this axe was produced in Mitannian style has been noted previously, and its similarity to the Bogazköy seal mentioned above is no accident. On the con trary, this is additional evidence for the conjec tured Mitannian-Bactrian links. This type of image was also popular in Cretan/ Mycenaean art, as evidenced by a seal from Cy prus on which a winged bird-human grasps two prostrate antelopes by their hind legs. There are figures like this from Greece itself, judging from a cylinder seal from graves at Perati on which a Fig. 1. Gonur-depe, Margiana.

Stone amulet. in religious rituals, but the overall practice goes back to Hurrian (Mitannian) traditions.16 There is every reason to think that the Margiana figures with animal heads also originated in Mitannian style glyptics. This seal transmits a scene of ritual festivals that may be compared to the Di onysiac mysteries in which masked participants, accompanied by tambourines, performed reli gious ceremonies, chief among which evidently were acrobatic games. All of the basic elements of this narrative composition have obvious par allels in Syro-Hittite glyptics, but the subject itself (the acrobat) probably originated in mo tifs of Aegean art. In this respect, a Syrian cylin der seal depicting a bull and a pair of acrobats jumping over it—a motif which is assumed to have migrated from the Aegean world—is rep resentative.17 That similar works were known in Anatolia is illustrated by a depiction from Tell Achana-Alalakh VII on which two acrobats also jump over a bull.18 It has now been established that Syrian seals bearing this subject were known in mainland Greece by approximately 1700 b.c., and in that case the famous acrobat frescos from Crete evidently originated at a slightly later period. While the cylinder seal from Margiana seems to depict an acrobat jumping over a pole rather than a bull, the acrobat-bull image appears on a stone amulet shaped like a two-humped Bac trian camel found during the excavations of the temple of Togolok 21 (fig. 4). On the reverse, one sees the image of a charging bull attacked by eagles; behind the bull are the partially preserved legs of a man, evidently an acrobat, who was shown hurdling across its back. Obvi ΊβΜγ y ■ ^ , Fig. 5. Taip-depe, Margiana. Impression of a cylinder seal on a vessel. ously, myths associated with acrobats jumping either over a pole or a bull during ritual games were widely disseminated. It is quite possible that the well-documented ritual festivals with masked participants held in Margiana are re lated to acrobatic games like those held in the Aegean world. The strikingly close resemblance between a cylinder seal impression from the Margiana set tlement of Taip-depe (fig. 5) and Syrian glyptics, especially figures on a cylinder seal from Ras Shamra, has often been observed. In addition to the similar composition of a combat between lions and bulls, there is also a typical Syrian guilloche pattern separating the two registers, and in both examples birds appear in the lower portion.19 Two unique copper cosmetic flasks, found in uncontrolled excavations in Bactria and previ ously unpublished, are of significance. The first has a biconical body and a long neck on which four identical monkeys standing on their hind legs are depicted in relief (fig. 6). The upper por tion of the body of the flask displays three eagles in a heraldic pose with wings outstretched and tails spread. The lower portion bears a composi tion in relief, at the center of which is a snake like dragon, standing on its tail, that is shown swallowing a hare. There is another hare at one side of the central composition and a monkey at the other. Depictions of monkeys are found on seals from Bactria, where they apparently had a sacred significance. There are also hares on Bactrian 30</page><page sequence="5">s a r ι α ν ι d ι: Aegean-Anatolian Motifs in the Glyptic Art of Bactria and Margiana Fig. 6. Bactria.

The tense musculature of his delicately sculpted torso is shown in motion: his right arm is extended while his left arm, around which a gigantic snake twines, is raised. Over his head is a bird, and the rest of the field is filled with plants of a single type with long leaves and "fruits" consisting of three elongated seeds. Although exact analogies to this composition have not yet been found, judging by its style and some details, it is prob able that it originated in Assyrian art. While it is not possible to determine the origin of the various motifs and the direction of their diffusion, Syro-Hittite parallels can be dated no earlier than the beginning of the second millen nium b.c. It was in the second millennium b.c. that contacts between the Aegean world and Syria were at their closest and in the second half of that millennium were strongest at Cyprus. Frankfort has adduced evidence of a strong Syr ian influence on Minoan art from the early sec ond millennium as well.28 From the beginning of the second millennium b.c., cultural exchange, most easily traced in ancient glyptics and sphragistics, extended from Anatolian Syria, and Asia Minor in general, in various directions. The westernmost points were Cyprus and Crete as well as mainland Greece, and the easternmost were Bactria and Margiana Fig. 9. Afghanistan. Amulet with a human figure and a bird. Fig. 10. Bactria. Silver seal of the "Assyrian" type. (fig. 11). It may be no accident that exactly at the beginning of the second millennium one may observe the almost simultaneous arrival of Achaean tribes in Greece and the colonization of Bactria and Margiana by tribes from the west. It is obvious that the similarity of some of the motifs and images of Aegean and Syro-Hittite glyptics noted above is a reflection of profound mythological concepts once held by these peo ples. Complex compositions, often narrative in character, are a type of "synopsis" or "quotation" from ancient myths depicted graphically on seals and amulets. Similar mythological, obviously narrative, compositions on seals and amulets of the Aegean, Syro-Hittite, and Bactria-Margiana regions indicate similar mythological concepts. The presumed cultural and historical commu nity of these regions appears to go back as far as the fifth to fourth millennium b.c., while the separation and migration to new areas of these peoples took place much later, in the early 33</page><page sequence="8">SARIANIDi: Aegean-Anatolian Motifs in the Glyptic Art of Bactria and Margiana Fig. 11.

Aegean-Anatolian Motifs in the Glyptic Art of Bactria and Margiana second millennium b.c. In that case, there is ar chaeological corroboration of Gamkrelidze and Ivanov's theory that southwest Asia is the pri mordial homeland of the Indo-European tribes, among which the Greco-Armeno-Aryan language community formed a separate group. Setting aside the problem of Armenian, let us consider the Greco-Aryan linguistic dialect as these au thors interpret it. Their convincing thesis is that there is a substantial basis for speaking of "a rather early beginning to the movement of the carriers of these dialects in various direc tions and a subsequent absence of areal contacts among them."29 In other words, by the early sec ond millennium b.c. these tribes, who had once been kindred in language (and thus ethno-cultur ally), were already widely separated, differing in the general aspect of their material culture but preserving common beliefs and mythologi cal concepts. It is very probable that the tribes which colo nized Bactria and Margiana were those Indo Iranian (Aryan) peoples who, as Gamkrelidze and Ivanov propose, in the remote past had shared a language with the Greeks. If this is true, one may advance the hypothesis that while the separation of the Greek and Aryan languages, and thus of the speakers of those languages, took place long before the beginning of the second millennium b.c., their common mythological as well as cul tural and religious concepts and beliefs were preserved, although in modified form. This can be demonstrated precisely by the similarity in the motifs of the glyptics of Bactria-Margiana, Greece, and Anatolia, which reflect myths and epic concepts held in common by the inhabi tants of these distant areas.
