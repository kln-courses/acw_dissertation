MUNOA III munoa@hope.edu Hope College, Holland, MI 49423 Scholars have identified Dan 7:9-14 as a merkavah vision, a vision of God's throne, and as a source text for an early Jewish form of mysticism called merkavah mysticism.' 9 As I watched, thrones were set in place, and an Ancient of Days took his throne, his clothing white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was fiery flames, and its wheels were burning fire. 10 A stream of fire issued and flowed out from his presence. A thousand thousands served him, and ten thousand stood attending him. The court sat in judgment and the books were opened. 11 I watched then because of the noise of the arrogant words that the horn was speaking. And as I watched, the beast was put to death, and its body destroyed and given over to be burned with fire. 12 As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away, but their lives were prolonged for a season and a time. 13 As I watched in the night visions, I saw one like a son of man coming on the clouds of heaven. And he came to the Ancient of Days and was presented before him. 14 To him was given domin- ion and glory and kingship, that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that shall not pass away, and his kingship is one that shall never pass away, and his kingship is one that shall never be destroyed. (Dan 7:9-14)2 While early Christian literature does not refer to Dan 7:9-14 as often as it does to Ps 110:1, the most quoted passage from the Jewish Bible in the NT, there are several uses that demonstrate its importance for the mystical interests 1 See I. Gruenwald, Apocalyptic and Merkavah Mysticism (AGJU 14; Leiden: Brill, 1980), 36-37. 2 All biblical quotations are taken from NRSV. Daniel's vision of a white-haired figure on a throne, surrounded by what appears to be a crowded court of attendants, has been traced by C. Rowland back to the vision of the likeness of the glory of the Lord in Ezek 1:26-28, the most influ- ential text in early Jewish mysticism (The Open Heaven [New York: Crossroad, 1982], 96). 303</page><page sequence="2">304 Journal of Biblical Literature of early Christians.3 This vision of Dan 7 has several elements that reappear in the Acts of the Apostles, Revelation, and the early-third-century text The Pas- sion of Perpetua and Felicitas. These texts all share an interest in captive vision- aries, enthroned figures, empowered beings who are standing, and threatening circumstances. As a group, they demonstrate how a merkavah vision became associated with martyrdom. I. Daniel 7 The vision in Dan 7:9-14 is the second half of a lengthy vision that begins in 7:2. The visionary, Daniel, is described in this second-century B.C.E. text as an exilic Jew (Dan 1:3-7) who lived as a captive under the administration of the Babylonians and the Persians (Dan 5:30-31) and found his life under threat (Dan 6:1-28). The vision in Dan 7:2-8 begins with a sequence of four beasts, the fourth of which is terrifying and destructive. After Daniel's description of the fourth beast, the vision of Dan 7:9-14 follows. Here a figure identified as an "Ancient of Days" with white hair takes his dazzling throne in a court scene involving thousands of attendants. Judgment follows; the destruction of the fourth beast is announced; and the three other beasts find their lives prolonged for "a season and a time." As the vision continues Daniel sees an unnamed fig- ure called "one like a son of man," who, after coming with the clouds of heaven, is presented before the "Ancient of Days" and is given everlasting dominion over all peoples. Scholarly debate has focused on the unnamed figure called the "one like a son of man" referred to in Dan 7:13-14. Interpreters are divided over whether this figure is symbolic or an individual, usually a heavenly being.4 The history of interpretation behind this passage shows how both options have been popular.5 Early Christian interpreters identified Jesus as the "one like a son of man," and several identified Jesus as the "one like a son of man" who is "standing." Chris- tians were not alone in arguing for a specific identity for this anonymous figure. 3 Daniel 7:9-14 is partially quoted in Mark 13:26 and 14:62. In Mark 13:26 Jesus is quoted as saying during his discourse on the events that will follow the destruction of the temple, "Then they will see 'the Son of Man coming in clouds' with great power and glory." In Mark 14:62 Jesus is quoted as saying, in answer to the high priest's question about Jesus' messiahship, "I am; and 'you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Power,' and 'coming with the clouds of heaven."' 4 M. D. Hooker (The Son of Man in Mark [Montreal: McGill University Press, 1967], 11-30) and P. M. Casey (Son of Man: The Interpretation and Influence of Daniel 7 [London: SPCK, 1979], 24-39) favor the symbolic view, while S. Mowinckel (He That Cometh [Nashville: Abingdon, 1954], 356-58) and H. E. Tbdt (The Son of Man in the Synoptic Tradition [Philadelphia: Westminster, 1965], 22-31) argue for a heavenly savior-figure interpretation. 5 Casey, Son of Man, 24-26, 64-66, 71.</page><page sequence="3">Munoa: Jesus, the Merkabah, and Martyrdom 305 Other Jewish groups had their candidates: Enoch, Metatron, Seth, Abel, and Michael.6 2 Ezra 13 is one of the very few texts to refer to the "one like a son of man" of Dan 7:13-14 without identifying the figure. II. Acts 7 The vision attributed to Stephen in Acts 7:54-60 includes several charac- teristics that illustrate its probable use of Dan 7. 54 When they heard these things, they became enraged and ground their teeth at Stephen. 55 But filled with the Holy Spirit, he gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. 56 "Look," he said, "I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!" 57 But they covered their ears, and with a loud shout all rushed together against him. 58 Then they dragged him out of the city and began to stone him; and the witnesses laid their coats at the feet of a young man named Saul. 59 While they were stoning Stephen, he prayed, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit." 60 Then he knelt down and cried out in a loud voice, "Lord, do not hold this sin against them." When he had said this, he died. (Acts 7:54-60) This vision of the heavenly world, which not only alludes to Daniel's vision- ary experience but also recalls Ezekiel's visionary experiences,' parallels the merkavah vision of Dan 7 in subtle, yet detectable ways. M. Casey has argued that "there is no clear sign of Dan. 7 in Acts," and that "the ultimate influence of Dan 7:13 can be detected at Acts 7:56 only in a remote sense, and reference to it was not intended by the author."s Casey's criteria for literary dependence in this instance, however, border on a usage that approximates a quotation. Detecting literary dependence involves more than identifying a quotation. It involves being sensitive to the recurrence of vocabulary, concepts, and struc- tural or narrative elements.9 The author of Acts appears to have used Dan 7 when describing Stephen's martyrdom.10 Like Daniel, Stephen is described as a captive visionary, having 6 P. Munoa, Four Powers in Heaven: The Interpretation of Daniel 7 in the Testament of Abraham (JSPSup 28; Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1998), 69. Rowland notes how 1 QM 17:7ff. interprets Dan 7:13-14 with reference to Michael (Open Heaven, 180). 7 Both Ezek 1:1 and Acts 7:56 begin by describing how the heavens were opened and visions of God were given. See also T. Levi 2:6. The visionary interests of Dan 7:9-10 (the enthroned "Ancient of Days") have been traced to Ezek 1:25-27 (Rowland, Open Heaven, 16, 218). s Casey, Son of Man, 200-201. 9 See my discussion in Four Powers in Heaven, 36-42. 10 H. D. Sparks argued that the author of Luke-Acts deliberately imitated the LXX so as to give his work a "biblical flavor" ("The Semitisms of St Luke's Gospel," JTS 44 [1943]: 129-38). If</page><page sequence="4">306 Journal of Biblical Literature been seized by a hostile crowd of Jews who have him under their control (Acts 6:8-12). Stephen's words according to Acts 7:56, "I see the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God," go on to imply that, like Daniel, he sees both God on his throne, recalling Daniel's "Ancient of Days," who was seated on a throne, and the "one like a son of man," who was in the presence of the enthroned "Ancient of Days" (Dan 7:9-13). Acts 7 is in this way an implicit merkavah vision. When Jesus is referred to as the "Son of Man" the author calls to mind not only the familiar title used by Jesus according to the NT Gospels,11 but also the figure identified as "one like a son of man" in Dan 7:13-14, whom the author associates with Jesus earlier in his work (Luke 21:27).12 Another connection to Dan 7 may be implied when Stephen prays to Jesus, which assumes that Jesus, like the "one like a son of man," has been empowered (Dan 7:13-14). It may even be suggested that Daniel's courtroom scene and the exercise of judgment (Dan 7:9-11) are in the background, since Stephen asks Jesus to act as a merciful judge over those who are stoning him to death (Acts 7:59). Daniel 7:14 says that the "one like a son of man" was given "dominion, glory, and kingship"; these are attributes that imply the authority to judge. Finally, both Daniel and Acts 7 refer to a threatening, hostile setting. Daniel's vision refers to four beasts, the fourth of which is especially monstrous, "devouring" with "great iron teeth" (Dan 7:7). In Acts an "enraged" crowd "ground their teeth" at Stephen (Acts 7:54) and eventually destroyed him. When these similarities between Dan 7 and Acts 7 are set out, it becomes unlikely that they are the result of coincidence or the author's use of common literary patterns. Stephen's dying words are an intriguing aspect of this passage. With them the author of Acts parallels Stephen's death at the hands of a hostile enemy with Jesus' death on the cross. Both Stephen and Jesus offer up their spirits and ask that their enemies be forgiven (Luke 23:46, 3413). The author's interest in par- Sparks is right about the author of Luke-Acts imitating the language of the LXX, it is not unreason- able that the same author may have used figures and/or events from the LXX as models for his own narrative interests. For Luke's use of OT themes and models, see B. S. Rosner, "Acts and Biblical History," in The Book of Acts in Its Ancient Literary Setting, vol. 1 (ed. B. Winter and A. D. Clarke; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1993), 65-82. 11 This is the only NT use of the title "Son of Man" (... .rv YTiv rof dAvpdcmou) with the def- inite article outside the Gospels. 12 Even D. R. A. Hare, who argues against any use of "Son of Man" in Luke-Acts that sug- gests its use as an apocalyptic title derived from Dan 7:13-14, admits that Luke 21:27 "is the only passage in Luke's Gospel about which it can be said with any degree of plausibility that the term "the Son of Man" occurs in association to Dan 7:13-14 (The Son of Man Tradition [Minneapolis: Fortress, 1990], 69). 13 The textual support for Luke 23:34 is uncertain but on balance the evidence favors its acceptance as Lukan.

Marshall, The Gospel of Luke: A Commentary on the Greek Text (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1978), 867-68.</page><page sequence="5">Munoa: Jesus, the Merkabah, and Martyrdom 307 alleling Stephen's martyrdom by a "beastly" crowd with Jesus' death may owe something to the circumstances of Jesus' death, as described in Luke-Acts, and to how Dan 7 was interpreted by Jesus' followers. Daniel 7 never explicitly explains why the "one like a son of man" is empowered. While the rationale is not stated, however, the text of Daniel may be taken to imply that the "one like a son of man" brought about the destruction of the fourth beast and the muting of the others. According to Dan 7:10-12, the heavenly court "sat in judgment," the fourth beast was then destroyed, and the dominion of the other three was taken away. The method of judgment is not given however.14 While Dan 7 does not explicitly credit the "one like a son of man" with the judgment of the beasts, such an inference would not be unrea- sonable. The defeat of the beasts would provide a reader with a reasonable explanation for empowerment: the "one like a son of man" carried out the heav- enly court's judgment of the beast. This interpretation finds support in the Ugaritic tradition that is thought to be behind the throne-room scene of Daniel.15 The Christian adaptation of Dan 7 in Rev 12 may also lend support to the idea that the "one like a son of man" implicitly defeated the fourth beast. Here the angel Michael, perhaps acting in the role of the "one like a son of man," fights and defeats a dragon whose seven heads and ten horns serve as an obvious allusion to the fourth beast of Daniel (Rev 12:3; cf. Dan 7:7).16 The author of Luke-Acts presents Jesus as battling Satan (Luke 11:14-23) and, ultimately, on account of his death, being raised from the dead and exalted as "both Lord and Christ" (Luke 24:26; Acts 2:22-36). This early Christian author sees Jesus, early Christianity's "one like a son of man," succeeding through a death that leads to glory. What was left unidentified by Dan 7, the 14 See also Dan 7:21-22, 26. J. J. Collins notes that "we are not told how or by whom it [the beast] is slain (Daniel: A Commentary on the Book of Daniel [Hermeneia; Minneapolis: Fortress, 1993], 303). 15 J. Goldingay argues that the Ugaritic combat myth Baal, with its tale of Baal's slaying of the Sea and El's bestowal of kingship on his son, serves as the "indirect background" of Dan 7's vision (Daniel [WBC 30; Dallas: Word, 1989], 151), a view first noted by O. Eissfeldt (Baal Zaphon, Zeus Kasios und der Durchzug der Israeliten durchs Meer [Halle: Niemeyer, 1932], 25-30). In this myth, the Sea tries to usurp Baal's position and Baal kills the Sea and receives an eternal kingship. Goldingay notes that the OT usually combines the positions of El and Baal in Yahweh, except in Dan 7, "where the humanlike figure takes Baal's position." Goldingay suggests that this link with ancient myth came through the "learned circles in Judaism" that were connected to the temple cult (Daniel, 151), a view shared by Collins (Daniel, 291-94). The knowledge of such a tradition in the second century B.C.E. may have survived into the first century C.E. and thus informed Jesus' follow- ers as they read Dan 7. 16 J. Day argues that the conflict of Michael with the dragon was influenced by the account of the "one like a son of man" and the fourth beast in Dan 7 (God's Conflict with the Dragon and the Sea [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985], 173).

Yarbro Collins, The Combat Myth in the Book of Revelation (HDR 9; Missoula, MT: Scholars Press, 1976), 104-7.</page><page sequence="6">308 Journal of Biblical Literature means of judging the beast and the reason for the empowerment of the "one like a son of man," was identified by the followers of Jesus: Jesus, the "one like a son of man," overcame (judged) the "beast" through his death, and this led to his exaltation. In this light, Acts 7 is teaching that martyrdom is the means of victory over the beast. Martyrdom may be implied in Dan 7:21, which says that the "holy ones," who, according to Dan 7:18, symbolize the "one like a son of man," suf- fer before they gain the kingdom: the fourth beast "made war" with them and "was prevailing over them.'7 In this manner, Stephen is placed in a setting that alludes to both Jesus' death and Dan 7. Stephen follows his "Son of Man" in life and in death as he fights a "beast."'s As he dies, he is granted a vision of Jesus the "Son of Man," as an encouragement and as a promise of ultimate vindica- tion and victory over death through resurrection.19 Stephen is presented as repeating the experience of the "one like a son of man" as his "Son of Man" receives him. The most puzzling aspect of Acts 7:55-56 has been the description of Jesus as "standing" ('ardoa) at the "right hand of God."20 Mark 14:62 associ- ates Jesus with Ps 110:1 and Dan 7:13 and in this way infers that Jesus is both sitting and standing (CK 6056tcv KaOnilRevov ij; 6agevewcoi; and dpXy6evov ovgeTx nt6v veeXa6v tolb ouipavoU). Likewise, the Ascension of Isaiah, which is dated from the second century B.C.E. to the fourth century C.E., describes Jesus as standing, then eventually sitting (9:35; 11:32).21 The author of Luke-Acts, how- ever, does not include a reference to Dan 7:13 when referring to Jesus' confes- sion before the high priest and has Jesus quoting only Ps 110:1 and thus identifying that the "Son of man will be seated at the right hand of the power of 17 See also Dan 7:25, where it is predicted that the fourth beast will "wear out the holy ones" and "they shall be given into his power." Daniel 9:26, "After the sixty-two weeks, an anointed one shall be cut off and shall have nothing," may also have suggested to readers that death and martyr- dom were a means to an end. 18 Daniel 7:25 describes how the fourth beast "shall wear out the holy ones of the most high." While "holy ones" may refer to celestial beings or to earthly ones (Dan 7:27, "the people of the most high), the idea of God's community facing a beast is clear. For opposing points of view on the inter- pretation of "holy ones" (111? .' lup)), see J. J. Collins, "The Son of Man and the Saints of the Most High in the Book of Daniel," JBL (1974): 50-66; and G. Hasel, "The Identity of 'the Saints of the Most High' in Daniel," Bib 56 (1975): 173-92. 19 This is what Luke-Acts encourages the reader to think about the purpose of Stephen's vision. It earlier quoted Ps 16:8-11 as David's vision of the Lord (Jesus) that brought him, David, reassurance that he would overcome death and be raised from the dead (Acts 2:25-28). 20 If Jesus was described as sitting at the right hand of God, then Ps 110:1 would immediately come to mind. The language of Acts 7:56 does have some similarity to Ps 110:1, but my argument is that the influence of Dan 7:9-13 is overlooked by interpreters. 21 Chapters 6-11 are identified as a Christian work and are dated to the second century C.E. (M. Knibb in OTP 2:149-50).</page><page sequence="7">Munoa: Jesus, the Merkabah, and Martyrdom 309 God" (Luke 22:69). Jesus' stance in Acts 7:55-56 thus contrasts with Luke 22:69 and other enthronement passages in Luke-Acts (Luke 2:32). Why is Jesus standing when the tradition of Luke-Acts foresees Jesus as sitting?22 E. Haenchen suggests three possible explanations for Jesus' posture: (a) Jesus stands as the protomartyr-identified by Haenchen as the majority view; (b) Jesus stands to take up his messianic office; and (c) Jesus, like the angels, stands before God as an act of subordination.23 Explanations (a) and (b) are hypothetical and lack textual support. Explanation (c) has been called "dubious."24 According to explanation (c), Jewish tradition teaches that the angels and other heavenly beings do not sit but must stand as an act of subordi- nation to God, as the tradition of the angel Metatron being beaten for sitting down in heaven illustrates (3 En. 16:1-5).25 Yet this Metatron tradition, which is essential to the "two powers" controversy in rabbinic Judaism, illustrates that there must have been differing Jewish traditions about the posture of angels. It advocates the view that no angels are allowed to sit.26 In contrast, while Dan 7:10 says, "A thousand thousands served him, and ten thousand times ten thou- sand stood attending him," Dan 7:9 refers to a plurality of thrones and implies that the heavenly attendants of Dan 7:10 have their thrones and were seated. In addition, early Christian tradition, as evidenced by the Revelation of John, illus- trates how early Christians accepted the teaching that heavenly beings do sit.27 Therefore, the angelic subordination argument is not sufficient. Jesus' posture must have some other explanation, especially since Luke-Acts foresees Jesus as sitting at God's right hand. J. Fossum relates Jesus' posture to an anti-Simon Magus polemic in Acts, 22 C. Holladay does cite Ps 110:1, Dan 7:13, and Luke 22:69 when referring to the issue of Jesus standing in Acts 7:55-56 but does not address the apparent conflict within Luke-Acts (in Harper's Bible Commentary [ed. J. L. Mays; San Francisco: HarperCollins, 1998], 1088). 23 E. Haenchen, The Acts of the Apostles (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1971), 292 n. 4. More recent commentators on Acts often list explanations for Jesus' posture, but their uncertainty over its meaning is apparent. Close examination discovers that any additional explanations either overlap in varying degrees with Haenchen's list or are new explanations that lack significant textual support and serve as conjectures. See H. Conzelmann, Acts of the Apostles (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1987), 59-60; C. K. Barrett, The Acts of the Apostles (Edinburgh: T &amp; T Clark, 1994), 384-85; and J. A. Fitzmyer, Acts of the Apostles (AB 31; New York: Doubleday, 1998), 392. 24 D. Aune, "Christian Prophecy and the Messianic Status of Jesus," in The Messiah: Devel- opments in Earliest Judaism and Christianity (ed. J. H. Charlesworth; Minneapolis: Fortress, 1992), 419 n. 55. 25 Rowland presents this idea of angelic subordination (Open Heaven, 370). Gruenwald also discusses the view that angels do not sit in heaven (Apocalyptic and Merkavah Mysticism, 66-67). 26 A. Segal points out the significance of the Metatron tradition for discerning the differing Judaisms of the rabbinic era (Two Powers in Heaven: Early Rabbinic Reports about Christianity and Gnosticism [SJLA 25; Leiden: Brill, 1977], 60-62). 27 See Rev 4:4. This is in contrast to later texts such as 3 En. 16:1-5 that describe the scandal of Metatron the angel being seated in heaven.</page><page sequence="8">310 Journal of Biblical Literature where Simon is introduced as an enemy of the apostles (Acts 8:9-24). The Pseudo-Clementine writings present Simon as claiming to be the Messiah by calling himself "the Standing One" (o iEor~c) (Hom 2:22 ANF). Fossum argues that several biblical references to Moses standing by God (Exod 33:21; Deut 5:31) led to the Samaritan belief, found in a text such as Memar Marqah 4.12, that Moses stood by God and underwent an apotheosis, being exalted to angelic status.28 No prophet like Moses has arisen or will ever arise. He was exalted above the whole human race and progressed until he joined with the angels, as was said of him: "And I will join you." Where is there anyone like Moses who trod the fire? Where is there anyone like Moses to whom the Lord said: "Stand by Me now"? Where is there a Prophet like Moses, whom God addressed mouth to mouth? Where is there a prophet like Moses, who fasted forty days and forty nights, neither eating nor drinking? And he descended carrying two stone tablets inscribed by the finger of God. (Memar Marqah 4.12)29 The Samaritan community believed that the Mosaic deliverer would be known as "the Standing One," the eschatological Mosaic prophet who had been glorified as a heavenly being. Fossum says that this Samaritan tradition explains both Simon's claims and the posture of Jesus. Acts 7:56, then, according to Fos- sum, expresses Samaritan ideology and is presenting Jesus as the true "Standing One," the prophet like Moses, in opposition to Simon.30 There are two weaknesses in Fossum's solution. First, the Samaritan mate- rials he utilizes to present his case for the title "the Standing One" clearly post- date Acts, a weakness that Fossum acknowledges.31 There are no pre-Acts references to the title "the Standing One" as a Samaritan Mosaic tradition. There is the possibility of an oral tradition predating the written materials, but the existence of such a tradition can be deemed only possible, not probable, if there is no literary evidence. Second, Acts 7:56 does not use the title "the Standing One" as it appears in the Pseudo-Clementine literature or the Samar- itan writings. In Acts, Jesus is described as standing, he is not called "the Stand- ing One." That title does not appear in first-century Christian literature. C. Fletcher-Louis has recently argued that Jesus' posture in Acts 7:55-56 is understandable in light of Luke 12:8, where Jesus says, "everyone who 28 J. Fossum, The Name of God and the Angel of the Lord (WUNT 36; Tilbingen: Mohr- Siebeck, 1985), 122. Aune admits that the problem of Jesus standing in Acts 7 has never been satis- factorily explained but believes that Fossum's explanation makes sense ("Christian Prophecy," 419 n. 55). Barrett (Acts of the Apostles, 384) traces this Samaritan explanation back to C. Colpe. 29 Translation from J. Macdonald, Memar Marqah: The Teachings of Marqah (BZAW 84; Berlin: Rettig, 1963). 30 Fossum, Name of God, 124 n. 148. 31 Ibid., 169.</page><page sequence="9">Munoa: Jesus, the Merkabah, and Martyrdom 311 acknowledges me before others, the Son of Man will acknowledge before the angels of God." According to Fletcher-Louis, Jesus is fulfilling this promise by standing to "acknowledge" Stephen, who has acknowledged him before the Jews.32 The problem with this solution is that Acts 7 is missing several elements pertinent to Luke 12:8: Stephen never refers to Jesus by name in his speech before his accusers; there are no angels present in Stephen's vision; and when Stephen sees Jesus, Jesus is silent and says nothing. Jesus' "standing" in Acts 7:56 is best explained as an intentional allusion to Dan 7:13.33 Two observations warrant this conclusion. First, the Jesus tradition of the Gospels emphatically associates Jesus with Dan 7:13, and it makes sense to look there for an explanation. That Mark 13:26 and 14:62 partially quote Dan 7:13 illustrates how it was an important text in understanding the significance of Jesus. While it is true that there is no explicit description in Dan 7:13 of the "one like a son of man" as standing,34 this posture may be understood as implicit in the text. Second, early Christians understood Dan 7:13 as a descrip- tion of Jesus, the "one like a son of man," who stood after "he came to the Ancient of Days." This is how Justin (150 C.E.) understands Dan 7:13 when he quotes Dan 7:9-14 to Trypho when arguing that Jesus has been empowered by God. If such power is shown to have accompanied and still now accompanies his Passion, just think how great shall be His power at his glorious Advent! For, as Daniel foretold, He shall come on the clouds as the Son of Man, accompa- nied by His angels. Here are his exact words: "I beheld till the thrones were set, and the Ancient of days sat, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair on His head like clean wool. His throne was like the flames of fire, His wheels like a burning fire. A swift stream of fire issued forth from before 32 C. Fletcher-Louis, Luke-Acts: Angels, Christology, and Soteriology (WUNT 2.94; Tiibin- gen: Mohr-Siebeck, 1998), 246-48. B. Lindars argues for the same view in Jesus Son of Man: A Fresh Examination of the Son of Man Sayings in the Gospels (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1983), 139-43. Both Fletcher-Louis and Lindars have to assume that "standing" is implied by the word "acknowledge" (6ooXoyi~crt) in Luke 12:8, even though "standing" is not specifically mentioned. The immediate context of Luke 12:8 suggests that spoken acknowledgment is implied (see Luke 12:9-12). 33 Haenchen refers to Dan 7:13 but sees the standing of the "one like a son of man" as an expression of angelic posture. He does not explain the posture of Jesus in light of Dan 7:13 (Acts, 292 n. 4). F. F. Bruce argues for Jesus as a heavenly advocate in light of Luke 12:8, "everyone who acknowledges me before men, the Son of man also will acknowledge before the angels of God (The Acts of the Apostles [3d ed.; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1990], 210). However, it is not clear that "acknowledge" implies "standing." Conzelmann connects Jesus' standing with T. Mos. 10:3, which predicts that God "will arise" from his kingly throne in order to go forth in judgment (Acts of the Apostles, 60). However, there are textual problems with this passage (see J. Priest's comments on this passage in OTP 1:932), and it appears to be contemporaneous with Acts. 3 Neither is there a reference to the "one like a son of man" sitting.</page><page sequence="10">312 Journal of Biblical Literature Him.

(Dialogue with Trypho 31)36 Justin's interpretation of Dan 7:13-14 offers support for early Christian readers seeing it as the reference point for Stephen's vision of the "Son of Man stand- ing" in Acts 7:55-56. Moreover, there are several Jewish texts that clearly allude to the idea of the "one like a son of man" standing before God and being empowered. The Similitudes of 1 Enoch provide first-century support for a use of Dan 7:9-14 that understands the "one like a son of man" as standing and as enthroned. Scholars have long noted how Dan 7 served as the background for the "Son of Man" in 1 En. 36-71.37 Here the "Son of Man," who is also called the "Elect One" in 1 Enoch, is described as standing now, but as sitting on God's throne when the final judgment takes place. The Elect One stands before the Lord of the Spirits; his glory is forever and ever and his power is unto all generations. (1 En. 49:2 OTP) In those days, Sheol will return all the deposits which she had received and hell will give back all that which it owes. And he shall choose the righteous and the holy ones from among (the risen dead), for the day when they shall be selected and saved has arrived. In those days, (the Elect One) shall sit on my throne, and from the conscience of his mouth shall come out all the secrets of wisdom, for the Lord of the Spirits has given them to him and glori- fied him. (1 En. 51:1-3 OTP) Like the Jesus tradition, 1 En. 49:2 appears to be borrowing from the pre- sentation of the "one like a son of man" before the "Ancient of Days" where he stands and is empowered, whereas 1 En. 51:1-3 is making use of the exercise of 35 Italics mine. The LXX has "he was brought to him" in Dan 7:13. 36 Translation from T. Falls, Saint Justin Martyr (FOTC 6; New York: Christian Heritage, 1948). S37M. Black argues that the Similitudes date to the first century C.E. and are dependent on Dan 7 for the portrayal of the Son of Man (The Book of Enoch or I Enoch [SVTP 7; Leiden: Brill, 1985], 183-89).</page><page sequence="11">Munoa: Jesus, the Merkabah, and Martyrdom 313 judgment and enthronement that is also implied in the text as a result of empowerment. The whole setting of Dan 7:9-14 is one of judgment, and enthronement is implied by Dan 7:9, "as I watched, thrones were set in place."38 Ezekiel the Tragedian, a second-century B.C.E. Jewish text that predates the Similitudes of I Enoch, also made use of Dan 7:9-14. This pre-Christian work, which I. Gruenwald identifies as one of the earliest postbiblical merkavah visions, has been described by W. Horbury as a messianic exegesis of Dan 7.39 On Sinai's peak I [Moses] saw what seemed a throne so great in size it touched the clouds of heaven. Upon it sat a man of noble mien, becrowned, and with a scepter in one hand while with the other he did beckon me. I made approach and stood before the throne. He handed o'er the scepter and bade me to mount the throne, and gave me the crown; then he himself with- drew from off the throne. (Ezekiel the Tragedian 68-76 OTP).40 While this passage appears to have been influenced by other biblical texts,41 it does have elements that are distinctive to Dan 7:9-14: Moses, like the "one like a son of man," approaches an enthroned figure and then is empow- ered with kingship ("becrowned" and "scepter").42 It is relevant for both Acts 7:56 and 1 En. 49:2 that Moses, Ezekiel the Tragedian's candidate for the "one like a son of man," stands in the presence of the enthroned figure before being 38 Matthew 25:31-33 appears to be making the same use of Dan 7:9-14 as 1 En. 51:1-3. 39 I. Gruenwald was the first to identify this text as part of the merkavah tradition (Apocalyp- tic and Merkavah Mysticism [Leiden: Brill, 1980], 128-29). P. van der Horst has also described the relationship of this vision of Moses in Ezekiel the Tragedian to the later Jewish speculations about the throne ("Moses' Throne Vision in Ezekiel the Dramatist," JJS 34 [1983]: 24-29; idem, "Some Notes on the Exagoge of Ezekiel," Mnemosyne 37 [1984]: 364-68). W. Horbury makes his case for Ezekiel the Tragedian's use of Dan 7 in "The Messianic Associations of 'the Son of Man,"' JTS 36 (1985): 42-43. Horbury furthers van der Horst's definite identification of Dan 7 as a source (van der Horst, "Moses' Throne Vision," 24). R. Robertson also opts for the dependence of Ezekiel the Tragedian on Dan 7 (OTP 2:812, b2). 40 Ezekiel the Tragedian was originally written in Greek and is extant only in fragments cited by Eusebius, Clement of Alexandria, and Pseudo-Eustathius. 41 Most notably Exod 24:10; Ps 110:1-4; Ezek 1:26; Gen 37:9-10; Ps 147:4; and Isa 6:1. 42 Three additional ties to Dan 7 should also be mentioned. First, Horbury notes that the anthropomorphic depiction of the enthroned "man of noble mien" (1:70), which, besides alluding to Ezek 1:26, can also be taken in connection with the enthroned "Ancient of Days" (Dan 7:9). Another tie to Dan 7, also pointed out by Horbury, involves the singular (1:68, 73, 75) and plural (1:76) references to thrones, which allude to "thrones" and "throne" of Dan 7:9. Horbury notes the variation between plural and singular thrones in Wis 9:4 and 10, but favors dependence on Daniel since other allusions to Daniel are found in Ezekiel the Tragedian ("Messianic Associations," 42-43). The third tie to Dan 7, which was missed by Horbury, is an allusion to a heavenly setting like that of Dan 7:13 in the reference to "Sinai's peak," which was regarded as an ascent to heaven.</page><page sequence="12">314 Journal of Biblical Literature enthroned himself. In light of Acts, 1 Enoch, and Ezekiel the Tragedian, it appears that some readers from the second century B.C.E. through the second century C.E. interpreted the "one like a son of man" as standing before the "Ancient of Days."43 Against that background, the posture of Jesus in Acts 7 is best understood as a reflection of how early Christians understood Daniel 7. It is important to ask what the "standing" (~'oaxra) signifies for the author of Luke-Acts in Acts 7:56. In conjunction with the rest of Luke-Acts and its message that Jesus, as the "one like a son of man," was destined to die and be raised from the dead, "standing" appears to signify resurrection and vindication before God's throne. The word "standing" itself suggests resurrection (dv6- ozazto , "a raising up, a standing up"). Jesus stands, not as the proto-martyr, but as Paul said, the "firstfruits" of those who have died and will be raised up (1 Cor 15:20). This is why Stephen's vision of Jesus as "the Son of Man standing" (Acts 7:56) should be understood as reassuring Stephen: Jesus has been resurrected and stands as the "one like a son of man" in the presence of God and his throne. In this fashion, Dan 7:13-14 may have been interpreted by early Christians as teaching the resurrection of the Messiah.44 III. The Revelation of John The early Christian tradition of interpreting Jesus in light of Dan 7:9-14 is found also in the heavenly throne room scene of Rev 4 and 5. With this scene 43 It may also be helpful to interpret Simon's claim in the Pseudo-Clementine literature to be "the Standing One" in light of Dan 7:9-14 and its use in Acts 7:55-56. Such a title acknowledges the importance of the "one like a son of man" without identifying the figure by name, something that Dan 7:9-14 never does but which many later interpreters tried to do. If this is the case, Simon is claiming to be the "one like a son of man." If one asks, why would Simon not use the title "Son of Man"?, the answer would be that it was closely associated with Jesus, a tradition that Simon attacked. Fossum refers to Hom. 2.22, "Sometimes he (Simon) intimates that he is the Christ by calling himself 'the Standing One,"' and connects Simon's claim to a Moses tradition (Name of God, 121). It may be more plausible to associate Simon's claim to be "the Standing One" to Dan 7:13-14. This makes more sense in light of the use of Dan 7:13-14 as a messianic text in Christian literature and in the Similitudes of I Enoch. 44 C. F. D. Moule has argued that the gospel tradition presents Jesus as the "one like a son of man" who is despised, rejected, and ultimately vindicated according to Dan 7 (The Birth of the New Testament [3d ed.; San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row, 1982], 91). Moule interprets the "one like a son of man" symbolically as faithful, suffering Israelites who are glorified by God and says that Jesus used this symbol to interpret his relationship to God (ibid., 130-31, 150). A. Segal has argued that Jewish mysticism lies behind Phil 2:5-11, where Jesus, identified with the image of God, takes on human form, suffers, dies, and is exalted by God (Paul the Convert: The Apostolate and Apostasy of Saul the Pharisee [New Haven: Yale University Press, 1990], 62). It may be helpful to look to Dan 7 as the foundational mystical text for Phil 2:5-11.</page><page sequence="13">Munoa: Jesus, the Merkabah, and Martyrdom 315 Revelation contributes to the developing interest in merkavah mysticism and can be described as a "christianized" form of merkavah mysticism.45 While this passage does allude to the merkavah vision of Ezek 1:26-28,46 the following passages from Revelation's throne room scene illustrate its use of Dan 7.47 ... there in heaven stood a throne, with one seated on the throne! (Rev 4:2) Around the throne are twenty-four thrones, and seated on the thrones are twenty-four elders, dressed in white robes, with golden crowns on their heads. (Rev 4:4) ... and in front of the throne burn seven flaming torches (Rev 4:5) And no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or look into it. (Rev 5:3) Then I saw between the throne and four living creatures and among the elders a Lamb standing as if it had been slaughtered ... (Rev 5:6) He went and took the scroll from the right hand of the one who was seated on the throne ... (Rev 5:7) 11 Then I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels surrounding the throne and the living creatures and the elders; they numbered myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands, 12 singing with full voice, "Worthy is the Lamb that was slaughtered to receive power and wealth and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing!" (Rev 5:11-12) Revelation's throne room scene has a setting and structure similar to Dan 7:9-14. Along with Dan 7, Rev 4 and 5 describe a captive visionary (Rev 1:9) who is given a vision of a heavenly throne-room scene. The vision involves an enthroned being whose throne is accompanied by fire, additional thrones, white clothing, and heavenly beings. There is also a threatening situation that must be overcome. In Dan 7:11-12 it was the beast with the horn. In Rev 4 and 5 it is the absence of someone worthy enough "to open the scroll or to look into it" (Rev 5:1-4). Finally, in both texts there is the introduction, before an 45 See Gruenwald, Apocalyptic and Merkavah Mysticism, 62; and P. Munoa, "Christianizing Jewish Apocalypticism: D. E. Aune's Proposal for Understanding Revelation" BR 43 (1998): 54-60. 46 An enthroned figure and a rainbow appear in both passages. See, e.g., M. Boring, Revela- tion (Interpretation; Louisville: John Knox Press, 1989), 102-3; J. Sweet, Revelation (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1979), 117; R. Mounce, The Book of Revelation (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1977), 134; and G. Caird, A Commentary on the Revelation of St. John the Divine (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1966), 63-64. 47 G. Beale has quite carefully highlighted Revelation's use of Dan 7 (The Book of Revelation: A Commentary [Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1999], 314-15; idem, The Use of Daniel in Jewish Apoc- alyptic Literature and in the Revelation ofJohn [Lanham, MD: University Press of America, 1984], 181-223). D. Aune has done the same (Revelation [WBC 52a; Dallas: Word, 1997], 266-374).</page><page sequence="14">316 Journal of Biblical Literature enthroned being, of a figure who is empowered and glorified.48 In Revelation, the Lamb takes the scroll and solves the dilemma of no "worthy" ones in Rev 5:3. In conjunction with Acts 7:56, Revelation interprets the "one like a son of man" as Jesus the "Lamb," who is portrayed as "standing" ('oniK6;) (Rev 5:6). Revelation's reliance on Dan 7 in depicting its heavenly throne room scene sug- gests that its author, along with the authors of Acts, 1 Enoch, and Ezekiel the Tragedian, understood the "one like a son of man" to be standing before the "Ancient of Days." Despite the many angels of Revelation, the issue of the Lamb standing as an act of angelic subordination in this instance is not possible. The text ends with the Lamb being empowered in a way that is reminiscent of Dan 7:14 and ultimately sharing in the "blessing and honor and might" bestowed on God (Rev 5:13). Revelation 5:6 is most important for understanding how Dan 7:9-14 was recast in Revelation. Here Daniel's "one like a son of man" has been inter- preted as Jesus the slaughtered Lamb, who gains possession of a scroll from the enthroned deity and is empowered (Rev 5:9-14). Jesus has succeeded by expe- riencing death as an animal sacrifice. Revelation, like Luke-Acts, teaches that the success of Jesus, the "one like a son of man" (Rev 1:13), is due to his suffer- ing death. It is only when the slaughtered Lamb appears "standing" that the dilemma of who can take and open the scroll is resolved. In Revelation the means of Jesus' ultimate conquest of the dragon and his beasts, which clearly allude to the beasts of Dan 7, is his death. It can be argued that Revelation sees the empowerment of the "one like a son of man" in connection with his defeat of the beasts through his death. And as with the depiction of Jesus as "standing" in Stephen's vision in Acts, the significance of the Lamb "standing" in Revela- tion is that the Lamb has been resurrected and raised from the dead. That a slaughtered lamb is standing can only mean that the lamb is no longer dead. Both authors understood the "one like a son of man" of Daniel as Jesus who died in defeating the beast and now stands (resurrected) before the throne of God. The presentation of "one like a son of man" before the "Ancient of Days" in Dan 7:13 was taken to be a depiction of the risen Jesus who appeared before God and was glorified following his death. Subsequent to the throne scene in Rev 4 and 5 there are beasts who threaten Jesus' followers (Rev 13). This predicament parallels Stephen's encounter with a "beastly" crowd that took his life. Throughout Revelation readers are directly and indirectly called to patient suffering and the possibility 48 Daniel 7:13-14; cf. Rev 5:6-13. Sweet does identify the ties between Dan 7 and Rev 5:1-14 (Revelation, 126-31). There is a possible allusion to the "holy ones of the Most High" (Dan 7:18 and 27) in Rev 5:10 in the reference to the glorified "saints" who are made to be a "kingdom."</page><page sequence="15">Munoa: Jesus, the Merkabah, and Martyrdom 317 of martyrdom.49 Indeed, in Revelation "conquering" or "overcoming" through a faithful death leads to a shared kingship with Jesus and resurrection (Rev 12:11; 20:4-5). An experience like Stephen's, a faithful death patterned after Jesus', is the model for Revelation's readers. IV. The Passion of Perpetua and Felicitas The early-third-century account of the martyrdom of Perpetua and Felici- tas provides another use of Dan 7:9-14 that parallels the interests of Acts 7 and Rev 4-5. In this work there is a series of visions that testify not only to an evolv- ing Christian understanding of Dan 7 but also to the continuing mystical inter- ests of early Christianity, ,interests that bear a close resemblance to merkavah mysticism.50 Carthage, the home of Perpetua, had a church of Jewish origins.51 Tertullian, who lived in Carthage as a near contemporary of Perpetua, describes how the visionary experiences of certain individuals were inscribed for later examination (On the Soul 9),52 much as we have in the Passion of Perpetua and Felicitas. As in Acts 7 and Rev 4-5 we find a captive visionary, an enthroned deity and his court, a standing figure who is empowered, and a threatening situation that involves danger, suffering, and death. While the visions of the Passion of Perpetua and Felicitas display an interest in the persecutions of the early third century, their use of Dan 7 is detectable and appears to be fundamental to their message. 3 1 saw a ladder of tremendous height made of bronze, reaching all the way to the heavens, but it was so narrow that only one person could climb up at a time. To the sides of the ladder were attached all sorts of metal weapons: there were swords, spears, hooks, daggers, and spikes; so that if anyone tried to climb up carelessly or without paying attention, he would be mangled and 49 Direct references include Rev 2:2-7, 9-11, 13-17, 19-29; 3:8-13. Indirect references include 6:9-11; 11:1-12; 13:7, 15; 14:12-13; 18:4-5. 50 Rowland has argued that the Passion of Perpetua and Felicitas is tied to the Jewish mystical tradition (Open Heaven, 399). C. Robeck writes that Perpetua's spiritual life "seems to have included extensive introduction to Jewish apocalyptic elements. Thus, in addition to the secular factors that could have provided parallels, Perpetua was surely affected also by the Christian instruction she received, Christian instruction drawing from its Jewish heritage as well as from early Christian writings" (Prophecy in Carthage: Perpetua, Tertullian, and Cyprian [Cleveland: Pilgrim, 1992], 22). 51 J. Salisbury argues for the origins of the Christian community in the extensive Jewish com- munity of Carthage (Perpetua's Passion: The Death and Memory of a Young Roman Woman [New York: Routledge, 1997], 59-62). 52 Salisbury highlights this practice (Perpetua's Passion, 92).</page><page sequence="16">318 Journal of Biblical Literature his flesh would adhere to the weapons. 4 At the foot of the ladder lay a dragon of enormous size, and it would attack those who tried to climb up and try to terrify them from doing so. 5 And Saturus was the first to go up, he who was later to give himself up of his own accord. He had been the builder of our strength, although he was not present when we were arrested. 6 And he arrived at the top of the staircase and he looked back and said to me: Per- petua, I am waiting for you. But take care; do not let the dragon bite you." "He will not harm me," I said, "in the name of Christ Jesus." 7 Slowly, as though he were afraid of me, the dragon stuck his head out from underneath the ladder. Then using it as my first step, I trod on his head and went up. 8 Then I saw an immense garden, and in it a grey-haired man sat in shep- herd's garb; tall he was, and milking sheep. And standing around him were many thousands of people clad in white garments. 9 He raised his head, looked at me, and said: "I am glad you have come my child." He called me over to him and gave me, as it were, a mouthful of the milk he was drawing; and I took it into my hands and consumed it. And all those who stood around said, "Amen!" (Passion of Perpetua and Felicitas 4.3-9)53 Perpetua's first vision in the Passion of Perpetua and Felicitas informs her about her eventual suffering and martyrdom. While it shows the imprint of sev- eral different passages, Dan 7 needs to be identified as an important influ- ence.54 Like Daniel the visionary, Perpetua experiences the vision as a captive who lives under threatening conditions and faces martyrdom. After climbing the ladder to heaven under a severe threat, a common mystical interest,55 Per- petua sees a "gray-haired man" who was sitting, an allusion to the enthroned, white-haired Ancient of Days (Dan 7:9). She presumably stands before him. There are "many thousands" of people clad in "white garments" who are stand- ing in his presence, an allusion to Daniel's throne room scene with its thousands of standing attendants (Dan 7:10). Even the dragon, who in all likelihood frightened Perpetua, though she did tread upon it, makes sense in light of Dan 7. It can be understood as alluding to the terrifying fourth beast of Dan 7:11 that so frightened Daniel and was described as making war against the "holy ones."56 53 Translations of The Passion of Perpetua and Felicitas are from Herbert Musurillo, The Acts of the Christian Martyrs (OECT; Oxford: Clarendon, 1972). 54 Robeck has examined the Passion of Perpetua and Felicitas and identified the passages, such as Dan 7, that show some connection to its visions and the elements of local color that root the text in third-century Carthage (Prophecy in Carthage, 19-86). There is no question that this text's visions show the influence of several texts (i.e., the ladder Perpetua climbs alludes to the ladder Jacob sees in Gen 28; the garden that she ascends to suggests the influence of the Revelation of Peter, where Peter ascends to a garden), but it is my argument that Dan 7 has been overlooked as an important contributor. 55 Rowland, Open Heaven, 398; and Gruenwald, Apocalyptic and Merkavah Mysticism, 120. 56 According to 4:4, the dragon frightens those who wished to ascend the ladder. The apoc- ryphal account of Bel and the Dragon also connects the Daniel tradition with Perpetua's vision. In</page><page sequence="17">Munoa: Jesus, the Merkabah, and Martyrdom 319 While there is some textual mediation at work in this vision, with Dan 7 being passed on through the Revelation of John, Dan 7's influence is central to the vision.57 Both Daniel and Revelation refer to a throne room scene with many attendants. Revelation has a dragon that pursues God's people by means of a beast that seeks to destroy them (Rev 12:17-13:8), an obvious allusion to the fourth beast of Dan 7 that is interpreted as a kingdom that shall "devour the whole earth," and is ruled by a king who will "wear out the holy ones of the most high" (Dan 7:23-25). A direct use of Daniel is unmistakable, however, in this vision's description of a "white-haired man sitting." While Revelation's throne room scene refers to God as sitting, he is described as looking "like jasper and carnelian" (Rev 5:3). Daniel 7:9 must have been used since it is the only extant text that has a throne room scene with a white-haired figure who is sitting.58 The most provocative influence of Dan 7 in the Passion of Perpetua and Felicitas involves the role that Perpetua plays as she ascends to heaven, over- comes the dragon, and is then welcomed and "gifted" by the seated gray-haired man. Perpetua's ascent on the ladder to heaven can be understood in connec- tion with the arrival of "one like a son of man" before the enthroned "Ancient of Days," who is described as "coming on the clouds of heaven" (Dan 7:13) and then is empowered. Her ascent over the dragon signifies its defeat and the seated figure's gift of milk is a reward for her victory. Perpetua is thus patterned after Daniel's "one like a son of man." For most Christian readers the "one like a son of man" is Jesus, the one who after his victory, achieved through suffering and death, went on to empowerment. Perpetua's first vision thus recalls Stephen's suffering experience when he fought the "beastly" crowd, and Revelation's message that those who overcome the beast (who is animated by a dragon [Rev 12:8-13:1]) through suffering and that story Daniel is able to overthrow the cult of the dragon, while Perpetua is able to "tread upon his head." The dragon also suggests Rev 12, where a red dragon is thrown out of heaven and goes to earth on a rampage persecuting Jesus' followers. However, in this setting, with the clear use of Dan 7, it is best to credit Dan 7 as a central influence upon the vision. 57 There is no doubt that biblical texts were mediated through other biblical and nonbiblical texts that were used by the early Christians. In the instance of the Passion ofPerpetua and Felicitas, the Revelation of John appears to be the conduit for Dan 7. This does not make the author's use of Daniel any less real, but it may make it less intentional, and maybe even less conscious, though it is difficult to say with any certainty what the author's intentions or consciousness may have been. Per- haps it was the Daniel-like features of the Revelation of John that attracted the author. It is within the reach of scholars to argue for the influence or use of a biblical text, but whether the writer was intentionally or consciously using a text is more difficult when the usage under question is not a direct quotation. The human imagination is limited, and it not out of the question to suggest that biblical texts, both consciously and unconsciously, provided early Christians with the resources they needed to express their experiences and faith. 58 Jesus is described in Revelation with white hair in a passage that is indebted to Dan 7, but he is neither in a throne room nor is he sitting (Rev 1:12-20).</page><page sequence="18">320 Journal of Biblical Literature death will be rewarded like Jesus the Lamb, who conquered through suffering. This vision's message that Perpetua will be martyred underscores its signifi- cance. Another vision in the Passion of Perpetua and Felicitas further illustrates the influence of Dan 7. Perpetua's third vision describes her triumph over an Egyptian gladiator. While it is set against the backdrop of gladiatorial combat in the third century, there are aspects that relate it to her first vision and to the teachings of Dan 7. 1 The day before we were to fight with the beast I saw the following vision. Pomponius the deacon came to the prison gates and he began to knock vio- lently. 2 I went out and opened the gate for him. He was dressed in an unbelted white tunic, wearing elaborate sandals. 3 And he said to me, "Per- petua, come; we are waiting for you." Then he took my hand and we began to walk through rough and broken country. 4 At last we came to the amphithe- atre out of breath, and he led me into the middle of the arena. Then he told me, "Do not be afraid. I am here, struggling with you." Then he left. 5 I looked at the enormous crowd who watched in astonishment. I was surprised that no beasts were let loose on me; for I knew that I was condemned to die by the beasts. 6 Then out came an Egyptian against me, of vicious appear- ance, together with his seconds, to fight with me. There also came up to me some handsome young men to be my seconds and assistants. 7 My clothes were stripped off, and suddenly I was a man. My seconds began to rub me down with oil (as they were wont to do before a contest). Then I saw the Egyptian on the other side rolling in the dust. 8 Next there came forth a man of marvelous stature, such that he rose above the top of the amphitheatre. He was clad in a beltless purple tunic with two stripes (one on either side) run- ning down the middle of his chest. He wore sandals that were wondrously made of gold and silver, and he carried a wand like an athletic trainer and a green branch on which there were golden apples. 9 And he asked for silence, and said, "If this Egyptian defeats her he will slay her with the sword. But if she defeats him, she will receive this branch. 10 Then he withdrew. We drew close to one another and began to let our fists fly. My opponent tried to get hold of my feet, but I kept striking him in the face with the heels of my feet. 11 Then I was raised up into the air and I began to pummel him without as it were touching the ground. Then when I noticed there was a lull, I put my two hands together linking the fingers of one hand with the other and thus I got hold of his head. He fell flat on his face and I stepped on his head. 12 The crowd began to shout and my assistants started to sing psalms. Then I walked up to the trainer and took the branch. He kissed me and said to me: "Peace be with you, my daughter!" I began to walk in triumph towards the Gate of Life. 14 Then I awoke. I realized that it was not with wild animals that I would fight but with the Devil, but I knew that I would win the victory. (Pas- sion of Perpetua and Felicitas 10.1-14) This third vision develops the first vision's themes of her successful com- bat against a fearsome enemy and of her reward. Perpetua's enemy is not a</page><page sequence="19">Munoa: Jesus, the Merkabah, and Martyrdom 321 dragon, but an "Egyptian," who is described as "vicious" in appearance, and in this way the third vision continues the first vision's allusion to Daniel's "terrify- ing and dreadful" fourth beast (Dan 7:7). Like Dan 7:9-14, there is an unnamed figure, akin to the "one like a son of man," who in Perpetua's vision is an authority figure who acts as a judge in the contest. Judgment is a common inference in texts that interpret Dan 7's "one like a son of man."59 Perpetua gazes upon this figure, like Stephen does upon Jesus the "Son of Man" in Acts 7 and John does upon Jesus the "Lamb" in Revelation. The unnamed figure is the one who welcomes Perpetua after her victory (when she walks up to him and presumably stands before him), commends her, and implicitly permits her to go through the Gate of Life to her heavenly reward. That the unnamed figure, act- ing out the role of the "one like a son of man," is Jesus, is implied by his great height, a characteristic of Jesus in early Christian literature.60 This vision's por- trayal of Jesus as a trainer of gladiators who promises rewards calls to mind the portrayal of Jesus in Revelation, where, as "one like a Son of Man" (Rev 1:13), he speaks to the Asian churches, counsels them regarding the means of victory, and promises rewards to the victors who conquer their enemies (Rev 2:7, 11, 17, 26-28; 3:5, 12, 21). This third vision appears to have preserved the interests of Dan 7 through the mediation of Revelation.61 9 See Matt 19:28; 25:31; John 5:27; 1 En. 69:29; T. Abr. 13:2, 5. These interpretations of Dan 7:13-14 appear to infer that the empowerment of the "one like a son of man" involves enthrone- ment and the authority to judge. 60 E.g., Gospel of Peter 10.39. See also the Shepherd of Hermas Sim. 9.6.1 and the Book of Elchasai (Hippol. Ref. 9.13.1-3). The great size of Jesus' body may be best understood in light of Shi'ur Qomah speculations, that is, Jewish mystical speculations over the corporeal appearance of God (Gruenwald, Apocalyptic and Merkavah Mysticism, 94-97). 61 Perpetua's metamorphosis into a "man" (10:7) is one of the most puzzling aspects of this vision and may be understandable in terms of Dan 7. Explanations for Perpetua's gender transfor- mation have ranged far and wide. E. Pagels's comments on Logion 114 of the Gospel of Thomas (where Jesus will make Mary male so she can enter the kingdom) suggest a Gnostic interpretation that sees the male form as the preferred divine form and the female form as merely human (The Gnostic Gospels [New York: Vantage Books/Random House, 1981], 81). S. Maitland argues that Perpetua's manhood represents a suppression of feminine characteristics ("Passionate Prayer: Masochistic Images in Women's Experience," in Sex and God: Some Varieties of Women's Reli- gious Experience [ed. L. Hurcombe; New York: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1987], 130-31). D. Scholer favors a view akin to that put forth by Augustine, which sees Perpetua's transformation as an example of a woman's empowerment in the church ("'And I was a Man': The Power and Prob- lem of Perpetua" Daughters of Sarah 15 [1989]: 10-14). L. Sullivan holds that Perpetua appropri- ates the imagery of the dominant (a powerful male body) in order to converse on the dominant's terms ("'I responded, I will not .. .': Christianity as Catalyst for Resistance in the Passio Perpetuae et Felicitatis," Semeia 79 [1997]: 73). However, if Dan 7 is understood as teaching that the "one like a son of man" is the one who is victorious over the beasts and thus came to be empowered in God's presence, as writings such as Acts and Revelation suggest, and as early Christians believed, then suffering Christian readers may have modeled themselves after Jesus, their "one like a son of man," when they faced their "beast." They thus thought of themselves as becoming like him, a "man,"</page><page sequence="20">322 Journal of Biblical Literature The fourth and last vision in the Passion of Perpetua and Felicitas is associ- ated with Saturus, Perpetua's fellow martyr, and makes use of Dan 7 in the same way that the first vision does. It presents the suffering martyrs as those who through victorious combat (martyrdom) appear before God and are rewarded for their victory. 2 We had died, he said, and had put off the flesh, and we began to be carried towards the east by four angels who did not touch us with their hands. 3 But we moved along not on our backs facing upwards but as though we were climbing up a gentle hill. 4 And when we were free of the world, we first saw an intense light. And I said to Perpetua (for she was at my side): "This is what the Lord promised us. We have received his promise." 5 While we were being carried by these four angels, a great open space appeared, which seemed to be a garden, with rose bushes and all manner of flowers. 6 The trees were as tall as cypresses, and their leaves were constantly falling. 7 In the garden there were four other angels more splendid than the others. When they saw us they paid homage and said to the other angels in admira- tion: "Why, they are here! They are here!" Then the four angels that were carrying us grew fearful and set us down. 8 Then we walked across to an open area by way of a broad road, 9 and there we met Jucundus, Saturninus, and Artaxius, who were burnt alive in the same persecution, together with Quin- tus who had actually died as a martyr in prison. We asked them where they had been. 10 And the other angels said to us: "First come and enter and greet the Lord." 12:1 Then we came to a place whose walls seemed to be con- structed of light. And in front of the gate stood four angels, who entered in and put on white robes. 2 We also entered and we heard the sound of voices in unison chanting endlessly: "Holy, holy, holy!" 3 In the same place we seemed to see an aged man with white hair and a youthful face, though we did not see his feet. 4 On his right and left were four elders, and behind them stood other aged men. 5 Surprised, we entered and stood before a throne: four angels lifted us up and we kissed the aged man and he touched our faces with his hand. 6 And the elders said to us: "Let us rise." And we rose and gave the kiss of peace. Then the elders said to us: "Go and play." (Passion of Per- petua and Felicitas 11.2-12.7) Saturus relates that he and Perpetua ascended to heaven after their death as martyrs, that they stood before an aged, enthroned, white-haired man with a when they faced their "beast." Perpetua remains a woman, as Jesus the "athletic trainer" makes clear (saying "her" in 10:9), but she is reenacting the role of the original "one like a son of man" in her battle. Before her suffering, Jesus, her trainer-judge, offers encouragement. After her victori- ous combat, Jesus, the empowered "one like a son of man" who went before her as a victor through death, is the judge who commends and rewards her. Therefore, in conflict, Christians modeled themselves after Jesus.</page><page sequence="21">Munoa: Jesus, the Merkabah, and Martyrdom 323 youthful face (an idea that shows clear use of Dan 7:1362) who was surrounded by standing attendants, and that this sitting figure accepted them into his pres- ence. The whole scene, though it makes use of texts like Revelation, is clearly dependent on Dan 7 and affirms the idea that Christians read Dan 7 in a way that joined their suffering as martyrs with the role played by the "one like son of man."63 Apparently the experience of Christian martyrdom produced an innova- tive tradition of interpretation of Dan 7. The vision of Dan 7 is adapted in Acts, Revelation, and the Passion of Perpetua and Felicitas in light of the fatal encounters of Jesus' followers with their earthly enemies. Their deaths are pre- sented as reenactments of the conflict of the "one like a son of man" with the devil, and his reward for victory is a guarantee of their reward for faithful mar- tyrdom. V. Jesus, the Merkavah, and Martyrdom in Early Christian Tradition Acts, Revelation, and the Passion of Perpetua and Felicitas illustrate how vision and crisis went hand in hand in early Christianity. In these passages it is the beleaguered, suffering followers of Jesus, facing martyrdom, who were granted visions of the heavenly throne room and its occupants. The merkavah vision of Dan 7 served as the framework for these visions and was adapted to fit the circumstances of each visionary, who in several instances reenacted the task of the "one like a son of man." These Christian merkavah visions served the purpose of strengthening and encouraging their recipients as they faced their hour of conflict.4 One difference of these merkavah texts from other such texts 62 Rowland notes that the youthful appearance of the aged man must serve as a christophany and that it is Christ who appears with the characteristics of God (Open Heaven, 401). Rowland may be correct, but the presentation of an aged figure with a youthful appearance can also be under- stood as an exegetical inference from Dan 7:9-14. As Rowland himself points out concerning Dan 7:13, "whereas Theodotion follows the Hebrew and translates 'and he came to the Ancient of Days' [Dan 7:13], the LXX translates the same Hebrew phrase in the following way, 'he came as the Ancient of Days."' Rowland goes on to note how this variant suggests that the "one like a son of man" is an embodiment of the person of the "Ancient of Days" (Open Heaven, 98). For the fourth vision of Perpetua this means that the aged figure with a youthful face can be exegetically traced to Dan 7. A. Green has demonstrated how Jewish tradition portrays God as both an old man and a young man ("The Children in Egypt and the Theophany at the Sea,"Jud 24 [1975]: 446-56). Reve- lation's teaching that Jesus shares God's throne may also have contributed to the double appear- ance of the enthroned figure in Saturus's vision. 63 Both Rowland (Open Heaven, 401) and Robeck (Prophecy in Carthage, 70-86) make note of Revelation's influence, but as mentioned in connection with the first vision, only Dan 7 presents a white-haired figure on a throne. 64 I. Chernus has suggested that merkavah mysticism, in which adherents sought a glimpse of</page><page sequence="22">324 Journal of Biblical Literature involves mystical rituals: there are no rituals that might prompt the mystical experience, apart from the cruel circumstances of facing death as a faithful martyr.65 The tradition of Jesus' passion and the ongoing threat of martyrdom in the first three centuries evidently stimulated an interpretation of Dan 7 among Christians that saw martyrdom, understood as combat against the devil, as a means of glory and as a basis for visions.66 First-century B.C.E. Jewish texts such as 2 Maccabees had already taught that faithful martyrdom led to resurrection (2 Macc 7:9, 14, 23, 29). Jesus' words according to Mark 14:62, spoken when he faced death, about "seeing the Son of Man ... coming on the clouds of heaven" (Dan 7:13) built up an expectation of seeing Jesus.67 The teaching that one would see Jesus at the time of death was known in the Jesus community (Phil 1:23), as were the ideas of believers in combat with the devil (Eph 6:11-13; Rev 12:17; 1 Pet 5:8), suffering with Jesus with glory as a reward (Rom 8:17), and death as a "gain" (Phil 1:21). There are also texts, sharing a dependence on Dan 7:13-14, that portray Jesus as the "Son of Man" who handles the judgment of the living and the dead.68 The association of martyrdom and vision may help explain the zeal of God upon his throne, may have been understood as a prefiguring of the destiny of the righteous (Mysticism in Rabbinic Judaism [New York: de Gruyter, 1982], 86). Chernus also relates the signif- icance of death and vision in Jewish mysticism to M. Eliade's view of initiatory death, and there may be some relevance for the early Christian interest in following Jesus in his death (Mysticism in Rab- binic Judaism, 49-52). Eliade argues that the death of an initiate can be seen as a repetition of the death of the cult founder, which results in the initiate's sharing in the supernatural conditions of the founder, the initiatory death being a necessity for spiritual regeneration (Rites and Symbols of Initi- ation: The Mysteries of Birth and Rebirth [trans. W. R. Trask; New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1965], 131). 65 Acts 23:11 reads in a way that recalls the interests of Acts 7:55-56 and the visions of the Passion of Perpetua and Felicitas concerning crisis and vision. After Paul had forcefully been arrested when a violent mob sought to kill him, Acts says, "That night the Lord stood near him and said, 'Keep up your courage! For just as you have testified for me in Jerusalem, so you must bear witness also in Rome." Jewish literature as represented by the Jewish Bible, the Apocrypha, the Pseudepigrapha, Merkavah texts, and Hekhalot texts identifies practices such as prayer, fasting, special diets, bathing rituals, and theurgic practices as preparatory for mystical experiences (Gruenwald, Apocalyptic and Merkavah Mysticism, 99-103). 66 It must not be overlooked that Dan 7 itself is cast against the backdrop of Antiochus IV's bloody rule in the second century B.C.E. when Jews were martyred for their faith and helped set in motion an ideology of suffering resistance and the reward that ensues. 67 In John's Gospel Jesus promises his followers that they "will see heaven opened and angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man" (John 1:51). See A. DeConick for a discus- sion of this passage as it relates to mysticism in John's Gospel (Visions of the Mystics: Early Chris- tian Discourse in the Gospels of John and Thomas and Other Ancient Christian Literature [JSNTSup 157; Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 2001], 36-39, 116-17). 68 As cited earlier (Matt 19:28; 25:31; John 5:27).</page><page sequence="23">Munoa: Jesus, the Merkabah, and Martyrdom 325 many early Christians regarding martyrdom.69 Martyrdom after the fashion of Jesus presented some early Christians with the opportunity for a special reward and a mystical encounter with God and Jesus, the "one like a son of man."70 The Shepherd of Hermas, a second-century text, promises that the "right side of the holiness" belongs to those who "suffer for the name"(2.4),71 a promise that is strikingly similar to the vision of Stephen in Acts 7, where he sees the "Son of Man standing at the right hand of God" and Rev 3:21, where faithful Laodi- ceans are promised a place with Jesus on his throne.72 C. Robeck points out that Cyprian (of Perpetua's Carthage no less!) encouraged third-century Chris- tians with the message that they had "entered upon on the pathway of the Lord's blessing"(Epistle 6.1.2).73 What was this "blessing" (Latin dignitonus)? Robeck suggests that Cyprian "seems to have in mind something akin to Stephen's visionary experience at the moment of his martyrdom."74 An exami- nation of Dan 7 in early Christian literature supports Robeck's contention by placing this "blessing" in the larger framework of Jewish and Christian mysti- cism.75 69 The Montanists, who were particularly strong in North Africa in the third century, and their yearning for martyrdom may perhaps be understandable in these terms. 70 Gruenwald identifies how the teaching of an encounter with God in the afterlife was a point of controversy among the Tannaim, but was common in midrashic literature and in apocalyp- tic literature, and was presupposed by the Shic'ur Qomah speculations (Apocalyptic and Merkavah Mysticism, 93-94; see also G. Scholem, Jewish Mysticism, Merkabah Mysticism, and Talmudic Tradition [2d ed.; New York: Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1965], 36-42). 71 Translation from J. Lightfoot, The Apostolic Fathers (London: Macmillan, 1891). 72 According to Revelation, those who reign with Christ (and presumably are enthroned with him?) have given their lives for their devotion to him (Rev 20:4). 73 Quoted by Robeck, Prophecy in Carthage, 166. 74 Robeck, Prophecy in Carthage, 285 n. 10. 75 I wish to thank Christopher Morray-Jones for reading and commenting on an earlier draft of this paper; Barry Bandstra and Allen Verhey for their helpful remarks; and the two anonymous JBL reviewers for their constructive criticisms.</page></plain_text>
