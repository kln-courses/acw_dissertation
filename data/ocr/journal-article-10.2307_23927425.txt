It interrogates the significance of these plans to a Modernist movement that is often assumed to be secular in oudook and reveals that, despite retaining some of the angel's traditional attributes, this figure is absolutely of its time, representing an unlikely alliance of art with Nietzschean philosophy and Modemist theology. Among the questions discussed in detail are the ethical distinction that Upward makes between his own artist-angel and Nietzsche's Overman, the role of R.J. Campbell's The New Theology in suggesting an evolutionary basis for the idea that man might evolve into an angel and the echoes of Upward's Angel Club in Ezra Pound's Order of the Brothers Minor and D.H. Lawrence's Order of the Knights of Rananim. On i October I9i3,the Londonjoumal the New Freewoman published a short article, entitled 'The Angel Club'. This piece, signed only by 'The Chancellor', is probably one of several by the poet and critic Allen Upward in which he demands the creation of a new organisation or, as announced in the title of this article, a new club comprised of men with particular 'angehe' gifts. Also appearing in a secondjoumal, The New Age, in 1910 under the title 'The Order of the Seraphim', Upward's articles were published alongside essays and stories by some of the most well-known figures of literary modernism: Ezra Pound, Wyndham Lewis, Katherine Mansfield and T.E. Hulme among others. They were certainly read by Pound and could also have been seen by his fellow contributors or by the sometime readers of the New Age, D.H. Lawrence and T.S. Eliot. Despite the clues contained within their reception, however, Upward's 'Angel Club' articles are rarely considered, as they are in this article, as making a contribution to literary modernism. Modernism, it is often assumed, was the product of a disillusioned moment, of a loss of faith in the old certainties Literature &amp; Theology © The Author 2007.

While this secular understanding of the period has rightly been challenged — the influence ofTheosophy and spiritualism on writers such as Pound, Yeats and Lawrence is now widely recognised — it remains difficult to situate Upward's angels within the 'occult' modernism that is frequently offered in its stead.2 Created from an unlikely affiance of Modemist Theology in the Anglican and Nonconformist Churches, Nietzschean philosophy and the example set by the Hospitaller Knights of St John, these are professional angels whose business it is to act as a 'trades-union of poets, the patent agency of inventors'.3 Upward's desire to give the felt superiority of certain creative men an institutional shape is precisely the point at which the idea of an Angel Club or an Order of the Seraphim intersects with a number of other, more recognisably modemist, creations. It recalls Ezra Pound's Order of the Brothers Minor — a club consisting only of two members, Pound and Yeats4 — and D.H. Lawrence's similarly titled Order of the Knights ofRananim, both of which are discussed later in this article. This is not to suggest that the desire to form an exclusive club of writers and artists was new to the twentieth century. On the contrary, Upward's Order of the Seraphim draws upon a number of nineteenth-century precedents including Thomas Carlyle's 'Aristocracy of Talent', openly acknowledged by Upward as a source of inspiration, John Ruskin's St George's Guild and William Morris's Order of Sir Galahad. Differing in purpose and in organisation, all of these groups nonetheless shared a view of the modem world as corrupt (a corruption often expressed in the debased condition of arts and crafts) joined with a romanticised vision of medieval military orders as the mysterious centres of creative life and spiritual renewal. What is, however, new about the Angel Club is the recognisably twentieth-century horizon which it assists in opening up. Suggested in response to the need to provide a non-human goal for human development on the one hand, and the need to resist Nietzschean cruelty or inhumanity on the other, the Angel Club, along with the Order of the Knights of Rananim and the Order of the Brothers Minor, promised to bring into existence a redemptive and benevolent model of artistic practice. The purpose of this article is to explore this new horizon, showing how the Angel Club takes shape in opposition to the goals that philosophical, theological and aesthetic thought had attached to human existence. Section One thus reveals how Upward's angels were conceived in dialectical relation to two contemporary secular ideals for the development of the human race: first, the 'Man-God' which had been inherited from the humanist doctrines of thinkers such as Rousseau and Voltaire; and second, the 'Overman' which appeared towards the end of the nineteenth century in the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche. This section argues that although Nietzsche's Overman is</page><page sequence="3">50 ALLEN UPWARD AND 'THE ANGEL CLUB' itself an overcoming of the merely human, a protest against the Rousseauian notion that there is something potentially God-like or perfectible in the average human being, Upward sees in this figure something that, to his eyes, remains disappointingly all-too-human. Upward recognises a cruel and tyrannous nature in the Overman which speaks to him not of inhumanity, but paradoxically of the most basic of human instincts. The angel, in contrast, is associated by Upward with traditionally 'humanistic' impulses, impulses that he nonetheless insists are 'non-human' as opposed to the all-too-human tendency to idealise Rousseauian herd values on the one hand and Nietzschean self-assertion and mastery on the other. Not only, however, does membership of Upward's Angel Club imply a rejection of these secular goals for human becoming, it also suggests a refusal of the biblical promise that man should one day become like the angels. Section two of this article argues that Upward found a model for the angelic nature of his recruits not in the personified human attributes that constitute the angels of Jewish—Christian tradition, but rather in contemporary accounts of God as a mysterious and transcendent life-force or energy source. Thus Upward's angels are said to have evolved 'superhuman' abilities such as the capacity to receive wireless transmissions from 'unseen realms' and the ability to transcend their physical desires or even to overcome their material existence becoming instead mere thought-form or language. A secondary concern of section two is the extent to which these advances beyond the physical are uncomfortably suggestive of an advance beyond the 'female', understood by a number of Upward's fellow contributors to the New Age as inseparable from her physical and sexualised nature. After questioning both the manhood and the angelhood of Upward's peculiar angels, this article turns in its final section to another area of enquiry in order to classify the members of the Angel Club. Here along with the members of Lawrence's Order of the Knights of Rananim and Pound's Order of the Brother's Minor, Upward's angels are said to embody an aesthetic rather than an existential goal: namely, the modemist dream, not of demysti fying and secularising art, but rather of finding a way to reconcile its divine status with the material and physical conditions of life in the modem world. I. SECULAR IDEALS: ROUSSEAU S MAN-GOD AND NIETZSCHE S 'ORDER OF devils' Allen Upward is chiefly remembered as an Imagist poet, a friend of and acknowledged influence on Ezra Pound. He was also the author of popular fiction and of two well-reviewed books which might tentatively be described as theosophical-scientiflc meditations on the future of human life, The New Word (1907) and The Divine Mystery (1913). In 1910, Upward submitted a series of three articles to the New Age, entitled collectively 'The Order of the</page><page sequence="4">SUZANNE HOBSON 51 Seraphim'. Conceived initially as a sequel to The New Word, these articles present for the first time his idea of founding an order of angels that would act as an intermediary between man and a divine, altogether non-human telos for individual and species becoming. In the second of these articles, he uses the image of a 'tree of life' to describe the position of the members of the angel club in relation to their less fortunate peers: Genius is the power of being sensitive to what is divine. The man of genius, the last delicate bud that sprouts from the tree of man, may be compared to the slender wire that rises from the receiving station to catch the unseen message that comes across the sea from an unseen continent.5 The genius is the very final flowering of man; it is his duty to reach outwards to an as yet 'unseen' and thus presumably post- or superhuman realm. In 'The Angel Club' published three years later, Upward confirms that the chief responsibility of his angels is to strive towards an extra-anthropological goal: 'our name is not intended to denote that we are angels but only that we have some higher pattern before our eyes than Humanity'.6 Upward's insistence on this point is an attempt to correct the error he attributes to Rousseau and to his democratically minded successors: the belief that there is no higher goal than that of the perfect human and, further, that all men in a free and democratic state have the potential to reach this goal. This misplaced faith in humankind is what Upward terms elsewhere 'anthropolatry' or the idolatrous religion of Humanity and it leads only to the unfortunate reduction of all humans to the same 'average' level.7 There are strong echoes of Nietzsche in Upward's attack on democratic mediocrity, specifically, of Nietzsche's Übermensch or, to use Upward's preferred expression, the 'Overman', and of Nietzsche's denunciation of 'herd' values. These echoes are unlikely to be coincidental as the journal in which 'The Order of the Seraphim' first appeared, the New Age, played a crucial role in introducing the work of this philosopher to an English audience and, in so doing, provided a forum for a number of figures who shared his anti-humanist and anti-democratic views. Recent scholarship on the New Age has tended to emphasise the crude and frequently bigoted nature of such views in the hands of the journal's contributors. Thus Anne Femihough unmasks the anti-feminist, pro-eugenicist attitude of writers such as Hulme and Upward, much of which, she claims, 'was the legacy of Nietzsche who had associated democracy with herd values'.8 Charles Ferrall is only marginally more sympathetic, pointing out that the proponents of what he calls 'artist-as aristocrat cant' in the New Age were often extremely crude readers of Nietzsche's work.9 Ferrall refers in this striking phrase to a strand of thinking that adopts the Overman or alternatively, the master who is defeated in</page><page sequence="5">52 ALLEN UPWARD AND 'THE ANGEL CLUB' Nietzsche's version of the master-slave opposition, as the model to which the modem-day artist should aspire. Taking literally Nietzsche's statements to the effect that the masters who once commanded the world were 'the most involuntary, unconscious artists there are', a number of commentators demand the creation of a race of artists who, in their own way, impress form and order upon a chaotic world.10 A striking example of this hubris is supplied by A.M. Ludovici who in the New Age and in his book Nietzsche and Art declares that the artist is a 'man-God' and his task akin to that of an Egyptian God who gave birth to the world by naming its constituent parts.11 Ludovici makes no apologies for turning his artist into a tyrannical slave-driver. If only, he suggests in Nietzsche and Art, his critics would return to their history books, then they would discover that the slaves in ancient Egypt were more than happy to live under the wise and creative rale of a creative master: 'It was with great rejoicings, and not, as Buckle and Spencer thought, with the woeful and haggard faces of ill-used slaves, that his [King Khephrën's] people assembled annually to continue and to complete the building of his pyramid.'12 Upward's race of angels — 'the trades-union of poets' — are evidently from the same mould. They too would be responsible for directing the development of life on earth, for enlisting art in the service of creating an improved and more ordered 'pattern' of being. Yet, despite their evident debt to Nietzsche, Upward insists that his artist-angels are not to be confused with his predecessor's Overmen, stating in 'The Angel Club' that 'the vogue of Nietzsche makes it necessary to distinguish between his ideal and ours' and in 'The Order of the Seraphim' that 'I shall take Nietzsche's version as the Adversary, in battle with which my own will gain a firmer outline.'13 This move is in part cynical, motivated no doubt, by the 'bad odour'14 that had accrued around Nietzsche's supposedly militaristic superman in the run up to the First World War. It is also, however, intended to be an ethical gesture; while the Overman is said to promote a cruel and tyrannical attitude to humankind, the artist-angel is associated with a more benevolent approach to the fate of the human race. Upward describes the difference between the two models in terms of the difference between an Order of Angels and an Order of Devils. For Upward, Nietzsche's diabolic Overman is not so much the type of life that will appear after the overcoming of the merely human as he is a licence to indulge in the most deplorable of all-too human impulses: cruelty and ruthlessness in the pursuit of power and then tyranny in the exercise of that power. In the Tate Gallery, Upward observes, 'there is a picture of Nietzsche's Overman crowned and throned and trampling on humanity'.15 Not previously identified, this picture is certainly George Frederic Watts's Mammon, presented to the Tate on its opening in 1897 and still on display today. The painting's title, referring to the god of riches, along with its depiction of</page><page sequence="6">SUZANNE HOBSON 53 a monstrous king crushing men beneath his feet is a terrifying illustration of Upward's contention that Nietzsche's Order of Devils is a collection of tyrants with 'conquering, capitalist, militarist [and] imperialist' natures.16 Life under the yoke of these grasping and violent 'slave-drivers' would be akin to that of slaves, who, in this version needless to say, would not be rejoicing in their captivity. Upward's disgust with Nietzsche's Overman anticipates more recent critical commentary on the 'outlandish and scandalous'17 nature of the Nietzschean 'artist-as-aristocrat cant' in the New Age. In Upward's case, however, the scandal proceeds not from the fact that the promise of the Overman leads to an unpalatable elitism linked to eugenics and misogyny (though for reasons discussed below Upward was by no means in favour of eugenics), but that, as a model for potential recruits to the Angel Club, the Overman is not exclusive enough. As long as he is identified in terms of worldly, in other words capitalist and imperialist success, the Overman remains all too-human, failing in the necessary task of inaugurating a new set of post anthropolatrous values. As Wyndham Lewis puts it in the preface that he added to his novel Tarr in 1918, Nietzsche's books 'have made an Over-man of every vulgarly energetic grocer in Europe'.18 This critique of Nietzsche, found not only in Upward and Lewis, but also in D.H. Lawrence, undoubtedly reveals less about Nietzsche's own more complex version of the Overman than it does about the crude reading of this figure offered by critics such as Ludovici, and about the prejudices of a group of writers for whom 'grocer' is a favourite term of abuse. Nonetheless, it is worth consideration: primarily, because it reveals a more ambivalent attitude to Nietzsche in the New Age than is often acknowledged, but also because it provides an indication of what is at stake for Upward and his peers in the transformation of the Overman into the angel, namely, the possibility of inaugurating an art that is non-human (or non-anthropolatrous) without resorting to Nietzschean inhumanity. The complex distinction between these positions is established through a series of dialectical relations: first, Upward reveals that supposed opposites (the Man-God and the Overman) are in fact different facets of the same merely human ideal; second, he throws this human ideal into an antagonistic relationship with a third pole, (the 'non-human' angels); and, finally, this third non-human pole is revealed to be closer to the traditionally 'humanistic' than the debased humanity represented by the first merely human position (the Overman and Man-God). It is thus in dialectical relation to Nietzsche's cruel, imperialistic and militaristic masters, in relation to their all-too-human desires and impulses, that Upward's Angel Club takes on both the superhuman promise that the Overman fails to fulfil and the traditionally 'human' qualities and attributes that this figure manifestly does not possess. For Upward these attributes are benevolence as revealed in the club's role as an advisor to man, pacifism in its members' pursuit of</page><page sequence="7">54 ALLEN UPWARD AND 'THE ANGEL CLUB' the peaceful life away from worldly conflict and a social conscience as demonstrated in its function as trades-union to the under-represented. As Upward himself says in 'The Angel Club', this club has more in common with the 'little child' imagined by Jesus than it does the fiery Overman of Nietzsche.19 II. SACRED IDEALS: MODERNIST THEOLOGY AND UPWARD S 'order of the seraphim' It is not, however, immediately clear what it is about the angel that suggests this figure as a more appropriate model for Upward's geniuses than Nietzsche's Overman. The name of his club, to return to Upward's explanation in 'The Angel Club', is meant to imply that its members have 'some higher pattern before our eyes than Humanity'. Yet, across a number of traditions, angels have a far more complicated relationship with humanity than this statement suggests. Most famously, as Carl Jung reminds the reader in his study of world religions, in Genesis 6:2 'the sons of God' developed a liking for the 'daughters of men'. It is for this reason, Jung continues, that as late as the nineteenth century, women in German churches were requested to cover their heads lest they should excite the passions of the angelic host.20 Massimo Cacciari's speculative study of angelology, The Necessary Angel, also highlights the temptation that man represents for the angel. Cacciari suggests that the attempts of fallen angels such as the Islamic Iblis and the talmudic Samael to 'seduce humankind' from good works, is rooted in their desire to avenge their own original seduction from the 'circle around the throne'.21 The angel that Upward has in mind as the model for potential recruits to his club is certainly not possessed of the all-too-human desires of these Fallen angels; nor, for that matter, is he endowed with the revolutionary spirit that Milton and Blake attribute to the same Satanic figures. Instead, at first sight Upward's version appears more conservative in nature. Like the figure beloved of the popular Victorian imagination, this angel is a paragon of virtue, chastity and selfless devotion to duty. To dismiss this creation as wholly conventional, however, would be to overlook two crucial areas in which Upward's angel goes against precedent. Primarily, while he could have derived a similar picture of the angel from countless works of literature and religious texts, Upward's sources were more radical in nature, encompassing what, for his time, were the latest developments in theological and scientific thought. Secondly, while qualities such as obedience, chastity and selflessness are reminiscent of the domestic angels that famously populate texts such as Coventry Patmore's 'The Angel in the House', this should not be taken to mean that Upward's angel is in any sense domesticated or, more importantly, female. When Virginia Woolf attacks Patmore's version of</page><page sequence="8">SUZANNE HOBSON 55 the angel in 'Professions for Women', she acknowledges only the patriarchal ideal embodied in this figure — its ability to stand for the feminine attributes of purity, obedience and devotion to a single Lord and Master. Upward ignores this patriarchal ideal in favour of an evolutionary alternative; his angel is not a means of holding women back but of encouraging humankind forward — an aim that turns out, however, to be hardly more empowering to women than that offered by Patmore. Beginning, then, with a discussion of the evolutionary potential of Upward's angel, this section concludes with a question regarding the possibility of women reaching this goal. In 1904, in response to a severe decline in the number of people who counted themselves practising members of a congregation, the Daily Telegraph ran a series of letters entitled 'Do We Believe?' The answers to this question provided by some nine-thousand correspondents were revealing. According to the historian Hugh McLeod, one of the most common complaints about Christianity was ' "anthropomorphism", which ranked second only to "dogma" as a term of intellectual abuse'.22 Put simply, then, the Daily Telegraph readers wanted their Christianity to be a little less human. As Peter J. Bowler points out in Reconciling Science and Religion, this popular sentiment was echoed by influential movements within the Anglican and Nonconformist Churches. Collectively referred to as 'Modernists', these groups sought to replace the notion of God as transcendental creator with that of God as immanent within creation. This meant that not only could they account for the discoveries of materialist and evolutionary science (all are manifestations of God's will), but that they could also implement what for Gillian Beer represents the central post-anthropomorphic lesson of Darwinist theory: that life is not 'created' after a human model of design and execution but 'produced' in the struggle between organisms. Making God synonymous with this natural mode of production satisfies, at least theoretically, the need for a non-human deity. Despite their identical titles, Bowler is careful to distinguish the goals of Modernists in the church from literary modernists; the former, he argues, aim to foster continuity between nineteenth-century science and a twentieth-century church to which many had become indifferent, while the latter are most famously associated with Pound's call to make things new, to force a break from the past.23 In the context sketched out in this article, however, the different goals of the two movements converge on a joint commitment to transcending the human, seen, from the point of view of theological modernism, as the evolutionary/teleological aim of almost two-thousand years of Christian progress and, from the point of view of literary modernism, as the radical overthrow of around two-hundred years of misguided humanism. For Bowler, one of the most important moments in the development of modernism in the English Church was the publication in 1907 of</page><page sequence="9">56 ALLEN UPWARD AND 'THE ANGEL CLUB' R.J. Campbell's The New Theology. Campbell, a Congregationalist minister, sparked controversy by arguing that evolution was the means by which the Holy Spirit achieves His goals in the world. Applying Darwinist theory to the word of God, he concluded that Christ is an evolutionary ideal or 'unique standard of human excellence' towards which every one ought to strive if God's intention is to be successfully realised on earth.24 This argument is, on the surface, ingenious; not only does it sidestep the troubling question of the manhead or Godhead of Christ by inventing a third extra-human category, it also transforms the Christian adage to live according to Christ's law into an evolutionary imperative. Articulating the exact nature of this new standard was, however, necessarily a more troublesome affair. As Gillian Beer points out in Darwin's Plots, it is not easy to describe a process that is indifferent to humanity in a language — 'natural selection' — that seems to assume the existence of a human agent to do the selecting: 'By whom or what [is life] selected or preserved?'25 In the case of The New Theology, the language used to describe the new extra-human standard brings it perilously close to the old anthropomorphic ideal of a thinking, speaking being that has somehow escaped its material body, an idea that resonates, of course, with the popular understanding of the soul or, indeed, the angel. For Campbell, for example, the resurrection of Christ is proof that, in highly developed or 'fourth dimensional' beings, the body is but a mere 'thought-form, a kind of i j 26 language . Allen Upward's account of the angel, the sign that the members of his club have a higher pattern in mind than that of the mere human, is equally fallible when it comes to the articulation of this goal. Like Campbell, Upward employs the language of 'natural selection' to describe the development of a higher state of being. 'The Order of the Seraphim II', traces the development of the 'tree of life' from the lower branches, to which belong 'fishes, and a myriad varieties of beetles', through, curiously, the beaver, 'man's most respectable relation', to the most sophisticated form of life that can yet be imagined: The last, uppermost shoot of the tree is the most sensitive. The strongest to endure the light, it is at the same time the weakest against material might. Such is the Order of the Seraphim.27 Their weakness 'against material might' implies that this process of evolution is synonymous with the sublimation of the physical into the spiritual or, as in The New Theology, the transformation of the body into 'thought-form'. Indeed, returning to the idea that the members of the Order of the Seraphim would live in a 'city of refuge' similar to that occupied by 'the old Order of the Knights of Malta', it seems likely that by immateriality Upward means,</page><page sequence="10">SUZANNE HOBSON 57 at the very least, that they will pursue a monastic life of celibacy.28 'The Angel Club' confirms this suggestion, comparing Upward's angels to 'the order of sexless workers' in a colony of bees and noting that 'there is a very close analogy between that phenomenon and the numerous experiments of human society in the direction of celibate orders'.29 It is at this point that Upward departs from the eugenicists; the angelic being, he maintains, will never be bom or bred of sexual intercourse between a man and a woman, but rather mysteriously produced in a process that is spiritual or psychical 30 in nature. In the heavy emphasis on the sexless nature of the angehe model to which the artist aspires, it is difficult not to suspect an attempt to disqualify women from membership of the Angel Club. As feminists have long maintained, claims to neutral or universal subjecthood often presuppose that this subject is male. In the case of Upward's asexual 'angelhood', the signs provided by its intellectual and historical context are telling. In the New Age, for example, 'The Order of the Seraphim' was published around the same time as a fictional series by Orage entitled 'Tales for Men Only'. These stories describe the attempts of a group of men to fulfil their spiritual and intellectual potential; a goal that can only, it appears, be achieved if women are excluded from the group. The New Freewoman, by contrast, initially had no such reservations about the possibility of perfectly achieved female subject. Rather, it directed the efforts of its contributors to the articulation of precisely such a goal: the 'freewoman' of the journal's tide. By 1913, the year in which it published 'The Angel Club', however, this project had been superseded in the journal by other, less obviously feminist concerns. In the work of its editor Dora Marsden, for example, the ideal of the 'freewoman' had been replaced by a non-gender specific notion of fluid and open-ended becoming. Critics such as Bruce Clark point to this change in emphasis as one of the many reasons for the journal's subsequent name change from the New Freewoman to The Egoist.31 It seems possible, then, that this change of direction left room in the New Freewoman for an Angel Club that is something of a boys' club, for exacdy the same kind of boys' club that is described in 'Tales for Men Only' and, arguably, in 'The Order of the Seraphim'. These clubs envisage a non anthropomorphic horizon for human development, but nonetheless assume this horizon to be male. III. AESTHETIC IDEALS: POUND S ORDER OF THE BROTHER S MINOR and Lawrence's order of the knights of rananim The analogy used by Campbell to describe the fourth dimensional being — 'a kind of language' — is also applicable to the workings of the Angel Club. Upward intends his order to be a vehicle of communication between higher</page><page sequence="11">58 ALLEN UPWARD AND 'THE ANGEL CLUB' and lower types of life: it is the 'slender wire' that connects 'the unseen continent' to the average human, the 'trades-union' that mediates between the poet and a world in thrall to the base idols of capital and territory. It is undoubtedly in this second guise that the idea appeals to Ezra Pound, who at the time of the publication of 'The Angel Club' was the literary editor of the New Freewoman and a firm supporter of Upward's work. In a letter to the editor published in the journal the week following the appearance of 'The Angel Club', Pound refers to the Chancellor of the Order as 'one of the most intelligent men of our generation', a phrase that cannot help but recall his exaggerated praise of Upward in both the New Freewoman and the New Age as 'a very capable thinker' who 'deserves more attention than he now gets'.32 Pound reads Upward's promise in 'The Angel Club', 'to give much to genius, and expect little in return', as a commitment to establish a source of handing for the arts. Such a scheme, he adds, has never been more necessary than in the present day when the average person is given free reign in the ' "ha-penny" press and the present university and educational systems'. Pound's suggestion is probably not unreasonable, especially considering that one of the uses of the term 'angel' current at the time was to describe the financial backer of a business venture.33 Nevertheless, his letter elicits a non-committal reply from the Chancellor of the Angel Club. Mr Pound, he explains, will be immediately eligible to join the innermost circle of his Order, but the artists on behalf of whom he speaks, might be better suited to an outside rank or tier. As regards his request for the club to subsidise the arts: 'The question... is one that is only deferred until the time when our funds are sufficient for the purpose.'34 Upward's reservation, particularly as regards the possibility of making all artists full members of the Angel Club, stems from his belief that the nature of their work requires full participation in the world from which would-be members of his Order must withdraw. In his reply to Pound he states that 'they [the artists] will live where their work requires them to live and it will be our business to protect them'. Pound, in contrast, has few doubts that the rightful place of the artist is among the higher orders. The letter to the editor of the New Freewoman, describes himself and Yeats as the 'order of the Bröthen Minor', a title that is, no doubt, partly an affectionate parody of Upward, but that also, as James Logenbach points out, describes the close working relationship between the two poets during the winters they spent at Stone Cottage.35 There is also something of the 'Angel Club' about the more well-known Imagist movement founded by Pound in 1914. To reveal the nature of this similarity, it is helpful to invoke the work of a third contributor to the New Age, T.E. Hulme. Appearing in the New Age a year later than 'The Order of the Seraphim', Hulme's 'Romanticism and Classicism' is both a recapitulation of some of the concerns of Upward's piece and, as is more</page><page sequence="12">SUZANNE HOBSON 59 widely acknowledged, the inspiration behind many of the ideas expressed in Pound's Imagism. Hulme, like Upward, identifies Rousseau as the high priest of the 'Religion of Humanity', but, here departing from his predecessor, considers the chief impact of this faith to be a decline in aesthetic as well as ethical standards. The belief in the potential perfectibility of all men, Hulme claims, is directly responsible for the 'flighty' and transcendent ideals of romanticism in art.36 In order to reverse this decline, he calls for a return to the geometric and ordered forms of classicism which, like the older religions, acknowledge the fallen or limited nature of humankind. Pound's demand for an end to unnecessary ornamentation and for '[d]irect treatment of the "thing" ' is generally considered part of the same agenda. Like Hulme's classi cists and Upward's angels, Pound's Imagists are thus instructed to impress on us the sense that our world is finite and our potential limited.37 This would not be the first time that Imagism has been associated with an angelic doctrine. Andrzej Sosnowski argues that some of the key features of Imagism — verbal economy and the presentation of'an intellectual and emotional complex in an instant of time' — were suggested to Pound by Emanuel Swedenborg's language of the angels.38 On this occasion, however, the angehe echoes are not verbal and stylistic; rather, they are ideological, residing in a particular view of the human as an inadequate pattern for the future of art and of human hfe. Another variation on Upward's angel club can be discerned in D.H. Lawrence's plans to form a colony of artists and writers overseas. In a letter to S.S. Koteliansky dated 3 January 1915, Lawrence reveals the name of this community to be the Order of the Knights of Rananim, its motto to be 'Fier [Pride]' and its badge, sketched carefully in the letter, a phoenix rising from the flames.39 Although there is no evidence of direct contact between Lawrence and Upward, the similarities between the Order of the Knights of Rananim and the Order of the Seraphim are suggestive of, at least, a shared range of reference. Not only does Lawrence adopt the same model for his community as Upward -— the Hospitaller Knights — he also addresses himself to the same enemy. The 'great serpent' that will have to be destroyed if the plan for Rananim is to come to fruition is none other than Nietzsche's 'Will to Power'. Taking the popular view of this drive as the desire of one individual to gain power over another, Lawrence demands its exorcism from the fair and equitable society of Rananim in which '[w]e will be Sons of Gods who walk here [...] on earth', 'we will all be Princes, as the angels are'.40 Once again, this denial of Nietzsche is in part superficial; the ideals on which his colonists are required to build their community are very close to those identified by Nietzsche as belonging to the Overman, namely 'pride in yourself and a fundamental hostility [...] to "selflessness" '.41 As Lawrence himself puts it, '[i]t is communism based, not on poverty, but on riches, not on humility, but on pride, not on sacrifice but upon complete fulfilment in the flesh of</page><page sequence="13">6o ALLEN UPWARD AND 'THE ANGEL CLUB' all strong desire, not on forfeiture but upon inheritance'.42 Even taking into account these echoes, however, the point remains that for Lawrence, as for Upward, the creation of the perfect society is contingent on Nietzsche being wrong about the drive that underlies all other human desires. If Rananim is to come into being, its potential citizens would have to demonstrate that it is possible to overcome the Will to Power and that, like the angels, they could all be Princes. The nature of the 'angelhood' to which his colonists must aspire is explored in more detail elsewhere in Lawrence's letters and works. Given his commitment to organic and vitalist forms of life and sexuality, it should hardly be surprising that Lawrence's angels are anything but the incorporeal type that are seen in Upward. Instead, in Fra Angelico's fourteenth-century painting, The Last Judgement, he finds a model of angelhood that seems to quiver and 'palpitate' with the power of the life source that flows through them: It is time for us now to look all round, round the whole ring of the horizon — not just out of a room with a view; it is time to gather again a conception of the Whole: as Plato tried to do, and as the mediaeval men — as Fra Angelico — a conception of the beginning and the end, of heaven and hell, of good and evil flowing from God through humanity as through a filter, and returning back to god as angels and demons... I cannot forget that the Cherubim that are closest to God are absorbed in praise eternally,43 It is the absorption of the angel into this life-flow that stands as the desired goal for the citizen in Rananim. Still non-human, Lawrence's angels achieve this status, not by escaping their bodies, but by fleeing the self-consciousness that he regards as the curse of modem men and women. Among the artists and writers that Lawrence envisaged sharing in his dream of an angehe community was his one-time friend and correspondent, the American poet H.D. Looking back on this period of contact with Lawrence in a semi-autobiographical novel published in i960, H.D. offers a fictional version of a real invitation for her to join him in founding Rananim.44 At no less than six points in this novel, the H.D. character, Julia, recalls a promise from the Lawrence character, Rico, that '[w]e will go away together where the angels come down to earth'.45 Julia's considered response, after being rejected by Rico and realising that she has misunderstood the nature of their platonic bond, is to ask: 'What sort of angels?' The problem, as she sees it, is that, although Rico seems to offer a Utopian vision of a community in which men and women have equal access to the authority and spiritual fulfilment that comes with art, in reality, his 'angels' are merely a cover for a primitive dream</page><page sequence="14">SUZANNE HOBSON 61 of rapacious male sexuality: 'the actual face of Rico was projected out, it was a mask set among fruit-trees. It was Satyr in a garden'.46 The 'complete fulfilment in the flesh of all strong desires' promised to the pioneers in Rananim acquires, in H.D.'s eyes, a sinister and potentially threatening implication. 'What sort of angels?' is also a question that might reasonably be addressed to the artist-angels that make up the ranks of the Angel Club and the Order of the Brothers Minor. What sort of angel, after all, represents an ethical advance on Nietzsche's Overman, but nonetheless embodies his anti-humanist views concerning the natural inferiority of certain men and of all women? Seen in a generous light, this figure offers a means of preserving the divine status of art which requires neither the subjection of humanity to the autocratic rule of God-like artist-creators nor the subjection of the artist to the democratic tyranny of the religion of Humanity. Less sympathetically viewed, the angels in the Angel Club are a means of closing off the ranks of 'high' modemist art from the average man, and from all women. This double aspect of the Angel Club stands as testimony to a paradox at the heart of Upward's project and, arguably, at the core of Modemist writing more generally. Along with writers such as Lawrence and Pound, Upward desired to preserve an exclusive space for creative endeavour while at the same time denying the traditional guarantors ofthat space: God as supreme creator and secular authorities such as the ' "ha-penny" press and the present university and educational systems' as the arbiters of morality and artistic taste.47 What was needed, then, was a new institution that could stand, on the one hand, as a gesture of faith in the creative potential of the human — unaided by divine inspiration from the gods — and, on the other, as confirmation of the suspicion that not every human could reach these heights. It was in response to this demand that the Angel Club came into its own; equivocal, it spoke both of a quasi-religious faith in the value of human cultural achievements and of a materialist sense that humans are insignificant in a godless, though not quite angel-less, universe.
