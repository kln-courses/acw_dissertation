<plain_text><page sequence="1">212 REHTIA, THE VENETIC GODDESS OF HEALING.' By JOSHUA WHATMOUGH, B.A. (Cantab.), M.A. (Manc.), Lecturer in Classics in the University College of North Wales. 1. IN a paper read before Section H of the British Association at Manchester in 1915, Professor R. S. Conway described in detail three groups of votive offerings made to the Venetic goddess Rehtia.2 This deity, whose cult is of considerable interest as well as of no small importance to the student of early Mediterranean religion, was unknown both to W. H. Roscher (Ausfiihrliches Lexicon der griechischen und riimischen Mythologie) and even to the editors of the all but exhaustive German Real-Encyclopadie der classischen Altertumswissenschaft. Her shrine occupied part of the site now known as the Fondo Barateta near to Este (the ancient Ateste, 15 miles to the south-west of Padua), and close to the river Adige (the ancient Athesis, a tributary of the Po). The groups of offerings in question are (1) bronze statuettes of racehorses, or rather the pedestals on which the statuettes stood, for these, with the adhering hoofs of the horses, are all that has survived-none of the miniature horses from the same site will fit on to these pedestals and hoofs; (2) bronze alphabetic tablets ;3 (3) rectangular " nails " (as they are generally called), some of iron, but the majority of bronze, many of them inscribed, and with small pendant objects which were referred to by Professor Conway as " wedges." The second and third groups have never been satisfactorily explained; the present paper is an attempt to explain this third class, and, incidentally, to show more precisely than has been done hitherto what, in the first instance at any rate, the healing functions of Rehtia were in the thoughts of her worshippers. That she was a goddess of healing is inferred from the epithet frequently applied to her in the dedicatory 1 An expansion of a paper read before Section H of the British Association for the Advance- ment of Science, September, 1921 (Edinburgh meeting). 2 T owe my knowledge of the cult of Rehtia, first to the teaching of Professor R. S. Conway at Manchester in 1916, and next to the same scholar's articles Veneti in the Enc. Brit. (ed. 11, 1910-11), and Italy (Ancient) sect. 3 (9), Veneti in Hastings' Enc. of Rel. and Ethics, vol. vii (1914), and to his papers in the Proc. of the Camb. Philol. Soc. (1914, printed 1915, pp. 6 sqq.) and in the Journal of the Roy. Anthrop. Inst., vol. xlvi, 1916, pp. 221 sqq. To this last paper (with the plate accompanying it) I refer the reader for a discussion of the two groups of offerings to Rehtia not dealt with here. In publishing this paper I have to acknowledge the helpful criticisms of Professor Sir Wm. Ridgeway and of Professor Conway. I am also indebted to Mr. A. B. Cook, Reader in Classical Archwology in the University of Cambridge, for numerous references to modern arcbaeological works, for valuable assistance in selectingf the illustrations, and for readily granted permission to refer to work of his which is still in the press. 3 See Journ.

The handles are nearly always flattened out, and sometimes show an outline of rather elaborate, if not very artistic, curves (Figs. 3, 5, 8), and are pierced with one, two, or three holes through which single rings or, very rarely, short chains, are fastened ; I It is not necessary here to enter into the question what part of the verb (aor. impv. ?) or noun (of.

By far the largest number of these pins (some 180 out of the 200 odd),1 instead of bearing a real dedicatory inscription conveying a definite statement, have either quasi-inscriptions-i.e. indiscriminate combinations of letters from the Venetic alphabet (often very badly engraved) which do not form words (such are Figs. 4, 12)-or linear (e.g. Fig. 10) or dotted ornament (Fig. 11), or single alphabetic signs repeated a number of times along the flat sides of the pin (e.g. Figs. 3, 7, 8,. see further below). The appearance of small double circles as part of the system of ornamentation (Fig. 5) is extremely rare, but noteworthy and important enough for us 'to return later to consider the significance of these tiny circles. In more typical examples we find the dedicatory inscription occupying one or more sides, the remainder being filled in with alphabetic signs or some characteristic ornamentation (e.g. herring-bone, Pauli 242, or zig-zags3) thus (Pauli 24,, Conway 271): 2 mexo ahu * Xiia5 zona * s *to rehtiiah (me Fugia donauit Rectice ) that is, "Fugia gave me6 to Rehtia"; and (Pauli 21,7 Conway 31). 1, 2 mexo zona * s to s'ah I natek rehtiiah ( me donauit sanatrwic Rectice 2, 3 porah J e * Xetor e * r * iimoh keloo optima3 I Egetor Eremi . . . . 4 * u * zero c oo s ttttttttt (ex) uberibus ) that is, "Egetor, son of Eremus . . . , gave me to Rehtia, the great Goddess of Healing (lit., 'the Goddess Healing') from the first-fruits."

But it is perhaps worth observing that, since the name - e * X e t o r may be abbreviated),- it is at least as likely that a feminine as a masculine termination was intended. Again, taking a specimen that has only alphabetic signs (Pauli 42, fig. 8 above), we find X (t) repeated twelve times on one side (followed by two vertical strokes), and three other letters in the three other lines, namely, q (e), : (v), and \ (z) (again followed by two vertical strokes, in the second line by three). In this class, which we may call alphabetic, by far the most frequent letter is X (t)2; it also occurs frequently on some of the specimens with genuine inscriptions (as we have seen), and (in combination with other letters) on the alphabetic tablets. 'Its significance in connection with the worship of Rehtia will be further considered later. The other letters which appear on this specimen are the three which occur most frequently next to X (t) itself.3 3. As to chronology, it should be pointed out that the votive oflerings to Rehtia are probably all to be assigned to the third and fourth periods at Este-that is, they fall, roughly, between 600 and 200 B.C.; the pins themselves belong perhaps less to the third period than to the fourth, in which Keltic or La Tene objects are beginning to appear. The cult of Rehtia then seems to have been at its greatest height of popularity in the third century s.C. For be it observed that the remains at Este4 of the Early Iron Age fall into three periods, of which the first corresponds roughly to the first and second of the older Villanova periods (known as Benacci I and Benacci II), the second to the third Villanova period (Arnoaldi), and the third to the later Villanova (or Certosa) period. Although the general correspondence of these periods and their chronological sequence are clear, and accepted by archaologists, it must not be assumed that they coincide.exactly in date with the Villanova periods; exact dates indeed are still difficult to determine and much disputed. According to Hoernes5 the first period at Este begins somewhat later than the first Benacci and ends somewhat earlier than the second Benacci period, the second Este period is on the whole half a' century earlier than the Arnoaldi period, and the third Este period begins earlier than the Certosa period, but both come to an end about the same time, the Villanova civilization being interrupted by the Gallic invasion of North Italy in the fifth and subsequent centuries B.C.

WHATMOUGI.E-Rehtia, the Venetic Goddess of Healing. It is certain then that the people of Este, in common with the other Veneti, had passed through the whole of the Early Iron Age, Hallstatt or Villanova civilization, as it is variously known, from its beginnings in Italy down to the coming of the Gauls. 4. To return to Rehtia. A suggestion had previously been made' that the peculiar votive objects which we have been examining " represent nails and wedges attributed, as we know from Horace, to the Etruscan Goddess of Fate or Fortune, known to the Romans as Nortia "-that is, that the Venetic goddess would appear to have, at least in part, the same functions as Nortia, who used nails and wedges to build up and pull down at her will. " It is commonly supposed that they were the symbols of her power as a master-builder of the fabric of men's lives." " Horace's stanza,"2 continues Professor Conway, " certainly suggests that he took his description from some well-known statue." This perhaps is not quite so certain as Professor Conway thinks; but be that as it may, we shall, I venture to think, find better grounds for a comparison of Rehtia with Juno as Lucina, Februa and Fluonia than with Nortia (or Necessitas), although, at first sight, Dr. Giles' suggestion seems attractive and is not to be rejected without consideration. But Nortia was essentially a goddess of Fortune in a way in which Rehtia, so far as we can judge, was not; and Rehtia was essentially a goddess of Healing, whereas Nortia, was only secondarily represented in this capacity. The comparison of Rehtia and Nortia rests on the interpretation of these votive objects as " nails " and " wedges," which is not perhaps an untrue description, but I think is misleading none the less because not sufficiently precise. The so-called "wedges " are strangely out of proportion to the size of the " nails "; and why fasten " wedges " to " nails " with chains or rings ? Again, it must be asked, is not Horace (who, we must not forget, is describing not Nortia directly but Necessitas, and probably 1 By Dr. P. Giles, and accepted by Conway, see Journ. Roy. Anthrop. Inst., vol. xlvi (N.S. xix), 1916, p. 225; the above quotations are taken from this article. But I now find (May, 1921) that this suggestion was anticipated by Ghirardini, Notizie deqli Scavi, 1888, pp. 319 sq., who not only refers to the passage in Horace (carm. i, 35, 17 sqq.: te semper anteit sceua Necessitas,/ c I a u o s trabales et c u n e o s manu / gestans cena, nec seuerus / uncus ab est liquidumque plumbum: cf. also id., carm., iii, 24, 6 sq., iii, 1, 14 sq., i, 3, 32 sq.) to show the connection of nails with Necessitas (i.e. with Nortia, as generally interpreted), but also quotes Liv. vii, 3, 3, ix, 28, 6- add 34, 12 (J.W.)-Plin. N.H. xxviii, 4, 11 (46), 6, 17 (63) as evidence for the magical potency of nails and nail-driving. He concludes that the objects dedicated to Rehtia were nails serving some similar magical purpose (e.g. to obtain deliverance from plague). But Ghirardini did not, press the comparison in respect of the small pendant objects. He observed the similarity of these so-called " wedges " to the well-known objects found in Early Iron Age deposits over a wide area, and which are to be considered more fully below. He did not, however, perceive the full meaning and importance of this comparison (which I am bound to add had occurred to me independently in November, 1920, before I had read Ghirardini's account), and accordingly he contented himself with pointing out the similarity and pursued the comparison no further; clauum figere (q'xcp Ulv) in connection with defixiones or dirce (" spells," " curses" KaTaW86E0'/OL) is clearly a case of sympathetic magic (cf. Roberts and Gardner, Greek Epigraphy, ii, p. 531). 2 Quoted in the footnote above.</page><page sequence="6">J. WEATMOUGH.-Rehtia, the Venetic Goddess of Healing. 217 thinking of the Greek personification of 'A vayicn) drawing partly upon his imagination? Nortia's nails had one use, and one only, according to Livy,'L who quotes a lex uetusta, priscis litteris uerbisque scriptca, and the historian L. Cincius Alimentus2 as his ultimate authorities for the Roman and Etruscan customs respectively-a nail was driven annually into the wall of the shrine of Minerva in the Capitoline temple at Rome, on the Ides of September, and also into the wall of the temple of Nortia at Volsinii, on what date we are not told. This is a very different story from Horace's account of the significant use to which Necessitas put her nails.3 Livy gives the common-sense interpretation4 that these nails were driven at fixed intervals primarily to mark the passage of time. From this it is a short and easy step to the idea of the approach of doom-good or ill-brought to each and all by the inexorable Goddess of Fortune who advances as slowly but as surely as time itself, neither hastening nor delaying, certain of securing her victim in the end. The more fanciful inter- pretation of the nails given by Horace, who is primarily concerned to describe Necessitas, may possibly have been derived from the current view of his day, and this in turn may have been a genuine development of the idea of Nortia; on the other hand, it may equally well be nothing more than poetical elaboration. Besides nails we do not know for certain that the uncus (hook (or clamp)) was an attribute of Nortia,5 still less wedges (for Horace is a doubtful authority for this); and the molten lead, liquidumque plumbum, savours perhaps more of poetic fancy than of an actual statue of the goddess. Here Rehtia, so far as we know, offers no comparison at all. It may indeed be doubted whether Horace's description is trustworthy evidence for the attributes even of Necessitas; if we may venture to accept the identification6 of an ancient statue, the whereabouts of which are no longer known, 1 vii, 3, 5 sqq. 2 Floruit 210 B.C. 3 Carm. iii, 24, 5 sqq., si figit adamantinos / summis uerticibus dira Necessitas / c 1 a u o s, where by uerticibus is most probably meant " house-top," not " head, skull " (see the context). 4 I have more to say about Nortia in an essay on Minerva, which I hope to publish later elsewhere. 5 Perhaps Juv., Sat., x, 66, 74, beside Hor., carm., i, 35, 20, suggests that it was; but the inference is by no means certain. And most editors favour the interpretation of uncus in Hor. as " clamp," not " (executioner's) hook." 6 By Smith; see the cut in his Diet. of Antiqu.. ed. 3, art. Clauus i, p. 453, from Causeus (La Chausse), Romanum Museum, ed. 3 (1746), tom. i, sect. ii, p. 72, pl. 28, where, however, it is described as a statue of Fortuna " apud I. P. Bellorium." The cornucopice of course is a constant attribute of Fortuna. Mr. A. B. Cook, whom I consulted, is inclined to think that the statue is probably genuine, but does not feel convinced that it is a representation of Necessitas. The nail seems fairly certain, although Montfaucon, Antiquity Explained (1721), vol. i, bk. ii, p. 195, took it for the handle (clauus) of the rudder (gubernaculum), which Fortune is often represented as holding in her right hand, and a doubt occurs to me whether La Chausse (who in this point of detail is followed by Smith) did not misunderstand clauus as " nail " in some written or printed account of the statue, in which the words have been used really to mean " handle of the rudder." But in La Chausse's cut the object much more resembles a clauus trabalis than a tiller; it has the large, flat head of a nail and is only very slightly curved. Q 2</page><page sequence="7">218 J. WHATMOUGH.-Rehtia, the Venetic Goddess of Healing. as a figure of Necessitas, we have at least one representation of the goddess holding a nail (in her right hand), but no other one of the implements enumerated by Horace. Instead she carries (in her left hand) such an instrument of beneficence as the horn of plenty, cornucopice, which presumably indicates her power to bring fair as well as hard fortune, prosperity as well as adversity, according as a man's lot was preordained. If then Horace's account of Necessitas and her equipment is in itself too poetic to be taken as archaeological evidence, still less is it possible to accept it as a statement of the attributes of Nortia, whose nail (and this is the sole point on which the comparison of Necessitas and Nortia rests) originally served a different purpose. Thus the further comparison of Rehtia and Nortia, in virtue of Rehtia's " nails " and supposed " wedges," must, if we wish to proceed upon definite archaeological evidence, be limited to the nails, and is seen to be, if not entirely mistaken, based upon a foundation which is far from certain. 5. The explanation which I venture now to submit is that these offeri?gs to Rehtia are really a specialized votive type of hairpin with pendant axe-form amulets. Let it be observed at the outset that this statement does not imply that these very objects now preserved in the museum at Este were ever actually used as hairpins; it is at once apparent from the illustrations that many of them, though not too long to be used to fasten a top-knot, are rather heavy and clumsy to have been exactly desirable and comfortable in use even for this limited purpose.' Still they are not vastly different in general appearance from certain types of ancient hairpins,2 which were often very large and cumbrous, considering their use. A length of 9 inches (22-9 cm.) is by no means unknown; and frequently they are somewhat thick and heavy, sometimes four-sided like our Venetic specimens. One of our examples, it has already been noted,3 is of a rounded, stiletto type, except in the inscribed portion, and bears a more distinct resemblance to the ordinary ancient pin used for the hair. There is no real difficulty in regarding these objects from the temple of Rehtia as pins. If stress were laid on their size and comparative heaviness, there would be the easy and obvious explanation to hand that they are specifically ex voto, made as offerings to the goddess and never meant fQr actual use.4 There was no necessity for votive offerings to conform, and in fact ancient votive offerings rarely did conform, to the actual size of the originals from which they were copied or 1 Professor Conway reminds me that the technical and artistic skill of an early and possibly primitive people to produce pins in bronze which would pierce a heavy coil of hair may easily be over-estimated. Already in the Bronze Age, however, fine, pointed pins could be made which were also strong enough for all ordinary purposes such as fastening garments. 2 See the articles acus in Smith Dict. of Antiqu., Daremberg et Saglio; and Baumeister's Denkmaler s.v. Nadeln. 3 p. 213 supr. 4 When this paper was read before Section H of the British Association, Miss Margaret Murray pointed out that the elaborate hair-dressing in vogue amongst the women of early Mediterranean peoples would necessitate long strong hair-pins.</page><page sequence="8">J.

Diminutive statuettes will occur to everyone's mind, or another example can be found in the magical and votive axes of which something is to be said presently ; miniature ritual vases have appeared in the terre mare and in some of the western lake-dwellings.' On the other hand, votive objects are sometimes larger than the natural size ;2 excluding instances such as, the prehistoric megaliths, the gigantic votive craters of Greek temples or the colossal statuary of the Hellenistic period-which are scarcely to the point-there are the unusually large fibulke larger than practical need could require, or the models of various limbs of the body made on an exaggerated scale and offered to healing divinities. In short it is abundantly clear that no imperative CL 'SC 3 A T: 4 *. 0S S9 6 ~~~~~7 II.-AXE-SHAPED TALISMANS OF EARLY IRON AGE. necessity was generally recognized by the ancients to make votive offerings of precisely identical size or proportions with the actual objects which they represented. Accordingly, once the pin had become established as a type of votive offering to Rehtia (as we shall shortly see it might well be, and as it often was elsewhere to other deities which shared a particular function), such pins would consistently be made in the thick and heavy style for this particular purpose; for there was also a special reason for this large scale in the need for a size of sufficient breadth to hold a dedicatory inscription. It is entirely justifiable therefore to discard Ghirardini's I Peet, Stone and Bronze Ages in Italy, p. 358. 2 See some remarks by A. B. Cook in Folklore, xiv, 1903, pp. 270 sq.</page><page sequence="9">220 J. WHATMOUG:H.-Rehtia, the Venetic Goddess of Healing. description of these Venetic objects as " nails," and instead to describe them as pins.3 6. In the axe-shaped talismans or amulets which have been found in great abundance in Early Iron Age deposits distributed over the whole of Europe wherever the Hallstatt culture was carried, there is a complete and entirely satisfactory parallel-which, so far as I am aware, has not yet been explored-to the small pendant objects, previously regarded as " wedges " but left without convincing explanation. These amulets retain to a large extent the simple axe-form from which they were developed (Fig. 4)2 and which is still preserved entire in the scores of miniature axes discovered in Italy, Greece, Crete and Asia Minor, as well as in Central Europe. With these miniature axes3 we are not here immediately concerned, except to notice that they were employed for votive purposes; but the axe-form amulets demand further consideration. Their close relation to the simple axe-shape is at once clear from the illustrations (Figs. 1-7), in spite of the variations which on the one hand result in mere trapezoidal or triangular plates of metal, on the other in anthropo- morphic designs. The projecting ears or lugs of the diminutive pendant axe were suggestive of human arms, and the narrow end of the celt, where it is attached to the haft, of a human head. The addition of a ring by which to suspend the talisman from some article of apparel produces an advanced type, such as the one from Tribano, near Padua (Fig. 7).4 Sometimes the lugs are replaced by a pair of duck or swan heads, a favourite Hallstatt motif, and occasionally these appear in addition to the lugs (e.g. Fig. 6).5 In size there is considerable variation, the smallest (e.g. the two smaller pendants in Fig. 5)6 being about 2 cm. long, that is approximately the The type with the single hole (e.g. N. d. Sc., 1888, Tav. iv, Fig. 1), it may be noted, is very similar to a common type of ancient hairpin; see the authorities eited in the footnote on p. 218. On the other hand, ancient nails regularly have large, heavy, circular heads with flat tops-and (R. S. C.) at right angles to the shaft. 2 Found at St. Michael (Carniola), Hoernes, Urgeschichte, ed. 1, Taf. x, Fig. 20. 3 For both miniature axes and axe-form talismans, see especially the section on The Decoration of the Double Axe in the forthcoming second volume of Mr. A. B. Cook's Zeus (where full reference to previous works will be found; see in particular von Sacken, Das Grabfeld von Hallstatt, 1868, Taf. xii-xiv), Hoernes, op. cit., pp. 440 sqq., Schlem Worterbuch zur Vorgeschichte, pp. 7 sqq., Ridgeway Early Age of Greece, vol. 1, pp. 419 sq., 438, 442 sq. It is not unreasonable to suppose that originally these miniature axes were used as currency: " such pieces naturally would be buried with the dead or dedicated at shrines " (Ridgeway, op. cit., p. 442). See Ridgeway, Origin of Currency, pp. 318, 40, 50. We might even extend this supposition to the Venetic pins themselves (cf. Gk. '3oXBo' "pin, spike," and hence "obol, coin," id., ibid., pp. 310, 345 sq., 349). But the use of miniature axes as votive offetings, together with sundry developments and additions described in the text, gave them a secondary talismanic character which persisted after other more convenient forms of currency had been devised; and this talismanic character is what we are chiefly concerned with here. In the same way, the pins too would no longer be regarded as currency. 4 From Hoernes, Urgesch., ed. 1, Tai. x, Fig. 26. 5 Found near Este; from Hoernes, ibid., Fig. 7. 6 Found at San Briccio di Lavagno (about 51 miles E. of Verona); from Hoernes, ibid., Fig. 24.</page><page sequence="10">J.

Frequently, indeed almost invariably, they are fastened together either in couples, for example, to the metal attachments of a priestly or regal staff (Fig. 1),' and to various ornamients or articles of clothing (see more fully below), or else in series and rows so that they would produce a jingling noise as the wearer moved about (e.g. Fig. 2 a-c). 2 At Este they were fastened to the pins in pairs or fours.3 The object of this arrangement was no doubt to increase the magical potency of the axe-shaped talisman. A jingling sound-to which Juvenal4 (referring, be it noted, to the moon " in labour," that is, eclipsed) satirically likens a shrewish tongue in eflect-was supposed to be particularly efficacious in averting evil or at any crisis.5 There were other developments of the talismans which seem to have had the same purpose-the favourite duck or swan head, or the characteristic geometric ornament with the symbolic cross (e.g. Fig. 7, and less distinctly Fig. 2 a), and the small concentric circles, which are generally explained as the prophylactic eye reduced to a conventional form (see especially Figs. 36 and 7), though it must be left to others to say whether such was indeed the origin of this undoubtedly magical symbol. Or instead of the amulet being made in quasi-human form, a rude human figure is roughly sketched upon it to increase its talismanic power, as in an example from Este7) with a male figure and another from Romagna8 with a female figure. The cross, which, as a comparison with the representation of axes on Roman coins (Fig. 1)9 strongly suggests, may have been developed from the lines of the thong by which the celt was secured to the handle, apparently came to be regarded in the anthropo- morphic amulets, at least when these took, as they more frequently did, a female form, as breast-bands.

If we may accept Hoernes' view of this cross as possessing some magical value,, it is tempting to interpret in the same way the repeated X2 on the pins and on the alphabetic tablets offered to Rehtia, and also on certain small bronze plates found in the same excavations.3 We remember that on one pin, instead of the usual X, we found the prophylactic circles ;4 and on a miniature axe found at Hallstatt we oe 093 4,4 III.-THE BREAST-BAND ON ANTHROPOMORPHIC AMULETS. find both cross and tiny concentric circles combined.5 We shall see that there are special reasons for associating the breast-band, which the cross on the Tribano 1 op. cit., pp. 335 sqq. 2 Compare for general appearance the repeated cross-band on the statue of Zeus Labrondos as represented on a coin of Mylasa; see A.

Fastened by rings or chains, and sometimes in very complicated and elaborate groupings, the axe-form talismans were attached to various articles of wearing apparel and adornments, especially to fibule,2 girdles,3 to a peculiar kind of ornament for the head,4 to necklaces,5 bracelets (see Fig.),6 ear-rings, and so on; and sometimes to horse harness, which is important because it shows that the people of Este used these talismans in connection with their favourite pursuit, which they shared with the Henetoi of Paphlagonia, namely horse-racing. On the analogy of all these usages, we should conclude that our specimens from Este are really axe-form talismans attached to some article meant for personal use or adornment rather than to building IV.-BRACELET (WITH PENDANT AXE-SHAPED TALISMANS) FROM ESTE (N. D. sc., 1882, TAV. IV., FIG. 34). materials, in short to pins rather than to nails. The very object which the pair of talismans was meant to achieve, that is, to ward off evil by their jingling sound as the wearer of them moved about, would be defeated if they were suspended from a nail, of which the proper use is to be driven home hard and fast. But suspended from a hairpin that secures a lady's hair, at every move of her head they would fulfil that purpose.

Hera, and inscribed in archaic alphabet Tracr"Hpacl; and from the analogy of inscribed mirrors, fibulae and cistce (" jewel-boxes "), it would not be unreasonable to argue that all such articles of female toilet might also carry inscriptions. Although we need not imagine that the talismans of the form fastened to the Este pins were still thought of as " axes," it may be pointed out that there is substantial evidence for the use of an axe-head as part of the decoration of the heads of hairpins; for example, we may note a gold hairpin from the necropolis of Koban (S. Russia),2 or the electrum pin-heads decorated with tiny double-axes from the Artemisium at Ephesus.3 There is no reason therefore to hesitate in identifying the objects found in the excavations of the temple of Rehtia at Este as hairpins with pendant axe-form amulets. 8. In his paper, six years ago, Professor Conway4 discussed fully the close parallelism of Rehtia and the Spartan goddess Artemis Orthia, not only in name but also in characteristic votive offerings, and now, I think we may add; in functions also. It is not necessary to repeat here the evidence which was then submiitted in detail; but one or two points may be recalled, and, with some additional ones, further emphasized. An important fact connected with the pins dedicated to Rehtia must be carefully noted. Out of the 200 odd extant bronze specimens only nineteen contain an articulate inscription, and of these two were dedicated by the same person; we are left therefore with eighteen worshippers, of whom only one is almost certainly a man (or at most two).5 Clearly this type of offering was made all but exclusively by women. Now large numbers of bronze pins have been found in shrines of Artemis Orthia, both at Sparta and elsewhere, though in no case do they show the same remarkable features-the rectilinear ornament and the axe-form amulets fastened by means of rings and chains-which specially distinguish the pins of Este. The Greek specimens are usually round, somewhat shorter, and have heavy, lumpy heads. This, however, is a small difference; we have already seen that votive offerings, for any special reason-in this case in order to provide space for the dedicatory inscription-may depart from the usual style, and be developed into a specialized votive type. In Greece, pins, both hairpins and pins used for garments, were a favourite form of votive offering made by women to their special divinities at the time of childbirth.6 Herodotus7 tells us that women of Argos and AZgina were in the habit of dedicating pins (7m)opvac), presumably to Hera and Aphaia 1 F.

WHATMOUGH.-Rehtia, the Venetic Goddess of Healing. 225 respectively, both of them protecting deities of women in labour. From the shrine of Artemis Hemera (" the Gentle ") at Lousoi in Arcadia, where her cult was a flourishing one in the sixth century B.C., comes a great variety of women's ornaments including pins, ear-rings, fibulae and diadems.1 The inscribed silver pin dedicated to Hera, now in the British Museum, has already been noted ;2 another one in gold dedicated to Aphrodite was found at Cyprus.3 From the Argive Herceum and from the temples of the gods of Healing, Asklepios and Apollo, at Delos come fibula,, pins, rings, bracelets, nec-klets, ear-rings, head-bands and the like in abundance.4 Similar offerings and also hair-nets, girdles, and breast-bands, accompanied by a prayer for safe delivery addressed to Hera, Artemis or Eileithuia, are recorded in the poems of the Anthologia Palatina.5 The offering of pins and other articles of personal use by women is a close, but not quite perfect, analogy to that of his arms by the veteran, of his net by the fisherman, of his flute by the shepherd, and of his lyre by the poet. Since it was so common for women to offer pins to various goddesses in Greece, it is a safe inference to conclude that the objects found at Este, chiefly dedicated by women, are also pins-of a specialized votive type. 9. Now Orthia is expressly described as the " Restorer," or as a healing deity who restored " women to health after childbirth and preserved their infants," and as such she was at Epidauros associated with Asklepios Orthios.6 It is interesting, too, to compare Orthia Lygodesma7 " the willow-bound " at Sparta, since the willow was supposed to possess special properties connected with women's ailments. But Rehtia, we remember, is called SA a h n a t e h (dat. sg.)8 " the Healing (One) "; and on the alphabetic tablets the word a k e o, apparently cognate with Greek aa'opal, "cure, heal," is repeated, in the complete specimens, sixteen times.9 In view of the 1 Jahreshefte d. ost. arch.

" (ex) operibus " may perhaps be " after the toils of labour," i.e. as if in Latin opus in the sense of opera (f. sg.), which is commonly used by Latin authors in the same sentence or phrase as labor and is almost synonymous with that word. For the plu., cf. in Gk. o81&amp;veaicr, Pind. fr. 88 (Bergk.). In any case both words denote the occasion of the offering.</page><page sequence="15">226 J. WHATMOUGH.-Rehtia, the Venetic Goddess of Healing. apt parallel in name and other respects between Orthia and Rehtia, it is likely that the healing functions of the two were also the same, that is, that they were both, Rehtia as well as Orthia, goddesses of motherhood and childbirth. But we can find other evidence pointing to the same conclusion. We know that it was the custom at Rome for women during pregnancy or in labour to loosen all knots and fastenings about their clothing or hair when paying their vows to or supplicating the help of Juno-especially under the name Lucina ;1 the very numerous examples of this or similar requirements during pregnancy and confinement, collected by Sir James Frazer2 from different peoples all over the world, show that this condition, which no doubt originated from ordinary clinical reasons, came to be thought necessary to secure the safe and easy birth of the child-a knot or fastening anywhere, it was thought, would complicate matters. Juno again, as Cinxia, was the presiding deity of the bride's girdle,3 which was tied in the nodus herculaneus,4 and might well therefore require the aid of the goddess to unfasten it. But since women had to unloosen their hair and dress when addressing their prayers to their protecting goddess, it would surely be appropriate for them to offer their dress- or hair-pins (or votive objects imitated from these) to the local goddess of motherhood and childbirth on such occasion. If, and in so far as the view taken in this paper of the Este offerings as pins and talismans of a common Hallstatt type is correct-and the archaeological evidence goes to show that these dedications are prima facie to be assigned to the close of the Hallstatt period and the beginning of the Keltic or La Tene period at Este-then the offerings would imply a magical purpose, to safeguard, no doubt, both mother and unborn child during the period of gestation, and to secure the well-being of both after the confinement. It is tempting to see further in the cross (X), which we have repeatedly seen was the favourite symbol of Rehtia, a recollection of the breast-band which, it has already been shown, might be a suitable offering to Rehtia, and would be unfastened on occasions when women paid their vows to her. In the case of Orthia Lygodesma and of Hera at Samos the breast- band was perhaps associated with the osiers which were bound round the statue to keep it in position. If the view is right which regards the cross on prehistoric monuments as a magical symbol, it would appear that in course of time the breast- band, which, on the Tribano figure at least, seems to have been developed from the lines of the thong used to bind axe-head to the handle, had passed into a conventional magical symbol and was readapted to suit the pin. This would be in keeping with the prophylactic circles on one of the Este pins and with the axe-form talismans 1 Serv. Verg., Aen., iv, 518, Ovid fasti iii, 257 sqq.; cf. Paul. ex.

WHATMOUGH.-Rehtia, the Venetic Goddess of Healing. 227 fastened originally to most if not to all of them. Let us pursue a little further the comparison of Rehtia and Juno: with s a h n a t e h and a k e o we can obviously compare such epithets as Lucina, the goddess of motherhood (literally, " the bringer of the light of day," that is, to the newly-born child), Februa and Fluonia " tlie purifier " and Sospes " the preserver." All these epithets, as I hope to show elsewhere, are connected with the functions of Juno as the great Italic goddess of motherhood and childbirth. It would be a simple step in the development of Rehtia, as it was of Juno, to become a saving goddess of both sexes and of all classes; at Rome special sacrifices were offered to Juno at times of national distress, in order to gain respite for the whole community from its difficulties present or indicated as imminent by dread portents.' One at least of Rehtia's chief functions, then, is to maintain or to restore physical health-the soundness, fitness, rightness of the body; she raises it to an upright position after sickness and pain. 10. Now there was a temple in the country of the Veneti, not far from Patavium (Padua), ascribed to Juno, and said by Livy2 to have been ancient already in 302 B.C. -the year in which the event he is there relating took place-that is to say, eighty- four years before the planting of the colonies of Placentia and Cremona, which may be taken to mark the beginning of the :Romanization of Transpadane Gaul. From Vergil3 we learn of a cult of Juno in the same district, and it may be that the poet is actually referring to the same cult as Livy; according to Strabo4 this cult amongst the Veneti was Greek-a (temple and) grove of the Argive Hera. But, as in the very similar case of Falerii,5 there is a tradition of " Pelasgians " landing in Italy in this region, who were said to have come from Epirus after having been expelled from Thessaly.6 In neither Epirus nor Thessaly, however, so far as I can find, is there any trace of an ancient cult of Hera to which reference could be made to explain Strabo's assertion respecting the nature of this cult amongst the Veneti. It is not, however, unreasonable to believe that these " Pelasgians," like the Veneti amongst whom they are said to have settled (and who not only are demonstrably a tribe closely akin to the ancient Illyrians, but also seem to have long preserved a matrilinear system of nomenclature7 as well as a peculiar marriage custom, both of which are regarded as connecting them with the early Mediterranean stratum of I Cf. especially the custom of instituting lectisternia (in honour of Juno, and sometimes of other gods and goddesses) at Rome at times of pestilence or famine.

WHATMOUGH.--Rehtia, the Venetic Goddess of Healing. population, and the marriage custom as characteristically Illyrian),' worshipped a goddess with functions similar to those of the Venetic Rehtia, the Italic Juno, the Spartan Orthia, and the Argive Hera; and that later observers like Livy (himself a native of Padua) or Strabo, familiar with both of the more famous Roman and Greek cults of Juno and Hera, noted the similarities between these and the Venetic cult, and therefore regarded them as essentially the same, if indeed we are not further to conclude that, with the extension of both Greek and Roman civilization by the times of these two historians, an actual identification had taken place of cults, which, perhaps, had more in common in their origins than we can now trace with precision. ADDENDUM. A visit made in March, 1922, to the Museo Nazionale at Este, where the objects found during the excavations carried out on the Fondo Baratela are now preserved, has enabled me to reconsider the theory of the so-called " nails "2 which I had advanced in the paper here printed. (In passing let me say that my reading of the two inscrip- tions quoted on p. 214 above-amongst others-fully confirms Professor Conway's text which is given there.) No one, I think, who has examined the Baratela collection as a whole will hesitate to conclude that we have to deal with a specialized votive type of pin. There is a whole case full of pins from the same site which are labelled pins (spilli), and many others in the same case as the larger and heavier objects labelled chiodi, which, if taken alone, Would undoubtedly be called pins (e.g.-I quote the numbers attached to them in the museum catalogue-Nos. 9291, 9428, 9441, 9508, 9510-13, 9516, 9518), so that although the first sight of the large thick bronze specimens, and even more so of the iron ones, rnight easily lead the observer to classify them as " nails," we must allow the possibility (as I think, probability) that they are really a special type of pin made for votive purposes. I observed a number of pins, almost as thick, though shorter, in the Etruscan Museum of the University of Perugia. But the nails of Nortia on the other hand, to be seen in the Museo Archeologico at Florence, are entirely different. They are square clati trabales, as Horace called them, a foot long and not less than an inch thick at the top, with huge flat heads. Even the most casual glance at these nails would deter an observer from comparing them with the Este pins (so-called " nails "), though it is only fair to add that this comparison, made by Dr.' Giles and accepted by Professor Conway, was not based by them on an actual examination of either set of objects. 1 By Professor Sir Wm. Ridgeway, Who were the Dorians ? (1907), p. 298 (in Ant7hrop. Essays pres. to E. B. Tylor, Oxford, 1907). 2 I may mention here a recent discussion of these objects by Bellucci I Chiodi nell' Etnografia antica e contemporanea (Perugia, 1919), p. 60, where the old view is restated, but no fresh light thrown on the cult of Rehtia. The Este objects, however, are quite unlike the (undoubted) nails from other localities with which Bellucci seeks to compare them.</page><page sequence="18">J. WHATMOUGH.-Rehtia, the Venetic Goddess of Healing. 229 I noticed further that besides many scores of pins (the spilli referred to above), rings, bracelets and fibulae also have been found in considerable quantity on the Baratela site, just as at Lousoi (shrine of Artemis Hemera), at Argos (the Heraeum) and at Delos (temples of Asklepios and of Apollo), so that the suggestion made on p. 225 above is in some degree strengthened. As for the small pendants attached to the pins, the large numbers of precisely similar objects which I noted both at Este and elsewhere (in particular at Florence and Bologna) attached to bracelets, necklaces, ear-rings, or arranged in rows or series, leave no doubt at all in my mind that my identification of the Este specimens as talismans is correct. A number of those which I saw at Bologna were made of bone.' I am indebted to the Rev. Canon Lonsdale Ragg, Warden of the Church Hostel, Bangor, for a reference to F. C. Hodgson's Early History of Venice (London, 1901), pp. 113 sqq., where the strange medieval ceremony of the " Brides of St. Mark's " is fully described, together with an account of the legend on which it was supposed to be based. I am inclined to believe that in this ceremony there may perhaps be a survival of the marriage custom of the ancient Veneti described by Herodotus (see above). The second class of votive offerings made to Rehtia-the alphabetic tablets-- still awaits explanation; the riddle of Rehtia's cult will not have been completely read until there is a solution forthcoming which will cover both the tablets and the pins and talismans. 1 Schlemm Wdrterbuch, p. 7, mentions only bronze, iron and tin as the usual materials.</page></plain_text>
