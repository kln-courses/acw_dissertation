<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reviews: General discarded by the new state-makers? More broadly, what common experiences did the Turkish republic share with the other (my stress) successor states and in which ways was the Turkish experience unique among those states? How did the Turkish experience differ from those in Bulgaria, Syria, Serbia and Iraq? To be sure, the experiences of each state were particular but the Ottoman legacy is present in all of them. By totally ignoring the other successor states and by focusing so closely on Turkey, Ziircher is complicit in, certainly unwillingly, the trivialization of the Ottoman past. BINGHAMTON UNIVERSITY DONALD QUATAERT THE SEED AND THE SOIL: GENDER AND COSMOLOGY IN TURKISH VILLAGE SOCIETY. By CAROL DELANEY. (Comparative Studies on Muslim Societies, 11.) Berkeley, University of California Press, 1991. xiii, 360pp. Illustrations. Photographs. Index. This ethnographic account is based on fieldwork conducted in a Sunni mountain village on the central Anatolian plateau, with a population of about 850 people. Although the village is a few hours from Ankara its isolation does not permit commuting or short-term labour migration. The fieldwork took place between September 1980 and July 1982, during the military government, when discussing politics in the village was not possible. It is not the political milieu, however, which gives a 'timeless quality to the book' (as the author suggests) but the subject matter itself, the theoretical argument and probably also the author's approach to anthropology and fieldwork. Delaney addresses two questions: 'why in the three monotheistic religions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) is God explicitly or implicitly symbolized as masculine?' and 'why is reproduction so devalued in our society?' (p.5). Integrating the answers to both questions, she argues that -a "monogenetic" theory of procreation is correlative with the theological doctrine of monotheism. Both are concerned with genesis, albeit at different levels; the principle of creation at both levels comes only from one source, and that is symbolically masculine' (p.3). The book is organized in five chapters. In chapter one, Delaney explores the meanings of male and female bodies as they relate to the theory of procreation ('it is men who give life: women merely give birth', p.27), and discusses the "seed' and 'field' (tohum ve tarla) metaphors, symbolizing men and women respectively, and places them in a cosmological framework. Chapter two describes marriage practices and wedding rituals, which provide symbolic representations of the 'seed and field' theory. There follows a comprehensive discussion of 'kinship' including both 'relatives' and -'relations' in a gendered environment. Here, a diagram of concentric cones, illustrating 'the structure of traditional authority relations', provides a visual representation of Delaney's thesis. The base of the cone, which is made up of concentric circles, symbolizes feminine space (from the innermost to the outermost: women, house, village, nation, and world); and the top of each cone symbolizes the masculine authority that corresponds to the respective circle (Husband, Eldest Male Head of Household, Muhtar, Head of State, and God). Discussions constituting the fourth chapter are at village level, ranging from development issues to local political history, and from the influence of the State on the village to the threatening changes at village level where women are 'associated with secularism and materialism, whether in the form of capitalism or Communism' (p.225). The final chapter, 'the embracing context of Islam', discusses the 192</page><page sequence="2">Reviews: General five 'pillars' of religion, other events associated with Islam, gender differences in practising Islam, and how Islam is a source of gendered symbols. Delaney attempts to deal with three complex problems: writing an ethnographic account at a time when readers are most sensitive to critical reflexivity: devising a theory of gender hierarchy; and understanding a complex world religion, Islam. Despite a beginning promising a questioning of methodology, epistemology and the fieldworker's own biases, and other possible reconstructions of the ethnographic 'reality' of 'Turkish village society', in the end Delaney manages to give a realistic account of what village society is and how it works. One important question which is not satisfactorily addressed is 'which Islam?' Delaney discards the possibility of diverse ways in Islam, as 'for the Muslims [she knows] and in much Islamic writing, Islam is One and to suggest otherwise is blasphemy' (p.19). But there are at least two reasons why diversity in Islam should not be ignored. First, at a theological level, there are Islamic interpretations which recognize 4unity in diversity' (Ckesrette vehdet'). Given its enormity, a restricted reading of Islamic literature is, of course, inevitable, but a selective reading, to support our arguments, is definitely misleading. Second, how do we interpret and analyse the multiple (sometimes contradictory and mutually exclusive) forms of belief and behaviour contained under the umbrella of Islam? It is ironical that, while Delaney explicitly states her sensitivity to accusations of blasphemy or 'cultural imperialism', some of her own writing may well be read as arrogant, if not blasphemous. To begin with, she does not hesitate to associate an anthropomorphic, male God with Islam. It is true that the Christian concept of "God the Father' fits beautifully with her argument, but how well does it go with Islam, where the concept of God is decidedly non-anthropomorphic? Do Muslims in general, or Delaney's villagers in particular, actually visualize God as "the old man in the sky'? Particularly in the case of 'Turkish Islam', in a religion which states that God is not in human form, in a language where gender is not grammatically marked-although the phrase "Allah Baba' [Father God] is used in many regions-we should not assume that God is unanimously perceived as male. Whilst there are gender inequalities and sexism in Turkish cultures and societies, Delaney's ethnographic evidence does not adequately support her particular arguments and she does not account for diversity or contradictions in everyday life. Nor am I convinced by some of her symbolic interpretations, which may be considered blasphemous by many believers: "Photographs brought back by villagers showed ["the black stone in the eastern corner of the Ka$ba'] to have a remarkable resemblance to vagina, complete with labial folds and a clitoris' (p.306). If this association is the product of Delaney's interpretation and no ethnographic evidence supports it (as she admits, "no doubt villagers, and Muslims in general, would be shocked by this association'), what is the point of ethnographic fieldwork? A serious weakness of the study stems from the simplistic translation of a number of Turkish phrases. A good command of local language is, of course, important in all ethnographic fieldwork, but in this sort of interpretation it is essential. By relying on a simple dictionary translation it is quite easy to misunderstand and misrepresent -ethnographic reality'. For example, giinah does not always mean 'sinful'; sometimes it is used as a synonym for yazik, indicating pity for waste: thus, excessive crying after the death of a loved one is not considered 'sinful' (p.314) but as "wasting' oneself. And whether dictionary meanings of ayet include 'sign', "wonder' or 'miracle' (p.29) has no relevance if the villagers do not use the word in that sense. This book can be recommended to critical readers who already have an adequate background in Turkish, Middle Eastern and Islamic societies, but not to the first time 'Western' reader who is hungry for "facts'. Whether or not one agrees with Delaney's 193</page><page sequence="3">Reviews: General arguments, symbolic associations, their implications, and how well they fit the Turkish case, there is no doubt that her book provides a number of rich ethnographic descriptions which may contribute to theoretical discussions outside the scope of her work. UNIVERSITY OF UTAH, EMINE ONARAN INCIRLIOGLU SALT LAKE CITY INDIA AND THE MIDDLE EAST. By PRITHVI RAM MUDIAM. London, British Academic Press, 1994. ix, 232pp. ?39.50. A modified version of a doctoral thesis submitted to the University of London, this book examines India's relations with the region between 1947 and 1986. It covers political, security and economic interests and 'focuses on the misperceptions and fallacies that governed India's interaction with the region' (p.viii). It takes the view that the 'constancy of India's Middle Eastern policy is more an outcome of lack of imagination and an absence of subtlety and sensitivity on the part of the Indian political elite than any unwavering commitment ... to high principles and ideals' (p.viii), and it asserts that India's policy in the future is untenable because of rapidly changing political and strategic circumstances in the Middle East. The primary sources were documents from the Indian government, the United Nations, and books published in India and Europe. Interviews were done in 1988 in New Delhi with prominent officials, and knowledgeable writers and journalists. Many secondary sources were used from India, Europe and the USA. India's relations with Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) are examined chronologically. India's security concerns and economic interests in the Middle East are given separate consideration. The author's theme is that Indian policy towards the Middle East has been too ideological and has paid insufficient attention to Indian national interests. It has had a 'fixation with Pakistan' (p.96) and the presumed ability of this country to form an Islamic bloc behind it. It has placed 'too much premium on anti-imperialist rhetoric, and on extending vociferous support to general Arab causes such as Palestine' (p.35). This has resulted in India not paying adequate attention to its own national interest and in cultivating bilateral ties with individual Middle Eastern states that would so serve it. The coolness of Indian relations with Iran, Saudi Arabia and Israel come in for criticism. Because of the obsession with Pakistan, relations with Iran, both under the Shah and the Islamic Republic, could have been better, and 'India must accept the larger part of the blame for this sorry state of affairs' (p.68). Despite a number of complementary interests, the Indian government 'failed to pursue with the required vigour and persistence the policy of bilaterally cultivating Iran ... ' (p.85). In regard to Saudi Arabia the Indian government lost an opportunity. No disputes existed between the two countries, but because of 'Nehru's endorsement of Nasser's leadership of the Arab world' (p.89), Saudi Arabia turned to Pakistan and developed extensive ties with this country which were 'based on concrete national interests ... and had little to do with religious affinity' (p.96). 'This betrayed a lack of deep and intelligent understanding of the politics of the Arab world' (p. 96). 'Israel has been one of the blind spots of India's foreign policy endeavours' (p.143), and Dr Mudiam is perturbed that no attempt has been undertaken by the foreign policy makers in New Delhi to reappraise policy towards this country. Israel is 'one of the 194</page></plain_text>
