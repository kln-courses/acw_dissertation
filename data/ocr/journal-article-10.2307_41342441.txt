<plain_text><page sequence="1">Liliane Atlan's The Messiahs As Cosmic Theatre Bettina Knapp The struggle must begin with one's soul - all else will follow upon this. Martin Buber, Good and Evil. Liliane Atlan's play The Messiahs was first published in 1969. A revised version was performed in Avignon in 1974. Although Mme Atlan's drama is a bitter denunciation of the Messiah myth, it is also the affirmation of a belief the author cannot shed - one which gives her hope, enables her to live out her earthly destiny and to experience her pain and guilt not as destructive forces, but rather as creative instruments. The Mes- siahs is moulded from Mme Atlan's very flesh. Its sub-title Earth-Sickness is indicative of the corrosive nature of the life experience she incizes into her play. So successful is she in ex- pressing her vision that Roger Blin, director of plays by Beckett and Genet among many others, believes Liliane Atlan to be one of the finest playwrights in France today. Born in Montpellier in 1932, Liliane Atlan grew up in a bourgeois milieu. Awareness of suffering and of the precarious nature of human life was brought home to her with the German occupation of France during World War П. She and her sister were kept hidden during most of the war. It was at this juncture that she discovered the theatre and her spiritual values. As she has said: We almost never went out. We had to entertain ourselves. My sister would dress up, would disguise herself. She was the audience. I was the stage: the actors, the author. . . . Everything lived within me: I screamed, gesticulated, died. I would speak out my lamentations, my dirges, my psalms. After the war nothing seemed possible. There was no way out for us. Man 248</page><page sequence="2">Bettina Knapp 249 and his gods had died in the concentration camp. I emerged from my sorrow perhaps by reflex action. One has to live, to bear the torture of life. We began to view the world with lucidity, realizing that all paths until now had led to an impasse. I decided, along with some of my Jewish friends, to search for an answer among the Hebrew texts - the Bible, the Midrash, the Cabala - to discover a way of life and a non-Christian way of thinking. My roots exist in these texts, whatever their limita- tions may be.l After the war, feelings of guilt at her inability to save any of the six million Jews destroyed in the concentration camps (though unfounded since she was too young at the time to alter the situation) cut into her psyche. She experienced, empatheti- cally, the cries of agony, the cutting pain of the dismemberment - both physical and psychological - of her people. She also observed the outside world, impervious to the wholesale slaugh- ter, always resorting to stock answers in order to justify their passive attitude. The ideals expressed all around her - "Peace on earth and goodwill to men" or "Love thy neighbor" were refrains that resounded in her ears like so many dull platitudes. Mme Atlan expressed her feelings of outrage and love for man and God in a poetic theatre, the power of which brands and sears. Mister Runaway ( Monsieur Fugue), performed in 1967 by the Comédie de St. Etienne and in the fall of that same year by the Théâtre National Populaire in Paris (as well as other European countries), dramatizes the fantasies of children as they are being led to the crematorium. Despite the excruciating nature of their situation, these children are not morbid. They live out the few hours remaining them in their fantasy world - with verve, humor, and irony. The Little Carriage of Flames and Voices (La Petite voiture de flammes et de voix, 1971), staged successfully in Avignon, takes audiences into the double world of a soul divided; of a woman split in two, attempting to find an answer to her torments through eroticism, drugs, knowledge, and revolt. Nothing heals her fragmented self. Still she searches for "the little carriage of flames and voices, the one that will give her peace of soul." The Emigrants, The Musicians (1974) takes place in Israel amid artists who try to confront what seem insur- mountable and terrifying problems. The latter play is scheduled for productions in France during the 1975-1976 seasons. Mme Atlan is also the author of volumes of poems, among them Hands-Cutters of Memory (1969) [Les Mains coupeuses de</page><page sequence="3">250 Comparative Drama mémories ] and Lapsus (1971). A stamp is ingrained in all of Mme Atlan's creative works - the feeling that "It's living that hurts." The Messiahs is a theatrical venture of cosmic proportions. It is the dramatization of a myth and thus "the secret opening through which inexhaustible energies of the cosmos pour into human cultural manifestation.'^ The play's action "is lost in the immensity of the cosmos." Ideally, the stage area should in- clude the entire theatre. It "should be fashioned," said Mme Atlan, "in such a way as to give the impression of performing within a type of celestial vault."3 Mme Atlan would like to see her play staged in a planetarium or in a theatre constructed along these lines. Because The Messiahs encompasses four spheres (that of God, of the Messiahs, the realm of the dramatist and her cortège, and the earthly globe), a universe comes to life. Galaxies and spheres of all sorts appear before the viewer as if suspended in space. The spectator's frame of reference thereby is expanded as he plunges into the pleromatic universe - not in the rigid hierarchical world of his ancestors, but rather in a new timeless and spaceless realm. Disoriented, unnerved, he experi- ences a vertigo of the soul. Mme Atlan speaks openly of the seminal forces influential in creating her own personal style of writing. A mystical affinity, for example, exists between her and Artaud: When I was reading The Theatre and its Double, I had the impression of seeing in writing what I was thinking, in an obscure way. Artaud's words sometimes frightened me because I was living them. I understood them in the deepest of ways . . . of levels . . . too painfully .4 Atlan's theatre is visceral, designed to jolt the spectator, to attack his senses. It is cruel, in the Artaudian way: I employ the word "cruelty" in the sense of appetite for life, a cosmic rigor, an implacable necessity, in the gnostic sense of a living whirlwind that devours the darkness, in the sense of that pain apart from whose ineluctable necessity life could not continue; good is desired, it is the consequence of an act; evil is permanent.^ The Messiahs seeks to destroy man's complacency, the pat answers inherited in toto from his ancestors and to which he adheres as an automaton in order to assuage his guilt and inflate his being with illusory hope. This makes it possible for him to</page><page sequence="4">Bettina Knapp 25 1 live with himself and to accept his own passivity when he allows events to dominate him. Atlan is also preoccupied with what Samuel Beckett labels "that double-headed monster of damnation and salvation - Time." Such a complexio oppositorium (cyclical as opposed to eschatological time) is, to continue with Beckett's words, an "agile monster of Divinity: Time - a condition of resurrection because an instrument of death. "6 The Messiahs, therefore, is a work embedded in history, in the event, in the moment, in the second - it is "time-ridden."7 It likewise transcends these limita- tions as its permutations diffuse into eternity. Atlan's problem thus passes from an individual plane to a collective or myth- ical realm. Like Genet's The Balcony, Atlan confronts two worlds, "the glorification of the image and the Reflection, "8 thereby bringing into focus a terrain as secure as quicksand, as stable as marshes, as predictable as volcanic eruptions. Like Genet's The Screens (scene 17), where the dead are pictured looking at the living, so Atlan features the Messiahs, figures inhabiting another sphere, but anthropomorphic in all ways. The conclusion is like Mon- taigne's - that man's imagination is too limited an instrument to be able even to conceive of divinity as something totally different from what we already know. Thus, all we can hope to create is a mirror image of what we know, philosophically, politically, and materialistically. The Messiah myth that predicts the universal rule of God on earth, and whose presence would establish peace and goodness among men, including their redemption, is fundamental to Judaism. The Hebrew word mashiah, "the annointed one," sig- nifies a person who holds a divine office (as a king, priest, or prophet) ; the Greek word Christ is a translation of the Hebrew noun.9 Such "annointed ones" have emerged throughout history whenever the political, economic, and spiritual lives of a people have reached their nadir, whenever man has longed to be de- livered from his own iniquities. Periods of "acute Messianism" occurred during the Babylonian captivity (586 B.C.), the reign of Herod (37-4 B.C.), the Great Revolt against Rome (Massada, 66-70 A.D.), and the Bar Kokba uprising (132-5 A.D.). 10 Jewish Messianic tradition labels such cataclysmic events as periods of transition, the expected terrors announced</page><page sequence="5">252 Comparative Drama to man prior to the Last Judgment In The Jewish War Josephus wrote of the many sects awaiting the Messiah who interpreted their dread lot on earth as tibe pain preceding his advent. Excori- ating mutilations perpetrated during the Crusades in Europe, in Asia Minor, and in the communities of the Diaspora, during the Spanish Inquisition, during the pogroms in Russia, and during the Hitler regime increased "Messianic Fever." Zionism is the outcome of Judaic Messianism - the spirit of hope in the future. 11 Atlan's attitude toward the Messianic question is ambivalent. Since she is a traditionalist, it poses nerve-searing problems for her, based on fact and fiction. It is a fact that great men inhabited the earth: Moses, Jesus, Buddha. But it is fiction to think that these men resolved our problems. Let us state here, moreover, that a vast difference exists between the Judaic and Christian notions of the Messiah. For the Jew the reign of the Messiah will take place in a real community, that is, in the eschatological world and during the last eons; for the Christian the Messiah has already redeemed man and he will reign in spiritual and unseen spheres, as in St. Augustine's civitas dei.12 The Messianic figure, psychologically speaking, may be looked upon as an archetype: a being chosen by God to carry out His will or an emanation of Himself. When chaos threatens on the conscious level, a compensatory factor is aroused in the unconscious. Then the stable archetype of the Messianic figure comes into focus. It symbolizes order, stability, and salvation. 13 It is no wonder that such an archetype was activated in Mme Atlan's unconscious. The Messiahs is designed to startle, to bruise, to anger, and to elevate to new mystical climes, to reveal hidden universal truths. The stage decors could take on the quality of eternity in that they could be a blend of medieval mansion sets, such as those used in Arnould Gréban's Passion or Andrieu de la Vigne's Mystère de Saint-Martin, coupled with modern mechanical tech- niques: radio, binoculars, mobile galaxies, stages, flares, etc. Such theatrical conventions would give the impression of spacial- ity, verticality, and integrality - also the feeling of floating in space. The four realms implicit in The Messiahs may be described as follows : 1. The invisible, inaccessible yet ever-present domain of the</page><page sequence="6">Bettina Knapp 253 deus àbsconditus - the God who reigns over the entire produc- tion yet remains elusive. His existence consists only in the im- pression of His presence. Therefore, no concrete production is introduced into the stage happenings. The audience experiences Him as a force only when the Inspector, carried by invisible angels, intrudes into the spectacle. 14 2. The domain of the Messiahs is the most important sphere in the play. It is here that most of the action takes place. It must, therefore, give the impression of being dimensionless, of being surrounded by mobile planets and galaxies, each hanging hazard- ously in mid-air, seemingly unattached yet fixed for eternity, dangling about and yet orbiting in a rigorously planned order. 3. The dramatist and her cortège make their entrance on this level. Like a group of flagellants in the Middle Ages, they spread about them an atmosphere of hopelessness, of sickness, of black- ness. A raft carrying the dead, or a "Ship of Death," moves aim- lessly about in the sphere, hoping to find asylum someplace, but never achieving the dream. The human wrecks, mutilated and tortured, singing their song of life, are like so many vapors issu- ing forth from some dank and rocky crag. 4. The earth is then focused upon. It is a globelike entity made up of countless bones rising up like a series of thickly knit skyscrapers. 15 Galaxies shoot through the scene, increasing the feelings of disorientation and vertigo. These astral bodies be- come protagonists, each enjoying a personality of its own, acting and reacting brutally or lovingly to the incidents portrayed. Little by little a feeling of fear and loss invades the scene as the validity of ancient beliefs - the fixed Judeo-Christian hierarchy - comes into question. What is the cosmos? Who are these Messiahs? Is it illusion? Reality? Lighting serves as an abrasive. It disturbs and forces a loss of bearings; it cuts the continuity that has led to a condition of spiritual stasis. As the lights descend upon the stage in fluid tonalities or in harsh, blinding flares, alternating with dimmer hues, they vibrate and shudder, paving the way for an atmos- phere of joy or frenzy, anguish or sensuality, isolation or related- ness, as the case may be. Floods, landslides, volcanoes, storms, eruptions, and wars are rendered viscerally by means of intri- cately patterned lighting effects, incising themselves into the events as the drama pursues its poignant course. Language is treated as an object. It too varies in intensity:</page><page sequence="7">254 Comparative Drama harsh, brutal, and metallic; at other moments soft, binding, tender, loving, and cajoling. The remarkable variety of vocal sounds the actors must emit range from the lyrical spell- binding tonalities of the Psalms, litanies, and prayers, to mani- festations of hostility achieved via Atlan's expert use of allitera- tion, onomatopoeias, and enumerations. A spirit of reverence and awe is thus created, only to be shattered moments later by puns, jokes, slang, and a coarseness of speech and accent. In this manner the audience realizes that concepts which have held sway for thousands of years - considered untouchable and sacro- sanct - have now been toppled, or at least must be re-evaluated. Rhythms are equally important in The Messiahs. They cre- ate atmosphere: stability and conformity or their antithesis, vol- canic or traumatic permutations. The change of pace destroys any possible condition of stasis that might be otherwise achieved on a cerebral, emotional, or visual level. Rhythms created via the lights, verbigerations, and gesticulations by the protagonists increase the staccato-like patterns in Atlan's poetry. Like Vachsl Lindsay's writings, words are adjuncts of rhythms, of auditory effects, from which gestures grow. Masks, "the oldest symbol of alienation," are also used in The Messiahs. Masks enable the protagonists to become deper- sonalized, to emancipate their spirit, their intellect, their feelings and thus enter the mythical domain. 16 The mask also becomes an object of mystery, a kind of totem, an instrument of trans- formation. Therefore, when slaughter takes place on the earthly sphere, the Messiahs don their blood mask and the ritual begins. The Messiahs talk of their actions, of earthly happenings, and their masks mirror the events, the attitudes, the tragedy. There is nothing static, however, in Atlan's use of the mask, as there is, for example, in No drama. Ths alteration of moods in 77i" Messiahs is abrupt, expressing the rage of powerlessness. The eight Messiahs featured in Mme Atlan's play are ir- reverent. They are shock-provokers, pathetic creatures. They are not stately, awesome, gentle, and kind as adumbrated in religious books, paintings, oratorios, and statues. Rather, they are spectacular entities in their sterility, the ossification of their thoughts, and the impotence of their beings. These God-sent Messiahs whose task it was and is to remedy the iniquities on earth and to redeem man are (except for the youngest, Benjamin) like so many decrepit, senile, somnolent</page><page sequence="8">Bettina Knapp 255 forces. They have immensely long beards and hair that virtually drags on the ground. They are dusty and give the impression of being utterly useless and worn. To underscore the feeling of desuetude these human forms create, Atlan encloses their feet in gigantic pieces of plaster while their hands and bodies are for- ever free to twist and turn in agitated but useless movements. Only Benjamin's feet remain relatively free: they are wrapped in tissue paper "like rare fruits." Each of the Messiahs is bound with cord like puppets and each frequently gets tangled in these cords, thus further restricting their movements. An analogy may be made in this respect with Beckett's Happy Days, when the female protagonist is buried in sand up to her waist in Act I, then up to her neck in the final act, denoting the passage of time and man's victimization by it. In Atlan's drama, however, time seems nonexistent. A static quality permeates. In this man- ner the utter solitude and impotence of the protagonists are re-emphasized. The Messiahs are servants in the true sense of the word. They have the souls of servants. They are not instigators nor creative forces, but rather envoys, missionaries ready to impose their ideations on others. They seem to exist in a spatial con- tinuum. They have nothing to do. Some of them have developed gangrene, others are rotting on their stools. The deus ex machina spirit symbolized by each of these ancient gentlemen - the har- binger of a New Jerusalem, a paradisiac condition as described in apocalyptic literature - becomes a ludicrously painful fairy tale. But a fairy tale also answers a need and is "the purest and simplest expression of the collective unconscious of both the society from which it emerges and the author who shapes its contours."17 The panaceas, therefore, offered by the variety of Messiah myths enunciated throughout history and enacted dur- ing the course of the play do not elevate man. They keep him in a state of servitude, injecting the belief that a cure for man's ills will emerge from the outside - when it can only come from within: first on an individual basis, then becoming collective. Each of the Messiahs is endowed with a personality of his own. Each lives out his unfulfilled mission. Papa-Messiah is the patriarchal figure par excellence. He and Moses were the only two figures to witness the birth of the world. He had helped Moses during the time of the Pharaohs. In those early years man- kind was filled with hope, and prophets were concerned directly</page><page sequence="9">256 Comparative Drama with the welfare of their people, inspiring them to greater spir- ituality, encouraging them to forge ahead in the creation of a new land, new ways, and new culture. Papa-Messiah failed in his attempt. Rather than peace, suffering and warfare continued throughout the centuries. As society "progressed," so man was dismembered and destroyed - ever more artfully as time went on. Although hope has virtually vanished, Papa-Messiah still occu- pies himself in his old age. He "burses" the other Messiahs. He tends to their needs. Messiah-Moses is decrepit and shriveled. Once a great prophet, a member of the avant-garde, he has turned into a peda- gogue, a nearsighted intellectual. Moses was the one who "in- vented" (or so it is said) the notion of "the All-Mighty," the good God who worries about mankind, its morality and its well being. Despite his failure to remedy man's ills, Moses has not yet given up hope. He wants to descend once again to try anew. He is prepared to yield to any kind of suffering in order to realize his vision. Messiah-Libido drinks and eats a lot. He is a real bon vivant. Brutal, blustering, at times, not very intelligent, he does react to pain - his own. He claims to have been traumatized by the punishments inflicted by God at Sodom. The only way he can forget his fright is by eating and drinking. He is intuitive to a certain extent because he feels the madness and nightmarish quality that has overwhelmed mankind. Messiah-Drowsy-Crank is vain and egotistical. He is to blame for the creation of atheism. He wishes he had been "God's pet," rather than Moses. He can never forgive God for the slight. He is nervous. He hates to recite the Psalms but does so out of duress and habit. It has become a reflex action. He is kind in his own way, that is, he "helps the dead stand their death" (p. 8, new version). Messiah-Eye is the contact man. His task is to look through a set of binoculars, to inform the other Mes- siahs of earthly happenings and of activities in other galaxies. His function is to see and to report. He lacks any evaluating or judging faculty. He is unfeeling and has no discernment. Mes- siah-Radio is virtually paralyzed. He has become privy to the secrets of man and animal. He shares these with the youngest of the Messiahs, Benjamin. He is the product of his function, that is, hearing. Benjamin, or "Baby Messiah," has never been down to earth. He is naive and gullible. He has only one wish: to go</page><page sequence="10">Bettina Knapp 257 down to earth. He thinks he will succeed where others have failed - in righting a wrong. Unlike the other Messiahs, he has not as yet experienced "terraphobia." Messiah-Erasure spends his time writing a history of lhe cosmos. It is twenty thousand billion pages long. He sits on his own planet. No one understands what he is saying nor is able to decipher the words that emerge from his lips. Now and then, however, one phrase takes on mean- ing: "I . . . feel . . . lonely and wretched." The action begins as the Messiahs intone a hodgepodge language: a medley of Hebrew, Hindi, Latin, Esperanto, and Negro-spiritual verbiage. With the help of Messiah-Radio and Messiah-Eye the history of mankind is reviewed in syncopated cadences: crosses, mutilations, insecticides, Messiahsides. Each time the Messiahs have entered the earthly sphere to remedy man's chaotic state, rage and persecution have resulted. Messiah- Eye takes a dim view of the entire affair. The whole lot of Mes- siahs are "outdated" - the concept of the Messiah is "outmoded." Millions of Messiahs have been called down to earth; have coun- seled the people; have warned them of impending cataclysms. To no avail. What was the fate of these Messiahs who sacrificed themselves for mankind? Most of them got lost in the cosmos. And there are no Messiahs to help the lost Messiahs. Their lot, subsequently, is even more painful than is man's destiny. The Messiahs' function grows increasingly more hazardous with the passing of years. Moses' "soul is torn." He understands that not only has man not evolved, spiritually speaking, but earthly ideas have sullied the religious notions of the Messiahs themselves. Some now believe in sleep and in striking for better working conditions. The ideations of the Messiahs - suprater- restrial beings - should be strong enough to elevate man and not lower him to an earthbound state. Messiahs must "electrify crowds" and not wallow in decrepitude. They must transcend their stagnant and worn ideas. A mood of futility invades the atmosphere. A series of signals will now intrude upon the stage happenings. These are received by Messiah-Radio. They are warnings of impending earthly catastrophes, admonitions to man and Messiahs alike: "If man does not stop living in violence, in corruption, in hatred and anger . . Rhythms and vibrations descend on stage: syn- copation, frenetic verbigerations, agitation of all sorts - like so many electric currents shot through space. Singing, screeching,</page><page sequence="11">258 Comparative Drama and cacophonies break out. They jar, grate, and lull the pro- tagonists and audiences alike. Religious chants are intermingled with garbled radio messages, ear-irritating static sounds are heard. Visual images cascade onto the acting areas in the form of multicolored lights, closeups and distant shots of excoriating events as they hurtle through the atmosphere and shatter on earth. Volcanoes, tidal waves, wars. . . . The Inspector arrives. He warns the Messiahs in severe terms: "the system has broken down," he says. Things must change. A plague rages on earth at this very moment - the plague of "lucidity." Man no longer believes in systems, ideolo- gies, creeds, or fairy tales. He seeks to examine, dissect, and use his rational functions exclusively. Illusions have vanished. Spir- ituality is outmoded, worn, ossified. The Messiahs will have to rethink their ways of being, their frames of reference. The In- spector orders one of the Messiahs to go down to earth and try to rectify the state of affairs. If the first one does not succeed, a second must volunteer, and even if it means a loss of Messiahs, a third. The disgruntled and basically timorous Messiahs do not want to set forth on such a dangerous journey. Let Moses go, says Messiah-Drowsy-Crank, he is "the most gifted." Messiah- Eye is chosen but protests. If he leaves, who will inform the other Messiahs of earthly happenings? Who will relay the dis- tress signals? The Messiahs are in a rebellious mood. They de- precate Papa-Messiah with his patriarchal rigidity and intransig- ence. They roll back the pages of history once again: they recapitulate their many attempts to remedy earthly cruelties and their impotence in each case. They blame one another for their failure. As their arguments grow in intensity, the planet begins to flicker. Suddenly, the Messiahs seem lost in space. Their sphere grows smaller. Earthly happenings invade the scene. The Great Flood. Drownings. Nightmares. Death. "The Night of Nights" has taken over, writes Messiah-Erasure. "The soul was suffering from a mortal famine . . ." and "even the dead did not know peace" (p. 22, new version). Messiah-Erasure attempts to understand, to give meaning to these cataclysms he has just viewed, to upgrade the Messiah myth. Whatever his arguments, whatever his reasoning, all fall on deaf ears like a series of innocuous platitudes that slowly filter down to earth. Other Messiahs express their views: God</page><page sequence="12">Bettina Knapp 259 will receive you, one says. He "will console you in His King- dom . . . Gold," says another. Or, still another, "Bank Mary, Mother of God. . . ." As for the Godman "Zuzu - the Cross," whom people "really thought had saved man," let "his name be blessed despite the mortal maladies his mirages gave birth to. ..." A panoply of objects now parades before the viewer - all hierophanies: statues of Messiahs in the shape of lamps, ash trays, etc. People will bow down before these objects and pray to them, worship them, kiss them - deify them. Another permutation of mood follows. "Happiness of Earth- ly People" comes to the fore, eating mid loving - the fulfillment of earthly missions. The Messiahs express their glee in joyous agitation. But then insurrection, quakes, volcanoes follow in quick succession as an age-old refrain is again heard. Hold fast, the Messiah will come. Work! A paradise that creates itself. For posterity. Recite. A paradise that creates itself. For Posterity. A paradise that creates itself, for posterity, (p. 24, new version) The order has just gone out on earth: all those hooked noses must be burned. The bones, it is said, will make a fine "soup à la stump." What will the next Messiah be like? questions Papa-Messiah. What will he wear? They decide to consult the sacred scriptures, a book known as the "Pele-Mele." A flashback now is given to the times of Moses. Messiah-Radio is bombarded with some pretty terrific messages. The Tablets of the Law have just been given to mankind. "How beautiful it is," remarks Benjamin. But what has happened since: the famous Parables, the Al- legories, the Sermon on the Mount. To no avail. One painful illusion fades into the other. The Eternal is dead. But Moses cannot accept this thought. He cannot get along without God. It is to Him that Moses prays, to whom others express their faith. The satire pursues its course. Prayers are recited: "Blessed be Thou, Master of the Worlds, who gave the cock the intelli- gence to distinguish day from obscurity." The Messiahs cry out in unison: "Happy those who are born, just to be nothing, just to have been!" (p. 37, new version). The Messiahs now seem revitalized, infused with a new spirit and a desire to invent a new earth, devoid of nightmares with "no traces of any world,</page><page sequence="13">260 Comparative Drama either living or dead." Something totally different must be in the ofBng. The cords binding the Messiahs suddenly slacken. They look down at the beauties and evils of earth. Gomorrah, for example, rages with lust, sensuality, and excitement. Bored with their im- mortality, the Messiahs begin shaking and rocking. Unsteady, they grow dizzy. Papa-Messiah attaches them once again until they regain their equilibrium. The earth is moving about too speedily at this juncture. Vertigo and then hysteria grips the Messiahs; nervousness and hiccuping laughter follow. A sense of loss invades their beings as though they had been set adrift. The second sphere makes its presence known: the author now comes into view. Liliane Atlan emerges as a character in the play and calls herself Wretchedness. She is followed by her cortège. Like a symbol of all those creative spirits who suffer most intensely for humanity, she is livid and no longer has the strength to walk. She is carried on stage on a chair by her hus- band and her doctor. Her mother, dressed in a fur coat, trots be- side them. Her sisters follow. Wretchedness is haunted by the fact that she must drag her body around with her, particularly that of a woman. On the verge of madness, she weaves her way about, followed by her crew, like the flagellants who paraded about in their hideous deformities during the Middle Ages, or like the ancient Greek choruses who enumerated past events and proph- esied man's destiny. Wretchedness can no longer bear the pain of suffering. She abhors the present and vomits up the past. Con- flict rages within her. Although she rejects the very notion of the Messiah, she is in desperate need of him; she fears for his life. The doctor announces to her that she is pregnant. She refuses to believe it. Again she is haunted by ambivalent feelings: to bring another being into existence in order to inflict pain and suffering upon him? But if she aborts, the world may lose a Messiah. The third sphere comes into view. A raft is now visible. It is filled with dead people: the Ship of Death. Pushed by a great wind, its contents seem to have taken on the form of congealed spirits, of brittle dolls which are immobile in spirit and body. The protagonists no longer talk in sentences but in separate words, in images not in conceptualizations. Russian immigrants who have known pogroms are on the raft - whose families have been slaughtered, whose remains are now seen, victims of con-</page><page sequence="14">Bettina Knapp 261 centration camps. Mikaelsohn, a German who thought his medals would protect him and never protested against Hitler, emerges. He should have spoken out his messages. A shop-keeper and a mystic enunciate their songs. Vultures begin tearing at them and they must flee. Rhythms change. The "raft turns as if sent from port to port," its cargo is unacceptable to humanity. No one dares face the wanderers as they beg for asylum. Are they pariahs? scourges? Is this God's mercy? Is this the way man has reacted throughout the centuries to the various Messianic mes- sages? The Messiahs remain mute like "the moon, the sea, the sky." The raft stops at another city. Beauty, light, joy. The occu- pants look longingly at the vision before them, but they must move on. Sadness results. Pain intrudes as they hear the words "your song will be sublime when you win be in crumbs," or as they face the fact that they will never fulfill their destiny: the book one of them wanted to write will remain unwritten, the painting will remain unpainted, the music amorphous, all buried. . . . The mystic, old Rabbi Malaiel, had been forced to wash the streets in his underwear. He did so unabashed because he had faith in God. He was tortured but accepted the pain because he believed in God. Then, slowly, and unknowingly he lapsed into madness and "died hilarious." Lydia, a Russian immigrant, vic- tim of a pogrom, was raped, her child killed. Emmanuel, a poet and dreamer, remained passive, aloof from the event, and did not fulfill his mission in life. An autumnal light bathes the stage. Papa-Messiah tries to placate Moses. His work, declares Moses, has been to no avail. What he has seen on earth is unbelievable. Moses cannot be consoled. He hears cries rising up from the earth, from those who cannot be born, whose parents have been massacred, muti- lated, and tortured: The earth pivots Man's folly gains, (p. 88, new version) Galaxies come into view once again. Litanies echo forth like "minerals, crystalline, eternal, indifferent." Moses, Messiah- Drowsy-Crank, and Benjamin go down to earth. The planet is gravely ül and Messiahs are needed. The song of death and rebirth is crooned:</page><page sequence="15">262 Comparative Drama One day you die One day you're reborn You play your mystery And then you disappear Night must fall but in eternity I die to be reborn Night must fall but in eternity I die to be reborn, (p. 100, new version) Moses will go down. He prays for all the lost Messiahs: those lost in action, those who were crucified, and those who tried to remedy earthly situations. The Messiahs sob in unison and in- tone their Psalms. Darkness invades the atmosphere. The Mes- siahs assume their rigid and fixed forms - the ones they had at the outset of the drama. Their destiny is decrepitude. Time freezes over the stage happenings. The Messiahs return to their puppetlike stance, covered with the patina of dust. It has been said that after Genet, Beckett, and Ionesco, French theatre degenerated, or better still, died. With the emergence of a playwright of Liliane Atlan's stature and scope, one realizes that drama in France is, on the contrary, very much alive and well. Liliane Atlan is neither an ethnic writer nor a polemist. Her theatre dramatizes the song of a soul. It is uni- versal because she has that remarkable faculty of expressing her personal life experience in collective terms. She, therefore, reaches her audiences - in the deepest of ways. She engulfs them first, then journeys with them to cosmic spheres, releases them there in a seemingly dimensionless space. It is no wonder that audiences have been deeply touched by such a play as The Mes- siahs, but also filled with a corrosive sense of malaise. The play is abrasive. It challenges the very foundations of man's ideations, the very basis of his organized religions. Liliane Atlan offers no panaceas for humanity's plight. No appeals are made to man's nonexistent humanity. The Messiahs unsettles. It provokes. It questions. Who are the Messiahs? Have there ever been any? What is God? What is man's Destiny? His function? Are these concepts illusions? Or is it all theatre?
