YOUNGREN "I read the best of literature, science and philosophy," Dr. Tamkin said.... "Korzyb- ski, Aristotle, Freud, W. H. Sheldon, and all the great poets. You answer me like a layman. You haven't applied your mind strictly to this." Saul Bellow, Seize the Day SINCE THE INFLUENCE of general seman- tics is certainly not as strong today as it was, say, in the forties, it may seem strange for an essay about it of this length to appear (or even be written) at this time. Besides my own interest in the subject-which dates back to a bewilder- ing but intriguing freshman English course that, I now see, had a good deal of general semantics in it-I had two reasons for wanting to write such an essay. First, conversations with teachers of freshman composition and with my own freshmen had convinced me that while the influ- ence is less strong than it once was, it is still considerable and pervasive. General semantics is still, I think, where most col- lege (and now secondary school) teach- ers of English turn for answers to the large theoretical questions about language that lie outside the proper subject matter of linguistics-questions about how lan- guage works and how it is related to the external world. Second, to my knowl- edge there has never been a good, com- prehensive critical examination of gen- eral semantics. With the exception of Professor Max Black, whom I will have more to say about later, professional philosophers, who of course. are best equipped for the job, have not thought Korzybski or his popularizers' worth their attention. Yet it seems to me clear that any influential point of view, simply because it is influential, deserves such an examination. Therefore though I am not William H. Youngren teaches English at Smith College. This essay is from a book in process tentatively titled Literature and the Study of Meaning. 1Korzybski's most important book, usually regarded as the Bible of general semantics, is Science and Sanity (Lancaster, Pa. and New York, 1933). The popularizations that have had most influence are Stuart Chase's The Tyranny of Words (New York, 1938) and The Power of Words (New York, 1953), and S. I. Hayakawa's Language in Action (New York, 1939) and its later revision, Language in Thought and Action (New York, 1949), which was itself revised in 1964. In giving references to Science and Sanity I will simply give the page number in paren- theses; in references to the other books, the page number will be preceded by an abbrevia- tion of the title: TW, PW, or LTA. Similarly, I will refer to Hayakawa's recent collection of essays, Symbol, Status and Personality (New York, 1963), as SSP. All references to LTA will be to the 1964 revision. 253</page><page sequence="2">254 COLLEGE ENGLISH myself a professional philosopher and am acutely aware of the limitations that a lack of philosophical training imposes, I thought it might be worthwhile to go ahead and try anyway-with the addi- tional aims of acquainting English teachers with some recent developments in linguistic philosophy and also of per- haps stimulating somebody better quali- fied than I am to do a better job on gen- eral semantics. Now Science and Sanity is an ex- tremely forbidding book and is prob- ably read nowadays by very few people -as Stuart Chase candidly admits, "A book on the clarification of meaning should not be so difficult to understand" (TW 94). But if we are to get a clear idea of general semantics, it is still to Korzybski rather than his popularizers that we must go, and so I will begin by simply paraphrasing his argument, using his own words wherever possible and withholding judgment until the picture is complete. This will enable me to avoid tiresomely repeating "Korzybski says" and "Korzybski tells us" and "Korzybski writes." Until I give further notice, then, what follows is to be taken not as my own view but as Korzybski's-or at least as what I understand his view to have been. The first step in reaching a scientific understanding of the way language works is to make the following distinc- tion between two levels-or groups of levels-of reality: first there is the objec- tive or unspeakable or nonverbal level (or levels), composed of objects, events and feelings as we experience them, and of the submicroscopic flux that lies be- hind these, inaccessible to ordinary sense experience but known to modem phys- ics; then there is the verbal level (or levels), composed of the words and state- ments we use to talk about the objective level(s). This distinction is sharp and ab- solute, since "an object or feeling, say, our toothache, is not verbal, is not words. Whatever we may say will not be the objective level, which remains funda- mentally un-speakable. Thus, we can sit on the object called 'a chair,' but we cannot sit on the noise we made or the name we applied to that object .... The objective level is not words, can not be reached by words alone" (34). That is, we can say "toothache" or "chair," or we can make statements like "This is the ugliest chair I've ever seen" or "This is the third toothache I've had in two weeks"; but by using words alone we can never give another person the ex- perience of seeing the chair, nor can we make him feel the pain in our tooth. Of course he can look at the chair for him- self if he wants to (though it makes no sense even to imagine the possibility of his having somebody else's toothache), but the point is that we cannot speak either the chair or the toothache, we can only speak words. Now this distinction seems obvious enough once it's pointed out, yet we habitually overlook it and confuse or identify verbal levels with objective levels. And the structure of our language encourages such confusions. "Thus, for instance, we handle what we call a pen- cil. Whatever we handle is un-speakable; yet we say 'this is a pencil,' which state- ment is unconditionally false to facts, because the object appears as an absolute individual and is not words. . .. 'Say whatever you choose about the object, and whatever you might say is not it.' Or, in other words: 'Whatever you might say the object "is," well it is not' " (35). Statements like "This is a pencil," which assert that something is something else and which we may call subject- predicate statements, are fundamental to languages like English, and their impor- tance is augmented by the fact that the logic we have inherited from Aristotle "assumed that everything could be ex- pressed in a subject-predicate form" (189). Yet such statements, simply by</page><page sequence="3">GENERAL SEMANTICS AND SCIENCE OF MEANING 255 virtue of their form, invariably assert something false. This point will become clear if we first understand that in all ordinary perception our nervous systems mislead us in a way analogous to the way language misleads us. "If we take something, anything, let us say the object already referred to, called 'pencil,' and enquire what it re- presents, according to science 1933, we find that the 'scientific object' represents an 'event,' a mad dance of 'electrons,' which is different every instant, which never repeats itself, which is known to consist of extremely complex dynamic processes of very fine structure, acted upon by, and reacting upon, the rest of the universe, inextricably connected with everything else and dependent on every- thing else" (387). Thus the pencil as we see it, an ordinary object that seems stable and self-contained, is an illusion: the reality is a submicroscopic event that "our rough 'senses' " (383) are "not adapted to register" (382). And it's the same with all ordinary objects: each is really "only a shadow cast by the scientific object" (402), and "we see what we see because we miss all the finer de- tails" (376). Therefore, "if we enquire as to the neurological processes involved in registering the object, we find that the nervous system has abstracted, from the infinite numbers of sub-microscopic characteristics of the event, a large but finite number of macroscopic charac- teristics" (387-389), and so we may think of the ordinary object as an abstraction from the scientific object or event. We see then that the relation between the two nonverbal levels of reality is such that the second level (the ordinary object) is an abstraction constructed from the first by omitting "all the finer details" -though in practice we usually confuse the two levels and imagine that the pen- cil we see is the pencil that's really "out there" in the world. The relation between the second nonverbal level and the first verbal level-between, that is, the ordi- nary object and the name or label we attach to it-is precisely the same, for "the number of characteristics which we ascribe by definition to the label is still smaller than the number of character- istics the [ordinary] object has" (387). Even if we gave a favorite pencil a prop- er name (as people give names to their boats or cars) rather than simply calling it "pencil," "we would ascribe, perhaps, its length, thickness, shape, colour, hard- ness, etc.2 But we would mostly disre- gard the accidental characteristics, such as a scratch on its surface, or the kind of glue by which the two wooden parts of the objective 'pencil' are held together, etc." (387). Thus "we see that the object is not the event but an abstraction from it, and that the label is not the object nor the event, but a still further abstraction" (389). Yet just as we usually confuse the scientific object with the ordinary object, so too we usually confuse the ordinary object with the label we attach to it. That we do so is largely a result of the subject-predicate structure of our language, as seen in statements like "This is a pencil"-to which we are now ready to return. Now "all language can be considered as names either for un-speakable entities on the objective level, be it things or feelings, or as names for relations" (20). It's important to notice that some words are names for relations rather than ob- jects, because it is this fact that keeps a sentence or statement from being a mere list. "When we use a series of names for objects, 'Smith, Brown, Jones' etc., we say nothing. We do not produce a proposition. But if we say 'Smith kicks Brown,' we have introduced the term 'kicks,' which is not a name for an object, but . . . a 'relation word' " (152). By 2"Etc." is one-the first one we've encoun- tered-of a number of expressions Korzybski habitually abbreviates, as he explains on pp. 15- 16. Here and subsequently I have tacitly ex- panded these abbreviations.</page><page sequence="4">256 COLLEGE ENGLISH analogy, we can see that in "This is a pencil," "this" and "pencil" are names for objects and "is" is the name of a relation asserted to hold between them, the rela- tion we usually call identity or " 'absolute sameness' in 'all' aspects" (194). But since "whatever we can see, handle, etc., repre- sents an absolute individual, and different from anything else" (262), it's clear that identity is "never to be found in this world, nor in our heads" (194), and that therefore all assertions of identity are "structurally false to fact" (202). So the statement "This is a pencil" misleads us by asserting a nonexistent relation. But it also misleads us in another way, more directly related to the distinction be- tween verbal and objective levels from which we began. "This" refers to a par- ticular pencil as we experience it, a sec- ond level nonverbal abstraction, while "pencil" refers to a verbal abstraction, the set of defining characteristics common to all pencils; and therefore "This is a pen- cil" not only confuses two separate entities by asserting them to be identical, but also confuses nonverbal with verbal reality because the two entities it asserts to be identical exist on different sides of the line that separates one group of levels from the other. This double confusion is characteristic of subject-predicate statements, and so it is clear that the subject-predicate struc- ture of our language encourages us to think of the relation between language and nonverbal reality as one of identity. But what is the true relation? We have seen that just as every ordinary object of experience is an abstraction from a submicroscopic event, so any label we attach to the ordinary object is an ab- straction from it. And we have also seen that a similar relation holds between true statements and facts-taking facts to be collections of ordinary objects in some relation to one another. That is, "Smith kicks Brown" is true (if it is true) because the object designated by "Smith" happens to be in the relation designated by "kicks" to the object designated by "Brown." And "This is a pencil" is (and must necessarily be) always false because the relation designated by "is" could never possibly hold between any two entities-even if they existed on the same side of the verbal-nonverbal dividing line, as Smith and Brown do. To put it another way: that Smith kicks Brown can be a fact and is at least a possible state of affairs, but that this is a pencil can never even be a possible state of affairs, let alone a fact. Thus we can say that a true statement must fit or correspond to some fact, for though the statement will inevitably omit "all the finer details" of the fact it repre- sents, it must at least have a structure similar to that of the fact-it won't do to say "Brown kicks Smith" if Smith is kicking Brown. The relation of a true statement to a fact-and, by extension, of a statement that might sometimes be true to a possible state of affairs-will then be rather like the relation of an accurate map to its piece of territory, for "a map is not the territory it represents, but, if correct, it has a similar structure to the territory, which accounts for its usefulness" (58). And when we general- ize this insight about statements to lan- guage as a whole, we see that "as words are not the objects which they represent, structure, and structure alone, becomes the only link which connects our verbal processes with the empirical data" (59). Therefore "if we reflect upon our lan- guages, we find that at best they must be considered only as maps" (58). Now "any map or language, to be of maximum usefulness, should, in struc- ture, be similar to the structure of the empirical world. Likewise, from the point of view of a theory of sanity, any system or language should, in structure, be simi- lar to the structure of our nervous sys- tem" (11). If a language does not fulfill these conditions, the consequences for its speakers can be disastrous. "We do not realize what tremendous power the</page><page sequence="5">GENERAL SEMANTICS AND SCIENCE OF MEANING 257 structure of an habitual language has. It is not an exaggeration to say that it en- slaves us ... and that the structure which a language exhibits, and impresses upon us unconsciously, is automatically pro- jected upon the world around us" (90). In the past "the usual procedure" has been as follows: "first, we have our structurally 'preconceived' doctrines and languages; next, we observe the structure of the world; and then we try to force the observed facts into the linguistic structural patterns" (219). Obviously this won't do, and in fact "our only possible procedure in advancing our knowledge" is to do exactly the reverse, "to match our verbal structures, often called theories, with empirical structures, and see if our verbal predictions are ful- filled empirically or not, thus indicating that the two structures are either similar or dissimilar" (63). Therefore we must "start with silent observations, and search empirically for structure; next, we invent verbal structures similar to them; and, finally, we see what can be said about the situation, and so test the language" (219). So the task that lies before us is nothing less than to revise the structure of our language, and it will involve asking (and hopefully answering) three very large questions, the first and third of which we have already answered in part. (1) What are the structures of the empirical world and of the nervous sys- tem? (2) What language ( if any) has a structure that matches their structures, and how does it do this? (3) What (if anything) can be done to bring the struc- ture of English closer to that of the ideal language? We have already seen that "whatever we can see, handle, etc., represents an absolute individual, and different from. anything else" (262), and so we can say that "in general terms, the structure of the external world is such that we deal always on the objective levels with ab- solute individuals, with absolute dif- ferences" (263). But "in a world of only absolute differences, without similarities, recognition, and, therefore, 'intelligence,' would be impossible" (165). Intelligence is only made possible by the nervous sys- tem, which possesses a structure that en- ables us to recognize similarities as well as differences. This structure "is such that, on some levels, we produce dy- namic abstractions; on others, static" (288). The dynamic abstractions (which we ordinarily call sensations) are "manu- factured by the lower nerve centres, which are closer to, and in direct contact with, actual life experiences" (297). Since "the outside world is an ever-changing chain of events, a kind of flux;... those nerve centres in closest contact with the outside world must react in a shifting way" (290), and so the dynamic abstrac- tions they manufacture are "non- permanent, shifting, vague and un-speak- able, . . . cannot be transmitted, . . and have a private, non-public character" (297). "As 'sensations' were often very deceptive and, therefore, did not always lead to survival, a nervous system which somehow retained vestiges, or 'memo- ries,' of former 'sensations' and could recombine them, shift them etc., proved of higher survival value, and so 'intelli- gence' evolved, from the lowest to the highest degrees" (169). These vestiges or memories (which we ordinarily call ideas or mental pictures) are "abstractions from the lower order abstractions" (297) that we call sensations, and since "they have lost their shifting character" (291) by virtue of "being further removed from the outside world" (297), they are "rela- tively static" (291), "capable of being transmitted" (280), and "may be, pre- served and used over and over again in extra-neural forms, as recorded in books and otherwise" (291). In fact the "main importance" of these static abstractions "is in their public character" (280). We can say then that "the nervous system is an abstracting, integrating mechanism" (310) whose "structure... is such that it abstracts, or generalizes, or integrates</page><page sequence="6">258 COLLEGE ENGLISH etc., in higher orders, and so finds simi- larities" (263). Now we are in a position to ask our second question, whether any known language has a structure that matches those of the empirical world and the nervous system. Since "we deal always on the objective levels with absolute in- dividuals, with absolute differences" (263), it's obvious that any language whose structure was to match that of the empirical world would have to contain "an indefinite number of proper names, each different" (262); but if its structure were also to match that of the nervous system, it would also have to contain static, higher order abstractions that would make it possible to show similari- ties as well as differences. When we re- flect that "mathematizing [has] proved to be at each historical period the most excellent human activity, producing re- sults of such enormous importance and unexpected validity as not to be com- pared with any other musings of man" (67), mathematics would seem the most likely candidate for our ideal language. And sure enough, when we examine the structure of mathematics this hunch is borne out and the reasons for its supe- riority as a language become clear. Since English (like all other natural languages) contains only a finite number of words, it obviously fails to meet our first requirement, that the ideal language contain "an indefinite number of proper names, each different" (262). But when we turn to mathematics, "we find such a language uniquely in numbers, each number 1, 2, 3 etc., being a unique, sharply distinguishable, proper name" (262). At first glance English does seem to meet our second requirement, since words like "pencil" are static, higher order abstractions that indicate the ways in which all pencils are similar to each other. But when we look more closely, we see that everyday abstractions like "pencil" are defective in a way that mathematical abstractions like "circle" are not, for "we may describe or 'define' a 'pencil' in as great detail as we please, yet it is impossible to include all the characteristics which we may discover in this actual objective pencil" (68). This, as we saw, is one of the reasons subject- predicate statements are always false. But "in our definition of a mathematical circle" as "the locus of all points in a plane at equal distance from a point called the centre," it's clear that "all particulars [are] included, and whatever we may find about this mathematical cir- cle later on will be strictly dependent on this definition, and no new character- istics, not already included in this defini- tion, will ever appear. We see, here, that mathematical abstractions are character- ized by the fact that they have all particu- lars included" (67). Combining our two requirements, we might say that what we need, and what English fails on two counts to provide, is a kind of proper name that will show differences and similarities simultaneously. Now the vocabulary of mathematics contains not only numerical constants like 1 and 2 that can function just as proper names like "Smith" and "Brown" do in English, but also variables like x and y. Therefore we can create expres- sions like "xi, (i= 1, 2, 3, ... n), where the x shows, let us say, that we deal with a variable x with many values, and the number we assign, to i indicates the in- dividuality under consideration. From the structural point of view, such a vo- cabulary is similar to the world around us; it accounts for the individuality of the external objects, it also is similar to the structure of our nervous system, be- cause it allows generalizations or higher order abstractions, emphasizes the ab- stracting nervous characteristics, etc. The subscript emphasizes the differences; the letter x implies the similarities" (262). Therefore expressions of the form xi are the sort of proper name we are looking for. So much for our second question. But</page><page sequence="7">GENERAL SEMANTICS AND SCIENCE OF MEANING 259 if we are to find an answer to our third, we must find some way of creating ex- pressions like xi in ordinary English, of manufacturing "an endless array of in- dividual names without unduly expand- ing the vocabulary" (381). As it happens, this can be done, for "in daily language a similar device is extremely useful and has very far-reaching psycho-logical semantic effects. Thus, if we say 'pen- cill,' 'pencil2,' . . . 'pencil,' " (263), we "produce individual names, and so cover the differences" between individual pen- cils, and also, "by keeping the main root word 'pencil,' we keep the implications of daily life, and also of similarities" (381). Therefore the first major way in which we can revise the structure of English is to append index numbers like 1 and 2 to general terms like "pencil." "It has already been emphasized repeatedly that our abstracting from physical ob- jects or situations proceeds by missing, neglecting, or forgetting" characteristics, and it is precisely "those disregarded characteristics [that] usually produce errors in evaluation, resulting in the di- sasters of life. If we acquire this exten- sional mathematical habit of using special names for unique individuals, we become conscious, not only of the similarities, but also of the differences, which con- sciousness is one of the mechanisms for helping the proper evaluation and so preventing or eliminating semantic dis- turbances" (381-382). This consciousness, which we may call consciousness of abstracting, may be defined as an "awareness that in our pro- cess of abstracting we have left out characteristics" (416). Now we saw earlier that subject-predicate statements like "This is a pencil," by asserting the non-existent relation of identity to hold between the particular pencil before us and the label "pencil," work against the achievement of this awareness by en- couraging us to forget that the process of abstracting by which we have con- structed the label from the object in- volved the omission of some of the ob- ject's characteristics. Since the trouble- maker in such statements (and in lan- guages like English that are based on them) is the seemingly innocent word "is," we may also define consciousness of abstracting as "remembering the 'is not' " (416) that lies behind every "is." The achievement of this consciousness will then also be seen to depend on "the denial of the 'is' of identity" (417)-that is, on never using "is" as it is used in subject-predicate statements. This is the second major revision we must make in the structure of English. "If we use the 'is' at all, and it is extremely difficult to avoid entirely this auxiliary verb when using languages which, to a large extent, depend on it, we must be particularly careful not to use 'is' as an identity term" (400). Therefore the two main answers to our third question are that we should use index numbers and avoid the "is" of identity. But since "the introduction of a few new, and the rejection of some old, terms suggests desirable structural changes" (59), it will also help if we use terms like "order," "relation," "struc- ture," and "space-time," and avoid terms like "space" and "time," which are false to the world as we know it through modem physics and as misleading in their way as "is." If we make these revisions, "the new desirable semantic results [will] follow as automatically as the old undesirable ones followed" (63) from the use of the old, primitive subject- predicate language. II This is the basic argument of Science and Sanity, and we may turn now to consider its merits. If we revise our lan- guage in the ways Korzybski recom- mends, will the resulting consciousness of abstracting actually give us a clearer view of the world and make us able to agree and cooperate with one another more often then we do now? Perhaps</page><page sequence="8">260 COLLEGE ENGLISH the first thing that strikes us is that Korzybski and his disciples, in their books, don't use the revised language but just ordinary English. They rarely em- ploy index numbers except when telling us that we should, and one doesn't get the impression that they use "is" any differently, or any less often, than other writers. Of course this might just be be- cause they are writing for an audience that still speaks and reads the old, unre- vised sort of English: once Korzybski's ideas have been put into practice on a grand scale, not only general semantics texts but all books will be peppered with index numbers and all writers will use "is," as Hayakawa recommends, only "as an auxiliary verb ('he is coming')" (L TA 315.) But I will argue that this is not the real reason. I think the real reason lies deeper, in the fact that Korzybski's recommendations spring from a general view of the nature and origin of language that is about as mistaken as it could pos- sibly be; they have not been followed, even by their originator, simply because they cannot be. Take the index numbers first. What if I suddenly began writing sentences like "Semanticist3 writes in book7 that phi- losopher12 wrongly answers question38" instead of "Chase writes in The Tyranny of Words that Plato wrongly answers the question of what words mean"? I take it this is the sort of sentence that Korzybski's recommendation, followed as literally and generally as he wants it to be, would produce. At any rate the problem is clear: how would you know (for example) which semanticist I was as- signing the index number 3 to, unless we had previously agreed on it? Of course if I were speaking rather than writing and if Chase happened to be in the room, I could point to him as I said "semanti- cist3," but I couldn't very well point to Plato without digging him up, and ques- tions like "the question of what words mean" aren't even objects and so can't even be dug up and pointed to. Some previous agreement would there- fore be necessary. But agreements can only be made in language and it is im- portant to ask which language we would use to make these, ordinary English or the new revised language employing in- dex numbers. If we reflect a moment, it seems clear that to say things like "Let Plato be philosopher12" or "Let the ques- tion of what words mean be question3s" we need the proper names, general terms and individuating descriptive phrases of ordinary English, and that to try to use only the new language would be like try- ing to give somebody the key to a code in a message written in that code: if he already knew the code there would be no point in giving him the key, and if he didn't know it then he wouldn't under- stand the message. So whenever we wanted to talk about a new semanticist or question or anything else that was not there to be pointed to, we would have to drop back into ordinary English. There could never be a point at which even two people (let alone a whole linguistic com- munity) could agree to use only the new revised language simply because there is never a point at which anybody can enu- merate and classify in advance all the things he is going to want to talk about in the future. Since we could never adopt the new language and stick to it, the index num- bers could never contribute to a general linguistic revision in the way Korzybski hoped. At best they would only be like code words or abbreviations that we adopt for reasons of secrecy or conven- ience, explain at the time of their adop- tion, and use within the context of our ordinary language. For example: "From now on, in the interests of national security, all official communiques will refer to the pending invasion of Canada as OPERATION TUNDRA." Perhaps Hayakawa unconsciously realizes this, for he reduces the index numbers still further, to private mnemonic devices, and waters down Korzybski's recom-</page><page sequence="9">GENERAL SEMANTICS AND SCIENCE OF MEANING 261 mendation to the advice that we "Use index numbers and dates as reminders that no word ever has exactly the same meaning twice. Cowl is not cow2, cow2 is not cow3, . .. Smith1963 is not Smith1964, Smith1965 is not Smith1970, ." (LTA 315). If the index numbers are merely private "reminders," the troubling question of prior agreement is sidestepped since there is no one else to agree with; and it's also sidestepped by thinking of dates as examples of index numbers since we have already agreed which year was 1965 and which will be 1970. But of course to treat the index numbers as Hayakawa does is to give up the effort to make English structurally similar to mathematics, and thus tacitly to admit that one of Korzybski's central aims is mistaken. Korzybski and his followers obviously sense the practical difficulties involved in using index numbers since they don't use them themselves, and we might well wonder how they could have missed the important theoretical difficulty we have noticed. I think the reason is that they, like many earlier thinkers, believe quite seriously that language itself was insti- tuted among men by just the sort of im- possible agreement-or "convention," as it has often been called-that the assign- ing of the index numbers would demand. This can be seen in Korzybski but it comes through still more clearly in Chase and Hayakawa. They are more practical and less theoretical than he is, and since agreement is the main practical result his theories are supposed to produce, they are eager to show that we have a heritage of agreement dating back to the very establishment of the most character- istically human institution. As an exam- ple take Hayakawa's definition of "the symbolic process": The process by means of which human beings can arbitrarily make certain things stand for other things may be called the symbolic process. Whenever two or more human beings can communicate with each other, they can, by agreement, make anything stand for anything . Of all forms of symbolism, language is the most highly developed, most sub- tle, and most complicated. It has been pointed out that human beings, by agree- ment, can make anything stand for any- thing. Now, human beings have agreed, in the course of centuries of mutual de- pendency, to let the various noises that they can produce with their lungs, throats, tongues, teeth, and lips systemau- cally stand for specified happenings in their nervous systems. We call that sys- tem of agreements language. (LTA 24, 26-27) Or take this little fable Chase tells to help us remember that "words have no mean- ing in themselves": Suppose that an Englishman and a Frenchman are wrecked on a desert island.... Each flatly refuses to learn the other's language. .. . Gestures serve for a time, but for certain tasks words are badly needed. So they decide, by ges- tures, to invent a new language which is neither French nor English.... They go down to the beach and begin. John points to the sea, waving his arm to comprehend the whole expanse. Louis nods. John writes on his pad WAM. Louis nods. "Wam" is to be the word for "sea" or "mer." . . .And so they go round the island, making up strictly neutral words, short and easy, for all the common objects in which they are mutually interested because of the work there is to do. Then John invites Louis by gestures to look at him while he does a pantomime walk. "Rab" is the word for walk, "ral" that for run .... So they invent words for all their common acts. Now the task becomes more difficult. They have a word for "tree," but how shall they signify a collection of trees, or a wood? They work it out, perhaps by adding "ez" as a suffix.

Yet not a single word means anything in itself. (T W 71-72) Now it is not hard to see why the idea that language was instituted by agree- ment has appealed even to men who, un- like general semanticists, had no special stake in proving that "Cultural and intel- lectual cooperation is the greatest princi- ple of human life" (LTA 14). If history had been a bit different, after all, we might well be saying "electropix" instead of "television" or-as one Renaissance logician actually proposed-"endsay" in- stead of "conclusion"; and we know as a matter of record that we say "anode," "cathode" and "ion" merely because a nineteenth century polymath named Whewell happened to suggest the terms to Faraday. It's easy enough, then, to imagine that any object or quality or action might have been called something different, and of course in foreign lan- guages almost all of them are. "Thus we may conceive," wrote Locke, "how words . . . came to be made use of by men as the signs of their ideas; not by any natural connexion that there is be- tween particular articulate sounds and certain ideas, for then there would be but one language amongst all men; but by a voluntary imposition, whereby such a word is made arbitrarily the mark of such an idea."3 But we forsake the realm of possibil- ity for the kingdom of myth when we extrapolate from the picture of civilized men agreeing, in a common language they already speak, to call television "television," to the picture of language- less men somehow conveying to each other by gestures the revolutionary idea of instituting a language with a certain grammar, sound system and vocabulary. As Bertrand Russell once remarked, "We can hardly suppose a parliament of hitherto speechless elders meeting to- gether and agreeing to call a cow a cow and a wolf a wolf."4 Yet this is precisely what Hayakawa and Chase do suppose in the passages just quoted. Though Chase admits that grammatical inflections might be "more difficult" to agree on than names, he doesn't realize that point- ing is not necessarily a clear and unam- biguous way of singling out features of the physical world for attention and that therefore it might be impossible even to agree on names: "Words, unlike point- ing, have no meaning in themselves" (TW 54), he tells us, clearly implying that acts of pointing do have meaning in themselves. But what if when Louis pointed to the sea, John thought he was trying to elicit a word for water or wave or blue or deep or wide? Or what if John didn't even see that Louis' object was to get him to agree on a word? Such mis- understandings couldn't possibly be pre- vented or cleared up without a common language already being in use. Hayakawa seems in fact to realize this when he qualifies his definition of the symbolic process by adding "Whenever two or more human beings can communicate with each other." But then a few pages later, when he comes to apply the defini- tion specifically to language, he omits the qualification: "It has been pointed out that human beings, by agreement, can make anything stand for anything." So the conventionalist myth (as it is sometimes called) assumes precisely what it sets out to explain, the existence of a common language; and once we see through the myth, we can also see through Korzybski's recommendation about index numbers. Let us turn now to his recommendation that we "abandon permanently the use of the 'is' of iden- tity" (60), a recommendation based, we recall, on his conviction that what he 3Essay Concerning Human Understanding, III ii 1. 4The Analysis of Mind (London, 1921), p. 190.</page><page sequence="11">GENERAL SEMANTICS AND SCIENCE OF MEANING 263 calls subject-predicate statements are really identity statements that inevi- tably assert something false about a world in which nothing is exactly like anything else and everything is in perpetual flux. Since this view of subject-predicate state- ments is the main source of the opposi- tion to Aristotle that led Korzybski to christen his own system "non-Aristote- lian," it is at least as important to him as his belief that ordinary English can and must be made structurally similar to mathematics. And it is just as vulnerable. In the first place, as Professor Max Black has pointed out, Korzybski is charging Aristotle not merely with an absurdity but with an absurdity that Aristotle ex- pressly repudiated: What Aristotle is alleged to have believed and taught is that such statements as "Water is wet" and "Dewey is a philo- sopher" mean that water is identical with wetness, and Dewey is identical with the characteristic of being a phi- losopher. ... It is worth noting that Korzybski gives no quotation from Aristotle to support this charge. And it should be said, as a matter of historical justice, that there is no evidence that Aristotle or his fol- lowers believed anything so absurd. One sufficient reason is that the view with which they are charged would be inconsistent with the standard syllogistic doctrine of the impossibility of convert- ing universal propositions. If the "is" in "Water is wet" were the "is" of identity, as alleged, the truth of that proposition would automatically entail the truth of the converse proposition that all wetness is water. Now it is, of course, a central part of the doctrine of Aristotelian logic that the proposition All A is B cannot be automatically replaced by the converse, All B is A. Again, if Aristotle believed the absurd doctrine which is ascribed to him, he would have to believe that Plato and Socrates and Aristotle himself were all the same person. For, if all of them were identical with being a philosopher, all of them must be identical with one another. Even a stupid man would hardly believe in these absurd consequences; and Aristotle was very far from being stupid.5 And to this I might add that though there is a Greek word that behaves very much like our word "is," it can, unlike "is," often be omitted without damaging the sense of the sentence, and Aristotle often does omit it from subject-predicate propositions. More important, in the technical works outlining his theory of the syllogism Aristotle never uses this word in stating subject-predicate prop- ositions, but in the interests of gram- matical clarity replaces it either by a word that means "belongs to" or by one that means "is predicated of." So Korzybski is wrong on two counts about subject-predicate propositions as they appear in Aristotelian logic: they are not assertions of identity and they need not (and usually do not) contain an "is." Therefore his recommendation is pointless since it was made to correct a situation that does not exist, and we can see that it's absurd as well if we simply try not using "is" for a while. It won't do merely to say that "it is extremely difficult to avoid entirely this auxiliary verb when using languages which, to a large extent, depend on it" (400): we must realize that it is impossible to do so and still speak English. But as with the index numbers, the interesting thing is not the absurdity of Korzvbski's recom- mendation but the reasons he and his fol- lowers don't see that it's absurd-reasons that again have to do with a mistaken general view of the origin of language. 5"Korzybski's General Semantics," In Lan- guage and Philosophy (Ithaca, 1949), p. 230. Korzybski's misconceptions about logic in gen- eral and Aristotelian logic in particular are the part of his work I am least qualified to deal with; I am therefore especially grateful to Pro- fessor Black for covering them thoroughly in his excellent essay.</page><page sequence="12">264 COLLEGE ENGLISH In specifying the sort of identity that subject-predicate statements assert, Kor- zybski often speaks of a language founded on such statements and on the "is" of identity as "a language of 'sensations' " (e.g. 372), and to show the unreliability of such a language he gives this example: Let us take three pails of water; the first at the temperature of 10 * centigrade, the second at 300, and the third at 500. Let us put the left hand in the first pail and the right in the third. If we presently with- draw the left hand from the first pail and put it in the second, we feel how nicely warm the water in the second pail is. But, if we withdraw the right hand from the third pail and put it in the second, we notice how cold the water is. The temperature of the water in the second pail was practically not different in the two cases, yet our feelings regis- tered a marked difference. The differ- ence in the "feel" depended on the for- mer conditions to which our hands had been subjected. Thus, we see that a lan- guage of "senses" is not a very reliable language, and that we cannot depend on it for general purposes of evaluation. (372-373) Now no one could quarrel with some of the implications we are meant to draw from this. Feelings may indeed vary from one person to another, and the same per- son's may vary under varying conditions. It would be stupid to forget or ignore this, and to insist that because the water felt warm it simply was warm, and that anybody who said it was (or felt) cold either was not feeling it properly or had damaged nerve-endings. And perhaps we can agree that "This water is warm," by virture of its subject-predicate form, does have a flatly assertive quality that mini- mizes the degree to which what we say about the water depends on variable con- ditions, and that it suggests that the water's warmth is a more or less durable attribute people would no more disagree about than they would about the round- ness of a clock's face. Certainly we can more easily imagine such a disagreement arising about the water than about the clock, and while there would be ways of settling whether or not the clock's face was round, it's hard to know what it would mean to settle the question of whether the water was warm or cold. Of course we could always measure its temperature, but that isn't what's at issue. In the event of a disagreement, we might want to revise "This water is warm" to "This water feels warm to me": this would show our realization that it might feel cold to somebody else and that it would be pointless (and even meaning- less) to go on arguing about whether it was really warm or really cold. So much for the truth that Korzybski is apparently trying to bring out in his account of the statement. But it's impor- tant to notice that his way of putting it is different from the way I have put it above. He thinks that "This water is warm" only pretends to be about the water and is really a report of a sensation or feeling, but that the subject-predicate form of the statement makes its speaker unable to see this and tricks him into literally "identifying" his sensation with something in the outside world, into "projecting" it outside of himself and imagining that the water possesses some inherent, objective warmth or coldness. This Korzybski takes to be very danger- ous. "The so-called 'mentally' ill ... pro- ject their own feelings, moods, and other structural implications on the outside world," he tells us, "and so build up delu- sions, illusions, and hallucinations, be- lieving that what is going on in them is going on outside of them" (80). But is this really a danger inherent in the form of the statement? Only for certain sorts of naive amateur philosophers, it seems to me. For while an ordinary person not in the grasp of a theory might well be ignorant of a difference in conditions that would make the water feel cold to</page><page sequence="13">GENERAL SEMANTICS AND SCIENCE OF MEANING 265 somebody else though it felt warm to him, and might pigheadedly insist that it just ,was warm because it felt warm, that would be quite different from in- sisting that the world was peopled with strange entities like Warmth, and (as Korzybski often puts it) that the water had Warmth "added" to it-that its warmth existed as a discoverable part of it. General semanticists seem wholly un- aware of this difference, and far too ready to commit the ordinary person to foolish theories most of us wouldn't dream of holding. And surely Korzybski is overstating his case when he says that "This water is warm" really doesn't say anything about the water iut is merely a report of something "going on" inside the person who speaks it, of an effect caused in him by the water. Yet one of his main justifications for abolishing the "is" of identity is his con- viction that all subject-predicate state- ments are to be treated on this model, as leading inevitably to "projection" be- cause they are really about feelings, even though they pretend to be about exter- nal objects. He asserts, for example, that "This blade of grass is green" is false in exactly the same way as "This water is warm": If we carry [our analysis] far enough, we shall discover a very intricate, yet definite, relation or complex of rela- tions between the objective blade of grass and the observer. Rays of light impinge upon the blade, are reflected from it, fall on the retina of our eye, and produce within our skins the feeling of "green" etc., an extremely complex pro- cess which has some definite structure. (62) Again we can agree that it would be stupid to think the statement implied an inherent "greenness" possessing "some sort of objective independence" (198), though again the temptation to do so doesn't seem worth worrying about. And again there might be situations in which we would instead want to say "This blade of grass looks green to me." But the differences between the two exam- ples are really more important than the similarities. Whatever "unreliability" the statement "This water is warm" may be admitted to possess arises, as we saw, from the fact that it makes the question of whether the water is warm or cold look straightforwardly resolvable, where- as there is actually something oddly "sub- jective" about the way we apply words like "warm" and "cold." Now the way something looks, like the way it feels to the touch, does depend on certain vari- able conditions. But from this it does not follow that color words like "green" have the same air of subjectivity that words like "warm" and "cold" have. Of course people sometimes do disagree about the color of an object, but except for irrelevant borderline disputes of the sort that often arise with (for example) blue-green, it makes far more sense to speak of settling a disagreement about the color of an object than it does to speak of deciding whether the water is really warm or cold. The move from "This water is warm" to "This water feels warm to me" is an admission that the disagreement is irresolvable, a stand- off; but the move from "This blade of grass is green" to "This blade of grass looks green to me" is something else al- together. For to say that something looks green is to say that it looks the way something that really is green looks to somebody who has normal color vision and is in a position to see it properly, and to do this is not to admit that the matter cannot be resolved but rather to make an explicit appeal to the stan- dards required to resolve it. We think of one set of conditions for seeing colors and applying color words as typical or standard, but are more flexible in apply- ing words like "warm" and "cold"; this is why it would seem unnatural to invoke words like "normal" and "properly" in</page><page sequence="14">266 COLLEGE ENGLISH the case of the water, while it seems per- fectly natural to do so with the blade of grass.6 So the grain of truth in Korzybski's overstated contention that "This water is warm" is an "unreliable" statement be- cause it is really about something going on inside the speaker while it purports to be about something outside of him, is that the statement, and its revised ver- sion, do not make a particularly strong appeal to any set of standard conditions; when he is dealing with statements like "This blade of grass is green" or "This blade of grass looks green to me," which do make such an appeal, even this grain of truth vanishes. Furthermore, while it's not strictly accurate to say that either of the statements about the water is simply about a feeling or sensation, yet we do speak (loosely) of a "feeling of warmth" as though it were something going on inside us exactly in the sense that a pain or a feeling of nausea is, but we never speak, as Korzybski does, of "the feeling of 'green' " or of "a feeling which we express by saying, 'grass is green' " (253). What is this feeling? Is it localized like a pain or not localized, like sadness or elation? Does it only come when we see something green or can we induce it by thinking of green objects? If there were such a feeling, questions like these would be perfectly legitimate ones to ask. Yet the more of them we ask, the more absurd the contention that there is any such feeling appears. Green may of course have special feelings associated with it: it may evoke the smell of the Maine woods or make us sad about the loss of a loved one whose favorite color it was. But again it may not, and anyway experiencing such feelings is not what we mean by seeing (something) green. But of course Korzybski's talk-vague as it is-about light rays and "an ex- tremely complex process" of "some definite structure" makes it clear that such familiar associated feelings are not what he has in mind. He is thinking rather of bodily processes that can be observed and described by neurologists and physiologists, and his assumption seems to be that there is a running cor- relation between these processes and our visual experience such that scientific de- scriptions of the processes will always say more precisely the same things we say when we say what color something is or appears to be. But it is very mislead- ing to speak of such bodily processes as feelings or sensations since we simply aren't aware of them-we don't exper- ience or "have" them any more than we experience the "extremely complex pro- cess" that carries blood to the lungs. And it is simply a mistake (though a familiar one) to think that any statement about light rays or retinal images or the stimu- lation of nerve-endings will state-and state more precisely-the same fact stated by "This blade of grass is (or looks) green." It is more accurate to say that such technical statements offer explana- tions of some of the phenomena involved in the sort of situation in which the everyday statement is ordinarily used- and of course to do this involves stating quite different facts from the one stated by the everyday statement. Advances in physics and neurology over the past two hundred years have taught us a great deal about color and color vision, but they have not given the English sentence "This blade of grass is green" a meaning different from the one it had in the eighteenth century. The disadvantages of Korzybski's way with subject-predicate statements come out still more clearly in the following example: How about the term "dog"? The num- ber of individuals with which any one is 6Throughout this discussion I am indebted to Chapter VII of Professor Gilbert Ryle's book The Concept of Mind (London, 1949) and also to his essay "Sensations," most readily available in Robert J. Swartz (ed.), Perceiving, Sensing, and Knowing (Garden City, 1965), pp. 187-203.</page><page sequence="15">GENERAL SEMANTICS AND SCIENCE OF MEANING 267 directly acquainted is, by necessity, lim- ited, and usually is small. Let us imagine that someone had dealt only with good- natured "dogs," and had never been bitten by any of them. Next he sees some animal; he says, "This is a dog"; his asso- ciations (relations) do not suggest a bite; he approaches the animal and begins to play with him, and is bitten. Was the statement "this is a dog" a safe state- ment? Obviously not. He approached the animal with semantic expectations and evaluation of his verbal definition, but was bitten by the non-verbal, un- speakable objective level, which has dif- ferent characteristics. (373) Yet despite its obvious problems, "This (it) is a dog" is the statement Korzybski chooses to use in the bit of conjectured history he brings forward to justify speaking of a subject-predicate language as "a language of 'sensations' ": When our primitive ancestors were building their language, . . . they identi- fied their feelings with the outside world ... If [they] saw an animal and called it "dog" and saw another animal roughly resembling the first, [they] said, quite happily, "it is a dog," forgetting or not knowing that the objective level is un- speakable and that we deal only with absolute individuals, each one different from the other. (372) And this sort of subject-predicate state- ment, in which the "is" is followed by the indefinite article and a common noun rather than by an adjective, is the sort general semanticists most often use in showing us how to avoid "confusing levels of abstraction-confusing what is inside our heads with what is outside" (LTA 200). Yet it is very hard to see how Korzybski's objections to "a language of 'sensations' " apply to this sort of state- ment. As we saw, it is very misleading to say that statements like "This water is warm" and (still worse) "This blade of grass is green" inevitably involve pro- jecting some feeling or sensation onto the outside world and are therefore un- reliable; but with such statements, and perhaps with any in which the "is" is followed by a common perceptual adjec- tive, it is at least possible to understand the substance of Korzybski's objection. This is because his mistake again is a familiar one, with a long history. The qualities that such statements attribute to objects-sounds, smells, tastes, colors, "feels," and so on-are roughly what Locke called secondary qualities. His point was that such qualities (unlike others that he called primary or real) are "nothing in the objects themselves but powers to produce various sensations in us by their primary qualities, i.e. by the bulk, figure, texture, and motion of their insensible parts."'7 Since to de- scribe how an object sounds or smells is to say how it sounds or smells to an ob- server under certain variable conditions, it has seemed natural to many thinkers to conclude that statements that attribute secondary qualities to objects are really statements about the "sensations" of the observer; and Korzybski concluded fur- ther that the adjectives such statements normally contain refer to or name those sensations: "the events outside our skin are neither cold nor warm, green nor red, sweet nor bitter etc., but these charac- teristics are manufactured by our nervous system inside our skins, as responses only to different energy manifestations, physico-chemical processes, etc." (384). But what is the sensation or feeling we project onto the outside world when we make classificatory statements like "This is a dog"? Strange as it is to talk about "a feeling of 'green,' " it would be still stranger to talk about "a feeling of dog," or to say that just as nothing in the out- side world is really red or green, so noth- 7Essay Concerning Human Understanding, II, viii, 10.</page><page sequence="16">268 COLLEGE ENGLISH ing is really a dog or a cat. The lan- guage of Korzybski's example suggests that what the man confused with some- thing outside of him was his "verbal definition" of the term "dog"-that his mistake lay in thinking he was approach- ing his definition rather than something belonging to "the non-verbal, un-speak- able objective level." Therefore this defi- nition would seem to be the feeling Kor- zybski has in mind. Now of course we don't usually use the word "definition" to refer to a feeling or to anything remotely like a feeling, but rather to a verbal for- mulation of a word's meaning; and some- times Korzybski uses the word in this ordinary way too. But here and at other points-for example, when he tells us that the word "apple," "as it has no individual subscripts or date, is not a name for a definite object or stage of a process which are all different, but a name for a definition" (96)-he seems rather to be thinking of definitions as one species of the "happenings in [our] nervous sys- tems" (LTA 27) that words stand for and that we designate as their meanings. Now this is certainly an odd way to use the word "definition," but leaving that aside, it's still puzzling that Korzyb- ski thinks that the sort of inner happen- ing named or referred to by common nouns like "dog" is a sensation of feeling rather than an idea or mental image. With similar statements, "Mr. Miller is a Jew" for example, Hayakawa says that the thing inside our heads we are confus- ing with Mr. Miller outside is not a sen- sation but rather a "high-level abstrac- tion" (LTA203) or "notion" (LTA204). And he makes it quite clear that a com- mon noun like "dog" (or "cow," which is his example) refers to an "idea" or "concept," to "the characteristics we have abstracted as common to cow1, cow2, cow3, . cow," (LTA 178- 179), and that the kind of noun that re- fers to an individual "object of percep- tion" is not a common noun but a prop- er name-whether an ordinary one like "Bessie," a new one like "cowl," or a demonstrative like "this," which gen- eral semanticists (like many twentieth- century philosophers) treat as a special sort of proper name. Given Korzybski's terminology, this seems the obvious con- clusion; and since he takes an "object of perception" to be a sensation or feeling, it would seem that in order to be consis- tent he would have to say that common nouns refer to ideas and proper names refer to sensations.8 But by this time it should be clear that consistency is not one of Korzybski's virtues, and though there are many other confusions in his treatment of subject- predicate statements, there's no use in examining them further. For reasons of his own (which, as we shall see, have nothing to do with language or its work- ings) he is determined to assert the unre- liability of all subject-predicate state- ments; and since unreliability is closely associated in his mind with feelings, he simply concludes that all subject-predi- cate statements are really about feelings. In the case of the blade of grass, this in- volved assuming that there is a running correlation between our visual exper- ience and processes observable by the neurologist, even though such processes are in no sense the feelings or sensations 8And he often does seem to hold this view- in fact I think his conception of the relation between ordinary language and mathematics, and therefore the whole drift of his argument as I paraphrased it above, depend on his hold- ing it. That is why I attributed it to him (cf. p. 256 above) even though I could recall no place in which he had expressed it so clearly as Hayakawa does in the passage just quoted. It is only possible to criticize an argument that possesses a certain minimal degree of clarity; in setting about criticizing a writer like Korzybski it is sometimes necessary initially to provide more clarity than is actually there by deciding what intention must have lain behind the fog of words. It was also for this reason that I omitted mentioning in my paraphrase the whole notion of "a language of 'sensations,' " which seems to me to stand outside Korzybski's argument in a way I could not show at that point.</page><page sequence="17">GENERAL SEMANTICS AND SCIENCE OF MEANING 269 Korzybski's theory demands. In the case of classificatory statements that end with a common noun, it involves going a step further and assuming a correlation be- tween verbal behavior and even more mysterious inner processes, such that whenever someone uses (or perhaps hears or thinks of) a word like "dog," a particular idea or mental image or defini- tion is hauled up and placed before the eye of his mind. It goes without saying that there is not a scrap of scientific evi- dence for any such correlation. Nor could there possibly be. The gen- eral mistake about the origin and nature of language that lies behind this mass of confusions and self-contradictions, and behind Korzybski's recommendation about the "is" of identity and his view that a language of subject-predicate statements necessarily "deals with enti- ties inside our skin" (384), is the idea that words acquire meaning by being at- tached like labels to inner experiences. As the sentence I quoted from Locke back on page 262 suggests, this idea has often been advanced in conjunction with the conventionalist myth. Not only for Locke but for Hobbes and Hume as well, the origin of language is roughly the same two-stage process as for Korzybski: first we affix words to men- tal images or ideas that have been ob- tained by abstraction from sense exper- ience; then we agree to use the same word as the "mark" or "sign" of similar ideas. Now one of the triumphs of twen- tieth-century analytic philosophy has been to show the dangers of thinking that there is one relation that must hold between a meaningfully used word and some extralinguistic entity that we des- ignate as the word's meaning, and that this relation is the one we often speak of indiscriminately as naming or referring to or symbolizing or standing for.9 In addition, Korzybski's (and Locke's) par- ticular way of courting these dangers, by specifying that the entities in question are sensations or mental images (rather than physical objects, say), has its own special difficulties. The greatest of these is that such inner experiences cannot be produced for public inspection. How then can we ever be sure that someone else is using a word to refer to an idea similar to the one we use it to refer to? Of course he can describe or explain his idea, but only by using more words, each of which will raise the same question and so lead to an infinite regress. It's important to understand that our inability to produce sensations or men- tal images for inspection is not due to a mere practical difficulty-as, for example, the inability to produce bits of one's heart for inspection is-but rather to a logical impossibility. For by definition nothing we would speak of as a sensation or a mental image could also be spoken of as ever being made accessible to anyone but the person having it-not even to a brain- surgeon or neurosurgeon, who may see a great deal else but does not see these things. Therefore, if it were true that words acquired their meaning by becom- ing attached to such inner experiences, it would be logically impossible not only to explain communication but even to know if it ever took place, or even if there was a public world for it to take place about.1' We saw that the conventionalist 9Some good recent essays on this matter are Professor Ryle's "The Theory of Meaning," in C. A. Mace (ed.), British Philosophy in the Mid-Century (London, 1957), pp. 239-264; the late J. L. Austin's "The Meaning of a Word," reprinted in his Philosophical Papers (Oxford, 1961), pp. 23-43; Professor Black's "Explana- tions of Meaning," reprinted in his Models and Metaphors (Ithaca, 1962), pp. 17-25; and W. P. Alston's "The Quest for Meanings," Mind, LXXII (1963), 79-87. The historical back- ground of the position more or less shared by these essays is touched on by Professor Ryle and explained at length in two excellent little books, J. O. Urmson's Philosophical Analysis (Oxford, 1956) and G. J. Warnock's English Philosophy Since 1900 (Oxford, 1958). 1oHere I am indebted to Chapter II of Antony Flew, Hume's Philosophy of Belief (London, 1961).</page><page sequence="18">270 COLLEGE ENGLISH account of the origin of language is in- adequate even if we assume that words stand for physical objects like books or semanticists;1" we can now see that its inadequacies are only compounded if we assume that "The meanings of words are . . in US" (LTA 314) rather than out in the world. But there is an important difference between Korzybski and the earlier phi- losophers I mentiorned above. Faced with the problem of showing how we ever get outside our private realms, they often just wave their theory of meaning aside and flatly assert not only the existence of a public world but also the possibilities of gaining real knowledge about it and of communicating that knowledge to others. Sometimes Korzybski takes an equally rough-and-ready way out by simply lumping ideas and mental images together with words as "higher order abstrac- tions," and then telling us that such ab- stractions are "capable of being transmit- ted" (280), that they can be "recorded in books" (291), and that their "main importance" is "in their public character" (280). But while we do often speak of someone transmitting his ideas to others or recording them in books, when we do so we are speaking colloquially and are not using "idea" in the technical sense of "mental image." What we see on the page, after all, is the author's words, not his mental images. But Korzybski has another, more elab- orate route to the outside world: science. In what is perhaps his most concrete gen- eral specification of the way of talking we should adopt once we have dispensed with subject-predicate statements and the "is" of identity, he writes: If we use a language of adjectives and subject-predicate forms pertaining to "sense" impressions, we are using a lan- guage which deals with entities inside our skin and characteristics entirely non- existent in the outside world. Thus the events outside our skin are neither cold nor warm, green nor red, sweet nor bit- ter etc., but these characteristics are manufactured by our nervous system in- side our skins, as responses only to dif- ferent energy manifestations, physico- chemical processes, etc. When we use such terms, we are dealing with charac- teristics which are absent in the external world, and build up an anthropomorphic and delusional world non-similar in structure to the world around us. Not so if we use a language of order, relations, or structure, which can be applied to sub-microscopic events, to objective levels, to semantic levels, and which can also be expressed in words. (384) Unlike Locke, Korzybski here seems to be assuming that just ordinary words, not all words, refer to subjective inner experiences. If we don't use ordinary words for qualities and objects, but talk about them instead in "a language of order, relations, or structure" as "re- sponses only to different energy mani- festations, physico-chemical processes, etc.," then we will have escaped the nar- row circuit of our own sensations and will be talking about external reality. But if this way out is more elaborate, it is no more satisfactory, for as Professor Black has shown, it only involves Korzybski in further contradictions and confusions: The characteristics ascribed to the scien- tific object, energy, electric and magnetic 11As Chase and Hayakawa sometimes do, when (probably under the influence of Ogden and Richards' The Meaning of Meaning) they lapse from Korzybski's "neurological attitude toward 'meaning'" (22). These lapses occur more often in Chase, who follows Ogden and Richards in using the term "referent" to mean "the object or situation in the real world to which the word or label refers" (TW 9) and accepts their view that "The point of every discussion is to find the referent" (TW 100). Chase even noticed and reported that "find the referent" was "a phrase which Korzybski did not like to use" (PW 147), but he doesn't seem to have understood why.</page><page sequence="19">GENERAL SEMANTICS AND SCIENCE OF MEANING 271 charge, and so on, are by no means ex- perienced directly at what Korzybski calls the "unspeakable" level. They are, on the contrary, defined in terms of complicated manipulations of scientific instruments and calculated with the help of theoretical physics of a very high de- gree of abstractness. Now if we should assert, with Korzybski, that all abstrac- tions are "manufactured by the nervous system" we should be compelled to say also that the "mad dance of electrons" constituting the scientific object is like- wise manufactured by the nervous sys- tem. . . . The reason for giving a superior status to the scientific object-for refer- ring to it as a reality and to the series of abstractions emanating from it as shadows-was its alleged independence of what went on "inside our skins"; the swarm of electrons, unlike the abstrac- tions derived from it, was not manufac- tured by the nervous system. If it be granted, however, that the scientific ob- ject, also, is a complex of abstract charac- teristics, the original basis for differen- tiation between reality and subjective abstractions disappears.12 Furthermore, from a practical stand- point it's so obviously impossible for us all to go around all of the time talking about ultimate particles and energy man- ifestations rather than about brown tables and red apples, that not even Korzybski can quite bring himself to suggest we try it. The extreme vagueness of the specific alternatives he does sug- gest makes it clear, in fact, that by "a language of order, relations, or structure" he merely means a language possessing these terms, and that by speaking such a language he merely means using the terms now and then-he doesn't much care how we use them or what particular assertions we make with them. And so his persistent faith in the wonders that will "automatically" be wrought by "the habitual use of a few new terms" (63) is really nothing more nor less than a singularly pure example of that primitive "belief in word-magic" he and his fol- lowers are so fond of finding everywhere but in their own work and that of recent scientists and social scientists, a belief Hayakawa aptly defines as "the notion that, by saying things repeatedly or in specified ceremonial ways, we can cast a spell over the future and force events to turn out the way we said they would" (LTA 109-110). Most of the time, however, general semanticists don't even offer us an al- ternative, and most of the time, as in Korzybski's example about the dog, the real difficulty doesn't seem to have any- thing to do with language. Certainly something went wrong in that example, but why blame it on the word "dog" or on the statement "This is a dog"? Since we don't always respond verbally to objects entering our field of vision, and since (other things being equal) the man presumably would have got bitten no matter what he had said or even if he had said nothing, it might be better to say that his mistake lay in deciding or infer- ring it was a dog rather than in saying any particular thing. But this seems wrong too since after all it was a dog, even if it did bite. What does Korzvbski want us to call it, if not a dog? I think Korzybski himself senses the difficulty, not only because he fails to offer any alternative term or statement but also because he suggests that the real cause of the trouble was not the words the man used but rather his "associations" with the term "dog" and the "expecta- tions" it raised in him. This seems right enough, but then it looks like what Korzvbski is trying to bring about is not a change in the structure of our language as a whole but merely a change in our "associations" and "expectations," in the degree of knowledge or awareness with which we use certain words or expres- sions. This is not surprising when we re- call that the end to be achieved by re- 12Language and Philosophy, pp. 240-241.</page><page sequence="20">272 COLLEGE ENGLISH vising our language was in fact a new state of awareness, "consciousness of abstracting." But Korzvbski's theory of meaning, by asserting that words either stand for or actually are ideas or sensa- tions, leads him to confuse language with knowledge, and to assume that the man who got bitten was asserting (with in- evitable falsity) the completeness of his knowledge about dogs merely because he used the word "dog" in a subject- predicate statement. The relation be- tween these two very different sorts of change never emerges clearly in Korzybski, nor does it in Chase and Hayakawa, who sidestep the issue by putting almost all of their emphasis on achieving consciousness of abstracting and merely pay lip service to the idea that we should revise the structure of our language. As with the idea that lan- guage was instituted by agreement, this difference between Korzybski and his popularizers is probably due to the fact that they are more interested in practice and less in theory than he is: for while changing people's attitudes or associa- tions is certainly not always easy, it's less absurdly ambitious than trying to change the structure of English. Hayakawa, as we have seen, makes a certain sense of the index numbers by reducing them to mere mnemonic devices -though of course saying to ourselves "Cowl is not cow2" accomplishes nothing that is not accomplished more naturally by saying "Bessie and Daisy are (two different) cows" (v.LTA 176). In the same way he reduces and inter- nalizes Korzybski's other major recom- mendation to a warning that we "beware of the word 'is,' which, when not used simply as an auxiliary verb ('he is com- ing'), can"-but by implication need not- "crystallize misevaluations" (LTA 315). To see the difference we need only put this against Korzybski's firm insistence that we "must abandon permanently the use of the 'is' of identity" (60) because it "always introduces false evaluation" (374). And Hayakawa's objection to the statement "Mr. Miller is a Jew" is merely that "Jew" is only one of thousands upon thousands of abstractions which may be applied to Mr. Miller, to whom such terms as "left-hander," "parent," "ama- teur golfer," "history teacher," "teeto- taler," "Bostonian," and so on may pos- sibly be equally applied. But the prej- udiced person is unaware of all but the one abstraction-perhaps in most contexts the least relevant one-"Jew." (LTA 203) Presumably after we are aware of what else Mr. Miller is, there is nothing wrong with saying "Mr. Miller is a Jew." But if that's true, then there never was any- thing wrong with the statement itself- any more than with "This is a dog"-but only with the ways in which our "asso- ciations" with the term "Jew" might have encouraged us to act on the state- ment. What we can see in Hayakawa's treat- ment of the two recommendations we can see elsewhere as well: Korzybski's popularizers manage to make sense of his idea of linguistic revision only by trans- lating it into terms that have nothing to do with language but only with knowl- edge or awareness. High-level abstrac- tions are the most suspect and dangerous sort of linguistic expression for the gen- eral semanticist, yet Hayakawa sensibly tells us there is nothing wrong with using them provided we know what we're talking about: The test of abstractions then is not whether they are "high-" or "low-level" abstractions, but whether they are refer- able to lower levels. If one makes a statement about "culinary arts in Amer- ica," one should be able to refer the statement down the abstraction ladder to particulars of American restaurants, American domestic science, American techniques of food preservation, down</page><page sequence="21">GENERAL SEMANTICS AND SCIENCE OF MEANING 273 to Mrs. Levin in her kitchen. (LTA 187- 188) Similarly, Chase writes: Adaml says: "I don't like Harvard University. I wouldn't send my boy there." The statement is meaningless as it stands. What is it you do not like, Mr. Adam? ... What things? In what place? When? If Adam1 made a list of those charac- teristics of Harvard in 1938 which he did like and another of those which he did not like, and found the second more im- pressive, he might properly say that so far as he knew the circumstances, there were more characteristics of which he disapproved than there were that he ap- proved. Or he might say that a single negative factor outweighed in his mind a large number of positive factors. He could shorten this to "I don't like Harvard," provided he were fully con- scious of the abstraction, or short cut, taken. (TW 92) But how can the statement "I don't like Harvard (University)" be "meaningless as it stands" and yet become meaningful if the person who makes it has good rea- sons for doing so? If the statement were genuinely meaningless, how could you ever gather good reasons for it or know what questions to ask another person to find out whether or not he had such reasons? Since the statement itself under- goes no change, it would be more accu- rate to say that it's vague or unclear as it stands. The fact is that Korzybski's theories about language and the structure of lan- guage make no sense when taken liter- ally, and hig grand design of linguistic revision boils down in practice to the helpful (if obvious) rule of thumb that we should always know what we're talking about and be prepared to back up our statements with appropriate and con- vincing examples. But of course we don't need science to tell us what common sense told us long ago, and whatever pre- tensions general semantics has to being a science of meaning depend rather on the truth or falsity of the description it offers of the nature of language and of the relations between language and the world. Since the description is extremely confused and at points even self-contra- dictory, the pretensions are (to say the least) unfulfilled. But it is not enough merely to show that Korzybski's theories about language are untenable and that his attempt to create a science of meaning is therefore a failure, for after all his stress was, as Hayakawa tells us, "on education and mental hygiene" (SSP 113), on the bene- ficial ethical and social results that would be achieved by applying his theories. To his credit, Korzybski would never have defended theories he recognized as untenable merely on the ground that they seemed to produce desirable results, but I have heard general semanticists argue in this way and so it seems worth- while also to examine the suitability of the theories to the aims Korzybski thought they would accomplish. I will try to show that in addition to being un- tenable in themselves, Korzybski's theories inhibit and even discourage the accomplishment of his social aims. We have seen that Korzybski's recom- mendations about changing the structure of language only make sense when they are translated into recommendations about changing people's knowledge or awareness, and that his confused theory of meaning helps to blur the distinction between these two very different enter- prises. What we must now ask is whether the specific change in awareness he wants to bring about, the change that would result in universal "consciousness of ab- stracting," would in turn bring about the further change in people's behavior demanded for the accomplishment of his social aims. Now from the sort of</page><page sequence="22">274 COLLEGE ENGLISH subject-predicate statements he and his followers most often choose as examples -"This boy is lazy," "Joe is a radical," "She is bad," "Mr. Miller is a Jew," and so on-it's clear that the change in be- havior they want to bring about is a change in the direction of tolerance and open-mindedness. And I think the real reason Korzybski mounts his attack on subject-predicate statements-the reason I referred to earlier (page 268) as having nothing to do with language-is that narrow-minded people often fix obses- sively on one character trait or one fact about another person's history and refuse to take anything else into account. This fact led Korzybski to suspect that there must be something wrong with the kind of statement we usually use to categorize people or objects and to attribute quali- ties to them, and to conclude that what he calls subject-predicate statements al- ways have, by virtue of their form alone and regardless of content or context, the blind finality they have when a bigot uses them to voice a prejudice. Therefore he insisted that "x is (a) y" really means "x is a y and nothing else" or "x is com- pletely y" or (most generally) "x is iden- tical with y-ness." We have seen the ab- surdity of the theories he constructed to justify this conclusion, and now that we see the motives behind them, we must not let our sympathy with those motives lead us to forget the theories' absurdity. When people categorize rigidly, they often do seem to be attributing a myster- ious potency to words or slogans, but this fact does not allow us to place so much of the blame for human frailty on language. Whatever makes a bigot a bigot, it isn't language, and the fact that we often react rigidly or mechanically to the world has no more to do with the structure of English (or any other lan- guage) than not knowing dogs sometimes bite had to do with the form of the state- ment "This is a dog." But what if we grant this and then go on to ask whether consciousness of ab- stracting-a simultaneous awareness of similarities and differences in our exper- ience-would, however achieved, neces- sarily produce the desired tolerance? Look again at Hayakawa's treatment of the statement "Mr. Miller is a Jew." We have seen that after we are aware of what else Mr. Miller is, of all the respects in which he is similar to and different from other people, there is nothing wrong with the statement itself. Now suppose we tried Hayakawa's argu- ments on a "prejudiced person," point- ing out to him all the other abstractions that could be applied to Mr. Miller, but that he patiently replied as follows: "Of course I know all that: if I were getting up a baseball team I might be interested in his being a left-hander, and if I were organizing a chapter of the Parent- Teacher Association I might be inter- ested in his being a parent; but as it hap- pens, I am interested in keeping Jews out of the neighborhood because they lower property values, and so I am only inter- ested in the fact that he's a Jew." If he knew his general semantics, he might even cite Hayakawa to the effect that "What we call things and where we draw the line between one class of things and another depend upon the interests we have" because classification "is sim- ply a reflection of social convenience and necessity" (LTA 215, 217). Or he might refer to Chase's remark that if "a single negative factor outweighed . . . a large number of positive factors" (TW 92) in the mind of the man who didn't like Harvard, then there was nothing wrong with his saying (and presumably acting on) "I don't like Harvard": by analogy, what can possibly be wrong with saying (and acting on) "I don't like Jews" if you have carefully decided that for rea- sons of "social convenience and neces- sity" the one negative factor outweighs all the others? Now to reply, as Hayakawa suggests, that "'Jew' is perhaps one of the most sloppily constructed abstractions in the</page><page sequence="23">GENERAL SEMANTICS AND SCIENCE OF MEANING 275 language-that is, one of the most diffi- cult to refer systematically . . to lower levels" (LTA 203), is obviously no an- swer at all. For if classificatory systems are arbitrary and words have no mean- ing in themselves, our anti-semite could very easily cooperate with like-minded neighbors in setting up a precise and workable definition, just as the Nazis did in the thirties. Nor would it do to fall back on talking about "survival value." Imagine yourself having a drink on a spacious terrace somewhere in suburban Connecticut and trying to convince your host, a well-heeled New York corpora- tion executive, that by belonging to a restricted country club he was apprecia- bly damaging his chances of survival! Or imagine yourself arguing for Negro voting rights with a rural Southern poli- tician who knew perfectly well that at least his political (if not his physical) survival depended precisely on his keep- ing the racist sentiments of his constitu- ents stirred up. It seems not only that there is nothing wrong with the state- ment "Mr. Miller is a Jew," but that there is not even anything wrong with the bigoted attitudes and actions that sometimes accompany such statements. What are we to do? The answer we want to give, of course, and that Chase and Hayakawa would give if their theories allowed them to, is that a prej- udiced person is an unconditionally bad thing to be-not because being one will involve you in using sloppily constructed abstractions or will decrease your chances of survival, but simply because your actions will probably be unjust and may have bad effects on the lives of other people. Chase does at one point ob- serve that "Korzybski, in his semantic analysis, often indicates a standard of judgment which we have long associated with toleration toward our fellow crea- tures and kindness in our treatment of them," but he feels compelled to add im- mediately (with a show of tough- mindedness and "science") that Korzyb- ski "adopts this standard not because he is inspired with 'love for humanity,' but because it is the conclusion which the facts seem to warrant" (TW 78-79). Leaving aside the question of whether or not it would be such a bad thing simply to be "inspired with 'love for human- ity,' " one wants to ask just what facts Chase has in mind-the fact that nothing is identical with anything else? As we've seen, if all classificatory systems are strictly neutral and can be justified purely by their usefulness, it needn't concern an anti-semite that "Jew1 is not Jew2" any more than it concerns those of us not interested in birdwatching that "Evening grosbeak, is not evening gros- beak2," for the simple fact of an object's uniqueness tells us absolutely nothing about how we ought to behave towards the object. An intelligent anti-semite would undoubtedly be well aware that by saying "Mr. Miller is a Jew" he wasn't denying that every Jew is dif- ferent from every other (and indeed from everything else in the universe) any more than he was confusing Mr. Miller with a word or sensation or mental image. And once he had demonstrated his recog- nition of this, and had explained that he was merely saying that the one respect in which Mr. Miller was like other Jews was enough to make him objectionable, it's difficult to imagine what more Korzybski's theories would entitle Hay- akawa to say in reply. This would seem a serious drawback if you are interested in promoting tolerance and open- mindedness; just how serious it is will become clear if we see how Hayakawa deals with an actual social issue-perhaps the most important one of our time. In an essay called "The Fully Func- tioning Personality" he quotes approv- ingly from the psychologist A. H. Maslow: One does not complain about water be- cause it is wet, nor about rocks because they are hard.... As the child looks out</page><page sequence="24">276 COLLEGE ENGLISH upon the world with wide, uncritical and innocent eyes, simply noting and observing what is the case, without either arguing the matter or demanding that it be otherwise, so does the self- actualizing person look upon human nature both in himself and others. (Quoted SSP 64) And in another essay, "The Self-Image and Intercultural Understanding, Or How To Be Sane Though Negro," he recommends this attitude to Negroes. After recounting all the areas "at the level of facts" in which "it can be said that the fight for desegregation, and therefore equality, has already been won" (SSP 74), he concludes that "progress is inevitable" and that "Negroes simply cannot lose" (SSP 87). If this seems diffi- cult to realize, that's only because, "at the level of words, white Southerners are writing the same kind of speeches they have uttered for the past twenty years" and "the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the Negro newspapers and the Negro spokesmen . . . continue to give the same angry speeches and write the same fiery editorials that they have for the past twenty years" (SSP 79). In Hayakawa's view, Negroes should learn instead "to forget as far as possible that [they are] Negro" (SSP 77), to "[take] equality for granted" (SSP 80), and to "act as the white man's psychotherapist" (SSP 82): Why get angry with these poor, igno- rant, sick people who are trying to be friendly? Why not give them a C-minus for effort and forget it?. . . If you ex- pect too much of them-if you expect all white people to be intelligent and sensible on the subject of Negroes-you will be running into daily disappoint- ments. If, however, your expectations are realistic-in other words, if you ex- pect four out of five white persons to be pretty ignorant on the subject-then you will be delighted when the score for a given day turns out to be only three out of five. (SSP 80-81) This advice evidently follows from Korzybski's principle that "minimum expectation" is "the basis of happi- ness,"13 which Hayakawa illustrates by the following anecdote: Years ago I used to notice the differ- ences among motormen on the Indiana Avenue streetcar line in Chicago-a street often blocked by badly parked cars and huge trailer trucks backing into ware- houses and maneuvering in everybody's way. Some motormen seemed to expect to be able to drive down Indiana Avenue without interruption. Every time they got blocked, they would get steamed up with rage, clang their bells and lean out of their cars to shout at the truck drivers. At the end of a day these motormen must have been nervous wrecks; I can imagine them coming home at the end of a day, jittery and hypersensitive, a menace to their wives and children. Other motormen, however, seemed to expect Indiana Avenue to be heavily blocked-a realistic expectation, because it usually was. They could sit and wait for minutes without impatience, calmly whistling a tune, cleaning their finger- nails, or writing their reports. In other words, confronting the same objective situation, some motormen lived a hellish life of anger and nervous tension; other motormen had a nice, relaxing job, with plenty of time for rest. (SSP 81) I had better admit at once that I find this offensive. Why should Negroes have to forget they are Negroes? And why should Negroes unwilling merely to look 13Cf. "In life, numerous serious 'hurts' occur precisely because we do not appreciate some natural shortcomings and expect too much. Expecting too much leads to very harmful semantic shocks, disappointments, suspicions, fears, hopelessness, helplessness, pessimism, etc." (472)</page><page sequence="25">GENERAL SEMANTICS AND SCIENCE OF MEANING 277 "out upon the world with wide, uncriti- cal and innocent eyes" and to keep their expectations minimal be compared to Hayakawa's admittedly irrational motor- men? Isn't there a difference between expecting to be treated decently and expecting "to be able to drive down Indiana Avenue without interruption" ? And on top of settling for so little, why should Negroes be forced to take on the additional burden of being "the white man's psychotherapist"? I would not blame a Negro for regarding this as an invitation to a new and more subtle kind of servitude. Of course nothing could be further from Hayakawa's intent, but it's both puzzling and disturbing that this offensive advice should come from so candid and decent a man. More important, Hayakawa's argu- ment would probably seem puzzling (if not disturbing) even to a racist. What would puzzle him, I think, is that Haya- kawa is clearly in favor of the gains Negroes have made in achieving social and political equality, and yet he classes the militant speeches that were instru- mental in achieving those gains together with the speeches of white Southerners intent on preventing their achievement, and recommends that Negroes stop being militant and adopt an attitude of uncriti- cal passivity. The Negro leaders who for twenty years have had "their attention fixed on how much farther there [was] to go rather than on how far we have come" seem to him just as unrealistic as the white Southerners who have been de- fending "the unalterable traditions of the South" (SSP 79), and just as irrelevant to whatever progress Negroes have made and will continue to make in the future. "Times are changing ... At the level of facts," he tells us, while "At the level of words, .. thing [sic] sound pretty much the same as they did twenty years ago" (SSP 78-79)-the implication being that nobody's words had anything to do with changing the facts of the Negro's situa- tion. Moreover, the analogy of the motormen seems to suggest that even the actions performed in response to some of those words-concerted, purposeful social and political actions like the stag- ing of demonstrations and the writing of letters to congressmen-had little or nothing to do with changing things. Yet Hayakawa freely admits that "Twenty years ago, . . . People really lived in a more severely segregated world then we now do in urban centers throughout the United States" (SSP 74), and so he must think something hap- pened to cause the change-but what was it? How did the fight ever get won? How and when did progress become inevitable? Perhaps the one thing the Governor of Alabama and the head of the NAACP would agree on is what Hayakawa implicitly denies: that the words of people who had "their atten- tion fixed on how much farther there [was] to go rather than how far we have come," together with the actions that accompanied and dramatized those words, had a great deal to do with win- ning the fight. For whether or not one thinks the changes Hayakawa is talking about add up to progress, it seems very odd to call them inevitable. Indeed a racist might well say that things could have been quite different, and the status quo maintained, if only Negroes had continued to expect little and to look "out upon the world with wide, un- critical and innocent eyes, simply noting and observing what is the case, without either arguing the matter or demanding that it be otherwise," for Maslow's "self-actualizing person," invested with a black skin, looks very much like the traditional image of the "good darky." For Hayakawa, however, the changes that have taken place in civil rights are the result of vast implacable forces oper- ating as physical laws operate, without the intervention of conscious human agency: "The moral sense of the nation (except in a few pockets of resistance)," he tells us, "economic conditions, tech-</page><page sequence="26">278 COLLEGE ENGLISH nological necessities, historical social forces both here and abroad, and, most importantly, the practical necessities of living together in our extremely close- knit and interdependent economy will compel"-and presumably these are what have so far compelled-"the end of en- forced segregation, both official and un- official" (SSP 87). The whole business has a curiously passive and impersonal air, and the actions Hayakawa takes as indications that the fight is won and progress inevitable are not purposeful ac- tions performed in response to anybody's words but are "wordless" and almost involuntary: At the level of facts . . hundreds of thousands of ordinary people, white and Negro, who twenty years ago used to lunch separately, are now eating together in factory lunch-rooms, school cafeterias, hamburger stands, dining cars, and other places of public refreshment. But the trouble with an uneventful lunch at which whites and Negroes manage to get down their blue-plate specials without having a riot, is that it can never get into the papers. It is, in a curious way, a wordless experience-people simply eat their lunches and pay their checks, and the national offices of neither the NAACP nor the Ku Klux Klan get any word of it. (SSP 79) Now one cause of the strangeness of Hayakawa's argument is obviously his de- termination to maintain Kozybski's strict separation between verbal and nonverbal levels, between "the level of words" and "the level of facts": the fact that no- body's words about an event are the event (which nobody would quarrel with) leads Hayakawa to imply that no- body's words had any influence on the particular events he is talking about- and that, as we have seen, is a quite different conclusion that almost every- body would want to quarrel with. More- over, in the neutrality with which he re- gards the speeches of the Negro leaders and the white Southerners-a neutrality which, as we have seen, is hard to recon- cile with his views on civil rights and which therefore seems oddly studied and artificial-I think we can see the influence of the analogy Korzybski used to express the relation between verbal and nonverbal levels once he had as- serted their separation, the analogy be- tween languages and maps. The most obvious reason the analogy appealed to Korzybski is that he took map-making as a sort of paradigm of sci- entific activity, and therefore of sane be- havior. For him science was the accurate observation and recording of data, the making of predictions on the basis of these data, and the careful checking and rechecking of the predictions against new data; and this is of course how maps actually do get made. Once a territory has initially been mapped, the cartog- rapher's job is to keep his map up to date by observing and recording topo- graphical changes, without in any way trying to cause or prevent them, and so one implication of the analogy is that the function (or at least the main function) of language is to provide a realistic de- scription of change. This is what Haya- kawa accuses both groups of speakers of having failed to do, and what he himself is endeavoring to do by preserving a neu- trality towards them something like the objectivity with which it is proper for the cartographer to regard his territory. Now we can certainly agree that neither the Negro spokesmen nor the white Southerners have been content simply to describe the changes taking place in civil rights, and so if the analogy were an apt one, Hayakawa's objection would be well taken and his neutrality appropriate; but the strangeness of his argument leads one to suspect that his objection is not well taken and that his neutrality is in- appropriate, and therefore that the anal- ogy may not be apt. To find out whether it is or not, let's return to Kor- zybski for just a moment.</page><page sequence="27">GENERAL SEMANTICS AND SCIENCE OF MEANING 279 One of the most important and sur- prising points in the argument of Science and Sanity, as I paraphrased it above, is the point at which the map analogy en- ters, the point at which Korzybski con- cludes that because "words are not the objects which they represent, structure and structure alone, becomes the only link which connects our verbal processes with the empirical data" (59), and that therefore since "A map is not the terri- tory it represents, but, if correct, it has a similar structure to the territory," languages "must be considered only as maps" (58). Again we're quite ready to agree that words aren't identical with the objects or events we use them to talk about-indeed it's hard to under- stand just what it would mean to dis- agree and equally hard to imagine that anyone has ever done so. But why should Korzybski go on to conclude from this that languages are in some fundamental way like maps? We might be less surprised if his main point had been that just as most words "have no meaning in themselves" but "are as purely symbolic as x, y, and z" (TW54), so in making a map we can arbitrarily decide to use either crosses or dots for cities, dotted or continuous lines for rivers, and so on. For the conventionality of a map's symbols (or "vocabulary") really does make it something like a lan- guage. But of course the thing that in- terests him about maps is that an accurate one must reflect or reproduce the spatial arrangement of its territory. Now or- dinarily when we speak of the structure of a language, we mean its grammar and sound system, and of course it's impos- sible to think of these as in any way reflecting or reproducing the structure of the outside world or the nervous system or anything else. But from what we have seen of Korzybski's recom- mendations for changing the structure of English, we know that his notion of linguistic structure is quite different from this ordinary one. As my paraphrase suggested, Korzyb- ski arrives at his notion of linguistic structure by (implicitly) extending to whole languages his view that sentences have meaning by virtue of fitting or corresponding to actual or possible states of affairs-i.e., by virtue of reproducing their structures as a map reproduces the structure of its territory. This theory of sentence-meaning has been held by a good many philosophers and is capable of considerable elaboration, even though it is ultimately unsatisfactory.'4 What gives it its initial plausibility is probably that an ordinary sentence, like a map or picture, can be seen all at once and its structure can therefore be taken in at a glance; also, the sort of simple declara- tive sentence usually considered by the theory's adherents states that something is the case, and this can seem very much like what a map does when it shows Boston a certain distance from New York, say, or Texas bigger than Indiana. But in the case of whole languages the theory does not have even this initial plausibility, for we cannot see the whole of English or any other language all at once (whatever that would mean) and, more important, it seems absurd to think of a whole language as stating or assert- ing something in particular. Yet of course this is exactly what Kor- zybski is doing when he tells us that just as a meaningful sentence reflects in its structure that of some state of affairs, so "every language . . . reflects in its own structure that of the world as as- sumed by those who evolved the lan- guage" (59-60), that therefore "a lan- guage, any language, has at its bottom certain metaphysics" (89), and even that language "enslaves us" because "the structure which a language exhibits, and 14For a detailed and persuasive demonstration of its shortcomings, see E.

Urmson's book is again extremely helpful on the historical background.</page><page sequence="28">280 COLLEGE ENGLISH impresses upon us unconsciously, is automatically projected upon the world around us" (90). Thus it is on the notion that each language necessarily embodies a particular world-view that Korzybski's analogy of languages and maps depends, but from what we have seen of his efforts to prove English "a language of 'sensa- tions,' " we should now be able to see that this notion is sheer fantasy. A world- view or "metaphysics" is a body of in- terrelated assertions, but since all natural languages contain devices for negation, anything that can be asserted in a given language can just as easily-from a lin- guistic, as opposed to a cultural, point of view-be denied in it. Of course we can sometimes predict accurately what the speakers of a given language will say (or write or think) about the cause of storms, say, or how to insure a good harvest; but to make such predictions we need to know a good deal about their culture, not just their language alone. An infinite number of sentences can be formed in accordance with the rules of any given language, and if all we know about the speakers of a language is the rules of their language, we can make no predictions whatever about which of these sentences they will actually speak or write (let alone think), for a language is one thing and the verbal (let alone mental) behavior of its speakers is some- thing quite different.15 In the example about the dog, we saw that Korzybski confused knowing (how to use) a particular word with having some particular definition of it in mind or particular knowledge about what it referred to, and using the word with asserting the adequacy of one's definition or the completeness of one's knowledge; his comparison of languages to maps, and his and other people's abor- tive efforts to extract a "metaphysics" from a particular language, whether En- glish or Hopi16 or Chinese, make the same mistake on a grander scale by con- fusing knowing (how to speak) a partic- ular language with having a particular view of the world, and speaking the lan- guage with asserting the truth of the view. Like his two recommendations, then, Korzybski's analogy is the result of his having confused language with attitudes or knowledge; and just as when they try to follow his recommendations, so in trying to apply the analogy his dis- ciples translate it into a statement about knowledge rather than about language. Hayakawa, for example, introduces the analogy by telling us that "Most of our knowledge, acquired from parents, friends, schools, newspapers, books, con- versation, speeches, and television, is re- ceived verbally" (LTA 30), and it is this knowledge, not the structure of En- glish, that he tells us must function as a map of the outside world. But translation can no more salvage the analogy than it could the recommenda- tions. Why should the main goal of thinking (and presumably of speaking) be to map or describe the world as it changes? Often, particularly in the case of social or political changes, we also try to judge and perhaps to influence what is happening. Certainly that's what the white Southerners and the Negro spokes- men Hayakawa reproaches for being 15This is really the same distinction that Pro- fessor Noam Chomsky, in the course of ex- plaining how his conception of linguistics dif- fers from that of his Bloomfieldian predecessors, has so often drawn between what he calls lin- guistic competence and linguistic performance. See for example his essay "Explanatory Models in Linguistics," in E. Nagel, P. Suppes, and A. Tarski (ed.), Logic, Methodology and Philos- ophy of Science (Stanford, 1962), pp. 528-550; and Chapter I of his book Aspects of the Theory of Syntax (Cambridge, Mass., 1965). 16In mentioning Hopi I am of course think- ing of the writings of Benjamin Lee Whorf, now conveniently collected in Language, Thought, and Reality (Cambridge, Mass., 1956).

They had no intention of merely describing the changes taking place in civil rights, but rather were recommending (and at- tempting to justify) certain courses of action that would either halt or speed up those changes. Since this is often a natural (and necessary) thing to do, our appraisal of the two sorts of speakers should not depend on whether they offer us a realistic description but on whether the courses of action they recommend are morally admirable and whether their arguments are sound. After all, the fact that a change is occurring at a certain rate doesn't mean that it ought to occur at that rate or even that it ought to occur at all. Perhaps some things (like equality for Negroes) ought to come faster than they are coming, and perhaps some things (like the traditions of the South) are worth preserving and ought not to be changed. As Hayakawa's inability (or unwill- ingness) to make any distinction between the white Southerners and the Negro spokesmen makes clear, his theories give him no way of arguing questions like these, just as they gave him no way of arguing with the anti-semite that certain "factors" ought not to "outweigh" certain others in the decisions we make about our conduct. And just as Haya- kawa would have nothing further to say once the anti-semite had demonstrated his awareness that each Jew was bound to differ from everybody else in some way or other, so he'd have nothing fur- ther to say to either the white South- erners or the Negro spokesmen once they had shown their awareness of the changes actually taking place in civil rights. And this would hardly be diffi- cult for them to do; far from being un- informed about these changes, they are probably better informed about them than anyone else in the country. So despite Korzybski's intense interest in promoting social change, when his theories are applied to actual social prob- lems they tend to encourage conformity or even inaction, the self-embalmed ac- cepting passivity suggested by Maslow's definition of the self-actualizing person. Hayakawa does qualify these implica- tions by saying that "maps can be made, even though the territories they stand for are not yet actualities" (LTA 102), but I think this stretches the notion of a map so far as to deprive Korzybski's analogy of the meaning he intended it to have: after all, if the territory doesn't yet exist, what we draw is not a map but a plan or blueprint. And in fact Haya- kawa actually makes this distinction at one point: "Language is not only de- scriptive, in the sense of supplying ver- bal 'maps' of nonverbal 'territories,' " he tells us. "It is also prescriptive or direc- tive in the sense of supplying us with verbal 'blueprints' of nonverbal 'terri- tories' which we intend, through our own efforts, to bring into being" (SSP 108). But the crippling effects of the map analogy can be seen in the fact that when he comes to talk about directive language in detail, his main point is that "If it is to influence our conduct, it must make use of every affective ele- ment in language: dramatic variations in tone of voice, rhyme and rhythm, purring and snarling, words with strong affective connotations, endless repetition. If meaningless noises will move the au- dience, meaningless noises must be made; if facts move them, facts must be given; if noble ideals move them, we must make our proposals appear noble; if they will respond only to fear, we must scare them stiff" (LTA 102). For him "The impor- tant question to be asked of any direc- tive utterance is, 'Will things happen as promised if I do as I am directed to do?' " (LTA 105); there is no suggestion that quite aside from a particular goal's chances of achievement, it is often im- portant to ask (and difficult to decide) whether or not it is admirable, and whether the arguments advanced in its favor are sound.</page><page sequence="30">282 COLLEGE ENGLISH Therefore, though Hayakawa endeav- ors to reassure us that the self-actual- izing or genuinely sane person will not operate in "complete conformity with the goals . . . of [his] society" (SSP 55), he doesn't go on to say that there are better and worse reasons for being criti- cal of this or that turn of events, but instead quotes Maslow to the effect that "The fully-functioning personality can be, when the objective situation calls for it, comfortably disorderly, anarchic, vague, doubtful, uncertain, indefinite, approximate, inexact, or inaccurate" (quoted SSP 61). Since being any of these things is quite different from being intelligently critical, such lapses from conformity seem more like arbitrary holidays, taken at the bidding of some unspecified "objective situation," than like purposeful actions Jhat we perform as the result of rational decisions we have arrived at for ourselves. And so the troubling question remains: will this per- son ever be intelligently critical (or for that matter intelligently withhold criti- cism) of society, and if so, how will he learn what he needs to know in order to decide when and why and what and whether to criticize? By now it should be abundantly clear that consciousness of abstracting is not enough to produce tolerance and open- mindedness. The two complementary aspects of consciousness of abstracting- to borrow a handy pair of terms from linguistics we might call them its "syn- chronic" and "diachronic" :aspects-are an awareness of every object's unique- ness at a given moment and a continuing awareness of universal change, and we have seen that neither the fact that an object is unique nor the fact that a change is occurring has any ethical signif- icance whatever. For it is one thing to perceive the way in which a particular person or act or situation is different from or similar to others, and quite an- other to decide what course of action these similarities and differences justify and why. This is why it is always logi- cally possible for two people to be in perfect agreement about the facts of a situation and yet, without either of them contradicting himself, to reach different decisions about what ought to be done. Therefore we must disagree with Hayakawa's confident statement that "morality and ethics come naturally, as the result of proper evaluation"-i.e., of consciousness of abstracting-and that "ordinary 'moral' problems fade out of existence for sane people" (SSP 68) be- cause they are "problems we create for ourselves through lack of self-insight" (SSP 69). Surely life isn't this easy. Granted that the "problems" Hayakawa quotes Maslow as citing-"whether or not one plays cards or dances, or wears short or long dresses, exposing the head in some churches and covering it in others, drinking wine, eating some meats and not others, or eating them on some days and not others" (quoted SSP 68)- don't present much difficulty for most people, there are a great many others, usually called moral and quite real rather than self-created, that do. And it seems obvious that solving them intelligently requires more than sustained apprecia- tive contact with the flux of events. It's all very well for Hayakawa to tell us blandly that "since the map is not the territory, and since, therefore, know- ledge about an event is never the event itself, those who take this fact for granted are not uncomfortable about the fact that they don't know the answers" (SSP 61); but sometimes, when con- fronted by the important public and private questions that come up quite often for all of us, we should be un- comfortable about not knowing the an- swer, and should feel compelled to bring the full weight of our experience and our intelligence to bear in deciding which answer is best and why. But Hayakawa shows no recognition of these difficulties or of the obligation we should feel to meet them, and in fact</page><page sequence="31">GENERAL SEMANTICS AND SCIENCE OF MEANING 283 the main impression one gets from his attempts to apply Korzybski's theories is' that settling moral questions is not even a rational activity. Of course to be- lieve that it is a rational activity also in- volves believing that sometimes some answers and arguments will be better than others, and this Hayakawa is usually reluctant to acknowledge-apparently because he fears that doing so would necessarily be dogmatic or intolerant. Instead, as in the case of the white South- erners and the Negro spokesmen, he preserves a strict (and, as we saw, a rather artificial) neutrality. But his fears are unfounded. To be intolerant is to deny other people the right to answer questions for themselves and to attempt to impose our answers on them, while to be dogmatic is to refuse to test our own answers against arguments that lead to different answers. But the fact that we are all free to answer moral questions for ourselves in no way implies that all an- swers are equally good, and therefore we don't have to remain neutral in order to avoid intolerance. Nor does our sense that it is very important to find the best answers and to be able to justify them imply that we are committed to silenc- ing or persecuting people who disagree with us in order to preserve our answers against their arguments; in fact it implies precisely the opposite: that we are com- mitted to disagreeing with them, either tacitly or openly, unless we find reason to change our minds. Therefore we don't have to remain neutral in order to avoid dogmatism.17 The desirable alternative to intolerance and dogmatism is not neutrality but rather fairness or disinter- estedness, which are quite different. Since disagreements, when they come out into the open as clarifying argu- ments, are necessary to the achievement of fairness or disinterestedness, they are hardly the symptoms of cultural or per- sonal sickness that general semantics takes them to be; far from needing to be eliminated by a "theory of universal agreement," they need to be encouraged, for they are one of the main sources of a culture's life. It may seem surprising that Korzyb- ski's theories, when put into practice, banish morals from the domain of rea- son, for certainly his aim was precisely to give morals a firm footing by making it scientific. Yet in a curious way science itself is irrational for the general semanticist-it too "comes naturally" as the inevitable result of "proper evalua- tion." "Kittens and good scientists," Chase tells us, "tend to let new experi- ence pour in until some kind of work- able relationships with past experience are established" (TW 48). But as the passage I quoted from Professor Black on pp. 270-271 suggests, the wide-eyed childlike openness recommended by gen- eral semanticists as "scientific" and there- fore as conducive to sanity is in fact quite inadequate to account for theory construction in science; and once we recognize that the moral growth that we expect of adults, and that general semanticists require for the accomplish- ment of their social aims, does not "come naturally" as the result of lapsing into silent recognition that Jew1 is not Jew2 and that neither of them is today what he was yesterday, we can see that this childlike openness is just as inade- quate in morals as in science. The attain- ment of qualities like tolerance and open- mindedness requires cultivating a sense of informed disinterestedness, not merely returning to (or preserving) a state of mindless neutrality; and that cultivation requires in turn not merely data absorbed passively and wordlessly from the out- side world but standards, principles and insights that can only be arrived at by concentrated, active critical thought and argument. In morals as in science, the 17Here and elsewhere in this essay I am indebted to the account of moral reasoning given by R. M. Hare in his two books The Language of Morals (Oxford, 1952) and Free- dom and Reason (Oxford, 1963).</page><page sequence="32">284 COLLEGE ENGLISH important and interesting relationships are not mysteriously "established" for us; it is we who establish them, and we do so by the kind of thinking that both the theory and practice of general semantics tend to discourage. Therefore the faith that Korzybski and his followers place in science does not imply a faith in what we ordinarily mean by reason, but rather the opposite. "Citi- zens of a modem society need ... more than that ordinary 'common sense' which was defined by Stuart Chase as that which tells you that the world is flat," writes Hayakawa. "They need to be systematically aware of the powers and limitations of symbols, especially words, if they are to guard against being driven into complete bewilderment by the com- plexity of their semantic environment" (LTA 29-30). And Chase himself re- minds us that "in the semantic approach to abstractions there is no plea to 'think things through'-the stock retort of one dogmatist to another. 'Thinking things through' has heretofore largely meant more useless mental labor-from thought to word and back to thought again" (TW 90-91). Their faith in science-a faith I hope I have shown to be mis- placed so far as their own science of meaning is concerned-is in fact the re- sult of an extremely pessimistic view of what ordinary thinking, as practiced by that "layman" for whom Saul Bellow's Dr. Tamkin had such contempt, can ever accomplish. And this pessimism is either the cause or the effect, or perhaps both, of Korzybski's view of language. Language, we recall, is an abstraction from the ordinary world just as the or- dinary world is an abstraction from the scientific world. Since for Korzybski abstraction is merely a matter of omitting characteristics, to speak of language as an abstraction-and even worse, as an abstraction from an abstraction-is to stress its thinness and artificiality, its inability even to reflect faithfully the world as we perceive it, which of course is itself only a pale and dull reflection of the inexhaustibly rich and vivid world known to modern physics. Hence it is not surprising that general semanticists talk a great deal about the limitations of language but very little, and very uncon- vincingly, about its resources. And since thought only takes shape or actualizes itself in language, to be unaware of the resources of language is to be unaware of the resources of thought. Though Korzybski's ignorance of his- tory led him to treat this sense of the in- adequacy of language as something that he, or at least the twentieth century, had. invented, it seems to be as old as system- atic thought-probably because it is real- ly just another expression of the sense everyone who has tried to think syste- matically has, that thinking is very diffi- cult. What Professor Black has called, in another connection, "the ancient metaphysical lament that to describe is necessarily to falsify"18s is behind Kor- zybski's strange doctrine that to describe or classify an object is literally to iden- tify it-falsely of course-with the word used to describe or classify it-that (for example) the sentence "This is a pencil" is "unconditionally false to facts" be- cause it asserts that the yellow object lying there on the table is the word "pencil," and (more generally) that "Say whatever you choose about the object, and whatever you might say is not it" means exactly the same as "Whatever you might say the object 'is,' well it is not" (35). And anyone who has read Gulliver's Travels will have noticed an earlier (and more extreme) version of Korzybski's view that words ought to (but cannot) "cover" or "include all characteristics" of the objects they refer to in the view of those Laputan profes- sors who, "since words are only names for things," devised a "new scheme of s1"Linguistic Relativity: The Views of Ben- jamin Lee Whorf," Models and Metaphors, p. 248.</page><page sequence="33">GENERAL SEMANTICS AND SCIENCE OF MEANING 285 expressing themselves by things."19 Even Plato was not above having a little fun at the expense of some of his predeces- sors, who-despite the unsane, delusional, unconditionally false to fact orientation forced upon them by the Greek lan- guage-had managed to come remarkably close to one of Korzybski's pet pro- nouncements. "These wise men," Soc- rates tells us, held "that nothing is one thing, in and of itself, but is always becoming, relative to someone, and that 'is' should be completely abolished, though by habit and ignorance we have often been forced to use the word-just now for example."'20 Most of the bits and pieces of theory that Korzybski patched together to make general semantics can in fact be traced back a good deal further than he or his followers probably realized. For that matter, not even the pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo about the "mad dance of 'electrons' " was original.21 But I wouldn't want to leave the impression that there is nothing new in general semantics, for this is far from true. What is new-and what is perhaps the central paradox of Korzybski's thought -is that while he seems to be saying that language and thought are intimately and inevitably bound up with one another, he really turns out to be saying just the opposite; and while he seems to be offer- ing us a science of meaning that will help us to use language better than we do, he is really promising a way of getting out- side language and its difficulties by giv- ing us what Kenneth Burke once per- ceptively called "glimpses into an almost mystical cult of silence."22 Rather in the manner of a tent-show evangelist, Kor- zybski paints a dire picture of thought enslaved by language and men at the mercy of words, then suddenly provides a battery of theories and techniques that will "automatically" insure salvation. Finally the only real influence of lan- guage on thought turns out to be the bad influence it had before we saw the light and returned to a state of passive and uncritical contact with "the non- verbal level, where," Chase rhapsod- ically writes, "one can point but cannot utter, the very threshold where the senses make contact with the outside world" (TW 39). I think we can begin to understand the immense popularity of general se- mantics if we look closely at the way Chase describes this wordless state: This contact comes before language and cannot be spoken. The eye receives light-waves from the apple, but says nothing. This apple, any apple, any object or act, is on the nonverbal level. Here we see it as a cat sees it, quietly and without words. . . . Here is the base from which all our proud words rise-every last one of them-and to it they must constantly return and be refreshed. (TW 39) Plainly this allegorical journey that gen- eral semanticists are always inviting us to take is a return to innocence-in this case, to an Eden complete with apple. But unlike other earlier journeys of re- turn, this one will end in an innocence shared not only by "kittens" but by "good scientists" as well. By presenting scientific observation as the highest form of primal innocence, general semanticists make their evangelism sound deceptively modern and tough-minded, reassuring us of the value and accessibility of the simpler life they offer and making it easy to justify our longing for a release from what Sir Joshua Reynolds once called "the real labor of thinking." 19Book III, Chapter 6. 20Theaetetus, 157A-B. 21The most famous statement of this influen- tial and persuasive view is in Sir Arthur Edding- ton's The Nature of the Physical World (Cam- bridge, 1928); its definitive refutation is offered by L. Susan Stebbing in Philosophy and the Physicists (London, 1937). 22The Grammar of Motives (New York, 1945), p. 239.</page></plain_text>
