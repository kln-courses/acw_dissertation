Sudan: Ancient Treasures is neither the first nor the largest exhibition to be devoted to Nubian and Sudanese antiquities, but in the years since such ground-breaking exhibitions as the Brooklyn Museum's Africa in Antiquity1 and Sudan: Ancient Kingdoms of the Nile, co-organized by the Institut du monde arabe in Paris and the Kunsthalle der Hypo-Kulturstiftung in Munich,2 Sudanese archaeol- ogy has developed in several directions. With the passage of nearly 40 years, the UNESCO-spon- sored rescue work of the 1960s has come to be better analyzed and more clearly understood, and the research- led fieldwork of the late 20th century has begun to fill some of the gaps left by the necessarily hasty earlier work. The days are long gone when an archaeologist such as George Reisner could describe the history of Nubia as "hardly more than an account of its use or neglect by Egypt."3 The Sudan: Ancient Treasures exhibition at the British Museum is smaller and more compact than either of the two mentioned above, but in many respects it is just as significant. Like Ancient Nubia: Egypt's Rival in Africa, the show organized by the University of Pennsylvania in 1993,4 the London show conveys a sober but highly enthusiastic sense of Sudanese archaeology and history as a new fron- tier with many unexplored aspects, both geographically and chronologically. It is also slightly crusading in its at- tempt to provoke fresh interest in a cultural history that might be described as a sleeping giant in relation to its illustrious northern neighbors. The gilded copper-alloy statuette of a Meroitic ruler (fig. 1) that stares out from the cover of the Sudan: Ancient Trea- sures catalogue is an arresting image, but it does a disservice to the exhibition. The king's pose, his costume, and much of his iconography derive from Egypt, and although his physique and expression hint at something different, the overall impression is of a simple variation on the familiar pharaonic theme. Similarly, the Jebel Barkal pyramids be- hind him may be too small and too steeply sloped to grace the Giza plateau but are presumably there to reinforce the Egyptian flavor. The designers of the catalogue cover and posters have been unable to resist stressing the links with Egypt, and although this makes good marketing sense, it sends a message that actually contradicts one of the exhibition's intellectual tenets: that the Sudan is a diverse and distinct phenomenon in its own right, independent of its well-known Egyptian links. In Wretched Rush, Stuart Tyson Smith comments, "in the celebratory monuments of the Egyptian state, Nubia could not simply be referred to by its ancient name Kush, but must always be 'Wretched Kush.' The negative qualities of Nubian ethnicity helped to de- fine the positive qualities of Egyptian-ness."5 One of the achievements of this exhibition is that it further enhances our sense of the positive qualities of "Nubian-ness," extend- ing the process set in motion by Bill Adams in the 1970s, when he helped to promote Nubian archaeology as some- thing more than a mere subset of Egyptology.6 Subtitled "Recent Discoveries from the Sudan Nation- al Museum," this exhibition is very much a collaboration between the British Museum and the National Corpora- tion for Antiquities and Museums in Sudan. It serves a number of purposes simultaneously, including the com- memoration of the centenary of the first museum at Khartoum, the promotion of the history of Sudan to a wider audience, and the celebration of over 150 years of archaeological links between Britain and Sudan. As not- ed above, there have been two major international trav- eling exhibitions of Sudanese antiquities in the last 30 years, but neither of these visited a British venue, so the Sudan: Ancient Treasures show is the first real opportunity to promote Britain's strong contributions to the under- standing and appreciation of ancient Sudanese culture. Considering the frequency of European and American exhibitions of ancient Egyptian art and culture in recent years, the current show is an extremely belated event, which ideally should be regarded as a starting point for future exhibitions rather than the final word on the sub- ject. In my view, the quality and range of Sudan: Ancient Treasures should leave its visitors pleasantly surprised and keen for much more. The catalogue, like its illustrious predecessors,7 includes both short entries on the displayed items and longer the- matic essays by an extensive group of specialists, from Ele- 1Wenigl978. 2Wildung 1997. 3 Reisner 1910, 1:348. 4 O'Connor 1993. 5 Smith 2003, 1. 6 Most notably in Adams 1977. 7 Wenig 1978; Wildung 1997 American Journal of Archaeology 109 (2005) 81-86 81</page><page sequence="2">82 IAN SHAW [AJA109 Fig. 1.

The editors (and exhibition organizers), Derek Welsby and Julie Anderson, have assembled an extremely author- itative array of contributors, both of catalogue entries and essays, whose expertise is above all at the cutting edge of the subject, since almost all of them are currently en- gaged in field projects in Sudan. Unlike many exhibitions at the British Museum, this one is, remarkably, not at all reliant on the museum's own extensive holdings. Since all of the displayed arti- facts are drawn from the collection of the Khartoum Na- tional Museum, it effectively complements the permanent display of ancient Sudanese culture at the British Mu- seum (the Egypt and Africa gallery), which was opened in 1991. With such a wealth of material to draw on, the exhibition is able to provide both a chronological run- through and a number of thematic displays, so that visi- tors are not only given a good grounding in the basic succession of cultures but also are allowed to explore a number of specific topics such as gold mining and pot- tery production. The display on funerary culture in par- ticular provides an impressive array of material, including a well-known Meroitic tomb chapel at Sedeinga (fig. 2), which is skillfully reconstructed from a combination of actual items and photographed elements (cats. 301-304). Two overriding themes dominate this exhibition and its catalogue and contribute significantly to its success. First, the landscape of Sudan is impressively conveyed in photo- graphs that do just as much as the labels (in fact, probably more) to place the artifacts in their full cultural and envi- ronmental contexts. Second, the emphasis of the catalogue and also the design of much of the display are both geared very much towards the use of survey and excavations as tools for gaining a better understanding of culture and his- tory. This is an archaeologist's exhibition rather than an art historian's or a curator's, and I mean this both in terms of the organizers and the "audience." Even the chronological sections of the display are organized around key archaeo- logical sites, firmly placing the exhibited artifacts in their</page><page sequence="3">2005] SUDAN'S ANCIENT TREASURES 83 Fig. 2. Doorjamb of a funerary chapel from Sedeinga, Sudan. Sandstone. Kushite (Meroitic), second half of second century A.D.

Far from making this a "dry" exhibition, as one review has already suggested,8 the explicitly archaeological emphasis repeatedly helps to take us out of the museum environment and to see these ob- jects as evocations of entire cities and cemeteries, many still in the process of being surveyed and excavated. This archaeological stance is particularly apparent in the section dealing with pottery production, with catalogue entries noting, for instance, that one Neolithic basin-jar from el- Kadada (cat. 241) derives from "a grave that has been de- stroyed by a bulldozer." Most of Steffen Wenig's admirably succinct and informative entry on a Meroitic "slow potter's wheel" (cat. 224) is devoted to a discussion of its archaeo- logical context and the way in which David Edwards' re- interpretation of the object's function led to the realization that the site itself was probably a potter's workshop.9 An- other satisfyingly archaeological entry is Ann Minault-Gout's discussion of a pair of inlaid eyes from a New Kingdom cof- fin excavated on the island of Sa'i, in which it is pointed out that the survival of such eyes in a grave is sometimes "the only evidence for the presence of a wooden sarcophagus."10 Unusually perhaps, this exhibition and its catalogue are genuine showcases for new fieldwork, such as Derek Welsby's survey of the northern Dongola reach, Domin- ique Valbelle's excavations of the fascinating townsite of Dokki Gel (including sandstone talatat blocks from a temple to the Aten), a short distance to the north of Kerma, and Matthieu Honnegger's ground-breaking work at the Mesolithic settlement and cemetery of el-Barga. The essays preceding each section of the catalogue are largely pithy and concise. One of the major strengths of the exhibition is its strong focus on the prehistory of Sudan, in stark contrast to the 1978 Africa in Antiquity display, which glossed over the prehistoric cultures. Almost a third of the chrono- logical section of the catalogue is devoted to the period between the Palaeolithic and the pre-Kerma culture. This reflects the enormous strides that have been made in recent years by field archaeologists such as Jacques Reinold, Isabella Caneva, and Philip van Peer, working on a wide variety of Palaeolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic sites. As Friederike Jesse points out in his catalogue essay on the Neolithic, whereas early work on Sudanese pre- history focused on chronological issues and simple data gathering, contemporary projects address specific re- search questions such as "the introduction of domesti- cated stock, especially cattle, and the adoption of a food-producing way of life, the evolution of social com- plexity and the obvious gaps in the story, especially be- tween the end of the Neolithic period and the beginning of historic times."11 The objects chosen for the exhibi- tion to highlight and illustrate these research questions are often imaginative, such as the fragments of a giraffe skull associated with "Khartoum Mesolithic" pottery (ca. 6000 B.C., cat. 36), which demonstrate environmental change in the Ennedi Erg region, and the pre-Kerma sandstone combs (cat. 48) used to decorate the surfaces of clay vessels, which appears to indicate high social es- teem for pottery producers, who included combs of this type in their funerary assemblages. One crucial missing element in the prehistoric section of the exhibition is any real indication of the rich rock art of the region, which could perhaps have been included in the form of photographs (the Sudan: Ancient Kingdoms of the Nile ex- hibition included two actual fragments of rock art from the collection of the Agyptisches Museum in Berlin).12 The coverage is also strong at the other end of the chro- nological scale. Whereas the 1993 and 1997 exhibitions both stopped at the end of the Meroitic period (and even 8 W.

A.D. 640), the British Museum show carries on almost until modern times, even including a 19th-century suit of chain mail and helmet to illustrate the armies of the Mahdist state, finally defeated by Kitchener in 1898. About a fifth of the catalogue is devoted to this post-Meroitic material, which effectively makes this exhibition a visual updating of Adams' Nubia: Corridor to Africa, the first monograph to encompass the whole prehis- tory and history of Sudan. Among the important ingredi- ents in this post-Meroitic section of the exhibition are the artifacts from Lenoble's excavations at el-Hobagi in the 1990s that have done so much to rewrite the cultural his- tory of the period following the end of the Meroitic phase of the Kushite Kingdom, in which continuities can now be seen to have eclipsed the traditional narrative based on the idea of a general descent into barbarism. Similarly, the pho- tographs and objects from Edwards' excavation of Gabati in 1993-1994 document within a single cemetery the crucial period of transition from post-Meroitic "pagan" culture to the early "Christian" period. What are the highlights of this exhibition? For me, some of the most intimate and emotive pieces are among the smallest: the stone and ivory Mesolithic lip-plugs that are relatively rare in prehistoric Egypt (cat. 16a-e) and the bizarrely poignant dried gerbil from a pre-Kerma stor- age pit (cat. 53). But there are also aesthetically pleasing objects to rival those of any other culture, including the iconic Neolithic caliciform beakers from Kadruka (cats. 22 and 271; fig. 3), and two female anthropomorphic figurines (cats. 272-273; fig. 4), also from Kadruka, which have the same kind of simple abstract grace as Cycladic figurines. Much later - and at a considerably larger scale - the bark stand from the Temple of Amun at Naga (cat. 159) is a physical evocation of the confidence with which Meroitic sculptors transformed Egyptian traditional ico- nography and metaphor into a new artistic language of enormous freshness and vigor. Probably the most tanta- lizing and enigmatic object in the exhibition is the Meroitic stele of Queen Amanishakheto from the Temple of Amun at Naga, whose back and sides are inscribed with 15 lines of cursive Meroitic (fig. 5); sadly, the text's script is so poorly understood that other than representing a hymn its meaning remains elusive. A further enigma is that the queen represented on the stele appears to have donated the slab to a temple supposedly not yet founded at the time of her reign. The exhibition's archaeological core is stressed in a final section dealing with the Merowe Dam archaeologi- cal salvage project. Just as the 1978 Africa in Antiquity exhibition emerged from the long shadow cast by the High Dam at Aswan and Lake Nasser, so, conversely, the current exhibition includes a reminder that Sudanese archaeology is once more threatened by flooding - this time in the form of Sudan's own hydrological project, which will create a reservoir covering a 170-km stretch of the Nile between Merowe and Abu Hamed (about a third of the Nile Valley, between the fourth and fifth cata- Fig. 3. Caliciform beaker. Ceramic. Neolithic, 3610-3392 B.C. (Photograph courtesy of Sudan National Museum) racts). The project is scheduled to be completed by late 2008, thus instigating the current series of archaeologi- cal rescue projects, some of which have already been underway for several years. The British Museum exhibi- tion has become part of the attempt to publicize the need for further urgent work in this region. Inevitably, as in Egypt, the principal ancient settle- ments, cemeteries, and sacred sites of Sudan have tended to duster near the Nile Valley or along the coast of the Red Sea, but one of the most noticeable aspects of this exhibition is the lack of material from western and south- ern Sudan. Vivian Davies' foreword to the catalogue points out that Sudan's total area of two and a half million square kilometers makes it the largest country in Africa, and if there is one thing that this exhibition highlights, it is the traditional focus of archaeological work in one com- paratively small part of this vast country and the relative dearth of material from such vast areas as Darfur and the Wadi Howar (although there are around a dozen artifacts included from the latter region) . As David Edwards puts it in his thought-provoking recent survey of Sudanese archaeology, "over the long term, when looking at the archaeology and history of the Sudan, there are clearly many regional histories and archaeologies, not only those of the better-known riverine core."13 After the resettlement of Sudanese Nubians, which began in 1964, it became apparent that some 2-3,000 13Edwards2004,3.</page><page sequence="5">2005] SUDAN'S ANCIENT TREASURES 85 Fig. 4. Female anthropomorphic figurines. Veined Nubian sandstone. Neolithic, second half of fifth millennium B.C. (Photograph courtesy of Sudan National Museum) Nubians had remained in Nubia, despite the imminent flooding of much of the territory. In 1970 more than 2,000 people lived in the rebuilt Wadi Haifa (a few kilo- meters to the southeast of Old Wadi Haifa), in 1974 there were 6,000, and by 1984 about 10,000. These Sudanese Nubians resisting resettlement adopted the slogan: "The sand of Wadi Haifa is better than the wheat of Khashim el-Girba (New Haifa)." One of the British newspaper re- views of this exhibition suggested that the use of the term "treasures" in the title was rather "optimistic,"14 but Welsby and Anderson's achievement is to demonstrate that there is a great deal more to the "sand of Wadi Hal- fa" than meets the eye. The many problems of late 20th-century Sudan have been caused by a number of factors, from the flooding of the northernmost part of the country by Lake Nasser (and the consequent enforced resettlement of Nubians) to famine and the civil war in southern Sudan, and more recently the ethnic and racial conflict in the Darfur re- gion. The specters of famine and the north-south civil war may have been rapidly succeeded by the still-enfold- ing Darfur tragedy, but this exhibition permits us to view Fig. 5.

(Photograph courtesy of Sudan National Museum) Sudan more optimistically as a cultural and ethnic phe- nomenon with deep roots that extend not only into the far past but also in several geographical and ethnic direc- tions. Through archaeology we can see how the Sudanese region has continually embraced many disparate envi- ronments and ways of life.
