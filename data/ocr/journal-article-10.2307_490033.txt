<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Few Words About AIDS Helena Michie Thinking AIDS: The Social Response to the Biological Threat By Mary Catherine Bateson and Richard Goldsby Addison- Wesley Publishing Company, 1988 And the Band Played On: Politics, People, and the AIDS Epidemic By Randy Shilts St. Martin's Press, 1987 AIDS and Its Metaphors By Susan Sontag Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1988 While researchers try to find a cure for AIDS, our culture, like cultures around the world, is struggling to find a way to talk-or not to talk-about the disease, its prevention, and its consequences. The name AIDS, which describes not so much a disease as a condition which allows various diseases to take root and to flourish in the human body, was itself for a long time (as the history of AIDS research goes) a matter of much debate. AIDS came slowly into American popular discourse as a series of euphemisms, acronyms, and colloquialisms: GRID (gay-related immune deficiency), ACIDS (acquired community immune deficiency syndrome; the "community" here and in the name CAIDS is a euphemism for "gay"), "gay cancer," "gay plague," etc. All the terms are marked by the effort to name or not to name the syndrome's group of origin in the US-sexually active, urban gay men-and by the struggle to say or not to say the word "gay." Words are also a tremendous issue in the fight against AIDS; we, as a culture, have been challenged by the spread of AIDS to use words that the culture has designated as taboo, or at least as inappropriate to say to ourselves, to our sexual part- ners, in front of children, in public: "condom," "homosexual," "anal sex," "heroin." Indeed, safe (or safer, as the word "safe" itself has become fraught with danger) sex has largely been presented as a matter of words; conservatives tell us to "just say no," while the more liberal approach exhorts us to talk things over with potential sexual partners, offering a candid history of our sexual pasts and preferences. If all epidemics, and indeed all tragedies, offer us a new lexicon, AIDS gives a special place to the power of language. This is partly because language shapes education and po- litical persuasion, both cornerstones of what is usually termed- to Susan Sontag's discomfort-the "fight" against AIDS. We have, in addition to a series of newly coined words and images, a new lexicon, a new cultural iconography: the AIDS quilt inscribed with the names of AIDS victims, "safe sex" pamphlets and kits passed out in many college mailboxes, plays, stories, and poems about AIDS patients, their friends, families, and communities. AIDS has also given new verbal power to homo-</page><page sequence="2">American Literary History 329 phobes and racists; we see this power not only on the editorial and op-ed pages of distinguished newspapers, but on bathroom walls and sprayed across lockers of schoolchildren diagnosed with AIDS or as HIV positive. AIDS is itself not immune from the cultural and lexical fate of other tragedies: just as there are John Kennedy jokes and Challenger jokes, so too are there jokes about AIDS. AIDS jokes, however, are the product of an all- too-easy coupling of the defensive genre of the joke about trage- dies and the functionally offensive ethnic joke which triumphs over the pain of a self-defined "other" or group of others. The other side of all this communication, all these words about AIDS, is silence: the long, sinister silence of the Reagan administration about the AIDS crisis, Reagan's own refusal to use the word until hundreds of thousands of people had died. Silence also operates at a more local level, as people convinced that AIDS could never happen to them treat its lexicon as so many foreign words. AIDS clearly needs to be spoken about; the silence clearly must be broken. But how and with what words? The three books under consideration here all implicitly answer that question in different ways. All address themselves to a lay public; all attempt to bring AIDS into the psychic vocabulary of their readers. Each makes a different choice about how that happens; each tells the story of AIDS in a different way. I use the word "story" here because all three books are implicitly bound up in a perceived choice between narrative and nonnarrative modes of talking about AIDS; two of them, Sontag's AIDS and Its Metaphors and Bateson and Goldsby's Thinking AIDS, explicitly resist narrative. At the beginning of AIDS and Its Metaphors, Sontag re- views the choices she made in her earlier landmark study of disease and cultural representation, Illness as Metaphor: We, as a culture, have been challenged by the spread of AIDS to use words that the culture has designated as ta- boo, or at least as inap- propriate to say to our- selves, to our sexual partners, in front of children, in public: "condom," "homosex- ual, "anal sex," "her- oin." I didn't think it would be useful--and I wanted to be use- ful-to tell yet one more story of how someone learned that he or she had cancer, wept, struggled, was comforted, suffered, took courage ... though mine was also that story. A narrative, it seemed to me, would be less useful than an idea. For narrative pleasure I would appeal to other writ- ers.... (13) By implication, this second book on illness and metaphor is also a book with an idea, a book that resists telling the story of victimization, resists reinscribing that story in the telling. Again referring to her earlier book, Sontag explains, "The purpose of</page><page sequence="3">330 A Few Words About AIDS my book was to calm the imagination, not to incite it. Not to confer meaning, which is the traditional purpose of literary endeavor, but to deprive something of meaning .. ." (14). Narrative, that elided possibility, that counterstrategy against which Sontag chooses to write, is doubly aligned here with pleasure and with a sort of painful excitement. "Idea" and "narrative," "idea" and the "literary endeavor" stand opposed to each other in an almost Platonic relation, where history and fact calm and refresh while literature leads to a sort of unnatural excitement. Bateson and Goldsby carry this relation even fur- ther, choosing "to put less emphasis on the horrors of full-blown AIDS and more emphasis on social adaptations to controlling the virus that causes it, for we write out of a conviction that horror is not the best place to begin in constructing individual and social change. Horror creates the impulse to denial" (5). Sontag's "pleasure" and "excitement" are oddly close to Bateson and Goldsby's "horror"; for two books which begin with the premise that AIDS must be talked about realistically (Bateson and Goldsby) and even unmetaphorically (Sontag), there is something potentially odd about an analytical frame which promises to avoid what many would-perhaps naively, but certainly instinctively-feel to be the "real" experience of AIDS. Although it is certainly not clear that one should only write about AIDS within the conventions of narrative, it is interesting that both studies begin with similar gestures of an- tinarrative recoil that take the form of recoil against recording the symptoms of the disease and the day-to-day bodily and institutional concerns of those who suffer from it. This oppo- sition between "idea" and "narrative," always troubling from a theoretical point of view, is rendered more acutely problematic when the rejection of narrative involves the choice not to rep- resent the lives of people and groups--in this case homosexual men, the poor, and intravenous drug users-who traditionally have been denied access to political and/or textual represen- tation. The recoil from narrative detail can too easily be read as a recoil from those people around whom narratives about AIDS most frequently accrue. In contrast to the first two books, Randy Shilts's And the Band Played On is unabashedly narrative, taking its mixed and capacious form from the journal, the newspaper article, the modernist stream-of-consciousness meditation, and the nine- teenth-century multiplot novel. The book swarms with what can only be called characters: AIDS patients, their lovers and friends, scientists, politicians, bureaucrats, writers. Almost every character is granted subjectivity in the form of interior mono-</page><page sequence="4">American Literary History 331 logues, as each individual story is interpenetrated with hundreds of others in a pattern so dense one needs to keep referring to the "Dramatis Personae" Shilts provides at the beginning of the book. And the Band Played On feeds off of narrative conven- tions of identification and suspense: we see Bill Kraus, one of the book's many "heroes," move from a seventies-style gay liberationist and local politico, to an early safe-sex advocate and national figure, to a victim of the syndrome he was one of the first to take seriously as a threat to gay communities across the country. The sense throughout the book that even he might finally become a victim of AIDS culminates in a dramatic scene about two-thirds of the way through where Kraus, working out in the gym, spots the telltale purplish mark of Kaposi's sarcoma on his leg. The scene provides the book with a novelistic te- leology, one which has led readers all along to look for such marks, such spots, such symptoms on the bodies of their favorite "characters." Shilts's book certainly dwells on and in the nar- rative "horror" that Thinking AIDS and AIDS and Its Meta- phors find useless or dangerous. Even scientific discoveries are presented narratively, often as the unfolding consciousness of a particular person whose relation to science, to the institution in which he or she works, and often to AIDS patients and to politics, is explored. In offering us glimpses into the interiority of his cast of characters, some long dead, Shilts simultaneously produces and undermines the reality effect of his text; perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he chooses realism over verisimilitude, a literary effect-of-the-real over an illusion of journalistic accuracy. This is not to say that And the Band Played On is inaccurate, but simply that its choice of the nar- rative, indeed, its novelistic mode, makes for the representation of a different kind of truth. Thinking AIDS, on the other hand, moves almost imme- diately from the particular to the general; as the word "thinking" in the title implies--one can imagine different possible verb phrases here, including "living with AIDS," now the title of a special issue of the journal Daedalus, or even "thinking about AIDS," which would somehow imply less confidence-it is time perhaps to stop (only) feeling and to start thinking. The book alternates between examinations of the syndrome itself and the social reaction to the syndrome; it ends with a series of carefully worded policy suggestions that would certainly seem radical to the current administration and to the culture in general: political rights for gays-including and especially the legitimation of gay marriage-and legalized and medically supervised "shooting galleries" for drug addicts.</page><page sequence="5">332 A Few Words About AIDS What interests me here, however, are not Bateson and Goldsby's political conclusions, but the way they use language- and in particular analogy and metaphor-to reach those con- clusions. As Susan Sontag explains in AIDS and Its Metaphors, metaphors are themselves political acts; neither the choice to use metaphor in the first place nor a specific choice of metaphors is or can be politically neutral, and Bateson and Goldsby have set up a complex and at times profoundly disturbing metaphoric structure to their arguments which bears unraveling. Bateson and Goldsby's use of metaphor seems to come out of, and to a certain extent, to be coextensive with, a profound humanism at the heart of their work on AIDS. Their admirable political goals seem to be including culturally marginalized groups into the human community and transforming abstract, perhaps even horrifying, concepts into human terms. This is worked out rhetorically in two linked ways: first, by the repeated anthropomorphizing of AIDS and in particular of the AIDS virus, and, second, by the repeated contention, implicit and explicit, that gay men are not significantly different from those whom the media have so problematically labeled "the general population." Likeness replaces unlikeness as political and rhe- torical strategies in Thinking AIDS; metaphor and analogy, of course, aptly implement such strategies for both, unlike nar- rative, which tends to focus on the particular, emphasize like- ness-in-difference. The anthropomorphizing of the AIDS virus and of bio- logical processes in general includes attributing a certain agency to them; AIDS is a matter of "ambitious pathogens" (17); it is "elegant"; it "throws certain characteristics of society into re- lief' (1). At times--and here, as I will discuss later, the famil- iarization and domestication of gay men and the anthropo- morphizing of biological processes come together-the individual cells act out a parody of stereotypical gay male be- havior: "Both immune cells and invading cells circulate in search of some appropriate significant other to bond to-and, like some human beings in such a search, they respond primarily to ex- ternals..." (30). The heavily loaded language, particularly "sig- nificant other," simultaneously humanizes bodily processes and points towards what is almost a complete absence in the book: a description of sexual behaviors that can lead quickly to the spread of AIDS. Typically, Bateson and Goldsby will move to the human and to the anthropomorphic at the end of a paragraph that contains a scientific piece of information about nonhuman be- havior. Two examples should suffice. At the end of a long</page><page sequence="6">American Literary History 333 paragraph on the spread of pathogens from one species and from one ecological niche to another, Bateson and Goldsby conclude: "species that destroy their own environments cannot themselves survive. This has implications for human behavior as well as for understanding the mechanisms of diseases in which one organism lives in the body of another" (13). And, a little later on, at the end of a discussion of exponential growth of AIDS and of exponential growth in general, they conclude in human and in ontological terms: "The cancer patient dies; the overpopulated petri dish runs out of medium and is poisoned with wastes; and our planet cannot support the unlimited growth of the human population.. ." (20). These forays into the idiom of the human are often very helpful, both in terms of explaining a difficult abstract concept and in making it less abstract and more emotionally compelling; the main thrust of the move- ment, however, is in line with the embedded political project of the book: its stress on likeness between people and between the human and the nonhuman. Similarity becomes the idiom and metaphor, the figure for the book's relatively few references to the group at the historical center of the spread and study of AIDS in the US-homosexual men. Part of the book's mission seems to be the inclusion of gay men into a human and humane community; it repeatedly does this in a problematic way: by eliding difference in favor of what becomes not so much a tolerant as a homogenizing vision of culture. This strategy permeates the metaphoric struc- ture of their discussion, especially in their repeated use of the marriage metaphor to describe acts of interpersonal compro- mise. For example, in discussing the need for flexibility in the treatment and understanding of AIDS, Bateson and Goldsby come up with the following somewhat mysterious and culturally loaded formulation: "Living with AIDS is a little like applying Kant's categorical imperative- acting as if your behavior were to become a rule for the whole society, affecting you as well as others. It's also somewhat like a version of the Golden Rule worked out to apply to many situations, like marriage, in which the parties are necessarily different" (102). While on one level a celebration of difference, this passage uses the marriage metaphor as a way of connecting with its (presumedly) heterosexual reader; marriage works rhetorically here to contain difference, and difference itself becomes safely located within heterosexual cultural arrangements. The force of the marriage metaphor, appearing like so many of Bateson and Goldsby's connective gestures in the strategically powerful final sentence of a paragraph, is such that it retroactively</page><page sequence="7">334 A Few Words About AIDS strengthens a phrase in the previous sentence. The mention of "a rule for a whole society" might strike us now not merely as an exhortation to exemplary human behavior but as a way of limiting human variation. Bateson and Goldsby assert the pow- er of the marriage metaphor even more emphatically by ap- plying it directly to behavior which some would see as politically at odds with it; they use the term "marriage" to familiarize, for a heterosexual reading audience, the sexual practices of urban gay men at the peak of the sexual liberationist movement: "Sex became an expression of unity and solidarity in the gay com- munity, linking hundreds of men to each other, much as it links couples in happy marriages" (44). Here the marriage metaphor is used explicitly to flatten cultural, political, and sexual differ- ences between gay men and mainstream culture. That Bateson and Goldsby use the lexicon of marriage in this way testifies both to the political power of marriage and to the rhetorical power of metaphor. By seeing marriage itself as likeness-in- difference, Bateson and Goldsby domesticate difference; by us- ing the marital metaphor, they embed that domestication in a powerful and compelling rhetorical practice. There are obvious political advantages to seeing gay men as not so very different from anyone else. Certainly the col- lapsing of differences can lead to a more tolerant notion of people designated for whatever reason as "other"; de-empha- sizing difference is one of the strategies commonly used by members of gay communities all over the world. The assimi- lationist argument has a familiar shape; it is an important voice in the internal debates of any marginalized or oppressed group. But in choosing sameness over difference as their strategy and idiom, Bateson and Goldsby resist the possibility that a reader unfamiliar with gay culture will learn about other experiential categories, other ways of life. The book's refusal of this possi- bility seems to me to be intimately tied up with its refusal of narrative, for narrative would, after all, engage in a level of specificity which would disrupt what we might call the happy marriage between the tenor and the vehicle of their marriage metaphor. Bateson and Goldsby's political program, which has at its center the recognition of marriage, seems implicated in their rhetorical decisions. While gay marriage should be part of any program of gay rights, the assumption of its centrality to gay male experience in the US seems to me both historically inaccurate and potentially dangerous. Of the three books under consideration, Bateson and Goldsby's seems the most interested in educating a lay public. That this public seems to take on some of the characteristics</page><page sequence="8">American Literary History 335 of the mainstream media's "general population"-in other words, it is defined not only by its relative lack of scientific expertise, but also by its presumed heterosexuality-is probably not in itself a bad thing. Certainly gay men have historically had other sources for learning about AIDS. There is a point, however, beyond which an assumption of sameness will not allow one to go, or, in the lexicon of the book's title, to "think" about AIDS. If we as a culture are to learn anything about AIDS, surely we must confront difference as well as similarity. Bateson and Goldsby's reliance on a relatively complacent no- tion of sameness reminds me of the rhetorical structure of the recent "We Are the World" campaign against hunger in the Third World. While it is important to realize and to come genuinely to believe in the humanity of people from different cultures, it is also important not to assume that their perceived likeness to a hegemonic "we" is what makes them human in the first place. In choosing likeness over difference, Bateson and Goldsby come perilously close to constructing such a "we" and such a criterion for inclusion in the human race. If Thinking AIDS comes down on the side of sameness and avoids narrative partly for its implication in the idiom of dif- ference, And the Band Played On repeatedly negotiates same- ness and difference while implicitly acknowledging them as po- litical categories. Shilts's book is probably addressed to an audience different from the other two under consideration here; Shilts tries simultaneously to address the gay community and a heterosexual audience. First, he challenges and complicates the idea of "gay community"; the book begins with schematic opposition between a highly politicized community in San Fran- cisco and a far less coherent and politically aware community in New York. This opposition is itself undermined as Shilts exposes for the "general" as well as for the gay reader splits within each group over, for example, the closing of gay bath- houses, or, earlier on, the existence of AIDS in the first place. This airing of difference is dangerous material; oppressed groups always have a stake in at least the appearance of unity before their oppressors. Shilts's treatment of what some might think of as "dirty laundry" is, however, very careful. While he exposes difference(s) within gay communities, the structure of his book, with its chronological movement between characters and his- torical moments, emphasizes linkage, progress, the communi- cation of knowledge, disease, and affection, to name just a few things that travel along the complex network of human relations Shilts sets up for us. And the Band Played On moves not only in the spaces</page><page sequence="9">336 A Few Words About AIDS between people, but also between inside and outside, between public issues and interiority. His technique of juxtaposed in- terior monologues which characterizes much of the book also plays with the conflict between sameness and difference, gath- ering strength from each paradigm. While his narrative tech- nique emphasizes the accretion of specific detail, it also em- phasizes the permeability of boundaries between characters within his text and between reader and character. By entering with equal confidence the minds of the living and the dead- of doctors, mainstream politicians, and gay activists of a variety of political and sexual persuasions-he forces the reader out of a single position and into the unfamiliar and, in some cases, the unpalatable. Perhaps the most eloquent example of Shilts's technique is his handling of Gaetan Dugas, the infamous "patient zero" of AIDS research who stubbornly and flamboyantly resisted his doctors' and his friends' advice and continued to have multiple sexual encounters long after he was diagnosed with what was then called "gay cancer." Shilts opens the chapter "Dirty Se- crets" by offering the reader a scene of Gaetan confronting his own reflection: Gaetan Dugas examined himself closely in the steamy mir- ror of San Francisco's most popular bathhouse. He had always been looking for someone, he thought. As a child he had searched for his mother, not the woman who had brought him up in Quebec city, but his real mother. As soon as he was old enough to understand that he had been adopted into that rough-hewn life of the French-Canadian working class, he had dreamed of the day he would meet his true mother. He knew he was meant to be bor into a better life, far from the brawny bullies who called him a faggot and rubbed snow in his face during those bitter Canadian winters.... When he did finally meet his natural mother, he told a friend they fought. She wouldn't say who his father was and she didn't seem like a princess, and suddenly Gaetan had stopped talking about searching for his parents. Anyway, he had found his own niche in the royalty of gay beauty, as a star of the homosexual jet set. (196) Like the narrator of many great nineteenth-century realist nov- els, Shilts slips in and out of a series of textual positions; the narrative voice is by turns Gaetan's, the journalist's who pre- sumably interviewed Gaetan's friends, and a voice which may</page><page sequence="10">American Literary History 337 or may not be Gaetan's that connects between his childhood dreams of royal birth and his position within the gay male elite. The reader has almost no choice but to follow the narrative into the mind of a man who, Shilts reports later, made a habit of crowing over his anonymous partners after he had sex with them, telling them they would probably catch his "cancer" and die. The canonical gesture towards Gaetan's childhood is the sign of a biographer, a sociologist, an expert; Shilts's narrator is all of these as well as Gaetan himself. In giving readers access to so many different positions in their encounters with individ- ual characters and in series of characters, Shilts makes sure that every reader, from whatever political and sexual point of view, meets and recognizes difference; likewise, every reader is forced into at least an uneasy, shifting identification with the charac- ters, which in turn underscores their humanity. The sprawl and energy of Shilts's book, with its nearly compulsive attention to detail, makes for a strange contrast with AIDS and Its Metaphors. Once again, sameness and dif- ference, narrative and nonnarrative come into play, but this time in what appears to be another world. What is initially most striking about Sontag's book is its sameness: its evenness of tone and its almost eerie similarity to her landmark study, Illness as Metaphor. The first few chapters of AIDS and Its Metaphors- and it is by no means a long book-are filled with reiterations of positions from Illness as Metaphor. In resisting metaphor Sontag has, it seems, countered with another problematic rhe- torical device: self-quotation and self-paraphrase. From the first sentence whose past tense recalls Sontag's earlier work-"By metaphor I meant nothing more or less than the most succinct definition I know .. ." (my italics)-to her repetition of argu- ments from Illness as Metaphor about military language, to her stories about how she came to write the earlier book, we are constantly reminded of the presence of Sontag's first published thoughts on the language of disease. My objections to the echoes heard so consistently in this book do not come, primarily, from a sense that the book is unoriginal, or from indignation that readers are not being provided with new material. What seems most problematic, indeed almost sinister, about the similarity between Sontag's two books is precisely that she has not allowed AIDS to change any of her categories, that she has absorbed AIDS into already existing categories of language and belief. The world after AIDS is surprisingly similar to the world before its emergence on the medical and political scene. Sontag sees in the disease only affirmations of positions she has already taken. In the context of stasis and repetition, Sontag's desire to</page><page sequence="11">338 A Few Words About AIDS stay away from narrative seems unfortunate. New information, "new" diseases, new situations make for new stories and new stories for new ideas. Indeed, it is impossible to separate new stories from new ideas. While I do not want to suggest that narrative can cure theoretical, political, or rhetorical problems, much less AIDS, these texts teach us to be suspicious of the repeated rejection of the narrative mode and the linked structure and idiom of sameness.</page></plain_text>
