CHAMBERLAIN [NOTE. - Authors, especially those whose articles appear in journals and other serials not entirely devoted to anthropology, will greatly aid this department of the American Anthropologist by sending directly to Dr A. F. Chamberlain, Clark University, Worcester, Massachusetts, U. S. A., reprints or copies of such studies as they may desire to have noticed in these pages. - EDITOR.] GENERAL Adachi (B.) Processus parietalis squamae temporalis. (Z. f. Morph. u. Anthrop., Stuttgart, 1907, x, 485-8.) The pecu- liarity studied by A. was found in 5 out of Io European and in 37 out of 70 Japan- ese skulls, and is common in the anthro- poids. The variation in size and form is considerable. Andree (R.) Ethnologische Betrachtungen iiber Hockerbestattung. (Korr.-BI1. d. D. Ges. f. Anthr., Brnschwg., 1907, XXXVIII, I35-7.) Resume of a mono- graph, appearing in the Archiv fiur An- thropologie, and noticed in the American Anthropologist, 1908, N. S., X, I45. Balfour (H.) The friction-drum. (J. R. Anthr. Inst., Lond., 19o7, xxxvti, 67- 92, 3 pl., 7 fg.) Treats of the origin, nature, and geographical distribution of the " friction drum" (the representative among American children is a tin or pasteboard cylinder with drum-head of parchment, etc., with string and rosined twirling stick), Dutch rommelZot (known in Europe early in 17th century), Ger- man Waldteufel, French cri de la belle mdre, Italian pan-bomba, Spanish zam- bomba, English hummer, etc., Venezuelan furuco, Marotse morupa, Baluba tam- bue, Wanika muanza, etc., and related devices. In the New World the " fric- tion drum" seems of foreign origin (Afri- ca; western Europe, France more re- cently). European forms are not of local origin. The type with a friction- stick probably came into Europe from W. Africa by way of the early Portu- guese or Dutch traders; the friction- string type may be of Indian origin (South Indian tavalaikd), though possi- bly also African. The rubbing-stick type may likewise be African. All varieties are carefully described and figured. The variety common in eastern United States a few years ago was similar to fg. 7 in B.'s list.

(Z. f. d. Erforschg. u. Behandlg. d. jugendl. Schwachsinns, Jena, I9o8, 139-60.) R6sum6s briefly the literature (125 titles) of the anthro- pology of degeneration, etc. (degenera- tive stigmata of criminals, genius, etc.; infantilism; mongoloidism ; finger-prints ; defects of brain; cretinism ; microceph- aly ; abnormal ears ; steatopygy ; poly- mastia; vagabondage; prostitution; pal- mar sulci and folds; abnormalities of palate ; orbital peculiarities ; cranial ca- pacity; morphology of finger-nails; form of sole of foot; teeth; body- and head- measurements; tattooing; cerebral asym- metry; brain-weight; "degeneration- signs"; mammary anomalies; peculiari- ties of the hair; dwarfism, etc.). Among the more notable items of this period are: Teixeiara Basto's A tatuagem nos criminosos (Porto, 1903), G. Buschan's Gehirn und Cultur (Wiesbaden, 1906), V. Galippe's L'he~rditM des stigmates de dtginMrescence et les familles souver- aines (Paris, 1905), etc. Courty (G.) Sur les petroglyphes h. tra- vers le monde. (Bull. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1907, ve S., VIII, 153-62.) Treats briefly of petroglyphs at the Lac des Merveilles in the Maritime Alps, thought by some to be the work of idle shepherds; at the sources of the Bou- Merzoug in southeastern Constantine (Algeria) ; in the Canary ids., in Mor- occo, the Sahara, etc.; in various parts of America and Australia; in Brittany, Seine-et-Oise, etc., in France. C. sees in petroglyphs the origin of many of the Chinese characters, and considers petro- glyphs in general "Ithe first manifesta- tions of human thought." van Ginneken (J.) Untersuchung iiber die Typologie der Sprachen. Enqukte sur la Typologie des langues. (Anthro- pos, Salzburg, 1907, II, 690-705.) Ger- man-French article on the typology of language, "Ithe aim of which is to explain, in a comparative and general manner, the genesis and the development of all the details of each language in phonetics, morphology, vocabulary, syntax, stylis- tics, by making use of all historical data concerning the peculiarities, the charac- ter, etc., of each people." Attempts along this line were made by W. von Humboldt with his Innere Sprachformn; Steinthal; Byrne in his General Prin- ciples of the Structure of Language (London, 1885), whose work was made use of by von der Gabelentz and Count von der Schulenburg (1895) ; H. C. C. von der Gabelentz, in his Sprachwis- sensthaft, ihre Aufgaben, MIethoden und bisher igen Ergebnisse (Leipzig, 1891) ; F. N. Finck, in his Der Sprachbau als Ausdruck deutscher lWeltanschauung (Marburg, 1899) and Die K/assiikation der Sprachen (o190). Also Jespersen in his Growth and Structure of the Eng- lish Language (Leipzig, 1905), K. Bergmann in his Die Sprachliche An- schauung und Ausdruckweise der Fran- zosen (Freiburg i. B., 1905), O. Weise in his Unsere Muttersprache, ihr Wesen und ihr Wert, etc. The author appeals for a series of scientific sketches of the characters of peoples, corresponding to the grammars of their language. Giuffrida-Ruggeri (V.) 11 pithecanthro- pus erectus e l'origine della specie umana. (Rev. di Scienza, Bologna, 1907, II, re- pr. 9 pp.) Treats of the Pithecan/hro- pus of Dubois and its relation to the ori- gin of the human species, the theories of Klaatsch. G.-R. concludes that an an- cestral form of man probably existed in the Tertiary period--" a being at the end of the Tertiary, a precursor of man, not yet well differentiated, through show- ing ' higher' characteristics." The an- thropoids are a divergent line, the Pitheci another autonomous line, and the Pithe- canthropus the result of a distinct evo- lution, begun at a much lower level. The "monophyletic tree" of Haeckel does not exist for the primates. In many things the anthropoids are near man, in others far from him. It has not been proved, e. g., that extremely long arms are at all in the line of man's genealogy. The American monkeys (the Ateles especially) have preserved a num- ber of ancient characters common also to man (relation of weight of brain and body, curve of skull, carrying of head, gait, etc.). Herv6 (G.) Montesquieu : 1' ethnographie dan "L'Esprit des Lois; la th6orie des climats. (R. tc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1907, xvII, 337-353.) Discusses the ethnographic material in Montesquieu's L'Esprit des Lois (Paris, 1748) particu- larly the theory of climate set forth in the second chapter of his fourteenth book - "Combien les hommes sont diff6rents dans les divers climats," a theory whose "physiology is quite naive and amusing.'"</page><page sequence="6">308 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., IO, 1908 Slavery, e. g., is a mere matter of warm climate; liberty belongs only in cold countries. Hoesch-Ernst (L.) Vorschlag zur besseren Erhaltung der Skelette. (Korr.-B1. d. D. Ges. f. Anthr., Brnschwg., 1907, XXXVIII, 121-4.) Proposes "ossua- ries," in which the bones of the dead (after the flesh has been stripped off, burned, and placed in urns if desired) may be stored, with labels indicating name, etc., to be used, when necessary, by the physician, the anthropologist, etc. This would enable science to take ad- vantage of a vast amount of material now wasted, and contribute much to the study of heredity, pathology, etc. Holcombe (C.) Oriental ethics compared with Western systems. (Int. J. Ethics, Lond., 1907, xvIII, 168-81.) Treatsof Confucius and Laotze and their ethics-- "the chief secret of the marvelous suc- cess, a success that has made the Chinese in some respects the most moral people in the world, is to be found mainly in the methods adopted to inculcate it." Lapicque (L.) Tableau g6n6ral des poids somatique et enc6phalique dans les es- p&amp;ces animales. (Bull. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1907, ve S., VIII, 248-70.) Presents a table, constructed on a loga- rithmic scale of body and brain weights in the animal series- the abscissa is the logarithm of the body-weight, and the or- dinate the logarithm of the brain-weight. In this scheme related species are dis- posed along parallel lines, each natural group, e. g., Felide?, having its isoneu- ral line. This corresponds to the alge- braic expression of Dubois for the mam- mals in general. - Le poids enc6phalique en fonction du poids corporel entre individus d' une m me esp&amp;ce. (Ibid., 313-45-) Treats of the law in question with regard to the dog, squirrel, man; cerebral regression in do- mestic animals (rabbit, hare, ruminants, birds, etc.); sexual differences of brain- weight in man. The body and brain- weights of man and woman stand in the same relation to each other as do two dis- tinct animal species of the same nervous organization. In all species of animals domestication has had the effect of dim- inishing the relative brain-weight. Lehmann (J.) Systematik und geograph- ische Verbreitungen der Geflechtsarten, mit einem Anhang: Die hauptsatchlichs- ten Arten von Knoten. (Abh. u. Ber. d. K. Zool. u. Anthr.-Ethn. Mus. zu Dresden, 1907, xI, Nr. 3, 1-35, 3 pl., 195 fg.) First part treats of the various sorts of weave, their technique, nomen- clature, etc., and their geographical dis- tribution. Each variety of weave is in- dicated by a formula. Half-weaves and over-weaves are considered. Fig. I8, e. g., in Mason's Aboriginal American Basketry, corresponding to fig. 69 in Leh- mann, is VIB b *. Liebreich (R.) L'asym6trie de la figure et son origine. (C.-R. Acad. d. Sci., Paris, 1908, cxLVI, 593-7, 3 fg.) From an examination of more than 5,400 an- cient and modern skulls, including 400 Egyptian mummies and numerous living subjects, L. concludes that asymmetry is not, as Lombroso holds, a stigma, a mal- formation, a sign of degeneration, but "the normal form of the human face." It originates in the last period of intra- uterine life, from the position of the em- bryo. Facial asymmetry is "a conse- quence, a necessary accompaniment of the vertical posture of man, and is thus one of the distinct marks of the species." Marangoni (M. E.) Ricerche sul perone. (A. p. l'Antrop., Firenze, 1907, xxxvI, 305-20, 7 fg.) Gives results (details of measurements, etc.) of examination of the fibula in 112 long-bones of both sexes and numerous races--64 Italians, 23 American Indians - with description and figures of transverse section. The great- est development of the fibula in the ani- mal series occurs in man, due to the pres- ence of the very strong muscles necessary to maintain the erect position. The fib- ula is not curved or in correspondence with the tibia; when curvature in the fib- ula occurs it tends rather to be antagon- istic. Among the bones studied were those of three Tuscan giants. Martin (R.) System der (physischen) Anthropologie und anthropologische Bibliographie. (Korr.-Bl. d. D. Ges. f. Anthr., Brnschwg., 1907, xxxvIII, 105 -19.) Discusses various schemes of classification of anthropological science, particulary those of Broca, Topinard, E. Schmidt, and outlines his own classifica- tion, with library rubrics after the Dewey system, - I. General (physical) anthro- pology; II. Special or systematic (physi- cal) anthropology, including A, Soma- tology; B, Morphology ; c, Physiology ; D, Pathology. III, Anthropogeography. Meinhof (C.) Warum studiert man primi- tive Sprachen?

Mollison (T.) Einigeneuelnstrumentezur Messung von Winkeln und Kriimmungen. (Z. f. Morph. u. Anthrop., Stuttgart, 1907, x, 489-99.) Describes new instru- ments for measuring angles and curves - goniometer, horizontal-holder, cyclom- eter, etc. Miihsam (-) Die biologische Differen- zierung von Affenarten und menschlichen Rassen durch spezifische Blutreaktion. (Z. f. Ethn., Berlin, 1907, XXXIX, 706- 7.) R6sum6s briefly the investigations of Carl Bruck (cf. Berl. klin. Wochen- schr., Nr. 26) on specific blood-reaction as a biological differentiation of anthro- poid and human races. Myres (J. L.) A bureau of biometry. (Oxf. and Cambr. Rev., Lond., 1907, I, no. I, 131-44.) Argues for the reg- istry of the ancestry and descendance of students, anthropometric data, psychic qualities; achievements at the university and in after-life, etc. Such a bureau on a voluntary basis is urged as of great evolutional value. Neuhauss (R.) Ueber neuere photo- graphische Hilfsmittel fiir den For- schungsreisenden. (Z. f. Ethn., Berlin, 1907, xxxIx, 966-72.) Treats of the photographic equipment of the modern investigator. Both a stand and a hand camera are needed. Plates are preferred over films. Flashlights and kinemato- graphs are advisable. Oppenheim (Frl. St.) Die Suturen des menschlichen Schiidels in ihrer anthro- pologischen Bedeutung. (Korr.-Bl. d. D. Ges. f. Anthr., Brnschwg., 1907, xxxvIII, 128-35, 9 fg.) R6sum6s re- sults of examination, by means of a suture- scheme, of 460 skulls in the museums of Ziirich and Paris (Swiss, Papuans, New Caledonians, Maori, deformed Peruvi- ans, Berbers, Burmese, Battak, Chinese, children's skulls of various races, patho- logical, i. e. microcephalic and hydro- cephalic skulls). The Swiss and Ber- bers have the most complicated sutures, the Chinese the simplest. The simpler coronal suture is generally typical for dolichocephalic skulls, as is the more complicated for brachycephalic. Micro- cephalic and hydrocephalic skulls have very complicated sutures. Miss O. di- vides each of the three sutures, coronal, sagittal, and lambdoid, into three sec- tions; she also makes a " suture index." Regnault (F.) A propos de la morpho- g6nie osseuse. (B. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1907, ve s., viII, 304-5.) Reply to critique of M. Papillault. The mech- anical theory is not "a mere valueless hypothesis." Rutot (A.) Un grave probl~me. Une industrie humaine datant de l'6poque oligoc6ne. Comparison des outils avec ceux des Tasmaniens actuels. (Bull. Soc. Belge de G6ol., etc., Bruxelles, 1907, extr., pp. 1-46, 64 fg.) Treats of the eoliths discovered by M. de Munck in a sand-pit on the main road from Tilff to Boncelles, and compares them with flints of the modern Tasmanians (figures of both are given), in the light of recent investigations of Dr Klaatsch. The Tasmanian flints are purely eolithic; real instruments, i. e. retouched pieces, are rare; "stations" are on streams and near deposits of suitable material; the great number of flint implements is ac- counted for by their being soon spoiled and often used but for a brief time ; the situation of the Tasmanian shell-heaps indicated the ancient residence of man on the island. Thus the eoliths, the condi- tions of their use, and the culture people who employed them are practically iden- tical - " a very primitive people with an unchanging eolithic industry." Sageret (J.) Les nombres et la cosmo- logie. (R. Scientif., Paris, 19o8, 5e s., Ix, 225-32.) Treats of number-lore in ancient India, China, Asia Minor, Greece (Pythagorean school), etc. Schlaginhaufen (0.)

Describes, with measure- ments, stature, bodily proportions, color, etc., of skin, form of ear, hair, nails, etc., of a young female chimpanzee (ca. 4 yrs.) from the Kongo, in comparison with other chimpanzees, etc., and with man. The height-finger-reach index, 138.3, is far beyond anything human (the height is 86o mm. as compared with 960 mm. for a 4-year-old human being; inter-membral index, 110o.5 and 75-3)- The palmar and plantar grooves and fur-</page><page sequence="8">3 IO AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., IO, 1908 rows, etc., are interesting, particularly those on the dorsal side of the fingers.

A study of the brains of six eminent scientists and scholars be- longing to the American Anthropometric Society, together with a description of the skull of Professor E. D. Cope. (Trans. Amer. Philos. Soc., Phila., 1907, N. S. XXI, 175-308, 30 pl., 16 fg. ) Besides a resum6 of what is known of the brains of 130 notable men and 4 women of various nationalities (also list of cranial capacities of 64 eminent men) and a dis- cussion of the comparative aspects of the general subject ("the brain of a first- class genius like Friedrich Gauss is as far removed from that of the savage Bush- man as that of the latter is removed from the brain of the nearest related ape "), Dr S. describes in detail with numerous figures, the brains of Dr Joseph Leidy (1823-91) eminent in all branches of biology, and his brother, Dr Philip Leidy (1838-91), eminent physician and surgeon; Dr A. J. Parker (1855-92), comparative anatomist of note; Dr Har- rison Allen (1841-98), eminent zoologist and comparative anatomist; Dr E. D. Cope ( 1840-97), famous paleontologist and philosophic anatomist ; Dr William Pepper (d. 1898), eminent clinician. Professor Cope's skull is mesaticephalic (index 77.6), with proportionately large cranium as compared with face (cf. Kant's skull). The brains of the two Leidys do not resemble each other so markedly as do the brains of the three Van Wormer brothers (criminals), and there are cer- tain notable differences. The heaviest brain ot the six was that of Dr Pepper (1593 gr.), who was a man of affairs as well as a physician, the smallest that of Dr P. Leidy (1415 gr.). The brains of these notable men show larger callosa (that of J. Leidy " exceeds in cross-sec- tion area that of any other in this series or recorded in literature "). Very signifi- cant also is the " cerebro-cerebellar ratio." J. Leidy's keen sense of obser- vation and power of visualizing, memo- rizing, etc., and Cope's power of abstract generalization, are reflected in the organ- ization of their brains. According to Dr S. the data abundantly prove the superior character of the brains of great men. Stieda (L.) Ueber die Bedeutung der Hirnwindungen. (Korr.-Bl. d. D. Ges. f. Anthr., Brnschwg., 1907, xxxvIII, 137-8.) L. argues on the basis of ex- tended studies that shape, form, and appearance of cerebral convolutions are of no significance with respect to intelli- gence (the sheep's brain is rich and the mouse's poor in convolutions; the brain of Dr. G. Sauerwein, a celebrated linguist, who died in 1904 (said to have been well acquainted with 54 languages), examined by S., showed no unusual development of the convolutions. S. believes that the gray cortex alone, not the form and fashion of the convolutions, is significant for intelligence.</page><page sequence="9">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERA TURE 3 1 1 Virchow (H.)

Records the occurrence in the upper jaw of an orang skull in the zoological collection of the Berlin Nat- ural History Museum, of a hollow left eye- tooth, and the same also in the lower jaw of a chimpanzee skull. This argues against the theory that all hollow teeth of animals (e. g. cave-bear) found in prehistoric stations, etc., reveal human handiwork. EUROPE Andree (R.) Die Nephritindustrie in Ober- stein-Idar. (Z. f. Ethn., Berlin, 1907, xxxIx, 943-5.) Treats of the produc- tion from New Zealand nephrite, etc., of Maori weapons and ornaments, tiki, mere, etc., at Oberstein and Idar, where they are openly sold as made after genuine models. Similar objects from Asiatic nephrite are made for the Chinese market in Idar. Atgier (-) Crane n6olithique trouv6 A 1' Ile de R6. (B. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1907, ve s., VIii, 305-7.) Describes, with measurements, a sub-dolichocephalic (in- dex 76.47) skull foundin 1853 in the Peu- Pierroux tumulus, belonging to the close of the neolithic period (Robenhausian). Dr A. considers that "this skull is prob- ably that of a woman, a famous druidess, doubtless, of the dolmen epoch." - Crane ultra-brachyc6phale provenant du tumulus du Peu-Pierroux a l'lle de R6. (Ibid., 307-9.) Describes, with measurements, an ultra-brachycephalic male skull (index 90.8o) from the Peu- Pierroux neolithic tumulus, and compares it with a Lapp cranium. Dr A. thinks that the sub-dolichocephalic female skull represents a type allied to the old Iberians (brunette long-heads), while the male ultra-brachycephalic skull belongs with the conquerors who appeared at the end of the neolithic period (brunette broad- heads) and were later known as Celts. Out of this mixture grew the protohis- toric Celtiberians. Baudouin (M.) Le Congres Pr6historique de France. Autun, aofit 1908. (R. Scientif., Paris, 1907, 5e s., IX, 197-205, io fg.) Treats briefly of program (ioo papers were offered), and excursions (the last 4 days were devoted to visiting Mont- Beuvray, - Bibracte of Edui, -the dol- mens of Nolay and the typical neolithic station of Chassey, the famous paleo- lithic site of Solutr6, and the oppidum of Alesia), etc. Berrueta (J. D.) Las Jurdes. (Anthro- pos, Salzburg, 1907, II, 492-S, 2 pl.) Notes on the Jurdes, part of the province of Caceres, long almost a land of fable, and its inhabitants, " cut off from the civilized world," a primitive Spanish folk, whose existence in the 20oth century is a humanitarian and sociological prob- lem. They have been studied by R. Martin Santivafiez in his Un mundo des- conocido en la provincia de Extrama- dura, and by Vicente Barrantes in his Las Jurdes y sus leyendas. Beyerthal (-.) Weitere Untersuchungen iiber die Beziehungen zwischen Schlidel- umfang und Intelligenz im schulpflichti- gen Alter. (Z. f. experim. Pddag., Lpzg., 1907, v, 223-30.) Continues studies of the relation between head-circumference and intelligence. In the case of children of 91-Io? years, success in school de- manded for boys a head-girth of 52 cm., and for girls one of 51 cm., with few ex- ceptions. His studies of 2000 school- children between the ages of 6 and 0o, also lead him to believe that six-year-old girls with a head-girth below 49 cm. and boys with one below 50 cm., rarely do very well at school. Bezzenberger (A.) Vorgeschichtliche Bau- werke der Balearen. (Z. f. Ethn., Ber- lin, 1907, xxxIx, 567-634, 73 fg.) In- teresting account, with plans, measure- ments, etc., of the author's investigations of the talayots, etc., of the Balearic isles. Those at Son Herued, S'Aguila, Canova de Morell, Trebuco (also stone-table), Curnia, Turo, Telati de Dalt (also stone- table and cave), Casana (and stone-table of Torellasa), Hostal near Ciudadela, the Nau d'Es Tudons, the Calas Covas "grottoes," etc., are described. B. re- gards these prehistoric megalithic towers</page><page sequence="10">312 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., IO, 1908 (cf. the Sardinian nuraghe) as forts or places of refuge. That the nuraghe and talayots have had an independent origin on a similar basis is very likely; if one has suggested the other, the priority of the talayots is quite as probable as vice versa. Since the sesi belong to the stone age, it is quite possible that some talayots are at least eneolithic. The complete investigation of a few talayots is very de- sirable. Busse (H.) Tongeflisse von Wolters- dorf im Kreise Nieder-Barnim. (Ibid., 703-704.) Brief account of finds of sev- eral hundred clay vessels, many bronze objects, etc., one notably large urn in particular. The author excavated 95 graves in this urn-burial cemetery of the later bronze age. His results will be published in the near future. Capitan (L.) et Dumas (U.) Les con- structions autour des dolmens. ( Rev. tc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1907, xvII, 330-5, 2 fg.) Brief description of low "walls" of dry stones around dolmens in the de- partment of Gard, e. g., at Tharaux, Congoussac, Carquignaon, Coumoulet, Bouissas, Chine, etc. The relation of these enclosures to the dolmen is un- known, whether funerary, like the dol- mens, house or cattle-enclosures, as has been suggested. Courgey (-). Agglomerations nouvelles autour de Paris. Leur origine. Leurs conditions hygi6niques. (B. Soc. d' Anthr. de Paris, 1907, ve s., VIII, 364- 7I.) Treats of the new groups of people growing up around the city of Paris. The inhabitants of the "military zone" in this class are "at once a cu- riosity and a shame of Paris." Sum- merers in the suburbs become winterers in the city later on. Near the Choisy gate are two separate and independent groups, the camp italien and the camp espagnol. Favraud (A.) Station Aurignacienne au Port-Neuf, commune de la Couronne, Charente. (R. tc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1907, XVII, 418-28, 7 fg.) Gives re- sults of investigations made in 1904- the station was discovered by F. in 1889. Stone implements are described and fig- ured; a few objects of bone were dis- covered, including a striated and incised lion's tooth. This station differs much from the neighboring upper Solutrean shelter of Combe-a-Roland, there being hardly anything common in their human industry; the Port-Neuf station is pre- Solutrean, much earlier and represents a stage distinct from both Magdalenian and Solutrean. Favreau (P.) Die Ausgrabungen in der Einhornhihle bei Scharzfeld. (Z. f. Ethn., Berlin, 1907, xxxIx, 524-50, 8 fg.) Gives results of excavations in 1905-06 in the "IEinhornh6hle " (known since the end of the 17th century) near Scharzfeld in the Harz. Large numbers of fossil bones of bears (U. spelens chiefly), some of which may have been used by man. At pages 540-3 Hr. Windhausen treats of the geological conditions of the finds -he assigns the cave to the Diluvium. An extended discussion by Hrn. Wiegers, Krause, Virchow, and Kossinna followed. The earlier Sturckmann finds of potsherds, etc., have been called in question. Fischer (A. K.) Zur Frage des Aufent- haltes der Hunnen und Sarazenen in den Alpen. (Mitt. d. K.-K. Geogr. Ges. in Wien, 19o8, XLI, 59-60.) Critique of article by B. Reber in an earlier issue. F. disclaims previous knowledge of R's book, Die Hunnen im Schweizerischen Eifischtale (Ziirich, 1896). Fr6d6ric (J.) Beitrage zur physischen Anthropologie der Elsass-Lothringer. (Korr.-Bl. d. D. Ges. f. Anthr., Brnschwg., 1907, xxxvIIl, 76-9, 3 fg. ) Treats of the cephalic index of 2145 (men I 176, women 969) natives of Al- sace-Lorraine, measured by the author. The index averages 82.86 for men, 82.43 for women, av. for both sexes 82.67 - of all the indices 51.8 per cent. were from 80 to 84. The average index for natives of Strassburg was 81.94 ; for na- tives of other towns, 81.82; for country subjects, 83.19 ; for Lower Alsace, 83.ol ; Upper Alsace, 83.90; Lorraine, 84.04. In Lorraine the percentage of blonds is larger than in the two other sections, and the percentage of brunets the smallest; in Lorraine the percentage of short sta- tures is relatively small, of tall relatively large. Comparison with skulls of earlier periods indicates that the present native population of Alsace-Lorraine have a higher percentage of mesocephaly and a lower percentage of high brachycephaly than the people of this region in the Mid- dle Ages, who were nearer to the Alpine primitive population.

Treats of the succession of strata of the Solu- trean-Magdalenian epoch at Laugerie Haute, Cro-Magnon, etc. Here the Aurignacian reposes on the Solutrean and serves as a base to the Magdalenian. The Solutrean is essentially lithic; rein- deer horn and bone occur in the Aurig- nacian, to develop more fully with the dawn of the Magdalenian.

Holds that the manifold agree- ment of the teeth of the man of Krapina (primitive characters are also retained) with those of the modern European, make it certain that " the Homo primigenius was really the direct ancestor of recent man, of the great race that now inhabits Eurasia, America, and North Africa."

The remains (stone, bone, bronze, iron, pottery, etc. ) indicate that the cave has been inhabited by man from the stone age up to medieval time. No clear evidence of diluvial man has yet been found in this cave. See Fritze. Heierli (J.) Neue Forschungen in Pfahl bauten. (Korr.-Bl. d. D. Ges. f.

The fairy mythology of Europe in its relation to early history. (Nineteenth Cent., Lond., 1908, 220- 3 .) Treats of " the queer little Finnish or fairy population of prehistoric Eu- rope," the " Kynesians," who are "older than any Aryan invasion," etc. In this outre paper, the author etymologizes at will with the original roots 'pit' and ' gen' or ' gan,' to produce Gaelic Pict, English Pixy, Latin Pan, with which belong also Finn, Faunus, genius, and even modern French finesse. Also he holds that the Greek 'pigmaios' and the Gothic 'pitguma,' Germanized into 'gnome,' mean simply a yellow man. The real prehistoric pigmies of Europe, who have long since died out, live thus as fairies in the minds of their Aryan supplanters. This is Macritchie's theory run mad. Honzik (E.) und Schmidt (H.) Die prUhistorische Station von Sarata-Monte- orfi, Bezirk Buzefi. (Z. f. Ethn., Berlin, 1907, xxxIx, 999-1003, 9 fg.) Gives account of remains discovered (house- sites, thin culture-strata with ash-layers containing bones, pottery fragments, etc.; four graves with skeletons, pottery, ob- jects of stone, bone, etc.) at Sarata- Monteorii, southwest of BuzeUt in Rou- mania. A bronze armlet, a copper ax, an ear-ornament of copper wire, many and varied pottery fragments, heaps of animal bones (horse, cattle, bear, wolf, fox, pig, sheep-stag rare, a few bird bones). The "ear-handle" pottery finds analogues in parts of Bohemia (terra mare culture), etc.; some of the pottery also belongs with that of the Macedonian tumuli. The station prob- ably belongs to some part of the bronze age. Jeannel (R.) Sur la d6couverte, dans la grotte du Portel, de peintures prthis- toriques r~presentant l'homme et des animaux. (C.-R. Acad. d. Sci., Paris, 19o8, CXLVI, 654-6. ) Brief account of paleolithic paintings of animals (bison, horses, reindeer, etc., mostly horses) and of two men on foot (one figure is very dolichocephalic, with retreating forehead - head is in profile, body and limbs en face; the other has a simian attitude), in the cavern of Portel (also called Crampagna), commune of Loubens, can- ton of Varilhes, Ariege. All the paint- ings except one are monochrome. This is the first discovery of painted human figures in paleolithic caves. The animal pictures do not show the artistic perfec- tion of Altamira or Niaux. Few signs occur among the 40 paintings. This important discovery was made March 9, 1908. Jentsch (H.) Die Bestimmung der Ton- schale mit Leistengestell. (Z. f. Ethn., Berlin, 1907, xxxIx, 953-4.)

Needles of the early bronze period (3 types and 5 other rarer forms), needles of the older bronze period (3 types). In the needles of the early bronze age the "eye " is at the head; in those of the older, on the neck. The needle with holed head (five variants) and the "6sennadel " originated in Bohemia, spreading thence south, north, and west. The East German "6Isennadel " belongs to the oldest bronze period. The two- part northern fibula is an independent invention. Manouvrier (L.) Les cranes et ossements du dolmen de MKenouville, Seine-et-Oise. (Bull.

Observations sur les origines des arts ceramiques dans le bas- sin m6diterrandan. (R. Ec. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1907, xvII, 401-17, 36 fg.) Discusses briefly the ancient pottery ( tech- nique, ornament, painting, enameling) of Egypt, Elam, Syria, etc. The author seeks to prove his theory of the Asiatic origin of the ceramic arts of the Mediter- ranean region. Elamite painted pottery dates back to beyond the 40th century B. C., while the corresponding pre-Hel- lenic or Greece specimens belong only to the 20th century B. C. (this excludes Susian contact). Primordial related cen- ters of painted pottery existed in Egypt and Elam; a secondary one in Canaan. In the valley of the Nile the painting of pottery was anciently replaced in Egypt by enameling, an art appearing much later in Elam, etc. M. de M. believes that " in the greater part of human activi- ties the Orient and the Mediterranean were intimately related." de Mortillet (A.) Etude sur quelques dolmens de l'H~rault. (Ibid., 301-29, 17 fg.)

Les populations de la Suisse depuis la p6riode paleolithique jusqu' a 1' 6poque gallo-helvete.) Bull. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1907, ve s., vill, 212-28.) Treats of the succession of races in Switzerland from the paleolithic to the Gallo-Helvetian period, classifica- tion of the various periods - cave dwell- ers of Magdalenian type, paleolithic man (Saintis de l'Ours, Rhone basin, Vey- rier, Villeneuve, Schaafhausen, Thayn- gen, Freudental, Schweizersbild, Schiis- senried, etc.) mesolithic (Schweizers- bild, Bellerive, Moulin de Liesberg), neolithic, bronze, iron, and certain " tran- sition epochs." The human remains from Chamblandes, etc., and from the lake dwellings are specially considered. S. thinks that the peoples of Switzerland to-day are " a mixed race, belonging in great part, however, to the round-headed ethnic element of Ural-Altaic origin, which, coming from the east, occupied the region of the lower Danube, south- ern Germany, parts of Italy, France, and Great Britain." From the dawn of neo- lithic times this race has been in contact (few in numbers at first) with the more or less dense dolichocephalic peoples of the country, belonging probably to the old quaternary race of Laugerie-Chan- celade, or to its descendant, the race of Baumes-Chaudes-Cromagnon. In the second half of the neolithic age an inva- sion of northern dolichocephals took place; and toward the end of the bronze age new, tall, fair, dolichocephalic peoples (Hallstatt and La Tone) appeared from the east and north. In Switzerland can still be found individuals representing man of the lake-dwellings of the stone and bronze ages, Helvetians, Burgun- dians, Alemanni, and even Italian Rom- ans. But, in general, "in spite of di- versity of language, the people of Switz- erland are, for the greater part, of Celtic or Ligurian race." Schweinfurth (G.) Ueber das H6hlen- Paliolithikum von Sizilien und Siidtu- nesien. (Z. f. Ethn., Berlin, 1907, xxxIx, 832-915, 2 pl., 18 fg.) Treats of the paleolithic remains in the caves of Sicily (particularly Grotta del Castello, Grotta di Nuova at Termini-Imerese, Giuseppe Natale), - 18 types of stone implements, etc., are figured and de- scribed, besides numerous stones in "animal form," etc. ; and southern Tunis (particularly caves near Gafsa) - 16 types of flint implements are figured and described. Correspondences between the Sicilian and Tunisian forms are noted; indeed the Gafsa caves produced no forms that do not find their analogues in Sicily. No distinctly neolithic implements were met with at Gafsa. It is difficult to de- cide whether the Termini-Imerese caves represent the pre- or the post-Solutrean. Ueber A. Rutot's Entdeckung von Eolithen im belgischen Oligocain. (Ibid., 958-9.) Discusses Rutot's discovery of eoliths in the Belgian Oligocene near Boncelles, south of Liege, which S. ac- cepts as genuine, believing that man was present in this region "Ibefore the Oligo- cene sea extended over it."

Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1907, ve s., viII, 231-48, 22 fg. ) Describes 20 cases (17 Bulgarians, 2 Jews, I Bohemian; 8 boys, 12 girls; under one year 6, over two years 4 ; ur- ban parents I I, country 8) among 3500 children belonging chiefly to the district of Sofia in southwestern Bulgaria, of "pigment spots" ( "Mongolian spots" ), with other anthropologic data. Among the facts brought out are : All children in the same family do not have " spots." The "Ispots" can appear several months after birth. They occur about the same in both sexes. The number of "spots " is variable, also the form, size, etc. The color is light blue, dark blue, and (rarely) brown. The "spots " present no special pilosity. They are localized, with rare exceptions, in the sacro-lumbar region. These "Ispots" occur in various races. The age of the child does not seem to in- fluence the intensity of the coloration. The pigment arises in the deep layers of the skin. In the discussion Dr Rivet pointed out that in Ecuador the "blue spots " are regarded as undeniable proof of Indian blood in whites. Weissenberg (S.) Krankheit und Tod bei den siidrussischen Juden. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1907, xcI, 357-63, 3 fg.) Treats of disease and death and their folk-lore among South Russian Jews: Origin of disease (attributed often to the "ievil eye," epidemics ascribed to bad life of some member of community), amulets, charms, folk-remedies, change of name in severe cases, " grave yard measuring " of patient, death-beds (iron bed-steads and hen-feathers bad), treatment of dying and dead (cleansing, etc.), clothes of dead (not to be foreign), burial and funeral-procession, ceremonies at grave, beliefs about soul of dead (wanders for 8 days in the air, enters house, etc. ; the dead assemble nightly in the synagogue to pray).

I, 73.7-88.6. The per- centage of blonds is also about the same. The nose, however, is a little more " Semitic" with the Aaronites and Le- vites. They represent thus the same an- thropological type. Each group counts about 10 per cent. of the total popula- tion of Jews in Russia and Germany. Wiegers (F.) Neue Funde paldiolithischer Artefacte. (Ibid., 718-29, 14 fg.) De- scribes flints from the Diluvium of Thur- ingia and Saxony - new finds at Ehrings- dorf near Weimar, Rabutz near Halle, Osterode, Hundisburg, and Neuhaldens- leben. Zaborowski (S.) Relations primitives des Germains et des Finnois. (Bull. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1907, ve s., VIII, 174-9.) Treats of the Teutonic element (e. g., kana, 'hen,' akana, 'straw,' kagra, 'oats,' knokka, 'mat- tock,' Venaja, ' Veneti,' etc.) in the Finnish languages. According to Z., " it was at the south of the Gulf of Fin- land, on the Baltic littoral opposite the island of Gotland, that the contact be- tween Teutons and Finnish peoples took place, that gave rise to these loan-words and the transference of culture repre- sented by them. This occurred in the Ist century A.D., when the shore of the Baltic from the Gulf of Finland to be- yond the Niemen was Finnish. - Le passe pr6historique de la Bohame. (R.

The moral development of the native races in South Africa. (In- tern. J. Ethics, Lopd., 19o8, xviii, 137-51.) According to B., the churches and missionary societies are inadequate to the work of education, which should be undertaken by the State. The edu- cation up to date has been too bookish ahd intellectual. Strength and morality won tilrough industrial training, not serfdom, are necessary. South Africa will never be wholly a white man's country, -nor wholly a black man's country. Harmony and co6peration of races must exist.

It is regarded highly by the natives as a mark of beauty. Naville (E.) The origin of Egyptian civilization. (J. R. Anthr. Inst., Lond., 1907, xxxvII, 201-14.) Author seeks to show from archeological and cultural data that "the civilization of the early Egyptian dynasties belongs to a nation formed by an indigenous stock, of African origin, among which settled conquerors coming from Arabia, from the same start- ing-point as the Chaldeans." This for- . eign element was not Semitic, but Hami- tic like the natives on whom they intruded. In.the Mediterranean an Hamitic civi- lization was first in date and "the races who were the bearers of the Egean civi- lization came from the south." The native stock N. identifies with the Anu or Anti of the inscriptions. The white race in remote antiquity extended farther south in Africa, and were later driven northward by the negroes.

Treats of than (genii of various sorts - soil, hearth, etc.; some souls of men become than after death), ma (spirits, often also souls of persons drowned, dying unusual or unnatural deaths, dishonored in burial, etc.), qui (demons, more wicked than the ma), 6ng bM (souls of ancestors), etc. The An- namese live, move, and have their being in the supernatural. d'Enjoy (P.) Le theatre en pays chinois. (B. Soc. d'Anthr. d. Paris, 1907, ve s., vIII, 353-63.) Treats of the Chinese theater : origin (dramatic art came from India with Buddhism), character ( Chinese drama has never been, like Greek drama, a real art; to live by the theater is a dis- grace : a Chinese proverb says "the au- thor is a god, he creates; the actor is a monkey, he grimaces"; no woman adopts acting as a profession, it would disgrace her; actors are vagabonds, beggars, parasites), plays and music (heroic and military pieces, tragedies, historic poems, comedies and even vau- deville, - no censorship, realistic love scenes). In the comedies foreigners are made sport of. Eugenien (-) Les Chiites d'aujourd'hui. (Anthropos, Salzburg, 1907, II, 406-21, 3 pl.) Treats of the modern Shiites : popular beliefs, sects and divisions, pil- grimages and sanctuaries (Nedjef, Ker- beli, Samarra, Mechhed Rida), relig- ious customs and usages (defilement and purification, death, fanaticism, temporary marriage, clergy, Hosein procession, etc. ). Gaupp (H.) Ueber die Geburtshilfe der Chinesen. (Z. f. Ethn., Berlin, 1907, xxxIx, 729-45, IO fg.) R6sumts the data in three Chinese books treating of midwifery, the Ta shnzgpien, or "IBirth of Man " (edited in 17I5 by Gi~cai cu 'e), the Ta sh-ng yao chi, or " What is worth knowing about Birth" (by a Shanghai physician, Fang Tung Yuan, ca. 1737), and the Skh shkng pi p'on tsung yao, or "Most important secret explanations of midwifery" (ca. 1638 A. D.). The last book contains a history of the devel- opment of the fetus by months, which is of no little interest. At page 743 are reproduced from this book the represen- tations of the human fetus in each of the ten months of its life. In all three books innumerable recipes aind remedies are given. Prediction of the sex of unborn. children is believed in by the Chinese physicians, and in the third book here considered a theory of male and female births according to the months of the year in which conception occurs, is de- veloped. Much curious folk-medicine and folk-psychology is here represented. Gowland (W.) The burial mounds and dolmens of the early emperors of Japan. (J. R. Ahthr. Inst., London, 1907, xxxvII, 1o-46, 8 pl., 23 fg.) Treats of the misasagi or imperial burial-mounds (sometimes "double," but containing only one dolmen) peculiar to Japan, their construction, contents. Those at Nara, Mise, Unebi (Emperor Jimmu), Taka- tsuki (Emperor Keitai), Fujiudera (Em- peror Chuai Tenno), Sakai (Emperors Nintoku and Richu), Domioji (Emperor Ingyo), double mounds near Omuro etc., are considered in detail. The chief centers of dolmen-mound distribution are</page><page sequence="21">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERA TURE 323 four (Yamato, Izumo, Kyushu, Musa- shi, - perhaps also Bizen, later), indi- cating in the early part of the period " independent or semi-independent clans of the same race, armed with the same weapons, and having the same burial customs and religious beliefs." Greenwell (-) Notes on a collection of bronze weapons, implements and vessels found at Khin.m.n to the west of Ker- man in south-east Persia by Major P. Molesworth Sykes, C. M. G. (Ibid., 196-200, pl.) Treats of large pottery vessels (probably fort burial purposes), globular vasesof clay, bowlsof hammered copper, bronze knives, pins, rods, leaf- shaped javelin-heads, axes (lion design), etc. According to the author, " so far as is known no similar cemetery or burials of a like kind have hitherto been found in Persia." Hosten (H.) Prehistoric remains near Kodaikanal, Palnis. (Anthropos, Salz- burg, 1907, II, 735-40.) Treats briefly of several groups of dolmens and two groups of kistvaens, and some low circles of earth and stones in the Palni hill re- gion of northern Hindustan. Whether the "open dolmens" were tombs or dwellings is uncertain, and they yielded only fragments of red and black pottery of 5 or 6 different kinds, some beads, etc. Little also was found in the kistvaens, some of which had been previously rifled. There is need of scientific archeological research in this part of India. v. Le Coq (A.) Bericht fiber Reisen und Arbeiten in Chinesisch-Turkistan. (Z. f. Ethnol., Berlin, 1907, xxxIx, 509-24, 2 pl., lo fg.) Gives results of author's investigations and discoveries in the ruins of Idiqut Schari (old Uighur capital, thie temples of the Murtuq, Toyoq, etc.), the ruins near Qomul, etc., during the year 19o6. A complete temple of the Thang period (7-9th century) was discovered, and many Mss. and texts, including some in a hitherto unknown Iranic tongue, brought away. The author believes that " the East-Asiatic religious art is not autochthonous, but grew up on a Greek- Indian basis." Lunet de la Jonquibre (-) Les monu- ments de I'ancien Cambodge. (Bull. Soc. Arch6ol. de Bordeaux, 19o6, xxviiI, 19-41.) After some historical notes, the author treats briefly ancient Cambodian temples and their surroundings; the apogee of this art was from the 9th to the 12th centuries A. D. At Angkor- Vat, Meal6a, etc., are innumerable sculptures, friezes, etc. The Brahmanic empire of Cambodia was a theocracy hold- ing the great mass of the aboriginal ele- ment in harsh servitude. With the Thais came the gentler and democratic doctrines of Gautama. Masip (J.) Del matrimonio chino. (An- thropos, Salzburg, I907, II, 715-21.) Notes on marriage law, ceremonies, cus- toms, etc., among the Chinese of the re- gion of Xao-u, province of Fokien, - preparation for marriage, wedding, con- dition of married people. Morel (G.) Note sur des silex tailles ac- tuellement et employ6s industriellement. (B. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1907, ve s., vIII, 349-52, 4 fg.) Describes the flints employed in the manufacture to-day at Bunjurkli, north of Magnesia, Asia Minor, of a sort of huge scraper for use on the threshing floor in separating the grain from the straw. Every year hundreds of these implements are sent to Smyrna, etc., whence they reach the Greek isles. Some of the flints employed are really pre- historic, being picked up in the fields, etc. de Morgan (J.) Le plateau iranien pen- dant l'6poqu'e pl6istocene. (R. Ec. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1907, XVII, 213-16.) The author believes that glacial condi- tions made the-Iranian plateau uninhabit- able during the end of the Pliocene and through the Pleistocene period. Hence the absence of traces of paleolithic or archeolithic industry (in Persia, also, the neolithic is little if any developed). Iran remained desert up to the first appearance of the metals. de St. Elie (A.-M.) Les Racusiens, Cy- riens, Maronites ou Monoth61lites. (An- thropos, Salzburg, 1907, II, 668-74.) Notes on the semi-Christian Racusians (according to the author A'acz2s or Rakias - Kfirus, Curus, an Arab form of Cyrus, patriarch of Alexandria, who decreed in 633 the adoption of monothelism), Cyri- ans, etc. To the Racusian sect belonged al'-Ahtal, the poet of the Ommiades. The Mards or Mardaites were also Racu- sians. For a long time Racusian, Cyrian, Maronite, Monothelite were synonyms. Schlaginhaufen (0.)

Among the Semang brachycephals seem to be relatively numerous. Good bibliography. Sergi (G.) Dalle esplorazioni del Turkes- tan. Frammenti scheletri umani. (A. d. Soc. Rom. di Antrop., 1907, XIII, 305-21, IO fg.) Describes, with meas- urements where possible, fragmentary crania of 2 adults and 7 children from tumulus at Anau in Turkestan near the Persian border, --the various strata of the tumulus are thought to date from 8000ooo to 5200 B. C. Some of these crania may belong ca. 7000 B. C., and S. ex- presses the opinion that in the region in question, " from about the eighth millen- nium B. C. on, lived (the tumuli repre- sent their scattered settlements) a peo- ple of the same origin as the Mediterra- nean stock (the crania are of this type)." This would confirm the views of those who make the Aryans a part of the Med- iterranean race. In another tumulus at Anau (5200-2200 B. c.) was discov- ered a skull of a type suggesting the negro or negrito, but much inferior in form. These excavations and explora- tions were made by Prof. Pumpelly under the auspices of the Carnegie Institution of Washington in 1904. INDONESIA, AUSTRALASIA, POLY- NESIA Abel (P.) Knabenspiele aufNeu-Mecklen- burg, Siidsee. (Anthropos, Salzburg, 1907, II, 708-14). Detailed description of the boys' spear-games and the game of spear-fighting, the favorite play of all boys, youths, and men among the natives of New Mecklenburg. Baer (G. A.) Contribution &amp; l' tude des langues des indigenes aux iles Philip- pines. (Ibid., 467-91.) Gives vocabu- laries of Ino words in 22 Philippine lan- guages and dialects compared with Malay : Tagal, i i Negrito, Manguian, 3 Igor- rote, Guinian, Tinguian, Ilocan, Vicol, Pampangan, Panayan. Also a special vocabulary of 393 words of the Negrito of Montalvan and some 80 phrases in that language; brief supplementary vo- cabularies of the Negrito of Olongap6 and Hermosa; and a song of the Negri- tos of Maion in Bulacan, and two Igor- rote love-songs from Busao. The 9 Negrito vocabularies and that of the Igorrote of Busao were collected by the author. The Malay is from Wallace. Basedow (-) Ueber Felsgravierungen hohen Alters in Zentral-Australien. (Z. f. Ethn., Berlin, 1907, XXXIx, 707-17, Io fg.) Describes and figures ancient rock-carvings at Balparana and Wilkin- dinna (two water places formerly visited by the aborigines) near Yudanamutana, in Central Australia. These remarkable carvings were probably executed by the now extinct " Two-Tooth " blacks of the region. Among the figures are those of birds, snakes, tracks of animals, etc. Certain circles may be " corroboree signs," and the author thinks that the extinct gigantic bird Genyornis newtoni may be intended by some of the foot- prints. Other figures represent canoes, etc., also human beings perhaps. The great age of these carvings is shown by the patina with which they are now covered. Man may have been contempo- rary in this part of the world with these giant birds in the Tertiary period, but convincing proof is yet absent. von Biilow (W.) Einige Bemerkungen iiber die Anthropologie der Samoa-Inseln. (Int. Arch. f. Ethnogr., Leiden, 1906, xvIII, 105-9.) v. B. holds, against Krdimer, that the "best families" in Samoa are darker-skinned than the aver- age Samoan (later immigrants). Three facial types are recognized : Melanesian, Polynesian, and Aryan (?). The author criticizes Krdimer's illustrations from photographs of Samoans. At least three races are fused in the Samoan, and not perfectly now after Iooo years. -- BeitrAge zur malayo-polynesischen Ethnographie und Sprachforschung. (Ibid., 100-5.) Discusses the etymolo- gies of Malayo-Polynesian words for "man," "foreigner," the names Viti, Tahiti, Maori and Moriori, Manua, etc. Samoan tagata (man) is traced to primitive Malayo-Polynesian kanaka, "child" ; Papilagi, "foreigner," means "child of sky " ; Tahiti - " eastern." Cunningham ( D. J.) The head of an aboriginal Australian. (J. R. Anthr. Inst., Lond., 1907, xxxvII, 47-57, 3 pl.)

(An- thropos, Salzburg, 1907, II, 675-81, 1oo9-21.) After brief ethnographic in- troduction (habitat, dwellings, villages, dress and ornament, weapons, food, to- bacco, industries, domestic and social life, spirits, treatment of dead), the author gives a grammatical sketch of the language and comparative vocabularies (pp. IOI6-21) of Tauata, Oru-Lopiko, Fujuge, and Kuni. Fritsch (G.) Ueber einen zweimal tre- panierten Schldel. (Z. f. Ethn., Berlin, 1907, xxxIx, 702-3.) Treats of a skull from the Bismarck archipelago, belonging to an individual who had been person- ally known to Mr Parkinson. It had been trepanned twice, with an interval of 20 years, for an injury to the bone. A sort of trepanation on the forehead is often practised on healthy children as a protection against disease. Hahl (A.) Das mittlere Neumecklenburg. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1907, xcI, 310- 16.) Treats of the Melanesian natives of central New Mecklenburg, -indus- tries (weapons and implements, musical instruments, grass and bark weaving; carving not in use, canoe-building ex- tinct), trade and commerce, population (less than Io,ooo, almost two-thirds males, prostitution, decreasing births, etc.), houses, chiefs, war, tribal divisions, marriage and marriage-customs, puberty ceremonies, death and mourning, spirit- lore (soul, earth and tree spirits and other evil spirits), dances (harvest, change-of-wind, spear, women's and men's special dances, etc.) and songs, ririnangu (corresponds to dukduk of Gazelle peninsula), but no society like the iniet, festivals, etc. Klaatsch (H.) Schlussbericht tiber meine Reise nach Australien in den Jahren 1904-7. (Z. f. Ethn., Berlin, 1907, xxxIx, 635-90, 4 pl., 7 fg.) Gives ac- count of author's travels and investiga- tions from May 19o6 to April 1907 in Beagle bay, Northwest Australia (natives of Beagle bay, critique of Spencer and Gillen and of Howitt ; no real totemism ; churirngas and soul-lore of the Niolniol; penis-mutilation; ethnographic specimens from Beagle bay; taboos) ; Cambridge- Gulf, Wyndham, N. W. Australia (brain of youth obtained; leaf-shaped spear- points; stone implements of paleolithic types); Port Darwin, Melville island, Northern Territory (atavistic foot-forma- tion in a native of Port Keats; method of fighting; natives of Melville id.; pillar-graves, - from which skulls were obtained, - and their ornamentation ; clothing and ornament of natives; body- painting ; dances), Tasmania (stone im- plements, etc.). Dr K. was very success- ful in making collections of ethnologic objects. de Marzan (J.) Le tot6misme aux Iles Fiji. -(Anthropos, Salzburg, 1907, II, 400-5.) R6sumbs the ideas of natives of Fiji ids. on totems principal (these are double, i. e. both animal and vegetal, and are not to be destroyed or eaten) and secondary (can be eaten with certain ob- servances). Many tribal names have no analogy with the names of their principal totems. A tribe may have several secon- dary totems. Great respect was paid to the principal totems, and they were con- sulted in wars, disease, marriage, etc. An expectant mother was visited by the totem animal. Accessory totems were also known. A woman marrying in a foreign tribe honors both the totems of that tribe and her own. The tree-totem was prob- ably the only principal totem at first, - according to Fiji legend, the place oforigin of the people is a mountain of the prov- ince of Ra, called Nakau-vadra, from the tree vadra. A list of tree and animal to- tems of some tribes is'given on page 405. Meier (J.) Primitive V6lker und " Par- adies "-Zustand. Mit besonderer Be- riicksichtigung der friiheren Verhdilt- nisse beim Oststamm der Gazellehalbinsel im Bismark-Archipel, Neu-Pommern. (Ibid., 374-86. ) Discusses the so-called " Paradise-condition " of primitive peoples, the natives of the Gazelle penin- sula, Bismarck archipelago in particular. Religion (fear of evil spirits, cult of the dead), social relations (anthropophagy, war and murder, slavery, etc.), family- life (low position of woman, no real " family-sense "), household activities, food, clothing, etc. The author con- cludes that the evidence cited (and the</page><page sequence="24">326 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., o10, 1908 immorality also is great) indicates no " Edenic condition "for these aborigines, who nevertheless possess germs of religi- ous truths, the sense of good and bad, etc., which make the labor of the mis- sionary possible and profitable. Mythen und Sagen der Admi- ralititsinsulaner. (ibid., 646-67, 933-41, 6 pl., map.) Gives, with oc- casional explanatory notes, the native texts (Moanus language) with interlinear translations of I8 creation myths, etc. (creation of earth and man, origin leg- ends, creation of woman, origin of Poauai Channel, origin of thing from the belly of a snake, origin of fire, of the coco- palm, of the areca-palm, etc.), 4 legends of the confusion of tongues, 5 legends concerning sky, sun, moon, etc. (the 40 men who went up into the sky, origin of men from the sun, sun-path of good moon- path of bad, origin of dark spots in moon, why sun rises in east and moon in west). The source of these myth-texts is Po Minis, son of Po Sing, a former chief of the Admiralty ids., and a) pupil of the author in the Catholic missions. Mollison (T.) Die Maori in ihren Be- ziehungen zu verschiedenen benachbarten Gruppen. (Korr.-Bl. d. D. Ges. f. Anthr., Brnschwg., 1907, xxxvIII, 147-52, 8 fg.) On the basis of 24 differ- ent cranial characters and "1the method of relative deviation," M. compares the Maori (16 skulls), studied by him with other Maori (Luschan, Scott), Chatham islanders (Scott), Lifu islanders (Bertil- Ion), Australians, etc. M. concludes that Polynesians, Melanesians, and Aus- tralians represent a mixed series; and that among the Maori the Polynesian element by far predominates. Planert (W.) Australische Forschungen. I. Aranda-Grammatik. (Z. f. Ethn., Berlin, 1907, xxxIx, 551-64.) Gram- matical sketch of the Aranda (Arunta) language of Central Australia, with (pages 561-566) four brief native texts, with interlinear and free translations. The author, Hr. Wettengel, has lived several years in Australia and so familiar- ized himself with the Arunta and Dieri languages as to be able to preach in both. The Ms. has been revised by Planert. Reiter (F.) Traditions tonguiennes. (An- thropos, Salzburg, 1907, IT, 438-48, 743 -54.) Gives native texts and interlinear- translations, free versions, explanatory notes, etc., of the legend of the origin of the world and its inhabitants, and of the tale of the island of Eua and the deeds upon it of gods and devils, men and women. The first is the famous Polynesian myth of the fishing up of the lands by Maui. Roth (W. E.) North Queensland Eth- nography. Bulletin No. 9. Burial ceremonies, and disposal of the dead. (Rec. Austral. Mus., Sidney, 1907, VI, 365-403, 7 pl.) Gives particulars con- cerning death and burial among the abori- gines of Pennefather river, lower Car- pentaria coast, Princess Charlotte bay, Cape Bedford, Bloomfield river, Tully river, Russell river, Boulia, Cloncurry, upper Georgina river, Rockhampton, Brisbane. Death is thought due to " some enemy in the flesh or spirit doom- ing the individual to a particular form of death, e. g., by lightning, flood, spear." The differences between the funeral ob- sequies, observances, superstitions, etc., of men and women, warriors and others, children and adults, young and old, strong and healthy and weak or infirm, go back to the nature of the body from which the spirit working the evil has come. The matter is further compli- cated by the fact that the spirit may be associated with shadow, breath, heart, after-birth, ears, nose, and can thus be seen, heard, smelt, etc. Propitiatioin, therefore, becomes quite an art. Accord- ing to R. the natives do not eat human flesh to acquire the moral or physical qualities of the dead person (no male, e. g., would wish to obtain the attributes of a woman or a child). The widow " be- comes ultimately the property of one or other of her late husband's group- or blood-brothers." The deceased's hut is usually burnt or taken to pieces. Mourn- ing colors are either white or red, or both, the latter being more indicative of the avenging sentiment. Rougier (E.) Maladies et m6decines a Fiji autrefois et aujourd'hui. (Anthro- pos, Salzburg, 1907, II, 994-1007, 4 pl.) Treats of tabus and observances con- cerning the elements, agriculture, -fish- ing, health, the individual at various stages of life (before birth, at birth, at adolescence, married, complete man), struggle of the modern Fijians against the inroads of new diseases (diseases of the body and their treatment, Fijian surgery), etc. At pages Ioo6-ioo8 is given a list of medicinal plants (Fijian and Latin names, parts used etc.). The Fijians ex- plain all diseases as due to violation or neglect of tabus or observances.</page><page sequence="25">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERA TURE 327 Schmidt (W.)

Strehlow, since 1892 a missionary among the ab- origines (Dieri and Aranda), with ex- planatory notes, etc. In the case of 5 of these an interlinear translation and a free version are given. Of the texts 64 relate to the " totem-procedures." In the plates accompanying this valuable mono- graph objects used in connection with the "totem ceremonies," etc., are shown. These aborigines have much lore concern- ing the tjurunga stones and pieces of wood (with ornamentations) which are figured in four of the plates. In these stories sun, moon, stars, Pleiades, Milky Way, comets and meteors, rainbow, whirlwind appear; also the kangaroo, emu, eagle, fishes, dog, snake, echidna, bat, duck, raven, lizard, frog, ant, wallaby, wild- cat, opossum, rat, owl, crane, kingfisher, larvae, and others. Among the note- worthy personages are the great good being Altjira, Mangarkunjerkunja (crea- tor of men, etc.), Putiaputia (the teacher of the Aranda), the goddess Kaiala, Ara, the divine kangaroo, Tuatjumbinjua (who taught women and girls to dance), Atua arintja (the bad man), and Atua in- datoa (the beautiful man), etc. A mass of information relating to primitive ideas and institutions is contained in these texts.

R6- sum6s knowledge as to mitis of Austra- lian blacks and Europeans (Freycinet in 1800-4 met two or three; lately the existence of a considerable number has been reported, and in 1881 Cauvin believed they were on the increase). The inquiries of Z. reveal the fact that of the 3888 blacks of W. Australia in 19o0, no fewer than 502 were mdtis, while in 1906 the latter had increased to 591, the pure-bloods having decreased some 250. The portrait of a young m'tis of Victoria shows refinement toward the European type. Others show some- times the predominant Australian char- acters, in certain cases "repulsively so." In the discussion M. Baudouin cited an interesting case of marriage of a young French sailor and an Australian girl of 7 years. As a result of this paper and the discussion a permanent committee for the study of ethnic mixtures was ap- pointed. AMERICA Ambrosetti (J. B. Exploraciones ar- queol6gicas en la Pampa Grande, Pro- vincia de Salta. (Rev. Univ. de Buenos Aires, 1906, v, repr., pp. 1-199, p1., 173 fg.) Gives the results of archeo- logical explorations in 1905 in the Pampa Grande of the province of Salta, Argen- tina, by Dr A., Dr F. Cervini, Dr C. O. Bunge, and Dr L. Maupas. Among the objects discovered were large numbers of burial-urns, together with many an- thropomorphic urns, painted dishes, etc. ; bone implements, pottery of various sorts (often zo6morphic and anthropomorphic in part; and frequently engraved with various designs), stone objects (axes, hammers, mortars, bolas, ornaments), bronze objects (tokis or ceremonial axes, pectoral plates and ornamented disks, bells, etc. ). Interesting are the cairns or stone tumuli, and the pedrera, which seem to have been places of religious expression or ceremonial. Two types of culture are revealed by these investiga- tions : I. A type of ruder urns, pottery, etc., like that discovered by Boman in San Pedro de Jujuy, and in' Carmen, Valle de Lerma, Salta. 2. A type of urns and other objects purely Calchaqui. Of these the first type is much more common. Sometimes the two types are mingled in one burial-place, but these graves were used at different periods. The people of inferior culture may have been of the same race as the Calchaquis,- the latter buried children, not adults (as did the former) in urns.

The first part of this valuable monograph on the Indians of Surinam, based on the data of the exploring expeditions of 1901-05, treats of tribes and their dis- tribution, clothing and ornament (of dancers in particular), settlements, houses, furniture, domestic animals, etc. (the Ojana have 7 types of houses, the Trio 4, of which 3 are the same as with the Ojana), food, fire, tobacco, nunting, fishing, weapons, pottery (that of Trio and Ojana not so good as Galibi and Arawak), cotton, weaving and plait- ing (chief types are described), orna- mentation, drawing, modeling, music (5 sorts of flute), population, customs, usages, etc., trade. Part II (pp. 31-I1I) is devoted to linguistics, extensive classi- fied vocabularies being given of the Cariban Kalina, Trio, and Upurui, and one of 103 words of the " trade-langue" of the Indians and "Bush-Negroes."

General discussion of "some remarkable similarities between the an- cient calendars of Americans and Asi- atics." Groeteken (A.) Bischof Aramentia O. F. M. und die Erforschung des Rio Madre de Dios. (Anthropos, Salzburg, 1907, II1, 730-34.) Gives brief account of the life and works of N. Armentia, Bishop of La Paz, in connection with his investiga- tions of the Rio Madre de Dios country and its Indian inhabitants. At p. 734 are given (from Armentia) the personal possessive and demonstrative pronouns in the Tacana proper, Araona, Pacaguara, Cavinefia, and Mosatena languages. The second edition of Armentia's A avigacion del Madre de Dios appeared in 1887. Harnden, E. W. Indian pictographs in Pate Valley [California].

Notes re- porting successful personal experiment in use of diorite axes of Brazilian Indians of Sao Paulo in felling trees. Jett6 (J.) On the medicine-men of the Ten'a. (J. R. Anthr. Inst., Lond., 1907, XXXVII, 157-88.) Treats of spirit and "devil " lore, medicine-men (one medi- cine-woman to five medicine-men), their power, social standing (influential, rich, respected, feared, - "the nearest ap- proach to a chief, a priest, a physician" ),</page><page sequence="27">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERATURE 329 calling to the profession (by find a karu- nih, a bead-like object, after a dream, - a collection of such in a pouch or box is his amulet), mode of life (not different from fellows), foreknowledge and pre- dictions (not always believed in), " heal- ing " (sometimes showy and elaborate), taboos, " calling" fish or game by medi- cine-man, performance of tricks. At pp. 177-82 is given a list of foreign and native words used in this paper, and at pp. 182-5 a list of words and phrases used by the medicine-man. On pp. 185 -8 are given native text and interlinear and free translation of a Ten'a legend, "The Cripple." Among the Ten'a " the name given to a small child is commonly the first incorrect or outlandish word which he or she pronounces, or which is said about him or her." They are "phenomenally credulous" of their medicine-men. These Athapascan In- dians live in central Alaska and number some 1600-2000. Lehmann (W.) Die altmexikanischen Mosaiken des ethnographischen Museums in Kopenhagen. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1907, XCI, 332-5, 4 fg.) Treats of two ancient Mexican mosaics now in the Eth- nographic Museum at Copenhagen - one a mask in the form of a snake-head out of whose jaws looks a human head; the other (specially fine) is a head with a high feather-diadem- the tongue pro- trudes, and other things also suggest com- parison with the ancient Mexican masks of the Aldrovandus collection in the Museo preistorico at Rome. Mahoudeau (P. G. ) Les primates et les prosimiens fossiles de la Patagonie d' apr~s les travaux de M. Florentino Ameghino. (R. Ec. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1907, XVII, 354-61, 387-93.) Resumes the facts and theories in the recent works of Ame- ghino on the fossil primates and prosi- mians of Patagonia, particularly the Homunculus patagonicus, a monkey of such characteristics as to rank probably in the line leading to man and the an- thropomorphic apes. According to Ame- ghino, the Homunculidoe, which were nei- ther arboricoles nor climbers, but walkers erect or half-upright at least, are the primates nearest to the human type - they are " the ancestors of all the apes (except the Lemurs) of both the New and the Old World." And Patagonia was the scene of this highest mamma- logical (including man) development. In the Araucanian stage of the more recent geological strata A. finds traces of very rudimentary human implements. Prowe (H.) undLehmann (W.) Quich6- Sagen. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1907, xcI, 305-6.) Discussion and criticism of Quich6 etymologies set forth by P. Dr L. objects to those suggested for imox, Hunahpu etc. Rivet (Dr) Essai sur les peuples sud- ambricains. (R. Scientif., Paris, I9o8, 3e s, Ix, 257-69.) Treats of the past, present, and future of South America, " the only European colony on tropical soil." The white population consists of " transplanted folk." Equality is pro- claimed everywhere, but nowhere else do pride of race and prejudice of birth flour- ish more,-aristocrats, party, priesthoods rule in republics. Castilian arrogance has fed upon the conquered aborigines. Traditionalism and the religious spirit mark the Spaniard. The South Ameri- can is psychologically the product of the mingling of the Spanish race and the Indian, controlled by the geographic situ- ation. There is in formation a new American race, born of European and Indian, which, with the coming of politi- cal stability, will have vitality and energy enough to exploit the land and carry on the work of culture and civilization. Teschauer (-) Ueber den gegenwdirtigen Stand der Ethnographie in Brasilien. (Anthropos, Salzburg, 1907, II, 499- 507.) Resumbs recent ethnographic in- vestigations in Sao Paulo (sambaquis partly pre-Columbian, partly post-Co- lumbian, partly of natural origin; T. thinks their importance has been exagge- rated), Rio de Janeiro (Lacerda' s studies of primitive man in Brazil : Ist period, cave-man of Sumidouro; 2d period, Sambaqui man; 3d period, man of Pacoval, - the last period immediately precedes the discovery of America, be- tween the two first millenniums elapsed ; in Bahia the white-negro metis, in Para and Amazonas the Indian-white mietis dominated, - it is the Indian-white inter- mixture that still goes on ; the products of crosses between white and negro are esthetically finer and more regular than of those between white and Indian), Bahia (investigations of C. Barreto in the casas fortes and other ruins of Am- argosa, Feira de St. Anna, etc., the murundzis or burial mounds, inscriptions, native nephrite, etc.), Belem do Para (Dr E. A.

Nac. de Buenos Aires, 1907, xvI, 307-46, 16 pl.) This, the first anthropological thesis for the doctorate in S. America, is a detailed study with measurements and drawings of the mastoid region of Ioo "Cal- chaqui " (2 defective on left side) skulls, of which 54 are in the Museo Nacional and 46 in the Ethnographic Museum of the University. Among the results noted are these: The mastoid apophysis is larger on the left and not, as in European skulls, on the right; the digastric crest predominates; the mastoid foramina oc- cur less frequently, and less often on the right side (in European, left); the ex- ternal petrosquamous suture is much more common than in European skulls and the internal attitude of the mastoid apophyses less. This monograph has also appeared in pamphlet form (Buenos Aires, 1907, pp. 72). Torres (L. M.) Arquelogia de la cuenca del Rio Paranh. (R. d. Mus. de La Plata, Buenos Aires, 1907, XIv, 53-122, 45 fg., map). Gives results of archeological investigations of Zeballos and Pico, Maz- zanti, Ambrosetti and the author himself in the region between the Paranh and Uruguay. The tumulus of Campana, near the city of Buenos Aires, and that of the river Usur6 at Goya in Corrientes, and the paradero of Gaboto are treated in detail and the finds described, human remains, instruments of stone, bone (of which some are engraved), pottery (zo6- morphic, geometrical ornamentation, etc). The zo6morphic and anthropomorphic type of pottery found at Campana and Goya, etc., does not occur in the islands in the south of Entre Rios or in those of the western part of the Delta. The only human skull of those discovered at Cam- pana which came into the Museum has an index of 71.28 and may be related to those from the insular region of Entre Rios and the neighboring parts of Uru- guay. Much of the domestic outillage from the Campana tumulus closely re- sembles that of the Delta and Entre Rios. Vram (U. G.) Su d'una singolare urna funeraria dell' America del Sud.
