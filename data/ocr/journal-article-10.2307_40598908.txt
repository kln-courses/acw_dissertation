Cybernetic Serendipity: The Computer and the Arts, on view at the ICA from August 2 to October 20, 1968, explored the role of computers in the arts, broadly conceived to include music, poetry, theater, film, dance, graph- ics, robots, installations, and environments. At the time, the word "computer" designated a variety 01 devices, Irom IBM mainframes to indi- vidually improvised analogue machines. By linking the com- puter to creative practices, the exhibition challenged the separa- tion of art and creativity from science and technology. Because computers could produce work in diverse media, the exhibition also implicitly ques- ^V9HPHHH^^| tioned distinctions between presumably ^^^^gj^^^^M^jg^^J discrete creative realms. Recently, art historians, artists, and cura- tors have given considerable attention to art exhibitions of the late 1960s and 1970s, decades during which exceptional curators adopted the dual roles of organizers and critics and conceived the exhibition itself as a medi- um with which to develop new ideas about art. Exhibitions such as When Attitudes Become Form: Works-Concepts-Processes-Si tuations, organized by Harald Szeemann in 1969 for the Kunsthalle Bern, and Information, curated by Kynaston McShine for the Museum of Modern Art in 1970, were not limited to providing contexts in which to teach art but became vehicles for redefining artistic and institutional practices and even to circumvent art institutions. l Other initiatives such as the proposal for the exhibition Art by Telephone, organized by Jan van der Mark for the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago in 1969, have been lauded for their engagement with technologies and procedures then new to the art world.2 The recent scholarly interest in these historical exhibitions is not accidental, for during the last decade, increasing involvement of artists with digital and genetic technologies and tactical media practices has again presented challenges to traditional ideas about art, the institution of the museum, and the separation of art from other realms of knowledge and practice. Given the retrospection prompted by these contemporary concerns, current criticism focuses on shows that transgress disciplinary borders and endow the museum space with the potential to make new meanings.3 Yet scholars writing about curatorial work consistently exclude Cybernetic Serendipity.4 The omission of Cybernetic Serendipity from the canon of modern-art exhibi- tions is not entirely surprising, because from 1970 to the mid- 1990s computer art developed independently from modern art museums and was largely ignored by art historians.5 More puzzling is the scarcity of information on Reichardt within the field of digital art. Her show, organized at a time in which, the use of computers in art institutions was rare and the involvement of women in sci- entific subjects even more so, was no small achievement. How did Reichardt engage in such a venture? How was the exhibition conceived, how was it received, and what did it achieve? I posit that far from being perceived solely as entertainment, as some of the exhibition's critics have argued, the show's theoretical premises unsettled neat notions of human uniqueness by allowing machines to invade purportedly I .

More than modern art museums, in the 1980s and early 1 990s exhibitions in specialized confer- ences such as SIGGRAPH and ISEA (International Symposium for Electronic Art), and the festival Ars Electrónica in Austria were influential for the development of computer art.

In contrast to criticism that has portrayed the exhibi- tion as politically reactionary, I suggest that it was compatible with aspects of progressive posthumanism. In her important 1999 study How We Became Posthuman, Katherine Hayles identifies two kinds of posthumanism, one that emphasizes vir- tualization and disembodiment, and another that recognizes the inseparability of consciousness from the specificities of embodiment.6 In her analysis, the first remains attached to liberal humanism in its adherence to notions of unified sub- jectivity and conscious agency as the bases for human identity, while the second understands subjectivity as emergent and contingent, and rather than perceiving technology as a threat to human control recognizes the historically long partner- ship between human and machine. I suggest that Reichardt's work, and especially Cybernetic Serendipity, manifests affinities with this second kind of posthumanism, reflecting a commitment to the unification of science and art that was consistent with her background as an art critic as well as with the philosophical objectives of her family The Exhibition Although it was neither the first exhibition to display computer art nor the first to promote the unification of science and art, Cybernetic Serendipity stands as one of the foundational events in the development of electronic and digital art. Three small shows of computer graphics in Stuttgart, Germany, and one at the Howard Wise Gallery in New York preceded it.7 Cybernetic Serendipity was unique in its focus on cybernetics, the theoretical backbone of the art- and- technology move- ment of the 1960s. Cybernetics, defined by Norbert Wiener as the science of communication and control between animals (humans included) and machines, and between machines and machines, created a framework for studying com- munication and control in systems organic and artificial.8 According to Wiener, the interaction of a machine with the external world involved the introduction of data (input) to elicit the machine's effect on the outside world (output). Feedback was the act of controlling a machine on the basis of its performance. Elements of the machine itself, which he called "sensory members," evaluated the machine's performance. The notions of control, communication, input, feed- back, and output as used in cybernetics were fundamental to the development of computer and other technological art. Reichardt's press release for the exhibition explained: A cybernetic device responds to stimulus from outside and in turn affects the external environment, like a thermostat which responds to the coldness of a room by switching on the heating and thereby altering the temperature. This process is called feedback. Exhibits in the show are either produced with a cybernetic device (computer) or are cybernetic devices themselves. They react to something in the environment, either human or machine, and in response produce either sound, light or movement. Unlike the other exhibitions focused on technology, Cybernetic Serendipity was experimental not only in the metaphorical sense that it explored new ideas, methods, and materials, but also because it was explicitly designed as an experi- 8 FALL 2008</page><page sequence="4">Installation view, Cybernetic Serendipity, Institute for Contemporary Art, London, 1 968, Hyman Kreitman Research Centre, TGA 955/ 1 8/2/2 (photographer unknown; photo- graph © Täte, London, 2008, provided by the ICA and Täte Archive) 9.

At the beginning of the 1960s, Reichardt had asserted that artistic production depended less on miracles than on firm principles and that consequently the effectiveness of art could be scientifically assessed.9 Aspects of this reasoning were evident in Cybernetic Serendipity even if, in contrast to a laboratory experiment, no attempts were made to record the results. As stated in its accompanying publication, the principal objective of the show was to explore and demonstrate in an international arena the relationships between technology and creativity; "to present an area of activity which mani- fests artists' involvement with science, and the scientists' involvement with the arts; also, to show the links between the random systems employed by artists, composers, and poets, and those involved with the making and use of cybernetic devices." IO The experimental character of the exhibition in a figurative sense was evident in Reichardt 's candid assessment that it dealt with "possibilities rather than achievements" because computers had yet to revolutionize music, art, and poetry in the same way that they revolutionized science. Simultaneously, in her opinion, Cybernetic Serendipity was "a demonstration of contemporary ideas, acts and objects, linking cybernetics and the creative process."11 I suggest that 9 art journal</page><page sequence="5">1 2.

A servomechanism, servo, or slave system is an automatic device that uses error-sensing or negative feedback to correct the performance of a larger mechanism. Cybernetic devices involve a variety of systems (hierarchical, distributed, complex, and others), which include peripheral sensory and central motor units. 20. One proposal included the composer Heitor Villa-Lobos (Brazil) and the writer William Burroughs (United States) as examples of artists who used random processes. This work was not included in the exhibition. Mozart presumably made the list thanks to his composition Musikalisches Würfelspiel (Musical Dice Game), by means of which a sixteen-bar minuet could be generated. Cage later collaborated with Lejaren Hiller on the large multimedia work HPSCHD ( 1 969), which is based on the Mozart work. 2 1 .

A harmonograph is a pendulum-driven graphic plotting device first built in the mid-nineteenth century. The resulting images are typically sequences of the harmonic curves known as Lissajoux curves. 22. See, for example, Roy Ascott, "Behaviourist Art and the Cybernetic Vision," in Telematic Embrace: Visionary Theories of Art, Technology, and Consciousness, ed. Edward A. Shanken (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2003), 109-56; Simon Penny, "From A to D and Back Again: The Emerging Aesthetics of Interactive Art," Leonardo Reichardt and her collaborators attempted empirically to substantiate these propositions by establishing specific controls in the exhibition design. Cybernetic Serendipity occupied a gallery of 6,£oo square feet in the new quar- ters of the ICA at Pall Mall and included the work of about 130 participants.12 Neither the wall texts nor the accompanying publication specified the discipli- nary affiliation of each contributor, making it difficult for a viewer to determine whether an artist, engineer, mathematician, musician, or architect created the object or the environment. This intentional confounding of boundaries left the responsibility for evaluating and classifying the work entirely to the viewer, encouraging the interrogation of stereotypes of the engineer and the artist. Reichardt elucidated: "It is assumed that the electronic engineers represent a clever but an uncreative branch of society, whereas artists are exceptionally cre- ative but it is unlikely that they should possess any technological skills. It is also widely assumed that to the engineer, scientist, and mathematician, art is magic, and to the composer, painter, and poet, technology is a mystery. . . . Today these categorical assumptions about our various talents, functions, and possibilities are less accurate than ever."13 The unlabeled objects provided a controlled situa- tion in the gallery for the viewer to reevaluate these preconceptions. Because the conclusions would be known only to the participant, the exhibition engaged scientific methodology without attempting to replicate it. The exhibition space was, then, neither a laboratory nor a traditional art gallery. In Reichardt 's opinion, no rules define the proper realm of art or technolo- gy; she found no reason works of art could not be based on "misunderstandings and partially digested information." I4 These attitudes implied that the transit of ideas from one field to another could result in transformations of the original notions or beget entirely new concepts - just as cybernetics, originally developed to optimize the operation of antiaircraft guns during World War II, was reconfig- ured to nonutilitarian purposes such as the generation of drawing, musical com- position, and poetry. By displaying the results of such reinterpretations, the exhi- bition called attention to the instability and permeability of disciplinary boundaries. Reichardt credits the German philosopher Max Bense for giving her the idea of organizing an exhibition of computer-based art. In 1965 Bense visited an exhibition of concrete poetry she had organized at the ICA, Between Poetry and Painting.15 Impressed by the show, he recommended that she look into computer art. l6 Reichardt first saw computer graphics in an American magazine entitled Computers and Automation, which since 1963 had sponsored an annual competition of computer art. I7 The work intrigued her, and she used the magazine to familiarize herself with the field and identify relevant institutions and individuals. After additional preliminary research and securing the collaboration of numerous institutions and individuals, she proposed the exhibition to the ICA.18 From the beginning, Reichardt envisioned Cybernetic Serendipity as an interna- tional event including a wide range of media: graphics, music, computer texts, films, robots, servomechanisms, chance games, and cybernetic devises.19 Pro- posed participants included the cybernetician Gordon Pask (England) ; the artists Nicholas Schöffer (France, b. Hungary) , Edward Ihnatowicz (England, b. Poland) , Takis (Greece) , Bruce Lacey (United Kingdom) , Jean Tinguely (Switzerland) , and Eugênio Carmi (Italy) ; and the composers John Cage (United States) , Karlheinz Stockhausen (Germany) , Iannis Xenakis (France, b. Romania) , and Wolfgang 10 FALL 2008</page><page sequence="6">Installation view, Cybernetic Serendipity, Institute for Contemporary Art, London, 1 968 (photographer unknown, photograph provided byjasia Reichardt).

Mozart.20 She conceived the exhibition as an interactive event in which the public's participation would be required. Proposals specified that visitors were expected to operate various cybernetic devices and to produce their own graph- ics alone or with the help of an assistant using various harmonographs that would be available within the exhibition.21 Some of the works necessitated spe- cific behavioral input from the participant in order to function. For instance, Ihnatowicz's Sound Activated Mobile (SAM) was an interactive electrohydraulic sculp- ture consisting of a four-petaled, flower-shaped, fiberglass "head" mounted on a custom-made, flexible aluminum skeleton. In response to sounds emitted by the visitors, a microphone mounted on each petal activated hydraulic pistons, caus- ing the body of the mobile to lean in the direction of the sound. Like SAM, some of the computer-based works demanded bodily activity from the participant - a focus on behavior has since received dedicated theoretical attention in the elabo- ration of aesthetic frameworks by media practitioners and scholars.22 According to Reichardt, the organization of Cybernetic Serendipity took place under economic limitations which in today's professional museum world would Electronic Almanac 4 , no. 4 (April 1996): n.p., avail- able online at http://leoalmanac.org/journal/ Vol_4/ lea_v4_nO4.txt; Simon Penny, "The Virtualization of Art Practice: Body Knowledge and the Engineering Worldview," Art Journal 56, no. 3 (Fall 1997): 30-38; Mark Hansen, New Philosophy for New Media (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2004); and Brian Massumi, Parables for the Virtual: Movement, Affect, Sensation (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2002).

She recalls that at the time she proposed the show, the ICA had five employees and a management committee that judged the proposals. The committee, consisting of "a musicologist, a pub- lisher, a poet, and an architect," welcomed her initiative: "They were happy that someone wanted to do something as adventurous and no one mentioned money." She sought support from relevant individuals in London, including sci- entists, arts benefactors, and businesspeople. In her recollection, with exception of the Arts Council, there were no offers of financial assistance, though there were offers of help and much encouragement.23 In 1968 Reichardt received a fellowship from the US State Department Council on Leaders and Specialists to travel to the United States for research. In the two-month duration of her visit she met with relevant artists and scientists, and obtained material for the exhibition. In Reichardt 's opinion, Cybernetic Serendipity was possible only because there was enormous enthusiasm for the subject: "Artists brought their work from America; no one paid them. No one expected money from an experiment."24 In her account, the exhibition resulted primarily from a spirit of collaboration among advisers, donors, and partici- pants. In addition to numerous academic researchers and artists, IBM, Boeing, General Motors, Westinghouse, and Bell Telephone Labs contributed material to the exhibition. 2S To install the show Reichardt relied on Mark Dowson, a free- lance electronics and system-design consultant who had long collaborated with Pask and his organization, Systems Research Ltd., as technological adviser. Peter Schmidt, a painter and a performer in electronic music, was music adviser. The painter and designer Franciszka Themerson was responsible for the exhibi- tion's design. In conjunction with the exhibition, Reichardt organized a biweekly lecture series in which specialists discussed the impact of computers in diverse realms of knowledge and practice, including painting, literature, music, communica- tion, psychology, and genetics. Every day a film made with the aid of computers or addressing the relevance of computer technology to the humanities, the arts, and communications was screened in the ICA exhibition hall. In Reichardt 's estimation, nearly sixty thousand people saw Cybernetic Serendipity.26 The show's success was aided by ICA-sponsored publicity and programming, which target- ed various publics. The organization's attempt to attract a diverse constituency is evident in press releases of the exhibition. The one signed by Reichardt out- lined the central notions of the exhibition, summarizing the history of the term "cybernetics" from its Greek origins to the present, explaining the notion of feedback and its significance to the displays, and defining serendipity as "the faculty of making happy chance discoveries," after Horace Walpole's coinage of the term in 175-4. To conclude, the text explained that in the context of the show, serendipity referred to the happy discoveries made through the use of cybernetics in various media.27 An unsigned press release distributed by the ICA appealed to families seeking to entertain young children. The contrast in the tone of the two documents could not have been greater. The anonymous press release was less concerned with the intellectual aspects of the exhibition than with its potential as entertainment. Because, like the anonymous author, many critics emphasized the popular-amusement character of the show, the text is worth quoting at length: 12 FALL 2008 23. Author interview with Reichardt. 24.

According to Michael Kustow, who was appointed executive director of the ICA in the spring pre- ceding the show, there were forty-five thousand visitors.

Needless to say, the kids adore it. From their ecstatic reaction to the auto- mated lit-up-computers, free-ranging robots, painting machines, sound domes, a complete electronic recording studio and a glorious Emmet parody of the transistorised world, tomorrow is already with us. One can foresee the day when computers will replace railway trains and airliners as the cult symbols of the under-twelves and it will become as vital to know the differ- ence between a Honeywell Mark IV and an IBM 800 as it is to distinguish between a Boeing and a Viscount. Meanwhile take the family to the ICA where they can push, pull, whistle, blow and yell at a gallery full of tame wonders which look as if they've come straight out of a Science Museum of the year 2000. 28 While Reichardt's release appealed to those interested in the intellectual sub- stance of the exhibition, the unsigned press release addressed fun- seeking fami- lies and novelty lovers. The anonymous author portrayed the show as a "dry run for the future" that offered the opportunity for children to familiarize them- selves with emerging technologies and for parents to accept the irreversible changes that those technologies would bring. According to the unnamed author, far from intimidating visitors, the works in the exhibition would habituate the family to the future through play, and the unsigned release inserted Cybernetic Serendipity into a preconceived course for the future of Britain. While some of the works in the exhibition supported these projections (the anthropomorphic robots might indeed encourage young children and their parents to approach the IBM mainframes) , this interpretation does not account for the inclusion of music, texts, or works in traditional media. The two ICA releases coincided only in their emphasis on pleasure, presented by Reichardt as the intellectual gratifica- tion associated with making "happy discoveries" and by the anonymous author as lighthearted family amusement.29 After its run at the ICA, Cybernetic Serendipity traveled to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC. An agreement between the ICA and the Smith- sonian specified that after the initial show at the Smithsonian, the exhibition would be sent to about ten museums and galleries in the United States over a period of two years. Each institution would pay a fee between $5,000 and $6,000, in addition to transportation, insurance, and packing. The ICA expected to earn about $65,000 from the tour. But in transit from England the exhibition suffered such a significant amount of damage that the Smithsonian's administra- tion decided to cancel the show, resulting in a considerable financial loss to the ICA from the cancellation of the exhibition and the projected tour, a loss which contributed to ongoing financial troubles at the ICA.30 The Corcoran Gallery in Washington agreed to take the exhibition and to repair some of the works with no fee to the ICA. But when the show was trans- ferred from the Smithsonian to the new location, two additional pieces, Nam June Paik's Robot K-456 and John Baker's Suspended Drawing Machine, were irreparably damaged.31 The Corcoran later offered to arrange for the show to travel, but due to these two catastrophic experiences, the ICA only allowed the exhibition to show at the Palace of Arts and Sciences (formerly the Palace of Fine Arts and later to become the Exploratorium) in San Francisco from mid-September to October 1 3 art journal 28.

As of December 1970, the exhibition was still on view.33 However, once its run in San Francisco was over, Cybernetic Serendipity once again met with mishap: as correspondence held in the ICA archives indicates, as late as October 1971 , the contents of Cybernetic Serendipity remained packed on the docks of San Francisco due to the docker's strike that summer. The delay and resultant inability to return the artists' works in a timely fashion caused considerable embarrassment to the ICA.34 In 1 97 1 two additional publications related to Cybernetic Serendipity were released, Reichardt's The Computer in Art, an overview of computer- generated work, especially graphics, and Cybernetics, Art, and Ideas, a collection of essays on philosophical and technical issues by various authors, including Jonathan Swift, John R. Pierce, Bense, and participants in Cybernetic Serendipity such as Pask, Xenakis, and Michael Noll. These publications became foundational to the study of digital art both because they examined relevant aesthetic and technical issues of computer art and because they included illustrations of early works.35 Reception The enormous popularity of Cybernetic Serendipity 's London run did not imply that the British art world understood it. Although reviewers in the popular press were overwhelmingly enthusiastic about the innovative and fun qualities of the exhi- bition, the opinions of art critics ranged from cautious evaluation to blatant incomprehension. Most critics agreed that the works presented in the exhibition were not art, but they expressed contradictory views as to why. They complained about the works' divergence from existing aesthetic forms in the same breath as they decried their lack of formal innovation. Others simply found technological complexity inappropriate for art. Some explicitly avoided discussing the show.36 This ambivalence suggests a fundamental discomfort with the principal premise of the show: the connection of technology with creativity. In an essay published in the Times Literary Supplement while Cybernetic Serendipity was on view, Jonathan Benthall discussed the potential of the art-and-technology movement but evaded the evaluation of specific exhibitions and individual works.37 Recognizing that the movement emerged in an artistic context in which traditional artistic values were being challenged, he feared that experi- mentation in art could lead to "mere novelty hunting, which can be accused at its worst of aiming at the jaded palate of a public that has lost the ability to tell good art from bad." He believed that in order to survive, art should operate within a culturally accepted genre: "When the public loses knowledge of a particular genre, or when (as in the case of some of the arts today) a whole spectrum of genres collapses, the artist is left in a difficult position." For techno- logical art to develop, he proposed greater economic support for the arts in general and the creation of a common theoretical framework for artists and tech- nicians. While Benthall supported the unification of science and art, he believed that technological art should cultivate established aesthetic norms. He did not seem to consider the possibility that technology could propel the development of new aesthetics. Despite his reservations, four years later Benthall published a &gt; 14 FALL 2008 32.

His principal dissatisfaction with the exhibition was the artists' focus on performativity rather than on the creation of original artistic forms. It is "as if no great effort had been made to find a unique form for the object. In this there is no suggestion of a double take, a Venus de Milo coming to shake hands for instance, but a weary reliance on the already exploited," he wrote.39 In his opinion, the artists did not bother to supersede the formal ideas of their predecessors but I 5 art journal 38.

He found Noll's computer- graphic variations of Piet Mondrian's paint- ings particularly offensive, and their failure only succeeded in showing the "alchemy" and force of Mondrian's compositions. He concluded: "The computer may be able not so much to enlarge our concepts of art as to widen immeasur- ably our knowledge of what is not art." The issue seemed to be that the marks of human creativity integral to formal innovation were lacking in mechanical devices and computer-generated art.40 The renowned art critic Guy Brett admired the exhibition's attempt to trans- gress disciplinary boundaries but regretted what he understood as its focus on entertainment. In his view, the art section of the exhibition was the least success- ful because it favored technical complexity before art. "Unlike a computer, a work of art does not need to be physically complex," he opined. "Art can create relationships in a very elementary form. But technical complexity has been one of the criteria behind selection of works for the ICA exhibition. . . .To put mech- anisms, the technique first, is surely to treat technology apart from both science and art."41 Like Benthall, Brett further suggested that the curator's predilection 16 FALL 2OO8 40. Ironically, in the publication associated with the show, Noll reported a study in which only 28 percent of participants were able correctly to identify the computer-generated picture while 59 percent preferred the computer-generated images. Because in this study the identity of the artist was irrelevant for the public's enjoyment of the work, Noll's results supported Reichardt's premises for Cybernetic Serendipity. A.

In these instances, the problem was not the work's technical complexity but its formal and technological anachronism. In summary, for Brett, the works in Cybernetic Serendipity were too technical to be good art and too old- fashioned (the anthropomorphic robots) to represent contemporary science. This conclusion suggests that even if he supported interdisciplinarity, he was pro- foundly ambivalent about the proper role of technology in either science or art. Brett was not alone in this mixed evaluation. Many other critics judged the music, texts, machines, and robots of Cybernetic Serendipity fit for a fun fair or a sci- ence museum and not for an art gallery, or found the achievements of artists in the field of science naive and unsophisticated, and similarly judged technologi- cally assisted art, comparing for instance, computer graphics to children's draw- ings. Technological art fell between the realms of art and technology - and was judged insufficient as each.42 The focus of Cybernetic Serendipity on the links between technology and creativity was especially irritating to art lovers, as this association threatened one of the strongest pillars of humanism. In popular humanist narratives, creativity is an attribute of genius, the highest distinction of the human. Where in art, techne as craft or skill is highly valued, technologies are often regarded as tools, instruments or means to ends with implicit acceptance of human mastery over the means. In response to such understandings of tech- nology, the philosopher Bruno Latour advances the argument that without tech- nology the properly human would not exist. For him, the imagination is inti- mately entwined with technologies, for these "bombard human beings with a ceaseless offer of previously unheard-of positions - engagements, suggestions, allowances, interdictions, habits, positions, alienations, prescriptions, calcula- tions, memories."43 Instead of stressing mastery over technology, Latour calls for the recognition of a common history of humans, tools, and machines. In such a history, creativity and the arts, as Reichardt posited, would be inextricably enmeshed with technology. Local businesspeople responded to Cybernetic Serendipity with no more enthusi- asm than the art critics. On September 4, 1968, the ICA's honorary director, Sir Roland Penrose, wrote to the earl of Snowdon, a supporter of the exhibition, to inform him that he planned to organize a cocktail party at the ICA followed by a tour of the gallery with the intention of attracting the support of industrialists, especially those connected to electronics. Former ICA director Dorothy Morland took over the arrangements for the party. In a letter to John Blake, Deputy Head, Industrial Division, Council of Industrial Design, dated October ·ι , 1968, Morland reported, "The replies so far are rather disappointing - 20 acceptances and 60 refusals - but there is time to improve." The party was held on the evening of Monday, October 14. Despite Morland 's distribution of extra invita- tions to selected guests to encourage them to include additional people, the event had dismal attendance.44 Most critics had judged the work according to criteria appropriate to traditional visual media; businesspeople, perhaps influ- enced by the critics, demonstrated indifference to the exhibition.45 1 7 art journal 42.

It is not accidental that most of the canonical works of digital art of the last twenty years have seldom been exhibited in art museums and that references to the field have been deleted from the history of modern and contemporary art.

In a recent analysis, the scholar Rainer Usselmann argues that Cybernetic Serendipity 's main flaw was its lack of criticality and historicity. In this context, historicity for Usselmann means the recognition of the military ancestry of computer technologies as well as the connection between the industrial companies that supported the show and the ongoing war efforts. He suggests that the silence around these issues indicated the ICA's support for the Labor Prime Minister Harold Wilson's Utopian technological vision for the future of Britain and the agenda of the National Computing Centre (NCC) to increase computer usage in the United Kingdom. In his words, Cybernetic Serendipity "offered a lighthearted view of the modern world without raising too many (if any) objections or stir- ring fears. Rather than focus on the technocratic or plainly vacuous elements in Wilson's vision, the exhibition merged science and technology with great enter- tainment and a dash of art. . . . Perhaps for the first time it could be considered to be 'cool' to be involved with computers."46 Drawing from the work of the media scholar Brian Winston, Usselmann associates social apathy with the technological arts because, in his view, unlike traditional media such as painting and sculpture, these arts are linked to commercial imperatives.47 To be sure, Cybernetic Serendipity made no overt political critique. But the exhi- bition's inclusion of military and commercial technologies for creative ends leads to more than Usselmann 's unambiguous conclusion that it supported reac- tionary politics. In her 1985 "Manifesto for Cyborgs," Donna Haraway argued for the political necessity of eradicating the "leaky distinction among humans, ani- mals, and machines."48 In her assessment, while from one perspective a cyborg future could result in permanent warfare and "a final imposition of a grid of control on the planet," from another perspective it might result in a world in which people would accept partial identities, contradictions, and "their joint kinship with animals and machines." Haraway further stresses the importance of being able to take in both perspectives at once as, in her opinion, single vision produces "worse illusions than double visions of many-headed monsters."49 Cybernetic Serendipity omitted mention of animals, yet, as in Haraway 's second pro- jection for a cyborg future, the machines displayed in the exhibition certainly partook in human creativity, pleasure, and play. This focus in turn suggested an alternative to the stability and wholeness of the humanist subject. Reichardt says that she did not read the reviews. In her opinion, reviews are important only as part of history. "There was a shiver down my spine every time I went in [the exhibition] , so I knew it was good." She was already planning her next show, entitled Fluorescent Chrysanthemum (new Japanese art, music, and films) , at the ICA, London, for 1 968-69. s° Like Haraway, Reichardt advocated for plea- sure in the confusion of boundaries. This attitude would be reiterated in other projects in Reichardt 's career. I 8 FALL 2008 46. Usselmann, 393.

Author interview with Reichardt.</page><page sequence="14">The Curator Reichardt left the ICA in 1971 and from 1974 to 1976 she directed the White- chapel Gallery in London; in addition to her official posts, she maintained an active career writing, teaching, lecturing, and curating. Reichardt curated more than thirty exhibitions, published six books, edited a series of thirteen mono- graphs on contemporary artists entitled Art in Progress (London, Methuen, 1962- 66) , and authored over fifty essays on topics including contemporary European Jasia Reichardt in 1 968 (photographer unknown, photograph provided by Jasia Reichardt) and American art, art and technology, and Latin American art. She also penned monthly columns in periodicals such as Apollo (1960-63), Studio International (1965-69), Architectural Design (1960-79), Art d'aujourd'hui (1962-66), New Scientist (1971-74), and Building Design (1982-88). As a tutor at the Architectural Association school of architecture in London (1973-74 and 1977-81), Reichardt developed a twelve-part lecture series explor- ing the relationships of art and science as well as a lec- ture on robots.51 In her book of 1978, Robots: Fact, Fiction, and Prediction, she mapped historical precedents of robots in the automata of previous centuries and the presence of robots in fiction, toys, children's literature, and movies, as well as in domestic, learning, and military realms. Cognizant of the complicated affective relations between humans and technology, she referred to robots as "sentient machines" that had "already invaded the majority of human activi- ties: literature, film, art, sex, comics, play, war, teaching, medicine, industry, and science."52 Various parts of the texts explored affective issues, including "the feel- ings of robots" and the future of notions of human exceptionalism in light of the development of artificial intelligence. Thus, like Cybernetic Serendipity, this work had prescient affinities with posthumanism. But Reichardt 's interest in these subjects was unusual in the 1960s; as the choreographer Deborah Hay, a participant in 9 Evenings, described it, the techno- logical art of the 1960s was "a very masculine thing."53 The scarcity of women working in the field during the 1960s and 1970s corroborates this assertion. How, then, was it possible for a young woman curator to become so passionately interested in the relation of science and art? Reichardt attributes her involvement with these subjects to the intellectual interests of her own family. She was born in Poland in 1933, but after the Second World War she joined her aunt and uncle, Franciszka and Stefan Themerson, in England. Stefan was an experimental filmmaker and thinker, Franciszka, the eventual exhibition designer for Cybernetic Serendipity, a painter, illustrator, and theater designer. As young artists in Poland, the couple had already been influen- tial in vanguard artistic circles, producing experimental films, collages, and photograms, founding a filmmakers' cooperative, writing children's books, and editing a film review, f.a.: Film artystyczny, film artistique, the artistic film.54 The Themersons settled in England in 1944 and in 1948 founded the Gaberbocchus Press, dedicated to translating and publishing avant-garde works. Their publications included English translations and editions (often the first) 1 9 art journal 5 1 . Her lecture titles include "Sometimes Art Is Useful in Science," "Art as a Record of Subjects of Scientific Interest," "The Aesthetic in Science," "Optical Illusions," "Electronics and Cybernetics," and "Unfair to Robots." 52.

Their objective was to provide artists, poets, musicians, scientists, writers, and theater people with a convivial space to meet and exchange views on subjects related to "the philosophy of science and the philosophy of art." The invitation to the Common Room, written in August of 1957, explained: We don't identify science with gadgetry, nor art with a kind of romantic irresponsibility. We would rather prefer to see both sides as investigators and explorers of the universe, whether the part of the universe that is being explored is the nebula in Andromeda or a molecule, or the constellation of 20 FALL 2008 55.

It seems that the artificial barrier dividing science from the arts is becoming obsolete, and it may be worthwhile to try to ignore it. This is an attitude to which we feel an urge to contribute, not so much because we want to fulfill a particular programme as because it promises to be interesting, fruitful and a pleasure.56 Like Cybernetic Serendipity ten years later, the invitation identified commonalities in the creative experience of artists and scientists and called attention to the plea- sure of unexpected discoveries. It was at the Common Room that Reichardt, then in her early twenties, first learned about cybernetics. The Themersons' philoso- phy would have a lasting influence on Reichardt 's work. For Stefan Themerson, cosmopolitanism was an attitude that could be culti- vated by individuals anywhere on the planet, and not the domain of a single class or culture.57 This posture also was evident in Reichardt 's activities as an organizer and editor. As assistant director of the ICA, her duties included pro- gramming events and editing the monthly ICA Bulletin. A review of this magazine between 1964 and 1970 reveals a diversity of programming rare for the period: ICA events included not only contemporary European and American art, but also art, poetry, architecture, and music from the Caribbean, Africa, Asia, and Latin America. A fascination with boundaries and with what is excluded from demar- cated territories is consistent with her inter displinary approach to art. When asked about her inclusive approach, Reichardt simply responds that it came naturally to her. "What has always interested me is what happens on the borderlines," she explains. "If art is a country, what happens at the edges, towards literature, 2 1 art journal 56.

An exception in the sense that there are no masterpieces to be associated with them, nevertheless, these two movements have a unique significance both socially and artistically. The first of these is Concrete Poetry and the second, Computer Art. The salient points are that both these movements are international, that they are moti- vated by the use of media, technique and method, rather than an ideology, and those participating in them come from a variety of professions, disci- plines and walks of life.59 As with the exhibitions that Reichardt organized at the ICA on each of these two movements, this statement declared a commitment to internationalism as well as ■&gt; 22 FALL 2OO8 58.

The exhibition took place at the Royal National Eisteddfod of Wales, Flint, August 4-9, 1 969, and at the ICA November 28, 1 969-February 15, 1970. 6 1 . A Gallup poll designed by Reichardt in con- nection with the exhibition to investigate the play preferences of one hundred children and one hundred adults was cancelled after six weeks because the adults failed to understand the sur- vey's purpose. Similarly, of twelve thousand copies of a questionnaire on the subject of play distributed in the April 1 969 issue of the ICA's event sheet, only one recipient replied. See Play Orbit catalogue. a conviction that the minor, what is in between or excluded from established art practices, can be both unique and socially significant. The passage also makes clear her predilection for varied media, methods, and techniques over formally consistent groupings. Similar inclinations were evident in her exhibition Play Orbit, which opened at the Royal National Eisteddfod of Wales in August 1969 and later traveled to the ICA in London.60 Intended to narrow the gap between works of art and "those other things which fill our environment," the exhibition displayed "toys, games and playables" designed by visual artists and designers. Initially, one hundred artists were invited to submit works and to provide a definition of the term "toy." Subsequently, an open invitation was extended to any artist wishing to partici- pate. The only stipulations were that the work should not exceed six feet in any dimension and that fragile materials should be avoided. The format precluded a homogeneous aesthetic - Reichardt described it as "the most democratic exhibi- tion ever held in this country." Professional artists and art students participated. In the catalogue to the exhibition, Reichardt classified and illustrated multi- ple kinds of toys, historical and current, and integrated in a single volume a multidisciplinary collection of theoretical essays on the concept of play. The authors included Blaise Pascal, Charles Baudelaire, Johan Huizinga, Roger Callois, Claude Lévi Strauss, Lewis Carroll, and Lewis Mumford. Albeit play is usually associated with children, Reichardt specified no age limit for the toys in Play Orbit, and the catalogue explained that rather than enter- taining children "the purpose of the exercise was to prod the imagination of adults." This inclusivity implicitly cast play as an underdeveloped realm of adult experience, even if such a suggestion was enigmatic to the audience.61 Both Cybernetic Serendipity and Play Orbit encouraged visitors to interact with nonhuman entities (objects and machines) and interrogated the boundaries between pleasure and play. As with later currents of posthumanism, Cybernetic Serendipity and others of Reichardt 's projects offered important avenues for think- ing about the inter relatedness of humans and machines. For theorists such as Hay les, Latour, and Haraway, the survival of our planet depends on affirming these interconnections and recognizing a shared history. The exclusion of Cybernetic Serendipity from the history of modern art as well as the paucity of information in the literature of digital art about its curator demonstrates that although computer art and the recognition of computers and women in art have come far, to achieve the cyborgian consciousness of a com- mon history there is yet a long way to go. Jasia Reichardt should figure in the history of art as a prescient curator who endeavored to create in the museum a common ground for science, art, technology, creativity, pleasure, and play.
