It examines an emerging citizens' movement in Japan which aims to improve social welfare services in its region. A particular movement event, the International Forum, demonstrates the significance of symbol and ritual in understanding the formation of collective identity in the leaders' attempts to mobilize participants. Re recently, the social movement literature has begun to recognize the importance of participant mobilization, particularly the formation of group identity and the genera tion of meaning, as key conceptual tools in bridging the gap between macro and micro perspectives on the development of social movements (Klandermans 1991; Melucci 1988). This reflects a concern with social movements as process, linking group action with individual experience in the social construction of protest. This article presents a case study of an emerging social movement in Japan which was concerned with improving government provision of social welfare services to its citizens. We were invited to participate in a major event of this movement, the International Forum on Civil Participation in Social Welfare, which took place over one week in the summer of 1990. Through this event, movement leaders hoped to re 'Address correspondence to Susan Orpett Long, Department of Sociology, John Carroll University, Cleveland, Ohio 44118. The authors would like to express their appreciation to the organizers of the International Forum on Civil Participation in Welfare for the invitation to participate in this movement event and their willingness to answer our continuous questions during and after the Forum. We acknowledge the valuable suggestions of three anonymous reviewers on an earlier draft of this paper. Helpful comments were also obtained from audiences at the University of Missouri St. Louis-Washington University East Asian Colloquium and at the panel on social movements at the Annual Meeting of the Society for Applied Anthropology. Discussions of Japanese festivals with Ronald Toby, Professor of Japanese History at the University of Illinois, contributed to our understanding of this ritual form.

Most of the social movement research up to now has concerned itself with European and American social movements. Our research expands this work to include an industrialized but non-Western society ? Japan. The domination of the literature by studies of the industrialized West has led to the suggestion by Calhoun (1991), who has similarly described a social movement in an East Asian setting, that "certain dis tinctive features of modern Western culture ? notably an instrumental notion of self and neglect of the idea of honor ? hinder our ability to grasp the centrality of the problem of identity in collective action" (Calhoun 1991, p. 54). In our work, concepts from the macro, micro, and participant mobilization/identity approaches to social movement development made important contributions to our understanding of this Japanese movement. But the advantage of research in a non-Western setting was that it provided us with cultural distance, giving us the opportunity to develop further in sights into the role of symbols and ritual in the formation of collective identity and the construction of meaning (Melucci 1989). The purpose of this paper is three-fold: 1) to examine how macro-political, so cial, and economic processes created the opportunity for collective activity to take place in a Japanese social welfare movement (preconditions of the movement); 2) to analyze why microsociological factors such as organizational structure, networks, ide ology and commitment are related to participant mobilization in this social movement; and 3) to explain further how culturally specific rituals and symbols were used as mo bilization techniques to recruit members and to create a sense of group identity. The relevant conceptual frameworks will be discussed and then the case study presented. This will be followed by our analysis drawing upon the theoretical concepts to aid in further explicating participant mobilization, particularly the formation of collective identity, in this Japanese social movement. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK A commonly utilized framework in recent American sociology for understanding social movements has been that of resource mobilization. Resource mobilization theory focuses on the macro-political and social structural dynamics that impact on how a so cial movement develops. A principal goal of this theory is to understand how the emerging movement organization seeks to mobilize and routinize its flow of resources (McAdam, McCarthy and Zald 1988). Mobilization is a process in which an organiza tion secures control over the various resources needed for collective group action (Jenkins 1983). Thus, the emphasis is not on a social psychological approach to move ment formation, focusing on individual motivations for joining a movement, but on the social structural processes that contribute to organizational development (McCarthy and Zald 1977). Participation in the movement is seen as a rational, planned decision making process based on the utilitarian incentive model of weighing the relative costs and benefits to an individual of joining an organization (McCarthy and Zald 1973, 1977). As critics of this theory have pointed out, a weakness in this conceptualization is that it does not see purposive incentives as an important factor in the development</page><page sequence="3">FESTIVAL FOR A CAUSE 49 of social movement organizations, which are instrumental in the creation of group sol idarity. Participant mobilization is a key resource that can not be explained only from a cost-benefit, individual material incentive perspective (Fireman and Gamson 1979; Moe 1980). Thus, revisionist resource mobilization theorists (Klandermans 1984; Hirsch 1986; Ferree and Millet 1985) have urged an integration into mobilization the ory, some aspects of classical social psychological social movement theory (Turner and Killian 1986; Smelser 1963) that recognized the importance of microsocial factors such as values, ideology, and commitment among movement joiners as necessary elements in mobilizing people to participate in movements. In contrast to the resource mobilization theory, the new social movements ap proach developed by European scholars seeks to understand the growth of social movements since the 1960s by focusing on grievances and aspirations. The emphasis has been on the structural origins of change: in particular values, constituency, new aspirations, and loss of identity (Klandermans and Tarrow 1988). Social movements such as the environmental movement, the women's movement, and the antinuclear movement, are no longer based in the "natural" identity of economic class, but must engage in a process of constructing a collective identity (Melucci 1989; Touraine 1981). This paradigm enables researchers to examine the processes through which collective actors create the identity and solidarity they are representing (Klandermans 1989; Cohen 1985). Critics of this approach believe the one-sided focus on structural origins of strain neglects the "how" of mobilization, by assuming that social movements will materialize automatically if demand exists (Klandermans 1991). Moreover, the new social movements approach overstates the differences between contemporary move ments and collective action in the past (Calhoun 1991:52). Both paradigms leave a gap between the structural determinants of social movements and individual participation in the movements. What is missing as Klandermans and Tarrow (1988) and Melucci (1988) stress is a clear theoretical and empirical analysis of mobilization processes that intervene between structural trans formations and the actors that create collective action. It is this relationship between structure and cultural factors ? values, beliefs and meanings, and identification with social movements ? that is the missing link in understanding the development of so cial movements (Snow and Benford 1988). Participant mobilization is a process by which individuals move from being po tentially involved in a movement to making a commitment to it (Klandermans 1989). The problem for social movements is to create a new culture with which participants identify. This is accomplished by giving new definitions to and integrating elements of past and present cultural traditions into a new, coherent interpretation of reality (Melucci 1992). A number of concepts have been proposed that deal with different lev els of this mobilization process: consensus mobilization (Klandermans 1988, 1991), frame alignment (Snow and Benford 1988), and collective identity (Melucci 1988, 1989). In our paper, we will present a case study of a Japanese social welfare move ment. In order to fully understand the movement's participant mobilization processes, we need to combine elements from all three theoretical perspectives discussed above.</page><page sequence="4">50 SOCIOLOGICAL FOCUS CASE STUDY We now turn to the case study of the International Forum on Civil Participation in Welfare, an event that is part of a grass-roots citizen's movement in its early stages, aimed at improving welfare services in Shiga prefecture, Japan. We became aware of the social welfare movement when a Japanese colleague asked us to present papers at the International Forum on Civil Welfare in the summer of 1990. Expecting a profes sional conference, we did not realize until we arrived that we would become part of a social movement. Shiga prefecture is located in central Japan, surrounding Japan's largest inland lake, Lake Biwa. The 4,016 square kilometer prefecture, ringed by mountains, had a population in 1986 of 1,167,000. Although adjacent to the large city of Kyoto, agricul ture remains a major occupation. Industrial development due to the prefecture's prox imity to the Kyoto-Osaka area and to the resources of Lake Biwa has occurred, espe cially in the southern portion of the prefecture. The organizers of this social movement hoped to develop a sense of collective identity based on ideas of community responsibility for the welfare of the prefecture's citizens, but they faced several barriers. The prefecture has long had an identity as a political-administrative unit, but its large size and separation of east and west by Lake Biwa are barriers to a prefecture-wide sense of community. Moreover, historically welfare activities have been the responsibility of families and thus not seen as a community-wide or prefecture-wide concern. This citizen's social welfare movement can be understood in the larger context of Japanese citizen's movements. Citizen's movements provide informal channels of political participation with goals of resolving local problems that affect the well-being of ordinary citizens (McKean 1981). They represent grass-roots political mobilization organized by local leaders to protest grievances against established authority, and have been recognized as a legitimate political form in Japan since the 1960s (Broadbent 1986, 1989; Matsushita 1975; Sala 1975; Shiobara and Katagiri 1986; Takabatake 1975). The history of this particular citizen's social welfare movement, stems back to 1980 when an association of welfare workers and other community leaders began to meet regularly in Otsu, the largest city in the prefecture. In 1986, they made a deci sion to help raise funds for a local school for severely handicapped children. Someone suggested that as a community fund raiser people hold hands around Lake Biwa, Japan's largest inland body of water in the center of the prefecture, with a circumfer ence of 188 km. Each participant would pay a fee of 1000 yen (approximately $8). This suggestion, that apparently started out as a joke during a meeting, became this group's first participant mobilization event. An organization was formed and its leaders identified. Collective action was coordinated with the support of over 200 coop erating organizations such as school PTAs, local welfare organizations, civic clubs, and religious organizations. Sponsors included local governments as well as the Japan Railways and Radio Osaka. The "Embrace Lake Biwa" event on November 8, 1987 gained national recognition through media coverage, had 212,900 participants and raised over five hundred thousand dollars for the school for handicapped children.</page><page sequence="5">FESTIVAL FOR A CAUSE 51 In May of 1988 leaders of the Embrace Lake Biwa event met to discuss how to use the success of their participant mobilization effort to further their shared concern for social welfare in Shiga prefecture. National governmental policy refused responsi bility for extensive social welfare programs, shifting the burden of such services to pre fecture and local governments. This group believed that growing welfare needs of the population were not being met, and believed that the expression of prefecture-wide concern would be the most effective way to begin to improve welfare services. They de cided that their next event would be an International Forum on Civil Welfare to be held in August, 1990. THE INTERNATIONAL FORUM ON CIVIL WELFARE The International Forum on Civil Welfare, the event in which we were involved, took place in Shiga prefecture from August 28 through September 2, 1990. This six day event was the result of two years of planning subsequent to the successful "Embrace Lake Biwa" fundraiser. Participants paid a fee of Y1000 (approximately $8) to attend as many of the programs as they wished during the six days, but paid extra for food. The program schedule is presented in Table 1. Each day's activities were held in a different city or town in the prefecture. Each town had its local organization which was responsible for selecting the social welfare theme and developing an appropriate program for its community. Activities included lectures, a songfest, and a dramatic performance. Some participants attended only the program in their own communities, but many traveled to other locations as well on other days of the Forum. The 1990 International Forum had a number of goals: 1) to raise money to be used for social welfare concerns in the local community, concerns were now broadened to include the needs of the elderly and the disabled population, as well as children (resource mobilization); 2) to recruit new members, with the specific goal of adding 1000 more members to the movement (formation and activation of recruitment net works); 3) to bring together other groups in the community which were concerned with similar issues (arousal of motivation to participate); 4) to educate the public at large about the welfare needs of the disabled in the community (arousal of motivation to participate); and 5) to provide an enjoyable entertaining atmosphere in which com munity members could join together and thus create feelings of group solidarity (formation of collective identity). ANALYSIS This emerging social movement in Japan provides the opportunity to explore the relationships among various theoretical concepts, to assess their validity in a non Western setting, and to delineate more clearly the processes of mobilization that took place. The following section examines movement development on three levels. 1) Taking concepts from resource mobilization theory, we document the macro-political, social, and economic processes that created the opportunity for collective activity to take place (preconditions of the movement). 2) Utilizing microsociological concepts (revisionist resource mobilization theory and new social movement theory), weinves</page><page sequence="6">52 SOCIOLOGICAL FOCUS TABLE 1 PROGRAM SCHEDULE FOR THE INTERNATIONAL FORUM ON CIVIL PARTICIPATION IN WELFARE August 28, Otsu City, 1-6 p.m. at the campus of a private university.

MACROSOCIOLOGICAL FORCES McAdam, McCarthy, and Zald (1988) emphasize that in the analysis of social movement emergence, processes operating at both macro and micro levels must be taken into account. This section summarizes the macro forces that were relevant in the emergence of this Japanese citizens' social welfare movement, processes that cre ated the opportunity for collective activity to take place. The forces most relevant to this case study are: economic prosperity, demographic changes, and levels of prior organization (McAdam et al. 1988). Prosperity McCarthy and Zald (1977) have identified prosperity as a precondition for social movement activity. Although social movement activity has occurred throughout hu man history, wealthy societies promote the general conditions that favor the emer gence of the new movements which are not based on immediate economic needs. Japan has recently emerged as a new world power with considerable financial resources. In our interviews with key leaders of the Japanese civil welfare movement, one factor that was reiterated was that Japan now was financially sound and could devote money and time to the development of social welfare services. Demographic Changes Besides the macro-economic and political processes, McCarthy and Zald (1977) also point out the importance of the internal structure of the population that exerts pressure and influences whether a movement will arise. In this area the two major demographic forces are (1) the growing elderly population coupled with (2) the in creased number of women entering the labor force, adding to the pressure for in creased welfare services to the elderly and needy children. The geographic concentra tion of people also has an important impact upon social interaction which is a crucial variable in membership recruitment. The Elderly. In 1950 approximately 5% of the Japanese population were 65 years or older. In Japan today, 12% of the population, nearly 15 million people, are 65 and older. The elderly are expected to constitute about 24% of the population by 2020 and then stabilize to 23% or 31 million people (Japan, Office of the Prime Minister 1989). With these changing demographics come changing needs of the elderly popula tion as there is a positive correlation between age and chronic health care problems. Women in the Labor Force. In Japan 47% of women over the age of 15 participated in the paid labor force in 1989 (Japan, Office of the Prime Minister 1989). There have been two major changes in the female work force. First is the movement away from household-based employment and second is the increased participation of</page><page sequence="8">54 SOCIOLOGICAL FOCUS married women in the labor force which may have an effect on their availability to care for dependent family members. Therefore, an increased interest in and demand for social welfare services has arisen. Level of Prior Organization The level of prior organization in a given society can enhance the occurrence of successful collective action. For the Japanese, as in other industrialized societies, or ganizational life is an integral part of their lives. Japanese children are socialized to work and play in groups in day care centers, schools, and clubs. In adulthood, family and hierarchically organized workplace relationships structure social life. Japan is not unique in having such groups, but in contrast to the U.S., mainstream ideology in Japan deemphasizes individualism and emphasizes hierarchical group structure, and values interpersonal relations, loyalty, and solidarity. Numerous studies have sup ported the notion that the higher the density of social organization in a society, the more likely that it will be that social movements will occur (McAdam 1982; McAdam et al. 1988). MICROSOCIOLOGICAL FORCES Revisionist resource mobilization and new social movement theorists have ac knowledged the importance of macro factors such as those identified above, but have focused their analyses on the social structural and social psychological aspects of movement development. Many of the features they identify can be seen in the Japanese case study we have described. Structure and Leadership Recent discussions of new social movement organization have noted their de pendency on other organizations which are embedded in or allied with the social movement (Klandermans 1989, pp. 301-314). Both major events of this movement, Embrace Lake Biwa and the International Forum, coordinated the activities of nu merous groups such as PTAs, women's groups, and religious organizations. Movement organization resembled the "SPIN-organizations" (segmented, polycephalous, interac tion networks) first described by Gerlach and Hine (1970). A SPIN-organization is composed of a number of autonomous groups which are organizationally independent. Coordination is secured by overlapping membership and friendship ties and by the general ideology of the organization. The coordination is horizontal rather than vertical. The participants are bound together by ideological commitment. The organizational decision making is collective (Gundelach 1984, p. 1,065). The autonomous groups in this case were the local level organizations which participated in organizing the Lake Biwa event, or came together as a result of partic ipating in it. All shared the commitment to improving welfare services in the prefec ture, although their emphasis on which services were most necessary and who should supply the services differed.</page><page sequence="9">FESTIVAL FOR A CAUSE 55 This growing social movement organization developed two levels of leadership, one on a local community level and one on a movement organizational level. Although an Executive Committee for the International Forum was formed which included business, professional, and community leaders, the core of the day-to-day leadership of the movement was made up of people working in the health, education, and social ser vice sectors. The International Forum had three main leaders. The "General Affairs" man ager of the International Forum who had chaired the Lake Biwa event was president of a local consumers' cooperative (see Crump 1987 on social welfare activities of Japanese consumers' cooperatives); the "Director" of the Forum, also a key leader in the Lake Biwa event, was director of an orphanage; and the "Secretary" was a woman who was coordinating a day care program for the elderly who had formerly been em ployed by the prefectural welfare department. Each had a specific role in planning for and carrying out the International Forum: organizational planner, fundraiser, and chief of daily operations, respectively. All were committed to the generalized belief that welfare services to the most needy in society ? orphaned or handicapped chil dren, the elderly, and the disabled ? needed to be drastically increased and that the prefectural government was not being sufficiently responsive to this need. Each leader, through his or her network of friends, contacts, and employees, recruited members into the organization. As in the SPIN-organizations described for social movements elsewhere, these leaders coordinated their activities rather than developed a vertical leadership structure. The Executive Committee also included local level leaders who represented the autonomous groups making up the movement. When movement leaders began making plans for the International Forum, they delegated responsibility for defining the con tent and format of the Forum to these local leaders. Thus, each day's activities in the International Forum represented a process of consensus building at the local level as to the welfare needs of their community, a process of building solidarity among local leaders, and a defining of the type of program that would appeal to local residents and thus draw them into the movement. Movement and local leaders met regularly for the purposes of planning participant mobilization. Process Revisionist resource mobilization and new social movement theorists have been concerned with the processes that create such organizational structures. In particular, they have identified networking, consensus-building (ideology), and the development of commitment as significant elements of the larger process of participant mobilization (Klandermans 1989, pp. 117-128). Networking. Zurcher and Snow (1981) stress the important bridging function of social networks. These already established interpersonal ties form the initial bridge to bring potential group members and active group participants together. Gerlach and Hine (1970) in their study of religious cults found that for new group members the first contact with the movement was often the result of their preexisting overlapping social networks. This critical mobilization role of social networks was also a key factor in the group organization of this Japanese citizens' movement. A number of the key</page><page sequence="10">56 SOCIOLOGICAL FOCUS organizers had been schoolmates together or had been active together in other social organizations. Thus, there was an overlapping of social networks and interpersonal ties. One's ties and contacts, especially in Japanese society, are of utmost importance in professional careers and personal lives, and are the usual means of introduction to new people. Consensus Building. Zurcher and Snow (1981) have identified ideology as an other microsociological factor that impacts upon participant mobilization. It provides the picture of what the new world should look like and what is wrong with the present system. It is the sine qua non precipitant of collective action. Yet such ideology is not pre-existent. Its development is a process of consensus formation that is a major com ponent of the development of the social movement (Klandermans 1988). During our involvement with this Japanese social welfare movement, the mem bers were actively involved in writing their doctrine of social action. Key leaders had already devoted long hours to hashing out their mutual goals, but the official consen sus and the wording of a "declaration" was one of the major tasks they had set out to accomplish by the end of the week's events. Development of Commitment. Commitment is the key to explain the sustained participation of a member in the social movement organization. Levels of commitment vary greatly. A high level of staying power in the movement is a function of how well linked the person's world view and priorities are with that of the goals and ideology of the movement (Zurcher and Snow 1981). A committed member will have internalized the central core ideas of the movement into his or her belief system, a process which involves the construction of meaning discussed in the following section. At the time that we were involved in participant-observation of this Japanese social welfare movement, the recruitment and commitment of new members was a strategic goal of the group's leaders. From the perspective of the individual, Klandermans (1989, pp. 119-124) sug gests that commitment comes about through a four stage process: being potentially committed (mobilization potential), becoming a target of mobilization attempts, be coming motivated to participate, and overcoming barriers to participation. Commitment means being highly motivated enough to overcome barriers to participa tion. The Japanese movement's International Forum on Civil Participation in Welfare was working at several stages of the process simultaneously. Leaders were at tempting to expand the segment of the population that represented mobilization potential by actively working to attract media involvement (Gamson 1992) and the participation of various existing local groups, including local governments. At another level, the movement leaders were also trying to actively motivate people who had become targets of mobilization attempts to become committed participants in the movement, in other words, trying to move people from Klandermans' second to third stage. They did this by defining their welfare agenda broadly enough to be salient to many people. In the International Forum, they also combined entertainment, education, and the sharing of personal experiences in order to move the participants toward a greater sense of commitment.</page><page sequence="11">FESTIVAL FOR A CAUSE 57 Construction of Meaning: Ritual and Symbols Examining the participant mobilization of a social movement from these macro and micro perspectives leaves unanswered the question of how these processes take place at the level of the individual. Gamson (1992, p. 1) notes that, "the trick for ac tivists is to bridge public discourse and people's experiential knowledge, integrating them in a coherent frame that supports and sustains collective action." This "trick" is the construction of meaning, an area which has not received systematic attention until recently (Klandermans 1989, p. 11). Culture refers to a relatively coherent system of meanings by which people interpret the world. However, these meanings, expressed in symbol and ritual, are not fixed. They are open to continual reinterpretation, negotiation, and manipulation. Melucci (1989) emphasizes that contemporary social movements are cultural phenomena, processes of symbolization. They challenge complex systems primarily on symbolic rather than political or economic grounds. Participation in social movements can no longer be considered merely a means to an end, but symbolic behavior in and of itself that sends messages to others in the society. The construction of collective identity, the process of creating movement "culture" or "subculture," involves three elements: cognitive, social, and emotional (Melucci 1989, 1992), which can be separated only analytically. Identity is at once personal and collective (Calhoun 1991, p. 55). New definitions are produced by in tegrating the past and emerging elements of the present cognitively and emotionally, by means of the social process of collective activity. Concepts utilized by other social movement theorists such as morality, metaphor (Jasper 1991), ritual, and narrative (Pine 1992) aid in understanding the construction of collective identity. The analysis presented in this paper focuses on the importance of ritual, re peated symbolic behavior. All of the above terms deal with the symbolic, but only rit ual bridges the gap between concept and action, the very gap that must be bridged for the construction of collective identity to occur. While Melucci identifies the significance of symbolic communication in cultural reinterpretation, he does not deal explicitly with the roles of ritual. Pine (1992, pp. 14 15) sees ritual as a cultural tool in which action cements loyalty to the group and legit imates its calls for commitment and assistance. Classical anthropological and sociolog ical theory assumed that a major function of ritual was the intergenerational trans mission of values and meanings. But out of ritual may also come new interpretations, meanings of symbols that depend on the experiences people bring to the ritual context and on the interaction that occurs within it. Shared meanings which emerge through ritual activity create a sense of collective identity among the participants that is de rived from the past yet may challenge formerly accepted meanings (Turner 1974). Thus ritual can incorporate the paradox of social movement collective identity that Melucci describes: The autonomous ability to produce and to recognize the collective reality as a "we" is a paradoxical situation: in affirming its difference from the rest of the society, a movement also states its belonging to the shared culture of a society and its need to be recognized as a social actor. (Melucci 1992, p. 10).</page><page sequence="12">58 SOCIOLOGICAL FOCUS We believe that the leaders of the Japanese social welfare movement recog nized, consciously or unconsciously, that ritual and symbols of mainstream Japanese culture could aid them in their difficult task of creating a collective identity for their movement. The festival form that the Forum took will be discussed below. It embodies readily recognized symbols and rituals of Japanese culture of both the past and the present. In the past, social welfare services were delivered not by a governmental agency, but by families living in a geographically dispersed administrative unit. By utilizing festival in another context which will be discussed below, movement leaders created symbolic associations which allowed the reinterpretation not only of the festi val form, but also of family and community relationships which had previously hin dered the development of public social welfare services. Thus ritual, a variation on a Shinto festival, enabled group leaders both to bring new recruits into the movement and to transform the thinking of movement participants. Festivals in Japan usually refer to a set of ritual events centered around a Shinto shrine. The purpose of these events is generally to assure the safety of the parish/community and the well-being and fortunes of its inhabitants through taking the anthropomorphic gods from their shrine abodes and parading them in portable shrines, often in a rowdy fashion, through the community. Accustomed to thinking that religious ritual is a solemn event, Westerners are often surprised to find that crass commercialism and rowdy drunkenness are often integral aspects of Shinto fes tivals. To residents, participation in the festival helps to renew their sense of belong ing to the community. The term and format of a festival have become widely used in contemporary Japan for a variety of secular purposes (Robertson 1987; Ben-Ari 1986). Robertson (1987) points out that department store sales and family sporting events are often des ignated as festivals. "Clearly, the word [festival] imbues used book sales and sporting events with an extraordinary, and importantly, an entertaining value previously asso ciated with shrine ceremonies in particular" (Robertson 1987, p. 125). Robertson's ar ticle focuses on the use of the festival form (i.e., without the presence of the gods) by city government for the purposes of promoting community identity and thus assuring adequate tax base for continuing and improving city services. Officials attempt to ac complish these goals by renovating a "traditional" symbolic form as part of a move ment to create a "traditional"-style village within a modern city. But "traditional" is in quotation marks because the festival is not a petrified cultural form, but as Ikeda (1990) points out, "what people do to festivals is just as important as what festivals do to people.... A festival is dynamic, and changes to suit changing social conditions. Its meaning cannot be fixed." The International Forum as Ritual. Our discussion of the International Forum as a ritual presumes similarities with a Japanese religious ritual. Our recognition of the ritual nature of much of the Forum was aided by the contrast between American and Japanese culture. To Americans expecting a conference, this six day program which included a children's concert, testimonials, parties, and dancing as well as lec tures, initially struck us as unusual. The wife of one of the key organizers had earlier told us not to be nervous about our presentations because, after all, it was really a kind of festival.</page><page sequence="13">FESTIVAL FOR A CAUSE 59 In our case study, the goals of the leadership are quite different from that of the city officials in Robertson's research. There is no explicit attempt to recreate the "tra ditional." If anything, they see themselves as visionaries working toward the welfare society of the future. This is precisely what ritual can do ? utilize familiar forms of in teraction in the creation of new meanings. Calhoun (1991, p. 66) also notes that the Chinese protesters he described were in the paradoxical position of acting on the basis of an identity at odds with one of their very goals. So perhaps it is not surprising that the event created in 1990 by the International Forum has many elements of a festival. We can identify six ways in which the Forum made use of the festival tradition. 1. Time. Festivals take place in "ritual time," time in which ordinary secular activities are suspended and ritual activity climaxes (Moore and Myerhoff 1977). Similarly, Forum participants took time off from normal responsibilities of work or family, some for only one day, but many for the entire week, to participate in events which are outside of their daily round of activities. The timing of the Forum was, in the contemporary Japanese calendar, a time of transition. The mid-August Buddhist holiday and accompanying festivals of Bon had passed; school would resume the week following the Forum. The Forum was thus an end-of-summer activity taking place af ter a major religious holiday and before return to the normal schedule of the school year. Ritual time provides occasions for the exploration of alternative actions and meanings, whether in a festival or in a social movement. 2. Organization. In the Forum, as in Shinto festivals, the public performance was preceded by a great deal of behind-the-scenes effort. As one woman notes in the film, Fighting Festival, plans for the next year's festival begin as soon as this year's has ended. Likewise, Forum leaders began working on this event nearly as soon as "Embrace Lake Biwa" had ended. During planning, normal rules of social interaction are in force, including verbal and behavioral recognition of status differences of family, length of residence in community, age, gender, and occupation. Organization is based less on individual commitment than on the commitment of numerous community or ganizations to its success, such as the local self-government committees, the women's organization, and the merchant's association (Bestor 1985; Littleton 1986). Likewise, for the Forum, the organization and leadership we described earlier were based on secular status and recruitment of volunteers through members in organizations and the involvement of employers. The social structure of movement organization de scribed by social movement theorists characterizes this type of festival ritual as well in Japan. 3. Egalitarianism. In contrast to the highly structured behind-the-scenes activ ity, the festival's emphasis during the public performance is on egalitarianism and communalism. The ultimate goal of this social welfare movement is a democratic wel fare state, and as the Forum title suggests, its leaders espouse an ideology of active citizen participation in the democratic process. Many of the movement leaders were not highly visible in the public performance and the emphasis in each day's events was on the results of local consensus-building. In addition, shared experiences of eating, singing, or dancing together as well as testimonials or comments by local citizens helped to emphasize the common experiences in the lives of participants. Unlike the Westerner's image of ritual occasions, the noise, color, food and drink of the festival help to make it what it is ? a form of entertainment. The Forum</page><page sequence="14">60 SOCIOLOGICAL FOCUS clearly had recruitment and educational goals, but it was meant, at the same time, to entertain. Thus, the play, the concert, the slides must be seen not as add-ons, but as vital parts of the process the movement leadership had set in motion. Participation in this citizen-oriented event sends a symbolic message about democracy to the wider so ciety which is seen by group leaders as unresponsive to the needs of ordinary people (Melucci 1989). 4. Competition. Festival participation requires cooperation, but participants also exhibit a strong sense of competition. In a festival, competition is expressed between neighborhoods in building floats or in the fighting of the gods in the Fighting Festival; competition was subtly present in the Forum as well. Each locale strove to create an interesting and informative program that would draw a large audience. At one level, a successful program contributed to the overall success of the movement; at another level, it was proof of the commitment and abilities of the local organizers. And just as the success of a festival benefits the entire community, assuring its safety and the well-being of all of its members, so too would the success of the movement benefit all members of the prefecture in the form of improved welfare services. Ultimately, com petition within the festival or the movement, is meant to make all of the participants winners in a larger competition with the outside world, in the case of the Forum, the prefectural government (Klandermans 1989). 5. Place. A Shinto festival is based on identification of a geographically coherent area. The movement of a festival parade physically marks the boundaries of the com munity, as Shiga residents encircled their lake, or as the Forum program moved each day to a different town or city. This movement highlights divisions within the commu nity (Bestor 1985; Robertson 1987), but only within the context of a bound geographi cal unit. Within this bounded unit, the festival serves as a major metaphor (Ikeda 1990) for the community as a whole. What the movement leaders are trying to do through the Forum is to bind Shiga residents together in recognition not only of com mon problems but of common geography and common target of lobbying activity (i.e., the prefectural government). Some members of the audience actually traveled from place to place in order to attend sessions. Others attended only in their own communi ties, but were bound symbolically to the whole because of its movement. By recogniz ing community divisions and then cross-cutting ordinary statuses in ritual time, the festival maintains and strengthens community identity. We believe from our inter views and discussions with Forum leaders that this was a major goal of the Forum. 6. Outsiders. Festivals often make use of outsiders as well as physical move ment through the community in order to reinforce its social boundaries. The use of na tional and international experts in the Forum can be viewed in a number of ways. They provided legitimacy as well as expertise to the movement. Yet it was local people who maintained control of the movement, and the outsiders were clearly consultants. International scholars lent not only legitimacy to the endeavor, but were meant to il lustrate options to the current welfare system. But outsiders in general and foreigners in particular serve other roles. They remain curiosities (Bestor 1985) and may help to draw attention to what is going on. Outsiders, and foreigners in particular, by being different, help reinforce the definition of self and community. Festivals may focus resistance to forces outside the community which threaten to weaken its autonomy, forces of urbanization and internationaliza</page><page sequence="15">FESTIVAL FOR A CAUSE 61 tion. In the case of the Forum, while the goals of the leadership are progressive, then style of activist democracy is to be achieved through communalism (Broadbent 1986). Foreigners thus served as symbols in the movement by indicating community bound aries. These six characteristics of the International Forum reflect features of a Japanese festival, despite obvious differences in content. Both focus on community sol idarity. But the Forum had to create a sense of community, rather than reinforce the solidarity of a pre-existing one. The difficult task of creating a sense of community as wide as a prefecture can be aided by presenting contrasts such as a successful woman journalist from Tokyo or a tall blonde Danish scholar. They support the goals of the movement, but they simultaneously help to achieve them by their difference. As we think again about the goals of this social welfare movement ? fundrais ing, recruitment of members, public education, and the creation of a sense of solidarity ? we can see that the festival form enhanced the leadership's ability to move toward these goals. The festival created an artificial sense of community, involving large numbers of people in activities meant to entertainingly educate them in ideas of mod ern social welfare. People were encouraged to participate in broadening their local community solidarity, and their sense of community responsibility. This sense of community was symbolized by the festival, but was extended through Forum content to concern for those in need in the much wider sociopolitical "community" of Shiga pre fecture. The combination of cultural form and social welfare content allowed this transformation to take place. CONCLUSION This study has grown out of our attempts to understand an emerging Japanese social movement and one of its ritual events. We found that the social movement liter ature offered several paradigms, none of which in itself was sufficient to answer our questions, but all of which provided tools for our task. First, we needed to understand how such a movement arose at the time and place it did. Japan's postindustrial status was the precondition that nurtured a social movement concerned with governmental social welfare services and its ability to orga nize for this goal: its prosperity, its demographics, the structure of its labor market, and its social organization and dense network of communications channels. Concepts from microlevel approaches were also necessary to understand this so cial movement. We observed the SPIN-organization and horizontal leadership struc ture of the movement. These were able to bring together participants and other re sources, and helped to create the egalitarian atmosphere congruent with the group's ideology. Although movement activists did not necessarily agree on all of the specific details, they shared a vision of a modern Western European-style welfare state. That vision served as the basis for the "Declaration" which they wrote and presented as the climax of the International Forum. To understand the process of participant mobilization and consensus building which we observed, we turned to the collective identity approach. The creation of col lective identity, a sense of community, was the major challenge facing the event orga nizers. Melucci's work relates collective identity to collective action. Collective identity</page><page sequence="16">62 SOCIOLOGICAL FOCUS is a process of constructing meaning which leads to collective action, itself a symbolic statement of resistance to postindustrial social control. However little attention is paid to the specific means by which the reverse process occurs. Collective action also leads to the reconstruction of identity. We were left without an explanation of how the form of the International Forum on Civil Participation in Welfare could create a sense of collective identity. What did a week-long festival-like event including the appearance of foreigners contribute to the group's effort to improve welfare services? It became clear to us that ritual's ability to be grounded in culture but also to potentially challenge previous interpretations of it served as a vehicle to help accomplish the leaders' goals of participant mobilization and construction of identity. Culture is not merely a static variable that helps to explain why a social move ment occurs or does not occur. Culture can be better considered an incompletely shared set of symbols through which the world is interpreted. It is not only learned but continuously being created through common experience. Ritual, behavior in time and place set aside from normal social structure, seems an especially powerful means to give collective experience cultural significance, potentially leading to the reconstruc tion of identity. This Japanese social welfare movement demonstrates that new inter pretations arising in the context of the familiar social interaction of ritual can lead to a new sense of community.
