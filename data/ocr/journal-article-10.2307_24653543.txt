<plain_text><page sequence="1">EARLY IRON AGE FINDS FROM THE VILLANOVAN CEMETERY OF COLLE BARONCIO: REMARKS ON EARLY VETULONIA AND ITS CONNECTIONS* Lionello Morandi Introduction Due to the developments in palaeoethnological studies during the late 19th century,1 extensive fieldwork was carried out in the hills around the Etruscan settlement of Vetulonia, located in southern Tuscany about 15 km from the coast (fig. 1). These investigations, the results of which were promptly published,2 led to the discovery of large Early Iron Age cemeteries north-east and west of the historical settlement.

However, a different fate befell one of these cemeteries (one of the largest), which lay west of the settlement on the slope of Colle Baroncio (fig. 2). Isidoro Falchi, the discoverer of the Etruscan city of Vetulonia who carried out most of the excavations, was unable to extend his fieldwork to the top of this hill.3 It was part of the estate of two local landowners, Angiolo and Antonio Guidi, who preferred to carry out the excavations themselves.4 Unfortunately, this led to the loss of a huge amount of data since the brothers simply aimed at gaining as many finds as possible without interest for the archaeological context.5 Nevertheless, the importance of the finds that have survived is apparent when one considers how little of the Early Iron Age material from Vetulonia has been documented according to modern standards. Furthermore, the Guidis told Falchi about the features of the graves they had dug up, and Falchi himself left us a description of the finds he saw when visiting their collection. This is useful in order to compare his observations with the available data from the eastern cemeteries. History of the collection From 1866. the Guidis began to deposit their collection in the Archaeological Museum of Grosseto at the request of the local administration. Although the finds could be exhibited to the public, the landowners reserved the right to sell them to the highest bidder. In April 1902, the Florentine antiquarian Giuseppe Pacini offered 200 lire for the purchase of all the items. This amount far exceeded the finances of the local administration, which wished to retain the collection within the museum. An agreement was reached whereby Pacini would keep only a few metal objects—among which were two spear-heads, two axes, a bronze dagger and a bronze figurine—6 in exchange for an Etruscan helmet and a Renaissance terracotta, while the other finds would remain in Grosseto. However, the exchange could not take place without an official document showing that Pacini had purchased the items from Angiolo and Antonio Guidi. As it transpired, the transaction came to a standstill owing to Pacini's health problems and later the death of the Guidis. The negotiations were stalled for years and a great number of heirs from both sides became involved. Only in 1913 did Pacini's widow, Angiolina Del Corona, eventually withdraw the aforementioned objects from the museum to enable the deal to be completed.7 The cemetery Of the Early Iron Age necropoleis, the Colle Baroncio and Dupiane cemeteries are situated in the western hills, the latter being on the uppermost part of the slope of Colle Baroncio.8 The cemetery of Colle Baroncio, with more than 700 burial pits, is the largest Villanovan graveyard of Vetulonia (together with the north-eastern cemetery of Poggio alia Guardia). 3 For a wider overview of Falchi's life and works, see.

Helbig (Bdl 1885, 129-34), who attended the excavation of a couple of freshly dug graves. His description allows us to infer that he saw one double male/female cremation and one female cremation. Furthermore, the German scholar provides useful details of the tomb structure and the position of the objects within it. 6 This item is probably to be identified with a fragmentary Hellenistic statuette of a naked woman is mentioned in the early 20th-century inventory list of the objects. 7 The summary of the events is presented here on the basis of the official documents pertaining to the purchase of the collection held at the Archaeological Museum of Grosseto. 8 A.

Burial areas: Β = Colle Baroncio; C = Dupiane; D = Poggio alia Guardia; Ε = Poggio Belvedere; F = Poggio al Bello; G = Poggio aile Birbe. The burials consisted of circular, stone-lined, earth-dug pits, containing a cinerary urn filled with the cremated bones of the deceased and a few grave-goods, as commonly recorded in the Villanovan fades? The tombs were marked by a flat slab but, unlike the north-eastern cemeteries, not encircled by slabs set on edge.10 The finds from the necropolis are stored at the Archaeological Museum of Grosseto and remain, with a few exceptions," unpublished. While their complete edition is in preparation, it seems worthwhile to present some objects which are particularly useful in extending our knowledge of Early Iron Age Vetulonian handicrafts and connections. 9 I prefer to use the term fades which seems more neutral than 'culture', since what is termed 'Villanovan' commonly includes different features that make it difficult to label it as a uniform culture in the anthropological sense. However, the concept of a Villanovan fades varies according to different scholarly traditions (see R.

The vase presents a continuous shoulder and displays a row of stamped concentric dots and incised broken meanders included in a cord-impressed band, while branched N-motifs ending in dots are placed on the lower body (fig. 3). The specimen fits into a fades peculiar to Tuscany between the Final Bronze Age and the Early Iron Age (EIA), or at the very beginning of ι τ t EIA1, since the proportions and decoration of the vase show a clear link with urns documented at the Volterra-Ripaie and Nomadelfia cemeteries.14 The Figure 3.

Although the urn was certainly found within the countryside of Grosseto, there are no data unequivocally indicating a provenance from Colle Baroncio. However, another urn was published as from the territory of Grosseto (ibid. pi. 3: 2), which undoubtedly comes from the cemetery of Colle Baroncio. It is therefore possible that some errors occurred during the archiving process. The fact that the vase is intact and the presence of other finds from Colle Baroncio dating between the Final Bronze Age and the Early Iron Age may be further elements pointing to a provenance from this cemetery. 13 As for absolute chronology, a certain degree of uncertainty is due to high radiometric dates (for the debate, see G. Bartoloni-F. Delpino, 'Un tipo di orciolo a lamelle metalliche. Considerazioni sulla prima fase villanoviana', StEtr 43, 1975, 3-45; F. Delpino, 'Datazioni problematiche, considerazioni sulla cronologia delle fasi villanoviane', in: Miscellanea Etrusco-Italica III, Quaderni di archeologia etrusco-italica 29 [2003] 9-35). Hereafter dates will be given according to traditional chronology (EIA1 = about 9th century bc; EIA2 = about 800-720 bc).

This variety is characterized by a slightly higher neck than body or equally high neck and body, a rounded, rather indistinct shoulder, slightly convex body and neck, and a quite standardized decorative comb-incised pattern (fig. 5) 28 Figure 5. Vetulonia, cemetery of Colle Baroncio: biconical urn. Museo Archeologico e d'Arte délia Maremma, Grosseto, inv. no. 1340. 1:3 (drawing: author). 24 With the term 'type' we mean here a set of artefacts sharing a range of morphological features which are considered to be significant, see D. L. Clarke, Analytical Archaeology (2nd ed., 1978) 496; also R. Peroni, 'Tipologia e analisi stilistica nei materiali della preistoria, breve messa a punto', DialA 1.2, 1967, 155-8; id., 'Classificazione tipologica, seriazione cronologica, distribuzione geografica', AquilNost 69, 1998, 9-28. As regards the typology of the cinerary urns from Vetulonia, currently in preparation by the author, these features are: the proportions (e.g. squat/ slim), the general form (e.g., biconical vase/jug), pronounced/ continuous shoulder, the shoulder shape (e.g., sharp/ rounded), the neck and body outline (e.g., concave/convex). In the author's opinion the typologizing of handmade pottery is a highly subjective process (one will never know if types actually fit with ancient mental models), and it should be borne in mind that the main purpose is to detect general long-term and short-term trends through a global view of the archaeological record. Excessively close typologies have to be avoided, as they tend to assign undue significance to minor attributes, leading to a multiplication of types and varieties, and in doing so they risk remaining merely a classification exercise. 25 S.

The urn surface is lined with a 1-2 mm-thick coating (pl. 1: 1-2) on the areas decorated with the metal stripes.29 This coating is likely to have been applied to the vase after it was fired because where it has come off the urn surface is thoroughly polished, as are the other parts. Originally the coating was probably applied to the whole of the tin-decorated body and not just to the circular areas on the neck. This assumption is supported by the lack of metal ornamentation where the coating has worn off, on roughly half of the body. In all other tin-band decorated Villanovan wares, the tin stripes were applied directly to the vase surface by means of a thin layer of a sticky substance.30 The different technique observed on the Vetulonian urn does not seem to share similarities with those in later Italian prehistory either.'1 Besides the many specimens attributable to local urn types,one can stress the significance of uncommon urn shapes, which are dissimilar from the ordinary ones, and which are probably related to external models. The most prominent case is that of a convex necked and extensively decorated biconical urn.33 Extremely significant in terms of the network of communications in which Early Iron Age Vetulonia was involved, this vase gives an indication of the circulation of ideas, and thus people, between this centre and southern Etruria, Vulci in particular. The body and the neck are decorated with a complex pattern formed (proceeding from the lower part to the higher) by square metopes including a simple swastika, a stamped geometric band, a row of cruciform dots, a second geometric band, and a continuous meander (fig. 6). The junction between neck and rim is marked by a shallow groove, pointing to a separate moulding process for different parts of the urn, then joint through the use of slip as a glue when the clay was leather hard.j4 The available data suggest a date between mid-EIAl and the beginning of EIA2 for the vase.j5 This urn type is different from the ordinary Vetulonian urns which are bow fibulae, fishbone-scratched bow fibulae, coated bow fibulae, and ridged bow fibulae, Cygielman art. cit.

However, in this case the clay coatings appear to have been applied in order to hide the previous incised decoration and prepare a new one. j2 For the commonest urn type during the HI A Κ see above. Moreover, at the beginning of EIA2, the previous type appears to have been replaced (30 specimens) by a slightly squatter one, often with plain body and a continuous meander on the upper part of the neck. 3j MAAM inv. no. 1329; Mazzolai op. cit.

This vase shows a striking resemblance to a Vulcian urn type, both in terms of its shape and especially the decorative pattern. One urn from Vulci in particular—unfortunately without context—is decorated with the same sequence of motifs: square metopes with swastikas, a stamped geometric band, a row of del Secondo Incontro di Studi (1995) 301 fig. 1: 1. Dots immediately below the stamped band on the upper part of the neck are frequent on several Tarquinian urns (Buranelli op. cit. motifs 104A, Ν, X, Z; Hencken op. cit. figs. 24c, 30d, 54c, 62d, 84e, 87g, 88g, 110a, 138f, 156m, 207d, 210b, 289f, 293a, 298d, 302b, 329a.).

Irregularly-shaped, unpolished, unevenly baked, often plain undecorated urns may provide evidence of a near domestic level of production (pl. 1: 3-4).37 In contrast, symmetrical, well-polished, often 36 A.

In this connection it may be useful to refer to David Peacock's subdivision of pottery making, as Early Iron Age specialized production could well fit into his category of •individual/nucleated workshops'.3 The presence of identical unusually decorated urns40 found in different centres strongly suggests the mobility of specialized potters—somewhat comparable to that of bronze artisans at an earlier stage.41 The fact that these potters did not belong to the local community and had been trained in other centres whence they derived their mental models, would explain why their works stand out compared to the local production, as does for instance the urn Grosseto inv. 1329 (fig. 6) within the Vetulonian archaeological record.42 As far as Vetulonia and Vulci are concerned—two centres sharing much of their decorative heritage41—this process was probably more developed than we can now see, and a real mobility of individuals appears to be indicated by the distribution of some personal objects. Vetulonia/Vulci links and the Tomb of the Sardinian Bronzes The assumed migration of a potter from Vulci to Vetulonia may receive further reinforcement from archaeological data such as the distribution of some metal types indicating the 38 I am aware of the ambiguous meaning of the term 'specialization" (M. Vidale, Viaggio intorno alia mia ciotola. Evoluzione tecnologica e comunicazione non verbale in una sequenza ceramica dell'Eta del Bronzo. Supplemento 84 agli Annali [1995] 12-3). In this case it is to be considered as indicative of a complex process involving a high degree of organization, in the sense intended by D. P. S. Peacock.

The specialization of potters in EIA Etruria has been already assumed with reference to the production of a series of tin-band decorated jugs found in the major Villanovan centres (Bartoloni Delpino art. cit.); with regard to biconical urns. Iaia (op. cit. 22) refers to 'produzione di tipo semi-specialistico'. As for our urn. we can assume that potters could move from one centre to another following the major linking routes. 40 In fact, such arguments would be weak in the case of extremely common decorations. Because of their wide diffusion, their informative potential remains very limited. 41 A. M. Bietti Sestieri.

However, by a close examination of the overall corpus of published Vetulonian cinerary urns, some tendencies seem to emerge, as some types are found to be very common, while others are totally missing. 43 Similarities in the decorative patterns are indicated by ornamental choices which are common at Vulci and Vetulonia but not frequent elsewhere.

In particular, bronze bow fibulae of rhomboidal cross-section decorated with small oblique incisions, most frequent in Felsina (the major centre of production for this type),44 show great promise in terms of establishing the short- and long range connections of Vetulonia (fig. 8). The significance of these artefacts in Sardinia, as well as in Vetulonia and Populonia, has long been stressed.45 This distribution may be explained by assuming both the movement of a group of craftsmen who produced these fibulae along the route from Felsina to Vetulonia and the presence in Vetulonia of people from the Po plain wearing these accessories. Since direct relationships have been documented between Vetulonia and Sardinia, the occurrence of these fibulae on the island may be attributed to the presence of Vetulonian individuals. However, as already mentioned, we wish to stress that such fibulae are also found in Vulci,47 thus confirming the above-mentioned close relationship between Vetulonia and Vulci with reference to pottery. Furthermore, unlike the occurrence of these fibulae on the shore of Lake Accesa,48 which is not surprising, their presence in Chiusi seems quite significant:49 in fact, inner Etruria appears to have been quite well linked to Vetulonia through the Ombrone and Orcia Valleys.50 Another type of fibula, characterized by a flat bow with a longitudinal ridge and a double row of concentric circles, is considered typical of the mining district but is rarely found in southern Etruria (pi. 2: l).51 It is significant that, besides their presence in a Caeretan grave in association with an askoid jug,52, a warped specimen of these fibulae has been found 44 R.

In this case we may assume not only the provenance of the deceased from the mining district, but—more reasonably in my opinion—the mobility of an artisan along the route used for the trade of the askoid-jugs toward southern Etruria.</page><page sequence="12">12 Lionello Morandi in Vulci,53, whereas they are absent from the other centres.54 The formal peculiarities of these types of fibulae enable detailed delineation of the routes followed by Early Iron Age craftsmen55 and furthermore point to the major role played by Vulci56 in the interaction between the coastal mining district and southern Etruria.57 It seems worthwhile here also to stress the remarkable similarities linking Vulci and Vetulonia with regard to funerary ritual, already emphasized by C. Iaia,58, i.e. ash urns grouped in a single pit, or separated only by one of the pit slabs, or superimposed on two floors separated by the bottom slab of the upper pit. All these burial modalities are peculiar to these two centres within the Villanovan fades. With regard to these connections involving both material culture and funerary ritual, it seems pertinent to express some remarks concerning the well-known Vulcian grave containing Sardinian bronzes (pi. 2: 2).59 The grave is furnished with an uncommonly rich cluster of grave-goods—like the grave Gsell 8360—and can be attributed to EIA1. Special attention has been paid to the notable Sardinian bronze objects, namely, a miniature wicker basket, a stool-shaped item,61 and a human figurine, to which we can now add a previously unrecognized misshapen pendant and perhaps also a chainlet.62 We can try to account for these items by assuming their involvement in an exchange system of prestige goods operating among Villanovan élites.63 This notion has the advantage that it avoids explanations related to marriage alliances by assuming that bronzes functioned as ethnic markers.64 On the basis 53 Fatconi Amorelli op. cit. (η. 36) 181 fig. 78: 289. A specimen with longitudinal ridge seems quite near to this type, from which it differs in having fewer and smaller circles (ibid. 181 fig. 78: 288). 54 A flat bow fibula from Chiusi displays concentric circles on both sides, with the only difference that the central part of the bow is decorated with fishbone scratches instead of the longitudinal ridge (Delpino art. cit. [η. 49] 97 fig. 8). For the connections between Vetulonia and Chiusi, see also above, nn. 49-50. 55 We have to keep in mind that these are not objects made of precious or exotic materials, and therefore their presence is to be linked merely to their practical function. Such arguments and the rarity of these fibulae allow a precise observation of the routes followed by the artisans who produced and sold them, or by the people who used to wear them. 56 Nevertheless, with reference to material culture, the connections between Tarquinia and Vetulonia are worth remembering too (G. Camporeale. "Rapport! tra Tarquinia e Vetulonia in epoca villanoviana', StEtr 32, 1964, 3-11). To this end. 1 stress the occurrence of the continuous meander pattern on the upper part of urn necks (Tarquinia: Hencken op. cit. figs. 40c. 42i, 46n, 47f, 56d, 58e, 60c, 62d. 63e. 64d, 65c. 66d, 76b, 86f, 88g, 103e, 1131, 121 f, 126a, 135h. 136e. 151b, 153a, 154h. 176i, 214h, 222b, 227e, 233f, 234g, 257c. 280g, 287b, 293a, 294b, 3011, 306d, 307c, 310c, 3251; Vetulonia, CVA Firenze 1 pis. 1: 1,3, 8. 11, 15; 2: 1,3; 3: 3; 4; 3; 5: 13. 17, 24; 6, 16; 7: 10, 18, 22; 8: 14, 17, 18; 9: I, 3. 5, 13; 10: 5, 7. 9, 10. 14; 11: 18,20,23; 12: 1,2; 13: 31. often attested also in Vulci (Falconi Amorelli op. cit. figs. 4: 5; 9: 13; 19: 26; 21: 30; 22: 32; Mandolesi op. cit. cat. nos. 2, 9, 12, 17, 18.27, 30). 57 Though these relations seem apparent in the case of the Caeretan grave Sorbo 233 (Pohl op. cit. 57-9; Delpino 1981, 283-4). 58 Op. cit. (η. 34) 92 η. 20. 59 The grave-goods from the Tomb of the Sardinian Bronzes have been recently thoroughly re-examined: L.

Preistoria e Protostoria in Etruria, Atti dell'Ottavo Incontro di Studi (2008) 330: Arancio et al. art. cit. (η. 27) 199). The study has led to the identification of some objects as not originally included in the burial and provided a correct drawing of the cinerary urn. Furthermore, osteological analysis of the cremated bones was carried out, leading to the attribution of the human remains to a woman between 25 and 30 y.o. and a child between 8 and 10 y.o. 60 Iaia op. cit. 89. 61 On this find and its possible connection with larger northern European cultural objects, see F.

The importance of the Vetulonia/Vulci relationship has been highlighted earlier and it seems that Vetulonia can be considered to be the place of provenance for the Sardinian bronze grave-goods found in Vulci. This process has to be seen as part of an exchange system between high-ranking individuals of Early Iron Age centres in Etruria who probably had control of valuable items.66 From such a viewpoint, the theory that the exchanges were linked to marital arrangements may gain some credibility67—though remaining impossible to prove—or one may otherwise consider the exchange of goods merely as a means of sealing agreements for the exploitation of the territory and raw materials. As for Nuragic products, such an explanation turns out to be particularly suitable in the case of the Tomb of the Sardinian Bronzes, in that it is marked by exceptional items—like the anthropomorphic figurine—while Sardinian products commonly found in poorly-furnished burials do not require such élite-centred explanations.68 The presence of the anthropomorphic figurine among the grave-goods of the Vuician tomb can be interpreted as a further indication of the involvement of Vetulonia. In fact, this item— which was found inside the ash urn69—appears to be the only example so far of a Nuragic 65 Bartoloni-Delpino art. cit. (η. 13) 41; Cygielman Pagnini art. cit.

Campus et al., 'La transizione culturale dall'età del bronzo all'età del ferro nella Sardegna nuragica in relazione con ntalia tirrenica", Bollettino di Archeologia on line 1, 2010. 71. As for the arrival of Sardinian products in the Italian peninsula one ought to take into account also the mediator role played by the Phoenicians, see M. Cygielman L. Pagnini, La tomba del Tridente a Vetulonia (2006) 155 n. 4. besides the direct contacts with Sardinian communities indicated by the presence of Tyrrhenian people in the island, documented by the presence of Villanovan clothing accessories and personal items, Lo Schiavo art. cit.

As for Vetulonia. they may be identified as the deceased buried within the spaced-slab circles whose remains were collected into hut-urns (G. Bartoloni et al., "Veio e Vetulonia nella prima età del Ferro, affinità e differenze nello sviluppo di due comunità dell'Htruria villanoviana', in: The Iron Age in Europe, Colloquium XXIII, Atti del XIII Congresso UISPP (1996) 67-90; Zifferero art. cit. (η. 8). 67 This interpretation receives further support by the kind of funerary ritual and by the local types of personal items found in the Vulcian burial: G. Bartoloni, 'Marriage, Sale and Gift. A proposito di alcuni corredi femminili dalle necropoli populoniesi della prima età del Ferro', in: A. Rallo (éd.), Le donne in Etruria (1989) 40; Delpino art. cit. (η. 11. 2002) 381 η. 70; G. Bartoloni, Le società dell'Italia primitiva (2003) 116. Recently, on the basis of the urn decoration and the types of fibulae, possible connections with southern Campania have been pointed out (Arancio et al. art. cit. [η. 27] 191). 68 For example in the case of the Sardinian cone-shaped miniature bronzes (so-called bottom) from the Le Rose cemetery at Tarquinia, that is characterized by rather poorly furnished graves, it is not possibile to assume an élite-goods exchange. As for these bronzes, when found in pairs in peninsular burials. F. Lo Schiavo. "Bronzi nuragici nelle tombe della prima età del ferro di Pontecagnano\ in: La presenza etrusca nella Campania méridionale, Atti delle giornate di studio (1994) 77, has assumed their function as clothing ornaments, probably symmetrically arranged. The criticism expressed in this regard by C. Tronchetti, Ί bronzetti "nuragici". ideologia, iconografia, cronologia', AnnAStorAnt 17, 1997, 17 n. 46, who attributes to Lo Schiavo modern aesthetic criteria, seems excessive. Actually, a predilection for a symmetrical disposal of the ornaments is sometimes documented in various late prehistoric cultures by the placement of the objects in inhumations: see. e.g., C.

(n. 4) 65. 71 There is no evidence to identify this outstanding find with the statuette withdraw n from the Archaeological Museum of Grosseto by the widow of the antiquarian Giuseppe Pacini in 1913 (see above, n. 6). 72 It was associated with elements which can be easily recognized as assignable to EI A1 (Tarquinia type spindle tip). as noted by Cygielman (art. cit. [η. 11] 260 η. 20). 73 Cygielman loc. cit. A bronze figurine equipped with a small round shield was found also in grave 79/1897 of Poggio alia Guardia (but we do not know whether it was placed inside or outside the cinerary urn: I. Falchi, "Vetulonia'. NSc 1898. 91-112 fig. 16; A. Cherici, 'Armi e armati nella société viscntina, note sul carrello e sul cinerario dell'Olmo Bello". Annl aina 12, 2005. 143-4). However, the mention of the tunic with respect to the statuette found at Colle Baroncio may be a further clue to an interpretation as a Sardinian figurine. Moreover, the findings from this cemetery are mostly attributable to E1A1, whereas the few other armed bronze figurines of Italian production (generally part of bronze furniture, such as the ones on the Bisenzio wagon (Cherici art. cit.). are confined to the 8th century bc (C.
