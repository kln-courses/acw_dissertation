<plain_text><page sequence="1">VIII.-NEW BOOKS. [These Notes (by various hands) do not exclude Critical Notices later on.] Institutes of Logic. By JOHN VEITCH, LL.D., Professor of Logic and Rhe- toric in the University of Glasgow. Edinburgh and London: Black- wood &amp; Sons, 1885. Pp. ix., 551. This considerable treatise-" designed both for those who are commenicing the study of Logic and for those who have gone beyond the elements to the higher questions of the science "-is laid out on the traditional lines. Parts ii.-iv. deal successively with "Concepts and Terms" (pp. 165-219), " Judgment " (pp. 220-336), " Inference " (pp. 337-551), after a considera- tion of "The Laws, of Thought" (pp. 112-164), with a view of " Logical Psychology" and "Historical Notices," in Part i. The historical notes interspersed throughout give the work a special interest and value, and there is abundance of lively polemic (directed mainly against Hegel on the one hand and Mill on the other) to enliven the exposition; which, for the rest, should receive all the attention due to the author's mature experience as a logical teacher. Scottish Philosophy: A Comparison of the Scottish anid German Answers to Hume. By ANDREW SETH, M.A., Professor of Logic and Philosophy in the University College of South Wales and Monniouthshire. Edin- burgh and London: Blackwood &amp; Sons, 1885. Pp. 218. The first outcome of a Philosophical Lectureship in the University of Edinburgh, recently founded by Mr. A. J. Balfour for a term of three years and held by Prof. Seth. It was the desire of the founder that " the Lectures should be a contribution to philosophy and not merely to the history of systems"; accordingly, in the first course of six (delivered in the spring of last year), historical is subordinated to material consideration. The subject is one that called emilnently for treatment, and appears (on a first glance) to have been handled in a very comprehenisive and equitable spirit. The topics taken up are, in order: (1) The Philosophical Presup- positions: Descartes and Locke; (2) The Philosophical Scepticism of Hume; (3) Reid: Sensation and Perception; (4) Reid and Kant; (5) The Relativity of Knowledge: Kant and Hamilton; (6) The Possibility of Philosophy as System : Scottish Philosophy and Hegel. In his second course, Prof. Seth will pursue the consideration started in the final lecture. Hlobbes. By GEOROE CROOM ROBERTSON, Grote Professor of Philo- sophy of Mind and Logic in University College, London. (" Philoso- phical Classics for English Readers.") Edinburgh and London: Blackwood &amp; Sons, 1886. Pp. vii., 240. "Small as this volume. is, untoward circumstances have prevented its completion till long after the first third of it was already in print. The delay is onlv too likely to have affected the unity of treatment ; still, the original design has been adhered to in the main. That design was, even within such narrow compass, (1) to bring together all the previously known or now discoverable facts of Hobbes's life; and (2) to give some kind of fairly balanced representation of the whole range of his thought, instead of</page><page sequence="2">NEW BOOKS. 121 dwelling only upon those humanistic portions of it by which he has com- nionly been judged. Readers will not proceed far before they apprehend the reason why the account of the 'System' has here been imbedded in the 'Life'-in departure from the usual order of exposition in books of the kind. More than of almost any other philosopher, it can be said of Hobbes that the key to a right understanding of his thought is to be found in his personal circumstances and the events of his time." The Politics of Aristotle. Translated into English, with Introduction, Marginal Analysis, Essays, Notes and Indices, by B. JOWETT, M.A., Master of Balliol College, Regius Professor of Greek in the University of Oxford, &amp;c. Vols. i., ii. 1. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1885. Pp. cxlv., 302, 320. This important work-first begun by Prof. Jowett about fifteen years ago in connexion with his Platonic studies-will be reviewed later on. It has comile to hand at the last nioinent, and there is time only to mention that while Vol. i. consists of Introduction (after a few pages of Preface) and Translation, Vol. ii., of which the present first part is composed of Notes, will be completed shortly (in a second part) by a collection of Essays, which promise to be of great interest. They will deal not only with the Politics (in a variety of aspects) but also with the life and, to some extent, the general philosophical work of Aristotle. The Indices, due to the hand of the translator's " friend and secretary," Mr. M. Kinight, are of notable ex- cellence. KEant's Introduction to Logic cand his Essay on the Mistaken Subtilty of the Four Figures. Translated by THOMAS KINGSMILL ABBOTT, B.D., Fellow and Tutor of Trinity College, Dublin. With a few Notes by COLERIDGE. London: Longmans, Greeni, 1885. Pp. 98. To what he has previously done for the spread of Kant's doctrine, by translation of the more important ethical works, Mr. T. K. Abbott now adds by his present version of the general introductory part of the Logik (issued by Kant's pupil Jasche in 1800), pp. 1-78, and also of the earlier essay Die falsche Spitzfindigkeit der vier syllog. P`iguren (1762), pp. 79-95. The body of the Logik he leaves aside, as having in it too much of the traditional School-doctrine and not enough of Kant's own thought to justify translation. The notes taken from Coleridge's copy of the Logik in the British Museum are but three short jottings. Outlines of the History of Greek Philosophzy. By Dr. EDWARD ZELLER. Translated with the Author's sanction by SARAH FRANCES ALLEYNE and EVELYN ABBOTT. London: Longilans, Green, 1886. Pp. xv., 363. The Grundriss here translated appeared at the end of 1883, having been uindertaken by the distinguished author (in response to requests for such a general sketch of Greek philosophy from him) as soon as he had completed the third edition of his great historical work. A fit interpreter was at lhand in Miss Alleyne, who had already done excellent service in her rendering of various parts of the Geschichte; but we learn (now for the first time), with sorrow, from the preface supplied by the co-translator who took up the task at p. 90, that " in the prime of life and in the fiull vigour of her powers she died, after a mnonth's illness, Auguist 16, 1884 ". Mr. Abbott pays, from personal knowledge, a high tribute to her intellect and character; and the loss to the cause of philosophical study in this country by her death will be widely felt. She already had it in view, on comple-</page><page sequence="3">122 NEW BOOKS. tion of these Outlines, to add the second divisioni of Part iii. of the Ifistory, concluding the whole work, to the Eclecticism which, in 1883, came last from her diligent pen. Intended, in the first instance, for elementary students, the present volume-from the hand of such a master as Zeller- has plenty of instruction for more advanced readers also. Naturally, it follows the lines of the Geschichte. Charles Darwin. By GRANT ALLEN. (" English Worthies.") London: Longmans, Green, 1885. Pp. 206. The author " has endeavoured to present the life and work of Charles Darwin viewed as a moment in a great revolution, in due relation both to those who went before and those who come after him"; and, bringing a wide knowledge with perfect enthusiasm to the task, he has produced an effective and even brilliant piece. The psychological and other humanistic implications of Evolutionism are, of course, not overlooked, whether as suggested by Darwin himself or as worked out in the system of Mr. Spencer; but by the side of these some other names of the century that have passed before as great need hardly have been held in such small account as at p. 198. The Miscellaneous and Posthumous Works of HENRY THOMAS BUCKLE. A new and abridged Edition. Edited by GRANT ALLEN. 2 vols. London: Longinans, Green, 1885. Pp. viii., 433 ; viii., 421. Of all the reactionaries or the laggards who failed to get upon the evolu- tionary track, Buckle receives the hardest cut in the Charles Darwin. Was it because Mr. Allen had just been wrestling with the labour of bringing Miss Taylor's original three bulky volumes into the compass of these much handier two ? It can have been no easy task, and the service rendered to Buckle's memory by the omissions is considerable. As the work now stands, less tlhan half (while yet enough) of Vol. ii. is occupied with " Extracts from the Common Place Book" ; "Fragments" run back from ii. 254 to i. 200 ; preceded by the longer piece "Reign of Elizabeth" from i. 143. Miss Taylor's Biographical Notice, and tlhe originally reprinted papers "Influence of Woinen," "Mill on Liberty," with Letter on Pooley's Case, come first. Movements of Religious Thought in Britain during the Nineteenth Century. Being the Fifth Series of St. Giles' Lectures. By JOHN TULLOCt, D.D., LL.D., Senior Principal in the University of St. Andrews. London: Longmans, Green, 1885. Pp. xi., 338. Of this series of eight lectures, that which has most philosophical inte- rest is the sixth, on "John Stuart Mill and his School". Most of the school seem to the author to have been entirely wanting in "spiritual instinct ". The younger Mill, although, like his father and the rest of "his school" (described as founded by James Mill and as including G. H. Lewes), lie insisted on judging Christianity from its worst instead of from its best side, had " far higher instincts " than the more consistent members of the school such as Grote, who was "more a Millite than John Stuiart Mill himself ". Yet, as " men are not supposed to be and cannot be experts in anything the very rudiments of which they have never learned," we ought not to look upon his writings "as possessing any special authority on the subject" of religion. He has done service, indeed, to religious thought "in indicating everywhere the moral side of religion," but his chief service is to have shown by " clearing the marches between the great lines of thouglht " that " determinism in philosoplhy leads to the negation</page><page sequence="4">NEW BOOKS. 123 of all religion". Henceforth it is clear to both sides that "religion may be tacked on by faith or superstition to a Determinist Philosophy or Doctrine of Necessity, but it cannot be rationally evolved from it ". Sermons. By MARK PATTISON, late Rector of Lincoln College, Oxford. London: Macmillan, 1885. Pp. 298. These thirteen sermons by Pattison-nine University and four College, mostly belonging to the time of his mental maturity, from 1861 to 1871, but including four of an earlier period (1847-51)-have not the intrinsic philosophical importance of Butler's famous fifteen ; but they are a real contribution to philosophy all the same, or at least they disclose a more serious philosophical vein in their author's mind than any of his other writings. Somiie of them give, with a certain continuity, a view of the relation of religion to the historical development of philosophy early and late, that may serve henceforth as a general framework for the celebrated essay of 1860, in which he described with such striking effect the " Ten- dencies of Religious Thought in England, 1688-1750 ". These and others also go some way to defining his ethical position. We hope to return, later on, to a volume which "the Editors" (whoever they are) have done a real service to the philosophical thought of the time in giving to the public. The Idea of God as cffected by Modern Knowledge. By JOHN FiSKE. London: Macnmillan, 1885. Pp. xxxii., 173. Man's Destiny (see MIND, Vol. x. 302) was a first Address to the Concord School of Philosophy, and is followed by this second. Mr. Fiske was glad of the opportunity of now speaking about Theism-f as, in the former Address, he spoke of man's future-in both cases defining mLiore precisely, with the full consciouisness first reached "two years ago " (p. xxi.), but otherwise not altering, the positions which, as he contends, he had already taken up in Cosmic Philosophy (1874) and The Unseen W4rorld (1876&gt; Without abating aught from his former condemnation of the teleological method in science, he sees "no reason why, when a distinct dramatic tendency in the events of the universe appears as the result of purely scientific investigation, we should refuse to recognise it". He sought to prove such tendency in Man's Destiny, taking it, though in no " limited anthropomorphic sense," as "lthe objective aspect of that which, when regarded on its subjective side, we call Purpose ". And so now he urges, "there is a reasonableness in the universe such as to indicate that the Infinite Power of which it is the multiform manifestation is psychical, though it is impossible to ascribe to Him any of the limited psychical attributes which we know, or to argue from the ways of man to the ways of God ". Taken together, the two Addresses contain the bare outlines of a theory of religion which the author hopes at somie future timiie to elaborate into a work on the true nature of Christianity. Philosophy and Experience. An Address delivered before the Aristotelian Society, October 26, 1885 (being the Annual Presidential Address for the Seventh Session of the Society). By SHADWORTH H. HODGSON, Hon. LL.D., Edin., Hon. Fellow of C.C.C., Oxford, President. Lon- don: Williaims &amp; Norgate, 1885. Pp. 123. The President of the Aristotelian Society liere passes from the distinc- tion between philosophy and science (drawn in his last Address) to the distinctions within philosophy itself, in the broader sense in which it "embraces all analysis of fact, including the contrast between itself and science ". The first two rubrics of philosophical method, "D istinction of</page><page sequence="5">124 NEW BOOKS. Aspects" and "Analysis of Elements," havinig been briefly recalled, the third and fourth rubrics, "The Order of Real Conditioning" and "The Constructive Branch of Philosophy," are treated at greater length. Under the third rubric the positive sciences enter the philosophical system " on the footino, not of being prescribed to, but of prescribing ". Yet the incor- poration of the whole system of the sciences would not complete philosophy. Positive science, like common-sense, treats objects as rounded-off totals, as "absolutes"; while for philosophy experience as known remains always boLnded by an unknown beyond itself. Construction of the unknown out of previous analysis is the problem of the fourth rubric of philosophy. Of this Unknown we can only affirm with speculative certainty real existence, infinity and continuity with the known. But the questions of the fourth rubric, the Constructive Branch of Philosophy, "escape the grasp of speculation, only to fall within the province of practice, and its highest function of practical judgment, conscience". Thus, without departure fronm the basis of experience, Philosophy becomes in the full sense a Rationale of the Universe; and there is no problenm, whether soluble or not, that does not at least " readily fall into rank, and present itself for treat- menit, under some onie or more ot its fouir rubrics, so soon as the mnethod of asking first what and then how comes is applied to it ". Ecclesiastical Institutions: Being Part vi. of The Principles of Socioloqy. By HERBERT SPENCER. London: Williams &amp; Norgate, 1885. Pp. 671-853. The delay of three years and a half since the publication of Mr. Spencer's previous Part, Political Institutions, has been mainly due, readers will grieve to learn, to the " ill health which has, during much of the interval, negatived even that small amount of daily work which he was previously able to get through": the remaining two Parts of Vol. ii.-Professioncal and Industrial Institutions-may, he hopes, be more promptly completed; but, he adds more despondingly, " it is possible, or even probable, that a longer rather than a shorter period will pass before they appear-if they ever appear at all ". The final chapter, " Religious Prospect and Retro- spect ' (pp. 827-43), is, save for an introductory paragraph with one addedl sentence before the last and a few verbal iinprovements, identical with the paper published in The Nineteenth Century a year ago, whiCh gave rise to so much lively discussion. Illustrations of Unconscious Memnory in Disease, includinq a Theory of A ltera- tives. By CHARLES CREIGHTON, M.D. Lonidon: H. K. Lewis, 1886. Pp. xvi., 212. Dr. Creighton has here written a book the special scientific value of which we have not yet had time (stipposing we had competence) to estimate but a word of imimiediate recognition is due to the general observations mostly contained in c. i. (" Prolegomena on Memory and Organic Meinory," pp. 4-16), with which he passes to the consideration of the physiological and (chiefly) pathological facts that concern him. While making reference to different philosophical thinkers, he may be said to base niainly upon Hering's deliverance (1868) on "Memory as a general Function of Organised Matter". He has, however, so comipletely assimi- lated this ide4 in connexion with soine suggestionls that have fallen from Prof. Baiin, as to be able to propouind a doctrilne on the relations of Memory and Generation in terms of striking felicity, which no one can read and not become curious to see how far the author may be able in the body of the work to make good his claimi (p. 2), that " the description of a certain class of maladies according to the phraseology of memory and habit" is "a real description and not a figurative".</page><page sequence="6">NEW BOOKS. 125 The Springs of Conduct. An Essay in Evolution. By C. LLOYD MORGAN. London: Kegan Paul, Trench, 1885. Pp. 317. The author's object has been " ty provide such of the general public as have the appetite and digestion for this kind of mental food-stuff with somne account of the teachings of the modern philosophy of evolution in the matter of science and conduct". Of the representatives of "science an(l the philosophy that is based upon science whose teaching he has hiniself assimilated, probably Clifford has influenced him most. In Part i. (on " Knowledge "), for example, he follows Clifford in his exposition of the social origin of the conception of objects, and in his distinction of know- ledge of objects from knowledge of 'ejects' ; in Part ii. (" The Study of Natuire ") he adopts the position that the only Uniformity of Nature we can know is " a practical uniformity "; and in Part iii. (" Through Feeling to Conduct ") he contends i1Iit iii't, is no knowledlge that has not some bearing on action. The test o-f truth is "prevision". "Practically our object is to be able to guide our actions aright in the future. Any theory which enables us to do this is practically a true theory." This is applied to knowledge of the past. When, for example, we say that the theory of evolution is true, we mean that from a knowledge of this theory the existing facts of biology could have been predicted. Among incidental positions may be mentioned one that has already been maintained by the author in Nature (against Mr. Romanes), viz., that " no science of comparative psy- chology from the ejective standpoint is possible" (p. 164). Consciousness the author (here following Mr. Romanes) holds to be the accompaniment of delay in response to stimuli, and at the same time of "diffusion" (in accordance with Prof. Bain's "law of diffusion"), which seems to him a still more important circumstance. The positions as to conduct in general by which he leads up to ethics are that, " in aiming at efficiency we are taking our best coturse to obtain pleasure," while ultimately choice is "d determined by considerations of happiness ". He insists on the social origin of all morality properly so-called. From Mr. Spencer he takes the principle that " knowledge has to be converted into feeling before it deeply influences our actions ". The end of conduct is finally stated thus: "That which, under its purely rational aspect, is greatest perfection, is, under its emotional aspect, greatest happiness " (p. 309). Scientific Meliorism and the Evolution of Happiness. By JANE HluME CLAPPERTON. London: Kegan Paul, Trench, 1885. Pp. xii., 443. This is a book of 'pragmatic philosophy,' written mainly for social edifi- cation. It is at onice inspired by great warmth of feeling and marked by hold and plain handling of practical questions now pressing. Some few chapters touch on matters of principle-as on " Happiness," " Development in Morals," " Evolution of Modern Sentiments ". The author, while taking George Eliot's coinage for her title, also gives to George Eliot the foremost place among her teachers. Anthropoid Apes. By ROBERT HARTMANN, Professor in the University of Berlin. With 63 IlLustrations. (" International Scientific Series.") London: Kegan Paul, Trench, 1885. Pp. 326. This book deals chiefly with the morphology and distribution of the anthropoid apes (the gorilla, chimpanzee, orang and gibbon); but much material is also to be found for the study of their intelligence and their emotional characters, both in captivity and in a state of nature, especially in cc. v. and vi., the last of which (pp. 259-284) is entirely devoted to "Life in Captivity". The last section of c. iii. (pp. 192-209) contains a,</page><page sequence="7">126 NEW BOOKS. comparison of the brain of anthropoids with the human brain, and a short discussion, anatomical and psychological, of some cases of microcephaly. It is found that in these cases the negative but not the positive characters of the intelligence of apes can be detected ; " the instinctive side of psy- chical activity " being (as Virchow's researches led him to conclude) " almost wholly absent". In anatomical structure, on the other band (including that of the brain), the ape-like character is often very strongly marked. Jacob Bohme: His Life and Teaching, or Studies in Theosophy. By the late Dr. HANs LASSEN MARTENSEN, Metropolitan of Denmark. Trans- lated from the Danish by T. RHYS EVANS. London: Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 1885. Pp. xvi., 344. This book, the last of Dr. Martensen's three most important works to be translated into English, is a very initelligible and sympathetic presenta- tion of the theosophical speculations of Jacob B6hme. Some introductory sections (pp. 1-52) give a short account of the life of Bohme, and of theo- sophy and its problem as conceived by him. The author himself distin- guishes theosophy as "' objective theoretical mysticism" from 1 "ssubjective practical mysticism". He thus distinguishes Bohme's conception of God from that of the mystics: " While Mysticism . . . . defines God as the unvarying nameless One, for whom every designation is inadequate and who transcends every conception, because every conception contains con- trasts while God is above all contrasts, Bohme demands a God who mani- fests himself in differences, in contrasts, in definite relations; and only this God is to him the true God." There is a pantheistic element in B6hme; but Hegel wrongly interpreted him "in a purely pantheistic sense," having but a superficial acquaintance with his writings, and being disposed to " Hegelianise him ". Bohme's special forerunners were "the whole band of German mystics, Eckehart, Tauler, Suso and the author of the Theologia Germanica " ; and, although it is impossible to prove any direct influence, "still an indirect influence fromii mediaeval Mysticism as well as from the Kabbala," Dr. Martensen thinks, " can scarcely be denied ". He was, besides, influenced by 16tlh century ideas of magic and alchemy, and especially by the ideas of Paracelsus as well as " by his certainly barbarous terminology". The Blot upon the Brain- Studies in History and Psychology. By WILLIAM W. IRELAND, M.D., Edin.; Formerly of H.M. Indian Army, &amp;c. Edinburgh: Bell &amp; Bradfute; London: Sinmpkin, Mar- shall &amp; Co., Hamilton, Adams &amp; Co., 1885. Pp. 374. The papeps collected in this volume deal chiefly with hallucinations and the phenomena of insanity continuous with them. "A hallucination," the author holds, " is always something pathological." " There is no dividing line between sanity and insanity. As the eye is not perfectly achromatic, the mind is probably never perfectly sane." Three papers are devoted to " The Hallucinations of Mohammed, Luther, and Swedenborg," " The Character and Hallucinations of Joan of Arc,)' and " St. Francis Xavier the Apostle of the Indies" * two to " The Insanity of Power" and " The Hereditary Neurosis of the Royal Family of Spain". The subjects of other papers are "Fixed Ideas," "Folie I deux,' "Unconscious Cerebra- tion," "1 Thought without Words and the Relation of Words to Thought," "Left-handedness and Right-headedness," " Mirror-writing," "The Dual Functions of the Double Brain ". The author has collected information from a wide range of authorities. On the whole he shows himself more anxious to give the facts copiously than to come to definite conclusions as</page><page sequence="8">NEW BOOKS. 127 to their causes. In discussing "the dual finctions of the brain" for exanmple, he points out how little significance is to be attached to the stateimients of patients with " double personality " as to the seat of con- sciousness. "The insane are quick to catch at new scientific notions to explain their delusions. Complaints of being electrified and magnetised against their will have long been common. . . In a similar fashion the medical superintendents of asyluims will hear mnany whimsical appli- cations of the conception of the dual functions of the brain should it become popularised " (pp,. 344-45). Fichte's Science of Knowledae. A Critical Exposition. By CHARLES CARROLL EVERETT, D.D., Bussey Professor of Theology in Harvard University; Author of The Scientce of Thought, (" Griggs's Philosophical Classics ".) Chicago: S. C. Griggs &amp; Co., 1884. Pp. xvi., 287. Of this book (which, though issued earlier, has reached us later than the last volume of the series, noticed in MIND, Vol. x. 469) the first chapter (pp. 1-17) is biographical, the last (c. xiii., pp. 274-287) critical, all the rest expository. The author's point of view is indicated in the remark that Kant "may be regarded as the Julius C'esar, as Hegel was the Augustus of modern philosophy" (p. 22). The exposition of Fichte is founded chiefly on the [Wissenschaftslehre, but reference is mliade to hiis other writings, "sufficient, it is hoped, to show the relation which the results reached in this work bear to his systemn as a whole". The author holds that "the so-called earlier and later systems of Fichte" are "the comple- mental elements of a single system ". " The great difference between them is found in tlhe fact that, in his earlier works, Fichte started from psycho- logical analysis, and moved toward an ontology; in his later works, he started from the ontology, and based his psychology directly upon this" (p. 269). Not only did Fichte's dialectical method prepare the way for Hegel, but in part his system was " wrought out with a skill that could not be surpassed". It is Hegel, however, "who makes us feel ourselves most really in the presence of the miiaster of a constructive dialectic ". On the other hand, there is more of moral iinspiration in Fichte. "Hegel remains the master in the world of thought; Fichte, in that of life." Outlines of Practical Philosophy. Dictated Portions of the Lectures of HERMANN LOTZE. Translated and Edited by GEORGE T. LADD, Professor of Philosophy in Yale College. Boston: Ginn &amp; Co., 1885. Pp. xii., 156. Prof. Ladd has with this translation, following upon the Metaphysic and -the Philosophy of Religion, noted in MIND, Vol. x. 470, completed the first part of his scheme of introducing English readers to the series of Lotze's Dictate; and it is to be hoped that he will not fail to proceed with the Psychology, the zXsthetics, and the Logic, in regard to which he renews a conditional promise. In the case of the Practical Philosophy, he follows the second German edition which had aone back from the paragraphs given in the first edition as last dictated in 1880 to the earlier form of 1878- and this for the reason that the earlier cast included sections on Marriage and the Family and on the Intercourse of Men afterwards omitted. The translator (who proved his competence in the Metaphysic) remarks on the special interest attaching to the Practical Philosophy in that it gives, in default of the unwritten third part of his system, the only approach to a -systematic treatment of ethics which Lotze has left; and he truly notes, among other points, that Lotze shows rare and delicate tact in discerning the weak places in the extremes of Rigorism and Eudaemonism in morals. An Index is added, as in former parts of the translated series.</page><page sequence="9">128 NEW BOOKS. On Small Differences of Sensation. By C. S. PEIRCE and J. JASTROW, Johns Hopkins University. Pp. 11. "An off-print of a paper in Vol. iii. of the Transactions of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (read Oct. 17, 1884), giving account of a series of experiments on the pressure-sense, instituted with a view to disproving Fechner's hypotlhesis of discrete increments of sensation. The experiments seem to the authors to "destroy all presunmption in favour of an Unterschiedsschwelle ". Essai sur le Systerne philosophique des Stoiciens. Par F. OGEREAU, Agrege de Philosophie. Ouvrage reconipense par l'Academie des Sciences morales et politiques. Paris: F. Alcan, 1885. Pp. xii., 304. The author divides the history of Stoicism into three periods: (1) the purely Greek period (the 3rd and part of the 2nd century, B.C.); (2) the period of its propagation at Rome, during which, however, it remiiained essentially Greek (the latter part of the 2nd and a considerable part of the 1st century B.C.); (3) the Roman period (to the end of the 2nd century A.D. after which it was no longer a livinc, ohilosophy). In c. i. the "Unity of doctrine among the first Stoics" is demonstrated. Then follows a continuous exposition of the Stoic system (cc. ii.-ix.), treated under the heads of " Being " ; " The World " ; " Man " ; " The Criterion of Truth " ; " Dialectics "; " The Sovereign Good"; " The Sage; the City "; " Theodicy and Religion". This exposition is founded as mnuch as possible on the records of the teaching of the earlier Stoics down to Panaetius; it is unmixed with criticism, but is acconmpanied by references and quotations in footnotes. The last chapter (x.) demonstrates the "Preservation of the primitive doctrine among the last Stoics ". The result is that, while from the point of view of literary and of general history the most impor- tant position may have to be assigned to the later Stoics, to Seneca, to Epictetus and to Marcus Aurelius, in doctrine they added nothing to what they had received from their teachers. Fromn the point of view of the history of philosophy and of scientific ideas, justice has not yet been done to the founders of Stoicism, to Zeno, to Cleanithes and to Chrysip- pus, who in their physics were the first to indicate "the antinomy of determinism which alone renders science possible and of liberty without which all morality disappears," an antinomy which they solved in the spirit of Leibniz; who in their logic made " one of the happiest efforts to explain how the existence of error does not destroy all possibility of certi- tude " ; and who in their theory of the smnmnuom bonrom placed morality, as Kant did afterwards, not in what is done but in the internal disposition, while they had over him " the advantage of being able to give logically a material content to the form in which consists exclusively the morality of our acts". The author seeks to show that, in spite of the paradoxes to which it was led by its clean-cut logical distinctions, Stoicism, in accord- ance with its metaphysical doctrine of the continuity of all being, always kept in view the shades by whiclh opposite things and actions pass into one another. Its paradoxes, therefore, are paradoxes chiefly in form and are corrected by the spirit of the doctrine. La Morale d'Epicntre et ses RItpports avec les Doctrintes contemporaines. Par- M. GUYAU.

Eldments de Psychologie Physiologique. Par W. WUNDT, Professeur i. l'Universite de Leipzig. Traduits de l'Allemand sur la deuxiime edition avec l'autorisation de l'Auteur par le Dr. ILIE, ROUvIER, de Pignan, prced6s d'une nouvelle Preface de l'Auteur et d'une Intro- duction par M. D. NOLEN, Recteur de l'Acad'eriie de Douai. Avec 180 Figures dans le Texte. 2 Tomes. Paris: F. Alcan, 1886. Pp. xxxii., 571, 532. In the absence still of any English translation, this French rendering of Prof. Wundt's celebrated work should be welcome to many English students who are unable to read the original. It is specially prefaced by a couple of pages from the author himself (written at the end of 1884), as well as by a fairly appreciative summary of his psyechologieal work from M. Nolen, to whom the translation is dedicated by a ill lmIl ii pupil. Prof. Wundt, in his few paragraphs, after generally commiending the exposition by which M. Ribot (in La Psychologie allemande) first made him known to French readers, takes occasion to correct the one false imipression which he thinks M. Ribot gave, in representing the experimental movement as having decidedly gained the upper hand in Germany: however this may -be hoped for in the future, it is not so at present. " In Germnany, there are a number of psychological directions profoundly at variance with one another, though their representatives agree in detesting experinmental or physiological psy- chology, and in being inclined to consider the teaching of its principles and results as a sort of blasphemy. They think of it as Dogberry did of thieves: ' For such kind of men, the less you meddle or inake with them, why, the more is for your honesty'." La Science romaine d t'Epoque d'Auguste.

Alcan, 1885. Pp. 174. This volume is a careful exposition of the state of the physical sciences at Rome in the time of Augustus, based on the information given inci- dentally by Vitruvius in his work on architecture. The course of the exposition is accompanied in each chapter by translated extracts from Vitruvius. The chapters are: (1) "General remarks on Vitruvius and his treatise on Architecture " ; (2) " Historical anecdotes " ; (3) " Manners and Customs"; (4) "Mathematics-Astronomy"; (5) "Mechanics"; (6) " Physics " ; (7) " Chemistry " ; (8) "Natural History-Geography- Geology-Materials of Ctnstruction"; (9) Hygiene-Medicine"; (10) " Of the different species of Constructions ".

" In England, Stuart Mill, more an economist than a philosopher, but more of a metaphysician than Littre, in his Essays on Logic founded on Induction, is only half a positivist; it is the same with Huxley. Both have declared that society could not exist without religious dogma " (p. 78). An Appendix of 52 pp. consists of a summary of the history of France from the Roman times, concluding with some controversial matter relating to current politics. Between the Introduction and the Appendix the author reviews the sciences from astronomy to biology (Bk. i., pp. 84-184), " refuting " Darwin and Haeckel by the way ; describes " The three intelli- gences in man and the origin of the particular mental faculties " (Bk. ii., pp. 185-256); and discusses the question " Ought man to be abandoned to himself, or ought he to impose on himself a religious dogma ?" (Bk. iii., pp. 257-316). It is concluded that " a religious dogma is indispensable to society" (p. 305). The author himself proposes an eclectic creed, the "principal points" of which are arranged in the form of three "duties towards God," thirteen " duties towards one's neighbour," and six " duties towards oneself". In order to "unite men in the same philosophical views" and thus prevent society from falling " more and more into anarchy," he thinks it is absolutely necessary "to form an assembly of men of moderate spirit," who are to " constitute a code of philosophy upon irrefutable data " (p. 315). Les Sentiments, les Passions et la Folie. Explications des Phenomenes de la Pensee et des Sensations. Cinq Conferences faites a la Salle des Capucines en 1884. Par AMEDE'E H. SIMONIN, Membre et Laureat de la Societe nationale d'Encouragement au Bien. Paris: J. Michelet, 1885. Pp. 431. M. Simonin, who is also the author of a Treatise on Psychology, a Historqy of Psychology and a volume entitled Materialism Unmasked, here undertakes to establish that " the soul exists by itself," on the ground that " its facul- ties called memory, will, observation, comparison, reflection, &amp;c., have no corresponding organs in the brain ". To the parts of the brain he assigns "psy6hophysical " functions subordinate to the faculties of the soul; de- scribing the pineal gland, for example, as " a psychophysical instrument of which the soul makes use for its needs as the telegraph clerk makes use of his electrical machine" (pp. 12-13). If man will not recognise "the laws of the psychical world" as here set forth, and recognise also " the action of Providence," then, in the author's opinion, he will soon be "gorillise, chang4 en bete, comme feu Nabuchodonosor" (p. 401). After explaining his doctrines in Part i., M. Simonin goes on to describe two imaginary cities: the first, " Insaniapolis " or " the civilised world governed by the passions," as it is at present; the second, " Raisonville " or "society living under the empire of the laws of reason " demonstrated in the present work. In his Second Part, he attacks pretty impartially members of the Academy, Mal- thusians and Opportunists, as well as Materialists and German Pessimists. Les Principes de la Ddcouverte.

Paris: Plon, Nourrit &amp; Cie.; Leipzig: Duncker &amp; Humblot; Luxembourg: F. Beifrit, 1885. Pp. vi., 264. The Academiy of Sciences of Berlin having offered a prize for the best critical exposition of the philosophical theories of causation that have influenced science during the last three centuries, with a view to the solu- tion of the question as to the true meaniing and validity of the law of causa- tion, the author sent in the two answers printed in the present volume: the</page><page sequence="12">NEW BOOKS. 131 first in French (pp. 1-168); the second and shorter (pp. 171-242) in German (here accompanied by a French translation). The thesis maintained in the first essay is that no statement of the law of causation by any modern philosopher has had or could have had the smallest influence on science, but that Aristotle's theory of causation is capable of perfectly explaining all the scientific discoveries of moderni times. Aristotle, indeed, has had no direct influence on modern science; his statement of the law of causation is confused, and in the sixteenth century could only be inisunderstood along with his other doctrines; but after three centuries of scientific discovery, it has at length become possible to see in Aristotle's principles the ground of all the progress that has been made. Aristotle's two principles, when disentangled from the confusion in which he leaves them, are (1) that the cause is that which is primitive in the 'kind' to be explained, (2) that induction gives the universal by the discovery of ideas between which there is no differenice. "It was Galileo, by his great discovery of the laws of the fall of bodies, who gave the most remarkable example of the accuracy of the Aristotelian rules. Stones fall because bodies attract one another in the direct ratio of the masses and the inverse ratio of the squares of the dis- tances, that is to say, stones fall because the parts of matter, the primitive of the kind in question, the cause according to Aristotle, fall towards one another in the direct ratio of the masses and the inverse ratio of the squares of the distances, ideas the same contained in the same manner in each of the parts of matter." In the second essay it is argued that all modern statements of the law of causation involve a vicious circle, but that Leibniz has supplied a basis for scientific discovery in the principle of sufficient reason, of which the law of causalitv is "an elementary and incomplete form". It has been the author's intention, in a paper read before the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences and printed at the end of the volume (pp. 245-264), to reconcile the answers given in the two essays by showing the agreement between " the law of causality interpreted according to the theory of the greatest philosopher of Greece and the principle of sufficient reason as it was formulated by the most illustrious thinker of Germany ". E. SPENCER ed E. MORSELLI. Scienza e 1eligione. Milano-Torino: Fra- telli Dumolard, 1884. Pp. 47. The Director of the R1ivista di Filosofic scientifica here reprints a (translated) article of Mr. Herbert Spencer's on " The Past and Future of Religion" (an extract from Part vi. of the Princi}ples of Sociology) which has already appeared in his Review, along with a criticism of Mr. Spencer's general doctrine of the relations of science and religion, published in the same number. His first line of criticism is that, Mr. Spencer's point of view (in Fi'st Principles) being admitted, the ultimate conception of reli- gion and of metaphysics, the conception of the unknowable, or of the ideal, cannot be identified with the ultimate conception of science, the conception of an uinknown reality, an "infinite and eternal energy ". The sentiment of philosophic "admiration" which, according to Mr. Spencer, is excited by this energy, has nothing in common with the religious sentiment of "veneration ". The attitude of the human mind towards nature has gradually passed from the emotional to the intellectual, in other words, from the religious to the scientific phase; and the scientific and religious attitudes are inconsistent with one another. But further, Mr. Spencer's point of view is inconsistent with positive philosophy. The desire to frame some hypothesis of an " absolute " or " unknowable " is, it must be admitted, ineradicable from the human mind; but to the problem of satis- fying this desire neither science nor positive philosophy has anything to say.</page><page sequence="13">132 NEW BOOKS. Die Itcaienische Philosophie des neunzeshnten Jahrhunderts. Von Dr. KARL WERNER. Dritter Band: Die Kritische Zersetzung und speculative Umbildung des Ontologismus. Wien: G. P. Faesy, 1885. Pp. xiv., 424. Vols. i. and ii. of this work were noticed in MIND, Vol. x. 479. The new volume brings down the history of the Italian philosophy of the 19th century to the immediate present. Three more volumes are to follow, dealing respectively with contemporary phlilosoplly as a whole (iv.), with the special philosophical disciplines so far as the thought of the Italian civilisation has specifically stamped itself on them (v.), and with the specifically ecclesiastical philosophy of Italy (vi.). The divisions of the present volume are (1) The critical decomposition of Ontologism (Giuseppe Ferrari, Ausonio Franchi, Criticism as transition to Christianity in the "teleological objectivismi " of B. Mazzarella); (2) The pantheistic trans- formation of Ontologism in Italian Hegelianism (Vera, Spaventa, Mariano, d'Ercole, the reaction against Hegelianism in South and North Italy); (3) The return-movement of reconciliation of modern Ontologism to the specu- lative Mysticism and Scholasticism of the Middle Age (A. Conti). 'ssays. Von WILHELM WUNDT. Leipzig: W. Enigelmann, 1885. Pp. 386. These Essays, some of which have already been printed, range over a wide field of psychological and philosophical study. The last three (xii.-xiv.) are applications of the author's ideas to slightly outlying subjects. Two of these ("Der Aberglaube in der Wissenschaft," "Der Spiritismus") are to be regarded as studies of aberrant psychical pheno- mena; the third (" Lessing n-nd die kritische Methode") is intended to illustrate the method of exact criticism from the classical examples of Lessing's Laokoon and Ilamburgische Drctmaturgie. The thought that is expressed in the opening essay on " Philosophy and Science," and that runs I hrough the book, is applied in this last essay to literary criticism. Lessing's critical method is here explained to be the development before the eyes of the reader of the exact course of the writer's own thought. Lessing always b)egins with concrete examples, from these gradually proceeds to general principles, and theni ends with the further application of these general principles to details. The metlhod of philosophy, the author maintains, ought to resemble this critical method rather than the method of abstract deduction. Philosophy should no longer try to hold itself independent of the special sciences as in antiquity ; but, instead of attaching its speculations to the ideas of common consciousness, should set cut from the critically tested results Qf special research. In antiquity the special sciences were really branches of philosophy, but this relation has become inverted : they are now rather its foundation. A movement towards unity following the detachment of science from philosophy, which was effected in the Alexan- (Irian period, is already perceptible in special science itself. In "The Problenms of Experimental Psychology" (v.), Prof. Wundt contends that, while its point of view has long since been passed, Cartesian dualism has become in modern times akind of philosophic orthodoxy like the Aris- totelianism of the Middle Age. Psychology must overcome this traditional cloctrine by taking from the hands of mechanical science the weapon of exact experimental research. There are in this essay some interesting remarks on the relations of psychology to comparative mythology and the science of language. Prof. Wundt thinks that in the end more will be gained for psychology from the study of the myths preserved in the litera- tures of ancient civilised peoples than from study of the beliefs of modern</page><page sequence="14">NEW BOOKS. 133 savages. On the other hand, the languages of uncivilised peoples, in the material offered by the laws of formation of words, perhaps promise more to the psychologist than the fixed languages of civilised races. The opposite, again, is the case with rules of syntax. It is pointed out as a favour- able circulmstance for the psychologist, that, just when the experimental methods of physiological psychology cease to be applicable, speech offers itself as an object which, through its independence of the observer and its modifications under changing, conditions, is adapted for experimnental investigation. Here we see what an extended sense is given to the " experimental method" that is advocated, in opposition to the method of " self-observation " (taken in the sense of attention to passing states of consciousness) which Prof. Wundt condemns as unscientific. Logos. Ursprung und Wesen der Begriffe. Von LUDWIG NOIRE. Leip- zig: W. Engelmann, 1885. Pp. xvi., 362. In this new 'work the author reaffirms the doctrine that reason is coextensive with speech, and that the essential character of man is his power of thinking by means of general conceptions, which without words are impossible. The problem that the science of language offers to philosophy is, he says, to explain how the limited number of roots to which it brings back actual languages were fornied originally as the signs of activities. This problem he attempts to answer by successively limiting it. First, primitive roots must denote human activities ; secondly, these activities mnust be social; lastly, it is only social creative activities that have the capability of awakening thought and speech together. The general theory of language maintained by the author in opposition to the "imita- tion " and "interjection " theories, he describes preferably as the iLogos- theory ". His solution of the problem of the origin of general conceptions, "the most important in the whole of philosophy," and the special subject of the present work, is a kindl of Conceptualism. He holds that "the great advance of modern philosophy is the clear consciousness of the pos- session of general conceptions as particular beings in the thinking spirit ". The ancients had not this clear consciousness, but spoke of " things " when they meant concepts. The founder of Conceptualism was Abelard ; but in the Middle Ages, preoccuLpied with the inner life, it was impossible that due importance should be assigned to objects or to words. Locke, in tracing knowledge to experience, gave their, part to objects ; he also showed the dependence of thought on speech ; but although he recognised that words are not the signs of things but of concepts ("abstract ideas"), he could not solve completely the problem of general conceptions, because he did not recognise the creative activity of thought. It was left for Kant, by a Rew departure in philosophy, to make possible the completion of the theories both of Locke and of Abelard. Der psychologische Ursprung des Rechts. Von Professor Dr. J. HOPPE. Wirzburg: A. Stuber, 1885. Pp. 103. An examination of IDr. Stricker's Physiologie des Bechts (see MIND, Vol. x. 310), together with the statement of an alternative theory of the origin of law and the sense of "right". In the author's view the "consciousness of right" ought to be traced to "the noble feelings of the knowing being," not to primitive feelings of power. We must not seek for its origin in "contracts" ancl " juristic rights," themselves inexplicable without the possibility of that satisfaction of the "noble" or "spiritual" feelings in which the "right" consists. It is because these feelings do not find full expression in actual contracts and their observance that the State</page><page sequence="15">134 NEW BOOKS. has to interfere with its superior force. Penalties are consequently to be regarded as imposed in the interest of the noble feelings by the govern- ment in its quality of impartial spectator. Thus the sense of right, present from the first, gradually finds expression in law, an expression which, however, must always remain inadequate. The growth of law, therefore, can give no help towards the explanation of the origin of this sense. Die Vollendung des Sokrates. Immanuel Kant's Grundlegung zur Reform der Sittenlehre dargestellt von Dr. HEINRICH ROMUNDT. Berlin: Nicolaische Verlags-Buchlandlung (R. Stricker), 1885. Pp. vi., 304. This book bears the same relation to the practical philosophy of Kant as the author's Grundlegung zur Reform der Philosophie (see MIND, Vol. x. 626) to the theoretical. Like the previous work, it is intended, first of all, as a "simplified and extended" exposition of Kant's results. What Kant did in practical philosophy was to complete the Socratic doctrine of virtue and to give it a scientific character. In doing this he solved the problenm of the highest good by preparing a secure passage from knowledge to faith. The author is dissatisfied with all other interpreters and suc- cessors of Kanlt, whom he divides into " creepers " (the Neo-Kantians) and " fliers " (Fichte, Schelling, Hegel). " But in truth neither the creepers nor the fliers are to be compared with Kant. For Kant wished that Reason in philosophy should neither fly nor creep, but, like man himself, walk upright between earth and heaven," the head raised to the regions of Faith, the feet set firmrly on the solid ground of mathematical and physical science (p. 301). Kantischer Kriticismus gegeniiber unkritischem Dilettantismus. Von Dr. J. H. WITTE, Professor der Philosophie an der Universitit Bonn. Bonn: Cohen, 1885. Pp. 66. The author, while replying to a pamphlet of Dr. St6hr, called forth by his review in the Philosophische Monatshefte of the latter's Analyse der reinen Naturwissenschaft Kant's (1884), takes occasion to set forth the general principles of the critical philosophy "in opposition to uncritical dilettantismn," with a view to the interests of a wider circle of readers than those who have followed the controversy between hiniself and Dr. Stohr. The reply to Dr. Stohr extends to p. 30 ; in the first of two appended sections (viii., pp. 30-33), the author proposes a modification of Kant's deduction of the categories ; in the second (ix., pp. 33-40) he gives a useful classified index of the more important Kantian literature of the last 25 years. The notes especially (pp. 41-66) have an interest independent of the particular controversy. In the last (" A word on Goethe's relation to Kant and Spinoza") it is contended that Kant's influence on Goethe was greater and Spinoza's less than is generally supposed. Kant's Theorie der Erfahruing. Von HERMANN COHEN, Professor an der Universitat Marburg. Zweite neubearbeitete Auflage. Berlin: Diimmler, 1885. Pp. xxiv., 616. This second edition of Prof. Cohen's classical work is more than twice the size of the first edition (1871). The Introduction (pp. 1-79), which now replaces a short introductory chapter of 10 pp., contains a full account of Kant's relation to his predecessors from Plato onwards. The part of that chapter dealing with "1 the logical determination of space and tinme " is incorporated with c. i., which corresponds to c. ii. of the first edition. Chapter v. of the old edition (" Trendelenburg's view of the gap in the transcendental proof") is now omitted. Two or three changes are made in the titles of chapters; cc. iii. and iv. of the first edition are transposed;</page><page sequence="16">NEW BOOKS. 135 c. vii. of the first edition is divided into two; and two new chapters have been added (pp. 551-616), " Das Princip der formalen Zweckmassigkeit " (c. xv.) and "Das Systenm des kritischen Idealismus" (c. xvi.). For the rest, while the general plan of the work is preserved, the modifications do not consist merely in additions; those parts that are substantially identical with the chapters of the first edition have been thoroughly revised, in mlany cases rearranged and rewritten. That which has been from the first the author's view of Kant is thus restated " Till the time of Kant there was metaphysic as art; only with him begins metaphysic as science" (p. 576). The historical is not to be disconnected from the " systematic " view of Kant; in the importance, other than historical, of Kant's work for every student of philosophy is the real justification of that minute study of his words that has been called " Kant-philology ". The principal new deve- lopments in this edition are in two directions. In order to make more complete the exposition of that part of the theory of experience that has the closest connexion with the ethical theory, the doctrine of Ideas had to be " taken up into the doctrine of Experience ". This has been done on the basis of the author's intermediate work, Kant's Begriindung der Ethik (see MIND, Vol. iii. 153)-the ethical doctrine itself being of course excluded from the present exposition. For this rehabilitation of the part of the doc- trine of Ideas that belongs to the theory of Experience, " the quintessence of the Synthetic Principles," the account of which the author considers to have been defective in the first edition, had to be sufficiently developed. Adequate treatment of the whole body of them became easier when the principle of Intensive Quantity was disclosed as central among them; while also their elements-Space, Time, and the Categories-had new light thereby thrown upon them. Insight into the significance of the central principle, joined with consideration of the principle of Anticipations, determined the second direction in which new developments have been found necessary. It was seen that Kant's relations to mathematical and physical science, and in particuilar to Newton and Leibniz and their conception of infinitesimals, requiired more exact definition. The author's work, )cts Princip der- Infinitesimal-Methode utnd seine Geschichte (see MIND, Vol. ix. 159) was inteinded to supply the basis, so far as this conception is concerned, for the historical view now sketched in the Introduction. The new edition is dedicated "to the memory of Friedrich Albert Lange ". Die Lehre vorn ctpriorischen Wissen in ihrer Bedeutung fur die Entwvicklung der Ethik uend Erkenntnisstheorie in der Sokratisch-Platonischen Philo- sophie. Von Dr. phil. M. GUGGENHEIm. Berlin: Diimmler, 1885. Pp. 79. The developinent of Plato's doctrine of a priori knowledge is here treated in relationl to his ethics. In the putting of the Socratic question as to the nature of virtue in the Meno, the author sees the starting point ot this whole development, which in the Phaedo culminates in the distinc- tion between the worlds of " being," " the true," " the good," on the one hand, and of "becoming, " tlle false," "the bad," on the other; the former of these being the object of Cr'Im7,, the latter of *rEv8is 80':a. In the mliddle of the development comes the Thecetetus, where the most important dlistinctions of the Platonic theory of knowledge are to be traced; and lhere, accordingly, is for the author the centre of interest. In his last two sectiolns (pp. 37-79) he discusses minutely the polenmic against Protagoras ; showing how a positive doctrine of a priori knowledge was developed in opposition to Sensualism by means of this polemnic, and how it was con- nected in the mind of Plato with "the ethical-cestlietic ideas" which were the beginning and the end of his philosophy.</page><page sequence="17">136 NEW BOOKS. Kant's Lehre von der Freiheit. Ein Beitrag zur Lisung des Problems der Willensfreiheit. Von Dr. CARL GERHARD. Heidelberg: G. Weiss, 1885. Pp. 84. Kant's doctrine of freedom is expounded in Sections i.-iv. ; Section v. is a criticism of the Kantian doctrine; in Section vi. (pp. 59-84) the author attempts a positive solution of the problem of freedom. He accepts from Kant the position that without free-will there can be no moral responsi- bility; and he refuises to acknowledge as true freedom the "empty fiction" of a "liberty of indifference ". Freedom is the power man has of taking part in the formation of his own character. Human freedom is always relative and limited; for the direction is already given in many respects to character at birth by innate dispositions; but only so far as character is the work of freedom is a man responsible for his character. This freedom is quite compatible with the necessity of human actions. Freedom is not the opposite of necessity but of compulsion; the opposite of necessity is contingency (p. 76). "c Particular actions are necessary," being the product of character and motives, "but the will, or rather the person willing, is free". The freedomi of the person is manifested in action according to fixed maxims. This view of freedom the author regards as founded on Kant's doctrine, and as substantially identical with the essential part of it. The placing of the free act outside time, and the distinction of the intelli- gible and the empirical character, are indeed rejected. But, as regards the first point, it is contended that Kant also recognises the freedom that consists in the power of modifying character in the actual course of life ; and, as regards the second point, the term "character," as used by the author, is really identical with Kant's "intelligible character". For the effect of the Kantian doctrine of the " intelligible character " is to attach the idea of freedom to that in man which is internal, instead of to its external or " empirical" manifestations. Das Gruindgesetz der TVissenschaft. Von EMANUEL JAESCHE, Dr. med. Heidelberg: G. Weiss, 1886. Pp. xx., 445. The fundamental law of scientific knowledge, which it is the author's aim to set forth, is the requiirement that each group of things should be completely deternlined as a " scientific whole " in relation to the unity of knowledge. The conception of knowledge as a unity, and of the deter- mination of things in relation to it as the encl of science, is to be kept in view in every kind of special research. This idea, stated in the " General Part " (pp. 3-36), the author tries to work out in the " Special Part " of his book (pp. 39-445), under the heads of " The corporeal World," " The ani- mated World," " The conscious World," and " The self-conscious World ". Die Grenzen des Glauibens. Von ANTON OLZELT-NEWIN. Wien: C. Kone- gen, 1885. Pp. 43. An examination of belief in the law of causation, free-will, &amp;c., intended to show that in each case the only position intellectually justifiable is scepticism. Philosophy -will "alwavs remain the science of insoluble questions," and is " more an affair of need and of taste, more an art than a kind of knowledge". With philosophy must be classed religion. "Iu both, agreement in the most useful belief is possible, inot through argu- ments, but, as in politics, when judgments, feelings, and needs of men have become alike." This agreement is obtained as the result of an authoritative appeal by teachers to the experience of life. The few who carry their intellectual conscientiousness so far as to be inaccessible to such appeals either remain uninfluenced by "those powers that build a world</page><page sequence="18">NEW BOOKS. 137 out of the heart, or philosophy and religion are to them no longer anything but a private belief which becomes silent as soon as it comes into the light of day ". Die Illusion der Willensfreiheit. Ihre Ursachen und ihre Folgen. Vou Dr. PAUL RE'E. Berlin: C. Duncker (C. Heymons), 1885. Pp. 54. The author follows up his investigations of the origin of the moral feel- ings and of conscience (see MIND Vols. iv. 581 and x. 475) by a brief discussion of free-will, which he finds to be "not a moral truth, but a psychological error ". The illusion of free-will has two expressions: the belief, as to the past, that we might have acted differently, and the belief, as to the future, that " we can do what we will "; both of which beliefs are true in the sense that there are always more physical possibilities than are actually realised, but false if taken, as they commonly are, in the sense that the will is ever free from the law of causation. The ground of the illusion is that we do not know, or know only imperfectly, the causes of the actions of ourselves and others. When the belief in free-will-in an uncaused beginning of action-is seen to be an illusion, actions and characters may still be to us " sympathetic " or " antipathetic," but-except for a remnant of habit-moral condemnation or praise of the actions of others, as well as remorse or self-approval for our own actions, mriust disappear. Kant's doc- trine of noumenal freedom is founded on this incompatibility of the neces- sity of htuman actions with the imputation to them of guiilt or merit; together with the fact that, even when men have explained actions, they still pass the same moral judgments on them as before. In criticism of Kant's argument, the author points out that to regard an action as com- pletely determined, to contemplate it "sub specie necessitatis" is much more than "'explanation " in the popular sense. The power of viewing actions entirely in their causal relations is reached only by a few; and even with those few there are remains of customary modes of thought. When the determinist point of view has been ftully attained, the fact is no longer as Kant describes it; all imputation of guilt and merit disappears. To explain this imputation, then, there is no need of tlle assumption that actions are free; it is sufficient that they are held to be free. Kritische Grundlegutng des Transcendentalen Realismus.

The author begins by distinguishing the " teleological pessimism" of Schopenhauer, which iiiaintains the complete irrationality of the world, fromi the " eudaemonological pessimism" of Hartmann, which only main- tains its irrationality with respect to the balance of pleasure and pain. The earlier pessimism is a necessary consequence of the metaphysics of the alogical Will, while the later and more moderate pessimism (to which, indeed, the term " pessimism," as Hartmann himiiself admits, is not strictly</page><page sequence="19">138 NEW BOOKS. applicable) is really in contradiction with the doctrine of the all-wise Unconscious, and has to be brought into Hartmann's svstem on empirical grounds. It is these empirical grouncls that the author sets himself to investigate. While making many criticisms of detail on Hartnianli's attempted proof that there is a balance of pain in the world, he directs the chief force of his attack against the application of the eudemonistic measure to the worth of life. No strictly quantitative comparison of pleasures and pains such as Hartmann attempts is practicable; and even if it were possible to measure feelings iil the way proposed, this would not decide the question whether existence is preferable to non-existence. The fundamental error of pessimism is that it regards happiness as the only rational end of the process of things. Not all forms of happiness indif- ferently need be in causal relation to the principle of things, but only that happiness which is in itself rational because it proceeds from " the moral will ". For the production of the moral will a process of developinent is required, of which pain forms part. The feeling of happiness in which attainment of the rational end manifests itself is accompanied by indif- ference to the pleasures ancl pains that proceed from external causes. This was recognised by the ancient moralists of all schools, who placed happi- ness in an internal state. Hartmrann himself makes such an internal state the ethical end of his pessimism. The pessimistic renunciation of the search for happiness in external objects, the identification of the ends of the individual with those of the Unconscious, results in a state of the moral agent by which he is raised above all'particular pleasures and pains. The possibility of the attainment of this state makes the eudeemonistio measure inapplicable, and thus ethical pessimism is sufficient in itself to (lestroy the pessiimiistic conclusions. Emil Du Bois-Reymond. Eine Kritik seiner Weltansiclht. Von THEODOR WEBER. Gotha: F. A. Perthes, 1885. Pp. x., 264. This criticism of what seems to the author the thorough-going and con- sequent materialism of Du Bois-Reymond's view of the world has for its ultimate aim to "Christianise science ". Especially, he seeks to refute Du Bois-Reymnond's "ever returning affirmation that where supernaturalism begins science enids ". The great defect of Dui Bois-Reymonld's view is found to be " the arbitrary assumption of the eternity of prinmitive atoms ". The true conception of nature is that of a " real principle,"' at first "in- different," but capable of becoming "atomised". Nature, thus knowvn as it really is, leads the way directly to God as its creator. Die Lehre Herbarts von der menschlichen Seele, mit Herbarts eigenen Worten zuzammengestellt von HEINRIcHE FREE. Bernburg: Bacmeister, 1885. Pp. viii., 74. The object of this book is to give such a condensed exposition of Her- bart's psychological conceptions as may prepare for the understanding of his pedagogics. The text is entirelv in Herbart's own words ; olly the selection of extracts and the arrangement of the paragraphs being the auithor's. Die Lehre vomr Wesen des Gewissens in der Scholastik des dreizehnten Jahr- hunder-ts. Ein Beitrag zur Geschichte der Etbik. Erster Theit: Die FranciscanerschuLle. Von Dr. HUB. THEOPHIL SIMAR, Professor der Katholischen Theologie an der Universitat zu Bonn. Freiburg i. B.: Herder, 1885. Pp. 32. The author proposes in the present work to give an account of the Scholastic doctrine of the conscience that shall do justice to the minor</page><page sequence="20">NEW BOOKS. 139 figures of the Scholastic movement, neglected in the ordinary histories. For different reasons, he maintains in discussing the origins of Scholas- ticism, there could be lno philosophical doctrine of the conscience either in anticiiiitr or in the Patristic period; and it was in the 13th century that 11ie va Ii i-l attempts were made to explain its nature. A part of the Scholastics seek the foundation of conscience in the powers of conation (in modern terminology, "the feelings ") and in knowledge; others place it exclusively in the reason. The first conception is that of the Franciscans, Bonaventura and Alexander of Hales; the second that of the Dominicans, Albert the Great and Thomas Aquinas. All the 13th century investiga- tions of the conscience were started by the Aristotelian psychology, especially by the distinction of cognitive and active powers. Further, the form and content of these investigations attach themselves to a gloss taken from the commentary of St. Jerome on Ezekiel, in which conscience is spoken of under the double name of TvvT?7pq)-tvs and conscientita. Alexander of Hales was the first to make use of this gloss for the construction of a tlheory of conscience; but Bonaventura was the first to distinguish clearly the two terms by giving the name synteresis (or, as it was conmmonly mis- spelt, synderesis) to the disposition of the will, conscientica to the intellective side of conscience. In the Second Part of his work, the author will pro- ceed to the doctrine of conscience as developed by the Dominican school. Die Erklarung des Gedankenlesens nebst Beschreibung eines neuen Verfahrens zumn Nachweise unwi'llkirlicher Bewegungen. Von W. PREYER, Pro- fessor der Physiologie an der Universitiat Jena. Mit 26 Original- Holzschnitten im Text. Leipzig: Th. Grieben (L. Fernau), 1886. Pp. 70. In the first of these papers the author describes how Dr. Beard, Dr. Carpenter and himself have all arrived by different ways at the. explanation of "thought-reading" from indications given to the thought-reader by unconscious muscular movements. This explanation, suggested to Car- penter by experiments on hypnotism and to Beard by his knowledge of the results of Fritsch and Hitzig, was suggested to the author by his researches on the involuntary impulsive movements of unborn and newly- born animals and of very young children. The second paper contains an account of the construction and use of the apparatus he has devised for registering uncolnscious muscular movements of all kinds. The descrip- tions given in the third paper show with how much rapidity and accuracy it is possible for one practised in reading the indications given by these movements to write or draw any numbers, letters, figures, &amp;c., that are intently thought of by the subject of the experiment. The fourth paper is an elaborate critical examination of M. Richet's late attempt (in the Revue Philosophique, ix. 12) to prove a direct transmission of thought from brain to brain. Dr. Preyer's conclusion is that out of the whole series of experiments brought in evidence by M. Richet, nothing remains that can lend the least support to the entirely superfluous assunmption of a trans- mission of thought without verbal or other physical signs. Kleine Schriften. Von HERMANN LOTZE. Bd. i. Leipzig: S. Hirzel, 1885. Pp. xviii., 397. Dr. D. Peipers here begins a collective reprint of Lotze's minor writings -to exclude only the ),eqfs of 1840 and a Latin translation of the Antigone in 1857-as they have been made out and catalogued, with perfect care and devotion, by Prof. E. Rehnisch in the appendix to the Grundziige derzEsthetik (see MIND, Vol. ix. 471). The collection will fill three volumes, the third containing at the end a small amount of pre-</page><page sequence="21">140 NEW BOOKS. viously unpriuted matter. The present volume gives 17 pieces down to 1846,-in chronological order, for the sake of the light thereby thrown on the writer's mental development. Beginning with Lotze's Latin disserta- tion for his medical degree in 1838, it contains, besides one or two medical reviews, the famous article on "Life and Vital Force" in Wagner's landw. der Physiologie, by which he first made his mark, followed bv another article on "Instinct"; the two here occupying pp. 139-220, 221-50, res- pectively. The other pieces (except the mathematical dissertation of 1840, " De summis continuorum ") are of general philosophical interest. Most of them are reviews of books (about Kant, Descartes, &amp;c.), but three have a more independent character: (iv.) "Remarks on the Notion of Space," in a letter to Ch. H. Weisse (1841), pp. 86-108 ; (v.) " Herbart's Ontology" (1843), pp. 109-38; (xi.) "On the Notion of Beauty" (1845), pp. 291-341. The editing has been performied with the most scrupulous conscientiousness. System der Christlichen Sittenlehre. Von D. J. A. DORNER. Herausgegeben von D. A. DORNER. Berlin: W. Herz, 1885. Pp. xi., 560. This posthumous work of the distinguished theologian Dorner contains his ethical doctrine. His aim is to find a point of view from which the unity of Christian and philosophical ethics niay be seen, at least as a limit to which both equally tend. "The way to this union is long and the reaching of this end nothing less than the whole history of the world," and we are as yet only in the middle of the process; although, even now, a philosophical ethics may becoine Christian without ceasing, to be rational, and a theological ethics need not give up the claim to a severely scientific character. There must therefore be no forcing of union on the two systems fromii outside. It is not only unavoidable but desirable that attempts should still be made to construct a philosophical doctrine of morality inde- pendently of all reference to Christiaii morality. Yet in the final union, that is to be sought and will at length be attained, between natural and Christian morality, the theological element will not have disappeared from Christianity. This element, indeed, is an essential pait of Christian ethics. For of the three stages of imoral progress, the stages of "law" or "duty," of "virtuie" or law which has embodied itself in habit, and of morality as "highest good" or as the "absolute good" which is identical with God, the last stage, which is the stage of "love" or of "the Gospel," sums up in itself the other two,-the first as well as the second,-for in it the essentially Christian idea of love is united with the philosophical idea of mnoral law. Now this process is inconceivable apart from the historical and theological element in Christianiity; for love cannot be felt towards a law, but only towards a person. The idea of the God-man as the highest manifestation of moral good in the world is thus a necessary idea in ethics. Morality is the only thing in the world that is absolutely good; but there are also goods that are not etlhical. In the ideal Christian organisation of the world, or "Kingdom of God," which is the end of the whole movement of things, those goods, such as knowledge, which are not of absolute value would have a place assigned to theni, not indeed on a level with morality, but distinct from it. In the ideal Christian state the pursuit of knowledge, for example, and the investigation of all truth on purely natural grounds, would be left perfectly free. Allgemeine Ethik. Von Dr. H. STEINTHAL, a. o. Prof. fur allgemeine Sprachwissenschaft, &amp;c. Berlin: G. Reimer, 1885. Pp. xx., 458. This treatise, upon a subject to which the author, mlore than ten years ago, felt himself irresistibly drawn (but without abandoning the psycholo- gico-linguistic studies that have brought him his fame), has been looked for</page><page sequence="22">NEW BOOKS. 141 with interest for some time back. It falls, after an Introduction (pp. 1-92), into four parts: (1) The doctrine of Ethical Ideas, (2) Exposition of the Ideas, or the Forms, of Moral Life, (3) The Psychological Mechanisin of Ethical Action, (4) The Ethical View of the World. Critical Notice will follow. Allgemeine Ethik. Mit Bezugnahme auf die realen Lebensverhailtnisse pragmatisch bearbeitet von JOSEPH W. NAHLOWsKY. 2te verbesserte u. vermehrte Auflage. Leipzig: Veit, 1885. Pp. xxiv., 366. This book, by the author of the better-known Gefiihlsleben (see MIND, Vol. x. 152), appeared originally in 1870. The present edition will receive notice at length later on. Meanwhile, we observe with regret, from a supplementary note by the publisher, that the author died at Graz last January, before the edition saw the light (though he had already written the new preface for it). Nalhlowsky was in his 73rd year, and appears to have been long a sufferer; having retired in 1878, through ill-health, from' the professorship at Graz which he had held since 1862. A native of Prague, he bad originally been in training for the priesthood, but turned to philosophy, and occupied a succession of posts in different Austrian universities from about the year 1845.
