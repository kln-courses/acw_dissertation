<plain_text><page sequence="1">ALEPH APOLOGETICUM THERE ARE FIVE REFERENCES IN JEREMIAH to the worship of "the queen of heaven" (7: i8; 44: I7, i8, I9, 25), and in each case a number of Hebrew MSS have fIX??; ("host") for n*Dt ("queen"). 1 Moreover, even in those MSS which have 1nDt the word is vocalized as if it were equivalent to lDXlt. And it is commonly agreed that both the vocalization and the insertion of the aleph have an apologetic purpose, viz. the removal of any suggestion that the people of Judah had en- gaged in the worship of "the queen of heaven".2 In this note I wish to draw attention to another possible example of the apologetic use of aleph, involving the same roots as in the Jere- miah passages. According to 2 Sam. II:I it was in the spring and 'WllX?;1 InR nS1? that David dispatched an Israelite force under Joab to make war on the Ammonites. For DXR?13;7 the Qere, a num- ber of Hebrew MSS, the major versions, and the parallel account in i Chr. 20: I have Z1t*W1. Treatment of the more difficult form in the Kethibh has usually proceeded along one of two lines: either to explain it as an orthographical variant for Q'7?D7;, or to accept it as original and relate the whole phrase to the preceding narrative. 1 In Jer. 7: I8 the LXX has TT atrparct, which at first sight seems to support the variant. Rudolph notes, however, the suggestion by A. P. Hastupis (To cpLXoXoyLxov IIp6pXycJa zo5 BLXLtou Toi 'Ipe[pLou [KscpC&amp;XoLoc 1-25:14], diss. Athens, 1952, p. I37) to the effect that aTpcrLoc should be read oTpcrteL and derived from the adjective rTp&amp;TeLoq, which is used in the feminine to denote Aphrodite (= Ishtar); the LXX would, according to this explanation, support the consonantal reading of MT. I have not been able to consult Hastupis' thesis; see W. Rudolph, Jeremia (HBAT XII; 3rd ed. (Tiibingen, 1968) ), p. 52 n. The Targum and the Peshitta support the variant, while the Vulgate and the minor versions (Greek) represent the con- sonantal reading of MT. In all four instances in Jer. 44 the LXX and Vulgate support "queen", and the Targum "host" (literally "stars"); the Peshitta supports "host" (literally "work") in vv. 17, i8, and 25, but "queen" in v. 19. 2 A not dissimilar tendency is discernible in the pre-LXX glosses in parts of the OT where it was considered necessary to mitigate the harshness of some anthropomorphic expressions. See J. Weingreen, "Rabbinic-Type Glosses in the Old Testament", JSS, II (I957), 149-62, especially I60-62.</page><page sequence="2">ALEPH APOLOGETICUM-GORDON S. R. Driver 3 adopted the first of these alternatives and cited various parallels, including fnlN? n (2 Sam. io:I7) for 1n"n in the previous verse, and VR'K (for t'1, "poor") in 2 Sam. I2:I. The example of t'1t/SX' shows at the least that orthographical variants could occur even when they might be homomorphous with words in common usage (in this case BH ttRK, "head"). In theory, therefore, the existence of a secondary form IJlgK?} meaning "kings," homomorphous with 1J'7t7Z ("messengers"), is unexceptionable.4 It is a fact, nevertheless, that almost all Driver's examples are monosyllabics, and that some of these, as well as others listed by Gesenius,5 are from medial waw roots.6 This would also be the only instance of an orthographical variant for BH '?111 ("king") in well over 2,000 occurrences of the word.7 3 S.

Note that the expression Xnrlt RXnS7, instead of the usual Nrf1V?S Xs, occurs in the margin of the Neofiti Targum text of Exod. 4:I3; this is probably no more than a scribal error, perhaps induced by the context in which it appears.

P. Smith.13 Arguing that BH HT' cannot legitimately be translated "go out to war,"14 he adopted a suggestion by Graetz 15 and paraphrased "at the season of the year when the messengers of David first went forth." But it could be countered that the use of 2t'inJudg. 4:I4; I Sam. 8:20; Ps. o08:12, etc., would naturally lead to the elliptical expression which we have in 2 Sam. : I. Judg. 2:15 ("whenever they marched out (INS" )") offers perhaps the closest parallel of all. A further weakness of Smith's case is its dependence on the translation of nlIWfl as "season" rather than "spring": "The time seems to be fixed at a year after the embassy to Hanun. The return of the season was a fitting time to refresh the king's memory of the insult." However, no hint of an anniversary of the insult of David's servants by Hanun (2 Sam. I: I-5) is conveyed by the use of nllIV (see below). Then there is the added consideration that the account of the Israelite embassage in the preceding chapter consis- tently speaks of t:QI2, not 1K't7t.

I-I n 1 ("at evening when women go out to draw water"), suggests that the sig- nificance of KSR in such an expression is determined by the subject: n1lt1 go out to draw water, 1"Z1' to make war. (Note the double time-designative in both Gen. 24:II and 2 Sam. II :.) From the few instances in Biblical Hebrew of 1l7 followed by the infinitive con- struct it may be concluded that the punctiliar force which Smith attaches to InS is uncharacteristic of the idiom. In Gen. 24:1I- the most direct parallel- n1M denotes habitude; in Josh. 10:27 and 2 Chr. i8:34 the phrase tZt,;1 l11 n1V refers to particular occasions, but the underlying idea of habitude is not far away.16 Smith adduces another reason for not translating iPKDttX by "kings": "The interpretation seems especially unfortunate, in that the example of David shows that kings did not regularly go out to war, but sometimes sent their armies. We might suppose indeed that there is a covert condemnation of David for not doing as kings (on this theory) usually do. But this seems far fetched." In point of fact David's case only shows that David did not always lead his army in battle; his behaviour could not be held to invalidate the general ob- servation that kings customarily went out to battle in the spring, an observation supported by other Biblical references, to go no further, to which Smith unfortunately makes no appeal.17 It is impossible to say whether any censure of David is implied in the form of words used in MT. What may be significant is that the possibility of an implied rebuke suggested itself to Smith, and inde- pendently to the present writer. We may surmise that an ancient editor or copyist was similarly aware of the contrast between David's behaviour on this occasion and the more heroic display which might have been expected of him. What happened in Jerusalem while the army was in the field (2 Sam. II:2ff.) will have made the contrast seem all the more pointed. As in Jer. chaps. 7 and 44 the device of aleph apologeticum may have been employed in order to avoid casting 16 MT P'7 Kf1s nY in Ps. 32:6 is difficult and liable to emendation. As it stands, nevertheless, it does not conflict with the point being made here. 17 That spring was commonly the time for such expeditions is evident from I Kings 20:22, 26 and 2 Chr. 36:I0, where the same expression as in 2 Sam. i I: is used. Cf. also the Syrian expedition against Joash "at the turn of the year" (f;lWt1l nl1jn), according to 2 Chr. 24:23.
