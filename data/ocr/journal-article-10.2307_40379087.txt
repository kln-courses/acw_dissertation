<plain_text><page sequence="1">COSMOS AND NUMBER IN AESCHYLUS' SEPTEM1 The knots of images in Aeschylus' Septem with their exuberant and powerful vocabulary give the play the aura that prompted Gorgias and Aristophanes to pro- claim it "full of Ares".2 The ferocity of the ancient siege is brought to life in the destruction of the city the chorus imagines and in the duels at the seven gates that achieve epic proportions through the dueling speeches of Eteocles and his scout3. The play's transparent dependence on language for its emotive effect readily invites close examination4. Aeschylus' Septem abounds with contemporary cosmological and mathematical ideas and images. The poet uses them consistently throughout the play, I suggest, to make of Thebes a seven-sided, shield-shaped cosmos, ruled over by the seven-month lord of sevens (heptamagetes), Apollo, and the completion of whose circumference seals the unified fate of Polynices and Eteocles. 1. Seven Seven has applications, millennia old, in areas as broad as mathematics, music, astronomy, religion, and medicine that other numbers do not. In the early Greek literature seven seems connected with uniqueness, strength or a fairly large number or length of time5. In the Iliad the most famous seven is Ajax's shield with its seven layers of oxhide (eicxaPoeioq) covered by a layer of bronze. It was an impressive piece of armor; Homer pauses to describe its creation (7.219-23)6. Of obvious curiosity here are Nestor's seven commanders. By the beginning of Iliad 9 the 1 With gratitude to the School of Historical Studies of the Institute for Advanced Study for a fellowship to begin the study, to S. V. Tracy, H. Avery, S.

In response Nestor sends out sentries: "seven captains each with one hundred soldiers" (9.85ff). Why seven? I think it is a bit like Ajax's shield, but maybe something more magical. Seven here is much, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Seven's uniqueness garners it special status7. Philolaus (from Pythagoras?) commented that seven was djufixcop because it was like Athena and 6 fyyejucov xc5v crujurcavxcov; thus it remains "unmoving, neither producing nor be- ing created... seven could rightly be called eiiccov, the archetype" (Diels/Kranz 44 B 20 17-19). It is no surprise then that in a play that has to do with the attack of seven leaders against a city of seven gates that the number seven might play a meaningful role. The cosmic phenomena, their number fixed at seven, are linked to time and hence cyclical permanence8. This permanence is in turn linked to religion with its corresponding eternal persons and is pervasive in areas fringing the Mediterranean. There is little question that by the eighth century seven planets were considered the norm in Greece. We find, for example, the planets as e7iTCX7copa xeipea ("seven- pathed orbits" in the Homeric Hymn to Ares, 8.7; see below p. 143); 87rcd7ropo&lt;; refers to motion of these planetary bodies or stars in their fixed orbits; Euripides characterizes the Pleiades thus (/A. 7, Or. 1005, and Rhes. 529).9 The planetary orbits occur within or make up the giant disk of the heavens (see below on the halos and a shield-shaped cosmos, 139-145)10. Of further interest for the play is the early Pythagorean notion, perhaps from Pythagoras himself, of counter planets, even a counter earth, that orbit in antithetical spaces on the other side of the fire, or the sun; that is, seven bodies moving opposite their equals. In the last few years a version of this notion has resurfaced among astrophysicists. This physical ar- rangement, which we should bear in mind as we read the disposition of the seven defenders against the seven attackers, in turn corresponded to the binary nature of all existence, that is, a tension of seven pairs of opposites, but the same (twins), across a geometric shape of seven. Aeschylus' Thebes has an order about it that is not unrelated to this view of the cosmos. The connections between music and the cosmos or astronomy con- tribute to our view of the city. The proportions in music that produce harmony and pleasure of course existed long before Pythagoras took them up, but, as with most of these phenomena, he is the earliest to whom Greek history accords the act 7 Seven couches is the norm for the andron; see Dunbabin 1991. enx&amp;KXivoq even becomes a measure of area (Philo, Belopoeica 80.48). 8 Cornford, 142-48 discusses number as shape in connection with celestial harmony; the tetractys is called kosmos, ouranos or even pan. 9 It is used of the seven-zoned planetary system from Aratus on (Phaenomena 257). 10 It might be seven orbits, but it occurs in a line about triangles and the scalene (Diodorus 10.6, OxP 1011). Interesting is Callimachus' icuKtax; e.nia\ir\Kr\q in a passage about Pythagoras: is it not a heptagon?</page><page sequence="3">Cosmos and Number in Aeschylus' Septem 131 of giving them nomenclature that could then be talked about. A fourth, fifth, or octave became objects of discussion because they exhibited to his (or someone's) mind the same ratios as the planetary alignments. "Harmony of the spheres" is not a poetic fiction. As West sees it: "The realization that numbers underlie the basic concords of fourth, fifth, and octave must have been, if not the source, at any rate a powerful reinforcement of this exaltation of number. These musical phenomena provided concepts and formulae that could be extended beyond music to general cosmology"11. The direction of the realization could just as easily have been the reverse. For example, an original Pythagorean heptachord may be connected with the canonical seven strings because the beauty of the resulting sound matched the perception of how regularly the seven planets moved and were fitted to each other and the entire pattern (cosmos). The word for such a fit, regardless of the priority, derived from carpentry and other crafts that involve fitting pieces together, tightly is harmonia12. It would take an euergetes, perhaps Pythagoras, who could express how the observations made in these realms of human perception and aesthetics were related to one another. In the divine world that euergetes of wisdom and music and seven is Apollo. The seven of music and the cosmos draws Thebes and Apollo together in ways that precede mythologically the rise to prominence of the Labdacus/Laius line with its own close ties to Apollo. Roscher lists the many, many associations of Apollo with seven13. The god who is celebrated for a seven-month birth and on the seventh day of the month (Hesiod, Works and Days 770) by Pythagoreans (Johannes Lydus, de diebus 2.11, citing "Orpheus") is associated with the sun, the astronomical year with its seven planets, with wisdom (at Delphi and with the Seven Sages) and pre- sides over his domain with a seven-stringed lyre. Apollo's lyre, whose etiology is recounted in the Hymn to Hermes14 and the founding of Thebes are connected by Pausanias (9.5.6-8). He quotes Homer, who says that Amphion and Zethus: . . . Ttporcoi 0f|pTi&lt;; e5o&lt;; eKtiaav tnxanvXoxo, 7r6pyG)adv t\ snei ov uev aTcupycaxov y' eSvvavxo vaieuev evp-uxopov 0f|pr|v, Kpaxep© icep eovxe. first founded seven-gated Thebe and built towers, since they could not have [otherwise] inhabited broad-plained (e\)pt)%opov) Thebe without defensive towers, although they were powerful. Od. 11.263-65 He comments that Homer has neglected to mention Amphion 's music and how he built the walls to the sound of his lyre (the special gift from Hermes to Apollo). 11 West, 1992,233-34. 12 Philip, 122, notes the non-musical character of harmonia, and cites Aristotle (Metaphys. 985b23-986al3), who also seems to suggest that the cosmological observations came second. 13 Barker, 15; Roscher, 361, 363. 14 Barker, 15. Seven strings are the most common from the Bronze Age on (see the Hagia Triada larnax, Heraklion Archaeological Museum).</page><page sequence="4">132 June W. Allison The music at the building of Thebes goes beyond inspirational background melody: Amphion had modified the lyre by adding three strings to the original four. Pausa- nias records the belief that the Neistan Gates got their name from vf|tr|, the name of one of the strings of the lyre, which Amphion "invented at this gate" (9.8.4) 15. So: a seven-sided city - to wit, a heptagon - built to the music of a seven-stringed lyre made expressly for the occasion, the instrument of Apollo, who developed an especially close relationship with the royal house of Thebes16. For Aeschylus it is Apollo as Commander of Sevens (heptamagetas) (see below, 138-139) who becomes the savior of the city17. The uniqueness of seven extends to shape. The heptagon was not a common figure in mathematical texts for the simple reason that it could not be constructed through the normal rules of plane geometry18. But a heptagon may have had an early place in cosmological thought if a seven-domed vault lies behind the title and subject of a cosmology by Pherecydes of Syros (fl. 550)19. The number seven is always closely tied to the physical plan of the city as Em&amp;nv'koc,. Aeschylus adds the epithet: e7n;aT£i%f|&lt;; (ercxaxEixeiq e!;o8ot&gt;&lt;; 284). Italie recognized the peculiarity and felt the need to explain it as a synonym: septem portas moenium Thebarum. eTtTaxeixnq is not in fact just a poetic variation of knxdnvikoq. Aeschylus must have had a good reason for its creation. Perhaps, just as the word suggests, he is indicating the segments of wall, not the entrances per se9 'seven-walled' or 'seven-faceted'. The emphasis has shifted from gates to walls20. Walled citadels are not, of course, exactly round in antiquity, even if the ancients themselves refer to the circuit of a city as a kyklos, which Heath takes to be a reference to the Zo- 15 Linguistically it is sound: vr\ioxo&lt;; = vf|axo&lt;; (veaxcx; = vfjxo&lt;;).There is a problem with the text as to whether it is the last [invented?] or the highest on the lyre. 16 Not just in myth; Ismenios was a son of Apollo; the temple to Apollo Ismenios sat on a hill facing the Cadmeia; see Schachter, 77-88; Herodotus, 1.52 and Pindar, P. 11.4-5. On Thebes' associations with the house of Oedious. see Zeitlin. 130-31. 17 When Sophocles came to write Oedipus the King Apollo remained central: divine knowledge guarantees that what happens has always happened. In fact the core of the myth (Oedipus 's killing his father and marrying his mother) has already occurred before the play opens. 18 See, for example, Bankoff and Garfunkel, 7-19; Heath (1931), 340-42 and Johnson, 17-21. It is not discussed per se until the brief mention, eTrcdycovo*; as an adjective, by Nicomachus in the second century A. D. (2.7.3 and 1 1-12.4 and Iamblichus' commentary, Nicomachi arithmetica introductio, 85.17-21). The word denotes an instrument in Aristotle's Politics 1341a41. 19 The title may have been Heptamychos (or Theokrasia or Theogonia or even Pentemychos [7A2andp.46n.12]). 20 There is no point in hypothesizing what Aeschylus knew of Thebes. Tucker, xli, absurdly comments, "It would be absurd to consider the poet as having any very clear-cut outline in his mind. He had studied no charts of Thebes." It is unimaginable to think that if the gates existed in the nearby city Aeschylus did not know this or that if they did not why everyone in the Greek world thought they did. He has a clear notion of a layout. His audience accepts the seven-gated city as a poetic reality. In fact it is absurd that this footnote exists.</page><page sequence="5">Cosmos and Number in Aeschylus' Septem 133 diac, a circle that embraces the orbits of the planets; is it a heptagon?21 Aeschylus is thus more specific than most: Thebes is heptateiches; the walls around this city have defined sides. We assume that the seven captains of the attacking force are seven because there were seven gates. However Aeschylus referred to the play, perhaps because of the existing Thebaid and great popularity of drama, the phrase enxa eki 0f|pac; stuck. It is as a formula or a title, however, that Aristotle treats it, whereas Homer talks only of the gates in his foundation account. He does not say how many war- riors there were. At some time the reference shifted from city to attackers, or a tradition of a band of seven warriors existed independently and perhaps earlier, but was adapted to the story of an attack against the seven-gated city (Burkert's seven demons [below 134-135] or something from the same tradition as Nestor's seven commanders). Aeschylus, furthermore, does not tell us why it is these seven who are made responsible for breaching Thebes' famous seven portals. In Aeschylus' version, from the beginning, there are seven and they choose lots for their gates. It is a question that, surprisingly, occurred to Aristotle and is repeated in Proclus. And, it is treated by both as part of a Pythagorean exemplum. Aristotle sums up his understanding of Pythagoras: ©ex' el xiciv 6 amoq dpiSubc; auvepepfiKei, xawd dv tjv aXXr\koiq eiceTva to cruxo elSoc; dpiGuoi) exovta, oiov r\kioq Kai ceA,f|vr| id oruxd. aXka 5id xi a'ixia xama; So, if the same number had belonged to certain things, then those things would have been the same as one another because they would have had the same form of number; for example, the sun and the moon would have been the same. But on account of what are these (numbers) causes? (Metaphysics 1093al0-13) Without giving us his reason he uses the number seven as his example by way of getting at the aition. It may have to do with seven's importance to Pythagoreans or because seven has such a wide-spread number of commonly conceived units: ercxd uev (J)covT|evxa, ercxd 5e %op8ai x\ dpuovia, ercxd 8e ai TtteidSeq, ev ercxd 5e 686vxa&lt;; pdXA^et (evid ye, evia 8' ov), ercxd 8e oi em 0f||3a&lt;;. There are seven vowels, the harmony (i.e. the scale) has seven strings, the Pleiades are seven, losing baby teeth at seven years old (well, some animals do and some don't) and the ones against Thebes were seven (1093al3-15)22. The last in the list strikes the modern reader as extraordinary. The seven who attacked the previously more famous seven gates - and failed to a man, by the way - were seven fixed in people's minds as naturally as the seven vowels or the 21 Heath (1921), 93. 22 The groupings appear early and variously. Hippon of Metapontum is thought to have con- sidered seven the most important number in human life, and so cited seven months as the earliest point for a viable birth, the appearance of adult teeth at seven years old, and at fourteen puberty (38 A 16). In a passage that some associate with Heraclitus, Hippocrates lists seven schemata of human perception (22 C 1.23).</page><page sequence="6">1 34 June W. Allison seven stars of the Pleiad, or, as it were, the title of a familiar tale23. But that is not the end of it. We recall that what Aristotle is trying to disprove is a Pythagorean notion that if x is one and y is one then x and y are the same by virtue of their being one24. So the puzzle he thinks he solves is the very bit of commonsense we would expect: ap' ovv on xoioa8i 6 dpi9uo&lt;; netyvKev, 5ia xoOxo f| ekeTvoi eyevovxo enxa f\ f) TtXeidq enxa daxepoav eaxiv; f\ oi uev 8id xd&lt;; nvXaq f\ aXto\v xivd aixiav, rr\v 5e fpeiq omox; api9uo\)|j.£v; So then is it because the number is naturally of such a kind that those men were seven or the Pleiades is [composed] of seven stars; were those men seven because of the gates or for some other reason, and the Pleiades seven because we count them thus? (1093al6-19) The point is evident: there are seven warriors; they are seven. The Pythagorean point is more elusive25. Aristotle is focusing on the counting, not the relationship of number to objects. So, he asks, is it because we count seven gates that there are seven men? If so, then Pythagoras would go on to say, the gates are [also] seven; they are both seven and so, the same. The sticky bit is not simply a failure of Py- thagoreans to make a correct evaluation of a category statement of the common sort; for example, if I say, "this shirt is red," I am not committed to the notion that the shirt is in fact the color red itself. Normal users of the language solve the ambigu- ity instantaneously because of a common sensitivity to the several aspects of 'is'. For now we only need to observe that Aristotle dismisses the identification of the men with the gates as a mistake. We are assured that the men are seven because the gates are seven and according to Aristotle they cannot be the same simply because they each 'consist of [the number] seven.' But would the ease with which Aristotle gets out of the tautology satisfy an early fifth-century thinker who was not unaware of Pythagorean and Parmenidean arguments about one? We need to add that Aristotle himself says there may be "some other reason for there being seven [men]." Burkert, resurrecting a theory set out in 1939 by Ernst Howald, which held that the Seven were originally demons, "an outbreak from Hell," demonstrates that just such a group appears in an Akkadian epic about Erra, the god of plagues. He recounts their history which was known from many other texts that also, interestingly, involved the settling of civil slaughter by brothers, often twins, who killed each other.26 For these influences to have acquired a full- blown Greek mythology they properly belong to a period of synthesis that scholars of the history of religion and archaeologists date back to the Bronze Age; and, if 23 No doubt, if asked what went in the phrase " against Thebes," most of us even today would reply, "Seven," as casually as we would finish, "Snow White and..." 24 See also Met.5.14.1020b4 on mimema, a physical representation of number.

'Enm eki 0f|pa&lt;;.27 1 point this out, not because it alters how Aeschylus treated the story or the point Aristotle thought he was making, but because Burkert once more intrigues us with the Eastern connection as he does with astronomical connections. He concludes: "Whoever resists the idea that the Seven against Thebes have to some extent a Mesopotamian pedigree should nevertheless not overlook that a similar provenience must be accepted for the seven-headed Hydra as well as for the Seven Sages"28. Thus the transition from Seven-Gated Thebes to the Seven Men against Thebes may have an Eastern genesis. As we have seen, the power of seven is everywhere. From a Pythagorean vantage, the attack of seven against a city, coming like a plague, insinuating itself into the myth sur- rounding Oedipus, king of a seven-gated city, yielded an identity of the gates with the men that Aeschylus the presocratic dramatist used to advantage. 2. The Seven-sided City From line 78 of Septem the Chorus begins to create the scene of destruction, which, because it is imaginary, also functions as a siege of any city. From the center of the theater they generate with powerful words a strong visual representation of the enemy bursting through the gates. It serves to project a conclusion that will actu- ally be thwarted by Thebes' defenders. Like Eteocles and the scout in the shield scene, who undoubtedly moved in the orchestra indicating the gates (see below 137-138), the chorus could do likewise during this ode. However we imagine their movements, by line 124 the picture is complete in their minds: enxa 8' dtYfivopeq Trpejiovxec; GXpa-rov 8opi)acol&lt;; aayai&lt;; nvXaiQ efi86naic TcpoaioTavxai naXan XayovxeQ. Seven warriors conspicuous from out of the army with their panoplies complete with spears take a stand [up] to the seventh gate as they chose by lot. (124-26) Tucker conveys the difficulty from nvXaiq epSoumq right into the English by translating: "And seven champions... take a stand, each at a seventh gate, as his lot fell." He adds, "This makes little sense in English, however." I am fond of the idea that all of them are actually "standing at the seventh gate," where they draw 27 Burkert (1972), 114 n.28 likes J.

Allison lots, and it has the value of projecting the anxiety in the process29. Moreover, as a mathematical notion of the gates conceived of as a whole this might be just the way a Pythagorean would have expressed it. The dramatic point at present, that we cannot help but notice, is that the chorus here has completed the drawing and has dispensed the warriors already before the scout has even informed Eteocles or us. The women have simply repeated what the scout had earlier said, accepted the words as accomplished deeds, and united the gates with the unseen warriors. At line 42 the scout had mentioned there were: dv8p£C yap enid, 9oi3pioi Xoxayexai. and further, at 55-56: KA,r|po'U|Lievo'u&lt;; 8' eXeiTtov, ©&lt;; Tcti^eoi kotyriw £KacTO&lt;; a\)x©v Ttpoq nvXac, ayoi koyov. Then, the scout, some 250 lines later, contradicting the chorus's intervening tale of doom, reminds Eteocles and the audience of where the situation actually sits. He insists on his accuracy: Xeyoi[i av ei8(b&lt;; ex&gt; id xoav evavxiov ©&lt;; x ev kvXoliq eKaaioc eUnyev naXov. (375-76) These four passages look to each other verbally; they convey a feeling of preci- sion about the systematic way in which the lots were chosen while preserving the unknown elements generally of lot and chance. The Gates do not have a clear or- der of primacy in the play. Aeschylus does not provide an exact procedure for the drawing of the lots; only the selection of lots is counted by the Scout30. He gives no reason for the order in which the Argive warriors select them, except perhaps to the extent that Polynices clearly has to be last. The aggressive Tydeus is eager to get the first lot: "already Tydeus thunders at the Proitides Gates" (377). Eteocles has no control over the order of the gates; he fashions his logos to match that of the scout to assign the right warrior against the right opponent. Thalmann 29 Smyth leaves out "seventh" from his translation; A. Hecht and H. Bacon bypass it: "seven gates;" this fits with Hutchinson's observation (ad loc.) that it simply "must mean 'seven';" he cites // 8.404 for use of an ordinal as a cardinal. Or put the phrase solely with the verb, as Grene: "... stand champions at seven gates." 30 The phrase nvXaic, ep86|iai&lt;; at 125 and 361 and the plurals at 376 and 451 (key &amp;XXov dA.A,ai&lt;; ev nvXaic, eitarx010) may suggest where each stood to draw a lot, but it may mean how each chose a lot "among the gates;" that is, the lots in the helmet were marked with the names of the gates. Did the men put their own marked lots in the helmet and the gates had been numbered, even casually, not written, before hand? If, however, the lots had the names of the gates on them, how did they determine who drew first? Or was that just random, Tydeus pushing forward, and so Polynices just holding back till last since he was the leader of the assault, where he is matched with Eteocles, just as Apollo was going to have it? Tucker at line 445 mentions the third possibility that there were two helmets, shaken at the same time. Hecht and Bacon 1974 translate the ambiguity: "Of what lot and what gate each champion drew."</page><page sequence="9">Cosmos and Number in Aeschylus' Septem 1 37 reminds us that all perception depends on this scout31. On the most commonly accepted plan of the city, however, one can see a pattern of deliberate-looking randomness that seems gradually to sharpen the audience's premonition about the seventh gate and to instill in them an anxiety because they cannot warn the king who cares only about saving the city, who seems oblivious to even the possibility of his brother's presence. This is high drama indeed. In the following schema those in bold print indicate the three major known gates, identified primarily by seeming priority and geography; the others are dis- posed according to the text of Septem with reconstructions of Pausanias, Fabricius, Symeonoglou, and, most recently, Berman32. The numbers after the names are the order of the draw. As the Scout proceeds from the first assignment to the second and so on, Eteocles, in response, systematically, surely dramatically on stage, passes one, then two gates or sides, thus counting odd and even consistently till he reaches seven and the seventh gate. Thus, Eteocles responds to Tydeus' draw (1) by sending a defender to the Proetides Gates (A). He then skips B (Homoloides) to go to C (Electrae) and Capaneus' (2) lot. Eteoclus (3) has drawn the Neistae Gates (F), so Eteocles must skip two gates (D and E) to get to these; then he must pass by E (Ebdomai) by the shortest route, once more going back to D (Ogygiae) and Hippomedon's selection (4). Parthenopaeus (5) then picks G (Boreae) and Eteocles skips E yet again and F in order to man this gate. Then he skips over A to get to B (Homoloides) and Amphiaraus' selection (6). Finally, again skipping two gates, C and D, Eteocles faces the Ebdomai Gates at E and Polynices. It is the only gate he has passed three times33. On the stage this particular repeated action could certainly raise the suspense for the audience who would conceivably take note of the positioning34. The order, seemingly unpredictable, also keeps Eteocles 31 Thalmann, 87. 32 That an author did not know the name for every gate, made a mistake, or had artistic reasons for his choice may explain the differences, but the gates might also have had more than one name. Ogygiae are not mentioned by name, merely, "those near Onca Athena," Tucker, xl-xli, suggests, for metrical reasons. Perhaps Boreae (Crenaeae) and Hypsistae were not originally formal names, just the northern gates and loftiest gates, as locals might have referred to them; but there is a Zeus Boreas and Zeus Hypsistos of the temple located nearby. If Proitides comes from Proitos, as Eustathius claims (631.56), a son of Thersander, whose name means something like 'coming forward first,' is Aeschylus playing with the name by having Tydeus so very eager to advance to the gates? 33 'Skipping' one then two angles is normal in the construction of heptagons: 34 Wiles 1993: 18-94, positions the statues of the gods mentioned by the Chorus around the theater and suggests they were intended to stand in front of the gateways, thus enforcing the identity of theater and city. See Taplin, 150-5 1 and the sense that if all Eteocles' men are on stage initially, his gradual isolation would be palpable.</page><page sequence="10">138 June W.Allison G.

There is, therefore, an underlying symmetry that binds the city that even a modern reader, without seeing a performance, might notice with a sense of pleasure. In this light Aeschylus' unique variation on the common heptapyloi, namely, heptateiches, shows him focusing on the sides. As the Scout and Eteocles deal with the lots, the audience, already, because of the chorus's dy- namic representation, accepting theater as city, visualizes the walls closing in the city, circumscribing its inhabitants in a shape of seven, keeping them safe within and the enemy without. In the end the gates and the men are one because they are both seven.

Circles, shields and the cosmos Certainly it does not at first seem significant that the shields of the warriors are round; they were commonly round from the Archaic period on and the use of semata on such shields and the power behind the symbol to its bearer were commonplaces37. At times the shields have more detail and individuality than the warriors carrying them, something true of Aeschylus' figures as well38. The shape and the semata work like metaphors to give life to the bearers. The scout's descriptions, based on his perceptions, whose accuracy he has emphatically affirmed, become the reliable logos that Eteocles, who has no visual perceptions, then uses. It is as if the poet were examining the means by which perceptions - words and pictures - become words that acquire meaning and so efficacy. The descriptions then become the ac- tion, the battle for the city. Aeschylus' language in these descriptions, which shows affinities with some of the presocratic discussion of cosmic bodies or concepts, enhances the notion of Thebes as cosmos embracing a system of celestial bodies39. I discuss some prominent examples. seventh pair of combatants." See also Tucker, 163. The form -fiyeTnq is very rare, not literary and may be some sort of cultic title. Nestor calls his seven fjyeuoveq (//. 9.85), but we think of him here. 36 It is rather intriguing that Apollo presents Polynices with Dike on his shield and Eteocles with perhaps an Erinys on his (see Bacon, 27-38), a grouping Aeschylus uses again in Eumenides. 37 Abstract designs, animals, apotropaic figures such as gorgons, and emblems, such as the tripodia of Syracuse, were common. See Armantrout, 1 45 ff . , for the difficulty of identifying the Seven in art. Jeppesen (not noted by Armantrout), esp. diagram on p. 31, identified the warriors on the famous Niobid vase as the Seven. 38 See the splendid outward-facing gorgon on the shield of an otherwise undistinguished war- rior on the east frieze from the Siphnian Treasury (Delphi Museum). 39 The extreme picture has the individual shields, themselves microcosms, placed in orbit around a shield-shaped cosmos; seven warriors dotting the rim of the cosmos with their shadow opponents facing them.</page><page sequence="12">140 June W. Allison The insolent device of Tydeus' shield is not simply the moon, but an entire ethereal scene: (j&gt;A£yov0' vn daxpoi&lt;; ovpavov, xexvyuivov taxuTrpa 8e navceXr^oq ev jieacoi adicei, jcpeopiaxov aaxpov, vukxo&lt;; 6&lt;|)6aA,|Li6(;, 7ipe7tei. (388-90) To read upon this shield the imagery of some sort of cosmic circle is not difficult. The language is grand: the dark sky is lit up with stars: the heavens themselves, however, are blazing, not just the stars. The use of vno with the dative is hard to translate as "with" or "by," even if this is how we want to conceive the picture, "the heavens blazing with stars"40. It regularly means 'under' and can often mean 'under' in the sense of 'behind'. The heavens are fiery and blazing in these lines; it is more than the effect of the moon. Rather, the scene shares an aesthetic with the path of Empedocles' primeval aither which "binds all of these (the other four elements [roots]) around in a circle," that was gradually "layered" or permeated with fire as it moved (across or through the cosmic shape/sphere?) and which "was combined with it to create the glowing sky;" "then having gathered itself into a mass, the aither produced the sun" (A 49a, B 38, 41 , 5 1 , 54)41 . This fiery aither left a trail of small pieces of itself, stars, gradually ending in the creation of the planets, including the moon, the central planet42. This is the moon that Tydeus wields. 43 Aeschylus has Eteocles respond to Tydeus' lunar eye in the night shield, by predicting that this scene might itself become an omen: el yap 0av6vxi v\)£ en oujiaaiv rceooi, xcoi toi &lt;j&gt;epovxi af\\i imepicouTtov x68e yevotx' dv 6p0(o&lt;; ev8iK(oq x' etccovvuov, kci\)x6&lt;; Kax' a\)xo\) xf|v5' vppiv uavxeuexai. For if night should fall on the eyes of the one who is dying, then to him carrying the shield this symbol may become a truthful boast and a proper fit with the description. He divines (uavxevexai) the hybris back upon himself (403-6). 40 The \)7co cannot be translated with xex-uyuevov ( 'fitted with stars'), since this participle has to refer to the shield's boss not the heavens. 41 Parmenides also has more than one layer of fire in his original cosmic orbits: "The narrower rings [in the cosmic creation (by the daimon?)] are filled with unmixed fire, the next with night, and between runs the allotment of flame. In the center of these is the daimony who governs all" (B 12.1-3). 42 Kingsley 1995a, 48-49, views aither as the prime substance. It is atmosphere, air we breath, air right out to the boundary of the universe, 35. The word presbistos reminds us of the Titan origins of Selene, but also a primal substance. 43 Moon as the eye of heaven, is not novel with this passage, indeed, it seems natural. See Pindar, 01. 3.19 and 6.16; Tucker, ad loc. Hutchinson, ad loc. mentions the late-archaic Etruscan vase with a crescent - not the circular full - moon on the shield of a warrior. A black figure lekythos in the Syracuse Archaeological Museum has a white disk on a shield that is either an eye, badly preserved, or a moon.</page><page sequence="13">Cosmos and Number in Aeschylus' Septem 141 In Eteocles' interpretation the solitary gleaming (living) eye of the moon, the center- piece of the sema, actually disappears and is asymmetrically replaced by the two eyes of the dying; the metaphor is contaminated by the material outside of it. (Note that it is Tydeus by virtue of his sema who interprets unwittingly [juavxeiiexai] his shield emblem just by possessing it; the verb jLiavxe-ueaGai is given an almost metalinguistic job)44. Eteocles simply extracts the moon from the description of the night and stars and transfers the eye from the lunar metaphor to the dying human in order to recreate the logos. He translates the cosmic symbolism of the shield into a common metaphor for dying45. This is not the usual language of Aeschylus' images nor is it personification; it is pure abstraction. Interesting here are two passages from the Presocratics where the 'eye' image strikes the anthropomorphic metaphor. Empedocles describes night without the moon's reflected light as blind air (v\)Ki;6&lt;; epTHLiairiq dA,aa&gt;7ci5o&lt;;) (B49)46. Parmenides gives the moon a single eye: epya xe KVKXamcx; nevGK\i 7cepi(|)oiTa aeA,f|vr|&lt;;, B 10.447. The cosmic moment when the moon, like a mythic one-eyed being, "our brightest star," is full and, as Empedocles claims, the brightness of aither is still visible "under the stars" (i. e. behind and moving down the hemisphere), lends a primeval power to the semata of the shield, a true representation of the arrogance (\mepc|&gt;pov Gf\\ia) of Tydeus' shield. Evidently, the word cnijua here carries the full ambiguity: it is both the celestial and the artisan's 'sign'. At 487 the scout had introduced Hippomedon: xexapto(; aXkoq, yei-covac; nvXaq e%o)v "OyKac; 'AOdvaq, £\)v podi rcapiGTcnm, 'l7t7toue5ovTO&lt;; axfjjia Kai u£ya&lt;; xmoq dXo) 8e noXkf\v, acniboq ktjkXov ^eyco, ec|)pi^a 8ivf|cavTO&lt;;, o\)K aXk&amp;q ep©. The next, the fourth, with a battle yell takes his place at his gates the ones that neighbor Onca Athena, Hippomedon, 'wrought on a great pattern' (Tucker), I shuddered - I'll not deny it - as he whirled a mighty threshing floor - 1 mean the circle of his shield. (486-90) We are immediately struck by the transference of the words G%f\\ia and xvnoq from the shield to the man, which serves to combine the man with his shield de- 44 Empedocles uses this colorful verb similarly, without specific religious connotations, as if it meant 'to draw conclusions from perceptions': "A wise man would not divine [imagine] such things" (B 15.1). 45 Hutchinson, ad loc, line 403: "To think of the emblem as representing night was ingenious; to think of night as representing death was natural. A. adapts the familiar Homeric formula...//. 13.580, a/.)." 46 The moon is at times connected with death. She is identified with Persephone (Epich. enni 54), as a gorgon, Orphic verse B22, and commonly with Hecate and Artemis. 47 Perhaps Empedocles called the moon diskoeidos (31A1.60); she is glaukopidos (B42.3).</page><page sequence="14">142 June W. Allison vice. The verb Siveiv does not normally mean 'to wield' as a transitive48, but 'to whirl' or 'spin', like dancers or whirlpools, even, 'wander about in a circle'. With 5ivelv combined with aXaq, a circular threshing floor, the image that arises is that of a dancer - threshing floors made good dancing surfaces49 - but the metaphor is confusing, since Hippomedon "whirled a mighty threshing floor" and does not whirl on it. The explanation Aeschylus thought he had to inject ("I mean the circle of his shield," 490) takes note of this while the comparison to a threshing floor emphasizes the great size of the shield. Why, however, does he think he needed to unpack the metaphor? He is not usually so inclined; his metaphors often run to many levels. The image is clarified and given its familiar Aeschylean ambiguity if aXac, has a second referent, if as a domed, hollowed disk (Kmog. . .Koi^oydoTpoq kuk^ov [with the emphasis of redundancy: "the cavity of the hollow-bellied circle"], 495-96) it is like the cosmos which appears as a disk to men viewing its sphere at the horizon. Hesychius preserves this interpretation50. It is possible to imagine the awful motion of huge cosmic bodies51. Significantly, the noun 5!vo&lt;; very early on is associated with cosmological phenomena, especially as the whirwind (pool?) (8ivr|) of Empedocles. Neikos and Philia sort out the elements whirling about until Neikos reaches the bottom and Philia the middle when all gradually becomes one (B 35.3-4); and the all-potent aither is full of these whirling eddies 48 See later Theocritus 24.10, where the verb is used of a shield. Ferguson (1971), 107-108, 115, reviews its philosophical usage; especially in Empedocles who seems to have "coined the concept of the 8ivr|" 107. 49 The association of threshing floors and - at times ritual - performance is old. At Knossos three circular stone surfaces in a public area were excavated (1984) that appear "indistinguishable from threshing floors" (Lonsdale 116 and esp. 296, n.28 and ThesCRA 301-02). At the wedding on the Shield of Achilles young male dancers spin (e8iveov)(Il. 18. 494) and at 590-601 a dance set, interestingly, at Knossos in honor of Ariadne is described where young men and girls holding each other by the wrists dance and whirl like a potter's wheel. The circular dance is commonly as- sociated with harvest (e. g., Bacchylides 5. 104-1 10; Aristophanes Frogs 444-45). See Ure 225-26, 229, and Lonsdale 1 14-21 on the long-lived tradition. Threshing floor', for example, is a common name of modern dance studios, the title of a painting by August Vischer, and a book on Cretan dance (The Marble Threshing Floor by E. Frye). 50 On &amp;A,G), Hutchinson, following LSJ's Aeschylus loco citato', "the orb or circumference of sun or moon, applied here to a shield (thus Hsch. s.v, S Nic. Th. 166)." So this may well be the source and only referent for the planetary meaning of halos. The importance beyond the utilitarian is dramatically presented in the large dedicatory halos at Delphi. 51 1 have talked of circles, the shape of the shields, and the sphere in Empedoclean cosmol- ogy. Are the planets and earth spheres and the entire cosmos as well? It seems so. Typically for humans viewing this arrangement of spheres along the horizon or on the equator the entire heavens perceptively flattened would look like a domed disk from the inside. For Parmenides, Being is like a sphere (B 8.43-44). In the Pythagorean system multiple spheres all move at predetermined intervals (C3). In the harmony of the spheres the stars, etc. "move along the spheres" (31 B 129, Porphyry on Pythagoras).</page><page sequence="15">Cosmos and Number in Aeschylus' Septem 143 (B 115.11). The most famous whirling is ascribed by Anaxagoras to the nous of him who regulates the cosmos52. The cosmic significance of the imagery corresponds remarkably to the descrip- tion of Ares in the Homeric hymn to him. Here the anthropomorphic divinity is united with his existence as the planet, which is thus not conceived as a celestial body 'named for' the god; rather, a la Pythagoras, they are the same. The poet invokes Ares: . . .Trupouyea kvk^ov eAiaaow ai9epo&lt;; £7txa7c6poi&lt;; evi xeipeaiv, ev0a ae n(tiko\ ^atyteyeeq xpixdxnq imep dvxvyo*; aiev exouai. . . .whirling the fiery bright circle through the seven-coursed signs of the aither, where your blazing horses bear you constantly above the third rim-like orbit. (6-8) First, it is intriguing that here too, however one is to imagine it, the god 'whirls' the shield. The verb tXicceiv usually means to whirl, not wield, and, like Siveiv, does not normally apply to the manner of wielding a shield, but refers to one's rotating or whirling, again, as in a dance. Empedocles uses the notion for several features of his cosmogenic processes, e. g. B 17.25 Philotes, 45 (moon), 46. Secondly, avxu£ is a rim, the outer edge of a circle, especially, the rim of a shield (see Iliad 6. 1 1 8 or 18.479, where the rim of Achilles' shield also embraces the cosmos); so here the orbit of the planet Mars is a rimmed disk. This shield-like orbit (line 8) is identified with the shield the god Mars whirls (line 6). This is the giant view Aeschylus has of the shield of Hippomedon. The similarities with Septem, a play "full of Ares," found in the "Hymn to Ares" are surely arresting. The shield of Amphiaraus unites the wholeness of shape, here circle, that has no protuberances with the completeness of being. It also advertises the fallacies in the semata of his comrades and predicts their universal defeat. xoicrOG' 6 udvxic; damS' evKritax; veuxov Ttdyxa^Kov rruSa. afjua 8' o\)K enf\v ktjk^coi* o\) yap 8oK£iv dpioxoq aXX eivai Getei, paGeiav dA,0Ka Sid ^pevoc; Kapnoviievoq, e£ fi&lt;; xd KeSvd ptaxaxdvei po\)Xet)(j.axa. Such things the seer at ease, holding his all-brazen shield, spoke forth. There was no emblem on the orb; for he does not wish to seem best, but to be, as he reaps the fruit from the deep furrow of his mind, from which the valued counsels swell and grow.

It remains a modern word for shield.</page><page sequence="16">1 44 June W. Allison The simple yap of line 592 could not be more important: Aeschylus intends us to understand that Amphiaraus' desire "to be best not just to seem so" explains the absence of an emblem on the pure bronze orb of the shield. He has dispensed with the boasts and the champing at the bit (the doxai) exhibited by the others. Even though Eteocles successfully creates logoi to match those of the scout in order to translate the semata of the attackers and provide meaning for the semata of his own men, the clear, empty, polished bronze orb of Amphiaraus' shield must have a message for the audience. With no likenesses or appearances, hence no doxa, this shield which broadcasts the absence of sema is paradoxically a powerful sema; it defeats logoi. It represents being, not seeming. This idea is most recognizably Parmenidean and has been discussed by many53. We recognize that the shield scene is a masterpiece. We can sense the experi- ment growing in depth and purpose as Aeschylus takes us step by step through the seven. Aeschylus resolved the difficulty in projecting these notions of seeming and being through the shield of Amphiaraus that must be different from the others by manipulating the paradox even further. The warrior who opposes Amphiaraus becomes insignificant per se. What is interesting is that faced by Amphiaraus on the battlefield whoever the opponent is will see only himself, not a sema bearing the doxa that he could have defeated. What he must see is himself and the self represents his being. But Aeschylus does not explain this, in part because, I be- lieve, paradoxically the all polished orb without doxa/ sema would then itself have become a sema. It is the problem of having to use logoi to explain being if logoi are doxa. So the focus must be on the shield itself, not what it reflects, and on what it means for its bearer. Aeschylus retreats to the mythological and cosmological. Since being and, therefore, truth gleam in the surface of the shield it is conceived of as a sun, not a reflected light, being not doxa. Such a notion also underlies Empedocles' descrip- tion of the cosmic sphere (B27, 28, 29) whose unity with the divine Plato explains in Timaeus54. Empedocles claims the sphere is "set in the thick shade of harmony, enjoying solitary contentment" and it is equal on all sides (B27, 28, 29). Plato ac- cepts the union: "So this entire concept of the ever-living God has been reasoned out; for the god who will be at any time is smooth and even (or equal) everywhere" (33-34al3-b2). Modern astrophysics terms the original ball of energy (?) that - for some reason - exploded as the big bang, a 'singularity'. The shield shares its one- ness and incomprehensible power with Empedocles' sphere/god. Metaphorically it is the shield of the god, in this case Apollo. Amphiaraus, seer of Apollo, 55 is to 53 Capizzi, 319-21, interestingly identifies Parmenidean completeness with the creation of 'city'. This is an interpretive extension of Achilles' shield. 54Solmsen (1965), 109-148, writes a clear narrative of the emergence of Empedocles' sphere. 55 Homer tells us (Od. 15.245-253) that Amphiaraus was dear to Zeus and Apollo and that Polypheides (a cousin), made a prophet by Apollo, was the best seer among men, now that Am- phiaraus was dead.</page><page sequence="17">Cosmos and Number in Aeschylus' Septem 145 die; he predicts Eteocles' death. Eteocles can only respond as he has before, with logoi, unable to face the reality of this shield.56 (It is to be noted, however, that the Sphinx on the shield of the opponent is one of those Apollonian possessors of knowledge who can only be defeated by one who is close to Apollo.) That the scout perceives this attacker as somehow different is made apparent from his hesitancy to draw conclusions. He advises Eteocles to send a defender who is both wise and good, oofyoq i£ K'cryaBoc;, traits very different from those they sought in the other defenders. The scout does not respond to Amphiaraus' prediction of his own death, which should have been a salve of some sort, but utters a gnomic warning: 8eiv6&lt;; bq 0£o\)q ae(3ei (596). Amphiaraus because of his closeness to the gods is capable of "instilling fear"57, even if others do not immediately perceive it. The collection of traits seems an uncanny fit with the presocratic sages, the sophoi te k'agathoi, men like Pythagoras and Empedocles58. The Apollonian mantle hangs about these two as well, whose knowledge is mystic and cosmic at the same time59. 56 In staging this scene, if a director introduced the Seven on stage unseen by Eteocles, much could be done to have Eteocles himself reflected in this shield. 57 See Hutchinson, ad loc; Macleod's translation of Seivoq. 58 Four has some noted significance. See Rosler, 26-27 and n. 6, on the four attributes of Am- phiaraus: ac6(f&gt;pa)v SiKaioc; dyaBoc; evaefi^q (Septem 610). The group, Rosler observes, is similar to attributes of the Pythagorean sage; see his and Ferguson's (1958), 24-47, examination of Plato for the canon of virtues (usually phronesis, sophrosyne, dikaiosyne, and andreia). 59 See Burkert (1972), 116f. on Pythagoras and Apollo. Regarding Empedocles, Solmsen (1980), 219-227, discusses the - albeit - late and thin tradition of a hymn. Fgs.
