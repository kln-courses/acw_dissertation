She is ever at the pulse of the soil and its harvests. The anecdotes she gathers from mischievous Flemings provide wholesome relief from the sick literature of our times. One object of art is to increase the awareness of the audience. Most readers' relatively dormant senses should marvel at the universe of sensations which Marie Gevers reveals as she guides them on a round of the twelve months. She points up the dramatic achievements inherent in nature, detects the reason behind its colors and scents. Felicitously, she feels the alder tree surrender each leaf to the autumn tempest like long-saved coins, or makes the streams sprouting more and more plants for protection from the heat an exciting duel. You savour her anthropomorphic descriptions of water contesting with trees for more moisture, of bushes arguing whether a shade is mauve, pink, magenta or lilac. Attuned to every elemental manifestation, she hears a dead oak-leaf crackle like a castanet, sees a big broom of rain wielded by the wind sweep the countryside, or feels a peaceful shower release the nervous tension that grips the sky at the change of season. Like a thaumaturge, Madame Gevers divulges how to burn the incense of nine summer grasses in order to combat evil presences, and how sorcerers take the guise of the elderbush but only your dog can spot the wicked numen. She eavesdrops with such elfish verve! I could cite her sustained metaphors endlessly. Sunbeams grind grain dripping from plants to flour for rainbows. Wilted aquatic herbs show tracks of the burning steps of the Sun as it slaked its thirst in the pond. And there, clusters of tadpole compose in black notes the farewell song of spring. Plaisir des MCetores is a rare gift to be sipped, a full-bodied chapter at a time, by discriminating lovers of nature and of the lucid mastery of French. HENRI KoPs</page></plain_text>
