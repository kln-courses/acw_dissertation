<plain_text><page sequence="1">METAPHOR AS BASIS OF FORM IN SOYINKA'S DRAMA 'Ropo Sekoni The discussion of form in African literature in general and in Afri- can drama in particular has been for long hydra-headed. It has, for example, featured arguments in favor of genetic connections be- tween, on the one hand, African drama and western dramatic forms and, on the other hand, traditional African dramaturgy and the drama written by Africans in European languages. More specifically, Soyinka scholars have given some attention to the influence of western and African dramatic techniques on the construction of his plays. Some of such considerations have em- phasized the appropriation by Soyinka of elements of such Afri- can traditional art as ritual and other components of folk art in his plays.1 Others have focused equally emphatically on the rela- tion of western formal preferences, especially of Aristotle's view of organicity, to the form of Soyinka's plays.2 One area that has not received rigorous critical investigation is the determination from intrinsic study of Soyinka's drama of the salient characteris- tics of the organization or structure of his plays and the aesthetic import of such features. This article will examine the nature, pro- venance, and aesthetic significance of the formal or structural di- mension of Soyinka's drama. Continuous research on narratological processes3 among the Yoruba since 1975-interviews with storytellers as well as the ex- amination of specific stories-reveals that the Yoruba tend to show some bias for a sophisticated interplay between concealment and disclosure of cognitive elements in their verbal art as well as in such extraverbal modes as ritual. While the characterization of this conception of beauty in art by the Yoruba is still somewhat tenta- tive, its general characteristics are (1) the multiplicity of episodes or images in complex narratives, (2) the division of such multiple episodes into two major groups-continuous and discrete episodes or episodes that of necessity advance the story from conflict to resolution and episodes that do not contribute toward such ad- vancement-(3) the interposition of continuous and discrete epi- sodes in the construction of stories; and (4) the implication of semantic equivalence between continuous and discrete episodes that are essentially different and unrelated at the infrastructural or material level. A common manifestation of these characteristics in Yoruba verbal art is incremental repetition in stories and rituals. Stories Research in African Literatures, Vol. 14, No. 1, February 1983 Â© 1983 by the University of Texas Press 0034-5210/83/010045-13$01.40</page><page sequence="2">46 'Ropo Sekoni and rituals are thus made of the combination of episodes that re- late directly to the linear movement of action from an initial posi- tion of conflict to a terminal situation of resolution and of epi- sodes that bear no direct relation to such a linear progression of events. Incremental repetition is basically of two types: recurrence and reiteration. Recurrence, which is a cruder form of repetition, is characterized by similar incidents happening to the same per- sonage(s). Recurrence occurs, for example, when a character re- peats in toto an action that he has performed earlier in time. Re- iteration, on the other hand, is characterized by similar incidents happening to different personages. When it occurs, it does not necessarily contribute to the logical progression of dramatic con- flicts towards any form of completion or closure. In other words, it does not share a metonymic relation with other episodes in the story. It is often the kind of plot material that Aristotle warns against as a structural defect-capable of detracting from a unified structure that is "characterized by incidents so closely connected that the transposal or withdrawal of any one of them will disjoin and dislocate the whole."4 Incremental repetition, especially re- iteration that is apparently a violation of the Aristotelian view of form, abounds in indigenous Yoruba tales and rituals as well as in some of Soyinka's plays.5 Since the relation between ritual and drama as performative forms is more apparent and more immediate than that between drama and the folktale, I will, in spite of the constraints of space, examine a common Yoruba ritual-"The Obatala Festival"-and some of Soyinka's plays with respect to the importance of meta- phor as a basis of form. The version of the Obatala festival being used for illustration in this study is similar in most respects to the Ede version once con- sidered by Joel Adedeji.6 We will in this study be referring to the Ondo version. This festival, which usually takes place in the afternoon and lasts till dusk, started during our field work (1976) in the early part of the evening in an open space converted for the purpose and called by the priestess the Agbala, or compound, of Obatala Baba- risa (Obatala: the father of the gods). At the beginning of the fes- tival (Ajodun) the priestess led a group of singers and drummers, all clothed in white, out of a house dotted with Efun (white chalk usually used for similar sacred affairs). They were all praising Oba- tala as an omnipotent god who started the first human settlement at Ife and was later displaced by a strong impostor, Oduduwa. The priestess ended the song with prayers wishing all devotees and</page><page sequence="3">47 METAPHOR IN SOYINKA'S DRAMA spectators a prosperous life. As soon as the priestess settled down, the other singers and drummers found places to sit around the edges of the white line delimiting a big empty circle surrounded by devotees and spectators. Suddenly, the drummers and singers started to perform praise songs for Obatala, and, at the peak of the dance accompanying the drumming, a male character clad in white and carrying a white covered calabash emerged from the same di- rection from which others had previously come. The male charac- ter and others in white clothes joined in the dance. In the mean- time, the male character had put down the calabash and danced ecstatically. He subsequently went out of the circle with other dancers leaving the calabash behind. Another character then emerged amidst praises for Oduduwa from the same group of singers and drummers. This character moved back and forth in an inspectorial fashion in the circle, removed the calabash and ran out of the circle. Then, still amidst loud singing, the same charac- ter returned to the circle without the calabash and was joined in dancing by other white-clad individuals until the male character who initially brought the calabash returned and engaged him in a mock fight. The music then changed to a faster tempo and songs saying, "ojo Batala Bataasa" (the day of Obatala, father of the gods) rent the air. Shortly after, the Obatala figure (the first male character to come into the circle) was chased out of the circle by the Oduduwa figure (the character that removed the calabash). The music gradually petered out; the circle became empty and quiet. Immediately after, the two male characters returned to the circle and became locked in a mock wrestling contest amidst songs for Balufon and Oranmiyan, but the song was concerned more with Balufon than with Oranmiyan, having such praises for Balu- fon as the following: OmoSere gbogun de Balufon godogbo Omomagbo gbogun was Balufon joinjoin Ero ona parada OmoSere gbogun de Ogbogbo gbogun de Oyanyan gbogun was [Osere's son has brought war Balufon, the Stalwart Magbo's son has brought war</page><page sequence="4">48 'Ropo Sekoni Balufon, the unshakable Strangers disappear Osere's son has brought war The big-eared one has brought war The big-nosed one has brought war] During the mock fight, Balufon was felled and chased out of the circle by the Oranmiyan figure. The circle once more became emp- ty and quiet. Amidst this quiet, Yeyerisa, the priestess who led the group out of the Orisha shrine at the beginning of the festival, emerged from the middle of the crowd with a white calabash. She was ushered into the circle with music and praises for Moremi: Moremi, Obinrin ai be soro Moremi, Iyalode Amulero amona dan Afewe rola l'okaramfe [Moremi, woman volunteer for sacrifice Moremi, the woman leader The pillar of the house The person who makes the roads smooth Who buys honor with herbs At the hills of Oramfe] At the peak of the song, Yeyerisa brought the two warring male characters into the circle for reconciliation. Then the song changed back to praise for Obatala and all the singers and drummers moved into the circle to dance while Yeyerisa opened the calabash from which she sprayed, with a bundle of leaves, some liquid on parti- cipants and spectators alike. There are many ways-ranging from religious observance to ritual enactment of primordial bliss-to view this festival, but it is important, as Adedeji has said about the Ede version, to evaluate Obatala festivals within an aesthetic framework or as "a product of creative fantasy."7 Adedeji's idea of a structure of beginning, middle, and end, correlated in the case of an Obatala festival by the reenactment of the myth of creation, conquest, and return, says more about what happens in the reenactment than about the relation among the reenacted episodes. Our examination of the structure of the Ondo version of the Obatala ritual ritual drama, while recognizing those that have been identified in the Ede ver-</page><page sequence="5">49 METAPHOR IN SOYINKA'S DRAMA sion by Adedeji, also recognizes other structural features that we will later identify in some of Soyinka's scripts. In the first place, the ritual consists of incremental repetitions of discrete episodes separated by time but informed by similarity of motivation and consequence of actions. Although mostly non- verbal, the songs, announcing two different male characters, sug- gest that there are three distinct clusters of eposides: (1) the Oba- tala-Oduduwa fight over the calabash, (2) the Balufon-Oranmiyan fight, and (3) the Yeyerisa's reconciliation of the two male con- testants. Even though the first two episode clusters are, in histori- cal terms, separated by many years, they are brought together in the ritual for the simple reason that they repeat the same subjec- tive category of the struggle for power and leadership in Ife be- tween Obatala and Oduduwa on the one hand and Balufon and Oranmiyan on the other. Accordingly, this serial repetition of similar motifs is, in aes- thetic terms, a way of intensifying the tension suggested by the first confrontation between the two characters acting the roles of Obatala and Oduduwa. Moreover, in thematic terms, it is a de- vice for recalling and retaining essential images that pertain to the underlying concern of the performance in the minds of the audience. A similar use of repetition is evident in Soyinka's use of differ- ent temporal dimensions in A Dance of the Forests for the pur- pose of representing and reinforcing the feeling of crisis for his audience. While Soyinka's spatialization of a category of human actions in A Dance of the Forests serves to establish a model of audience expectation, thereby providing a major dramatic premise for other minor actions in the script, the playwright's effort in intensifying the spatialized dramatic event is subtly objectified by his use of three different dimensions of time: ancestral, social- historical, and transitional. Essentially, these three temporal di- mensions refer to three distinct points on the Yoruba cosmolo- gical space-time continuum. The world of the ancestors, called ancestral time in this study, refers to a timeless frame of reference that is ahistorical in that it is not completely passe or irrecoverable; this time-unit can be re- captured through reenactments, as in rituals. Transitional time refers to a temporal unit set apart by the Yoruba arbitrarily as a meeting point between ancestral and social- historical time. It is generally outside verifiable human existence and is also actualizable through reenactments by characters desig- nated for such purposes within the Yoruba society. It is a moment</page><page sequence="6">50 'Ropo Sekoni of becoming or essence formation, a formless moment that is often given form only through ritualization. Finally, social-historical time refers to the waking and sleeping period of human or anthropomorphic experience. Unlike the other two temporal categories, social time is verifiable and generally con- sidered to be within human awareness; it is, literally, the world of the living. Accordingly, all the episodes in A Dance of the Forests are ar- ranged in three clusters around these three temporal dimensions. Episode cluster A is constituted by actions and interactions of characters from the social world: Demoke, Rola, Adenebi, and Councillor and others that are involved in organizing the celebra- tion of "the gathering of the tribes." Moreover, it is the action within social time-the preparation for an elaborate celebration of an interethnic festival-that provides the axis for the entire script and establishes the only range of expectancies possible for the audience. For instance, this episode cluster supplies the prin- cipal basis for cognitive involvement of the audience, arousing, for example, such thoughts as what is the significance of the dance, will the dance materialize or not, what forces are available for either possibility? On the other hand, Soyinka's introduction of episodes from the other two temporal categories-ancestral and transitional-into the matrix of the play is a device for manipulat- ing audience feeling about the ramifications of the episodes al- ready represented by Demoke, Rola, Adenebi, and Councillor. Episode cluster B is made up of the activities of characters in the reincarnated forms of Demoke as Court Poet, Rola as Madame Tortoise, and Adenebi as Historian, in addition to the Dead War- rior, his wife, and Mata Kharibu, all of whom embody what we have hitherto called ancestral time. All these characters are, like their counterparts within the social time unit, involved in one form of persecution and exploitation or another. Kharibu sen- tences the warrior to death for disagreeing with his bellicose poli- cies and Madame Tortoise flirts with the warrior in the same man- ner that Rola flirts with Obaneji, for instance. Court Poet is also instrumental in the death of his apprentice just as Demoke is in- volved in the killing of Oremole. The third episode cluster is made up of the actions of charac- ters drawn from the transitional temporal realm. This episode cluster details the trial instanced by Aroni, the rivalry between Ogun and Eshuoro, and the partial arbitration by Obaneji, all of whom are reminiscent of the Yoruba intermediaries between natural and supernal awareness.</page><page sequence="7">51 METAPHOR IN SOYINKA'S DRAMA The structural device of incremental repetition is also evident in a more subtle manner in Kongi's Harvest. There is a constant aes- thetic phenomenon that holds the script together and is also capa- ble of facilitating audience apprehension of its concern. It is the device of subtle repetitions of a single preoccupation-the love of power and public adoration-in all the three spatial categories of the play: Kongi's cell-mountain retreat, Danlola's palace, and Segi's bar. Thus, while the critics' view of Danlola and Kongi as representatives of two critical generations in African history-the waning period of monarchy and its challenge by younger products of colonial education-is insightful as an instance of referentialist criticism, an examination of both characters as well as of the Segi- Daodu unit, within an aesthetic framework, will show that, apart from the differences of style, Danlola and Kongi manifest the same obsession. They are both in love with power, obsessed with image building, and characterized by ineffective political leader- ship. Similarly, a dysfunctional relation with power is also sug- gested, as we will show later, on Daodu's part. Soyinka's attempt to control and vary audience experience of Kongi's Harvest is objectified by two structural relations: multiple episodes of different objective manifestations featured in the play's matrix and the implication of interepisode or interimage similarities among these diverse episodes that suggest the corres- pondence of motivation among different characters. For instance, the notion of dysfunctional political leadership objectified by some form of excessiveness is present in each cluster of episodes. Danlola and Kongi are both in love with extremes. Oba Danlola manifests in episode cluster A-either in prison or in his palace- an excessively hedonistic disposition. He is depicted as being im- pervious to the existing sociopolitical needs of his subjects; he, for instance, hardly talks about the effect of Kongi's schemes on his subjects as a whole. Rather, he repeatedly expresses desires to savor life to its fullest as an individual. He is always fascinated by the flamboyant-heavy colorful dresses, silver accessories, and praise songs-regardless of the immediate needs of the people over whom he reigns. Danlola's predisposition for the irrelevant in the face of the urgent is objectified by his consistent recourse to sex- ual imagery while important political matters are being discussed. Evidence of Danlola's lustfulness is manifested in his irrelevant response to Daodu's request for his cooperation with plans to counter Kongi's heavy-handed regime (emphasis added):</page><page sequence="8">52 'Ropo Sekoni Daodu: It means nothing. Nothing can alter what today will bring. And your compliance is a vital part of it. Danlola: My vital part shall exhaust itself in my favourite's bed. Call me Wuraola.8 Furthermore, in spite of Kongi's curtailment of Danlola's power, both show a similar pleasure in the exercise of power for its own sake. For instance, Danlola's relationship to Dende is as demeaning as Kongi's to the members of his Aweri fraternity. One instance of Danlola's flair for drama and show of power is objectified in his attempts to curse the prison superintendent (p. 7): Danlola [swelling, swelling.... ]: He paraded me to the world L'ogolonto I leave this abuse To the judgement of the ... Superintendent: Please - plead with him. Intercede for me. Sarumi: Kabiyesi, a father employs only a small stick on his child, he doesn't call in the policemen to take him to gaol. Don't give voice to the awesome names on an Oba's tongue; when you feel kinder, they cannot easily be re- called. They must fulfill what task they were called to do. Danlola's power, unlike Kongi's, is not to jail or shoot an oppo- nent; it is characterized by the power to destroy the sanity of one's opponent. Danlola, like Kongi, does not hesitate to use this power until he has been copiously flattered by Sarumi, his praise singers, and his wives. Episode cluster B concerns Kongi's life style. It details his fast- ing sessions on the mountain, his debates with his advisers, the re- formed Aweri, and his exchanges with the organizing secretary on the latter's progress for a successful harvest. Although there are differences between Kongi and Danlola in terms of external mani- festations of their love for power or public acknowledgment, there is a striking similarity of preoccupation with power between both of them. In aesthetic terms, the playwright attenuates audience expectation of an internal mediation of the conflict between Kongi and Danlola by evoking images that imply the love for power and position by both characters. Audience expectation of an internal mediation or the possibility of a meaningful resolution of the conflict between both characters</page><page sequence="9">5 3 METAPHOR IN SOYINKA'S DRAMA becomes elusive with the recognition by the audience of similar images of obsession with power in episode clusters A and B. Like Danlola, Kongi is infatuated with flattery; his cell is populated by sycophants who are at ease in singing Kongi's praises. For in- stance, Sarumi's view of Danlola (p. 57)- The king is ... He who appoints the head's pulse centre With the oil of sacrifice The king is a god. -is as laudatory and flattering as the organizing secretary's suggest- ed titles for the photographs of Kongi (p. 39): "The loneliness of the Pure.... The Uneasy Head.... A Saint at Twilight.... The Giver of Live . . ." Moreover, Kongi shows in this episode cluster a flair for displaying power similar to that shown by Danlola in episode cluster A. Kongi, as in Danlola's attempt to curse the prison super- intendent, will only be dissuaded from killing some of his prisoners- opponents by flattery from the organizing secretary. The fact that Kongi and Danlola share a love of public adoration is well captured in the secretary's and Daodu's assessment of both characters (p. 41): Daodu: The enactment of it alone should appeal to him. Kabiyesi loves to act roles. Like kingship. For him, king- ship is a role. Secretary: Now where did I hear that before? Seems I heard it ... that's right. Now that's funny isn't it? One of the Aweri said exactly the same thing of Kongi. "A flair for gestures" he said. Daodu: Maybe that's why they hate each other's guts. Secretary: Professional jealousy eh? Ha, Ha, couldn't agree with you more.... It is against this background of a dysfunctional view of posi- tions of power by Kongi and Danlola that Soyinka introduces the third episode cluster that only suggests a slight modification of relations of forms with the two previous episode clusters. With the images of ineffective leadership objectified in cluster A on the he- donistic level by Danlola and on the pseudoheroic plane by Kongi in episode cluster B, the playwright prepares the audience for the</page><page sequence="10">54 'Ropo Sekoni possibility of external mediation in which a third character, pos- sessing more functional values and programs, may emerge to dis- place the two politically effete leaders. Thus, the audience is likely to be very optimistic about the Segi-Daodu episode cluster. Episode cluster C is characterized by dancing and drinking and occasionally by the organizing secretary's visit to Daodu. Initially, audience expectation of the need for a more dynamic leadership than that of Kongi or Danlola is activated by two factors: Daodu is heir apparent to Danlola and Segi is an ex-mistress of Kongi as well as a daughter of his archenemy. Hope is likely to rise in the audience with Daodu's rightful claim to power and the inimical relationship existing between Kongi and Segi. Moreover, their spa- tial intimacy as opposed to the spatial distance between Kongi and Danlola is an icon of potential unity of forces capable of contend- ing seriously with Danlola's and Kongi's unproductive form of political leadership. Daodu's success on the farm contrasts him with Kongi and per- haps Danlola in terms of providing an efficient food supply to the community, but his relation to the socio-political dimension of Isma is vague and thus the audience doubts Daodu's ability to complete the Herculean task ahead of him-the displacement of his uncle and of Kongi. For instance, little is known of his back- ground and his political plans, if any, remain obscure. Yet audi- ence optimism is stabilized by Daodu's acknowledged opposition to Kongi's policies. Audience sensation may even be activated with Daodu's breaking of Danlola's talking drum at the end of this epi- sode cluster. The elevation of audience emotion and hope by Daodu's initial success-the breaking of Danlola's drum-is gradu- ally dissipated in cluster D as soon as Daodu starts to manifest a lack of initiative and adequate self-confidence. Once again, Dao- du's sphere is not without its share of the problems of achieving viable leadership in Isma. While Daodu's disposition is not charac- terized by Danlola's hedonism or Kongi's masochism, he is not able to assume necessary control of urgent situations when they arise. This tendency to yield the position of leadership to others for fear of mistakes is evident in his compulsive dependence on Segi for further directions after his invigorating speech (pp. 80-81, emphasis added): Segi: I'll be back directly Daodu. Let everything go on as planned. Daodu: Such as what? After what has happened, what? ...</page><page sequence="11">5 METAPHOR IN SOYINKA'S DRAMA Segi: So he came back? Why didn't you tell me? Daodu: I could do nothing to stop him ... He said he had to do it and no one else. Segi: It doesn't matter. Daodu: We've failed again Segi. Segi: No, not altogether. Daodu: What else can one do now? Segi: The reason is Harvest, so let there be plenty of everything.... Daodu: What are you talking about? What do I do now? With episode cluster D-the harvest and Danlola's attempted exile-the playwright subtly suggests the nondynamic situation of Isma's political crisis. Here, in a summary fashion, Soyinka gathers all the contending characters together in the same space only to repeat their characteristic weaknesses that militate against resolv- ing Isma's crisis. The problem of space discourages us from detailed analysis of more of Soyinka's plays. Suffice it to say, however, that incremen- tal repetition abounds in other plays as well. This structural device is evident in the internal reenactments in The Lion and the Jewel, especially where Lakunle's and Baroka's dispositions are represent- ed in a series of tempocausally unrelated events. For example, while the reenactment of Baroka's bribing of the engineer bears no logical connection to his desire to marry Sidi, the fact that Baroka successfully bribed the surveyor to achieve his personal ends subtly foreshadows the possibility of his similar enticement of Sidi with the stamp machine. Similarly, the actions of Particu- lars Joe and Chief-in-Town in The Road could have been omitted without any adverse effect on the wholeness of the play, but while in it they variegate the audience's experience of the play and also serve as a modulation of Professor's exploitative disposition. Thus, a general characteristic of Soyinka's dramaturgy is the pattern of web-like rather than tree-like internal relations of the parts of his scripts. This structural phenomenon depends more on metaphoric than metonymic imagination. It views dramatic com-</page><page sequence="12">56 'Ropo Sekoni munication as a system in which the audience learns through the recognition of similarities between apparently unrelated images with a view to emphasizing the epistemic dimension of the object with which they are confronted. This view differs from the emphasis on tempocausality and the emotive aspect of drama characteristic of Aristotle's organicity. Furthermore, the convoluted, rather than linear, movement or the repetitive, rather than translational, development of the Oba- tala Festival, and, for instance, of A Dance of the Forest, Kongi's Harvest, and to some extent The Lion and the Jewel and The Road, communicate effectively through the use of metaphor. This communication is achieved, as we have demonstrated in the pre- ceding paragraphs, through the emphasis of features of the prin- cipal or primary subjective category by using secondary or subsid- iary images that imply statements about the primary vision of the writer.9 While the web-like, or network-like, structure described in the Obatala ritual and in some of Soyinka's drama may not produce the same emotional state achievable through organic or tree-like structures favored by Aristotle, it possesses its own aesthetic qual- ity. It is, for instance, capable of varying audience experience with the multiplicity of images while simultaneously controlling that experience through a preponderance of interimage similiarities on the cognitive level. While its structure may not necessarily achieve the emotional satisfaction of an experience of wholeness charac- teristic of tempocausal continuity or, in Aristotle's term, of unity of action, it does have its own quality; it attempts to produce in the audience the emotional satisfaction that accompanies the var- iation of sensations. The web-like structure, characterized by in- cremental repetition of diverse images capable of semantic equiv- alence, is indeed not devoid of emotiveness. The interposition of continuous and discrete episodes or of plot-propelling and plot- stagnating images temporarily serves to frustrate the audience from attaining necessary knowledge of the characters' actions. The final recognition of semantic equivalence between the diversity of images in a retrospective reading or experience of such a play pro- vides emotional satisfaction that often accompanies cognitive dis- covery or recognition. Finally, this dramatic form that emphasizes connection between subsequent images of a play in metaphoric as opposed to meto- nymic terms, though often hard to comprehend easily, serves a metacommunicative purpose. The use of tempocausally unrelated episodes is capable of drawing attention to the fictive process.</page><page sequence="13">57 METAPHOR IN SOYINKA'S DRAMA With such attention it can effectively alienate the audience from the raw experience of primary characters and is thus capable of enhancing critical viewing of the world evoked in rituals and drama.
