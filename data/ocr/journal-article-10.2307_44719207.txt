ABSTRACT In 1998, Rouhana et al. described development of a new device, called the IR-TRACC (InfraRed - Telescoping Rod for Assessment of Chest Compression). In its original concept, the IR-TRACC uses two infrared LEDs inside of a telescoping rod to measure deflection. One LED serves as a light transmitter and the other as a light receiver. The output from the receiver LED is converted to a linear function of chest compression using an analog circuit. Tests have been performed with IR-TRACC units at various labs around the world since 1998. A first- generation IR-TRACC system was retrofit into a Q3 dummy by TNO. Similarly, a mid sized male Hybrid III dummy thorax and a small female Hybrid III dummy thorax have been designed by First Technology Safety Systems (FTSS) such that each contains 4 second- generation IR-TRACC units. The second-generation IR- TRACC is the result of continued development by FTSS, especially in the areas of the analysis circuit, manufacturing and calibration methods. This paper presents the results of these efforts with the IR-TRACC and the current state of knowledge relative to its use and usefulness. INTRODUCTION Measurement of chest deflection is critical for the assessment of thoracic injury since deflection and the viscous response are two of the most widely accepted criteria for chest injury (chest deflection is used in FMVSS 208 and the viscous response, V*C, is used in European regulations). As a result, over the years since anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs) or crash test dummies first became available, many different devices have been developed to measure chest deflection. Rouhana et al. [1]1 published results of the development and preliminary testing of a new device, called the IR- TRACC (InfraRed - Telescoping Rod for Assessment of Chest Compression). In its original concept, the IR- TRACC consists of two infrared light emitting diodes (LEDs) "facing" each other from the two ends of a stainless steel, double-gimbaled telescoping rod (Figure 1). One LED serves as the light emitter and the other as the receiver (Figure 2). The IR-TRACC works on the principle that the irradiance from a point source decreases as the inverse square of the distance from the source. 1 Numbers in square brackets denote references found at the end of the paper. 304</page><page sequence="2">Figure 1. Photograph of the IR-TRACC (InfraRed Telescoping Rod for the Assessment of Chest Compression) The initial intent of the program was to develop a transducer that measures chest deflection in the Hybrid III mid-sized male frontal impact dummy at rates high enough to be used in out-of-position airbag evaluations. Because of the increasing focus of efforts in the safety community regarding children, and with the assumption that devices developed for children might be readily scaleable to adults, the program shifted from the mid- sized male dummy to the 6 year old child dummy. Since information relative to the many other measurement methods attempted in the past was presented by Rouhana et al. [1], they will not be covered here. However, information will be provided relative to the standard Hybrid III chest deflection transducer because that is the basis for comparison with the IR- TRACC. In addition, information on the method used in the NHTSA's Advanced ATD will be presented because the IR-TRACC builds to some extent on that work as originally conceived and first implemented by Schneider et al. [2], When the Hybrid III dummy was introduced in 1976 it utilized an "articulated arm" chest deflection transducer [3,4], This transducer consists of a rotary potentiometer mounted on the thoracic spine and connected by an aluminum rod to a ball and Delrin slider mechanism on the sternum (Figure 3). As the chest wall moves relative to the spine, the ball moves up or down the slider track and changes the output of the potentiometer in proportion to the relative distance between the chest and spine. The original device was capable of measuring deflections up to 90 mm. Over the years a number of issues have arisen regarding the measurement made using the articulated arm of Hybrid III [5,6,7,8]. These include: • loss of data because of ball-slider decoupling in out-of-position airbag tests and high severity belted crash tests • lack of three dimensional understanding of chest motion Figure 2. Schematic of IR-TRACC principle of operation • difficulty differentiating signal due to electrical noise • limited displacement measurement, especially in smaller dummies • lack of understanding as to the exact point on the chest to which the deflection measurement corresponds • measurement of only a single area of the chest with no room to add more transducers In the development of the Advanced ATD under contract from the NHTSA, Schneider et al. [2] developed a double-gimbaled string potentiometer (DGSP) in a telescoping joystick. The double-gimbaling allowed the DGSP transducers to track up/down and lateral motion using rotary potentiometers attached to the pivots. The string potentiometer down the center of the telescoping joystick allowed tracking the in/out motion of the anterior chest wall relative to the spine. Figure 3. Photo of Hybrid III Articulated Arm Chest Deflection Transducer 305</page><page sequence="3">One major issue with the DGSPs was the inability to accurately track motion of the chest at very high deflection speeds. The reasons for this can be found in a description of the mechanics of string potentiometers. A string potentiometer consists of a wire wound around a spool connected to a rotary potentiometer. The spool has a spring drive to pull the wire back onto the spool if it has been pulled out. However, the rotational inertia of the spool must be overcome before any motion can begin and therefore, before the string begins to move. In an out-of-position test, with the chest in contact with the airbag module, as the chest begins deforming the string typically becomes slack before the spool begins turning. This limitation increases the difficulty in evaluating out-of- position occupant interactions with deploying airbags because there is a delay in the response of the deflection measurement which can change the timing of deflection and corresponding compression velocity. Another issue relative to chest deflection measurement was the electrical or mechanical noise associated with previous sensors. Because differentiation is needed in the calculation of the Viscous Response, noise in the deflection-time history can cause problems. In Viscous Response calculations, differentiation of a noisy signal typically leads to an unusable result. And, the degree of filtering necessary to smooth a noisy signal for this calculation typically causes unacceptable loss of data. The IR-TRACC appeared to address all of the previous issues relative to speed, noise and durability [1], But, in order to allow other labs to evaluate the IR-TRACC and to determine whether there were any practical issues with its use, a round robin test series was begun. Six prototype IR-TRACC systems (Units 1 - 6) with modified sternums and thoracic spine boxes were fabricated for the 6-year-old Hybrid III dummy. These were offered to any laboratory from around the world for evaluation and an opportunity to provide feedback on the IR-TRACC. Figure 4a. IR-TRACCs in the WorldSID Dummy At the same time, work was progressing on several new ATDs and several of the design teams requested information on the IR-TRACC for possible inclusion into these dummies. Thus, TNO incorporated an IR-TRACC into the thorax of a prototype Q3 dummy, the WorldSID design team used six IR-TRACCs in the shoulder, chest and abdominal ribs of the first prototype WorldSID (Figure 4a), First Technology Safety Systems (FTSS) at the request of the SAE Hybrid III Dummy Family Task Group incorporated two IR-TRACCs into the Hybrid III 10-year-old child dummy (Figure 4b), GESAC tested the IR-TRACC for possible inclusion into the THOR dummy, FTSS built a Hybrid III small female dummy chest called THMPHR (Thorax for Multi-Point High Rate testing) for Transport Canada with the standard Hybrid III chest potentiometer and four IR-TRACCs (Figure 4c), and FTSS built a mid sized male version of THMPHR. This paper presents the results of tests with these first- generation prototype IR-TRACC units and some second- generation units in terms of measurements made and laboratory performance of the device. Figure 4b. IR-TRACCs in the Hybrid III 10-year-old dummy Figure 4c. IR-TRACCs in Small Female THMPHR (Thorax for Multi-Point High Rate testing) 306</page><page sequence="4">METHODS Tests of the IR-TRACC have been performed by FTSS, General Motors (GM), GESAC [9], Lear Corp. [10], the Occupant Safety Research Partnership (OSRP) [11], TNO [12], Transport Canada [13] and the Transportation Research Center of Ohio (TRC) [14]. As will be shown, the circuit and some of the wiring in the prototype units led to some poor results. In 2000, FTSS began examining the production feasibility of the IR- TRACC and revised the circuit design to accommodate the issues that had been observed in previous tests. Some of the tests presented here used units that were built before the redesign and some used units that were built after the redesign. These have been noted in Table I. Therefore, while the test methodologies will be presented based on the different types of tests performed, the results will be grouped by IR-TRACC generation. While the first generation IR-TRACC had the prototype circuit and some contact problems, the second generation IR-TRACC had the revised circuit and used an improved wire soldering methodology. BENCH IR-TRACC CALIBRATION (QUASI-STATIC) FTSS has developed a bench top calibration device to enable accurate determination of IR-TRACC scale factors by converting voltage output from the unit into displacement measurements in millimeters (Figure 5). This calibration device consists of a fixture to which both ends of the telescoping rod are attached, a mechanical gear drive for changing the distance between the ends of the fixture (and also the rod), a digital micrometer caliper for measuring the distance and a power supply and Figure 5. Benchtop IR-TRACC calibration fixture voltmeter for powering and recording the output voltage from the IR-TRACC circuit. Thus, the sensitivity of each IR-TRACC device can be determined and checked in the lab. LINEAR IMPACTOR TESTS (GESAC AND GM) Both of these test series were done with the IR-TRACC unit out of the dummy on bench tests. For the tests at GESAC, the IR-TRACC was mounted rigidly to a test fixture that also housed, in parallel, a Linear Motion Position Transducer (LMPT - Duncan Electronics Model 106) [9]. This fixture allowed the instruments to travel through a 55 mm range of motion without rotation after an impact to a flat padded surface to which the instruments were attached. This gave a side-by-side comparison of the two devices. Six dynamic tests were performed with peak velocities varying from 2 m/s to 10 m/s. Data was acquired at 10000 samples per second, filtered with a CFC 600 filter and differentiated using mid-point differentiation. The GM tests used a high-speed pneumatic impactor to deform a movable fixture containing the IR-TRACC mounted within (Figure 6). The test methodology is described in detail in Rouhana et al. (1998) and so will not be repeated here. The tests reported in that paper were performed at 3 m/s, 10 m/s and 18 m/s. One additional test was performed after the paper was written to perform a test at the highest speed attainable using the pneumatic impactor. The load chamber pressure was set to 225 psi. The IR-TRACC data taken at 10000 samples per second was compared with high-speed video data taken at 9600 frames per second. Figure 6.

The dummy was first tested with the standard components and a Space Age Controls string potentiometer (Model 30333 with a fiber string). Frontal and lateral thoracic certification tests were performed at 4.3 m/s and 6.7 m/s according to the Q3 manual [15]. The certification tests were then repeated after replacing the string potentiometer and standard Q3 spine with IR-TRACC first generation prototype Unit #1 and a modified spine. Figure 7a shows a bottom view of the Q3 with the IR- TRACC set up to measure for frontal impact and Figure 7b shows the IR-TRACC set up to measure for side impact. DROP TESTS (OSRP) These tests were performed to simulate a thoracic calibration test because the test facility did not have a Q3 thorax pendulum. The Q3 dummy was placed either on its back or on its side underneath a vertical drop tower. The pelvis was removed to allow high-speed video coverage internal to the thorax. A 3.8 kg TNO calibration pendulum was raised to a height of 508 mm (20 inches) or 762 mm (30 inches). The pendulum was released by an electromechanical release mechanism and the pendulum was allowed to fall onto the dummy chest at speeds of approximately 2.8 m/s and 3.7 m/s. AIRBAG OOP (OUT-OF-POSITION) TESTS (Q3 AT DAIMLERCHRYSLER, HYBRID III-6 AT GM AND LEAR) The Q3 dummy was also tested in airbag out-of-position tests as part of the OSRP evaluation of the dummy. These tests have been reported by Berliner et al. [11] and will not be described in detail here. Data will be presented showing the Q3 deflections from door- mounted side airbag tests with the dummy facing the door and with the dummy leaning on the door. Data from a frontal passenger airbag deployment with the dummy in ISO Position 2 will also be presented. GM and Lear ran frontal airbag out-of-position tests with a Hybrid III 6 year old child dummy that had been retrofit with an IR-TRACC system (rod, LEDs, circuit, modified Figure 7a. IR-TRACC in Q3 dummy in frontal impact configuration Figure 7b. IR-TRACC in Q3 dummy in lateral impact configuration 308</page><page sequence="6">spine box and modified sternum). The sternum modifications included provision for mounting an accelerometer above and below the attachment point of the IR-TRACC. The accelerometers allowed the displacement measured by the IR-TRACC to be compared with that calculated by double integration of the acceleration-time signals referenced to a third accelerometer mounted to the thoracic spine. For the GM tests (only), a photographic target was also rigidly attached to the dummy's thoracic spine at the same "anatomic level" as the IR-TRACC attachment to the sternum (Figure 8). A rod was also rigidly attached to a rib just lateral to the sternum. The rod was directed out the back of the dummy next to the location of the fixed spine target and a second photographic target was attached to its end. A steering wheel with a non-depowered experimental driver airbag module was rigidly mounted to a bedplate (GM) or sled (Lear) such that a line passing axially through the steering wheel was vertical, with the rim at the top and the hub at the bottom and with a plane passing through the steering wheel rim parallel to the bedplate or sled. The dummy was placed face down on top of the steering wheel and airbag module. Paper honeycomb was used to control the initial separation distance between the airbag module and the dummy chest and to help position the dummy so that the thoracic spine was horizontal (Figure 8). Four tests were performed at GM with a sternum to airbag distance of approximately 50 mm and two tests were performed with a sternum to airbag distance of approximately 25 mm. Three tests were performed at Lear Corp with the chest in contact with the module at the beginning of the test (0 mm separation). Figure 8. GM Out-of-position airbag test with IR-TRACC in Hybrid III 6-year-old CHEST CALIBRATION (FTSS) Pendulum tests were performed on the Hybrid III 10- year-old with two second-generation IR-TRACC units, and on the WorldSID dummy with six second-generation IR-TRACC units. These tests were performed according to the dummy calibration procedures adapted from the Hybrid III Dummy Users Manual [16] and a draft WorldSID Users Manual [17]. THMPHR TESTS (TRANSPORT CANADA) Transport Canada performed dynamic full-scale tests using the THMPHR dummy (small female chest with 4 IR-TRACCs and standard chest potentiometer). The IR- TRACC data and chest potentiometer data were filtered at CFC600. The full-scale tests involved 5 tests that were dynamic frontal impacts at 50 kilometers per hour of an SUV or car into the side of a mid sized sedan. The instrumented small female THMPHR dummy was belted into the driver position of the bullet vehicle in all tests. Data from two of those tests is included here and the test conditions are recorded below: Test Conditions • SUV B was a small SUV that impacted a mid sized sedan at 50 km/hr with the bullet vehicle's wheels straight to impact the car at an angle of 90 degrees. The dummy was positioned with the seat in the full forward track location. The dummy was restrained by a three-point belt, but there was no airbag deployment. • SUV D was a full sized SUV that also impacted a mid sized sedan at 50km/hr with the bullet vehicle's wheels straight to impact the car at an angle of 90 degrees. The dummy was restrained by a three-point belt and an airbag. RESULTS As will be shown, the data with the early IR-TRACC units was susceptible to a number of errors caused by two main factors. First, in the early units, the wires were susceptible to breakage because of their routing and some of the connections appeared to have been cold soldered. These caused an intermittent problem during impact conditions. Second, the circuit design inadvertently amplified any electrical noise generated by the first issue. Since the amount of data available is so small, data generated with the early units will be presented even though some errors are noticeable. The errors in the first generation IR-TRACCs were corrected in the second-generation IR-TRACC design, manufacturing and circuit as will be evident when comparing the data from the newer units to the data from 309</page><page sequence="7">the prototypes. The linearization circuit has been reduced in size and is now attached closer to the end segment of the telescoping rod. The circuit box is attached to the end segment of the telescoping rod in the Q3 and adult versions of the IR-TRACC and is mounted near the end segment in the Hybrid III 6-year-old and 10-year-old versions. This closer attachment point reduces the length of wire between the receiver and the analysis circuit (Figure 1). Likewise, the amplification by the linearization circuit has been reduced by two orders of magnitude (factor of 100), which should reduce the amount of noise. The following results will be divided into sections, with the first section presenting data from prototype IR-TRACCs and the second section presenting data from second generation IR-TRACCs. Figure 9a. Benchtop calibration results of IR-TRACC unit #1 at GM and at DaimlerChrysler Figure 9b. Benchtop calibration results of IR-TRACC unit #5 at GM and at Lear Corp Unless otherwise specified, all of the data presented in this section and the Appendix has been filtered with an SAE CFC 600 filter. TESTS WITH FIRST GENERATION (PROTOTYPE) IR- TRACCS Calibration Tests - The calibration tests, being essentially quasi-static in nature, gave results that were independent of IR-TRACC generation. Data from calibration tests of two, first generation, IR-TRACC units (#1 and #5) and from three, second generation, IR-TRACC units (small child size, large child size and adult size) are shown in Figures 9a - 9c. It is clear from the graphs that the IR- TRACC provides an output that is an extremely linear function of the displacement input. In fact, the linearity is so close that the two curves on each graph are nearly indistinguishable (the dashed lines are the IR-TRACC output and the solid lines are the linear regression lines). This is independent of the IR-TRACC unit or size. In addition, the error from lateral play of the telescoping rod, discussed as a source of error in Rouhana et al. [1], appears to have been reduced in the second generation to less than 2%. Linear Impactor Tests - Figure 10 shows the displacement-time history and velocity-time history of the highest speed pneumatic impactor test at GM. This test used IR-TRACC Unit #0 which was the first prototype 6- year-old unit and was built prior to the round robin prototypes. The data showed that the velocity attained was approximately 19 m/s. This test speed exceeded the original project goal of measurement capability up to 18 m/s. The deflection data agrees fairly well with the ultra- high speed video analysis. Since they were taken with Figure 9c.

Displacement-Time and Velocity-Time data from highest rate test performed at 19 m/s pneumatic impact (IR- TRACC data is plotted as a solid line and video data is plotted as dashed lines) slightly different sampling rates, perfect agreement was not expected. GESAC performed a comparison of IR-TRACC Unit 6 displacement data with that from a Linear Motion Position Transducer (LMPT) in bench testing at speeds from 2 m/s to 9.8 m/s. While the data has not yet been published, preliminary results indicate that the data showed good agreement between the IR-TRACC and LMPT [9]. Q3 PROTOTYPE TESTS It should be noted that IR-TRACC Prototype Unit 1 had been quickly retrofit into the prototype Q3 for these tests and had early prototype mechanical connections to the dummy. These mechanical connections (see Figures 7a and 7b) are believed to be responsible for some of the noise observed in the data. IR-TRACC unit 1 was later found to also contain a cold soldered connection at one of the LEDs causing intermittent noise. Unit 1 was used in the TRC, TNO and OSRP tests. TRC Data - Figure 11a and 11b show the output from the Q3 dummy in 4.3 m/s frontal impact thorax calibration tests performed at TRC before the OSRP dummy evaluation airbag test phase [11]. These data were filtered at CFC600 and show the data from a standard Q3 string potentiometer and the IR-TRACC, respectively. The peak deflections recorded were 23.7 and 23.1 mm, respectively. Some noise can be observed in the IR-TRACC data appearing as small dips in the signal at 140 ms, 200 ms and along the baseline after 260 ms. Figure 11a. String potentiometer Displacement-Time data from Q3 frontal thorax calibration test Figure 11b. IR-TRACC Displacement-Time data from Q3 frontal thorax calibration test Figure 12 shows the IR-TRACC data from a 4.3 m/s right lateral thorax calibration test at TRC that was also filtered at CFC 600. This data appears to be smoother than the frontal test data. The methods of connection to the dummy were different and may have played a role in the different amounts of noise in the data. Figure 12. IR-TRACC Displacement-Time data from Q3 right lateral thorax calibration test 311</page><page sequence="9">TNO Data - Figures 13a and 13b show data from 4.3 m/s frontal thorax calibration tests performed at TNO. Here again since the same IR-TRACC prototype unit was used as that used at TRC, there were some anomalies in the displacement time history that were not seen in the tests reported by Rouhana et al. with a different prototype unit [lj. As in the TRC data, these anomalies consisted of small dips and peaks in the signal at various times during the displacement. Figures 14a and 14b show the velocity-time history determined from the IR-TRACC in Figure 13a and from a standard string potentiometer (whose displacement data is not shown). The dips and peaks at 28 and 35 ms show up as velocity fluctuations in the IR-TRACC velocity data. The string pot data appears to be much smoother. The tests at TNO also included evaluation of any change to the force-deflection response of the thorax caused by the IR-TRACC. This was considered because the IR- TRACC includes a stainless steel telescoping rod whose mass might influence the response. Figures 15a and 15b show the 4.3 m/s and 6.7 m/s frontal thorax response Figure 13a. IR-TRACC Displacement-Time from Q3 frontal thorax calibration test 997005 at TNO Figure 13b.

Velocity-Time determined from the string potentiometer in Q3 frontal thorax calibration test 986944 at CFC180 curves of Q3 obtained with both IR-TRACC and standard Q3 string potentiometer. As can be seen, except for the very initial loading region of the graphs, the response curves are within the test-to-test variation of the two devices. OSRP Data - Figures 16a - 16d show the output from the IR-TRACC in the Q3 from the drop tests at 2.8 m/s and 3.7 m/s. While the overall performance of the IR- TRACC was good, the dips and peaks were visible again in this data upon magnification of the scales. OUT-OF-POSITION AIRBAG TESTS OSRP Data - The displacement-time histories from the side and frontal passenger airbag out-of-position tests are shown in Figure 17. This data again shows the dips and peaks, but otherwise shows that the IR-TRACC data looks quite reasonable. In the passenger airbag tests, the IR-TRACC connection bracket separated from the sternum of the Q3. This led to the unexpected signals shown. 312</page><page sequence="10">Table II.

Impact velocity is 4.3 m/s GM Data - All of the tests with the non-depowered experimental airbags had at least one of the accelerometers with an acceleration signal that was clipped by inadvertently exceeding the calibrated range of the instrumentation (see Appendix I). As a result, the double integrated acceleration data contains some uncertainty and did not always give a meaningful result. Nevertheless, the data from IR-TRACC Unit 2 is compared with integrated accelerometer data in Figure 18 for the six tests. These data were filtered with CFC 600 and CFC 180 (Appendix I) filters for comparison. While the displacement data from the two different filter methods is almost indistinguishable, the velocity data Figure 1 5b: Q3 Force-Deflection data for standard string potentiometer (solid) and IR-TRACC (dashed), filtered at CFC600. Impact velocity is 6.7 m/s and V*C data show more variation. Table II gives the maxima for the velocity and V*C, respectively at the two filter levels. The velocities and V*C measured by the IR- TRACC were generally higher than those calculated by the accelerometers when filtered at CFC 600. Velocity-time histories and V*C-time histories are shown in Figures 1 9 and 20, respectively.

TESTS WITH SECOND GENERATION IR-TRACCS Hybrid III 10-Year-Qld - Figure 24 shows the deflection- time history for a thoracic calibration test with the Hybrid III 10-year-old child dummy. Since this dummy has two IR-TRACCs (one connected to the top of the sternum and one connected to the bottom of the sternum) and a standard rotary chest potentiometer, three deflection curves are obtained for each test. As seen in the graph, the peak chest deflection occurred at the top of the sternum under this test condition. The rotary potentiometer data was bracketed by the data from the two IR-TRACCs. WorldSID - Data from a 4.3 m/s mid-thoracic calibration test of the WorldSID is shown in Figure 25. The IR- TRACC response is smooth throughout the range of the impact and return to zero. THMPHR Data - Figures 26 shows radial displacement- time data (negative data) and angular displacement-time data (positive data) from the second generation IR- TRACC with rotary potentiometers in the FTSS multi- point measurement thorax. The radial and angular data combination allows calculations of 2-D motion of the four attachment points on or near the sternum (depending on THMPHR configuration). Only the lateral data is collected because the Hybrid III chest is constrained from large vertical motions by the rib guides. Note that the lateral motion of the chest in this test was less than 6 degrees. The displacements measured by the four IR-TRACCs in the x-y plane and x-y displacement measured by the Figure 16c.

This figure demonstrates two effects. First, it shows the additional information gained by a multi-point measurement. In this test, the driver dummy exhibited more chest deformation in the upper right ribs than at the sternum or in the lower right or left ribs. Second, it shows that in this test the standard potentiometer underestimated the maximum chest compression by about 2 mm. While the displacement of the upper right chest IR-TRACC was approximately 24 mm, the standard potentiometer indicated approximately 22 mm of displacement. It also appears to have overestimated the lower rib deflections, which were 14 mm and 19 mm for the left and right sides, respectively. Although FTSS has also built a mid sized male THMPHR dummy, data is not yet available for that dummy. DISCUSSION FIRST GENERATION IR-TRACC The first generation IR-TRACC was tested by GM, GESAC, Lear Corporation, OSRP, TNO and TRC of Ohio. Qualitative analyses of the data from these tests in conjunction with the quantitative data presented earlier allows for an overall evaluation of the device. Q3 Dummy TNO Conclusions - TNO tested the IR-TRACC in the Q3 dummy and evaluated the biomechanical response, overall operation and output signal [12]. Their main conclusions are summarized below. • Biomechanical Response - The design of the IR- TRACC and modified spine did not change the response of the Q3 significantly, i.e. the responses with the standard string potentiometer and IR- TRACC were the same (Figures 15a and 15b). There were some small differences, especially in the first few milliseconds after initial impact, but these were not believed to be of consequence. They concluded that the Q3 dummy with an integral IR- TRACC has acceptable biomechanical response for use in automotive testing. • Operational Issues - TNO stated that the IR-TRACC performed well and its output was linear. However, they stated that their main issue of concern with the IR-TRACC was that it could not be hooked up to their standard data acquisition system. By using a Figure 17.

Displacement-Time in Hybrid III 6-year-old child dummy in GM out-of-position airbag tests separate power supply and signal conditioner they were able to perform their tests. They noted that "with these components, the IR-TRACC worked without any problem, almost straight out of the box" [12]. To use the IR-TRACC in a typical European laboratory, it was suggested that it is necessary to limit the power consumption and output voltage. For example, they noted that the Kayser-Threde 3700 data acquisition system is only capable of 0.4 W output (10 V X 40 mA). That is one quarter of the power consumption of the first generation IR-TRACC system. The suggested minimum requirement for output voltage was a range of -5 to +5 V. • Output Signal - TNO also noted some other characteristics of the IR-TRACC that "require further attention" [12]. They observed artifacts of the sensor response that were thought to be a consequence of the mechanical design of the sensor. The artifacts consisted of peaks and dips of up to 2 mm in some output signals with a duration of about one millisecond (Figures 13a and 13b). They hypothesized that off-axis loading and mechanical effects by sensor sections reaching their end of range of motion might have caused these artifacts. Because the artifacts were localized and not global, the overall shape of the deformation signals were correct, and the maximum deformation measured with IR-TRACC matched that measured with the standard string potentiometer. It was concluded that the IR-TRACC could be used as it was. • Suggestions - Although TNO stated that the IR- TRACC worked well, they suggested that more detailed tests be carried out to examine the source of the artifacts in the signals. They noted that if the sensor data were to be processed further, for example to calculate the Viscous Criterion, then it would be necessary to limit velocity variations. This is because differentiation of signals with such artifacts to obtain velocity of the chest deformation typically results in signals with unacceptable amounts of noise in them (Figures 14a and 14b). They suggested that if the artifacts were caused by jamming of the segments due to off-axis loading or by friction between tube segments, then alternative materials should be considered for the construction of the telescoping rod. Some examples of possible materials to be used could be aluminum or engineering thermoplastics instead of steel. Likewise, since it is known that the tribological 316</page><page sequence="14">Figure 19. Velocity-Time in Hybrid III 6-year-old child dummy in GM out-of-position airbag tests properties of dry stainless steel on stainless steel are not good they suggested reduction of friction between moving parts by coating the surfaces. It was also observed that the telescoping rod segments are made of stainless steel and have to be accelerated when the chest is deformed. This implies that the sensor may influence the measurement being made. A reduction in mass would, therefore, be beneficial. OSRP Conclusions - • Durability - In the OSRP frontal and lateral OOP airbag tests with the Q3, peak compression data was lost due to the lack of durability of the Q3 string pot [11]. Similarly, the Hybrid III 3-year-old chest potentiometer popped out of the sternum track as a result of airbag loading and this resulted in a loss of data. In contrast, the IR- TRACC was found to be more durable except in one frontal OOP test in which the IR-TRACC mounting separated from the sternum. While it was recognized that the IR-TRACC was retrofit into the Q3 quickly and without design optimization, it was suggested that a more robust method of attaching the IR-TRACC to the sternum should be investigated. GESAC Conclusions - Although the data suggested that the IR-TRACC performed well, there were some considerations suggested before use of such a system in THOR [9], • Range of Motion - First, they observed that the range of motion required for the thorax and abdomen of THOR could not be met by the first generation versions of the IR-TRACC. This is because integration into THOR requires a telescoping rod assembly with a minimum range of 90mm. The first generation IR-TRACC was had a limited range of 55 mm. • Measurement Response - The IR-TRACC also showed some oscillations immediately after peak velocity, a region where the LMPT had a smooth response. They stated that the LMPT "appear(ed) to have a poorer initial response while the IR-TRACC system (had) slightly poorer response at peak velocity". 317</page><page sequence="15">Figure 20. V*C-T¡me in Hybrid III 6-year-old child dummy in GM out-of-position airbag tests • 3-D Data - They noted that for full 3-dlmensional data it would be necessary to integrate the IR- TRACC telescoping rod with the double gimbaled design and rotary potentiometers as in the DGSP designed by Schneider et al. [2]. • Finally, they observed that the IR-TRACC uses an onboard signal processing circuit before the signal is sent to a data acquisition system. The signal processor was believed to be a cause for concern only if the IR-TRACC was to be used with data acquisition systems built on board the dummy where space is limited and preventing instrument damage is important. Lear Tests - The data from the tests at Lear shows some of the issues associated with using double integration of accelerometers to measure displacement. In the pendulum tests with the Hybrid III 6-year-old dummy, 3 to 5 mm differences in peak deflection were observed between the IR-TRACC and the accelerometer methods (Figure 21). The accelerometer data showed anomalous curves in the latter portions of the deflection-time history. It is hypothesized that these anomalies were due to rotation of the sternum on which the accelerometers were mounted. Similarly, in the out-of-position airbag tests, the accelerometer curves were nearly completely anomalous. The deflection traces never returned to zero and appeared to continue increasing long after the airbag was inflated. The peak deflections according to the double integration of the accelerometers exceeded 80 mm, a physical impossibility in the 6-year-old child dummy. Much of this behavior is probably due to the rotation of the sternum and/or spine caused by the out- of-position airbag loading. Figure 21.

Velocity-Time in Hybrid III 6-year-old child dummy in I par frontal imnart thnrav ralihration tast SUMMARY OF FIRST GENERATION IR-TRACC RESULTS The Q3 tests all utilized the same prototype IR-TRACC system and all showed some localized artifacts in the form of peaks and valleys around the main curve. Since the artifacts were not global or periodic in nature, the cause was hypothesized to be mechanical in nature possibly due to mechanical coupling, vibration or binding caused by friction or off-axis loading of the telescoping rod. Overall, the datafrom the laboratories that tested the first generation IR-TRACC indicated that the IR-TRACC is an extremely linear device that is capable of measuring ATD chest deflection at speeds in excess of 19 m/s. The main issues noted consisted of suspected mechanically- induced signal artifacts, high power consumption, the Figure 24. Displacement-Time in Hybrid III 10-year-old child dummy from thorax calibration test Figure 23. Displacement-Time in Hybrid III 6-year-old child dummy in Lear out-of-position airbag tests physical size of the linearizing circuit and the need for longer telescoping rods for larger ATDs. SECOND GENERATION IR-TRACC Subsequent to the end of the GM/DOT program FTSS continued the development of the IR-TRACC. Forensic analysis of the first generation IR-TRACC used in the Q3 tests disclosed a soldering problem in the connection of one of the LEDs. It was believed that this could have caused intermittent contact problems that might have produced artifacts such as those observed in the round robin tests. A new method of soldering was devised to prevent cold-soldered connections. This method involved modifications to the seat of the LEDs within the rod ends and rerouting of the wires as they exit the rod. Figure 25. Displacement-Time data from WorldSID mid-thorax calibration test 319</page><page sequence="17">Figure 26. Displacement-Time and Angle-Time from Transport Canada full-vehicle THMPHR test on SUV D In addition to investigating the source of the artifacts, FTSS redesigned the linearizing circuit to reduce the power consumption and improve the signal to noise ratio by reducing the amount of amplification. The output gain was reduced by a factor of 100 and the power consumption and voltage were modified to enable use with modern data acquisition systems (Table IV). A side benefit of these modifications was a reduction in the physical size and weight of the new circuit. Whereas the first generation IR-TRACC had a separate circuit box that was 1.5" x 3.5" x 5", the second-generation circuit box was small enough to be mounted on the last segment of the telescoping rod (see Figure 1). The WorldSID design (Figure 4a) shows that the new design can be accommodated into a dummy with onboard data acquisition. This design has up to 224 channels of onboard data acquisition but still uses 6 IR-TRACCs distributed in the shoulder (1 unit), thorax (3 units) and abdomen (2 units). While the initial IR-TRACC design was proven out for a 6 year old child dummy, this further development has also allowed the design to transcend dummy size so that IR- TRACCs have now been made for the small child Figure 27. Dx-Dy data from THMPHR in Transport Canada full scale crash test on SUV D dummies, large child dummies and adult dummies. The specifications of the different IR-TRACCs are shown in Table IV. RESULTS OF THE SECOND GENERATION IR-TRACC TESTS The tests with THMPHR at Transport Canada have not shown any artifacts in the output signal. The THMPHR design also uses the double-gimbaling in conjunction with a rotary potentiometer for determination of the azimuth angle of the telescoping rod (lateral rotation). The original 6 year-old design was also double gimbaled and had provisions for rotary potentiometers, but they were not included with the systems in the round robin because analysis software had not been developed. As seen, the compactness of the second generation IR- TRACC allowed four systems to be built into a small female Hybrid III dummy thorax. The usefulness of the IR-TRACC with double-gimbaling has been shown in the Transport Canada tests in which precise 2-dimensional motion of the four connection points on the anterior thorax could be tracked.

All that is required is the addition of a second rotary potentiometer to measure elevation in addition to the azimuth that is already measured. This is not considered necessary in the Hybrid III dummies since vertical motion of the ribs is constrained by the rib guides. Other dummies such as THOR may need elevation measurements if there is significant vertical rib motion. FUTURE WORK While most of the concerns and issues identified in the round robin testing appear to have been addressed, some work remains to be done. First, the filters that are used with the IR-TRACC need to be carefully evaluated. It is possible that the requirement for CFC 600 filtering of thoracic deflection data specified in SAE J211 is unnecessary. A preliminary study of the IR-TRACC data indicates that an SAE equivalent filter of CFC 240 eliminates most apparent noisiness in IR-TRACC data allowing excellent differentiation results, but removing less than 1% of the signal. More analysis is required before this conclusion can be stated positively. In evaluating the biomechanical response of the Q3 dummy TNO noted that the response was essentially unchanged except for initial stiffness in the first 1-2 ms. With two IR-TRACCs such as in Hybrid III 10 year old there were slight differences in chest response (FTSS unpublished data) such that the10 year old response was at the upper limit of the force-deflection corridor. FTSS has examined several different possible modifications to lighten the sternal connection. One possible modification would be to make the sternum out of aluminum instead of Delrin. A second possibility would be to make the connections to the sternum out of aluminum instead of steel. These modifications have not yet been fully tested but initial results are promising. Based on the 10-year-old results, THMPHR response may be expected to be outside of the thoracic force- deflection corridor. It might be possible to compensate for the mass of the four telescoping rods by moving to lighter mass rods. However, the major contributing factor to any increase in force-deflection response is expected to be the sternal connection to the first segment of the rod since the other segments are only connected to the sternum after the first segment makes contact with them. This evaluation will continue if more multi-point systems appear to be desired. CONCLUSIONS The IR-TRACC has been evaluated at several laboratories in the US and Europe. While the accuracy and ability to capture high-speed data were considered acceptable, other issues were noted with the first generation systems. These issues included small artifacts in the deflection-time data, high power consumption of the circuits, the size of the linearizing circuit and the measurement range of the telescoping rod. The second generation IR-TRACC appears to have satisfactorily addressed all of these issues. The primary remaining issues are the filtering to be used with the IR- TRACC deflection data and the weight associated with multiple IR-TRACCs in a single dummy chest.
