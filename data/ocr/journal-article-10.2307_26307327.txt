PACIFIC COASTAL LAGUNA ZOPE A regional center in the Terminal Formative hinterlands of Monte Albán Robert N. Zeitlin Department of Anthropology, Brandéis University, Waltham, MA 02254, USA Abstract Recent excavations at Laguna Zope, on the southern Isthmus of Tehuantepec, provide interesting insights into the nature of a regional center in the hinterlands of Monte Albán. The excavation focused on an elite-status area of the site dating to the Terminal Formative period, a time when the Monte Albán polity in the highland Valley of Oaxaca was thought to have embarked on an imperialist campaign to turn former exchange partners into tribute-paying subjects. In contrast to the evidence from some other regions of Oaxaca, there was little to suggest that Laguna Zope was ever subjugated. On the contrary, exchange between Pacific coastal Laguna Zope and Monte Albán seems to have flourished during the Terminal Formative despite the political unrest that apparently interfered with commerce elsewhere in Oaxaca. In maintaining its political independence and resilience as a center for long-distance exchange during this troubled period, Laguna Zope may have capitalized on its relative distance from the Valley of Oaxaca and on a geographic location that afforded it strategic access to other markets. To overlook the ways in which a community interacts with the world beyond its regional borders is to dismiss variables that may account for local sociocultural change, structure, and be havior. A consideration of such extraregional variables had guided an earlier archaeological project at the Pacific coastal site of Laguna Zope (R. Zeitlin 1978) and remained central to a more recent investigation there. It is a principal objective of this paper to summarize the results of the latest study insofar as they help to define further Laguna Zope culture and society. Revealed by previous research, one suggestive phenomenon bearing on questions about the nature of Laguna Zope culture and society was a Late/Terminal Formative-period alteration in the local ceramic tradition. Specifically, this involved the introduction of a gray-ware style of pottery remarkably simi lar to that of Monte Albán, the developing center of civilization located some 200 km to the northwest in the highland Valley of Oaxaca. Undetermined was whether there were broader im plications to be drawn from the apparent Monte Albán influ ence on Laguna Zope's pottery making. It was hoped that the 1990 project could address this question by seeking material evidence of Monte Albán's impact, particularly its political sway, upon a far hinterland community toward which it looked for socioeconomic support. In effecting this task, it was further hoped that the research would contribute, however indirectly, to the growing literature on the character of the Monte Albán polity. BACKGROUND The Laguna Zope Settlement Predating the founding of Monte Albán by at least a thousand years, Laguna Zope is the oldest-known, although probably not the only, early Formative-period settlement on the southern Isthmus of Tehuantepec (Figure 1). At 1500 b.c. it was just one of what must have been hundreds of small villages along the Pacific littoral of lower Mesoamerica, where the inhabitants subsisted on the rich aquatic and terrestrial food resources of the coast and piedmont and, increasingly, by farming the fer tile, well-watered soils along the many small rivers and estuar ies (Ceja Tenorio 1985; Clark 1991; Coe 1961; Green and Lowe 1967; R. Zeitlin 1979). It was in this zone that some of Meso america's earliest chiefdoms may have evolved (Blake 1991). What is most distinctive about Laguna Zope is that it was the longest lived of any community on the southern Isthmus and, during almost all its Formative-period lifetime, the largest. By the Late Formative, evidence for a two-tiered regional settle ment hierarchy with Laguna Zope as the principal center is found, as are indications of social ranking, increasing elite con trol of prestige goods, and monumental construction activities, leading to the conclusion that a chiefdom level of sociopoliti cal organization had been attained (R. Zeitlin 1979). To some extent Laguna Zope appears to have achieved and 85</page><page sequence="2">86 Zeitlin Figure I. Map of the southern Isthmus of Tehuantepec, indicating location of Laguna Zope. maintained its preeminence by serving as a center for the pro curement and export of local goods and perhaps also for re gional administrative and ceremonial activities. How and why this all began may have been a matter of chance or individual initiative. Insofar as commercial activities came to play a role in the process, they would have been preconditioned by the ready availability of Pacific coastal ornamental seashell (and perhaps other highly valued indigenous exportables) and by the settlement's locational centrality at the junction of several interregional routes of transportation. Together these factors would have drawn the community into the network of long distance exchange that came to link much of Mesoamerica dur ing the Formative period (R. Zeitlin 1982). Within this exchange network, Laguna Zope was particularly well positioned. At the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, little more than 200 km separate the Gulf of Mexico in Veracruz from the Pacific maritime of Oaxaca, dictating that all land-based com merce between eastern and western Mesoamerica be funneled through this restricted passageway. The narrowness combined with a relatively gentle surface relief, also make the Isthmus the least-effort route of travel between Mesoamerica's Gulf and Pacific coasts. Lee Parsons (1969, 1978), referring to the geographically linked littoral regions on both sides of the Isthmus as the "Pe ripheral Coastal Lowlands," was first to recognize them as a culturally integrated, natural avenue for goods and ideas. Throughout prehistory, their importance to the smooth func tioning of interregional exchange as well as their abundance of indigenous resources has endowed settlements within this zone with economic and other cultural advantages, but has also put them at risk of incursion by outsiders intent on gaining control over their wealth and strategic location. By 500 B.C. Laguna Zope had grown to cover an area of almost 90 ha, many orders of magnitude more expansive than the next largest settlement on the southern Isthmus, and impres sive by any Mesoamerican standards of the time. Under assump tions used to calculate the size of other agricultural communities on the Pacific Coast of southern Mesoamerica (e.g., Clark 1991), a population of almost 2,000 can be estimated to have inhabited the settlement by the Late Formative period. The Southern Isthmus and the Valley of Oaxaca It has been proposed that between 500 and 200 b.c. the first state-level polity in Mesoamerica emerged in the highland Val ley of Oaxaca, adjacent to the Pacific coastal lowlands. The reasons for this extraordinary development, surely complex, are not yet fully agreed upon. Currently, the most plausible hypoth esis is that at some point during the Late Formative period the previously autonomous Zapotee chiefdoms of the valley elected to consolidate into a single polity that they might more effec tively exploit their military power while reducing intravalley rivalry (Flannery and Marcus 1983). As a result of that decision, it is believed that the urban center of Monte Albán was founded on a politically neutral valley hilltop as the "disembedded cap ital" of the newly formed confederation (Blanton 1976, 1983). The southern Isthmus of Tehuantepec may well have figured in Late/Terminal Formative-period Zapotee designs for hin</page><page sequence="3">Pacific coastal Laguna Zope 87 terland exploitation inasmuch as the region is known to have served the Valley of Oaxaca subsequently as an important source of sea salt, cotton, tropical fruits, dried shrimp, and other coastal lowland goods (Beals 1975; Eder 1976; Malinowski and de la Fuente 1957; Paso y Troncoso 1905), and is likely to have provided some or all of these products earlier on. Laguna Zope itself has been shown through previous archaeological investi gation to have been involved in the Formative-period procure ment of Spondylus, pearl oyster, and other marine shells that were employed as markers of status by an emerging elite class throughout much of Mesoamerica (R. Zeitlin 1979). Unworked shell and finished ornaments from Laguna Zope are thought to have reached the Valley of Oaxaca as early as 1500 b.c. (Flan nery and Schoenwetter 1970; Pires-Ferreira 1975). Its growth apparently stimulated by participation in the de veloping interregional network of exotic-commodity procure ment that integrated much of Mesoamerica, Laguna Zope thrived throughout the Formative period. In addition to serving as a pri mary source of exportable goods, it may also have assumed a "middleman" role in the movement of products between regions further to the southeast and those to the north and west. Ob sidian from quarry sites in highland Guatemala is one such com modity for which we have good evidence (R. Zeitlin 1982); of the many other, unfortunately perishable, exotic goods that might have passed through Laguna Zope from the southeast during the final centuries of the Formative period we could in clude cacao, cotton, jaguar pelts, and quetzal feathers. With its distant contacts and commercial relationships, Laguna Zope's lengthy period of occupation reflected the cul ture of the outside regions with which it interacted. By this I do not mean to portray the ancient inhabitants of the settlement as passive recipients of innovations developed elsewhere. On the contrary, the southern Isthmus was, as it remains to day, distinguished by a singularly well-defined regional culture. Outside influence on pottery making, for example, might best be described as an adjunct to a decidedly indigenous but cos mopolitan local tradition. During Mesoamerica's Early and Middle Formative peri ods, the Valley of Oaxaca does not seem to have exerted much influence on this local cultural tradition. Examined from the perspective of ceramic relationships, it would appear instead that Laguna Zope initially shared most actively in the culture of its neighbors along the Chiapas and Guatemalan coasts, and later in that of Maya-related peoples to the northeast (R. Zeit lin 1986). As noted above, however, around 200 B.C., just when the Zapotee inhabitants of the Valley of Oaxaca are thought to have been aggressively reaching out for distant sources of trib ute, some of the pottery of Laguna Zope develops a decided resemblance to the distinctive gray wares of Monte Albán. A similar adoption of the Monte Albán gray-ware style occurs further west on the Pacific Coast (see Joyce 1991a, 1993), as it does at numerous locations throughout the Oaxaca highlands. Indeed a Oaxaca gray-ware horizon could be defined, which roughly coincides with the extent of Late Formative-period cul tural interaction with Monte Albán. While it was the exceptionally rapid, geographically exten sive embrace of the Monte Albán gray-ware style that kindled my original interest in defining the precise form of relationship between the Valley of Oaxaca and its neighbor on the Pacific Isthmian coast, that concern was amplified by the recent debate over the character of the Late/Terminal Formative-period pol ity at Monte Albán (Blanton 1990; Flannery and Marcus 1983; Sanders and Nichols 1988; Santley 1980; R. Zeitlin 1990). If Monte Albán's relationship with its hinterlands had become one of a conquest state with its subjects, the consequences for places such as Laguna Zope would have been markedly different than if the interaction had merely involved peaceful exchange. Research Design Our strategy for research involved a limited excavation of what was likely to be an elite residential area at Laguna Zope. The working assumption was that in such a high-status area the probability of encountering evidence of Monte Albán's impact upon local culture would be greatest. Surely, if the highland Zapotee leaders had conquered and imposed their direct rule upon the southern Isthmus during the Terminal Formative pe riod, as is posited for the Cuicatlan Cañada and some other parts of Monte Albán's hinterlands (Drennan 1983; Feinman 1985; Feinman and Nicholas 1990; Flannery 1983; Markman 1981; Redmond 1983; Spencer 1982), these circumstances would have had their most profound impact upon the ranking mem bers of Laguna Zope's society and on the socioeconomic, po litical, and religious apparatus through which local authority was exercised. The most direct archaeological approach to ascer taining whether a turn of events similar to that at Cuicatlan had occurred on the southern Isthmus would, of course, be to re cover material evidence at Laguna Zope indicative of Zapotee conquest or Zapotec-imposed tributary status. As discussed below, a component of our 1990 research design specifically contemplated the possibility of such finds. THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE FOR CONQUEST Architectural Data In seeking archaeological evidence for Monte Albán conquest, evidence of large-scale destruction of elite residential and ad ministrative buildings comes immediately to mind, since an assault upon community leaders and the buildings associated with their authority would be a reasonable expectation under circumstances of outside invasion. Evidence of this kind can be deceiving, however, just as its absence does not negate the possibility that conquest had in fact occurred. Consider the pau city of material remains pertaining to the ethnohistorically doc umented Postclassic period of Aztec hegemony (e.g., Berdan 1982; Gibson 1971; Hassig 1988; Smith 1986; Voorhies 1989), a consequence of the Aztec policy of maintaining defeated local rulers in office. Furthermore, destruction of buildings, where evident, does not necessarily denote external hostility. Buildings may burn or be otherwise destroyed for a variety of reasons, intentional and accidental. Cultural practice, internal strife and catastrophic natural disaster are but several of the alternatives to be consid ered. Even where other possibilities can be ruled out, the ma terial record alone is often too imprecise to confirm the simultaneity of multiple instances of property destruction, as would be anticipated during conditions of warfare. As an indication of imperialist subjugation complementary to the razing of indigenous buildings, one could look for new or reconstructed houses in the preexisting elite area of the set</page><page sequence="4">88 Zeitlin tlement, or in a separate enclave, designed to the taste of the conquerors. At such locations substantial quantities of imported or locally produced household goods of the kinds preferred by the foreign occupants would be expected. Conquest and occu pation might also result in the appearance of functionally dif ferent kinds of buildings. Were the local elite allowed to retain a degree of political autonomy under newly resident rulers, an additional level of administration would result, perhaps distin guishable architecturally. On the other hand, should home rule have been quashed, a preexisting administrative hierarchy might collapse into a structure demonstrably simpler than before. Here again, there are alternatives that need to be weighed. The introduction of nonlocal building styles could simply reflect local emulation of a prestigious foreign culture, while endoge nous sociopolitical developments would account for an increas ing or decreasing number of architecturally distinguishable levels of administrative hierarchy. Even if the presence of foreigners was to be verified, conquest is not necessarily the interpretation. The Oaxaca barrio at Classic-period Teotihuacan, thought to have been occupied by Zapotee traders from Monte Albán (Mil Ion 1973), exemplifies the peaceful interjection of foreign culture into an otherwise indigenous community. Even the discovery of fortified foreign enclaves does not necessarily indicate conquest, as witnessed by modern-day embassy construction and the for eign military garrisons sometimes established by one nation to aid in the defense of another. Socioeconomic Change Another possible indicator of foreign conquest might be derived from evidence for social or economic change of no apparent benefit to the local population. In the absence of archaeologi cal confirmation of trade, for example, a shift from the produc tion of traditionally consumed products to a seemingly disproportionate quantity of high-value, low-bulk items bene ficial mainly for export would appear to signify an imposed economic change of this sort. Material manifestations of an ex ternally dictated export industry might be found in workshops and warehouses, perhaps associated with high-status foreign res idences. Social organizational changes brought about by the command economy might also be discernable. One obvious dan ger in this reasoning lies in concluding, on the basis of scant recovery of import items, that opportunities for trade, rather than coercion, were not responsible for the alteration in local production. Considering the perishable nature of many, if not most articles of commerce, it is likely that the extent of long distance exchange is nearly always underestimated archaeolog ically. Religious and Ceremonial Change Throughout ancient and modern history, radical alteration of religious custom has been imposed upon the vanquished by their conquerors. Normally, religious practices tend to resist rapid change, particularly where they reflect fundamental ideological values, as in household ritual and interment of the dead. In the case of Terminal Formative Laguna Zope, for example, the sud den appearance of high-status, stone-lined tombs and associated grave goods in the nonlocal Zapotee burial tradition would sug gest a forcefully imposed change in religious custom, perhaps concomitant with the displacement of the ruling segment of south Isthmian society. Tombs of this kind have, in fact, been reported on the southern Isthmus (Maler 1942; J. Zeitlin 1978), but are attributable to a much later time period, that of the Postclassic Zapotee conquest of the region (Burgoa 1934). Were similar tombs to be found dating to the Late/Terminal Forma tive, additional documentation would be needed to discount the possibility that they were the burial places of foreign visitors or immigrants. Osteological Evidence Physical trauma associated with warfare is commonly visible on skeletal remains. A possible technique for verifying the presence of an invading population is also available through stable iso tope analysis of bone (Schwarcz and Schoeninger 1991; Sealy and van der Merwe 1992). The procedure is based upon the detection of carbon- and nitrogen-isotope ratios in the bone collagen of suspected foreigners that vary from those of local individuals. These disparities may reflect long-term dietary dif ferences between peoples from dissimilar environmental areas, coastal versus highland in this case. We are currently exploring the feasibility of stable isotope analysis using the fragmentary human bone remains recovered during this and earlier excava tions at Laguna Zope. Sudden changes of diet in some or all households, as discerned through the analysis of preserved food remains and pollen recovered from domestic contexts, might be employed to further verify the presence of foreigners. The recognition of traumatic injury or the intrusion of non local peoples into a region does not, in itself, indicate conquest. Injuries, detected osteologically, could be related to internal in surrection or even to religious sacrifice. The existence of foreign trade enclaves and immigrant colonies, mentioned previously, could account for the long-term presence of nonlocal popula tions. Ultimately, it must be recognized that without written records, archaeological arguments for political conquest and forceful exploitation of hinterland regions are stubbornly dif ficult to substantiate. Where conquest did in fact occur, defeat may have been imposed more by threat than by actual force, with little or no territorial occupation by the victors that might leave evidence to indicate what had transpired. It is not the intent of the foregoing to deny that a reason able case for conquest can be made where a number of lines of evidence for external conflict and subjugation indicate an alteration in local culture so abrupt and pervasive as to be in explicable in terms of internal dynamics. Indeed, such an inter pretation was advanced for a Late/Terminal Formative Monte Albán takeover of the Cuicatlan Cañada in highland Oaxaca (Redmond 1983; Spencer 1982), although even in that well argued example, alternative interpretations of the data may be possible (R. Zeitlin 1983). It was with these caveats that the 1990 excavations at Laguna Zope were undertaken. THE LAGUNA ZOPE ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE IN CONTEXT Maintaining even in ruin a position of centrality, Laguna Zope lies astride the Pan American Highway, 2 km west of Juchitan, its bustling, modern-day successor as the south Isthmian hub for long-distance commerce. Following pre-Columbian and colo</page><page sequence="5">Pacific coastal Laguna Zope 89 nial routes of travel for much of its length, the Pan American Highway (Carretera Cristóbal Colón) is the main thoroughfare to the coastal lowlands from the highland Valley of Oaxaca (Figure 2; Ball and Brockington 1978). Winding in an easterly direction, it leads beyond Laguna Zope, to Tuxtla Gutiérrez, the current Chiapas state capital and longstanding center of com merce in the Central Depression of the Sierra Madre de Chiapas. On the eastern edge of the southern Isthmus, the Pacific Coastal Highway (Ruta Pacífico), another roadway with a pre-Colum bian heritage (Navarrete 1973), branches off in a southeasterly direction, towards the hot, humid Soconusco region, a source of exotic plant and animal products. Running north, not far from Laguna Zope, paralleling a route known to Cortéz (Moor head 1949), the Transisthmian Highway (Carretera Transist mica) brings the Gulf Coast into this enduring communication network. We do not know what Laguna Zope was called at the time it was occupied. The name by which it is known today refers to the vultures (zope/zopilote) that often linger about the several small ponds in and around the main area of ancient habitation. Less than a kilometer east of the site is the Río de los Perros, an important source of fresh water for the semiarid coastal plain. The river discharges about 10 km downstream into the Laguna Superior, the innermost of a system of broad, shallow embayments separated by barrier beaches from the open Pa cific. Marine and alluvial sedimentation may have moved the modern coastline somewhat further away from Laguna Zope than it was 2,000 years ago, although even now inhabitants of nearby Juchitan walk to the coast to fish and to collect shrimp. The zone of occupation at Laguna Zope centered around three large earthen mounds, the tallest of which, Mound III, rises 9 m above the otherwise almost featureless coastal plain (Figure 3). While the mound summits served to elevate high status residential and perhaps civil/religious structures above the rest of the settlement, the broad, gently sloping extensions of the mound bases suggest an attempt to raise other habitations above the threat of seasonal flooding. Beyond the central zone, the numerous remains of small, low housemounds mark the nonelite residential areas of the settlement. Since the time of our 1972 excavations at Laguna Zope, com mercial earth-moving activities have destroyed much of the northern part of the archaeological zone, resulting in the almost complete eradication of Mound II. As a final indignity, the area of earth removal is being used as a landfill for garbage from the Juchitan municipality. Still intact, Mound III was selected for excavation. Its height and position at the very heart of the set tlement led us to speculate that it had served as the locus of com munity administration or as the residential site for a most Figure 2.

Topographic map of Laguna Zope. important family, perhaps that of Laguna Zope's rulers them selves. SYNOPSIS OF THE 1990 EXCAVATIONS Eight weeks of excavation between March and May 1990 were concentrated on the north-facing slope of Mound III, just be low the summit. Working with a small crew, we were able to ex pose some 64 m2 of surface to a depth of approximately 2 m, effectively restricting our investigation to occupational levels dating to the Terminal Formative period, roughly between 200 B.C. and a.d. 300 (Figure 4). In all we recovered over 27,000 sherds from ceramic vessels, 102 clay figurine fragments, 537 lithic artifacts (including 122 obsidian flakes and blades, 380 other flaked-stone tools, and 35 ground-stone specimens), along with substantial quantities of shell and animal bone, and lesser numbers of plant seeds. Mound III and Associated Features Excavation verified that Mound III, like many similar-appearing constructions throughout Formative-period Mesoamerica, was a culturally stratified accretion, built up over a lengthy period of time in much the same manner as a small Near Eastern tell. Several occupational components were found, each consisting of a series of packed-earth floors, some with a poor-quality, lime-plaster surface. Fragments of heavier, better-finished plas ter floors were recovered in excavation fill, but their original provenience was uncertain. The fact that higher-quality plas ter floors predate those of the Terminal Formative period is of interest. Thin, laminar layers of river sand and small pebbles were often found interspersed between successive floor levels, prob ably indicative of past efforts at refurbishing or improving floor surfaces (Figure 5). Much thicker layers of dirt-and-rubble fill separate the several stratigraphic series of floors. The fill, which contains Early, Middle, and Late Formative-period pottery, was apparently brought in from surrounding zones of the site on a number of occasions to augment the size of the mound and to create new platform surfaces for building construction. Aside from the fragmentary evidence of better-made earlier house floors, there were no changes in architecture or construction technique detected in the various levels of the occupational se quence that would suggest the intrusion of a new cultural group. The superstructures of the buildings that originally stood on the mound were typically of wattle and daub, a form of con struction characteristic of buildings on the southern Isthmus throughout the pre-Columbian era. Numerous fragments of burnt daub with cane impressions were found in and around the houses, indicating that vertical support posts and interlaced wattle ranged from 1.25 cm to over 8 cm in diameter (Figure 6). On some of the daub remnants, intact pieces of wood were still attached to the clay. The daub reveals that parts of the wall interiors and exteriors were whitewashed with a thin slurry of lime, sand, and small pebbles.</page><page sequence="7">Pacific coastal Laguna Zope N21W1 0 12 3 ■ ■ i 1 meters N11E1 N10E2 N0W1 Feature' L ash filled pit Figure 4. Plan view of area of Mound II! excavated in 1990. Perhaps indicative of its high status, one of the excavated buildings had its east wall built out of solid clay or adobe brick (poor preservation did not allow us to distinguish which), ap proximately 37 cm in thickness up to a height of about 80 cm. The apparent absence of postholes along the flat top surface of this wall leads us to suspect that the area above may have been a window opening of some sort. In what is perhaps the settle ment's principal residential compound, at the very summit of Mound III, limestone rocks had been brought in from the ad jacent piedmont for use in constructing a house foundation or terrace retaining wall (Figure 7). The use of stone in high status building construction was common at this time through out Mesoamerica. Several instances were detected where heavy aggregations of fired daub suggested burning of an intact structure. One par ticularly eye-catching example from the upper levels of our ex cavation, dating from a time near the abandonment of the site, involved large amounts of burnt daub fragments collapsed in heaps on top of a floor surface, along with an abundance of ash and other carbonized material. The signs of burning evident from the house remains were what might have been expected had there been a conflagration related to conquest. Analysis of the vertical distribution of burnt daub throughout the entire excavated area, however, revealed no stratigraphic concentra tions that would denote massive destruction during a single event, as would have occurred if the settlement had been razed in the course of an outside attack. Burial Remains Human skeletal remains were found in association with all ex cavation levels on Mound III. The bones, too fragmentary to allow identification of burial position or sex, were located ei ther beneath house floors or outside the buildings in what was probably a courtyard area. Simple pits, lacking stone linings or any kind of crypt, were the repository for the individuals. One burial, however, was capped with an uninscribed, stelalike lime stone slab, set in an upright position. Zapotec-style hieroglyphic writing, originating in the Valley of Oaxaca as early as 600 500 B.C. on stelae and other stone monuments (Marcus 1976), spread to various regions of the Oaxaca highlands and the Mix teca Baja, but not to the southern Isthmus during the Forma tive or Classic periods, further indicating the limited extent of Monte Albán cultural intrusion into the region. The Terminal Formative Mound III interments contrast with a custom of urn burials encountered in previous excavations at Laguna Zope. I can only speculate at this point whether the two contemporaneous modes of burial reflect status difference or some other factor. Regardless, neither bears any particular like ness to elite Zapotee burials at Monte Albán or elsewhere in the Valley of Oaxaca during the same time period. All the burials on the mound, both inside and outside the ex cavated houses, were accompanied by substantial quantities of grave goods, consisting mainly of fancy pottery, unworked shell and shell ornaments, obsidian blades, blade fragments and flakes, and animal remains. The most common ceramic wares were a Monte Albán-style silty-paste gray and a glossy-surfaced differentially fired black-and-white, both locally produced. Pre vious ceramic analysis reveals that these two wares occur throughout the site in roughly equal proportions during the period extending from about 200 b.c. to a.d. 300. One Silty-Gray bridge-spout animal-effigy vessel (Figure 8), located at what would have been the head of the deceased in a lower-level burial, is an almost identical, south-Isthmian copy of a specimen attributed by Caso et al. (1967:Figure 90) to Late Formative Period I at Monte Albán. Similar monkey-face vessels are illustrated as burial offerings accompanying high ranking individuals at other settlements of that period in the Valley of Oaxaca (e.g., Whalen 1981:102, Figure 49-6). These and other forms of bridge-spout effigy vessels were apparently produced throughout the valley between 300 and 100 b.c. The occurrence of gray-ware bridge-spout effigy vessels at Laguna Zope might be attributed to the adoption of Valley Za potee funerary customs, except that comparable ceramic forms are widely distributed in southern Mesoamerica, far beyond the Monte Albán interaction sphere, where they have a long history as burial goods (e.g., Agrinier 1975:Figure 38-2; Lowe 1962:Fig ure 7). Moreover, absent in the Terminal Formative ceramic</page><page sequence="8">92 Zeitlin Figure 5. Mound III excavation profile showing (a) floor layers; (b) detail of profile.</page><page sequence="9">Pacific coastal Laguna Zope 93 Figure 6. Fragment of burnt daub showing cane marks. complex at Laguna Zope are the characteristic Zapotee effigy braziers and funerary urns (Flannery et al. 1981 .'Figure 3-30; Marcus 1983). These vessels, which typically depict nobility or royal ancestors, might have been expected at Laguna Zope had the elite area of the settlement housed Zapotee overlords from the Valley of Oaxaca. They do appear on the southern Isthmus much later in time (Wallrath 1967:Figure 73a), between a.d. 500 and 750, during the Late Classic epoch known in the Valley of Oaxaca as Period IIIB, when the Monte Albán state had reached its greatest and final period of development. Arguing further for continued autonomy in burial practice at Laguna Zope was the recovery of a particularly fine "vase" in the local tradition of differentially fired black-and-white pottery. The vessel is decorated with a gadrooned base and an intricately incised design on its neck (Figure 9). Although dif ferentially fired black-and-white was one of the most widely distributed indigenous wares on the southern Isthmus during the Terminal Formative period, the outstanding craftsmanship invested in this piece corroborates its high-status provenience. Elsewhere at Laguna Zope differentially fired black-and-white pottery was a mass-produced commodity, manufactured in a limited number of simple, standardized forms, rarely exhibit ing plastic decoration. A wide assortment of animal remains accompanies the Mound III burials. Pending the completion of a comprehensive faunal analysis, we have tentatively identified deer, dog, jaguar, peccary, snake, iguana, turtle, a number of bird species, shark, and various fish. Shells from both ornamental and edible spe cies are also abundant. Some of the ornamental seashell had been fashioned into pendants and other decorative artifacts, although most was unworked. Shells from edible mussels and clams are commonly found in ashy areas on the mound, but like the animal bones, they show few signs of burning. They were probably cooked in some Figure 7. Photograph of limestone building foundation.</page><page sequence="10">94 Zeitlin Figure 8. Gray-ware effigy vessel associated with Feature ] burial. of the ceramic vessels whose broken remains were found in the ash. Along with the other animals represented in our collection, these shellfish were probably used for food or as ceremonial offerings. As might be expected, seafood is known to have been an important component in the diet of coastal Laguna Zope's inhabitants from Early Formative times onward (R. Zeitlin 1979). Along with copious quantites of utilitarian pottery, the recovery in our excavation of common utensils for food pro cessing and cooking —mano, metate, and comal fragments — indicates a traditional domestic component to activities on the mound summit. Structures C and R Near the top of the mound, the 1990 excavations ultimately hit upon the relatively well-preserved remains of a pair of as sociated buildings, designated features "C" and "R" (Figure 4), equivalent in age to Late Monte Albán Period I/Early Period II. Time and financial constraints prevented us from exposing either of these structures completely, but enough area within and around them was uncovered to give us a sense of their prob able function. Feature C, the northernmost of the two buildings, was shown to be quite large, over 12.5 m in length (Figure 10). Its total width was never fully revealed by our excavations, but it Figure 9. Incised black-and-white "vase."</page><page sequence="11">Pacific coastal Laguna Zope 95 Figure 10. Feature C, house foundation. Note uninscribed stela at left center. is unlikely that a wattle-and-daub house of that length would be narrower than 4 m, resulting in a total floor area of at least 50 m2. Minimally, this would make the building about equal in size to the largest structure at La Coyotera in the Cuicatlan Cañada —a structure described as the "chief's house"—at a time just prior to the region's reported conquest by Monte Albán (Spencer and Redmond 1983); likewise, it would be as large or larger than Formative-period elite houses in the coastal Oaxaca Rio Verde region (Joyce 1991b). The Feature C house was probably connected by way of a courtyard to the other known building near the summit of the mound. Without further excavation we cannot say whether there were additional structures in this complex or if the court yard was open on two sides. Within the house, there are indi cations of at least one interior wall partition. Both Feature C and the other partially excavated building on the mound, Fea ture R, are oriented at 340° M., an alignment almost identical to that of the pre-Conquest "chiefly" residential complex at La Coyotera (Spencer 1982) but differing from Formative pe riod Rio Verde structures (Joyce 1991b) and from Monte Albán I/II buildings in the Valley of Oaxaca (Blanton 1978). The artifacts and features found in and around the two buildings support the hypothesis that they were part of a resi dential compound belonging to indigenous high-status individ uals. A primarily residential (vs. ceremonial or administrative) function of the buildings is inferred from the modest number of burials (probably limited to household members), the food preparation artifacts and food remains, and the several adjacent outdoor hearths. High status is affirmed not only by the cen tral mound location of the buildings and the quality of goods accompanying the associated burials, but by the relative abun dance of precious, nonlocal obsidian. A 1:36 ratio of obsidian to pottery in and around the houses, compared to the 1:59 mean ratio of the same two materials from other locations at the site, suggests that the Terminal Formative occupants of Mound III had greater access to this valued commodity than their cohorts elsewhere in the community.1 Overall, I feel increasingly com fortable with my original conjecture that Mound III may have been, for the Terminal Formative period if not earlier, the res idence of Laguna Zope's leading family. The location of the local chief's household on Mound III would not have precluded the conduct of administrative and ceremonial activities in the same area. Feature L, an ash-filled pit abutting the western edge of the southernmost excavated building on the mound, was minimally 1 x 2 m in area and 95-cm deep. The great quantity of burnt wood contained within this pit evidences a lengthy period of use. The massive size of the pit suggests that it could have served for cooking on a scale much larger than that required for the occupants of an extended family residential compound, perhaps for ceremonial feasting. Inside the buildings, the existence of fragmentary human bone remains reveals that, in addition to courtyard burials, some high-status individuals may have been formally interred beneath the house floors. Similar subfloor burials are found in the Valley of Oaxaca, but they are commonplace in other parts of Mesoamerica as well, and thus cannot serve as an indicator of Monte Albán intrusion. In the floor of the southernmost house on Mound III, a shal low, hearthlike concavity, lined with burnt soil, ash, small stones, and broken pottery, was overlain by a large sea-turtle carapace. Some nearby human teeth and bone fragments, infant and adult, suggest a burial associated with the turtle. The still articulated skulls and mandibles of several dogs, teeth from a large feline, ornamental shell, a number of fine gray-ware ves sels, a large, incised gray-ware ceramic disk, and a cache of red hematite pigment are among the other remains associated with these probable interments that would affirm their high status. The discovery of an infant burial with such opulent goods could be interpreted as indicating an ascribed, versus achieved, elite status for the child, a situation characteristic of ranked society. A greenstone celt (hacha), recovered near a possible subfloor burial in the Feature C house is similar to, although consider ably later in time than, a find made nearby on the Pacific Coast in Soconusco, there interpreted as a dedicatory offering (Blake 1991). Not far from the location of the Laguna Zope celt, a 6-7-cm deep, 56-cm-diameter circular depression in the floor was found lined with small river-worn rocks and pebbles. In the absence of ash or other evidence for cooking, some high quality gray ware pottery fragments and a single shell found 1 Ratios of obsidian to pottery or shell to pottery based on materi als recovered from Mound III can only be taken as rough approxima tions since some of the material may be derived from fill. If anything, however, this computational defect understates the density of obsidian and shell on the mound.</page><page sequence="12">96 Zeitlin inside the depression might suggest that it was part of a now destroyed altar complex of some sort. Overall, with the possi ble exception of the Monte Albán-style Silty-Gray pottery, there is nothing about any of the Mound III artifacts or features in consistent with the preexisting local cultural tradition. Ceramic Figurines Further evidence of cultural continuity and lack of imposed outside change on the southern Isthmus comes from the 102 anthropomorphic figurine fragments recovered in the Mound III excavations. The Laguna Zope figurines, while presumably serving a household religious or ceremonial function, are also of interest for the glimpse they give of a distinctive regional mode of dress and body decoration, apparently little altered during the 400 or so years of the Terminal Formative period. Disarticulated heads from what are mostly female figurines indicate an uplifted hairdo or headdress, accentuating an appar ent fancy for cranial elongation (Figure 11). A decorative rib bon or turban, tied at the rear, encircles the forehead, with attached bangles sometimes extending down the front and back. Behind the head, hair was worn long, often in two strands or braids extending below the shoulders. Tubular ear spools were standard accessories, sometimes complemented by pendant ear rings. Small nose plugs also appear to be common. The front teeth were usually decorated with inlays of some material. Women, almost always depicted standing upright, wore one to three fancy necklace strands of what were probably ceramic beads or seashells. Aside from their ornamentation, they wore nothing above the waist; typically revealed are a prominent belly, large navel, and full breasts (Figure 12). A saronglike skirt, perhaps of animal skin, was the major article of clothing, held in place with a strap drawn between the legs. A tote bag was often worn on the hip. Feet are shown either bare or in sandals. A much smaller sample of male specimens indicates greater simplicity in attire and adornment, although the difference in both the number of figurines and their ornamentation could be related to their possible religious function. No definite male heads were recovered, but neck and body fragments disclose that, like the women, they grew their hair long, sometimes gath ered into a kind of ponytail. Men also occasionally wore shell or bead necklaces. A decorative band was commonly worn on an upper arm (Figure 13), and occasionally on both arms (see Wallrath 1967:Figure 67g). The pouch or tassel sometimes at tached to the band may have served a utilitarian purpose or could conceivably have been a symbol of status. The sole arti cle of clothing was a small loin cloth. Unlike the typically upright female figurines, men are almost always portrayed in a squatting or seated position (Figure 14). Compared to the rendering of apparel and decoration on Ter minal Formative period monuments and figurines from the Valley of Oaxaca (e.g., Caso and Bernal 1965; Whalen 1981), there is little about the Laguna Zope Mound III figurine collec tion to suggest highland Zapotee influence on south-Isthmian modes of dress or personal adornment. Ornamental Seashell The shell finery depicted on some of the Laguna Zope figurines is especially noteworthy because it corresponds to the abundance of actual ornamental marine bivalves and gastropods found on Mound III in the course of the 1990 excavations (Figures 15 and 16). The discovery of so much shell resolves an enigma that had grown out of my previous fieldwork at the site. Figure 11.

At the time I was puzzled by what appeared to be a precipi tous Terminal Formative period decline in the amount of orna mental shell collected by the inhabitants of Laguna Zope. The collapse of the local shell industry inferred from these data seemed singularly peculiar because it would have occurred just when demand from the Valley of Oaxaca, and probably other places as well, was escalating (R. Zeitlin 1978, 1979). The mys tery now may be resolved, since it turns out that the observed decline in shell procurement at Laguna Zope was simply an ab erration resulting from the original sampling design, which avoided the elite, Mound III area of the site. The amount of ornamental shell recovered in the course of the Mound III excavation produces a ratio of one specimen to 24 pottery rimsherds and decorated body sherds —roughly equivalent to the ratio at off-mound areas of the site dating to earlier phases of the Formative period. It is now apparent that shell collection continued into the Terminal Formative at Laguna Zope, but was restricted to certain locations, of which Mound III is the only one we are aware of at this point in our investigation. It may be that with the Late/Terminal Formative period elevation of Laguna Zope's sociopolitical system to that of a chiefdom, shell collection and distribution came to be re served for the highest-ranking members of the society, those who resided on Mound III and perhaps other, as yet unex plored, elite-status areas of the settlement. I am uncertain whether the total amount of shell collected</page><page sequence="14">98 Zeitlin 0 25mm L i i i i i Figure 14. Terminal Formative figurine from Laguna Zope: side and front views of a seated male. Figure 15. Ornamental shell from Mound III, Laguna Zope. by the inhabitants of Laguna Zope during the Terminal Forma tive period was as large as or larger than in previous periods. The limited 1990 Mound III excavations concentrated on a res idential compound where we did not encounter any workshops. Nevertheless the abundance of ornamental shell in the mound area indicates that its collection and probable exchange con tinued to be of importance to at least the elite members of the community. In reconstructing the network of long-distance exchange, it may be more than a coincidence that much of the ornamental shell collected by the Mound III occupants of Laguna Zope is the same as that found at the highland Oaxaca site of Ejutla. Of the 19 most common species recovered by Feinman and Nicholas in their recent Ejutla excavations, Pinctada, Chama, Spondylus, Ostrea, Pitar, Anadara, Glycymeris, Trachycardium, Luciría, Strombus, Oliva, Olive/la, and Marginella were also found in coeval strata at Laguna Zope. Feinman and Nicholas (1990, 1993) have suggested that Monte Albán, after incorpo rating Ejutla into the Zapotee polity during the Terminal For mative, may have placed the settlement in the position of a "gateway" for Pacific coastal products, most significantly ma rine shell, entering the Valley of Oaxaca. Laguna Zope may well have been a major source, if not the principal supplier, of Pacific coast shell to the Valley of Oaxaca through this gateway. IMPLICATIONS FOR TERMINAL FORMATIVE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN LAGUNA ZOPE AND MONTE ALBAN Aside from a more complete understanding of Terminal Forma tive-period lifeways on the southern Isthmus, what are the</page><page sequence="15">Pacific coastal Laguna Zope 99 Figure 16. Shell blanks and finished ornaments from Mound III, Laguna Zope. broader implications to be drawn from the 1990 Laguna Zope excavations? Most importantly, perhaps, the study leads to the conclusion that Laguna Zope retained its political autonomy throughout the entire Formative period. At the same time the south-Isthmian center apparently continued to function as an exchange partner with the Valley of Oaxaca. While Monte Albán, perhaps through Ejutla, seems to have maintained its exchange relationship with Laguna Zope during the Terminal Formative, the nature of Valley Zapotee associa tion with other hinterland sources of supply was altering radi cally. In the case of the Cuicatlan Cañada, an observed curtailment of exchange has been explained by Monte Albán conquest of the region, as a consequence of which the Zapotee polity was able to exact tribute where trade had previously served for obtaining the exotic agricultural products of the tierra caliente (Redmond 1983; Spencer 1982). Along the lower Rio Verde, previous commerce with the Val ley of Oaxaca was also interrupted, cutting off that Pacific coastal region's access to obsidian, imported Monte Albán pot tery, and perhaps other desired highland goods. In contrast to what may have transpired in the Cuicatlan Cañada, however, the cessation of exchange with Monte Albán does not seem to have been related to an armed invasion and occupation of the region. For the lower Rio Verde, and perhaps other outlying regions, the Valley Zapotee may have devised a less costly means of reducing former exchange partners to tributary status. Dis ruption of commerce through an embargo on the flow of goods would have been a potent weapon of extortion when applied against communities whose location at the terminus of an ex change link put them in a position of dependency upon Monte Albán for their principal access to greater Mesoamerica (Zeit lin and Joyce 1992). Other Oaxaca polities, most notably those associated with the large urban centers of the Mixteca Alta (Spores 1983), may have avoided the imperialist designs of the Valley of Oaxaca Zapotee by mere virtue of their size and strength. Monte Albán, with limited military resources, would no doubt have been loath to take on such potentially formidable adversaries. Laguna Zope, on the southern Isthmus, may exemplify yet another category of interaction with Monte Albán. With its geographically endowed access to multiple sources of foreign commodity supply, with alternate markets to which it could ex port its own products, and with the security afforded by some what greater distance from the Valley of Oaxaca, the region would have been relatively impervious to Zapotee militarism or economic pressure. As a result, Laguna Zope appears to have prospered throughout the Terminal Formative, perhaps even profiting from the political unrest that disrupted commerce in other parts of the Oaxaca interaction sphere. As for Monte Albán, the picture that is emerging is of a pragmatic polity meeting its expanding demand for foreign goods through a variety of strategies, ranging from amicable trade — as was expedient in its relationship with Laguna Zope — to economic coercion and, probably as a last resort, forceful subjugation. This eclectic pattern of core-hinterland interaction, better known in Mesoamerica from the Late Postclassic period of Aztec hegemony, is typical of state-level polities whose in terest centers less on an expanding rule over territory than on the extraction of wealth, by tribute or otherwise. RESUMEN Las últimas excavaciones en Laguna Zope, ubicadas en el sur del istmo de Tehuantepec, proporcionan información interesante en cuanto al carácter de un centro regional de la periferia de Monte Albán. Las ex cavaciones se concentraron en una zona de nivel social élite perteneciente al período formativo terminal. Durante este período se considera que el gobierno de Monte Albán empezó una campaña imperialista para convertir a sus socios comerciales en sujetos tributarios. La evidencia, sin embargo, no indica la subyugación de Laguna Zope por Monte Albán. Al contrario, el intercambio entre este centro de la costa del Pacífico y su poderoso socio del valle de Oaxaca parece haber florecido, no obstante el desorden político que impidió el comercio en otras partes de Oaxaca. Es posible que Laguna Zope se aprovechó de su relativa lejanía del valle de Oaxaca y de su ubicación geográfica, para mantener un acceso estratégico a otros mercados y su independencia política como un centro para el intercambio interregional. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The 1990 excavations on Mound III, Laguna Zope, drew upon support from the National Science Foundation through Grant BNS 89-18824. At the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (INAH) we are also most grateful to the officials then in office, Prof. Roberto Garcia Moll, director; Prof. Angel Garcia Cook, director of archaeology; and par ticularly to Arqlga. Lorena Mirambell Silva, president of the Consejo de Arqueología, for their interest in the project as well as for their con siderate and efficient processing of our fieldwork permit application. In Oaxaca, Arqlgo. Ernesto González Licón, who was director of the Centro Regional de Oaxaca, INAH, graciously provided assistance when needed. Dr. Marcus Winter, at the Oaxaca INAH Regional Center, was most generous throughout the entire course of the project with his sup port and advice. To the people of Juchitan go our enduring affection and appreciation for the many kindnesses that made our stay on the tor rid Isthmus as enjoyable as it was productive. In this regard we owe spe cial thanks to the families of Manuel Nicolás and Arturo and Teresa</page><page sequence="16">100 Zeitlin Orozco, whom we have now known for over 20 years, and to Prof. Nor berto Villalobos Sánchez and Sr. Emelio Martínez López who graciously allowed us to excavate on their properties. Our outstanding crew of Za potee excavators made fieldwork a daily entertainment. They were most ably supervised by graduate students Marilyn Masson from the Univer sity of Texas, Austin, who was also responsible for a preliminary sort ing and identification of the animal bones, and Jorge Moto Chávez of the Escuela Nacional de Antropología e Historia who, in addition to his fieldwork responsibilities, worked on a first visual sorting of the lithic artifacts. Stephanie Noah is acknowledged for her excellent figurine il lustrations; Figures 2-4 were drafted by John Cotter. Finally, I an greatly indebted to Bill Fowler and Steve Houston, co-editors of An cient Mesoamerica, as well as to the several manuscript reviewers for the publication, and to Joyce Marcus, Kent Flannery, Art Joyce, and Judy Zeitlin for their many helpful comments on and corrections to an earlier draft of this article.
