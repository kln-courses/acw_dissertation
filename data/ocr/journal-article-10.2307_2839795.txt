(1) Nothing could be more satisfactory than the Judaism of Mr. Abrahams, who, himself a Jew, handles the subject not only with competent knowledge, as might be * Portuguese chroniclers record that the king of the Mazimba, a cannibal tribe that devastated the north bank of the Zambesi in 1592, did not eat human flesh in order "to be different from his ;ubjects."

Such an attitude, not of indifference, for the personal element may. still be read between the lines, but of philosophic impartiality, was possible only for a thoughtful student capable of standing outside his subject and contemnplating it from an absolutely objective standpoint. How rare such cases are may be inferred from the statement often made that Thucydides is the one impartial historian ! One is almost tempted to add, and Mr. Abrahams is the one impartial religious writer! At any rate this unbiassed spirit carries him far enough to " admit that Islam has absorbed " and purified the Jewish Molnotheism. Islain h.as certainly a pure creed ; it freed " itself from the entanglements of anthropomorphic metaphors and conceptions of God, which are apparent iii the early strata of the Hebrew Bible, and from which Judaism, because of its reverence for the Bible, has not emancipated itself yet." The reader feels that he is safe in the hands of a guide who can write thus when he comes to deal with the later phases of the subject, and it is the later phases that are mainly discussed in this ideal monograph. Its starting point is taken, not at any pre- or post-exilic period, nor even at the capture of Jerusalem by Titus, but at its last capture and destruction by Adrian after the suppression of the revolt headed by Bar-Kokhba about A.D. 134-5. It was then that the Jews ceased to be a nation, and, while preserving a large measure of racial parity, sank to the position of a religious sect dispersed in small isolated communities over a great part of the known world. Hence the author is here concerned, not with the origin and evolution of Judaism through the early stages of animism, totemism, and polydemonism, to monolatry or henotheism and pure monotheism, but with the legacy bequeathed to it from the past, a legacy which is a real syncretism of most diverse heterogeneous elements. Herein lies the special merit of this essay, which shows in luminous language that in the present Judaism nothing is forgotten, all the old crudities and traditions are reverently preserved and merged in an incoherent system essentially illogical, inconsistent, and full even of contradictions. " God, in the early literature a tribal non-moral deity, " was in the later literature a righteous ruler," and " Judaism took over as one " individual body of sacred teachinigs both the early and the later literature in which " these varying conceptions of God were enshrinied. Judaism, in short, included for " the Jew all that had gone before." Hence " in the Jewish theology of all ages we " find the most obvious contradictions. There was no attempt at reconciliation of such contradictions. They were juxtaposed in a mechanical mixture, there was no chemical compound. . . The Jew transferred the changelessness of God to men's changing ideas about him. With childlike naivete he accepted all, he adopted all, and he syncretised it all as best he could into the loose system in which Pharisaism grafted itself. The legacy of the past thus was the past." The whole essay is but a lucid exposition of these axiomatic truths. (2) The obscure subject of the Japanese national religion, commonly called Shinto, could not have been placed in better hands than those of Dr. Aston, whose whole life has been lived mainly in a Japanese environment. In dealing with Shinto as a whole he shows clearly that, despite its Chinese name (Ch. Shinto = Jap. Kami no Michi = " Way of the Gods "), it has no special relation with the Chinese or, indeed, with the Korean, the Siberian, the Polynesian, or any other religious system, but "is, on the " whole, an inldependent development of Japanese thought." This, however, does not carry us very far, and when we read that the extremely vague term, Kami, is alike applicable to such impersonal beings as the 80 or 800 myriad gods of the national pantheon, and even to such shadowy entities as the spirits of plants and animals, seas, rivers, mountains, or whatsoever else may be credited with hidden virtues and powers for good and evil, we seem lost in a shoreless ocean of terrestrial and celestial beliefs. [ 13 3</page><page sequence="3">No. 6.J MAN. t19O9. But here Dr. Aston comes to the rescue and explains that the superhuman Kami claiming -worship, or at least reverence, are twofold, Nature-gods and Man-gods, " the " first being the result of personification, the second of deification." This seems like saying that Shinto is the outcome of animism and ancestor-worship, the two funda- mental concepts which lie at the base of all primitive beliefs. Only Mr. Aston will not have it so, and protests, to me it seems against the evidence, that the cult of ancestors formed no part in the evolution of the Japanese national religion. He hiinmself speaks in one place of " the progressive development of ancestor-worship in Shinto," and elsewhere admits that " nine out of ten educated Japanese will declare that Shinto is ancestor-worship," while Mr. Daigoro Goh adds that this cult was " the creed of " the ancient inhabitants." Hence Mr. Aston's contention that it is a later developmeiit unknown to the primitive system appears to be untenable. He also argues that the great deities of the older Shinito were not Man-gods (deified ancestors) but Nature-gods, suclh as the Sun, the Moon, the Earth, the Sea, Fire, Thunder, &amp;c. But there was still a superfluity of lesser deities who may well have been regarded as Man-gods, and so worshipped. So it was elsewhere, as, for instance, in Greece, where the " Nature- gods" (Zeus, Apollo, Poseidon, &amp;c.) were certainly greater than the "Man-gods" (Hercules, .Esculapius, &amp;c.). No religious system stands apart, and all must be studied from the comparative platform in order to reach their inner essence. (3) With one important reservation, Mr. Spence's MIythologies of Ancient Mexico and Perut will be accepted as a welcome introduction to the religious thought of the cultured Amerindians. The reservation has reference to the statement in the foreword about the supposed "neglect into which the study of the Mexican and Peruvian " mythologies has fallen." The charge of " neglect " is unwarranted, and merely serves to mark the author's limited range of vision, which has had no eye for the astonishing amount of work carried out by German, American, and Mexican students during the last decade or so in this field of research. Most of the names entered in Mr. Spence's short bibliographies are either antiquated or superseded by such specialists as Dr. Arthur Baessler (Ancient Peruvian Art, Einglished by A. H. Keane, 1902-3), Dr. Cyrus Tllomas (many papers in 16th An. Rep. Bur. Eth., and elsewhere), Dr. E. Fo5rstemann (Neue Maya-Forschungen), Dr. E. Seler (The Aubin Tonalarnatl, and Codex Fejervdry, both fully elucidated and Englished by A. H. Keane, 1901, 1902), C. A. Robelo (Diccionazio de i)Iitologia Nahoa, in Anales del Museo Aacional de Mexico, 2nd series). How much the book must suffer from this neglect of the latest and best authorities, may be seen in the treatment of any particular subject, such, for instance, as Tezeatlipoca, the " Mexican Jupiter," as he is called by Sahaguin. The account here given of this bloodthirsty god appears to be taken from Clavigero, or else from his copyist, T. Payne; hence the mistake of translating his name " Shining Mirror," instead of " Smoking Black Mirror," as pointed out by Robelo. Nor was he "the god of the cold season," and originally " an ice-god," since his feast was held in the balmy month of May with a profuse display of fruits and flowers. In all other respects Mr. Spence's memoir may be warmly recommended for its sane and sober views on the Amerind cults and cultures. On the still much-discussed question of the origin and development of the native religions and civilisations he is strongly opposed to what I have elsewhere called the "Asiatic School," that is, those who bring 'everything from the Eastern hemisphere, and will not allow the American aborigines to have initiated any of their social and political systems. He rightly points out that such foreign influences, did they ever exist, " must have been of the most " transitory description, and could have left but few traces upon the religion of the peoples in question." Then it is added, that " almost exhaustive proof of the wholly indigenous nature of the American religions is offered by the ruins of the large centres " of culture and civilisation which are found scattered through Yucatan and Peru." [ 14 ]</page><page sequence="4">1909.] MAN. [Nos. .6-8. And the work concludes with the trenchant remark that " the origins of the religions " of Mexico and Peru could not bave been of any other than an indigenous nature. " Their evolution took place wholly upon American soil, and if resemblances appear ' in their systems to the mythologies or religions of Asia, they are explicable by that " law now so well known to anthropologists and students of comparative religion, that, " given similar circumstances, and similar environments, the evolution of the religious " beliefs of widely separated peoples will proceed upon similar lines."
