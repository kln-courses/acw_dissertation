<plain_text><page sequence="1">141 EXCAVATIONS IN IRAQ,, 1977-78 The years 1977 and 1978 witnessed a spectacular increase in the number of archaeological excavations in Iraq, both Iraqi and foreign. The chief reason for this was the intensive rescue operation mounted by the State Antiquities Organi- zation in the Hamrin basin, where many ancient sites are threatened by a dam now nearing completion. The conspicuous success of this operation, in which foreign excavators were able to take advantage of the generous allocation made by the Iraqi government, will be apparent in the following pages. The amount of work did however make it impossible for Mr. Postgate to prepare a separate report for 1977, since he was in the field at the time. Hence we have to offer a biennial report, covering more than 60 sites. The reports have been collected and edited by Mr. J. N. Postgate and Mr. P. J. Watson, both members of the British Archaeological Expedition to Iraq. Our gratitude goes not only to them, but to all the directors and other archaeologists who have generously contributed to the collection. In some cases we have failed to collect a report, and in this case a brief note is included ; this, and a certain un- evenness in the length of the reports, is an inevitable result of the size of the under- taking, and we wish to apologize to those directors whose sites are not properly covered. The collection is divided into two parts : normal excavations (including three sites in the Haditha dam area), and sites in the Hamrin basin rescue project, each arranged in alphabetical order. We wish to express our gratitude here to Dr. Behnam Abu as-Soof and Sd. Sabah Jasim for their assistance in collecting reports on the Hamrin and Haditha sites respectively, for which they are the overall directors. Information has sometimes been culled from the Organization's journal Al-Athari, and in this case the source is acknowledged at the end of the report. Otherwise the data come from personal visits, written reports submitted by the excavators, and contributions to the Babylon, Assur and Hamrin conference in Baghdad in December 1978. In conclusion we would like to express our sincerest thanks to the Director- General of Antiquities, Dr. Muayad Sa'id Damerji, not only for permission to prepare this collection, but for the enthusiasm with which he has initiated the " excavation explosion " by which archaeology in Iraq has entered a new phase.

II. The fourth season of ex- cavations by the British Archaeological Expedition, directed by J. N. Postgate, lasted from October 1978 into January 1979. In Area E the ash tip to the south-east of the Southern Unit was investigated in the hope of obtaining seed remains for botanical analysis. Although we did not succeed in this aim, the use of the sieves was a happy chance, since the rubbish yielded as many as 100 sealings and fragments of impressions, as well as a piece of ED III administrative tablet, many human and animal figurines and an unusual number of miniature pottery jars and pottery discs. Of particular interest were some sealings impressed with a cylinder seal, over which a stamp seal with lion's face had been counter-stamped. Cut into this rubbish at a later date was the grave of a child, with cylinder seal, copper vanity set, a pair of silver sandals, and a silver eyepatch. On the north side of Area E four new squares were opened, to follow the walls of the Eastern Houses and of the Central Complex. In 6G 44, 45, and 35 the east side of the Central Complex was traced, but many graves and cuts of the late ED III period had damaged the rooms. One of the rooms had housed a succession of small ovens, but the others were unremarkable. To the east it proved impossible to re- cover the complete plan of the house first excavated in 6G37, because two large cuts, as well as erosion, had removed the walls to the north-west and south-east. Here too, several late graves were found close to the surface, as well as the occasional ED III tablet. In 6G64b a 4 ? 4 m sounding was sunk through the foundation of the Southern Unit, and confirmed the sequence noted in 6G54 in 1976, showing a thick band of dirty debris (Level II) overlying much cleaner walls, floors, and fill belonging to Level III. This should provide us with a link between the ceramic sequence of Area E and the earlier periods represented elsewhere on the site. On the West Mound the clearance of the surface, begun in 1977, was virtually completed. Following the same procedure, the part to the south and east was now cleared, including the second high point of the mound. This revealed that in square 2G48 the double enclosure wall runs into a less thick wall leading north along the</page><page sequence="5">EXCAVATIONS IN IRAQ, 197 7-78 145 west side of an alley plunging between the rooms cleared in 1977. To the north- east no further details survive, but two other substantial walls lead southwards from the same point, and must also have delimited large enclosures to the east and south, separated also by a street. Further to the south this level is concealed by later deposits, including a large rubbish pit full of many solid-footed goblets. To the east again the contour of the mound means that the main building phase has been eroded, but this exposes an area of dark debris which contains Uruk period sherds, so that it is not fortuitous that at the extreme eastern side of the tell we encountered two stretches of wall in rectangular?and not, as elsewhere, plano-convex?bricks. Finally, a small cut was made in the side of a ditch dug for drainage through the North-East Mound. This was intended merely to recover a sequence of stratified pottery and to date the foundation of the settlement at this point, and in spite of delays caused by four burials and the weather, it does appear that this mound, unlike the North-West Mound, was not founded before the Early Dynastic period. Al-Aleimiyat This site lies in the eastern outskirts of Baghdad, in the suburb of Kemaliyeh to the east of the old Baqubah road beyond Tell adh-Dhibai. It was excavated during 1978 by the State Antiquities Organization under the direction of Sd. Mu'tasim Rashid Abdur-Rahman. A wide area was exposed in three levels, from Kassite to Isin-Larsa in date. Among other finds should be mentioned a number of cylinder seals. Al-Hiba The fifth season of the American Expedition to Al-Hiba took place from November 1977 to January 1978, and was directed as usual by Dr. V. E. Crawford and Prof. D. P. Hansen. This season's effort was concentrated on an area immediately to the south of the Bagara of Ningirsu. What has been uncovered so far of what is probably the largest known building of the Early Dynastic period, indicates that the plan is both massive and unique. The work was concentrated on the northern side of what is probably an enormous precinct whose outer limits are defined by three major walls forming two long corridors. The three walls (labelled, from north to south, A, ? and C) have been traced for a length of almost 200 m, and throughout this entire length there is nothing which indicates a door. At the eastern end of the excavation it is clear that the walls started to turn towards the south ; in the west they curved gently towards the south, turned sharply once more towards the west and finally curved sharply again to the south. Wall A is a little over 5 m wide and was built in three or four sections ; both faces were heavily plastered. Only Wall A had any distinctive features : a flight of stairs was built into it, consisting of eight steps with a total height of 1 -35 m ; in the west its south face was added to by the construction of three buttresses with a low mud-brick bench between two of them, though none of these were bonded to the wall. Walls ? and C do not have any such additions. The outer face of Wall C, facing what was probably the inner court, had three large, neatly plastered niches</page><page sequence="6">I46 EXCAVATIONS IN IRAQ, 1977-78 standing to a height of 2 ? 72 m. All the walls, where they were excavated in depth, leaned heavily to the south. Because of the height to which the walls are preserved it was only possible to clear the chambers to the floor level in a relatively few places. At some point this building was intentionally filled, several types of filling being used. Where the bottoms of the walls could be tested, a 10 cm layer of sand had been used underneath them. In the west end of the chamber formed by Walls A and ? at least 20 cm of mud plaster floors were excavated. Furthermore, after the floors had accumulated, a skin wall 0 -52 m wide was added to the north face of Wall A. The floor (s) belonging to this latter phase were for the most part destroyed when the chamber was filled. Elsewhere in the building there was evidence of repairs made prior to the filling ; in two cases the earlier wall was cut back and re-surfaced ; in another case, apparently because of the effect of water at the base of the wall, a new skin had been applied. Some evidence of building activity of the 2nd millennium near and on the central section of this wall consisted mainly of the foundations of a rather poorly constructed house. Parts of four rooms were preserved and a court which had on its northern side a small oven or tannur. The bricks are of a size usually associated with the Isin- Larsa?Old Babylonian period, and the pottery indicates a similar date. Ten burials were found this season, most being simple inhumations though a few were provided with burial jars which suggest an Old Babylonian date. Two seem to be re-burials. A very large well or reservoir of baked brick is also probably to be dated to the Old Babylonian period. Between the Bagara of Ningirsu and the Early Dynastic building was part of a room that can (on brick-size) be dated to the time of Gudea. On the floor of this room was a single tablet listing names and amounts of an unknown item. In the fill of another room, to the north of this, was an inscribed brick of Gudea. Aqar Quf The State Antiquities Organization began work at an outlying part of the site of Aqar Quf and continued excavations from June to December 1978, under the direction of Dr. Suphi Anwar Rashid. The area excavated lies about 7 km south- west of the Zigurrat, and parts of two courtyards from a large palatial building have been uncovered. In a deep sounding just outside the wall of this complex, three levels of Kassite occupation were identified, and the lowest of them is founded immediately on natural rock. In a second area, perhaps 1 km further from the main site, an unremarkable section of private houses was excavated, near the course of the Nahar Isa. A Kassite double-jar burial was found in these buildings, and both here and in the first area large quantities of Kassite pottery were recovered. Assur Work at ASSur was begun during 1978 by the State Antiquities Organization under the direction of Dr. Tariq Madhloom. Andrae's dig house has been restored for use by the Iraqi expedition, and plans are under way to convert the Ottoman police post to a site museum, and to fence the entire site. The Gurgurri and Western</page><page sequence="7">EXCAVATIONS IN IRAQ, I977-78 I47 Gates have been cleared of the earth accumulated since their excavation by the German Expedition, and so has the Parthian Palace. During the work on the expedition house three Parthian graves were encountered, and the brickwork of one of these, consisting of a pair of vaulted rooms with a central entrance, has been preserved under the house. Babylon A major project of re-excavation and restoration was begun in 1978 by the State Antiquities Organization, under Dr Muayad Sa'id, Director General of Antiquities. The restoration work is under the supervision of Sd. Ali M. Mehdi M.A., and has been initiated in many parts of the site including the Greek Theatre, Ishtar Gate, Southern Palace, Processional Way, the gates, the bridge, and the Summer Palace. Fresh excavations have been started on one area to the north of the Southern Palace, and east of the site where the German Archaeological Institute investigated the Seleucid bit aklti (cf. Iraq 34 (1972), 140). This work began in February 1978, under the supervision of Sd. Abdul-Kadir Hassan M.A. and subsequently of Sd. Sabah Abboud M.A. No more than 50 m to the east of the earlier German exca- vation, Area C was opened, revealing three major building levels, all of Parthian date and extending down 5 m to water level. The most striking discovery was an elaborate tomb dug into the first and second levels, and built of baked brick with gypsum plaster. It had three narrow chambers (presumably for individual burials) to the east and west of a paved central area reached by a narrow staircase from the south. Facing one, on entrance to the tomb, is a blank wall decorated with two applied fluted half-columns, and the wall above these shows clear signs that the whole space was vaulted. It seems probable, by comparison with contemporary tombs elsewhere, that another chamber was built above the vault, though it is now lost. As to the importance of the tomb, this is underlined by the discovery in the western chambers of gold jewellery, including finger-rings and ear-rings. Two other areas are as yet less productive. In Area A to the east of C, a thin layer of Islamic housing overlies a level of Parthian houses built either side of a street running north to south ; the excavations here have gone down 4 ? 50 m and are still in Parthian layers. Area ? lies further to the north-west, and was taken down to a depth of 2 m, also disclosing remains of the Parthian era, including house walls and many graves. Basra {Old City) In 1978 the State Antiquities Organization initiated a major programme in the Old City at Basra, aimed at revealing as much as possible of the city of the early Islamic period, and to protect it from modern housing development. Several hundred donums of land have already been bought to reserve them for future archaeological research. During 1978, excavations were begun under Dr. Kadhim al-Janabi in a wide area of buildings. The architecture uncovered consisted predominantly of large, well-built residences, each with a private prayer-room distinguished by its stucco panel against the wall in one corner with a low plastered dais in front (cf.</page><page sequence="8">I48 EXCAVATIONS IN IRAQ, IQ^J-jQ Ctesiphon ; Habibiyeh). These houses date to the early Abbasid period, as does an oil-pressing (?) installation. Ctesiphon (Al-Madain) While restoration work has continued on the arch at Taq Kisra, excavation was resumed in November 1978 at a site just north of the Museum, to the west of earlier excavations (cf. Iraq 34 (1972), 141), under the direction of Hana' Abdul-Khaliq. A wide area of housing of the late Sassanian period has been uncovered. At least five distinct houses can be identified, with a street along the east side, and most rooms are gypsum-plastered with extensive use of baked bricks. Fragments of wall- painting have been recovered, in blue and black on a white background, and in the corners of several rooms are arched, carved stucco-work panels in front of which is a low plastered dais (cf. Habibiyeh, Basra). One room in particular, in a relatively early layer on the south side of the excavated area, has a vaulted roof, and its south wall is entirely occupied by carved stucco ornament, including one rectangular and one arched niche, resembling a mihrab. Plentiful glassware, glazed pottery and other artefacts have also been recovered, and work continues during 1979. GleVeh This site in the Haditha dam area lies on the west bank of the Euphrates, 27 km north-west of Haditha. The site is bounded on three sides by a double defence wall and on the north-west by the river. Between the two walls on the south-east side are the remains of a large tower, and these represent the highest point, at 132 m above sea level. Excavations began at the site in March 1978 under the direction of Sd. Khalid Suwaid Dhahir, on behalf of the State Antiquities Organization, and have now been completed. The exterior wall is built of rubble and limestone with blocks of mud and gypsum and the interior wall is solely of mud-brick, the breadth of the two walls being some 8-10 m. The exterior wall is surrounded by a defensive ditch, especially on the north- east and south-east sides. The tower was built on a high natural outcrop of stone, using mud-bricks 30 ? 30 ? 12 cm. On the exterior is a series of buttresses and niches, while inside are many rooms with thick walls and a staircase leading to the roof. Many private houses are arranged parallel with the three sides of the interior wall and also between the two walls, especially in the north-east and south-east. All are built of unshaped stones but with libn superstructures. Drainage channels were built of baked brick or simply dug out of the stony ground, and these end in vertical drains. Within the houses were found a number of tannurs, ovens, basins with gypsum lining, and stone mortars. Some of the smaller rooms appeared to be barley stores. A terracotta figurine of an animal ( ?lion) was set in a rectangular niche on a base 2 * 20 m high and o ? 75 m wide. Pottery of the Middle and Neo- Assyrian periods was recovered, together with some of Kassite and Parthian date. Damaged limestone fragments from Assyrian sculptures featured among the finds. About 50 Neo-Assyrian graves were encountered, variously dug into the walls or into the ground to a depth of 1 m. Most consist of two pottery jars placed mouth</page><page sequence="9">EXCAVATIONS IN IRAQ, 1977-78 I49 to mouth, and as well as a number of complete skeletons and skulls, the grave contents included cylinder seals, beads, amulets, bracelets, spear-heads and both pottery and metal vessels. Habibiyeh The site lies in the eastern outskirts of Baghdad, some 4 km east of the Army Canal and close to the Kirkuk railway-line. There is a large area of Islamic occupation, threatened by development, and excavations were begun here in 1978 by the State Antiquities Organization, under the direction of Dr. Muhammad Baqir Al-Husseini. Work began at the highest point, which stands some 4-5 m above the plain, but the centre of the mound proved unproductive, with considerable depths of building rubble. On the south-west side of the tell, however, a street was located, and along its south-west side three adjacent solidly constructed courtyard houses. Close to the entrance from the street each has a bathroom, with bitumen drainage channels, and baked brick drains leading away beneath the walls and along the street. In the first house (to the south-east), several of the rooms were gypsum-plastered, with a stucco ornamental panel in one corner (usually the north-west), framed by small applied half-columns and with a low plastered dais in front. Similar arrangements were also noted in the second house, to the north (cf. also Basra and Ctesiphon). Particularly striking in the second house was a long reception room on the north- west side of the courtyard, which had a stucco ornamented panel on its south-west end wall, and in front of this at least three successively replastered floorings, the second of which was painted with an abstract design in black, red, orange, yellow and blue. Pottery, and a coin, date the buildings to the Abbasid period. Haditha Rescue work in the area along the Euphrates, to be flooded by a dam just above the town of Haditha, is being directed by Sd. Sabah Jasim. Up to the end of 1978 the three sites which had been investigated were : Glei'eh, Sur Jur'eh and Zawiyeh, on which reports are included here. Hatra The State Antiquities Organization continued its restoration work at Hatra during 1976 and 1977, but fresh excavations were not resumed until 1978, when a three month season was undertaken under the supervison of Sd. Muhammad Suphi. While restoration work went on in the Temple of the Triad and the Temple of All?t, the expedition began the re-excavation of the 11 identified shrines previously excavated. Some of their rooms had never been fully cleared, and this led to the discovery of statuary and pottery jars. Also, along the south wall of the Great Temple enclosure, some new rooms were cleared, yielding some Aramaic inscriptions and human statues. The chief result of the season was, however, in a newly identified twelfth shrine which lies some distance to the south of the Great Temple. In general, it resembles the other shrines already known, with its entrance on the east side facing the cella,</page><page sequence="10">I50 EXCAVATIONS IN IRAQ, I977-78 which is not recessed in the rear wall as usual, but is like that of Shrine 6, being a space enclosed by two partitions with a high podium between them. To the north and south of the main room are pairs of smaller chambers, and a staircase in greenish marble leads up to the roof round the north-east corner of the exterior wall. The floor of the shrine is also paved with marble, and the walls are covered with gypsum plaster into which Aramaic inscriptions are incised. These and other inscriptions prove that the shrine was dedicated to Nabu. Inside the shrine, on the floor, were several statues and statuettes, some of which are of the god himself, some of priests and nobles. There is also a fine octagonal " cult-bank ", each face of which is decorated with the figure of a deity in relief. Isin (Ishan al-Bahriyat) The sixth season of excavation by the German Isin Expedition under the direction of Prof. Dr. B. Hrouda took place from October to November 1978. In the Gula Temple efforts were concentrated on completing the temple plan and defining its outer limits. On the south-west side, where the Kassite levels are completely eroded, the temple is bounded by a wall 4 m wide. The foundation boxes at either end of this wall were located and opened, but found to be empty except for ash. The size of the uninscribed baked bricks used in its construction suggests that the wall is to be dated to the Ur III period. Additions to this wall which extend beyond the temple to the north-west and south-east apparently form the boundary of a larger t?menos area. In the angle between this t?menos wall and the north-west side of the temple, below a large robber trench, occupation levels of the Uruk IV and ED I periods were found. The brickwork on the north-west side of the temple takes the form of several superimposed terraces, indicating that the temple of the Kassite period was built upon a terrace over the remains of earlier periods. The east corner of the temple was also cleared, revealing a further two rooms in which there was evidence of several phases of reconstruction during the Kassite period and later. The most important find of the season came from a deposit in the Kurigalzu level : a statue, 16? 5 cm high, in ED Ilia style, of a kneeling naked man holding his left hand behind his back. His right arm (missing) would have been held out in front ; his only clothing is a triple belt. In the south-eastern part of the mound, where a trial trench was dug in 1977, the foundations of a large building, c. 31 ? i8 m, with two courtyards and sixteen rooms around them, were found. This building is not precisely datable, but it overlies the finely plastered walls of a building of the Old Babylonian period which survives to a height of 1 ? 20 m ; the earlier building could not be examined extensively this season. In the debris between the two levels some 30 Old Babylonian tablets were found, including Sumerian literary texts and two administrative lists of gods. In the northern area the south corner of the large house first excavated in 1974 was finally cleared, and a further 33 Old Babylonian tablets were found. In a trial trench to the west of the Adad-apla-iddina pavement walls of the Isin I, Old Babylonian and Neo-Babylonian periods were found, and 25 tablets (mostly contracts and administrative texts) with year formulae of Enlil-bani, Rim-Sin, Hammurapi and Samsuiluna. On the surface to the west of this trench a brick stamped with the name and titles of Urdukuga of Isin was found.</page><page sequence="11">EXCAVATIONS IN IRAQ, 1977-78 I5I Khirbet f addala This site lies on the right bank of Wadi Jaddala, 22 km south-west of Qaiyara and 51 km north-east of Hatra. Excavations were undertaken by Sd. Jabir Khalil Ibrahim in October 1977 to March 1978. The main site is enclosed by a chain of mounds forming a square approximately 105 X 105 m, except on the eastern side where five square column bases standing 3-4 m high were visible before excavation. The first task was to determine the nature of the outer wall. This was standing up to 2 -50 m high, and is built of dressed lime- stone in the lower part with a mud-brick superstructure. It was defended by large towers on the north and west sides, with internal rooms and buttresses between them on the outside. The space between the buttresses was arched, and beneath each resulting vault were one or two arrow-slits. Along the inner face of the outer wall ranges of rooms opened on to the courtyard. Three were excavated on the west side, one on the north, and each has arrow-slits through the wall and gypsum-plastered floor. The main mound measures 40 ? 35 m, and a sounding 8x4m was made in it on the west side. A building was revealed with an outer wall with towers and buttresses on the north, west and south sides, entered by a door in the south-west. On the east side, however, was a complex of rooms and passages, making an elaborate dog-leg entrance with arrow-slits covering the main points of access. In rooms on the west side were found a large quantity of animal bones as well as evidence of heavy burning. Elsewhere greenish-blue glazed ware sherds were recovered, similar to those found at Hatra, and a pear-shaped jar with two handles. The most im- portant discoveries were two door-lintels bearing an identical Aramaic inscription, giving the name of the man who presumably constructed and lived in the building, Aji the son of Aba, and the date of its erection, year 448 of the Seleucid era, i.e. a.d. 137-8. Over the west door of Room 18, obviously a main entrance to the build- ing, was an eroded relief showing an eye pierced by a dagger, and attacked by a scorpion and a snake from the left, while a long-necked bird pecks at it from the right. The nature of the building remains uncertain. The outer defences suggest a castellum, but they may be later than the inner building. An identification with ad Herculem, the last station on a northern road to Hatra on the Peutinger Map, is possible, but the plan of the inner building, which seems to be without parallels, is completely unlike the standard small shrines of Hatra. A report will appear in a forthcoming issue of Sumer. Larsa The eighth season of excavations by the Mission Arch?ologique Fran?aise en Iraq took place from September to December 1978, under the direction of M. Jean- Louis Huot. At Tell el-Oueili the area uncovered in 1976 (Levels 5 to 1) was extended by 4 new squares to complete the plans from the first season. The pottery recovered in 1976 was drawn. During the next campaign a special team will work at the site for three months : the results already obtained are sufficiently promising to justify ? u</page><page sequence="12">I52 EXCAVATIONS IN IRAQ, 1977-78 an extended excavation campaign there. The lithic material is studied by J. Tixier (CNRS) and the faunal remains by J. Desse (CNRS). Pollen and carbon samples have been taken, of which the results are not yet known. At Larsa efforts were concentrated on the E.Babbar mound and a new Room (15) was excavated. Thanks to the co-operation of the State Antiquities Organi- zation, the paving could be lifted, resulting in the recovery of 270 fragments of tablets or complete tablets. This important archive collection is of the same kind as that recovered in 1974 from Room 3, and comes from the administration of the temple. Among them there was, however, a fragment of the text of the Code of Hammurapi (Verso, Col. XI, 44 ff. and Col. XII 45 ff.). On the E.Babbar proper the exploration of the large Room 9 was completed, and Room 16 excavated. To the west of these rooms a new courtyard was discovered, and bricks with the names of BurnaburiaS and Nazi-Maruttas were found in situ. The preserved height of the walls here is impressive and exceeds 5 m. The enclosure wall of the E.Babbar built by Nebuchadnezzar and long known of, was founded directly upon these 2nd millennium structures. One may therefore hope that in future seasons it will be possible to investigate the temple itself, beyond the newly discovered courtyard. However, a necessary preliminary to this is the clearance of a large part of the surface of the E.Babbar, to obtain the plan of the whole complex before any excavation, and this will be the major objective of the ninth campaign.

Maghzaliyeh The site of Maghzaliyeh was located by the Soviet Archaeological Mission in 1977, and lies on the west bank of the Wadi Ibra, 7 km to the north-west of Yarim Tepe. The archaeological deposits form a tell 8 -20 m in height, partly cut away by the wadi. Excavations were conducted in 1977 and 1978 by Dr. Nikolai Bader, and revealed an important neolithic settlement. A sounding on the east side of the site in 1977 exposed some fifteen layers of buildings in tauf on stone foundations. Except for one tiny, poorly made fragment, no pottery was found. There were however stone bowls, beads, bracelets, grind- stones and good quality bone implements with incised decorations. A human clay figurine and also stone figurines were found. The lithic industries were rich, with good blades, serrated sickle blades with sheen, and tanged lanceolate arrow-heads with retouch. In the upper layers flint and obsidian occurred in roughly equal quantities, but lower down 80 percent of the tools were of obsidian. During 1978 nearly 400 sq. m were opened up at the centre of the mound, and at the base of its northern slope. This revealed large rectangular constructions of perhaps 40 or 50 sq. m each, built of clay floors on a stone base and stone walls with</page><page sequence="13">EXCAVATIONS IN IRAQ, 1977-78 I53 a gypsum plaster, up to 60 cm in width. The same plan underwent many recon- structions. In the upper levels these structures were delimited to the north by a curving wall with semi-circular projections as though for a tower. At least in these phases there were no buildings outside this wall to the north, but the earlier part of the settlement probably lies to the north. Plenty of bitumen was noted, some with mat impressions, and also gypsum vessels. Otherwise the finds in 1978 confirm the results of 1977, giving a definite connection between Maghzaliyeh and Jarmo, clearest in the figurine repertoire. On the other hand there are resemblances with Shemshara pre-pottery material, and the arrowheads, among other things, suggest western connections. Good samples of grain were recovered from different levels as well as wild animal remains. Nimrud Re-excavation and restoration by the State Antiquities Organization has pro- ceeded throughout 1976 to 1978, under the direction of Sd. Myesser Said and later, in the Nabu Temple, of Sd. Abdullah Amin Agha. In the North-West Palace, the roofing of the south wing of the inner courtyard (Rooms S, X etc.) has been completed, and the site of the palace has been fenced. At the south-west corner, some distance to the south of Room SA (cf. R. Sobolewski, AfO 25 (1974-77), 231, or RLA V, 312-3), three new rooms were excavated; at the extreme south end (and perhaps at the limit of the entire complex) was a bath- room paved and lined with baked bricks plastered with bitumen, and reached by a passage from the west. To its north, but not directly connected, were two parallel rooms, their long axes east-west and about 5 m in width. They communicated through a doorway, and another passage leads northwards from the north-wesc corner. The northern of the two rooms had a secondary transverse wall built across it, and in the southern one were two graves with late Assyrian pottery. Some clearance work was also undertaken at Fort Shalmaneser, in the region of the courtyard bordered by SW 16, SW 37 and SW 36. Along the south side of the city wall the stone revetment of Esarhaddon was re-exposed from the corner by the watergate eastwards for a distance of 150 m. Work in the Nabu Temple, which began in 1978, has concentrated on the outer courtyard. The south wall of NTS 13, the eastern range of rooms NTS 8-12 and, to the south, Rooms NT 1,9, 10 and 11 have been cleared, together with the court- yard itself. On the western side of the courtyard NTS 18 has also been cleared (see M. E. L. Mallowan, ? &amp; R III, Plan VI). After clearance, the walls have been capped with modern baked brick to protect them from further deterioration. During the clearance many post-Assyrian graves were encountered, as well as pottery, stone vessels, and metal objects. A long drain was found to pass beneath the floor of the building, running through it from south to north. Samarra The work of the State Antiquities Organization at Samarra continued during 1978 under the direction of Dr. Tariq al-Janabi. In addition to further restoration work, in particular at Abu Dulaf, excavations were undertaken in three areas. To the</page><page sequence="14">154 EXCAVATIONS IN IRAQ, 1977-78 west of the Malwiyah a staircase leading down into a sirdab was investigated, and was found to give access to two vaulted chambers cut out of the natural limestone (cithth?n). Close to the previously excavated house known as Beit az-Zaharif, not far south of the Dar al-Khalifah, a month of excavation was undertaken in another house of the same date. Although rather damaged, the house had an entrance at the south, giving on to a brick-paved courtyard through a vestibule ; to the west were two rooms with bitumened floors, presumably bathrooms, and in other rooms remains of stucco decoration were recovered. In order to investigate the character of the ordinary Samarran private house, work was also undertaken in a small mound called Kubbat Hejwel, which lies about 2 km south-east of Abu Dulaf and ? km to the west of the Great Street. This dis- closed a rectangular enclosure with a 2 m thick wall, measuring 60 m (NW-SE) by 40 m (SW-NE). Two thirds of this enclosure, on its north-east side, was an open space, with entrances from the north-west and the north-east. The house itself is built down the length of the south-west side, and consists of a group of four rooms at the north-west end, separated by a courtyard space from a second small group, behind which to the southeast there was also a sirdab. Sippar Excavations at Sippar (Abu Habba) were begun by the College of Arts, Baghdad University, in October, 1978, and continue during 1979, under the general direction of Dr. Walid al-Jadir, with site supervision by Sd. Zuhair Rajib. A new site contour map has been prepared, and actual excavation work has begun on the north side of the mounds, where Old Babylonian layers lie directly beneath the surface (Area ? in the plan of V. Scheil, Une saison de fouilles). At least two large buildings have been uncovered ; it is not yet clear whether another structure forms a part of one of these or is an independent construction. A street running north-south separates the two major buildings, with another possible street at right-angles to it running east-west. The building which is most fully excavated has three phases, of which the earliest shows considerable differences in its ground plan to the later phases. All phases show signs of heavy burning. Notable features include one room with baked brick floor, with a small hole through it at one point, perhaps a bathroom. Also there were several hearths or other fire-installations, some of which seem to have been associated with burials beneath them, although another was probably a bitumen kiln. At the south of the excavated area the building is cut by a large pit, the fill of which is very clean and contains few sherds. Dug into this pit are Neo-Babylonian graves and two vertical pottery drains. There is also a large oven or kiln at the north end of the pit. By March 1979 almost 100 Old Babylonian tablets had been recovered from all three phases of the main building and from the other building. They include some 15 school tablets (all from the second building), a letter, a religious text, a list of personal names, a list of year names and an adoption document, as well as the usual loan and purchase documents. One tablet mentions an oath by the name of Sin- muballit, while several texts are dated to Samsu-iluna 7.</page><page sequence="15">EXCAVATIONS IN IRAQ, 1977-78 155 Sur Ju^eh Work at Sur Jur'eh in the Haditha dam area was begun by the State Antiquities Organization in October 1978 and was continuing in 1979, under the direction of Sd. Abdur-Rahman Muhammad Ali. The mound is situated on the left bank of the Euphrates about 500 m from the river, and lies between the villages of Jur'eh and Suheiliyeh. It stands 2 m above plain level, and is delimited by a wall forming a square with sides of 300 m. An unpaved road crosses the site, and in the south- west is a domed shrine to Sheikh Muhammad Abdul-Wahid, surrounded by a modern cemetery. The site of Glei'eh (q.v.) lies on the opposite bank of the river, and it is hoped that continuing excavation will establish the historical relationship between the two sites. The exterior wall is large, and constructed of stone rubble with gypsum on the outer face. A defensive ditch runs parallel with it. An interior wall of mud brick surrounds the dwelling area. Thus the site has a fortified appearance, and a role in the protection of the Euphrates trade route could be envisaged. Many openings in the exterior wall, especially on the north-east and north-west sides, are presum- ably entrances. Prelimimary study of the surface finds has revealed a few sherds of Kassite date, sherds from the Middle and Neo-Assyrian periods, and some from Parthian times. Tell Abu Dhahir Excavations have been conducted at this important site, in the region to be flooded by the Eski Mosul dam, by the Mosul University College of Arts, under the direction of Dr. Amer Suleiman, during 1977-1979, but unfortunately we have no further information at present. Tell ed-Der The Belgian Archaeological Mission undertook a ninth season of excavations at Tell ed-Der, directed by Prof. L. de Meyer with M. H. Gasche, during the autumn of 1977. During this season excavations were limited to Sounding E, where the building housing the archives of the two chief lamentation-priests, father and son, at the Temple of Anunitum, was found in 1975. So far over 2,000 texts have been recovered, well grouped together in a number of the rooms. The most recent of these documents belongs to the end of the reign of Ammi-saduqa. The aims of the excavations during the 1977 season were (a) to identify the foundations of the building, (b) to clean the graves related to the floors of the building and (c) to excavate the earlier layers under the building. Stratigraphie observations show that the whole site of the future construction was excavated to a depth of more than 2 m before building activities began. Then the foundations were built and the space between them filled in with material consisting of re-worked archaeological layers. The 1975 excavations had already revealed two phases of construction, and this year's investigations confirm that observation ; the smaller, original building was later enlarged on its northern side. The archives mentioned above belong exclusively to this later, enlarged, occupation.</page><page sequence="16">I56 EXCAVATIONS IN IRAQ, 1977-78 Graves could be recognized under both phases and under most of the rooms. However, it should be pointed out that the three rooms containing all the grouped archives did not have a single burial related to the later phase of occupation. Deep soundings in several rooms revealed complex lithostratigraphic accumu- lation under the building : numerous small and large clay lumps, bricks, lumps of dismembered archaeological layers, artefacts and disturbed human bones are contained in a sandy, sometimes loamy-sandy matrix. Such deposits are suggestive of the remains of one or more relatively important inundations. It is interesting to note that very similar sediments have been found at the same level and in the same chronological context in Sounding B, which is located on the opposite side of the tell. Both layers have to be dated to late Old Babylonian times. Tell Muhammad This site, which has been known since the time of Layard, now lies well within the limits of eastern Baghdad, and work began here on behalf of the State Antiquities Organization in 1978, under the direction of Sd. Mu'tasim Rashid Abdur-Rahman. A wide area of housing has been exposed, and in one area a temple has been ex- cavated to a depth of about 3 m, revealing successive phases during which the altars were plastered and rebuilt to allow for the rises in ground level. The main occupation of the site is of the Isin-Larsa period, and this is confirmed by cylinder seals and a group of business documents found in a pot in one of the houses. Tell Uqair A sounding was undertaken at Tell Uqair, Mound B, during October 1978 by the Institut f?r Ur- und Fr?hgeschichte of Heidelberg University, directed by Dr. M. M?ller-Karpe. Work was concentrated on an area adjacent to the excavation pit of 1940 and 1941, where a building and an ED Ill/Early Akkadian cemetery had been discovered. The building investigated this season is built of tauf and seems to be part of a dwelling complex (rather small rooms with one tannur in a corner of each room). Some of the newly excavated ED III graves cut into the tauf walls. The building could be dated to ED II/III by a complete spouted jar, crushed and covered by parts of a collapsed tannur. A section was also cleaned in a drainage channel which cuts the southern portion of Mound B, and settlement layers were attested down to the water table at c. 3 -50 m below the surface of the tell. Umm al-Hafriyat The site consists of several low mounds along the line of an ancient water-course, about 25 km east of Nippur. Collections of surface sherds show that the occupation spans Uruk to Seleucid times, although the settlement tended to shift, resulting in several small mounds rather than one large one. Excavations began here in autumn 1977, directed by Prof. McG. Gibson on behalf of the Nippur Expedition of the University of Chicago. A stratigraphie pit was sunk in the highest point, Area A, and this produced more</page><page sequence="17">EXCAVATIONS IN IRAQ, 19 7 7-78 15 7 than 4 m of Isin-Larsa occupation. Below this was a thin Ur III level, founded on sterile soil. The pottery from this correlated very well with similarly dated material from Nippur. A second operation was the excavation of a 20 m square in Area C to expose buildings of the Akkadian period. Although damaged by pits from illegal digging, good plans were recoverable together with unusual quantities of seed, bone and other samples and very well made artifacts. All the walls of Area C are constructed of plano-convex mud-bricks, usually laid flat but occasionally in herring-bone fashion. None of the corners were bonded, and walls were erected on top of the available surfaces without levelling. All had thick mud plaster. Many ovens were found in the rooms and these have covered the floors with thick beds of ash. Some were bread-making ovens, while others were found to contain bones of animals, birds and fish, and in one an Old Akkadian literary tablet. About ten other Old Akkadian tablets were recovered from the rooms ; these record deliveries of various commodities and although mentioning " the temple " they contain no clue as to the identity of the site. Graves are cut into the floors of the building and some at least were definitely dug during its lifetime. Most contain pottery and Akkadian cylinder seals, some of the latter being very unusual. Rare in the Akkadian period, and therefore of some importance, are two stamp seals. The preliminary conclusion about Area C is that it represents the kitchens belonging to a major temple which may lie to the north-east. The buildings can be dated to the latter part of the Akkadian period. [The Oriental Institute Annual Report 1977/78, 20-6] Yarim Tepe The Soviet Archaeological Mission to Iraq continued with its ninth and tenth seasons at Yarim Tepe under the direction of Dr. Raouf Munchaev during March to May, 1977 and 1978. Work was concentrated on the southern mound, Yarim Tepe III, which has a diameter of 200 m and stands 12 m above the wadi, with a total depth of deposit of 20 m. The tell resembles Arpachiyah in that a small 'Ubaid site lies on top of a larger Halaf mound. The only later remains are Hellenistic and Islamic graves cut into the 'Ubaid levels. The 'Ubaid deposits are up to 3 -50 m in depth and consist of several large house units in a good state of preservation, some walls standing 1 -50-2 m high. Some rooms are normal living rooms, but there are a considerable number of rooms for storage and other special purposes of an economic kind. The walls are of mud- brick and at the centre is an open square which was also built in during the final phase. Outside the buildings, in the courtyards, are kilns, and also a single round structure 3 m in diameter and therefore too large to have been a kiln. Of especial interest is a collection of several hundred grinders in volcanic stone, usually some 60-70 cm in length. Otherwise the finds included the usual stone tools, and one anthropomorphic and several zoomorphic clay figurines. There are many well- preserved pottery vessels, all close to Gawra levels XVIII-XVI, therefore belonging to the earliest Northern 'Ubaid period.</page><page sequence="18">-&lt;= "? 11 &lt;X&gt;~X&gt;S-TO?2,n-C-cO CO ? g 8 2 -Q ? ?"?^w-c-si " &lt; * &lt; "?3 ? &lt; ?S&lt; ?S5i?w" ?S s &lt; lOiflinieuiifi?oioiDioiog I ? ? 1 ? ff -t-P.t; co c O) ?O ?? ? _ ?? r W ? p &gt;ii?&lt;-&gt;t-wxoci?wi-&lt;?Oi&lt;?Oi?a: 5 r^ oo o o t .. . 3 S = * (? ?

At the top was a transitional period, with mixed traditions corresponding to Arpachiyah 5/6. Mostly the archi- tecture is rectangular, though there are several round constructions, grain stores to judge from the quantities of wheat and barley found in them. The pure Halaf levels have pottery of the late Halaf style, geometric and zoomorphic designs including snakes, leopards, birds and fish. Many clay zoomorphic figurines were found in groups, as well as eight or nine female figurines with realistic details. Work continues in 1979; see also Maghzaliyeh. Tas?n Tepe A small expedition from the State Antiquities Organization took up work again at this site (cf. Iraq 37 (1975), 66-7) towards the end of 1978, but a fuller report awaits the resumption of work. In addition to the Islamic levels, excavations also penetrated Assyrian deposits in one place. Zawiyeh This site, which should not be confused with Tell az-Zawiyeh in the Hamrin basin, lies on the west bank of the Euphrates in a bend (as its name implies), which forms a sharp triangle. Excavations on behalf of the State Antiquities Organization began in August 1978, under the direction of Sd. Rabi al-Qaisi. The site survives only as an open area amid the houses of the modern village of Zawiyeh. No surface finds were present, but the villagers had previously found glazed bricks, for which reason it was decided to excavate the site. The surface was stripped from a 5 m square in the area in which it was said that glazed bricks had been found, and indeed some fragments of bricks with coloured decoration were recovered from the rubbish. Enlargement of the area exposed many courses of well- laid stones, the foundations for house walls, and a pavement of large flat bricks (26-5 ? 26-5 ? 5-6 cm), mixed in with others measuring 30 X 30 ? g-io cm, and having the same characteristics as the coloured bricks. There were also pave- ments in stone covered with bitumen to counteract the effect of water, and there is evidence that the site was frequently flooded. Because the site is in a modern village, it is impossible to uncover a wide area, and so soundings were put into the area surrounding the present houses. So far about 30 such soundings have been opened. The most important finds from these are a group of stone walls probably from private houses, and pottery kilns of different types and sizes together with a group of tannurs c. 40-50 cm in diameter. Among the small finds are jars and other vessels of varying shape and capacity, especially from the Assyrian period, and an Old Babylonian or Early Kassite cylinder seal. HAMRIN BASIN RESCUE EXCAVATIONS Note : the numbers after the names of sites refer to Map 2 on which their position is indicated.</page><page sequence="20">16o excavations in IRAQ, 1977-78 Abu Khazaf (No. 8) This is a small Islamic site lying about 5 km south of Tell Abbadeh, and it was investigated by Sd. Sabah Abboud during May 1978. It consists of a scatter of sherds over a rise no higher than half a metre, and it has just one level of occupation, which can be dated to the 4th century Hijra. As well as glazed Islamic sherds and lamps, there were found a large three-handled jar with incised decoration, and some bronze and glass objects. Abu Su'ud This is a mound lying between Zawiyeh (No. 23) and Tell ash-Sha'ir (No. 19). It measures 90 X 6o m, and is 2*50 m in height. Excavation was begun in early 1978 by Dr. Muhammad Baqir al-Husseini, and continued under Sd. Abdur- Rahman Muhammad Ali. The excavations revealed a large, well constructed building measuring 56 ? 40 m and built round a courtyard. The exterior wall was defended by 14 towers. To east and west of the courtyard is a single range of rooms, but on the north and south a double range ; the main hall was reached through its north wall from the courtyard, and had later been divided up by an unbonded partition wall. During a later phase again, some haphazard walls were built on the north side of the courtyard area. Little was found in the rooms except a stone jar, and, lying in a heap in a corner, a group of pierced clay weights, probably from a fishing-net. The exact date is uncertain, but it must be an Achaemenid or Parthian fort. [Al-Athari 1978, No. 1, 34-35] Ahmed al-Hattu (No. 57) Work began at this site in October 1978 under the direction of Dr. D. S?renhagen on behalf of the Deutsche Orient-Gesellschaft, and lasted into December 1978. The site, which lies immediately east of Uch Tepe village, was found to consist of a series of 6 low mounds on both sides of an old wadi running north-south, comprising on the east Mounds A and ? (ED I), and Mound C (Late Uruk), and on the west Mounds D, E, and F (Parthian). Work was confined to the earlier group of tells. Three trenches were put into Mound A and taken down to virgin soil ; this showed that a small village settlement (max. 7 houses) was founded here at the beginning of ED I, and lasted for two building phases. It is in a very poor state of preservation because many graves were subsequently dug into the site, destroying most of the architecture and the contexts of the finds. The chief finds were of pottery, and particularly worthy of note are many sherds of" early Scarlet Ware " in mono- chrome black, monochrome red and bichrome red and black, as well as sherds from the upper parts of straw-tempered pithoi with seal-impressions on the rims. Mound ? lies 60 m west of A and includes the cemetery of this settlement. In one trench 6 graves were located, and one of these contained 4 skeletons with some pottery grave-goods. All the graves are simple pits in the earth. Mound C, about 400 m north of A, has a small settlement of Late Uruk date. At the centre of the mound was a completely preserved potter's kiln, of which two- thirds extended into the trench. It is c. 2 X 2 m, and horseshoe-shaped in plan,</page><page sequence="21">EXCAVATIONS IN IRAC?, 197 7-78 161 and was sunk about 1 ? 20 m into the natural ground. Immediately to its north is an ash pit of the same depth, and of more than 5 m in diameter. The existence of specialist activity of this type in such a small, presumably agricultural, settlement is of interest. Ahmed al-Mughir (No. 55) This tell is the northernmost of a string of three lying about 500 m west of the village of Uch Tepe, which were all excavated by the Chicago-Copenhagen Ex- pedition to the Hamrin, directed by Prof. McGuire Gibson, from September 1978 to March 1979. It lies about 200 m north of Tell Razuk, stands c. 3 m above plain level, and is about 200 m in diameter. A 5 ? 5 m sounding was put into the mound just to the east of the summit, revealing an upper level of the late Kassite period, and beneath this two levels of substantial buildings of the Isin-Larsa period. Several io m squares were also opened and the Kassite level investigated, but it had been badly eroded and yielded little. Aq Tepe (No. 13) This small mound just east of Tell as-Suleimeh was investigated by Sd. Muhammad az-Zahawi on behalf of the State Antiquities Organization during 1978. It proved to have three building levels attributed to the Parthian period and probably con- temporary with the Parthian occupation of the main tell at Suleimeh. No features of special interest were noted in the small sounding. Kheit Nemleh This small mound lies some 500 m to the east of Tell Khallaweh, and a sounding was put into the site in summer 1978, by Sd. Jabbar Khawwas on behalf of the State Antiquities Organization. This revealed that the tell is a small settlement of the Parthian period. Kheit Qasim (No. 65) The Mission arch?ologique fran?aise, directed by Dr. J. D. Forest, conducted excavations at Kheit Qasim from January to June 1978, and is continuing in February 1979. The site is just south of the village of Uyun al-Kheshalat and the largest mound, although very low, measures some 150 x 200 m (Kh.Q. ?) and is an Early Dynastic I cemetery, to be associated with the settlement at Abu Qasim to its west. The burials have brick tombs built over the body which was placed in a grave 1-1-30 X 1-50-2-50 m and a mere 50-60 cm deep. The tomb walls, constructed of bricks 32 X 16 ? 8 cm, are of variable size though the norm seems to be about 1 -20 m (i.e. 4 bricks), with examples down to 0-45 and up to 1 -8o m. One exceptionally large tomb was 6 m long. A major problem is the nature of their elevation and roofing, though some evidence exists to suggest that they were corbel vaulted and had the appearance of a stepped pyramid on the outside. Some of these tombs had two parallel walls built on to them, invariably on the west side, delimiting a small trench c. 30 m wide and several metres long. These walls are</page><page sequence="22">I 62 EXCAVATIONS IN IRAQ, 1977-78 4-6 courses high and their tops must have corresponded to the first step of the pyramid. Male, female and infant burials were all present, although it seems that the number of infant burials is proportionally low. Each tomb had one to three skeletons, but in the case of multiple inhumation only one skeleton was usually articulated, as if the tomb had been re-opened and the contents pushed aside to make room for the new arrival. The normal burial position is lying on the right side in a contracted position with the head always to the west. Grave goods in the burial chamber con- sisted of Scarlet Ware pottery, traces of bitumen baskets, beads, pendants and bronze tools and weapons?knives, axes, chisels. In addition, some metal objects?chisels and axes?seem to have been embedded in the brickwork. The corridors between the two parallel walls contained vases, beads, a bronze axe and animal bones ; and on the first step of the pyramid, so far only on the west side, there were large jars and bowls, the latter containing io, 20 or 30 stacked cups, some hemispherical, some funnel-shaped. Two smaller mounds were also investigated. Kh.Q. 2 preserved some remains of ED I private houses, while Kh.Q. 3 was a late 'Ubaid settlement characterized by a fine black-painted ware. Several houses here were partly cleared, one of which had an infant burial beneath the floor. Mahmud Agha (No. 20) This small mound near Shor Tepe and the village of Kurdere was investigated by Dr. Tariq al-Janabi in the course of his work at Shor Tepe. However, although eight separate soundings were put into the tell, none of them yielded archaeological deposits, and the site was accordingly abandoned. Shor Tepe (No. 21) A small tell not far from the railway on the east side of the Diyala. Work was undertaken by Dr. Tariq al-Janabi on behalf of the State Antiquities Organization in the period December 1977 to February 1978. A section taken down to virgin soil indicated that only one level of occupation is in fact represented at the site, that of a small Ottoman period village. The principal architectural feature was probably a guest-room (diwan), and some rooms for storage were also excavated. The date of the occupation is indicated by some Ottoman coins and fragments of tobacco- pipes. Tell Ababra (No. 34) The Austrian Archaeological Expedition to Iraq, directed by Dr. H. Trenkwalder, undertook two seasons of excavations at Tell Ababra between March and June and October and November, 1978. The tell, which lies to the north-west of Mahmuleh village, is 150 ? 90 m and approximately 5 m high. It has a flatter southern portion and a more steeply sloping northern part with two high points. To the north of the main mound are two other smaller tells, 20 m in diameter and barely more than 1 m in height (Tells D and E).</page><page sequence="23">EXCAVATIONS IN IRAQ, 1977-78 163 The southern part of the site had many Islamic burials dug into the surface but beneath these an area of private housing of Achaemenid-Parthian date was exposed, several house-plans and kilns being recovered. Finds from a test trench established that an occupation level of the Old Babylonian period lay beneath this. On the northern part of the tell a fortified enclosure of the Achaemenid-Parthian period was revealed. Of the two parallel walls discovered, the outer was 2-50 m thick and had projections measuring 7 ? 3 m, of which two have so far been ex- cavated. Several smaller rooms are built on to the inner wall. Both these walls enclose a square building which is surrounded by a drainage system. A likewise fortified enclosure of the Old Babylonian period has a longer expanse than the latter, though the two not absolutely parallel surrounding walls (2 m thick) can at the moment be only partially excavated. Among the walls were found several graves of the Old Babylonian to Parthian periods, on occasion with unusual grave goods. Tell D : Beneath considerable disturbance caused by recent canal-cutting, was found a considerably oxidized loam horizon with sulphur deposits and a grave of the Islamic period. Tell E : Occupation remains interspersed with burials (with grave goods) were uncovered near the surface, and in a deeper level four graves of the Old Babylonian period with rich goods (equid burials) were found. Tell Abbadeh (No. 7) Excavations were undertaken here by the State Antiquities Organization under the direction of Sd. Sabah Abboud, M.A., from December 1977 till July 1978. The site is of oval shape, some 190 ? 150 m, and stands only about 3-50 m high. It consists almost entirely of three main levels of 'Ubaid occupation. Level III, the lowest, was reached only over about half the area of the site. To the west were two rectangular courtyard houses with 12-14 rooms each. Nearer the centre of the mound was a third building with a courtyard, and nearby a large oven (diam. 2 m). From the rooms on the west came much red ochre, together with large storage jars and grind-stones on which it had been prepared. There were also more than 10 gypsum discs, varying from 10-40 cm in diameter and rounded on one surface, not perforated. All this may indicate an area devoted to the manu- facture of pottery. The main level at the site is Level II, in which 11 building units were excavated, each containing many rooms and a T-shaped courtyard. The walls were of mud- bricks measuring 56 ? 27 X 7 cm. At the centre of the mound was the largest house, which had a buttressed exterior wall and three T-shaped courtyards. As in the other levels, floors and walls are gypsum-plastered, and many infant burials were placed beneath the floors. In all 127 graves were noted, all of children ; some were inside painted jars, covered with a pottery bowl or another jar, but in other cases the jar was sealed with clay or gypsum. To the south-east of the main house was an area of circular kilns, some with a perforated division between fuel-space and firing chamber, as well as the remnants of a domed roof. These are quite different from a type of egg-shaped clay oven which was also found to the south of the main house in Level II.</page><page sequence="24">164 EXCAVATIONS IN IRAQ, 1977-78 Level I was essentially a rebuilding of Level II, but only the foundations of the walls survived. As far as could be told, the settlement was similar to Level II. The pottery throughout the site was abundant, and showed a great range of excellent painted and incised designs, sometimes combined on the same vessel. All three levels belong to the earlier 'Ubaid style identified in the Hamrin basin, with close parallels to Eridu and Hajji Muhammad. Other typical 'Ubaid arte- facts were bent clay cones (some painted), stone maces, stone vessels, and human and animal figurines, painted and unpainted, in clay and stone. There were many flint and some obsidian tools, some being blades with bitumen still adhering. Metal was represented by some copper rings. [Al-Athari 1978, No. 1, 21-22] Tell Abqa* (No. 58) The Hamrin Expedition of the University of Munich, led by Dr. L. Tr?mpelmann, worked at Tell Abqa' from the end of September to the beginning of December 1978. The prominent mound is approximately 200 X 300 m, and stands 10-40 m above plain level. On the surface of the north-east side of the mound walls constructed of pebbles set in mortar were identified, being the enclosure walls of a fortress probably of Parthian date. The gateway to the building was located in outline only, and con- sisted of large rectangular projecting towers flanking a narrow entrance. The main excavations were confined to the centre of the mound, where an area of about 40 ? 50 m was cleared. The uppermost level had been eroded and des- troyed by Islamic graves, and the latest building activity is represented by a thick wall running north-south, which, from the discovery of a coin and the evidence of the pottery, can be dated to the Sassanian/Pathian era. Architecture of the period around the beginning of the 2nd millennium is almost completely eroded, and from this period only a little pottery can be identified. The next level down is Akkadian in date, and in this period the mound was occupied by private houses including various workshops. Tell Abu Gubab (No. 62) Excavations were begun here in February 1978 by the State Antiquities Organi- zation under the Supervision of Sd. Ratib Faraj. The mound is oval, about 250 X 300 m, and stands 3 ? 75 m above the plain. A considerable area of the centre of the tell has been opened and three major building levels investigated. In the main area the highest level has only tauf walls and is only 90 cm in depth. Below this is a layer some 1 -90 m in depth with mud-brick walls (brick-size 40 X 40 ? 10 cm). In this level were three graves, of which one, containing an adult, was equipped with a curious pottery tray for suspension with three little cups standing on it, as well as a female figurine. In the third level, of a depth of nom, two further figurines of the same type were found. In a second area a courtyard building with small rooms at one side may have served as a stable, and in a third area on the north side of the mound 9 rooms of</page><page sequence="25">EXCAVATIONS IN IRAQ, 1977-78 165 another building were investigated. Apart from the usual glass and glazed ware of the Parthian/Sassanian period, this also yielded a pottery coffin 2 20 X 0-90 m. [Al-Athari 1978, No. 1, 36] Tell Abu Husaini (No. 35) This site to the south of Tell Yelkhi was investigated by the Iraqi-Italian Ex- pedition, directed by Dr. A. Invernizzi, in January to March and in June to July 1978. It is a large oval mound, 6 m high (though partly natural), with a sherd scatter covering an area approximately 300 ? 200 m. Houses of an 'Ubaid village lie on the slopes of the mound : these have small, rectangular or square rooms, their corners to the cardinal points, and belong to two consecutive levels. Many child burials were associated with the houses, often in large common-ware beakers. The objects are mostly in clay or stone ; no metal samples were recovered. The lithic industry is rather rich, axes and microliths being plentiful; for the latter, flint and sometimes obsidian are used. In clay, for example, are small animal figurines, spindle-whorls, and sling bullets. The decorated pottery is essentially represented by incised ware which finds good parallels at Nuzi ; painted pottery is rather scarce. The Abu Husaini village represents a single cultural stage as the phases of its existence must have followed closely one upon the other. It belongs to late 'Ubaid times, and its main features point to a northern 'Ubaid horizon. Tell Abu Qasim This small regular mound lies immediately west of the cemetery site of Kheit Qasim (No. 65) ; it is 2-80 m high and measures about 80 X 100 m. It was ex- cavated from June to August 1978 by Sd. Awad al-Kessar on behalf of the State Antiquities Organization, and work continues in 1979. Level I is represented by 26 Isin-Larsa/Old Babylonian graves, which had been dug into the surface, together with at least two ED Ill/Old Akkadian burials, one of which produced a terracotta bed model and, among other pottery, two moulded hemispherical bowls. These graves cut into a rectangular building of Level II which occupies the main part of the mound, and is built of rectangular bricks 28 ? 16 ? 8 cm which are the same as those in use at Kheit Qasim. The enclosure wall of the building was rebuilt up to three times without destroying the existing walls, each being built alongside the earlier one, so that the combined thickness is in places 6-50 m. The original wall still stands 2 m high, and has a series of holes through it which were effectively blocked when the later walls were erected. Within this enclosure are much thinner, unbonded walls, though more excavation is needed to clarify their layout. The building can be dated to ED I from the pottery, which is Scarlet Ware with specifically local features also found at Tell Madhhur, Tell Gubba and elsewhere. A 3 ? 4 m sounding within the confines of this building produced evidence of a third level with similarly sized bricks and similar pottery. A fourth level yielded in particular a fine grey burnished ware. Finally, although 'Ubaid pottery was present, no 'Ubaid building level was discerned.</page><page sequence="26">166 EXCAVATIONS IN IRAQ, I 977-78 Tell Abu Shiafeh (No. 39) Although the mound at Abu Shiafeh measures 240 m north-south, 170 m east- west, and stands 4 m high, much of this is a natural hill and the archaeological deposits are no more than 2 m in depth. Work at the site was directed on behalf of the State Antiquities Organization by Dr. Fawzy Rashid and then by Sd. Awad al-Kessar, between December 1977 and May 1978. An area of 40 ? 50 m was opened on the main high point at the north-east end of the tell, and this revealed walls about 2 m high belonging to a single building with only one level. The building is square, 30 ? 30 m, and built of bricks 43 ? 43 ? io cm. The outer walls are 1 -20-1 ?8? m thick, and have round towers at the four corners and in the middle of each side. The walls show several re-plasterings in mud plaster, and then (on the interior walls only) with gypsum plaster. The floors are gypsum plaster over a pebble hard-core. The entrance is in the south-east corner of the building through the south-east wall, and leads through an entrance room into the courtyard. There are eight rooms in all : along the south-west side are two long narrow rooms, presumably store-rooms, with another on the north-east side. The main courtyard has an iwan on the north-east side, on each side of which is niched decoration. Facing this is another deep iwan, 6 m deep, and in front of it two columns of baked brick with gypsum plaster and two semi-circular pilasters against the side-walls. In the north-west room were discovered 800 bullae with between one and twenty-five stamp seal impressions on each ; these were distributed throughout the fill but were especially numerous around small gypsum-plastered partitions, and more than 100 were found inside a square gypsum basin in one corner of the room. The designs of these seals fall into four main categories : (a) the bust of a man with or without a Pehlevi inscription round the circumference ; (b) abstract or floral designs ; (c) animals, e.g. birds, deer, scorpions, snakes, camels and oxen ; (d) a nude figure with a spear. Other finds of interest were a pair of copper tweezers and an Akkadian cylinder seal. Tell ar-Rubeidheh (No. 69) This is a low site on the gravelly edge of the alluvium on the south-west side of the Narin Chay, some 3 km north of the site Habbayeh. The main site consists of a sherd scatter some 150 X 125 m in extent ; behind this to the west are two smaller patches with prehistoric painted potsherds. During a 2-week period in April-May 1978, the British/Canadian expedition working at Tell Madhhur put some 2 m wide shallow trenches across the centre of the main mound. This disclosed that very little archaeological deposit survived except in one area where a sounding penetrated a 2 m deep rubbish tip rich in sherds and animal bones. The sherd material points unmistakably to the Late Uruk period, and since this is sparsely represented in the Hamrin basin, further work will be undertaken in 1979. Small trenches were also put into the two earlier mounds. Of these the northern one, with Halaf-style pottery, proved to be almost completely eroded, while the other, which consists of a hump left by wadi erosion, has a fair depth of deposit and some relatively early coarse painted 'Ubaid pottery. No coherent traces of buildings were identified at any of the three sites in the time available.</page><page sequence="27">EXCAVATIONS IN IRAQ, 1977-78 167 Tell as-Sara (No. 68) The site is represented by a large scatter of sherds on quite flat ground with local high-spots rising to 2 m above the alluvium, and it lies a little to the north of Tell Abu Husaini. The Iraqi-Italian Expedition, directed by Dr. A. Invernizzi, carried out excavations here during April 1978. A 7 X 14 m trench exposed walls probably belonging to a rural settlement and presenting two main architectural levels. A sequence of tannurs occupied a courtyard enclosed by two parallel tauf walls. The site dates to Late Sassanian or Early Islamic times. Tell as-Sib This is one of a group of three low mounds lying just east of Baradan (No. 29), the other two of which are inaccessible because of modern graves. It stands no more than 4 m high, and measures about 60 X 60 m. Excavations were begun here in 1978 for the State Antiquities Organization, directed by Sd. Hazim an-Nejefi and subsequently by Sd. Nail Hannoun M.A. Of Level I, of Parthian date, only a small fragment survives, and the top of the tell is mainly occupied by the foundations of buildings of Level II, of Old Babylonian date. The major part of the mound is composed of the walls and fill of Level III, which comprises at least three phases of Isin-Larsa occupation. Along the north- east side of the tell there is an enclosure wall, 3 -50 m thick, with shallow buttressing ; towards the west it probably turned a corner and enclosed the site on the south- west, but eastwards it continues without a return beyond the limits of the mound. A corridor ran along the inner face of the wall, separating it from a group of at least five independent buildings abutting one another. A street comes into this complex from the direction of Tell Haddad, the cemetery mound to the south-west. Some of the buildings are normal residential houses, but on the south-west is one apparently devoted to storage, with large vessels, and to the south-east is a group of rooms which may have been a scribal establishment, since from one room alone more than 200 cuneiform tablets were recovered. The majority of the tablets, which total about 400 in all, are of an administrative nature, but there are also some round school exercises ; some lumps of tablet clay were also found, and the furniture of the room included two rows of bricks and two platforms, perhaps indicating its use as a school. The tablets include a liver-omen text mentioning DaduSa, and there are various newly attested date-formulae. A variety of graves was excavated, including one brick-vaulted tomb in the corner of a room, which contained a distinctive flattened pottery flask. Below Level III are the tops of substantial walls belonging to Level IV, still awaiting investigation but evidently on an entirely different plan. Excavation continued from February 1979? [Al-Athari 1978, No. 1, 15-16] Tell ash-ShaHr (No. 19) The State Antiquities Organization began work here in October 1977 and continued for four months, under the direction of Dr. Muhammad Baqir al-Husseini. m 12</page><page sequence="28">168 EXCAVATIONS IN IRAQ, 1977-78 The site is about 2-50 m high, and measures 200 ? 50-70 m. Over two main occupation levels four separate architectural units were defined ; they kept to no regular pattern, and among them there were many ovens. The first unit has an incomplete courtyard plan, while another has an open iwan flanked by a room each side. Outside this unit a sounding was taken down 3-50 m, disclosing 9 successive stages of fill. Out of Level IV came a silver coin bearing the inscription of Mithra- dates II (c. 123-88 b.c.). [Al-Athari 1978, No. 1, 25-26] Tell as-Suleimeh (No. 12) Lying on the east side of the Diyala, some 5 km downstream from the town of Sa'adiyeh, the mound is one of the most prominent in the whole basin, being 14 -50 m high and measuring 240 m (N-S) by 280 m (E-W). Although there was a modern village on the site until 1958, the surface sherds pointed mainly to a 2nd millennium date (cf. R. McC. Adams, Land Behind Baghdad, 136 No. 7!). Excavations were started at the site in May 1977 by the State Antiquities Organi- zation under Sd. Rabia al-Qaisi and have continued almost without interruption into 1979, under Sd. Muhammad az-Zahawi, Sd. Salah Salman Rumeiyidh and Sd. Burhan Shakir. The first level encountered on the summit of the mound belongs to the Old Babylonian period and has several different phases. A number of rooms were uncovered on the north-east, of which Room 2 was the most important : this had a private altar in the western corner and another in the centre of the room, and contained as well as pottery, cuneiform tablets, terracottas and two metal bowls. The altar, like others found at the site, was of mud-brick with mud-plaster, but on the sides there was architectural decoration consisting of columns and recesses and an architrave. At this date there was a large courtyard at the centre of the tell ; most of the rooms to its south were lost, but to the north it was entered through a room giving onto another smaller courtyard. The doorway leading into this room from the north was decorated with buttresses and reveals, and provided with a large stone doorsocket, indicating the importance of the building which had once surrounded the large courtyard. To the east of this a staircase led down to another part of the building, also belonging to Level I, but already existing in Level IL For the most part the layout of the Level II buildings differed radically from that of Level I. It was however much better preserved, and more than 120 rooms were cleared, mostly belonging to large but independent houses. Most of the thresholds were paved with baked brick, and almost every house had a decorated altar (there are 9 examples in Level II). The most important part of the layout was to the south- east, where there was a large palatial building with more than 23 rooms, some of which were re-used to form part of the Level I building. On the south-west side of this complex was a brick-paved courtyard, giving access to the main reception room (Room 4), which had remains of black and red paint on the walls, and, behind it, to another room of almost equal size, with an elaborately decorated altar in the south-east corner. The investigation of Levels III and IV started in 1979 in an area of 1000 sq. m on the north-east side of the tell, and provisional results show that the layout changed with each level. Otherwise, earlier levels have been investigated only in a deep cut</page><page sequence="29">EXCAVATIONS IN IRAQ, 1977-78 169 on the north-east side of the mound, which descended through 11 levels to a depth of 9 m from the summit of the tell, and probably reached Early Dynastic levels with rectangular bricks (28 ? 14 ? 7 cm). Another sounding was made on the south- west flank, where a long trench met a superficial layer of Parthian occupation before penetrating Old Babylonian. Most finds come from Levels I and II, and in particular from as many as 80 graves in these levels ; they are characteristic of the Isin-Larsa and Old Babylonian periods. They include cylinder seals, some inscribed, 14 cuneiform tablets including some from the Dynasty of Eshnunna, elaborate hafted copper axes, an omphalos bowl and other copper or bronze artefacts. Among the pottery two jars with painted designs, including a goat, are unusual. [Al-Athari 1978, No. 1, 4-5] Tell Atiqeh (No. 54) This is the southernmost of the three sites near Uch Tepe village investigated by the Chicago-Copenhagen Expedition (director, Prof. McGuire Gibson), and lies between Tell Razuk and Tell Abu Shiafeh. It is an artificial tell standing some 4 - 50 m above the plain, and about 200 m in diameter. Apart from damage caused by housing of the Ottoman period, and a few sherds of Early Dynastic date, the site appears to be purely Akkadian. The main level was excavated at the north end of the mound, where a substantial rectangular courtyard building was uncovered, its walls from 1-1 -50 m thick and standing as much as 3 m high. Apart from the main room on one side of the courtyard, which has a plastered pedestal in its south- east corner, the rooms were principally of domestic character, containing ovens and storage bins. Many flints, including sickle blades still set into bitumen, were recovered, as well as a number of grinders and grindstones. Also notable was a range of " specialist " pottery, including sieves, funnels, and pots for suspension. From the centre of the courtyard a well-made pottery drain led out beneath the eastern wall. The entrance was from the south, and on this side there was also evidence of contemporary building, which may have formed part of the same complex. Above this main level there were two phases of later structures, still of Akkadian date. At this level also were two graves containing Akkadian cylinder seals as well as some pottery. Tell Ayyash (No. 17) This tell on the eastern side of the Diyala lies about 7 km south-west of Sa'adiyeh. It is oval in shape, about 85 m from south-east to north-west and about 60 m from south-west to north-east, and stands about 2 ? 25 m above modern plain level. Excavations were begun here in 1977 and continued until the summer of 1978, and were conducted by the College of Arts at Baghdad University under the direction of Dr. Walid al-Jadir and the supervision of Sd. Zuhair Rajib. At the centre of the mound a considerable area of housing in different levels was exposed, revealing separate domestic units with courtyards and a clear street. A sounding near the centre of the tell indicated that at least four major building levels of the 'Ubaid period are present ; but at a distance of about 45 m from the centre of the mound</page><page sequence="30">170 EXCAVATIONS IN IRAQ, 1977-78 four small soundings were put into the plain at the four points of the compass, and showed that archaeological deposits continue below the plain for at least 4 m, so that the actual height of the mound is more like 6 m, and its extent much greater than appears. An important collection of stratified late 'Ubaid pottery was recovered, stylistically later than the Tell Abbadeh material, but probably earlier than e.g. Tell Madhhur. [Al-Athari 1978, No. 1, 29-30] Tell az-%awiyeh (No. 23) Excavations were undertaken by the State Antiquities Organization, directed by Sd. Nadhir Abdullah, from June 1977 to April 1978. The mound stands 5 50 m above plain level, and has an area of about 9,000 sq. m. The river has cut away part of it on the north and east sides, and it has also been severely damaged by modern digging for brick material. A section was cut in the east bank of the Diyala and five building levels were identified. Level I was present only at the highest part of the tell, in the east, and was very badly destroyed. Remnants of tauf walls were observed, and small finds included tobacco pipes of the Ottoman period and coins of the 15th and 19th centuries a.d. The walls of Level II were of mud-brick, 30 X 20 X 6 cm, although again no complete plan survived. The floors yielded glazed and unglazed sherds, plus two fragments of barbotine ware (13-14^1 centuries a.D.). Level III survived only on the west of the tell. About 10 rooms were excavated from a rectangular building oriented north-south, with a courtyard at the south paved with baked bricks 35 X 35 X 6 cm. The court had an entrance in its south side, 1 -30 m wide, a brick drain on the east, and ovens and pottery hubbs still on the floor. At the eastern limit of this building three walls had been constructed, side by side, giving a total thickness of 4-50 m. The third wall is buttressed. There was evidence that the settlement was often flooded, and this may account for the series of walls and explain why there were no walls beyond them. Sherds and other objects date this level to the Old Babylonian period. Very similar in character to Level III is Level IV, in which three houses were exposed, though none was com- plete because of damage from pits. Brick size, sherds, and other objects are all comparable to Level III. The fifth level, which in the west was founded on virgin soil, consisted of four buildings of red mud-bricks, 32 X 32 X 6 cm or 34 ? 34 ? 6 cm, as well as many ovens. Graves, probably Old Babylonian and containing jewellery, cut the floors in several places. Building 4, which has a T-shaped plan and contained an incense burner, may have been a temple. From the floors of the other buildings were re- covered jars, figurines, a cylinder seal and some seal impressions. More than 50 graves were cleared during the season, all in the lowest three levels. [Al-Athari 1978, No. 1, 17-22] Tell Baradan (No. 29) This is the largest ancient mound to the west of the Diyala, measuring 300 X 200 m and standing as much as 30 m above plain level. The village and " artificial mount "</page><page sequence="31">EXCAVATIONS IN IRAQ, 1977-78 I7I are mentioned by C. J. Rich {Narrative of a Residence in Koordistan, I, 12 and II, 259, 313-4). Excavations were begun in June 1977 and continued till March 1978 under the direction of Sd. Abdullah Amin Agha on behalf of the State Antiquities Organi- zation. The first level dates to the Islamic period and is 70-85 cm in depth. A large plaster-lined cistern was uncovered measuring 6x3m and 1 -5 m deep; it was built of square bricks 20 X 20 X 5 cm, a size common in the Ilkhanid period. A ruined kiln was also excavated, and evidence of a drainage system was found. The main bulk of the high mound consists of the remains of a two-storey Parthian fort. On its upper storey the mission cleared 28 rooms divided into four parts by two central corridors at right-angles. The lower storey had the same corridors, but 48 rooms. The N-S corridor is 43 m in length, the E-W corridor 35 m. Both the ceilings and doors were very low, and may indicate its use as a prison. Three wells were cleared : one, at the centre of the mound, is 2 -50 m in diameter and probably Ilkhanid. Another in the south-west corner was built of bricks 32 X 32 x 6 cm, and a similar one was on the north side. Below the main mound the deposits lie 7-9 m above plain level, and slit trenches were dug on the north, east and west slopes of the site. Finds from the Islamic layer included large water-jars, glass flasks and pottery. From the Parthian building comes a headless gypsum statuette with marble hands, also some coins and terracotta figurines. [Al-Athari 1978, No. 1, 6-10] Tell Genj (No. 38) Excavations were conducted at Tell (or Kheit) Genj, about 1 km north-west of Uyun al-Kheshalat village, from December 1977 to January 1978, by a " splinter- group " from the Al-Hiba expedition, under the direction of Karen W. Briggs. A 10 m square was excavated, and asm sounding was taken down to virgin soil. Three levels of occupation were present, spanning a relatively brief period of time. A private house was uncovered and its plan, which remained the same in all three levels, was fairly simple and consisted of some 19 rooms or portions of rooms, their corners oriented to the cardinal points. A " living room " had a raised hearth in one corner and a low bench alongside. Another area consisted of a series of super- imposed ovens filled with ash. Belonging to Level III and excavated in the sounding was a simple rectangular room c. 2 ?8? ? 2 -30 m, preserved almost to its original height of over 2 m. This had been roofed with a crude mud-brick dome ; an arched doorway leads in from a long corridor to the south-west and two large niches were carved in the walls. This room had been filled with a mixture of ashy earth, innumerable potsherds, broken pieces of baked brick and stone tools ; among the sherds were discovered two small terracotta plaques. The plaques and the pottery both date the site to the Isin-Larsa period. The pottery is, in form, nearly identical to that from Eshnunna, although, in contrast to the Eshnunna pottery which is usually quite plain, a very high percentage of the Tell Genj sherds are decorated. Some have black painted decoration, though more common are incised or combed patterns, and this type of decoration is known</page><page sequence="32">172 EXCAVATIONS IN IRAQ, 1977-78 earlier in MB I in Palestine and in North Mesopotamia (e.g. at Tepe Gawra, Tell Taya, Tell al-Rimah). A sherd from Level III had the impression of a cylinder seal (showing a typical Isin-Larsa scene) rolled continuously over its surface. TellGubba (No. 31) The Japanese Archaeological Expedition to the Hamrin, directed by Prof. Hideo Fujii, began excavations at Tell Gubba in October 1977, and these will continue at least until July 1979. The tell measures some 85 ? 8o m, and is relatively steep, standing 8 m above the surrounding plain. The uppermost level, Level I, yielded about 500 Islamic burials with a high percentage of children. Level II consisted of three major architectural features : thin " casing walls ", outer walls, and a central building. The " casing walls " were?. 1-50 m thick and built of mud-bricks 33 X 33 ? io cm. They were exposed only on the north and east sides of the tell, and their relationship with the other structures is not yet clear. The outer walls, which are not aligned with the " casing walls ", are from bricks 47 x 25 X 10 cm, and form a rectangular enclosure esti- mated to be 32 X 27 m. Most elaborate is the east wall, which contains a gate and is decorated with niches at regular intervals ; this wall is pierced both in and between the niches by outward sloping holes, presumably arrow slits. A mud-brick bench with grooves cut into it at regular intervals was built against the north wall ; the south and west walls were badly weathered. The central building is almost square {c. 16 ? 15-50 m) and is located approximately in the middle of the en- closure formed by the outer walls; it is likewise of bricks 47 ? 25 X 10 cm. A small entrance penetrates the east end of the south wall, and three long parallel rooms are approached by a corridor to the south of the building. At regular intervals all around the outer faces of the walls are niches and holes similar to those in the eastern outer wall. Asm wide corridor runs all round the building between it and the outer walls, and in here were later erected small irregular rooms of tauf. Pottery, copper and iron vessels as well as clay objects were found in the building, the exact date of which is still to be determined. The architectural remains of Level III were very poorly preserved, though mention may be made of a well and an oven ; the pottery suggests a late Early Dynastic date. Level IV comprised two phases of ED I occupation each preserving about 10 small, rectangular rooms with ventilation grids beneath them, built of mud-bricks 30-35 ? 15-16 ? ? cm. The rooms were oriented round the old remains of the circular building (cf. Level VI), and many Scarlet Ware sherds came from the rooms closest to its centre. Some of the walls were built on a layer of reeds. The ED I remains of Level V also centre round the old circular building which was still standing some 1-1 -50 m above the ground at this time. More than 30 rooms of a type similar to Level IV were uncovered, and Scarlet Ware sherds were found in the corridors and between buildings. Especially noticeable from this level are cylinder seal impressions with geometric designs on the shoulders, rims or ribs of coarse ware jars. Level VI was dominated by a large round structure at the centre of the tell, consisting of a circular central core surrounded by several concentric walls. From</page><page sequence="33">EXCAVATIONS IN IRAQ, 1977-78 173 the centre of the core to the fifth concentric wall?the outermost so far exposed? is 11 m, although another fragmentary wall some 30 m to the south has been located and suggests that the overall diameter was at least 50 m. The central cylindrical core or platform has a diameter of 2 -8 m with a fire-pit c. 80 cm in diameter dug into it to a depth of 60 cm, in which thick layers of ash had accumulated. To the south was a staircase probably used to approach the top of the platform. The first concentric wall which has an entrance in the west forms an uneven corridor round the core, with its floor level about 2 m higher than the base level of the structure. The next wall is cut in the west and the south-east and so does not form a full circle. The third wall has a spur linking it to the second, and has a small opening in the north as well as a U-shaped projection ; a later addition to its exterior was a support- ing wall. Only a small portion of the fifth wall has so far been exposed, though on this part the inner face is adorned with niches at irregular intervals. So far only two entrances seem to lead to the outside of the building whilst another entrance gives access to a small vaulted corridor which stretches into the central core but is not yet fully cleared. Brick size for the structure is 27-28 X 14-15 X 7-9 cm. Except for a few stone objects, most of the finds are of pottery, notably polychrome and black monochrome ware. Crudely executed designs in brown or red paint are also reported from the lowest level and are reminiscent of Protoliterate wares from Khafajah. Tell Gurjiyeh A small tell, 2 m high and 80 ? 60 m across, lying about 2 km to the east of Tell Irsheideh (No. 28) on the western side of the Diyala. A short sounding was under- taken by the Irsheideh team, supervised by Tahsin Abdul-Wahhab. On the north side of the mound three brick-lined basins were found (? ?6? ? ? ? 10 m), lying on a platform of mud-bricks measuring 40 ? 40 X 10 cm, as well as the remains of five tannurs. Also, to the north-west of the platform there was a baked brick, gypsum plastered basin (di. 80 cm), and at 4 m to its west a baked brick water cistern(?), standing 1 -50 m high and with a diameter of 1 -6o m below and 1 ? 15 m above. Apart from very poor remains of house walls, the only other features were two brick vaults, the larger 5 ? ? -40 m, which may have been tombs. However, no traces of any burials were found, and the discovery of a quantity of carbonized wheat and barley near the foot of one wall suggests that they may rather have been grain stores. Finds, which assign the site to the Parthian/Sassanian period, include some complete jars and bowls of pottery, copper items, beads, and much iron. [Al-Athari 1978, No. 1, 38-39] Tell Hasan (No. 67) Tell Hasan is a small rounded mound, approximately 70 x70 m and 1 ? 50-2 m high (although the contours are not easy to follow because of interference by modern fields), lying between Tell Yelkhi and the village of Uyun al-Kheshalat. The Iraqi- Italian Expedition, directed by Dr. A. Invernizzi, excavated at the site in April 1978 and again from October 1978 into 1979.</page><page sequence="34">174 EXCAVATIONS IN IRAQ, 1977-78 The surface levels consist of poor occupation layers : floors marked by tannurs and fireplaces (shallow holes with a layer of pebbles at the bottom). 'Ubaid and Halaf sherds are found at the same time. These levels, as well as the Halaf levels beneath, were much disturbed by animal holes, graves of the Isin-Larsa/Old Babylonian period, and a large ditch. The Halaf village preserves a small round tholos and rectangular houses. All the walls are in tauf The Halaf painted pottery so far recovered displays quite late features, and the vessels, especially the bowls, are profusely decorated both inside and out ; polychrome decoration is also found. Tell Ibn Alwan The site is about 50 ? 40 m and stands only 1 m high. It lies between Tell Gurjiyeh and Tell Irsheideh. A short sounding, supervised by Sd. Tahsin Abdul- Wahhab, was undertaken by the Irsheideh team. The chief result was the discovery of a wall 2 -20 m thick stretching for a distance of 20 m on the east side of the tell, with at least four rounded towers of 4 ? 1 o m diameter. This suggests a military fort or police post. The finds dating the settlement to the Parthian/Sassanian period included pottery, especially a large decorated jar, a small glass jar and clay figurines. [Al-Athari 1978, No. 1, 39-40] Tell Imleihiyeh (No. 32) Work at this site near the village of Nuri al-Amin was begun by the German Archaeological Institute, Berlin in November 1978, under the direction of Dr. R. M. Boehmer, and continued into 1979 so that this is a provisional progress report. The site consists of a double tell with a total size of about 500 X 300 m, and stands 6 m above plain level. The highest part is however on a natural rise and the remains of a modern village lie on its surface. The mound was selected because surface sherds indicated a date in the Kassite period. Moreover, in November 1977, a villager digging an irrigation ditch un- earthed the remains of a large storage jar with ribbed decoration, which lay on top of another vessel, an ovoid flask, and some cuneiform tablets. Concerning these Dr. Fawzy Rashid kindly informs us that one of them mentions the 2nd or 3rd year of Ka?tilia?, very probably Ka?tilia? IV, indicating a date in the second half of the 13th century. A deep sounding was dug which shows that the site lies on a high natural mound ; a second deep sounding in the west, closer to the Narin, should provide answers to some geological problems. So far, building remains have hardly been encountered, although more or less well preserved graves lie directly beneath the surface. One grave had, among other goods, a small faience situla still clasped in the dead person's hand. There is a good parallel to this from a Kassite context at Babylon and from a Larsa/Old Babylonian grave at Ur. In one place there were some architectural remains, close below the surface. They are the remains of a wall of square mud-bricks 31 X 31 X 5 cm, and the rem- nants of an oven. Near the latter was a destroyed pithos, an ovoid flask, and the foot of a tall thin flask.</page><page sequence="35">EXCAVATIONS IN IRAQ, 1977-78 175 Provisionally it remains uncertain whether Imleihiyeh represents a burial mound of the Kassite period, or the site of a Kassite village in which house burials were the custom. The architecture of the settlement, except for scant remains, has been lost through erosion and the frequent flooding of the area. Tell Irsheideh (No. 28) The mound is on the west side of the Diyala, about 1 km south of the village of Jaghat, and it stands 4-65 m above the plain level to the south-east, measuring about 125 X 80 m. Excavations were undertaken here by the State Antiquities Organization, directed by Sd. Adnan Muhsin, during 1977 and 1978. The centre of the mound is occupied by a solid platform of Parthian date, built of bricks 45 X 45 X 15 cm. This platform (Level I) rests upon earlier brickwork belonging to Level II and standing up to 1 -70 m high. The south wall of this earlier construction has a regularly buttressed fa?ade on the outside, and a door- way blocked by bricks identical with those in the platform indicates that the Level II building was deliberately cut down and filled in to provide an emplacement for Level I. The Level II fa?ade has four buttresses and recesses, each side of an arched doorway 1 m wide and 1 -50 m high ; to the east of the door is an arched window in the centre of a recess. The length of the fa?ade is 16? 60 m, the buttresses being 1 -io m and the recesses 3-30 m in width. After clearance of all four sides, the dimensions of the platform of Level I were 35-80 ? 37 -8o m. On the north, west and east sides it stands more than 4 m high, with buttresses. A 5 X 5 m sounding was dug through the centre of the platform and reached virgin soil at about 4 m below. Beyond the limits of the platform were at least two levels of occupation ; the upper, belonging with the Level I platform, and the lower Level II, although its walls were reused in Level I. On the east side of the platform were three round pottery kilns, two of them in an excellent state of preservation, 1 ? 90 m in diameter and 1 -50 m high. The base of the kilns has holes for fuel, and obvious traces of burning ; pottery was found within them. The rooms of Level II were better preserved than those in Level I, and are arranged round a courtyard on three sides ; to the north all traces of the walls are lost. The largest room is Room 14, 9-50 ? 5 oo m, on the east side of the courtyard. Graves were found in various places : a double jar burial beneath the courtyard wall of Room 16 ; in Room 8 under its west wall, a child burial with three jars ; and in Room 15 four Parthian graves dug from above into the Level II floor. The usual pottery and artefacts were found, including terracottas, pottery and copper lamps, and spindle whorls. [Al-Athari 1978, No. 1, 12-14] Tell Khallaweh (No. 52) This important mound was excavated by the College of Arts of Mosul University, under the direction of Dr. Adii Abbu, beginning in February 1978 and continuing in 1979. It lies some 12 km to the south-east of Qara Tepe village, and together with Tell Yelkhi is one of the major sites in the area. Pottery on the surface indicates</page><page sequence="36">I76 EXCAVATIONS IN IRAQ, 1977-78 a Parthian occupation, but any architecture of that date has been eroded, except for gypsum basins which are connected with pottery pipes, and the occasional pit. The major occupation of the site is during the Isin-Larsa and Old Babylonian periods. A considerable sector of a town plan has been recovered from the highest Old Babylonian level. Some rooms show evidence of vaulted roofs, supported on small buttresses, and there is a decorated altar of a type encountered at Tell as- Suleimeh. Other finds include cylinder seals, good quality copper axes, and some cuneiform tablets. Terracotta figurines are also found, and include a model boat. More than 28 graves have been excavated, also of the Old Babylonian period, and the grave goods include pottery, copper or bronze items, and necklaces. Tell Madhhur (No. 64) Excavations were begun here in December 1977 by the British Archaeological Expedition to Iraq in collaboration with the Royal Ontario Museum, under the direction of Dr. T. C. Young, Jr., and J. N. Postgate. Work continued into May 1978, and was restarted in October 1978, with R. G. Killick and M. D. Roaf as Field Directors. The tell is little more than 2-50 m above plain level, although virgin soil lies 4 m deep below the alluvium, and the visible mound is less than 100 m in diameter. It lies about 1 km west of the village of Keshkul al-Kebir, and was chosen for the 'Ubaid pottery on the surface, although other periods are also represented. The core of the mound is a solidly constructed building of the late 'Ubaid period, its walls standing 2 m high. Most of the rooms are filled with a clean bricky soil, but close to the floors is a layer of burning, which includes pottery, stone and clay domestic artefacts, and in one area large amounts of carbonized barley (which has yielded a C-14 date of 5570 ? 55 bp [BM-1458], calibrated after Clark to become 4470 ? 80 B.c.). The eastern half of the building is under investigation at the time of writing. Below its floors are some traces of earlier occupation levels, and on the west side of the mound at least there is evidence for at least one major level of later 'Ubaid occupation, including ovens and other domestic fittings. Most of the upper 'Ubaid level was, however, sliced off when the site was reoccu- pied in the Early Dynastic period. As a result of erosion the walls of this period survive only at the centre of the mound (in an area about 30 ? 30 m), but these provide evidence for at least four building phases. Apart from some rectangular rooms, there is a curving range of rooms or partitions enclosing a courtyard area in which there is a rectangular platform supported on parallel rows of bricks and associated with a hearth. Scarlet Ware and other contemporary pottery, in parti- cular the sealed rims of coarse jars, date this level to ED I (cf. Tell Gubba Level V). Subsequently the site was again deserted and at least three graves have been excavated belonging to the late ED and Akkadian periods. One had lost the human skeletons, but contained several large pottery jars and the remains of two donkeys ( ?) ; the Akkadian grave was largely undisturbed and yielded 48 pots, copper implements, jewellery, and another pair of equids, probably donkeys. Remains of a probable third grave nearby included one Late Akkadian cylinder seal and a fine miniature copper adze.</page><page sequence="37">EXCAVATIONS IN IRAQ, 1977-78 177 There was also an Islamic occupation of the site, any houses from which are entirely lost although sherds survive on the surface and in rubbish pits, as well as a gypsum-lined brick basin. Tell Nebi Ismail (No. 22) This site lies on a small canal called Nahar az-Zawiyeh, in an area of cultivation. The mound is circular, with a diameter of c. 70 m, and a height of 1 ? 75 m. Exca- vations were conducted here by the State Antiquities Organization in 1978, directed by Sd. Fadhil Madhloom and Sd. Muhammad Ajaj. Three residential units were distinguished in the first level, with hearths, ovens and water jars in situ. Four ovens were found, in addition to ordinary tannurs ; one of them had been used for lime and the other three for pottery. In the 2nd level two main residential units were excavated, separated by a street 3 ? 50 m wide. The first unit had 16 rooms round a courtyard 13*50 X 6-50 m, in which there were hearths and tannurs. There were 23 rooms in the second unit, mostly used in two distinct phases. Finds included glazed and unglazed pottery, glass vessels, a black incense-burner with decoration of triangles on the exterior, and a silver coin of the king Bahram IV (a.d. 388-399). Graves included a child's grave in a single jar, one double jar burial, and a pottery coffin 3-83 ? o -45 m and o -55 m high, decorated on the exterior with a band of spirals. [Al-Athari 1978, No. 1, 27-28] Tell Rashid (No. 3) The site lies at the extreme south-east corner of the area to be flooded, about 13 km south of Tell Abbadeh and close to the Old Babylonian site of Umm Salim. While working at Abbadeh, Sd. Sabah Abboud undertook a small sounding in May 1978. The mound measures 70 ? 55 m, and stands 2 -50 m high. A wide trench was put through the centre of the tell from north to south, revealing three main levels of occupation consisting of small rectangular houses of the 'Ubaid period. In Level III one house had a buttressed wall and a T-shaped courtyard. In a test pit on the north side of the mound a fourth 'Ubaid level was also identified. The pottery and other materials from the site closely resemble those of Tell Abbadeh. Tell Razuk (No. 53) The mound stands about 4 m above the plain, is up to 250 m in diameter, and lies some 500 m west of Uch Tepe village, between Ahmed al-Mughir and Tell Atiqeh. It was excavated from September 1978 to March 1979 by the Chicago- Copenhagen Expedition under the direction of Prof. McGuire Gibson. Excavations began at the highest point, on the east side, and revealed here a round building, 27 m in diameter, with buttresses at 5 m intervals on the exterior, and standing at least 3 -50 m high. It is built of rectangular mud-bricks of different sizes, and in places a mud-brick roof constructed by various methods of vaulting remains intact. In plan the building consists of a ring of rooms round an open courtyard which contained ovens. Access to the building was from the north-west, and this door also led into a narrow stairway or ramp which leads round up to the roof.</page><page sequence="38">178 EXCAVATIONS IN IRAQ, 1977-78 On the floors, which have so far been reached in only a few places, much pottery and other artefacts, including copper weapons and Scarlet Ware sherds, were found, dating the building to the ED I period. Beneath the circular building there are remains of earlier structures, but these are at present below water level and their date cannot be determined. Outside the circular building are houses in at least two levels contemporary with it, with straight walls but radiating from the main building. Beyond these houses, on the west side, mud-brick 4 m in width may possibly indicate an enclosure wall with entrance. There is very little later occupation of the site, but some intrusive pits and graves of the Isin-Larsa and mediaeval Islamic periods. Tell Rihan This name has been assigned to a small site some 3 km north of Tell ar-Rubeidheh, on the south-west side of the Narin Chay. It consists of a scatter of sherds some 50 m in diameter lying on the natural gravelly ridge which delimits the alluvial land. Three small soundings were put into the site by the Chicago-Copenhagen Ex- pedition, directed by Prof. McGuire Gibson, and taken to a depth of 80 cm before the weather made the site inaccessible. No structures were encountered, but the excavated sherds confirm the evidence of the surface collection that this was a Samarran site. Bowls and jars were incised or painted in red or brown, and show general resemblances to material from Choga Marni. Tell Sabra (No. 66) The Belgian Archaeological Mission directed by Prof. L. de Meyer with M. H. Gasche carried out excavations at Tell Sabra during the spring and autumn of 1978. It is a small site, about 70 ? 100 m, and stands barely 4 m above the surrounding plain, south of the main village of Mahmuleh. In order to determine the stratigraphie units of the tell and their relationship to the outer geological context a trench about 35 m long was dug from the centre of the tell into the plain on the west; later this was widened at its north end and became Sounding A. A second area, Sounding B, was opened in the east centre of the tell. In addition to these soundings smaller test pits were dug in several places on the mound and in the surrounding plain. The archaeological deposits do not represent the whole height of the present visible mound ; under a relatively thick surface formation the archaeological deposits only represent a thickness of 1 -50 m at the most. The bottom of them lies about 2 m above the present plain level on a thick aeolian layer, which itself covers loamy and clayey alluvial sediments. From top to bottom the following periods can be enumerated : 1. Surface formation connected with an Islamic cemetery. 2. Parthian-Seleucid occupation consisting of destroyed and eroded remains of quite substantial buildings of which mostly only one or two courses of the foundations are extant. 3. Late Early Dynastic occupation, partially removed during the laying of the Parthian-Seleucid foundations. This occupation lies on a probably natural</page><page sequence="39">EXCAVATIONS IN IRAQ, 1977-78 179 loamy sandy layer, 10-30 cm thick, under which an earlier ED occupation is attested, characterized by Scarlet Ware. 4. According to geological observations, the above-mentioned aeolian layer belongs to the end of the Pleistocene or beginning of the Holocene. Tell Sungur (No. 42) Not far from Tell Gubba is a group of three mounds known as Tell Sungur, which have been labelled A, ? and C by the Japanese Archaeological Expedition directed by Prof. Hideo Fujii. Sungur A is an oval mound, 190 X 140 m and rising to about 3 m above plain level. Soundings were made in three parts of the mound. In the southern and central part the deposits had suffered from heavy weathering, and all that survived of note is a burial and three painted 'Ubaid pots from the southern sounding. In a sounding in the northern part of the mound over 200 Islamic and 4 Old Babylonian graves were cleared. One of the latter had a mud-brick wall along one side, pottery by the feet, the bones of a decapitated small animal between the pots and the deceased, and two copper arrow-heads. Despite damage inflicted by the burials, sufficient architectural remains survived to identify five similar rectan- gular buildings each measuring 8 ? 3 -50 m. Their walls were built of a single row of mud-bricks measuring 38 ? 19 ? 7 cm, and so only 19 cm wide. These structures were divided into smaller square rooms and strengthening buttresses had been added at the four corners and the intersections of the dividing walls with the outer walls. The associated pottery was hand-made, often with incised zig-zag patterns ; painted specimens were rare. A few stone implements were recovered, and the assemblage must be assigned to the Samarran period. Sungur B. Work began here in November 1977. It is an oval mound, 50 ? 60 m and 2 m above plain level. A sounding near the highest point identified four levels, with virgin soil at about 2 -50 m below the plain. Level I was particularly represented on the southern slope, and produced two ditches, one of which was about 2 m wide, 2 m deep, and over 50 m in length, and filled with numerous sherds and stone implements. To the south of these ditches was a concentration of kilns, of which one cylindrical example was almost complete with its pierced horizontal dividing wall intact. On the basis of the pottery, Level I can be assigned to the 'Ubaid period. Level II produced the remains of two buildings. A rectangular house on the east side of the mound had tauf walls and gypsum floors, with a pebbled pathway 1 ? 20 m wide and 7 m long to the north. The other building, to the west, was smaller, and had a symmetrical plan with a cross-shaped room at the centre. It also had tauf walls, gypsum floors and a pebbled path to the north. It seems possible that these buildings were of a public nature. Both Halaf and 'Ubaid sherds came from this level. Excavation of Level III is in progress, although at the time of writing at least seven small rooms c. ? ? ? m have been located in a building in the west. The pottery seems to be late Halaf. No architectural remains have yet been encountered in Level IV, and the pottery again seems to be late Halaf. Throughout Level I?III</page><page sequence="40">?8? EXCAVATIONS IN IRAQ, I977-78 some 80 graves of later periods were cleared, mostly dating to the Old Babylonian period, although some are Islamic, Parthian, and Jamdat Nasr. Sungur C. Excavations in this mound to the north of Sungur ? were begun in. February 1978. The tell is 80 X 30 m, and stands only 1 m above the plain ; virgin soil lies at 1 *6o m below plain level. So far only one level has been recognized, and the single building recovered from it is square in plan, 15 ? 15 m. The southern end of the structure has been eroded by a stream. Its tauf walls are c. 75 cm wide and each room is about 2-3 m square. The rooms variously contain gypsum floors, ovens and door sockets. The pottery is in an early 'Ubaid style, the painted designs figuring many animal motifs in- cluding snakes, goats, water birds etc. Numerous stone implements?blades and microliths?were found, the obsidian much less common than the flint. Tell Yelkhi (No. 36) The Iraqi-Italian Expedition, directed by Dr. A. Invernizzi, carried out ex- cavations at Tell Yelkhi from October 1977 to June 1978, and continues work in 1979. The main mound is a large oval tell, approximately 220 ? 170 m at its base ; its top, 13 m high, is offset to the east. Other sites in the Yelkhi area investigated by the Iraqi-Italian Expedition are Tell Hassan, Abu Husaini and Tell as-Sara. On the summit a large Kassite building was uncovered, marked by large rooms, thick walls and particularly deep foundations. It underwent at least two phases of substantial repair. These remains were cut into by an extensive Islamic cemetery of very recent date. From the Old Babylonian period we find a sequence of levels, the latest of these being distinguished by many pottery kilns. However, the most important building of the Old Babylonian period is a small, rectangular " temple " which is completely isolated from the rest of the town by having streets on all four sides. It has a very small hall, a courtyard and a large room backed by a second, narrow one and open- ing onto the courtyard. A very small room, containing an altar and a round "offering table ", opens onto the side of the entrance. Cuneiform tablets were found associated with this building. The deepest level reached so far belongs to the end of the Isin-Larsa or beginning of the Old Babylonian period. Here portions of two large structures were found. The northern one of these should prove to be an important building as a narrow storeroom was found, full of large pithoi ; these point to some connection with the public administration. Graves of the early Kassite period are distinguished by thin mud walls lining the pit, while the older burials are usually a simple pit for the adults and pot burials for the children. Apart from the tablets, the site was rich in finds, the pottery is especially plentiful. A report is scheduled to appear in Mesopotamia 14 (1979). Tulul al-Khubari (No. 15) A group of mounds on the east side of the Diyala, between the modern road and the railway, and a couple of kilometers south of Tell as-Suleimeh. The investigation</page><page sequence="41">EXCAVATIONS IN IRAQ, 1977-78 181 of them was begun during summer 1978 under the direction of Sd. Fadhil Madhloom on behalf of the State Antiquities Organization, and it continues during 1979. There are three principal mounds, but excavation was concentrated on tell No. 1, which stands about 2-50 m high and is some 50 m in length. Its upper level is of Parthian date, and is represented by a mud-brick platform. Below this are the remains of a fort with mud-brick walls 2 ? 50 m thick, and semicircular towers round the exterior on all sides except the east. Within the wall are 14 rooms, and up to 26 more were identified outside it. The entrance to the building had been blocked by brickwork of the later phase. The floors are gypsum plastered and the plan consists essentially of two iwans each side of a small courtyard. The building probably dates from the Achaemenid or Parthian period. A second mound also yielded Parthian remains in its upper levels, but at its south side a 4 ? 3 m sounding was taken down 7 -20 m to water level, and Level IV contained late 'Ubaid painted pottery. Tulul Greish (No. 51) A group of three small mounds lying to the east of Tell Khallaweh. During summer 1978, soundings were put into all three mounds by Sd. Jabbar Khawwas on behalf of the State Antiquities Organization. This revealed on each one superficial remains of the Ilkhanid period, overlying Parthian levels. Excavation did not penetrate to virgin soil.</page></plain_text>
