<plain_text><page sequence="1">Vetus Testamentum XLIII, 1 (1993) KENITES = RECHABITES?: 1 CHRONICLES II 55 RECONSIDERED by C.H. KNIGHTS Chichester It is almost invariably the case that Old Testament scholars have taken it for granted that 1 Chron. ii 55 links the Rechabites and the Kenites with each other. Karl Budde, for instance, used the verse to support his contention that the origins of the Rechabites, like the origins of the Kenites, were very ancient.1 S. Abramsky used it to claim that the Rechabites and the Kenites lived in close proximity to each other,2 while Frick, Gray and Gottwald have all used it as part of their argument that the Rechabites, like the Kenites, were itinerant metalworkers.3 None of these scholars, however, has offered a full exegesis of the verse, in order to demonstrate precisely how it is supposed to prove that the Rechabites and the Kenites were connected. Commentators on the books of Chronicles, such as Rudolph, Myers and Williamson,4 have tended to view the verse as being difficult, and are cautious about arriving at a definite con- clusion as to its meaning. A very few scholars, such as S. Klein, have concluded that 1 Chron. ii 55 contains no mention of the Rechabites at all.5 Obviously, this verse is an important one for assessing the rela- tionship between the Rechabites and the Kenites, who are not con- nected anywhere else in the Hebrew Bible. If 1 Chron. ii 55 does 1 "The Nomadic Ideal in the Old Testament", New World 4 (1895), p. 728. 2 "House of the Rechabites-Genealogy and Social Character", Eretz-Yisrael 8 (1967), p. 255 (Hebrew). 3 F.

If, however, the verse does not mention the Rechabites, or link them with the Kenites, then a serious question mark appears over any view which seeks to connect the two groups, or to interpret one of the groups by means of data proper to the other. The purpose of this present article, then, is to undertake a full and detailed exegesis of 1 Chron. ii 55, in an attempt to elucidate its true meaning. The Massoretic Text of our verse reads: umispehot soperzm ysbw yaCbes tircdtm simadtim sukdtzm hemma haqqnzfm habbda zm mehammat 'abf bet-rekdb The families also of the scribes that dwelt at Jabez, the Tirathites, the Shimeathites and the Sucathites. These are the Kenites who came from Hammath, the father of the House of Rechab (Revised Standard Version). Textually, none of the Versions, with the exception of the Old Latin, presents a different text from that represented by the MT. As S. Talmon has shown,6 the LXX readings ex ,.airlip. (Vaticanus) or e 0atIoiaO (Alexandrinus) reveal a Vorlage identical with the MT, i.e. mhmt. The omission of the final P by LXXB is slightly curious, especially as it is Codex B (and Lucian) that reads pYxoa in 1 Chron. iv 12, where the other LXX manuscripts read pla. It should, however, be noted that in 2 Sam. iv 2, 5, 6, 9, LXX-B reads pqxap throughout, whereas B, after reading pX3ap in v. 2, then reads exxo; in vv. 5-9. This suggests that LXXB regarded rkb and rkh as interchangeable variants of the same name, and not as two different names. There is a Kethib/Qere variant in the MT of the verse, the Kethib reading ydaeb, the Qereyojsebe. The Vulgate's "habitantium in" is probably a translation of the Qere, rather than evidence of a preposi- tion in Jerome's Hebrew text. The Old Latin's "Hi sunt qui venerunt de Calore domus patris Rechab" for the last sentence of the verse is probably due to translational error: hqynym has been lost by Homoioarcton, the translator's eye having jumped from the initial h of hqynym to the 6 "1 Chron. 2:55", IEJ 10 (1960), pp. 174 ff.</page><page sequence="3">C. H. KNIGHTS initial h of hb'ym. The fact that both words end in -ym may have facilitated this process. The translator then understood hb'ym m as a geographical term, correctly, as will be argued below, but then thought that hmt (= "Calore", cf. Ps. xix 7) was a place name, rather than a personal name. This made the following 'by byt rkb somewhat ridiculous, and so he inverted the 'by and the byt to make the verse say that the father of Rechab, as well as the Tirathites, Shimeathites and Sucathites, came from Hammath. The Targum to the verse is really a piece of Midrash, and so ascertaining its precise underlying Hebrew text is impossible, but it seems probable that it was identical with the MT. The Peshitta has nothing corresponding to ii 55 in its text of 1 Chronicles. It is thus clear that there are no textual variants which witness to a Hebrew text different from that found in the MT of 1 Chron. ii 55. With that established, a word-by-word analysis of the verse may be undertaken. (i) wmsphwt sprym: as it stands in the MT, sprym is vocalized as soperim, "scribes". Klein saw this as evidence for the existence of scribes in the pre-exilic period; Kittel thought it denoted scribes in the post-exilic sense.7 G. Richter was of the opinion that the necessary settledness of the scribal profession was incompatible with the nomadic life-style of the Rechabites, and emended sprym to hadisurim, which he rendered as "The Abstainers", i.e. the Rechabites.8 However, the Qal passive participle of the root :sr is generally used of being bound in prison, fetters, etc. Only in Num. xxx does the root 'sr appear with a figurative meaning, denoting the obligation of an oath or vow, but the passive participle is not used there to denote one who has taken such a vow and, in any case, Num. xxx has nothing to do with the Rechabites. It seems a highly dubious exercise to emend sprym into a word which has a meaning otherwise unattested in Biblical Hebrew. It is also had to see how h'swrym could have become corrupted into sprym. More feasible is Rudolph's proposal (pp. 22, 25) to read siprim, with the meaning "men of Kiriath-sepher", for soperim. It is unlikely that scribes ever lived in one single place-and a remote one at that (abez is only mentioned elsewhere in 1 Chron. iv 9-10, 7 Klein, p. 415; R. Kittel, Die Bicher der Chronik (G6ttingen, 1902), p. 20. 8 "Untersuchungen zu den Geschlechtsregister der Chronik", ZA W34 (1914), pp. 165-6. 12</page><page sequence="4">KENITES = RECHABITES?: 1 CHRONICLES II 55 RECONSIDERED 13 where it is a personal, not a place, name). As Rudolph puts it, "Schriftgelehrte wird man nicht zuerst in einem Landheim suchen" (p. 25). While it is true that some occupational groups in ancient Israel did live together as craft guilds, this cannot have been true of the scribes, for whom dispersion throughout other places of business and trade was of the essence of their craft. That sprym appears here without the definite article would be more readily explicable if it were a gentilic rather than the title of an occupational group. Kiriath-sepher was a Calebite city (Josh. xv 13-14; Judg. i 11-12), and 1 Chron. ii 55 occurs within the context of a Calebite genealogy (cf. ii 18-20, 50a-55). Hence, Rudolph's proposed change in pointing seems plausible, and is followed here. msphwt sprym is understood as "the clans of the Sepherites". (ii) ysbw: it seems preferable to follow the Qere, as the Kethib entails understanding or inserting a b before the following ybs. ysby y'bs stands in apposition to the preceding wmsphwt sprym. (iii) yCbs: as noted above, "Jabez" reappears only in iv 9-10, where it is a personal name. Despite the rabbinic traditions under- standing "Jabez" as a personal name in ii 55 also, it is evident that it is intended to be a place name here also, even if its location is yet to be identified. Within the biblical genealogies, there is often a degree of fluidity between personal and place names. The place Jabez may have been in Judah. (iv) trCtym smCtym swktym: none of these three names is elsewhere attested. Klein made a brave attempt to discover South Judaean place names in them, an attempt which is more ingenious than con- vincing (pp. 412-13). The Vulgate and Kittel (p. 20) both argue that they denote occupations, but in so doing they are simply following rabbinic Haggadic exegesis, which is unlikely to have had a basis in historical reality. It seems best to follow Rudolph, and to view these names as clan names and nothing more. (v) hmh hqynym: there is virtual unanimity among scholars that hqynym denotes the Kenites (usually haqqenzm). As Abramsky puts it, "there is no reason for not identifying the Kinites of this text with the Kenites" (p. 255). The hmh clearly indicates that only a portion of the tribe of the Kenites is being referred to, viz. the three named clans. (vi) hb'ym m(n): elsewhere in the Old Testament, the root bw' fol- lowed by min seems to have had a usage that was literally spatial. It is used of individuals, e.g. of Jacob coming from Paddan Aram</page><page sequence="5">C. H. KNIGHTS (Gen. xxxiii 18); of communities (cf. 2 Sam. xv 18); of the elements (water, 2 Kings iii 20; a storm, Isa. x 3; smoke, Isa. xiv 31); of YHWH, or God, in anthropomorphic imagery (cf. Isa. lxiii 1; Hab. iii 3); and of wisdom (ob xxviii 20). It is used of a "word" in 2 Sam. xv 28, but again the meaning is spatial: the "word", i.e. a message, would have to be brought by someone. Deut. xxxii 17 should be excluded from consideration, as the sense "recently" applies to mqrwb as a combined preposition. Thus, it seems that there is no metaphorical use of bw' followed by mn elsewhere in the Old Testament, which makes it unlikely that its use in 1 Chron. ii 55 is genealogical in meaning. Abramsky compares the use of hb'ym m(n) here with that of hb'ym bsmwt in 1 Chron. iv 38, and suggests that they both mean the same as hnmnym, "that were numbered" (p. 256). Talmon, who thinks that hmt is a construct noun meaning "family-in-law" (see below), argues that, just as bw' followed by '1 in 1 Chron. ii 21, and probably also ii 24 (see the LXX), denotes the marital kin-ties between the Calebites and the inhabitants of Gilead and Ephrath, by the "male" element, i.e. the Calebites, moving into the territory of the "female" element, so bw' followed by mn in ii 55 reveals that, in the case of the Calebite-Kenite alliance, the "female" partner, i.e. the Kenites, moved into the ter- ritorial domain of the "male" partner, i.e. the Rechabites (p. 178). In the light of the usage of bw '+ mn elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible, both these arguments seem spurious. In particular, it is difficult to understand how "the Kenites who came from ... the father of the House of Rechab" (if we leave hmt aise for the moment) can denote the movement of the Kenites into Rechabite territory. Also, if bw' followed by I may denote the consummation of a marriage then, surely, if it did have a metaphorical meaning, bw' followed by mn would have to denote the very opposite, i.e. divorce? Usage, however, suggests that, in fact, the meaning of hb ym m(n) in 1 Chron. ii 55 has nothing to do with genealogy and kinship ties at all, but with geography, as in all the other places in the Hebrew Bible where bw' is followed by mn. It denotes a group of Kenites who were once in some sort of geographical proximity to hmt 'by byt rkb (however that phrase is understood), but at some stage have moved to another dwelling place; hence they may be said to have "come from" hmt 'by byt rkb. This observation, seemingly unnoticed by other commentators, that hb'ym m(n) in 1 Chron. ii 55 has nothing to do with genealogy, 14</page><page sequence="6">KENITES = RECHABITES?: 1 CHRONICLES II 55 RECONSIDERED 15 but with geography, already renders untenable those views which have seen the Rechabites as a Kenite clan. As the verse is to with geographical, not kinship, links, the view of Abramsky, that this verse demonstrates that the Rechabites and the Kenites lived in close proximity to each other (p. 255), may perhaps seem to be the correct one. The rest of this study of 1 Chron. ii 55 will, however, suggest not only that the verse does not link the Kenites and the Rechabites genealogically, but also that a good case can be made for arguing that it does not, in fact, refer to the Rechabites at all, but to the place from which this group of Kenites came. (vii) hmt: the Versions and most commentators understand hmt either as a personal name, or else as a place name. Thus, LXXB reads ex i£or7iar (rendering the m prefix twice over-translating it (ex), and then transliterating it (iE) ), evidently understanding it as a personal name, as elsewhere in the OT; when Hammath appears as a place name, it is rendered in the Greek by E£i±a6O or a[Ia60, which is adopted by LXXA here, evidently understanding Ham- math as a place name, presumably the well-known Hammath in Naphtali (Josh. xix 35). 'by byt rkb, however, makes little sense after a place name, and so Talmon seeks to derive (m)hmt, as a noun in the construct state, from the root hm(h), and proposes the existence of a noun hemt, meaning "family", especially denoting the relationship between a husband's family and his wife. He cites the use of hm, meaning hus- band's father in relation to his son's wife, ten times in the book of Ruth. He also mentions that an equivalent noun can be found in both Akkadian and Syriac (pp. 176-7). The New English Bible follows Talmon's lead, and renders this half of the verse as "these were the Kenites who were connected by marriage with the ancestor of the Rechabites". Talmon further argues thatJehonadab the son of Rechab (2 Kings x 15, 16, 23;Jer. xxxv) was so well known that the author of 1 Chron. ii 55 did not feel it necessary to mention him by name. Objections may be raised to Talmon's interpretation. First, such a noun is not attested elsewhere in the Old Testament genealogies; if it were a well-established term, its appearance elsewhere in the lists would be expected. Secondly, it has already been shown that bw' followed by mn had a purely spatial meaning for the biblical writers, and so it cannot have the meaning ascribed to it by Talmon. Thirdly, is it really true to say that Jonadab ben Rechab</page><page sequence="7">C. H. KNIGHTS would have been so well known that his name would not be required in such a genealogical list? While it is true, as Budde pointed out (p. 727), that the author of 2 Kings x 15-16 evidently believed that his readers would already be familiar with Jonadab, it is also true that what is permitted in narrative is not permitted in genealogy, where names are all-important. Talmon cites 1 Chron. viii 29, "the father of Gibeon dwelt in Gibeon, and the name of his wife was Maacah", as evidence for the omission of a father's name in a genealogy (p. 178); but 1 Chron. viii 29 has a doublet in ix 35, where the name of the father of Gibeon does appear, and so it has either fallen out of viii 29 by accident,9 or else the compiler has deliberately omitted it in viii 29, as it, was going to appear in ix 35. There is no such doublet to ii 55. (viii) 'by: "father" is capable of a broad range of meanings in the Old Testament, and ascertaining its correct meaning here is by no means straightforward. However, the formula, "X the father of Y" is common in the genealogical lists in Chronicles. Particularly illuminating for the present purposes are 1 Chron. ii 52-3 and iv 5 ff., where X is recorded as having offspring, but his offspring do not include Y. Thus, in ii 52-3 Shobal is recorded as being the father of Kiriath-jearim; but his sons are called Haroeh and "half of the Menuhoth", while in iv 5 ff., Asshur is the father of Tekoa, but none of his seven children is called Tekoa. These two texts strongly suggest that, in the majority of instances in 1 Chron. i-ix, the formula "X the father of Y" denotes, not blood paternity, but the leader or founder of a particular geographical place or area. This means that hmt 'by byt rkb is more likely to denote "Hammath the founder/leader of the place Beth- Rechab" than "Hammath the ancestor of the Rechabites". Both Klein (p. 414) and Rudolph (p. 25) understand the reference in this way. (ix) byt rkb: as has just been indicated, Rudolph and Klein are probably right in seeing in "Beth-Rechab" the name of a place. As Rudolph points out (p. 25), this is certainly how the LXX of iv 12 understood byt rkb in ii 55: iv 12 LXXBL concludes "These are the men of Rechab", and probably reflects the original reading.10 9 So most commentators, although Rudolph, p. 78, who follows this view, admits that it is difficult to explain the omission on these grounds. 10 The Targum also seems to presuppose this reading in iv 12. See C.H. Knights, "The text of 1 Chronicles iv 12: a reappraisal", VT37 (1987), pp. 375-7. 16</page><page sequence="8">KENITES = RECHABITES?: 1 CHRONICLES II 55 RECONSIDERED 17 Klein suggests, with some plausibility, that Beth-Rechab is the same place as Beth-marcaboth, known from Josh. xix 5 and 1 Chron. iv 31. In both of these references, Beth-marcaboth occurs alongside Hazar-susah/susim, the locality of which is known, even if that of Beth-marcaboth is not. Hazar-susah is Khirbet Abu Suseim, a little west of Beer-sheba (Klein, p. 415). It seems reasonable to place Beth-marcaboth in the same vicinity. The names of the two places ("House of Chariots" and "Village of Horses") suggest that they may have had links with Solomon's manufacture and storage of chariots (cf. 1 Kings ix 19, x 29). This would perhaps lend support to the idea that the Kenites were metalworkers, but it does not necessarily say anything about the Rechabites. There is no need to assert that the Rechabites must have come from Beth-marcaboth/Rechab; Rechab could easily have been a personal name throughout Israel, as well as the name of a particular place: an Israelite called Rechab turns up in 2 Sam. iv, but no-one has tried to associate him with Beth- marcaboth/Rechab, so why should Jonadab ben Rechab nec- cesarily be associated with it? 1 Chron. ii 55 thus presents a picture different from that usually offered by commentators. It depicts the Kenite clans, the Tirathites, the Shimeathites and the Sucathites, as coming from the lands belonging to Hammath, chieftain of the town Beth-Rechab, in the Beer-sheba region. At some point they moved north to Kiriath-sepher, where they became linked in some way with the Calebites. At a later stage in their history they moved again, to Jabez, the location of which remains unknown. Even if this interpretation of 1 Chron. ii 55 is proved incorrect, and even it it is incorrect to follow Rudolph in repointing sprym, the fact remains that no reference to the Rechabites is to be found in the verse and, even if there was, the reference would not claim that the Rechabites were a Kenite clan. The usage of bw + mn elsewhere in Biblical Hebrew forces us to interpret the verse as referring to the geographical movement of a group of Kenites.11 Hammath's title, "father", in this context, forces us to understand Beth- I That geography can be an important function of genealogies has been shown by, for example, R.R. Wilson, Genealogy and History in the Biblical World (New Haven, Conn., 1977), p. 40.</page><page sequence="9">C. H. KNIGHTS Rechab as a place name, not as a title for the Rechabites, who are not called Beth-Rechab anywhere else, and who are not connected with Hammath anywhere else. The attestation of Rechab as a per- sonal name elsewhere in Israel in the monarchical period reveals that, simply because Jonadab ben Rechab had part of the name of a town in his name, there is no need to conclude that he was necessarily associated with that town. The supposed connection between the Kenites and the Rechabites, for which the sole evidence adduced has been 1 Chron. ii 55, needs to be rejected forthwith: the biblical Rechabites never had anything to do with the biblical Kenites, and those views which argue that they did, or which describe one of these groups by means of material proper to the other, need to be revised accordingly. To sum up, in 1 Chron. ii 55, sprym is best repointed as soperim, "scribes" and "Jabez" treated as a place name. As elsewhere in Biblical Hebrew, "who came from" must be treated as a literal geographical term. "Hammath" is a personal name, and "Beth Rechab" is a place name. This means that 1 Chron. ii 55 does not mention the Rechabites at all. It is a notice about the geographical movements of three otherwise unknown Kenite clans. 18</page></plain_text>
