<plain_text><page sequence="1">Intentional Explanation and Its Limits Robert L. Woolfolk Rutgers University In this very sweeping and provocative article, Lewis puts forth a purposive concept of human behavior. His formula- tion is very much in keeping with psychology's recent move away from mechanistic, behavioristic frameworks that view humans as passive respondents to environments that elicit and shape their behavior. Lewis's intention-based model is consistent with the "constructivist or developmental-cog- nitive theoretical paradigm" that has achieved ascendancy in contemporary psychology. Lewis begins his essay in promis- ing fashion, by repeating some of the arguments of action theorists from Wilhelm Dilthey to Max Weber to Charles Taylor. He also profitably introduces ideas from very recent work on the philosophy of intentionality from Dennett (1987) and Searle (1983). In addition, the report of a very clever experiment supple- ments and illustrates his position. It shows unequivocally that the law of effect, simplistically conceived, will not ac- count for behaviors of those infants studied by Lewis and his colleagues. No behaviorist can make parsimonious sense of these data. We are told that intentionality is a fundamental property of human activity, that we cannot explain human behavior without it. So far so good. Lewis has a number of things to say about intentionality. He states that to intend is "to will to act." He contrasts intentional behavior with "accidental behavior." He de- scribes intentionality as a "property of the mind" analogous to "believing, desiring, hoping, fearing" and calls it "a part of our mental states." He states that "intentions consist of actions and thoughts." He says that "all intentions have desires." Up to this point we are getting a rather standard account of the apparatus pertaining to the purposive explana- tion of human behavior. Intentions are those mental states that relate human subjectivity to those corporeal events and entities outside the mind. Purposes, aims, and plans are cog- nitive structures that direct behavior toward ends that are sought by the organism. With this mainstream portrayal of human teleology in place, Lewis begins what looks to be a promising attempt to supplement his description of intentionality with material from the psychology of emotion. He says that for all goals, intention is determined by the "affective states comprising part of the goal." He says that "emotional properties (the desire/goal feature to all representation) underlie all inten- tions." And about goals, he avers that "goals are ideas with emotion." In introducing affective dimensions of inten- tionality, Lewis connects with the tradition of the psychology of motivation. He seems to want to begin to identify inten- tions with motives and motivation. This is a potentially in- teresting move for those interested in the empirical investiga- tion of the phenomena of intentionality, because there seem</page><page sequence="2">274 COMMENTARIES to be some rather straightforward connections between the domains described by the philosophers and by those psychol- ogists who have investigated motivation. But just when it looks as though the thrust of Lewis's argument will take us deeper and more intensively into human psychology, he makes a definitional move that ulti- mately calls into question the coherence and logic of his position. In what may be the central pronouncement of the article, he states that "all goal-directed systems are inten- tional." Here he has introduced a potentially devastating level of generality into his definition of intention. The lowest levels of "adaptive intention" require none of the cognitive structures described earlier. In these instances, goals need not be mentally represented. It is sufficient for them to be necessary for survival, facilitative of a favorable pleasure- pain ratio, or reflexive. The action of the human heart qualifies based on these criteria, as do the movements of the amoeba. Lewis asks whether a leaf has "intention when it moves toward the sun" and he answers "yes." The chief problem encountered at this point is that "goal seeking" is not a thoroughly naturalized, unambiguous char- acteristic of actions. There is an interpretive, hermeneutic moment involved in determining when some set of motions in the world should be properly characterized as something seeking something else that is its goal. The fact that an ac- tivity aids survival seems neither to be necessary nor suffi- cient for its being intentional. Evolution does not create per- fectly adapted entities. The appetite that draws an animal toward foodstuffs also may bring it within range of a preda- tor. If it is acceptable for us to consider that hearts beat for the sake of maintaining life and also that one goal of growing leaves is to seek the sun, what is to prevent us from attribut- ing goals to inorganic entities? What precludes our deciding, as the ancients did, that planetary motion is intentional? After all we see a very regular process, similar to respiration in it cyclical nature, one that is certainly necessary for the survival of the planet, as the orbital balance between cen- tripetal and centrifugal forces keeps the earth and its eco- systems from either a fiery or an icy grave. One important reason, according to Lewis, for ascribing intentionality to phenomena habitually thought to be invol- untary is to avoid a "mixed model" in which intentional and mechanistic explanations would compete with to explain the same phenomenon or the various actions of the same entity. But this is the whole point of teleological explanation accord- ing to many of its proponents, to partition the human realm and that of the organic and infrahuman! Many thinkers (e.g ., Taylor, 1964) who have advocated teleology have had the common intellectual agenda of showing that human action is qualitatively different from the behavior of the lower animals and from the motions and activities of physical substances studied by the natural sciences. According to these thinkers the mechanistic automaticity that obtains in the physical world is not to be found in the practices of human beings. Within these formulations the intentional capacities of hu- mans become one aspect of what separates human life from the rest of the world. The tradition of the Geistes- wissenschaften and its attempt to legitimize human subjec- tivity, in some important way, is predicated on the existence of legitimate mechanistic explanations that are different in kind from those required by the "higher" human activities. In the place of the mind-body and mechanism-vitalism dualisms, Lewis has given us intentional monism. We no longer have to struggle to concern ourselves with what is intentional. Everything is. But the concept loses its explana- tory power if the motions of stars and single cells are of a piece with the pursuits of pilgrims, artists, and scientists. Unfortunately, the corpus of what Lewis has to say about intention lacks consistency. If intentions are emotional, what are amoebas doing with them? It is one thing to assume a diffuse, undifferentiated affective tone, ranging from positive to negative, in dogs or human infants, but to at- tribute emotions to cells or to involuntary muscles smacks of a rather incredible anthropomorphism. Lewis's hierarchy of levels of intention makes a more valuable contribution in his characterization of those inten- tional phenomena that involve human self-reflective capaci- ties. He draws on Duval and Wicklund's (1972) notions of objective and subjective self-awareness, but he is very much in the tradition of Kierkegaard and the concept of the self as a relation and Sartrean being-for-itself. The philosopher Harry Frankfurt (1971) made a distinction, similar to Lewis's, be- tween first-order and second-order desires. First-order desires are preferences, such as my desire to see this or that film or to have a certain kind of bread with my pastrami. Second-order desires, on the other hand, stand in superordi- nate relation to first-order desires. They are my desires about my desires. Thus as a self, not only can I reflect on my activities and proclivities, I can have preferences among my preferences, I can evaluate my values. I can, in addition to wanting hair implants, also decide how worthy or base it is to desire such things. I can wish that I did not desire some of what I do desire and wish that I were more motivated to do that which does not interest me. Charles Taylor (1985) re- ferred to this self-reflective appraisal process as "strong evaluation." Both he and Frankfurt assumed that this is a capacity unique to human beings. In this they are consistent with Sartre. Lewis does a service in bringing into the realm of intentional analysis, and apparently into the empirical arena as well, this dimension of human existence that has received little attention within mainstream behavioral science.
