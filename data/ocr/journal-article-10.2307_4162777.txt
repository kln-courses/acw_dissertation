<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE BIRD BIOGRAPHIES OF W. H. HUDSON. By William H. Hudson, with a foreword by Jonathan Maslow. Capra Press, Santa Barbara, California. 1988:208 pp., with illustrations. Paper $9.95.-W. H. Hudson lived on the pampas of Argentina during the last half of the 19th century, when a sea of tall grasses extended for hundreds of miles and when the Rio Plata had many lagoons and marshes. Hudson lived intimately with the natural world and was an ardent field ornithologist. His major written contribution was "Birds of La Plata" (2 vols., 1920), and it is selections from this work that form the current small edition. The book includes 49 "bird biographies." As an enthusiastic naturalist, Hudson describes the most interesting behaviors of each of the 49 bird species. He lived many years in the Argentine countryside, and he was one of the first to observe closely and write about these birds. True, the accounts are sometimes anecdotal and anthropomorphic, but remember that his field notes were written before 1875. Keen ornithological skills were reflected in his many interesting discoveries; here I'll briefly mention a few from the text. He found, for example, that the migrant White-banded Mockingbird (Mimus triurus) returns with songs</page><page sequence="2">ORNITHOLOGICAL LITERATURE 519 learned a thousand miles away, that various species compete with Ovenbirds (Furnarius rufus) for use of their earthen nests, and that Bay-winged Cowbirds (Molothrus badius) raise their own young. Frequently the interactions of the pampas gauchos and the birds are described (e.g., how hunting gauchos fed Carancho Hawks [Polyborus plancus] that then flushed quail), and for a variety of birds he describes their behavior in captivity. Sadly, even in his time, a host of pampas species were already declining; the Common Rhea (Rhea americana) ". . . is now becoming rare, and those who wish to have a hand in its exter- mination must go to a distance of three or four hundred miles from the Argentine capital before they can get a sight of it." Hudson was a conservationist who believed we should set our goals toward a return to more natural conditions. The scientific merit of his writings are shown by his corrections of earlier authors, by many discoveries, and by some predictions that have been verified recently. Throughout the accounts it is evident that Hudson had literary skills (he also wrote the popular book, "Green Mansions"). In addition to the text are a foreword that succinctly reviews the naturalist's life and an afterword that "revises" the 1920 species nomenclature of the book. Alas, some errors of revision are evident (e.g., Bolborhynchus monachus of Hudson is clearly Myiopsitta mon- achus today, but the afterword lists it as B. aymara). The book will be appreciated by a variety of bird students, particularly those interested in Argentine birds and behavior. (Hudson does include field experiences from elsewhere in South America.) Overall, it is an inexpensive and enjoyable introduction to the birds of the pampas from an era gone by.-CHARLES F. LECK.</page></plain_text>
