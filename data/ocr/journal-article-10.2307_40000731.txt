<plain_text><page sequence="1">II. Inscriptions from Tell el Rubca Christine L. Soghor A. The largest assemblage of inscriptional ma- terial uncovered by the Mendes Expedition during the 1965-1966 seasons is the group of fragments from the fallen naoi which once stood in the sanctuary of Amasis. Twenty inscribed granite fragments were found on the edge of the depression surrounding the naos and down in the depression itself during the 1966 season. In addition to these blocks, eleven pieces of un- inscribed stone were found, coming from the base, roof, and sides of the broken naoi. All of these fragments corresponded in material and scale to the standing naos. The reconstruction of the naoi from these blocks has been based on various factors. Three upper left fragments inscribed with a srh were found, one from each fallen naos. These blocks, along with two upper left corner fragments, revealed specific characteristics for each shrine : width of bands on the front surface, style of carving of the hieroglyphs, and shape of the roof. The assignment of blocks to the sides of the naoi was facilitated by the direction of the signs and the position of the lugs in relation to the inscribed surface. The breaks on the stones, the place each was found, and differences in the writing of specific words gave additional support to the assignment of fragments to particular naoi. Before discussing the fragments that were uncovered, it will be useful to discuss the standing naos and to present a copy of its in-</page><page sequence="2">II.

The front surface is divided into three bands, the central band with the signs being recessed from the outer bands. The following drawing indicates that certain hieroglyphs within the recessed band are executed in raised relief and in fact are on the same plane as the outer bands; these sur- faces are indicated in the drawing with stippling. Fig. 3. Diagram showing planes of front surface on naos of Shu. The copy of the inscription in Fig. 2 presents only the signs which are visible, and the dra- wing indicates that portion of the front surface which has been preserved. The text on the lintel is virtually complete. The inscriptions on the sides, however, have lacunae, and the signs that are carved on one side do not necessarily appear on the other. Furthermore, while the majority of the hiero- glyphs are executed in sunk relief, some stand in raised relief, either cut free or surrounded by a bit of stone (PL XVI fig. 27). These irregu- larities of carving appear on fragments from the naoi of Geb and Ra (PI. XVI fig. 29) ; however neither the lacunae nor the irregularities of carving occur on the fragments and restoration of the naos of Osiris (Pis. VIII figs. 5, 6 and XVI fig. 28 ; Fig. 4) ; the Osiris shrine in fact presents the finished form of the inscription and carving. In reconstructing the naos of Osiris, certain given factors were established by several blocks inscribed with his name: first of all, the roof was flat, and secondly the front surface was divided into two rather than three bands. The style of carving and the location of the block initially helped to assign additional blocks to this naos, while the usual disposition of names in the royal titulary provided a framework for the reconstruction. After establishing a se- quence of the blocks according to the inscription and the breaks between the fragments, measure- ments were taken and the total height related to the height of the standing naos. All evidence gave support to the reconstruction as drawn: a complete inscription on the left side from roof to base in seven fragments.2 Two fragments of the lintel indicate that the naos had a winged disc in the center (PL XVI fig. 28). 1 The inscription was partially published by James Burton in Excerpta hieroglyphica (1825-1829) pl. XLI left. The inscription published here was made from photographs taken with a telephoto lens and from personal observation with the aid of binoculars; both systems of recording were undertaken in the morning hours throughout the summer. The drawing itself was made from the photographs while the reconstruction drawings were made from photographs and scale drawings, 2 The total height of the standing naos is 7.856 m.; the height of the naos measured from the base of the pyramidal roof down through the foot of the monolith is 7.174 m. The height of the Osiris naos can be estimated by totaling measurements taken along the line which separates the two bands on the front sur- face. Although not indicated on the drawing (Fig. 4), the fragment with the srh has a preserved portion of the roof, and the measurement from the top of the roof to the bottom of the dividing line on the front surface of this block is 0.257 m- Similarly, the lowest fragment on the left side has a preserved portion of the bottom surface of the naos, and the measurement</page><page sequence="4">II. INSCRIPTIONS FROM TELL EL RUBCA 19 Fig. 4. Reconstruction of Osiris naos. 2*</page><page sequence="5">20 JARCE 6 (1967) It is unusual to find two nomens and two prenomens in one titulary. However, there are three left-side blocks with prenomens which must be assigned either to the shrine of Ra or Osiris;3 one of these naoi therefore certainly had two prenomens on the left side. Furthermore, since the height of the reconstructed Osiris naos corresponds to the height of the standing naos, and since all the signs on the reconstruction can be fit into the lacunae of the standing naos, there is apparently no obstacle to the accep- tance of this inscription as the complete and ideal form for the other naoi. In retrospect it could be said that Shu's inscription, with a prenomen near the top on the left side and near the middle on the right side was intended to have a pre- nomen at the top and middle of both sides. Fragments from the naoi of Geb and Ra fit into the pattern established by the Osiris inscrip- tion, and the reconstructions of these naoi have been made accordingly (Figs. 5 and 6).4 Not only was the text of the Osiris naos complete, the hieroglyphs both in sunk relief and raised relief had been carefully completed. A detail of an unfinished section on the upper left corner of the Shu naos indicates how the two types of hieroglyphs were formed (PL XVI fig. 27). The signs which now appear in raised relief on the Osiris naos were originally carved in sunk relief within the area demarked by two parallel lines on the lintel and sides of the shrine's front surface. The area between the lines and around these hieroglyphs was pared down, and the remainder of the hieroglyphs now visible were carved into the recessed surface. The earlier group of hieroglyphs was completed by removing the borders of stone surrounding each sign. Despite the fact that the Osiris naos gives a complete text and shows finished hieroglyphs, the text and carving have certain peculiarities. An unusual order of the royal names is notice- able in other inscriptions of Amasis (see below), but the repetition of the nomen and prenomen is unknown, as is the use of all five royal names on a naos; Roeder's publication of naoi in the Cairo Museum indicates that three names are common in similar inscriptions. The carving of hieroglyphs in raised relief is uneven. In one instance, two of the three signs in the name of Osiris were carved as raised hieroglyphs while in another instance all the signs were carved this way. The raised hiero- glyphs on the naos of Shu were in two stages of completion: signs which were apparently to be executed in sunk relief were never carved; although some raised hieroglyphs were finished in their final form, others were still surrounded by a border of stone. A comparison of the texts on all the naoi reveals that identical signs were not uniformly treated: a raised hieroglyph on one shrine might appear in sunk relief on an- other shrine. The explanations for the peculiarities of text and carving described above are both numerous and complex; primarily they support one of three contentions: that Amasis usurped the naoi from a predecessor; that he carved the inscriptions entirely himself; and that the successors of Amasis first erased and then restored his inscriptions. Support for the first occurrence lies in the facts that none of the royal names are carved in raised relief;5 that inner detail of raised relief in Egyptian art is usually not carved from the bottom surface to the top of the dividing line on this fragment is 0.252 m. Measurements taken along the center lines of the intervening blocks and added to these two measurements give a total of 6.775 m. Presumably the gaps between the intervening blocks would bring the total height of the Osiris naos close to that of the front surface of the Shu naos. 8 In two instances the front surface is divided into two rather than three bands, and in the third instance the prenomen appears on a block with a srh which duplicates and cannot join the srh of the Geb shrine. 4 There is no evidence of whether the naos of Ra had a flat or a pyramidal roof. The reconstruction of this shrine has been drawn with a flat roof only because it has two bands on the front surface rather than three as on the Shu and Geb shrines; these two monuments have pyramidal roofs, while the naos of Osiris with only two bands on the front surface has a flat roof. 5 The divine names were presumably left in their original form because it was neither necessary nor desirable to remove them.</page><page sequence="6">II.

INSCRIPTIONS FROM TELL EL RUBCA 23 until the surface surrounding a figure has been completely removed ; and that the use of raised and sunk hieroglyphs within the same inscrip- tion is extremely rare if not unknown. If Amasis did usurp the shrines inscribed for someone else, it could be suggested that his nomen and pre- nomen were repeated in the inscription either because his names were not as lengthy as those of his predecessor or because his inscription did not follow exactly the form of the original in- scription. The naos of Shu shows that the fal- cons which introduce the Horus and Horus of Gold names were carved in raised relief and were therefore part of the first stage of carving. In the ideal form of the text, as preserved in the naos of Osiris, two prenomens and one nomen were carved between these falcons ; despite the fact that there are irregularities in other in- scriptions of Amasis, this peculiarity is un- known, and it is difficult to imagine that it would have been intentionally planned in any inscription. Support for the idea that Amasis alone carved the inscriptions comes from the fact that an unusual order of royal names is known from other inscriptions of Amasis, as mentioned above; in two cases n-sw-bit is separated from the prenomen and appears directly after the Horus name,6 and in another instance n-sw-bit is directly followed by the nomen.7 Additional support for original inscription by Amasis is suggested by a detail which does not seem consistent with the idea of usurpation: that in addition to royal names, some divine names and symbols were executed in sunk relief. The suggestion that the inscriptions were originally executed by Amasis, erased by a successor, and redone by another is supported by several of the facts already mentioned in the arguments for usurpation by Amasis him- self. One fact which especially supports the idea of later erasure is that obliteration is known on other inscriptions of Amasis; both Petrie and Griffith observed this occurrence, although no instance of restoration was reported.8 If the names of Amasis had been erased the lack of uniformity in the hieroglyphs visible today might be better explained; the multiplicity of names might be understood as the result of ignorance concerning additional epithets which Amasis may have originally used. The evidence presently available indicates that the peculiarities of carving and text dis- cussed above are best explained by the idea that Amasis recarved the inscriptions. The repe- tition of the nomen and prenomen in the text is the strongest point against the idea that the inscriptions are original. Details which initially seemed to suggest originality could be used to support usurpation: the unfinished hieroglyphs and the lacunae in the texts could be the result of disinterest once the original names were re- moved and the names of Amasis added; the illogical repetition of names might have occurred from the desire to completely fill the spaces vacated by erasure. The conclusion from the inscriptional ma- terial, however, apparently conflicts with the architectural evidence, which is that Amasis unquestionably built the sanctuary in which the naoi stood. Two explanations could be imagined for this apparent discrepancy: that his predecessor had not constructed a sanctuary, or that his sanctuary was in such a condition that it was necessary for Amasis to build a new one.9 At the present time however, there is no evidence to prove either of these constructs, one of which would have to be adopted in order to accept the theory of usurpation.

While the inscribed fragments from the fallen naoi of Amasis are an impressive addition to the inscriptional material of the Late Period from Mendes, perhaps the most interesting group of 6 Gauthier, Livre des rois IV 114 no.

During the excavation season of 1964, the burial chamber of the priestess of Hathor, sole royal ornament Si-n.t-Ppy was uncovered in the necropolis area (PL XIV fig. 23) . The lime- stone chamber had a carved band of inscription Fig. 7. Inscription on facade of S-t-n-t-Ppy burial chamber. filled with blue paint around the opening in the facade (Fig. 7), and another along the top of three of the interior walls (Fig. 8) ; the same three interior walls were painted with an offer- ing list on the east, granaries on the south, and funerary equipment on the west (PL XVII fig. 30). In structure and decoration this cham- ber very much resembled those found by Je- quier around the Pyramid of Pepy II at Saq- qara.12 In the excavations of 1964 and 1965, a number of carved limestone fragments were found near S.t-n.t-Pfty's burial chamber; several of these were inscribed with her name or titles and, because the inscriptions in her chamber were practically complete, were recognized as elements from some other part of her funerary monument. Most of these fragments have now been assigned to an offering niche between one and a half and two meters high which was probably built in the east face of her mastaba superstructure; they formed part of a false door with cavetto cornice, and two side panels which were set perpendicular to the door on either side of it (Fig. 9).13 Fragments from the central panel of the false door show that S.t-n.t-Ppy, her name, and the offerings piled before her were all executed in raised relief. The inscriptions on the lintel and jambs of the door however were carved in sunk relief; several of the hieroglyphs were incised with inner detail. In addition, there was a colored geometric band on the stela, although 12 For example the chamber of '"^qfl in M.

INSCRIPTIONS FROM TELL EL RUBCA 2J Fig. 8. Inscription on inside of burial chamber. it does not appear in the reconstruction ; it was both carved and painted and was bordered by an incised line filled with yellow paint. The leaves of the cavetto cornice were painted alternately red, blue, yellow and white; the carving here was less careful than on the stela itself. The side pieces of the niche were carved in sunk relief on the front or outside edge, with a column of hieroglyphs above a figure of S.t- n.t-Ppy holding a lotiform staff before her. These columns were bordered on each side first with an incised line filled with blue paint, and a geometric band further to each side; the latter consisted of black-bordered rectangles filled with red, blue, yellow and perhaps white paint ; this band was not carved. The inside surface of these side panels had several figures carved in raised relief near the bottom of the stone; an offering bearer carrying a duck is preserved from the left hand piece, and a smaller scale butcher with an ox from the right hand piece.14 Above these figures was a column of inscription in sunk relief which paralleled at least in part the inscription on the front edge of these stones. No color has been preserved on the interior columns, but the offering bearer has traces of red paint. Comparative material suggests that S.t-n.t- Pfty's inscriptions date late in the Sixth Dynasty or in the First Intermediate Period; and al- though the date cannot be established more precisely at the present time, it may be useful to relate her inscriptions to monuments known from this general period. The inscriptions from her burial chamber and her false door niche are not uniform stylistically 14 Detailed photographs of the bearer and the in- scription on the facade of S-t-n-t-Ppy's burial chamber were published in JARCE 4 (1965) pls. XXI and XX.</page><page sequence="13">28 JARCE 6 (1967) and it is possible to discuss these monuments separately. As stated earlier, the signs inscribed in the chamber had no interior detail and were filled with blue paint ; those inside the chamber were carved with clean, sure strokes, while those on the outside were more simply incised. The style of carving on the facade resembles that on a stela from Saqqara dated to the Heracleopolitan Period,15 and in fact the in- scriptions from S.t-n.t-Pfiy's burial chamber share several features with the Saqqara stela: the feather on the hr(t)-ntr sign reduced to a short stroke, and the determinative for imy wt being ® rather than o.16 Another feature which relates more to First Intermediate Period rather than Old Kingdom inscriptions is the mutilation and suppression of signs which were believed to threaten the de- ceased if written in their complete form.17 On the facade of the burial chamber the head of the viper is separated from the body, while in- side the chamber, in the offering list, the head is missing altogether. While the mutilation of particular signs is observed in First Inter- mediate Period and Middle Kingdom texts, it is difficult to find it on monuments securely dated to the Sixth Dynasty. Lacau found that the snake was not mutilated in any of the Pyramid Texts and at the same time noted that mutilation was generally practiced in the Pyramid Texts of Pepy II ;18 in other words, the snake was not among the signs that were modi- fied in his funerary monument. Private monu- ments in which this feature is observed and which are sometimes dated to the Sixth Dyn- asty are usually no more securely dated than S.t-n.t-Ppy's.19 Like the viper, the falcon was neither muti- lated nor suppressed in the Pyramid Texts,20 but in the burial chamber of S.t-n.t-Ppy it was re- placed by its phonetic complement; both the falcon and intact viper were used in her false door niche, which was apparently far enough away from her body for the signs to be harmless to the deceased. Several of the signs in the burial chamber are reversed, but it is difficult to use this feature as an absolute criterion for da- ting monuments to the First Intermediate Period. The false door niche provides further con- nections with monuments which follow the end of the Old Kingdom. First of all, the style of relief is quite crude, as observed in the figure of the butcher carrying a joint of beef and the owner (PI. XVII figs. 31 and 32). 21 Secondly, although the spear-like staff which S.t-n.t-Ppy holds probably appears by the late Sixth Dynasty, the noted occurrences of it have been dated to the First Intermediate Period or Middle Kingdom.22 15 The stela of St.t-'Iy-tnw published by Fischer in AZ go (1963) 35ff.pl. VI. 16 Schenkel states that the latter sign was introduced during the reign of Pepy II (Friihmitteldgyptische Studien 40). The tendency to maintain Old Kingdom traditions at Saqqara during the First Intermediate Period is expected, but nevertheless the Saqqara inscription suggests that such a feature cannot be used for absolute dating. 17 Examples have been collected by Lacau in AZ 51 (1914) iff. and Fischer in JAOS 76 (1956) 102. 18 Op. cit. 49 and 38. 19 For the uncertainty of the date of the occurrence at Giza see Junker in Giza VIII. 4. At Saqqara the date of the cemetery around the Pyramid of Pepy II was based on the fact that names and titles found on monuments there were found among the officials listed in the antechamber of the pyramid temple (Jequier, Tombeaux 1). The number of parallels be- tween those represented in the temple and attested in the cemetery are few, and the correspondence between titles is not complete; cf. Mon. fun., Temple 38 and 47 with Tombeaux 12-21, 54, and 112. The Mn.i in- scriptions at Denderah have now been dated definitely to the First Intermediate Period; see Fischer in Den- dera in the Third Millennium B. C. 85-91 (in press). 20 Lacau states that all birds are intact in the Pyramid Texts with one possible exception, op. cit. 41 ; he does not discuss the replacement of the falcon until he discusses post-Dyn. VI inscriptions ibid. 58. 21 Compare the offerings with those on a Saqqara stela published by Gunn in Teti Pyramid Cemeteries pl.

INSCRIPTIONS FROM TELL EL RUBCA 29 The hieroglyphs on the niche were carved with rather careful detail but several of them perhaps have more detail than one would expect in Old Kingdom examples.23 The niche itself,24 as well as the apparent use of a decorative band on the false door25 are more easily related to First Intermediate Period and Middle Kingdom monuments. There is evidence however that S.t-n.t-Ppy might have lived during the Sixth Dynasty rather than the First Intermediate Period. Several of the palaeographic details in the burial chamber inscriptions26 as well as her name27 and titles28 appear at Meir and Deir el Gabrawi in the late Sixth Dynasty. The recesses on either side of the tablet on her false door were apparently regularly formed,29 and there seems to be in- dependent evidence at Mendes that the small false door niche did occur in the Sixth Dynasty there.30 Finally, her offering formula invokes Anubis and Osiris but not Osiris Khentiamentiu. Given the possibility that the niche was carved later than the burial chamber, one still might suggest that the total group of inscrip- tions fell within the period of the Sixth Dynasty. For in comparison with provincial inscriptions of the Sixth Dynasty and First Intermediate Period in Upper Egypt the inscriptions of S.t-n.t-Ppy have not departed as much from the hiero- glyphic writing of the Old Kingdom. The fact that certain features are comparable with those on Heracleopolitan Period stelae from Saqqara need not imply that the Mendes inscription is of the same date, since the Saqqara inscriptions maintained more closely the Old Kingdom hieroglyphic traditions.31 In fact one would ex- pect First Intermediate Period inscriptions at Mendes to resemble those from provincial sites of that period. One hopes that more inscriptions from the Old Kingdom through the Middle Kingdom will be discovered at Mendes so that a more precise chronology can be established for this material and more information gained about the people of the Delta during this period. D. The final text chosen for consideration in this preliminary report on the inscriptional material from the Mendes excavations was found near the burial chamber of S.t-n.t-Ppy in 1965. The object belonged to the steward of divine offer- ings Snb.f, and probably dates to the Twelfth 28 The signs § &lt;3^j* **h appear on three fragments from the false door which have not yet been pla- ced in the reconstruction; one fragment is shown in PL XVIII fig. 33. These fragments bear the name and titles of S.t-n.t-Ppy, and the colored geometric band mentioned above ; two of the fragments preserve the upper corners of the recess to either side of the central panel. 24 Firth, Gunn and Quibell dated the false door niches at Saqqara from the end of the Sixth Dynasty into the Tenth Dynasty; see Teti Pyramid Cemeteries 38, 179-181, 203 ff. and pls.

A passage was made from the de- pression to the outside of the object, running under- neath the top band of inscription. 37 The base lacks a spout; this characteristic is also noted on no. 23074.</page><page sequence="18">II. INSCRIPTIONS FROM TELL EL RUBCA 31 Because the table lacks such a channel, and because there are traces of mortar, one might assume that another object had originally been placed in the depression. This object must not have stood much higher than the upper surface of the base since it would have obscured the beginning of the inscription ; a statue or a shrine therefore would seem to be an unlikely pos- sibility.38 Perhaps the most likely object to have stood in the center was a flat stone on which loaves, pots, and a mat were carved in raised relief; a similar composite offering table is in the Louvre and dates from the Middle Kingdom.39 A translation of the inscription follows, marked to indicate passages which will be discussed below. An offering which the king gives to the Ram lord of Ddt* Osiris,b and the Ennead which is in Ddt,c that they may give linen and alabaster, incense and oil to the spirit of the steward of divine offerings of Sobek - ,a Snb.f, possessor of rever- ence, true of voice. An offering which the king gives to Anubis, he who is on his mountain, who is in the place of embalming, the lord of the necropolis, that he may give provisions to the spirit of the steward Snb.f, true of voice. 0 you who are living, who are on earth, every wcb- priest, every lector priest, every scribe, every soul priest who shall, in going downstream and up- stream, pass by this offering table,e as truly as your king lives for you and your city gods and nome gods praise you, your contract shall endure in the temple of the Ram lord of Ddt,1 as you say while you w'b, an offering which the king gives to the Ennead and the gods which are in Ddt that they may give invocation offerings con- sisting of bread and beer, oxen and fowl and - to the spirit of the steward of divine offerings of Sobek - , Snb.f , true of voice, born of the mistress of the house yImn.i. a. Like other Middle Kingdom offering formu- lae, this inscription invokes a group of gods which here includes the local god Bi nb Ddt and the Ennead of Ddt. The ram is depicted zoo- morphically, as he is on all but one of our in- scriptions from the Old Kingdom through Middle Kingdom.40 This contrasts with the anthropomorphic form given him on the Sixth Dynasty alabaster vase found by Mariette at Abydos,41 and a second alabaster vase from Aby- dos perhaps dating to the Thirteenth Dynasty;42 the statue of Amenemhat I found near Khatacna, on the other hand, shows a zoomorphic form in the inscription.43 At Mendes there is no evidence yet of the anthropomorphic form until after the New Kingdom. In our Old Kingdom inscriptions, the god is named Bs nb Ddt with Ddt being written fl^. 44 This writing is apparently maintained in all periods, while other writings appear inter- mittently; ^J® appears on this object and on another Middle Kingdom offering table ex- cavated at Mendes. While there is considerable proof that the northern tell of Mendes is Ddt, no reference to cnpt has yet been uncovered in the excavations. The title that Nfr-m^.t, Hm.iwn and Sst.t-htfi 38 There are several cases where a statue was set into a base which was carved with an offering table on the upper surface (Brooklyn 57.140 and MM A 22.1.107A and B); however, the inscription in these examples and in other monuments with a composite form does not run behind the inset piece; see two statues in the Louvre (E. 12629 an(i 11196), and a shrine with stela in Leiden (Boeser, Beschreibung der aegyptischen Sammlung II pl. VIII no. 9). 89 E. 1 1573; see Mon. Plot 25 (1921-1922) 44. 40 One object mentions the "temple of the Ram" with "Ram" expressed by the divine determinative with ram's head (Gardiner's Sign List C4). 41 Catalogue gdndral des monuments d' Abydos 573 no. 1464. 42 Seen in New York during the fall of 1966, in the care of a dealer.

Jaquet- Gordon, Les noms des domaines funeraires 424 no. 25) but not with the spelling in Pyr. 288b ( JT| fj ^) ; the name of a second funerary domain may not be restored correctly (Jaquet- Gordon, 182 no. 131).</page><page sequence="19">32 JARCE 6 (1967) owned, f^f^, indicates that cnpt existed in the Old Kingdom ;45 perhaps it is to be identified with the southern tell at Mendes, as Daressy suggested; an early foundation date for this mound has not yet been established however. b. The sign preceding Psdt seems to be a vertical sign, perhaps the standing figure of Osiris. c. Gardiner has already suggested that the Pr Psdt of L. E. XVI which is known in Late texts might be an alternative name for the town of Ddt or might be a part of the town it- self.46 This inscription does not prove which of his ideas is correct but certainly indicates that the answer lies in his suggestions rather than in Gauthier's identification of Pr Psdt as the Serapeum of Mendes. d. It would appear that ^ and g| in the bottom line should be read with the title rather than the name since Snb.f appears alone in the left column. The title imy-r pr n Sbk £ rsy is known on a stela from Abydos,47 as is the title imy-r n htp-ntr n Ibdwf* however I know of no 'overseer of divine offerings of [a local god]' nor have I been able to identify ^ as a place name. e. The word is clearly htp ^ . An address to the Living is not commonly found on offering tables; furthermore I know of no parallels for the reference to an offering table in this type of inscription : both mchc.t and i c are known on Middle Kingdom stelae.49 One wonders if this object might have been placed in the temple of Bi nb Ddt, especially since there is a reference to the temple in the text ; however I know of no instances where an offering table without stela, statue, or shrine was placed in a temple. f .
