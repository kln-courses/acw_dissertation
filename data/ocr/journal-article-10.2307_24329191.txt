IN THE FIR ST THREE DECADES OF THE TWEN TIETH CENTURY, ADVERTISEMENTS FOR ELECTRICAL POWER USED THE IMAGE OF THE ELECTRICAL FAIRY AND HER MATERIAL EFFECTS TO SITUATE THE NEW ELECTRI CAL TECHNOLOGY IN RELATIONSHIP TO ARCHITECTURE AND THE CITY. THIS REPRE SENTATION OF ELECTRICITY CREATES THREE KINDS OF MAGIC AS IT CONSTRUCTS IDEAS (OR FORMS OF ENCHANTMENT) ABOUT NATURE, ELECTRICAL TECHNOLOGY, AND MATERIALITY THAT ARE BOTH DISPELLED AND PERPETUATED IN THE CONTEM PORARY DIGITAL CULTURE OF PRODUCTION. THE MODERN APPARITION OF THE ELECTRICAL FAIRY IS ITSELF AN INVOCATION OF A VICTORIAN AESTHETIC SENSIBILITY TOWARDS NATURE. THE FAIRY REPRESENTED ELECTRICITY IN POPULAR CULTURE AS A NEW KIND OF NATURE-A SUPERNATURAL POWER. IT IS AN IMAGINATIVE CONSTRUCT, THE FIRST SPATIAL REPRESENTATION OF AN ELECTRICAL NETWORK.

THE INVISIBILITY AND IMMATERIALITY ACCORDED TO ELEC TRICITY, AND ITS RELATIONSHIP OUTSIDE OF NATURE, CREATED THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH ELECTRICAL TECHNOLOGY COULD BE UNDERSTOOD AS A MAGICAL FORCE OF EMANCIPATION. THE CONSUMPTION OF ELECTRICITY AND ITS PRODUCTS COULD EXIST WITHOUT CONSEQUENCES, WHILE THE POWERS OF TECHNICAL EFFICIENCY ACCORDED TO ELECTRICITY COULD BE EXTENDED AND JOINED WITH SOCIAL AND CLASS ASPIRATIONS. ELECTRICAL PRODUCTION APPEARS AS A MATERIAL ATTRIBUTE OF THE FAIRY, A "MAGICAL ENGENDERING" FROM WITHIN THE FAIRY'S OWN BODY. TO REINFORCE THIS APPEARANCE, THE FAIRY IS OFTEN CLAD WITH THE NEW COMMERCIAL PROD UCTS OF ELECTRICITY-AN ILLUMINATED AND TRANSPARENT GOWN, A SARONG, OR A BRASSIERE OF LIGHT BULBS. AS THESE ARTIFACTS OF ELECTRICAL TECHNOLOGY ARE DOUBLED AND SOMETIMES FUSED WITH MATERIAL FEATURES OF THE FAIRY'S BODY, ELECTRICITY IS INSCRIBED WITH BODILY ATTRIBUTES OF GENDER AND SEXU ALITY. ELECTRICITY GLAMORIZED AND EMBELLISHED HER BODY WHILE ALSO CONCEALING IT; THE FAIRY OFFERED A SCALABLE SPECTACLE.
