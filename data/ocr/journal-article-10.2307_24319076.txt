Octavio Paz The small handcrafted toys that we looked at nostalgically in our previous installment of Artes de México told us that one issue of the magazine on this subject is simply not enough. We know we can do more. We believe that it is not unreasonable to pursue the idea of drafting a cultural history of traditional toys in our country, though the task may seem daunting. It's a simply question of getting started. These two issues on tra ditional Mexican toys aspire to be a kind of trigger in order to help achieve that goal. The topics covered in our previous installment were play as a source of joy and freedom and toys as traditional objects that should be examined in terms of both their uses and their forms. We also saw how materials speak of the environment where toys were created, what customs define them, how myths and rituals arise from them, their syncretic origins and the aesthetics they reflect. We would now like to point to other aspects that we think may incite readers to decipher what lies behind traditional toys. We know there are many things yet to be explored: toys' use as tools for memory, observation and imitation. But this is only one step. We might begin by exploring the idea of childhood held by different cultures in this country; this could give us clues that will allow us to understand the use and form of certain toys, and perhaps to glean their specific meaning related to their place within each community. This is a task that many anthropologists have already set themselves, but it has not been discussed much outside of specialized journals. In our previous issue, in response to our questions about Raramuri games and toys, Isabel Martinez and Alejandro Fujigaki analyzed the values they instill in children of that culture and their particular way of playing and even making their own toys. This is the kind of study we would like to see accomplished in other parts of the country. Alberto Manguel states that toys can tell us who we are, and what types of power games we are involved in, since children's play responds to behavior they observe in the adult world. This could be yet another leitmotif in the exploration of this world of small and often humorous objects, which mir ror customs and ways we have of relating to one another. Our cultural history should also include the circulation of industrial toys, from their introduction in the urban world to the impact they had upon reaching more isolated communities. Tracing out this history could open up a very revealing field of research and knowledge. We are very concerned about the disappearance or near disappearance of certain toys that are an important part of our heritage: those made of natural gum or wax, the famous tarasca, those used by children in the city in the mid-twentieth century, the clayTehuantepec horses with riders reminiscent of a Zapotee nahual, and many others. For all these reasons, we must praise the establishment of La Esquina, a museum of traditional Mexican toys in San Miguel de Allende that attempts to recover some of what has been lost and that pro vides incentives to artisans. We are certain that this will open up new and promising possibilities. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the museum for its participation in this issue, and in particular its creator, Angélica Tijerina. A separate section of our magazine pertains to dolls, which for centuries have enjoyed a special relationship with children all over the world. Dolls have played a significant role in many places around Mexico, and Ruth D. Lechuga explores how they did. She collected them and never ceased to be surprised by the creativity of the many artisans who used very simple materials to make them. The appearance of Mazahua dolls on Mexico City streets in the 1970s is a story that merits a separate narration, and this is what Laura Durango does, including in her article an interview with Guadalupe Rivera Marin. It is clear that poetry has been a great confrere in the resistance that these toys have shown when faced with the onslaughts of time, modernity and globalization. Therefore, paraphrasing Pablo Neruda, we at Artes de México also suggest that people who have lost the joy of play rediscover their inner child by contemplating the magical objects presented on these pages. • Translated by Clara Marin. Among Toys I Alberto Mancuel | We come into a place too large for us, too complicated for our intelligence. We cannot hold the world because we are too much in it: that which we see excludes us. We are born into a kaleidoscope of shapes and a cacophony of sounds too overwhelming to disentangle, in which borders are blurred and contours are vague. Psychologists tell us that we are born with a primordial self-awareness, knowing that our bodies are ours from the start. We learn who we already know we are by learning what we experience—this finger that touches, this foot that I grasp, this mouth with which I suck—and from that place we call "I" we begin to separate the strands of the world. Like Adam in the Garden, we are given the task of naming what we see and, in order to bring the world into our reach, we are given transitional models of the world that we can hold and keep: a doll, a bear, a rabbit, a castle. What fits in our grasp is the measure of our understand ing. For a child, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. We reduce the world to the space in which we play, and here we build a pygmy realm that we decree is a mirror of the one around us. What takes place on the floor of our playroom, we say, takes place in the world. What we invent, we believe in; the walls of our space are the limits of our universe. King, queen, magician, sorceress, overlord, the child constructs the history and geography of the land of toys and imagines that this is how and where things truly happen. His hand moves the soldiers over the mountainous carpet, hides the animals in the crevices and wrinkles of a sheet, places the dolls in their house and their hospital and their school; in a secret way (which he cannot articulate) he knows that these actions govern the ebb and flow of real wars and migrations and societies. The game the child plays mirrors the world, but is also mirrored in the world. 66 I Margarita de Oreilana Clara Marín.

In the evening, one of the kings is placed in checkmate and, furious, overturns the chess board. At this point, a messenger announces: 'Tour army is in flight, you have lost your kingdom." The universe reduced to an enclosure, the child organizes its geography. Within his given space, the world is recreated —hills, cities, roads, jungles—through which he will explore what lies beyond. The children of the nomad people of the Gobi desert play the same world-building games as their fellows in city high-rises. Every child plays with real horses and soldiers within the walls of a real city. Robert Louis Stevenson: Let the sofa be mountains, the carpet be sea, There I'll establish a city for me: A kirk and a mill and a palace beside, And a harbor as well where my vessels may ride. Not only the carpet. A child, lying on his back among his toys, looking up at the blank ceiling, imagines what it would be like to inhabit that white and empty space in the center of which rises the single tree of a lamp, to create, on the untouched surface, hills and valleys, towns and forests, to people it with his own creatures. Possess the space but seek new ones as well. Invert it, draw the landscape, bring the universe to life once again. The time of play is its own time. It is neither the time of the clock nor that of the story, nor is it fixed by the conventions of commercially-ruled television slots. It is determined by the plot of the game, by the quality of the weather, by the bursts of energy of the player, by the nature of the toy itself. Unmeasured time dictates the setting-up of a stage for miniature animals; centuries parade by as one toy army attacks the fortress of another; a long hour is given over to the dolls' tea; seconds tick along the train tracks; a quasi-eternity is occupied by the progression of a video game. Every playtime is unique. Attempts to continue an in terrupted game result merely in patchwork. Everything that happens happens in a given frame of time. Then it ends. Then it begins again. The history of the world unfolds during the afternoon of play. Everything that can happen happens now. The child begins the game at a certain age and ends it at another. Some thing has taken place in the interval: he is no longer the same. The toys look on unchanged like statues but the player has grown, advanced in a time of his own making. He tries to recapture the moment of play, but fails, again and again. He keeps trying and will not accept Heraclitus's truth: You never go down to the same playroom twice. certain others that are as essential to our world as our name or our own features. The collection of toys tells who we are. Like the layout of our garden or the books in our library, our toys display a secret portrait that grows as we grow and changes as we change, and eventually disintegrates or is reduced to a single, time worn survivor. In the meantime, they betray us to the world. Orderly or haphazard, neat or unkempt, pristine or maimed, they proclaim our love. They are our earliest autobiography. But these passionate affections are not steadfast. One morning, the best-beloved are best-beloved no longer. "What has happened?" asks Chateaubriand in a memorable passage. "Is it a new attachment that begins or an old attachment that ends? No matter: it is love that dies before the object of love itself. We are forced to acknowledge that man's feelings are exposed to a secret labour: to the fever of time that breeds lassitude, dissipates illusion, undermines our passions and changes our hearts, as it changes our hair and our years." ["Qu'est-il survenu? Est-ce un nouvel attachement qui com mence ou un vieil attachement qui finit? N'importe: c'est l'amour qui meurt avant l'objet aimé. On est obligé de recon naître que les sentiments de l'homme sont exposés à l'effet d'un travail caché; fièvre du temps qui produit la lassitude, dissipe l'illusion, mine nos passions et change nos coeurs, comme elle change nos cheveux et nos années."] There is always one toy above all that governs our childhood. A particular doll, rabbit, locomotive, teddy bear acquired long ago, for reasons inscrutable, the quality of the best-beloved. Separation from it was anguish; its presence lent comfort and security. Its smell and its touch rooted us in the world, beyond which our senses became lost and frightened us. It had a history of accidents and triumphs: forgotten in the garden, stolen by the dog, left on top of a night-lamp so that the hot bulb burnt a hole in its bottom, hidden away by an evil cousin, and then found, rescued, restored. There is a love relationship established with that one toy that, sometimes, outlasts all others. The special toy is the perfect lover, the one that is everything the child wants it to be, incarnating every fantasy and every desire. Love transforms it, beyond all explanation or reason. It is the one solid, unmov able, everpresent, faithful point of the universe on which the child can depend, no matter what. The special toy is our first lesson in consolation. On the shelf, in the trunk, by the night table, the collection of toys displays no obvious hierarchies. Their place in the bedroom's society isn't marked by age, size, species, retail price, chronology of acquisition, standards of beauty—only by the whim of their owner. This bear or that doll, this engine or that dinosaur have been chosen from among their peers because of reasons that are indefinable and that carry no justification. We can get rid of this toy or that, but never of Toys are the tools of memory: they remind us of the world and to the world. Toys say: this is how things are done outside, these are the creatures that exist beyond the playroom walls, this is the way in which they go about their business and dress and party and fight, this is their secret craft of building cities, of baking cakes, of riding horses. But also, later: here were children like you, here they learned and laughed, here they were frightened, here they sat and played and quarreled, here they stood up and left the room. Curiously, the models of the world left by the an- V cients in the tombs of their dead are identical to the toys they gave to their living children. In the Etruscan Museum in Cortona are displayed, side by side, miniature pots and basins, horses, dolls and weapons found both in a necropolis and in the ruins of a family home. It is as if the Etruscans (like the Egyptians, the Sumerians, the Romans) believed that the \ T Wooden hobby horse, Papantla, Veracruz; collection of Gabriel Martinez Covarrubias w 67 T Wooden hobby horse, Papantla, Veracruz; collection of Gabriel Martinez Covarrubias</page><page sequence="4">soul requires for its final journey the comfort of the toys that accompanied it in its childhood. Or perhaps it is the other way round. Perhaps through toys the child is taught that the world is made of ephemeral things, and he will not feel despoiled when crossing over into the world to come. We are given toys for birthdays, holidays, visits, as celebratory offerings, prizes, mementoes, they come into our lives marked by the hand that brought them. Because toys are given, they must appeal to the adult who buys them. They must accord with his standards, expectations, moral codes and aesthetic values. They must tempt him with the fantasy of childhood and the memory, true or false, of hap piness. They must tell him that this will redeem him, change the past or bring it back, mend a broken promise, fulfill an unattended need. They must declare: "The toy you give will be also yours." To the child, every gifted toy must say: "This is a mirror, this is what I think of you, this is who you are." ► Wooden toy revolver, Guanajuato, Guanajuato, 1981; Ruth D. Lechuga Collection / Museo Franz Mayer Tin, wood, felt, clay, fur are all materials that grant toys a sensitive life. They have a natural duration, they feel akin to our flesh and blood. They break or rust, burn and wear down, as we ourselves do in the course of time. They share our physical universe, the nature of common things. Plastic, instead, has no death to speak off. It can break, it can burn, but it does not return to dust and ashes. Broken, its fragments persist, ugly and useless. Burnt, it metamorphoses into solid blackness, into a shapeless form that haunts us with its absence. It never goes away. Sometimes, digging up the garden, a discolored tin horse will surface, the porcelain head of a doll, the wooden wheel of an ancient toy car; they have the decent aspect of relics, of bones, of ruins. But plastic toys don't resurrect: they persist, flushed with prosthetic pinkness, smooth as dentures. Children invent toys and also play with toys that others have invented for them. Why relinquish the absolute pleasure of creating and possessing your creation? Because the tempta tion of perfection is great, and who will not give up a kicked about tin in exchange for a smooth rubber ball, even if it means accepting adult rules implicit in the toy received? Play is not always the exercise of freedom and sometimes, in order to break free from impositions, the rules of the game must be subverted, the toy repossessed. The toys of Goethe's son August exemplify these two dif ferent species. On the one hand, we are told that August played with simple chestnuts which he threaded and hung from his neck, pretending that they were garlands of precious jewels and he a powerful Oriental monarch. On the other, August enjoyed setting up an elaborate toy theater with conventional cardboard figures representing Harlequin, Columbine, Doctor Faustus and other characters. To these (and here is the act of subversion) August would add a live cat during his perfor mances, "for the sake of realism." On one occasion, Goethe decided to buy for August a toy guillotine and asked his mother to order one from an enter prising Frankfurt manufacturer. Goethe's mother refused. "Dear son," she wrote. "Everything that you wish for is well and pleases me, but buying this abominable killing machine is something I won't do under any circumstances. If I were the authorities, its makers would be put in chains and I'd have the executioner burn the machine in public. What an idea, to have young people play with something so frightful! To put in their hands murder and bloodshed as an entertainment —no, certainly not!" Toys are symbols of identity: they tell us who we are. To take a toy in one's hand and play with it, to command it, possess it, make it do what one wills, conjures up the mirror image: that we too were held in someone's hand, that we too were com manded, possessed, made to obey. In the realm of make-believe, toys become scapegoats in a ritual of atonement or revenge. Suddenly the child's game of power reflects the power games of adults: the child treated as puppet, soldier, doll, dog, clown. Like Gulliver or Pantagruel, the child is a giant among pygmies, pulling his toys out of a box, holding them on his lap, turning his body into a stage for their performances, cuddling them to his breast or throwing them about, deaf to any protest. The child is a mountain in the playroom; in the bath, he's an island; in bed, he's the waves of the sea or a monstrous avalanche. But Gulliver in Lilliput is the flip side of Gulliver in Brob dingnag. In the world of adults, the child too is like a toy, prey to giant whims, subject to their care or carelessness, confronted with the huge and brutal nakedness of his captors. Their bare flesh (Gulliver tells us) was "very far from being a tempting Sight, or from giving me any other Emotions than those of Horror and Disgust. Their Skins appeared so coarse and un even, so variously colored when I saw them near, with a Mole here and there as broad as a Trencher, and Hairs hanging from it thicker than Pack-threads; to say nothing further concerning the rest of their Persons"? For the child, a toy is both an inanimate and a living thing, both identical and dissimilar to the creatures in the world around him. In believing that his toys have life, the child senses that he is crossing a dangerous, unmarked frontier. The second commandment, as if aware of this attraction, forbids us "to make unto thee graven images," forbids us to be, in effect, like a small god and create life out of inanimate matter. (Icono clasts take this to mean that we are not allowed to represent any living thing, be it a dog, a fish or a man.) Everywhere, however, children make toys out of dis carded objects: a piece of wood, a tin, a rope. For the child, this rag has a name, this stone a face, this box is a fortress, these bones live. Elaborate bought toys have complex lives and secret, unavowable defects. Toys that the child makes for himself are perfect, beyond reproach in the eyes of its maker, unaffected by the limits of human magic, possessors of a soul. According to the Talmudists, any representation of a living thing will turn to its human creator on the Day of Judg ment and demand that he grant it a soul. Since he will find 68 ► Wooden toy revolver, Guanajuato, Guanajuato, 1981; Ruth D. Lechuga Collection / Museo Franz Mayer</page><page sequence="5">himself incapable of accomplishing this, the transgressor will be flung into the everlasting fire. Our desire to make objects come to life overrides all fear of supernatural punishment. Every child dreams that, during the night, his toys will move by their own will, lead secret lives of which the adults know nothing. The child has named them, taught them how to walk, explained how they should behave. But what exactly do they do when he's not there to watch them? Where do they go when all is dark? In the eighteenth century, Rabbi Loewe of Prague (legend has it) created a golem, a man made out of mud, "to sweep the floor of his synagogue." The experiment failed. Shortly afterwards, the rabbi was obliged to return his golem to the dust after the creature ran amok in the ghetto. Our creations always exceed us. Like Rabbi Loewe, every child creates golems out the toys he loves and the secret suspicion that they might one day turn against him darkly feeds the thrill of play. The ancestors of these cautionary tales lurk in old mythological stories: that of the Trojan horse, hiding within itself its destructive secret, that of the marble doll Galatea who comes to life in the arms of her sculptor Pygmalion. Toy horses on wheels and statuettes of dolls are among the oldest toys we know. It is through usage that a child grants toys life. Play gives them movement, motive, personality. Toys become that which they are made to do. A doll can be a nurse, a mother, a fireman, a child. Uniforms help but are not all. Place a teddy bear in a circus ring or at a table, inside a train or in a bed, and his character changes. ^ Lola Cueto, Caballito, aquatint, 1947; collection of Museo Andrés Blaisten In various languages the word "play" is associated with the concepts of fun and mockery. In Arabic, la'iba means "to play" and "to make fun of." In Hebrew sahaq means "to play" and "to laugh out loud." In Latin ludere is both "to play" (as a child) and "to perform" (in the theater). The English word "play" retains these two last meanings. Every game is a representation, an act of magic that imitates or acts out another. Since it cannot be the original, there is in the imitation an undercurrent of fun or even making fun of that which is seriously real. A hand can make a toy plane fly, a tin soldier walk, a stuffed tiger pounce: that is magic. What happens in the adult world (like that which takes place on the TV or video screen) is in a sense too real. Magic requires a few imperfec tions, certain gaps through which the fantastic can enter. The doll that sleeps as the child sleeps, the clown that sits as the child sits, the horse that is wheeled along at the child's pace, the stories acted out by creatures of plastic and wood in the infinite space of the room tell him, over and over again, that nothing is impossible, only unbelievable and that a game of mirrors will reveal to him "how it's done." Play is imitation only in the sense that a magician imitates the creative processes of the world. The child does not merely want to observe: he wants to act out what he observes, bringing it to life again, starting again from fresh. Experience lies not in experience itself but in the imitation of experience. At the turn of a corner, in a house to which we were taken or in a park where it suddenly grew too dark to go on playing, we lost a soldier, a Nintendo, a few marbles or a ball. We thought we'd find them again the following day, the com ing week, the next time we played there. Toys have infinite patience, we thought. They'll wait. Some were replaced but, of course, no toy is ever identical to another. Some we forgot. Some we grieved for. A certain website offers to find any toy we want, for the sake of nostalgia. But it isn't nostalgia. Regret, perhaps. And guilt. It is said that the afterworld was invented not so much for the sake of some ponderous idea of justice, but in order to console us with the hope that any loss may not be eternal. The toys we've lost (like the friends we've lost) remain somewhere in the past, uncorrupted and incorruptible. Memory betters them, restores a lost button, a faulty wheel. Fixed in time, in a place we can no longer name, they wait unchanged, healthy and whole, without further fear of crack or tear. 'When I was a child," says St Paul, "I spoke as a child, I under stood as a child, I thought as a child, but when I became a man, I put away childish things." The confession, which is usually understood as an acknowledgement of adult responsibility, can also be read as a regret. The knowledge acquired with growth is, in great measure, conventional, and implies the relinquishing of ideals, the curtailment of free thought, the acceptance of a common measure. Speaking, understanding, thinking as a child does not mean exercising inferior func tions, enjoying gifts of lesser quality. For the child, the world of make-believe does not replace that of concrete reality: both coexist on the same plane, per fectly distinguishable one from the other, but equally valuable and strong. A toy, for the child, is both a thing made out of cloth and a comforting lover, a metal object with wheels and a powerful engine that can brave mountains, a pile of wooden cubes and an impregnable fortress, the character from a comic book or film and a fantastic creature come to life to continue, here in this room, its neverending story. Adults divide the world between "childish things" and things that are judged serious, unaware of how ridiculous, piti ful, silly or mad most of their pursuits really are. Children know that they too are guilty of these qualities, but also that their toys are time-proven tools for learning about the world, for finding out who they themselves are and who their playmates might be, for making sense of the playful, senseless universe. • 69 ^ Lola Cueto, Caballito, aquatint, 1947; collection of Museo Andrés Blaisten</page><page sequence="6">A Lacquerware toy ladder, Santa Ana Tecoanapa, Guerrero; collection of Gabriel Martinez Covarrubias T Francisco Jáuregui Ruelas, tin spinning top, Guadalajara, Jalisco, 2013; collection of AngélicaTijerina, La Esquina Museo del Juguete Popular Mexicano Playthings I Rabindranath Tagore | Child, how happy you are sitting in the dust, playing with a broken twig all the morning. I smile at your play with that little bit of a broken twig. I am busy with my accounts, adding up figures by the hour. Perhaps you glance at me and think, "What a stupid game to spoil your morning with!" Child, I have forgotten the art of being absorbed in sticks and mud-pies. I seek out costly playthings, and gather lumps of gold and silver. With whatever you find you create your glad games, I spend both my time and my strength over things I never can obtain. In my frail canoe I struggle to cross the sea of desire, and forget that I too am playing a game. SMALL DISAPPEARANCES Games of a City Childhood I Carlos Espejel | For kids in Mexico City, each celebration and each toy was clearly associated with a specific time. That is to say that over the year, there was a period of time when you played with a certain thing or another, but never two things at once. And different toys formed part of a system that captivated children's imaginations throughout the year. This is why, for kids in Mexico City, the year wasn't divided into months, but rather into seasons: kite-flying season in February and March, which are so windy that we still have the saying febrero loco y marzo otro poco (February is insane, and March a little more again); the season of huesitos or apricot pits in June when this fruit is in season; the season of tops, of yoyos, of the cup and-ball toy, of marbles... one after another, and ending with the pre-Christmas posadas, only to begin again with the toys brought as presents by the Three Kings on Epiphany—January 6. Indeed, each toy had its season, and you could not play with anything else until it was over. Suddenly, a kid arrived with marbles in his hands and in his pockets, without any forewarning or having prearranged anything with the group, and right then and there all of us knew the time had come to forget about the previous game and to start playing a new one. That's how it was year after year, during periods of happiness that no one could precisely measure, because they didn't have a specific duration; they did not begin or end on any special day, and yet, mysteriously, children distinguished them clearly in their minds. I am certain adult Mexicans re member this still. Around each of these popular toys or games, there was a whole range of terms that provid ed precise rules as to how they were played. With huesitos, for instance—apricot pits dyed different colors with aniline, which, depend ing on their shape, were called caballones, piscachitas or pepitas—boys played bunny hole or bull ring while girls played odds and evens or garambullo. We challenged our friends to do bold tricks with spinning tops: this invariably ruined them, even if you added a screw to its tip, with its head filed down, so the top would spin more smoothly and was better adapted for defensive maneuvers. With yoyos, you could perform tricks like "the sleeper," "rock the baby" or "around the world," as well as others that were as difficult to rehearse as they were to show off. With cup-and-ball toys, some of which were decorated with studs, you asked the other player "to do a hundred," counting in increments of five, with capiruchos worth ten points. There were other throws for the truly skillful, which were worth fifty or loo points each. When it came to marbles, we fired them with our knuck les or with the tip of the nail (this last technique was somewhat criticized) to play the cuadrito or the bunny hole and many other games that our current activities have made us forget. With marbles, I insist, we used a greater number of terms and rules, which we agreed upon ahead of time, before the game started; the terminology was a kind of language in itself, as we spoke of chiras pelonas (you're out), chiras al tiro (you're out right away), atajes y arriesgues forzosos (mandatory shortcuts and risks) and of calacasy palomas ("kills" and "kisses"). Or we said safin, safón es perdonado to be able to repeat a failed shot. And if all this were not enough, there was a series of tricks to which you resorted in order to stop your opponent from winning: the classic saying císcalo, císcalo, diablo panzón ("mess it up, mess it up, you potbellied devil") to make him foul his shot, or forcing him to shoot between small obstacles when you were really trying to make it hard for him. Using these obstacles was "playing dirty," but you did so unless your opponent asked you ahead of time to play fair; or you could also ask for altas y bajas para mis barajas to make the shot easier, whether on the ground or from higher up, so that, if your marble fell into the hole again, the game was over. Then you had no other choice but to pay up what you had bet and lost (debts were called cuicas or cuirias). There were different kinds of marbles: agüitas, clear as water or colored liquid, which we bought at the neighborhood notions store; ponches, of a single color, and agates, which were imported and the most highly valued ones. But there were also more inexpensive marbles, made of clay, sometimes painted in glossy purple, red, blue or grey; they no longer exist today, and indeed broke or were chipped at the first hard knock. Girls also played marbles. They normally played jacks, unless they were capable of firing marbles as hard as boys— those few that could were highly respected. All these toys were of course complemented by others that were the fruit of kids' imaginations; these were simpler toys perhaps, but they were no less important, and kids used to make them from scratch—like slingshots, made with a forked branch before you could buy those made of steel rods; like rubber bands, which we used with pieces of orange peel to attack other kids in a painful game called ligazos while we shouted, "park, rubber band snap, kick or slap"; like the peashooters made of glass or cardboard, which we used to shoot paper darts or small pieces of hard candy; or like the rather entertaining game of botones, in which you double threaded a button to the middle finger of each hand: as you spread your hands apart rhythmically, the button spun at high speed. Sometimes you replaced the button with bottle caps that had been hammered flat and filed down in order to cut your opponent's thread. • Translated by Richard Moszka. 70 I Rabindranath Tagore | k Lacquerware toy ladder, Santa Ana Tecoanapa, Guerrero; collection of Gabriel Martinez Covarrubias I Carlos Espeiel | T Francisco Jáuregui Ruelas, tin spinning top, Guadalajara, Jalisco, 2013; collection of AngélicaTijerina, La Esquina Museo del Juguete Popular Mexicano Richard Moszka.</page><page sequence="7">SMALL MEMORIES Requiem for Forgotten and Endangered Toys When thinking about toys, images begin to flow from memory: that little contraption you had your entire child hood, though you have no idea where it ended up; the pieces you used to be able to buy anywhere, and that are now im possible to find; those toys made of odd materials that got lost, disappeared... sometimes it is worth taking a moment to pay homage to the small things in our everyday lives that make us smile, since big things are usually celebrated without fail. The Tarasca I Marita Martínez del Río de Redo | The tarasca is a popular toy that has entirely disappeared from the Mexican landscape; it resembles a winged dragon whose tail ends in a scorpion's sting. García Cubas described it as "the green cardboard tarasca with wooden wheels," presenting an illustration of a child carrying one in his hands. Vanegas Arroyo published a similar etching of a tarasca in June of 1897, indicating that this toy fell into disuse relatively recently. We have not been able to find, in markets or at fairs, any kind of surviving relation to the ferocious tarasca, which also symbolizes a gift, as we are reminded by this brief verse: It's the day of Corpus Christi and time for every girl and boy, though the sky may be stormy, to ask for their tarasca toy. The image of the tarasca originated in medieval drag ons. One of its legends—that of the Tarasque—came from southern France. The animal would emerge from a river to devour its victims, until Saint Martha annihilated it from her sanctuary in Sainte-Marie. In honor of this victory, the poet-king René decreed that an annual procession be held, during which a wicker dragon would be paraded through the streets. • Translated by Michelle Suderman.

Then wax was used in the making of polychrome Jalisco, 1992; figurines for reliquaries, lockets and small votive offerings juguete Mexicano (figurines such as angels or human arms or legs, commonly Collection / referred to as milagros), medallions, decorative candles and Papalote artificial flowers. Wax was also employed for the creation of Museo del Niño life-sized effigies of saints and martyrs, which contained small relics such as bones or objects that had belonged to the saint or martyr, and that were otherwise kept in specially adapted niches and large urns in various altars and altarpieces in cathedrals and other churches in Mexico. Since the technique and use of the material originated in Spain's wax sculpting industry, traditional wax toys have been limited by the purpose for which they were usually created; therefore, most objects and figures made in wax, which can only be described as toys in a relative sense, are largely put to reli gious uses. Such is the case with the figurines made to populate nativity scenes, representing various biblical personages—the Holy Family, the Three Wise Men guided by the shining Star of Bethlehem—who are followed by a whole entourage, sometimes t Mariana consisting of up to twenty or more figures, such as angels and Martinez, wax shepherds. Other characters, decorated gracefully and with and sawdust great propriety, include Adam and Eve in paradise, Jesus in the doll, Mexico city; temple speaking to the doctors, dramatic scenes of the cruci- collection of fixion, and so on, as well as incompatible flora and fauna from Gabriel Martinez various parts of the world, mixed together to decorate nativity Covarrubias scenes during the traditional posadas or Christmas festivities. Of course, these wonderful nativity figures, generally made in three different sizes—five, ten and sixteen inches high—are based on miniature polychrome wooden sculp- 1 tures, richly decorated with baroque garments, made in Mexico since the seventeenth century, sometimes using the soft, white and spongy wood of the flame coral tree (Erythrina coralloides). This wood was used by indigenous artisans to carve their idols, and it is still employed to make masks, since its lightness and softness make it an excellent material for carving. [...] Wax toys have now practically disappeared from stores. Not long ago you could still buy miniature toy trajineras (the long, flat-bottomed boats of Xochi milco canals) loaded with fruit and vegetables, and carrying the traditionally dressed oarsman and indig enous woman selling her wares, all made of molded multicolored wax. Other figures were also produced to be sold specially during the feast of Corpus Christi, during Holy Week or Mexico's fiestas patrias. The only sur viving examples of such molded multicolored wax objects are the little lambs, doves, ducks, cows, dogs, castles and other everyday figures (now made of paraffin) which are still sold during the posada season, as well as various kinds of colorful, life-sized and realistic-looking fruit (grapes, mangos, etc.), which are used as kitchen decorations. Wax is a very moldable material that can easily be sculpted into any number of objects and figures. It has been of particular importance in Mexico, where it has been put to a wide range of uses for religious purposes; also, before the advent of the daguerreotype, portraits were not only made by specialist painters, but also by some sculp tors who had shown impressive skill at mastering the use of colored wax. [...] Natural Cum Toys made of natural gum are certainly the rarest type, or at least they are not produced in such large numbers as other kinds, and they are practically unheard of in Mexico City. Despite people's general lack of interest in them, some toys made of gum were apparently sent abroad and their originality attracted plenty of curiosity and commercial interest.

Talpa, in the state of Jalisco, is the center of gum toy pro duction, and the image of the local Virgin of Talpa is also made out of gum, according to the artist Jorge Enciso. Enciso also considers it is very likely that, before the Spanish conquest, indigenous craftsmen used this material to make molds, us ing a method similar to the lost-wax process in order to shape gold and copper objects. The natural "bubble gum" that had a peculiar odor, came in different colors and used to be sold at kiosks in streets and parks clearly has a long history. The gum used for toys indeed has a particularly un pleasant smell; the scientific name of the tree it comes from, Manihot foetida, or "fetid spurge," indicates the inherently disagreeable odor given off by its sap, which is extracted from the tree through incisions on the trunk, the same way natural rubber is tapped. It is worth transcribing word for word a curi ous description of the toy makers' gum preparation method: "This gum could have many uses, but it is only employed for a limited number of things: toys, flowers, dolls and greet ing cards. The gum for these objects is prepared as follows: you make a cut in the tree and allow the milky sap to drip into a cup, filled with cold water so it will congeal. You then knead the gum with two stones to get rid of impurities, mak ing it softer and more elastic. You can then stretch it into strands on a wooden frame. These threadlike filaments are used to make the aforesaid objects, exclusively by hand. The miniatures look very interesting, and are painted in vari ous colors to make them even more alluring. These toys are not affected by changes in temperature, and furthermore, given their elasticity they do not break when dropped on the floor." • Translated by Quentin Pope. Ritual Ancestry of the Toys of Tehuantepec I Andrés Henestrosa | There is a region of Oaxaca that is well known for many things but not so much for folk art: the Isthmus of Te huantepec. Besides the embroidery on women's garments, for which embroiderers have invented leaf and flower designs that nature has as yet failed to mimic; gold filigree work; certain kinds of textiles; and some pottery items, such as glazed jars, strainers, and cooking pots which are also ornamental; the typical craft of towns on the Isthmus are the toys that are sold in markets at the end and beginning of every year. And this is what I wish to address in what follows. At the main markets in Juchitán and Tehuantepec, clay toys of various shapes and sizes are sold in the morning on New Year's Day. In the older version of Zapotee spoken in Tehuantepec, toys that have a human figure are called tonka, and in the more recently evolved Zapotee of Juchitán, tangu: tonka-yu or tangu-yu mean "clay dolls." Alongside them are sold figures of animals, mainly horses mounted by strange jockeys. Why are these toys only sold on New Year's Day? We don't exactly know, but we believe that it might have to do with when the Spanish conquistadors took over our lands. A changeover in the worship of local native gods: in the distant past, this could have explained the custom ofbuying clay statuettes during a cer tain period of the Zapotee year. Missionaries, viewed with reason as the true conquistadors of Mexico, only changed the dates of the indigenous feast days and rituals to lend them a veneer of Christianity; in other words, they gave customs new meanings. Yet ultimately, the Indians kept on worshipping their idols, praying in native languages, making sacrifices according to tradition. If that had not been the case, it would be hard to explain why there are clay dolls painted in odd colors placed on altars next to the statue of the patron saint of Juchitán, Saint Vincent Ferrer. These figures, which have now become toys, embody the latent concepts of the taboo, the charm, the fetish. If this were not so, how could a doll go from occupying a place on an altar on certain days of the year to becoming a toy once again when given back to a child? For all ancient peoples, effigies or dolls (i.e. toys) that did not have a useful purpose from the outset suffered the same fate: they became taboos, charms, fetishes. At the Hispanic Society Museum of New York, I have seen figures identical to the ones sold on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec on the morning of New Year's Day: there they were not toys, but rather deities from certain indigenous towns in Ecuador. But there is something else: the ancient Zapotees believed that every person's life was tied at birth to that of another being: a bird, a fish, any kind of creature really, which they called^enáa. Once the shaman determined the newborn's "double"—this is whatgenda means—his parents made him a toy representing it, so he would identify with it by spending time around it, acquir ing its qualities, in turn becoming the animal that protected him. Putting the animal figurine in the child's hands is a way of familiarizing him with his double orgenda, until their identities melded into one: he became a lion cub after spending so much time with lions, as Ezekiel would say. This belief was so deeply rooted in the Zapotee psyche that Father Burgoa, though he abhorred and censured it, nonetheless kept telling the story of a rider who had died while crossing a stream after his mount kicked a crocodile to death which was the rider's double. Zapotees today no longer derive their names from ani mals, but they continue to attribute the traits of certain animals to each other. Thus, they say that someone looks like a bird or a fish—not physically, but in terms of their psychological traits. But where this totemic concern is most evident is in the making of the toys that are sold at markets in the Isthmus—frogs, fish, owls, coyotes. Children buy them every year on New Year's Day: "Pick your double," Zapotee mothers often tell them. But over and above all these considerations, we must say that these figures have truly surprising shapes and colors, and they beg to be compared with, say, animal figurines from Crete, anthropomorphic Etruscan statues, or certain pieces of pottery from Mallorca. Figurines modeled in the secular pre-Colombian sculptural style, dressed in the indigenous fashions of today; some of these, holding an infant in their arms, remind us of Christian figures; horses that are inter pretations of those that the Spaniards brought with them and that are spotted like tigers, like a Zapotee prototype of a totem; jockeys who do not ride but rather stand atop their mounts, which have small rabbit-like tails and the muzzle, head and ears of a deer. In other words, horses born as hybrids of indigenous and European fauna. And in this, as well as in music, our culture finds its most accurate expression, when it achieves a harmony between the Indian and the Spanish. • Translated by Richard Moszka. 72 Quentin Pope. ▼ Clay flute, Ocumicho, Michoacán; collection of Gabriel Martinez Covarrubias i Andrés Henestrosa</page><page sequence="9">Diminutive Papier-Mâché Fantasies I Francisco Javier Hernández | Miniatures The outsized importance of miniatures in our country can only have an explanation rooted in the psychology of the Mexican people. It is truly disconcerting to watch a nation of people inherently so artistic, imaginative and dynamic, con stantly test the limits of their patience and willpower by engaging in the strange task of fabricating an endless array of miniatures. Miniaturism for Mexicans is a veritable display of patience and skill, but it also clearly implies an indescribable fear of making things that a healthy mind has no trouble conceiving when it is free of prejudice, bitterness, resentments and disil lusions, and this is indeed a serious symptom of insecurity. Mean-spirited observers might see the penchant for making miniatures as the pathological result of a dwarfed, immature mindset that lacks the full command of its abilities to conceive of producing a work on a normal scale. Was the immortal Mexican poet Ramón López Velarde ruminating on this series of psychological conventionalisms when in his Suave Patria, he breathed life into poetic tropes that are the living expression of this reality? 'Your image is the Palacio Nacional / the same grandeur, and the identical / stature of a boy and a thimble." Mexicans' baroque mindset shows their upsetting need to recreate themselves in voluptuous detail—their instinct to follow with traditional elation a tendency to overdecorate using minute ornaments, to transform everything into lavish expressions of visual art. This was essentially the nature of the ancient Mexicans, always eager to express reality in symbols, in art that often reveals the fantastic concepts and mythical religious conventionalisms of the underlying aesthetic cre ation in a surfeit of trivial details. However, it is certain that, from an artistic point of view, these instances of extremism ultimately seem to conceal, with their multiple complexities, the downfall of primordial ideas, of crucial concepts. The style which we normally refer to as "Mexican Churrigueresque" is the prime example of the extremes that the stonemasons, carvers and painters of religious images could reach in their unrestrained urges to decorate façades and altarpieces, among other things. This synthesis of manifestations and concerns is a curious phenomenon: the Mexican character seems to express itself best when the scaffolding firmly upholding its original principles and traditions begins to buckle. The quest for detail, the recreation of trifling things is an escape hatch for the Mexican ftill of resentment and failed plans; the more he looks for simplicity, to simplify his existence, the deeper he buries himself in the maze of his own made-up complications, sometimes with genuine pleasure. Mexicans are complicated despite outward appearances, which is why, in the way they express themselves, they are always wavering between drama and comedy, tying their lives' most cherished values to the incredible extremes to which their thirst for affectation and absurd, elaborately fabricated problems may take them. For this very reason, along every step of the way, Mexicans and the history of Mexico derail the normal course of events because of some unforeseen detail that is lacking in any real importance; tragedy in these cases is always the result of a mere mistake or misinterpretation, a reflection of inconsequential frivolity. Therefore, I consider that the miniaturist tendency is based, in its most simple expression as well as in its most complex technical displays, on the same unconscious im perative that is constantly renewed in the collective psyche, the bursting forth of a natural instinct always willing to come up with big projects; these projects come about at every turn, like a vision of grandeur that could become reality on quite a normal scale. And yet, perversely, just as the shadow cast by the illusory goal grows larger, one's vision begins to shrink, as if a bright light in the rigging of national events were making us see gremlins on the stage of our failed hopes. One thus easily shifts from the massive pyramid and the enormous cathedral to the tendency towards miniaturism—from colossal statues to the minutiae of inane fetishism and tiny imaginations. The miniature is precisely this: a haven for frustrated dreams and failed ventures. We could just as well build a lavish, monumental church for all eternity as enclose an entire scene from folkloric tradition in a single walnut or peanut shell, wherein the characters are no more than tiny fleas dressed up as human beings... This is how we sometimes see ourselves reflected in the mirror of our contradictions... We can see miniatures all around us—in folk toys. In mates in Mexico's prisons, especially provincial ones, tradi tionally while away their time making any number of minia ture objects: tiny guitars or chess and domino sets made of bone; little hats made of palm or horsehair. An entire kitchen can be equipped with diminutive pots and pans, made with all sorts of materials. The details of ordinary-sized furnishings are reproduced on an astonishingly minute scale. We could give thousands of other examples. People with extraordinary patience and skillful hands sometimes spend their whole lives creating a massive project... yet the whole thing on a miniature scale! Mr. Antonio Paz y Puente, from the state of Puebla, tells the story of Lieutenant Colonel José María Garrido and his brother: both of them were also from the city of Puebla and fought in battles during the era of Maximilian. It occurred to these men to use scissors, paper and cardboard to recreate the battle of Cinco de Mayo in miniature. Their endeavor resulted in twenty thousand small cardboard soldiers, one hundred miniscule bronze cannons—faithfully depicting the forces of Comonfort's army at the time. The little soldiers measured about five eighths of an inch high, and the cannons were half an inch tall. Recently, Mr. Paz y Puente told us that the descendants of Lieutenant Colonel Garrido had donated two hundred of these miniature soldiers and fifty cannons, among various other curiosities from the period, to Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History (inah); these objects were of course sent to the museum established in the historic fort on the Cerro de Loreto in Puebla. Apparently, it took the two military men between 1880 and 1900 to complete their painstaking task: twenty years of their lives spent on this most unlikely display of extraordinary patience! Papier-Mâché Toys Cardboard is another one of those materials that can be trans formed into interesting arts and crafts. Shredded, mixed with a binder (usually glue) and made into a paste, it can be used to create a myriad of toys of different shapes and sizes, according to the whim of the manufacturer: masks, dolls, rattles, piñata heads, toritos [a portable structure in the shape of a bull used for launching fireworks at village fiestas] and the famous Judas figures commonly found during Lent. The town of Celaya, in the state of Guanajuato, probably has the longest tradition of making papier-mâché toys; toy makers are organized by neighborhoods, including Tierras Negras, El Zapote and San Juan. Mexico City is also a major Q) A Sergio Felipe Olvera Ibarra, miniatures made of papier mâché, wood and calabash, Puebla, Puebla, 2011; collection of Angélica Tijerina, La Esquina Museo del Juguete Popular Mexicano 73 I Francisco Javier Hernández | A Sergio Felipe Olvera Ibarra, miniatures made of papier mâché, wood and calabash, Puebla, Puebla, 2011; collection of Angélica Tijerina, La Esquina Museo del Juguete Popular Mexicano</page><page sequence="10">▼ Miniature cupboard with carved flower designs, Cuanajo, Michoacán; collection of Angélica Tijerina, La Esquina Museo del Juguete Popular Mexicano center of production, but the highest quality examples of these objects are made elsewhere. There is a vast range of papier-mâché toys. Apart from the classic dolls with articulated legs and arms—priceless ob jects whose power of illusion advantageously replaces, in the hands of poor children, the porcelain toys with golden locks and moving eyes of the rich little girls—there are also brightly colored rattles polished with Japan oil, painted with parrots, clowns and other figures, and containing small pebbles that give the attractive toy its sound. Who does not have childhood memories of playing on a classic papier-mâché hobby horse? This eternal favorite of chil dren, with its small leather ears, metal hoop stirrups and stiff wooden legs mounted on a board with wheels, is an absolute necessity for the little ones to hone their horse-riding skills, something that may indeed eventually lead them to perform feats of professional equestrianism. Mexicans are known for their typical manly passion for charrería [Mexico's national sport, involving displays of daring maneuvers on horseback]. Dr. Atl said that "Mexicans love horses, as much or even more so than Arabs do. It is essentially only the indigenous people who are largely uninterested in horses and who prefer to use their own two legs." My theory is that this might be because their collective memory still contains traces of a profound terror for the historic acts of savagery of the white "god" and his mount, which were initially perceived as a single entity, according to local legends. [...] Smaller hobby horses are also fabricated, meant to be pulled along by a string; strips of rabbit fur are glued onto them to form the mane and tail. On larger specimens, the mane is simply painted on, and a sheaf of agave or yucca fiber is added as a tail. The little horses almost always have a touch of irony or optimism, that is, their makers tend to spontaneously lend them affable human expressions. For all these things, the horse is undoubtedly one of those animals that are a favorite model for makers of all kinds of toys. [...] Thus we have seen how papier-mâché is also, in the hand of the folk artist, an invaluable material that can be used to produce wonders. It is true that cardboard paste is normally pressed into molds to make toys such as hobby horses, dolls with moving legs and arms, and piñata heads—which, in fact, as with Judas figures, often represent real public figures or well-known imaginary characters. But even if these objects are produced in large numbers using a mold, each individual toy is still undeniably a work of art on account of its many details. Folk artists always lend careful attention to each individual creation, with an eye for detail in terms of its form, its emo tional power of expression, whether dramatic or satirical, and the admirably realistic effects they often achieve, even when using rather conventional colors or contrasting materials such as wood, clay, cotton, agave fiber, horsehair, wool, etc. Some toys made of papier-mâché are true works of sculptural art. The creator's aesthetic talent can be seen in every detail; in the inspiration behind the object, the rich imagination, the skill to achieve truly alluring (and sometimes fantastical) decorative effects using just a few brushstrokes and combinations of matte or glossy colors—as can be seen in the thousands of expressions depicted on the masks that are sold in large numbers, especially during the pre-Lent carnival season, some ofwhich simultaneously represent instances of sharp eyed, popular satire. • Translated by Quentin Pope. Miniature I Gaston Bachelard | But the imagination deserves better than that. In point of fact, imagination in miniature is natural imagination which appears at all ages in the daydreams of born dreamers. Indeed, the element of amusement must be removed, if we are to find its true psychological roots. For instance, one might devote a serious reading to this fragment by Hermann Hesse, which appeared in Fontaine (N°57, p. 725). A prisoner paints a landscape on the wall of his cell showing a miniature train entering a tunnel. When his jailers come to get him, he asks them "politely to wait a moment, to allow me to verify some thing in the little train in my picture. As usual, they started to laugh, because they considered me to be weak-minded. I made myself very tiny, entered into my picture and climbed into the little train, which started moving, then disappeared into the darkness of the tunnel. For a few seconds longer, a bit of flaky smoke could be seen coming out of the round hole. Then this smoke blew away, and with it the picture, and with the picture, my person. " How many times poet-painters, in their prisons, have broken through walls, by way of a tunnel! How many times, as they painted their dreams, they have escaped through a crack in the wall! And to get out of prison all means are good ones. If need be, mere absurdity can be a source of freedom. And so, if we follow the poets of miniature sympathetical ly, if we take the imprisoned painter's little train, geometrical contradiction is redeemed, and Representation is dominated by Imagination. Representation becomes nothing but a body of expressions with which to communicate our own images to others. In line with a philosophy that accepts the imagination as a basic faculty, one could say, in the manner of Schopen hauer: "The world is my imagination." The cleverer I am at miniaturizing the world, the better I possess it. But in doing this, it must be understood that values become condensed and enriched in miniature. Platonic dialectics of large and small do not suffice for us to become cognizant of the dynamic virtues of miniature thinking. One must go beyond logic in order to experience what is large in what is small. • From the Workshop of the Imagination I RaúlAcEVES I Toys emerge from the workshop of the imagination with startled eyes, seeing the world into which they have been born for the first time. From ancient regions and dreams locked in transparent sarcophagi or silent boxes, they awaken to the call of creative hands in the tangible space of each child hood. As the poet Hugo Gutiérrez Vega described it, The break of day is playing with its lights in the courtyard they are the children of the dawn the infants of joyful spirit this childhood of everyone and everything. If toys represent the childhood of objects, joy embodied as matter, then they must want to be their own best vendors, 74 i Gaston Bachelard ▼ Miniature cupboard with carved flower designs, Cuanajo, Michoacán; collection of Angélica Tijerina, La Esquina Museo del Juguete Popular Mexicano RaúlAcEVES I</page><page sequence="11">going down all the streets in the world calling: "Marbles... rag dolls... clay dolls... yoyos... spinning tops... wooden acrobats miniatures... lead and tin soldiers... Ferris wheels... kites... calaveras... chimeras... lotería... snakes and ladders... corn husk mules..." Thus each toy pronounces its name and represents its image, and nourishes the hope of becoming a game that remains alive and helps others to live. May you, dear reader, former child or recent child, experience the miracle of car rying on playing forever, though your changing needs may demand a different toy. Whistles, ratchets and flutes; bugles, drums and rattles; ratchets that imitate the sound of frogs, cicadas, bells; pop corn, exploding chickpeas... Anything that makes noise in the sky or on the ground, a festive clamor, a celebration of life's birthday, an imitation of the sounds of the earth and of animal languages, an enthusiastic breaking of the silence. And so much more, as Miguel Garcia Ascencio suggests in his poem "A Wonder ofWood and Slotted Metal": A mouth organ is more than the harmonies of a harmonica on the lips. A goblin on the scale of a child, if we want it to, it lives in our pocket, next to the marbles, the top and the spinning disc. Amid such company, it is not unusual for some to expropriate from the others their sonority. The toys interchange their voices, which mysteriously issue from someplace. Only children know where this is, but they don't know how to explain it. This is what the questions posed by Miguel Garcia Ascencio's poem "The Most Raucous of Games" lead us to conclude: A marble, you say, can roll anywhere, bear the force of every touch. A marble is not just a piece of glass; looking closely, it is a mirror drawn in the colors of all children's eyes. Yoyos, planets that move up and down, tied to the index finger, draw their rapid flight, their circles of colors and light, on the transparent paper that is the air. Now they wait patiently for the hand to launch them again on a precise tra jectory, always ending up where they started. Like Antonio Deltoro's yoyo: The color ascends along the track of string devouring its path through the sky Toys spin, fly, whistle and come to life in the hands and the five senses of the child who takes them for a walk, like veri table pets. Like little barrels, as colorful as serapes, the cup-and-ball toys twirl like stout acrobats, with the accuracy of whoever controls the precise moment of their flight into the void, where they coexist with the very origin of their movement. Cup-and-ball toys play at returning to their masters, like trained puppies that are docile under the hand that pats them and sends them away again and again, held only by a slender cord, to the adventure of being light. Good cup-and-ball toys sweat with fear, and that's why they smell that way, so they can be trusted. • Translated by Michelle Suderman. k Pedro Ortega Lozano, papel picado butterfly with rubber-band mechanism, Mexico City; collection of Gabriel Martinez Covarrubias Muñecas The music spins in its box. So much sound in such a small space. How might the musicians be arranged within? In which corner of the incomprehensible did they decide to place the piano? And the audience and the seats? The balls have stopped their bouncing. They sleep spheri cally and remember the course of their flights, the walls off which they ricocheted, the feet that kicked them until they bruised, the thorns that deflated their spirits. They also re call the goals they made, the windows they broke, the pots they knocked over. Balls are full of memories; that is why they are still round, though the air may have escaped from them long ago. Whether they have clay or glass bodies, marbles pos sess a wide variety of sizes and names: agüitas (dearies), ágatas (aggies), cayucos (boulders), ponchos (torn bowlers), chirinitas (peewees), flores (flowers), cacalotas (bumbooz ers)... they strike each other in the gravitational circle of la choya, the bunny hole, like tiny colliding worlds, thrusting themselves toward a chaotic failure. With cries of chiras pelas ("you're out"), no hagas hulla ("don't make a stink") and la chapuza acusa ("cheaters beware"), children articulate the oldest laws on earth, a jurisdiction that is born from the rules of the game. Marbles—perfect ideas—hurtle neutrally to wherever the hand's trigger propels them. Raúl Bañuelos continues the dialogue: I Alberto Manguel | What does the child play with when he plays with a doll? The body of a doll is always slightly disturbing. A doll's body is not our own and yet it possesses the same landscape. Its nakedness is ours: to strip it of its clothes is to perform something forbidden on ourselves. Especially the hyperrealist dolls made out of lifelike plastic. The pink, shiny skin reveals its inner secrets but we know that there is more. Small breasts heave on the torso, the modest belly delicately swells, but something is missing. Arms, legs and head fit into sockets, obscenely, and when we pull them out, the holes reveal the grey, dead stuffing or else a puzzling emptiness. This is not how we are put together, this is not how we become whole. Someone is telling a lie. These are games of assembling and taking apart. Like Dr. Frankenstein at work, the child creates impossible creatures out of a variety of pieces. There are conventional procedures to follow, Mr. Potatohead or the Transformers, for instance, programmed metamorphoses. Pin on a nose, twist the body round and, hey presto, a new being emerges. Or else there are unscripted, disturbing ones. The child un dresses the dolls, then takes them apart. The sections of the body are displayed as in a butcher shop or a murder scene. Heads are transposed, limbs inverted. Cruelty is an acquired skill. Dolls owe their existence to the child who plays with them.

It demands to be lifted, to be handled, to be brought back to life. The French word poupée (like the English "poppet" and the German Puppe) derives from the Latin pupa meaning "a girl" and, by extension, used to designate any small image like a trinket or a votive offering. Pupa is also the name given to the insect in passive development between the larva and the imago state, that is to say, a being in suspension, a latent presence, a life implicit, something about to be. The simple, schematic dolls of antiquity were for every child: fashion rendered them aristocratic. In the Middle Ages, dressed according to the latest styles, they become the prop erty of the rich and noble. Appearance overrode function and, in the hands of the powerful, dolls became emblems rather than playthings, and instead of being confined to the nursery, crossed borders as ambassadors of good will. Among royalty, men offered swords; women, dolls. What came first? The doll-like figures used for religious rituals, or the dolls made for the rituals of children? No game with dolls is innocent. The building of the doll house, the setting-up of a toy classroom and the bottle feeding, the wardrobe, the ceremonies of the bedroom, obviously play out stories perceived in the adult world but also spring from deeper places that teach the child who he is and how he is sup posed to behave. Playing at being an adult allows him to learn to be a child, seeing himself outside himself, as if on a stage on which he is actor, director and audience. We learn to walk, to eat, to interact with the world not only through imitative play but through perception of the imitation. Seeing what we do allows us to become who we are, or to change towards that which we are. T Doll wearing traditional costume, Tehuantepec, Oaxaca, 1973; Ruth D. Lechuga Collection / Museo Franz Mayer The doll's house is the house within the house, the rooms within the room. In this ideal space of perfectly organized compartments—the upstairs bedrooms, the bathroom, the dining room, living room, library and kitchen—everything is visible, aboveboard. Harmoniously divided and rigorously furnished, the doll's house is a miniature Arcadia: here no one is afraid, no one shouts or becomes violent, no one is jealous, spiteful, cowardly, no one is a torturer or a bully. Everyone fulfills a storybook role; everyone has his or her place. In the doll's house children are loved, parents are admired, dogs are well treated. Sometimes, however, a darker atmosphere fills the place. The mood changes, the rules of the game are altered. Furni ture is shifted, shutters are closed, wild animals are allowed to roam about. One of the dolls is found in the wrong room doing something unexpected, another upsets the table so beautifully set for tea, a third one trips on the stairs and tumbles down with a crash, a fourth climbs up on the roof and gets stuck in the chimney. The Baby puts the Mummy to bed, Daddy sticks his head into the oven, the dog is in the cupboard and won't come out. A fire engine crashes into the side wall. A di nosaur stands at the entrance waiting to pounce on anyone trying to leave. Then, without warning, the game comes to an end. In Queen Mary's doll's house in Windsor Castle there is a toy nursery with a toy doll's house. This doll's house suggests a spiraling mise en abyme. Nestled within a casde where a real family lives, is this perfect simulacrum of a house fit for a princess, in which no doll ever suffers, everyone is happy and toy children play with a toy doll's house. The question is this: inside the toy doll's house, is there another doll's house? Within that happy house, is there another house in which dreadful things take place, a toy house that holds tragedies too terrible to utter, and from which the only refuge is somewhere more secret still, a smaller house in a smaller nursery, a tiny haven in which all is well, Mummy and Daddy have their bedroom, the dog is in the kitchen sleeping, the children are happily inventing a game where, in an even tinier doll's house, among even more minuscule furniture, someone too small to be seen lets out a piercing, anguished, agonizing scream? Toys have shape, volume, color. Also voice. Toys bang, whir, whistle, clang, sing or talk. The sounds they make fill the world of the child with an oral presence. Not only the parents speak, not only the child's own voice cries or gurgles. The things that fill this world have voices also. One of the earliest toys is the rattle, a hollow ball or ring filled with pellets or seeds, that makes a sound when shaken by its handle. Rattles are very ancient toys. Aristotle, in the last book of his Politics, praises the rattle as "an excellent invention to keep children occupied; they cannot be expected to remain still, and playing with this toy keeps them from smashing things about the house. Of course," Aristotle adds sagely, "a rattle is only suitable for small children. For older ones, education is their rattle." Before audiovisual games and screens that respond out loud to the child's questions, there were music boxes and talking dolls, dogs that barked and clowns that giggled. Pull a cord, turn a key, and the toy comes to life with sounds that carry meaning. Dolls began by saying "Hello," "Will you play with me?" and "I love you." Later, toy soldiers too were given their voice: "Fight with me," "You're brave," "Attack!". Toys speak with conventional lines. There are no surprises here. Sometime in the 1980s, a group of feminist activists purchased a number of talking Barbie dolls and G.I. Joes from a well-known toy store, exchanged their sound boxes and returned them a few days later. Customers who then bought the doctored toys, found that when their children activated the doll's voices, G.I. Joe would whine in girlish tones, "I want to go shopping!" while Barbie growled fero ciously "Kill! Kill! Kill!" • SMALL COMPANIONS Landscapes with Mexican Dolls I Ruth D. Lechuga | Dolls take on many personalities for any girl who plays with them: a companion and confidante in all her joys, sorrows, achievements and desires; a servant who may be ordered to perform any number of tasks; a mother who may be disobeyed; a daughter who receives every manner of scolding but also the love that this daughter craves for herself—in short, a doll represents the entire universe that surrounds a young girl. Thus, it is transformed from a toy-object into a game wherein she plays an active role. Folk dolls are made from a variety of materials: in Celaya, Guanajuato, among other places, they are of papier-mâché, with movable arms and legs, painted in bright colors and inscribed with the first name of their owner. The size, body shape and hairstyle depend on the mold used, and some wear a hat and earrings. 76 f Doll wearing traditional costume, Tehuantepec, Oaxaca, 1973; Ruth D. Lechuga Collection / Museo Franz Mayer i Ruth D. Lechuga |</page><page sequence="13">Dolls from the city of Puebla also have movable limbs. The body is made of cloth filled with sawdust, while the face, hands and feet are wax. They are designed to be dressed by children in clothing that is sometimes made by their mothers but often by the children themselves. By creating the outfits they imagine for the doll, children also learn the art of sewing. Corn husks are used for making human figures in many cities, including Oaxaca, Xalapa, Uruapan and Mexico City. In Sayula, Jalisco, they are painted with flowers and covered in glazed paper; each of them carries a tiny crate. There are wooden dolls and clay dolls, but the most common material used is cloth. Cloth dolls exist throughout Mexico, from Tijuana to Comitán. They are made from fabric remnants of all kinds, and are usually stylized, giving free rein to the maker's imagination. They are virtually indestructible and are often a girl's prized possession: she can sleep with her doll, squeeze it, drag it on the ground, get it wet, and restitch it if it rips. All such handmade dolls are inexpensive and easily re placed. Dolls available in commercial establishments are costly and delicate. In the past, it was common to find imported porcelain dolls with pink skin and blue eyes, dressed in gauzy fabrics and lace. Some only had porcelain heads, hands and feet, while others were made entirely of this material, and still others were made of composition (sawdust, glue and other materials). They were very delicate and when they broke, they were sent to a specialized shop known as a Doll Hospital for re pair. Such pieces are now in great demand as collector's items. Some of the dolls available at toy stores now have moving eyelids, say "mama," cry and do other tricks. They are slender, with long torsos, blond hair and blue eyes. Their wardrobe consists of elegant haute-couture garments, subject to the changing winds of fashion. Most Mexican girls bear little physical resemblance to these dolls, so why present them with an ideal of beauty that is not their own? What do those outfits have to do with the life that most of these girls will lead? In fact, they are being shown a fictitious universe that is utterly removed from their reality, and this might lead to envy and a longing for a distant and unattainable world. Dolls made and used by indigenous groups reflect their own cultures and idiosyncrasies. The Seri Indians inhabit the coastal region of Sonora, and their main livelihood is fishing, so they move frequently from camp to camp. They carry their children on cradleboards formed by sticks bent into the shape of a racket, to which their babies are securely tied. Their dolls are made in a similar fashion. Other dolls are made of cloth: Seri women were still painting traditional designs on their faces in the 1970s and this custom was often represented on their dolls. A type of seaweed that is plentiful in Seri territory, sargassum, is also used to make toy human figures. Finally, there are some unusual dolls whose faces are made of a flat bone, with bodies covered in cloth. William McGee—who spent time with the Seris in 1985 and 1986—called them fetishes, remarking that they were used in burials, placed beside the deceased person's face. Today they are simply toys. San Juan de Chamula is a Tzotzil community in Los Altos de Chiapas. The custom there was to dress clay dolls in scraps of fabric woven on a backstrap loom, exactly reproducing local costume. Girls often crafted and dressed their own dolls and in this way learned how to do the work of their elders. The torso was sometimes formed from a corncob or a rolled corn husk rather than clay. Certain female figures were made entirely of corn husks; yarn stitching outlined the facial features and corn silk simulated hair. They were usually depicted carrying one or two "children" but could have as many as four. The use of corn and the number of children each doll carried may have had some association with fertility symbols. The Tzotzils also made all-cloth dolls dressed in local costume. All of these mod els were originally made for girls to play with, but necessity has turned them into goods to be sold to tourists as souvenirs. Beginning in 1994, effigies of the Zapatista leader Subcoman dante Marcos were also made and sold, featuring his black coat woven on a backstrap loom according to Chamula tradition, his cartridge belt and his gun. Among the Lacandon Indians of Najá, Chiapas, male and female dolls are made of clay with roughly formed hands and feet. Their heads resemble the heads of gods that appear on the rims of incense burners used in their worship. The dolls are dressed in fabric remnants: a huipil (tunic) and enredo (skirt) for women, and a long cotón (tunic) for men, as dictated by tradition. Until recently, Lacandon men would wear tunics made from the bark of the majahua or sea hibiscus tree (Hibiscus pernambucensis) when officiating prayers, and some dolls are dressed in the same fashion. Aguasuelos, Veracruz, is a Nahua community known for its ceramics, producing both pots and dolls. Some of the latter are dressed in fabric, while others feature long bell-shaped skirts also made of clay. The Aguilar sisters from Ocotlán, the Mixtee women of Jamiltepec, and the Zapotee women of Juchitán—all in Oaxaca—also create clay dolls with flared skirts. On the Isthmus ofTehuantepec, special dolls known as tangu-yu ("earth doll") are made for the New Year's celebration. In the Tancanhuitz region of San Luis Potosí, Huastec speaking women make clay dolls and dress them according to local custom. The dolls' arms are not attached to the body, but only to the sleeves of the dress, so they can move freely. They bear a close resemblance to pre-Hispanic Totonac figurines from central Veracruz, with movable arms (and sometimes legs) that are tied to the torso with string—the archaeologist Alfonso Medellin dubs them toys. Clay dolls with arms and legs attached in the same fashion were also discovered at Teotihuacan. Purepecha cloth dolls from Zirahuén, Micho acán, are dressed in traditional costume and are represented performing daily activities such as grinding corn and weaving on backstrap looms. They are attached to a board and have a string that lends them movement when pulled, lowering their torso and arms. Otomi people in several states make cloth dolls dressed in traditional costume. In Temoaya in the State of Mexico, dolls have a cloth ring stuffed with fabric scraps instead of a head, allowing children to freely imagine the character with whom they want to play at any given moment. The above examples speak of traditions and ways of life, and demonstrate the deep cultural roots and social aspects that underlie these playthings for children. Their creators show great imagination in the use of simple materials found in their own surroundings. There is another type of doll that might be called ethno graphic and that is a detailed reproduction of the traditional costume of different ethnic groups. These dolls are considered collector's items rather than toys. An example of these are the scale models of dancers from Huejotzingo, Puebla, and other places; Tehuana women with intricately embroidered gar ments that are sold at the Tehuantepec market; and the dolls produced in the San Cristóbal prison, which are dressed in the typical costumes of the communities of Los Altos de Chiapas. The work of Maria Esther Zuño de Echeverría, a folk art enthusiast and friend to many artisans, bears special mention. 77</page><page sequence="14">During her husband's term as president of Mexico, she sent dolls to every region of the country where traditional dress was still worn. Weavers, embroiderers and seamstresses in each community would then outfit the dolls in clothing that exactly reproduced the local custom. Zuno eventually amassed an extraordinary collection that evinces Mexico's rich tradi tion of ethnic costume and the unique ways in which different garments are worn, according to ancestral practices. This collection is a legacy for future generations as it faithfully documents indigenous costume during the 1970s. • Translated by Michelle Suderman. SMALL CREATIONS The Mazahua Doll: A Rainbow of Illusion I Laura Duranco | The ubiquitous Mazahua dolls that are stuffed with cotton wool and wear long black braids with bright ribbons are being celebrated in 2014 to mark their anniversary: fifty years of entertaining girls from all around the country and invig orating the tourist market. I had imagined that Mazahua dolls had existed at least since the nineteenth century, based on the flawed logic that a toy with a historical tradition must necessarily be linked to the atavism of ancestral cultures. With no access to trade or to dolls made of plastic, rubber or porcelain, indigenous ethnic groups in Mexico and elsewhere in the world have always made dolls by hand and at home. A doll is a child's plaything, but also a tool to transmit cultural signifiers, as mothers have long used them to teach their daughters about the things that identify their culture: distinctive forms of dress or hairstyle, embroidery patterns and typical colors. The daughters then begin making their own dolls, cutting and sewing clothing for them, and embroidering them with flowers that allude to the four cardinal directions, cobs of corn linked to fertility, rabbits as a symbol of good luck, birds as bearers of omens, and many other beautiful motifs, each with an underlying meaning and crafted with the invaluable ingredient oflove. After all, rag dolls pertain to the past, to times of scarcity which fuel desire, when pleasure was derived from small things. With the little they had, indigenous children in Mexico and other underprivileged children around the world would build their castles in the sky, a kind of magic that is today nonexistent for so many children who receive vast quantities of prefabricated toys as gifts, rather than making them with their own hands and heart. Half a Century As it turned out, my notions about Mazahua dolls were at least partly wrong: Guadalupe Rivera Marin corrected me, surprising me with the information that she was the original creator of the Mazahua doll, inspired by none other than the highly successful Barbie doll, so popular at the time. This is her story: "In 1964,1 was working for the Mexico City government, in the secretary-general's office, under Rodolfo González Guevara. Back then, Mazahua and Otomi women selling fruit and sweets on the city's streets usually wore traditional clothing, and people complained that it was an eyesore, as they were essentially seen as vagrants working on the street as vendors. Mazahua women wore bright, colorful clothing, but the Otomis looked more disheveled, and their black and white clothing was less attractive. "On arriving at the office one morning, I saw a govern ment policeman hitting one of the Mazahua vendors with a nightstick, seizing the fruit she was selling and trying to take her away in the police van. I asked him what was going on. He recognized me and explained that indigenous women had been warned they weren't allowed to sell their wares on the street. That made me realize I had to do something, it was my duty as a civil servant. I told Mr. González Guevara that it reflected very badly on the government that the police were unjustly beating these women. He asked me what we should do, so I got to work. "I had a team of assistants, all of them quite young, and we started investigating who these women were and why they were on the street. We discovered that there was an organizer in charge of them, Celia Torres, who has since passed away. She lent them the clothing they wore, gave them the merchan dise and charged them a commission on sales. Every day, the Mazahuas would make the trek from the State of Mexico, but the Otomi women lived on Belisario Domínguez Street, in an old abandoned row-house complex, in small shacks no more than five feet tall. The poverty and crowding were extreme. In general, the Mazahuas seemed to enjoy better living conditions. "So we went to San Felipe del Progreso, a town in the State of Mexico, to get a firsthand look at what conditions were like there. The poverty was also extreme, and the Mazahua women's husbands worked under horrible, hazardous condi tions. I spoke to the state governor, Carlos Hank, who sent a delegate who corroborated our report. "We needed to find a way to improve their quality of life with new sources of employment, so we decided the best thing would be to provide a center where the women would be able to manufacture their own merchandise and sell it on the street. We opted for crafts workshops. The government of the State of Mexico opened workshops for handwoven rugs and high-temperature ceramics. Here in Mexico City, we set up two centers, because even though the Mazahua and Otomi ethnic groups are both offshoots of the Oto-Pamean branch, they did not always get along. We rented a house near the plaza in Coyoacán for the Otomi women's workshop, and the Mazahua workshop was opened in some empty warehouses in La Merced, in Mexico City's historic center. "We taught them to read and write, and personal care habits, like washing their hands before sewing or embroider ing, to improve the quality of their lives and work. They began producing embroidered clothing and tablecloths for sale at a government store on Avenida Revolución, close to the corner of San Ángel. There were some fifty women in each workshop, and we noticed the change immediately. Making the most of the prevailing good spirits, one evening while chatting with my husband, it occurred to me that in order to increase their income, we could produce Barbie dolls, which were so popu lar at the time, only wearing typical Mexican costumes and with little straw suitcases for their clothing so children could change their dresses. "González Guevara liked the idea and I passed it along to the head of the Otomi workshop in Coyoacán. She presented a prototype for the doll, and we decided to dress it in the Maza hua costume, which was more eye-catching, to later replicate it at the La Merced workshop. So I know for a fact that the first 78 Laura Duranco |</page><page sequence="15">Mazahua doll, as it is known today, was born in Coyoacán in 1964, and made by Otomi hands. "At first they produced large dolls, around twenty inches tall, but there was little demand for them, so they started mak ing smaller ones, which sold much better. At the Mazahua workshop, they had the idea of putting ribbons in the doll's hair, but I don't know if they chose to do that for purely aes thetic reasons or as a reflection of their reality. "It was a gratifying experience for me, because the two ethnic groups, who received different training, were ultimate ly united by a single doll. Also, many of the Mazahua women asked to go to school and were able to complete secondary school, allowing them to get out of street vending. We man aged to create this source of work, and if we didn't publicize it at the time, that's because as civil servants, we had duties to fulfill, and negotiating patents wasn't one of them. Now I am telling you that I created the doll because I actually did: I came up with the idea, had it made, delegated the work and approved the prototype, which was later modified to improve sales at government stores." It seems ironic that the inventor of the doll that is today a symbol of Mexico never played with dolls as a girl. As Diego Rivera's daughter, she confesses that she was brought up like a boy—"my father would have preferred to have had sons"—so she grew up using roller skates, climbing trees, riding bicycles and wearing overalls. She and her sister Ruth had only one doll that Frida Kahlo brought them from New York in 1933: a beauti ful thing with a porcelain-like face, soft cloth body, a formal European-style dress, and its hair molded on the rubber head. The Doll's History Though the Mazahua doll was invented half a century ago, Mazahua and Otomi girls were playing with dolls long before that. A sixty-year-old Otomi painter named José Luis Romo told me that he remembers seeing the girls in his community playing with wooden or corncob dolls that they would dress in calico, the only fabric they were allowed to use. Three Otomi women from San Ildefonso, in the munici pality of Amealco, Querétaro—a community famous for its production of dolls—provided first-hand information about this. At the age of 104, Casimira Pigmenio González Albina re calls that the dolls she had as a girl were made of corncobs and sometimes sticks, and that she and her sisters dressed them in their own old clothes. She also mentions that one of her sisters embroidered a doll with a corncob center and placed it at the feet of the Virgin of Guadalupe in hopes that she would grant her a daughter, because she had only had sons until then. The priest was so taken by the gesture that the practice of offering embroidered dolls to the Virgin became a custom. Isabel Basilia Vásquez Hernández, eighty-one, believes that modern-day commercial dolls lack a soul, while the old ones were instilled with life because they were clothed "with love." She adds that in order to secure the protection of "our Holy Mother," the Otomi would replicate the embroidery patterns from their own clothing on the dolls. Gregoria Trejo Valdés, fifty, mentions that Mazahua women in the State of Mexico also present the Virgin Mary with embroidered dolls every December 12, the day of the Virgin of Guadalupe. María, Mariquita and Pastorcita The Otomi live mainly in Querétaro, while the Mazahua popu lation is concentrated in about ten municipalities in the State of Mexico. Amalia Martínez Delgado is a Mazahua artisan who resides in Toluca and is one of the best-known dollmakers in the region, specializing in the traditional doll known as Maria, with a clean face, few accessories and colorful clothing. She feels that this doll is the most representative of Mazahua re ality, given that the women "can't afford to buy shoes, much less wear makeup." She goes on to explain that the Mariquita doll, the only one with a patent, has a painted face, and the Pastorcita, or little shepherd girl, wears a straw hat. There are also dolls for special occasions, such as brides, and seasonal ones marking the Day of the Dead, for example. Martínez Delgado works on commission, manufactur ing no more than a hundred dolls per month. The prices vary according to each doll's size: 150, 250 or 400 pesos for dolls measuring seven, eleven or seventeen inches respectively. She has received commissions from cultural institutions such as the Folk Art Museum (Museo de Arte Popular) in Mexico City, from crafts fairs, and from government agencies (her dolls presented as gifts to visiting heads of state), as well as from stores. For bigger orders—the largest she recalls was for 8000 dolls—she turns to her network of contacts in the community. January and February are the slowest months for her, and she takes advantage of this time to mass-produce doll clothing and the cloth bodies stuffed with cotton wool—these are her most time-consuming tasks. She uses a sewing ma chine to join pieces and to pleat fabric, getting everything done except for the simpler steps: embroidering the face, braiding the yarn hair, adding the ribbons and dressing the doll. It is during this final stage that the dollmaker's mood is conveyed in the doll's face; as the Mexican saying goes, "everyone knows what baggage they're carrying." If she is feeling happy, the doll's face will reflect that joy; if it is sad ness that she feels, the doll's expression will be more serious or melancholy, with downcast eyes or less of a smile on her red lips. It is the stitching that determines such effects, and therein lies the beauty of individually conveyed feelings, because even though the technique remains the same, no two dolls are alike. ■* Maria Antonieta Tavarez Ramirez, Mazahua doll, Mexico City 79 ■* María Antonieta Tavarez Ramírez, Mazahua doll, Mexico City</page><page sequence="16">Lace, Petticoats and Embroidery A Fresh Start Mazahua dolls are characterized by their two long braids interwoven with brightly colored ribbons and joined at the ends. The preferred fabric for the clothing is the same that is worn by Mazahua women: a brightly colored acrylic-cotton blend, purchased by the yard. The high-collared blouse has a pleated front, with white lace or embroidery at the yoke, cuffs and hem. The skirt is formed of three layers: an inner calico petticoat with a white lace or embroidered hem and pleating at the front to add volume; a second layer of white jacquard, also pleated, with embroidery or white lace in the center; and a third, which is a pleated jacquard pinafore, shorter and more brilliantly colored than the others, showing the embroidered orlacehemof the first petticoat, and with a wide lace section two thirds of the way up. The result is an eye-catching doll with spectacularly voluminous skirts. Embroidery is always done by hand and may substitute lace. Martínez Delgado mentions that the principal embroi dery techniques are couching and jersey stitch, leaving no blank spaces and using the traditional colors of red, black, maroon and pink. The motifs often include animal figures— rabbits, pigeons and other birds, deer, horses, donkeys, ducks, and so forth—to convey the close connection that indigenous people have with nature. The designs relate stories and myths such as the legend of fire, the coyote magician, the meaning ofbirdsong or a dog's howls, injecting poetry into every stitch. Vests, rugs, blankets, tablecloths, blouses and bags feature the famous four-pointed Mazahua star. Amalia Martínez Delgado has been making dolls since the age of six. Her mother taught her to make dolls and she learned embroidery from her aunt. By the age of ten, she was already selling her dolls at the stores run by Fonart (National Fund for the Promotion of Crafts). At first she did everything by hand, but she eventually learned to use a sewing machine and is now thinking of buying a fabric cutter to save time. Looking back, she recalls that when she was a child, girls would own a single doll like the ones she makes. But, using their imagination, they were able to make others out of the chicalote plant (Argemone munita, or prickly poppy), whose stem was the body and whose white flower, turned upside down, formed a delicate bubble skirt. Their main form of entertain ment in those days was going down to the river to play with the clayey mud, making pots, dishes, mortars and grinding stones for their dolls. Boys would use the same material to form bulls, horses and pellets for their slingshots, thus establishing the usual gender division. ► Mazahua doll, Mexico City ►•►•Genoveva Pérez Pascual, doll representing the dance of the pastora, Amealco, Querétaro; collection of Angélica Tijerina, La Esquina Museo del Juguete Popular Mexicano For decades, indigenous dolls were only made for personal use. Their shape has changed over time, featuring a wider range of models in the interest of commercialization. However, because they are not made in large numbers, the dolls remain in high demand. The matter of patents is at an impasse: the IFAEM (Institute of Research and Development of Crafts in the State of Mexico) is not certain that it is worth the effort to try to register a product that may or may not be unique. Each variant would need a patent of its own, generating fees that would have to be paid periodically, and what works in a given location or for a given model may not work elsewhere. However, Mazahua women do welcome the courses offered by the State of Mexico's Ministry of Tourism, designed to teach them the organizational skills they require as artisans and businesswomen. Though their earnings are low—given that the dolls do not sell quickly—these courses have aided in their personal development, giving them an awareness of work pos sibilities outside of the home. As Amalia Delgado Hernández points out, these dolls may only appeal to individuals with some understanding of art and culture, but their promotion is essential as it contributes to the survival of this ethnic group. The Otomi doll—with stitched eyes and a line for a nose, garbed in a white blouse and a chincuete (black skirt)—has evolved in tandem with the Mazahua doll, like two facets of a single reality. We know that the first Mazahua doll was made in an Otomi workshop in Coyoacán, but the tiara of colored ribbons that is so characteristic of the Otomi collec tive imaginary was in fact a Mazahua invention, product of a creative license that started a trend. In fact, Mazahua and Otomi dolls are quite similar, and their design has evolved over time to become more modern. Though the need to cre ate dolls is an ancient one, responding to a spiritual drive to express women's maternal and sexual identity, the interpretive context relies on cultural transpositions that merge traditions and incorporate new ideas. Some believe it is wrong to stray from tradition, to let it evolve, as it leads to identities that they deem "confusing or deviant." However, many indigenous and non-indigenous creators defend such revitalizing tendencies as legitimate elements that are beneficial both creatively and economically. Seven years ago, the graphic designers Paola Tovar, Verónica Garduño and Mireya Serrano founded Maria's I.N.C., a brand based on the Mazahua doll. Their shop in the Condesa neighborhood of Mexico City presents four contemporary variations on the doll: the classic Maria, Marky the goth, Em mary the emo, and Mariux the rocker. Though there is higher demand for the classic version, the urban tribe variants of the dolls, which reveal a radical shift in the original concept, have piqued the interest of alternative youth culture in recent years. These contemporary versions complement the tradition, blending craft and design, blurring divisions of taste and reinventing the past so it may have a future. Many Mexicans still carry the memory of the song by the children's poet and songwriter Francisco Gabilondo Soler, best known as Cri-Cri, entitled La muñeca fea (The Ugly Doll). Gua dalupe Rivera Marin, who never played with dolls, confesses that she cried bitterly about this song as a girl, and that it still tugs at her heartstrings. Like the doll in the song, Rivera Marin believed she was plain, and unloved because of that fact. In a sense, the ugly doll became her alter ego and her consolation. • Translated by Michelle Suderman. 80 Mazahua doll, Mexico City ► ► Genoveva Pérez Pascual, doll representing the dance of the pastora, Amealco, Querétaro; collection of Angélica Tijerina, La Esquina Museo del Juguete Popular Mexicano</page></plain_text>
