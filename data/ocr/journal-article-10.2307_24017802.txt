Introduction Boccaccio scholars often seek to determine the structural position of Day Six in the Decameron. The place we might assign to the sixth and shortest Day in the Decameron depends on how we divide the book. If we count ten distinct days of storytelling, the sixth lies at the beginning of the second half and starts off at the very center of the book. If we take the hundred novellas, the first tale of Day Six, being the fifty-first, similarly emerges from the middle. If, however, we take the author's introduction to Day IV as a clue and think of the Decameron as being divided in thirds, ' the Day 6 would move us towards the end of the second third and then might be considered as a counterpart to Day 4, i.e., with the author's plea for the rightfulness of his enduring love of women and, moreover, his purpose to distract ladies from their melancholy. Finally, if we let ourselves be led by the fourteen actual days the brigata spends together, Day 6, like Day 1, falls on a Wednesday and, consequently, opens a second cycle. However we divide the Decameron, the Sixth Day is certainly placed in, at or around its center. Here both the collection of stories and the evolution of the novella portante seem to reach a pivotal point. From a thematic point of view it is the Sixth Day in which the reader enters the realms dedicated to human industriousness, to the ingegno. Whereas the tales of the previous days deal with the impact capricious fortuna has on human life, especially on love, from Day Six on the stories focus on amazing performances of human ingenuity, which to a large extent showcase acumen and, to a lesser, the capacity to live up to the standard of courteous virtues. Although the characters of the tales are still under the sway of the god Amor and goddess Fortuna, from now on the novellas are eager to celebrate the human mind, managing to bring difficult and even despairingly perilous situations under control. 1 That the Decameron might be considered in thirds can be inferred from a sentence in the Introduction to Day Four: "[...] non essendo io ancora al terzo della mia fatica venuto" (Dee. 4. Intro. 10). The concept of thirds may have had practical reasons. After circulating the first three days, Boccaccio might have thought of adding two other thirds. As a result, the tenth day would turn out somewhat separated from the previous nine days. Annali d'Italianistica 31 (2013). Boccaccio's Decameron. Re-writìng the Christian Middle Ages</page><page sequence="3">290 Franziska Meier It does not come as a surprise that Boccaccio makes his brigata turn to praising human industriousness on the sixth day of storytelling, i.e., on the very day, according to the first chapter of Genesis, when the beasts of the earth and man were created and when all living creatures were put under the dominion of men. Nor does it surprise us that Day Six intends to highlight the astounding power of words given that, in accordance with a long tradition, Dante, in De Vulgari Eloquentia, defined language as being a distinctive peculiarity of humanity.2 In this aspect Day Six seems to be very close to the so-called Novellino which is particularly interested in reporting examples of "fiori del parlare" to a probably communal audience.3 Thus we get the sense that Boccaccio, in the Sixth Day, resumes the medieval celebration of language as the highest manifestation of human social intercourse. 2. Introduction to Day Six and Its "cornice" After a day dedicated to the happy endings of love stories meant to balance the tragic endings of the previous day, Fiammetta passes the crown on to Elissa, the rather melancholic member of the brigata. As usual the members of the kingdom start by determining the topic. This queen, however, proceeds in a slightly, nevertheless significantly, different way because she deduces the topic from what she calls a recurrent feature in the fifty novellas already told. Her proposal can be read as an attempt to step out of their current practice of storytelling and, instead, to assume a reflective attitude towards what they have been doing. From the beginning, Elissa's kingdom is distinguished by the desire to glimpse one of the formal peculiarities of storytelling: the "bei motti," "pronte risposte" and "avvedimenti presti" {Dec. 5. Conci. 3). The brigata swiftly adopts the auto-reflective attitude. The walk they take in the mornings seems to be exclusively filled with conversations about the novellas already heard: "della più bellezza e della meno delle raccontate novelle disputando e ancora de' varii casi recitati in quelle rinnovando le risa" {Dee. 6. Intro. 2). Although we do not know anything about their criteria of beauty, the chat obviously focuses on the novellas' form and discusses the stories from a kind of esthetic point of view. Furthermore, the brigata revisits the tales' content and, by doing so, falls back into laughter ("rinnovando le risa" 6. Intro. 2), into their modes of pleasant enjoyment. Even retold in such an allusive way, the plots — probably cut down to their nuts and bolts — do not lose anything of their hilarious effect. Selecting the term "casi," Boccaccio may have wanted to 2 See De Vulgari Eìoquentia 1.2.1: "[...] nam eorum que sunt omnium soli homini datum est loqui, cum solum sibi necessarium fuerit." 3 See the rubric of the Novellino: "Questo libro tratta d'alquanti fiori di parlare, di belle cortesie e di be' risposi e di belle valentie e doni, secondo che per lo tempo passato hanno fatti molti valenti uomini" (41).</page><page sequence="4">Dec. 6: Language's Polysemy or the Importance of Being Understood 291 foreground the basic material on which all the narrators have been and will be drawing before converting it into the more complicated form of "novella." Elissa is not just interested in the beauty of witty phraseology, but much more in its function as an efficient defense. Contrary to ancient collections of "motti" or of Witze, which are common in Roman books on rhetoric and still present in Macrobius's Saturnalia, she does not invite her fellows to indulge in cracking Witze for their own sake or in remembrance of a legendary figure such as Cicero or Augustus — ancients who knew how to crack a joke. She wishes the successful wordings to be placed in social intercourse, in a dialogue or a power struggle. What intrigues her is the power a certain speech gains in these three sorts of threatening situations.4 And this is where her outline of the topic joins those of her predecessors: In a literal sense the queen asks her subjects to give examples of speech that manage to act — and, here, the stress lies on "act." Whereas Neifile presents her topic as being probably useful or at least enjoyable ("alla brigata esser possa utile o almeno dilettevole" Dec. 2. Conci. 9), Elissa calls hers "bella" and adds somewhat vaguely: "e può essere utile." It is hard to tell if "bella" should stress the formal and, implicitly, auto-reflective kind of approach again or if the adjective rather points out the longed-for amusement. In any case, the queen is hesitant about whether the traditional Horatian request of "teaching" and "amusing" applies to her own day. If we follow Robert Hollander, Boccaccio's reference to the Horatian formula is by and large rather superficial and mostly ambiguous.5 Although in some cases the usefulness of a single story or even a whole day is stressed, it remains uncertain what kind of use the storytellers or the author have in mind. Nevertheless, Elissa's way of alluding to a possible use is striking. Does the usefulness depend on the listener's intervention? Or should we better understand Elissa's hesitation as a kind of subtle self-distancing from the Novellino''s joyful self-certainty about the usefulness of language?6 In the Novellino a sophisticated use of language is considered to be highly memorable and especially important for an audience whose middle-class members are proud of having a "cuore nobile e intelligenzia sottile" {Novellino 42), i.e., of having all the requirements needed to rise to the highest level of society. By drawing the audience's attention to the efficiency and delightful refinement of language, the Novellino is committed to the project of civilizing human intercourse and to the ascending cities' urge for ennoblement. Boccaccio's Day Six, on the contrary, does not pretend to teach or civilize its 4 See her outline of the topic: "[...] chi, con alcun leggiadro motto tentato, si riscotesse, o con pronta risposta o avvedimento fuggì perdita o pericolo o scorno" (Dee. 5. Conci. 3). 5 As to the occurrence of "utile" and its respective meanings that cannot be fixed to moral fruition in Boccaccio's Decameron see Hollander's essay on "Utilità" (Boccaccio's Dante 69-88). 6 According to Cuomo, the Novellino may provide "una specifica chiave di lettura unitaria" to the composition of Day Six (218).</page><page sequence="5">292 Franziska Meier readers. Despite several reminiscences of courteousness, Elissa, from the beginning, makes it clear that the "motto" serves as a weapon and that its tit for tat nature is very similar to the biting of animals, especially dogs.7 The wording is less a symptom of a refined social intercourse than of another form of strong and aggressive fighting.8 Unlike the Novellino, Boccaccio keeps the human "motteggiare" close to the world of brutes.9 Two other storytellers take advantage of their turn to extend and complement the queen's topic. Thanks to their intervention the aspects of refinement and rhetoric make an appearance.10 The first narrator, Filomena, opens with a long digression on the "leggiadri motti." Conventionally she describes them as an ornament which is to refined human behavior and speaking what real flowers are to lawns, or stars are to the sky. (Dec 6.1.2) Then she narrows the responding "motto" to a specifically female art: women, she claims, being physically weaker than men, can only defend themselves by speech, and she recommends the form of "motto" also for another reason: her sex tends to talk too much. In doing so, Filomena resumes the Novellino's point of view but she eliminates its specific aristocratic background. Then she falls into a general moan about the on-going and apparently definitive decay of the art of "motti" among women (6. 1 3). The tales about skillful female speakers — most of them victims of the plague — are placed under the sign of a hopeless nostalgia. As for the rhetorical aspect of "motto," it crops up in a rather allusive manner. Filomena only briefly mentions the conditions of a successful "motto," which, according to her, depends on understanding as well as on perfect timing. She prefers to send her audience back to Pampinea's long digression in the tenth story of the First Day from which she has already been quoting (1.10.2-8). Pampinea, though, had recommended a careful pondering of the opponent's character and specific situation before venturing out in an exchange of harsh 7 The term "morso" occurs quite often in the Decameron, both in the novellas and the novella portante." The author himself uses it in his self-defense at the beginning of Day Four when he refers to the "morsi della 'nvidia" (4. Intro 4,) to the "così atroci denti, [...] così aguti" (8) from which he is suffering after allowing the manuscript of the first three Days to be circulated. The introduction is meant to be a "leggiera risposta" (9) to the multifaceted array of offenses and criticism. 8 As Elissa says, the goal of the "motti" is to "rintuzzare gli altrui denti" (5. Conci. 3). This is of course a semantic field that pervades the Decameron, but that is particularly intense in Day Six. It is significant too that the Day starts with a horse tale. 9 Mineo also emphasizes the "funzione aggressiva" without being aware of its linking man to beasts (53-54). 10 It might be significant that in the introduction to Day Six the brigata while walking does not acknowledge any flowers. Flowers are only mentioned as part of the beautiful table decoration. It is tempting to think of these cut flowers as a symbol of the "motti," namely, of the rhetorical flowers which although rooted in nature stand out as an artificial achievement.</page><page sequence="6">Dec. 6: Language's Polysemy or the Importance of Being Understood 293 words. For her the "motto" is placed in the very complicated, highly contingent process of human communication. It is Lauretta, the third narrator, who comes closer to rhetoric when she requires the reaction to a "motto" to be appropriate (6.3.5). If the offense is harsh and humiliating, the reaction may be aggressive too. The "biting back" is a question of appropriateness, of aptum. When it comes to Pampinea's turn, she resumes the warning of her first novella's, but gives it a twist. Again she draws attention to the characters involved. But whereas in Day One she questioned the proverbial assumption that an aging lover is by definition ridiculous, in Day Six she insists on the difficulty of assessing a person from his exterior. In other words she stresses the rather confusing relationship between the exterior — the low social rank — and the interior — the actual nobility. Other narrators, inspired by her, showcase the extent to which an ugly exterior may hide a noble heart or ingegno, or a pretty body cover utter stupidity. To sum up: Day Six, although heavily interwoven with the Novellino, is heading in another direction. The tales do not teach, but commemorate.11 The human art of phraseology keeps its roots in a habitus typical of animals and ceases to be a mark exclusive to a high social group and, what is more, the mastery of language turns out to be rather fortuitous.12 Certainly, the Decameron continues to praise the efficient use of language as a sign of nobility; the skill, however, can be found in wildly differing places. Therefore, the "motto" as a feature of social intercourse is subject to the same contingency which, in the Decameron, dominates all aspects of the human world and life. Since it is conditioned by so many factors which are beyond the speaker's control, a successful verbal exchange can be recounted and may create delight, but cannot serve as an enduring example to learn from or to resuscitate a lost art. In Day Six the celebration of human industriousness is closely intertwined with the fundamental inscrutability of human life. 3. Elissa's Reign: A Deeply Troubled Harmony With Elissa's coronation a lovely consensual harmony seems to come about. Unlike her predecessor Fiammetta, she does not have to counterbalance the sadness of the previous kingdom, and contrary to her successor Dioneo, her topic meets with the company's cheerful approval. This first impression of consensual harmony is confirmed by the opening paragraphs of Day Six. When the moon gives way to the sun, Boccaccio describes the sunrise as a "nuova 11 Mineo has pointed out that, except for Novellas 2 and 9, the tales are set in the 20s and 30s of the 14th century (64). 12 See Pampinea's introduction to her novella: "E così le due ministre del mondo spesso le lor cose più care nascondono sotto l'ombra dell'arti reputate più vili, acciò che di quelle alle necessità traendole più chiaro appaia il loro splendore" (6.2.6). See also 6.5.3 as to the exterior ugliness which covers Giotto's ingegno or 6.4.3 where it is Fortuna who puts a "motto" into the mouth of an idiot.</page><page sequence="7">294 Franziska Meier luce" coming up, as if a renewal were about to take place. Furthermore, the brigata's ritualized activities seem to proceed almost by themselves. Is it the natural heat which renders the queen's command to walk back superfluous? Anyhow, the queen confines her ruling to the coordination of the activities and their scheduling. After a week of practicing, the order that the Florentine ladies had longed for has been successfully installed. Consequently, it comes as something of a surprise that Elissa's reign is profoundly disturbed — and twice. The first of the disturbances occurs at the end of Day Five after Elissa has asked Dioneo to sing a ballata. Whereas his predecessors immediately carried out the demand, Dioneo humorously suggests two songs, both of which are rejected by the queen. Through the incipits of the songs, he seems to make Elissa's endeavor his own, to reflect what they are doing, applying it to the evening, namely, to the lyrical part of their days' schedule. He is the first to admit that he had not invented the song, but shows that he has a huge archive of popular songs at his disposal all of which, according to Branca, were commonly sung at celebrations or parties, and that there were two modes of performing ballades: they could be sung with or without an accompanying instrument {Dec. 5. Conci. 7nl).14 The more he indulges in quoting titles for their own sake, the more he falls back on a provocative stance.15 It is obvious that he wants to make the "onesta brigata" squarely face up to women's exuberant sexual desire and their strong urge to be satisfied — one of Dioneo's hobbyhorses and one of the recurrent and troubling arguments threatening the balance of the group. And the more he goes on evoking the frivolous world, the more the brigata is split. Whereas most of them continue enjoying the implied frivolity, the queen, after having laughed "massimamente" {Dec. 5. Conci. 8), tells Dioneo to stop "il motteggiare" (14). She is getting more and more concerned that his allusions may all too soon descend into disorder and question her authority.16 It is only after she explicitly threatens Dioneo with her growing rage that order is restored.17 Dioneo quickly 13 Bàrberi Squarotti has uncovered the Dantean quotations in this passage; for instance, the "pleniluni sereni" refer to the Paradiso 23.25-27. According to him they serve to enhance the impression of harmony ("Madonna Oretta e il cavallo" esp. 616-17). 14 Since Dioneo immediately discards some of the songs as they require an instrument, it seems as if the brigata had settled on singing a capella, which is not always the case. At the end of the First Day Dioneo's lute accompanying the first ballata is mentioned (Dec. 1. Conci. 16). 15 He already abused his decreed liberty in the last tale of the Fifth Day. 16 The queen is said to be "allora un poco turbata" (Dec. 5. Conci. 14). According to Bruni, the passage is a "segno che ancora nel Decameron è ben operante la distinzione tra i 'fabulosi parlari degli ignoranti' in una loro particolare accezione, alquanto sboccata, e le storie gentili della Dama del vergili o del Filostrato o del Teseìda o dei romanzi del genere" (93). 17 See her rhyming, "tu potresti provare come io mi so adirare" (5. Conci. 14). Interestingly she does not look for a "motto" to silence Dioneo.</page><page sequence="8">Dec. 6: Language's Polysemy or the Importance of Being Understood 295 obeys and sings a ballata in the sublime language of the Dolce Stil Nuovo, which is evidently intended to have his mischief pardoned. Its softness, however, does not seem to have calmed the group. This impression is to be inferred from the Fifth Day's ending without dancing and music and by the fact that the queen asked other songs to be said and, therefore, not sung ("fece la reina assai dell'altre dire" 5. Conci. 10). Was she afraid of the eroding repercussions music might have on her pleasure-seeking subjects? The second disturbance arises at the very moment in which Elissa commands her company to sit down for the storytelling. A noise breaks out in the servants' room18 and disrupts the reassuring routine of the morning activities. Instead of listening to the first tale, the brigata finds itself holding court over the burlesque quarrel between Licisca and Tindaro. On the Sixth Day the novella portante yields to the pressure of the servants whose task it was to prepare and to render their masters' pleasant life as silently as possible. As to the servants' quarrel it is not very far away from an issue the brigata continues to be concerned with. Contrary to Day Five in which the female protagonist is frequently represented as an object of the often violent desire of man and, along with her lover, is disposed of by paternalistic characters, Licisca emphasizes female self-determination and autonomy. She derides Tindaro for being a "bestia d'uom" (Dec. 6. Intro. 7), since he trusts that girls wait for their wedding night to lose their virginity and then experience sexuality as an act of bloody intrusion. In her view young women are not under men's control and in fact know how to live out their sexuality to the full. In a way she blatantly enunciates what Dioneo 's nine obscene song titles only alluded to. Thus the end of Day Five and the beginning of Day Six, as far as the novella portante is concerned, share a brief descent into the burlesque style and into the abyss of sexuality — the very source of pleasure and at the same time a disruptive force. Again the brigata responds with laughter to Licisca's lurid speech and thereby announces its somewhat tempered consent. Their longing for fun makes them yield to the undermining drift towards equalization and democracy which Pampinea, on behalf of the group, had tried to curtail.19 This time they even laugh out loud so intensely that all their teeth are uncovered and could have been pulled out (Dec. 6.11) — which might be taken as a symptom of a joy on the brink of vulgarity. And once again it is the queen who alone is concerned about 18 It reminds the reader of the noise announcing the surreal interruption at Nastagio's dinner {Dec. 5.8.37). 19 See the rules Pampinea establishes in Dec. 1. Intro. 95-96. Interestingly, neither Filomena nor Filostrato, the servants' respective mistress and master, takes charge of the embarrassing intrusion. They leave everything to the queen Elissa. Dioneo's condition set in Day One — that the crowned ruler alone takes responsibility for the group whereas the others are free to seek pleasure (1. Intro. 93) — seems to be adopted by the others. In Novellas 2 and 10, however, the reader comes across masters who acknowledge their servants' faults.</page><page sequence="9">296 Franziska Meier her authority and the self-imposed order. Only at her sixth request do her subjects comply (6.11). After such strong resistance, it is all the more surprising that Elissa assigns the duty of passing judgment to the outspoken opponent of order and the supporter of Licisca's point of view: Dioneo. Did she not feel up to the task, and, if so, why? Or did she want to take revenge for his previous ribbing by pushing him into the role of a judge?20 Dioneo, in any case, is smarter. Without listening to Tindaro he immediately endorses Licisca's opinion (6.15) and returns the ball to the queen, who indeed hurries to silence the servant's loquacity by reminding Licisca of her duty and stressing her place in the hierarchically separated world of the brigata. By doing so, she calls her subjects to order21 (6.15). Scholars have not paid much attention to Tindaro. Both servants' names have been qualified as typical to Roman comedies (Dec. 1. Intro. 98n3). A Tyndarus, indeed, occurs in Plautus's Captivi and in Terence's Eunuchus, both based on the same plot. The namesake, however, is not a servant by birth; he only slips into a servant's role. Was Boccaccio's choice then stimulated by other considerations? A namesake that comes into mind is the mythical Tyndarus, Leda's cuckolded husband and would-be father of the beautiful Helen who pushed the Greeks into the Trojan War. Significantly, the two servants are assigned to Filostrato and Filomena, i.e., to the respective names of the writer and the addressee of the Filostrato, which tells the love story of Troilo and Criseida against the backdrop of the Trojan War and was sung by Dioneo and Lauretta after lunch (Dec. 6. Intro. 3). It cannot be proved that Boccaccio intended to link the servant's totally passive behavior with Troilo, who neither stops loving his unfaithful Criseida nor leaves off singing her praises. However, the author evidently works to counterbalance the triumph of Licisca's speech in the midst of the noble brigata. The mute man who believes in women's sublimity and purity is the only servant who is asked by the king Dioneo to take part in the noble amusements.22 Twice he delights the masters with the soft melodic sounds of his shawm, a pastoral instrument apt for expressing his otherwise awkward ideals. Whereas the company clearly sides with Licisca, Boccaccio may well have wanted to hide a clue in the enigmatic Tindaro to 20 Cfr. Ascoli's reading: "Her motive [...] seems to have been to force Dioneo into a position where he would be obliged to uphold normative authorities and standards of decency, and thus to bring him within the explicit and implicit framework of power that they all adhere to" (A Local Habitation 109). 21 This conclusion contrasts with Ascoli's and Mazzotta's position according to which "Dioneo 's judgment in favor of the voice of disorder does effectively restore order [...], and the group continues with its storytelling in the ordinary way for the rest of the day"(Ascoli, "Pyrrhus' Rules" 109). 22 Contrary to Branca's annotation, Tindaro is not asked only once to play his pastoral instrument. At the end of Days Six and Seven he takes part "in queste azioni aristocratiche" (Dec. 6 Concl. 8n3).</page><page sequence="10">Dec. 6: Language's Polysemy or the Importance of Being Understood 297 remind us of a world of poetry and musical beauty which is part of the Decameron, too. 4. Day Six's Novellas vis-à-vis the Novellas of Day Five and Day Seven The stories of the Day dedicated to "leggiadri motti" and to a specific art of phraseology are set in and around Florence except for novellas 7 and 10, which take place in the nearby cities of Prato and Certaldo, respectively. In contrast to the Fifth Day whose tales sweep across the Mediterranean Sea, Day Six cuts the locales down to an area to which the members of the brigata also belong. Day Seven will again enlarge the radius, but not to the extent Day Five did; it centers on Tuscany and its surroundings. Accordingly, Day Six features exclusively Florentine voices. The exception that proves the rule is the second tale's protagonist, the cook Chichibio, who comes from Veneto but does not invent his "motto" all by himself. It is Fortuna, of course, who puts the "motto" in his mouth (Dec. 6.4.3). Whereas the Novellino declares the specific art of speaking as being particular to the nobility and the courts in Western Europe, the Sixth Day in the Decameron highlights Tuscan speakers as the best performers of an art that has spread all over the world. While it may find its most elaborate expression among Florentine nobles, fine speech is by no means limited to them. Rather, it is a regional peculiarity occurring in all classes.23 Flence, right at the center of his book Boccaccio sets a background of esteem for his city Florence which, as far as linguistic tussles are concerned, turns out to be the hub of the world — a self-appreciation which is ironically mirrored in the recurring idiomatic expression "non che in Firenze, ma nel mondo o in Maremma" 24 (6. 6. 6 and 16), and, of course, in Frate Cipolla's imaginary walk through Florence, which is capable of replacing a long trip to the Orient.25 Scholars of Day Six have been eager to explore its closeness to Day One. According to Cok van der Voort, its topic is, in retrospect, passed on from the First Day whose stories, initially, had been a free choice.26 This assumption is usually strengthened by Filomena's already mentioned reference to Pampinea's tenth novella in Day One and by some striking analogies between Ser Cepparello, the deceiver-villain who is taken for a saint, and Frate Cipolla who 23 The concentration on Florentine speakers is highlighted by Fido (84). Anzani explains it as the emergence of a new society in Florence (28). Bruni observes that "non c'è dubbio che la battuta spiritosa" is "già colta da Salimbene de Adamo come una caratteristica naturale dei Fiorentini" (242). 24 Bruni took the idiom as a sample of Boccaccio's linguistic playing with inversions (388). 25 Frate Cipolla parodically precedes Petrarch's decision to read books instead of going on a pilgrimage which he explains in his Itinerarium of 1358. 26 Van der Voort disagrees with Edoardo Sanguineti's assumption that every Day sticks to a different "modello narrativo" (208).</page><page sequence="11">298 Franziska Meier knows how to equivocate (223).27 Both demonstrate their mastery in applying linguistic patterns in the service of questionable ends. The tales may play the role of a go-between vis-à-vis the previous and the following day. They draw the attention away from the action and event-driven plots of the previous days, and direct it towards human ingenuity's most sophisticated characteristic: language. The tales may have also been meant to take the readers out of the continuing unfolding of characters and circumstances, providing them with a moment's pause. The Sixth Day's reflective attitude eventually gives way to a series of topics which again allow for action-rich plots, but will be placed under the heading of "beffe" and will celebrate the human capability of taking control of life's vicissitudes. In Day Seven, the tales' characters continue to be largely responsible for what happens to them and to others; language, however, turns into a minor tool. Finally, since Fortuna no longer prevails over the characters in Day Six, the conflicts are generally caused and solved by human agency. Of course, ingenuity does help in Day Five too, yet it falls short of being a crucial factor in the chain of events.28 Day Six's female characters differ from those of Day Five, where most do not participate very actively in their fate. They are represented as mere objects that men long for and settle upon. Women suffer men's sometimes violent desire, whether they like it or not, and accept the plight as well as the happy outcome which may derive from it. The Seventh Day, in turn, is a sequel to Day Six's female protagonists insofar as its tales explicitly stage women's cleverness, and, as in the "novella portante," the female narrators implicitly try to turn Dioneo's highly offensive topic against him. Although, after a somewhat heated argument, they comply with his wish to tell "beffe" which are supposed to showcase uncontrollable female lust and its marvelous resourcefulness, the tales the ladies pick go against Dioneo's intention. They are pushing to represent the "beffa" as an act of legitimate self-defense, as the just punishment of a husband who has neglected his wife or has been unbearably jealous. By giving this slightly, but significantly different twist to Dioneo's topic, the ladies both obey and elude their king's demand. 5. The Tales of Day Six and Their Common Denominator Although the grammarian's approach to the Decameron implemented by Tzvetan Todorov's pioneering Grammaire du Décaméron of 1969 has lost something of its magic, scholars' desire to reduce the ten tales of each Day to an overall theme or structure is still unabated. Day Six is certainly no exception. Over the last decades, three proposals for an overarching structure have been put 27 The parallel has become a truism in Boccaccio scholarship; see, for instance. Pastore Stocchi (205). 28 At the stories' critical climax Fortuna makes an elderly third person come by to enable the happy ending of the lovers as is the case in Novellas 2, 3 or 6.</page><page sequence="12">Dec. 6: Language's Polysemy or the Importance of Being Understood 299 forward, each of which may equally apply to the Decameron in general: the power of women29, the power of language, and the unfolding of a narratological message.30 These three proposals are closely interwoven and emphasize the tales' propinquity to linguistic and even aesthetic reflections. From the perspective of Francesco Bruni's notion of "letteratura mezzana," their being strongly interrelated does not come as a surprise since the interest in language, in the volgare, the concern with narrative writing and the choice of women as the primary addressees are typical in this strand of Boccaccio's prose and its underlying poetics.31 I do not doubt these assertions. However, as far as Day Six is concerned, it is in my view advisable to take a closer look at the tales and to carefully consider the extent to which the three proposals apply. The claim that Day Six celebrates women's power is primarily based on Filomena's and Pampinea's definition of "motti" as a specifically female way of speaking and, beyond that, on the ladies' lonely walk and sojourn in the "Valle delle donne" (Mineo 67-68). And in both passages the claim is upheld. What puzzles me are the Day's tales that, instead of celebrating great female speakers, feature witty women in only three: the first tale about the noble Madonna Oretta who knows how to make her knight courteously understand that his telling of a story is a mess; the third dealing with a middle-class wife Nonna Pulci, who aggressively returns a bishop's offensive remark; and the seventh in which the noble Pratese madonna Filippa impresses her audiences by her smart self defense. All the other novellas focus on teasing among males with the exception of the eighth, which, although staging a pretty girl, makes the women's cause worse. Here the decay of witty phraseology reaches its nadir. As a result, the day may start off with the purpose of celebrating examples of successful female speech, but, when it comes down to it, skillful male speakers are privileged. Indeed, it operates to the degree that the gender demographic of the brigata is turned upside down: what the three male Florentines are to the seven ladies, the three novellas featuring a strong she-speaker are to the seven showcasing men's verbal mastery. Ironically, the very day which intends to lift women out of their passivity lingers on depicting men as not only the most intriguing performers of speech acts but also as their best receivers. According to Picone and Bàrberi Squarotti, the novellas of Day Six illustrate the triumphant and liberating power of language.32 If as a benchmark 29 See in particular Mineo's analysis of the Day with the telling subtitle "il potere delle donne." Later he explains: "Il dominio del femminile si manifesta come centralità del narrare e potere della parola in quanto forza creatrice" (66). 30 I refer to the fifth chapter on "L'ars narrandi di Boccaccio nella sesta giornata" in Fido, Il Regime 73-90. 31 According to Bruni, Boccaccio's concept of a "letteratura mezzana" continues Dante's Vita nova where the volgare is firmly linked to women as the addressees (35-36). 32 Bàrberi Squarotti reads the Decameron in toto as a demonstration of the power of language. He understands Dioneo's tale in Day Six as a straightforward conflict between</page><page sequence="13">300 Franziska Meier we take the ninth novella of Day One, where the outraged widow's malicious questioning triggers a profound inner change in the king of Cyprus,33 the Sixth Day inevitably lets us down. In most of its tales the impact of the "motto" does not extend far beyond providing a more or less elegant way to escape an unpleasant, if not threatening, situation, or to bounce off or repel some kind of offense. Madonna Oretta may manage to stop his messed-up story, but this does not bring about any inner change in the knight. Neither do the much harsher rebukes in the third and ninth tale inspire the self-righteous offender to restart a new — virtuous — life, even if the sharp response makes some of the aggressors feel ashamed.34 But again this does not imply any inner change. They are just painfully suffering the boomerang effect of their bragging.35 The "motto" causes a kind of self-insight, which may come down to the Sermon on the Mount's proverb about those who look for the splinters in the eyes of others whilst ignoring the plank in their own, but it does not have the strength to change social reality or human behavior in a significant way.36 When one considers the limited impact of language, it is tempting to read the fourth novella as a downright parody of such a power. After being served a words and actions "nel quale a perdere è il gesto di fronte all'onnipotenza della parola [...] come a dire loro, ammiccando, che il gesto che hanno compiuto è stato del tutto inutile" (// potere della parola 151). See also Anzani's interpretation of novella 9: "[...] si esalta quella parola capace di fondare una nuova società il cui cardine è costituito da oratores (primo fra tutti Guido Cavalcanti), i quali, grazie alla parola ornata, sono in grado di intervenire efficacemente sulla realtà storica, modificandola e migliorandola secondo quell'immagine di paradiso terrestre descritto nella cornice" (27). 33 See Dec. 1.9.3. Elissa introduces her tale as an example of how "quello che varie riprensioni e molte pene date a alcuno non hanno potuto in lui adoperare, una parola molte volte, per accidente non che ex proposito detta, l'ha operato." Here too, interestingly the lady's biting question is described as "mordere la miseria del detto re" (1.9.6). 34 See Dec. 6.3.11: "[...] sentendosi parimente trafitti [...] senza guardar l'un l'altro vergognosi e taciti se n'andarono, senza più quel giorno dirle alcune cosa." Also 6.5.16: "Il che messer Forese udendo il suo error riconobbe, e videsi di tal moneta pagato quali erano state le derrate vendute." And 6.9.14. Mazzotta may be right when he states that "the poet dissipates the illusions of the brigata and brings its members to an explicit awareness of their common finitude," but in my view this does not imply a "way in which secular poetry acts on history" (69). 35 The offender realizes that he did not assess the situation and his "victim" carefully enough before entering into an argument. 36 In my view Mineo overstates the words' impact when he says in his analysis of Filippa's plea: "Complessivamente l'inatteso opera come una sorta di straniamento. Produce cioè uno spostamento di ottica, che fa riconsiderare da altri, impraticati, punti di vista la realtà che qualcosa a un certo punto ha improvvisamente turbato. È un effetto catartico del comico, e la parola, pur attraverso l'alea dell'offesa e della difesa, serve a ricomporre gli equilibri spezzati" (59).</page><page sequence="14">Dec. 6: Language's Polysemy or the Importance of Being Understood 301 one-legged common crane37 and then assured by his Venetian cook that cranes have only one leg, the master wants him to prove his absurd assertion. Spotting a swarm of cranes resting on one leg the relieved cook shows them to his still raging master whose rage vanishes as soon as the cook explains that the second leg came to the ground because of his master's bellowing "Ho, ho!" (Dec. 6.4.17), and that at dinner the leg was missing since the master had failed to shout. It is difficult to say what exactly caused the master's laughter. A reason may have been that the answer implies in a whistle-stop tour of Genesis the sovereign power of man, which is conceived as being derived from speech, even in the reduced form of inarticulate yet communicatively meaningful sounds. Currado 's understanding of the "motto" might then catch the cook's unintentional parody of the power of language as being capable of modifying, if not changing, reality — a power which God conveyed to men to rule over the beasts of the earth by giving them names. Only the seventh novella is an exception for it seems to confirm the power of language. After having been caught in flagrante by her husband and taken to court, Madonna Filippa manages to free herself from the death penalty and, at the same time, her city Prato from an unlawful law. At first glance her use of language — cast in the classical rhetorical genre of pleading — proves to be literally liberating and brings about a sensible change. As far as the first part of her speech is concerned, however, it is clear that her words convince less than her straightforward ideas do. Stating that a law made without the consent of those it applies to is unjust obviously meets with the court's sympathy (Dec. 6.7.14) Filippa's excellent rhetorical skills are only performed in the second part when she asks her husband a series of questions about her being a good wife, thereby turning the plaintiff into the principal witness for the defense. Leaving aside the thorny question as to whether Boccaccio is making a case for hedonism,38 the way she — following rhetorical recommendations — bases her arguments on indisputable authorities such as the Bible is much more to the point regarding the Sixth Day's topic. She quotes a proverbial passage from Christ's Sermon on the Mount: "Give not that which is holy to the dogs, neither cast you your pearls before swine" (Matthew 7:6, American King James Version). Then she nimbly modifies the part about the sacred — that is, she draws a parallel with her own body — so as to serve very humane, profane goals. Filippa triggers much laughter and support amongst the gathered people of Prato in relating Christ's "sacred" to her sexuality. However, at the same time, she depreciates this same sexuality — and presumably that of all women — since she calls the unsatisfied part of her desire a leftover ("quel che gli avanza" 37 A female servant who was being courted by the cook had eaten the second leg. 38 In that case Filippa's plea may be considered the noble and more suitable version of Licisca's vulgar statement in the "novella portante." See also Anzani, who, in the context of novella 9, points to a "nuova prospettiva edonistica dell'opera novellistica" (47).</page><page sequence="15">302 Franziska Meier Dec. 6.7.17). By inverting one of Christ's Sermon on the Mount messages, her speech is an accurate demonstration of Mikhail Bachtin's concept of the carnivalesque, i.e., the literary mode of subverting the assumptions of the dominant style and order (Rabelais and His World)?9 But, if we take a broader look at her use of the saying, it is tempting to ask whether Filippa's plea does not go further and actually aims at making the reader aware of how firmly established sentences can be manipulated and undermined. In other words: whether Filippa's plea does not open an intriguing insight into the gap between signifiant and signifié and its liberating potential.40 If this were true, we would be entitled to read Day Six as an invitation to take the contemporaneous linguistic and epistemological crisis as a fertile challenge, especially the unsettling and subversive uncertainty of signs and words which, according to Kurt Flasch, underscores the Decameron,41 Filippa's plea then would provide evidence for the advantages that people may derive from the very uncertainty of signs, including the gap between signifiant and signifié, by exploring what may be called the margins of language. On this level Filippa's plea would turn out to be a springboard to reformulate all kinds of traditional notions and to open up new epistemological spaces.42 From this perspective the previous, rather neglected sixth novella takes on an important role. It differs from the others because of its joyful purposelessness. It does not contain any perilous or uncomfortable situation, but only a self-imposed playful querelle. Yet, apparently it stands out for getting particular attention from the brigata. If we take the author's indications to the letter, most of the novellas are enjoyed by the ladies alone, whereas the sixth and tenth appeal to men and women alike43 and the sixth, in particular, is praised for having a "nuovo argomento" (Dec. 6.7.1). However, there is nothing new about 40 My interpretation, different insofar as I do not share the Lacanian insistence on the exploitation of metaphors, is inspired by Boselli's article: "[...] nous avons affaire à deux opérations de langage de type différent mais l'art du récit chez Boccace consiste bien à exploiter au mieux l'extraordinaire pouvoir de figuration du langage en jouant des analogies entre les figures, infractions au signifiant, et les fautes ou offenses, infractions au signifié" (157-58). 41 It is in particular revealed in the first novella (Flasch 121-69). 42 The term "polysemy" is understood in a primarily linguistic way that is to be distinguished from what Mazzotta describes as "Boccaccio's ambivalences" (4). It is closer to Bruni's "rettorica dei possibili." While Bruni mainly stresses Boccaccio's mastery of language that permitted him to invert and play with words, I am more interested in the benefits that Boccaccio hopes to attain from it. 43 The first three tales meet with the ladies' praise for the courteous way of speaking, whereas the fourth and fifth novellas provoke a more generic reaction: "piacere" and laughter. As to the seventh tale, Boccaccio describes a series of reactions passing from shame to general fun {Dec. 6.8.2-3). After the eighth tale, no reaction is mentioned, whereas the ninth meets with the ladies' praise of Calvalcanti's answer (Dec. 6.10.2).</page><page sequence="16">Dec. 6: Language's Polysemy or the Importance of Being Understood 303 the bet itself, which mirrors the controversial issue of nobility, albeit in a somewhat bizarre way. The youth Michele Scalza defies his brigata by assigning the highest grade of nobility to the Baronci family who are known for their ugliness (6.6.6). The quarrel is taken before a judge the group had agreed upon. He patiently listens to both parties. In his reply Scalza starts with the Aristotelian definition of nobility according to which the most ancient families are the noblest. He then digresses, appealing to the equally wide-spread comparison between God's work of creation and painting. What is new in his argument is that he understands the comparison literally and pushes the anthropomorphism farther. He assumes that God, while creating, was undergoing the same process of learning as every apprentice painter does. He concludes that the Baronci's very ugliness is certain proof of the family's venerable age, of their outstanding nobility {Dec. 6.6.13). Just as Scalza's brigata is delighted at his argumentation and agrees with him immediately, the brigata of the Decameron is intrigued by his "nuovo argomento." Here too it is very likely that the fun emerges from deriving an unexpected meaning from two well-known and authoritative ideas by blending them together and then taking a metaphor at face value. As in Dec. 6.7, it is unlikely that Boccaccio wanted to take a stand in the current debate on nobility. What delights him and his narrators alike is playing around with consensual opinions, building surprising connections and, by doing so, casting new light on old stuff, if not to circumvent these well-trodden paths altogether and to help bring about something new. In both novellas it is less the message of how to live that matters than bouncing around words, sentences, and anything well established or sacrosanct so that the speaker and the audience may turn loose from solidly fixed traditions, even if it is only momentarily. Frate Cipolla's sermon has been often put forward as an example of the liberating impact of words, in particular, of literary, fictitious language. Scholars admire him for being an achieved "fabulatore" — another alter ego of Boccaccio — who uncovers the beauty of words decoupled from any reality.44 Similar to Filippa's plea, Frate Cipolla's preaching is not to be classified as a "motto." It lasts longer than necessary to save him. Again Boccaccio's restraint from taking clear weltanschauliche positions makes it hard to decide whether the tenth novella is meant to be a funny or a moralizing demonstration of the fraudulent business with holy relics — or whether it carries any message at all. In any case, the attention is again shifted to the masterful exploration of the margins of language, to the gap between signifiant and signifié. With Cipolla, however, he is not debasing the sacred, but, vice-versa, dignifying the profane. Apart from the allegedly holy walk across Florence, he presents a parrot's 44 See, among others, Picone: "[...] è la dimostrazione cioè del potere della parola, capace di travestire da Oriente favoloso le vie e i quartieri di Firenze, oppure di dare consistenza corporea alle entità più astratte" ("Leggiadri motti" 184).</page><page sequence="17">304 Franziska Meier feather as an awe-inspiring part of the angel Gabriel's wings {Dec. 6.10.11) and sanctifies the "carboni" for having served as instruments in San Lorenzo's martyrdom (6.10.53-54). Inversely, he also assigns fingers or bones to spiritual entities (6.10.45). In short, Cipolla loosens the connection between signifiant and signifié to the utmost and exploits the "amphiboly" of words which Quintilian had alerted us of.45 The polysemy of language is revealed as a delightful and liberating tool for those who know how to use and to understand it. 6. The Day's Narratological Dimension The extent to which Day Six unpacks a reflection on storytelling and story writing has been already highlighted. According to the late Michelangelo Picone, the Sixth Day figures as a meta-day that opens up intriguing insights in the making of the Decameron,46 Along with the "Proemio," the introduction to Day Four, and the author's conclusion of the Decameron, Picone classifies it as a supporting column.47 In contrast to the introduction to Day Four, which is basically a direct defense of the author's endeavors, in Day Six the members of the brigata themselves feel the urge to account for their pastime. As far as the tales are concerned it is, most of all, the first tale that is generally read as a successful narrative performance of how not to tell a story,48 while the tenth is interpreted as a telling specimen of Boccaccio's concept of fiction and literary writing use. The knight's failure to narrate his story is beyond doubt. But does Boccaccio really want us to grasp the message that in narration names and places ought not to be confused nor the chronology mixed up? If he did, the "supporting column" of Boccaccio's art would be reduced to the elementary principles of storytelling, which is a far cry from his much more complex art of building a "novella." And even if such a rough narratological message were Boccaccio's intention, the puzzling fact that the knight does not mess up the following stories is not accounted for. Of course, the knight's subsequent, albeit mediocre, performance may be due to a social consideration: Madonna Oretta could not have flirted with a complete failure.49 Yet, from a narratological point 45 Institutionis Oratoriae, Book 7, paragraph 9.. It was Pastore Stocchi who drew the attention to "il procedimento retorico (definito vizioso dai trattatisti classici e medievali) dell'aequivocum" (205). 46 Picone also calls it "una giornata liminare" ("Leggiadri motti e pronte riposte: la sesta giornata" esp. 163). 47 Picone counts the Sixth Day among the "colonne di supporto [...] di quel tempio classicheggiante della narrativa breve medievale che è il Decameron" ("L'autore allo specchio dell'opera" 28).. 48 Fido considers it the "poetica di tutto il libro" (87). 49 As for the sexual implications of the ride, see Picone, "Leggiadri motti" (177) and Barberi-Squarotti, "Madonna Oretta" (619-20).</page><page sequence="18">Dec. 6: Language's Polysemy or the Importance of Being Understood 305 of view, such an understanding is not convincing. If we take the novella's oriental antecedent about witty deciphering into account, the reader would be encouraged to depart from the obvious and to seek further.50 The astoundingly successful ending might then be meant to draw the reader's attention to the specific relationship between the narrator and the narrated. The juxtaposition of a failed and a successful tale may be taken as a stimulus to account for the various and highly contingent factors conditioning the telling of any story and, crucially, the complex genre of novellas. This accounting for storytelling is enhanced by several tales in Day Six, which stage the risks of the failure for intrinsic or extrinsic reasons. The reader learns that both the narrator and the listener may be absent-minded or, simply distracted, and that even Giotto who is described as a marvelous narrator did not get his companion's frill attention (Dec. 6.5.13). The lawyer apparently is too distracted by Giotto's ugly outfit and, probably still more, by his own — vicious — urge to "motteggiare" to pay attention to the story. In the case of the Venetian cook, the speaker himself is unaware of his words' meaning. His blatantly absurd "motto" becomes a success only thanks to his master's sensibility. In the eighth novella the uncle's correcting "motto" falls on deaf ears and risks not making sense unless the reader steps in and grasps its subtle content.51 Significantly, Emilia, who presents the novella with its brilliant, though almost failed speech act, has to apologize for her own absent-mindedness. As a result she is forced to fall back on what first crosses her mind and which perhaps won't be up to the brigata's standards, she intimates (6.8.4).52 The most telling example concerning how difficult it is to receive a "motto" is the ninth novella. Cavalcanti's sophisticated and covert sentence first provokes a general stupefaction, then requires exegesis. From the start, the novellas of Day Six focus on the conditions in which a story is told. They do not only reflect on how to perform, but increasingly on how important it is to be understood — an outcome that in Day Six is far from being taken for granted. This reflection, which pervades the day, is developed in two directions. The tales, on the one hand, summon us to scrutinize the relationship between a very long and elaborate description of the characters and the very short verbal action: 50 The novella is based on Zabara's II libro delle delizie (Picone: "11 'Decameron' come macrotesto," in particular 26-28). Differently from Picone, who insists on the shift towards "una finalità estetica e non più etica" (31), I tend to take the oriental antecedent as a reminder for the reader to seek other meanings. 51 Giusti takes the eighth novella as his starting point. He wants to prove "il fondamentale valore del momento della comprensione all'interno della dialettica verbale in cui si incontrano oratore e pubblico. [...] E quindi mia intenzione evidenziare come il momento dell'ascoltatore-pubblico costituisca il momento fondamentale di verifica dell'esattezza nell'uso e allo stesso tempo della relatività essenziale della parola" (321). 52 See also Giusti 344. Accordingly, the risk of "completa incomunicabilità" can be found both in this novella and in the novella portante.</page><page sequence="19">306 Franziska Meier the "motto." The description of the characters, of course, is required for the understanding of the otherwise incomprehensible "motto." Yet, in Day Six the relationship is taken to an extreme. Sometimes the description overdoes what is strictly necessary to grasp the verbal exchange.53 In the eighth novella the lack of balance is even more striking because the fatuous and silly niece is exhaustively represented, whereas the protagonist of the "motto," her uncle, is only sketchily introduced. By pointing out the importance of the description Boccaccio touches the very core of his genre "novella." In general terms, a novella comes about through a remodeling of the huge reservoir of oral and written traditions. A target of the remodeling is to develop the typified figures into multi-layered and complex characters whose motivations and respective circumstances are ambivalent.54 Along with this more complex characterization, the plots and words assume sometimes puzzling meanings which testify to the inscrutability of human life and society. It is this very increase in complexity that shapes the relationship between description and action in the Decameron and is highlighted by the sometimes striking lack of balance in Day Six's novellas. At the same time, however, the novellas feature a broad spectrum of reaction to the "motto" which goes from an utter non-understanding to a very sophisticated comprehension.55 Three of the novellas are particularly intriguing because they contrast the reception of the "ignoranti" with the elite's understanding. In the second tale, the baker Cisti, whose low profession and social rank does not at first glance betray his actual inner nobility, cautiously approaches of the noble Geri to invite him to have a glass of wine in front of his house. When Geri sends his servant to fetch some of the same wine for his farewell feast, Cisti is shocked by the servant's request to fill "un gran fiasco" in order to have some wine for himself {Dec. 6.2.9). He is appalled because the servant evidently does not see the difference between himself and the baker. When Cisti explains his refusal saying that the servant had been sent "'A Arno"' (6.2.25), the servant does not make sense of it. His attention is glued to the literal sense. The master, however, understands the hint and recognizes his 53 From another point of view Usher emphasizes a peculiarity of Boccaccio, attributable to a "kind of literature [...] with its conscious if subversive re-evocation of past models, and its internal tensions between pre-existent récit and his own penchant for discours" (336). 54 See Neuschafer's pioneering work. In this comparative study he explores in particular the characters' "Doppelpoligkeit" and Boccaccio's new parodie parodying fashioning of the medieval examples. 55 See the very essential reflections on different audiences in Francesco Bruni's chapter on "Prosa e situazioni comunicative nel 'Decameron,'" in particular 390-92. According to Migiel's reading of the eighth tale in Day Three, "the Decameron resists us, and in doing so, it tries to show us that it functions less as a chronicle of good and bad behavior and more as a mirror for our own processes of discernment and judgment" (198).</page><page sequence="20">Dec. 6: Language's Polysemy or the Importance of Being Understood 307 servant's insolence. Cisti's answer, we are told, opened Geri's mind, the "occhi dell'intelletto" (26) — an expression that occurs in Dante's Vita nova too. In this encounter a subtle use of language distinguishes the nobility of both the speaker and of his addressee.56 The mutual recognition finds its symbolic image in the exquisite wine, reserved for those who are able to appreciate it, i.e., for an elite of the really noble. The mixed audience in the second novella emphasizes the capacity to employ and to understand the double entendre as a soft indicator of nobility. In the aftermath of the 13th century's social turmoil and of the 1348 plague, the call for such a secret code rooted in everyday language must have been strong. Another mixed audience occurs in the Dec. 6.9. Contrary to most of the previous novellas which end with the "motto," here the sentence is followed by a detailed description of two receptions. Most of the assaulting brigata remain confused by Cavalcanti's answer and quickly suspect the speaker of having gone crazy. Only their leader Brunelleschi becomes thoughtful and eventually senses the nasty reproach under the courteous, arcane surface: it is the brigata and not Cavalcanti who leads a useless, superficial life. By unlocking the retort's hidden meaning Brunelleschi rises out of his peers' ignorance and will be revered for it. Whereas in the previous novella of Fresco and his niece the reader has to fill in to prevent the motto's failure, in the ninth the enigmatic sentence is explained by a character, but this is not to hinder other readers from being stimulated to rival Brunelleschi.57 Hence the novella does not merely stage the imponderability of reception, but goes beyond that to designate reception as a never-ending process which distinguishes the novella — as well as literature in general. At this point the query arises as to whether Boccaccio, by transferring the sentence attributed to Cavalcanti's medical commentator Dino del Garbo to the philosopher and poet Cavalcanti himself, intended to highlight a peculiarity of literary texts: their need to be received and interpreted.58 Contrary to these novellas, Frate Cipolla's performance consists of actively and masterfully playing with, or "working," a mixed audience.59 On the one 56 According to Mazzotta, Cisti's redeeming himself in the social hierarchy by language depends on the "apt description of Fortune not as the random, blind chance of the pagans, but as an Intelligence of God. The world is given a metaphysical coherence; in other words, and within this context, language has its efficacy" (63). Fortune and Nature, indeed, are called "ministre del mondo" (Dec. 6.2.6), but they are not presented as God's executors in the novella. 57 See in particular Durling's marvelous and very far-reaching reflections. He understands the novella as a key to the general issue of "interpretation" and interpreting Dante in Boccaccio. 58 Concerning the tradition and attribution of Cavalcanti's sentence, see. Olsen and Rossi. 59 See also Giusti 342. In his analysis he emphasizes the "presenza di un significato plurimo" that requires a mixed audience to be understood. According to Usher, Boccaccio faced two types of readers from the beginning of his career. In this he disagrees with</page><page sequence="21">308 Franziska Meier hand, he addresses the ignorant pious community of peasants who expect a narration of a pilgrimage and are therefore misled.60 In this story their ignorance, though, does not fix their attention exclusively on the literal meaning but facilitates their being sent off on an imaginary religious journey to the East. On the other hand, the friar addresses the two friends — members of his brigata — who had set the trap and are now enjoying Cipolla 's dexterity {Dec. 6.10.53 55) In short, his sermon responds both to the community's naïve religious or rather superstitious belief and to the two friends' curiosity to see him get out of a tight spot, which he does by utilizing a series of audacious double entendre.61 Hence by staging mixed audiences Day Six considers language and novellas, from the perspective of reception with its different levels and from that of production, i.e., of how to use language. By emphasizing a mixed audience it may even be a testimony to the author's wish to address a much broader readership.62 Significantly, Boccaccio addresses the question of a mixed audience in the context of painting, too. Introducing Giotto, Panfilo praises him for having "quell'arte ritornata in luce" {Dec. 6.5.6); thanks to his spectacular realism the Florentine had elevated painting from artisan craftsmanship delighting the eyes of the "ignoranti" to a full-fledged art form appreciated by the educated: "compiacere allo 'ntelletto de' savi."63 The narrator brings in a commonly known assessment. Nonetheless, his preamble is striking because the plunge into art history does not contribute to the understanding of the "motto" and because it resumes the two kinds of receivers which are so characteristic in Day Six. It is Bruni's assumption that the first Boccaccio prevailingly addresses women ("Boccaccio on Readers and Reading"). 60 Bruni points out the "giusto sistema delle attese" triggered by Cipolla in order to misguide his audience (404). 61 In this I do not agree with Mazzotta's assessment: "The trick of the two friends and their admiration for the sermon dramatize the whole process of literary creation, from the cheap reality of its intent to the mystification of representation. At the same time, their detached perspective on the fiction and the theatricality of Frate Cipolla's mark the degradation of language as prophecy to language as sheer performance" (66). In my view, there is no prophetical dimension implied. 62 Boccaccio's wishes concerning his book's format testify to this ambition. See Terlizzi, especially 210. 63 See Dec. 6.5.5-6: "[...] il cui nome fu Giotto, ebbe uno ingegno di tanta eccellenzia, che niuna cosa dà la natura, madre de tutte le cose e operatrice col continuo girar de' cieli, che egli con lo stile e con la penna o col pennello non dipignesse si simile a quella, che non simile, anzi più tosto dessa paresse, in tanto che molte volte nelle cose fatte si trova che il visivo senso degli uomini vi prese errore, quello credendo esser vero che era dipinto. E per ciò, avendo egli quell'arte ritornata in luce, che molti secoli sotto gli error d'alcuni, che più a dilettar gli occhi degl'ignoranti che a compiacere allo 'ntelletto de' savi dipignendo, era stata sepulta, meritamente una delle luci della fiorentina gloria dir se puote."</page><page sequence="22">Dec. 6: Language's Polysemy or the Importance of Being Understood 309 tempting to capture in it an allusion to Boccaccio's own ambitions as an author, even though the situation he had to face is slightly different from that of Giotto. Unlike painting which is said to have fallen into decay because of the "errori" in the past, probably in the Middle Ages, the tradition of storytelling had hardly ever enjoyed the benevolence of the educated. According to the well-established hierarchy of the three styles, prose is confined to the lowest level. It is unlikely that Boccaccio intended to strip it of its humble origins. However, he may have wanted to valorize storytelling by converting and ennobling it into the genre of "novella," — to put it more precisely — by working on a sophisticated codification of the recent genre in which, in the footsteps of Dante's Comedia, all kinds of plots and stylistic or linguistic levels converge. If we bear in mind Pampinea's statement that Nature or Fortuna likes to hide inner nobility under low or ugly surfaces so that they glitter all the more once they are uncovered (6.2.6), Boccaccio's allusions to the poor renown of storytelling turns out to be a strategy. He too hides treasures away from the vulgar and makes them shine brighter for those who know how to detect them. Or, as he says in the introduction to Day Four, he deliberately stays in the valley — i.e., in the despised genre of storytelling — in order to elude the critical and moralizing glance of some of his contemporaries.64 It is significant that Panfilo bases Giotto's achievements on the perfect rendering of reality. As mentioned, the praise in itself was fairly common at that time and deeply rooted in ancient legends of painters. Nonetheless, it raises the query as to what the difference might be between the visual fun the "ignoranti" are having and the intellectual delight the sages take. Did the educated really go for the mastery of mimesis or even for Giotto's creation of an illusion which outdoes God's creation? Then the difference should lie in their ability to acknowledge the painter's performance which brilliantly competes with God's creation. If we assume that they only took delight in the mimetic aspect, Boccaccio might have hoped that the educated could be appealed to by his own concept of a prose art mirroring social and anthropological reality. But there is a rub. The educated, i.e., the emerging humanists, usually do not take their thrill from visual simulation, from technical perfection but from detecting carefully hidden allegorical messages. Certainly, in the Decameron it is too farfetched to suppose some kind of fourfold exegesis or to seek out allegorical meaning. But we might consider that there is some intellectual fun to be had from a narrating whose humble outfit covers a sophisticated playing with 64 The author writes: "[...] essendomi di fuggire ingegnato il fiero impeto di questo rabbioso spirito, non solamente pe' piani ma ancora per le profondissime valli mi sono ingegnato d'andare; il che assai manifesto può apparire a chi le presenti novellette riguarda, le quali non solamente in florentin volgar e in prosa scritte per me sono e senza titolo, ma ancora in istilo umilissimo e rimesso quanto il più si possono" (Dee. 4. Intro 3 4).</page><page sequence="23">310 Franziska Meier the polysemy of words and the margins of language. We might even go further and imagine a delight triggered by an art devoted to a realism that promises to cover the entire range of social and cultural levels while not binding the prose to a merely mirroring function. The educated can then take delight in sounding the different layers of the composition and how they are interwoven:65 the novellas within the "novella portante," within the author's speech, ending up as a kind of Chinese mirror box from which different challenging meanings can be unfolded and drawn out. It would then follow that the real joy of the Decameron lies in unlocking its composition by those who know how to. Nonetheless, whatever the intellectual range and aims of readership might have been, the preamble's insight into Giotto's exploits opens up new perspectives on Boccaccio's ambitions at the moment of the Decameron's own genesis. 7. Conclusion of Day Six The brevity of the ten novellas of Day Six has left the brigata with a lot of spare time on its hands. After his coronation Dioneo tells his subjects to enjoy the remaining hours up till the usual hour they reassemble for dinner. Whereas the three men turn to playing cards, the former queen Elissa convinces the other ladies to visit the "Valle delle donne." For the first time ever — indeed, since they met in Santa Maria Novella — the ladies break away from the men's company which, at the beginning, mattered so much to them on account of their sex's proverbial mobility and hostility towards any solid and lasting order.66 Apparently Elissa has not completely resigned from her duties and may have it in mind to pay Dioneo back for challenging her rule. The freedom granted by the new king surprisingly brings about a kind of counter-rule.67 After their secret outing it will be the task of Pampinea — she who established the rules of the brigata — to let the king know about their transgressing the self-imposed order. Dioneo, however, does not take it as an offense to his rule. He jokingly points out to the ladies that they played a "beffa" on men (Dec. 6. Conci. 34-35) and thereby had anticipated his Day's topic by deeds and not only, as agreed upon, 65 The "arte combinatoria," as Velli calls it, may have been a sort of hidden treasure (134). 66 See Dec. 1. Intro. 75: "Ricordivi che noi siamo tutte femine, e non ce n'ha niuna sì fanciulla, che non possa ben conoscere come le femine sien ragionate insieme e senza la provedenza d'alcuno uomo si sappiano regolare. Noi siamo mobili, riottose, sospettose, pusillanime e paurose per le quali cose io dubito forte, se non alcuna altra guida non prendiamo che la nostra, che questa compagnia non si dissolva troppo più tosto e con meno onor di noi che non ci bisognerebbe." 67 According to Barolini, it is Dioneo's merit to force the ladies into turning active and, thereby, he triggers an "unparalleled liberty." Of course, it depends on how you understand liberty. In my reading, the visit takes on the character of a willing and somewhat problematic infraction of the self-imposed laws (178).</page><page sequence="24">Dec. 6: Language's Polysemy or the Importance of Being Understood 311 by words. Day Six therefore ends with the brigata'?, splitting in two gender aligned groups before they reunite for the usual festivities. A large part of the conclusion is dedicated to the description of the Valley whose features are reminiscent of Dante's earthly paradise.68 In the series of exciting gardens and landscapes where the company lingers, the Valley stands out for its beautiful formation in which nature and art are confusingly interwoven (Dec. 6. Concl. 20, 24) and for its transparent pond which incorporates the purity and innocence of the valley, while simultaneously being interspersed with some topical motifs evoking sexuality69 and, what is more, sceneries of male violence against women.70 Therefore the same kind of ambiguity that crops up in the novellas recurs at the end. The author depicts an extraordinary landscape into which he makes his female narrators enthusiastically plunge with free abandon; at the same time he intersperses the description with ambiguities that question their naïve confidence. Finally the Day designed for working out the shift from the reign of Fortuna to human ingenuity closes with a ballata highlighting the despairing impotence of language and sung by Elissa, the same lady who had asked her subjects to tell stories about "motti." As in Day Four when the new queen, Fiammetta, asks Filostrato, the exiting king, to sing, it is the departing ruler who is invited to sing the ballata. But whereas Filostrato was chosen because the subsequent queen wanted to free the company from his contagious sadness once and for all, Elissa seems to be selected by Dioneo for returning the honor she had bestowed on him and for giving her day a perfect conclusion. What happens is that she astonishes her friends by questioning the power of language and by an unexpected, emotional outburst. In her song words serve exclusively to dramatize her pains and suffering in love. They do not relieve, let alone save her. Moreover, in her song the noble Elissa, who had banished the servant's vulgarity, lets herself descend into a literally "infernal" vocabulary (w. 1, 10, 11; Branca, Dec. 6 Concl. 43n6), far removed from sublimity and courteousness of lyrical poetry. Conversely, when Dioneo asks the idealist Tindaro to play his shawm after her song, the utter bitterness of Elissa's despair and the brigata's concern about the message of the ballata seem to be counterbalanced, if not brought back to harmony, by an elegiac music without words. University of Gôttingen 68 Picone's reads the day as an ascension from the low beginning to the earthly paradise ("Leggiadri motti" 165-66). 69. Stillinger explores the sexual nature of the valley in "The Language of Gardens." 70 See Gittes: "While it has been suggested that the Valle delle donne marks the apogee of female emancipation from social constraint, 1 prefer — for the reasons enumerated above — to view the Valle as a place whose function is variable in accordance with the perspective from which it is viewed" (162).</page><page sequence="25">312 Franziska Meier Works Cited Alighieri, Dante.
