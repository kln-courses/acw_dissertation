<plain_text><page sequence="1">et de la terre feminine" (p. 155). Thus every description within the novel contributes to make of this estuary setting a metamorphosis and apparition of the idol-goddess Helianthe-the divine huntress Diana of antiquity and the contemporary, unclothed Artemis. The reader has moved with the narrator from the disappearance of Helianthe through the complex attempts on his part to encapsulate her soul and essence in Nature. Multiple rituals have been invested to relive and to preserve the past in an eternal rite of love. We have seen the narrator, the dog Diane, the acolytes Christophe and Judith, and a group of young friends go through the orgiastic choreography of coupling, adorned in furs, feathers and totemistic trappings-la fete totemique-and we have worshiped with them this idol-god, "bissexue, egoiste, se mirant dans les eternelles delices de son unite" (p. 189). The narrator thus triumphs in his blind quest to transform his dark night into an illuminated vision, a million visions, of Helianthe, and to entomb them forever in this mausoleum-novel. Thus he breaks the bonds of blindness. In this evocative mythology, Grainville has succeeded in stirring the imagination of the reader to experience a totemistic world of animals, stones, numerology, plants and objects. One envisions the human condition in a new dimension; it is seen from a new perspective. One is even tempted to believe with the narrator that "les commencements sont vrais et definitifs. Les betes ne nous ont jamais quittes. Intacte nous retrouvons en nous la splendeur du loup" (p. 241). University of Illinois, Chicago Circle Kenneth I. Perry LAUGIER, JEAN. Rituel pour une ode. Illustrations de Fillol Roig. Paris: Editions Caracteres, 1978. Pp. 141. Quatre suites de poemes, "Romancero du corps", "Germinations de l'ame", "Epode" et "Les Navires du temps" composent ce volume de Jean Laugier, auteur de six recueils de poemes et de trois pieces de theatre. Des caracteristiques nombreuses y convergent: certains poemes y sont d'un lyrisme presque vetuste, rappelant celui d'anciennes romances; d'autres, d'une musicalite legere et savante, sont pleins de fraicheur dans leur poursuite d'une essence. Le vocabulaire contient des mots rares, comme amusiaux, ou comme les formes verbales pregna, avalisons, branstille, et le neologisme de euthanasiee. 11 va aussi du familier le plus quotidien, voire meme un peu gros, a une coquetterie presque precieuse. Le gratuit y est parfois proche de l'absurde. Certes tout est permis, et nous avons aime "la rosee a tete de chatte" de Breton, mais c'est peut-etre le voulu et non l'automatique que nous aimons un peu moins dans des vers comme "Et chaque etoile dans la nuit / Parait silencieuse de paille". D'autre part, on admire la clarte elegante de certains poemes, le tragique presque rude de tels autres, des metaphores ou des expressions consacrees se presentent sous un jour nouveau, comme dans "A transhumer jusqu'a plus soif". La variete est grande aussi dans l'architecture des textes et dans le metre. On trouve d'amples strophes ou les vers se deplient, se deroulent, pour ramener, en des rimes embrassees, une proie presque mysterieuse. I1 en est ainsi dans les douze sonnets de la suite intitulee "Repons", dont le sonnet III contient cette strophe elliptique et claire a la fois, si telle chose est possible: "II serait une antienne / De tous temps a redire / Que le miel et la cire / Ne soient jeux d'anatheme". Le lyrisme, la grace, voisinent avec un discours abrupt, hermetique, qui peut faire penser a la "Prose pour des Esseintes". Les vingt et un poemes de "Germination de l'ame", de vers longs et, pour la plupart, rimes, sont presque tous constitues de trois quatrains pleins d'ardeur. En somme, un tragique qui se veut sans trop de gravite, le voisinage d'un lyrisme delicat et de constructions quelque peu forcees, des reussites dont certaines etonnent sans ravir, mais aussi des trouvailles qui ravissent sans 6tonner-eclat et douceur-marquent la poesie de Jean Laugier. I1 faut la lire avec beaucoup d'attention, de recueillement meme, car, comme il le dit dans un de ses poemes: "Les clefs que chacun cele / Ouvrent toutes les portes".

Pp. 278. Composed simultaneously, Le Clezio's volume of essays, L'Inconnu sur la terre, and his volume of REVIEWS 153</page><page sequence="2">short stories are facets of the same wish to lead the reader, through words, into a parallel, wordless, primitive universe of spontaneous perception. The essays delineate these themes with clarity; the short stories create worlds in which these themes are immediately perceptible. Le Clezio announces his goal to the reader with the first words of L'Inconnu: "Je voudrais vous parler loin, longtemps, avec des mots qui ne seraient pas seulement des mots, mais qui conduiraient jusqu'au ciel, jusqu'a l'espace, jusqu'a la mer." His point of view is that of a child, perhaps the child within all of us, who sees the universe surrejnding him directly, without the interference of previous prejudices, of human knowledge. The world into which he leads the reader is a primitive one, forgotten by civilized man, but still the province not only of the child but of the poor and the very old, the timeless representatives of a humanity that expects nothing, that is simply there, open to the universe. This deliberate choice of point of view causes Le Clezio to glorify the perceptions linked to primitive man: the world is a series of cycles, of unending repetition of day and night, where simple gestures (the making of bread, for example) and animal ruse are glorified at the expense of more civilized perceptions. He sees the philosophy and logic of contemporary civilization as opaque screens which prevent man from being really present in the world. Language, too, becomes divided between the primitive and the civilized: musicality of language is linked to the child (Le Clezio quotes, approvingly, the Spanish song "Golondrinas," which consists of only one repeated word, the Spanish word for "swallows"), whereas he rejects as part of the encumbering civilization logical communication by words. To perceive nature directly, primitively, is to animate it, to deify it, a characteristic of both the essays and the short stories. Mountains, clouds, night, and the stars are all described in anthropo- morphic terms; in fact, even the olive trees of one essay have personal characteristics. There is a parallel tendency to visualize the world from a non-human point of view: one essay describes the world as seen by an insect, another by a seagull. From anthropomorphic description of nature to its deification is a small, immediately-taken step. Trees, mountains, rocks, and even children (as extensions of the natural world) are all described as "peut-etre les seuls dieux r6els." In his attempt to include language within the world of spontaneous perception while removing it from the world of adult civilization, Le Clezio makes words into animate entities. They become in several essays insects which burrow and hide, animals, and even children: "Les mots volent, se carambolent, font des remous, des dessins, les mots sautillent et dansent, loin des discours tragiques et des paroles stupides des adultes." Non-verbal communication is glorified, the smile becomes a primeval means of contact, and the glance of another person (preferably that of a woman, child, or old man) conveys a wordless secret which surpasses any possible linguistic interaction. Searching for the basic life source within the human being (most often symbolized by light or the sun), Le Clezio frequently reverts to the Romantic theme of 6vasion. Both essays and short stories reveal a wish to be ailleurs (although not so much anywhere out of this world as anywhere absorbed into it), a yearning for experience and communication on a non-rational level. Roads, busses, clouds, the sea with its cargo ships, all become suggestions of the urge to become united with the "azur" of the sky, the "bleu libre de la mer." At the end of this quest is the elemental silence, the ultimate unification with the universe: "Je voudrais retrouver les pays ou personne ne parle, les pays de bergers et pecheurs oui tout est silencieux." The volume of short stories, containing seven stories in addition to the title story, recreates this quest with, for the most part, children as central figures. Their names are deliberately non-realistic- Mondo, Lullaby, Jon, Juba-and the location of the stories seems equally indeterminate. One has vaguely the feeling that some stories may be taking place in Africa, some in the south of France; and some seem clearly linked with Mexico or elsewhere in Latin America. Le Clezio's favorite locations for communication with the universe form the background for many of these nouvelles: abandoned houses and gardens, casemates returning to nature, rocks overlooking the sea, and the primitive world of desert and pastures. At one with this universe, his child-heroes (he calls them "enfants-f6es") know spontaneously the secret of communication with the natural world, a secret lost to the world of adults. Obviously, the use of words to communicate non-verbal feeling and non-logic, to glorify primitive life forces over civilization, creates a tension in both volumes, a tension which Le Clezio sometimes exploits to his advantage (the description of the ultra-modern bus as a symbol of 6vasion, for example, 154 FRENCH REVIEW</page><page sequence="3">or Lullaby's confrontation of her perception of light reflected on the sea with the calculation of light's refraction learned in a lycee class), but which can lead to both repetition and wordiness. Each of the children in the short stories describes what he has just seen as the most beautiful thing he has ever seen; each natural element becomes in its turn the only god. The essays seem to circumvent this problem successfully, whereas one has the distinct feeling that one is reading the same short story over and over, with only incidental changes of names and scenery. What is most noticeably missing here is the humor of much of Le Clezio's early work. In these volumes, Le Clezio appears dead serious about his child-heroes; the reader may find it somewhat difficult to share this viewpoint. The University of Massachusetts, Amherst Patricia J. Johnson LEWINO, WALTER. Une Femme par jour. Paris: Albin Michel, 1978. Pp. 246. 29 F. In spite of its title, this collection of thirty short stories is not entirely devoted to erotic themes. The content and tone of the stories vary considerably: from the sophisticated "radical chic" conversation in the first tale or the sexploits of the book's namesake piece to the tedious monotony of "Le Sur- mois," which records one man's efforts to calculate and account for every minute of his daily (monthly) routine. Tragedy becomes the final appraisal for "Maryon, marions-nous"-a tale whose ironic twist may strike a cord of angry sympathy within women readers. At other times, Lewino's love of irony suddenly turns into cruel black humor ("Les Moteurs de la societe") or explodes into acts of astounding violence. Although each story moves toward an unexpected ending, after a while the reader begins to anticipate the outcome and sometimes can guess quite accurately. Such is the case with "Le Theatre de l'atelier"; however, the obvious punch-line does not in any way diminish the pleasure of the story, which depicts painters' foibles and egomania in splendid ironic style. On the other hand, "Donnant donnant" thoroughly succeeds in surprising the reader, and the story's final lines incite to a second reading-much as a good poem compels the reader to take a second look, whereupon each line takes on a completely different meaning. Two of the racier tales ending on a twist are "Mon Ami Gustave" and "Le Cosaque du don," the latter of which could have become, without its final paragraph, the cherished fantasy of round and balding middle-aged men. One of the more compelling tales is "L'Enfant de la grappe," which reads like a good mystery. In fact, "mystery tales" may be the most accurate term for describing the genre of this collection. Whatever the subject (not all are concerned with crimes or passion), the reader, fascinated and absorbed, hurries on to the end to see how it will all turn out. Yet, as in a detective novel, the reader wants to slow down to linger over details, search for clues, and attempt to guess the denouement before its sudden appearance. Towards the middle of the collection, as the reader becomes more aware of the "mystery" aspect in the stories, there is a higher frequency of sinister tales with macabre endings, peopled with shady characters from the minor-league underworld. Lewino's propensity for argot surfaces at this point and argot tends to become the stylistic norm. The commentary on the book's back cover heralds Lewino's overall style as "du Woody Allen facon parisienne." The analogy holds some truth, I suppose, when one thinks of Allen's low-keyed humor, his exploitation of human foibles and myopic self-evaluations-or perhaps when one recalls the social commentary latent in his films. Lewino's prologue for his collection is attributed to Woody Allen: "La premiere fois que j'ai vu une femme nue, j'ai cru que c'6tait une erreur." The quote gives some indication of Lewino's brand of humor, which is often light-handed irony with a touch of the absurd. Yet the very weaknesses of the collection stem from the stories that remind me of those aspects in Woody Allen's work which please me least: insipid preoccupation with base and banal activities such as walking the dog, as in Lewino's "Chienne de vie," whose humor escapes me. The only protagonist who strongly resembles the touchingly ill-fated and somewhat helpless Allenesque anti-hero appears in the delightful "La Sorciere aux dents vertes." Many of the strongest moments in Lewino's collection bring to mind the names of more recognized story-tellers. Certain tales demonstrate a gift for the vivid, accurate description and balanced irony typical of 0. Henry. The more sinister and macabre endings are vaguely reminiscent of Poe.
