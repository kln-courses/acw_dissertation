<plain_text><page sequence="1">[ 39 ] BERKELEIAN STUDIES IN AMERICA AND FRANCE WITH AN APPENDIX ON A NEW LETTER ABOUT BERKELEY'S FATHER. To keep a bibliography of Berkeley up-to-date is no easy matter.1 Since our Bicentenary Commemoration of 1953 (non ergo propter hoc) books on him and articles in periodi cals have been appearing at the rate of five or six a year. The challenge of his philosophy is felt, and taken up, alike in the New World and the Old. In this article I propose to consider two books on Berkeley recently published : the former is of limited scope, but very scholarly, by a young American thinker ; the latter covers the whole range of Berkeley's philosophy, and is by a French philosopher of mature judgment and established reputation, who honoured us with his presence here six years ago, and made an impressive contribution to our ' Homage to George Berkeley'. The books are : The early reception of Berkeley's Immaterialism, 1710 1733, by H. M. Bracken, 123 pages, Martinus Nijhoff, The Hague ; 9.50 guilders, and George Berkeley, par Andre-Louis Leroy, 282 pages. Presses Universitaires de France. From the former book we learn, inter alia, how completely French philosophers of the eighteenth century misunderstood Berkeley's main theme ; in the latter book French philosophy of to-day has made amends, and in the person of Professor Leroy shows a full understanding of Berkeley's immaterialism. When Descartes was alive and his thought dominant, it must have seemed axiomatic to most folk, that mind and matter formed the sum total of existence. From mind and matter, the sum total of 1 Soe Bibliographie in Leroy's George Berkeley, p. 277 ff.</page><page sequence="2">40 BERKELEIAN STUDIES IN existence, take away matter ; and what is left ? Ans. Mind. Q.E.D. On that simple, fallacious subtraction-sum much misunderstanding of Berkeley turned, and turns. Folk fail to see the difference between a denial of matter and a denial of the world of sense, and in consequence they make the fatally easy transition from ' there is no matter ' to ' all is mind'. Professor Bracken, of the State University of Iowa, has been studying the opinions of Berkeley's contemporaries about his philosophy, especially those of Continental philosophers. Professor R. H. Popkin,2 of the same university, who read a paper at our Bicentenary Com memoration, has already done good work in this field. Bracken has unearthed several new-old reviews and notices, and here presents them. Printing the texts as Appendices, he analyses six items which, for convenience, I group as .follows : (1) A review of Berkeley's Principles in the Journal des Sfavans for September, 1711. (2) A long review of the Three Dialogues in the first number of the Journal Literaire, May-June, 1713. (3) Notices of both books in the Memoires de Trevoux for, respectively, May and December, 1713, and strictures -by Pere Tournemine on ' Les Immaterialistes '. (4) Selections from Berkeley or about him, taken from various articles in Chambers's Cyclopaedia, 1728. All these extracts except No. 2 (misdated ' 1715 ' in our edition of the Works) are new to Berkeleian scholars of to-day ; but Bracken was kind enough to send advance notice of his finds to Jessop and myself, enabling us to include the references in the Addenda to our volume IX. Bracken has done a useful piece of scholarly research, and he here publishes the results in a convenient, well printed, and well-documented form, suitably rounding off 2 ' Berkeley's influence on American philosophy Hermathena, LXXXII, November 1953, p. 128.</page><page sequence="3">AMERICA AND FRANCE 41 his study with a chapter on Andrew Baxter's criticism of Berkeley in his An Enquiry into the Nature of the Human Soul (1733). Bracken has tried to show, he says, 'that Berkeley's philosophical reputation began sooner than has been realized ', and that Reid and Kant, who had much to say to his ' subsequent reputation, philosophized in a milieu which was conditioned by twenty years of what I hope will now be admitted as distorted criticism'. He has achieved these modest aims, and has done more. His readers can hardly help reflecting how open to mis understanding Berkeley is, and how important it is to ' read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest' Berkeley's own books, especially the Principles, if we would know the true nature of Berkeley's immaterialism. The notices grouped under No. (3) above hardly deserve their resurrection. They are written from the angle of religious controversy. The writers are Jesuits, Bracken says, and they are using Berkeley as an ad absurdum proof of the errors of the Malebranchists, even charging him with solipsism. The first two pieces are short and slight. Tournemine's strictures are marred by odium theologicum. Berkeley was not a Malebranchist ; but, as I showed years ago, he was deeply influenced by the Recherche in his College days, and probably took from it his first doubt about the existence of matter ; the reviewer's description of Berkeley as ' Malebranchiste de bonne foi' is therefore of considerable interest. Ephraim Chambers, too (No. 4 above), saw in Berkeley what he wanted to see in him. The vision of all things in God, common to Malebranche and Berkeley, was apparently of no interest to Chambers ; he quotes Berkeley and comments on him almost as if the Berkeleian deity were nothing more than a pious ornament of the system. Chambers was interested in Berkeley's epistemology, especially in his attack on abstract ideas. Berkeley, he says, has ' gone a good way towards overturning the whole System [of Locke], and consequently towards setting our Philosophy on a new footing'.</page><page sequence="4">42 BERKELEIAN STUDIES IN The two substantial French reviews (my Nos. i and 2) cover the main parts of Berkeley's metaphysic, but they seriously misunderstand it. The reviewers fell for the fallacious subtraction-sum, mentioned above ; they both represent Berkeley as a panpsychist, and in consequence they fail to see that Berkeley's idea of sense is a sensible idea, an idea that can be seen and touched ; they make it a mental copy, and turn Berkeley's idea-thing into an idea-of. Thus the writer in the Journal Liter aire speaks of ' les idees qu'ils ont des choses sensibles'. Bracken deals tenderly with this latter review, and shows it more charity than it deserves ; it is longer than the other, and more detailed ; but it does not take Berkeley seriously as a thinker, and after mentioning the great triad, the Theory of Vision, the Principles, and the Three Dialogues, it says : ' On voit dans tous ces Ouvrages le caractere d'un Auteur plus attache a avancer des Paradoxes &amp; des Sentimens entierement nouveaux, que soigneux d'examiner les sentimens qu'il refute'. The expedition of the book trade in those days is worth noting. In this case editor, reviewer, and printer must have worked at high speed. On May 14, 1713, Percival in Dublin has heard that the Dialogues ' is printed though not yet published '. Add on eleven days for the difference in calendars. The book could hardly have reached the Hague before the end of the month ; and to have a long review of it written and printed and published there in the May-June number meant quick work on the part of all concerned, and it is no wonder that the reviewer's judgments are hasty and confused. At the end of his review the writer lists nine ' con sequences du sentiment de M. B.' These are (translation and numbering mine) : (1) In approaching an object, at every step I take, it is another object I see. (2) When I look at an object through a microscope, I do not see the same object as I perceive without the instrument.</page><page sequence="5">AMERICA AND FRANCE 43 (3) The object I feel is not the same as that I see. (4) The hand that strikes a blow cannot be seen. (5) The stick I use to strike is not the one I hold in my hand. (6) The man who has insulted me is not the same as he whom I bring to court. (7) The man we see hanged on the gallows is not he who committed the robbery. (8) I cannot speak to any one without the intervention of an infinite spirit to arouse in the mind of him to whom I speak, the ideas I wish to excite there. (9) God is obliged to make these characters I write visible to all who shall cast their eyes on this paper. Bracken comments : ' These conclusions indicate how far Berkeley has moved from common sense.' I must dissent from that comment. These consequences, drawn by the French reviewer, only indicate how far he was from understanding Berkeley, and they furnish no evidence, so far as I can see, of Berkeley's alleged departure from common sense. Is Bracken confusing common sense with common speech ? Let us analyse these consequences. Nos. 4 and 5 may be ignored ; they are absurd statements. Berkeley never made them, nor could make them. Much the same applies to Nos. 8 and 9. They are derisive misrepresentations of Berkeley's teaching about God and about ideas. A God, supposed to act intermittently, like a cosmic conjurer, now exciting in my mind and now in your mind an idea of the May-June number (1713) of the Journal Literaire, is certainly not the Eternal Spirit in whom we live and move and have our being ; nor would such an idea, intermittently excited, in my mind or in yours, bear any resemblance to the Berkeleian idea of sense, formally described in the first section of the Principles. When intermittency and anthropomorphic glosses are set aside, no theist will reject</page><page sequence="6">44 BERKELEIAN STUDIES IN Berkeley's principle (Princ. S. 147) that God ' maintains that intercourse between spirits, whereby they are able to perceive the existence of each other'. No careful observer of human communications, of the social bond, and the other bonds of spirit, will think lightly of that principle, and few serious students of the epistemological problem of knowing the other mind will fail to see its significance. The other five ' consequences ' (Nos. 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7) are in a different category. They are all true to fact ; they are all common sense statements ; but, as given here, they do not accord with common speech. With a little patience and ingenuity they could all be expressed, I believe, in such a way that any man of ordinary ability would recognise their truth and common sense. They all turn on the problem of identity ; they exemplify in different ways the one principle that absolute sameness is an ideal, and that the only sameness men meet in them selves or in their environment is very great similarity, indistinguishable similarity, sameness with a difference. Plus c'est la m6me chose, plus 5a change. Berkeley uses this principle, but there is nothing peculiarly Berkeleian in it. All thinkers have to use it at times, when engaged in precision-thinking. It is matter of fact that we men change with every day that passes. It is matter of fact that objects of sense are ever changing. It is matter of fact that no two observers can occupy exactly the same viewpoint at exactly the same moment, and therefore that no two perceivings or percepts can be absolutely identical; but they can be, and often are, practically identical, indistinguishable. Indistinguishable similarity is the only sameness that existents in time and space have a right to expect; for it is the only sameness that existence in time and space allows. The French reviewer has given no valid reason for questioning the common sense of Berkeley's immaterialism. What has misled Bracken on the point is, I think, the natural expectation that common sense will be expressed</page><page sequence="7">AMERICA AND FRANCE 45 in common speech. Berkeley, with his uncanny foresight and dramatic instinct, anticipated almost every possible objection ; and he did so in this particular ; for, impressively claiming (Works, II, p. 244) ' to vindicate common sense ' against novelties ' which shock the genuine uncorrupted judgment of all mankind ', he adds, though ' in doing this, I may perhaps be obliged to use some ambages, and ways of speech not common'. Common speech is not essential to common sense. The crucial point on which, Berkeley claimed, the vulgar and he were right, and the learned of his day wrong, is the real existence of the things we see and touch and otherwise sense. It is common sense that what we see and touch, when we see and touch, is there to see and touch. Berkeley never wavered on that principle, or departed from it by a hair's-breadth ; for reasons that were good in his day, he called the immediate object of sense an idea, and therefore it stands to reason that the Berkeleian idea of sense is a sensible idea. Against the hastily-formed opinion of the French reviewer of 1713 I set the mature judgment of Professor Leroy in his magnificent and central chapter (XI), entitled Les I dees Sensibles, where it is shown conclusively that the sensible idea is the heart of Berkeley's immaterialism. ' Tout compte fait, ce change ment transpose les idees en choses' (p. 152). This transposition is the most obvious case of common speech failing to keep up with common sense. Leroy admits the difficulty caused to the hasty reader, but nowhere, so far as I have observed, does he attribute to Berkeley any wavering or quavering on this cardinal point. Professor Bracken has described as ' distorted ' much of this early criticism that he has brought to light : yet here and in his handling of Baxter's argument (pp. 84-5) he uses it to reinforce his contention, made in his article, ' Berkeley's Realisms', in the Philosophical Quarterly (VIII) last year, that there is some deep-seated inconsistency in Berkeley's teaching. When I began to read Berkeley long ago, I saw ' wobble ' everywhere in him. I know</page><page sequence="8">46 BERKELEIAN STUDIES IN now that the ' wobble ' was in myself. Of course there are minor difficulties of interpretation ; they help to keep the philosophy alive, and we have interpreters to deal with them ; but I have never found any radical inconsistency in Berkeley's account of the world of sense, such as would make his immaterialism unworthy of serious attention. In addition to the supposed common sense and rigorous realisms, with which I have dealt above, Bracken also finds in Berkeley a theistic realism and a non-theistic realism, a realism that takes account of error and a realism that does not. A man cannot say everything all at once, and Berkeley, like other folk, must be allowed his theistic explanations of the facts of life, and his non-theistic explanations. There are six week-days to one Sunday. I wonder would Bracken be so good as to look again at two of his phrases on page 84, (1) ' in avoiding the problem of existence-intermittency', and, (2) ' the real tree existing without [the] mind ..." It is inexact to imply that Berkeley avoids this problem in the passage (Principles, SS. 45-8) to which Bracken refers. It is a hard passage, and I have devoted three pages to its elucidation (pp. 7-9) in my ' Berkeley's doctrine of the Perceivable '3 I there summarize, as follows : ' The mind of God in Berkeley's philosophy guarantees the continued existence of the perceivable over the gaps in human perception. The section concludes with the explicit statement that the three doctrines in question— intermittent existence, annihilation, and continual creation —do not follow from his principles. Berkeley does not formally condemn those doctrines ; he does not enter on the question whether they can be held along with immaterialism ; but he does condemn the attempt to force them on his philosophy as an integral part thereof.' The other passage (No. 2) gave me a severe shock at first sight ; but I find there is a misprint in Bracken. Both Fraser and Jessop have it correctly, ' the real tree 3 Hermathena, No. LX, 1942.</page><page sequence="9">AMERICA AND FRANCE 47 existing without his mind . . If the passage is quoted correctly and in full it does not imply, at least it need not imply (pace Bracken) that the tree that Berkeley and the gardener see is unreal, in the sense of illusory. When Berkeley's doctrine of the perceivable is taken as a whole, and not piece-meal, the realist interpretation of it will be found, I think, reasonably self-consistent. For all practical purposes the tree that you and I see is one and the same ; whether it is also the tree that God sees, is a question which both human modesty and professional pride forbid the philosopher to ask or answer. The worst difficulties, continues Bracken, ' turn up at the end of the Third Dialogue . . . faced with the problems of error and illusion . . . Berkeley is forced to say that things are not really what they appear to common sense to be'. I am sorry if I appear contentious, but I have read the Third Dialogue twice ad hoc with the foregoing state ment before me, and I cannot find any justification for it. On the contrary a dozen times in this dialogue Berkeley asserts the reality of the things immediately perceived by sense ; 4 on the very last page of the dialogue he asserts it, and asserts it as shared by him with the vulgar. Midway through the dialogue (Works, II, p. 244) he puts the same thing negatively with great force, ' That the qualities we perceive, are not on the objects : that we must not believe our senses ; that we know nothing of the real nature of things . . . that real colours and sounds are nothing but certain unknown figures and motions . . . And it is against these and the like innovations, I endeavour to vindicate common sense'. There is very little about error and illusion in this dialogue, or, if memory serves me, anywhere in his writings. Berkeley is too positive a thinker to waste time on negations. * Works, II, pp. 227, 229, 234, 237, 238, 244, 246, 249, 251, 256, 258, 262.</page><page sequence="10">48 BERKELEIAN STUDIES IN The greatest error is to reify error, and Berkeley never makes that mistake. Illusory perception is not perception of the illusory ; it is non-perception, or, if you prefer to put it so, it is a mistaken perception, a perception of something else. We cannot see what is not there. We may make mistakes about what we see. We may be in doubt as to whether or not we are seeing. We are all liable to make mistakes about subject and about object. We are fallible men, learners ; none the less, what we really see, when we really see, is there to see ; and what is not there to see, cannot be seen. With Berkeley : ' I am sure nothing cannot be seen . . . ' (ib., p. 249). That is the gist of what Berkeley says (ib. pp., 238, 258) about the stock cases of illusion, the oar dipped in water, etc. There is no bent, straight oar ; it cannot be seen, and is not seen ; and if you say you see it, you are making a mistake, and saying what is not. The visible outline of the oar dipped in water, is bent, and we see it bent ; but we must not make wrong inferences ; if we take the oar out of the water, that crookedness vanishes ; it is common sense that oar-in-air and oar-cum-water are different objects of vision, though to say so may not accord with common speech.5 I venture to hope that Bracken will see his way to bevel the sharp edges of his theory. He has served Berkeleian scholarship well in his researches ; but the value of that scholarship would be seriously reduced, and its very existence imperilled, if his thesis of the two radically inconsistent Berkeleys were admitted. 5 Leroy (p. 154) writes to the same effect : ' Berkeley revient sans cesse sur ce thfeme pour triompher d'une contrefagon de science. C'est que, sans cesse aussi, il est amene a proposer des assertions que les faits paraissent contredire. II faut d'abord montrer que les illusions des sens, toujours invoquees contre leur veracity, n'ont aucune valeur probante ; l'erreur ne se trouve jamais que dans les inferences que nous portons a partir de sensations, qui sont riSellement presentes &amp; riotre esprit ; tel est le cas de la rame plongee dans l'eau, ou celui des transformations des sensations par la vision microscopique.'</page><page sequence="11">AMERICA AND FRANCE 49 ' Lisons-le done pour lui-meme ; il se replacera bien dans son milieu, puisqu'il est un polemiste ardent.' This, from his Avant-propos (p. 17), gives the spirit of Professor Leroy's study. Mentioning the interpretations, found in Berkeley or read into him, by Pfaff, Wolff, Kant, Fraser, Rossi, Wisdom, Gueroult and others, Leroy bids us read Berkeley for ourselves, and find out for ourselves whether his philosophy is one or many, realist or idealist (ideist). Those who read under Leroy's wise guidance will have little difficulty in concluding that Berkeley rejected subjective idealism and other forms of philosophical idealism, and taught a reasonably consistent realism of sense and spirit in his brilliant youth, and remained true to it for life. Leroy is already well-known to British philosophers for his studies in English classical philosophy (with Leroux), for his texts and translations of Berkeley and Hume, and for his David Hume in the same series as the present work (Les Grands Penseurs, Collection dirigee par P.-M. Schuhl). He knows the highways and the byways of British thought in the eighteenth century, and there can be few details of modern Berkeleian scholarship that have escaped his eagle eye. For frontispiece the book has a fine reproduction of Vanderbank's portrait of Berkeley in episcopal robes, which appears to have survived only in the engraving made by W. Skelton. The left half of the picture shows the ' broken cistern ' motif, adapted from the frontispiece of Alciphron.6 Leroy's method is not easy to describe briefly ; he appears to have touched on almost all the books, even the minor ones, that Berkeley published ; but he takes little account of their time-order. There are chapters on Berkeley's ethics, aesthetics, and economics ; but his metaphysics forms the centre of the picture. The 6 See discussion of No. 6 in Iconography, appended to my Life, of George Berkeley. D</page><page sequence="12">50 BERKELEIAN STUDIES IN immaterialism of a thinker who fully believed in the world of sense gradually comes to light in these pages. Berkeley explains that world as composed of meaningful entities, non-mental but symbolic, not mind but for the mind, like letters of the alphabet. Those entities Berkeley calls ideas, carefully explaining his usage, and doing his best to guard it from misunderstanding. There was no other term of precision in his day which could convey his meaning. In considering the relation of the sensible idea to spirit, we are, says Leroy, ' au centre meme de berkeleyisme, et nous touchons a la fois a la nature de l'esprit humain, a la nature de Dieu, et a la signification de la Genese ' (p. 158). From that central position we see that the human spirit and the sensible idea-thing cannot exist the one without the other, hie et nunc, and yet that they are in large measure independent of one another (p. 157). This feature Leroy terms ' bipolarite Leroy has reached that clear and trenchant statement of Berkeley's position by a close study, heavily documented, of Berkeley's writings. He has given special weight to the Philosophical Commentaries ; and he has studied those notebooks carefully and has used them with discrimination; he has watched and allowed for the development of thought within those notebooks ; and he has not fallen into the trap of taking from them some provisional statement or discarded hypothesis, as if it were Berkeley's final word. Time, duration, eternity, space, the various spaces, the infinitely divisible, the minimum sensibile, motion, unity, essence, abstract ideas, language and demonstration— Leroy takes the reader through Berkeley's views on all these topics, expressed in his Commentaries and in his publications, before permitting us to stand back from the detail, and grasp Berkeley's immaterialism as a whole. It is heavy going at time ; but it is the effective cure for that lop-sidedness and superficiality that mark some expositions of Berkeley's philosophy. Special praise is due to Chapter X on the act of signification which immediately precedes the account of</page><page sequence="13">AMERICA AND FRANCE 51 the world of sense. The juxtaposition is a masterly stroke ; for, in Leroy's words (p. 129), ' sans la doctrine des signes, rimmaterialisme ne peut se constituer'. When we realise what signs are, the phrase ' visual language' becomes luminous, and when we learn that language and can read it, even haltingly, and can look out on the visible world as readers look at a book, then, and not till then, can we fully enter into a metaphysic, which, in Leroy's great phrase, ' etablit le surnaturel au coeur du naturel.' Any commentary on Berkeley's doctrine of spirit is bound to disappoint ; for Berkeley suggests so much about spirit and works out so little. Leroy has a useful discussion of the terms employed, mind, spirit, soul, and myself; but I think he reads too much into the collocation, when he treats them as necessarily synonyms. I can apply truths about spirit to myself, without leaving myself open to the charges of psychologism, subjectivism, or Cartesian egoism. It is interesting to learn that the French language has no exact equivalent of our word mind. Causality comes up for some discussion under ' rerum natura ' or the system of nature, and again as part of the argument for the existence of God ; but a fuller treatment would have been desirable ; it is idle to exorcise matter, if we allow it back in the guise of material cause. The causa significans, too, is a key concept in Berkeley's system, rather neglected by Leroy ; it is the basis of the order and connexion between ideas which is ' like to that of cause and effect ' (Princ. S. 64). The combination of active and passive in the human spirit is a big problem that Berkeley never tackled systematically, unless he did so in his draft ' Part II ' of the Principles, lost in the Sicilian seas. Essentially it is the same problem that we all feel in ourselves ; we know that we are mind and body, and that the constituent elements are distinct and often opposed ; and yet in a given case it is often hard to draw the dividing line. One aspect of this difficulty is dealt with by our author when he asks (p. 162), How can an active being, like spirit, be passive when it understands and perceives ? Hitherto I have</page><page sequence="14">52 BERKELEIAN STUDIES IN seen the answer in Lloyd Morgan's distinction between the -ing and the -ed, and I am not convinced yet that that answer is wrong or inadequate. Our perceiving the rose is active : the rose percent is passive. Leroy has a deeper and more complex answer (p. 164) which calls for careful thought. If I understand him aright, his explanation is that in perception the perceiver's activity is temporarily opposed, negated, and immobilized, by the more powerful Spirit who gives us the passive percept. On this account not only the rose seen, but also our seeing of it, would be passive. This theory accounts well for the sense of control, constraint and givenness that we experience when we open our eyes in daylight. We certainly do not make what we see ; but are we made to see, as Leroy's theory implies ? I am not so sure. Is an arrested activity eo ipso passive ? I doubt it. The camera is purely passive when its shutter snaps and takes a photograph ; but the camera cannot see ; it is as blind as a bat, blinder. My eye can see, and when it does see something, surely it is seeing still, actively find ing its given object, as the red setter dog, immobile as a statue from quivering nostrils to tip of tense tail, actively finds and winds the passive snipe. The matter requires careful thought and further sifting ; on the one hand, with Leroy we must hold that the Infinite Spirit gives us to see ; on the other hand, there are grave dangers in granting a passive perception other than a passive percept ; the tertium quid may creep back into our perceptual theories ; and are we not breaking down the all-important bridge between our sense-perceiving and our higher faculties of mind, if we make perception purely passive ? It is true that the making and unmaking of ideas of the imagination ' doth very properly denominate the mind active ' (Princ. S. 28) ; but hard and fast distinctions almost always break down in concrete cases ; and Berkeley's phrase ' not imagining but seeing after a sort ' (Phil. Comm. No. 294), and his qualified distinctions {Princ. S. 30) indicate that, for him, a distinction between sense and imagination is one thing, and a clean cut another.</page><page sequence="15">AMERICA AND FRANCE 53 Leroy gives thorough and appreciative accounts of Berkeley's theology and proofs of the existence of God and finite spirit, stressing his true piety, and knowledge of Holy Scripture. In an interesting footnote (p. 208) he suggests that the Berkeleian ' proof ' is a development of St. Paul's affirmation in his epistle to the Romans, I, 19-21. The book concludes with a chapter which sketches in bold strokes the fortunes of Berkeleian immaterialism down to the present day, noting the appreciations, mis understandings, and mistaken interpretations of Samuel Johnson of America, of Voltaire and Condillac, of Kant, Maupertius, Schopenhauer, and Peirce, and culminating in a fine and just estimate of the spiritual affinity between Berkeley and Bergson. Leroy's George Berkeley is comprehensive ; perhaps it attempts to convey too much in too few pages ; in places the account is thin ; but these are venial faults, more than offset by the author's wealth of knowledge, accuracy, clarity of expression, and flair for essentials. I know no commentator in any language who has captured in all essentials the historic Berkeley, the man and his philosophy, more surely, or who has set forth the positive aspect of his immaterialism with more fidelity and fullness.

From Doggerell's School, Kilkenny, he entered College in 1717 ; B.A. 1721 ; Fellow 1724; Rector of Miclleton, 1741-1787. The battle of Ahnanzar was fought on 25 April (N. S.), 1707. The French army, led by the Duke of Berwick, routed the English under the Earl of Galway, and the Portugese. Berwick claimed the capture of 10,000 men.
