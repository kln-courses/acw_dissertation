John F. Haught, Georgetown University The relationship between Christianity and the environmen- tal movement is one of the most curious cultural develop- ments to have occurred during the last quarter century. It is also one of the most important, since what is at stake in this sometimes tempestuous but increasingly amicable affair is nothing less than the survival of the planet. And since the ecological crisis promises to be a dominant public issue during the next hundred years, the past two and a half decades of exchange between Christians and environmen- talists may eventually be seen as a major transitional epoch in the history of Christianity and perhaps the planet as well. Surveys such as the one undertaken in this book will provide helpful information to future scholars who may wish to learn about the often-confusing early days of the greening of religion now occurring in many regions of the globe. Robert Booth Fowler, who has previously published extensively in the area of religion and politics, provides here a lively, if at times somewhat ragged, chronicle of the transformations now taking place in many branches of 404 Protestantism as a result of the latter's encounter with recently emergent ecological sensitivity. While Fowler thinks that Protestants need to become much more philo- sophically rigorous and politically expert in their association with environmentalists, he is quite tolerant of the ferment and confusion that now accompanies the greening of Prot- estant thought and life. He has no strong argument to make, being content mainly to describe the wide variety of Protestant approaches to environmentalism. He does be- lieve, however, that Protestant Christianity, even with all the internal disputes among fundamentalists, evangelicals, and liberals over the meaning and value of nature, can make a serious contribution to our common human striving for ecological responsibility. Even though environmental Protestantism is often "derivative and analytically soft," it conveys a promise and hope that is sorely lacking in its secular counterpart. Generally speaking, the book is an informative primer, and the hopeful spirit that pervades it will prove inspira- tional to many readers. The author has dipped into an enormously wide range of writings on Christian faith and ecology. The breadth of his scholarship is impressive, and the bibliography he provides is voluminous. Unfortunately, however, the book is blemished by a number of inaccuracies and caricatures of theological posi- tions. Though Fowler may have expertise in the area of religion and politics, he is much less skilled in presenting the nuances of theology. A major point of confusion is the arbitrary labeling as "Protestant" of several very influential religious ecologists who are quite distinctively Roman Cath- olic. Although it may be the case that Thomas Berry, a Passionist priest, and Matthew Fox, a former Dominican, have had some influence on Protestant environmentalists, they would be surprised at how facilely Fowler has assimi- lated them into the Protestant communion. Such conflation, however, is only symptomatic of a much deeper limitation in Fowler's presentation. He writes about the greening of Protestant thought almost as though it has made no signif- icant contact with Catholic environmental theology. For example, he treats the Protestant flirtation with creation- centered theology (which he carelessly misnames "creation theology") without even mentioning the obviously Roman Catholic roots of this controversial theological vision. Un- initiated readers are given the false impression that cre- ation-centered ecological theology is an indigenously Prot- estant development. In fact, creation-centered theology and ecological spirituality emerged from a tradition that high- lights the intrinsic goodness and sacramental character of nature much more explicitly than Protestantism has done. Fowler does not seem to have noticed the deep irony of associating some of the most Catholic and sacramental ecological thought of our time with "Protestant" environ- mentalism. In view of the actual cross-fertilization involving a wide variety of current Christian ecological theologies, the book's attempt to focus so exclusively on Protestant envi- ronmentalism appears rather contrived. An abundance of lesser but still annoying defects also tarnish Fowler's otherwise resourceful treatment. When referring to the accusation by environmentalists that too much focus on humans drains value from the rest of nature, he uses the term "anthropomorphic" when he means "anthropocentric." And on a more serious note, he curi- ously insists that creation-centered theology is antiscience, even though its major proponent, Thomas Berry, has teamed up with physicist Brian Swimme to write The Universe Story, and contemporary astrophysics has thor-</page><page sequence="2">American Political Science Review Vol. 90, No. 2 oughly infiltrated much ecological writings about creation today. In addition, the summaries of Teilhard de Chardin and process theology are disappointingly inexact. Fowler ac- knowledges the ecological promise in Alfred North White- head's organismic philosophy of nature, but he uncritically embraces shallow conservative Christian judgments about process thought. No matter how defective process thought may be, it does not help to suggest, for example, that the pan-en-theistic ideas of Charles Hartshorne (who inciden- tally is not a "theologian") are a form of pantheism, when in fact he and other process philosophers consistently and emphatically reject any Spinozist idea that God and the world are the same. Furthermore, it is erroneous to say that process thought ignores evil. For in Adventures of Ideas and other works Whitehead considerably expands our understanding of evil, which he insists, is a term applicable not only to instances of discord or chaos, but also to unnecessary triviality. In a processive universe that has reached the human phase of its evolution, our clinging to listless order and superficial harmony (especially in political and religious life), when it is relevant to move toward richer and more adventurous syntheses, may also be called "evil," the evil of monotony. We need redemption from the latter, Whitehead argues, as much as from the former. In spite of many such imperfections, however, Fowler's book deserves to be read. It is especially insightful in addressing the problem of how to translate environmental Christianity into effective action where it can make a real difference to the planet and its future. Unless such transla- tion occurs, there is little point in any ecological reflection, religious or otherwise.</page></plain_text>
