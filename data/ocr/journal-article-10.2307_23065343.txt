<plain_text><page sequence="1">6 Trick or Treat? On Collective Epiphanies in Antiquity FRITZ GRAF I. Introduction This contribution grew out of a question by one of my graduate students. An intriguing inscription that narrates the introduction of the Bacchic cult in Magnesia on the Maeander begins its story with a storm that tore down a tree in which the Magnesians found a statue of Dionysus. The remarkable find triggered the usual process of oracular response and introduction of a new cult.1 At some point in our discussion of this text, a student refused to accept the traditional explanation that we are dealing with a fictional account invented long after the events it narrated in order to explain why the cult centered on an old-fashioned statuette of the god.2 Something, my student argued, must have really happened to make the assembly of Magnesia send an embassy to Apollo's oracle. And since we do not believe in miracles, he assumed that someone had conveniently planted an old image in a blown-over tree. My first reaction was incredulity: Voltaire and priestly deception, Priestertrug, all over again? But if that is not the correct answer, is literary fiction the only way out? Opinions are divided in the case of the Magnesia cult.3 The inscription, a large marble slab, was dedicated to Dionysos in the second century C.E. by a functionary of the cult and tells the story of how the Maenadic cult of Magnesia was founded. It consists of the text of a decree of the assembly dated by the prytanis (an office that was abolished about 250 B.C.E.), Apollo's oracle that ordered the foundation of the cult, the further history until the death of the founding maenads, and the postscript of the priest of Dionysus who dedicated the ensemble. It has been argued that both decree 1 Kern 1900: n. 215. Henrichs 1978: 123-37 is still the best discussion; he correctly dates the inscription to the middle of the second century C.E. 2 Such statues and statuettes had a special place in worship; see the examples collected in Graf2001: 237-40. 3 Fontenrose 1978: 409-10, n.

The oracle is firmly dated by an allusion to the Gallic attack on Delphi in which Magnesian troops helped defend the sanctuary.7 It might well be genuine—which does not make it easier to understand what has been going on. When moving from miracles such as this to epiphany, things become even more problematical. What the Greeks call tuicfxxveio: is omnipresent in ancient societies; at least in the Hellenistic epoch, helpful divinities (or divine rulers) began to earn more and more often the epithet ercupavfiq, "appearing (as a savior)"; this epiclesis often replaced the more common term ocoT^p/offlTEtpa. The fame of the gods was founded on their epiphanies, the "manifestations of their divine existence and power" (as one could paraphrase the term). In the third century B.C.E., one Syriscus, a local historian of Tauric Chersonese, earned the commendation of his city (and a gold crown) for "having read the eutcpdveiai of the Parthenos that he diligently had written."8 The Parthenos was the local patron deity of the city in whose praise Syriscus wrote and recited. The Lindian Chronicle, written in 99 B.C.E., duly noted all eirup&amp;veiai of Athena over the many centuries since the foundation of the temple.9 In the second century C.E., Alexandra, the priestess of Demeter Thesmophoria in Didyma, asked the god for advice: there had been no epiphanies by the divinities at all since she entered office, neither through women and virgins nor through males and children: was this a thing to worry about? Was she doing something wrong?10 4Fontenrose 1978:409-10, n.

Did Greeks and Romans believe in Epiphanies? To the Greek and Roman mind, epiphanies were real, and they were vital. Gods were irrelevant if they could not manifest themselves to humans.11 This manifestation could take the form of an invisible guidance of human events, through a master plan such as Homer's Aioq pouMj, or through punishment and help, when they were appropriate: humans sensed a god's hand behind such an event. However, this intervention often led to a visible appearance that took the form of a sign or a dream (both sometimes needed further interpretation), or to an appearance in clear visibility during daytime. When they appeared in their bodily form, the gods were evapyeu; ("clearly visible, manifest"), but already Homer cautioned that "the gods do not appear clearly visible to all humans."12 The Greek term eiucpavsux covers all such manifestations, and often enough it means "miracle" rather than what we conventionally have termed "epiphany." It should be born in mind that our modern and scholarly term "epiphany"—that is, the physical appearance of a divinity in an anthropomorphic form—is narrower than the Greek term, except in some late attestations.13 There has even been a debate as to whether the Greeks thought of gods manifesting themselves visibly and in broad daylight. In 1971, Dieter Luhrmann wanted to exclude all physical anthropomorphic manifestations from the semantic range of eiucp&amp;veta and make the word into something approaching a synonym of apsrr], "miracle." Henk Versnel correctly argued against this thesis. There are certain, albeit late, attestations of the term in its modern sense.14 And there certainly was the belief that humans could meet gods who were in visible bodily form, expressed since the Homeric epic where Hera reminds the other gods that "gods who appear fully visible (evapyetc) are difficult to bear" for humans.15 Nevertheless, such appearances were widespread, and were widely believed, however strange that may seem to us. They were recorded especially, but not exclusively, in times of crisis where they explained who among the gods or heroes had helped in a seemingly desperate situation and '1 See the defense of divine interventions (emcpdveiai) against "atheist philosophies" in Dion. Hal., Ant. Rom. 2. 68. 12 Horn., Od. 16. 161-62: Telemachus does not see Athena, but "Odysseus and the dogs did see her." 13 See Cancik 1990: 290, who rightly warns of projecting modern ideas on the ancient term: "Seine gelegentliche Aufwertung zu einem Zentralbegriff sei es der griechischen, sei es der Religionsgeschichte uberhaupt erweckt schon deshalb Bedenken" (because its narrow meaning is attested only in later Greek). 14 The most important contributions to the debate: Pfister 1924; Ltihrmann 1971; Versnel 1987:43. See also Cancik 1990 (preceding note). 15Hom.,//. 10.131.</page><page sequence="4">114 Illinois Classical Studies 29 (2004) therefore deserved the recognition of humans. Epiphanies were the reason for new rituals—such as the Delphic Soteria, to commemorate the epiphany of Apollo and his helpers against the Gauls, and new cults—as in Chersonesos. They were the main title to glory for a local divinity; such a divinity could even become CTKpavsoxdTT], like Hecate in Anatolia. Not even philosophers questioned them—not only late antique philosophers like Iamblichus or the sophist Aelian who wrote lis pi GsicQv evapye'iwv (On Divine Manifestations).16 Balbus, the Stoic in Cicero's De Natura Deorum, gives a long catalogue of divine epiphanies in order to prove his point that cult "does not arise by chance and randomly, but because the gods often make visible their power through their presence."17 Epicurus, whom the same Balbus accuses of many errors, firmly agreed with this; after all, in his materialistic psychology, visions and epiphanies most plausibly explained why humans believed in gods. It is, however, by no means the prerogative of post-enlightenment scholarship to cast doubt on the seriousness of all this and to explain it either as "later embroidery" or simple deception. The same Cicero could decry as fiction the notion that "some god, coming down from the sky, mingles with human crowds, dwells on earth and talks to humans." The gods would give signs; they would not appear in person.18 This is no new position: with a somewhat different twist, Euthydemos in Xenophon's Memorabilia insisted that "you do not wait until you see the shapes of the gods; it is enough to venerate and honor them when you see their works."19 But there are not only these voices that question the need of the gods to show themselves bodily in order to receive cult. Already the Greeks explained divine epiphanies by trickery. "They devised between them what seems to me the silliest trick which history has to record ... It was at the Athenians' expense that this trick was played." The words are famous: they are Herodotus', expressing his surprised indignation at the way Pisistratus contrived his return with the help of "a handsome woman, nearly six feet tall"—poor Phye transformed into an impressive Athena.20 And it is not the only story, merely the most notorious faked epiphany, at least in Herodotus' reading. Nearly as notorious is the story of Alexander of Abonuteichos' 16 Perhaps an alternative title of his On Providence; see Bowie and Strehl, 1996. 17 Cic., Nat. D. 2. 6: Itaque el in nostro populo el in ceteris deorum cultus religionumque sanctitates exislunt in dies maiores atque meliores; idque evenit non temere nec casu, sed quod et praesentes (= Greek enupaveXi;) saepe di vim suam declarant. 18 Cic., Har. resp. 62: nolite enim id putare accidere posse quod in fabulis saepe videlis fieri, ut deus aliqui delapsus de caelo coetus hominum adeat, versetur in terris, cum hominibus conloquatur. 19 Xen., Mem. 4. 3. 13: av (if) avanlvTK, e&lt;o? a" tac tiop^aq t&lt;3v Q(wv i5i^g, aXJ.' ei;apKr) aoi ta Ipya autcoi/ opuvu aepeaGai.

For example, when the Aetolians in 241 B.C.E. attacked and besieged Pellene, they saw a stately woman in arms appear on the city walls. In panic, they turned round and went home again. Plutarch records two accounts, one given by the attackers who saw the apparition, and one given by the defenders who said they carried the image of the goddess around the city walls.22 Polyaenus knows a third variant which puts the emphasis on the credulity of the attackers and not on the power of the local goddess: the priestess of Athena in full armor had come out of her temple and was mistaken for the goddess.23 III. Epiphanies Narrated by Herodotus This does not, however, necessarily mean that Herodotus, to come back to him, generally distrusts stories of epiphanies, as some scholars thought.24 In his narrative of the Persian Wars, he refers to four instances of divine manifestation. This is a smaller number than later authors (i.e. Plutarch or Pausanias) give, but it is more than one would expect in the writings of someone who, on the whole, did not believe in such manifestations. The best-known epiphany in Herodotus' narrative of the Wars is the appearance of Pan to the Athenian long-distance runner Phidippides; it led to the establishment of the Athenian cult of the Arcadian god.25 On his trip from Athens to Sparta before the battle of Marathon, Phidippides met the god near Mount Parthenios, above Tegea. Phidippides is alone, and he hears the god's voice, without ever seeing him. Still, for Herodotus, this is an apparition (cpavrivai). His source is Phidippides' report to the Athenians, as he makes perfectly clear: he knows the story "as he [Phidippides] told himself and reported back to the Athenians." Herodotus might have read this in the preamble of a decree of the Athenian assembly that established a cult, or from people who had participated in that assembly as young men. At any rate, when the historian speaks about the cult of Pan founded by the Athenians on the slope of the Acropolis, he remarks that "they were 21 The trick is in Lucian, Alex. 15; the documents that show the cult's afterlife are in Robert 1980:393-436. 22 Plut., Viit. Aral. 32. 23 Polyaenus, Strat. 8. 59. 24 Harrison 2000: 82-92 gives a sensible account with the earlier bibliography. 25 Hdt. 6. 105-6. Later texts: Paus. 8. 54. 6 (the Athenians and the Tegeans confirm the story); Suda, s.v. Hippias. The best account is still Borgeaud 1979.</page><page sequence="6">116 Illinois Classical Studies 29 (2004) confident that he told the truth." This means that Herodotus saw a problem if not of truth, then of attestation: the only person to whom the god had appeared was Phidippides himself, and there was no independent corroboration for it—the best he could do is to point out that the Athenians had no doubts whatsoever. Much later, Pausanias adds that the Tegeans told the same story, which corroborates Phidippides' account.26 During the battle of Marathon, another epiphany occurred, but on the wrong side, so to speak. The Athenian Epizelus, a very brave fighter, suddenly saw "a giant hoplite, whose beard covered his entire shield" coming towards him. The apparition (cpaa|ia) killed the man next in line, sparing him, but making him blind for the rest of his life. The story is somewhat enigmatic, and Herodotus again makes clear that he obtained it from hearsay: Epizelus was the only person (except perhaps the man killed by the apparition) to have seen it.27 A third epiphany is the only epiphany during the Persian wars which, as the historian tells it, had a collective body of witnesses—the entire Greek army. Before the battle of Salamis, the entire army heard the voice of the apparition (cpaaj-ia) of a woman reproaching them for backing away from the Persians.28 Herodotus again makes clear his sources: it is one among other stories (Xoyoi). His account begins with the phrase Myezai 5k icai TaSe, "there is also the following account." It is the last of three accounts of how the battle of Salamis started (besides this one there is an Athenian and an Aeginetan account). Except for the oral transmission, there is no independent corroboration; the woman has no name, and the event did not start a cult. Despite the fact that the entire army heard it, Herodotus is not sure whether he really should believe it. The account at 8. 36-39 is perhaps the most interesting. When the Persians threatened Delphi, the god reassured the Delphians that they should save themselves; he could look out for himself. And this he did; lightning and a huge landslide hit the barbarians and drove them away. But there was more. Not only did the sacred weapons move by themselves (witnessed by the prophet of Apollo), the Persians heard shouts and cries from inside the sanctuary of Athena Pronaia, and, as the survivors told later, they were attacked by "two hoplites, larger than human nature." The Delphians identified them as two local heroes, Phylacus and Autonous.29 The combination of different superhuman interventions and their attestation is illuminating. There were natural phenomena, storm and landslides 26 Paus. 8. 54. 6, see also 1.28.4 (the Athenian account only). 27 Hdt.6.117. 28 Hdt. 8. 84. 29 Hdt. 8.36-39.</page><page sequence="7">Fritz Graf 117 witnessed by everyone: "the stones that fell down from Parnassus are still visible."30 There was the miracle of the weapons that moved by themselves: they were witnessed by one man only, the prophet. There were the shouts and the two heroes, witnessed by the enemies who later told the story. Although Herodotus does not show any skepticism, he is very careful in naming the different groups of witnesses. Other natural phenomena were read as divine manifestations. After having told how a sudden storm destroyed a large part of the Persian fleet in the region of Athos in 480 B.C.E., Herodotus adds that the Athenians narrate that this was the work of Boreas, whom they had called for help—after all, Boreas had married Oreithyia, the daughter of Erechtheus. After the war, the Athenians built him a sanctuary at the Illissus. Thus, the story is not very different from the Phidippides account: the Athenians explained their good fortune by the intervention of a god. But this time, the god manifested himself in his natural form, a gale, in what we are used to calling a personification.31 The other story is even further away from epiphany in our sense. It is the report of one Dicaeus, son of Theocydes of Athens, of how he and the former Spartan king Demaratus saw a cloud rising from the Thriasian plain. They also heard a mighty chorus shout the ritual cry, the iacchos. They understood that this was the procession of the initiates to Eleusis—only because of the war there was no real procession taking place, so it must have been a divine sign.32 There is again the problem of witnesses: Dicaeus enjoined utter silence upon Demaratus,33 so the ultimate source of the story must have been the Athenian's account alone. Thus, superhuman appearances are a problematical topic for Herodotus. One appearance is rigged and staged, as Herodotus insists; two are backed by the institution of a cult, those of Pan and Boreas. The latter, however, has no epiphany in the modern sense. It is the explanation, in religious terms, of why an unexpected gale destroyed a large part of the Persian fleet. This leaves us with Pan—and there, as Herodotus is fully aware, he has only Phidippides' word for it. We seem to move on shaky ground. The other two collective epiphanies are at least as shaky. The sign of the Eleusinian cloud—again no epiphany in the modern sense, but a sign of divine assistance—rests on the information of Dicaeus alone, since the second witness never came forward, while the appearance of the Delphian heroes was witnessed only by the shocked Persians. This leaves the Woman of Salamis, the only epiphany in the modern sense of the term for which 30 Hdt. 8.39. 31 Hdt. 7. 189. 32 Hdt. 8.65. Mai. 6. o;&gt;. 33 "Don't tell this story to anybody else," even if he is mainly concerned that Xerxes should not hear it, Hdt. 8. 65.</page><page sequence="8">118 Illinois Classical Studies 29 (2004) there is an entire army of witnesses. But it contradicts two other accounts of how the battle started, and Herodotus seems skeptical, although he withholds his own opinion. We are left with the somewhat disconcerting result that the one epiphany that occurred to one isolated individual in the mountains of Arcadia seems to Herodotus the most trustworthy one. But we also are squarely confronted with the more fundamental problem: collective epiphanies, to judge from Herodotus' sample, are suspect or poorly attested, and individual ones have to rely on the testimony of that one individual person. This is remarkable. After all, we are dealing with a religious system that assumed the interference of gods and heroes in human life, including bodily apparition, as a sign for the existence of these powers and as a validating device for specific cults. In order to understand better how this device worked, it seems worthwhile to make a clear distinction between individual and collective epiphanies, and to see what we learn about their attestation. Individual epiphanies, after all, present an inherent problem of verification, since one has to rely on the testimony of one person; collective epiphanies should be more promising, since several witnesses could corroborate each other's statements. IV. Collective Epiphanies: Evidence from Inscriptions Let us, then, look at collective epiphanies, trying to find first-hand reports of epiphanies that appear to a large group and do not seem fictitious. This excludes most literary texts, but inscriptions may be more promising, if they speak about an immediate past, not a past long ago—a past, that is, of which a controlling memory may be suspected in the group. A good case in point is the list of the eirupavEiai of Zeus Panamaros from his sanctuary near Stratonicea in Caria, recorded in an official decree dated to the invasion of Labienus in 40 B.C.E. All the epiphanies occurred shortly before then.34 The text is rather fragmentary, but the main points are clear. The story begins with a nocturnal attack of an army, presumably the Roman army, "with machinery and artillery and all the other equipment." The people of Stratonicea, who were performing a festival in the outlying sanctuary—we hear of women and children—were taken by surprise. But the god immediately stepped in and hurled thunderbolts at them, burned large parts of their equipment and made them run away. The following day the enemy attacked again. This time, the god covered the defenders with dense fog, making them difficult to attack. When the enemy did not give 34 §ahin 1981: 10-12,n. 10.</page><page sequence="9">Fritz Graf 119 up, the god sent a rainstorm with impressive thunder and lightning. A panic ensued, one heard the first shouts of "Great is Zeus Panamaros!" Some attackers gave up, others killed the deserters, yet others "rushed away into the mountains, as if chased by Erinyes," while the defenders did not suffer a single casualty. When, a few days later, fresh troops arrived and closed the ring around the sanctuary, one heard shouting (aXcday|i6q)35 and howling as if of dogs; the attackers, unnerved, jumped from their ladders, ran off and barely made it back to their camp. And during all this time, the lamps in the temple had continued to burn: the god was visibly present. With the attackers again running away and losing their way in the tricky mountains of central Caria, the preserved part of the text ends. The result is obvious. The text uses cognates of (paiveoGai several times,36 but never in the sense of an anthropomorphic appearance of the god. The first signs are pure meteorological apparitions, typically ascribed to Zeus the Weather-god: nocturnal lightning, dense fog, a very impressive and particularly damaging rainstorm. But the defenders are all too willing to read this in the light of their religious expectations, and so do the attackers after a while, being as susceptible to this as the defenders. Armies can panic, as Caesar realized near Vesontio.37 The Carians and the attacking troops (were they Roman legionaries or auxiliaries drawn from the region and thus conditioned to the same response as the defenders?) acted in the same way as the Athenians when a northerly gale destroyed the Persian fleet: they assumed the intervention of a divine agent, and they could give a good reason for this. And once the stage was set for these expectations, the spectrum of signs could widen and embrace things that went beyond the interpretation of meteorological phenomena, superhuman shouts and howlings, or a temple lamp that burned through the entire siege, signaling that the divinity never abandoned his temple. There might have been a wind roaring in the trees, and perhaps wolves howling in the woods (there were still wolves in Caria in the mid-twentieth century), but we might not even need such a materialistic solution. The time was ripe to transform rumors and anxieties into certainties. Thus, when talking about an immediate experience, the presence of the divinity was experienced indirectly, taking the form of signs that more or less needed interpretation. Zeus did not become bodily visible. We can 35 The same term is used by Hdt. 8. 37 in his account of the Persian attack on Delphi, to describe the shouts heard from the sanctuary of Athena Pronaia; the term, however, is not very specific. 36 Unfortunately, the key term in the introduction (nsydXa^ fni&lt;pav£i&lt;; €vf|pytiaev ei/epysiai;) is restored, with a rather high decree of probability, but not certainty; the end, where the text might again have conceptualized the theology behind the narration, is lost. 37 Caes., B Gall. 1.39.</page><page sequence="10">120 Illinois Classical Studies 29 (2004) cross-check this result, since there are inscriptions that relate collective epiphanies that happened in a more or less remote past, and inscriptions that talk about an individual's epiphany. In 99 B.C.E., the authorities of the sanctuary of Athena Lindia had a long text drawn up that related the story of the cult through its main dedications and manifestations of the goddess. The first epiphany that is completely preserved concerns the siege of Lindus by the fleet of King Darius I in 490 B.C.E. The sanctuary is built on a rather barren rock, water thus soon became a problem for the besieged. When the Lindians debated whether they should surrender, one of the archontes came forward and announced that the goddess had manifested herself to him in a dream and promised help: "She would herself intercede with her father for the water." Trusting her (at least in part), the Lindians arranged with the fleet commander, Darius' admiral Datis, that they would surrender in five days, the time they reckoned their water would last, if Athena did not fulfill her promise. The Persian admiral was highly amused about the condition, but not for long. The next day, a black cloud gathered over the city and torrential rain filled the reservoirs. Impressed by this divine manifestation (eiTup&amp;veia), Datis lifted the siege, made a peace treaty and offered his personal ornaments as dedications in the temple.38 Epiphany thus takes again the form of help of the goddess and manifests itself in a meteorological event; it was preceded by a promise from the tutelary goddess that shaped the later perception of the rainstorm. The goddess did not manifest herself bodily, at least not to the Lindians as a group, she only appeared to an official in a dream. The same mechanism worked in the two later epiphanies that are preserved. They were both dream apparitions to her priest, in one case six times during six consecutive nights to a particularly stubborn and skeptical priest. Another historical epiphany concerned Delphi. When, in the winter of 279 B.C.E., a band of Gauls attacked the sanctuary with the clear intent of plundering it, the Delphians and their allies succeeded in defeating and driving them away. The defenders were greatly helped by a devastating snowstorm. The event is recorded in several inscriptions in which Greek cities accepted the summons of Delphi to a newly founded festival to commemorate the victory, the Soteria, and in several literary texts of later date. The oldest inscription is from Cos, and is almost contemporaneous to the event. The Coan inscription simply mentions that "the attackers were severely punished by the god," and that the festival was announced "because of the epiphany."39 Whatever happened (it might not have been 38 Blinkenberg 1915: 34 D2-47. 39 SIG3 n. 398 (278 B.C.E.). see also n. 402 (Chios, 276 B.C.E.).</page><page sequence="11">Fritz Graf 121 more than a rather unexpected victory helped by a snow-storm), it was read as the result of divine intervention: the god, again, protected his sanctuary. Some thirty years after the event, an inscription in which the Smyrnaeans react to the invitation replaces the "epiphany of the god" by "the epiphany of the gods."40 It mentions sacrifices to Apollo alone because he had given the victory—but by now Apollo was no longer alone in defending his sanctuary. This could mean that the event had been embellished by eyewitness reports rather early and that its interpretation was supplemented by later elaborations that introduced several gods, whoever they were. The later literary reports give more details. Pausanias tells how Apollo sent thunder and lightning; the god thus again manifested himself in meteorological phenomena. But Pausanias also narrates, in two similar accounts, the intervention of four apparitions (&lt;paa(iaia), four local heroes who had their graves in the sanctuary, Pyrrhus, Hyperochus, Laodicus and Phylacus. He gives no witnesses who might have seen them; we have to assume that everybody did.41 Other authors were even more elaborate: Cicero and his younger contemporary Diodorus of Sicily heard about the intervention of "White Maidens." Cicero makes it clear that he, rationalist that he is, understands this as a poetical or mythical allegory of the snowstorm.42 Pompeius Trogus goes even further than this: in the fray of the battle, the priests and prophets suddenly came forward, and announced that they saw the god jump into his temple through the open gable as a most beautiful young man, who was joined by two armed virgins emerging from the sanctuaries of Minerva (Athena) and Diana (Artemis) respectively. When the defenders took heart and attacked, they felt the praesentia ("the helping presence") of the god through an earthquake, hail and a snowstorm.43 Here, in this clearly fictitious account, the epiphany seen by several persons is followed by a natural sign that confirmed the correctness of the vision—provided that the viewers were already conditioned to read it that way, which they were by the first epiphanies. The mechanism recalls Herodotus' account of the Persian defeat when they were attacking Delphi: there the god prepared the ground. It was easy to read storm and land-slides as the god's work since he had announced that he would be capable of looking out after himself. Besides these accounts of collective epiphanies, there are epigraphical documents in which individuals claim to have seen epiphanies themselves. 40 Petzl 1987: n. 574 (a. 246-45 B.C.E.). 41Paus. 1.4. 4,10. 23.3. 42 Cic., Div. 1. 81, see Pease 1920:242-44; Diod. Sic. 22.9. 5. 43 Just., Epit. (Philippic Histories of Pompeius of Tragus) 24. 8.</page><page sequence="12">122 Illinois Classical Studies 29 (2004) Perhaps the most impressive one is the report by Isyllus of Epidauros. In the later fourth century B.C.E., this otherwise unknown Greek dedicated a long and complex inscription to Asclepius in his Epidaurian sanctuary, with a paean composed by himself.44 He narrates how as a sick boy he had come to the sanctuary in order to obtain healing. The god, however, was busy (it was the time when Philip II attacked the Greeks), but he was gracious enough to explain to the boy what happened. On his way to the sanctuary, the boy met with the god in flashing golden armor. The god explained that he was on his way to Sparta to help the Greeks fight the Macedonians; the boy should just wait in the sanctuary until the god would be back for his cure. Instead of waiting, the boy himself rushed to Sparta and told the Spartans that Asclepius was out to save them. After they were saved, they instituted the festival of Asclepius Soter. The story reads like yet another Epidaurian miracle story, this time confirmed by a Spartan state festival.45 But whatever the realities, Isyllus remembered a personal epiphany of Asclepius in bodily form, the same form the patients must have been seeing in their dreams in the incubation hall. Only that this epiphany occurred during daytime: Isyllus was on his way and fully awake. Even if we should doubt the reality of this epiphany, more on grounds of cultural preconceptions that of any sound philological or historical argument, neither Isyllus nor his contemporaries did do so. The epigraphical record thus more or less faithfully repeats the pattern we met in Herodotus. Inscriptions that talk about recent events record no collective epiphanies in the modern sense, they record phenomena, mainly natural, that contemporaries read as divine interventions. After a certain time, however, collective epiphanies of the gods in bodily form were invented. After so many years, no eyewitnesses could contradict the story. Epiphanies revealed to an individual are by their very nature verified only by this individual's word; we have no better means than Herodotus had to judge their authenticity. He suspended his judgment, and I would like to do the same. V. Religious Needs and Physical Possibilities The Greeks, then, like many other Mediterranean and non-Mediterranean peoples, were willing to accept proofs of divine interference in events, especially when human affairs went through a critical period. They went so far as to utilize such divine manifestations as a reason for cultic honors. But 44 Text and long commentary in Wilamowitz 1886; the entire inscription again IG IV2 1, 81-3, n. 128; the paean in Kappel 1992: 380-83 Pai. 40. 45 The Epidaurian miracle stories IG IV2 1, 70-81, n. 121-27, LiDonnici 1995; for the entire corpus see Girone 1998.</page><page sequence="13">Fritz Graf 123 every cultural encoding of the world has its limits: gods and heroes do not ordinarily become physically visible in an empirical world. This created a tension between religious needs and physical possibilities. The tension was mediated in two ways: by narration, and by allegory or personification. Thus, natural phenomena were read in an allegorical way, and fictional narratives about interventions in the past were developed. There was one case where no such mediation was necessary: the epiphany or vision by an individual. This explains the ready acceptance of an individual's report of a vision, an epiphany, or a dream. Individuals could be trusted to have seen the gods: we all see them sometimes in our dreams, why not some gifted individuals also during the day? There was, however, a residue of skepticism: sometimes, an individual could cheat, as Pisistratus did. The acceptance of individual epiphany went even further. There were occasions when a larger group had to act in accordance with an epiphany. Then the individuals who had seen the divinity played a crucial role. The emperor Constantine had a dream, saw the cross and heard the voice promise him victory; as a result, his legions had to paint the cross on their shields.45 Phidippides met Pan and faithfully relayed his message to the Athenians; they decided in full assembly to institute a cult. The mechanism became standard for the divinization of the Roman emperor, following the model, turned aetiological story, of how Romulus disappeared but then appeared again to one selected citizen who happened to travel on a lonely road (the loneliness is as crucial factor, as it was in the case of Phidippides); Romulus told him that he had become a god, and ordered him to report this to the senate.47 In like manner, later emperors or members of their family became gods:48 there was no way that the senate could decree divinity and thus make a god out of a human, the senate could only decree a cult once the superhuman status had been established. Thus, the divinized mortal had to reveal this himself to the senators or the Roman people. However, given the impossibility of direct collective epiphanies, there could be only one recipient of such a vision, which made the entire process vulnerable. It could be decried as manipulation when the divinization was questioned. This is what Seneca does with Claudius' divinization in his Apocolocyntosis. Ritual fiction could come closer and bring in an eagle to be released on the pyre;49 iconographical fiction could be more concrete and depict how the eagle of Jupiter abducted the emperor. 46 See Bremmer and van den Bosch 1995, with earlier literature. I have no intention of entering the debate about its authenticity. 47 See Livy 1. 16. 5-8; Dion. Hal., Ant. Rom. 2. 63. 3; Plut., Vit. Rom. 28; note also Cic., Rep. 2. 20. 48 See Sen., Apocol. 1. 2 (Iulia Drusilla, Claudius); Dio Cass. 56. 46. 2 (Livia). 49 See Dio Cass. 56. 42 on the funeral of Augustus; Price 1987.</page><page sequence="14">124 Illinois Classical Studies 29 (2004) The Christians, however, easily outdid this. After his death, Christ appeared to two, not one, disciples on their way to Emmaus, thus providing the welcome plurality of witnesses. Again, we have moved from ritual to fiction. The Emmaus epiphany is no less or no more trustworthy than the angels who appeared to the group of shepherds of Bethlehem. Christianity, then, did not behave differently: it accepted collective epiphany in fictionalized texts (the Gospels, Acts) that would also convince the not yet convinced, and it accepted individual epiphany or vision, as in the case of Paul and his acceptance by the church of Corinth. The gap between what was possible in the physical world and religious imagination did not only open up a hermeneutical space. Interpretation is always marred by the possibility of uncertainty and hence error, but error can be manipulated to one's end. The Athenians interpreted what they saw when they accepted Phye as Athena—or, as Herodotus has it, they committed an error by doing so. Pisistratus, on the other hand, was suspected of manipulation by his enemies. This explains better why the field of epiphany was a field of manipulation or, less negatively phrased, clever stratagems, as Polyaenus never tired of pointing out.50 VI. Divine Presence Felt: Processions, Statues, Impersonation Greek and, to a lesser degree, Roman civilization developed epiphany as a mode of imagining the intervention of the divine in the physical world. It also prepared ritual mechanisms to help underpin such epiphanic manifestations and to mediate the tension between empirical reality, where gods do not appear, and religious certainty, where they did exactly this.51 The main mechanism was the procession.52 Processions basically aim at transporting gifts—sacrificial animals, votive gifts like the Athenian peplos for Athena—from the city to the sanctuary: at the very end of the procession, the divinity is expecting the humans.53 But at least in the processions of the imperial epoch, the gods were present as well, in the form of statues. Examples are the many gold and silver images of Artemis which Vibius Salutaris in Ephesus had financed and which were used in an impressive procession from the Artemision into the city and its theater, and out again to the sanctuary.54 But gods could also be present in the person of the priestess disguised as the 50 See Pritchett 1979: 44^)5. 51 Versnel 1987 pointed this out, and I am very much indebted to him. 52 Greek and Roman processions need more research than they have received; see Graf 1996 and, for a Near Eastern procession, Pongratz-Leisten 1994. 53 See the black-figure Boeotian vase with a procession to Athena, Nilsson 1967: Plate 32. 54 Rogers 1991.</page><page sequence="15">Fritz Graf 125 goddess (see Burkert in this volume). Again for Ephesus, the novelist Xenophon describes the main procession of the Artemisia festival. Anthia, the virgin priestess leads the group of girls, and her beauty is such that "often the Ephesians greeted her as Artemis, when they met her in the sanctuary."55 Even more strikingly, Heliodoros had his heroine ride in a chariot in the procession he describes at Delphi, with bow and quiver looking exactly like the virgin goddess, and since she was wearing that outfit for large parts of the novel, she too was mistaken for the goddess.56 This is fiction, but it is fiction that resonated with the reality of cult. Pausanias describes how, in the procession that went out from Patrae to the sanctuary of Artemis Laphria, the priestess was riding a chariot, dressed as the divine huntress.57 And one explanation for the mistaken epiphany of Athene in Pellene, after all, was that "in reality" it was the priestess who was seen, attired in the armor and the weapons of her goddess. Connor rather assumes than makes clear that he sees the same ritual mechanism behind the story of Pisistratos and Phye—not as a regular annual procession, but as a ritual enacted once, for a specific purpose.58 The distance between a god's statue and a god's personal appearance is shorter than we think. Divinities could appear in the form of their statues, both in dreams and in visions. In his Dream Book, Artemidorus pointed out that to dream of a statue of a god was equivalent to dream of the god.59 A statue, after all, is where the divinity is manifested within the sanctuary; it participates in the god's specific forces. When Ajax attacked Cassandra, she took refuge with Athena's image, as did many later suppliants with the statue of the emperor. The conceptual problem was rarely tackled: if the anthropomorphic image is a dwelling place of the divinity, does it then reflect the divinity's real looks? The naive answer would be affirmative. That is why Athena's image turned away from the rape of Cassandra. A more sophisticated answer insists on the difference between true form and anthropomorphic image. Already myth did this: Zeus' real image is lightning, as Semele learned. And once the anthropomorphic form is seen not as the real physical image of a divinity, but as just another form to make the divine essence accessible to human perception, the distance between god and image can become even smaller.60 Closer even to epiphany, understood as helpful divine intervention, is the curious custom of the Spartans of taking the Dioscuri, or at least one of 55 Xen., Ephesiaca 2. 56 Heliod., Aeth. 1.2. "Paus. 7.18.12. 58 Connor 1987:42-^17. 59 Artemidorus Daldianus, Onirocritica 2. 39. 60 See Graf 2001; Betz in this volume.</page><page sequence="16">126 Illinois Classical Studies 29 (2004) them, into battle. We do not know how they did that. But we know how the Locrians borrowed the two gods from the Spartans before the battle of the Sagra. The two testimonies we possess agree that the Locrians prepared couches or pillows for them on the ship that brought them back. Thus, there was a tangible, albeit non-anthropomorphic, evidence for the divine presence.61 The couches replicated the ritual of theoxenia; there was, it seems, no need to place statues on them, as the Romans did in their lectisternia. The ritual could be even less graphic. When Timoleon was about to sail to Syracuse, Demeter and Kore told their priestess in Corinth via a dream that they would sail with him. Timoleon instructed a sacred trireme and named it after the goddesses. At one point, when approaching Italy during the night, the ship was illuminated by heavenly light: the goddesses were really present.62 The Athenian procession of the Mysteries that led from Athens to Eleusis comes even closer to the experience of collective epiphany. The procession took an entire day, and it was guided by Iacchus, "Demeter's servant" whom our sources sometimes identify with Dionysos. The participants in the daylong procession underwent an ecstatic experience that was not unlike the one in the cult of Dionysus.63 Divine guidance expressed itself in a clear ritual form: a small image of Iacchus, that during the year was kept in the Iaccheion near the Sacred Gate, was carried at the head of the procession:64 the god literally led the way. But at least one author could call him an apparition, phasma as well: to the ecstatic participants of the procession, the statue and the god turned into one figure.65 The same term phasma recurs in connection with the experience of the mysteries. Here the ritual came as close to a collective epiphany as possible.66 The term phasma not only covers figures like the empousa whose apparition frightened the initiates but also the blissful visions caused by the hierophant's ritual actions.67 These are glimpses into a religious mentality that tried as hard as possible to make a divine presence felt if not seen, at least in times of crisis, 61 Diod.

The ritual props (statues, priests dressed up as gods, empty couches, divine names as signs of divine presence), however, seem to have been the exception, not the rule. They were props that help us understand how the Greeks bridged the gap between the physical world and divine manifestation. The wide meaning of emcpaveia in Greek fits very well: its vagueness again helped bridge the antinomies. In this respect, it is a much later, Christian expectation that narrows the term down to the actual physical appearance of a divinity; the clarity of a revealed religion had no place for vagueness and ambiguity.
