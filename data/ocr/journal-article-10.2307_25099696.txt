(A History of the Modern Poetical Literature of the Germans. By G. G. Gervinus. Two Volumes. 8vo. pp. 1379.) In these five large octavos is contained the history of the poetical literature of Germany, from the time of the an cient bards mentioned by Tacitus, down to the death of Goethe. The subject is a great one. It comprises whatever the Muse has sung, during a period of more than a thousand years, in that broad land which lies between the Rhine and the Vistula, the Danube and the Baltic, ? the songs of the bards of heathen antiquity, the Christian poesy of knight, monk, and burgher in the middle ages, and the immortal productions of the great masters of modern verse. To the accomplishment of his task the author has brought no ordinary qualifications. He exhibits the extensive and profound erudition, the historical faculty of bringing past and remote states of society near, and projecting the present into the distance, and the philosophical insight into the distin guishing features of individuals, communities, and epochs, which so favorably characterize the recent historiography of the Germans. He has evidently studied not only the poetry of Germany, but that of the other contemporary European, not to add Asiatic, nations ; and has made himself acquainted</page><page sequence="2">80 Gervinus's History of German Poetry. [Jan. with the progress of the kindred arts, and the other depart ments of letters. No parade, however, is made of his learn ing ; the results of investigation are given, not the processes. Elaborate in its style without being pedantic, rich in signifi cant facts and instructive principles, and free from the de tails of minute criticism, the work of Gervinus has a higher artistic merit than is usually found in the productions of his countrymen. We should do our author little honor by instituting a com parison between his labors and those of his predecessors in this department of literary effort. Less brilliant, indeed, than the author of " German Literature," he is, however, less prejudiced and less egotistical ; is sounder in principle, more profoundly learned, and more classical in taste. He has written a purely historical, and not, like those who pre ceded him, an sesthetical work ; he has also avoided the common fault of overrating the early poetry of the Germans, in comparison with that of recent times. He has contem plated the progress of poetry from a new point of view, showing what part his countrymen have taken in restoring the pure forms and unconscious spirit of those early days, when Homer, Pindar, and Sophocles sang from the pure love of song, and before the prevalence of philosophy throughout Greece, by developing the reflective powers of the national mind, had infused the sentiments of the schools into the measures of poesy. In attempting to give our readers some account of this elaborate work, we shall follow quite closely in the track of the author, expressing his opinions rather than our own, and adopting even his language and illustrations when it suits our purpose, though with such modifications that it may not be proper to mark the passage as an extract. The earliest German ballads have been lost ; but there is sufficient reason for believing, that the infancy of this, as of every other nation, ? including even the degraded tribes of Africa and the rude natives of Kamtschatka, ? was delighted and instructed by songs. Tacitus alludes to old ballads, in which the earth-born Tuisco, and Mannus, his son, were celebrated as the founders of the German race ; and makes mention of the barritus, or discordant chant accompanied by the clashing together of many bucklers, which inflamed the souls of the warriors on the eve of battle. The bards re</page><page sequence="3">1844.] Gervinus's History of German Poetry. 81 corded in song all public transactions, related in succession the names of their kings, and sang the praises of heroes like Her cules and Arminius. The gift of song does not appear, how ever, to have been confined to any distinct class of persons, but to have been enjoyed by the people at large. If there were wandering minstrels, who gained a livelihood by the use of the lyre, they were probably not numerous, and their vo cation was held in but little esteem. Unlike the Grecian, the German warriors all joined in the battle chant and paean. No priestly order, like the Druids of Gaul, taught in hymns the fables of their mythology ; but, as in modern times, the whole people were the guardians of poetry and song, always more universally popular in this than in any other nation of modern Europe. The poetry of the German bards can bear no comparison with that of the early Greeks. No song of Sirens was ever heard by the rude voyagers of the Suevian Sea. No Or pheus of the North ever softened the ferocity of Teutonic boars and bears, or drew after him the rocks and trees of the Hercynian forest. Nor could the Germans, situated in a temperate clime, and amid natural scenery of a mild and simple character, have breathed into their early poetry the fiery passions of the Arabians, inhabiting the burning sands of the desert, or the sublime conceptions of the Scandina vians, surrounded by their tempestuous seas, widely-spread snow-plains, and rugged mountains. In this central region, early fable and mythology received more of a historical and humane character ; while, during the endless nights of the North, the imagination peopled the darkness with gigantic and superhuman shapes, and beneath the resplendent skies of the South, the fancy revelled in fictions the most fantastic and gorgeous. The life of the German being one of rapine and war, his songs were imbued with the spirit of revenge and daring, with the love of the ruder virtues, and the vene ration of supernatural divinities, with praises of the steed, the bow, the shield, and the spear. War, in fact, was the burden of song in the heroic age, as love afterwards was in that of chivalry. The regular growth of the early song and tradition of the Germans was checked by their numerous migrations, and their prolonged wars with the Roman Empire. Move ments so stupendous must have absorbed all the interests VOL, LVIII. ?no. 122. 11</page><page sequence="4">82 Gervinus's History of German Poetry. [Jan. and energies of the barbarian tribes who took part in them. The foundations of society were broken up, whole nations changed their dwelling-places, ancient tribes were dissolved and new ones created, and the languages, laws, and usages of the people were either greatly modified or en tirely destroyed. Amid this wild confusion of marching na tions, the sweet voices of the ancient bards could no longer be heard. Tribes passed away whose exploits were never chronicled ; heroes lived and died, unsung ; and the names of few chieftains, except those of Attila and Theodoric, were rescued from unmerited oblivion by the lyre. With the introduction of Christianity, the heathen bards, who had celebrated the exploits of Hermann and Velida, of Attila and Theodoric, gave place to the ecclesiastical po ets, who reduced to verse the legends of the saints and the narratives of the New Testament. They used not the ver nacular language of Germany, but the Latin tongue of the more enlightened South ; and, instead of the alliteration of the bardic songs, introduced the rhyme of modern poetry. The love of letters was confined to the clerical order, even down to the expiration of the Frankish dynasty ; but as the cloister was more serviceable in preserving the treasures of classic learning, and in promoting those abstract studies which require seclusion from the disturbing influences of so ciety, than in the cultivation of the art of poetry, which is best learned in the midst of men and the stirring events of real life, we find at the present day not so much poetical, as linguistic merit in these effusions of the sacerdotal muse. It should be added, however, that the iEsopic fables of those times, particularly the " Reinhart Fuchs," are not destitute of poetical merit. The next great event which materially influenced the lit erature of Germany was the beginning of the Crusades. This great struggle between Mohammedanism and Christian ity, together with the extinction of the Celtic nations, and the discovery both of the New World and the passage by the Cape of Good Hope to the East Indies, brought to a close the dominion of barbarian heroism and classic culture over Europe, and ushered in the reign of Christian sentiment and modern ideas. The knowledge of foreign life and literature, introduced among the Germans by intercourse with the in habitants of distant countries, elevated the character of the</page><page sequence="5">1844.] Gervinus's History of German Poetry. 83 clerical order, placed the lyre in the hands of some of the most famous heroes of the Crusades at the same time with the sword, and at length wrested from the priesthood the privilege they had enjoyed since the introduction of Chris tianity, of retaining among themselves exclusively the culti vation of letters. The poetical use of the vernacular tongue, instead of the Latin, was restored ; and what was before read from the books of the learned was now heard from the lips of knights and princes. Christianity, which at a later period exerted a powerful effect in developing the imagination and the understanding of the Germans, in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries ad dressed itself almost exclusively to the cultivation of the feel ings, and nourished the most pious and generous sentiments. The steel-clad knight devoted himself to the defence of the faith of Christ, the protection of innocence, the service of woman, the practice of arms, and the cultivation of poesy. He wore the cross as a badge of his faith ; and bore the sword not only as a weapon of death, but as the symbol of his honor. Sentiment was the characteristic of the poetry, as of the life, of the Middle Ages. Love was the common theme of the almost innumerable songs of this period. The knights and nobles of Germany were devoted to warlike pur suits, it is true ; they tilted for fame in the tournament, and courted death in battle ; they lived by the toils of the chase, the spoils of war, and the gains of marauding ; and yet, strange to say, scarcely a war-song is to be found in all the productions of the times. The neighing of the war-horse and the blast of the trumpet are not heard in their poetical effusions ; but rather the cooing of doves, and the melting strains of enamoured birds. The productions of these Minnesingers (Love-singers) are, in truth, somewhat effem inate. Grimm called their art womanish. It did not por tray, it must be acknowledged, the great and manly qualities of that stirring age. Entirely subjective in its character, it expressed in gentle words only the tender sentiments. It sung almost exclusively the delights and pains of love, the bloom of May and the desolateness of winter, the hopes of youth and the miseries of age, the promise of the future and the regrets of the past. In manliness of character, as well as in originality of gen ius, the Minnesingers of Germany were decidedly inferior</page><page sequence="6">84 Gervinus's History of German Poetry. [Jan. to the Troubadours of Provence. The minstrels of the South sang the honors of "war, the duties of knighthood, and the loyalty of vassals, as well as the pleasures of love and the praises of the fair. The verse of Castelnau glows with enthusiasm for his rank and order ; that of Boniface with hatred of jurists and prelates ; that of Figuera with zeal against Rome and the Pope. Religious opinions, philoso phy, romance, every thing, in fact, that was in life, appears in the poetry of the Troubadours. They directed public opinion ; and, with true lyric feeling, lived in the present, as the epic poet does in the past. Men held in high esteem both their counsel and their praise ; they dreaded the indig nation expressed both by their lips and their songs. These minstrels entered the lists of love with princes for rivals, and even assailed the throne with political opposition. The com prehensive culture of the Troubadours gave rise to the great est diversities of poetic talent, and to very marked differen ces in the value of their productions ; but we can produce numerous specimens from the Minnesingers, which it would require a sharp eye and discriminating study to distinguish from each other. Poets of the former class are rich and va ried, while the latter are fervent, in sentiment, ? the former being delighted with the mingled play of the emotions, while the others are content with the full utterance of a single feeling. The passion of the Troubadours is stronger and wilder, and has none of that German modesty, which pre sumes not even to mention the name of its beloved in song. Amid much that is frivolous, what is truly noble in them ap pears to greater advantage ; and, when their lays do breathe the spirit of faithful love, one is more convinced of its gen uineness than in the Minnesongs of the North, where vows and oaths are too often repeated with conventional heartless ness. Hence it was, that even Dante and Petrarch did not disdain to refresh their genius at the living fountains of the Valencian minstrelsy. In the early part of the thirteenth century, while the po etry of chivalry was in its highest estate, was discovered the " Lay of the Nibelungen." This is a collection of old heroic songs, which appear to have been originally composed by different individuals, but were afterwards compiled and wrought together by the skill either of Henry von Ofterding en, or of some one of the minstrels' who embellished with the</page><page sequence="7">1844.] Gervinus's History of German Poetry. 85 graces of poetry and music the courts of the Landgraves of Thuringia and Babenberg. The subject; of this ancient lay consists of legends respecting the Gothic, Frankish, and Burgundian heroes, who lived in the times of the great North ern migrations ; and is treated with that simplicity of manner, purity of sentiment, and magnanimity of thought, which be long to the heroic age of German literature. At about the same time, also, was brought to light another poem, or collection of poems, called the " Gudrun," which may be said to be the Odyssey, as the "Lay of the Nibe lungen " is the Iliad, of Germany. The origin of this ven erable relic is enveloped in the obscurity of antiquity, though portions of it may be traced back to the twelfth century. The scene of the sagas of the " Gudrun " is laid in differ ent countries, in Friesland, Denmark, Zeeland, Ireland, and Normandy ; and both style and matter occasionally exhibit somewhat of a Scandinavian, Danish, or British, as well as a German character. More highly polished, and more per fect in whatever belongs to poetic form, than the " Lay of the Nibelungen," the " Gudrun " occupies a middle position between popular song, and a more artificial style of poetry. Both poems are an ornament to the literature, and an hon or to the people of Germany. They are alive with the spirit of those old, heroic times, when barbarian bravery, fidelity, and chastity elicited the admiration even of the civ ilized Romans. Free from modern effeminacy, if not al ways from primitive coarseness of sentiment, full of healthy vigor and genuine virtue, these lyrical relics are of a far higher order than the contemporary productions of other European countries, and indicate the early existence, in the Germanic race, of those high poetical and moral qualities, afterwards so illustriously displayed in the Lutheran Refor mation and in recent poetry. In the latter part of the thirteenth century, the poetry of chivalry began to be superseded by that of the trades. Cloyed with the sweet excess of love, the Muse forsook the lofty courts and castles of the Minnesingers, to descend into the noisy workshops of mechanics and tradesmen. The tailor broke the monotonous silence of his calling with divine song, and the cobbler relieved his toil with the delights of poesy. The Meistersingers were a fraternity of poetical artisans, who manufactured songs by rule and measure, as well as</page><page sequence="8">86 Gervinus's History of German Poetry. [Jan. shoes, coats, and houses. Art was taught by them in for mal schools ; strict rules of composition were inculcated ; and contests of poetic skill instituted, in which the victor was rewarded with a garland of roses. These poets generally drew their themes and inspiration either from the Bible or the contemporary literature ; and reflected in their writings the asceticism, scholasticism, mysticism, pedantry, and super stition of the times. Compared with the Minnesongs, the poetry of the Meistersingers is inferior in matter, but more perfect in form. The art of the Meisters is plastic, festive, didactic, and satirical ; that of the knights, grave, musical, refined, and either epic or lyrical. The former is the pro duct of the imagination, and aims at entertainment ; the lat ter, of the understanding, and always inculcates a moral. The one is subjective, ? rhyming its own fancies, and ideal izing the pursuits of mankind ; the other realistic, ? describ ing the coarser forms of human character, and portraying things as they are. That is the poetry of love ; this, of life. The prince of the Meistersingers was Hans Sachs of Nu remberg, shoemaker. Born in the latter part of the fifteenth century, he lived in that ancient city at a period when it was the high school of poetry, and the literary metropolis of Germany, ? when it was enriched by trade and manufac tures, and adorned by the presence of men of the highest gen ius, and by all the polite arts which at that time embellished life. This hero of German song, though commonly classed with the Meistersingers, in fact, far surpassed them in gen ius, and brought about as great a reformation in letters, as Luther in religion, or H?tten in politics. He greatly im proved the poetical forms which were adopted by his pre decessors, and, overstepping the limits which had before been drawn around the practice of the divine art, taught his successors to walk abroad over the fields of universal knowledge. The language of Sachs is more highly culti vated than that of any contemporary except Luther. His rhymes are, indeed, frequently turned off with too great ra pidity and uniformity ; his cultivation was not equal to his native talent ; but he had a great poetic soul, and nobly exe cuted the task to which he was called, of singing the praises of virtue and satirizing the follies of superstition. As a polemic, he was moderate ; he was warmly interested in the</page><page sequence="9">1844.] Gervinus's History of German Poetry. 87 religious reforms of the day, but not excited by them. In other respects, he was one of the most manly spirits who lived in the time of the Reformation, ? keeping a soul se rene amid all the distractions of the age, and modestly pros ecuting his honest trade of shoemaking. The Reformation gave rise to a new form of religious poetry. The Latin hymns of the Catholic church were supplanted by the sacred songs of Protestant theologians, who, from the time of Luther to that of Klopstock, held exclusive possession of the German Parnassus. The calam ities of the Thirty Years' War between the rival churches unsealed the fountains of religious and poetic feeling ; and the agitated soul poured itself forth in hymns and spiritual songs. The number of these effusions of the sacred muse was very great ; Hardenberg's register contains the first lines of no less than sixty thousand. Almost every priest was, or claimed to be, a poet. The Scriptures and the creeds of the church were versified ; the Latin Catholic songs, among which were many of transcendent beauty, as, for example, the Dies ir , and the Apparebit repentina, were translat ed ; of morning and evening benedictions, of bridal and burial, Christmas and new year's, songs, of house and church melodies, laments, thanksgivings, and litanies, there was almost an infinite variety. Those written by Luther are generally the best. They breathe the spirit of his firm and cheerful faith, of his deep sentiment, and his robust, yet tempered manliness of character. Luther, and most of the other writers, composed musical accompaniments to their hymns, ?some of them believing, that to every one to whom the Holy Ghost imparted a new song, it also gave a new melody. Whatever Luther wrote was everywhere imitated and sung, in church and school, in the house and the shop, the street, the market place, and the field ; so that the reli gious songs of the theologians after the Reformation univer sally prevailed over the secular poetry of their predecessors, as they have also remained unequalled by similar productions of later times. Novalis and Harms may have written choral melodies which embody the spirit of true devotion, and which may be more elegantly finished than those of Hermann or Luther ; but the people at large have the stanch faith, the noble simplicity, and the devout reverence of the old times no longer ; and, together with the loss of these virtues, they have lost their former enthusiasm for the solemn lyre.</page><page sequence="10">88 Gervinus's History of German Poetry. [Jan. The next great luminary that arose in the poetic heaven of Germany was Martin Opitz. He has been called the founder of the modern poetical literature of his country ; and was, at least, the father of its artistic poetry. Opitz greatly improved his vernacular language, and he united the spirit of the ancient Greek with that of the modern German literature. He first taught his countrymen the art of making literal translations from the classics ; he introduced again the secular love-song, that had hardly passed the lips of youth since the days of the Minnesingers ; and, developing the pow ers of the North in Silesia, as those of the more precocious South had before been displayed in Suabia, he established the poetry of reflection by the side of that of sentiment. The great abilities of Opitz were acknowledged even during his lifetime. The contemporary poets were all loud in his praise ; the German muse was called the Opitzian ; a journey which he made through the land, after the publication of his poems, was a march of triumph ; and, at Vienna, he was both crowned with the laurel, and raised to the honors of nobility. He did not, however, possess the highest gifts of genius ; he had no power of original invention, and his poetry was more perfect in form, than fresh and copious in materials. Neither, although there were not wanting good points in his character, was he distinguished by the nobler virtues as a man ; but rather, like too many other literary men of his times, by subserviency to the great, who rewarded the poet with offices, and flattered him with titles and honors. We have now hastily followed our author through the first three volumes of his work, containing the history of the early poetical literature of the Germans ; and have reached a period, when we may look for the appearance of a poet of higher and more comprehensive genius than that which ani mated those whom we have already noticed. Hitherto, we have seen poetry confined to separate classes of society and local schools ; we have met with writers whose views were bound to particular times and places, and whose culture was hardly superior to that of the comparatively unenlight ened age in which they lived. But Klopstock, standing on the vantage-ground of modern times, overlooked the entire course of the past. He summed up the labors of all his predecessors, and harvested the combined literary culture of ten centuries. The learning acquired by previous industry,</page><page sequence="11">1844.] Gervinus's History of German Poetry. 89 a cultivated language and an improved art, the experience of a long line of poets and ages of history, the liberal spirit of modern times, and the old superstitions, legends, and fair, poetic fables, ? all were the inheritance of Klop stock. With this poet, accordingly, ? as, in a less degree, with his immediate predecessor, Gottsched, ? the universal, revolutionary, and comparatively independent spirit of mod ern German literature began distinctly to manifest itself. Frederic Gottlob Klopstock was born in Quedlinburg, in 1724, and lived till 1803. He grew up in the open air, a vig orous and precocious boy ; and at an early age learned the arts of riding, swimming, and skating, the latter of which he passionately loved and sang. Solitude and society were equally agreeable to him ; hilarity and pensiveness seemed by turns to be the prevailing traits of his disposition. He wrote pastorals and penitential hymns, while at school. Even in youth, says Gervinus, his fingers were skilled to sweep the Grecian lyre, the telyn of the old German bards, and the psaltery of the sacred singers of Judea. And he was soon inspired with the ambitious hope of producing some great work, that should enable his native country to take poetic rank by the side of the proudest of her sister kingdoms. Klopstock excelled in the ode, of which he composed three different kinds ; one, in the spirit of David and the prophets, another, in that of Ossian and the Edda, and the third, in imitation of Pindar and Horace. Of these dif ferent classes, the last is the best, as the Greeks and Ro mans were the most accomplished masters of this species of composition. According to Herder, every one of Klop stock's odes has a distinct and peculiar expression ; each is a different dance of harmonious words, and each a choral song that must be heard in order to be appreciated. Klop stock was, in fact, a musician. He was an enthusiastic ad mirer of the great contemporary masters, Handel and Bach, Gluck and Kunst. Their compositions kindled his poetical rapture, and often furnished, directly, the materials for his odes. He has himself acknowledged, that his principal guides, in the invention of lyric measures, were Nature and the tone-inspired Bach. But Klopstock was not satisfied with writing odes. He burned with the desire to compose a great epic poem, of which the inspiration should be drawn from the religion of VOL. LVIII. ?no. 122. 12</page><page sequence="12">90 Gervinus's History of German Poetry. [Jan. Jesus, and not from the art of classic Greece, or the passion of barbarian Germany. He lived, as he once said to his friend Claudius, only to sing the song of God. The execu tion of this pious work he had designed to defer until he had reached his thirtieth year ; but impatient frenzy prevailed, and he commenced " The Messiah " in his youth. The subject of this epic hymn is passion, instead of action, and herein lies its greatest fault. Even the hero is represented as suffering, rather than doing ; and all the persons introduc ed into the poem express their feelings, instead of showing us their acts. These feelings, too, all run into ecstasies ; the poem is full of raptures, visions, laments, hallelujahs, and tears. Written under the influence of strong religious emotion, and being, in fact, a record of the poet's spiritual experience, it can be perused only in a similar state of pious exaltation. But as this cannot be a permanent state of mind, the author's attempt at continual pathos and sublimity has ne cessarily made the entire work a succession of magnificent failures. The men and women of " The Messiah " are either angels or devils ; the angels themselves, without characteris tic attributes, are vague and empty forms, shadows, noth ings. How unlike the fair humanities of Milton's heaven ! In the case of the Saviour, too,?so unlike the beautiful and nat ural anthropomorphism of the Scriptures, ? the majesty of the God entirely overshadows the mild virtues and affection ate sympathies of the man. Thus the beauty of materiali ty is completely spiritualized away in Klopstock, as facts are all sublimated into sentiments. " The Messiah " was originally received in Germany with the greatest enthusiasm, and brought many a pious soul to its Nunc dimittas. It comprehended all the culture, and surpassed by far the expectations, of the times. But pos terity pronounces it, as a work of art, to be too musical in its character, too personal, too pathetical, and too sublime. Men attribute to it, as the noblest poem Germany had then produced, great historical, but less aesthetical value. In fine, they revere the poet, but do not read him. The religious spirit of Klopstock, who exerted a great influence on the succeeding literature of his country, was re produced in the early writings of Christopher Martin Wie land. When but thirteen years of age, Wieland began to plan epics ; at school, he vexed his nights with pious and</page><page sequence="13">1844.] Gervinus's History of German Poetry. 91 penitential tears. When he began to write for the public, his pages glowed with faith in virtue ; he admired the simpli city of Xenophon, and studied the wisdom of Socrates with the eyes of Plato, and not, as in later times, with those of Aristippus. He hated the frivolity of the French, and bent with devout veneration over the solemnities of Young. He composed an Anti- Ovid, and the Emotions of a Christian, in which piety was surrounded with those graces that he after wards caused to wait on pleasure. He celebrated in pasto rals the innocence of an idyllic life, believed in the past existence of an age of gold, when purity was protected by fig-leaves, condemned the Anacreontic poets who sung the charms of Venus, and anathematized the poetry of the imitators of Ovid, as the wine of devils, by which thought less souls were intoxicated to their own destruction. The piety of Wieland passed away with his youth ; and the author of " Agathon " fell for ever from the heaven of the seraphic poets. This work, as well as several others on Grecian themes, was written in the spirit of the Aristippian philosophy. The perfumed air of the isles of Greece blows over their pages. Still, as there was nothing wanting, save the electric spark of genius, to reduce to fusion the poetical materials in Wieland's mind, in order to make him a true poet ; so was there nothing lacking in his delineations of Grecian life and manners, to render them truly antique, except the old Greek feeling itself. His Graces are not the same beauteous virgins that waited on the footsteps of Aphrodite, and danced in the presence of Jove. They are affected, instead of being ingenuous ; and have modern coquetry, in the place of antique innocence. In his attempt to reproduce the spirit of the Middle Ages, Wieland was more successful, as the task was much more congenial to his temperament. u Gandelin," and his other tales and fables in imitation of the literature of chivalry, pos sess all the graces of fancy and sentiment which embellish the writings of the Minnesingers.

It</page><page sequence="14">92 Gervinus's History of German Poetry. [Jan. does not, however, rank with the highest kind of poetry. Its object is merely the entertainment of the reader ; and success in this species of composition requires no higher gifts than those of poetic recital. Wieland received from Aristippus the principle, that wisdom consists in holding the golden mean between all ex tremes ; but unfortunately, he did- not always follow it in practice. The society in which he lived was in a state of transition, like that through which the individual sometimes passes from childhood to manhood, ? a state of doubt, self deception, and frequent change. He occupied a position midway between the pastoral innocence and golden youth of Klopstock's time, and the enlightened, philosophic cul ture of Schiller's and Goethe's. We find him, at one time, writing out his religious experience, and, at another, studying French poetry and composing in the style of Voltaire ; now attempting to revive the romantic spirit of the Middle Ages, and now to reanimate the antique genius of classic Greece ; now designing to portray in a romance the school of Socrates, and then to write a history of the German Em pire. Sometimes, he allowed himself to sport with the most sacred mysteries of religion, and then again he endeavoured to lay the foundations of a purer and higher morality, by teaching the inseparableness of wisdom and virtue. He held, that the object of poetry and art was, to produce the beautiful, not the useful, or the pleasurable ; and yet was ever employing them to invest virtue with graceful attrac tions, and to enrich life with elevated pleasures. He led a high ideal life, while he was at the same time polluting his pages with wanton descriptions of vice. Living in the bo som of his family, on a dozen acres, he was also a citizen of the world ; was both poet and critic ; a novelist to-day, anda philosopher to-morrow. Such a career precluded him, of course, from effecting much in the higher walks of art, and prevented his exerting any thing more than a transient influence upon the character of his countrymen. We now come to a writer in whom is to be found nothing either of the maiden sentimentality of Klopstock, or the refined, philosophic effeminacy of Wieland. Lessing was not a man to waste his nights in pietistic weeping, nor to lie down beneath Elysian skies to day-dreams of love and pleasure. His was a proud and daring spirit, endowed with</page><page sequence="15">1844.] Gervinus's History of German Poetry. 93 fortitude, magnanimity, and great decision. The son of an orthodox clergyman, Lessing was designed by his parents to follow the profession of divinity. But his free and wild spirit made him prefer the stage to the pulpit, and set the society of wits and players before that of pedants and theologians. At the youthful age when Klopstock read Fenelon, and Wieland was absorbed with Xenophon, the favorites of Lessing were Terence, Plautus, and Theo phrastus. Impatient of the restraints of university life, believing that books would never make him wiser, and in volved, moreover, in pecuniary difficulties, from his thought less but generous prodigality, and from the expense of learn ing the arts of riding, fencing, and dancing, he left his debts behind him in Leipsic, and his studies afterwards in Witten berg, to take refuge in the society of the freethinkers of Berlin. There, having relinquished all thought of seeking his fortune either by medicine or theology, he gave vent to his struggling feelings in epigrams, and wrote the learned articles for the newspaper of Vosz. Fettered to no place and to no persons, he soon left Berlin to accompany the army to Breslau, in the capacity of secretary to Tauen zien. A professorship in K?nigsberg, which was some time afterwards proffered him, he declined, from unwillingness to pronounce the yearly panegyric ; and indulged his imagina tion with the prospect of a more independent mode of life, by connecting himself with a bookseller's house in Hamburg. But he finally accepted the office of librarian at Wolfenb?t tel, where he could gratify his desire to labor and put forth the force that was in him, without being a dependent on the sweet voices of the public, or a hanger-on upon any man's favor. There he generously furthered all noble undertak ings within the sphere of his influence, and continued those labors for elevating the low estate of the German theatre, which long afterwards resulted so gloriously in the perfec tion of the national drama. At this period, a great calamity befell him in the loss of his wife and child ; but he bore it with noble stoicism, though saying, that these frequent mes sengers of death made him anxious to follow their call. The same spirit which characterized the life of Lessing pervaded his writings. While Klopstock described the heroic, and Wieland the weak, the works of Lessing exhibit the natural and true man. They are filled with a spiritual</page><page sequence="16">94 Gervinus's History of German Poetry. [Jan. freshness and healthy vigor, such as can be found in those of no other modern writer in Germany. There is no false sentiment in them, no corrupt principle. Lessing is earnest, vigorous, tolerant, truthful, progressive. He turned away from Wieland 's " Agathon " with moral indignation, though highly appreciating its artistic merit ; and said pedantically of Goethe's " Werter," that such an e? e?wto? xato^rj, impel ling a man rt ToXpav 7r?o? cpvoiv, would not, in the age of Socrates, have been deemed allowable even in a girl. Though a thorough German, he had more of the spirit of the old Greeks, and a clearer insight into the character of Grecian art, literature, and life, than any of his countrymen who lived before him. For nature, he possessed a simple, unsophisticated love, but not a sickly longing, such as is sometimes found in persons who are less familiar with it. In poetry, he sought for man and manly actions, not for moral precepts, or descriptive landscapes. In philosophy he believed in the h'v xal n?v of Spinoza ; but also in a Prov idence which notices the fall of the sparrow, and in all the orderings of which he manifested a truly Greek, we can hardly say Christian, acquiescence. He acknowledged no other moral law for a moral being than that which is derived from his particular nature, and which requires him to act according to his individual endowments. Truly antique was his sentiment, that one ought to be so occupied with the duties of the present life, as to have no inclination to debate the existence of another ; and that, as we can await the end of a single day, so ought we to be able to await that of life ; and any astrological art or religion, which could disclose to us either the near or the distant future, would not be worth the having. In the same spirit of resignation to a higher Power, he once told Jacobi, though his entire life was a rare specimen of the noblest liberty, that he wished for no free dom of will. His love of truth was surpassed by nothing but his love of the pursuit of it ; and he has left on record the following sublime passage, as remarkable for its modesty as its boldness : ? " It is not the truth a man has, or thinks that he has, but the sincere pains he has applied to obtain it, that constitutes his worth. For not by the possession of truth, but by the search after it, are his powers enlarged, wherein alone his ever growing perfection doth subsist. Possession makes man quiet, indolent, and proud. If God</page><page sequence="17">1844.] Gervinus's History of German Poetry. 95 should hold out in his right hand all truth, and in his left simply the intense desire for it, although with the condition that I should eternally err in the pursuit, and should say unto me, Choose ! I would fall humbly on his left, and say, Father, give ! Pure truth is, indeed, for thee alone." The religious sentiments of Lessing were similar to those which have since prevailed in the learned classes of German so ciety ; yet, like Leibnitz before him, allowing both an eso teric and an exoteric faith, he was very far from wishing to alter the forms of the established worship, or in any way needlessly to disturb the faith of the common people. The labors of Lessing were very various ; his learning prodi gious ; his aims universal ; his influence extensive, and, in certain respects, salutary. Like Leibnitz, again, he ranged observingly over the whole theatre of the period in which he lived, proving all things and holding fast, to that which was good, narrowed by no exclusive system of philosophy, and devoted to no one method of investigation. He at last brought the ancient times to a complete termination, and fully introduced the new ages. Lessing was no poet. He himself expressly said, that the living fountains of poetry were not in him. But the author of the " Laoc?on " was perhaps the greatest critic of modern times. The object of this celebrated work is, to show, that the isolation of the several fine arts from each other is essential to their perfection, and that their common aim is the production of beauty. The peculiar province of poetry is proved to be entirely distinct both from that of morality and of philosophy, being limited, strictly speaking, to the exhibition of ideal actions. These views, in which Lessing differed widely from Klopstock, who made moral beauty, and also from Wieland, who considered nature and truth, as the great aim of poetry, but in which he agreed with Aristotle, and was closely followed in their aesthetical theories by Goethe, Schiller, and Humboldt, were enforced with great argumentative power, extraordinary purity and correctness of taste, and with rich and pertinent illustrations from the art and literature of Greece. By his plays, writ ten in prose, and which, marking out the boundaries between prose and poetry, first established the true relations between them, Lessing regenerated the German stage ; and by his " Dramaturgie " delivering German poetry from the yoke</page><page sequence="18">96 Gervinus's History of German Poetry. [Jan. of French dogmatism, he pointed out to his countrymen the true paths to the Parnassian mount, which they afterwards so generally and successfully followed. We cannot pass by Winckelmann, that noble Grecian, who, in the middle of the eighteenth century, was the teacher of art for all civilized Europe, without saying a word or two respecting his character and works. Reluctant, like Les sing, to study the profession of divinity, for which he had been set apart, this great expounder of antique art sighed out the first thirty years of his life in giving lessons to little boys and girls. His spirit remained unbroken, however, and the study of classic art and literature afterwards restored him to second youth. At length, for the sake of spending the remainder of his days amidst the ruins and the arts of Rome, he changed his religion, and adopted the name of Catholic, ? saying to a friend, " Nullum ingenium mag num sine mixtura dementi ." In fact, however, though the recollection of early religious impressions was always pre cious to Winckelmann, as to Goethe, though he also com posed Lutheran hymns that were pressed, throughout Prus sia, to the hearts of the pious, and though, when under adver sity, he could pour, both into his own bosom and the broken hearts of his friends, the oil of religious consolation, yet he laid no claim to piety in the popular sense of the word. As he was a Catholic at Rome, so would he, in Greece, have been a priest of Cybele, or a worshipper of Osiris in Egypt. His religion, which he called philosophy, was that which, in his opinion, remained at last as the common truth of all forms of religious belief. To act and strive in the present hour he considered to be his calling ; and thought, if pos sible, less even than Lessing, of immortality. In Winckel mann, the good and the bad were mixed up together, as in nature ; and to be better than nature, he, like Goethe, had no desire, but rather a disinclination. In the solitude and adversity of his early life, he acquired an elasticity of mind, which enabled him to make sacrifices and practise self denial, but which also fitted him for yielding easily to the pressure of circumstances and the wickedness of mankind. He was too proud, it must be confessed, of his name and reputation ; and the intensity with which he loved his coun try was regulated by the amount of incense it offered to his vanity. His simplicity and na?vet? of character were</page><page sequence="19">1844.] Gervinus's History of German Poetry. 97 extraordinary. He laid open his whole nature to inspec tion ; and followed out, like a child, all his impulses, though with a certain degree of moderation, ? saying, with the wise men of antiquity, that he wished not to be too happy. In Italy, he learned to harmonize the conflicting elements of his character, ? husbanding his enthusiasm, guiding his straight forwardness with prudence, and mitigating the violence of his passions by quiet and humility. The great work by which Winckelmann is known to fame is his " History of Art." By this, he opened the realms of beauty to his countrymen, and led them into the temple of Grecian art, as Herder did into that of Hebrew wisdom and poetry. The first appearance of Herder in literature was bold and even arrogant. The sensitive, excitable youth, whose nerves were too weak for the practice of medicine, for which he had been designed, and whose retiring and conscientious disposition better fitted him for the profession of theology, which he afterwards followed, came forward at first, anony mously, indeed, but in a style of composition that was fear less, assuming, and ambitious. Though a teacher in his youth, like Winckelmann, he never had, like him, to strug gle with poverty ; he started, also, with this other advantage over his immediate predecessors, that he entered into the harvest of their labors. Favored by fortune, though nev er aided by friendship, for which his shrinking and distrustful disposition made him quite unfit, his gentle, pliable nature acquired elasticity and hardihood. In his early publica tions, which consisted chiefly of critical essays upon litera ture and art, he boldly attacked, though he by no means over threw, the artistic theories of Lessing and the philosophical system of Kant. He advocated his own opinions with strong and genial enthusiasm, and displayed, withal, a liberality of religious sentiment, that did not fail to raise some suspicions of his orthodoxy in the minds of more scrupulous theologi ans. He adopted, in the main, the theological views of Lessing, carrying them, at least, as far as was consistent with his sacred calling, and defending them, together with the philosophy of Spinoza, against the objections of Jacobi. Of all Herder's predecessors and contemporaries, Lessing exerted the greatest influence upon his writings, though Klopstock produced a deeper impression upon his character. Compared with the former, Herder has more feeling, Lessing VOL. LVIII. ?no. 122. 13</page><page sequence="20">98 Gervinus's History of German Poetry. [Jan. more insight. The writings of Lessing abound in convincing demonstrations ; those of Herder, in splendid declamations ; the one having more science and more truth, the other more rhetoric and more error. The former always exhausted his subject, and brought his works to completion ; while the lat ter never published any thing but fragments. But in suscepti bility to the beautiful and noble in the literature of foreign coun tries and distant times, Herder excelled both Lessing and all his other contemporaries. Such was the facility with which he seized upon the characteristics, and such the fidelity with which he reproduced the spirit and form, the tone and color ing, of the literature of all nations, that the haughtiness of the Spaniard, the na?vet? of the Lithuanian, the mild senti mentality of the German, the dashing boldness of English historical romance, the fresh life of the ancient Greek, and the dreamy musings of the Asiatic Indian, the glow of the Southland the gloom of the North, ? all seem to be com prehended within the broad bosom of this one genius. As Winckelmann's " History of Art" unlocked the treasures of Greece, so did Herder's " Spirit of Hebrew Poetry " open the way to the ancient world of the East, whence, as also from all European lands, from the vales of the tropics, and the hills of the North, from Greenland and Peru, he brought home flowers of every form, hue, and scent, to in terweave in the garland of his country's literature. Herder was like an inspired child, ? all sense and feeling, in love with simplicity and nature, and deeply impressed by the mysterious and remote in time or place. His whole life, he once said, was but the interpretation of the oracles of his childhood. Children, women, and men of simple minds were, in his estimation, the most eloquent of orators. He wished he had been born in the Middle Ages ; he gave an ear to prophesyings, and longed to see a ghost. The earli est poetry he always thought the best ; and language in its rudest state, the most poetic. He regarded Greek poetry as not to be compared with the Hebrew ; admired Ossian and the songs of the North American Indians ; and looked upon his treatise on the earliest records of the human race as a new Scripture. He made collections of popular songs, and set a higher value on them than upon the productions of artistic poets, not one of whom could he endure, save Klop stock. His imagination roamed enraptured through the par</page><page sequence="21">1844.] Gervinus's History of German Poetry. 99 adise of the past, and beheld in the distant future a return of the age of gold. The views and principles advanced by Herder in the sec ond stage of his progress were very dissimilar to those enter tained by him in the first. As was the case with Goethe, the revolutionary spirit, with which he was possessed in youth, died out in him long before it did in the nation. Hence, in his " Calligone." and his polemical writings against Kant, we find him both contradicting his former self, and opposing the spirit of the times. In early life, he thought that poetry declined with the progress of civilization ; but now he be lieves in its advance. No longer the idolizer of popular song, he considers that the highest poetry, in which there is a harmonious union of nature and art. He expects the com ing of a future bard, who shall sing in measures the last re sults of philosophy, and even reduce to verse the scientific systems of Copernicus and Buffon. As Goethe, at a later period, discovered something excellent and weighty in the decency of Voltaire, so Herder, the former admirer of the simplicity of nature, now appears as the defender of the French poets, and praises the precision and definiteness of their language as the necessary fruit of refined culture. He, who once complained of the mingling of the beautiful and the good in the works of Klopstock, now adopts for his motto, ? the beautiful, the good, and the true, one and in separable. No longer do we hear him declaim about the unconsciousness of genius, ? he does not believe in it ; no longer does he proclaim the inspiration of feeling, ? he laughs at the Quakers in science, who wait for the anointing of the Spirit ; no longer does he extol the genius of Shak speare, ? he is almost in favor of shutting up the theatres ; no longer is he the advocate even of the freedom of religious opinion, ? he proposes to forbid theological polemics by a royal ordinance, and to expurgate error by fire from every circulating library in the land. Herder went back to the seventeenth century, ? the age, which, like himself, studied antiquity and translated foreign literature, which mixed up the styles of poetry and prose, which divided its interest be tween poetry and theology, ? the age of enthusiasm for pop ular songs and music, and the age, also, of historical learning, culminating in Leibnitz, who, in this respect, was Herder's highest ideal.</page><page sequence="22">JOO Gervinus's History of German Poetry. [Jan. Herder was not without a certain penchant for practical life. He wished that he had received an education which would have better fitted him for living in the midst of men ; that he had devoted himself to the study of mathematics, history, oratory, drawing, nature, mankind, and manners. He proposed to reform the schools by the introduction of realistic studies ; he taught that all methods for reforming mankind, except the cultivation of the more active virtues, served only to enervate them ; regretted that he had become an author ; and lamented the want of those popular accom plishments, which were necessary to make him the centre of extensive social influences. Herder was ambitious to play the same part at the court of Catharine which Voltaire did at that of Frederic ; and, after founding an academy, according to the pattern of his ideal, in Finland, he proposed to apply the principles of Montesquieu to the national education of the natives. The opportunities which he actually had, however, for displaying his skill in the marshalling of affairs, did not turn out very successfully. Being invited by Count William as court preacher to B?ckeburg, he accomplished nothing for the benefit of prince or people, beyond making religion agreeable to the Countess, who was sickly, and concerned about her future state ; and at the court of Weimar, also, whither he was called through the influence of Goethe, he confined himself altogether to comforting the Duchess. We next turn, for a while, to Jean Paul Frederic Rich ter, of Wunsiedel, who was born in 1763, and died in 1825. He is one of those authors, who have the misfortune to be extravagantly admired by one party in literature, and as de cidedly disliked by another. Many persons, after having reached the age when they require their understanding to render an account of their reading, soon become weary of his writings. To others, on the contrary, Richter appeared not a whit less than an apostle ; and sentimental ladies were so smitten with adoration of his genius, as to think themselves honored by wearing a lock, not of the poet's hair, but of his spaniel's, in their bosom. The judgment which Gervi nus passes upon this writer may not satisfy many of his ad mirers either in Germany or in this country ; but it will not appear too severe to the great majority of his countrymen, who do not rank him among their highest poets. Jean Paul's nature, unlike that of Schiller and Goethe, for</page><page sequence="23">1844.] Gervinus's History of German Poetry. 101 example, had but one period of development, and then stood still. Though not altogether unconscious of the imperfection of his spiritual growth, he could never fully understand the saying of Goethe, that one is a different person every ten years. He himself enjoyed throughout life perpetual youth ; and hoped for nothing better than its perpetuation even in heaven. The heats of youthful passion and the fire of early enthusiasm never abated in him. His morale inculcates the purity and innocence of childhood ; and his views generally are so characterized by youthfulness, as to appear rather un suitable for his manhood and his years. His life, too, was one of great uniformity. Little influenced by public events, and little varied by fluctuations of domestic fortune, it was not much more than a peaceful succession of states purely idyllic. His autobiography is a perfect picture of still life, not differing widely from many of his romances ; and was not completed, partly, perhaps, because there were no more facts to be narrated. He grew up in narrow cir cumstances, with little help from the schools, but indifferently well versed in history and the common branches of learn ing, with only a smattering of ancient literature, and a super ficial, though extensive, acquaintance with the sciences. If, however, there was no after-growth in Jean Paul's nature, the first growth was a very rich one. If his actual life was monotonous, that of his imagination was crowded with events the most remarkable, and scenes the most varied and interesting. He derived not much benefit from the teachings of the schools ; but his twelve quarto volumes of extracts, completed before his entrance into the university, certainly exhibit the diligence and perseverance of the self educated scholar. Composition was almost a monomania with Jean Paul. He began to write books as soon as he had learned to form his letters, ? kept diaries, both religious and secular, ? even noted down subjects for conversation on a tablet, ? had at one time collected together no less than twenty thick quartos of ironical expressions, and a still larg er number of satirical ones, ?became an author before he was out of his teens, ? and, instead of devoting his youth to the collection of materials for future use, reaped the fruits of his learning while they were yet green and half grown. He drank wine to enliven his wits at the writing-desk, instead of satisfying the demands of appetite with it at the table ; and</page><page sequence="24">102 Gervinus's History of German Poetry. [Jan. thought, at the end of each day's labors, that he was nearer to an easy death, in proportion as he had diminished, by writing, the wearisome burden of thoughts that weighed upon his brain. His youth was poor indeed in worldly goods ; but in feelings, fancies, and domestic joys, it was very rich. With the help of a little music and moonshine, a few holy day visits to town, and the pursuit of a village maiden indif ferently pretty, he enjoyed an income of spiritual delights, not to be exchanged for the gold of millionnaires or the jew els of princes. Nearly all the characteristic elements of the times are to be found united in his writings, ? the heartless ness of its satire, its sickly excess of sentiment, the " cha mois leaps " of its wild, irregular fantasy, the sober views of its sound understanding, both its love and hatred of the world, its idealism, its realism, and its spirituality. At the same time, his productions are all strict transcripts of his inward life. He is constantly drawing away the attention of the reader from the work to its author. We recognize his own peculiarities in Fixlein, his own home attachments in Wuz and Fibel, the petty foibles of his first authorship in the " Wild Oats," and the portraits of his personal friends in the heroes of the " Titan." The pages of Jean Paul sparkle with the most brilliant coruscations of wit and fancy; yet his humorous, like his heroic characters, are too often mere caricatures. On the whole, it must be said, that his works abound more in reflections than in facts, in sentiments than in truths, and less in the description of actions, than in visions, dreams, allegories, and whatever else there may be that is fantastic and unreal. " These," says Gervinus, " are the two extremes on which every thing turns in this writer. On the one side, he is offended with the world, he turns away from men with contempt, and an nihilates the external universe with scorn ; on the other side, he attaches himself to still life, retires into the realms of the spirit, and finds again his lost worldly weal in the quiet of narrow cir cumstances, and in silent communion with his hopes of a better future. To the first mood of mind, we are indebted for his hu morous characters, who carry their raillery against the world to a disgust with it ; to the second, for his soft, self-conceited per sonages, who unite an utter ignorance of men with an infinite love for the welfare of the entire race. The one class of per sons sink, on occasions, to the most contemptible meanness ;</page><page sequence="25">1844.] Gervinus's History of German Poetry. 103 while the ' flower-souls ' of the second class exalt themselves to the extreme of the author's so called noble characters, who turn their backs on the world to preserve themselvs from its pol lution, and discover that the highest purity of soul is inconsistent with habits of active usefulness. On the one hand, Jean Paul is skeptical, satirical, a persecutor of German coxcombry, and a realist in his manner of representation, as is generally the case with youth when it falls into this extreme ; on the other hand, he is sentimental, weak, inflated, elegiac, and a spiritualist, such as is rarely to be met with. If in the first direction he heaps up wit beyond measure, and overtasks the powers of the under standing ; so, in the second, he goes too.far in the excitement of sensibility, and in his tendency to tears, to which, like Sterne, he is very fond of moving his readers." The most important fruits of Jean Paul's genius are the " Titan," and the " Wild Oats,"^ (Flegeljahre.) The for mer of these seems to have been intended for a side picture to Goethe's " Wilhelm Meister," and, though to a great ex tent a reproduction of the " Hesperus," ?as many of Rich ter's later productions are mere repetitions of their predeces sors,? is generally considered as the author's masterpiece. In the latter, we are presented with a picture of the chivalry of early feeling, of the mad fancies which are wont to chase each other through the brains of youth, of winter plays around the paternal hearth, of quiet domestic joys, of first love, of Sunday homesickness, and of every thing, in fact, which thrills the young and generous bosom, such as can be found on the pages of no other writer. The religious views of Richter may be best learned from his treatise on immor tality, entitled the cc Campanian Vale," (Campanerthal,) in which, adopting the doctrine of the Critical Philosophy, he predicated the existence of a future life on the consid eration, that another and a higher state of being is necessary for the perfect development of the good, the true, and the beautiful. His religion consisted in living for immortali ty and the Divinity. He always despised earthly fame, as men of the highest genius are not wont to do ; and in his youth, wished to learn nothing but what would be useful to him in the life to come. He stood with but one foot on the present stage of existence, ever ready, pen, ink, and paper in hand, to step off with the other upon the future. Passing from the modern Gothic style of Richter, we find at last the restoration of ancient classic beauty in the works</page><page sequence="26">104 Gervinus's History of German Poetry. [Jan. of Schiller and Goethe. To these two poets our author has devoted upwards of two hundred pages ; but the nar row limits within which we are restricted, and the length of time we have already trespassed upon the patience of our readers, will not allow us to do more than cast a hasty glance upon their characters and writings. If we were to attempt to characterize Goethe with a sin gle word, we should say, that he was an optimist. He be held imperfections both in nature and humanity, but also a great tendency to amelioration, ? a great, universal law of progress, slowly and silently, yet everywhere and irresisti bly, evolving good out of evil. This progression, more over, he was not at all anxious to accelerate beyond its natural pace, by any forced activity of his own. He put no spurs in the sides of his intent ; but allowing free play and scope to the forces with which he had been endowed, ever kept his mind in a state of healthy and genial action. He constantly defended himself against all external influences that might disturb the serene equanimity of his feelings, or that might stimulate the warm glow of thought into feverish excitement. The discord of human opinions appeared to him to grow entirely out of the diversity of human charac ter, ? all systems of faith or philosophy, however contradic tory in appearance, to be founded on essentially the same great, universal principles, ?and every error, so called, to be only a different phase of truth, which, under an infinite variety of forms, is one and the same for ever. He was, accordingly, tolerant of the views of those who disagreed with him ; and did not think it essential either to the present or future salvation of others, that they should be converted to precisely his way of thinking. He was content to study Nature as she is, and asked not of her the questions, ? Whence, or Whither. Little interested, in fact, in the his tory of the past, and wholly disinclined to any speculations respecting the future, he lived cheerfully and actively in the everlasting present. Having a character built up, as the Germans say, on every side, he was a good hater of systems of philosophy, as narrow and onesided ; and, experiencing in himself as many as three or four entirely new evolutions of nature, he abjured all creeds an*d formulas of belief, as hin dering the mind from progress. One of the great principles which guided the life of</page><page sequence="27">1844.] Gervinus's History of German Poetry. 105 Goethe may be found in the sentiment expressed by Cicero, in his beautiful tract De Senectute, ? u In hoc sumus sapien tes, quod naturam optimam ducem, tamquam deum, sequi mur, eique paremus." Of a delicate organization, the com munion of nature was more agreeable to Goethe, than the society of men. He guarded his individuality of character from the too near approaches even of friendship and love ; but nestled confidingly as a child in the kindly bosom of mother earth, and received the breath of his life from the in spiration of this great mother. In this great genius, as in the material world, the most mighty and discordant forces were blended together in peaceful harmony ; and the ex pression which characterizes both his life and works is kind and calm, like that which rests upon the face of nature. The perfect man, he taught, is one whose faculties, of what kind soever, are all fully and naturally developed, the lower being in willing subjection to the higher. Pantheistic in his religious belief, he held to no self-determining principle in the individual soul, and considered the freedom of the mind to consist in nothing more than the harmony of its faculties. His motto was, Vivere memento. Goethe was an artist, ?nothing more, nor less. Schiller wrote history and dabbled in metaphysics, though he had no talent for pure speculation, and his history is but little bet ter than fiction ; but Goethe never left the mountain of the Muses. He was a naturalist, it is true, yet his observations of nature were all made on the Parnassian heights, and along the banks of the Castalian waters. He viewed life poeti cally only, and converted all things to artistic uses. When in Italy, he set a higher value even on the shadows of an^ cient art, than upon the human beings who were wont to re pose under them ; and could conceive of no two things more undesirable, than to rebuild the picturesque desolations of the Eternal City, and to cultivate again the sublime wastes of the surrounding campagna. So exclusively was his life consecrated to the service of Apollo, that he turned away from the study of the facts of history, avoided all philosophi cal investigations, and abjured the habits of reflection and self-examination, in order the better to preserve unimpaired his power of poetical creation. His whole experience was written out in poetry, or in fiction. Whatever there is gay or sad in his writings was first in his life ; and it is to the VOL.

[Jan. short but severe struggles of the world within and without him, that we owe all the early, and some of the most impor tan1, productions of his muse. The author of " Faust " was lavishly endowed by nature with those transcendent gifts which are requisite to make the epic poet. But much to his regret, he was not bora in an epic age. Accordingly, in the absence of heroic deeds wor thy of the lyre, he was obliged to seek in the great ideas of his times for the themes of song. These, however, he was not obliged to search for without the limits of his own capa cious intellect ; for in that was matured the highest wisdom of the age. Many of the profound truths laboriously ex cogitated by Hegel and the ablest contemporary metaphysi cians of Germany sprang up spontaneously in the mind of Goethe, and have received from his pen their fit poetical expression. And besides uttering in verse all the wisdom of his own times, he has, also, in some of his works, repro duced the chivalry of the Middle Ages, and in others the un conscious beauty of the ancient Greeks. He has written every species of poetry ; and, especially, has touched the lyre with all the lightness and grace of the old lyrical mas ters. If Goethe was created an epic poet, Schiller was born a dramatist. More fortunate in his natal star than the former, the latter lived in an age that furnished a most appropriate theatre for the exercise of his art and the display of his gifts. The nature of Schiller was in harmony with the ten dencies of the times. He was patriotic, and struggled for freedom. He knew men, sympathized with the people, stood shoulder to shoulder with his fellows in the great revolutionary conflicts, and was thought worthy by the French republicans to be honored with a diploma of citi zenship from "the great nation." But Goethe knew only man ; led, never growing old, a high ideal life ; and on arriving, advanced in years, at the summit of his career, he found no broad table-land whereon to wrestle for the prizes of life with his peers, but at once descended on the other side, unattended, into the valley of shadows. Schil ler was a poet in spite of hinderances, and may almost be said to have taken the seat of the Muses by storm. Goethe sang from instinctive impulse, and appeared in the society of Apollo and the Gods like one in his native home. The</page><page sequence="29">1844.] Gervinus's History of German Poetry. 107 tragic poet quickened the pulse of his life by artificial stim ulants, overstrained his powers, and was possessed by his genius. The epic poet, pouring forth in song the thoughts that oppressed his breast, arose, relieved from his labors, like a strong man refreshed with sport. True, Schiller di rected his impulses towards his chosen aims ; but it was like guiding a bark borne down by the rapids ; while Goethe, fol lowing the instinctive promptings of nature, floated along up on a peaceful current at its " own sweet will." The poetry of Schiller is subjective ; that of Goethe objective. Schil ler adores freedom ; Goethe worships nature. The former acknowledges the moral law of conscience, and exalts the true, the beautiful, and the good. The latter inculcates the harmony of all laws, unfolds the wisdom and beauty of things as they are, and makes common life poetical. The one stimulates us to the pursuit of unattainable ends ; the other teaches us wisely to improve our actual possessions, and cheerfully to strive after possible perfections. Schiller was a priest of the ideal, Goethe an interpreter of the real world. The same contrast exists between these two minds, which, running through all literary history, is to be seen between Plato and Aristotle, Epicurus and Zeno, Rousseau and Vol taire, Tasso and Ariosto, Lope and Calder?n, Klopstock and Wieland, Herder and Lessing. " Chronologically," says Gervinus, " the oppositions of the real and the ideal lay in nearly an inverted relation in these two poets. Goethe proceeded more from a real towards an ideal tendency ; Schiller, after his acquaintance with Goethe and the ancients, endeavoured to approach the real from the opposite point of the ideal. The latter went back from speculation to poetical intuition ; the former from poetical intuition advanced, if not to speculation, at least to contemplation ; and while, in the traces of Goethe, there followed Oriental spiritualism, in those of Schiller, there came stanch patriotism, both in life and in poetry. The most obvious characteristics of their works were, therefore, altogether different from what would have been expected from their natural endowments. The poet most inclined to the prac tical and the material became the more exalted in his style of composition. The one who lived in the ideal world of art is, for many persons, too natural. Each hindered the other from falling into extremes ; and accordingly, the lofty and often pro found Schiller has been more generally admired, while the plain er and essentially more popular Goethe has been appropriated</page><page sequence="30">108 Gervinus's History of German Poetry. [Jan. by the aristocratic class of society. He who in his aims had the most reference to men, has remained the favorite of women and youth ; but he who abode in perennial youth has satisfied best the wants of man. The one who was all form and spirit pleased the people ; but the one who both sought and gave more of matter delighted the cultivated few, who are better able to appreciate form. The genius apparently the most richly en dowed has been confined within a narrower circle of influence ; and the one apparently less gifted has found a more exten sive one ; ? as Goethe himself said, if Schiller was gener ally esteemed less rich and productive, it was because his spirit streamed forth into all life, furnishing nutriment to, and supply ing the deficiencies of, all men. Accordingly, the lines of the capacious nature of both cross each other in directions so vari ous, that it is only when thus bound together, that they present us with one entire whole, in which we ought, without division, to delight and edify ourselves, as was, indeed, the intention of the men themselves." Here we are compelled to pause ; and, however reluc tant, to pass by, unnoticed, many of the brilliant authors whose names emblazon the page of recent German litera ture ; ? the mystical Novalis (Frederic von Hardenberg), who aimed at nothing less than to breathe the spirit of poet ry into all literature, science, and life, ; the noble, though passive, and somewhat feminine, genius of the Schlegels, who laid the foundations of the new science of literary history ; Tieck, the humorous and romantic reproducer of the fable of the Middle Ages ; Fouqu?, to whom we are indebted for the popular romance of u Undine," the delight of youth ; K?rner, him of the lyre and sword, who in the cause of his country's freedom both sang and bled ; Uhland, whose mediaeval ballads have produced the happiest effects upon recent German poetry, and whose songs of liberty and pa triotism stand like a phalanx, firm amid the changes of liter ature ; and, finally, Frederick R?ckert, who may be cited as the representative of the new Minnesong, whose power of rhythm is incomparable, whose imagery glows with all the gorgeousness of the Orient, and whose sweet, musical lyrics are even inferior to his profound, though light and airy, epi grams. Gervinus closes his history with the death of Goethe. Since that event, German poetry has degenerated, and be come technical in form, and subjective in spirit.

There must be a new develop ment of German life ; the practical, as well as the ideal, side of the national character must be built up ; there must arise some political Luther to introduce into the trades the freedom which is so largely enjoyed in religion, and so to modify the civil polity of the land, as to give to the German in future as ample liberty to act, as for the last half century he has had to think. Then first will our eyes be greeted with the dawn of another golden age of German poesy, of a poetic future which may be more spiritual, without pre senting less of material beauty, than the past ; in which the reflection of years may be added to the passion of youth ; and wherein, we may believe, will be harmoniously blended the various elements of all preceding literary epochs, ? the valor of the ancient bards with the love of the sweet singers of chivalry, the religion of Klopstock with the gayety of Wieland, the nationality of Lessing with the universality of Herder, and the soul of Schiller's verse with the form of Goethe's.</page></plain_text>
