<plain_text><page sequence="1">PATTERN AND THEME IN CHR?TIEN'S 'YVAIN' By EDWARD C. SCHWEITZER Yvain, Chr?tien's masterpiece, has been conventionally seen as a counter poise to Erec et Enide, attempting to reconcile the conflicting claims of love and chivalry.1 The several versions of this interpretation are misleading, if not quite wrong, because they divert our attention from what is special about Yvain to what it has in common with Erec. In all of them the lion is peripheral, although for Chr?tien himself the lion gave the romance its name: Le Chevalier au lion.2 I intend to argue that Yvain is rather a critique of the Arthurian ideal, using patristic ? or, if one prefers, Christian ? psychology to show its hero fall victim to the sins of superbia, invidia, and ira in the first part and triumph over them in the second. Chr?tien, I propose, made the lion a symbol of ira as a power of the soul and as ambivalent emotion, so that the two-part figure of the Chevalier au Lion ? Yvain with his lion ? dramatizes the restoration of ideal order within Yvain himself. Since the story of Yvain derives almost certainly from a Celtic source, Chr?tien's originality consists not in the main events but in their disposition and in the emphasis assigned them in order to reveal their psychological and moral significance.3 I shall use comparisons with the Welsh story of Owein and the Lady of the Fountain to set that originality in relief, for whether the Welsh romance itself is the ultimate source of Yvain or both develop from some common source, it very likely 1 E.g.

References to this edition are made in the body of the text. 3 So I understand Chr?tien's reference in the prologue to. Erec et Enide (ed. Mario Roques [CFMA 80; Paris 1966] 13-14) to the 'molt bele conjointure' which should be drawn from a 'conte d'avanture.' It seems the easiest and most satisfactory reading, although conjointure is glossed as ' Anlass' by W. Foerster, Christian von Troyes S?mtliche Werke III (Halle 1890) 297-98, and A. Tobler and E. Lommatzsch, Altfranz?sisches W?rterbuch II (Berlin 1936) 696. See D. \V.

Yvain, on the other hand, is distinguished, as this essay will try to show, by Chr?tien's use of a progression of parallel incidents, together with the symbolic figure of the lion, to reveal gradually the meaning of the whole. I The opening scene in which Calogrenant recounts his visit to the magic spring serves as an overture to what follows. It establishes the thematic frame of violent disruption and harmonious order within which the characters of the romance move, it reveals the psychological forces which guide them, and it puts in question the courtly ideal of love and chivalry which Chr?tien aims to explore and redefine. Arthur is immediately referred to as Artus, li boens rois de Bretaingne la cui proesce nos enseigne que nos soiens preu et cortois. (1-3) His knights are ' li boen chevalier esle?, / qui a enor se traveillierent ' (39-40). His court sets a standard against which the present world appears degenerate. Love in particular has been much debased, declares Chr?tien, now that those who know nothing about it lie and say they love. Yet the disarray of the scene to which he turns is delicately pointed up by the rich feminine rhyme traveil lierent-merveillierent between lines 41 and 42: a enor se treveillierent. Mes eel jor molt se merveillierent. Though Arthur, the paragon of chivalry whose example continues to inspire us, has never before withdrawn from so great a celebration to rest in his chamber, he does so now. The exceptional 'mes eel jor' is repeated seven lines later. More, 4 The Mabinogion, trans. Gwynn Jones and Thomas Jones (Everyman's Library; London and New York 1949) 155-82.

(50-52) Calogrenant is, as one would expect, ' molt avenanz, ' but here he has begun to tell his companions 'un conte, / non de s'annor, mes de sa honte.' The sensation one has of being witness to a scene not intended for public view is strengthened first by the queen's stealth as, having overheard the beginning of Calogrenant's story, she creeps out of Arthur's chamber, then by the startled reaction of the knights to her sudden appearance. The qualifying clause which follows is disconcerting, since it refers back to nus in line 65, and with its stress on sudden upward movement (sanz plus, sailli, sus) forces the reader to share verbally the knights' shock after the climactic swoop of cheoir (66). Keu's words intensify the embarrassing nature of the incident. His sarcasm, indeed, has an especially insidious effect on the courtly ideal propounded in the prologue by simultaneously echoing and denying it: 'Par Deu, Qualogrenant, molt vos voi or preu et saillant, et certes molt m'est bel quant vos estes li plus eortois de nos.' (71-74) The queen's rebuke, ' Enuieus estes, et vilains, de tancier a voz conpaignons, ' (90-91) is obviously justified, as are Calogrenant's uncourtly references to gadflies, bees, and manure. Yet Keu is the first of Arthur's good chosen knights whom Chr?tien presents in any detail, and therefore his words control our perception of the entire scene. His scurrilous behavior, moreover, is no momentary failing. The notatio with which Chr?tien introduces him (69-70), Calogrenant's response (112-15), and the queen's half-apology (131-35) demonstrate that this is how Keu usually behaves. Even Guinevere falls far short of an ideal courtesy. She insists on hearing the story which drew her from Arthur's bed, despite Calogrenant's reluctance, expressed first with elegant deprecation (120-23), then with a vigor which leaves behind the heavy odor of coercion: 'Certes, dame, ce m'est molt grief que vos me comandez a feire; einz me leissasse un des danz traire, se correcier ne vos dotasse, que je hui mes rien lor contasse.' (142-46) He makes the same point yet again when he has finished (579-80).</page><page sequence="4">148 TRADITIO The Suggestion of a vague moral disorder within the embodiment of the putative ideal is unmistakable in the opening scene of Yvain, but Chr?tien has deliberately developed it. It is absent in Owein. No one there wonders at Arthur's sleep, and before he retires he expresses only the anxiety that his court might make game of him (155). The story which Cynon (Calogrenant's opposite number) tells is the 'best tale we know,' of 'the most wondrous thing* (155, 156). Cei is an original, prickly enough to suggest Chr?tien's Keu but lacking his envious and slanderous malice. Cynon's repeated interjections ? such as, was sure, Cei' ? set a tone of camaraderie. Cynon's emphasis on the reality of the tawny-black palfrey with a red mane which he brought back from the castle where he was lodged after his own horse was led away by the Black Knight of the Fountain (161) diverts our attention and that of his fictional audience from his defeat. He concedes that he has known of no greater failure, yet what continues to puzzle him is that he has never heard any more about so strange an adventure. A desire to experience the marvellous is the sole motive of Owein's quest. Gwenhwyfar immediately and masterfully rebukes Cei's challange to Owein, and Cei apologizes gracefully. The discrepancy between the courtly ideal and its manifestation on this Pentecost at Carduel is especially striking in Chr?tien's Yvain, but Calogrenant's prologue to his story hints at a less obvious defect in Arthur's court. Calo grenant insists on the literal truth of his tale. He urges his audience to listen attentively and not to disregard any particular, because everything he is about to say is true. In its large outlines the story of his defeat beside the magic spring is humiliating, and he wants the extraordinary and extenuating circumstances, which are not fabulous, to be carefully considered. He makes this plea again more briefly just before he describes the moment of his defeat: ' Par mi le voir, ce sachiez bien, m'an vois por ma honte covrir. ' (526-27) His motivation is psychologically convincing, particularly in the presence of the sarcastic Keu. Nevertheless, the very language he uses to plead his case endows his narrative with a parabolical resonance which suggests that it does contain a core of meaning which may not yet be understood. His insistent distinction between words heard by the ears and words understood by the heart recalls the language in which parables are presented in the New Testa ment: Ideo in parabolis loquor eis: quia videntes non vident, et audientes non audiunt, neque intelligunt. Et adimpletur in eis prophetia Isaiae dicentis [6.9-10]: Auditu audietis, et non intelligetis: et videntes videbitis, et non videbitis. Incrassatum est enim cor populi huius, et auribus graviter audierunt, et oculos suos clauserunt: ne quando videant oculis, et auribus audiant, et corde intelligant, et convertantur, et sanem eos. (Matt. 13.13-15)</page><page sequence="5">Chretien's 'yvain' 149 Exegetes explain these paradoxes as symptoms of a general spiritual deficiency of which the Jews' failure to understand Christ's words was but a signal instance, and Calogrenant's language suggests a corresponding deficiency in Arthur's court. Rabanus Maurus, for example, explains why the crowds to which Jesus preached heard but did not understand: Nunc apostolis reddit causam quare turbis loquatur in parabolis, ut qui superba intentione se videntes, sive audientes aestimabant, et suo ingenio confidentes omnia secreta divinae eruditionis penetrare se posse arbitra bantur, et ob hoc magisterio coelesti se subdere nolebant, simplicibus et humilibus mysteria coelestia agnoscentibus, ipsi vacui intellectu spiritali remanerent. . . . Habent visum et auditum corporis extrinsecus, et semetipsos privaverunt visu et auditu cordis intrinsecus.5 He even proceeds to give the same passage a generalized literary interpreta tion.6 The relevance of these allusions, of course, is only potential. They do not explain the meaning of Calogrenant's story, but they arouse in the reader the expectation that it has a meaning which will be revealed. If allowed, the Biblical and exegetical context gives point to the contrast between Calo grenant's humility and the pride of the other members of the court ? a contrast which further distinguishes the second part of the romance from the first and Yvain as the Chevalier au Lion from Gauvain ? and to the superficiality of Arthur's response to the story as a mere collection of marvels. Certainly Calogrenant seems aware that he has experienced a great mystery, and his entire encounter with the bestial bullherd suggests a depth of meaning beyond that of the corresponding episode in Owein. The grotesque comedy of the churl's repetition (356-57) of Calogrenant's own question (328-33) should not obscure its disconcerting penetration. It sets the churl, quietly tending his herd of wild bulls, against Calogrenant on his quest as if one were a distorted reflection of the other. The correlation, once noted, cannot be ignored. By his very existence the churl qualifies the validity of the courtly ideal, for its representative betrays his narrowness of outlook in asking, 'Se tu es boene chose ou non.' The unanswerable simplicity of the churl's reply, 'Et il me dist qu'il ert uns horn, ' is laughable, but Calogrenant's corresponding answer ? 'Je sui, fet il, uns chevaliers, qui quier ce que trover ne puis' ? 5 Comment, in Matt. (PL 107.942). Similarly Jerome, Comment, in Math. (GGL 77.103-04), Bede, In Evang.

(PL 107.942).</page><page sequence="6">150 TRADITIO is more superficial and less satisfactory than it appears and is no more self evident than the churl's. For the romance as a whole forcefully poses the questions: what sort of man is Calogrenant?and Yvain, who takes up his quest ? and, further, in what sense are they chevaliers. In the large view, the churl, tending his herd of bulls, is no more amoral than Calogrenant. He is, as he remarks, again with disarming simplicity, 'master of his beasts.' Evi dently that is a remarkable achievement. Calogrenant at first refuses to believe its possibility: ' Gardes ? Par saint Pere de Rome, ja ne conuissent eles home; ne cuit qu'an plain ne an boschage puisse an garder beste sauvage, n'en autre leu, por nule chose, s'ele n'est l'?ee et ancl?se. ' (333-38) No other man could step among them without being killed (352-54), yet the churl not only keeps watch over his herd of bulls; he controls them as well: ' Je gart si cestes et justis que ja n'istront de cest porpris. ' (339-40) Calogrenant's disbelief makes the fact more outstanding and one wrhich we should recall when we encounter the single other character in Yvain who is master of a beast. The emphasis put upon the detail seems meaningful only in retrospect. At this point it can merely serve as a clue to the meaning of what follows. The 'big black man' whom Cynon meets in Owein, who is 'keeper of that forest,' around whom a thousand wild animals graze, and who can summon a multitude of other animals of all kinds to do him obeisance (158-59), clearly betrays his descent from some anthropomorphic forest spirit; Chr?tien's churl has been transformed into a figure of moral significance. The churl's occupation puts Calogrenant's quest in an ambiguous light, and Chr?tien tellingly juxtaposes the bullherd's final assertion of mastery over his beasts with his superficially impertinent question to Calogrenant; the prefix re- of redevroies stresses the interrelationship of the two speakers: 'Einsi sui de mes bestes sire, et tu me redevroies dire quiex hom tu ies, et que tu quiers. ' (355-57) The comedy here is fine spun. The churl's ignorance is extravagant, and the answers to his questions outrageously obvious to any connoisseur of chivalric romances, though not, of course, to him. Yet one must smile at the painfully dignified form of Calogrenant's answer to those questions, which are inevitably awkward precisely because they are so simple, and smile again when the churl</page><page sequence="7">Chretien's 'yvain' 151 will not let him escape but asks more pointedly, ' Et que voldroies tu trover ? ' Galogrenant's first response, moreover, suggests by its abstractness a meta physical dimension to his quest: ' Je sui, fet il, uns chevaliers qui quier ce que trover ne puis; assez ai quis, et riens ne truis' ? (358-60) a dimension against which ' avanture, por esprover ma proesce et mon hardemant' seems trivial, even if one denies any allusion to Christ's promise ' quaerite, et invenietis' (Matt. 7.7) in Calogrenant's curious stress ? repeating both verbs ? on his seeking and not finding.7 The allusion need not be insisted upon too strongly. It creates a further resonance and deepens the shadow thrown over aventure by its bathetic place ment after the grandiose abstraction quier; it does not radically alter the effect of the dialogue. Its relevance seems likely, however, when we look ahead to the religious cast given Yvain's quest of retribution as the Chevalier au Lion by the repeated invocation of God's will. In addition, Augustine, ex plaining Matthew 7.7 ('Petite, et dabitur vobis; quaerite, et invenietis; pulsate, et aperietur vobis'), concentrates on the metaphorical door implicit in pulsate and aperietur, makes the three imperatives successive stages in a quest for truth, and so makes the correspondence between Christ's sermon and Calo grenant's quest closer.8 Chr?tien's contemporary, Peter Riga, likewise regards the verse as the description of an ongoing search; in his popular versified Bible and commentary, the Aurora, he makes that same metaphorical door the gate of the kingdom of heaven, located, as one knows, at the end of a narrow road from which it is easy to go astray.9 The churl will caution Calogrenant in the next lines not to wander from the straight path to the spring. These 7 In Owein (159) the corresponding exchange is flat though it contains, in embryo, most of the crucial details developed by Chr?tien: 'And he said to me, "Dost see then, little man, the power I have over these animals?" And then I asked the way of him, and he was rough with me, but even so he asked me where I wanted to go, and I told him what kind of man I was and what I was seeking, and he then showed me. "Take," said he, "the path to the head of the clearing, . . ."' There is no other path and no possibility of missing the way. Nor is anything made of the giant's power over the animals. 8 De sem. Domini in monte 2.21.72 (CGL 35.169-70). More generally, Augustine repeatedly quotes or alludes to Matt. 7.7 in his E narr, in Ps. while he attempts to penetrate to the mystery of a difficult text, 33.S.1.1, 74.11, 93.1, 103.S.2.1, 146.12 (CGL 38.273, 39.1032, 1300, 40.1492, 2130-31). 9 Evang. 1334-35, ed.

The ensuing confusion over aventure is, on the surface, another trivial joke at the expense of the rustic's ignorance of courtly life. The bullherd tells Calogrenant that he does not know about any aventure or mervoille, but, he says, he can direct him to a nearby spring: ' Mes se tu voloies aler ci pr?s jusqu'? une fontainne n'en revandroies pas sanz painne, se ne li randoies son droit. Ci pr?s troveras or en droit un santier qui la te manra. Tote la droite voie va, se bien viax tes pas anploier, que tost porroies desvoier: il i a d'autres voies mout. ' (370-79) The spring will in fact prove to be more than a test of prowess and courage, for Yvain if not for Calogrenant. Calogrenant, to be sure, remains motivated by mere curiosity: ' La mervoille a veoir me plot de la tanpeste et de l'orage.' (432-33) Except for his defeat, the episode at the spring is essentially a conventional aventure which establishes a norm against which the later adventures can be measured. The contrast between the violence of the storm (439-50) and the spellbinding beauty of the polyphonous song of the birds in the tree which follows it (458-77) and signals the reaffirmation of divine order (451-54)11 10 Such an interpretation has been presented by Maxwell S. Luria, 'The Storm-making Spring and the Meaning of Chretien's Yvain,' SP 64 (1967) 576-85. 11 The birds' song in Owein (160-61) is also superlatively beautiful but there is no mention of the harmonious relationship of parts, the most remarkable feature of the song from Calo grenant's point of view. Consequently it cannot suggest, as the birds' song does in Yvain, the Platonic notion of the power of music to order the parts of the human soul and to bring them into harmonious consort. Calcidius' commentary on Timaeus 47 c-d is authoritative (Timaeus a Calcidio translatus commentarioque instructus, ed. J. H. Waszink [Corpus Platoni cum Medii Aevi; London and Leiden 1962] 272): ' Quantumque per uocem utilitatis capitar ex musica, totum hoc constat hominum generi propter harm?ni?m tributum, quia iuxta rationem harmonicam animam in superioribus aedificauerat naturalemque eius actum rhythmis modisque constare dixerat, sed haec exolescere animae ob consortium corporis necessario</page><page sequence="9">Chretien's 'yvain' 153 provides a fundamentally affective matrix which is rendered meaningful by such subsequent details as Yvain's swoon with a torbeillon in his head12 and the reconciliation between Yvain and Laudine which follows the final storm. The mood of regret which is clear in the lines following Calogrenant's expression of delight at the prospect of witnessing the storm and tempest is more imme diately important: ' La mervoille a veoir me plot de la tanpeste et de l'orage, don je ne me ting mie a sage; que volontiers m'an rapantisse tot maintenant, se je po?sse, quant je oi le perron erose de l'?ve au bacin arose. ' (432-38) His desire to undo his having poured water on the stone is the first enunciation of a fundamental and increasingly prominent theme of the romance: the unfortunate consequences of thoughtless knight-errantry. The sense of pervasive mystery, which can still be felt in the tone of quiet humility on which Calogrenant's narrative ends (550-80), is successively dissi pated, first by Yvain's brash exclamation of comradely concern, 'Par mon chief, fet mes sire Yvains, / vos estes mes cosins germains' (581-82ff.); then by Keu's sarcastic attack upon Yvain (590-611) together with Guinevere's and Yvain's responses (612-48); and finally by the bluff heartiness of Arthur's triple oath to see the marvels by St. John's Eve (661-72). As the queen recounts the story to Arthur 'mot a mot,' its world is transferred to the plane of con ventional chivalric romance, the plane of Owein. The world of Car duel is shown to be a diminished world which does not look beyond surfaces. And similarly, it is impossible not to feel the irony, underscored by the rhyme oscurtez-asseiirez, in Yvain's relief when he at last reaches the obtinente obliuione proptereaque immodulatas fore animas plurimorum. Medelam huius uitii dicit esse in musica positam, non in ea qua uulgus delectatur quaeque ad uoluptatem facta excit?t uitia non numquam, sed in illa diuina, quae numquam a ratione atque intelli gentia separetur; hanc enim censet exorbitantes animas a uia recta reuocare demum ad symphoniam ueterem. Optima porro symphonia est in moribus nostris iustitia, uirtutum omnium princip?lis, per quam ceterae quoque uirtutes suum munus atque opus exequuntur, ut ratio quidem dux sit, uigor uero intimus, qui est iracundiae similis, auxiliatorem se rationi uolens praebeat. ' In the course of this essay I shall urge the large-scale relevance of this Platonic conception of justice in the human soul to the relationship between Yvain and his lion. 12 Roques (230) glosses this word 'vertige,' and F. Godefroy, Dictionnaire de l'ancienne langue fran?aise VII (Paris 1892) 748, adds the synonyms 'trouble,' '?tourdissement' but cites only the use in Yvain, where the sense is obviously transferred from the primary accep tation, 'whirlwind,' as modern French 'tourbillon.' See the verb tourbeillier and the adjec tive torbeilloneus in Godefroy. Chr?tien similarly uses tempeste, 2946,</page><page sequence="10">154 TRADITIO santier estroit plain de ronces et d'oscurtez; et lors fu il asse?rez qu'il ne pooit mes esgarer. (768-71) For he ignores entirely the moral dimension of this geography, implied so strongly by Calogrenant's narrative and re-emphasized here where the land scape is less particular and therefore vaster in the range of its suggestiveness, while he plunges further and further into its shadows. II Calogrenant's account of his quest suggests in general terms an ambivalent view of the conventional courtly ideal, of which Arthur's court is nominally the embodiment. As presented by Chr?tien, the court falls short even of that ideal. Yvain's quest, which begins by following in Calogrenant's path, further examines that ideal and anatomizes in special detail the psychological forces which motivate it. Chr?tien's perceptions are accurate insights into how human beings in fact behave. Yet it must be axiomatic that recognition of a general pattern separates knowledge of particular facts from understanding of them. Such theory is not likely to be individual, however individual the perceptions which it accommodates. I would suggest that the theory which orders Chr?tien's individual observations is patristic psychology and that it can illuminate the interrelationship between characters and between events. Keu's symptoms are familiar. It is hardly necessary to point out that he is 'molt. . . ranponeus, / fei et piegnanz et venimeus' (69-70) because he is so consumed with invidia that he is virtually the incarnation of that sin. The brutal sarcasm he directs against Calogrenant immediately betrays the motiva tion of his attack: 'Par Deu, Qualogrenant, molt vos voi or preu et saillant, et certes molt m'est bel quant vos estes li plus cortois de nos. . . . S'est droiz que ma dame le cuit que vos avez plus que nos tuit de corteisie et de proesce: ja le leissames por peresce, espoir, que non ne nos lev?mes ou por ce que nos ne deignames. ' (71-82) He cannot endure the thought that anyone might seem more valiant or courtly than he or that he might be accused of sloth or pride. He does not even dare take the chance that his sarcasm might not be recognized, and so he is driven to</page><page sequence="11">Chretien's 'yvain' 155 deny explicitly the charge which his manner suggests he thinks has actually been made: ' Mes par Deu, sire, nel fe?smes, mes por ce que nos ne ve?smes ma dame, ainz fustes vos levez.' (83-85) Yvain rightly anticipates that Keu will ask to joust first with the Knight of the Fountain (682-86), and it should come as no surprise to learn that Keu always wants to be the first to fight, whatever the outcome, and is furious if he cannot (2230-35). The intimately related sins of superbia and invidia act together to make one always strive to put oneself first. It must be clear that superbia and especially invidia are more fundamental and wider in implication than their English equivalents 'pride' and 'envy.' In the De Genesi ad litteram Augustine defined superbia as 'amor propriae ex cellentiae' and linked it necessarily with invidia to explain the fall of the angels and of man: porro autem inuidia sequitur superbiam, non praecedit; non enim causa superbiendi est inuidia, sed causa inuidiendi superbia, cum igitur superbia sit amor excellentiae propriae, inuidentia uero sit odium felicitatis alienae, quid unde nascatur satis in promtu est. amando enim quisque excellentiam suam uel paribus inuidet, quod ei coaequentur, uel inferioribus, ne sibi coaequentur, uel superioribus, quod eis non coaequetur, superbiendo igitur inuidus, non inuidendo quisque superbus est.13 In this sense, I shall try to show, Yvain repeatedly manifests invidia even though he never envies anyone ? unless it be the slain Esclados, while Laudine grieves over his corpse ? and invidus describes Keu more fully and accurately than ' envious. ' Similarly, in Gregory the Great's scheme superbia is the root of the other sins, which grow from it in succession, each one giving rise to the next. Inanis gloria is the first offshoot and invidia the second. Sed unumquodque eorum tanta sibi cognatione jungitur, ut non nisi unum de altero proferatur.

The events which follow Calogrenant's narrative show Yvain infected with Keu's invidia. Yvain's immediate response to his cousin's story (581-89) is direct and sincere, and it captures our sympathy. At the same time, it is simple and conventional, and in the context of this particular scene those qualities assign it an uncertain value. Keu's sarcastic challenge easily perverts the tendency toward superbia evidenced in Yvain's self-confidence. The effect is neatly suggested by Yvain's adoption of Keu's characteristic sarcasm even as he assures the queen that Keu's insults do not bother him (630-37). Yvain's tone here contrasts sharply, and unfavorably, with Calogrenant's (107-20). From now on Yvain is driven primarily by his desire to vindicate himself by proving Keu wrong and only incidentally by the thought of avenging his cousin's defeat. His reaction to Arthur's proclamation of an expedition en masse to the spring leaves no doubt about this change in his motivation. Calogrenant's defeat could be avenged equally well by any of Arthur's knights, but Yvain is determined not on vengeance but on self-vindication. With this purely selfish motivation, he is the only member of the court displeased with Arthur's plan: Por ce seulemant li grevoit qu'il sav?it bien que la bataille avroit mes sire Kex, sanz faille, einz que il, s'il la requeroit; ja vehee ne le ser oit; ou mes sire Gauvains me?smes, espoir, li demandera primes. Se nus de ces deus la requiert, ja contradite ne lor iert. (682-90) 'Einz que il' is the sore point, and Chr?tien gives it special prominence by placing it at the climax of the period. The use of third-person pronouns and verbs in this report of Yvain's reasoning, presented entirely from his point of view, mutes but does not conceal the intense amor propriae excellentiae, aggra vated by invidia, which motivates him. Yvain is 'trop cusan?oneus' (700) to find Calogrenant's forest path, and he is determined that and inanis gloria was no longer retained. See in general M. W. Bloomfield, The Seven Deadly Sins . . . (East Lansing 1952) esp. 69-104, and Siegfried Wenzel, 'The Seven Deadly Sins: Some Problems of Research,' Speculum 43 (1968) 1-22.</page><page sequence="13">Chretien's 'yvain' 157 qui que le doie conparer, ne finera tant que il voie le pin qui la fontainne onbroie, et le perron et la tormante qui grausle, et pluet, et tone, et vante. (772-76) But he obviously has little interest in these wonders for their own sake, because once at the spring his curiosity is satisfied in an instant: His breathless race to be first to the spring dramatizes his superbia and invidia. The thematic connection between Yvain's quest, his fight with Esclados, his first infatuation with Laudine, and his departure with Gauvain and failure to return within the promised time may at first sight seem loose, yet they all demonstrate the effects of Yvain's excessive amor propriae excellentiae. The recollection of Keu's stinging sarcasm and the fear of further attacks on his reputation if he should fail or not be able to prove his victory drive Yvain to desperate violence in his fight with Esclados just as they goaded him on his journey to the spring. Chr?tien pointedly notes Keu's influence upon Yvain as he pursues his mortally wounded opponent. Yvain nowhere appears more selfishly cruel. He is utterly insulated from any sympathy for Esclados by the invidia which Keu's threat to his pride has aroused in him. Ensi cil fuit, et cil le chace si pr?s qu'a po qu'il ne l'anbrace, et si ne le par puet ataindre, et s'est si pr?s que il Tot plaindre de la destrece que il sant; mes toz jorz a fo?r entant, et cil de chacier s'esvertue, qu'il crient sa poinne avoir perdue se mort ou vif ne le retient, que des ranpones li sovient que mes sire Kex li ot dites.

'perdre sa poinne' carries a precise and mordant force. Its effect is repellent because the idiom, with its dull patina of conventionality, exactly conveys Yvain's egotistical indifference to the pain of another man a bare arm's reach away whose groans he can clearly hear. He thinks only of the injury his own pride might suffer from Keu's triumphant insults if he could not prove his victory. Indeed, the fight as a whole presents a glimpse of disturbing inhuman ferocity which transgresses the limits of a courtly ideal. It need only be com pared with the deliberately normal battle between Yvain and Alier for the violence of its representation to be apparent. Chr?tien specifically notes the exceptional ferocity and cruelty of the first battle: einz dui chevalier plus angr?s ne furent de lor mort haster. . . . s'est mervoille cornant tant dure bataille si fiere et si dure. (838-39, 849-50) These are not conventional hyperboles. Lances, shields, helmets, and hauberks are shown hacked to pieces in systematic detail. The focus on the several blows is close and sharp; their effects are carefully indicated. The ten lines in which Yvain and Esclados first resort to their swords are representative: Li uns l'autre a l'espee assaut si ont au chaple des espees les guiges des escuz colpees et les escuz dehaciez toz et par desus et par desoz si que les pieces an depandent, n'il ne s'an cuevrent ne desfandent; car si les ont harigotez qu'a d?livre, sor les costez, et sor les piz, et sor les hanches, essaient les espees blanches. (824-34) The diction is precise; the verbs, undulled by familiarity, catch and hold the attention: s'antreha?ssent de mort, percent, deslicent, fondent, esclicent, dehachiez, harigotez, anbuingnent, ploient, enpiroit (twice), navr?rent (twice), escar?ele, estonez, s'esmaia, fandu. The adverb felenessement near its beginning (835) and the ' felon cop ' at its end (866) control our response to this combat. The com parisons of Esclados to burning coals (812) and of Yvain and him to two stones (837) and to a falcon and a crane point to their inhuman ferocity.15 15 Vergil uses animal similes in this way to characterize the bloody and senseless combats of Aeneid 9 and to present in Turnus the virtual incarnation of the fury of war. See Viktor</page><page sequence="15">Chretien's a ' 159 In Yvain's battle with Alier, on the other hand, where Yvain's restoration has begun, the verbs are reassuringly familiar (ferir, requerre, abatre). Even when the battle is recounted directly, the violence is comfortably distant. When Yvain unhorses his first opponent, for example, Chr?tien presents the blow of lance against shield with emphasis on Yvain's strength ('feri de si grant vertu,' 3151), qualifies his reference to horse and rider's falling into a heap by a hesitating 'it seems-to-me,' and avoids ever saying bluntly that Yvain killed the man by first noting that he never rose again, then explaining that his heart had burst and his back had been broken (3151-57). When the battle is recounted from the perspective of La Dame de Noroison's ladies in their tower (3180-354), the violence is still more remote, the focus on Yvain more narrow, the praise of his valor more intense. In lines 3208-30 Yvain virtually performs a chivalric ballet against a backdrop of the most shadowy opponents. The lion simile here (3198-200) differs affectively from that in Calogrenant's narrative (488) because the stress is placed on the natural drive of hunger rather than bloodthirsty ferocity. The simile of falcons and teal recalls the comparison of Yvain spurring after Esclados to a gerfalcon pur suing a crane (882) but suggests a new restraint and humane control. The phrase venir a merci alone ? not to mention the eulogistic adjectives cortois, preuz, and buens ? sufficiently marks the change in tone between this battle and that with Esclados: Mes li cortois, li preuz, li buens, mes sire Yvains trestot ausi les fesoit venir a merci con fet li faucons les c?rceles. (3188-91) The style of the first battle reappears momentarily while La Dame de Noroison's men-at-arms pursue Alier's routed troops (3260-66), but Yvain is remote from that savagery in his own pursuit of the Count up to the very walls of his castle, where he accepts his surrender in a scene parallel to his heartless pursuit of Esclados (3267-89). The violence which immediately precedes it seems intended to point up the contrast in Yvain's behavior. We may safely conclude P?schl, Die Dichtkunst Virgils: Bild und Symbol in der ?neis (2nd ed; Vienna 1964) 168-205. On Vergil's influence on Chr?tien, see Werner Ziltener, Chr?tien und die Aeneis: Eine Unter suchung des Einflusses von Vergil auf Chr?tien von Troyes (Graz and Cologne 1957) esp. 84-91. The effect of such similes did not have to await the twentieth century for recognition. In the twelfth century Arnulf of Orleans, Glosule super Lucanum(ed. Berthe M. Marti [Papers and Monographs of the American Academy in Rome 18; Rome 1951]), commenting on motus in Lucan's Civil War 1.184, noticed the point of the lion simile which followed and wrote, 'MOTVS id est de triumpho sibi denegato; sed motus proprie ferarum est quod Cesari attri buit, quia inferius leoni comparato.'

Helm (Teubner Series; Leipzig 1898) 105-06.</page><page sequence="16">160 TRADITIO that Chr?tien did not intend the battle beside the spring to reflect his notion of the heroic ideal. Yvain's anger there, aggravated by his superbia and invidia, is evidently excessive. So, in the Gregorian scheme, the sin of ira grows out of invidia, which itself arose from superbia. Yvain's infatuation with Laudine also does not simply illustrate an ideal of courtly love. How much of its analysis of the emotions which accompany love at first sight is conventional and how much original perceptions of Chr? tien's, or how many of Yvain's reactions are intended to be admirable and how many ridiculous though natural, is difficult to say exactly. Certainly Chr?tien recognizes the very human comedy in Yvain's infatuation. Lunete's astonish ment at learning, in her delightfully urbane dialogue with Yvain (1550-68), that he has enjoyed his stay in the gatehouse assures the modern reader that his response is not essentially disqualified by historical prejudice. And Lau dine's queries in Yvain's first interview with her demonstrate that Yvain's protestations must have seemed almost as extravagant in the twelfth century as they do now.16 The comedy of the dialogue, indeed, depends on the contrast between the romantic Yvain and the practical Laudine, seeking a defender for her spring. Once she has brought him to what is for her the main point, the interview ends abruptly: In this context, Yvain's immediately preceding confession of transcendent love (2025-34) cannot quite be taken seriously by anyone but him. Chr?tien displays as well the intense egotism which inevitably accompanies Yvain's love at first sight for Laudine and which might be monstrous if it were not so human. The association of Yvain's love with his fear of being shamed by Keu (1343-78, 1527-44) suggests the self-centered perspective which, indeed, appears immediately as he stands at the window watching Laudine wring her hands and read in her gold-illumined psalter beside her husband's grave: It pervades the whole interior monologue. When he laments, for example, 'et oseriez vos enprandre por moi ma fontainne a desfandre?' ' O?l voir, dame, vers toz homes. ' ' Sachiez donc, bien accord? somes. ' (2035-38) Et quant il plus s'an done garde, plus l'ainme, et plus Ii abelist. Ce qu'ele plore et qu'ele list volsist qu'ele lessi? e?st et qu'a lui parler Ii ple?st.

And he again betrays his lack of sympathy when he exclaims, ' Dex ! Por coi fet si grant folie et por coi ne se blece mains?' (1488-89) His unspoken meaning is obvious enough: 'Why should she behave so madly when she is so beautiful and I am so anxious to declare my love to her?' Chr? tien finally undercuts the entire passage with the mordant rhyme of his con clusion: Ensi mes sire Yvains devise, celi qui de duel se debrise. (1511-12) The scene in which Gauvain persuades Yvain to leave Laudine and go off tourneying with him again reveals in Yvain the same fundamental vice of excessive self-love. Gauvain's argument has been taken for the thematic core of Le Chevalier au lion9 a straightforward statement of the moral problem with which the romance attempts to come to terms.17 In fact, Chr?tien does not suggest that Yvain's marriage threatens his renown, and Gauvain appeals to Yvain's superbia just as surely as Keu did with his taunts, though more subtly, when he counsels, ' Amander doit de bele dame qui l'a a amie ou a fame, que n'est puis droiz que ele l'aint que ses los et ses pris remaint. . . . Or primes doit vostre pris croistre. ' (2491-2501) Gauvain strikes again at the related vice of invidia, Yvain's fear that he might be considered inferior to someone else, when he continues to urge, ' Ronpez le frain et le chevoistre, s'irons tornoier moi et vos, que l'en ne vos apiaut jalos. ' (2502-04) So when Yvain asks leave of Laudine, he maintains that he is requesting ' une chose . . . por vostre enor et por la moie' (2254-55), 'que l'an ne l'apialt recreant' (2563). The same superbia motivates Yvain here as in his solitary departure for the spring, his battle with Esclados, and his love for Laudine. Yvain's obsession with honor makes his failure to return within the ap 17 See . 1 supra.</page><page sequence="18">162 TRADITIO pointed time inevitable, not because he will never think of returning ?- Lau dine's charge is unjust in this respect ? but because he will be held back by Gauvain, the epitome of conventional courtoisie (2402-10): que departir ne le leira mes sire Gauvains d'avoec lui. (2671-72) Chr?tien uses the rhyme enorer-demorer to mark the fatal conjunction of cause and effect: mes sire Gauvains se penoit de lui enorer, et si le fist tant demorer que toz li anz fu trespassez et de l'autre encor assez. (2676-80) Yvain's superbia is most conspicuous at the moment he is confronted with its consequences. On the feast of the Assumption he and Gauvain attain the moral goal toward which all Yvain's previous actions tended. The honor which he sought is at its zenith: a la mi aost vint que li rois cort et feste tint. Et furent la voille devant revenu del tornoiemant ou mes sire Yvains ot est?; s'an ont tot le pris aport?, ce dit li contes, ce me sanble; et li dui chevalier ansanble ne vostrent en vile descendre, einz firent lor paveillon tendre fors de la vile et cort i tindrent c'onques a cort de roi ne vindrent, ein?ois vint li rois a la lor, car avoec ax sont li meillor des chevaliers, et toz li plus. Entr'ax seoit li rois Artus. (2681-96) After their triumph at a tournament, Gauvain and Yvain have made them selves rivals to King Arthur. The parallelism between 'cort et feste tint' and 'cort i tindrent' and the pointed chiastic correspondence between the two lines 'c'onques a cort de roi ne vindrent, / ein?ois vint li rois a la lor' insist upon it. Obviously their refusal ('ne vostrent') to stop in the city where Arthur is holding court constitutes a willful challenge to Arthur's sovereignty. Obviously, too, they have succeeded in it, for the best knights are on their</page><page sequence="19">Chretien's 'wain' 163 side, and Arthur must come to them, reduced to the anonymity of sitting in a position no more precisely noted than 'entr'ax.'18 Yvain's humiliation is complete when Laudine's messenger suddenly arrives to accuse him of disloyalty in love, condemn him to Laudine's continuing hatred, and take back the magic ring which preserves a true lover from harm. Her denunciation recalls the references in the prologue19 to the degeneracy of love among those who talk about it but do not know what it is and the mention of fools who mistake courtesy for love ? at the time apparently fortuitous ? which Chr?tien inserted between Gauvain's meeting with Lunete and his conversation with Yvain. More generally, it recalls the theme of letter and spirit in Calogrenant's prologue. The more conventional a hero Yvain may have seemed, the more forcefully the courtly ideal is now put in question. If Yvain cared nothing for Laudine, the realization that his love has been defective and the fear that he has lost her would not be so shattering. But he has indeed been more concerned about his own excellence than about Laudine. III The second part of Le Chevalier au lion traces Yvain's moral restoration. In its large outlines it parallels the first part, for it begins with Yvain's abrupt and solitary departure from Arthur's court and ends in a second reconciliation, again arranged by Lunete, between Yvain and Laudine.20 But whereas Yvain's conduct in the first part was grounded in superbia, in the second it is grounded in humilitas, the root of all virtues; although it was irresponsible in the first, in the second it is for the most part rationally controlled. The first part re vealed the defects of Arthurian courtoisie, and the second moves toward a 18 Owein's overstaying his leave (173-74) is, by contrast, unexplained and unaccountable. There is no pursuit of honor, no hint of superbia. Any meaning which might underlie Owein's failure to return is obscured by the magical (at least in Owein) period of three years he stays away and by the fact that Arthur, out of love for him, asked the Lady of the Fountain to allow Owein to return to court with him. All this is not surprising, for?as Walter Greiner, ' Owein-Yvain: Neue Beitr?ge zur Frage nach der Unabh?ngigkeit der cymrischen Mabinogion von den Romanen Chrestiens,' Zeitschrift f?r celtische Philologie 12 (1918) 1-184, esp. 152-159, pointed out long ago, rather disparagingly for Chr?tien ? the author of the Welsh romance was uninterested in the psychological processes and motivations which seem to constitute Chr?tien's most substantial addition to the story. 19 Cf. esp. 2732-34 and 24-28. 20 The parallels between Yvain's marriage and final reconciliation with Laudine were first emphasized as an important stylistic device by Elise Richter, 'Die k?nstlerische Stoff gestaltung in Chrestiens Iuain,' Zeitschrift f?r) r(omanische) Philologie) 39 (1919) 385-97, esp. 393-97.</page><page sequence="20">164 TRADITIO redefinition of the chivalric ideal in the twin figures of Yvain and his lion. In the second part, Yvain triumphs successively over the vices of superbia, invidia, and ira to which he fell victim in the first. Only with order restored to his own soul does he become a force for order in the social world around him. His accomplishments there consistently contrast with Gauvain's relative failures. Yvain first left Arthur's court alone to avenge Calogrenant's defeat at the hands of the Knight of the Spring and thereby to vindicate himself before Keu. He leaves now to take vengeance upon himself (2795-97). The tor beillons (2806) and tempeste (2946) which he encounters on this second journey are internal. His grief and inwardly directed anger reduce him dramatically to the level of a wild beast (2829-30) as his wrath first did morally. But on this journey Yvain's moral direction is changed when he meets a hermit. The episode is brief and has no necessary literal connection with Yvain's discovery by the Dame de Noroison. Nor has it any parallel in Owein. Its importance is thematic and psychological. It begins to reintegrate Yvain into a community based on the hermit's charity, represented by the rustic commerce in which the hermit cooks the venison which Yvain brings him and takes the trouble to sell the hides in order to buy him bread. In a comparable psychological integration, Yvain's encounter with the hermit begins, though it does not accomplish, the redirection of his grief from self-destruction to regeneration. Within this pattern, recognition of guilt and repentance are perhaps figured in the 'pain a Thermite' (2852), all of which Yvain ate ? even though, as Chr?tien pointedly observes, ne cuit que onques de si fort ne de si aspre e?st gost?. (2846-47) The bitterness of penitence was a commonplace, and it was frequently associated with cheap, bitter bread.21 The weight of this tradition would add a deeper 21 Augustine, Enarr. in Ps. 5.15 (GCL 38.25-26), explained, ' peccatoribus autem panis ueritatis amarus est; unde os uera dicentis oderunt. Ipsi ergo inamicauerunt Deum, qui peccando in earn aegritudinem deuenerunt, ut cibum ueritatis, quo sanae animae gaudent, tanquam felleum sustinere non possint.' Similarly Gregory, Mor. in Job 4.18.33-34, 8.21.37 22.38, 10.44.67 (PL 75.654, 822-24, 896), Horn, in Ezech. 1.10.28, 1.11.45 (PL 76.897, 905); Alain de Lille, Serm. 4, De pascha (PL 210.209); Peter Lombard, Comment, in Ps. 101 (PL 191.910); Alleg?ri?? in sacram Script. (PL 112.1020-21). These various allegories were summed up in the mid-thirteenth century by the highly traditional exegete Hugh of St. Cher, Opera omnia in universum V?tus et N?vum Testamentum (Lyon 1645) V 21vb: 'Tali cibo debent pasci ut invitentur ad asperitatem poenitentiae, ad timorem gehennae, ad humilitatem et propriam deiectionem, pro vilitate culpae praeteritae.

Penance, with God's grace, heals the effects of sin, the ' vulnera interioris hominis. '22 Chr?tien's striking insistence upon Yvain's nakedness (2834, 2888, 2894-96, 2908, 3016, 3019) and the wound by which alone he can be recognized, stripped as he is of his courtly dress, emphasizes the totally unaccommodated state to which he has been reduced. Afterward, his putting on the rich clothes which the Dame de Noroison has sent him and the arms with which she equips him to fight Count Alier marks a new entrance into the chivalric world; and when they are considered alongside the encounter with the hermit within this large pattern of events, the important details of Yvain's nakedness and wound may, like the hermit's bread, point to the moral significance of this second beginning. According to Gregory the Great, nakedness figures forth the loss of primal justice and innocence, but the garment of innocence will be returned to the repentant: Nullus homo sine peccato est, nisi ille qui in hune mundum non venit ex peccato. Et quia omnes in culpa ligamur, ipsa amissione justitiae morimur; concessa prius in paradiso veste innocentiae nudamur, interitu etiam carnis subs?quente consumimur. Homo itaque peccator moritur in culpa, nudatura justitia, consumitur in poena. Hanc nuditatem peccatoris filii tegere dig natus est pater, qui eo redeunte dixit: Cito prof erte stolam primam [Luc. 15.22]. Prima quippe stola est vest?s innocentiae, quam homo bene con ditus accepit, sed male a serpente persuasus perdidit. Contra hanc rursum nuditatem dicitur: Beatus qui vigilai, et custodit vestimenta sua, ne nudus ambulet [Apoc. 16.15]. Vestimenta quippe custodimus cum praecepta inno centiae servamus in mente, ut cum non judici culpa nudat, ad amissam innocentiam poenitentia operiat.23 of barley and oats is also associated with penitence in Perceval, ed. William Roach (Textes Litt?raires Fran?ais 71; Geneva and Paris 1959) 6476-79, 6499-504. Perceval's meeting with the hermit has been considered inauthentic by some critics. Even if it were, the association of penitence and coarse bread by a roughly contemporary continuator would still be note worthy. See Leo Pollmann, Chr?tien de Troyes und der Conte del Graal, ZrPh Beihefte 110 (1965) 5-29.

The interpretation does not ultimately depend upon knowledge of an exegetical tradition. According to Marianne</page><page sequence="22">166 TRADITIO Like the Prodigal Son, Yvain was dead and is alive, was lost and is found. Similarly it may not be over-ingenious to see in the wound on Yvain's face, by which the damsel recognizes him, the old wound of superbia, which was, from a moral standpoint, his most distinctive feature. Her words to her lady would then take on a special irony: 'Dame, je ai Yvain trov?, le chevalier mialz esprov? del monde, et le mialz antechi?; mes je ne sai par quel pechi? est au franc home mesche?; espoir, aucun duel a eu qui le fet ensi d?mener.' (2917-23) Pechi? is more exact than she realizes, and though she recognized Yvain by his wound, she does not know, as the reader does, that the sin of superbia, not some generalized calamity, brought about his fall.24 In any case, the invocation of God with which Yvain salutes her and the question which he asks her in their first interchange demonstrate the new humility which has taken the place of amor propriae excellentiae as the controlling force in his conduct: ' Dameisele, or me dites donc se vos avez besoing de moi ? ' (3074-75) And I have already attempted to show the difference in tone between Yvain's fights with Esclados and with Alier which dramatizes this moral development. The abruptness of Yvain's departure from the Dame de Noroison stands out against the background of exceptional concern demonstrated in the healing of Yvain, for the damsel added clothes of her own to the already rich stock provided for him by the lady (2973-76); she was so anxious for his recovery that she did not follow the lady's instructions to apply Morgan le Fay's magic ointment only to his temples but anointed him all over and thought the ointment well used (2989-95); and although the lady lost thereby the best and most valuable of all her possessions, she nonetheless instructed the damsel to serve Yvain Stauffer, Der Wald: Zur Darstellung und Deutung der Natur im Mittelalter (Studiorum romanicorum collectio turicensis 10; Bern 1959) 74, 'ist nun Yvain jeder Kleidung entbl?sst, so bedeutet das, dass er gleicherweise jeder Menschlichkeit und menschlichen W?rde ent bl?sst ist. ' 24 Owein's nakedness is mentioned but not stressed (174), and there is no reference to any wound. His distress is physical rather than spiritual; his weakness is caused simply by starvation. The widowed countess instructs her maid to apply the ointment near the heart with the assurance, ' If there be life in him he will rise. ' The magical quality of the ointment is further reduced when the countess assigns it a definite monetary value.</page><page sequence="23">Chretien's 'yvain' 167 in every way (3116-23).25 The abruptness of this departure contrasts with Yvain's failure in the first part of the romance to return to Laudine within the appointed time. The rhyme enorer-demorer recurs, but here, together with Chr?tien's reference to 'la voie arriere,' it confirms Yvain's triumph over superbia and the beginning of his restoration: Or se mist a la voie arri?re et leissa molt la dame iriee que il avoit molt feite li?e. Et con plus li?e avoit feite, plus li poise et plus se desheite quant il ne vialt plus demorer, c'or le volsist eie enorer. (3320-26) Yvain's subsequent encounter with the lion constitutes the structural and thematic center of the romance, yet it seems never to have been understood.26 25 Robert G. Cook, 'The Ointment in Chr?tien's Yvain,' Mediaeval Studies 31 (1969) 338-42, has argued ? on the basis of what he believes is a strikingly parallel reference to ointment intended for the head but used instead forali the body in Bernard's twelfth sermon on the Canticle of Canticles (PL 183.831) ? that the ointment which cures Yvain of his madness symbolizes pity. In fact, Bernard carefully distinguished between the ointment poured over Christ's head (Matt. 26.7) and the spices intended but not used to anoint his body (Mark 16.1). The parallel, even if there were one, could not account for Chr?tien's confirmation of the lady's insistence that the ointment needed to be applied only to the head or her distress at its loss. The discrepancy between instruction and use seems rather to mark, with irony and delicate eroticism, the damsel's concern for Yvain. 26 The earliest studies, like T. M. Chotzen, 'Le Lion d'Owein et ses prototypes celtiques,' Neophilologus 18 (1902) 51-58,131-36, and E. Brugger, ' Yvain and his Lion, ' Modern Philology 28 (1941) 267-87, were content to explain the lion by citing sources and analogues. A Chris tological interpretation has been offered, incidentally by Alfred Adler, 'Sovereignty in Chr?tien's Yvain,' Publications of the) M(odern) L(anguage) Association of America) 62 (1947) 281-305, and in its fullest form by Julian Harris, 'The Role of the Lion in Chr?tien de Troyes' Yvain,' PMLA 64 (1949) 1143-63, both based on A. G. Brodeur, 'The Grateful Lion: A Study in the Development of Mediaeval Narrative,' PMLA 39 (1924) 485-524. This Christological interpretation is unacceptable because it cannot account for the facts that the serpent is on the point of killing the lion when Yvain arrives, that Yvain saves the lion so that in any Christological allegory he would have to represent the Redeemer, that the lion is entirely subservient to Yvain, that it nearly commits suicide, that it occasionally displays terrific ferocity, or that Chr?tien generally takes pains to make it behave like a large dog and never like divinity incarnate. It cannot, in short, explain any of the data of Chr?tien's romance. Brodeur (511-12) adduces an interpretation of 'this very story' from an anonymous Liber exemplorum of the last quarter of the thirteenth century: 'Exemplum de leone, de quo fertur, sicut dicitur in summa de viciis, quod cum hune quidam miles a serpente liberavit et a milite recedere noluit. Quid igitur excusacionis habebunt, qui deser entes redemptorem suum serpenti adherent infernali^' It seems obvious, however, despite Brodeur's italics, that the author has logically enough cast the knight in the role of Christ and recommends the lion's fidelity to the common Christian. A closer analogue (mentioned</page><page sequence="24">168 TRADITIO The scene which Yvain stumbles upon in the depths of the forest is unmis takably grotesque. Yvain himself stares for a moment at 'cele mervoille' (3349). The grotesque naturally verges on the absurd, and Chr?tien throughout is ironic and detached, but the scene is never ludicrous. Yvain expects the lion to attack him (3367-68, 3384-86); later, in Yvain's company, the lion terrifies those it meets; and Chr?tien must have expected his audience to share in a pleasant way something of that fear. Even Chr?tien's amplifi cation of the lion's obeisance to Yvain is elaborate because it is extraordinary and significant. Of the two animals Yvain finds fighting to the death, the significance of the serpent is the more obvious and confirms that of the lion. Chr?tien links the serpent to Keu and the invidia of which he is the incarnation. It is venimeus, si li saut par la boche feus, tant est de felenie plains. (3354-56) Chr?tien focuses exclusively on these two details ? and on the lion's tail and back, which I shall consider in a moment. The serpent embodies venom and by Frappier, ?tude 214) is the episode from La Queste del saint graal (ed. A. Pauphilet [CFMA 33; Paris 1923] 93-104) in which Perceval encounters a lion and a dragon (serpent), but there Perceval only helps the lion by killing the dragon, which had seized one of the lion's cubs and which the lion has pursued and attacked. Harris (1149n.) suggests that the lion's attempt at suicide is an allusion to Christ's laying down his life for mankind, but since the lion does not lay down its life and would not have helped Yvain if it had, he concedes that his interpretation is rather desperate and blames Chr?tien for such a 'very crude' allusion. The Christological interpretation is based on the consistent allegorization of the lion as Christ in medieval bestiaries (a fact emphasized even by Frappier, ?tude 214). To maintain this interpretation, however, bestiaries select rigorously the natural details which they allegorize. None of these details appears in Yvain: Yvain's lion does not sleep with its eyes open but simply stays awake (3475-78, veilla, v. 3476) in order to watch over Yvain's horse. As soon as one turns to Biblical commentaries (e.g., Gregory's Mor. in Job, 5.21.41 [PL 75.701], where the lion illustrates the diversity of significances a single thing can have) or dictionaries of scriptural significances, the range of possible interpretations for the lion becomes wide indeed. The Alleg?ri?? in sacram Scripturam (PL 112.983) is representative: 'Leo est Christus, . . . Deus judex, . . . quilibet spiritualiter fortis,. . . populus Judaicus . . . Leo, austeritas legis, . . . imper?tor Romanus, . . . quilibet crudelis . . . Leo, Antichristus in fallacia sua.' Leo Spitzer's interpretation ('Le Lion arbitre morale de l'homme,' Romania 64 [1938] 525-30) is invalidated by Chr?tien's insistence that the lion subordinates its instincts to Yvain's will. Interpretations which see in the lion the symbol of some abstract ideal like manly strength and nobility of character (Stauffer, Der Wald 48) or knightly perfection (Frappier, ?tude 212, 213, 216) are less obviously wrong because they point so generally to themes central to the romance, but they, too, founder on the bestiality of the lion as Chr?tien presents it and on its subordination to Yvain.</page><page sequence="25">Chretien's 'yvain' 169 felenie. It is 'le felon serpant' (3373), the 'serpant felon' (3380); Yvain cleans its venom and filth from his sword to bring the episode to a conclusion (3404-06). The serpent appears, moreover, in a context which presents venimeus and fel as abstract moral categories controlling Yvain's decision to aid the lion: Lors dit qu'au lyon se tanra, qu'a venimeus ne a felon ne doit an feire se mal non, et li serpanz est venimeus, si le saut par la boche feus, tant est de felenie plains. (3352-56) Chr?tien has used these categories before. Recall Guinevere's initial rebuke to Keu. Amplifying the adjective venimeus (70) in the notatio which introduced him, it is at once apt, acute, and traditional: 'Certes, Kex, ja fussiez crevez, f et la re?ne, au mien cuidier, se ne vos poissiez vuidier del venin don vos estes plains.' (86-89) The venom of malice in general and of invidia in particular was, and still is, a commonplace. Gregory the Great makes a special point of it: 'Sed inter haec sciendum est quia quamvis per omne vitium quod perpetratur, humano cordi antiqui hostis virus infunditur, in hac tarnen nequitia [i.e., invidia] tota sua viscera serpens concutit, et imprimendae malitiae pestem vomit.'27 And Keu, like the serpent, is fei: 'fel et poignanz et venimeus' (70): tant est Kex, et fel, et pervers, plains de ranpones et d'enui. (1352-53) So Calogrenant says of Keu: 'Toz jorz doit pu?r li fumiers et toons poindre, et maloz bruire, et felons enuier et nuire.' (116-18) Before Yvain's encounter with the serpent the adjective fel is comparably applied besides only to the 'felon cop' which shatters Esclados' skull (866) and to his retainers as they search for Yvain (1092). With the first use, I 27 Mor. in Job 5.46.85 (PL 75.728). Augustine, Enarr. in Ps. 13.4 (GGL 38.87), similarly uses 'Quorum os maledictione et amaritudine plenum est' to gloss 'venenum aspidum' (Ps. 13.3). Hugh of St. Cher, Opera II 146vb on Ps. 57.5, writes, 'Item serpens venenum fundit, in quo notatur invidia. ' The motif is classical: in Ovid, Met. 2.768-69, 77, Minerva finds Invidia 'edentem / vip?reas carnes, vitiorum alimenta suorum; / . . . lingua est suffusa veneno. '</page><page sequence="26">170 TRADITIO think, Keu may fairly be associated.28 It is easy to see in the serpent's fiery breath a metaphorical equivalent of the taunts and insults which stream from Keu's mouth and injure his fellow knights, and once we have, Chr?tien's emphasis on the serpent's mouth as its source (3356, 3362-64) appears more precisely meaningful. If the serpent is associated with Keu, so the lion is with Yvain. The lion, of course, is a traditional simile for an heroic warrior,29 and Yvain has just been compared to a lion, at the end of his battle with Alier (3198-200). As Keu is fel and venimeus, so Yvain, like the lion, is gentil and franc. As if to emphasize the correspondence between lion and knight, the rescued lion 'fist que preuz et deboneire' (3389 ff.). Thus, from this point of view, killing the serpent at last frees Yvain from Keu's influence, wh ch goaded him to unbridled savagery in his fight with Esclados, and from the taint of invidia. The obsessive quality of his dismembering the serpent, like the note of finality in cleaning his sword and thrusting it back into its scabbard, reinforces such an interpretation. The position of the incident is also right. Yvain has been made to feel the consequences of his conduct in the first part of the romance. In his despair, he became practically a beast and behaved exactly as the lion will in succeeding lines when he hunted deer and brought them to the hermit. He has repented of his folly, and in the Dame-de-Noroison episode he demonstrated, somewhat rudely to be sure, his victory over superbia. He is more gracious and unselfish here, since he is so moved by pity for the noble lion (3369) that he resolves to rescue it even though he expects it to attack him afterwards; the point is made twice (3365-68, 3384-86). The self-effacement is perfect. This episode as a whole marks the further victory over invidia evidenced literally by Yvain's unconcern whether the lion will turn on him. This explication of the lion as an analogue to Yvain can be only approximate, however. It does not account for cutting off the tip of the lion's tail. More important, this is not a dream-vision, and the lion is a continuing character in the romance. Yvain and his lion are virtually two aspects of a single per sonage, epitomized in the name ' Chevalier au Lion. ' When Yvain leaves this clearing in the forest 28 'Fel' is later applied once each to Laudine's seneschal (3662), whose envy ('qui grant envie me port?it' 3663) recalls Keu's, to the battle he has arranged for Lunete's champion (3733), and to the two demons at Pesme Aventure (5611). It is used in a cluster about Harpin (3892, 4097, 4130, 4144, 4743). 29 E.g. Homer's famous comparison of Achilles to a lion, Iliad 20.164-73.

(3408-11) The lion does indeed follow Yvain like a shadow from now on.30 In the hunting scene which follows, the lion's nature and will are entirely subordinate to Yvain's: car encontre sa volent? ne voloit aler nule part. (3426-27) Yvain, for his part, an grant chiert? le tint por la grant amor qu'an lui ot, (3448-49) and he tells the retainers who are so terrified of the lion that they will not allow it into their castle with him, 'N'en parlez mie que ja n'i enterrai sanz lui: ou nos avrons Tostel andui, ou je me remanrai ?a fors qu'autretant Taim corne mon cors.' (3788-92)31 Chr?tien never lets us forget that the Chevalier au Lion is the knight with the lion. His lion identifies Yvain like a red beard or a hooked nose. It is an extension of his self. The maiden who is seeking Yvain on behalf of the second daughter of the Lord of Noire Espine tells the baron whose family Yvain has just saved from Harpin: 'Je quier ce que je ne vi onques, mien esciant, ne me quenui, mes un lyon a avoec lui et an me dit, si je le truis, que an lui molt f?er me puis. ' (4893-98)32 And, as here, the lion is associated with the trust which Yvain inspires, for when Yvain arrived at the baron's castle, an s'esperance molt se fient et molt pansent qu'il soit preudon por la conpaingnie au lyon 30 Cf. 3764-65, 4018-19, 4161-63, 4694-96, 4935-37, 5439-41, 6461-62, 6520-22. 31 See also 4688-89. 32 See also 5012-13, 5032-33, 6661-62.</page><page sequence="28">172 TRADITIO qui ausi dolcemant se gist lez lui com uns aigniax feist. (4002-06) Yet if they are two aspects of a single personage, they are different, and the lion is not simply Yvain's alter ego or a doublet symbolique. The scene in the forest can be most satisfactorily viewed as a projection of psychological forces. At the end of Book 9 of the Republic Socrates constructs an image of the soul: Do you now model the form of a multitudinous, many-headed monster, having a ring of heads of all manner of beasts, tame and wild, which he is able to put forth and metamorphose at will. . . . Suppose now that you make a second form as of a lion, and a third of a man; but let the first be far the largest, and the second next in size. . . . And now join them into one, and let the three somehow grow together. . . . Next fashion the outside of them into a single image, as of a man, so that he who is not able to look within, and sees only the outer case, may believe the beast to be a single human creature. . . . And now, to him who maintains that it is profitable for this human creature to be unjust and unprofitable to be just, let us reply that, if he be right, it is profitable for this creature to feast the multitudinous monster and strengthen the lion and the lion-like qualities, but to starve and weaken the man, who is consequently liable to be dragged about at the mercy of either of the other two; and he is not to attempt to familiarize or harmonize them with one another ? he ought rather to suffer them to fight and bite and devour one another. . . . To him the other, who says that justice is profitable, makes answer that one should ever so speak and act as to give to the man within the most complete mastery over the entire human creature, ? to enable him to watch over the many-headed monster like a good husbandman, fostering and cultivating the gentle qualities, and preventing the wild ones from growing; and when he has made the lion-heart his ally, and in common care of them all has reconciled the several parts with one another and with himself, he will endeavor to preserve the whole.33 Chr?tien could not have known this text, but it is the essential statement of a philosophical tradition which was available to him and of which, I shall try to demonstrate, he made use in Yvain. Jerome's Commentary on Ezechiel preserved the animal comparisons from Plato's myth of the soul, although he substituted a calf for the many-headed beast: Plerique, iuxta Platonem, rationale animae et irascentiuum et concupi scentiuum, quod ille et et uocat, ad hominem et leonem ac uitulum referunt: rationem et cogitationem et mentem et consilium eandem uirtutem atque sapientiam in cerebri arce ponentes, feritatem uero et iracundiam atque uiolentiam in leone, quae consistit in felle, porro libidinem, luxuriam et omnium uoluptatum cupidinem in iecore, 33 588b-589b, trans. .

Associating the lion with the second part of the soul was all but inevitable, however, and Chr?tien would not have had to know Jerome's Commentary on Ezechiel to have made the connection himself. In Latin the technical philo sophical terms for the irascible part of the soul were ira (in Cicero and Alcuin), irascentia or iracundia (in Apuleius), vigor iracundiae (or simply vigor, in Calcidius), irascibile or irascentivum (in Jerome), irascibile (in Cassian and Rabanus), irascibilitas (in the De spiritu et anima).37 And the lion's anger was proverbial. Pliny observed in his Natural History, 'Crebrior iracundia [leo nis].,88 Ovid's Pythagoras urges the citiziens of Crotona not to eat meat, the food of savage beasts: at quibus ingenium est inmansuetumque ferumque, Armeniaeque tigres iracundique leones cumque lupis ursi, dapibus cum sanguine gaudent.39 In his De ira Seneca noted that different animals demonstrate different char acteristic emotions: 'iracundia leones adiuvat, pavor cervos, accipitrem im petus, columbam fuga.

Iracundi enim sunt leones, immundae sues, litigosi canes.'43 And in the twelfth century Arnulf of Orleans similarly allegorized the mytho logical metamorphosis of men into beasts: 'Circe . . . incantationibus suis socios Ulixis in feras mutavit i.

Calcidius, moreover, very nearly reproduced the features of Plato's myth most pertinent to Yvain in his commentary on Timaeus 42 a-c, which describes the proper composition of the human soul.

Tune enim robustius contra vitia erigitur, cum subditur rationi famulatur. Nam quantumlibet ira ex zelo rectitudinis surgat, si immoderata mentem vicerit, rationi protinus servire contemnit; et tanto se impudentius dilat?t, quanto impatientiae vitium virtutem putat. Unde necesse est ut hoc ante omnia, qui zelo rectitudinis movetur, attendat, ne ira extra mentis dominium transeat.48 These texts reproduce the tenor of Plato's myth of the soul, as Jerome does its vehicle, for they proclaim that only a man who controls his passions, within whose soul ira is the ally of ratio, and whose moral anger serves reason can lead a just and gentle life ('iustam lenemque vitam'). The lion's traditional association with wrath suggests too its use as a symbol of ira. So in the first half of Le Chevalier au lion Yvain did not control his passions, which reduced him ultimately to a bestiality which objectified the savagery and spiritual disorder already manifest in the fight with Esclados; in the second half he does. With the original justice of his soul restored, with the lion as his ally, Yvain becomes a force for order and justice in the social world.49 Reconsider now the scene in the forest, which Chr?tien has described with such iconographical conciseness and precision: Yvain vit un lyon, en un essart, et un serpant qui le tenoit par la eoe, et si li ardoit trestoz les rains de flame ardant. (3344-47) The lion's tail is re-emphasized after Yvain has cut the serpent to pieces: Mes il li covient une piece tranchier de la eoe au l?on 47 Calcidius 232-33, 267 pp. 246-47, 272; Apuleius 1.13; both based on Republic 439d-448e. 48 Mor. in Job 5.45.82-83 (PL 75.726-27). 49 On the basis solely of a sensitive reading of the text, Alfred Adler (296-97) saw the introduction of the lion as 'the visualization of Yvain's real recovery' and suggested that since, as 'a symbol of knightly courtoisie, the lion also displays uninhibited ferocity, . . . we may safely attempt to describe this coexistence of gentleness with ferocity as an amplificano of the paradoxes in the personality of Yvain himself. ' Adler could not, however, explain the appropriateness of the lion or define the relationship between it and Yvain more closely and thereby account for this paradox of gentleness and ferocity, which he misleadingly im plies is embodied in the lion rather than in the Chevalier au Lion, that is, in Yvain and his lion.</page><page sequence="32">176 TRADITIO por la teste au serpant felon qui par la eoe le tenoit; tant con tranchier an covenoit en trancha, c'onques moins ne pot. (3378-83) The detail seems too trivial to bear the weight of emphasis put upon it until we realize that to medieval science the lion's tail was special, even unique, in its function. Pliny observed that it revealed a lion's temperament as a horse's ears did its: 'leonum animi index cauda sicut et equorum aures.'50 Although Pliny's remark was frequently repeated,51 its explanation appeared less often: ' inmota ergo placido, clemens blandienti, quod rarum est, crebrior iracundia, cuius in principio terra verberatur, incremento terga ceu quodam incitamento flagellantur. ' But it was repeated in the second quarter of the thirteenth century, some fifty years after Yvain, by Thomas of Cantimpr?, who omits Pliny's 'as if ' and says without qualification that the lion lashes its back with its tail in order to increase its anger.52 Lucan, an important school author, likewise omitted that 'as if when he made an account like Pliny's the basis for an impressive simile in the first book of his Civil War. Caesar, whom Lucan loathes, is confronted at the Rubicon by a vision of the trembling spirit of Rome, who demands that he and his troops go no farther if they come as lawful citizens. For a moment Caesar is horrified and nearly faints, but he quickly finds the audacity to reply that he comes as Rome's champion: inde moras soluit belli tumidum per amnem signa tulit propere: sicut squalentibus aruis aestiferae Libyes uiso leo comminus hoste subsedit dubius, totam dum colligit iram; mox, ubi se saeuae stimulauit uerbere caudae erexitque iubam et uasto graue murmur hiatu infremuit, turn torta leuis se lancea Mauri haereat aut latum subeant uenabula pectus, per ferrum tanti securus uolneris exit.53 50 Hist, nat. 8.19.49. 51 Solinus, Collectanea rerum memorabilium 27.13-22, ed.

Wandering through the Ardennes, Partenopeu sees a huge lion: Fors est et grans et alques maigres, Geons et familhos et aigres. Si c'est por le cheval tapis Con fait li chas por la soris; Oilz a fo?ns, tos alum?s, De sa cowe bat ses cost?s: C'est la costume del lion, Par tot s'a fiere beste non; De sa eoe se seit ferir Por ire et por coros coillir.

The serpent, then, has seized what is, figuratively, the root of the lion's anger, and the serpent's fiery breath falls on 'trestoz les rains' ? exactly where the tip of the tail, which it holds, would strike ? in the grotesque perversion of a natural process: the serpent's breath, rather than the lion's tail, incites the lion to a frenzy which cannot be self-controlled because it is not self-generated. This precisely described physical connection images the spiritual link between invidia and ira, and so this scene in the clearing marks the defeat of invidia and the subordination of ira to rational control. Cutting off the tip of the lion's tail held by the serpent both frees ira from the corrupting influence of invidia and tames it.57 But Yvain cuts off no more than he must, because so long as it is controlled, he needs the strength of ira, physically (as a power of the soul) and morally (ira per zelum rectitudinis). In all its actions the lion is, indeed, ire and force (4215) made palpable. Ire is evidently its most characteristic emotion (3502, 4215, 5526, 5603, 5659), and its behavior is purely instinctive. In the fight with Harpin, it responds, as if by reflex, to a particular blow ('a ce cop . . .,' 4213); in Lunete's trial by combat it attacks as soon as Yvain becomes hard-pressed by all three of his opponents at once (4501-02); so, too, in the fight with the demons at Pesme Aventure (5588-627). The lion's instinctive reaction to the two demons is especially striking because they are evidently the incarnation of abstract evil, yet to the lion they simply threaten Yvain, and its response has no intellectual or moral dimension but is entirely visceral: Li lyeons comance a fremir tot maintenant que il les voit, qu'il set molt bien et apar?oit que a ces armes que il tienent conbatre a son seignor se vienent; si se herice et creste ansanble, de hardement et d'ire tranble. et bat la terre de sa eoe que talant a que il rescoe son seignor, einz que il l'oc?ent. (5520-29) Since the lion symbolizes ira, its extravagant subservience to Yvain once he has rescued it from the serpent and its subordination to Yvain's will in the 67 Another of the Salernitan questions, Questiones phisicales 90-92, ed. Lawn 174, asks ' Cur sibi cauda / Truncata minui leo toto corpore vires / Sentiat ? ' The answer should be apparent from the evidence already presented. I owe this reference to Professor Thomas D. Hill of Cornell University.</page><page sequence="35">Chretien's 'yvain ' 179 hunting scene which follows dramatize the restoration of natural order within Yvain's soul. That the lion watches over Yvain's horse while he sleeps figures forth the same Platonic hierarchy of function as the proper relationship among the metaphorical man, lion, and bull recorded by Jerome, the ' summum quod imperat, medium quod agit, tertium quod regitur et administratur. ' Here, rightly, 'ratio quidem dux [est], uigor uero intimus, qui est iracundiae similis, auxiliatorem rationi uolens [praebet]. '58 A point for point allegorical quadration is unnecessary, because the significance of the scene emerges from the sum of its parts, yet it is especially appropriate that the lion of ira should watch over a horse ? and a grazing horse, at that ? traditionally associated with the flesh and concupiscence.59 This order, once established, is disturbed only in the scene of attempted suicide at the magic spring. Although the episode, which has no parallel in Owein, seems pointlessly to slow the advance of the plot, I believe its rationale can be explained by the iconography of ira. Along with the Harpin and Lunete episodes, which develop from it, it can be seen to resume and reverse the events of the first part of Le Chevalier au lion. Yvain and his lion are perhaps never more closely interconnected than here, but the fundamental distinction which remains between them is thematically crucial. Yvain's return to the spring is both physical and psychological. The memories of his first arrival there and its aftermath make Yvain faint. 'Par po ne reforsena . . . cele foiee' (3486-87) harks back to his madness and links the metaphors of torbeillons and tempeste within his head which were used then (2806, 2946) to the physical storm after his first approach to the spring, the rock, and the chapel. Chr?tien explicitly notes the disjunction between this episode and the regimen which followed the lion's rescue (3479-85). The funda mental distinction is that here, when Yvain has fainted and the lion thinks he is dead, the lion's will is no longer subordinate to Yvain's. Its instincts have free rein: Einz de rien n'ot ire graignor, qu'il coman?a tel duel a fere, n'oi tel conter ne retrere, qu'il se detuert et grate et crie et s'a talant que il s'ocie de l'espee, qu'il li est vis 58 Calcidius, c. 267, p. 272 (quoted n. 11 supra); also c. 232, p. 246. 59 Jerome, Brev. in Ps. (PL 26.918) explains equus in Ps. 32.17 as 'corpus hum?num, jumentum est animae ideo fallax'; repeated and amplified by Peter Lombard, Comment, in Ps. (PL 191.334); also Gregory, Mor. in Job 31.15.27 (PL 76.588); Rabanus, De universo 7.8 (PL 111.214), 'equus, carnalis potentia'; Hugh of St. Cher, Opera, I 453vb, II 181vb, 126vb, V 198 (on Job 39.18, Ps. 32.17, 48.13, Mich. 5.10)</page><page sequence="36">180 TRADITIO qui ait son boen seignor ocis.

(3502-13) The lion's behavior here is more typical than it may appear. Ire and duel can be used as synonyms in Old French (and are here, 3502-03), and Chr?tien consequently may not have distinguished grief so sharply from anger as the modern reader. Moreover, in Prudentius' Psychomachicfi0 and in the icono graphical tradition of virtues and vices which derived from it and which underwent no essential change until the early-thirteenth century,61 the vice ira is set against the virtue patientia. It therefore includes the undirected 'anger' of impatience and frustration. The De fructibus carnis et Spiritus ? spuriously attributed to Hugh of St. Victor and a basic text for the icono graphical trees of virtues and vices which assumed conventional form early in the twelfth century62 ? defines ira as ' strictus concitati animi furor ulciscendi libidine fervens. Ejus comit?s sunt clamor, blasphemia, contumelia, luctus, temeritas, furor, indignatio, ' and further explains, ' luctus est, qui exacerbato animo, quod minus in superiorem potest ultionis in se fletibus satisfacit.'63 Ira in general, then, is vengeance upon another and luctus in particular venge ance upon oneself. In any case, its violence obviously links the lion's behavior now and later.64 Not even the lion's demonstration of fealty to Yvain, however, has prepared for the method of its attempt at suicide, nor does it ever again so grotesquely parody human action. More than the scene in which Yvain rescued the lion from the serpent, this is ironic, even comic, in tone. Yet for all the absurdity of the lion's behavior, the episode seems fundamentally serious. The lion here enacts an iconographical motif which should unmistakably reveal its thematic 60 109-77 (CGL 126.155-57). 61 See Adolf Katzenellenbogen, Allegories of the Virtues and Vices in Mediaeval Art . . . (London 1939) 8 n. 1; 10-11; 11 n. 1; 18 n. 0; 20 nn. 2, 5; 21 n. 3; 83 n. 1; and on the trans formation of the iconography of the virtues and vices, 75-84. The connection between ira and impatientia is pointed out by Gregory, Mor. in Job 5.45.82 (PL 75.726). 62 Katzenellenbogen 63-67. 63 PL 176.1000. 64 Tristitia and acedia originate in a corruption of the irascible part of the soul according to John Cassian, Conlatio 24.15 (CSEL 13.691), and Alcuin, De animae ratione 4 (PL 101.640), and in Gregory's genetic scheme tristitia-acedia develops from ira. Perhaps part of the ex planation of the lion's behavior lies here, but tristitia is not said to be an aspect of ira, and the lion's duel is so violent that luctus seems to describe it more closely than acedia or tris titia.</page><page sequence="37">Chretien's 'yvain 5 181 significance and image the limit of ira. In the Psychomachia Ira is ultimately impotent before Patientia and destroys herself in her rage. As Patientia stands unharmed by all Ira's weapons, Ira at last throws aside the hilt of her sword, its blade shattered in vain against Patientia's helmet, et ad proprium succenditur effera letum. Missile de multis quae frustra sparserat unum puluere de campi peruersos sumit in usus. Rasile figit humi lignum ac se cuspide uersa perfodit et calido pulmonem uulnere transit.65 Patientia moralizes over the corpse of the suicide: Ipsa sibi est hostis uaesania seque furendo interimit moriturque suis Ira ignea telis.66 In subsequent iconography a figure committing suicide regularly represented ira until the early-thirteenth century, when the influence of the Psychomachia waned and suicide came to identify desperation1 The lion is just on the point of dying from its own rage, like Ira, when Yvain recovers from his swoon. Chr?tien stresses the lion's blind fury by comparing it to an enraged boar: a la mort toz escorsez coroit come pors forsenez qui ne prant garde ou il se fiere. (3517-19) The boar was considered an especially wrathful and ferocious beast, like the lion but without the lion's noble qualities.68 It should be clear, then, that Yvain is perverse when he thinks of imitating his lion and committing suicide, because he would willfully abandon himself to ira, ratio would be made fatally subordinate to iracundia, and the natural order of his soul would be overturned. Yvain's fight with Esclados, beside this same spring, evidenced precisely that disorder. In that physical encounter, Yvain and Esclados * s'antrevindrent et sanblant firent / qu'il s'antreha?ssent de mort' (815-16), and in this spiritual one, Yvain thinks that he 4molt se doit bien ha?r de mort' (3538). Ha?r de mort is a strong and memorable ex 65 150-54. 66 160-61. 67 On Ira's suicide see Katzenellenbogen 8 . 1,83 . 1. ?mile M?le, Religious Art in France of the Thirteenth Century, trans. Dora Nussey (New York 1913) fig. 54, reproduces a window of the choir apse of the Lyons cathedral (c. 1220) which represents ira as a knight committing suicide with his own sword. The image reflects the iconographical traditions of the twelfth century. 68 Cf. Bernard Silvestris, Comment, super Eneid. 62, 'iracundos apros'; Vincent of Beauvais, Spec. nat. 18.5 (1328), f[Aper] est autem periracundus et insipiens, nec bonorum doctrinam morum recipiens, nullaque mutatio accidit in eo etiam si castretur.

Chr?tien uses it only two other times in Yvain,69 once in Erec et Enide not at all in Clig?s, twice in Lancelot,71 and four times in Perceval.12 Given the same geographical and thematic situations, it points up the corre spondence between the two scenes, like the suggestion of corresponding physical and psychological storms. If this suicide scene is thematically parallel to the fight with Esclados, then Yvain's monologue as a whole clarifies the psychological connection between the fight and his first love for Laudine, because the extreme selfish ness of his monologue in the gatehouse reappears here as he bewails his loss of happiness (3522-56). Again Chr?tien undercuts it by setting Yvain's plight against another's through rhyme: And the ensuing exchange puts in relief the whole complex of superbia-invidia ira which Yvain betrays here, since he at first refuses to believe that anyone could be more unfortunate than he: This is Yvain's last such failure, however, and it is tactfully corrected by Lunete, who evidences the sympathetic understanding which Yvain momen tarily lacks: 'Par foi, fet ele, jel sai bien que c'est parole tote voire; mes por ce ne fet mie a croire que vos aiez plus mal de moi, et por ce mie ne le croi, qu'il m'est a vis que vos poez aler quel part que vos volez et je sui ci anprisonee.

He puts himself into God's hands (3715-16,3755-56), at the service of the distressed and helpless, as he continues to do from now on.73 Now, when he leaves the spring, the lion is 'toz jorz apr?s.' The proper order, momentarily in precarious balance, has been re-established, so that when Yvain arrives at the baron's castle he can declare to the men terrified of his lion: Fortitudo is the special virtue of the irascible part of the soul as sapientia is of the rational,74 and the ideal hero must combine both.75 As the Chevalier au Lion, Yvain does. The ferocity which he demonstrated in the first part of the romance is transferred to the lion in the second, and Yvain remains 'con frans et dolz' (4129). His fight with Harpin is a diverting game: Only when the lion leaps up 'par ire, et par grant force' (4215), does the humor become more cruel: A ce cop, li Lyons se creste de son seignor eidier s'apreste, 'Et ne por quant, n'en dotez rien, que je le garderai si bien qu'estre porroiz tot asse?r. ' (3793-95) el sane del cors, an leu de sausse, le fer de la lance li moille. (4196-97) 73 Acceptance of God's will is a distinctive leitmotif of the second half of Yvain, dramatic evidence of humilitas. Cf. 3715-16, 3754-56, 3760-61, 3829, 3850, 3870-71, 3932, 3977-85, 4052-53, 4057-69, 4132-33, 4900-01, 4942, 4954, 5019, 5034, 5046, 5055, 5169, 5244-45, 5332 35, 5474, 5789-90, 5793-801, 5927, 5977-84. It may be worth noting that when the seven sins are set against the seven Petitions ? as became popular in the twelfth century ? ira is opposed to 'fiat voluntas tua.' According to Hugh of St Victor, Exp. in Abdiam (PL 175.403) and De quinqu? septenis 3 (PL 175.407-08), 'Tertia petitio est contra iram, qua dicitur: Fiat voluntas tua, sicut in coelo et in terra. Hac sibi piacere indicat, quidquid voluntas Dei si ve in se, si ve in aliis secundum arbitrium suae dignationis dispens?t. Huic ergo petitioni datur spiritus scientiae, ut ipse ad cor veniens erudiat illud et salubriter compungat, ut sciat homo malum quod patitur ex sua culpa provenire: si quid autem boni habeat, ex misericordia Dei procedere; ac per hoc discat sive in malis, quae sustinet, sive in bonis, quae non habet, contra Creatorem non irasci sed per omnia patientiam exhibere. Optime ergo per compunc tionem cordis, quae spiritu scientiae operante interius ex humilitate nascitur, ira et indignatio animi mitigatur. ' 74 Apuleius, De Platone 2.6, makes the point explicitly, but it is obviously inherent in Plato's comparison (Republic 441a-442c; Calcidius c. 233, pp. 246-47) of the rational part of the soul to the rulers of a state and of the irascible part to its soldiers. 75 E.

(4213-23) Yvain's fights with Lunete's accusers and with the demons at Pesme Aventure are defensive exchanges of blow for blow76 until the lion intervenes. Its as saults upon the seneschal (4519-31) and the demons (5629-63) display, in the same vigorous language, the same terrific violence as its assault upon Harpin but without the same grotesque comedy. Even the stroke with which Yvain beheads one of the demons is controlled, effortless, and clean in contrast to the crude violence with which the lion mauls the second and tears its arm from its shoulder (5648-63). Just as the scene of attempted suicide beside the spring repeats and then corrects the excessive anger of Yvain's fight with Esclados and the excessive self-love of his infatuation with Laudine, the Harpin and Lunete episodes are antitypes of Yvain's tourneying with Gauvain and his broken promise to return to Laudine within a year. He refuses to allow Gauvain's sister and her ladies to prostrate themselves at his feet ? as he and Gauvain had effectively forced Arthur to do ? and he will not accept the land and wealth which the baron offers him in order to persuade him to stay 'ancor un po' (4051, 4037, 4061), Gauvain's family puts far more powerful pressures upon him than any Gauvain himself could have exerted, but this time Yvain does not succumb and keeps his engagement. Both his victories, over Harpin and the seneschal, demonstrate that with the lion as his ally?with the righteous anger, strength, and courage which it embodies (4215, 5526) controlled ? Yvain is an even greater knight than before. Humbly trusting in God ? and surely his willingness to take the lion from the battleground but not to reject its aid dramatizes that trust77 que por le r?aume de Garse ne voldroit que cele fust arse que il avoit ase?ree.

This is especially true of the Lunete episode, where the lion's help comes immediately after all the ladies who</page><page sequence="41">ghr?tien's 'yvain ' 185 ? the Chevalier au Lion is more than a match for the proud giant Harpin, who trusts only in his own strength (4203-04), and for all three of Lunete's accusers. When he has defeated them, his own restoration is complete. IV If Le Chevalier au lion were primarily about Yvain and his marriage with Laudine, it might end here. Instead, it is about chivalry, and the episodes of Pesme Aventure and of the dispute between the daughters of the Lord of Noire Espine develop that major theme, first enunciated in Chr?tien's prologue and Calogrenant's tale and everywhere implicit. They measure Yvain against the conventional norm rather than against his own past conduct. Yvain succeeds now where others have failed, not he himself. The change is one of emphasis. Yvain's story has from the outset anatomized one aspect of the larger theme. The episodes which delay his reconciliation with Laudine extend its scope. The Harpin and Lunete episodes provide structural and thematic links with the first part. The most important of these links is Gauvain's absence from Arthur's court on a quest for Guinevere, who has been abducted by Meleagant.78 Gauvain might otherwise have defended Lunete, whom he promised to serve 'et a mestier et sanz besoing' (2436), and his sister's family. As it is, Yvain must act in his place. Gauvain, moreover, has just returned from his quest when he promises to defend the cause of the elder daughter of the Lord of Noire Espine; and because 4 li miaudres li falloit ' ? even though she implored him ' en mainte meniere, / et par amor, et par proiere'79 ? the younger daughter must go in search of the Chevalier au Lion. These literal links point more and more insistently to the impotence of Arthur's court and of the chivalric ideal which it represents. To his astonish ment Yvain learns that Lunete could find no assistance there ? not even from Gauvain, since he was pursuing Meleagant and Guinevere (3686-714). Yvain's astonishment is greater still, the circumstance less accidental, the moral failure and its consequences for the innocent more striking, when the favor her cause have prayed God not to allow the hard-pressed Yvain to be defeated. But in this episode it is equally clear that the lion does not represent direct divine intervention, because the lion and Yvain are alike wounded, the lion so severely that Yvain must carry him off on his shield, and the two are healed together at a nearby castle. Yvain trusts in the aid of God and the Right and does not despise his lion (4323-30) not because all three are the same but because they all tend toward the same end: justice. 78 In Owein the Giant-of-the-mountain and Luned episodes have no connection with Gwalchmei, nor does Owein have to meet any deadline, though he arrives just as the fire in which Luned will be burned is being lit. 79 4758-60; cf. 4784-85.</page><page sequence="42">186 TRADITIO same explanation accounts for the baron's plight in the Harpin episode. The baron assures Yvain that he would have had aid if he had found Gauvain at the court, and he condemns the aggregate folly of Arthur, Keu, and Guinevere more bitterly and at far greater length than Lunete did (3702-03): 'Ne por quant ja ne l'en e?st menee, por rien qu'il pe?st, ne fust Kex qui anbricona le roi, tant que il li bailla la re?ne, et mist en sa garde. Cil fu fos et cele musarde qui an son conduit se f?a, et je resui cil qui i a trop grant domage et trop grant perte, que ce est chose tote certe que mes sire Gauvains li preuz por sa niece et por ses neveuz, fust ?a venuz grant ale?re se il se?st ceste aventure; mes il nel set, don tant me grieve que par po li cuers ne me crieve; einz est alez apr?s celui, cui Damedex doint grant enui, quant menee en a la re?ne.' (3915-33) And the impotence of the court to preserve justice is not simply reported but dramatized in the case of the daughters of the Lord of Noire Espine. There, moreover, Gauvain, the savior manqu? of the Harpin and Lunete episodes, actually defends the cause of injustice. Only the episode of Pesme Aventure is not connected with Arthur's court ? though Chr?tien has inserted it into the Noire-Espine episode, which is. Its generalizing force is all the greater as a consequence. To Arthur corresponds the king of the Isle as puceles, who aloit por apanre noveles par les corz et par les pa?s. S'ala tant come fos na?s qu'il s'anbati an cest peril. A mal e?r i venist il, que nos cheitives, qui ci somes, la honte, et le mal, en avomes, qui onques ne le desserv?mes. (5252-59) The folly is the same, only its consequences here extend directly to three hundred maidens and indirectly to an entire kingdom. Their plight is more</page><page sequence="43">Chretien's 'yvain' 187 economic and less romantic than the baron's or Lunete's. It dramatizes, however, the poverty to which the younger daughter of the Lord of Noire Espine would be reduced if her obviously just claim against her sister were not upheld. Gauvain, the embodiment of the Arthurian ideal, nevertheless stands with the elder sister and makes possible her injustice,80 so that it is paradoxically difficult to distinguish his conduct from that of Lunete's accusers, who were not courtly enough to refuse unfair odds of three to one in the trial by combat (3678-79). Moreover, the desire to ' alerpor apanre noveles' effective ly made Calogrenant go 'querant aventures' (175; 363-64). It made Arthur vow to see the marvellous spring within two seeks and there implore Yvain to tell them all It partly motivated Yvain in his quest for the spring. It is, in short, essential to the Arthurian ideal. The nature of true proesce and cortoisie, put in question by the opening scene of the romance and implicit throughout Yvain's adventures, is a special concern of the second part of Le Chevalier au lion. In the Harpin episode when the baron's sons are brought up to the castle on four emaciated cart-horses, uns nains, fel come boz anflez, les aloit costoiant toz quatre, onques ne les fina de batre d'unes corgiees a sis neuz don molt cuidoit feire que preuz; les batoit si que tuit seinnoient. (4097-4103) This dwarf, who thinks he is acting like a knight, is as disturbing an analogue to the Arthurian ideal as the giant bullherd was a contrast. The ladies of Laudine's court, however, define negatively an alternative when they lament Lunete's imminent execution: Lunete's active caritas is exactly the virtue which distinguishes Yvain's conduct in this second part, as self-serving did in the first. The distinction is basic to the chivalric ideal of service which Chr?tien propounds. Unlike cornant il a voit esploiti?; car molt avoit grant covoiti? de savoir tote s'avanture. (2295-97) ' Ja de ce n'iert parole feite que nus n'est mes frans ne cortois, einz demande chascuns ein?ois por lui, que por autrui ne fait sanz ce que nul mestier en ait. ' (4374-78) 80 Cf. 4780-93, 5844-47, 5878-82.</page><page sequence="44">188 TRADITIO all his opponents in the second part, Yvain conspicuously does not put him self first. The contrast is pointed in the Noire-Espine episode, culminating as it does in a duel between Yvain and Gauvain, as disturbing in its violence as Yvain's fight with Esclados. Gauvain is thoughtless at best and holds willfully to his indefensible decision to side with the elder daughter, apolo gizing to the younger, 'Amie, an vain me priez que je nel puis feire que j'ai anpris une autre afeire que je ne le lesseroie pas. ' (4762-65) The younger daughter echoes this reply but inverts its sense when she tells Arthur about Yvain: 'S'eiist il molt aillors a feire Ii frans chevaliers deboneire; mes de moi li prist tex pitiez qu'il a arrieres dos gitiez toz ses afeires por le mien. ' (5943-47) The basic difference is here: Yvain will abandon his own affairs for another's, and Gauvain will not. Gauvain is obviously arbitrary because he is unjust; Yvain is equally selfless because he does not know the younger daughter, nor she him (5981-84), and because he took up her cause in response to a second unknown maiden, to whom the first was likewise a stranger ('si n'est pas la besoingne moie, ' 5063). Although Gauvain and Yvain must be disguised, and the lion absent, for the duel to proceed, Chr?tien gives these mechanical prerequisites thematic point. Gauvain's disguise betrays his realization that his enterprise is not to his credit81 ? though he will not therefore give it up ? and the appearance of the lion immediately after the resolution of the combat, until then a draw, demon strates that Yvain is in fact a greater knight than his friend, since he has matched Gauvain without the aid of his lion, which would not have failed him if the fight had continued longer. Thus without overturning the donn?es of his mati?re, Chr?tien makes Yvain triumph dramatically over the embodiment of the chivalric ideal which first caused his downfall. Yvain and Gauvain, like Yvain and Esclados, hate each other mortally in this fight (6060), but here at the climax of Yvain's ?moral restoration their hatred is not personal or selfish. Since the dispute between the two daughters alone motivates the combat and since Yvain and Gauvain can see in each other only the anonymous agents of the two sides, we have to do here with the 81 In Owein (172) Gwalchmei by chance wears a new cloak which conceals his identity.</page><page sequence="45">Chretien's 'yvain' 189 abstract and absolute hatred of justice for injustice. Chr?tien insists upon Yvain's and Gauvain's love for one another as individuals in his long and paradoxical prologue to the fight (5992-6099). To emphasize Yvain's pres ent selflessness, which contrasts so vividly with the superbia and invidia which drove him to fury against Esclados, Chr?tien describes at length Yvain's grief once he realizes he has hurt his friend (6262-76), and even risks confusing the issue of* the younger daughter's rights by having Yvain attempt to make amends and honor Gauvain by declaring himself beaten (6283-85). The gesture involves an obvious fiction, since neither side has yet been beaten in a fight ended only by the approach of night. Gauvain, courteous as ever, refuses to accept it, insisting more honestly that Yvain, because of his prowess and the injustice of the sister for whom Gauvain fights, would have killed him if the duel had gone on much longer (6335-41); the lion's arrival confirms Gau vain's claim. 'Gariz et sains' (6518) after this last fight, Yvain leaves Arthur's court a third time, not alone as before but with the lion as his companion, wounded by love, not invidia. The final storm he raises at the spring is more violent than any of the others, but paradoxically it is entirely controlled and achieves reconciliation, not the discord of combat. The chivalric ideal which emerges from Le Chevalier au lion, and which is symbolized in the double figure of Yvain and his lion which gives the romance its name, is based on a classical model of moderation and rational control. More than a thousand years before Chr?tien wrote, it found succinct expression in Cicero: 'Sed ea animi elatio, quae cernitur in periculis et laboribus, si iustitia vacat pugnatque non pro salute communi, sed pro suis commodis, in vitio est; non modo enim id virtutis non est, sed potius immanitatis omnem humanitatem repellentis. Itaque probe definitur a Stoicis fortitudo, cum earn virtutem esse dicunt propugnantem pro aequitate.'82 In just this way, so long as he was motivated by superbia and invidia, all Yvain's prowess succeeded only in stripping him of his humanity, reducing him first morally then dramatically to the level of a beast; and the Arthurian ideal as represented by Gauvain is a perversion of fortitudo because it is exercised for its own sake apart from the common good. Chr?tien's originality and genius lie in his superbly skillful combination of this classical sens with Christian moral psychology and a Celtic mati?re to create a romance where no detail is irrelevant or misplaced, where characters and incidents are made with self-effacing art to form a pattern of symmetries and correspondences which illuminate each other and the whole.
