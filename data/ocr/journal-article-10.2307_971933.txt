<plain_text><page sequence="1">86 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIOUITY [Vol. 3, No. 1, 1992] importance of evaluating sources carefully and under- standing their biases before reconstructing the image of Huitzilopochtli. I found her postscript on Huitzil- opochtli and Quetzalcoatl most interesting and wished she had placed more emphasis on this topic. It shows how the two European traditions of depicting Huitzil- opochtli and Aztec society in general are still influenc- ing scholarly study and thought on the subject today. I feel I should preface any other comments on this book with the caveat that I believe I belong to the classical tradition ofthinking about Aztec society. With that in mind, I think more discussion about Huitzil- opochtli's role as a "newcomer" god to the central Mexican pantheon and how this affects his iconograph- ic attributes would have been appropriate. Huitzilo- pochtli may have only one uniquely identifying attrib- ute because other attributes have been borrowed from gods such as Tezcatlipoca who have a long history in central Mexico as well as in other parts of Mesoam- erica. Huitzilopochtli needed to rise from being a small tribal god to the foremost god of central Mexico, and in order to do that he had to adopt attributes that would allow him to "fit in" to the long-established pantheon that already existed in central Mexico. Overall I found this book to be well organized and informative. Its usefulness can go beyond that of the Aztec scholar and should be of interest to all scholars who study non-Western cultures through that thick hazy glass of a Western European bias that needs to be exposed from time to time to remind ourselves to look for the real images underneath. Comalcalco, Tabasco, Mexico: Maya Art and Archi- tecture. GEORGE F. ANDREWS. Rev. 2nd ed. La- byrinthos, Culver City, California, 1989. xx + 160 pp., photographs, illustrations, maps, bibliography. $40.00 (paper). Reviewed by Elena Kourembana Lincoln, Field Mu- seum of Natural History. Considerable excavation and consolidation work has been done at Comalcalco since the 1950s, but unfor- tunately very little has been published. This publica- tion (1989 revision of the first edition published in 1967) presents the results of a survey directed by George F. Andrews. The data presented are mainly descriptive, focusing on architectural remains and Maya structural techniques. The author, an architect, is interested in presenting the mechanics of the building construction and the sequential process of their collapse. Therefore, there is no sociocultural insight into ancient political and socioeconomic issues. At times, the book reads like a field guide or manual. Overall, Andrews has prepared a comprehensive study of the layout and the decoration of buildings with detailed measurements. The volume is divided into 10 short chapters and is accompanied by 13 oversized foldout maps of the site. It begins with a brief introductory chapter mentioning previous works at Comalcalco and outlines the meth- odological objectives of the study within the context of Maya archaeology in Tabasco. An interesting feature of Comalcalco, as a frontier Maya site, is the use of clay brick for the structures, whether it represents a localized adaptation or the intrusion of a foreign tra- dition of construction (p. 2). Chapter 2 provides a description of the natural en- vironment as prerequisite to an understanding of the occupied areas. Site limits are first established by the notable decrease in mound density, but there is no serious discussion concerning the size of Comalcalco. When determining the boundaries of a site the presence of pottery sherds are good indicators, yet the study or even the observation of surface ceramics is totally ig- nored in this survey. Another aspect of the natural envlronment is topography, communicated and re- corded by mapping procedures and graphic stylization with widely differing results. Different techniques of mapping and graphic stylization can produce carto- graphic variations. Andrews uses the so-called "Maler convention" and follows the example established at Tikal by Carr and Hazard. Chapter 3 treats architecture and focuses on three themes dealing respectively with (a) building types, (b) materials and construction, and (c) decoration. The section on building types identifies the basic structures: platforms, temples, palaces, and ball courts. Andrews presents ideal models for a temple and a palace and any variations are seen as "nontypical." Some com- pounds are labeled under nontypical buildings (struc- tures 1 and 2 in the acropolis); their uniqueness lies in the presence of unconventional patterns such as un- usual places for doors and the absence of sanctuaries. The section on materials and construction describes the two building technologies at Comalcalco. Fired- brick masonry buildings sit on top of the earlier, plaster- over-earth construction phase. There is no mention of the chronology of the site in reference to the individual architectural components. Andrews discussed a least- effort resource usage regarding the use of local clays for bricks. The third section, on decoration, describes moldings, doorways, and roof combs. Chapters 4-6 contain detailed descriptions of the buildings in the North Plaza and the Great Acropolis. The sections are illustrated with many photographs and drawings of particular buildings. Individual structures are discussed in reference to their architecture and dec- oration, which parallel those at Palenque. The similarity in architecture and art between Com- alcalco and Palenque has raised many questions about the relation between the two sites. Andrews briefly deals with some of these issues in the Epilogue. The first and most important question is whether Comalcalco and Palenque were contemporaneous. The ceramic chro- nology from Comalcalco is poorly known, but the two preliminary studies by Meighan and Peniche both agree on a Late Classic period date for the site. Clement Meighan, reporting on Ekholm's notes, says that Com- alcalco had a short and intensive occupation during the Late Classic period. Peniche's ceramic analysis in- dicates a long continuous occupation from the For- mative to the Postclassic periods. Assuming contemporaneity between Comalcalco and Palenque, the next question to be asked is on the nature of the contact. According to Eric Thompson, Palenque evolved and thrived as a major center because of its control over the Tabasco Gulf Coast. Andrews builds</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 87 upon Thompson's hypothesis and sees Comalcalco be- ing ruled by Palenque as a "provincial outpost," in even greater proximity to the coast. Joseph Ball and Jennifer Taschek present an interpretation that differs from Andrews's and Thompson's both in terms of chronology and sociopolitical interpretation in their paper in Mesoamerica After the Decline of TeotEhuacan A.D. 700-900 (edited by Diehl and Berlo, 1989). Ball and Tascheck suggest that Comalcalco was an "entre- pot" or a subsphere of Palenque for the Cholan trade network. According to their argument, when the site of Palenque collapsed there was a migration of Pal- enque people into Comalcalco, where they continued their"Palenque" heritage and customs, which even- tually evolved into Nahua-Maya. There is no question that there are similarities be- tween Palenque and Comalcalco: Andrews shows us specific examples by comparing buildings at both sites (i.e., Figure 121). However, the nature of the relation and the degree of sociocultural contact is still enigmatic and probably will remain so until we are better in- formed about the chronology of Comalcalco. Similar- ities in structural style are not necessarily indicative of contemporaneity or sharing of cultural traits. For ex- ample, ball courts are found as far north as southern Arizona, as far south as Costa Rica, and as far east as the island of Puerto Rico. One of the most interesting features of Comalcalco is a tomb inside Temple V of the Great Acropolis. The tomb was discovered in 1925 by Franz Blom and Ol- iver LaFarge and has been compared to Pacal's burial at Palenque. Stuccoed figures in the Tomb of the Nine Lords of the Night at Comalcalco have been compared with the ones on the walls of Pacal's tomb underneath the Temple of the Inscriptions at Palenque. Eric Thompson originally suggested that both sets of figures represent the nine lords of the Maya underworld. An- drews draws attention to the similarities in the figures of the two tombs-in their execution in low relief, rep- resenting "realistic" human forms (p. 95). An icono- graphic and thematic comparison of these two sets of figures indicates a similar theme. Stylistically, how- ever, they seem to vary. The Palenque figures are more elaborately dressed while the ones in Comalcalco wear loincloths with more simple headdresses. I would add that the personages at Comalcalco are also similar in gestures and attire to the figures in procession on one of the Bonampak murals (west wall of Room l, Struc- ture 1). Chapter 7 presents the corpus of graffiti incised on bricks in various buildings and provides numerous line drawings. There is a large degree of variation in the subject matter of these informal descriptions. Of par- ticular interest is an anthropomorphic winged figure looking as though it were attempting to fly. It is similar to the figure on the upper part of Stela 21 from the site of Oxkintok in the Puuc Hills (Pollock, The Puuc: An Architectural Survey of the Hill Country of Yucatan and Northern Campeche, Mexico, 1980). Anthropomor- phic winged figures are scarce and unique in Meso- american iconography, and the few examples that we have from the Yucatan seem to depict God K. A God K form with wings along his upper arms comes from Structure 4B 1 at Sayil. A miscellaneous sculpture piece in bas-relief from Maxcanu represents another anthro- pomorphic figure with a snake foot. Chapter 8 is a very short catalog of the hieroglyphic inscriptions. The chapter documents the various lo- cations where ancient writing is found, but no deci- pherments are offered. At Comalcalco, inscriptions are written on brick, and an Initial Series date of 9. 1 5.3 . 13. 13 has been suggested. The volume ends with a brief summary and an epilogue that summarizes the relative conclusions of the Comalcalco survey project, reiterating the similarities of this site to Palenque. While granting the importance and value of An- drews's comprehensive survey of the core section of Comalcalco, and his detailed measurements thereof, there is one important shortcoming of the study. A1- though the author describes and divides the site into three clusters of buildings he does not offer any soci- ocultural explanation or analysis of the settlement pat- tern. Description, ideally, should lead to some func- tional and sociocultural interpretation. Andrews has labeled the three largest and most im- portant groups of buildings as (1) the North Plaza, (2) Acropolis Plaza, and (3) East Acropolis. This apparent division suggests the existence of three political, eco- nomic, or religious foci that probably framed and maintained the ancient community at Comalcalco. Fu- ture anthropologically oriented research at this site should attempt to illuminate these and other processual matters. There are a few technical problems with the publi- cation such as printing errors on the foldout maps (numbers 12 and 13) where the north arrow is directed toward the east. Another very aggravating feature is that Andrews at times uses the English system of mea- surement referring to "feet," while in other places he uses the metric system. These flaws notwithstanding, Andrews's survey study clearly represents a major contribution to Maya set- tlement-pattern research. The maps are extremely valuable in presenting an accurate layout plan of Com- alcalco. The fact that so much archaeological work has been done at Comalcalco by American and Mexican institutions, and that so little has been published, makes Andrews's efforts in presenting his data all the more excellent and commendable.

That this volume sums up and makes known to the outside world an amazing decade of progress in Maya scholarship will not be denied. Of the 12 contributors and 13 chapters in this collection, not one is mediocre or unimportant. Unlike many if</page></plain_text>
