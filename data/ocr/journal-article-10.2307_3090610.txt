<plain_text><page sequence="1">DEBARATI SANYAL The Tie That Binds: Violent Commerce in Baudelaire's "La corde" Les illusions-me disait mon ami,-sont aussi innombrables peut- etre que les rapports des hommes entre eux, ou des hommes avec les choses. Et quand l'illusion disparait, c'est-a-dire quand nous voyons l'tre ou le fait tel qu'il existe hors de nous, nous eprouvons un bizarre sentiment, complique moitie de regret pour le fant6me disparu, moitie de surprise agreable devant la nouveaute, devant le fait reel. -Baudelaire, "La corde" (1864)1 Baudelaire's prose poem "La corde," inspired by the suicide of one of Edouard Manet's models, recounts how a painter took in a little boy to pose and to do minor chores around his studio. The child's initially sunny disposition gives way to mysterious fits of melancholy and an excessive taste for sugar and liqueurs. After threatening to send the child back to his parents, the painter goes off to take care of some busi- ness. Upon his return, he discovers that the boy has hanged himself. The painter informs the mother of the tragic news, and she begs him to give her the remains of her son's noose. Only when the painter receives letters of solicitation from his neighbors does it dawn on him that the mother, exploiting the superstition that to own a hanged person's rope brings luck, intends to sell its pieces as profitable consolation. "La corde" does not only demystify the "givenness" of maternal love by suggesting that it, too, has its price. It also examines the nature of art's attachment to its model, leading to a broader meditation on the threads that tie together the postrevolutionary community, or the corde of concorde. The poem may be read as a testament to Baudelaire's 1. "Illusions-my friend used to say-are perhaps as innumerable as the relation- ships between people, or between people and ihings. And when the illusion disappears, that is to say, when we see the creature or the thing as it exists outside of us, we experi- ence a strange feeling, complicated half by regret for the vanished phantom, half by pleas- ant surprise before the novelty, before the real fact."

The "unnatural" mother of the poem points to the emergence of an entirely different conception of the social family, one whose latent violence, I will suggest, harbors unex- pected affinities with revolutionary terror. The alleged purpose of "La corde" is to show that even an emotion as immutable, sacred, and natural as maternal love cannot be taken for granted. Indeed, the painter defends his initial blindness to the nature of the mother's request for the rope by invoking the unquestionable naturalness of the maternal instinct, an instinct that provides the foun- dation for the nuclear and social family alike: "S'il existe un phe- nomene evident, trivial, toujours semblable, et d'une nature a laquelle il soit impossible de se tromper, c'est l'amour maternel" [If there exists a phenomenon that is obvious, trite, immutable, and of a nature that would be impossible to mistake, it is maternal love]. Yet this self-iden- tical and immutable given, "l'illusion la plus naturelle" [the most nat- ural illusion; my italics], as the painter calls it, turns out to be the de- ceptive product of established cultural assumptions about the "nature" of the maternal instinct. Natural instincts and empirical phenomena, as the poem gradually discloses, are culturally produced illusions that have acquired the status of nature over time. Initially a trial of the maternal instinct, the poem swiftly engages in a broader consideration of the natural grounds for filiation, of the na- ture of man's relationship to men, and to things. From the outset, the bonds that tie the boy to the painter and to his parents are not natural or affective, but economic and contractual. The painter, seduced by the boy's appearance, asks his parents to surrender their son to his care. His proprietary attitude toward the child suggests a repressed and dena- tured paternity not unlike the mother's own travestied maternity: "je priais un jour a ses parents de vouloir bien me le ceder" [one day I asked his parents to hand him over]. The violence of the maternal contract, it turns out, will be fully matched by that of the artistic contract. At stake in the demystification of the "naturalness" of maternal love, then, is a parallel demystification of the life-enhancing powers of the artistic imagination. The aesthetic production of l'illusion la plus naturelle will have deadly repercussions on le fait rel, the empirical fact of another's body. The painter evokes his attraction to the boy in singularly acquisitive terms: "Ma profession de peintre me pousse a re- garder attentivement les visages, les physionomies, qui s'offrent dans</page><page sequence="3">134 Yale French Studies ma route, et vous savez quelle jouissance nous tirons de cette faculte qui rend a nos yeux la vie plus vivante et plus significative que pour les autres hommes (my italics)" [My profession as a painter impels me to examine the faces, the physiognomies, that offer themselves up/that I encounter on my way, and you know what delight we draw from that faculty that makes life more alive and more meaningful for us than for others]. The aristocratic and appropriative thrust of the artist's percep- tion is typical of the Baudelairean poet-flaneur of "Les foules, " who as- sumes the vacancy of all beings before his expropriating imagination: "Pour lui seul, tout est vacant" (1I:291) [For him alone, everything is va- cant]. A similar evacuation of the model's intrinsic properties occurs in his successive metamorphoses under the painter's brush: "Je l'ai transforme tantot en petit bohemien, tant6t en ange, tantot en Amour mythologique. Je lui ai fait porter le violon du vagabond, la Couronne d'Epines et les Clous de la Passion.... Cet enfant, debarbouille, devint charmant... " [I sometimes turned him into a little gypsy, sometimes into an angel, sometimes into a mythological Cupid. I made him bear the vagabond's violin and the Crown of Thorns.... Once washed clean, this boy was delightful]. At once painted and unpainted, transformed into so many conventional cultural and religious icons (several of which invoke martyrdom), the boy is docile and supple material in the painter's hands. No instance of reported speech breaks his conspicuous silence throughout the tale. The only details that rupture the propri- etary, aesthetic economy established by the painter are the child's "crises singulieres de tristesse precoce" [strange fits of precocious sad- ness]. These fits, significantly, remain uninterpreted by the painter, who merely notes their literal manifestations in the boy's excessive taste for sweets and liqueurs; "un gout immodere pour le sucre et les liqueurs" [an immoderate taste for sugar and liqueurs]. Melancholy, as that which exceeds cultural assumptions about childhood ("precoce"), and which challenges the painter's representational authority ("crises singulieres"), erupts as an "immoderate" taste for the superfluous ("le sucre et les liqueurs"). This fissure in the painter's economy, however, is immediately suppressed by the re-establishment of the implicit con- tract between artist and model, one resting upon the painter's right to dispose of the child as he deems fit: "je le menacai de le renvoyer a ses parents" [I threatened to return him to his parents]. The socially sanctioned commodification and aesthetic manipula- tion of the boy culminate in the portrait of his hanging body, signifi- cantly described by the painter as "le premier objet qui frappa mon re-</page><page sequence="4">DEBARATI SANYAL 135 gard" [the first object to strike my gaze; my italics]. The dangling corpse bears mute testimony to the underlying violence of a social and artis- tic process that puts real, living bodies into circulation for profit. The nature of the relationship between model and painter is eloquently conveyed in the pun, "Le dependre n'etait pas une besogne aussi facile que vous pouvez le croire" [to take him down was not as easy as you might think]. Dependre is but a letter away from depeindre, which is precisely what the painter does in his clinical account of the cadaver's "unhanging," suggesting thus the link between painting and hanging, representation and execution. Yet, the boy's mise-en-scene of his own death also endows his pre- viously imprinted body with an undecipherable opacity, a weight that challenges the painter's previous representational mastery. Baudelaire conveys the fleshly opacity of the child's body in vivid, tactile detail, and foregrounds its resistance to manipulation. Indeed, rigor mortis is so advanced by the time the painter discovers the gruesome scene that the clothes have to be torn from the child's body: "la rigidite cadave- rique etait telle que, desesperant de flechir les membres, nous dumes lacerer et couper les vetements pour les lui enlever" [the cadaverous rigidity was such that we gave up on bending his limbs, and were forced to slash and cut his clothes in order to take them off]. The puffiness of the boy's face, the folds of his neck, the stiff resistance of his limbs, and the dense weight of his body are ironic counterpoints to the fluidity of his previous incarnations. While the illusion la plus naturelle ostensi- bly demystified in the poem is maternal love, whose fait reel appears to be the more fundamental and natural instinct of greed, it is a de- mystification that, unbeknownst to the painter, fully implicates the artistic process itself. For the fait reel that the painter fails to acknowl- edge throughout the poem ultimately designates the facticity of the child's dead body, its obdurate materiality and resistance to the "natu- ralizing" illusions that have been painted upon it. The trial of maternal love thus fully implicates the process of artis- tic figuration.2 The underlying price of both the maternal and the artis- tic contracts is unveiled in all its violence when the boy stages himself as his own nature morte: "le petit monstre s'etait servi d'une ficelle fort mince qui etait entre profondement dans les chairs, et il fallait main- 2. See Steve Murphy, "Inquest and Inquisition in 'La corde,"' Dalhousie French Stud- ies 30 (1995): 65-91, for an in-depth reading of the relationship between painting and po- etry in "La corde" and the significance of the dedication to Manet in the context of Baude- laire's personal relationship with him and of their divergent aesthetic programs.</page><page sequence="5">136 Yale French Studies tenant, avec de minces ciseaux, chercher la corde entre les deux bour- relets de l'enflure, pour lui degager le cou" [the little monster had used a very thin string that had dug deep into his flesh, and I had to pry, with narrow scissors, into the swollen folds of his neck in order to release him]. The image of the painter digging deep into the child's flesh to ex- tract the noose captures the violence of this rapport, a violence matched by the mother's own extraction of the rope from the painter's home: "soudain, je compris pourquoi le mere tenait tant a m'arracher la fi- celle" [I suddenly realized why the mother was so intent on snatching the rope from me]. The artist, however, disavows any responsibility for the boy's suicide, blithely dismissing a police officer's suspicious queries as motivated by "une habitude d'etat de faire peur, a tout hasard, aux innocents comme aux coupables" [the professional habit of randomly frightening the innocent along with the guilty]. Yet even after accom- plishing the necessary rites in order to dispose of the cadaver and exor- cise its bothersome ghost by returning to his artistic labors, the painter is nevertheless unable to "extract" the boy from his conscience. The allusion to the boy's corpse embedded in the folds of the artist's brain ("ce petit cadavre qui hantait les replis de mon cerveau") [the little corpse haunting the recesses of my brain] recalls that of the rope em- bedded in the folds of the child's flesh, in an analogy that reiterates the association of peindre [to paint] with pendre [to hang]. But the capture of matter by aesthetic form is never entirely complete, as the model's unyielding body and its continued life suggest. It leaves behind a stub- born residue, a remnant lingering in the recesses of the artist's imagi- nation. The poem does not only scrutinize the act of painting but meditates more generally on the underlying price of transfiguring living bodies and things through "cette faculte qui rend a nos yeux la vie plus vivante et plus significative que pour les autres hommes" [that faculty that makes life more alive and more meaningful for us than for others]. What animates life into signification, it would seem, is the ability to extract from the fait reel the intensity and coherence of illusion. Poetry is also implicated in this meditation on representational violence, as the painter's allusion to a "nous" contaminating the silent interlocutor and author of the poem suggests. This typically Baudeairean ripple of complicity becomes all the more significant when we recall that the poem was inspired by the real suicide of Manet's model, Alexandre. Baudelaire is said to have read the text aloud before the painter, at a gathering shortly after the boy's tragic death. The image of Baudelaire</page><page sequence="6">DEBARATI SANYAL 137 uttering the words attributed to the painter-figure in the poem, in front of a silent Manet (thereby reversing the relationship between the speak- ing painter and the silent poet in the text) conveys the ways in which poetry and painting can be seen to converge in their potential violence toward a represented object. Indeed, "La corde" could be read as a par- odic literalization of Baudelaire's claim that his prose poems stand as worthy pendants to the lyric corpus of Les fleurs du mal.3 If we picture the painter as a poet, the rope as the lyre's string, then what the boy's nature morte suggests is nothing less than the price of lyric production. Far from the felicitous concordance of sights, sounds, and smells cele- brated in correspondances, the vital chain of analogies in this poem is frozen into a set of conventional, dead representational equivalences im- posed on a vulnerable-though ultimately recalcitrant-human body. "La corde" thus reveals the discrepancy between le fait reel and l'il- lusion la plus naturelle, between the body and its artistic representa- tion, and between the ambiguous nature of the maternal instinct and its cultural construction. As the title's near homonym-concorde- suggests, also at stake in this demystification of art and maternity is the social contract itself. The mother's betrayal of the umbilical cord radiates outward and implicates the concorde that binds together the larger social family. The thread weaving together the social family, "la corde" of "concorde," has quite literally fallen into pieces. Significantly, when the artist discovers the hanging body, his neigh- bors turn a deaf ear to his cries for help: "J'ai neglige de vous dire que j'avais vivement appele au secours; mais tous mes voisins avaient re- fuse de me venir en aide, fideles en cela aux habitudes de l'homme civil- ise qui ne veut jamais, je ne sais pourquoi, se meler aux affaires d'un pendu" [I forgot to mention that I had called loudly for help; but none of my neighbors came to my assistance. In that, they were faithful to the habits of civilized man, who, I know not why, never wants to get tangled up in the business of the hanged]. Civilized man, Baudelaire 3.

Certainly the reappearance of the term pendant in Baudelaire's letter marks it as his own.</page><page sequence="7">138 Yale French Studies suggests with grim humor, will only entangle himself in the affairs of the hanged in the most literal sense of the expression. For it is the rope (l'affaire) of the hanged, and the business (affaires) it enables, that de- fine a new community, one bound (mele)-albeit anonymously-by the ritual purchase of the noose. "La Corde," then, does not only put on trial the metaphorical process through which the artist transforms his material-the bodies and things that nourish his art. It simultane- ously questions the symbolic threads that bind together the postrevo- lutionary social fabric, and the illusions they weave around the nature of man's bond with men and things. Baudelaire's oeuvre is suffused with allusions to the legacy of the Revolution. His profound ambivalence toward his republican fervor in 1848 manifests itself in vengeful outbursts that confront the utopi- anism of revolutionary rhetoric with the bankruptcy and concealed vi- olence of actual social and political practice. The prose poems in par- ticular ironically recollect the linguistic vestiges of the revolution-its vocabulary of equality, fraternity, concord, patrie-in order to expose their travestied afterlife in the bourgeois order of the Second Empire.4 These defigurations du langage politique [disfigurements of political language] disclose the ways in which the revolution's utopian rhetoric has been coopted, homogenized, and short-circuited.5 They also reveal a profound shift in the conceptualization of violence. No longer dis- played in the spectacular and bloody purges of the Terror, violence is an invisible force woven into the very fabric of postrevolutionary so- cial life. Baudelaire's enigmatic celebrations of the revolution as radi- 4. Linda Orr views the saturation of Baudelaire's writings with revolutionary rhetoric as symptomatic of a failed attempt to use and transcend the omnipresent and omnivi- rous political vocabulary of his time. She shows how his ostentatious repugnance toward the Revolution (shared by Marx and Flaubert) deflects from his actual engagement in- if not cooptation by-its shameful discursive legacy: "Baudelaire protests that he is an aristocrat of art, but he knows, as Vigny knew before him, that the only language possi- ble is the one steeped in Rousseau and the Jacobins, twisted by contemporary 'demo- cratic' literature ... Baudelaire succeeded in making us forget the degree to which his words were saturated with the ubiquitous discourse of his century." Orr, "Repulsive Recollections: After the Revolution, French Romantic Thought," Stanford Literary Re- view 6/1 (Spring 1989): 36. While I agree with Orr's assessment, I want to suggest that, far from making us forget this saturation, Baudelaire takes great pains to remind us of it. By displaying how even poetry is bogged down in the cliched and defunct vocabulary of republican idealism, he provides an ironic critique of the Revolution's failure to make good on its promises. 5. I am of course alluding to Barbara Johnson's seminal work on the prose poems, De- figurations du langagepoetique, an essay that throughout suggests the homologous func- tioning of poetry and politics.</page><page sequence="8">DEBARATI SANYAL 139 cal destruction-"Je dis Vive la Revolution! comme je dirais: Vive la Destruction! Vive l'Expiation! Vive le Chatiment! Vive la Mort!" (II: 961) [I say Long live the Revolution! as I would say Long live Destruc- tion! Long live Expiation! Long live Punishment! Long live Death!]- are attempts to resuscitate the violence so visibly displayed and ac- knowledged during the Terror, and so insidiously disarticulated under the reign of Napoleon III. His poetry's distorted allusions to the revo- lution's discursive legacy, I will suggest, press into visibility the latent violence of the Second Empire.6 Given Baudelaire's fascination with the fate of the revolution's dis- cursive legacy, it is not surprising that he found Robespierre's rhetoric, his "style de glace ardente, recuite et congele comme l'abstraction" (1:592) [his style of fiery ice, glazed and frozen like abstraction] more worthy of interest than his actions.7 Echoes of what the poet called his "style sentencieux dont ma jeunesse s'est enivree" [the sententious style on which my youth got drunk] may be discerned in the most star- tling places. Consider, for instance, Robespierre's famous rapport du 18 Floreal and its celebration of fraternal bonds tying together the uni- versal human family: "Le veritable pretre de l'ttre supreme, c'est la na- ture, son temple l'univers, son culte, la vertu, ses fetes la joie d'un grand peuple rassemble sous ses yeux pour resserrer les doux noeuds de la fra- ternite universelle et pour lui presenter l'hommage des coeurs sensi- bles et purs."8 It is tempting to hear reverberations of this imagery in 6. See Richard Terdiman's Present Past: Modernity and the Memory Crisis (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1993) for a powerful study of the relationship between com- modity-production, the formalist literary project, and the Second Empire's masking of sociopolitical instability through a forgetting of history (an amnesia staged, for example, by Napoleon III's declaration of amnesty). For Terdiman, intertexuality and other forms of interpretive undecidability in an author such as Baudelaire reveal the "semiological disquiet" latent in the attempt to make the present-and the work of art-immobile and absolute entities cut off from the history of their production. 7. "Robespierre n'est estimable que parce qu'il a fait quelques belles phrases" (1:680) [Robespierre only deserves to be esteemed for coining a few beautiful sentences], Baude- laire declares, repudiating any substantive affiliation to revolutionary politics. Yet dur- ing the active phase of his republicanism, Baudelaire actually joined the Societe repub- licaine centrale founded by Blanqui in 1848. As Claude Pichois notes, Baudelaire saw in Blanqui a Robespierre of the nineteenth-century: "By the integrity and intransigence of his republicanism, and by his revolutionary spirit, Blanqui was for Baudelaire a sort of nineteenth-century Robespierre."

More relevant to "La corde" and its implicit scrutiny of the body politic, however, is the im- age of fraternity as a knot tying together the human family. Robes- pierre's douxnoeuds de la fraternite mutate into a strangulating noose whose severed fragments, once put into circulation, will foster a chill- ing parody of universal brotherhood. The transparency of hearts, or Robespierre's "coeurs sensibles et purs" constituting both the etymo- logical root and principle of concorde, is travestied into a cluster of anonymous transactions feeding greed and superstition.9 As the por- trait of the parental figures and their neighbors suggest, "La corde" at- tests to a crisis in representing a community through metaphors of nat- ural filiation. The poet's later works insistently implicate the utopian vocabulary of communion, fraternity, equality, and concord with the reality of col- lective violence, of terror. Nowhere is the perversion of fraternity into fratricide more compellingly staged than in "Le gateau" (1862), pub- lished two years before "La corde." The prose poem details the poet's journey through an idealized, romantic landscape. In a beatific moment of lyric elevation, the voyager, soaring on the wings of l'universelle analogie, succumbs to Rousseauist reflections on the essential good- ness of man: "dans mon total oubli du mal terrestre, j'en etais venu a ne plus trouver si ridicules les journaux qui pretendent que l'homme est ne bon" [in my complete oblivion to earthly evil, I no longer found so ridiculous those newspapers proclaiming that man is born good]. His epiphany, however, is brutally interrupted by a typically Baudelairean fall. Having offered some bread to an urchin on the streets, another lit- tle fellow, "si parfaitement semblable au premier qu'on aurait pu le 9. See Baudelaire's "La solitude" for another instance in which fraternity is associ- ated with commerce and violence. The poet-figure derisively describes "les belles agapes fraternelles" as the collectivity's attempt to co-opt individual thought as if it were an eco- nomic category, a common good to be homogeneously distributed and consumed. In the 1855 version, the poet-figure responds to the chattering and appropriating throng by iron- ically reifying his vision of the sublime as an inalienable private property ("ce coup d'oeil lui a conquis une propriete individuelle inalienable") [this glance has conquered for him an inalianable private property], thus mimicking the discourse he derides.</page><page sequence="10">DEBARATI SANYAL 141 prendre pour son frere jumeau" [so perfectly like the first that he could have been his twin brother], surges out of nowhere and wrestles his "brother" to the ground. The unsuspecting narrator has engendered a vicious struggle in which the twins quite literally "break bread" until only crumbs remain, as they tear each other to pieces.'1 The poet con- cludes wryly, "Il y a donc un pays superbe oui le pain s'appelle du gateau, friandise si rare qu'elle suffit pour engendrer une guerre parfaitement fratricide!" [there is a superb country where bread is called cake, a treat so rare that it suffices to engender a perfectly fratricidal war]. The in- dividual poet's fall from an edenic correspondence between men and things finds its historical correlative in the fall from the illusion of fra- ternity to the reality of fratricide, from the the idealism of revolution to the reality of terror. A similar allegory is subtly embedded in "La corde" and its ironic commentary on the bankruptcy of a unified body politic, one whose underlying corruption is figured through the mother's unnatural body, her loyalty to the economic chain rather than the umbilical cord.11 Robespierre's doux liens de la fraternite have mutated into a strangu- lating noose that points to the emergence of an anonymous commu- nity around the dead body of a child. Could we then read the child's suicide as an allegory for the slain republic? Certainly the child-mar- tyr who dies in suicidal loyalty for the patrie is a familiar figure in the iconography of the revolution. The thirteen-year old Joseph Bara, for example, died opposing the Vendee rebels and became a cult republi- can figure extolled by Robespierre, along with the young Agricola Viala, shot by the federates in 1793. Both children, in their intransi- gent and literal espousal of the Jacobin motto liberte, egalite, frater- nite ou la mort, incarnated the ideal of Terror. Their suicidal opposi- tion, made in the name of the republic, and memorialized in paintings such as David's Death of Bara, was part of a symbolic legacy that may 10. The allusion to the boys as twin brothers locked in vicious combat seems to par- ody familiar representations of "fraternite" as two cherubic boys locked in an embrace. See for instance the illustrations in Marcel David, op. cit.: plates 17-18. 11. Baudelaire tirelessly contested utopian theories of progress, arguing that "II faut toujours en revenir a de Sade, c'est a dire a l'Homme Naturel, pour expliquer le mal" (I: 595) [To explain evil, one must always return to Sade, that is to say, to Natural Man]. The fallenness of nature is often represented through the abjection of the female body, as Baudelaire's well-known misogynist declaration attests: "La femme est naturelle, c'est- a-dire abominable" (I:677) [Woman is natural, that is to say, abominable]. It is not sur- prising, then, that Baudelaire should figure the corruption of the body politic through a woman's betrayal of the maternal instinct.</page><page sequence="11">142 Yale French Studies well have informed Baudelaire's portrait of Manet's boy-model in "La corde."12 Still another sacrifical figure and scene are invoked in the poem's fi- nal, ironic gesture toward the collective consumption of the noose: Louis XVI, his decapitation and the alleged distribution of his clothing and body.13 As Lynn Hunt has shown, the parsing out of the king's body and possessions-his blood, hair, and clothing-was a rite intended to disseminate his sacredness onto the people. Louis-Sebastien Mercier gives a gruesome account of the festivity surrounding the King's de- capitation and the alleged circulation of his body and belongings: Son sang coule; c'est a qui y trempera le bout de son doigt, une plume, un morceau de papier; l'un le goute, et dit: II est bougrement sale! Un bourreau sur le bord de l'echafaud, vend et distribue des petits paquets de ses cheveux; on achete le cordon qui les retenait; chacun remporte un petit fragment de ses vetements ou un vestige sanglant de cette scene tragique. J'ai vu defiler tout le peuple se tenant sous le bras, riant, cau- sant familierement, come lorsqu'on revient d'une fete.14 12. See Baudelaire's Le musee du Bazar Bonne-Nouvelle for his appraisal of David's work, including "Marat" and "La mort de Socrate." No mention is made of "La mort de Bara," but the description of "Marat" is full of admiration and suggestively called a "gift to the grieving nation" (11:410). For a discussion of the cult of Bara, see Thomas Crow, Emulation: Making Artists for Revolutionary France (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1995) and La mort de Bara (Avignon: Fondation du Museum Calvet, 1989). It is interest- ing to note-in the context of "La corde" and its perversion of the relationship between mother and son-that Joseph Bara joined the army to support his widowed mother and was commemorated as an exemplary son. 13. Could we read an allusion to the guillotine's blade in the chilling detail of the painter's scissors cutting into the boy's neck? It is interesting to note that Baudelaire had initially written "col" (which directly invokes "decollation") rather than "cou." The poet's interest in capital punishment and sacrifice has been treated with unparalleled in- sight by Pierre Pachet in Le premier venu. Essai sur la politique Baudelairienne (Paris: Denoel, 1976). A discussion of his perspective exceeds the scope of this article, but my reading of "La corde" and of Baudelaire's politics as a self-sacrificial poetics is informed by and in dialogue with Pachet's reading of the poem (through Bataille's text on Manet) as an example of a "murder through negligence." Pachet examines how capital punish- ment, suicide, and conspiracy are privileged topoi in Baudelaire, intended to reveal and disrupt an increasingly conformist social order that coopts all individual thought. Yet I believe this profound political pessimism to be counterbalanced by Baudelaire's scrutiny of the structural homologies between poetry and politics, an ironic demystification and self-demystification that functions as its own species of engagement. 14.

An executioner at the edge of the scaffold sells and distributes little packets of his hair; people buy the string that once attached them, every one takes away a little piece of his clothing, or a bloody vestige of this tragic scene. I saw the entire population go by, arms linked, laughing and chatting famil- iarly, as if returning from a celebration. In this spectacular rite, a community is symbolically founded and nour- ished by the distribution of its sovereign-victim's body. The cannibalis- tic imagery of Mercier's description, and the reference to the ribbon or cordon tying the king's hair, are details that resonate powerfully with the prospective circulation and consumption of the noose in "La corde." Designated as horrible et chere relique [a horrible and cherished relic], the noose will serve as an ironic substitute for the sacred body, ushering in a community founded not on symbolic parricide, but rather, symbolic infanticide, an anonymous community governed by the laws of com- merce: "Et alors, soudainement, je compris pourquoi la mere tenait tant a m'arracher la ficelle, et par quel commerce elle entendait se consoler" [And I suddenly realized why the mother was so intent on snatching the rope from me, and by what trade she intended to console herself]. Like many of his generation, Baudelaire was fascinated by the ritu- alistic and sacrificial elements of the French Revolution, the spectac- ular reversibility of victim and executioner staged by the decapitation of the king. Consider, for example, the following stanza from "Le voy- age," which could provide its own pendant or gloss on Mercier's ac- count of the bloody feast consecrating the king's execution: Le bourreau qui jouit, le martyre qui sanglote; La fete qu'assaisonne et parfume le sang; Le poison du pouvoir enervant le despote Et le peuple amoureux du fouet abrutissant (I:132).15 The ecstatic executioner, the sobbing martyr / The feat seasoned and scented with blood / The poison of power irritating the despot / And the mob in love with the deadening whip. Extolling somewhat theatrically the festive carnage of the revolution, such passages resurrect the violent origins of the postrevolutionary so- 15. A stanza to compare with Baudelaire's conflation of the bourgeoisie and the peu- pie in his description of the violence of the June days: "Les horreurs de juin. Folie du peu- ple et folie de la bourgeoisie. Amour naturel du crime" (1:679) [The horrors of the June days. Madness of the mob and of the bourgeoisie. Natural love of crime.]</page><page sequence="13">144 Yale French Studies cial contract, a violence that has become clouded and diffused by the apparently benign mediocrity of Napoeon III and his authoritarian de- mocracy.16 The occluded brutality of the "lien social" is latent through- out "La corde," where the community, so conspicuously absent for most of the tale, virtually reconstitutes itself around the boy's dead body and seeks to appropriate the severed fragments of his noose, in a cannibalistic ritual reminiscent of the king's execution. Baudelaire's dictum, "toute revolution a pour corollaire le massacre des innocents" [All revolutions have as corollary the massacre of in- nocent people] is an eloquent comment on the price of revolution and counter-revolution, and of the murderous rites of collective purifica- tion. Yet "La corde" also suggests that, unlike the bloody spectacles of revolution (the Terror, the June days), the violence particular to the postrevolutionary epoch is insidiously woven into the social fabric by the mercenary logic of commerce. Attesting to a crisis in representing the postrevolutionary collective as bound by the harmonious threads of fraternite and concorde, "La corde" points to the emergence of an or- der where the logic of the market, in service of superstition, fosters its own species of terror. A possession relinquished, if not sold, by his par- ents, figuratively consumed by the painter, his family and neighbors, the boy symbolically gestures toward the bodies and beings that suffer the price of new social modes of production and consumption. Both at the center and the margins of the relations enabled by his body, he is-significantly-barred from consumption. His "immoderate and ex- cessive" tastes are forbidden and threatened with punishment. His sui- cide, then, is a powerful demystification of the underlying logic gov- erning both aesthetic and social production. By staging himself as a nature morte, the boy literalizes his own reification, and unveils the latent violence of a community in which a person's body only acquires value through its symbolic circulation.17 16. The reference to "le peuple amoureux du fouet abrutissant" conjures up the poet's disillusionment with the overwhelming majority who supported, through plebiscite, le- gitimating Napoleon's coup d'etat: "In short, before history and the French people, the great glory of Napoleon III will have been to prove that the first person to come along can govern a great nation by simply seizing the telegraph and the national press. Those who believe that such things can be achieved without the consent of the people are idiots, as are those who believe that glory can only find its basis in virtue. Dictators are the lack- eys of the people-nothing more-a pathetic role indeed, and glory is but the product of one mind's adaptation to the nation's stupidity" (1:692). 17. In keeping with the spirit of the market, a body acquires value when it yields more than has been invested into it. As Baudelaire trenchantly says in his notebooks: "Le com-</page><page sequence="14">DEBARATI SANYAL 145 Baudelaire fully grasped the consequences of revolutionary upheav- als in the body politic for the living and vulnerable bodies within it. As a poet-dandy and an allegorist, he intimately knew such violence to be the material consequence of idealist systems imposing their form upon an embodied and differentiated social content. His provocative decla- ration, made in the early days of the abortive Second Republic, indi- cates a keen awareness of the human cost of revolutionary upheaval: "Lorsque Marat, cet homme doux, et Robespierre, cet homme propre, demandaient, celui-la trois-cent mille tetes, celui-ci, la permanence de la guillotine, ils obeissaient a l'ineluctable logique de leur systeme" [When Marat, that gentle man, and Robespierre, that unsullied man, requested, the one, three hundred thousand heads, and the other, the permanence of the guillotine, they were obeying the ineluctable logic of their system].18 The poet's apodictic declarations about the bloody realities of revolution are more than the provocative boutades of an aesthete thrilling to the spectacle of history. They are unflinching, if sardonic, assessments of the price of revolution. Revolutionary utopi- anism, in its vision of a body politic as matter to be shaped into coher- ence and purified of undesirables, is almost always associated with sac- rificial terror in Baudelaire's thought. For the revolutionary necessarily turns a blind eye to the human cost of transformation, to the bodies that were once attached to the three hundred thousand heads requested by Marat, that is to say, to le fait reel. Perhaps even more unbearable than the spectacular despotism of the Terror for Baudelaire, however, was the headless, flabby despotism of the multitudes in postrevolutionary France. His outbursts against the formless hydra of democracy should not be dismissed as the histri- onics of an aristocratic aesthete repudiating his dabbling in republican merce, c'est le prete-rendu, c'est le pret avec le sous-entendu: Rends moi plus que je ne te donne" (I: 703, my italics) [Commerce is a loan returned, it is a loan with an implicit "Give me back more than I gave you]. "La corde" explores this implicit premise: the mother makes a profit off the death of her child; the painter's investment in his model(s) must have been amply repayed by his paintings, if his "business" keeps him out for sev- eral hours at a time. As for the neighbors who solicit the rope, their everlasting fortune will only cost them a few francs. 18. Claude Pichois et Jean Ziegler, Baudelaire (Paris: Julliard, 1987), 269.

It betrays an obscure yet remarkably prescient sense of the violences underlying a decentered, commercial metropolis: "mais Cela, cette cohue de vendeurs et d'acheteurs, ce sans nom, ce monstre sans tete, ce deporte derriere l'Ocean, Etat!" (II: 327) [but That, this mob of sellers and buyers, this no name, this headless monster, this deported thing behind the ocean, a State!]. A social field governed by the fluctuating rules of the market, politically mystified by an apparent diffusion of class antagonism, and in which "this mob" blindly collaborates with its own subjection-this also seems to have been Baudelaire's thumbnail sketch of the brave new world inaugu- rated by the Second Empire. In his portrait of Theophile Gautier, Baudelaire proposes a curious parallel between the utopianism of revolutionary thought and the suf- focating conformism of its failed aftermath. He blames this tyrannie contradictoire on the fact that France, and "le caractere utopique, com- muniste, alchimique, de tous ses cerveaux ne lui permet qu'une pas- sion exclusive: celle des formules sociales. Ici, chacun veut ressembler a tout le monde, mais a condition que tout le monde lui ressemble" (11:125) [the utopian, communist, alchemical character of all its brains allows for only one passion: social formulas. Here, everyone wants to be like everyone else, but only if everyone else is like them]. The utopian attempt to alchemically transform the world to the measure of its abstract formulas is echoed in the majority's desire to contemplate and consume its flattering self-images in art. The revolutionary's will to purification thus finds its degraded correlative in the bourgeoisie's attempt to hold the multiplicity of its social and cultural environment in the strangling grip of its conformism. The violence of this passion for narcissistic self-replication is hauntingly conveyed throughout 19. Linda Orr has persuasively argued that Baudelaire's turn to violence in his poetry and notebooks is a vengeful and fruitless exorcism of his generation's past republicanism and its discursive debt to Robespierre, but also, more shamefully, to Proudhon and Michelet: "The Terror was wandering or erring in the nineteenth century in the form of these misreadings, as errors that produced this gooey mess, worse than the Terror itself, as far as Baudelaire was concerned. In fact he fantasized about resorting to his own ter- ror as the only way of getting out of the twisted legacy of the Terror." Headless History: Nineteenth-Century French Historiography of the Revolution (Ithaca: Cornell Univer- sity Press, 1990), 28. Again, I agree with the general thrust of Orr's argument, but point out that Baudelaire's ironic rewriting of that discourse deftly punctures its legitimacy in order both to critique the failure of republican idealism and to show how the misuses of its rhetorical legacy are precisely what blind people to the latent violence of their every- day practices, as the example of commerce suggests in "La corde."</page><page sequence="16">DEBARATI SANYAL 147 Baudelaire's poetry. The usurping twin brother of "Le gateau" or the malevolent, proliferating old men of "Les sept veillards," recover some of the disquiet occulted by the apparently benign cult of universal sameness. "Non seulement je serais heureux d'etre victime, mais je ne hairais pas d'etre bourreau-pour sentir la revolution de deux manieres" (II:961) [Not only would I gladly be the victim, I would also not abhor being the executioner, in order to experience the Revolution both ways], announced Baudelaire toward the end of his life. In a sense, his vocation as poet locked him into this contradictory historical predica- ment long before he chose to embrace it. For the poet-dandy is at once the despotic figure par excellence; his sovereign imagination "exe- cutes" a recalcitrant and fragmentary reality in its image. And yet, as Walter Benjamin has shown, the poet-merchant is also at the mercy of the market's stranglehold. The hanging boy of "La corde," whose noose suggests voicelessness made visible, is a striking avatar for this predica- ment. An anterior version of the poem makes this parallel more ex- plicit, for it concludes thus: "Un metre de corde de pendu, a cent francs le decimetre, l'un dans l'autre, chacun payant selon leurs moyens, cela fait mille francs, un reel, un efficace soulagement pour cette pauvre mere" (1:339) [One meter of a hanged person's rope, at one hundred francs per decimeter, all in all, each paying according to his means, it comes to one thousand francs, a real, an efficient relief for this poor mother].20 How could the fate of the noose, the appraisal and circula- tion of its fragments, not resonate with that of poetry and its circula- tion in the newspapers? As each decimeter of rope is worth one hun- dred francs, similarly, each line of Baudelaire's prose poems fetched roughly 0.15 francs apiece. The preface to Le spleen de Paris fully ac- knowledges that the prose poems emerge out of these new conditions for literature's production and consumption. Advertised as a corpus that can be hacked into pieces (or tronpons), the format of these poems is designed to provide "admirables commodites" for the writer, editor, and reader alike as the text passes through their hands: "Considerez, je 20. The parallel between the poet and the hanged (which gestures back to Villon) transforms the text into a symbolic scaffold, a "gibet symbolique oi pendait mon image" ("Un voyage a Cythere"). For a political reading of "Un voyage a Cythere," which sees the "pauvre pendu muet" of the 1855 version as an allegory of the ritual killing of the Second Republic, see Richard Burton's Baudelaire and the Second Republic: Writing and Revolution (Oxford: Clarendon Press, New York: Oxford University Press, 1991), 312- 19.</page><page sequence="17">148 Yale French Studies vous prie, quelles admirables commodites cette combinaison nous of- fre a tous, a vous, a moi et au lecteur. Nous pouvons couper oiu nous voulons" (1:275) [Consider what admirable commodity such a combi- nation provides for all, for you, me and the reader. We may cut where we please]. A textual body cut up into fragments in order to facilitate its circulation, the strings of the poetic lyre on sale for a few francs apiece, such metaphors capture some of the violence of the market's logic, and of literature's paradoxical implication in it. Poetry has relin- quished its hieratic autonomy. It is coopted and cut up by the demands of an urban consumer culture, victimized or prostituted by its readers' narcissistic investments. Yet, as Baudelaire also suggests throughout his oeuvre, art in its own way participates in the (dis)figuration of bod- ies, the capture and shaping of matter into symbolic form. Poetry's ide- alizing force resonates and even at points collaborates with the broader cultural logics of representation that violently imprint a mobile and differentiated social body. That Baudelaire was able to probe the depth and complexity of poetry's imbrication within shifting forms of vio- lence speaks to his acutely ethical understanding of history. For to in- habit the oscillation between victim and executioner, alternatively and reciprocally, is to deeply understand the human cost of the revolu- tions-both spectacular and veiled-that unfold around us.21 It is impossible to impose neat, allegorical closure upon Baude- laire's poetry, and teasing out the possible historical significances of the poet's notorious ironies is risky business indeed. By applying pres- sure to the linguistic ambiguities of "La corde" and spinning out the political resonances of its imagery, I have tried to shed some light on the poet's prescient understanding of terror not as a historical event, but rather, as a force infiltrating every nerve of the postrevolutionary social body. The ritual public executions of the Terror exhibited the sacrifices that founded and consecrated a new social order. Besides spo- radic resurgences that failed to bring about the republic, these purga- tive violences, Baudelaire suggests, sank underground. A diffuse force nourishing a decapitated social organism, one of terror's most insidi- ous new faces is commerce. The illusions bred by commerce are as in- 21. "Car tout est a la fois queue et tete, alternativement et reciproquement" (1:275) [For everything is at once head and tail, alternately and reciprocally], Baudelaire says of his prose poems, suggesting that literary form both accommodates and disrupts con- temporary ideological investments in the act of reading. I have attempted to suggest how this formal self-reflection productively challenges the commercialization of literature and, by extension, demystifies the commodification of bodies in the literary and social texts.</page><page sequence="18">DEBARATI SANYAL 149 numerable as the relations between men and men, men and things, and men as things. It is perhaps Baudelaire's most enduring gift as a poet- one for which he dearly paid the price-that he did not attempt to tear this veil of illusions, but instead, illuminated from within the intri- cacy of its weave.</page></plain_text>
