<plain_text><page sequence="1">Dissection as Inquiiry Using the "Peanut Observation Activity To Promote a Revised Paradzgm of Dissection &amp; Facilitate Student Involvement &amp; Understanding Penny L. Bernstein Dissection has become the focus of intense debate in the last several years. As a biologist and an educator work- ing with inquiry approaches to teach- ing science, I feel it may be time to redefine the goals and objectives of this activity, and involve students in determining when and how it should be used. I would like to report on an inquiry-based activity that is designed to broaden the definition and scope of dissection. It uses the well-liked "peanut observation activity" as a lead-in for student discussion of the pros and cons of dissection and for learning about the benefits of this procedure. The peanut observation activity has become a favorite for many teachers. It was introduced in the last 10 years as one of many hands-on activities designed to teach students the so- called "process skills" of science- making observations, forming hypoth- eses, experimenting, analyzing results and drawing conclusions. Generally, the peanut activity is used to promote observation skills. However, there are no similarly use- ful or popular activities to introduce students to the skills and concepts dissection of an organism, especially an animal, is designed to teach. Indeed, the term dissection has come to be associated only with animals, and there is some debate as to why dissec- tion should be done at all and what concepts should be learned from it. (For very recent examples, see the edi- torial by Runkle &amp; Granger about ani- mal use in teaching and research in Science 1997 and the letters that fol- lowed [Science 1997], or the Letters section in The American Biology Teacher 1998.) Further, many students seem especially reluctant to begin dissection of animals and have difficulty under- standing the value of the exercise, at least beforehand (Solot &amp; Arluke 1997). Indeed, groups such as Psychologists for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PSYETA 1997; Shapiro 1991) have encouraged a student movement that has resulted in both precollege teach- ers and college professors offering alternative assignments to fulfill the animal dissection requirement. As a scientist, I find the current state of dissection as a teaching activity- both its use and its avoidance-dis- turbing. I feel scientists have failed to convey to teachers and students the importance and appropriateness of this activity. Animal dissection has long been viewed by many educators, and perhaps by most scientists as well, as an anatomy lesson (Solot &amp; Arluke 1997): a way to learn about our own internal structures by examining those of other mammals, to compare struc- tures among different kinds of organ- isms, or to examine physiology (e.g. heartbeat). But scientists themselves, particularly those working with inquiry approaches to teaching, includ- ing myself (Bernstein 1999) and others (e.g. Herzog 1996; Burghardt &amp; Herzog 1989), see dissection as more than sim- ply an anatomy lesson. Rather, it is yet another way to teach the process skills of science. It is an observing, questioning activity that allows stu- dents to "see" and inquire about inter- nal aspects of an organism, animal or otherwise, that would otherwise remain hidden and unknown. It is a way of "looking inside." Observation, followed by questioning and seeking answers; challenge, followed by dis- cussion, followed by further examina- tion, should be the natural progression for any science lesson, including dis- section. And students should be part of the discussion, not simply expected to dissect without preparation (Solot &amp; Arluke 1997). As a scientist, I also think that dis- section should not be done just once, with only one discussion, but should be part of ongoing discussion and preparation. It should be integrated with other topics, not just separated as a "rite of passage" to be performed once, say just with pigs or frogs, and without continuing discussion. Look- ing inside should be done often and with many different things, as is usu- ally the case with "looking out- side." I propose an inquiry-based activity designed to take the well-liked peanut activity and use it as a lead- in for discussion of the pros and cons of dissection and for learning the bene- fits of the procedure. The activity is intended for use primarily with middle school students (grades 6 through 9), since animal dissection is generally first encountered by those students in most school districts (although it is also being used successfully in both higher and lower grades; see "Impact" section below). Although I have not been able to test the approach directly with middle school students since I do not teach at that level, I have tried this exercise Penny L. Bernstein, Ph.D., is Assistant Professor in the Biology Department at Kent State University-Stark Campus, Canton, OH 44720. 374 THE AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER, VOLUME 62, NO. 5, MAY 2000</page><page sequence="2">with two groups of teachers who do teach at that level, and with college students, primarily freshmen taking my Introductory Biology course for majors. The teachers were taking courses with me in inquiry approaches to teaching biology: one group con- sisted of veteran middle school teach- ers who had already taken an inquiry course in physics (Akron Discovery) and the other consisted of teachers, grades 4 through 12, taking their first course in inquiry teaching of science (Project Discovery Cascade Program). The students in my biology majors class were about to begin dissection of the pig when I introduced this activity. Although most had per- formed dissections before, some had already expressed concerns about this requirement. Background: The Peanut Activity for Teaching Observation Skills The general idea of the peanut obser- vation activity is to give individuals or groups of students a roasted peanut and tell them that they are to observe the peanut well enough to "know" it as an individual. They are not allowed to mark it in any way, but can take notes, make drawings, etc. The teacher then gathers up all of the peanuts and places them in a container, and students must pick out their own pea- nut, based on their observations. Most students find "their individual" but there are usually a few who cannot find theirs or who argue about which peanut belongs to whom. A discussion of "observation" ensues: how could the observations be improved so that everyone would know their own pea- nut and be able to demonstrate it is "theirs"? What sort of "evidence" could be gathered? What things could be observed besides visual characteristics? The task of finding "your" peanut is then repeated (using the same or a different peanut). Usually all students find their own peanut at this point, having improved their observations to a point where there can be little confu- sion. Disputes can be settled by com- paring "notes." At this point, teachers often intro- duce a variety of other options to further explore the skills involved in making observations and writing descriptions. For example, they may ask students to identify another stu- dent's peanut using that student's descriptive notes, or they may make a more extreme test of the students' observation skills by asking students to find their peanuts in a container that has "strange" peanuts in it, i.e. where there are more peanuts than originally introduced and students cannot simply wait for their peanut to "appear" as the last one. Some teachers then encourage students to decorate the peanut as an individual or group mascot and / or name the peanut, so that such identification might help students better "know" their peanut vs. others. The mascot modification is often used as a team- building activity for groups to aid in achieving cooperative learning goals. Addition Step 1: The Peanut Activity as an Introduction to Pros &amp; Cons of Dissection After the exercise on observation skills, teachers usually move on, leav- ing the peanuts behind and finishing the lesson by letting the students eat the peanuts or keep them as mascots. The peanuts have become merely an object for teaching a skill. They often are not considered for what they are (seeds), are not opened and examined, are not compared with unroasted, raw, natural peanuts (although some teach- ers are beginning to do this). They become simply a snack or a mascot. This could, instead, be an ideal situa- tion in which to introduce concepts about dissection. Here are students who have carefully observed their pea- nut, learned to recognize it, and have been encouraged to work hard at the task of identifying "their" individual, with evidence to back up their decision (often with elaborate drawings and writings). If asked to keep them as mascots, students may have even named their peanuts or decorated them, as the teachers in the Cascade course were asked to do. In short, students are in a situation where they have been able to identify with their peanut; they know it as an individual, with particular characteristics, and sometimes even human attributes (names, decorations). They can pick it out of a crowd of strangers. If asked now to "do something" to the peanut, students may find it a difficult task (e.g. Shapiro 1991; Solot &amp; Arluke 1997). The next step then, as soon as stu- dents have finished with their final observations, or after they have kept the peanuts as mascots for a week, is for the teacher to direct the students to eat their peanuts (or simply open them; either approach should work). Many, if not all, would most likely do so without hesitation. Some might give questioning looks, but then go ahead and eat. Some might ask whether they have to, and some might hesitate or outright refuse. The veteran middle school teachers, who had done the simplest version of the observation activity, all ate theirs without hesita- tion. Many of the second group of teachers (Cascade Program), who had made the peanuts into mascots and had elaborately decorated them, sim- ply laughed and did not even attempt to open them. The college students, who had done a moderately advanced version of the activity (finding their own peanut and then the peanut of another student), were somewhere in between: some readily ate the peanut, while others refused. At this point, the teacher leads a discussion about the pros and cons of eating (or opening) the peanuts, asking when (under - what circumstances) it would be all right to eat (or open) the peanut vs. when it would not be, and making a list on the board of the replies, pro and con. Whether all of the students ate the peanuts without any obvious hesitation or whether there was conflict, discussion will reveal mixed feelings about eating them. For example, even the veteran teachers (above), who had not shown any obvious hesitation, gave many rea- sons as to when it might not be good to eat or open the peanuts. The comments made by the teachers and the college students in my classes were similar to ones students make when confronted with animal dissec- tion for the first time (e.g. Solot &amp; Arluke 1997). On one hand, some saw the peanuts as objects; as food (this one, clearly, is not usually a comment heard about most organisms com- monly used for dissection); dead things; without "soul;" a plant (unfeel- ing); not well known; and not an ani- mal, such as a dog, cat or frog. Many of the comments implied that the pea- nuts were nonliving or simply not important. On the other hand, some of the teachers and students saw the peanuts as known individuals, reflections of themselves, things they had grown to identify with, pets, things they had worked hard on and wanted to save, things that were once alive and should therefore be treated with respect in death. Their comments reflected vari- ous fears they had or thought their students would have, such as concerns that if a student were allowed to do this to the peanut, then somehow someone could do it to back to the student (hurt them, see them as an DISSECTION AS INQUIRY 375</page><page sequence="3">object, treat them without respect, etc, fears well summarized in Shapiro 1991). The hierarchy of dissection, that is, that some organisms seem more acceptable to dissect than others (e.g. plants more than animals; insects more than amphibians; amphibians more than mammals; small, cold-blooded things more than furry warm-blooded mammals; see Collins 1976; Herzog &amp; Galvin 1997; Bekoff 1992) also came out in the discussions. It could be brought out by the classroom teacher if not made explicit by student comments. In this exercise, then, the teachers and college students were able to explore their feelings about dissection without having the extra problems that occur when a familiar animal is the subject under discussion. Few identi- fied with peanuts naturally, but under these conditions, they were able to explore the difficulties of dissection that come with greater identification with the organism to be used. The participants became active agents in making decisions about dissection, based on discussion and thought; they were not simply handed an organism and encouraged to participate for a grade (Solot &amp; Arluke 1997). Addition Step 2: Using the Peanut To See the Benefits of Looking Inside The students are now ready to dis- sect a peanut. They may be asked, as a class, if they would like to look inside the peanut, and what procedure they would like to follow (using one demonstration peanut or one peanut per person, etc.). In my case, the vet- eran teachers and the students opted for individual peanuts; the teachers with mascots chose new "plain" pea- nuts to work with (and saved their mascots). If the decision is to go ahead, stu- dents are instructed to open their origi- nal peanut or the new (strange) one, and are given some simple guiding questions. What is the outside? What do you see inside? What are the thin brown outer covers? What are the large insides that we eat? Why do they come apart? What is inside of them? A brief discussion of plant life naturally ensues, including terms such as seeds, cotyledons, the parts of embryonic plants, germination, etc. Students may not have ever looked carefully inside the "meat" of a peanut and certainly few have ever realized they were eating an embryonic plant. Even many of the teachers were amazed! Questions come up, raised naturally by the students: Why are the thin brown coverings there? Why is the outside shell dimpled? Why are there usually two seeds per shell? Can there be fewer or more? What is a dicot? And if the peanut is a dicot, then what does a monocotyledenous seed look like? What would the peanut look like if it had not been roasted? This natu- rally leads to further studies of plants, and indeed, some teachers have used peanuts to lead into plant studies. What I am proposing, however, is not to simply use peanuts as a lead-in for discussion of plants, but rather to use them further, as a model for discussion of dissection, and the very positive results of dissection. Impact of Activity on My Students &amp; on the Teachers &amp; Their Students For the introductory biology stu- dents, the modified peanut observation activity resulted in quite a bit of dis- cussion, with all students choosing to participate in the animal dissection that followed (rather than watching a demonstration or working in large groups). These students took more time and care with the dissection than I have seen in five years of teaching this course at this school. They also showed more interest, asking many questions. Although I cannot say with certainty that the peanut activity was the causative factor, the behavior was suggestive, as were student comments. The following comments, by one student, were typical. When asked whether the peanut activity had affected his pig dissection, the student commented that it made him want to take more care, so he could look carefully inside to see what was there, as he had with the peanut. He felt, too, that he should treat the animal with care and respect, the activity having made him more aware of the fact that the pig had indeed once been alive. These students also showed a great deal of care in their dissection of flowers later in the course. Both groups of teachers seemed quite surprised at the underlying notion involved in this activity; that is, that dissection is not simply an anatomy lesson, but rather can be applied as a look inside to a number of things in a number of ways. At least one tried it immediately in class with good results; that is, it generated a good deal of discussion and interest, and was then used to launch the class into a unit on plants. (Cascade teacher, personal communication). Several more of the teachers have since tried the activity with their classes or expect to try it in the near future. These include several fourth- and fifth-grade teachers who felt the activity was important, even though their students do not normally then engage in animal dissection. For exam- ple, two teachers tried it this past academic year (1998-99), and both liked the results and intend to continue to use it. One, a fourth-grade teacher, used it in conjunction with a unit on the Civil War, where peanuts came up as a subject for further research. The observation part of the peanut activity encouraged the students to really examine the organism. The ensu- ing discussion about whether to open the peanuts resulted in quite a bit of exchange, and, the teacher felt, was a very positive experience. For example, some of the students in that class had participated in a special summer biol- ogy camp and had dissected animals. They were able to share their experi- ences with the rest of the class in a very meaningful way, serving as "experts" who had already looked inside and could provide insights about the activity. This provided the others with information, but it also provided the expert students with an opportunity to see that the knowledge they had gained from dissection could be important in other contexts; it was more than a simple anatomy lesson or a "rite of passage." The teacher finished the exercise by asking the students to predict what they might find inside the peanuts, and then had them look inside and discuss their findings. They then continued on to research information about peanuts and how they related to the Civil War. The second teacher used the activity in her seventh-grade classes as an introduction to plant studies. She felt that it gave students an interesting, hands-on lead-in, and that it encour- aged them to pay attention and seri- ously think about and examine some- thing they thought they already knew well. She then re-visited the idea of looking inside to discover new things when they examined flowers later in the year. Another teacher, who had pre- viously made the decision to no longer use dissection in his eighth through twelfth-grade classes because he had questions about the scientific value of the exercise vs. the moral aspects, decided that he should let the students participate in the discussion and deci- sion. He expects to try the peanut 376 THE AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER, VOLUME 62, NO. 5, MAY 2000</page><page sequence="4">procedure in the coming academic year-1999-2000 (Cascade teacher, personal communication). Another teacher hopes to utilize the activity in the coming year when she combines her third/fourth-grade "special needs" class with the regular fourth-grade sci- ence class. She feels that it will allow both sets of students, even at these younger ages, to explore the issues, and learn more about looking inside. Another is hoping to use it in her fifth-grade class in conjunction with a worm dissection demonstration. She sees the peanut activity as a new way to lead into the worm activity, to pro- vide more context for it, and to allow the students to participate more fully in it by allowing them to first discuss the pros and cons (Cascade teachers, personal communication). Summary: A Progression As a scientist and teacher, I feel that the following steps should be the natural progression for any science activity, including dissection: * Observation * Questioning and finding answers * Challenge * Discussion * Further examination. Dissection, as looking inside, should not be performed just once, with only one discussion, but should be part of ongoing discussion and preparation. It should be integrated into the study of other topics. Beginning this progression and prep- aration with peanuts gives students a chance to discuss the pros and cons of dissection and see the benefits of look- ing inside in a less-threatening situa- tion, i.e. using a plant part, which is harder for the students to identify with than an animal (Shapiro 1991). Indeed, it may help to go from observation and dissection of peanuts to flowers and then to animals. This exercise brings dissection into the inquiry approach, highlighting sci- ence process and making it easier to relate dissection to other aspects of sci- ence exploration. It can prepare stu- dents to decide whether to dissect organ- isms; why they should do so; and, if they decide to do so, how (e.g. one dem- onstration for the entire class vs. one for every four students vs. one per stu- dent). It brings students into the process and enables them to view dissection as one more way to ask questions and gather answers, that is, to "do science." Acknowledgments T'his paper was inspired in part by Dorian Solot's presentation of her research, examining the attitudes of sixth graders toward dissection, at the annual meeting of the International Society for Anthrozoology, Boston, Massachusetts, 1997. Her thoughtful comments and help with earlier drafts of the manuscript were invaluable. I would also like to thank C. Silverstein for his "balloon activity," and its strong impact on me; H. Herzog and K. Shapiro for sharing their views, references, and information with me; the Discovery and Cascade teachers; and my Introductory Biology students for being willing test subjects.
