<plain_text><page sequence="1">Shi" Nyi: Merit Days among the Lahu Nyi (Red Lahu), North Thailand Anthony R. Walker Dedicated to the memory of my friend, Chester F. Gorman, "archaeologist and teacher of anthropology whose excavations in northern Thailand unearthed evidence of the world's earliest agricultural and Bronze Age society ... casting doubt on the theory that the Middle East was a 'cradle of civilization"' (Time Ma- gazine, 22 June 1981). Abstract. - The Lahu Nyi, a Tibeto-Burman-speaking people of the northern Thai uplands, follow the lunar calendar, dividing each month into the period of the waxing moon and that of the waning moon. The days of the new and full moon, which begin these periods, are called shi~ nyi "merit days." A merit day is essentially an occasion when the villagers make a special effort to restore good relations with the supernatural world by accumulating merit and ridding them- selves of demerit. At the same time they reaffirm their communal identity through the ritual mixing of water and of rice from every household and by dancing together in the village temple. Prayers which accompany offerings to the spirit guardians of each household and of the village and, most importantly, to G'ui^sha, their supreme supernatural being, repeatedly request that on shi~nyi "all the people within the four corners of the village," "the big and the small," "every household," and "every person" together receive the blessings of the supernatural world. Many of the ideas underlying the Lahu celebration of merit days can be traced to their lowland Buddhist neighbours, the Τ ai. Nonetheless, both practice and supporting ideology constitute a distinctively Lahu adaptation outside the pale of orthodox Theravada Buddhism. Anthony R. Walker, B. A. (Osmania University, India), M.

Walker Anthropos 76. 1981 Introduction In previous contributions to this journal (Walker 1976α, 1978α, 1979α) I have presented data on Lahu Nyi (Red Lahu) ritual and recorded the texts of prayers used on the occasions discussed. This paper is a continuation of past work, taking up a particularly important ritual event in the life of the Lahu Nyi villagers I studied in the hills of north Thailand x. Shi~ nyi are the Lahu "days of merit" (shi~ from aw„ shi" ', the second part of the couplet aw„ bon aw „ shi~ "merit, blessing"; nyi means "day") 2. As readers of my previous articles may recall, the Lahu Nyi are the southernmost division of a people, the Lahu 3, whose population centre lies in China's Yunnan province. The ethnolinguistic group as a whole may now number in excess of 300 000 people, of whom perhaps 200 000 live in Chinese territory and the remainder in three Southeast Asian states : Burma (perhaps 80 000), Laos (maybe 2 000 to 3 000), and Thailand (over 31 000) 4. Lahu Nyi are located only in the most southerly areas of Lahu settlement, east of the river Hsin in Burma and concentrated in the two Burmese subdistricts of Muang Hsat and Muang Ton, whence they stretch eastwards across the Thai border into the provinces of Mae Hong Son, Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, Tak, and Kamphaeng Phet {cf. Khankeaw and Lewis 1979: 49). I have no figures for the total Lahu Nyi population, but just in Thailand they number over 17 000 out of the total Lahu population of more than 31 000. Thus, something like 55 percent of all of Thailand's Lahu belong to the Lahu Nyi division 5. Traditionally slash-and-burn hill farmers {cf. Walker 1976A), Lahu tend to live in rather small, autonomous village communities. In Thailand, at least, the average Lahu village comprises 20 houses and 116 inhabitants (Khankeaw and Lewis 1979 : 49). But village sizes vary considerably, ranging from hamlets of no more than five or six houses sheltering 30 or so people to settlements of over 100 houses and more than 600 people {cf. Khankeaw and Lewis 1979: 22). 1 The present contribution owes much, as do all previous ones, to the editorial and artistic assistance of my wife, Pauline Hetland Walker, to whom grateful thanks. 2 Detailed notes on the orthography of Lahu may be found in my earlier contri- butions to Anthropos (cf. Walker 1976a: 387 n. 12; 1978a: 720 n. 2). A note and diagram- matical representation of the place of Lahu within the Tibeto-Burman language family appears in Walker (1979a: 697 n. 2). Nyi "day" differs in tone from nyi" "red"; common usage omits tone marks from "LcC Hu_ Nyi'." 3 For detailed discussions of the cultural divisions of the Lahu people, see Bradley (1975) and Walker (1974a7). For ethnographic data on the Lahu people as a whole, see Jones (1967), Telford (1937), and Walker (1969, 19706, 1975a, b, c. a' and 1981 c). 4 For the basis of my estimates of the Lahu populations of China, Burma, and Laos, see Walker (1979a: 698 n. 3). I am now in a position to revise the figure of Thailand up- ward from 22 000 Lahu scattered through 179 villages (as per TRC [1977] : 2) to 31 000 in 269 villages. The basis for the revised figure is a recent (1979) count taken by the Tribal Integrated Health Project, a non-governmental programme funded by Family Planning International Assistance (cf. Khankeaw and Lewis 1979). 5 I am grateful to the Rev. Dr. Paul Lewis for this information. It is based on the aforementioned Tribal Integrated Health Project count, and on Dr. Lewis' thorough knowledge of the divisional affiliations of Lahu communities in Thailand.</page><page sequence="3">Merit Days among the Lahu Nyi, North Thailand 667 I «v _ .y'/^î ypv 101# -20· BURMA I J^rf* Ch7^^Vv LAOS Mae nong aon ι ·. ι ' rhrao Jy *·.. y^ v^ * " / { ' ' ff y^jX ^ J ) V.

Walker Anthropos 76. 1981 1. The Ideological Background Unless they have adopted an alien ideology like the Theravada Buddhism of their Tai-speaking neighbours 6, the Christianity of western missionaries (mostly Baptist but some Roman Catholic) or the Marxist atheism of their Han compatriots in Yunnan, Lahu are commonly - and inadequately - designated "animists." Certainly Lahu believe in the existence of spirits, but so do their Buddhist lowland neighbours, the Tai peoples. Then again, although few Lahu have embraced Theravada Buddhism as a comprehensive ideology, most (if not all) Lahu communities have been influenced in some way, ideological or prac- tical, by Buddhism. The observance of shi~ nyi or merit days among the Lahu Nyi is, as I shall remark again, almost certainly a Buddhist-derived custom. And much of the symbolism of the shi~ nyi rituals is fully comprehensible only against the Buddhist background with which, because of their association with the Tai lowlanders, Lahu hillmen have been familiar for centuries. Indigenous Lahu Nyi ideas about the supernatural realm include a belief in the existence of a great number of spirits, generically termed ne '. Many of these are associated with natural phenomena such as hills, streams, sun, lightning, and rainbow (cf. Walker 1977Ö: 63, 1976g: 437f., 1976c: 167 f., 1977c: 212 f., 1977rf: 227 ff.). Lahu do not conceive of such powers as invariably malicious but, because they are certain that nature spirits sometimes do attack people, they will propitiate them either to prevent or to remove trouble (cf. Walker 1978a for examples of prophylactic rites, Walker 1979a: 706-715 for remedial ones) . Then there are spirits whose function is to guard the villagers, their livestock and possessions. Most important of these are the yeh^ ne* or "house spirit" (cf. Walker 1977^) and GWw fu_, sometimes also called ne* Ion' or "the great (lonT) spirit/' who is said to protect the village community 7. The 6 I use the form "Tai" (sometimes also T'ai in the literature) to refer to any group speaking a Tai (or Daic) language; "Thai" I use to refer either to a citizen of the modern kingdom of Thailand, or, adjectivally, to something belonging to that kingdom, e. g., the northern Thai hills, the Northern Thai people. 7 G'ui fu is, apparently, a fairly recent transformation in Lahu thought of the resident hk'aw ne" or hill spirit. Thus I have the following report from a trusted informant: G'ui^ fu_ hk'aw ne" yo^. Nyi" chi hk'aw^ G'ui^ fu_ is the hill spirit. Twenty years aw g'u" suh_ hta" k'o, G'ui^ fu_ hta^ ago, we made an altar for G'ui^ fu_ in the hk'aT u hehT pui" hk'aw ba la 'a-eh_ te ve forest at the top of the village. It was yo^.

Walker 1974^: beu^ haw' yeh^ hk'aw te veyo^. 703] who took [the altar] and brought it into the haw' yeh^' so that is the reason why we make [G'ui^ fu_ 's altar] inside the haw' yeh^. The connexion between the hill spirit and the village guardian is worth noting. Lahu Nyi conceive each hillside to be the residence of a spirit. Such spirits go by the generic term hk'aw ne" (hk' aw "hill," ne" "spirits") and have no specifically "guardian" charac- teristics. But when the vegetation on a hillside is cut down, either for agricultural use (cf.</page><page sequence="5">Merit Days among the Lahu Nyi, North Thailand 669 latter is regarded as a supernatural intermediary between the villagers and G'ui^ sha 8, their supreme and creating divinity. Both GWv fu_ and the y eh ^ ne" figure prominently in the shi~ nyi rituals because even guardian spirits are not fully trustworthy. Without suitable propitiation, Lahu believe, they may well withdraw their protection and so bring harm upon those whom they are sup- posed to defend. Other spirits in the Lahu cosmos include those of the ances- tors who have passed peacefully into the land of the dead and those of people who, having suffered a "bad (unnatural, bloody) death/' are consequently doomed to wander and cause trouble among the living. Both kinds of ancestral spirit require propitiation and, in the case of the latter, exorcism (cf. Walker 1972&amp;, 1976a), but they do not figure in the regular shi" nyi rites. Besides the spirits or né* , the Lahu Nyi (in common with all Lahu tradi- tionalists of whatever division) believe in a supreme and creating divinity, the aforementioned G'ui^ sha. Among the Lahu Nyi I studied, G'ui^ sha is concei- ved both as an anthropomorphic deity, appropriately addressed in prayer as a pa G'ui^ sha "Father GWv sha," and as a diffused divinity incorporating several other deities of whom a female counterpart, Ai ma, is the most impor- tant. Mother Ai ma, according to one creation myth, was responsible for pro- ducing the earth, while Father G'ui„ sha produced the heavenly regions 9. Although the original inspiration for the observance of shi~ nyi was, as I shall argue below, almost certainly Buddhist, Lahu Nyi have reinterpreted these ritual occasions as essentially days for honouring Gwv sha and for remember- ing the creation of the world by Ai ma (see Text 1C, verses 1 and 5). Walker 1978a: 718-732) or to build a village, the resident hill spirit receives special propi- tiation, after which it becomes, quite specifically, the guardian spirit of the field or of the settlement. - Note the similarity between this Lahu conception and that of their imme- diate lowland neighbours, the Khon Muang or Northern Thai people, of whom Turton (1972: 245) writes, "... when forest is cut down, say to make space for domestic use or cultivation, non-specific forest spirits become single specific locality spirits (cao Hi)." 8 The etymology of the word G'ui^ sha is obscure [cf. Walker 1976a: 379 n. 4 lor a breakdown of the component syllables). Lemoine's (1978: 850) tentative attempt to link the Lahu word with Sakiyamuni ("the sage of the Sakiya," i. e., the historical Buddha) is, to my mind, fanciful. 9 I recorded the following prose account ot the creation oi neaven ana eartn: A shoe htcf , G'ui sha aw^ pa_ aw^ mi" A long time ago, G'ui^ sha, husband and ma mi g'ui^ mvuk* naw hta^ hpan_ ve wife [i. e., Father G'ui^ sha and Mother yo .

This is the reason why narrow streams and wide valleys arose on the earth. Words appearing in brackets in the English translation are understood, but not stated, in the Lahu original. I follow this convention throughout this paper.</page><page sequence="6">670 Anthony R. Walker Anthropos 76. 1981 2. Ritual Officials The crucial ideological distinction which Lahu Nyi make between Gwiv sha and the spirits is reflected in the ritual organization of many of their villa- ges, where the offices of priest and spirit-specialist are quite different. Priests, of whom there are several grades, mediate between the people and GWv sha, particularly by leading public rituals in honour of the supreme divinity, as on shi" nyi. Most senior among the grades of priest (there is no Lahu Nyi word to cover all the grades) is the to bo pa_ (probably, to from aw„ to "body/" bo from aw„ bo "meritorious/' pa_, male suffix and so "meritorious male body"). The Lahu Nyi villagers say that their headman is responsible for chaw ya~ hpaw~ "the people's side/' but their to bo pa_ takes care of Gwiv sha hpaw* or "G'ui^ sha s side/' Indeed, the principal duty of the to bo pa_ is to lead the villagers in the worship of GWv sha at the village temple 10. He represents the villagers before Gmv sha, praying to the highest supernatural on their behalf and offer- ing their gifts to him. And the principal occasions when he performs this sacred duty are the shi~ nyi or merit days. The to bo pa_ is responsible for the upkeep of the village temple and has direct authority over all other grades of priest associated with "GWv sha s side." But he has no direct authority over the spirit-specialists and, when the need arises, must call upon their expertise just like any other villager. The lesser priests, assisting the to bo pa_, are of three types. First, being next in importance to the to bo pa_, is the sa_ la_ pa_ (etymology uncertain but probably from the Burmese hsaya "expert"). His concern is particularly with sickness. A villager who falls ill may bring certain ritual objects (see p. 695) to the sa_ la_ pa_, who takes them to the temple and prays to GWv sha for the recovery of the sick person. After the sa_ la_ pa_, in order of ritual precedence, comes the la shaw pa_ (etymology unknown) whose major task is to drive away evil and sickness from the village. Finally, there is the a ca pa_, the "searcher" (from ca ve "to look, to search out"), whose job is to seek blessings from GWv sha for the villagers. Thus, if any villager wishes a particular boon he may go to the a ca pa_ with ritual offerings. The priest will place these in the temple on the following shi' nyi and pray to Gmv sha that the donor's wishes be fulfilled. 10 Two replies to the question "What is the meaning of the to bo pajs work ?/' were as follows: (a) To bo k'o" ve tcuh~ kui^ leh haw" yeh^ We can say the meaning of to bo pa_ is the hta^ nyi ha^ sha sheh_ hpa* k'o~ ve yo^ leh person who looks after the haw" yeh^ and peh* haw_ hkan_ tu~ sheh_ hpd* k'o" veyo^. the person whose work it is to burn the beeswax candles. (b) To bo k'o~ ve tcuh~ kui^ leh aw^ bon We can say that the meaning of to bo pa_ aw^ shi" paw^ ca sheh_ hpaT hta^ k'o~ ve is the person who searches for merit (or y°„* è'a ca~ 8a daw^ tu^ ve aw^ bon aw^ blessing), the person who begs and takes shi~ G'ui^ sha geh law yu^ leh chaw yd' from G'ui^ sha the blessing of enough to hta^ k'aw^ ca ho_ pi~ sheh_ hpaT hta^ k'o~ eat and enough to drink and gives [that ve yo^. blessing] to the people.</page><page sequence="7">Merit Days among the Lahu Nyi, North Thailand 671 The wives of all these specialists are known by the same titles as their husbands but with the female suffix ma replacing the male pa_. The villagers state explicitly that husband and wife together perform the ritual duties associated with their office. On shi~ nyi or merit days, as we shall later observe, the la shaw_ ma has a particularly important role to play. The office of priest, of whatever grade, is invariably held in higher esteem than that of spirit-specialist or ne* te sheh_ hpa~ (ne~ "spirits," te "to do, to be concerned with/' sheh_ hpa" "master, expert"). Frequently these spirit- specialists are addicted to opium ; Lahu say none but an opium addict would make a regular occurrence of dealings with the ne~. But though the spirit- specialist is held in lower esteem than a priest, his expertise is something Lahu Nyi communities cannot do without. 3. The Village Temple: Principal Locus of the S hi' Nyi Rites The ritual centre of many Lahu Nyi villages is a building called the haw' yeh^ or "palace house" (haw~ , a Shan prince's palace; yeh„ "house" in Lahu). Invariably located at the higher end of the village and frequently set apart from the ordinary dwellings n, this building may be raised on piles like ordi- nary Lahu houses or built directly on the ground. The advantage of the latter design is that it can more readily withstand the vigorous dance sessions which frequently take place inside it on merit days. The village temple is, above all else, dedicated to the worship of GWv sha. But in it there is also a small altar honouring the guardian protector of the whole village, GWv fu_. In my study village in north Thailand (pl. la) the haw' yeh^ was a little smaller than the ordinary dwelling houses and was built on the ground rather than on piles 12. Sited at the top of the village, the building was surrounded by a stout wooden fence which formed, at the front of the temple, an open yard (pl. 16). Around the building were a number of tall bamboos with a strip of white or yellow cloth on top. Such flags are called htoT pa_ (a loan from Shan) and most informants maintained that they were earthly replicas of the flags which surround the haw' yeh^ of G'ui„ sha in heaven. Here we may note that these Lahu conceive everything that exists on earth to be but a replica of a divine prototype in heaven. Thus in the heavens there is a divine haw' yeh^ tended by a divine to bo pa_, divine sa_ la_ pa_} divine la shaw_ pa_, and divine a ca pa_ 13. The symbolism of white or yellow cloth is not difficult to elicit; 11 I have been to one Lahu Nyi village where the haw' yeh^ was simply an exten- sion of the to bo pa 's house and could be entered only through the priest's living room. But this situation, I was told, was only temporary, as a separate haw' yeh^ was planned. 12 The village in which I resided no longer exists, the villagers having scattered and joined several other communities. This is the reason for the use of the past tense in my description of the haw' yeh^ and its contents. 13 In this connexion, I recorded the following words of an old and very reliable informant :</page><page sequence="8">672 Anthony R.

Both colours are contrasted with red, which is associated with the spirits (perhaps because the more malicious of these bring bloody death to their victims). Some villagers say that these sacred flags, representing the all-good, all-powerful G'ui^ sha, frighten evil spirits away from the village ; others say that the cloth strips, fluttering in the breeze, cry out (bvuh^ ve) for the health and prosperity of the villagers. The use of such flags almost certainly derives from the similar Shan and Northern Thai practice of erecting flags around Buddhist temple buildings. These flags, com- monly called tung chai or "victory flags" in Thailand, are set up, according to Thai folklorist Rajadhon (1967 : 179), "to avert ill or evil spirits and secure good fortune/' This corresponds exactly to the Lahu conception of their hto^ pa_. F Fig. 1 : Kaw mo' taweh_, sacred posts outside the village temple In the front courtyard of the temple in my study village were a number of roughly carved posts known as kaw mcT taweh_ (ety- mology obscure). These posts usually had a series of circular incisions around their tops (fig. 1). According to the headman of this village there should be three such incisions, each representing a different wish: freedom from sickness, success in agriculture and prosperity of the livestock. But no other informant proffered such an explanation, and the posts often had more than three cuts. As with the temple flags, villagers' opinions var- ied as to what these posts signify. A common view was that they were earthly replicas of GWv sha' s divine kaw mcT taweh_ in heaven, said to be of white stone representing inde- structible, undecaying permanence. Thus, when the villagers erect a similar post, desir- ing long and indestructible life, they strip off the bark so that the white wood will resemble G'wv sha' s white stone post (see Text 2B verse 6). Another explanation is that the posts are MvutT naw hk'o~ , G'ui^ ma a dauT , G'ui^ In heaven there is a divine headman, divine ma ca If , to bo, a ca, sa_ la_, la shaw_ pa_, blacksmith, a to bo, a ca, sa_ la_, la shaw_ la shaw_ ma caw^ ve yo^.

It is especially potent as a protection against evil supernaturais: witches, spirits, demons, and so on - for few of them would have the audacity to harm a 'Son of the Buddha'/' I understand that similar beliefs are found among the Tai peoples, whence they have come, in part at least, to the Lahu.</page><page sequence="12">674 Anthony R. Walker Anthropos 76. 1981 offerings to Gtóv sha which he will receive when he comes down to earth. At that time, so this version goes, all objects in the world will be able to talk. The trees are likely to speak ill of the Lahu, who cut them down to prepare their fields, but if the villagers offer these posts to GWv sha, they can forestall the trees' complaints by claiming that they only cut them to make offerings to GWv sha. Other informants said that the posts were given so that, if a living man's aw^ ha, his spiritual essence or "soul/' left his body and began wandering towards the land of the dead, GWv sha would block its way with a kaw moi" taweh_, forcing it to return to the body of its owner. If the aw„ ha were allowed to reach the land of the dead, its owner would die. As with the htoT pa_ or temple flags, I have little doubt that the origin of the kaw moT taweh_ posts is to be found in the practices of the Tai peoples. Possibly for the prototype of the Lahu kaw moi" taweh_ we should look to the Tai lak muang or city posts. Terwiel has described these as, among other things, "erected in the name of the highest political authority " (1978: 159), "usually made of a hardwood" and with "the top ... carved and ... end[ing] in a rounded or pointed tip" (160). Despite their shape, he denies (168 ff.) that the Tai lak muang represent phalluses. I believe his argument holds good also for the Lahu Nyi kaw mo^ taweh_, for although a phallic symbolism seems to be attributed to these posts by the Lahu Sheh Leh (a neighbouring division in Thailand), 15 the Lahu Nyi themselves reject it. Like Terwiel I submit that we should not blithely assume a phallic symbolism which the people themsel- ves deny. Prudery is not an issue ; these people have little reticence regarding body parts. But inasmuch as Lahu regard G'ui^ sha as the highest supernatural entity and designate his place of worship a "palace house," it makes good sense to see the kaw mo" taweh_, rather like the Tai lak muang, as symbols of the highest authority. In the Lahu case, the authority is heavenly rather than political, and the symbols of G'ui^ sha's authority are placed in front of the earthly representation of his heavenly abode. The temple itself was entered through the single door which opened onto the front courtyard. It comprised only one room (figs. 2 and 3), containing a 15 This Sheh Leh interpretation of the kaw mcT taweh_ I deduce from a portion of the myth concerning the origin of the different characteristics and capabilities of Chinese, Shan, Lahu Nyi, and Lahu Sheh Leh recorded from Sheh Leh informants by Delmos J. Jones (1967: 87 f.): "The Red Lahu went to see god one day before going to the fields. There he bowed down and asked for nothing, but god gave him literature written on papers. The Red Lahu put the papers in his old basket and forgot about them. Because his old basket had holes in it, the papers dropped through the gap and were lost. When he got home, the villagers crowded around him and scolded him for being so stupid. So he went to see god for the second time. This time god was angry at him for losing the scripts that he had given him. The Red Lahu bowed down before god and said that he wanted a lot of know- ledge. Already angry, god at once took out his penis and urinated before him. He went home and told the people what had happened. So from that day the Red Lahus have cut of wood an object that looks like the penis of god and danced around it when offering things as a memorial to god."</page><page sequence="13">Merit Days among the Lahu Nyi, North Thailand 675 Fig. 2 Floorplan of temple interior 1. door 2. dancing place 3.

In the far right corner of the room, also on the rear platform, was an altar identical to the house spirit altars (cf. Walker 1977^) found in every dwelling house: a small wooden shelf atop a single long pole (fig. 4). This altar was for GWv fu_, the spirit protector of the village. On the altar were two small porcelain bowls of Chinese design which held, respectively, offerings of rice and of water placed in them by the to bo pa_ on merit days. Also on the shelf was a woven bamboo basket (fig. 5a) called a hpeu^ k'o_y another offering to the spirit. Fig. 4 Detail of the altar to G'ui^ fu_ inside the temple a) beeswax candles on iron stand b) porcelain cups for rice and water 16 The lighting of beeswax candles precedes many Lahu ritual observances. Indeed, so important is the use of these candles to the Lahu that they habitually label themselves peh" tu" pa_ or "beeswax burners " (peh" from peh" haw_ "beeswax/' tu from tu ve "to light/' pa , the male suffix). The reason for the use of such candles varies from informant to informant and according to the rite in question. But there seems to be agreement that candles "please" benevolent supernatural beings, especially G'ui^ sha, who may then listen to one's prayers. Thus one informant said: G'ui sha hta^ ca ve k'o, peh" g a tu ve yo^. If one looks to G'ui^ sha [for a boon] one Ma"' tu k'o, G'ui^ sha ma ha^ la" . should light beeswax candles. If one does not light beeswax candles, G'ui^ sha will not receive [one's prayers and offerings]. At the same time, there appears to be a belief that lighted beeswax candles strike fear into malicious spirits. Thus the following comment: Ne* hpaw" hta ca ve k'o, peh" ma" tu~ ve If one looks to the spirits' side, one does not yo . Tu~ k'o, ne" yaw" kaui ve yo. Yaw" light beeswax candles. If one lights them, ma" ha la". the spirits are afraid, and will not accept [one's prayers and offerings]. Generally, then, when Lahu Nyi ritual specialists make offerings to G'ui^ sha or other benevolent supernaturais they light beeswax candles. When they seek boons from the spirits they do not light such candles. But when they wish to exorcise malicious spirits, they use lighted candles to help frighten the spirits away.</page><page sequence="15">Merit Days among the Lahu Nyi, North Thailand 677 Other permanent ritual furnishings were long strips of white and yellow cloth, hung from the roof beams together with a number of cloth umbrellas (pl. 2d, fig. 3). The flags bear the same name, htcT pa_y as those outside the temple, but here, so I was told, they were simply offerings to G'ui^ sha. The umbrellas, hpa^ mï* bo (hpa^ "cloth/" etymology of nti* bo obscure), were also said to be offerings to GWv sha. But as the umbrella is a symbol of royalty among the Tai peoples (an emblem derived ultimately from the ancient Hindu kings of Southeast Asia), the hpa^ mï* bo in the Lahu haw' yeh^ are almost certainly copied from Tai prototypes and, like the kaw tno" taweh_, symbolize Gmv sha's royalty. But this was not an explanation offered by Lahu villagers themselves. To the left of the throne was a small wooden trough, baw_ ti^ kehT (etymology unknown), containing water, from which a rudely carved bird, co ngeh" "life bird/' was drinking (fig. 3). Those few informants who could offer any explanation (beyond awv IÏ* "custom") for the "life bird" said only that G'ui^ sha owns such a bird which "cries out" (bvuh„ ve) for the long life of the villagers. Kept in the temple, but with no particular place reserved for them, were the percussion instruments used to accompany the ritual dancing. These included drum (ca^ k'o_), gong (bo lo k'o_), and cymbals (cheh heh~), all purchased from Northern Thai dealers in the lowlands. The gong is also used alone when a priest offers prayers in the temple. Directly to the right and left of the throne were various ritual objects, some of which were renewed on every merit day. Informants said that all the offerings at the right hand side of GWv sha's throne were given to obtain merit or blessing (aw„ bon) from the highest divinity, while those on the left were to cleanse the villagers from the accumulation of sins or demerit (vé~ ba~). Among the objects which did not need to be replaced so frequently were, at both right and left of the throne, large bundles of thin bamboo sticks with cotton wool on top. The bundle at the right was called sha put (probably derived from sha ve "to offer" and pui "a rounded object"), and that on the left was the keh_ pui (keh_ from keh_ ve "to purify, to cleanse"). Another permanent object to the left of the throne was a small bench, the keh_ teh or "purification bench," on which was placed a bamboo W kaw~ or "custom cup" (li~ from aw^ IÏ* "custom," kaw" "a cup"). Another small bamboo cup, G'ui^ fu_ ve IÏ* kaw" "G'ui^ fujs custom cup," was to be found beneath GWv fu_'s altar in the far right-hand corner of the room. These two cups were filled with water in a special ritual on merit days. On each merit day, various ritual objects were arranged on the throne itself. On the middle tier were placed three hpeu„ k'o_, offerings respectively from the headman, to bopa_ and sa_ la_ pa_. The hpeu^ k'o_ (fig. 5a), sometimes said to represent a bowl of flowers such as Buddhists offer at their temples, comprises a loosely-woven bamboo basket, some eleven centimetres high, to which are affixed slender sticks topped with cotton wool (the "flowers"). Also on the middle tier, behind the candle stand in the centre, were placed two bundles of bamboo sticks with cotton wool on top, called If tsuh^ (from aw„</page><page sequence="16">678 Anthony R. Walker Anthropos 76. 1981 W "custom" and tsuh^ ve "to bind together"). These bundles (fig. 5b) are similar to the sha pui and keh_ pui but much smaller, about ten centimetres in diameter instead of 30-40 cm. The to bo pa_ puts these offerings here to cleanse the sins (ve" ba~) of the villagers, but beyond this statement of their purpose nobody could explain the symbolism of the li" tsuh^. Once again, I suspect, there is probably a Tai prototype, but I am at present unaware of what it might be. Other ritual offerings, found always in the temple, were renewed each merit day. These included ha~ pui "stones," mi^ co: conical objects fashioned from red earth, and kaw mo" taweh_ of two designs : uncarved lengths of strip- ped wood as well as small replicas of the wooden posts outside the temple. 0 IlLUL *%iS sÉÍJ vKN ^y fcdp^ *%iS j. ll|nl|Jj|| ^^^^^ - ^^Z^ Fig. 5 Lahu Nyi (Red Lahu) ritual offerings a) hpeu^ k'o_ (height approx. 11 cm., diamètre approx. 8 cm.) b) IV tsuh^ (length approx. 30 cm.) c) hto" hi~ (length approx. 30 cm.) d) ku^ ti^ (height approx. 30 cm.)</page><page sequence="17">Merit Days among the Lahu Nyi, North Thailand 679 The sun-baked mud mi^ co (pl. 2e, fig. 3), literally "earth life/' symbolize the donor's desire that he and his household members may enjoy unending and undecaying life, like that of the earth from which the offerings are fashioned. The ha~ pui, ordinary stones, symbolize the desire for life as strong and endu- ring as stone. The wooden kaw mcT taweh_ are said to have exactly the same significance as the large posts outside the temple. In addition there were two kinds of objects fashioned from bamboo, known as hto" hi' and ku^ ti^ (figs. 5c and d). No informant was able to explain to me the symbolism of the htoT hi' {hto'* "flag/" hi' from aw^ hi' "custom"). The ku^ ti^ (etymology unknown) was said to represent a flower, like those offered by devotees at Buddhist tem- ples. A Buddhist prototype for the ku„ ti^ (as also for the hpeu^ k'o_ mentioned earlier) is thus mentioned by Lahu informants themselves. I would suspect a Buddhist origin for the htö" hi' , mi^ co and ha' pui as well, although possibly the connotations of the original objects were different than those of the Lahu offerings. In concluding this description of the village haw' yeh^, I should note that while access to the building was never forbidden and it was used on other occasions by ritual specialists, it became on merit days - and at these times only - the focus of the whole community's ritual observances. 4. The Shi~ Nyi ("Merit Day") Observances and Prayers The Lahu Nyi of north Thailand follow a lunar calendar, dividing each month into the period of the waxing moon, ha pa taw^ {ha pa "moon/" taw^ from taw„ ve "to manifest"), and the period of the waning moon, ha pa che~ (che~ from che~ ve "to break"). The day of the new moon and the day of the full moon, which begin these two periods, are days of socially-enforced rest and ritual celebration. A myth attributes the setting aside of these two days each month to Sha~ ca~, a great Lahu culture hero who is credited with having achieved access to G'ui^ sha's heaven without first having to die 17. A long time ago, it is 17 I recorded two versions of the ShaT caT legend. The first is as follows: A pa Sha~ ca~ co-e hta ', yaw" htaui G'ui^ During the lifetime of Father Sha~ ca~, sha té" to hk'e yo^.

The husband was a great hunter. If he said, "Today I will shoot male animals/' he succeeded. If he said he would bag female animals, so it was. For this reason the people of the village gave him the name Sha" ca" . [The conne- xion between the name Sha" ca" and the role of this man as a great hunter is unclear to me. The tone of sha_ "game" is not the same as the first syllable of Sha" ca".] One day Sha" ca" said to his wife and his children, "Don't go anywhere today, G'uiv sha will come to visit us"; like this he spoke. His wife said, "People cannot listen to your words. If I do not go out, the chillies will be very hot" [i. e., there will be chillies alone and no relish to eat with the rice], and so speaking she took the children and went out to fish. Her husband Sha" ca" stayed at home and G'ui^ sha arrived. G'ui^ sha said to him, "Let's go, let's be off to heaven!." Sha" ca" said, "My wife and my children haven't come back, I can't go"; thus he spoke. G'ui^ sha said, "You can go, don't worry, I will put this magic water in a cup. When they come back and drink it, your wife and children will also be able to reach heaven" ; thus he spoke. Sha" ca" believed and so, leaving the magic water, they went. Some time later Sha" ca" 's wife and chil- dren got home, but could not see husband Sha" ca" ; only the cup of water was to be seen. Sha" ca"'s wife was angry and, taking the cup of water, threw it out of the house. The cup hit a basket of chickens, broke and the water spilled out. The chickens drank the water and began to fly upwards to- wards heaven. However, since they could sip only a little of the water, they only reached the tree tops. Here they became the wild jungle fowl who ever after have lived in the forest. Sha" ca"'s wife thought to herself, "If we drink this water, we too may be able to reach heaven." So she dipped her finger into</page><page sequence="19">Merit Days among the Lahu Nyi, North Thailand 681 recalled, when Sha" ca" lived on earth, he called his people's attention to the fact that their farming and hunting activities caused the death of countless animals and insects. Sha" ca" proposed that the days of the new moon and full moon be observed as days of rest, on which the people would not work in their fields nor hunt but would make offerings to G'ui^ sha in order to cleanse themselves 18. It seems clear that the idea of sin or demerit [vè* ba~) being accumulated by the taking of life derives from the lowland Buddhist neigh- bours of the Lahu. The rites associated with a merit day begin on the eve of the actual day with three events : the ceremonial mixing of waters and handwashing by the women, the presentation of uncooked rice grains to the wife of the to bo pa_ or senior priest, and ritual dancing in the temple. The first of these is both elab- orate and important ; as it is twice repeated on shi" nyi itself, I shall describe it here in some detail. The la shaw_ ma} wife of the la shaw_ pa_ who is, as we have seen, third in the hierarchy of ritual officials associated with the temple, leads the rite of water exchange and handwashing which is known as i~ ka" If yu^ da^ ve (Γ ka" "water, " /Γ from aw^ IÏ* "custom/' yu„ da^ ve "to exchange").

They began to fly upwards towards heaven but [since they had only tasted a few drops of the magic water] they could only reach the tree tops. Thus they became gibbons and lived in the trees and had to look for wild fruit to eat. That's why today gibbons howl, because they find it uncomfortable to live in the trees. They cry, "Oh Sha~ ca" , come and call us back to you!" It is for this reason that now Lahu do not eat the flesh of gibbons. If they do shoot and eat [gibbons], it is bad, they say. If they do shoot a gibbon they must give four silver rupees to cleanse the sin. [In fact, I am pretty certain this rule is no longer followed] . A long time ago, in a Lahu village lived the great hunter, Sha~ ca" . Sha~ ca" said, "Shooting game and making fields we kill many insects, we kill many wild animals. To cleanse the sin twice a month, at the time of the waxing moon and at the time of the waning moon, observe a merit day and make offerings and give them to G'ui^ sha and perform the water custom to cleanse the sins." This is why we do these things. 44</page><page sequence="20">682 Anthony R. Walker Anthropos 76. 1981 at the temple. A female representative from each household comes with a container of water obtained from the village water supply (a bamboo aqueduct which funnels water from a nearby stream or spring right into the centre of the village). The containers traditionally are tubes of bamboo but these days aluminium kettles are also used. The la shaw_ ma places approximately six (the number is apparently unspecified 19) empty bamboo containers on the porch of the headman's house and pours a little water into each one from her own container. Next a woman from each household does likewise so that each bam- boo now contains water from every house. The la shaw_ ma takes one of these bamboos, goes inside the headman's house and pours some of the "mixed" water into a special cup called li~ kaw~ ("custom cup") and over other ritual para- phernalia which the headman keeps on his "offering bench." This bench, called IÏ* kaw" teh tu ve (teh tu ve "place for putting" the li" kaw~), is located against the back wall of his house, on the household head's side of the fireplace (fig. 6). 20 It is roughly made of wood and is no more than 30 cm. in length and 5 cm. high. Also placed on this bench may be offerings (already described) such as W tsuh^y mi^ co} kuv ti^ and hto" hi' which have been presented to the headman by villagers requesting him to purify them of their sins (pa" keh_ ve : pa" horn pa" ve "to order," keh_ ve "to cleanse" ; cf. Walker 19796). The offering bench and all the ritual objects placed on or by it are dedicated to the divine (prototype) village headman, G'ui^ ma a daw" (gui^ ma "divine, pertaining to G'ui^ sha" a daw" "the thinker" from daw" ve "to think"; hence "he who thinks [on behalf of the village community]"). After the "washing" of the ritual objects, the la shaw_ ma pours a little water over the hands of the headman.

But my own obser- vations contradict my informant's statement. 20 A Lahu Nyi house has a central floor beam, and the fireplace - a square of packed earth - is laid on the floor adjoining the beam, close to the back wall. The fireplace may be on either side of the "central floor beam," the opposite side becoming the household head's side.</page><page sequence="21">Merit Days among the Lahu Nyi, North Thailand 683 Coming out of the headman's house, the la shaw_ ma refills her vessel from one of those containing the "mixed" water. The second part of the rite is a reciprocal handwashing with the other women, in which she, as leader, uses water mixed from all the households while the other women pour from their own containers of water. First the youngest girl or woman present pours her water over the la shaw_ ma's hands; the la shaw_ ma reciprocates by pouring "mixed" water over the girl's hands. The rite is repeated between the la shaw_ ma and each woman in roughly ascending order of age (these Lahu do not keep precise account of age), culminating in the exchange of water between the la shaw_ ma and the headman's wife (a daw" ma). This exchange concluded, the women unceremoniously refill their containers from the village water source and proceed to the temple. Here each woman pours a little water at the base of every flagpole (hto" pa_) and sacred post (kaw mo" taweh_) outside the buil- ding and then on the ritual paraphernalia to either side of GWv sha's throne inside the building. This completed, the company reassembles outside the temple door where the la shaw_ ma has placed a row of empty bamboo con- tainers (pl. 2c) . There follows a mixing of waters and reciprocal handwashing just as at the headman's house, but this time with the rite culminating in an exchange between the la shaw^ ma and the to bo ma, wife of the senior priest. The basic symbolism of the water exchange rite is well known to the villagers, although the meaning of some of the details is obscure. Nobody seems able to say why it is only the women who perform this rite. Possibly it is becau- se they are the ones who collect the water every day from the communal water supply, but for the Lahu themselves chaw maw" awv li" : "it is the custom of the ancients," is reason enough {chaw maw" "elders, ancients, ancestors," aw„ li" "custom"). Water is a cleansing agent used to purify the man-made ritual objects and make them acceptable to the supernatural beings to whom they are offered. The mixing of water from all the households is said to symbolize the unity of the village community. The washing of hands cleanses the parti- cipants (and, presumably through them, their household members) of their sins, bringing them thereby into a correct ritual state in which to celebrate a merit day. The la shaw_ ma has her hands washed first by the youngest woman or girl present because, it is said, the youngest must have the least accumula- tion of sins. This pure-impure symbolism changes within the rite to a junior- senior continuum, first in terms of age and, finally, in terms of status. At the headman's house the rite culminates in reciprocal handwashing by the la shaw_ ma and the headman's wife, symbolizing the supreme importance of the headman's office in matters secular. At the temple, the wife of the senior priest is the last to perform the ritual handwashing with the la shaw_ ma, symbolizing the supreme importance of the office of to bo pa_ in matters religious. The idea that the la shaw_ ma is acting on behalf of the whole community rather than as an individual is symbolized by her washing the hands of the headman and then of all other women with water from all the households, while her own hands are washed by each individual household representative. Sometime during the course of this shi" nyi eve, each household presents some raw grains of rice to the wife of the senior priest. On the merit day itself</page><page sequence="22">684 Anthony R. Walker Anthropos 76. 1981 the to bo ma will cook these grains with her own household rice, half in the morning and the other half at noon. Her husband, the to bo pa_, will offer a little of the cooked rice at the altar of GWv fu_ in the temple. This rice, being a mixture of grains given by every household, symbolizes the unity of the village community in making offerings to its guardian spirit. During the evening before a merit day, the village temple becomes the scene of dancing in honour of GWv sha, especially by the younger members of the community. Both sexes take part in the dance, the women forming the inner circle and the men the outer circle of dancers, although sometimes only one sex at a time takes the floor. The dance is led by someone playing a gourd flute (naw_) while another person beats the rhythm on a drum (pl. 2b and e). On the merit day itself, certain of these ritual activities are repeated. Additional rites peculiar to the shi" nyi proper are food offerings to G'ui^ fu_ and the house spirits, and the preparation and offering of ritual gifts to GWv sha. Before the to bo pa_ eats his morning meal on shi" nyi, he takes the village rice offerings to the temple. He places rice, water, and lighted beeswax candles on the altar to Gmv fu_ and, beating the temple gong, offers these gifts to the village protector (pl. 2a). Three examples of his prayer at this time are as follows : TEXT 1A 21 7.

No such divisions are recognized by the Lahu themselves. In translating these texts I have aimed to adhere as closely as possible to the orig- inal Lahu, enclosing additional English words in brackets as noted earlier (note 9) . Readers interested in a word-by- word analysis of Lahu ritual texts may consult Walker 1974a, 1975*, 19766, 1976d, 1977d, which include a "working translation" between the Lahu original and the full English translation. 22 Sha" is an untranslatable syllable often used to begin and end a prayer. 23 "All of G'ui^ fu_ 's people" means "all the villagers." 24 The repetition is varied in Lahu by the use of couplets: ta ti^ ta shehn" and ta ti^ ta hkà" . 25 That is, "at your altar in the village temple."</page><page sequence="23">Merit Days among the Lahu Nyi, North Thailand 685 3.

White lotus hpeu^ k'o " refers to the small woven basket (fig. 5a) which the to bo pa_ places on G'ui^ fu_ 's altar in the temple. 40 "All your children," i. e., "all the children of G'ui^ fu_" means "all the villagers. " The whole means, "let all the villagers be united in their allegiance to their headman. " 41 Kef shaw_ pa_ (etymology unknown) is one of the titles given to an oracle. In the Lahu Nyi context, an oracle is a person who is believed to be possessed, periodically, by the supreme divinity, G'ui^ sha, who causes that person to weep and shake. In Lahu such a trance state is known as G'ui^ sha aw^ ca" ya^ ve (aw^ ca" "rope/' ya^ ve "to come down"), and the Lahu Nyi conceive that the person in trance is joined as with a rope to G'ui^ sha. There is no notion here of the kd* shaw_ pa_ sending his soul (aw^ ha) on a shamanistic "trip" to the heavenly regions, nor is it believed that G'ui^ sha actually enters the ko* shaw_ pa_ 's body. Rather, the kaT shaw_ pa_ in trance is mystically united with G'ui^ sha, so that he becomes the mouthpiece of the divinity and is able to relay the latter's wishes to the people. All the villagers, even the senior priest himself, must accept the oracle's words.</page><page sequence="27">Merit Days among the Lahu Nyi, North Thailand 689 6.

Other names for a ka" shaw_ pa_ (female, ka" shaw_ ma) are fa" la" pa_ (female, ta" Id* ma) and, for females only, na kai ma. I could not deduce from my informants' explanations the etymologies of any of these names. In an earlier publication (Walker 1969: 47 f.) I both mis-spelt ka" shaw_ ma (wri- ting hk'aT shaw ma) and mis-recorded the nature of this role, suggesting that the ka" s haw ma was a ritual official of much the same order as the la shaw_ ma. The duties I recorded as inherent in the office of ka" shaw_ ma were, in fact, those taken upon herself (or, in Lahu eyes, ordained by G'ui^ sha) by a particular ka" shaw_ ma in one of my study villages. 42 The whole phrase means "may all the ritual specialists be united m tneir alle- giance to the senior priest [to bo pa_)."

While the to bo pa_ thus prays and offers cooked rice and water on behalf of all the villagers to G'ui^ fu_ at his altar in the village temple, each household head propitiates in like manner his own yeh^ ne" or house spirit. An altar to this individual household protector is to be found in every house and is usually located inside the household head's room, against the back wall of the house. It is always placed on the opposite side of the house from that containing the fireplace, because, informants told me, the spirit is offended by the smell of cooking flesh. The altar is identical in construction to that to GWv fu_ in the temple and on it, as on G'ui^ fu's altar, may be found two small porcelain cups for water and rice offerings. Whether or not the household head chants an offertory prayer at this time, in the manner that the to bo pa_ does in the haw' yeh^ (but without the use of the gong), will depend on whether or not he is familiar with the style and content of such prayers. In my experience, it is only the older household heads who know the prayer to the house spirit. Two versions of this prayer are as follows : 45 That is, "let there be no dispute among the villagers."</page><page sequence="30">692 Anthony R.

[undecaying] life of the white stone kaw mo" taweh_ up there 53, let them suffer no troubled thoughts, this boon alone once again order and put upon us. After the morning meal on this merit day itself, the women perform the water exchange rite exactly as on the previous evening. Those who wish to make offerings (hpeu^ k'o_, ha pui, mi^ co, kaw mó" taweh_, ku^ ti^, and hto" hi') prepare these during the morning and take them to the temple at any conve- nient time. It is not obligatory to prepare such offerings but people who have some special wish in mind, or households with sick members, will usually do so 54. When somebody is extremely sick certain very special offerings may be taken along to the temple in addition to the aforementioned ones. These are a small paper cut-out figure of a human being, about 12-15 cm. long (fig. 7), called a to keu~-e (to from aw„ to "body," keu~-e [?]) and a set of white clothing (shirt and pants for a sick man, blouse and sarong for a woman). These offerings are placed along with all the others on the right-hand side, or in front of Gwv sha's throne in the haw' yeh^. Once they have been ritually offered to the supreme divinity by the to bo pa_, they are brought back to the sick person's house. Here the to keu~-e is immediately suspended above the place where the patient is lying, while the clothing is kept until the following day when the sick person will put it on. Sickness is frequently attributed by these Lahu to soul loss (cf. Walker 1972a), and both to keu~-e and white clothing are associa- ted with the attempt to coax the sick person's wandering soul, or aw^ ha, to (n return to its rightful abode so that the patient will recover. It is thought that GWv sha will send the wandering soul back to the to keu~-e, from which it will re-enter the patient's body. The white clothes, symbolizing purity, are thought to encourage the soul to return. Fig. 7 A to keu~ -e, paper cut-out figure of a human being (length approximately 12 cm.) 53 Reference to G'ui^ sha's divine kaw rncT taweh_ in heaven, the prototype for all earthly kaw mó" taweh_, see p. 673. 54 Thus I recorded the following comment: Shi~ nyi hta~ hkaw~ tan" te ga~ k'o, te ma" te On shf nyi, one may make offerings or not gà' k'o, te chf md* he* .

Walker Anthropos 76. 1981 With her noon meal, the to bo ma, wife of the senior priest, prepares the remainder of the rice donated by the households, and in the evening her hus- band once again offers this to G'ui^ fu_, his prayer being almost identical with that of the morning. The household heads also make offerings once again to their respective house spirits during the course of the evening. A little before dusk the women repeat for a third and last time the handwashing rite. Later in the evening of this merit day the to bo pa_ comes to the temple and, with prayer, offers to GWv sha all the ritual gifts of the villagers. This prayer, two versions of which are recorded below, affords considerable insight both into the Lahu concepts of G'ui^ sha and Ai ma and into the hopes and aspirations of these Lahu villagers. It is clear from both versions of the to bo pa_'s prayer that these Lahu Nyi conceive GWv sha and Ai ma as male and female creators, the epitome of truth and value, omnipotent protectors against every misfortune. It is also evident that the female Ai ma is respected partic- ularly as the source of fertility. The close association of G'ui^fu_, the village protector, with the temple is also evident from the prayers. Then again, the prayers show how these Lahu conceive the village temple and its entire con- tents to be no more than earthly replicas of divine prototypes in Gmv sha s heaven. The chief hopes and aspirations of the villagers, as is clear from the priest's repeated requests, are physical and mental health, longevity, an absen- ce of dispute and an abundance of food, and all these blessings to be enjoyed by every person, child or adult, female or male of whatever household, all to the same degree.

It is not clear to me why the temple should be so designa- ted rather than as "G'ui^ sha 's house/' especially in a prayer directed specifically to G'ui^ sha rather than to G'ui^ fu_. Indeed, I rather suspect that the reciter has mistakenly used the couplet fu_ yeh^ ki yeh^ where g'ui^ yeh^ haw" yeh^, "G'ui^ sha 's house" would have been more appropriate. Such errors are not uncommon in the recitation of ritual texts, all of which must be committed to memory. (See next note for further evidence of a mistaken usage.) 56 The "offering bundle" of bamboo sticks called sha pui is kept to the right of G'ui^ sha's throne but not necessarily to the right of G'ui^ fu_ 's altar.

I put [my prayer] to the all-true, all- powerful Father here at this place; may the hands of all people, the big and the small, receive great merit, so that they may not fall victim to men of evil intent nor to malicious spirits. 57 In fact, only the to bo pa_ is lighting the candles, but he is specifically doing so on behalf of the whole community. 58 I do not understand the meaning of Pa_ la_ here. But .bather Fa_ la_ s haw_ yeh " according to the man who recited this prayer, is "the Great Paw hku" 's temple." This "Great Paw hku"" (in Lahu, Paw hku" Ion" : paw hku' from Shan, paw "father" and hku [khuri], a title of respect; Ion" "great") is a particular Lahu religious leader with messianic pretensions (cf. Walker 1974έ?: 703-705). He lives across the Burmese border from Thailand, in Muang Ton district of the Burmese Shan State. 59 Here again, "Father Sha ca is said to be a reierence to tr ui^ sha, not to Sha" ca" ', the culture hero.

Walker 1976a: 381), while taw^ seems to have the connotation "two-pointed" and le~ means "smooth, slippery," thus "the smooth two-pointed meh^ [fork]." G'ui^ sha is said to possess such a weapon, the divine prototype of those ritual forks which are made by Lahu Nyi village blacksmiths and used to exorcise the malicious meh^ spirits (cf. Walker 1976a: 406-421; 1980a). 61 The divine prototype of the small ottering benches found in the haw yeh^ and in the headman's house (see above, pp. 677 and 682). 62 Li^ pui refers to the sha pui and keh_ pui.</page><page sequence="38">700 Anthony R.

Oh, nine times in one day once again open upon us and grant to us the fertility of Ai ma; when we work in the fields may each one of us suffer from no uneasy thoughts. At the end of a merit day, the rites conclude with dancing in the temple. Depending on the enthusiasm of the dancers, this may go on late into the night or finish early in the evening. Sometimes the villagers are loathe to visit the temple at all and so no dancing takes place. This is most likely during the rainy season when the village site becomes a quagmire. Aside from the ritual activities - exchanging water, making and presen- ting offerings, praying to Gwv sha, Ai ma, G'ui^ fu_ and the house spirit, and dancing in the temple - a merit day is one of socially-imposed rest. Small tasks around the village, fence repairs and the like, are permitted but all agricultural work is forbidden. Villagers living in their fieldhuts away from the main village settlement are expected, if at all possible, to return to the village on a merit day; but if it is inconvenient for them to do so, they should nonetheless respect the prohibition of agricultural work during this day. Wild animals should not be hunted nor domestic animals killed on a merit day; and generally people refrain from eating meat on this day as well, although I have heard it said that it is really only the headman and senior ritual specialists who must rigorously obey this rule 66. Concluding Remarks A shi~ nyi, or merit day, is essentially an occasion when the villagers make a positive effort to restore good relations with the supernatural world by accumulating blessings or merit (aw^ bon) and ridding themselves of sin or demerit (ve~ ba~). It is also the occasion when the whole community reaffirms its communal identity, through rituals such as the mixing of waters, the mixing of rice offerings, and dancing together in the temple. In day-to-day life, Lahu Nyi society is heavily household- rather than village-orientated, but as the prayers I have presented here make clear again and again, on this special day it is everyone's desire that "all the people within the four corners of the village," the "big and the small/' "every household/' "every person/' "the womenfolk and the menfolk/' "the husbands and the wives" together receive the blessings of the supernatural world. 66 An informant put it this way: Shf nyi sha_ mcf ccf ve leh to bo pa_ leh a daw* pa , la shaw_ pa_, sa_ la_ pa_, chi te hpa yo^. Co* k'o, rnd* da^. Cd' ve te" y an , nyi ma md' da^, sha_ hk'a shu^ shu^ hpeh^ ve hta^, k'aui ve yo^. The people who don't eat meat on merit days are the to bo pa_, the headman, the la shaw_ pa, and the sa_ la_ pa_. If they eat, it is no good. If they eat their hearts are no good, they become like animals themselves, this they are afraid of.</page><page sequence="42">704 Anthony R. Walker Anthropos 76. 1981 As with so many Lahu Nyi ritual practices, it seems almost certain that the celebration of days of merit, marked by the phases of the moon, together with the attendant prohibitions against work and taking life, have their origin in the Buddhist practices of the lowland Tai neighbours of this mountain people. Among the Buddhist lowlanders there are four days in each month which are set apart for special religious observances. (Among the Khon Muang or Northern Thai, the immediate lowland neighbours of the Lahu in Thailand, these are called wan sin "precept days/' because then the laity go to the temple to request and receive from the head monk the five precepts or rules of con- duct; among the Central Thai they are wan phraa or "Lord's days/' as they are associated with the Lord Buddha.) These fall on the day of the new moon, the eighth day of the waxing moon, the day of the full moon and the eighth day of the waning moon. But the two most important of these "precept" or "Lord's days" are the days of the full moon and the new moon, to which the Lahu Nyi shi~ nyi directly correspond. The lowland neighbours of the Lahu Nyi in north Thailand also observe, more or less strictly, abstention from regular work activities and from killing animals on these "precept days" (cf. Kingshill 1960 : 142f.). Centuries of more or less intimate association with Tai-speaking Bud- dhist peoples (in China, Burma and Laos as well as in Thailand) has left an indelible "Buddhist" stamp on Lahu ritual practice. Nonetheless, both the practice and supporting ideology constitute a distinctively Lahu adaptation and one still outside the pale of orthodox Theravada Buddhism.
