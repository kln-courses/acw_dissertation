<plain_text><page sequence="1">CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Volume V, Number 1, September 1975 CRITICAL NOTICE ROM HARRE and PAUL F. SECORD, The Explanation of Social Behaviour (Oxford : Basil Blackwell, 1972). Pp. vii, 327. The human ("behavioural") sciences have long been under the sway of unsuitable methodological and theoretical paradigms: mechanism, positivism, and Humean causality. A necessary condition of scientific progress in the understanding of behaviour is the replace- ment of these paradigms by paradigms based upon that conception of human beings which they have of themselves, according to which behaviour consists of meaningful action performed for reasons, rather than meaningless movement elicited by stimulations. We may contrast the behaviorism of Watson, Hull and Skinner unfavourably with the "rule-governed" paradigm articulated in philosophy by such writers as Peters, Melden, Anscombe and Hampshire and represented in social theory by the symbolic interactionist school originating in the writings of G.H. Mead and Schutz and continued today in Goffman's Dramaturgy and Garfinkel's Ethnomethodology. Such at any rate is the view of Harr6 and Secord, as presented in their recent book. There is no doubt that sympathy towards ideas of these kinds has been growing for some time now, and the fact that Harr6 and Secord have set out to systematise and synthesize them may be partly responsible for the excitement with which their book has been greeted in philosophical circles in England. The book consists essentially of two parts: a critique of the "old paradigm" and a presentation of the "new." Harr6 and Secord's criticisms of the tradition of behaviorism, with its associated doctrines of positivism and mechanism, contain much that is of value, particular- ly in the detailed discussion of the presuppositions of laboratory ex- periments on human beings in psychology (the difference between this approach and the "real-life" investigations of Goffman et a/, is compared with the difference between the experimental psy- chologists' laboratory work on animals and the work of such ethologists as Tinbergen and Lorentz). In spite of this, however, there is a failure to meet the central tenets of positivism head-on. The authors may feel this to be unnecessary on the grounds that these have been adequately dealt with elsewhere, though that is by no means clear to this reviewer. Nor is it clear that the Harre and Secord 173</page><page sequence="2">Henry Laycock "paradigm" is related to the "old paradigm" in the way the authors claim it to be. The "new paradigm" appears to be presented as a consequence of the rejection of the old; they appear to be presented as two exclusive and exhaustive alternatives. But we are surely not committed to accepting Harr6 and Secord's thesis in virtue of rejecting behaviorism; this should I think become clear as we reconstruct the thesis they present. There are in fact a number of strands within Harre and Secord's argument, but in so far as the book has a central theme, it is this. Life consists of episodes - sequences of happenings involving one or more persons and having some "principle of unity." Episodes con- stitute a spectrum bounded at one end by wholly formal episodes, and by wholly causal episodes at the other. Formal episodes have intrinsic social "meaning"; their performance involves the conscious applica- tion of explicit rules or conventions, probably written or printed, as in marriage ceremonies, games of chess, and juridical procedures such as trials. Causal episodes, by contrast, have no intrinsic social "meaning," and involve the operation of causal (physiological, chemical and the like) mechanisms, as in pregnancy, birth, and (physical) illness. Within formal episodes, Harre and Secord distinguish two dimen- sions of internal structure, overt and covert. The overt structure of an episode is its "act-action structure," which is generated by the follow- ing of specific types of rules and which thereby possesses a specific type of unity. Four types of overt structure are distinguished: ceremonial structures, such as are exemplified in church services, graduation ceremonies, and the like; game structures (e.g. in baseball or cricket); routine structures (as in servicing cars), and entertainment structures (humming tunes, idle conversations). (The rationale for dis- tinguishing just these four overt episode structures is nowhere made clear: if they are supposed to be exhaustive then what is to be done about e.g. debates; and if they are not, by what criterion of importance are other formal episode types ignored?) The covert structure of an episode consists of those features of the episode which are functions of the particular capacities of its performers (its so-called Power struc- ture - examples given are the capacity to use language, the trait of adaptability, the posit of "ego-strength"), and those features of the episode which are features of the emotional condition of its per- formers (its so-called Arousal structure - conditions of anger, friendliness, etc.) Roles are then sets of actions prescribed by the rules for the particular performers within the act-action structure. Between formal and causal episodes is that vast mass of everyday episodes which are characterised as enigmatic - neither clearly for- mal nor clearly causal. Enigmatic episodes may involve a straight- forward mix of formal and causal elements, as, we are told, can be found in an act of murder; but very often enigmatic episodes are in 174</page><page sequence="3">Critical Notice The Explanation of Social Behaviour fact closely analogous to formal episodes, as involving the operation and application of rules and conventions, although the rules and con- ventions in enigmatic episodes are not explicit but tacit, and may need to be uncovered by empirical investigation. In producing hypotheses concerning these tacit rules and conventions, the act-action structures of formal episodes are to be used as models, and in the testing of these hypotheses there are two kinds of techniques available. First - this is due to Garfinkel - one may deliberately create a hiatus in the social fabric, so that, in the effort to restore the fabric, the tacit and un- acknowledged rules and conventions holding that fabric together are exposed. Second, one may analyse the accounts given by the par- ticipants of their roles in an episode through adoption of the "dramaturgical standpoint" - in which the investigator (who may well be a participant) distances himself from the action, treating it as analogous to a theatrical or dramatic performance, with a view to un- covering the "script," role-structures, etc. (and this is due to Goff- man). Construing life-episodes in general on the model of formal, rather than causal episodes, is thus the central model and thesis of the book, and it is said to constitute, rather grandiosely,a"Copernican revolution in the social sciences" (p. 172). It involves rejection of the positivist- mechanist model of man and the adoption instead of (what looks very much like a question-begging) "anthropomorphic model of man," "treating people as if they were human beings" instead of mechanical systems. Such is the standpoint of ethogeny, the analysis of the springs of action of self-directing agents who act as they do for reasons and in accordance with social rules and conventions. Harre and Secord's positive theses are thus misleadingly represented as being derivative from "concepts embedded in or- dinary language," as they frequently claim. Rather, they bear a quite intimate family resemblance to the micro-sociological doctrines of Goffman and Garfinkel, on the one hand, and to the philosophical doctrines of the school of the later Wittgenstein, on the other (as the authors in effect acknowledge). Wittgensteinian ideas of language "games," notions of meaning as a function of rules, Austinian ideas about the "conventional" nature of speech acts, theses concerning the institutional, rule-bound, game-like character of such "practises" as promising, are of a piece with Harre and Secord's views of the struc- ture of social action. More specifically, their views seem tantamount to a statement of the doctrines of structural-f untionalism (on the level of micro-sociology), according to which society is a cluster of interlock- ing institutions, institutions are clusters of interlocking roles, and roles are clusters of interlocking norms - with the one proviso that structural-functionalism is purged of all causal significance. 175</page><page sequence="4">Henry Laycock There is thus a very real question as to the legitimacy of Harre and Secord's identification of the old and new paradigms in social psy- chology, the mechanistic and "anthropomorphic" models of man. For the rule/role model has long been the standard model of structural- functionalism, while the mechanistic model has existed primarily in experimental (non-social) psychology. The grand ogres of mechanism in psychology - Pavlov and Skinner - were not primarily concerned with social behaviour, but with the experimental investigation of such animal (and human) characteristics as the capacity to learn, to perceive and to remember. Social psychologists, on the other hand, have traditonally concerned themselves with such norm- and role- permeated phenomena as conformity and deviance, socialization, personality and attitudes. There has it is true been some influence of (behaviourist) learning theory in social psychology; but the field has been influenced to a far greater extent by the work of gestalt psy- chologists. Equally puzzling in this connection is Harr£ and Secord's castigation of the Humean model of causality associated with the "old paradigm." For although the Humean model of causality is no doubt inadequate, Harr6 and Secord appear to reject any project of causal explanation where formal episodes, and those enigmatic episodes which are to be understood on the formal model, are concerned. Un- der the guise of a rejection of positivism, the authors wish to reject a notion fundamental to science as such, so far as the understanding of human behaviour is concerned. They argue that reasons of the sort that may motivate behaviour cannot be causes of behaviour, but they make no mention of arguments such as those provided by Davidson to the effect that such reasons are precisely a species of cause. It has been convincingly argued by Grice, in a well-known series of articles, that the notion of meaning has no essential connection with the notion of a rule, and is to be explained instead in terms of (pre- conventional) intentions of a rather complex kind. Harr£ and Secord, however, seem to think that meaning and conventions are in- separable. Now it has been pointed out often enough already, but merits emphasizing once again, that the vision of meaningful human activity as being essentially constituted by rules and conventions just will not do. Although rules and conventions may indeed be superim- posed upon virtually any human activity, apart from those activities of which they are constitutive, what matters is the contrast between those activities which are essentially constituted by conventions and those which are not. Parents may engage in bathing the baby, labourers in digging a ditch, bakers in baking bread, and in none of these need any reference to rules or conventions be made. Nor is any such reference required in the description of an act whereby one person shoots, stabs or injures another; and even in such "paradigmatically rule- governed" activities as games there may so far as I can see be a total 176</page><page sequence="5">Critical Notice The Explanation of Social Behaviour absence of rules and conventions. The aim of the children's game Hunt the Slipper is just to find a hidden slipper, no holds barred; whether the game is being played or not is a function of nothing but the existence of a slipper, some children, and their intentions. In- troductions, dates and marriages, games of chess, baseball and bridge, on the other hand, are activities in which rules and conventions play an undeniable and essential role. To view meaningful human activity in general on the model of in- stitutionalised rule-bound convention-governed activity is hardly less suffocating than to view it on the mechanistic model, and this is particularly true of the specific "dramaturgical" model which Harr6 and Secord present. An actor has no choice as to courses of ac- tion whatsoever, so long as he is acting; his freedom is limited at best to the style of his performance. Yet this seems to be the form that Harre and Secord's rule-governed model of ordinary (enigmatic) behaviour takes - the acting out of pre-determined sequences or patterns of behaviour, in which people are not to be distinguished from the masks or sets of masks they "wear." "Act-action structures can be classified by a taxonomical system analogous to the classification of plots ... Suspense is introduced by so selecting the items portrayed that the outcome cannot be anticipated with certainty, from the information given, though it is assumed that the outcome is 'predestined', i.e. will be seen in the end to be inevitable, and is, of course, actually deter- mined by the script" (p. 212). It is no doubt important to distinguish, as Harre and Secord are concerned to distinguish in their discussion of persona and roles, the social self or individual from the biological self or individual (they argue plausibly that there need be no one-one correspondence here); but such a distinction does not require that we take the analogies between theatre and life quite so seriously as this. Indeed, those analogies (of which Harr6 and Secord make so much) are necessarily inadequate, since understanding the point of a play presupposes un- derstanding the distinction between the real person and his dramatic role. Harre and Secord are right to distinguish the biological and social selves: what is unsatisfactory about their model is the conception they have of the social self. There is no explanation, or indication of the need for explanation, of the origins of the rules and roles which may indeed bear an internal relationship to the constitution of the social self. About where the rules come from, and what their point is, if any, nothing is said. They are the apparently static and a-historical structure within which life goes on. There is in fact an important difference, within the book, between what is said and what is suggested. What is said is that the ethogenic- dramaturgical approach is intended to apply primarily to face-to-face interactions between individuals, that it is a paradigm for the use of 177</page><page sequence="6">Henry Laycock social psychology, and not, e.g., for economics or sociology. Ethogeny supplies a conceptual scheme "for classifying and analysing the struc- ture of those episodes studied by social psychologists" (p. 155), and social psychology is "concerned with individuals, and with groups only in so far as these bear upon the performances of individuals" (p. 155). But what seems to be suggested is that a rather thick wedge can be driven between the performances of individuals and their memberships in groups, so that a concern with social groups is of minor significance, and the important things that need to be said about the explanation of behaviour can be said with little or no reference to more global considerations about the classes, parties, un- ions, nations, socio-economic systems and so on to which people belong. Social life appears as a thin web of ceremonies and quasi- ceremonies, games and quasi-games, and so on, lacking in any overall principles of unity, and nowhere do the fundamental social activities essential to the physical survival of the species - the production of the necessities of life - receive any kind of recognition. In this connection we may return to Harre and Secord's conception of the human being as an agent who controls and directs his own behaviour, rather than as a mechanism passively responding to stimuli. There is perhaps a rather trivial sense in which, in so far as behaviour is intentional, it must indeed be under the control or direction of the agent; but there is an important sense in which much of the inten- tional activity of human beings may not be under their control. Apart from the (diminishing) subjugation of life to the forces of nature, there is the subjugation of life to social forces. I have in mind that fundamen- tal thesis of historical materialism according to which the network of social activities under the capitalist mode of production is not in fact subject to the control of the agents involved - that the market has an anarchic and alarmingly autonomous life of its own. There may for ex- ample be crises of unemployment and overproduction, the results of nothing but human activity it is true, yet crises which the agents in- volved are virtually powerless to prevent, Keynes notwithstanding. Unemployment and the like are phenomena which people suffer; they are on the receiving end and the role of human agency and con- trol are reduced to a minimum, to the level of responses to a mechanism. People's lives and life-activities, far from being deter- mined by the agents who live and execute them, are controlled to a greater or lesser degree by the impersonal operations of the market. The absolutely basic human activity, without which life could not con- tinue, is work, and to the extent that work is integrated into the market, to that extent it becomes a commodity, whose form and con- tent are dictated by the market, and in particular by the ruthless logic of profit-maximisation. A necessary condition of people regaining control of their life-activity is that they control, i.e. suppress, the operations of the market. Serious consideration of the relationships 178</page><page sequence="7">Critical Notice The Explanation of Social Behaviour between the life of the individual and the overall structure of society - relationships which are becoming increasingly difficult to ignore - is nowhere to be found within ethogeny, nor in the related work of Goff man (who seems to think that the keys to contemporary life are to be found in the kitchens of hotels in the Shetland Islands1). Correlatively, there is a distinction between those roles which may be freely adopted by an individual, and those which he or she cannot escape. The former are compatible with the individual's retaining con- trol over his or her behaviour; the latter are not. But such a distinction cannot be made by Harre and Secord, for whom explanation in terms of roles and explanation in terms of self-direction coincide. At this point we have to raise the question of the precise nature of the discipline referred to as "social psychology." How, if at all, is it to be distinguished from individual psychology? (I have in mind here not a distinction in terms of enumerating the disparate phenomena ac- tually studied in these disciplines, but rather in terms of a theoretical rationale behind the division of labour.) If individual psychology were understood to be the study of those states and phenomena designated by psychological predicates not necessarily relating two or more human subjects (what we might call monadic psychological predicates, e.g. "remembers," "learns," "sees"), then social psy- chology might be understood to be the study of those states and phenomena designated by psychological predicates essentially relating two or more human subjects (which we might call dyadic or n- adic psychological predicates, e.g."understands," "sympathises with," "intimidates"). However, a concern for rigorously defining the separate fields of individual and social psychology is not easily discern- ed in the literature; but until social psychology is at least tolerably clearly demarcated from adjoining areas, we can hardly proceed with considerations on the methodology most appropriate to it. (Such con- cern is reinforced by noting that writers like Goffman, presumably regarded by Harre and Secord as social psychologists, are regarded by the sociological community as sociologists). The literature on social psychology abounds with vague phrases about the "interaction of in- dividual psychology and social structure," "the interaction of in- dividual psychologies," and so on. It is a disappointing feature of Harre and Secord's undeniably provocative book that no attempt is made at a theoretical demarcation of the field they are concerned to discuss from the presumably related fields of sociology and individual psy- chology (this failure is perhaps mitigated somewhat by the notorious and widespread failure to provide any general rationale for the divisions between the various human sciences. Indeed the intra- disciplinary claims of each of a number of the human sciences to be in- dividually the basis for an understanding of human activity quite 1 See the preface to The Presentation of the Self in Everyday Life. New York: Doubleday, 1959. 179</page><page sequence="8">Henry Laycock generally may be regarded as an implicit rejection of the validity of regarding the human sciences as quasi-autonomous disciplines). In fact Harre and Secord's causal remarks on this question are extremely puzzling. Social psychology is said by them to be concerned fun- damentally with individuals and not groups, yet the central concepts of The Explanation of Social Behaviour, such as role and convention and dramaturgy, are obviously concepts that only make sense in terms of the interactions of two or more individuals, who may be presumed to thereby constitute themselves into groups. Finally, some remarks about Harre and Secord's views on the ques- tion of "subjectivity." The authors advocate a quasi-introspectionist "Open Souls" doctrine, according to which in order to be able to treat "people as if they were human beings it must be possible to accept their commentaries upon their actions as authentic, though revisable, reports of phenomena, subject to empirical criticism" (p. 101). If this is intended to mean that the kinds of explanations that people give of what they do must be accepted as the right kinds of explanations, sub- ject perhaps to limited modification, then Marxian and Freudian con- ceptions of ideology and rationalisation are ruled out of court. The justification the authors offer for such a view are puzzlingly behaviouristic, in the light of their general anti-behaviourist position: " ... some statements are not a sign of a state of mind, but themselves constitute that state of mind (e.g., to complain is to be discontented) " (p. 7, italics in original). Equally puzzling is the thesis that questions about the relationship between psychological states ("S-states") and physiological states ("P-states") have already been settled empirically by psychologists: "We know from a number of studies . . . that the cor- rect way of considering the S-sequence with respect to the P- sequence, is that the S-sequence consists of the meanings given by he who experiences that sequence to some of the items of the P- sequence" (p. 23, italics in original). Philosophically, and in spite of its length, The Explanation of Social Behaviour has rather more of the character of a rough and ready manifesto than a rigorous treatise, but this at any rate gives the book a certain provocative quality, and it will hopefully contribute something to further interchange between philosophers and social scientists. There are rather too many typographical errors, none of them important.2 HENRY LAYCOCK May 1975 Queen's University 2 I have benefitted from reading an interesting discussion by David Ingleby, "New Paradigms for Old", in Radical Philosophy no. 6.
