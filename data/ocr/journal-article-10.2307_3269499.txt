<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHTHONIAN CATTLE BY H. J. ROSE The accident of a sister University needing an external examiner brought me into contact, not long ago, with a learned Netherlander, Dr. J. H. Croon, who has made himself an authority on hot springs in the ancient Greek world and on the reactions of the Greeks to these interesting phenomena especially in early days, before they came to appreciate them as spas. Briefly, his conclusions are that they were thought of as hellmouths, and they were associated with several deities, Herakles notably, Artemis quite often, Hephaistos now and then. Asklepios of course belongs to a later period, when the springs were not so much feared as valued. As might be expected, legends connected with these springs and often historically traceable to the very spots where they exist are pretty common, and in a printed thesis, for which Amsterdam gave the author his second doctorate, he discusses a pic- turesque figure characteristic of some at least of these tales. He calls him the Herdsman of the Dead, and the most famous name in this connexion is Geryon, who of course brings us into contact with Hera- kles once more. That the hero went to seek Geryon's cattle and brought them back after various subsidiary adventures is well known. That Geryon is a figure of the underworld, in some respects parallel at least to Hades himself, is also no news to anyone who has read the ancient authors with any care, to say nothing of the many moderns who have written on the subject. For his somewhat less familiar con- nexion with hot springs I cannot do better than to quote Dr. Croon's own words, which I do with a certain envy, for I heartily wish I could express myself as well in Dutch, or in any Continental idiom, as he does in English. Now the saga of Geryoneus, as well as the various stories of Heracles' adventures on his way back with the cattle, show a remarkable tendency to be localized near hot springs. This has been observed by Gruppe.... The places mentioned by him are: Temenothyrae in Lydia, Segesta and Himera in Sicily, Patavium in N. Italy, Chaonia, and, of course, Baiae itself. We shall have</page><page sequence="2">H. J. Rose occasion to add Hypata in the Spercheius-valley, and perhaps Gades, the traditional dwelling-place of Geryon. So far, then, a strange and monstrous figure, herdsman of extra- ordinary cattle, who has a good deal to do with hot springs. So far also Dr. Croon is simply dealing with facts; that the legend was told in this way and the places he names were associated with it is fully proved, and the existence of the springs is a matter of geological ob- servation. It is when he starts to interpret the tale, i.e., to get back to the root idea which underlies it and gave rise to it, that I am inclined to disagree with him. He calls Geryon, Alkyoneus and a few other characters of mythology "herdsmen of the dead", and it is the quali- fying clause which is theory and therefore disputable. I quote him again 2). The most obvious inference would be that the Herdsman represents the (or at least a) god of the Underworld, and the cattle the souls of the Dead. This is no new idea. Weicker refers to this theory and gives some hints, without, however, examining it more closely. But there is more... I have pointed to the fact that in Apollodorus' story of Heracles' descent, the cattle of Hades occur again: Heracles slaughters one of them and wrestles with Menoites. In a passage from Pindar's Olympian Odes Hades is said to drive the dead down into a hollow road (like cattle!). And on the other hand there is Hermes PuxoXrojirc6 who is called eXoar3rp [3o&amp;v. It will be clear from these examples that the god of the Underworld, when he figures as a herdsman with cattle, is not thought of as an overlord of the dead, as a possessor, but as the master of the recently deceased, who are driven from the upper into the nether world. The reference to Pindar is of course given in his notes, which I have omitted in quoting. It is 0. ix, 33-5, part of that highly inter- esting passage in which Pindar's religious scruples move him to leave half-told the stories he knows of "strife and battle between the Death- less", and it runs: ouv' 'A3aoc4 axtvTaXv e X pa,f8ov p6osoc oa6pco,O' xocTaryE xoLXocv 7rpOq [&amp;lyuLav Ovoax6v'cov.

If we knew exactly how Hades was supposed to conduct the dead to his "hollow way" with his pd3p8og, we should be better fitted to say whether he resembles a cattle-driver or not. Certainly Hermes, when he takes the bat-like souls of the Wooers to their last abode, does not beat them with his wand, but goes on ahead waving it (xLv'actc), and they follow: Tr p~'ys xLvyaeo , tra 38 TrpLouaol. r0ov-To. The resemblance to a Levantine or Oriental herd going ahead of his beasts, not behind them, is patent, and so far we may suppose that the cattle of these mysterious herdsmen are ghosts; that Pindar says they are the bodies of the dead need not disturb us much, considering how little agreement there is, in Greece or out of it, as to what exactly does go to the dwelling-place of the departed. But there are difficulties in the way of such a supposition. One is, that what goes to the underworld when a man dies is gen- erally (despite a few passages like that cited from Pindar), a tenuous, phantasmal thing, buXZ) xoa cl 'toXov, which is never (outside philosoph- ical and quasi-philosophical speculations) a part of the living man. The living creature it seems most to resemble as a bat, or some insect such as a bee or butterfly 4), never anything so large and solid as the proverbially big and heavy cow or ox, the creature which imposes 3) As Iliad xxiv, 343-44, repeated Od. v, 47-48; it has all air of an old stock description, inherited with much else by Homer from his predecessors; Od. xxiv, 2-5 slightly modifies it to fit the context. Cf. the much-reproduced white-figure lekythos (Fig. 3, p. 64, in DE WAELE, The Magic Staff or Rod in Graeco-Italian Antiquity, The Hague 1927, which see for fuller discussion of this and like implements). That it is of gold in Homer means no more than that it belongs to a god; for the use of such an implement by a witch conjuring cf. Od. x, 238, 319, 389.

Rose lasting silence when it treads on the tongue, as the Watchman in the Agamemnon tells us, and the more foolish kind of commentator, ancient and modern, has vainly tried to hide from us 5). A metaphor might indeed exist which said (as Pindar seems to imply) that Hades or some other death-god governs or drives or pastures the dead like cattle; but if anything has emerged clearly from many centuries of reflexion on myths and their origins and significance it is that myth and metaphor are two very different things and the latter does not give rise to the former. The other difficulty is complementary. The cattle of Geryon are very real cattle. They need a formidable dog to help guard them; they are much sought after all the way from Erytheia to Argos by enter- prising thieves; they are quite at home in the upper air and crop ordinary pasture at their halting-places. Nothing suggests that they are in the least ghostly or different from ordinary cows and bulls except perhaps by being finer specimens than one generally meets. Once the adventures in the distant land of marvels where they lived are over, there is nothing more other-wordly in the whole transaction than in the transportation from Britain to Argentina of a fine bull to improve the local strains. Of the herds pastured by Alkyoneus we know much less; he was a herdsman, though a gigantic one, and Hera- kles killed him with some help from Telamon, or so Pindar says 6). Presumably, however, his cattle also were cattle. But if the Herdsman of the Dead does not herd ghosts, of what are his herds composed? The answer is perhaps a trifle long and com- plicated, but not, I think, uninteresting. It rests partly on a distinction for which I got the hint from that fruitful source of suggestions, Wilamowitz-Moellendorff. In his excellent work, which proved his swansong, Der Glaube der Hellenen 7) he introduces a distinction be- tween Ge, the fruitful and kindly Earth-Mother, and Chthon, who has to do with the dead, the Erinyes, horrible dreams and other un- chancy things. We may think what we like of the linguistic distinction: the factual antithesis is perfectly genuine. There are, so to speak, two 5) Aesch., Aga. 36.

There are the powers immediately under the surface of the earth who give us the timely fruits thereof, and there are the dwellers in the depths, rulers of ghosts and of the avengers of blood, who have no cult from the living, because the living have quite other gods, above and below. How little they were distinguished in common thought is clear from the confusion between Pluton, who is substantially the same as Plutos, and Hades, between the Erinyes and the Eumenides, between Kore and Persephone; but the distinction is nevertheless there, and every now and then it shows itself in some detail of legend or fact of cult. I believe we have to do with such a distinction here; in other words, that the alleged Herdsmen of the Dead are not of the dead at all, but of the upper region of the underworld, from which natural wealth, ploutos, may be looked for. But it may be asked: if these strange figures are connected with natural wealth, if they are in any sense originally -rXOUTroo86OT like the good daimones in Hesiod who once were men of the Golden Age 8), why do they not give corn? The answer again is a trifle complicated, but perfectly intelligible. The wealth of the upper classes in early Greece did indeed include land and portable objects of value such as gold or other metals, but its essential feature was cattle, large or small. If we consult the enumeration of Odysseus' wealth as given by Eumaios 9) we shall see this clearly. It consisted of twelve herds (of cattle) on the mainland, twelve flocks of sheep, twelve herds of swine, and a total of twenty-three flocks of goats. Nothing is said of his cornfields, although he doubtless, like other nobles, had his Tr4[pvoq or private domain, cultivated for him by his thralls, like that of the baron in the harvesting scene on the Shield 10). Indeed, he was him- self a good ploughman 11) on occasion. But of course his chief occupations were those proper to his rank, fighting when necessary and dispensing justice in time of peace. Now contrast the outfit of the small landowner (or -occupier), the peasant of Hesiod's time. Besides his tools and implements, his stock consists of "a house, a woman and an ox for the plough",-one ox, enough to pull the little 8) Hesiod, Op. et Di. 126. 9) Od. viv, Ioo foil.

If he works hard, he may one day come to own "many sheep" 13), but he has apparently no ambition to become a stock-raiser on a large scale, with herds of cattle to look after and increase. Such wealth is for his betters. In all this there is nothing characteristically or peculiarly Greek, or even peculiarly European. Much of our turbulent early history consists of the migrations of cattle-owning peoples, "strong, active, courageous and adventurous, devoted to the horse and accustomed on its back to drive herds of cattle over the grassy steppes", who on the whole "despise menial work, such as ploughing the land or digging the soil, just as they prefer cattle and beef to sheep or mutton, and have a contempt for fish-eaters and vegetarians". These have from time to time invaded and enthralled for a while populations of "thrifty, steady, hard-working tillers of the soil, patient but lacking the spirit of ad- venture." I quote with some abbreviation the lively description of the late Harold Peake, without committing myself to his further statement that the two peoples concerned were respectively Nordics and Al- pines 14), nor to the doubtful allegation that the cattle-breeders herded their cattle on horseback, although a Homeric hero can make shift to stick on a barebacked horse, as we see from the nocturnal adven- tures of Odysseus and Diomedes, which of course, like the whole of the Doloneia, form an inseparable and essential part of the Iliad 15). Much the same process, at any rate, has taken place over a considerable part of Africa, the cattle-breeders being of Bantu stock and speech 16). These characteristics of the Achaian invaders of Greece are reflected in their very names, for their men were fighters and horse-users, hence such luck-names as Menelaos, the warrior who can on occasion "take on" a whole Xoco6 of enemies, Leukippos, Xanthippos and a score of other horse-compounds, while on the other hand we find appellations such as Polyboia, the girl who, it is hoped, will grow up so attractive that her noble kin will get many cattle by way of bride- 12) Hesiod, Op. et Di. 405, cf. for the plough 427 foll. 13) Ibid., 308.

The ox is their equivalent of a monetary unit, at least for all large purchases, such as the respective suits of armour worn by Glaukos and Diomedes; it is well known that Lat. pecunia originates in a similar standard of value. Italy of course also had its invasions and its struggles between different cultural and per- haps racial elements, but fortunately that complicated business need not be dealt with now; Italy had no myths that we know of. Now one of the great difficulties in establishing anything like friendly relations on equal terms between conquerors and conquered must surely have been the lack of mutual understanding. To the cattle- breeder, the man who was content to remain year after year making holes in the same piece of ground and dropping seeds into them must have appeared a very strange creature, in fact a hopeless foreigner, probably a wizard in his spare time, as foreigners notoriously are apt to be. To the peasant, there was something very odd, if not actually mad, about a person who thought nothing of going away for many miles, taking all he had with him and caring little whether the gods of the land he finally halted at were familiar or not; who preferred meat as a daily diet to good nourishing corn; who risked his life be- hind, if not on the back of, so uncanny a creature as a horse; who seemed almost to like fighting against wild boars, brigands, and his fellow-madmen; and who knew nothing of the local speech but in- sisted on using a strange foreign jargon of his own, at most picking up a few of the proper words for various kinds of beasts, birds and plants, and no doubt mispronouncing them shockingly. Consequently, the stranger's large herds of cattle, which needed so much space for their pasture, must have seemed a further oddity, a sharp contrast to the sober possession of one ox or at most a pair, to be used when land was to be ploughed or heavy stuff hauled. It is not remarkable if the vassal told strange stories about these possessions of his lord and how they were come by in the first place. That some at least of the familiar stories were not Achaian in origin is indicated by more than one name. Geryon perhaps yields a Greek etymology; he may have something to do with the verb yp6uitv, but I doubt it. Formally, there seems to be no fatal objection, especially as both the verb and the noun have in their syllable the characteristic alternation between the Doric alpha and the Ionic-Attic eta; but semasiologically it is hard to see the appropriateness of such a name. What does Geryon "say" 2I9</page><page sequence="8">H. J. Rose or "utter" in any known version of his legend? No other meaning of the verb is attested, and to suppose that it can mean something like "bellow", as Drexler and some etymologists whom he follows do 17) is pure assumption, even if bellowing were not more appropriate to the herd than the herdsman. Alkyoneus has little better to show than a possible connexion with that mysterious bird the halcyon, which apparently is sometimes a kingfisher (with a song, which no known kingfisher has), sometimes a wholly mythical creature with odd nesting habits 18). And again, it is hard to see what a formidable giant, strong enough to give Herakles much trouble, has to do with an inoffensive fowl. More promising perhaps is the resemblance of his name to that of the heroine Alkyone, for a lady who calls herself Hera and turns into a bird, whether kingfisher or not, has some claim at least to be a "faded" goddess of Minoan-Mycenaean type 19). It would not sur- prise me if evidence were some day produced that both these super- natural herdsmen belonged to the mythical inheritance, not of the invaders, but of their underlings. So it is time to ask if we have any parallel to the existence of "upper" chthonians of any sort who have to do with cattle. I believe that traces can be found, not indeed with any great clearness in clas- sical Greek mythology, but in European folklore, including that of modern Greece. I mean the recurrent stories concerning a visit to what Professor R. M. Dawkins 20) calls the World Below. What this world is like is perhaps best explained in his own words. "This underworld, the World Below, has no connexion with the world of the dead; it is represented as a sort of separate and parallel country lying below the ordinary world of men.... We read very clearly of this World Below in a story from Astypalaia called The Magic of Solomon.... Loaded with treasure from some mysterious palace the hero returned to his wife. She said. 'And where have you come from?' 'I am coming', said he, 'from the World Below'. 'What! From Hades? 'No, not from there; that is where the dead are'. 'Then from where?' The husband said: 'From the other place; the men there are alive'. 'And where is this place?' 'Down below, but I don't know how to get there'." 17) DREXLER in ROSCHER'S Lexikon, vol. i, 2, col. 1630, 15. I8) See Sir D'A. W. THOMPSON, Glossary of Greek Birds, ed. 2 (Oxford 1936), pp. 46-49.

I understand that the learned author meditates further research into this very interesting theme. By mutual agreement, he and I are working independently from our respective angles. 220</page><page sequence="9">Chthonian cattle Tales of how some adventurous person, by courage, skill, favour of a supernatural being or sheer good luck, managed to get to this world are very common. Stith Thompson lists a number of them, clas- sified as F8o-I99 21 . He falls, however, into the common mistake of jumbling together stories of the World Below in Dawkins' sense of the term and tales of visits to the land of the dead, and notoriously he is at his weakest in dealing with Greek or other Mediterranean stories. However, he gives abundant proof that there is nothing peculiarly Greek in the theme; it is, incidentally, the counterpart of that other fairly common motif (it occurs in the familiar English story of Jack and the Beanstalk) of a land above the earth which is cer- tainly not the Christian or any other heaven. The wide distribution suggests at least the possibility that the World Below is a very old idea. The modern Greek specimens of it are all alike in this, that they contain nothing ghostly or suggestive of a world of departed spirits. For instance, in a tale from Chios, The Three Sisters and the Wild- cat, a girl follows a wildcat down a hole; it turns into an "Armenian", i.e., a supernatural being of more or less diabolical nature, she marries him, and the rest of the story is approximately Bluebeard22). An episode in a longer and more elaborate story from the same island, Fear, brings the hero, who has been marooned on a lonely island, down a flight of steps into the World Below, and there he has a stock series of adventures, told most fully in Hahn, No. 70 23). He finds that a monstrous serpent is cutting off the water-supply of the inhabitants, fights with it and kills it, unmasks a false claimant, and is restored to the world of men by means of birds (eagles in the full form of the tale) who carry him up on their backs. Again, there is nothing in the least ghostly about the World Below; people there live in houses, bake bread, have a king ruling over them, trees growing in their land, birds which nest in them and so forth. One underground narrative indeed gives the origin of the palace where the hero finds a princess whom he marries; a king for some reason makes an underground dwelling for his daughter and shuts her up in it, protected by magic 21) Motif-Index of Folk-Literature vol. iii (FF Communications, No. Io8), Helsinki 1934, p. ii foll. 22) P.

Rose doors which will open only at a magic password, "Open, tartara mar- tara of the earth !" 24) In another, the World Below has a population of monkeys, one at least of which can turn into a beautiful woman. She, after marrying the hero and helping him, by gifts from her mys- terious home, to pass certain tests, puts on her beauty (which has been safely kept for her, along with a fine suit of clothes for her husband, in a hazelnut) and the story ends by their becoming king and queen of an earthly kingdom 25). In all these tales, the World Below seems a prosperous and wealthy place, somewhat addicted to magical practices and containing occasional monsters, but hardly more than the surface of the earth produces in indrchen. Throughout, it seems to be the product of typical peasant imagination, and com- bining this with the reasons for supposing it a really old theme, we may, I suggest, without straining probability suppose that something of the kind was believed in, more or less seriously, by the lower strata of the early classical population, those who had the least amount of Achaian blood in their veins. So far, however, I have not been able to produce from the Greek world, ancient or modern, any definite association of the World Below with cattle. Yet such a connexion does exist, although not in Greece. I am well aware that the example I am going to adduce is from the wrong end of Europe and the wrong linguistic group, the Italo-Keltic. Nevertheless, I remain of opinion that a parallel from one peasant- culture is quite capable of throwing light on the thoughts and doings of another. Such illustrations are not cogent and final arguments, but used puzdenter et raro they have served before, and will serve again, to put us on the right track. I therefore proceed to look for Geryon and Alkyoneus in Wales and in so doing, I make the assumption that among the elements which have gone to form the complex figures of fairies are dim reminiscences of pre-Christian gods, perhaps not least of gods of the countryside, worshipped by and dear to the heart of the folk. Here are two or three versions of the story 26). There was a man who lived near Llyn y Fan Fach in Carmarthen- shire, and one day he saw a fairy woman sitting on the waters of the 24) HAHN, op. cit.

After a good deal of preliminary courtship, and negotiation with her father, he married her, on the usual terms of a tabu; she would leave him if struck three times without cause. Naturally, during their married life he thrice touched her in a way which might, by fairy logic, be interpreted as striking, and she departed. But the point of the story is that she brought from the lake and took back into it again when she left a handsome dowry consisting chiefly of cattle; at all events, it was the cattle which she summoned by name and of course in verse on her departure, and they went with her, taking the plough, for four of them were at work in the fields, and accompanied by a black calf which had been slaughtered and hung up on a hook. At Llyn Arennig, which is between Bala and Ffestiniog, there is no question of a fairy bride, but a countryman one day found a calf in the rushes of the lake, and naturally took it home with him, where in course of time it sired him a fine race of cattle. But one day a little piper came to the byre and called to the beasts in a rime: Mulican, Molican, Malen, Mair, Dowch adre rwan ar fy ngair. That is to say, "Mulican, Molican, Malen and Mary (the names of the cattle), come home now at my bidding". And they followed him into the lake and were never seen again. I would note that these Welsh dealers with uncanny folk living in lakes and owning fine cattle have no power over them, much less make any attempt to kill them in battle. Consequently they have no guarantee that the cattle will stay with them, and in fact they do not, but are reclaimed sooner or later by their original owners. Perhaps we may take a hint for the interpretation of the Greek legends. We have at least one instance of a supernatural beast which came from an un- defeated owner and brought little good to its mortal possessor. The bull which Poseidon sent to Minos caused nothing but trouble on earth until at last Theseus was able to kill it, or so the Athenians said. No one had done anything to lessen the power of Poseidon, and that god, al- though he dealt principally in horses and was himself capable of taking horse-shape (if indeed that was not his primitive form) still is the husband of the earth-goddess and ought as such to be quite as capable of producing other creatures which graze on her surface and, it would seem, can be conceived in her fertile womb. It is perhaps noteworthy that the bull is connected, not indeed with a story of an arbitrary tabu 223</page><page sequence="12">H. J. Rose being violated, but with a tale of an unfulfilled condition. Minos had promised to sacrifice it to Poseidon, but on seeing it was tempted by its beauty and used it, or tried to use it, for breeding purposes 27), whereat the god took his revenge by driving the bull mad. But at quite an early age, early enough for myths still to be produced and believed, it must have become evident that the herds of many cattle-owners did not disappear and did not go mad or otherwise misconduct themselves more than cattle are wont to do. Is it not a reasonable supposition that some would seek to account for this remarkable phenomenon, and that the explanation would use the known habits of the cattle- owners as part of the material? Ages later than the times when Hellenic and pre-Hellenic strata of the population were trying to explain each others' strange ways, Homer put into the mouth of an Achaian baron a brief explanation of how wealth was to be got by one of his class and temperament. "Cattle", says Achilles, "a man may reive, also stout sheep, and tripods and bay horses he may get" 28). How he would get the tripods and the horses it is easy to discover; they are the sort of guest-gifts that passed from noble to noble on their rounds of visits to one another 29). But cattle are things to plunder, XA'qxoi, a sentiment which any right- thinking Borderer, Scot or English, would have heartily endorsed had he been acquainted with the doings and sayings of this long-dead Greek baron. It was known to the learned, that is to the rhapsodes and epic poets of the day, in Hesiod's time that many men of the Heroic age were slain on account of the flocks and herds of Oidipus 30). In other words, the war in which the unfortunate king of Thebes fell was a large-scale cattle-raid. And Achilles himself elsewhere says he has no personal quarrel with the Trojans, for they never came reiving his cattle nor his horses 31). By the way, horses too may be got less peacefully than by way of gifts: T?XXa[ipoV[ct L EpYoLlv 'HpcxXeAo4, 27) Apollodoros ii, 94.

Such ideas of the nobility would be at least vaguely known to the peasantry of pre-Homeric days, much later, in the passage of Pindar I have already quoted (fgt. 152 Bowra, 187 Turyn), the raid on Geryon's cattle is actually cited as a prime instance of custom being king of all and lending justice to the strong, i.e., justifying their doings which, were they not customary, would be sheer violation of all principles of proper conduct. Let us now put these factors together. The gentry have their large herds of cattle, in which a great part of their wealth consists. Cattle (here I make an assumption only partly justified by Greek evidence and eked out by the folktales from Wales) are a characteristic possession of those chthonians who live fairly near the surface of the earth and may be reached, if one is bold enough, by one of the recognised routes, for choice by going to some place where a hot spring indicates that the nether world is not far off. But these same chthonians are for- midable persons, if less so than the lower ones who guard the world of the dead and no doubt rule it after their own grim fashion. Why, then, do they let their cattle go to even the boldest and most shameless raiders, when these take them, as Herakles did, without leave asked or price paid, vaiL-7,orr; T? xOCl a&amp;7rplraS ?

Such doctrines shocked Pindar in his day, and Homer will allow of a god being overcome by a man (Ares and Aphrodite by Diomedes) only under very exceptional circumstances, when another deity helps, though he too has heard of Herakles' exploits "at the Gate, all among the dead" 32). But surely they are quite understandable in the minds of the lower, "unprivileged" orders in early times, who had seen their own divinities able to do so little against the Zeus-worshipping in- vaders; so little that even the great Lady of Argos was reduced to the secondary position of a sister-wife and the Earth-Mother was almost hidden behind the imposing figure of her new and mighty husband, Poseidon. If the greatest were thus affected, it was no wonder if lesser powers, adored perhaps up and down the countryside but never considered to hold the very foremost places, were overcome, perhaps 32) Iliad v, 397; the same passage mentions the wounding of Hera herself by Herakles. NUMEN, I 16 225</page><page sequence="14">H. J. Rose actually killed. And in such a way as this I suggest the stories con- cerning Geryon and Alkyoneus took shape. Somewhere, perhaps near the local hot spring, perhaps far away in an unknown region from which the underworld was easily reached, there had been in the past beings much more than human, formidable if their anger was aroused, but harmless if left alone, and able if they chose to give the very acceptable gift of, say, a good plough-ox to those who won their favour. But no one has seen or heard of them lately, since the new lords with their new gods came into our land. Is it not likely that one of them, no ordinary man but a son of their greatest god and of more than mortal prowess, had a mind to get those cattle for himself or his over- lord, if he had one, and sought and found their owners, fought and killed them and took away their herds? Such a story would in time get about, as not a few tales of pre-Achaian days seem to have done, one way or another, and it would not be inacceptable to the Achaians, for did it not redound ad maiorem Herculis gloriam? And so in due course it found its place in the canonical cycle of the Labours, who- ever made that up and whenever he did it. Clearly, both cattle-raids could not come in, for they were too much alike, so Alkyoneus remained outside and Geryon, with his picturesque additions of the use of the Sungod's cup and so forth, was included. I am not so inexperienced as to suppose that in putting forward this brief and tentative explanation I have finally settled the questions relative to these remarkable figures. But I would call your attention to the following points which seem to favour my hypothesis. Firstly, it helps to explain why the beings concerned are in one way or an- other monstrous. Geryon is triple-bodied (the details vary, but he is always of unnatural shape); Alkyoneus is a giant. I do not say that this proves a non-Achaian origin, but it certainly is consistent with it. The purely Greek chthonians of whatever rank have little or nothing monstrous about them. Hades is as anthropomorphic as Zeus himself; Demeter and Kore are always, it would appear, thought of as having the shapes respectively of an older and a younger woman. Plutos, when he appears in art, has the form of a human child, and nothing in literature indicates that he was ever supposed to have a non-human semblance. The Erinyes with their hideous appearance and their snaky hair give themselves away by their names as not of true Greek stock. The Gorgon, whose first appearance is as a head without a body, a 226</page><page sequence="15">Chthonian cattle terror which Persephone can use on occasion to get rid of unwelcome visitors to her domain 33), has been with more or less plausibility connected with Oriental bogy-figures 34), and if she has a Greek etymology, which I rather doubt, she is another "roarer", despite the fact that it is her aspect, not her voice, which is fatal 35). Empusa with her fantastic taste in legs 36) is of the nursery, as are several of her spectral kin; i.e., she has a very good chance to be the product of nursemaids' fancies, and they would as often as not be foreigners, like good old Kilissa in the Choephoroe 37). In general, Greek taste was formed by the Homeric gentry, and they did not like monsters much, although they admitted an occasional one for a Herakles or a Perseus to meet and overcome. Next, as I have been trying to explain, it seems to me that the pastoral occupations of these strange beings are more reasonably accounted for on the supposition I have put forward than on any other that I have seen. For one thing, it gives a plain and simple reason why Geryon, who as we find him or can reconstruct him does not seem to own a gated castle or other abode and need a watchdog at the entrance (contrast Kerberos), nevertheless has a formidable hound. A cattle-owner pure and simple would of course have this use- ful servant and ally. So on the whole, I feel justified in using for the title of this paper the short phrase "Chthonian cattle". 33) Od. xi, 633-35. 34) References in NILSSON, Gesch. d. griech.
