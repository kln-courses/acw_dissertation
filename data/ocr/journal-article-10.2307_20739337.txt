Ofelia Zepeda's Power Poems: Poems from the Desert is a strong addition to "Sun Tracks?An American Indian Literary Series." An associate professor in the Linguistics Department at the University of Arizona, her poetry captures the incandescent relationship between water, weather and the Tohono O'odham people of "southern Arizona and northern Sonora, Mexico" (Zepeda 85). In the introduction, the author states "many of the pieces in this collection are about events around rain?rain in the desert and events that result" (4). "The best rains ... are the summer rains . . . also known as 'the monsoons.* These rains come in mid-July and last into August. This is the time of renewal for the O'odham" (87). Zepeda builds on this theme of cyclical renewal by extending it from the natural environment to the day-to-day, season-to-season existence of the Tohono O'odham as well as to herself as a modern day Tohono Native American woman, while "other [poems] are about people, my extended family and relatives" (4). The path to renewal and ultimately to growth in Zepeda's poems involves looking to the past to see how the cycles of daily life seasonal as well as climactic, familial as well as personal?cause one</page><page sequence="2">94 SAIL 8A (Spring 1996) to mature and shape the present and future. Memories move like the weather in Zepeda's cosmology; they "run into each other" (4) to create poetry which itself influences the memory, according to Zepeda (4). As she states succinctly and with insight: "I don't know why. It is just that way" (4). Life's cyclic patterns are integral to Native American literatures as expressed in the chant-like nature of tribal songs and the repetition of specific lines which have a hypnotic effect. "The regular occurrence of repetition creates a state of consciousness best described as 'ocean ic'" (Allen 11). Zepeda uses these characteristics in stunning and spellbinding ways as in "Ba:ban Ganhu Ge Ci:pia" (Zepeda 59-60): Coyotes moving along over there Coyotes moving along over there Someone go over there and ask them . . . Where are you guys moving to? . . . with baby's new tenny shoes And her Merle Haggard and Hank Williams tapes In the Basha's grocery bags (11. 8-10, 12, 17-20) The poem begins with the first six lines written in O'odham where the repetitive feel is experienced: Bu:ban ganhu ge ci:pia Bu:ban ganhu ge ci:pia Kut 'am hema medk 'am ha-kakk'e Kut 'am hema medk 'am ha-kakk'e Ba: mt o ci:pia? Kut 'am hema medk 'am ha-kakk'e Wa sa 'an wo:po son 'oidag (11. 1-7) This incremental repetition is subtle and involving, ensuring attention by using "variations" of a phrase. However, in Zepeda's cosmology, the universe is a neat juxtaposition of the past as expertly shown by her repetition of chants indicating the interaction between the narrator and the coyote and their coexistence within a modern world of tennis shoes, country western albums and "cowboy boots . . . / All worldly goods / Packed up" (11. 21-23). The flow between the natural and man-made, spiritual and materialistic as well as the anthropomorphic and literal is encapsulated adroitly here, reinforcing the oceanic theme Zepeda wishes to explore in this volume. In "Black Clouds" (20), the repetition in the lines "Like black buzzards, flying, far away" (1. 2) and "Like black buzzards, flying, so far away" (1. 6) is a fine example of how variation in a phrase can insure the reader's attention. The addition of so to the sixth line intensifies the nuance of the buzzard's flight. Ever so slight variations in the rhythm, meter or tempo of a line (musical or poetic) intrigues the</page><page sequence="3">-REVIEWS 95 mind and the reader participates with the poetry on a much more mentally active level since "participation [in a ceremony] is a matter of attention" and "not of [physical] activity" (Allen 12). Zepeda uses accessible imagery to involve the reader in "Black Clouds" as well: Black clouds drifting off in the distance. like black buzzards, flying, so far away. Rumbling, thundering. Slowly they descend. (11. 4-8) Sparse, everyday language adds to the poem's ominous nature: the ironic interplay and stark opposition between the clouds (life) and the buzzards (death). This Shakespearean-like ironic collision is neatly drawn to a whole in the last line: "Slowly they descend," where life and death (rain and the buzzards) touch the earth simultaneously and the encapsulation of the passage from birth to death (buzzard) is compressed expertly into three words. Zepeda's poems also evoke a chant-like incantatory nature that "serves to hold the society together, create harmony, restore balance, ensure prosperity, and unity and establish right relations within the social and natural world," to borrow from Paula Gunn Allen's definition of ceremonial (including chant) literature (19). In her afterword, Zepeda indicates man and nature work harmoniously "to establish right relations" (Allen 19) when Zepeda states O'odham dancing "is quiet barefoot skipping and shuffling on dry dirt movements that cause dirt to rise quickly toward the atmosphere, dust that people believe helps to form rain clouds" (89). Human beings influence nature, and nature responds to influence humankind. This point is exemplified in "Kaxim Su:dagi" (81-82), with its chant-like, prayer-like feel: Red-colored blossoms Green-colored blossoms Purple-colored blossoms All float above the laying water . . . Toward it we extend kinship We touched this laying water and then we left it alone (II. 10-13, 16-18) These lines illustrate the rhythm and incantatory nature of the poem, reinforcing the idea that people and nature are inextricably tied together and one's "kinship" with water is a respectful one where one treats water with reverence and does not exploit it needlessly. This mutual blessing is shown by the blossoms floating or being supported by a body of water which sustains them: a river, lake or ocean. Human</page><page sequence="4">96 SAIL 8.1 (Spring 1996) beings depend (float) on rainfall to survive so "Toward it we extend only good thoughts / Toward it we extend only good feelings / Toward it we extend kinship" (11. 14-16), so the rain will reciprocate and extend its goodness toward humankind. In "Cewagi" (26) the chant-like nature of certain lines blends with the repetition of specific words to give the piece a building tension, between the stillness of clouds, their gathering strength, and their final explosion in peels of thunder which hopefully portend a bountiful rain: Summer clouds sit silently. They sit, quietly gathering strength. Gathering strength from the good winds. This strength that becomes the thunder. The thunder so loud it vibrates the earth. The thunder that surrounds us. (II. 8-13) Each successive line is linked to the preceding and subsequent line by words or phrases showing the incremental link between the collection of clouds and the storm that ultimately follows. For example, the word "strength" links lines nine, ten and eleven, showing the growing power of the approaching storm. The word "thunder" in the last three lines is interlinked to show its growth (line 11) to its cacophonous manifesta tions and physical shakings of the ground (line 12) to its engulfing of people caught at the moment the thunderstorm comes to life. The incantatory tenor of the poem again shows the ties between humanity and nature and how "right relations within the social and natural world" (Allen 19) form the O'odham universe: "The thunder that surrounds us" (1. 13). Thunder brings rain, rain brings life to the desert and allows the O'odham to live in this environment. "Na:nko Ma:s Cewagi (Cloud Song)" (15) is another example of how the repetition of words in successive lines relates to the growing power of an approaching rainstorm: Greenly they emerge. In colors of blue they emerge. Whitely they emerge. In colors of black they are coming. Reddening, they are right here. (11. 5-9) The approaching storm clouds "progress towards" the reader as the poem develops and engulfs her or him in the last line, since "they are right here" (1. 9). Zepeda's use of "Greenly" and "Whitely" gathers our attention because of the odd adverbial structure of the words. These invented forms are intriguing and unusual, much as rain in the desert would be to the O'odham, whose "making rain [is called] 'fixing the earth'" (Zepeda 88) which "breaks the tension for the desert. Relief. Cycles [life] continues" (4).</page><page sequence="5">-REVIEWS 97 By using these created forms, Zepeda has shown the importance rain plays in O'odham tribal life: its rare appearance and how the search to capture and control this sporadic occurrence makes us look at the universe in unique ways. Zepeda also explores the role her "extended family and relatives" (4) played in influencing her growth into the person she has become: "those right relations within the social world" (Allen 19). In these poems we observe how Zepeda's environment has helped mold those individuals and the poet into iconoclastic personalities through the daily experiences they have gone through, as in "Hot Tortillas" (46-7): where "the air temperature is 115 outside, / inside her kitchen this heat is magnified by a wood-burning stove" (11. 2-3). The intense heat does not deter the woman who "throws the spherical, airlike dough back and forth. / Dough, paper-thin and perfectly shaped. / They say a measure of a good tortilla maker is if you can read a newspaper through it" (11. 9-11). The special blend of personal talent and environmental circum stances has coalesced to produce a rare combination: the perfect atmosphere to produce the perfect tortilla. This specific moment is admired by onlookers in a reverent way since, "Most of us know better than to disturb her" (1. 19). The mixture of unique environment and individual industry is to be respected, according to Zepeda, as "the right relations within the natural and social world" (Allen 19). An excellent example of "right relations" between natural elements and one's personal environment is captured in Zepeda's "Moon Games" (73-74). Here the link between moon and woman is drawn with an expert hand: "At night my daughter and I sleep well, / oblivious to the games going on outside our tent. / Our bodies in comfortable rhythm with the movements of oceans and moons" (11. 4-6). The peaceful co existence of women and lunar tidal rhythms is brilliantly and ironically mirrored in the actions of the narrator's restless husband who "... turns in his sleep at every thundering crash of wave. / The noise is deafening to him" (11. 14-15), indicative of the male's alienation from the physical world's cyclical nature. The point is driven home in the poem's concluding lines where "In the morning he asks, 'Did you hear the ocean last night?' / He'd say 'I got up and looked at it to see what was wrong*" (11. 17-18). The husband is the one out of sync with the ocean. He is not in harmony or in "right relations" with the natural environment: the same ocean that lulls and rocks his daughter and wife "like babies" (1. 12). The last major motif Zepeda explores concerns the mystic reverence of Native American women toward their unshorn hair as developed over a "suite" of five poems: " Her Hair is Her Dress," "Hair Stolen," "Don't Be Like The Enemy," "Long Hair," and "Hair</page><page sequence="6">98 SAIL 8.1 (Spring 1996) pins." These five pieces center primarily on a woman's relationship with her hair and how "Long Hair" (38) is seen and viewed by those of this world and those in the afterworld: On the other side they sing and dance in celebration. When we get there our hair must be long so that they can recognize us. Our hair is our dress. It is our adornment. (11. 1-4) This piece succinctly captures how the length of one's hair is a badge of identification for one who belongs to a particular group of people? the O'odham. It is their heritage and must be "long so they [our ancestors] recognize us" (II. 2 and 5). If the hair is cut, as in "Hair Stolen" (36), victims are doomed or exempted from joining their ancestors on the other side since they have to "search the ashes for their hair when they leave this earth" (1. 10). They then lose their ability to become "one with the universe" (Allen 11). The principles that tie O'odham society together, to "create harmony, ensure prosperity and unity" (19), will literally be severed or cut, with the shorn individual forced into a netherworld of searching and lamentation. This fear is again addressed in "Her Hair is Her Dress" (34-35) where a woman over a hundred years old has saved her hair all her life since she doesn't want to be, " . . . scratching through the ashes looking for" (1.4) it after she dies. She wants to be in "right relations" with both the spiritual and natural worlds (Allen 19). Her hair is her insurance she will be allowed into the world on the other side. In "Don't be like the Enemy" (37), the way hair is worn identifies one as being O'odham. If one's hair covers one's face, one will be like one's adversary, since untied hair makes one "like a savage" (1. 2). The face should be uncovered so the enemy can "know the light in your [the O'odham person's] eyes. / But don't stare. / Cover your face by lowering it slightly" (11. 3-5). Zepeda wonderfully captures the pride of her people and how they understandably react to their adver sary/oppressor with a spark of defiance, perhaps, but with an invulner ability that bends but does not break: an inheritance and result of their perilous life on the hard, serene and rain-dependent desert. I have some problems with Zepeda's volume, albeit on a more philosophical, academic level. One of the poems, "Kots," is written entirely in Tohono O'odham with no English translation following the original, as Zepeda has done with all her other poems where O'odham is presented first and is then followed by the English equivalent as in "Na:nko Ma:s Cewagi (Cloud Song)," "Cewagi," "Bu:ban Ganhu Ge Ci:pia," and "Kaxim Su:dagi." Zepeda defends the lack of an English</page><page sequence="7">-REVIEWS 99 translation for "Kots" by stating some of her pieces are designed "for the small but growing number of O'odham speakers who are becoming literate in their native language. Here, then, is a little bit of O'odham literature for them to read" (4). The exclusionary nature of "Kots" has great political clout, a sly commentary on Native American/Anglo relations with many far reaching ramifications, but on the poetic level, the lack of translation runs counter to the purpose of poetry as I see it?a means of communi cation to bridge gaps between cultures. "Kots" separates the potential readers into two categories, O'odham or non-O'odham, and thus reduces the universality of the poem to a panache or occasional piece. In her afterword, Zepeda takes a slightly pedantic, directive attitude toward her audience. I find this slightly bothersome since in several instances Zepeda offers interpretations of her work: "'The Floods of 1993 and Others' [which] is the story of a harsh winter that flooded the desert" (87). These directives are inappropriate in a book of poems where each piece should be allowed to stand on its own. The reader should form his or her own interpretation so each piece has relevancy?so it interacts with the reader on the reader's own level and allows him or her to "read in" or react to the poem so he or she gets as personalized a message as possible within the parameters the poem establishes. As I see it, in her afterword, Zepeda tries to dictate how one should view some of her poems; she does not show, without editorializ ing, a universal situation one can relate to on one's own. She has reversed the old adage "show, don't tell" in her academically informa tive and overall interesting afterword. I applaud her desire to introduce "readers not familiar with the Southwest tribe of people who call themselves Tohono O'odham, or Desert People" (85), the tribe "formerly known as the Papago"(85) and to supply "references for those interested readers who want further information" (85). But I feel this should be done in a separate scholarly book or article on the relationship of the O'odham to the environment, especially rain, and the poetry the rain inspires. Poetry should educate subtly; academic discourse should teach directly. Zepeda's need to serve both masters in Ocean Power makes her restrict the range of possible interpretations of the three poems noted above. This is too intrusive and controlling for the reader and should be left to textbooks, critical studies, scholarly articles, etc. but not through an original book of poems where the interplay between text and reader is based on his or her own experiences. Ofelia Zepeda's Ocean Power: Poems for the Desert is a strong group of poems. Zepeda explores the inter-relationship of humans and nature, the O'odham and the Southwest desert, individual and group.</page><page sequence="8">100 SAIL 8.1 (Spring 1996) This is done with perception and cleverness. Her work reminds me of Gary Soto, Simon Ortiz, Pat Mora, and Paula Gunn Allen at their best. In "One-sided Conversation" (53) Zepeda states we and she "talk twice as much, / with a hope that we may capture the whole" (11. 5-6). Her work encapsulates the essence of a people's experience showing how their lives are inter-dependent on weather, culture and the self. She is an innovative poet and let us hope, as she puts it, she continues to grow and will "go about my [her] business, / carrying the morning air ("Morning Air" 65, 11. 4-6).
