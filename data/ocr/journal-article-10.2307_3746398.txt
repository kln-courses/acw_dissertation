<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHILOSOPHY "there is no valid inference from mere possibility to matter of fact." Hence when Descartes has to deal not with abstract mathematics but with actual phenomena his method is bound to break down. This seems to me a wrong description of Descartes' procedure. There is only one place in his whole system in which he infers the actual from the possible-the ontological argument. The foundation of his metaphysics is not the possible but the actual existence of the self, from which he proceeds to the actual existence of God, and thence, by a circuitous route, to the actual existence of bodies. Thus in his Physics he presupposes not merely the concep- tion of a possible extended world, but an actual extended world, and he assumes that, because its essence is extension, so that nothing can exist in it except the modes of extension, it must lend itself to mathematical treatment. In particular, the only process which is possible in it is motion according to certain laws. These are the assumptions with which Descartes' Physics starts. But unfortunately he does not regard them as assumptions. They are for him established by metaphysical argument, not taken as hypotheses to be verified or modified or rejected. It is, I suggest, this metaphysical background which gives to Descartes' procedure in Physics its peculiarly a priori charac- ter, rather than any attempt to deduce the actual from the possible. Descartes in his Physics always tries to explain actual phenomena by actual causal conditions. It is true that in the earlier stages of this explanation he delibe- rately dispenses with special observations and experiments. He does so on the ground that the general principles from which he starts enable him to deduce a priori the most general characters of the phenomena of nature. (And this would be legitimate if the principles themselves were treated as hypo- theses.) But when he has to explain particular occurrences (e.g. the behaviour of magnets) or to solve a particular practical problem (e.g. the construction of a certain type of lens), then observation and experiment (one of which, incidentally, must set the special problem to begin with) are necessary to enable him to reject all but the relevant hypothesis out of a number equally compatible with his general principles. For what follows not from the general nature of the principles but from the special circumstances under which they work cannot be deduced a priori from them. Descartes rightly recognizes this, nor is the recognition inconsistent with the rest of his method. Where he went wrong was in supposing that if only he had the means and the time for adequate experiment he could make a great advance himself. Whether or not I am right on this question as against Professor Roth makes little difference to the undoubted interest of his book. In particular, the general reader will find the chapters comparing Descartes with Bacon and with Pascal, and the account of Father Daniel's satire, the Voyage du Monde, which is used to play an ingenious part in the argument of the book, excellent reading. I found two misprints. On page 29, last line of text, for "if" read "as" or "as if"; on page 94 the reference to Descartes' reply to Morin should be to vol. ii, not vol. iii. A. K. STOUT. Symbolism and Belief. By EDWYN BEVAN. (London: George Allen &amp; Unwin, Ltd. 1938. Pp. 39I. Price I5s.) A Gifford Lecturer has two difficulties to confront. So many courses have already been given, that it must be difficult to find a new approach to, or treatment of, the subject prescribed, and the condition that reason, and not 490</page><page sequence="2">NEW BOOKS revelation, must be set forth as the ground for belief must make it difficult for one who accepts the Christian revelation to keep within the limits im- posed. The author of this volume has overcome the first difficulty, as he does offer a fresh contribution; and the second he meets by offering the Christian solution of any problem not on the basis of the authority of Bible or Church, but as itself reasonable. It need hardly be said that this course of Gifford Lectures presents all,the excellences that one has learned to expect from any writings of the author-adequate and accurate knowledge, competent and balanced judgment, and lucid and attractive style. The Introduction indicates the purpose-to show the part played by symbolism in belief. The author distinguishes symbols, which are visible objects or sounds which stand for something of which we already have direct knowledge, "such as flags or trumpets," from symbols which "purport to give information about the things which they symbolize, to convey know- ledge of their nature, which those who see or hear the symbols have not had before or have not otherwise." For the first kind resemblance is not necessary, as for the second, which seek to convey by the known knowledge of the otherwise unknown (pp. II-I3). In religion both kinds of symbols have a place. All our conceptions of God are inadequate symbols; but this truth has not always been recognized as history shows. The symbols give some knowledge of God, though not the whole; and there must be discrimina- tions in deciding how far the symbol can be regarded as resembling or not resembling the object. Our thought of God must be anthropomorphic, but there is a true and a false anthropomorphism. Nine lectures are devoted to the discussion of symbols, and six to "the relations of symbolism to truth and belief." The first symbol is taken from Space-Height as indicating God's trans- cendence, His superiority to all things. In the third lecture the author discusses reasons why height should be thus regarded. In dealing with the symbol from Time, he is handling one of the subjects of constant debate in philosophy, the relation of Time and Eternity; and he seems to me rightly to maintain that time must have some significance for God. One of the most generally diffused symbols for God is Light: and in the Christian revelation that symbol is freely used. It expresses not only intellectual quality, but perfection gener- ally. The word Spirit has come to be so identified with the conception of God as incorporeal, immaterial, personal, that we are ready to forget that it, too, is a symbol. Its primary meaning is wind, breath, and so life. In the Old and the New Testament alike there is the tendency to distinguish soul as man's life, and spirit as God's, and man's only as dependent on God. Paul's dis- tinction between the psychical and the pneumatic man is a notable illus- tration. Here the symbol seems to convey more of the reality than do the others. What at first sight might appear a digression but which is fully justified is found in the two lectures on The Wrath of God. We are here warned against the false anthropomorphism: the human passions, resentment, vindictiveness, revenge must be eliminated from the symbol; but the true anthropomorphism allows us to work out an analogy between the human moral judgment re- garding desert and punishment. While I am in substantial agreement with the author's conclusions, I must confess I should have welcomed more stress on God's grace. These nineteen lectures belong to what we may call the comparative study of religions, the five which follow to the philosophy of religion, or we might even say, the epistemology. The eleventh lecture shows how early religious thought took literally what is now taken symbolically; and yet insists that not all the Scripture record, 491</page><page sequence="3">PHILOSOPHY especially the New Testament, can be regarded thus; for Christian faith affirms not only that Jesus was historically real, but that He is still present and active in the souls of men. The next lecture treats symbols without conceptual meaning. There are three main kinds of emotion called forth in this way by visible objects-the feeling of the beautiful, the sexual feeling, and the germinal feeling of religious awe (pp. 275-6). Interesting as is the discussion here, it need not be followed in detail. The four lectures following are a progressive consideration of the grounds on which belief in the reality corresponding to the symbol may be based. Recognizing that the pragmatic theory may serve a useful purpose in man's dealings with inanimate nature, and is indeed derived therefrom, it is held to fall through in personal relations with man or God. In the one case we are concerned with results, in the other with the personal reality. When the personal relation is love, as in Christianity, pragmatism is unsatisfying. That we cannot know God as we can know our fellow-men, however, must be admitted. Can analogy lead us from the one to the other? How much truth can that yield? Less probably than medieval theology claimed, even although that same theology also recognized that even thus God cannot be fully known. A lecture is devoted to discuss Dean Mansle as representing the agnostic tendency in Anglican theology, though modified by his insistence on the authority of the revelation of God in the Holy Scriptures. The values of Mysticism and Rationalism are next considered as approaches to the divine reality. While appreciating the testimony of the mystics to the reality of God, the author holds that there must be besides "some ground in our apprehensivess of things." His judgment on Rationalism is negative: "No cogent rational inference can be made from the world to what is outside it" (p. 363). The justification for Belief is shown in the last lecture to lie in acceptance of, and loyalty to, human values, in rejecting the hypotheses that the world around man is indifferent to values, and in making the venture of faith, which will find its verification, that God cares for these values. Such a justification can be offered in relief of doubt; but the last ground of belief is this: "What actually causes anyone to believe in God is direct perception of the Divine." This bare outline may, I hope, whet the appetite of the reader to seek for himself the "feast of fat things" provided in the volume. . A. E. GARVIE. The Principles of Art. By R. G. COLLINGWOOD. (Oxford at the Clarendon Press; London: Humphrey Milford. I938. Pp. xi + 347. Price I5s.) This book, as I understand it, expounds without deviation Croce's theory that art is the expression of emotion. But it does expound it, and implements it with serious discussions of what is meant by emotion, imagination, expression, intuition, and by the identification of the last two, so that what had been a striking inspiration, summing up the vague hints of a hundred predecessors, becomes a reasoned creed. One can imagine the book written as a Platonic dialogue, with Croce as protagonist, often cornered, sometimes corrected, but fundamentally triumphant. Dr. I. A. Richards and Mr. Bernard Shaw would evidently have been cast for minor but picturesque parts. The epistemological lacunas in Croce are supplied by detailed consideration of Hume's distinction between impressions and ideas; of Kant's "blind but indispensable function of imagination" in perception; of modern doctrines of sensa; of psychological theories of unconscious emotions and their repression or release. 492</page></plain_text>
