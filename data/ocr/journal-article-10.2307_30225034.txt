<plain_text><page sequence="1">Narrative Sources and the Problem of Ulysses Shari Benstock and Bernard Benstock At its most basic, narrative is assumed to be comprised of two essential elements, a story and a storyteller. In its oral traditions, narrative rested with the bard who, by his voice and gestures, his nuances of tone and inflection, was inseparable from the story he told. He was recognizably apparent and perfectly audible in his narratives, a status that he frequently exploited for narrative effect. Our critical terminology derives from this oral tradition, despite the conventions of its current sophistication; the terms we use to define and describe narrative ("style," "tone," "point of view," "gesture," "plot," even such weighted terms as "discours," "recit," "signifier," "signified") draw our attention to the role of the teller in the tale. The most commonly used metaphor characterizing that which we read upon a page is "narrative voice": in narrative a speaker speaks to us, hidden though he may be by the person and tense of the narration; he speaks harshly or humorously, in a particular tone, from a particular point of view, in a certain style. He is present in his person ("Let us go then, you and I") or hidden behind a certain impersonality ("Hale knew they meant to murder him before he had been in Brighton three hours"), assumes a limited vision ("On an evening in the latter part of May, a middle-aged man was walking homeward from Shaston to the village of Marlott") or a more expansive one ("In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth"). Indeed, the teller can fix himself in the corner of a character's mind ("Sitting beside the road, watching the wagon mount the hill toward her, Lena thinks, 'I have come from Alabama: a fur piece' ") or disappear into the local atmosphere ("London. Michaelmas Term late over, and the Lord Chancellor sitting in Loncoln's Inn Hall"). Whatever its scope and style, the process of narration establishes the notion of an ever-present someone whose voice guides our readingjust as it once guided our listening in the "once upon a time." The illusion of a voice "heard" in the silent writing on the page is con- firmed and carried on by the critical terminology applied to narration. This</page><page sequence="2">Narrative Sources and the Problem of Ulysses 25 metaphorical "voice" is actively present in our critical vocabulary, reinforcing the assumption that even the most impersonal texts are not generated ex nihilo but are the work of a human, work that rests on the conventions of communication between like beings: between a teller and listener, between a writer and reader. No matter how sophisticated or complicated our terminology becomes, whether we speak of author and reader or acknowledge an implied author and an implied reader, whether we focus on the act of writing or the act of reading, we still invest narrative with a human dimension apparent in the voice of the text: "Lily, the caretaker's daughter, was literally run off her feet."' As long as we are aware of the metaphoric basis of our descriptive terms, perhaps we can escape the trap open to all listeners present at a storytelling- mishearing. Who said Lily was literally run off her feet? Hugh Kenner has told us that were she to describe how she felt, Lily herself would say that she was literally run off her feet. And how do we know that this particular expression might belong to Lily and not her maker (or his stand-in, the narrator)? Because we extrapolate what Lily might have said, what turn of phrase might be hers in this instance, from what she does say. Her own true voice is inserted in impersonal, third-person narration. This discovery is, of course, of longer standing than Hugh Kenner's reading of Dubliners, belonging to a tradition of narrative analysis defined at the turn, of the century in Europe.2 While the French term le style indirect libre and the German erlebte Rede contrast significantly different narrative techniques, in essence they acknowledge the possibility of a narration inflected from directions other than those determined by the narrator (even an omniscient one); of a narration which assumes its own directions, seemingly separate from, even contradictory to, that imposed by the teller; of a subject which can insert itself into the fabric of the telling, warping the fictional woof. Once this happens (and it happened very early, with clear signs of its appearance in the 18th- and 19th-century novel),3 the metaphoric distinctions of "narrator" and "narrative" blur. At every turn it is possible for a third-rank character, like Lily the caretaker's daughter who does housework, to shape the narrative in ways that even the most vigilant narrator or sharp-eared reader may find perplexing. At this point the metaphoric overtones of our critical vocabulary can no longer be ignored. The mingling of voices is difficult for the astute listener to dissolve; the blurred perspective produces optical illusions. And while it may sometimes be apparent that the "voice" which intrudes upon a line of narrative prose belongs to a Lily or to Uncle Charles, frequently the source of disruption is not so evident. In some texts, like Ulysses, the disruption occurs before the listener has a chance to identify any "initial" narrator; often the disruptions play upon the style in ways that are not attributable to characters, but belong to physical or abstract processes: peristaltic action, the senses, birth, death, music, rocks, epic poetry or catechism. The possibility that one voice subsumes all voices in Ulysses, directing all stylistic and linguistic permutations, becomes conceptually difficult to manage. After all, narrators (even unreliable ones) are known by their consistencies, and here is a narrative</page><page sequence="3">26 The Journal of Narrative Technique which seems to rest on inconsistency. The history of Ulysses criticism reflects these changing perspectives in the rhetoric of its commentary. By the mid-1960s, critical interest in Ulysses began to shift from an emphasis on its thematic elements to a concern for its narrative mechanics. How does Ulysses mean? The critical metaphors began to change: not just one narrator but many, with a supporting "arranger" (to add musical/ dramatic dimensions), gave credence to the notion that the text was divided against itself. The textual capacity for anticipation, repetition, inflation, deflation, mockery, sympathy, irony, and comedy were seen as efforts to harness a subject that always threatened to wrench the story away from its teller and proceed tout-seul, directionless and aberrant.4 By the 1970s subject had become completely separated from style (indeed, pitted against stylistic innovation); teller was divorced from tale, and the widening narrative gap was filled by various personae with pernicious motives.5 By 1980 the dualistic concept on which narrative theory rests (parole vs. langue, signifier vs. signified, deep structure vs. surface manifestation) is a given; the old terms of subject and style, method and matter, story and substance have been re- placed by the terms of la nouvelle critique: histoire and discours. The thrust for generating new terms (and French terms) owes much to recent develop- ments in linguistic theory and the structuralist poetics. Whereas it was once possible to speak of "theme," "metaphor," and "symbol," nothing could be more passe' now. Those interested in the thematic elements of Ulysses- whether Bloom and Stephen celebrate some kind of communion over cocoa, whether Molly is a patient Griselda or a lusty Wife of Bath figure, whether or not Bloom is "really" a Jew, are showing their age. All the bright young people, many of them European and trained in the rhetoric of Lacan, Der- rida, Foucault, of Tel Quel or Change, are persistently pointing out to us where it's at: in the narrative theory that supports so seminal a modernist text as Ulysses. To refresh our memories, we must recall that for the overwhelming number of readers of Ulysses the first six chapters are now (and always have been) of a piece, consistent in their narrative method, variations on a traditional third- person mode of storytelling, and, by comparison with later chapters, only marginally difficult. It is with the seventh chapter, "Aeolus," that the text divides against itself, Joyce's notes on the novel telling us that the insertion of the intrusive headlines occurred very late in the game, after the stylistic excesses of the later chapters had carried away the narrative subject with which the novel began. Karen Lawrence's recent article in the James Joyce Quarterly (" 'Aeolus': Interruption and Inventory") focuses on these distinc- tions, and exemplifies some current thinking about the Ulyssean narrative. She writes: In confronting these seemingly arbitrary interruptions in the text [the headlines], the reader has a number of choices. Because the narration of the story continues beneath the headings, he can try to ignore the intrusions, and proceed, however limpingly, through the chapter to 'Lestrygonians.' For as bizarre as the headings may be, the texture of the</page><page sequence="4">Narrative Sources and the Problem of Ulysses 27 narrative beneath them is largely that of the first six chapters: a combination of dialogue, interior monologue and third-person narration.6 The theoretical underpinnings of this analysis are evident in these opening sentences: the headlines introduce a new and bizarre element into the smooth progression of narration; they create a "dual text" (upper-case headlines vs. lower-case narration); the headlines are significantly different from the narration of the previous six chapters, which is continued in the narrative beneath them. What is the reader to do? In order to read the seventh chapter in a way similar to the first six, the reader must perform a different operation on the text, an act, in this case, of supression. He must pretend that stitching together the micro- narrative is the same as reading an uninterrupted version of the story. (390) The text becomes something upon which the reader performs an act, an operation. And the change of text in "Aeolus" constitutes the necessity for a concomitant change in the reading process; we don't read "Aeolus" like we read "Nestor." So how do we define what has happened in "Aeolus"? In "Aeolus" the book begins to advertise its own artifice, and in doing so, it calls attention to the processes of reading and writing. For the headings not only provide a puzzle to the reader, but also are a sign of a new kind of writing in the book, which undermines the norms established in the first six chapters. (391) This assessment defines the crux of the new narratology. The emphasis is upon the visual elements of the text, what it looks like on the page; in "Aeolus" the text announces, by its typeface, something new. It disrupts the temporal design it has established, it creates a "visual disturbance," it emphasizes the printed quality of the text, thus playing "with the distance between written language and oral narrative" (393); most significant, these intrusions seem to come unbidden from any narrative personae, they suggest a process of estrangement from the consciousness to which they are aligned, they emphasize a disturbing notion, that the process of writing (as opposed to narrating) may actually separate the creation from its creator. As Karen Lawrence writes, "the book now seems cut off from the notion of human origin" (394). To note briefly one important shift that our critical vocabulary has made in delineating the narrative argument: its metaphors have changed. What began as a concept of "hearing" words on a page, imagining a speaker speaking in that third-person of the first six chapters of Ulysses, of supposing a storyteller who by the force of his words and the inflection of his voice bids our attention and participation, we have arrived at "Aeolus," which emphasizes its "printedness," which bids us pay attention to the words as they appear on the page (in caps, abbreviated, punctuated) and which makes us feel that this</page><page sequence="5">28 The Journal of Narrative Technique narrative and its imbedded story have been cut off from human sources, springing from unaccountable regions. The narrative of this chapter belongs to "a language of common denominator, the received and receivable ideas of society, so different from the language of the initial style" (396); in fact, this language is totally divorced from the speech acts of an individual person. Wordplay now exists in visible terms ("K.M.R.I.A."), and the rhetorical devices of the chapter only further this emphasis upon the visible, shifting our attention to the shape and placement of words on a page rather than to their content. But whether the metaphor is hearing or seeing, all things have conspired to our recognition of the division of things. We seem to have rearrived at the old chestnut of form-versus-content. At the risk of appearing too demode'and shopworn, we should like to return to that question of sources, of narrative impetus, and to pause at the assertion that "Aeolus" represents a schism in the text, a separation of the initial style from the later styles, shifting our attention from a personalized, idiosyncratic narration. We should like to look again at the narrator. In order for a "narrator" to exist in the text, he must be present in his person. In reality, this leaves only the choice of first-person narration ("I"), since second-person narration is almost unknown and third-person narration suggests in both its person and syntactical structure the absence of a present, personalized someone who tells us the story. The usual manner of past-tense narration furthers this anonymity, displacing the subject in time ("Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead"), but third-person present- tense narration, although highly unusual, achieves the same effect ("On the verandah, Franck drops into one of the low armchairs and utters his usual exclamation as to how comfortable they are"). The constraints upon third-person narration, which range from "omniscience" to the focused observation of Robbe-Grillet, depend in no way upon an anthropomorphic conception. Such terms as "camera eye," "central intelligence," or "omniscient narrator" belie the impersonality of the narration they try to describe by associating aspects of humanness to the realm of the impersonal. Indeed, the term "omniscient narrator" is in itself a contradiction in terms, since no "narrator" (if we assume the metaphoric elements of humanness, a "he" who "tells" a story) is capable of "omniscience." The willing suspension of disbelief is required when terms strain metaphoric limits. And it is precisely belief, and our striving for it, which has produced the critical notion of "reliability," most often in the services of the narrator. He is either reliable or unreliable. Reliability is something we place great value in, since it guarantees our safe journey through the fictional world. Like Little Red Riding Hood, we need to know when the wolf is hiding in the narrative woods-and where he is. It is often assumed that reliability is a function of the type of narration that has been chosen for a given fiction: that it is, perhaps, easier to identify unreliability in The Turn of the Screw, because there are two first-person narrators whose motives we are able to assess, than to define the motives of a vague, slippery, third-person narrator able to evade our efforts in</page><page sequence="6">Narrative Sources and the Problem of Ulysses 29 Ulysses. Indeed, criticism of both of these works should quickly tell us that no one is quite certain of the whereabouts of the unreliability in The Turn of the Screw and many feel perfect confidence in the verbal trickster who manipulates Ulysses. But any method of narration holds the possibility for unreliability because all narration is unreliable. We never get the whole story, from every possible angle, and we are never allowed to see (or hear) the choices that were dis- carded in order that this particular storytelling could advance itself. We can talk about degrees of unreliability, but we cannot distinguish between a fic- tion which is reliable and one which is not. It is noteworthy that criticism of modernist fiction has tended to emphasize the unreliability of its narration, or its characters' accounts, in large part because modernism is characterized by the turning over of the narrative controls to the thoughts and reactions of its characters. How do we assess the trustworthiness of a Stephan Dedalus or a Clarissa Dalloway? Many would say that we measure the distance between a character's consciousness and external reality by assuming a narrator who presents the external reality reliably. This is an act of faith, rather like turning over the reins of one's conscious decision-making to an invisible God whose reliability (that is, good will) we trust. This may make for exemplary religious practice, but it makes for poor literary criticism. And if not God, then who? the author? Joyce himself made the claim that if Dublin were to be destroyed it could be resurrected from his text. But which Dublin, exactly, could be resurrected? Certainly not the Dublin of June 16, 1904, since our awareness of certain anachronistic discrepancies in the text- based on evidence outside the text-tells us that between 1904 and 1915, when Joyce began Ulysses, history intervened in remarkable ways. Perhaps, then, one must assume that the work itself presents a certain "reality," consistent in its effort to render the city in as many forms and from as many perspectives as possible, and it is to that reality the reader must apply in an effort to distinguish the personal subjectivity of characters' impressions from the models of physical phenomena present elsewhere in the text. But most readers feel shy about taking this sort of responsibility with a text as playful as Ulysses and would rather insert into its workings a narrator upon whom the reader's subjective responses to the text may be affixed. Narrative point-of-view and tone, terms which associate themselves with a present, on-scene narrator, recognizable as a someone in the story, are applicable to the impersonal method of narration only if they are dissociated from a human context. The importance of narrational viewpoint is splendidly demonstrated in "Cyclops," where the prejudice of the "eye" rests in the "I" of the telling. That a similar prejudice exists in such a chapter as "Sirens," where the musical forms seem to mock Bloom, or in "Aeolus," where the headlines appear to parody the narration which follows, suggests serious implications for a reading of the text if we say that such mockery/parody resides in the viewpoint of the narrator.7 We suggest that such measures of tone and perspective as irony, parody, sympathy, and so forth, establish themselves in ways totally separate from the notion of a personalized narrator who hides</page><page sequence="7">30 The Journal of Narrative Technique himself behind the mask of impersonality. The impression that the narration itself assumes a "voice" with a timbre we can measure and a tone which is distinctive undercuts the method of impersonal narration. We search for metaphors to describe this stylistic phenomenon. The term "narrative voice," often used as a substitute for "narrator" when narrational terrain seems ambiguous, exists at different levels in a fictional text and serves a variety of metaphorical functions. The most obvious of these is dialogue (characters' speech acts); the second is narrative voice (when there is a first-person present narrator); the third is authorial voice (when the author's presence is manifestly apparent in the text, such as in Tom Jones). Another whole set of possible voices exists in another narrative context-perhaps best termed "textual" representation-and in- cludes such textual markets as quotation marks, the tirez, italics, or run-on sentences which denote thought process (as in "Penelope"), and a whole panoply of other techniques designed to produce the visual effect on the page of speech or thought processes which are then internally voiced by the speaker.8 These textual effects and their mimetic counterparts work together to produce the illusion that speech acts occur in written narrative. They do not. The notion of present speech in a novel is a supposition, and one that we have lived comfortably with for a long period of time. But it is also one which has led to critical misunderstandings about the nature and role of critical language.9 To argue, as one critic of Ulysses does, that the narrator of "Aeolus" "thumbs his nose at" the reader, or (in another critical vision) "with a certain eye for the malaprops, pastes captions across the page through the text of this episode,"10 is to suggest that this third-person narrator is somehow palpably present, with a nose to thumb and a paste-pot to wield. Our critical language is not innocent; it has the capacity to mislead by its verbal resonances and visual effects. And whereas it might seem possible to adopt such terms as "narrator" or "narrative voice" with the stipulation that we all keep firmly in mind that these terms, like "implied author" or "plot line," rest on metaphoric assumptions, that they are always used in quotation marks, that we can delineate for our various purposes the precise meaning that the term "narrator" shall hold in the numerous cases where we apply it, none of this is really possible. Because there is always someone who will take that metaphor out of the realm of the poetic and into the realm of everyday reality, who will give the narrator a nose and a thumb and an eye for the malapropos, who, like Lily the caretaker's daughter, will insist on the literalness of that conception. How is it possible, then, to sort out the complexities of fictional language and critical language, how to describe the multiplexities of a text like Ulys- ses? Typically, the answer to this plight has been to redefine critical terms which have been in use over hundreds of years," to make them fit present needs by qualifying and categorizing, so that one gets conglomerate termi- nology like "third-person limited narration," "selective omniscience," "self-narrated monologue." The alternative is to create new critical terms</page><page sequence="8">Narrative Sources and the Problem of Ulysses 31 ("dissonant self-narration" or "subject of enunciation").'2 Behind both of these efforts is a nagging doubt about the language which attempts to describe the fictional representation. Thus if the term narrator can't suffice to describe all of what narrationally occurs in Ulysses, then we must redefine that narrator's duties or recast his capabilities as an "arranger," "stagemanager," or "interpolator." We suggest that such methods won't solve the problem, since the problem is a conceptual one. By whatever name we call the narrator, he is still always functioning according to terms delineated by the term "narrator" itself. Adding to his duties, duplicating his job description, giving him a larger staff of helpers and manipulators hardly solves the problem. Moreover, the more power the narrator gains in the creation of the text, the more authority he assumes, the less unity is perceivable between the subject of the text and style: they commence in concurrence in the first six chapters, begin to divide in the seventh, and by the seventeenth are totally divided against each other. Only "Penelope," it seems, is capable of reweaving subject with style in a totally convincing production. We propose, therefore, an alternate conception. Fictional texts which exploit style indirect libre (the narrational mode most common to Ulysses) establish the contextual supremacy of subject matter to influence the direction, tone, pace, point of view, and method of narration. Examples of this technique at work will follow below, but it is important to understand that what is at stake here is not a kind of "which came first, the chicken or the egg?" riddle, a notion that can be documented by slavish attention to notesheets and early drafts, but a method for establishing, within the confines of the textual narration, the sources of its telling. Hugh Kenner's "Uncle Charles Principle," which gives characters the power to influence the narration which describes them, is adequate, within its limits. Certainly characters influence the direction of narration in Joyce's works, as they do (and have done) in dozens of novels far less experimental in their narrative devices than Ulysses. What the "Uncle Charles Principle" lacks is the capacity for extending narrative influences to include inanimate, mechanical, spontaneous, even organic processes. Such items as cakes of soap, newspapers, clouds, gulls, Elizabethan dance steps, not to mention Homeric correspondences, have the power to structure narrative form, provide images and echoes, and determine the progress of plot at any given moment. The narrative develops in relation to its various subjects, not only the dramatis personae but the whole gestalt that we know as the Dublin of Ulysses. The later styles of the text may be more palpably evident and more obviously dominant than the styles of the early chapters, they may even bear different relationships to the subjects from which they derive, but they develop from the same narrative principles. For instance, the catechism of "Ithaca" provides a metaphysic category in which subject and style are wedded at various levels. Catechism is obviously the method of narration; it is also its subject, in all the various forms in which "catechism" can exist (method of colloquy, ritualization of concepts, educational process,</page><page sequence="9">32 The Journal of Narrative Technique mnemonic device, a structuring of facts, and so forth); but more importantly, the "subjects" of catechism cannot be extrapolated or separated from the catechism, because they exist only in that context at this moment. We can guess the "real" dialogue of Bloom and Stephen, but we cannot rewrite it separate from its existence in "Ithaca." Thus, the perplexing "roc's auk's egg" (U 737) may be Bloom's request for breakfast fare, but we can never know this based on anything that can be derived from an analysis of "roc's auk's egg." The meaning of this phrase is trapped by the linguistic forms from which it derives. Still, there exists a major problem in assuming that the styles of the first chapters of Ulysses are either "initial" or "basic,"13 that they somehow form a consistent monolith against which such later diversions and digressions as "Ithaca" can be measured. No narrator guides our entrance to the Martello tower; no narrator introduces us to Stephen and Mulligan; no narrator provides a sustained viewpoint or a recognizable voice on which our responses to the telling can rest. Indeed, we are led to expect guidance where there is none and we pick our way carefully across the landscape of Sandycove on the opening page. On the first page alone there are two mysterious occurrences whose origins have not-and probably will not-ever be known. Whereas we are told that it is Mulligan who gives "the long low whistle of call" in his comic imitation of the Catholic Mass, we are never told the source of the "two strong shrill whistles" (U 3) of response. This narration, deceptively matter-of-fact, provides its facts without directions; the context is assumed without being stated. And' when the reader attempts to state the assump- tion, either by making a realistic supposition (that the passing mailboat coincidentally issues two whistles as warning of its approach) or by supplying the metaphor appropriate to the circumstance (that the whistles "correspond to" the bells of the Eucharist), he confronts the various subjects of the text without recourse to an intervening source. He intuits the principles which govern this context even as he supplies the "missing" bases on which the facts of the text rest. It is obvious, then, that the reader must discover these principles, must divine the relationship between the subject as narrated and the process by which it is narrated. Often enough, several readers divine several contexts which may variously support or undermine each other, depending on the critical viewpoint. To say that the narrative of Ulysses is contextually governed, that its subjects determine both the type of narration as well as its direction, is not to say that only one context operates at any given moment in the narration. More likely, several contexts present themselves, each vying with the others for the reader's attention. In this particular example at least two contexts present themselves: the metaphoric and the realistic. These contexts exist co-temporally and, while not mutually exclusive, they demand consideration of their relationship to each other. The "long low whistle of call" and the "two strong shrill whistles" of answer exist, simultaneously, on different textual levels. How is the reader to order these contexts and account for their influence on the narrative? What</page><page sequence="10">Narrative Sources and the Problem of Ulysses 33 is the relationship of these levels to each other? These questions are posed by all narrations, regardless of type. They challenge the authority of the teller over the text: what are the sources of the narration? to whom is the narrative responsible? who has authority over the storytelling? For many thousands of years the answer to these riddles rested with the teller or the author who, from the beginnings of narrative in oral tradition, were one and the same person. As attentive scholars and careful readers we have been encouraged to look for the author, to find the handiwork of Henry James in the figure in the carpet and to hear echoes of Chaucer's voice in The Canterbury Tales. We find T.S. Eliot in the voice and person of Prufrock; we look for Graham Greene in Brighton and Dickens in the London of Bleak House; we listen for George Eliot in Middlemarch and hear William Faulkner in Lena Grove's description of her travels to Jefferson. These texts, like Ulysses, operate by principles which divest the author of ultimate authority for the narration, resting the telling in the subject and context of the tale itself. Each of these narratives, even the most traditional and seemingly straightforward among them, exploit style indirect libre and the tale determines the nature of its telling. What seems so revolutionary in Ulysses (or Finnegans Wake) has its roots in earlier, perhaps more subtle, redirections of the storytelling process. Pushed to its limits by the forces of modernism, style indirect libre has outdistanced the critical terminology which tracks its development. If the authority of the storytelling rests in its subject, then it is to Buck Mulligan that we must turn on the opening page of Ulysses. In the context of Mulligan's pose as officiating priest, he converts physical phenomena (his mirror, shaving-bowl, dressing-gown, the Martello tower itself) to his metaphoric purposes. Thus the whistles, whatever their source, exist as corollaries to the ritual bell-ringing of the Catholic liturgy. In their liturgical context, these bells summon God's presence in His historical narrative; under His presence the physical properties of bread and wine become the body and blood of Christ. If James Joyce is metaphorically the God of his own literary creation, the "old chap" to whom Mulligan gives a nod of thanks for the two strong whistles of response is a touch of comic about-face. But James Joyce described the creative artist as absent from his own creation, and it seems unlikely that the author of Ulysses serves as deus ex machina, altering the "reality" of his creation by violating its integrity, or that he is present in his own text under the auspices of Wayne Boothian "implication" or available as an invisible narrator mimicking his characters' voices while silently pulling the strings behind the stage set. Joyce is very much in his text (as God is in the world), but not of it; Joyce is present under the accidents of the narration itself, he himself guided in this telling by the subjects he has created. These subjects are inviolable-especially by their creator. Thus, it is no accident of timing on the opening page of Ulysses that the hour of the morning is just right for the passing mailboat to lend two whistles of response to Mulligan's call. The reality of this Dublin world reflects in its most coincidental details the principles of its own creation.</page><page sequence="11">34 The Journal of Narrative Technique University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Illinois NOTES 1.
