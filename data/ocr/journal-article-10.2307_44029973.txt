<plain_text><page sequence="1">How does architecture construct meaning? Is architecture a visual language? In this essay, Antoni Gaudí's archi- tecture is examined as poetic discourse. Gaudí's Architecture: A Poetic Form ESTHER RAVENTÓS-PONS Gaston He dynamism believes Bachelard to that language attributes "the by poem, means two which functions of the interweaves dual to activity language: real of signification signification and unreal, and and [. . poetry" .] poetry. gives He believes that "the poem, which interweaves real and unreal, [. . .] gives dynamism to language by means of the dual activity of signification and poetry" (xxxi). For Bachelard, the "real" is found in "signification" or in the utilitarian aspect of language, while the creative aspect is found in the "unreal" or in a "poetry" that "awaken [s] [. . .] the automatism of language" (xxxi). Furthermore, he places poetry "a little above the language of signification"; where its "linguistic impulses [. . .] stand out from the ordinary rank of pragmatic language" (xxiii). How are we to apply util- itarian and poetic language to architecture? Michael Graves, in his article "A Case for Figurative Architecture," compares common language to the internal structure of a building, that is, pragmatic, constructional, and technical requirements. Like the ver- bal language that combines verbs, adjectives, and nouns in a particular way to create meaning, architecture's syntax combines the basic elements of physical structure: Mosaic 35/4 0027-1276-02/199014$02.00©Mosaic</page><page sequence="2">200 Mosaic 35/4 (December 2002) walls, floors, ceilings, doors, and windows, in order to construct the building. On the other hand, Graves states that poetic form in architecture is receptive to issues exter- nal to the building, and integrates the myths and rituals of society: "Poetic forms in architecture are sensitive to the figurative, associative, and anthropomorphic attitudes of a culture" (86). Buildings rely on the technical realm to be built, but not neces- sarily incorporate the poetic realm: a figurative language full of metaphors and sym- bols. Antoni Gaudí's architecture is sensitive to both: the "real" or utilitarian aspect of the common language and the "unreal," or creative, aspect of the poetic message. His buildings, three-dimensional texts, interweave a constructive narrative where textu- ral, chromatic, and decorative inferences, as well as radical changes of form and mate- rials, produce a poetic discourse rich in metaphor, symbol, myth, and ritual, a unique style rooted in his Catalan origins. To how approach buildings the carry architectural meaning. narrative According of to Gaudí's Umberto work, Eco, it is any important object, architectur- to analyze how buildings carry meaning. According to Umberto Eco, any object, architectur- al or not, can communicate a message. The theory of signs of Ferdinand de Saussure and Charles Peirce's general theory of signification are important tools for explaining the transmission of meaning. For Saussure, meaning emerges from the combination of two parts of a sign: a signifier (such as sound or visual image) and a signified (a mental concept). The relationship between word/image and concept is arbitrary and conventional. A social contract interrelates particular signifiers to particular signi- fieds. How can we relate the double articulation of the Saussurean sign to architec- ture? What do we imply by the term architectural sign? Saussure, in fact, draws an architectural analogy to illustrate how the linguistic unit of a sign relates to each other and how the message is established: "A linguistic unit is like a fixed part of a building, e.g., a column. On the one hand, the column has a certain relation to the architrave that it supports; the arrangement of the two units in space suggests the syntagmatic relation. On the other hand, if the column is Doric, it suggests a mental comparison of this style with others (Ionic, Corinthian, etc.) although none of these elements is present in space: the relation is associative" (654). An architectural sign, the linguistic unit, can be any part of a building that relates to other parts through a syntagmatic relation or a relation of contiguity and to other styles by association. In Gaudí's work, the syntagmatic relation of linguistic units (columns, windows, walls, ceilings, doors, e.g.), with its profusion of ornamentation, organic motifs, and geometric forms derived from nature, builds into a semantic field of figurative meaning. Shape, texture, and colour create a visual patterning of rhythms and repetitions that reminds us by associ- ation of other styles, like Art Nouveau; as well, the dynamism of the forms strengthens</page><page sequence="3">Esther Raventòs-Pons 201 the "unreal" and stirs our feelings and imagination. Nature with all its forces is portrayed in Gaudi's work: the Catalan land with its ter- rain and light effects reflected in the Mountains of Montserrat, the rocky Costa Brava, the grottoes and the wrinkled twisted olive trees. Nature is an important element in Barcelona's Park Güell (constructed between 1900 and 1914). Through two iron gates we enter into a magical garden where a grand stairway leads us to a large hypostyle hall. This hall supports a large upper plaza delimited by a continuous balustrade bench that twists in a serpentine manner. The park extends beyond these structures through viaducts and paths that merge with nature. Clara Gari believes that "Parque Güell is a place where architecture and nature meet and work together in a way that is infrequent in our western architecture. Gaudi's constructions put the most irra- tional and primitive part of our sensibility into relief, and accentuates what civiliza- tion still has in common with the arts' elementary forces" (118). In Park Güell, the architectural signs or units draw inspiration from nature and interrelate with nature. All of the signifiers - form, colour, and texture - in the viaducts, conceived in its util- itarian aspect of "signification" as weather shelters, blend completely with the topog- raphy to create a poetic trope (see Plate 7, colour section). Furthermore, a second level of signifiers, which Charles Jencks identifies as noise, smell, and tactility, emerge in Gaudi's work to reinforce architectural moods and feelings. The curved passages of continuous walls, adapted to the shape of the hill and supported by tree-like mono- lithic columns made of rough-cut stones or brick of brown/ochre colour, become, as Juan Perucho states, "a petrified forest [. . .] with a force of expansion which is slow, but terribly tenacious and powerful" (140). All of these inter- dependent units inter- weave "signification" with "poetry" to create a powerful petrified forest in which the violently tilted and bent columns produce a powerful reaction. These slanted columns encourage a permanent sense of instability and disorientation, while the tactile effect of their surfaces encourages tensions where obscure primitive forces reside. Salvador Dalí expresses this overwhelming experience as "a sensation of unforgettable anguish" (qtd. in Collins, Antonio 18). Shape, material, light, texture, and colour develop into an expressive poetical message that capture nature's forces, awakening all of our senses. In Park Güell and in all Gaudi's work, colour becomes an important signifier that, together with other signifiers, disrupts, "the automatism of language." Gaudi believes that "ornament has been, is, and will be coloured. Nature does not present us with any object that is monochrome or completely uniform in colour, neither in plants, geo- logy, topography, nor in the animal kingdom. There is always a more or less accentu- ated contrast in colour and we should always learn from these examples that we must employ colour entirely, or partly, in all architectural elements" (Sweeney and Sert</page><page sequence="4">202 Mosaic 35/4 (December 2002 ) 118). Gaudi captures in his work the strong colours and the clear bright light of the Mediterranean, as well as the colour found in the local churches with their Romanesque and Gothic polychrome sculptures and wood panels. In Park Güell, broken pieces of colourful ceramics - called trencadis - put together randomly, decorate the surfaces of the hall's medallions and benches (see Plate 8, colour section). Architect Jose Maria Jujol did this decoration under Gaudi's supervision. Gaudi established the undulating rhythms, continuous curved lines and forms, while Jujol played with a variety of mosaic patterns made from white and broken coloured ceramic, fragments of coloured glass, and with religious graffiti, such as prayers to the Virgin, and crosses. Colour, repetition, rhythm, texture, and form generate a visual patterning that re- inforces poetical language in the Park Güell. The essential function of poetic art is, according to Victor Shklovsky, to "defamiliarize" and to make strange (ostranenie) our everyday modes of perception, to disrupt the normal. Gaudi's architecture goes beyond common language to construct a poetic narrative that makes strange the familiar and incorporates also what is strange and foreign into the architectural code (a set of rules for organizing the architectural message). For example, in the four big polychrome medallions, he also includes fragments of bottles, cups, glasses, and even a porcelain doll's head. These units - bottles, cups, glasses - are entities outside of the architectural common narrative system and, thus, force the architectural code beyond its limits to establish new aesthetic meanings. Meaning emerges from the interplay of signs that the reader/viewer encode and decode. Roland Barthes, in S/Z, states that a text has no specific meaning, no estab- lished signifiers; it is to be constructed of codes and fragments of codes that open the narrative and its constitutive units to many interpretations: "The code is a perspective of quotations, a mirage of structures, [. . .] so many fragments of something that has always been already read, seen, done, experienced; the code is the wake of already" (20). In the present day, our rereading of Gaudi's architecture is based not only on codes and perspectives peculiar to the turn of the twentieth century but also on the connotations that we attribute to our contemporary codes. We can read the trencadis as a vibrant and vital expression in Gaudi's architecture that captures the sensual and voluptuous feeling of nature and reminds us by association of Art Nouveau style. Also, these surfaces become, as some critics have pointed out, an example of such movements as impressionism, abstract art, cubism, dadaism, predating most of them. Additionally, the "unreal" aspect of the Gaudi's poetic language in Park Güell builds into a semantic field in which its constitutive units allude to "a mirage of structures" or quotations of fairy tales; previously read, seen, encountered, and stored in our child- hood memories. The two gates at the lower entrance open to a poetical and magical</page><page sequence="5">Esther Raventòs-Pons 203 garden, guarded by a wall and two round pavilions on each side of the gate and by a serpent and a dragon in the stairwells. The two pavilions, with crenellated roofs covered by broken mosaics that glimmer in the sun, take very peculiar shapes. A mushroom- like form crowns the tower of the right pavilion, and a cross crowns the left. Lluis Permanyer explains: "These pavilions certainly recall fairy tales in the style of the Brothers Grimm, as they resemble storybook houses made of amounts of ice cream. It is not difficult to understand why surrealist Salvador Dali, on first seeing such unorthodox and provocative buildings, imagined he had found a truly edible archi- tecture" (98). Beyond the entrance's wrought-iron gates, we begin climbing a split staircase, covered with ceramic fragments, and we see a fountain; halfway up the stair- case we find a medallion, in polychrome trencadis , portraying the head of a serpent rising from the Catalan coat of arms; and at the top we encounter an enormous drag- on waiting between the double balustrades of the stairwells. Houses, fountains, ser- pent, and dragon, together with the colourful benches, tilted columns, pathways, viaducts, and grottoes, depict a playful world of childhood stories, a world full of fantasy, happiness, and ingenuity. The close association with nature in Gaudi's work links to the signified of Art Nouveau style. Many critics have associated Gaudi's work with Art Nouveau, called Modernisme in Catalonia. David Mackay states that Modernisme "was much more than a local variant of Art Nouveau because it became a style identified with a total movement to affirm Catalan nationhood and cultural autonomy, differentiated from Spanishness and attuned to its advance European counterparts" (8). In Barcelona, architects such as Juan Martorell, Luis Domenech i Montaner, Puig i Cadafalch, and Antoni Gaudi conformed to this movement and changed the face of a growing Barcelona. This style emerged between 1890 and 1910 as a reaction against rational- ism and materialism to embrace freedom from institutional academic art, a freedom that encouraged imagination, fantasy, dream, spirituality, poetry, and sensuality in all the arts. Art Nouveau meant a sudden and radical renewal of architectural forms. Architects like Gaudi and his Catalan contemporaries played with undulating and continuous lines, organic forms, natural and artificial light, and with new materials such as iron and glass. In their buildings, emphasis was placed on the beauty of sim- ple and poorer materials such as brick and plaster, and also, in luxurious materials, such as marble, ebony, crystal, and gold. Skilled workers used glazed ceramics, glass, marble, mosaics, wrought iron, woodwork, and carvings in the façades or in the in- terior of the buildings. In architecture, this change of aesthetic had an effect on both interior and exterior spaces and led to an excess of grandeur and opulence, a profu- sion of decoration, and a display of ornamentation.</page><page sequence="6">204 Mosaic 35/4 (December 2002 ) Nikolaus Pevsner suggests that "Art Nouveau is indeed very largely a matter of dec- oration - so much so that some have denied its validity as an architectural style - and it is furthermore largely a matter of surface decoration" ( Sources 66). The influence of Art Nouveau in Gaudi's is evident: the harmonious combination of multiple materi- als, the craftwork, the fantasy of his architectural expression, the abundance of geo- metrical details, the emphasis in organic motifs, for example. However, he went beyond floral ornamentation and surface decoration to expand the architectural common language, its internal narrative, by investigating new structural systems and building methods without disregarding the poetic narrative. Sweeney and Sert declare: "Art Nouveau played a large role in his self-discovery, as it were, what is most impor- tant in Gaudi's work is not that of the architect as decorator, but that of the architect as builder, his exploration of new structural systems and buildings methods which the Art Nouveau architects never envisaged" (60). For Gaudi as a builder, the mechanics of architecture and the related structural properties of the syntactical architectural language became important and led him to the creation of architectural innovations that reinforced the poetical aspect of his three-dimensional texts. The chapel of Colonia Giiell illustrates Gaudi's methods for solving structural problems and shows how these technical solutions awaken the automatism of the building narrative. He began making sketches and models of this building in 1898; however, the construction did not begin until ten years later, and only the crypt was ever completed (1915). During these ten years, he studied Gothic design with a view to better understanding and solving problems relating to stresses and interior sup- port, ultimately hoping to reduce the number of columns and eliminate the tradi- tional Gothic flying buttresses. When Gaud! worked on a series of studies, he did not use normal drafting procedures. Instead, he built an upside-down model of well- interconnected cords representing the arches and pillars, with small weights repre- senting the loads to be supported. This model, suspended from the ceiling, allowed him to measure the distribution of forces, to experiment with volumes and with the framework of the structure, as well as to solve problems related to support. Later, he photographed this inverted skeleton of the edifice and added colour. The result of this and other experiments led to structural innovations such as hyperbolic parabolas, ellipses, helicoid surfaces, twisted and spiral forms, for example, never used before. These new architectural units go beyond surface decoration to entwine in their shapes the constructional requirements of common language - economy, efficiency, resist- ance, stability - with geometrical poetic forms. These innovative structural elements combined with materials of traditional use (brick, plaster, iron, basalt, and ceramic) transform the religious building of Colonia</page><page sequence="7">Esther Raventós-Pons 205 Güell into an expressive poetic narrative that enhances Western religious rituals. In the oval-shaped crypt, walls, columns, and vaults merge into each other through curved surfaces and through new structural applications. No two columns are the same: dissimilar sloping pillars, built from various materials - brick, basalt, and stone - are slanted and placed in different directions. In the centre of the crypt, four basalt columns are joined by arches, from out of which come other ramifications supported by columns. The rough and crude texture, created by exposing and contrasting dif- ferent materials and brutally displaying them in walls, columns, arches, and ceilings, produces a regular yet disjunctive repetitive narrative that promotes a cavernous and primitive mysterious world and enhances the ritualistic role of the building. Repetitions in this magical vaulted space generate a steady, rhythmical, and hypnotic beat that captures "a voluntary and ascetic primitivism, which moves from harshness to vio- lence" (Solà-Morales 28). On the other hand, the filtered light, from the round and leafy stained glassed windows, increases the intimate feeling in this ascetic spiritual space of repetitive forms, reinforcing an eternal sense of piety. In the chapel, texture, form and light create a sacred, captivating yet brutal space where the powerful roughness of the surface reflects the dramatic expressiveness of nature and that stands apart from the popular expressions of Art Nouveau. Or, as Gabriel Sterner says, the crypt of Colonia Güell does "not imitate nature; it is nature that dictates texture and form" (74). Gaudi places nature at the centre of his thoughts, at the centre of his creative process. The poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge believes that one of the poet's objectives is "to make nature thought and thought nature" and con- cluded that art "had the power of humanizing nature, or infusing the thoughts and passions of man into everything which is the object of his contemplation" (52). Gaudl's three-dimensional texts passionately portray nature with all its primitive and gravitational forces. His constructive narrative promotes a relationship of tension where nature dictates not only the external structure - the poetic arrangement of rhythms and shapes, hyperbolic parabolas, ellipses, for example - but also the inter- nal technical assemblage of the building's language, dissolving boundaries of both discourses and reinforcing simultaneously their differences. Charles Jencks came up with the term "Ecstatic Architecture" to refer to Gaudi's work and to any type of architecture - from cave art to the new Guggenheim Museum - that provokes emotional reactions. Such architecture goes beyond pragmatic, techni- cal, and constructional requirements of the common language to highlight the poetic, the heightened intensity of emotion, ecstasy. The word ecstatic derives from the Greek word ecstasis. In religious terms, ecstasis defines the rapture or delirium of a mystical experience. In secular terms, it means an intense delight or agitation. For Jencks, the</page><page sequence="8">206 Mosaic 35/4 (December 2002) term can be applied to architecture: "Ecstatic Architecture may induce a sense of euphoria, or be part of a ritual experience meant to do so, or it may arouse a sense of devotion, awe, love and deeper understanding; or it may through aesthetic and con- ceptual means excite the more purely architectural passions. As this variety shows, it does not have a single motive, but it certainly aims at inclusion and a unitive experi- ence which is why, like creativity itself, it brings together into a new whole such dis- parate material" ( Ecstatic 7). Gaudi's architecture is ecstatic. The viewer is captivated, according to Jencks, by an "eruption of voluptuous nature" that encourages different types of emotions: delight, euphoria, devotion, passion, and even a mystical experience. The poet Voltaire des- cribed poetry as "almost nothing but feeling" (Capon 142). Feelings, in the case of Gaudi's poetical buildings, develop from a narrative that employs forms from nature's moods to capture peacefulness and boldness, and the violence and disorder of the Mediterranean land. In Park Glieli, beauty, savageness, and violence, in a fluid and dynamic world of continuous changing shapes and sensual curves, provoke a climac- tic lyrical expression that leads to disturbance, delirium, and ultimately a receptive state, an ecstatic secular state. On the other hand, the cavernous feeling in the crypt of Colonia Glieli, or the emphasis in vertically and movement of the towers in the temple of Sagrada Familia, evoke a transcendent sense, a spiritual experience. The lyrical quality of Gaudi's ecstatic architecture develops from the dynamic proper- ties of its narrative; an architectural narrative that promotes feelings derived not only from patterns and forms but also from the meaning of its figurative language. Meaning in the Saussurean model is based on the play of syntagmatic and associative relations within the linguistic code but severed from the cultural context in which the code is used. On the other hand, philosopher C.S. Peirce includes the interprétant in the definition of the sign; acknowledging the human participation in the production of meaning: "A sign therefore is an object which is in relation to its object on the one hand and to an interprétant on the other in such a way as to bring the interprétant into a relation to the object" (643). The inclusion of an interprétant with his or her own attitudes and values toward the object affects the process of interpretation and meaning. Furthermore, language, as Mikhail Bakhtin explains, is shaped and coloured by social, cultural and historical implications, opening the sign to other aspects of culture and experience. Gaudi's narrative was conditioned by the aesthetics, tradi- tions, geography, religion and politics of Catalan/Spanish society at the turn of the twentieth century, a period of economic growth and political prosperity for Catalonia. Gaudi's three-dimensional texts bear the imprint of his time and are interpreted and reinterpreted by a reader/viewer also culturally and historically determined. Diversity</page><page sequence="9">Esther Raventós-Pons 207 in readings of the same form will appear inevitably, especially as his architecture becomes an emotional expression, full of metaphors, myths, and symbols that engage our imagination to new meanings. Peirce's triadic classification of the sign assists the reading of Gaud! 's poetic language. Peirce distinguishes three basic kinds of sign: icon, index, and symbol. An iconic sign resembles its referent like a portrait, a picture, or onomatopoeic word. In an indexi- cal sign, the representation implies an object not because of similarity or analogy but in terms of a physical relationship (a pointing finger indicates which way to go; smoke indicates fire). A symbolic sign has no objective relation to the object that it denotes, only a conventional or habitual link (a flag symbolizes a country). Geoffrey Broadbent explains Peirce's triadic classification in architectural terms: an architect's drawings are icons, Broadbent suggests; a building itself might be an icon if it "reminds" us of something else. For example, Art Nouveau buildings remind us of nature. Art galleries, museums, and exhibition pavilions are indices because they set routes and thereby "indicate" which way to go. The Gothic cathedral is a symbol of the Christian faith ("Plain" 136-37). Gaudi's architecture emphasizes the iconic and symbolic sign, incorporating myths, symbols, and rituals of Catalan society. Gaudi's architecture is metaphorical because it exists as a visual analogy between its form and nature, and because each linguistic unit of the building and the building as a whole is charged with metaphorical significance. In Casa Batlló (renovated between 1905 and 1907), single architectural objects such as columns, at the street level and first floor, take the shape of bones (hence the name la casa de los huesos 'the house of bones'). Striking ivory-coloured balconies evoke masks or skulls. The green textural undulating roof that crowns the building is reminiscent of a hat, a dragon, or the mountains of Montserrat (see Plate 9, colour section). The coloured mosaic tiles that cover the front and rear façades and the rooftop of this apartment building are marine metaphors. In any analysis of the message of the entire building, surface metaphors in Casa Batlló are related to nature, popular Catalan culture, and religion. One can see, as many critics have already pointed out: 1) the Mediterranean sea with its undula- ting forms and colourful ceramics; 2) the carnival (the crest seems a harlequin hat, the balconies are the masks and the multicoloured façade is the confetti); 3) the legend of Saint George, patron saint of Barcelona (the roof represents both the scales of the dragon and the spire, which is a metaphor for St. George's lance as he fights against the dragon, and, at the top of the tower, a three dimensional cross symbolizes the triumph of good over evil). The colourful scales of the wounded animal cover the roof and the façade. The balconies would seem to be the skulls of its victims, and the lower part of the façade, the two first-floor colonnades, are the bones of the dragon's victims.</page><page sequence="10">208 Mosaic 35/4 (December 2002) The architectural narrative of Casa Batlló is, according to Jencks, "multivalent and plural in its range of meaning," since it encourages the imagination of reader/ viewer in a multitude of different ways, according to their moods, feelings, thoughts, and behaviours ( "Architectural" 91,95). This multivalent building has raised disagreements among many critics regarding the interpretation of the carnival because of Gaudi's religiosity, but Gar! argues that, "in the history of the Church, Carnival and Lent have been inseparable companions, and many artists, of a religious background who have worked for the Church, have represented and evoked as much the spiritual aesthetic as the colourist and at times even the grotesque party in hell in their works" (114). However, regardless of what other critics may argue, Pevsner maintains that "every building creates associations in the mind of the beholder, whether the architect wanted it or not" ( History 293). Thus, metaphors in Gaudi's work introduce a disorienting, ever-changing and slippery space - an ecstatic space - that encourages multiple and simultaneous readings. Broadbent disagrees with Jencks 's terminology in calling these icons - bones, sea, masks, and dragons - metaphors; they are too simple and banal, and he believes that the term metaphor should be used only for buildings that have deep and subtle mean- ings. Despite this disagreement in terminology, both acknowledge that Gaudi's archi- tecture articulates a deeper level of meaning not immediately revealed by a simple reading of visual analogies. As Jencks also states, bones, sea, and dragon become a statement for Catalan nationalism in which St. George slays the dragon of Castille. The bones and the masks represent those of the martyrs who have died in the strug- gle ("Architectural" 95). The deep metaphorical meaning in Casa Batlló is defined by taking into consideration specific social and historical circumstances of the Catalan land. Therefore, the building becomes a symbol that depicts feelings of Catalan nation- alism. This cultural symbol "operates even when the architect - or critic - has pre- tended it would not" (Broadbent, "Deep" 137). Gaudi's architecture is also a symbol, in Peirce's terms, where convention sets the relation among the signifier, the building, or part of the building, and the signified among a particular set of ideas. For example, Sagrada Familia goes beyond subtle expression to bold communication where every signifier is transformed into a pow- erful symbol of Catholic faith. Gaudi was a very religious man, and he lived and worked during the last part of his fife in a very modest way. His religious and spiritual attitude materialized in obsession when he was dealing with the construction of the Sagrada Familia. From 1910 until his death in 1926, the temple became his dominant thought. In order to devote all his time and energy to this temple, he did not take on any other commissions and got to the point when he even lived in it. He wanted to</page><page sequence="11">Esther Raventós-Pons 209 build a monumental work with eighteen towers, five long ships, and three transverse houses. His aim was to make the Sagrada Familia "the largest church in the world, the church of universal faith, built after the sacred model of the mythical Jerusalem of the Apocalypse - shining, spiritual, and glorious beyond all expression" (Descharnes and Prévost 62). Perucho explains that "Gaudi worked very slowly, conceiving his work from the very beginning as a great mystical poem, full of allusions and with a meticulous and coher- ent symbolism, totally committed to the liturgical functions" (72). Similar to the great mystical poems of Saint John of the Cross, where symbolic discourse is totally com- mitted to capturing the movements of the soul rising toward God during the night, Gaudi's narrative conceives every detail carefully within a complex system of liturgi- cal symbolism. The three facades that he planned to build - Nativity, Passion and Glory - were carefully placed to represent the life of Christ. The Nativity façade, the only one built, looks toward the northeast to represent the birth of Christ, and it is adorned with sculptures that capture scenes from His childhood. It has three por- tals - Faith, Hope and Charity - that embody these three theological virtues, the three doors symbolizing the Trinity. The other two façades were never built. The façade of the Passion was planned facing toward the setting sun to depict Christ's death. The noon sun illuminating the Glory façade would have been the one to capture Christ's Resurrection. Twelve of the spiral towers (of which only four towers were completed) represent the twelve apostles, and a taller tower represents Christ. The Sagrada Familia becomes an architectural signifier rich in symbolism and the imagery of a Christian world (Descharnes and Prévost 62; Solà-Morales 29-31). The construction of the cathedral was suddenly interrupted in June 1926 when Gaudi was run over and killed by a streetcar. He completed only the crypt, the apse, and the Nativity façade, with its four one-hundred-meter-high spiral towers (see Plate 10, colour section). In his sketchy drawings, the emphasis was placed on the verticality of the building, produced by the planned eighteen towers, with one of them rising to 170 metres. The spiral forms of the towers and their verticality, together with the details in the Nativity façade - organic and geometrical forms, flowery elements, stalagmites, land effects, and water rhythms that capture the Mediterranean land - construct an ecstatic narrative. The delirium of natural forms, which contrasts with the rigid and lifeless sculptures, creates a constant tension between dream and reality. Moreover, the spiral movement of the towers toward the sky and the upward motion of the natural forms in this monumental façade, together with its symbolism and metaphorical imagery, generate a rising, dynamic, overwhelming religious experience, a feeling of bliss, and a feeling of communion between human beings and God.</page><page sequence="12">210 Mosaic 35/4 (December 2002) This upward movement of the Sagrada Familia, within this religious code, leads us by association to the movement of the soul. The message emerges with the establish- ment of an internal association from the physical spiral movements of the tall towers, crowned by a cross, to religion and to the abstract concept of the soul rising toward the sky. Roman Jakobson defines this association through relation of contiguity as metonymy. He considers that "the development of a discourse may take place along two different semantic lines: one topic may lead to another either through their similarity or through their contiguity. The metaphoric way would be the most appro- priate term for the first case and the métonymie way for the second" (57-58). Metaphor and metonymy, icons and symbols, in Gaudi's architectural three-dimensional text, capture the mythic and ritualistic aspects of Catalan culture, and Gaudi's poetical narrative depicts a yearning for contact with nature and with its beauty, chaos, sensu- ality, and savageness in a city where green spaces are non-existent. Juhani Pallasmaa believes that "the quality of architecture does not lie in the sense of reality that it expresses, but quite reverse, in its capacity for awakening our imagi- nation" (452). Not all buildings can appeal to our feelings and stir our imagination. Gaudi's architecture exists as a practical reality, a place of shelter; its lyrical forms also stimulate our imagination and awaken all our senses. When columns are seen as sub- stitutes for trees or bones, when buildings represent mountains or seas or become a symbolic or spiritual world, architecture exceeds its primary purpose and becomes an overall experience, "awakening our imagination." The meaning in architecture, accord- ing to Pallasmaa, "lies not in its forms, but in the images transmitted by the forms and the emotional force that they carry. Form only affects our feelings through what it rep- resents" (449). Gaudi's architecture seduces us into a magical world that is imprinted in our memories, or in our subconscious, a world full of fantasy and visions. On the flat roof of Casa Milá (const. 1905-1910), chimneys, entrances, and venti- lation shafts assume weird and fantastic shapes (see Plate 11, colour section). These forms can articulate a wide range of possibilities, but the interaction of form and con- text creates a disturbing landscape that appeals to our subconscious: we see monsters, warriors, and phantoms. The roof's dramatic expression develops, especially at night, into "a lunar landscape of erratic up and down stairways" (Collins, Antonio 21) where "these enormous sculptures impress us as if they were malevolent presences, robots possessed with a terrible power, fixed and immutable in their constant impassivity" (Perucho 184). Furthermore, the steps placed near the edge of a deep courtyard with no banisters enhance the visitors' insecurity, creating "the right state of mind for the monsters and enigmatic hooded people to have their maximum effect" (Collins, Gaudi 112). Giants, monsters, and the unstable space occasion a disquieting feeling</page><page sequence="13">Esther Raventós-Pons 211 that plays with contrasts and erases boundaries between fear and courage, beauty and ugliness, pleasure and pain. Thus Gaudi's architecture transcends form and mere sig- nification to become an example of an architectural communication of powerful feel- ings where we cannot remain passive. Gaudi's poetic architecture is not so much seen as experienced. William Wordsworth's statement in "Preface to Lyrical Ballads" sums up Gaudi's work: "Poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings" (126). WORKS CITED Bachelard, Gaston.
