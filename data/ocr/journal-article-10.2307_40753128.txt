<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Debate over the Maimonidean Theory of Providence in Thirteenth-Century Jewish Philosophy Dov Schwartz Several Jewish thinkers of the thirteenth century, commenting on Maimonides' Guide of the Perplexed, became parties to a controversy over Providence. Our aim in this paper is to describe the positions they took, which are of no little theological and cultural-historical interest. /. Two Thirteenth- Century Interpretations of the Maimonidean Notion of Providence Maimonides' theory of Providence has always aroused the interest of commentators and scholars, past and present. His views on the subject have been interpreted in a variety of ways, ranging from attempts to harmonize them with the conservative doctrine of an active, personal Providence, to a radical rationalism denying the concrete nature of Providence.1 Maimonides' views of Providence, as expressed in Guide of the Perplexed, may be summarized in two central statements: 1. Individual Providence watches over the human species only; the other existents are subject only to Universal Providence, which is concerned exclusively with the preservation of the species. 2. The level of providential concern for a person depends on that person's intellectual achievement and philoso- phical perfection {Guide 3:17). The interpretations of Maimonides' principle of Individual Providence, as offered by his disciples and other adherents of his philosophy at the end of the twelfth century and in the first half of the thirteenth, may be grouped into two major orientations. The different orientations are supported by discrepancies and nuances of emphasis to be found in 1 See I. J. Dienstag, 'Maimonides on Providence - Bibliography' (Hebrew), Da' at 20 (1988), pp. 5-28. Jewish Studies Quarterly, vol. 2 (1995)</page><page sequence="2">186 Dov Schwartz JSQ2 different chapters of the Guide, generally Chapters 17, 18 and 51 of Part III, as well as certain implications of Maimonides' discussion of Job (3:22-23).2 One orientation is represented by avowedly Maimonidean rationalists, who believe that providential concern for individual human beings has no external expression. A person watched over by Providence cannot escape the accidentality of the world of generation and corruption; he/she may experience misfortune no less than an un watched being. The essence of Providence, then, is the perfect human's ability to ignore the material world, so that misfortunes simply become meaningless for that person. As the focus of existence shifts to philosophical, intellectual matters, the intellectual becomes completely indifferent to affliction and loss. A typical representative of this interpretation is Samuel Ibn Tibbon of Provence, translator of the Guide. In an epistle devoted especially to Providence, Ibn Tibbon cites several proofs that the perfect human being is 'subject to misfortunes like any other person.'3 Hence the intellectual under the surveillance of Providence, such as Job after he had understood the meaning of his afflictions and their real value, does not consider suffering and the loss of material possessions of any consequence.4 A similar approach may be discerned in the philosophy of the Italian philosopher Zerahya ben Isaac ben Shealtiel Hen Graçian.5 The other orientation is represented by more moderate rationalists, who posited a definite realistic stratum in Individual Providence. The more a person intellects and acquires knowledge, the more he/she is liberated from the accidents of the material world. Providential concern for a perfect being is reflected in concrete, material assistance rendered by God 2 For an analysis of these sources see C.

These are comments on Elihu's views, which Zerahya asserts more than once to be absolutely true, despite God's answer to Job from the tempest.</page><page sequence="3">(1995) The Debate over The Maimonidean Theory of Providence 187 in the avoidance of danger. A representative of this approach is the scholar named Kalonymus who wrote the book Mesharet Moshe (hereafter: MM),6 in whose view Individual Providence grants concrete advantages in the world of generation and corruption. For example, in Kalonymus' view, when Scripture speaks of God 'who brought you out of the land of Egypt' (Exodus 20:2; Deuteronomy 5:6), it is referring to Individual Providence: only thanks to Individual Providence did the Children of Israel attain material redemption. Other advocates of this orientation in the thirteenth century were probably Isaac Ibn Latif7 and Shem Tov Ibn Falaquera.8 The difference between these orientations may be seen, for example, in the relationship between Providence and the avoidance of death. In Ibn Tibbon's view, the fact that an intellecting human, engaged in apprehend- ing truths and elucidating thoughts, is subject to Providence does not protect that person from death. The laws governing the material world are not affected by Individual Providence. As he writes: Would that I knew if he who clarifies his thought and apprehends the Creator in the true ways will escape this adversary. . . . Surely, it is a matter of common knowledge that [a human being] will not escape death [net Hat neshamah; lit.: the removal of the soul] because he is composed of opposites and put together from a multitude of noughts.9 Kalonymus, on the other hand, teaches that Providence may also save one from death. Death may vanquish the perfect person, he writes, only if that person's thoughts turn from intellection to mundane matters. This approach may be deduced from Kalonymus' use of the aggadic description of the death of King David: 6 This book, first copied in 1273, was probably written in the middle of the thirteenth century. We shall refer below to the defence of Maimonides' theory of Providence in Mesharet Moshe, citing from MS Vatican 251. Sha'ar ha-Shamayim, Gate 1, Chap. 24, published by A. Jelhnek, Ha-Shahar 2 (1871), p. 102. Latif 's theory of Providence should be added to the list of subjects in which he was influenced by Maimonides; see S. O. Heller- Wilensky, 'Isaac Ibn Latif - Philosopher or Kabbalist?' Jewish Medieval and Renaissance Studies (A. Altmann, ed.). Cambridge. Mass.. &amp; London 1967. dd. 185-224. 8 Mainly in the second of the three chapters at the end of Moreh ha-Moreh (ed. M.L. Bisliches, Pressburg 1837, p. 146). Cf. R. Jospe, Torah and Sophia. The Life and Thought of Shem Tov Ibn Falaquera, Cincinnati 1988, pp. 164-166. Epistle, ed. Diesendruck, p. 355. For this reason Ibn Tibbon was favorably inclined to asceticism and the death wish. As he writes later on: Alternatively, we may say that our Master's [= Maimonides'] intention in this wondrous matter was that, while the wise man clarifies and isolates his thought, he will not fear any misfortune that may befall him, be it death or suffering. Indeed, death is a very good thing for him should he die in the course ofthat kiss, that is to say, the pleasure of intellection' (ibid., p. 361). On asceticism in other works of Samuel Ibn Tibbon see D. Schwartz, 'Ethics and Asceticism in Medieval Jewish Philosophy' (Hebrew), Between Religion and Ethics (A. Sagi &amp; D. Statman, eds.), Ramat- Gan 1993, pp. 196-198.</page><page sequence="4">188 Dov Schwartz JSQ2 For even a wise and righteous man may be watched over in a defective way, namely, at such times as he diverts his heart from the Lord to his other affairs, as it was stated in the case of David, peace be upon him: When the angel of death came to take his soul and saw him occupied with the Torah, he was powerless against him until he tricked him and diverted his attention from words of Torah. Only then was he [David] delivered into his hands (Babylonian Talmud, Shabbat 30a-b; MM, 8b). In other words, although David's time had come to die, as far as the decomposition of his material body was concerned, Providence would not allow that to happen, obliging the angel of death to 'trick him'. It would seem, therefore, that in the thirteenth century, with its stormy controversies, Kalonymus was easily able to defend the Maimonidean position as he understood it. Ibn Tibbon's view, however, was perhaps more consistent with the general principles underlying Maimonides' teachings, such as the denial of divine intervention in the physical world after Creation.10 Such intervention, albeit for the benefit of the perfect human being, would contradict the principle that God created a perfect world. However, the rational interpretation raises grave theological difficulties for the traditionalist viewpoint, which explains Providence in terms of personal, dynamic intervention in concrete events. Kalonymus therefore devoted a special work to defending Maimonides' theory of Providence in his personal interpretation. //. The Traditionalist Interpretation Jewish thinkers of the thirteenth century frequently complained of unnamed 'philosophisers' and their notions of Providence, which were both wrong and misleading. Such complaints came from different circles, including those of the radical rationalists. Thus, Jacob Anatoli, referring to the verse The Lord has established His throne in heaven, and His sovereign rule is over all' (Psalm 103:19), wrote: This verse was pronounced as if to answer the words of those who dispute the Torah, namely, the philosophers, who say in their perplexity about Providence that 'the Lord has forsaken the land' (Ezekiel 8:12; 9:9), heaven forbid. But from His dwelling-place He gazes [Heb. mashgiah] and His sovereign rule is over all, even over the lowliest creatures, the last composite creatures to be created, as known to all the wise of heart, in respect of the order [of creation]: [He exercises] His rule over higher ones and over still higher ones.11 10 Introduction to Avot, Chap. 8; Guide 2:28. 1 1 w ^ «4 • -v-^ « • mt mm rm M • •.-**■» -mm** f » rm* V ■ 1 ■ -w -fl Following fccclesiastes y.l. lhe passage is cited irom Malmad ha-lalmiaim, Lyck 1866, fol. 52b.</page><page sequence="5">(1995) The Debate over The Maimonidean Theory of Providence 189 Isaac Ibn Latif, speaking from a different vantage point, cites a whole string of verses 'about Providence,' all in order 'to rebuke some of the philosophers who reach out their hand to destroy a major religious principle of the Torah.'12 Anatoli and Ibn Latif attack unspecified 'philosophers,' without telling us whether they are referring to Jewish thinkers or to Aristotelian philosophy and its representatives in general. On the other hand, one sees from Mesharet Moshe that there was indeed a traditionalist interpretation of the Maimonidean theory of Providence among Jewish philosophers, which saw it as 'destructive' and 'perplexing.' During the thirteenth century a fierce debate raged over the esoteric rational interpretation of the Maimonidean theory of Providence. It was initiated by the kabbalist Jacob b. Sheshet, who launched an attack on the rationalist Samuel Ibn Tibbon. A scrutiny of the debate indicates that Jacob b. Sheshet criticized Samuel Ibn Tibbon not only as an independent thinker but also as a supposedly authoritative interpreter of the Guide.13 What was the target of Jacob's wrath when he referred to Providence in his Meshiv Devarim Nekhohiml In Chapter 20 of that work he cites two passages from Ibn Tibbon's Ma' amar Yikkavu ha-Mayim, as follows: (i) And these two Providences - that is to say, Providence as applied to the good, to reward them; and Providence as applied to the wicked, to punish them, if this be rightly called Providence - are similar and equal in our faith. And upon realizing that one Providence is not as it should be in accordance with his faith, that is, Providence as applied to the wicked to punish them, he proposed to deny the other, similar Providence, that is, Providence as applied to the righteous (MYH, 75; MDN, 159).14 (ii) But He watches over every existent, in accordance with the capacity of Providence, as explained by the Revered Master of Righteousness in Chapter 17 of the third part of the work Guide of the Perplexed in Aristotle's name, and 12 Sha'ar ha-Shamayim, Gate 1, Chap. 23, p. 99. Nachmanides criticized the very foundation of the philosophical concept of Providence, i. e., divine knowledge that does not contain particulars. See, e.g., Sermon on Ecclesiastes, in Kitvei ha-Ramban, ed. C. B. Chavel, vol. 1, Jerusalem 1963, pp. 193-194. 13 Cf. G. Scholem, Origins of the Kabbalah, Princeton, NJ, 1987, pp. 377-378. It was indeed Jacob's intention to dissociate Maimonides from his radical commentator Ibn Tibbon. However, it is no less plausible that intellectuals reading his critique understood them as an attack on the Maimonidean tradition, including Maimonides himself. On Jacob b. Sheshet and his critique of rationalism see G. Vajda, Recherches sur la philosophie et la kabbale dans la pensée juive du Moyen Age, Paris 1962, pp. 13-113; A. Ravitzky, The Thought of Zerahiah ben Isaac ben Shealtiel Hen and Maimonidean- Tibbonian Philosophy in the Thirteenth Century' (Hebrew), Dissertation, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1978, pp. 38, 238-239.

Let us begin with Jacob b. Sheshet's criticism of the second passage. He argues that Ibn Tibbon, resorting here to esoteric language, concealed his real, radical view. Therefore, immediately after quoting Ibn Tibbon, Jacob purports to decipher the puzzle offered by the enigmatic language of the translator of the Guide: And now I shall expose his villainy. He first stated that His Providence reaches every existent. But then he imposed a condition, saying, 'in accordance with the capacity of Providence;' and this wording is still ambiguous. But he explained that Providence is as explained by Aristotle, as the Master wrote in his own name. Know that in Aristotle's opinion the Creator, may He be exalted, does not watch over or assist or support everything that is beneath the sphere of the Moon, neither man nor the other existents, as the Master wrote. And now that Ben Tibbon revealed his view of Providence, he redoubled his offense, saying, 'as he [= Maimonides] explained in his own name.' Now these two explanations, I mean to say, Aristotle's opinion and the Master's opinion, are not equal. The only reason Ben Tibbon wrote that Aristotle's opinion and the Master's opinion are equivalent was to hint to those misled by him that the Master believes in Aristotle's opinion, but wrote as he wrote because of the multitude. And if he had not had these two evils in his heart - namely, that he believed in the words of Aristotle and bore false witness against the Master - he would not have considered the two views equivalent, insofar as they are not equal, and he would have been content with the Master's opinion alone. But he who slanders is a fool (MDN, loc. cit.). The second passage that Jacob b. Sheshet cites from Ibn Tibbon appears in his commentary on the verse The Lord has established His throne in heaven.' Ibn Tibbon was in effect stating the Aristotelian doctrine that providential concern for the existents means preservation of the species - with the sole exception of the human race, concerning which he says, 'His Providence applies in greater measure to the good among [men]' (MYH, loc. cit.). Essentially, he is repeating Maimonides' assertion: 'But regard- ing all the other animals and, all the more, the plants and other things, my opinion is that of Aristotle' (Guide 3:17 [p. 47 1]15). Jacob, however, sees in the emphasis on the elements common to Aristotle and Maimonides an indication that, according to Ibn Tibbon, Maimonides' view coincides absolutely with that of Aristotle. Hence Ibn Tibbon's allusions to the difference between Aristotle and Maimonides are mere payment of lip- service to 'the multitude.' Jacob is thus accusing Ibn Tibbon of distortion on two fronts: (a) his suggestion that there is no such thing as Individual 15 All passages from the Guide are quoted from S. Pines' translation, The Guide of the Perplexed, Chicago &amp; London 1963 (page references in brackets).</page><page sequence="7">(1995) The Debate over The Maimonidean Theory of Providence 191 Providence; and (b) his false (esoteric) explanation of Maimonides' theory of Providence. The first passage quoted from Ibn Tibbon occurs in the latter's commentary to Psalm 73, in Chapter 14 of Ma 'amar Yikkavu ha-Mayim. Ibn Tibbon interprets the psalm as a description of the poet's doubts and self-searching concerning the existence of Providence - and that was what aroused Jacob ben Sheshet's ire. On the verse, 'As for me, my feet had almost strayed ... for I envied the wanton' (Psalms 73:2-3), Ibn Tibbon comments, 'For I came within an inch of straying from the path of belief in Providence' (MYH, 75). Jacob ben Sheshet, however, contends that the Psalmist had never doubted the existence of Individual Providence; Ibn Tibbon wrote as he did precisely because he himself denied its reality. In sum, Jacob ben Sheshet represents the traditionalist critics of the esoteric interpretation of the Maimonidean theory of Providence.16 ///. Defence of Maimonides' Theory of Providence During the thirteenth century, Maimonides' theory of Providence, as formulated in the Guide, aroused traditionalist opposition. Kalonymus' book Mesharet Moshe was written as a defensive tract, in reaction to that opposition. Examining his forthright defence, one can reconstruct the traditionalists' objections and their interpretation of Maimonides' teachings and phrase his responses to each. Here are the three objections and interpretations of Maimonides' teachings on Providence, in order of appearance in the fourth chapter of Mesharet Moshe. 1. Maimonides versus the Sages The objection in question is implicit in Kalonymus' argument {MM, 7b). Maimonides, in Guide 3:17, describes five opinions as to the nature of Providence, of which the fifth is 'the opinion of our Law,' namely, the doctrines of free will and reward and punishment: '... that man has an absolute ability to act; I mean to say that in virtue of his nature, his choice and his will, he may do everything that is within the capacity of man to do, and this without there being created for his benefit in any way any newly produced thing. Similarly, all the species of animals move in virtue of their own will' [p. 469]. Maimonides indeed emphasizes in this passage the special nature of Providence as applied to man: '... that all the calamities that befall men and all the good things that come to men, be it a single 16 Cf. Vajda, Recherches (above, n. 13), pp. 105-109.</page><page sequence="8">192 Dov Schwartz JSQ 2 individual or a group, are all of them determined according to the deserts of the men concerned through equitable judgment, in which there is no injustice whatever' [loc. cit.]. This opinion, however, is not very different from that of the Mu'tazilites, if one omits the reference to the just deserts of animals. Maimonides' words as they stand imply that, in the 'opinion of our Law,' all inhabitants of the universe are subject to an absolutely just law. After his account of the view of the Torah, Maimonides sets out his own, personal opinion, which supposedly differs from the previous five, including that of the Torah: As for my own belief with regard to this fundamental principle, I mean divine Providence, it is as I shall set if forth to you. . . . this opinion, which I believe is less disgraceful than the previous opinions and nearer than they to intellectual reasoning. For I for one believe that in this lowly world - I mean that which is beneath the sphere of the moon - divine Providence watches only over the individuals belonging to the human species ... [p. 471]. On the basis of this passage, Maimonides was accused of arrogantly ignoring Rabbinic teaching on Providence and suggested an opposing view.17 To this argument Kalonymus retorts, as may be inferred from Maimonides' own words, that the Rabbis themselves disagreed over the nature of Providence, so that two different approaches are discernible: one resembling that of the Mu'tazilites, the other holding that man alone is subject to Individual Providence. Kalonymus contends that Maimonides' theory, far from being in conflict with the Rabbinical view, relies on those of the Rabbis who followed the second approach. As he writes: Some scholars of our Torah say that there is no Providence in this lower world, save as applied to the human race alone, to the species as a whole and to its particulars. Other living things, however, are not subject to Providence in their particulars at all, and all their actions are accidents. This was the opinion 17 The distinction between the fifth opinion ('the opinion of our Law') and Maimonides' personal opinion was already pointed out by classical commentators, such as R. Nissim of Marseilles and R. Shem Tov b. Joseph Ibn Shem Tov; see A. S. Halkin, 'Nissim ben Mosche on Providence,' in Hommage a Georges Vajda (G. Nahon &amp; Ch. Touati, eds.), Louvain 1980, pp. 221-222; Commentary of R. Moses Narboni on The Guide of the Perplexed, éd. Y. Goldenthal, Wien 1832, p. 54a; Commentary of R. Joseph Ibn Kaspi on The Guide of the Perplexed, ed. Z. Werbloner, Frankfurt a/M 1848, p. 128; Commentary of R. Shem Tov b. Joseph Ibn Shem Tov on The Guide of the Perplexed, in Moreh Nevukhim 'im Perushim, Jerusalem 1960, pp. 25b-26a. Modern commentators agree; see L. Strauss, Persecution and the Art of Writing, Glencoe, 111., 1952, pp. 83-84. On esoteric interpretations by fundamentalists in the disputes over the Guide, see Ravitzky, 'Secrets' (supra, n. 3), pp. 169-172. As early as the thirteenth century, Kalonymus clearly describes such interpretations in his arguments.</page><page sequence="9">(1995) The Debate over The Maimonidean Theory of Providence 193 cited by our Master Moses, of blessed memory, in his famed book 'Guide of the Perplexed,' attributing it to himself, without thereby intending to set himself apart from the other scholars {MM, 7b). Concerning the traditionalists, Kalonymus charges that 'some did not understand what he said on this matter, just as they do not understand the rest of his teachings, attributing to him things that he did not say' {ibid). An examination of Kalonymus' position in the light of fourteenth-century interpretations of the Guide, for example, shows that he distanced himself from the radicals. Fourteenth-century commentators explained that 'the opinion of our Law' was fit for the multitude in general or for 'the multitude of our scholars,' while Maimonides' personal opinion was intended solely for intellectuals capable of apprehending truths. Thus, the sources may be read in more than one way, depending on whether the intended readership is the general public or the elect few. Kalonymus, however, prefers to speak of a Rabbinic controversy, as he is then able to identify the views of the Sages and the Guide without inclining in the least toward esotericism. 2. Providence consequent on the intellect According to Maimonides, Providence applies to human beings in accordance with their intellectual achievements. The level of achievement determines the degree to which they are watched over by Providence. In this connection, Maimonides' critics and traditionalist commentators aimed their barbs at one of the most sensitive issues treated in the Guide - the fate of a righteous, observant person, possessing virtues in the highest measure but not scholarship. According to the criterion for immortality (as set forth, e.g., in Maimonides' Introduction to Perek Helek), for example, such a person will be lost, for he/she has not acquired knowledge. The polemicists, understanding the implications of this problematic idea for the notion of Providence, therefore chose to attack it. It implied, they claimed, that Providence applied to 'scholars' only and that 'from a city numbering a thousand there will remain no more than one or two persons to whom Providence will apply' {MM, 7b-8a). Thus there is no providential concern for multitudes of righteous and observant persons; they are left to chance alone. Kalonymus believes that this traditionalist interpretation misconstrues Maimonides' intentions in the Guide. To explain the latter, he offers the following argument. Aristotle's doctrine that God watches over the supernal world (the spheres and the separate intellects) is acceptable; but since the human soul originated in that same supernal world, man,</page><page sequence="10">194 Dov Schwartz JSQ 2 defined as the possessor of a human soul, is subject to that same surveillance (MM, 8b). It follows from this argument that every human being is watched over by Providence; different individuals may differ at most in the level of Providence affecting them, not in its actual existence.18 Thus, Kalonymus has completely undermined the exclusively intellec- tual basis of the Maimonidean theory of Providence. The meaning of Maimonides' assertion in Guide 3:17 'that providence is consequent upon the intellect' is: man, as possessor of a human soul, is ipso facto subject to Providence. The level of a person's intellectual achievement determines the nature and extent to which he is reached by Providence, but not the fact that he is indeed so reached. Moreover, even a righteous person who apprehends spiritual pleasures, though not necessarily devoting all his/her time to the attainment of knowledge, will be granted a suitable measure of Providence in light of his/her spiritual merits. That is the basis, Kalonymus states, for the superiority of the Jewish people, who enjoy a higher level of providential concern than other nations. This is because they received the Torah and the commandments, which elevate the human soul, whether the person concerned belongs to the multitude or to the elite of the scholars and the intellectuals (MM, loc. cit.). In sum: 'Our multitudes and our scholars and all Israel, all alike, share Providence' (MM, loc. cit.);19 or: Providence 'applies to the human species, and to Israel more than to the other nations' (MM, 9a). Not only the intellect, but also the Torah and its commandments are criteria for the applicability of Providence. This leads us to our last point. 3. The Intellection that leads to Providence While discussing the debate over Providence as consequent on the intellect, Kalonymus refers to a traditionalist argument that is not directly concerned with the theory of Providence. According to the argument, which was commonly heard in controversies during the 1220s and 1230s, Maimonides identifies human perfection with the acquisition of general scientific and philosophical knowledge (hokhmot hizoniyot, 'external [= secular] sciences') rather than with knowledge of the Torah and its ways. Kalonymus counters with a series of well-known passages from Maimo- nides' writings in which he refers to the superiority of the Torah over the 'external sciences,' at times in terms of a beloved wife as against rivals and 18 It should be noted that Kalonymus here interprets Maimonides in the light of a clearly neoplatonistic conception of the soul. lhougn Kalonymus is nere ostensibly interpreting Maimomaes, nownere does me latter differentiate between Jews and gentiles in connection with Providence; see M. Kellner, Maimonides on Judaism and the Jewish People, Albany, NY, 1991, pp. 23-26.</page><page sequence="11">(1995) The Debate over The Maimonidean Theory of Providence 195 foreign women, or a queen as against her servants, apothecaries, cooks and bakers (I Samuel 8:13).20 Kalonymus, as far as the nature and content of his understanding of Providence is concerned, takes up a position somewhere between the commentators who upheld the ostensible meaning of the Guide and those who proposed a completely subjective understanding. Among the ad- vocates of the plain meaning one can reckon Abraham, son of Maimo- nides, as well as some later fifteenth-century commentators, such as Asher Cresças and Isaac Abravanel.21 The second category includes Abraham Abulafia and other kabbalists whose thought was inspired by Maimo- nides' works and aimed at interpreting them.22 Although Kalonymus' exegesis is not as far-reaching as Abulafìa's, for example, one may assume that his interpretation of Providence is tendentious, at odds with the manifest implications of Maimonides' text in the Guide; indeed, Maimonides was quite explicit in stipulating that Providence is applicable to the intellectual alone according to level of attainment, but not to the human being qua human. IV. Conclusion It is now possible to summarize the positions in the thirteenth-century debate over the Maimonidean theory of Providence as presented in the Guide. Two questions were at issue. First: Did Maimonides take up a novel, bold position, conflicting with the traditional Rabbinical view? Second: What is the scope of Individual Providence - is it applicable to individuals only or to the human race as a whole? The positions adopted were as follows: (i) The radical rationalist interpretation argued that Maimonides' view, in contrast to that of the 'scholars of our Torah,' holds that only a few persons in each generation are granted providential concern. Providence is an internal matter, with no external expression. 20 MM, 8a, citing from the Epistle to Jonathan of Lunel, Iggerot ha-Rambam, ed. I. Sheilat, Jerusalem, 1988, vol. 2, p. 502. It is noteworthy that the status of philosophy vis- a-vis the authority of Scripture was a central bone of contention in the controversy between rationalists and fundamentalists. 21 See Ravitzky, 'Secrets' (supra, n. 3), pp. 168-169. Ravitzky, op. cit., pp. 172-176; Ch. Wirszubski, 'Liber Redemptionis - an Early Version of a Kabbalistic Commentary on Guide of the Perplexed by R. Abraham Abulafia, in the Latin Translation of Flavius Mithridates' (Hebrew), Proceedings of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities 3 (1969), pp. 135-149.</page><page sequence="12">196 Dov Schwartz JSQ 2 (ii) The traditionalists explained the chapters of the Guide in the same vein as the radicals, but went on to attack Maimonides' theory of Providence. Some of the traditionalists criticized the Guide directly, while others aimed their arguments at Ibn Tibbon's exegesis (e.g., Jacob b. Sheshet). (iii) The moderates argued that Maimonides did not oppose the traditional view. Providence applies to human beings qua humans; the extent of intellectual achievement determines the nature of that Provi- dence but not its very applicability. These arguments illustrate the authority of Maimonides' philosophy shortly after he had written it. The problem of Providence is but one example of the issues debated in the Maimonidean controversy of the thirteenth century. Jewish thinkers of the time debated with equal - if not greater - fervor such subjects as anthropomorphism, immortality and the status of science and philosophy. The theory of Providence may therefore be considered a typical detail in the broad picture of the general cultural and theological atmosphere that prevailed in thirteenth-century Jewry.</page></plain_text>
