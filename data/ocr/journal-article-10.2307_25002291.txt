It never occurred to me, even as I got older and began to explore violence in the Jewish family, that hitting a two-and-a-half-year-old child with a belt buckle was more than inappropriate punishment. My folks were pillars of the Jewish community, and I was a very naughty girl. Later, when I was married to an alcoholic, I sought help from my parents, my rabbi, and finally a psycho therapist. Each one assured me that it was my fault that my husband drank. If only I would change, things would be better. I suffered for many years before I reached the point of desperation that led me to join a Twelve Step program. As a Jew, I was nervous and uncomfortable attending meetings in a church and reciting the Lord's Prayer, but the love and support of the other I would like to acknowledge and thank the women who made my work possible: Drorah O'Donnell Setel, who modeled for me how to facilitate ritual; Marcia Falk, who taught me to hear the language of prayer; Judith Plaskow, who introduced me to theology; Janet Carnay, who helped me to reach inward to the place of the spirit; and B'not Esh, Shabbat Shenit, and the Mikveh Ladies, who dare to create new rituals. I would also like to thank Ellen Umansky and Rebecca Alpert, who helped to shape this paper. Portions of this paper were presented as part of a panel titled "Spirituality for Life" at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Religion, Washington, D.C., 20 November 1993. 1 Andrea Dworkin, Letters from a War Zone: Writings, 1976-1989 (New York: Dutton, 1988), 106.</page><page sequence="2">122 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion members of the program nurtured me in my pain and helped me discover the importance of a higher power in my daily life and my own strength to survive. Because I had such strong cultural and ethnic feelings about Juda ism, I could not turn my back on my religion; rather, I was forced to embrace it and to strive to find a way to make its beliefs work for me. I had to reexamine religious concepts that I had previously accepted without con scious thought.2 At this same time I began to collect prayers and poems by Jewish women as part of a synagogue project.3 As I typed into my manuscript the words of Jewish women through the ages, I experienced their feelings, their pain, their hopes, and their faith, and I took their words into my heart and soul. I identified so strongly with their lives and experiences that I embarked on a journey to redeem their lives as well as my own. While gathering material for this essay, I reread a file of clippings re counting the murder of an Orthodox Jewish woman by her husband; the death of a child at the hands of his Orthodox mother; stories of Reform and Conservative rabbis who had perpetrated sexual abuse on students and congregants; the description of a court battle for custody of a young incest victim in which full visitation rights were given to the perpetrator; and the shocking statistic that 70 percent of women rabbis have been sexually ha rassed. A recent story concerns an Orthodox rabbi and his assistant who were accused of sexually molesting a teenage girl on a flight from Australia to Los Angeles.4 Where was the Jewish community while these terrible events took place? Who protected the victims? Why didn't the people who knew what was happening speak out? approach the perpetrators? socially sanction them? Why was there only silence? Often the only one attacked was the individual who reported the story and dared to reveal a nasty Jewish secret in public. The perpetrators were frequently defended by their communities, their innocence proclaimed. Reading these clippings brought back all of the 2 My story is told in its entirety in "Growing up Jewish" in Four Centuries of Jewish Womens Spirituality: A Sourcebook, ed. Ellen M.

The publication of incidents of murder and abuse by Jews in newspapers such as the Los Angeles Times and the New York Times has forced the Jewish community to face unpleasant truths. Our secret is out. We can no longer pretend that violence and abuse do not take place in Jewish homes. We have to confront this unpleasant reality that has been concealed for ages behind the facade of shalom bayit, peace in the house.5 The sages teach that God seeks peace in the heavens, between the nations on earth, and between husband and wife. They tell us that "the ultimate achievement of peace on earth depends upon its achievement in the smallest social unit-the family. "6 For centuries, Jews created a barrier between themselves and the hostile world around them by presenting the Jewish family as a loving, supportive, protective unit. Shalom bayit, rather than the ideal toward which we strive, became the yardstick by which we measure ourselves. This utopian image is inconsistent with stories that paint quite a different picture. In the Bible and the Talmud, in turn-of-the-century Yiddish fiction, and in letters from the "Bintel Brief," (an advice column in the Jewish Daily Forward), we read about families in trouble, about rape and murder, and about abuse and violence.7 Phyllis Trible calls the biblical horror stories "texts of terror": the casting out of Hagar, the rape of Tamar, the rape and death of the unnamed woman from Bethlehem, and the sacrifice of Jephthah's daughter to her father's pride and vanity.8 Ecclesiasticus (4) informs us that "gold must be hammered and a child must be beaten." The Talmud (Sanh. 51a) debates whether stoning or burning is the appropriate punishment for perpetrators of incest. Both Maimonides in the Mishneh Torah and Joseph Caro in the Shulchan Aruch describe intolerance of wife beating-except, of course, when the wife is not doing her work to the satisfaction of her husband or in the case of some equally justifiable cause; their lengthy discussions suggest that this was not an uncommon problem.9 Now we hear stories of battery and vio 5 Shalom bayit is a combination of the Hebrew sh'lom bayit and the Yiddish shalom bayis.

Community attitudes are slow to respond to new information that con tradicts long-held beliefs. Although a rabbinic task force on spousal abuse was convened to address the problem in Sydney, Australia, I was distressed to learn that an Orthodox rabbi who was present assured the others that if a Jewish man beat his wife, it was only because she deserved it. Although most of those present gasped in dismay, there were many nods of agreement among the other rabbis. For many centuries we women were silenced by our belief in the reality of shalom bayit and suffered indignities without protest to protect the repu tation of our husbands or fathers and to shield the Jewish community from shame. Nevertheless, with the close proximity of families in the shtetls (small Jewish villages in the Pale of Settlement) and in ghettoes such as the lower East Side of New York, the truth could not be hidden from neighbors. It was never, however, a subject for open conversation. Women remained mute, not revealing what happened behind closed doors. With the advent of the feminist movement, however, a strong new message was given to us-that we are fully human and are entitled to be treated as such. In small groups the stories began to be told. Brave women spoke out to others who listened, who heard, and who gave support. We learned that we are not alone and that change is possible. As recently as twenty years ago, Jewish social service agencies rarely saw a client who disclosed sexual or domestic violence. When rabbis, psy chologists, or marriage counselors heard a story of abuse, they were apt to say, "What are you doing to cause the problem? Jewish men don't beat their wives or children . . . or drink ... or commit incest." The victim was blamed for the perpetrator's behavior. When a woman heard this response to her plea for help, as I did, it reinforced the idea that she was the only Jewish woman living in such a situation. Not only did she feel responsible for what was happening to her, she also felt tremendous shame for her own and her family's condition. She might never feel safe enough to risk telling her story to anyone else; she would continue to suffer silently and, possibly even to die. Alternatively, the woman might find help outside the Jewish community, feeling guilty that she was sharing secrets with non-Jews; or she might become involved in a cult where she found spiritual comfort and support. Some women left Judaism; some left home. Some of us, however, decided to change Judaism to include us and our life experiences. We would do the work of tikkun olam, repair of the world. 0 We began to band together to create changes in existing religious institutions 10 See Betsy Giller, "All in the Family: Violence in the Jewish Home," in Jewish Women</page><page sequence="5">Cohn Spiegel: Spirituality for Survival 125 and community organizations; we created new organizations to reach out to others who had been abused; we created support networks; we told our stories to force the world to hear our voices. Our own healing is strengthened and our lives made whole as we reach out to others. In 1987 when Evelyn Torton Beck and I conducted a workshop on sexual abuse and domestic violence at a meeting attended by many Jewish women theologians, rabbis, philosophers, poets, and teachers, we were shocked that of the twenty-three women participating in our workshop, nineteen reported stories of abuse in their childhood. Since then I have found that when I lecture or facilitate a workshop on addiction, spirituality, abuse, or creativity, women (many of whom are leaders in the Jewish feminist spirituality move ment) tell me their stories of sexual abuse and physical violence. I am dis tressed by the stories, but I am no longer shocked. Although I do not believe that everyone who is struggling to change the patriarchy has been physically or sexually abused, I do believe that many women who have been abused are engaged in the struggle to reshape Judaism. In this essay I will describe some of the methods that we are using to survive, to recover, to heal ourselves, and to find a place in Judaism that does not require us to separate into parts: woman, Jew, survivor. To survive, we are seeking the spiritual strength that allows us to go on, to learn to trust again, to believe in a God who will protect and nurture us. In my own recovery I had to reinvent God for myself so that I could awaken each day with a sense of purpose and joy. Healing does not take place in a moment. Healing is a process that begins with naming the pain and deciding to grapple with it. One ritual act, whether traditional or newly created, or one piece of creative liturgy is not a panacea. Rather, these are first steps on a path of reentry into the Jewish community that many of us felt had aban doned us in our time of need. By framing these rituals, liturgies, and images within Jewish tradition, we create a comfortable setting to introduce a Jew ish, feminist, spiritual dimension to the process of recovery. Some of these practices will be familiar, because feminists from many different religions are engaged in examining the same issues; others are uniquely Jewish. Speaking to God I begin by looking at how we address God. Many of us who have suffered abuse and betrayal by father, husband, rabbi, teacher, or another trusted man in our life can no longer pray to the "Lord our God, King of the Universe" of the traditional Jewish blessing formula. We cannot find solace in Therapy, ed. Rachel Josefowitz Siegel and Ellen Cole (New York: Harrington Park Press, 1991), 101-9; and Mimi Scarf, Battered Jewish Wives (Lewiston, N.Y.: Edwin Mellen, 1988).</page><page sequence="6">126 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion and comfort in an anthropomorphic God envisioned as father, judge, or ruler; even shepherd does not seem a benign image. We have difficulty praying to a transcendent God who rules over the world and acts in history. Where was he while we suffered? Why didn't he take care of us? Why did he abandon us?ll We need a God of immanence, a nurturing, caring, protec tive deity who is present in our daily lives-a God we can trust in, who helps us to find peace. Some contemporary Jewish women seeking these qualities in God found them embodied in the ancient concept of Shekhinah, the indwelling pres ence. 12 She has become central in many women's prayers, rituals, and songs. She is a manifestation of deity capable of being perceived by the human senses. Although feminist scholars have noted that in Jewish mystical texts, Shekhinah often functions as "the ambiguous male projection of what woman can be-nursemaid, mother, bride, wife, but also wanton seductress, de vouring monster and bringer of death,"13 Shekhinah becomes a usable image for feminists when it is wrenched free from its original context. As Judith Plaskow has written, the tradition then "becomes a starting point for an imaginative process that moves beyond and transforms it."14 Many women in search of an image and a language to use in prayer and ritual have found Shekhinah a source of nurturance and support. Indeed, those women who are seeking symbols and models from traditional Judaism have redefined the concept of Shekhinah, adapting her to meet their needs. In my own search to find a "higher power," I was alienated by the image of a bearded patriarch in the sky. I found my solace and strength in an un named force that surrounded me, protected me, empowered me. Listening to the words of Debbie Friedman's song "The Angels' Blessing," I came to recognize that force as Shekhinah: May our right hand bring us closer to our godliness, May our left hand give us strength to face each day, And before us may our visions light our paths ahead And behind us may well-being heal our way. All around us is Shechinah, all around us is Shechinah.15 1l See David Blumenthal, Facing the Abusing God: A Theology of Protest (Louisville: Presbyterian Publishing House, 1993). 12 In the Hebrew Bible, the name Shekhinah (from the verb meaning "to dwell") refers to the manifestation of God's presence. Although it is grammatically feminine, as there is no neuter in Hebrew, the biblical Shekhinah is not feminine in gender. By the Middle Ages, however, Jewish mystics began to describe Shekhinah as the feminine aspect of God. 13 Judith Plaskow, "God: Reimaging the Unimaginable," in Standing Again at Sinai: Judaism from a Feminist Perspective (San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row, 1990), 140. 14 Ibid. 15 "The Angels' Blessing," ? 1991 by Deborah Lynn Friedman, ASCAP, Sounds Write Productions, ASCAP.</page><page sequence="7">Cohn Spiegel: Spirituality for Survival 127 Early attempts to exchange feminine for masculine nouns and pronouns referring to God were rarely successful. These changes lost the internal rhythm of the traditional prayers, were jarring on the ear, and substituted a feminine hierarchical figure for a masculine one. They did, however, pave the way for new metaphors and images. Marcia Falk was one of the first Jewish women to explore traditional sources for nonanthropomorphic names and images of God that retain the power and beauty of language and image in both Hebrew and English. Her Book of Blessings presents a whole new lexicon of ways to address God.16 In one of her new blessing formulas, the worshipers take on the power of blessing as we become partners with God in doing the work of blessing: "N'varekh et ein ha-hayiym ... [Let us bless the source of life . . . ].17 One recent attempt to solve the dilemma of naming God was created for High Holy Day services at a Los Angeles women's prayer group, Shabbat Shenit.'8 The prayer Avinu Malkenu, "Our Father, our King," is a focal point of the High Holy Day liturgy. The frequent repetition of the names and images of God as Father and King, in Hebrew and in English, in a prayer central to the season of atonement is profoundly disturbing not only to abused women but to other men and women as well. The solution of Shabbat Shenit was to sing the traditional melody of the prayer while introducing a variety of new names and images, including "our Father, our King" but also adding alternatives: Mothering Spirit, Shekhinah, Merciful Parent, Infinite Wisdom, Indwelling Presence, and others. Singing new words to the ancient prayer was, for many of those present, both men and women, a profoundly important and moving experience. Retaining the familiar melody grounded the prayer in tradition while at the same time the discomfiting text was altered. Rabbi Burt Jacobson of the Berkeley Kehilla adds other names and images: our Mother, our Teacher, our Father, our Guide, our Source, our Destiny, our Truth, our Way. As we explore new language, metaphors, and images, we should be aware of problems inherent in making these changes. If names and descrip tions of God are related to primary figures in our individual histories, no single alternative will work for everyone. Feminine God-language might be attractive to a woman who was abused by her father, but it may not meet the needs of someone who was abused by her mother. Sons as well as daughters are abused; both women and men are abused; women as well as 16 Marcia Lee Falk, The Book of Blessings: A Feminist Jewish Reconstruction of Prayer (San Francisco: HarperSanFrancisco, in press). 17 Marcia Falk, "Notes on Composing New Blessings: Toward a Feminist-Jewish Recon struction of Prayer," Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion 3 (Spring 1987): 39-53. 18 Judith Glass and Shoshana Gershenzon, "Rosh Hashonah Service for Shabbat Shenit" (Los Angeles, September 1992).</page><page sequence="8">128 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion men are perpetrators. While we are still suffering, any gendered references to God may be problematic. References to power, might, and even protection and caring may trigger strong feelings of abandonment and may remind us of our betrayal. As we move into recovery, will we be able to accept a broader vision of the nurturing, healing qualities in masculine images and the powerful, protective vision in feminine images? Will we find comfort in nonanthropo morphic descriptions such as "the source of life," "the breath of all living things," and "the unseen sparks"?19 Do we need to image God as Being in order to feel in relationship with God? Will we find the courage to begin to express our rage at a God by whom we have felt betrayed and to rediscover our belief in a God who will not only protect us from harm but also empower us to protect ourselves? Transforming Familiar Rituals Religious rituals, rites, ceremonies, and even folk traditions play a role in family celebrations, life-cycle events, and death and mourning. Some are performed in the formal setting of the synagogue, others in the home. These rituals represent moments of transition: joy and sorrow, life and death. Using elements of worship that are part of traditional practice may give a new ritual the emotional resonance that makes it effective in healing and recov ery. Although the following discussion describes rituals for women or girls, most can be adapted for use by men or boys who are on the road to recovery. One of the oldest religious rites is that of ritual immersion, mikveh, described in Leviticus 15. Ritual immersion was required to achieve a state of purity before entering the Temple in Jerusalem. It was also performed by both men and women as a cleansing act after any bodily discharge.2 After the destruction of the Temple, the laws of mikveh applied only to women, regulating the ongoing cycle of menstruation, contamination, and purification known as family purity. Many contemporary women consider their control of conjugal relations and of their activities during menstruation, as well as the rigorous physical examination required prior to resuming marital sex after childbirth or menstruation, an onerous and humiliating experience. For traditionally observant Jews, however, the laws of family purity are considered important in maintaining the sanctity of the Jewish home and the enhancement of the spiritual life of the Jewish woman. The act of immersion, with its powerful metaphor of achieving a state of purity as well as physical and spiritual rebirth, has become attractive to 19 Falk, "Notes on Composing New Blessings," 46, 53. 20 See Howard Eilberg-Schwartz, "Menstrual Blood, Semen, and Discharge" and "The Status Impurity," in The Savage in Judaism (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1990): 177-194 and 195-216.</page><page sequence="9">Cohn Spiegel: Spirituality for Survival 129 women who seek to perform rituals of cleansing and purification.2' The ceremonies of healing in which I have participated took place not in ritual baths managed by observant Jews, but rather in rivers, streams, hot tubs, and swimming pools made holy by the spirituality of the acts.22 Women recovering from incest, childhood abuse, or wife battering immersed them selves, surrounded by friends who floated them, supported them, and cir cled them with love, and they emerged feeling cleansed and healed. I know of women who felt so humiliated and degraded following a traditional divorce that cleansing in such a mikveh ceremony restored some of their lost dignity.23 The association of the purity of water and its healing powers occurs in the book of Exodus in the story of how Miriam saved her brother Moses by putting him into the river where he was rescued by the Pharaoh's daughter. Later tales connected Miriam to a miraculous well that provided water for the wanderers in the desert and that disappeared when she died. Miriam's name is now used in a blessing of water. For many women who have been abused and violated and for whom struggles with alcoholism and addiction are an ongoing battle, the traditional blessing of wine, recited every Sabbath and on all festivals and holy days, is not an acknowledgment of God's grace. The introduction by the feminist spirituality community of Kos Miryam, the cup of Miriam, which blesses water, or mayim khayyim, the water of life, provides a different source of blessing, including as it does metaphors of both purity and sustenance.24 A ceremony developed by a women's group, Kol Isha, includes the following blessing: Zot Kos Miryam. Kos Mayim Khayyim, Khazak Khazak V'Nitkhazeik. This is the Cup of Miriam, the Cup of Living Waters. Strength, 21 See Rachel Adler, "In Your Blood, Live: Re-visions of a Theology of Purity," Tikkun, January 1993, 38-41. In The Jewish Catalog (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1973), 167-71, Adler valorized the traditional concept of mikveh. In the recent article she repudiates her earlier work and acknowledges that "When Jewish women who are not Orthodox appropriated my reframing of immersion in the mikveh to mark occurrences for which no ritual expression had existed, they taught me an important lesson about the possibility of salvage. They began using the mikveh to purify themselves of events that had threatened their lives or left them feeling wounded or bereft or sullied as sexual beings" (41). 22 The first such ritual in which I participated was conceived and facilitated by Drorah O'Donnell Setel. 23 A healing mikveh ritual for recovery from rape can be found in Laura Levitt and Sue Ann Wasserman, "Mikvah Ceremony for Laura (1989)," in Umansky and Ashton (cited above, n. 2), 321-26. A meditation for the mikveh is presented by Jane Litman, "Meditation for the Mikveh," in Lifecycles: Jewish Women on Life Passages and Personal Milestones, ed. Debra Orenstein (Woodstock, Vt.: Jewish Lights, 1994), 253-54. 24 Although some rabbis believed that a person should not bless water (e.g., R. Isaac ben Abdimi, Berakoth 44b), Rabbi Tarfon in Eruvin (14b) ruled that the benediction"</page><page sequence="10">130 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion Strength and may we be Strengthened ....

It is not only a time when families come together to tell the story of the Exodus and to dine on a sumptuous meal, but also a time when family relationships, ten sions, and expectations are heightened. The seder has become an important event for the women's community as a time to examine the role of women, and for women in recovery it is a special time to create a ceremony to honor their healing journey. Seders are held on the first two evenings of Passover. Four cups of wine or grape juice are drunk as part of the ritual. A special cup of wine for the prophet Elijah, who is expected to announce the coming of the Messiah, is one of the ritual symbols; some women are now adding another symbol, Kos Miryam, to symbolize women's redemption. The name Mitzrayim (Egypt) is translated as "from the narrow place." The image of the struggle to come through the narrow place to a place of freedom has resonance for many women, because it becomes a metaphor for birth. Many Jewish women have begun to celebrate a third, feminist seder that addresses their specific needs and that recounts the story of women's bravery, courage, and struggle.26 One such telling is a service created by survivors of spousal abuse at the Los Angeles Family Violence Project of Jewish Family Service, validating their journey to freedom and a new life.27 Rosh Hodesh, the celebration of the new moon, has been reclaimed as a woman's celebration and is another appropriate time for ceremonies of healing and recovery from violence and abuse. All over the world, Jewish women, spanning the spectrum from secular to religious, gather on the eve . . . who createst many living beings with their wants, for all the means that thou hast created" should be said. Some taught that a man who drinks water on account of his thirst must say " ... by whose word all things exist." 25 Matia Angelou, "Kos Miryam: Development of a Women's Ritual," Neshama (Summer 1990), 1-2.

In the Talmud we are told that women are not permitted to work on Rosh Hodesh (Meg. 22b). We are also told that it is a time to wear new clothes, eat newly ripened fruit, and begin a new book (Ta'an. 15b). Tradition tells us that Rosh Hodesh was given to women as a reward for saving their jewelry for the creation of the ark rather than for the casting of the golden calf (Perkei de-R. Eliezer 45). Because we don't know exactly how it was celebrated in the past, women are creating our own rituals. Many Rosh Hodesh groups read and discuss a biblical text about women, relate it to their own experience, and give it a new interpretation. The groups are often small, and the intimate setting provides a safe environment where women who have been abused can feel safe telling their stories and gaining the support and acknowledgment they need from other Jewish women. It has been my experience that when one woman tells her story, other women are given the courage to share theirs. Groups are often amazed to learn how many members have been abused. Together the work of healing can begin. Another ceremony that lends itself to rituals of healing and recovery is Havdalah, the ceremony that marks the close of the Sabbath. Havdalah is a short, simple ceremony that takes place on Saturday evening after the first three stars appear, marking the transition from the holiness of the Sabbath to the week that is starting. Blessings are recited over braided candles, wine or grape juice, and spices. Songs are sung remembering the peace of the Sabbath day and anticipating the arrival of the prophet Elijah. The sensory richness of the candlelight, wine, spices, and music, and the clear demarca tion between the holy and the profane allow multiple interpretations of the meaning of separation. Women have begun to use this rite to create a separa tion from the pain of abuse and to mark a return to a state of wholeness and healing. Creating New Rituals In addition to creating ceremonies that reframe tradition, women are introducing new rituals that use familiar symbols, prayers, and music.29 Sav ina Teubal created a new celebration for her sixtieth birthday, a Simchat 28 See Penina V.

I adapted the Havdalah service as an appropriate transition from the turmoil following the deaths of my husband and parents. I wanted to mark my own recovery as I entered a new stage of life. I accepted the inevitability of aging, assumed full respon sibility for my life and its consequences, and let go of my anger and blame for past events. Preparing the service enabled me to focus on the lessons of my life, what I chose to retain and what I chose to release, remembering that life is part of an eternal cycle.31 I combined familiar elements with new prayers and music so that the service would be comfortable to the congregation despite the innovations, such as sukkat shalom, a tent of peace. Friends who were in need of healing for physical and mental pain came forward to be wrapped in my grandfather's tallith (prayer shawl) while Debbie Friedman sang a prayer of healing, "Mi Shebeirach": May the Source of strength Who blessed the ones before us, Help us find the courage To make our lives a blessing, And let us say, Amen .... Bless all in need of healing with . . . The renewal of body, The renewal of spirit, And let us say, Amen.32 Changing one's name or adding a new name is another way to mark a new stage of life. When Avram made a covenant with God, his name was changed to Abraham and his wife, Sarai, became Sarah. A convert to Judaism takes on a Jewish name. According to folk custom, the name of a dying person might be changed to outwit the hovering angel of death. At her own Simchat Hochmah service, Savina Teubal took on the name Sarah because of Savina's identification with the biblical Sarah. Our names define us; a new name can redefine us. Names may be reminders of events and people with whom we want to disassociate ourselves. A new name can help us see our selves in a new light. 30 See Savina J. Teubal, "Simchat Hochmah," in Umansky and Ashton, 257-65. 31 Drorah O'Donnell Setel helped me plan the service and acted as facilitator, Debbie Friedman wrote several new songs for the occasion, and Marcia Falk led her newly created Havdalah service.

The cloth was held aloft by friends, just as a huppah (a wedding canopy) might be held. Together we recited the blessing, which Marcia Falk had written for Savina: Let us sing the soul in every name, and the names of every soul.33 I chose to take the biblical name Miriam because of my identification with the prophet's bravery and because of her survival in the face of adver sity. I use my new name whenever I am honored by being called to the Torah. You can imagine my pride when, on the occasion of her adult bat mitzvah ceremony, my daughter Linda was called to read from the Torah as the daughter of Miriam. Both Savina and I changed our garments during our services; we each donned a kitel, a white garment normally given to men for their wedding and thereafter worn for Passover and Yom Kippur services and, ultimately, as their shroud. I changed from the black of mourning to the white of hope as I recognized the inevitability of death as part of life's cycle. Each time I now don this kitel, for Passover seder or Yom Kippur, I am reminded of my hopes for renewal and recovery. Savina and I also each planted a tree, recognizing that we sow now for others to reap. We each made promises for our lives, our own covenant with God.34 My vow was to continue in the work of helping others move into recovery and heal their wounds. As a word of teaching, I told stories from my life. Storytelling has tradi tionally been a way for women to share with others the truth of our lives. Through stories, we can use the life of another woman to represent our own experiences; we can portray evil at its worst and heroism at its finest; we can express our sorrow and our outrage. Through stories, we can experience redemption, even justice. This ancient custom has become part of the crea tion of new rituals for all women and is a powerful tool for women recovering from abuse. One exciting use of storytelling as ritual took place on the night of a midsummer full moon, Tu be-Av (the fifteenth day of the month of Av [Mishnah Ta'an. 4:8]). A group of women gathered out-of-doors to exchange white garments and to retell the story of the sacrifice of Jephthah's daughter by her father to fulfill his rash pledge to God. We also told of the kidnapping of the daughters of Shiloh following the rape and murder of the unnamed 33 ? 1987 by Marcia Lee Falk. 34 These two rituals and other midlife celebrations are described in Irene Fine, Midlife, A Rite of Passage and The Wise Woman, A Celebration (San Diego: Woman's Institute for Continuing Jewish Education, 1988).</page><page sequence="14">134 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion concubine of Bethlehem. Under the bright light of the moon, we turned the stories around, adding women's redemption and survival to these tales of murder, rape, and abuse. We sang and danced in exultation.35 For most of Jewish history, retelling and interpreting biblical stories, creating Mid rash, was exclusively a male activity; as women add their voices, new mean ings are coming out of old stories, and new understanding from traditional texts. Although I have described only ceremonies in which I have participated, many other new ceremonies are being developed as women seek a path to healing that utilizes Jewish ritual, is grounded in the past, and allows move ment into the future. Each Jewish holiday, season, and celebration offers additional symbols to be adapted and used for transforming our lives and for healing from abuse. Incorporated into a new ceremony, these symbols still resonate with tradition. Rites of joy and celebration, as well as other rites, may allow us to act out our rage. More than one ritual will probably be needed as a woman moves through the process of recovery. Different stages of recovery can be marked by different rituals. It is important to remember that what works for one woman may not be appropriate for another. A woman who has negative associations with mikvah may not want to use immersion as a rite of purifica tion. A woman who is uncomfortable exposing her body to others will not find spiritual strength if she is forced to disrobe, even with her friends. A woman who has not been involved in Jewish ritual life may find meaning in ceremonies that will provoke quite a negative response from a woman who comes from a traditional background. Sensitivity to each individual must be the guide. The recovering woman should participate in the planning so that the ritual will meet her needs at that moment. As she moves forward in recovery, her needs will change and so must the rituals created for her. Repentance and Reconciliation The High Holy Day season is a time of repentance and reconciliation. Elul, the month preceding the New Year, Rosh Hashanah, is supposed to be spent doing the work of atonement, making amends to those whom we have wronged and healing spiritual and emotional wounds. This solemn time culminates in the Day of Atonement, the Yom Kippur service. The Kol Nidrei prayer, recited on the eve of Yom Kippur, is one of the most solemn prayers in Hebrew liturgy. It is chanted three times as Jews ask forgiveness for their transgressions against God. (Transgressions against another person can only be forgiven by that person.) A contemporary interpretation of the 35 See Jane Litman, "Women's Folk Judaism," Lilith, Fall 1991, 6.</page><page sequence="15">Cohn Spiegel: Spirituality for Survival 135 Kol Nidrei prayer is to allow ourselves to forgive our shortcomings as we vow to behave differently in the year ahead; we can use this time of introspec tion to rewrite our life's script. It is a time of cleansing, purification, and renewal. For all Jews it is a time of healing. These holy days are often a particularly stressful time for survivors of abuse because of the focus on forgiveness. How do survivors live with the painful memories of acts of cruelty perpetrated against them, acts that are truly unforgivable? Judaism does not teach us to grant automatically forgive ness to those who have wronged us. Rather, it is the wrongdoers who must come forward to ask for forgiveness for their deeds. It is they who must do teshuvah. Teshuvah means to turn-to turn away from evil, to turn toward good, to return to God. In the twelfth century, Maimonides ("Hilkot Teshuvah," Sefer ha-Madda) described four steps of teshuvah: regret or remorse for one's actions, renunciation of the behavior, confession of the wrong and a plea for forgiveness, and finally a pledge to change one's life so as not to repeat the act. The proof that one has done teshuvah is that when confronted with the same scenario, one behaves differently. The dilemma for the victim of abuse is how to relate to a perpetrator who does not admit to the evil, who does not take responsibility for his or her deeds. How do you heal or feel complete when someone whom you loved and trusted betrayed that trust and does not make any effort to bind up the wounds? How do you interact with your family when the perpetrator is safe and secure while you are forced to flee? How do you respond to parents, grandparents, or other family members who act as if nothing has happened to you, who may even blame you for being a reminder of a part of themselves that they would like to forget? Why does a daughter or son refuse to celebrate a holiday with the family, come home for Passover, or attend a wedding or a bat or bar mitzvah? One friend of mine, after re minding her mother that she had not yet come to terms with her father's acts of rape and incest, was told by her mother, "But that was so long ago. You should forget about it. Let bygones be bygones." For someone who is still suffering from flashbacks and night terrors, who is struggling to recreate herself, "forgetting about it" is impossible. In addition to her pain, she feels the denial and abandonment of her family, another betrayal. If the perpetrator of the violence or abuse is dead, the problem may be complicated for the survivor. The yearly cycle of Jewish holidays contains many special moments to honor and remember the dead.36 Yizkor, a memor 36 A complete description of Jewish mourning customs is contained in Anne Brener, Mourning and Mitzvah: A Guided Journal for Walking the Mourner's Path through Grief to Healing (Woodstock, Vt.: Jewish Lights, 1993), 217.</page><page sequence="16">136 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion ial service, is part of the worship service on each of the four major holidays, Yom Kippur, Succoth, Passover, and Shavuot. During Yizkor we ask God to remember close family members who have died. Kaddish, the traditional prayer for the dead, is recited by the mourners. The Kaddish prayer, said in community with a minyan (quorum) of ten people, is recited daily for thirty days following a death in the family. When a parent dies, Kaddish is recited daily for a year. After the initial period of mourning, Kaddish is recited on the anniversary of the death as well as at the four Yizkor services. In Orthodox synagogues only men are counted in a minyan; therefore, only men say Kaddish. In Reform, Reconstructionist, and most Conservative synagogues, women are counted in the minyan and can recite the prayer. How do victims of abuse memorialize a dead parent, spouse, or sibling who did not do the work of teshuvah, who never acknowledged his or her behavior or asked forgiveness? How is that person eulogized by the commu nity if his or her acts were known? if they were secret? Do we say Kaddish? Do we attend Yizkor services? How can that time of memory be used to reconcile our feelings of loss, anger, and betrayal so that we can move beyond them? Those of us who have not shared our story of abuse will be reminded of the pain each time Kaddish is recited. If we continue to worship in our familiar synagogue, we will hear the perpetrator's name read "in loving memory"; we will receive notices of the anniversary of the death every year, and we will sit in services where parents, spouses, children, and siblings are remembered for their loving, caring, nurturing presence on earth. The very act of putting up a headstone on the grave becomes a reminder of abuse. For some of us victims of abuse, the first step toward healing may be an opportunity to express rage, anger, disappointment, loss, and betrayal. Most of us have been trained to keep these feelings to ourselves, and ex pressing them is frightening both to us and to those around us. There is fear that we will become uncontrollable. Society is quick to demand forgive ness for acts perpetrated against victims but does not allow us to express our feelings. Jewish ritual provides many opportunities for an individual to express remorse for the sins that he or she has committed and for which he or she must atone. No such prayer or ceremony exists, however, for express ing the feelings of a victim whose perpetrator does not acknowledge the wrong. It is possible that a ceremony, as part of a formal ritual, can provide us with an opportunity to express this anger in a safe, controlled setting. Keening and mourning rituals may be very useful; donning dark clothes, sitting on low stools, wailing and lamenting the lost inner child, releasing her spirit to allow it to grow and change might prove to be comforting. Other symbolic actions might involve breaking, tearing, crying, burning, casting out, and separation. By performing these ritual acts, we may be able to let go of the rage and move forward in recovery.</page><page sequence="17">Cohn Spiegel: Spirituality for Survival 137 Conclusion Following Maimonides' steps, the Jewish community can begin to do the work of teshuvah by speaking out and telling the truth. We can stop pretending that Jews are different from other people and accept the reality that physical and sexual abuse happens in "nice Jewish families." We can recognize that shalom bayit, peace in the house, is a goal toward which we strive, not a measure of who we are. Each family responds to the stresses of life in different ways, some functional, some dysfunctional. We do the best we can, and if we fall short of the sages' ideal, we recognize that we are human. It is not the community's shame when an individual fails. Rather, it is the responsibility of the community to recognize the problems, to reach out to the victims and encourage those who are suffering to seek help when they are in pain and in need of healing, and to provide a safe environment for that healing to take place. Other steps to teshuvah are vowing to change our ways and not continu ing on the wrong path. We are beginning this work of tikkun olam (changing and repairing the world) by reaching out to each other. We are advocating that synagogues and Jewish family agencies address the needs of those who are abused. We are working within our community and with other communi ties to make sure our voices are heard. We are doing healing in ceremonies, rituals, and new celebrations using stories and song; adapting old customs with new meanings; and banding together to force political and institutional changes. The work has only begun. We seek shlemut (from the root of shalom), which means "wholeness, harmony, completion." With shlemut we can achieve personal integrity, join ing together the fragments of our souls, our bodies, and our psyches; we can reach out to family and community.37 In The Guide for the Perplexed, Maimonides sees this completion as the result of our unity with God, which manifests itself in our behavior.38 According to Rabbi Nachman of Bretslav, a human being reaches in three directions: inward to self, outward to other people, and upward to God. The secret, he adds, is that the three are one. When we are connected to self, we can reach out to others; when we reach out to others, we may come to know God.39 Rabbi Tarfon tells us that "you are not expected to finish the task, but neither are you free to evade it" (Avot 2:21). And so we begin. 37 Thanks to Rabbi Denise Eger for teaching me the concept of shlemut as it applies to personal integrity, and to Rabbi Ronald J. Shulman both for sharing his Rosh Hashanah and Yizkor sermons and for doing additional research on the concept of shlemut. 38 Maimonides, The Guide for the Perplexed, trans. M.
