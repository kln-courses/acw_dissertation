HELM Oberlin College summary: I examine genealogical metaphors and related causal statements in the plays of Aeschylus, particularly the Oresteia, and demonstrate how, when taken together, they present a systematic view of ethical behavior and its conse quences, necessary for a comprehensive understanding of Aeschylean thought. While Aeschylus' perspective falls firmly within the Solonian tradition of koros hybris-ate, he adds piety?mortals' recognition of their common subordination to the divine, which encourages them to respect the human status of others?as an essential element for human behavior. Piety is an essential prerequisite for justness, particularly important for Aeschylus because of his identification of Zeus with justice. I.

An old saying was fashioned long ago among mortals: once it has become great, a person's success bears offspring and does not die childless, but from good fortune for a family sprouts forth unending misery. 1 Except where otherwise noted the Greek text of Aeschylus is Page. Translations are my own.</page><page sequence="2">24 James J. Helm Thus the Chorus in the Agamemnon gives expression to the common and pessimistic Greek belief that human success brings unhappiness. The genea logical metaphor used in this passage is striking. Tekvo?gGou, together with the adjective ocTioci?a (754), delineates graphically and effectively the close causal connection traditionally seen between good fortune and misery. Great success gives birth (that is to say, leads inevitably) to ruin. Such a use of genealogy to express relationships between concepts is not original with Aeschylus; it is found in a number of archaic Greek writers, notably Hesiod, whose Theogonyis an extended genealogy not only of the gods but also of the physical, social, and psychological features of the universe. We generally understand Hesiod's use of theogony as a metaphorical portrayal of the relationships between the various powers of nature, society, and hu man psychology, including those values like justice that we consider abstract.2 When Hesiod makes Dike the daughter of Zeus, for example, what he asserts is not simply that the goddess was the physical offspring of Zeus (though he may indeed have believed that); more important, he means that Justice some how emanates from Zeus, concerns him personally, and is a direct product of his reign in heaven. Norman Brown (8) remarks, "In Hesiod's myth-language, the character of a divine power is revealed in his children." Herbert Abel has traced the development in early Greek poetry of the ge nealogy of ethical concepts in particular (92-101). He observes that this metaphor springs naturally from the anthropomorphic way the Greeks thought about their gods?that is, about the forces outside and beyond the human individual. Particular personal beings with individual characteristics, he maintains, are always more easily grasped than abstract ideas, and the metaphor of the family tree asserts important relationships between them. Hesiod, of course, uses the image of biological descent in a thorough and systematic way so that it becomes the organizing principle of his whole Theogony. The pervasive use of procreation and descent in his work suggests that he thought of the genealogies as something more than metaphor, indeed as the embodiment of basic truths about reality and nature, for which pro creation is of such great importance. The same is true of Aeschylus' use of the metaphor; as in Hesiod, it appears to be a statement of fundamental causal relationships between modes of human behavior on the one hand, and hu man happiness or misery on the other. 2 As Solmsen (114-15) says, "Hesiod, we may be sure, knew that Strife leads to?or produces?Toil, Hunger, Forgetfulness, and many other loathsome entities, but his 'theo logical' bent led him to conceive what we should call a causal relationship in terms of the birth of one divine entity from another." See also Brown's Introduction.</page><page sequence="3">Aeschylus' Genealogy of Morals 25 In what follows I examine several genealogical metaphors and related causal statements in the plays of Aeschylus, particularly the Oresteia, and demon strate how, when taken together, they present a systematic view of ethical behavior and its consequences. My main intent is to delineate as clearly as I can the causal chain, which is of core importance for any comprehensive understanding of Aeschylean thought. II. ANTECEDENT NOTIONS To return to the passage with which we began, Aeschylus has the Chorus use a genealogical metaphor when citing the traditional notion that great wealth or good fortune leads to misery: ?X?oc (olbos) gives birth to oi?u? (oizus). Therefore it is better to be poor and obscure than to risk the retaliation of Zeus for great success (cf. the Chorus' worries in A. 468-71). This "old say ing" refers to the age-old notion of the (pOovo? Gecov (phthonos the?n), which asserts that whenever humans are fortunate, the gods become jealous of their position and bring them low. The mere fact of prosperity brings with it its inevitable reversal. But this notion is raised by the Chorus only to be rejected. For, after pre senting the "old saying" with its assertion of a direct connection between pros perity and ruin, they go on to propose an alternate view, one that they claim to be uniquely theirs (A. 757-62): ?i%oc S' ?XX(?v uovocppc?v e? u? to 5\)GGe?ec yocp ?pyov liera jLi?v nXeiova xiKxei, ocpex?pai ?' e?K?xoc y?vvoci o?kcov ycep euOD?iKCov KaXX?naiq rcoTUo? a?e?. But apart from others I hold a singular opinion. For the impious act bears more afterwards, things like their own parent. For the fate of just houses is always a beautiful child. Success by itself does not lead to misery, they maintain; impious acts do. The clear implication is that it is actually impiety and the acts that result from it that lead directly (or indirectly) to misery. This statement comes in the sec ond stasimon of the play after several stanzas on "the lion cub that turns" (Helen) and on the dire effects of the crime Paris has committed. Immedi ately after the Chorus introduces the notion of divine retribution (an Erinys,</page><page sequence="4">26 James J. Helm 749) for the violation of guest-friendship, they present the view just cited that it is not wealth but impiety that leads to misery. The violation of guest-friendship is such an act of impiety against Zeus Xenios. They go on to assert that a house that acts justly, by contrast?presumably even a prosperous one?has a fate that is a beautiful child (koc???tcoci? rcoxuo?), i.e., a good fate.3 There is no inevitable calamity for the successful, but one's happiness depends on how such success is handled. Aeschylus was not the first to question the tradition of success automati cally leading to disaster. Earlier poets had already viewed the relationship as rather more complex. Solon (6.3-4 West) sees a progression from ?A?oc (olbos) to KOpo? (koros4) to ??pic (hybris): x?K?ei y?p KOpo? u?piv, ?xav rco??? ?^?oc ?7cr|xai ?vGpo?moic ?7C?OOIC |if| voo? apxio? f|i.5 For surfeit gives birth to arrogance, whenever much success comes to humans whose mind is not sound. His use of the birth metaphor here is the first appearance of a genealogical sequence of moral characteristics of this sort. By it Solon asserts that surfeit (koros)?too much wealth or success (olbos)?produces arrogance (hybris).6 Elsewhere he makes it clear that it is arrogance that leads to ruin (ate; 13.9? 13 West): 3 This last phrase is the subject of some dispute, but the context suggests that the trans lation above gives the general sense. Verrall (95) comments, "KaKkinaiq tcOxjio? com bines in one phrase the ideas that the prosperity of the house is reproduced in successive generations, and that this prosperity is itself the child of righteousness, as misery is of sin." This may be claiming rather much for the phrase but is, I believe, on the right track. In any case, prosperity is seen as the result of justness. 4 See Helm. 5 This distich is one of several in Solon that also appear in Theognis, sometimes with slight though here insignificant variations (153-54 West): "xiicxei y??&gt; KOpo? ??piv, ?xocv kockcoi ?A?oc ercriTai / ?vGpamcoi Kai ?xcoi \n\ voo? apxio? fji." 6 Fisher, in his masterful analysis of the meanings of hybris, defines it in this way (1): "... hybris is essentially the serious assault on the honour of another, which is likely to cause shame, and lead to anger and attempts at revenge. Hybris is often, but by no means necessarily, an act of violence; it is essentially deliberate activity, and the typical motive for such infliction of dishonour is the pleasure of expressing a sense of superiority, rather than compulsion, need or desire for wealth. Hybris is often seen to be characteristic of the young, and/or of the rich and/or upper classes; it is often associated with drunken ness. Hybris thus most often denotes specific acts or general behaviour directed against others, rather than attitudes;..."</page><page sequence="5">Aeschylus' Genealogy of Morals 27 TlXoVTOV ... ov ?' ocv?pe? xijucaow ixp' iS?pioc, o\) kocxoc koouov epxexai, ?XX' oc??koi? epyjiaai 7i?i6o|i?vo? o?k ?GeJtoov 87iexai, xax?co? ?' ?vauiayexai axni. Wealth... that men honor through arrogance does not come in an orderly manner, but when obeying unjust deeds it follows unwillingly and is quickly mixed with ruin.7 So, though Solon agrees with the view that success may lead to misery, he specifies that it does so not automatically but rather via surfeit and its atten dant arrogant pride.8 This becomes a traditional theme, as is shown by Aeschylus' contempo rary Pindar, who observes in Pythian 2 that the great sinner Ixion was not able to abide great success, but in his arrogance made an attempt on Hera. This act of hybris, of course, brought disaster (25-29): e?liev?aai yocp rcapoc Kpovi?ou? y?U)ia)v kX?v ?ioxov, uxxKp?v ox&gt;% ?m?jieivev 6X ?ov, iiaivouivai?

Fisher does broaden the definition, however, in the remainder of the sentence left incomplete above: "... it may, though, on occasion, especially in more reflective or philo sophical texts, denote the drive or the desire, in a specific individual, or in humans gen erally, to engage in such behaviour directed against others." For reasons I shall explain later, I believe that Aeschylus (in this "more reflective text") puts the emphasis on the attitude. Cairns (52) offers some corrective to Fisher in noting that hybris can accommo date self-assertion even in the absence of a victim. Philippides fr. 27 (Kassel-Austin) pro vides a reference to the necessary element of violence: "Anyone who uses violence against a weak person is guilty of hybris, not hamartia (i)?pt^?iv, ox&gt;x ?jmxpx?veiv ?oke?; cited by Kopffon the Classics list: http://omega.cohums.ohio-state.edu:8080/hyper-lists/clas sics-l/99-02-01/0269.html). 7 Or, "and ruin is quickly mixed in." The grammatical case of the final word of the Greek is uncertain, but whether nominative or dative ate must appear after arrogance. On ate as "ruin" here see n. 10 below. 8 See also Theognis 605-6,693-94, and 1173-76 (West) for similar ideas.</page><page sequence="6">28 James J. Helm For, although from the benevolent offspring of Kronos he received a sweet life, he did not patiently abide his success long, when with mind deranged he desired Hera, whom the delightful bed of Zeus had received; but (this) arrogance cast him into conspicuous ruin.9 Pindar thus explains the progression from olbos to at?by observing that Ixion acted not only from arrogance (hybris), but with a deranged mind (umvopivouc (ppocaiv,"crazed wits"). In Solon, too, the negative progression is restricted to "men whose mind is not sound." Similar views are expressed by Theognis (230-31 West): Xpriucjcxa xoi Gvnxo?? y?vexai ouppoown,, ocxn 5' ?i; oruxfjc ?vacpa?vexcu. Possessions, you see, become folly for mortals and from it appears ruin. Thus the view of the poets held that it is folly that brings ruin, not simple success. There is, to be sure, a potential redundancy in saying that folly leads to ate, since ate in Homer usually means "folly" or "infatuation." But in these genealogies it is most often restricted to the later sense of "ruin," whereas folly is made explicit by the use of another term, such as avoioc (anoia).10 9 The text is Bowra's. Wyatt (266) would translate ate as "remorse" or even "surfeit," but this sense seems rather forced and inappropriate to the context here. Remorse may have attended his situation, but surely Pindar has in mind the punishment that Ixion received. 10 Doyle disagrees, and would translate ate "folly" in most cases before Sophocles. For example, he argues for this subjective sense of the term in the case of Solon 13.9-13 (quoted above; see 1984:37). But the hybris and unjust deeds (a?nca epyuoixa) mentioned in that passage of Solon are results of folly, not causes, whereas ate comes later. The logic is this: men pursue wealth (or success), but when hybris and injustice are the means to it, it comes reluctantly and is soon mixed with ate. There is a clear sequence here: arrogance and in justice, then wealth, then ate. Earlier in the poem (13.7-8 West) Solon had said, "I yearn to have wealth, but I don't want to gain it unjustly, for justice (i.e., punishment) will surely follow." He continues after our passage by saying that ate starts small, like a fire, then grows slowly (like a plant sending forth flowers?4.35 West), and then blossoms forth. In poem 13 ate is clearly a punishment (25 x?gi?) that comes after violence (11 v?pic) and injus tice (12 a?iKa EpyjLiaxa). Ruin is more appropriate to this context than folly, and the same is generally true elsewhere in the genealogies. Padel (163) agrees that "tragedy increas ingly uses the word aie more of the 'disaster,' rather than of the mental blindness that causes it." She preserves the ambiguity, however, when she says (118), "In tragedy, madness in carnates the double bind of someone 'struck' for doing something that a similar 'blow' goaded them to do."</page><page sequence="7">Aeschylus' Genealogy of Morals 29 III. AESCHYLUS' INNOVATION The Chorus in the Agamemnon, however, identifies impiety as a significant cause of grief, and this is where the uniqueness of its view lies.11 Dussebia? the failure in one's actions to respect the gods, their position, and their power?is what draws the ire of the gods down upon mankind, not just petty envy. Mortals are subordinate to the gods (and to Zeus in particular), and when they do not recognize their position they are prone to thinking of themselves as superior to others, thereby usurping the position of the gods.12 Then they become arrogant toward others and substitute their own self-seeking sense of justice for the just and benevolent will of Zeus. This is the most important role of piety in this context, in establishing the proper relationship between humans and gods and among humans. Lack of piety is occasioned by and thus a sign of folly.13 The lines that follow continue the ethical genealogy (A. 763-71): (pi?e? ?? x?Kxeiv ??pic jLi?v naXam ve? ?ouoav ?v kocko?? ?poxcov ??plV, XOX' r\ X?G', 0X8 x? k? piov ii?Xr\i (p?oc x?kod, Sa?jiov? X8 x?v ?|ia%ov an?Xe uov, ?v?epov Gpaao? U?A,a? va? |i8A,?6poiaiv ?xcc?, 8?8?U?V0V X0K8t)OlV.14 11 Denniston and Page (136) also miss the point and see no difference from Solon. Conacher (29) rightly sees that the novelty lies in the emphasis on the impious deed. 12 Euben (77) writes, "... injustice in the broadest sense is pushing one's claims too far, seeking mastery and domination instead of recognizing the legitimacy of what is other." Cf. Mikalson (151) on the Bacchae: "Pentheus' lack of good judgment and wisdom be come impiety only when, because of it, he misunderstands his relationship to a god. He fails to understand who he is, who the god is, and therefore his proper behavior towards the god." See also Dodds 1960b: 506. 13 Theognis, too, sees impiety as another effect of folly: 1135-50,1179-80 West. 14 The whole passage, like many in Aeschylus, is fraught with textual difficulties. Nev ertheless, commentators, while providing various versions of the text, seem to agree with the general sense given by the marginal note found in Triclinius' manuscript (Neapolitanus II.F.31, folio 136 verso; the text is from O. L. Smith 161): "x?kxei, (pnaiv, fj naXaw iS?pic veav iS?piv Kai k?xov Kai x?v auocxov ?aiuova, ? ?axi xo ?v?epov Kai aGe?ec GpaGo? ?v xo?? oikoi? xfj? axrj?. xo?xo ?? ?iyei oxi 6 i&gt;?piGxf|c Kai Gpao?? axai? ?ujt?Trxei." (The ancient pride, says (sc. the Chorus), gives birth to young pride and anger and the spirit that cannot be fought, which is the unholy and impious daring in the houses of destruction. And this means that the insolent and rash person falls into destruction.)</page><page sequence="8">30 James J. Helm But old arrogance loves to give birth to arrogance which grows anew in the evils of mortals, at one time or another, when the ap pointed light of birth comes, and to its kindred spirit, which cannot be fought or battled: unholy rashness, in the halls of dark ruin, a thing made like its parents. The new sequence is: arrogance (hybris) bears arrogance,15 then rash behav ior (thrasos), which, being born in the halls of destruction (ate), has a begin ning that portends an ominous end. Hybris normally includes not just arro gance but also daring and violent acts prompted by arrogance. Aeschylus, however, here uses two different terms: thrasos for the action and hybris for the mental state or attitude that prompts it.16 Thus he separates the mental state from the resulting impulse to action, as with ate, which he more often uses for the result of folly, namely ruin, denoting folly itself by anoia (Prom. 1079, Sept. 402), each seen in its passage as leading to destruction.17 In a similar way, then, he restricts hybris to a person's attitude of being more important This scholion is traditional and not simply Triclinius' own paraphrase, as is shown by the fact that it appears in the format reserved in the manuscript for the scholia palaia, although how "ancient" it is we cannot accurately determine. "Anger" (kotos) of the manuscripts at A. 767, though not altogether inappropriate, is found nowhere else in this context. It does not stand without suspicion in the text, and while the scholiast includes it in the first part of his paraphrase, he omits it from his summary in the second sentence. Most modern editors reject it, or see in the word a corruption of the root tek-ltok- (Murray, Wilamowitz, Page, but not Fraenkel), which would continue the image of birth. Lattimore follows the majority view. Elsewhere kotos plays no role in such genealogies, nor does it seem par ticularly appropriate to the context here, and I agree with its emendation from koxov to x?kod. I have, however, deviated from Page's text by accepting Pauw's emendation of the MSS ei?ouivav to ei?ojievov (modifying GpaGO?), rather than Casaubon's -a?, which Page accepts. For the emendation see Wellauer ad loc. 15 Here the genealogy begins recursively as it did just before at A. 758-59, where the impious act gave birth to more impious acts; like produces like and impiety is com pounded. So too with hybris. Note that this genealogy relates to the ethical ideas and re sulting actions more than to the humans actors characterized by them. 16 See n. 6 above. 17 Herington 75: "It (sc. axr|) signifies, according to its context, both the psychological state of'infatuation,' the loss of judgment that leads one to forget the limits imposed by the condition of being human; and the objective outcome ofthat loss of judgment, namely 'disaster'." See also Wyatt on the double meaning of otxr\.</page><page sequence="9">Aeschylus' Genealogy of Morals 31 than others (though thrasos, too, can refer either to a mental state or to an action; these ambiguities show how closely in all three concepts the mental state and the resulting actions lie in the Greek mind). Still, at first glance, this sequence seems to be at variance with the earlier lines (A. 758-60) in which impiety is seen as the cause of misery. In 763 hybris is the parent. But each passage simply gives an abbreviated version of the family line, with the earlier set including only the second and last members (impi ety and misery) and leaving out the intermediate generations. The relation ship between impiety and arrogance is clearly established by the Chorus of the Eumenides (534-37):18 5i)ooe?iocc |X8v u?pic x8ko? (b? ?xujico?, 8K ? ' \)yi8?C6? (ppev v ? Tc?oiv (pi?o? Kai KoXvevKxoq ?A?oc. How truly is arrogance the child of impiety, but from health of mind (sc. comes) that which is dear to all and much desired: prosperity. When human beings are impious through ignoring the position of the gods and their own subordination to them, they come to feel that they are more important than their position warrants and hence act with excessive pride and arrogance. The resulting attitude of superiority over others leads them to believe that they are entitled to harm the others. Thus impiety is the crucial attitude that leads to hybris and the intermediary between folly and arrogance. So Aeschylus identifies the immediate source of hybris and inserts it as an additional generation in the family tree. Impiety, then, is a cause of misery, as A. 758-60 implied, but only indirectly, inasmuch as it produces the hybris that eventuates in the destructive punishment of violence. By contrast, uyieioc (ppevcov leads to prosperity. Although the phrase ap pears only this once in Aeschylus, its converse, vogo? (ppev v, occurs at Per sians 750, in the significant and well-known passage in which the ghost of Darius appears and laments the awful fate of the Persian forces in Greece, 18 Not all passages in tragedy, of course, express the views of the playwright himself, and we must avoid the error of seeing the Chorus as the spokesman for the poet; but we can assume with some confidence that where the sentiment is consonant with the gen eral tenor of the drama, it maybe taken as the author's affirmation of an important con nection. Snell, too, observes that the Choruses of the Eumenideshave special importance despite the Furies' specific role (144). See also Dodds 1960a: 23.</page><page sequence="10">32 James J. Helm reprimands Xerxes for his behavior, and predicts the further loss to the Greeks at Plataea (681-842).19 In attempting to understand and explain why it is that the Persian forces?despite their overwhelming numbers?were defeated by the Greeks, Darius points to Xerxes' bridging of the Hellespont as the main cause of the downfall (743-50). This subjugation and restraint of the god of the sea is a major breach of piety and a clear sign of Xerxes' failure to rever ence the gods. In fact, Darius observes, he acted in ignorance (744 o\) Kocxei?co?) and without careful planning (749 ouk eu?on?iai); indeed (and here is where the phrase in question occurs) he was infected with a disease of his mind (750 vogo? (ppevcov). This is the ultimate cause of his disastrous behavior, and the consequent deeds at the Hellespont constitute a new rash ness (744 vecoi GpaGei). Previous kings of Persia were eucppcov (772, cf. 767), whereas Xerxes "shows new folly" (782 v?' ?cppove?20). In addition to the of fense against Poseidon, these grave personal defects led to the subsequent wanton destruction of the temples on the Acropolis (809-12). This ethical perspective embraces that of both Solon and Pindar, who underscored the role of folly in bringing disaster, but adds the emphasis on impiety as its immediate product. Hence folly, impiety, and hybris are all closely linked in the Persians, as later in the Oresteia; folly is the source of the other two, which in turn ultimately lead to rash behavior, only to be punished by destruction in the end.21 The complete genealogy,22 then, suggests that anoicP produces dussebia, which gives birth to hybris, the parent of thrasos, and that ate ultimately fol lows. The family tree appears in Figure 1. 19 This speech of Darius plays an important thematic role in the play. As a ghost he has no reason to lie, and it is reasonable to think that he speaks for more than himself here. Broadhead (xxix) correctly asserts that in Darius' utterances we have "the concen trated essence of the poet's philosophy." 20 Or, if we read v?a ?pove?, "thinks new (and therefore inferior and probably dan gerous) thoughts." 21 Citing Sophocles' Creon and Pentheus, Mikalson (179) observes, "An impiety was the product of'wrong thinking,' as piety was the result of'right' or 'safe' thinking." 22 For the sake of vividness I extend the metaphor of birth without meaning to imply that the full causal system is expressed in genealogical form by Aeschylus. 23 This is a term that Aeschylus uses in Seven 402, where it may be taken to sum up urj (ppove?v koXxoc, (or ve' ?cppove?v), etc.; i.e., vogo?

Helm Zeus, you see, stands above us as a punisher of too-boastful thoughts, a severe chastiser. In response to this, since he needs to be prudent, instruct that man (sc. Xerxes) with reasonable admonition to stop sinning against the gods with his over-boastful daring. Aeschylus in his characteristic way shifts metaphors, using first an agricul tural image25 and then a juridical one, but the succession of ideas is exactly what we have posited from the genealogical passages. To avoid the ruin that is the logical and necessary descendant of godless thoughts and arrogance, human beings must be instructed with sound reason (e?X?yoiG? voi)6exr||naGiv), become prudent (Gaxppovriv), and cease from prideful rash behavior that affronts the gods (?i^ou 6eo?A,a?ouvG' {mepKOUTrcoi Gp?Gei). Otherwise punishment will follow.26 Darius had followed such a rule, and so Aeschylus uses his wealth and success to provide a pointed contrast to his son's unhappy experience. Darius' advice must be taken seriously. Thus the Persians clearly anticipates the set of causal relationships expressed in the Oresteia. In using the genealogical metaphor, Aeschylus suggests that there is an almost biological relationship between folly and impiety on the one hand, and the sort of arrogance and rash behavior that is punished by disaster on the other. In short, Aeschylus has taken over the traditional gene alogy of hybris-ate with Solon's addition of folly, and augmented it by insert ing impiety, separating the arrogance of hybris into the arrogant attitude and the rash acts that follow from it, and (like Solon) restricting ate to the sense of ruin. It is in keeping with Aeschylus' connection of justice with Zeus and his attendant amplification of the divine that his primary contribution to the genealogy lies in the addition of dussebia, which is seen as an essential link between folly and arrogance. IV. THE POSITIVE GENEALOGY We might not unreasonably expect Aeschylus to provide us with a geneal ogy of the positive ethical concepts to parallel this negative one, but he does not. Individual virtues are rarely personified in Greek thought, possibly be cause they are so closely associated with what is viewed as essential in humanity 25 Michelini (96) notes that in agriculture i)?piCco indicates the burgeoning of plants that must be treated by pruning to avoid a bad harvest. 26 An anonymous referee for TAPA calls attention to the fact that the only other place where euGuvoc occurs in Aeschylus is at Eu. 273, where it refers to Hades as punisher of aoe?eia, and that Theognis 39-40 West envisions the city giving birth to a man who will be a punisher of evil arrogance (?t)0i)vxf|pa KaKrjc u?pioc).</page><page sequence="13">Aeschylus' Genealogy of Morals 35 (see Abel 99).27 Greek tragedy tends to focus on the dark side of human na ture rather than on the light, and the human proclivities that are more con spicuous in Aeschylus' plays, indeed in most of Greek tragedy, are the nega tive ones: those that destroy rather than those that lead to success, those that are therefore condemned rather than those that are commended.28 Yet we can infer from the negative sequence in Aeschylus that prosperity, the opposite of ruin, requires the reverse of folly, impiety, arrogance, and rash action, how ever they may be conceived. The Eumenides passage that affirms that dussebia is the mother of hybris (534-37, see above, section in) also claims that prosperity comes from "health of wits." By providing us with the men ...de contrast,29 the Furies suggest that these are opposing progressions in the ethical life of human beings, but not necessarily that the elements given are the corresponding members of the progression. Impiety leads to arrogance, yes, and right thinking to prosper ity, but that is not necessarily to contrast impiety and right thinking directly any more than it is to set arrogance over against prosperity. What is impor tant here is the general trend, and the poet has merely selected the elements of the opposing genealogies that he wants to emphasize; as noted, he gives us complementary members, not the corresponding ones. The logical pairs are these: wrong thinking/right thinking, impiety/piety, arrogance/prudence,30 rash behavior/justness31 and prosperity/destruction. The Furies have adum brated the fuller family tree by giving us selected elements of each main branch. These positive qualities are characteristically Greek and by Aeschylus' time fairly conventional. In the Seven against Thebes Aeschylus has conveniently compressed the most important positive ethical ideals into a single line, when Eteocles describes the seer Amphiaraus as "a prudent, just, noble, pious man" 27 It is as if the virtues are qualities that humans seek and view as being under their control, whereas the vices are entities external to them that seem to overpower them against their will. 28 As Vickers (224) finds, in Greek myth "ethical values are more demonstrated in the breach than in the observance." 29 Note the similar iS?pic jiev ... Aim ?? in A. 764-73. 30 Also in Theognis 379 West. On this important pair of contrasting values see North 33 and passim. 31 This may seem an odd pair, but here I am only being descriptive; ?ixaio? is in fact the term that Aeschylus uses where we might expect the opposite of Gpaao? (discretion?). 0paaoc is, as we have remarked, not just "rashness" but also the associated rash actions. When action proceeds from arrogance, the result is indiscretion and the abrogation of proper relationships, hence injustice.</page><page sequence="14">36 James J. Helm (610 GC?Kppcov S?kocio? ?yocGo? e\)G??f](; ?vr|p). Aeschylus here lists all of the important qualities?all, that is, except one. It is crucial to the plot of the play that, because of the characteristics included in this line, Amphiaraus is sin gularly ill-suited to participate in the attack on Thebes with the other six, whose chief characteristics are just the opposite of these except in one regard, and that is the quality that is omitted from the list: good sense. Indeed the poet goes on to say that Amphiaraus participates in the attack ?iou (ppevcov, "in violence of his wits" (or "against his better judgment," 612). In all other ways, however, he serves as a contrast in character to his allies. The primary symbol of this contrast is his shield, which, unlike the shields of his allies, carries no arrogant device symbolic of hybris?indeed it carries no device at all, for, as the Theban Spy (592) points out, "he wants not to seem, but to be best." Nevertheless, because of his temporary folly he shares destruction with his comrades in spite of his former piety. It is the opposites of these primary virtues, then, that (not surprisingly) the poet finds most reprehensible. These?impiety, arrogance, and rash ac tion, plus foolishness?may also be seen in the Seven, where the opposing forces are intentionally portrayed as having antithetical ethical qualities. The attacking forces are (with the exception of Amphiaraus, as we have noted) all characterized by a kind of hybris: boastful arrogance coupled with a disre gard for and even defiance of the gods, which is destined to be punished with annihilation. Representative is not Amphiaraus, but Parthenopaios, who reveres his spear more than Zeus (529); or Kapaneus, who boasts that he will take the city whether Zeus wants him to or not, an impious boast that involves, as the Spy says, thought not appropriate to a human being (425). The foolishness and impiety of their speech go beyond the bounds of propriety and under score the injustice of their attack on Thebes, which will be their downfall. So when the playwright describes Amphiaraus, we have in pithy expres sion what is later to become a virtual canon of cardinal Greek virtues, and one of the first appearances of the canon.32 Its importance for us is that it gives a preliminary indication of the qualities that Aeschylus finds most praisewor thy among human beings. Several other passages help establish the relationships between the virtues. The lines in the Persians on the punishment of impiety (820-31, quoted above) end in a suggestion that the genealogy of vice and punishment is balanced by similar notions of virtue and reward. The connection of the first three mem bers is implicit in the passage quoted earlier, where instruction by sound rea 32 As North points out (41). Socrates included bravery along with wisdom, piety, tem perance, and justice (see, for example, Benson 9).</page><page sequence="15">Aeschylus' Genealogy of Morals 37 son is needed to make a person stop affronting the gods, become modest, and desist from proud rashness (Pers. 829-31; cf. Supp. 418). And just as punish ment follows upon vice, so reward follows upon virtue; the same Eumenides passage that maintains that pride is the child of impiety (534, quoted above) also offers, as we have seen, a contrast by affirming that prosperity comes from soundness of mind. The phrase "health of mind" is, as we have noted, the precise opposite of the "disease of mind" decried by Darius (Pers. 750). Here we have the first and last members of the family tree (phron?sis and olbos), with the connection again abbreviated. Later, after the Eumenides passage just cited, we find the immediate antecedent of prosperity to be justness; the per son who does right (Eu. 550 ?ikocio? cov), free-willed, without constraint, will not be unprosperous (551 o\)K ocvoA?oc ecxcu), whereas failure to honor the altar of justice and seeking gain with a force contrary to the gods will be pun ished (538-42). This honoring of justice is exemplified in showing respect (sebas) to one's parents and to the stranger (545-49). Likewise, we have seen that in the kallipais passage of the Agamemnon, just before the Chorus listed the descendants of hybris, they maintained that "the fate of just houses is al ways a beautiful child" (A. 761-62). Human wealth alone does not lead to misery, they claim, but impiety fostering rash acts does. A house that acts justly?even a prosperous one?has a good fate. So also Justice honors the righteous life, shuns ill-gotten wealth, and approaches things that are holy (A. 775-80, with 778 ?oioc). Thus a number of passages in Aeschylus confirm the positive genealogical scheme that may be inferred from the previously identified negative one (see Fig. 2).

Helm Intellectual qualities govern one's attitude toward the gods, which determine attitudes towards others and actions that produce in turn success or ruin. These then are the parallel genealogies suggested by Aeschylus. They are built out of evidence from a collection of disparate passages, but form a solid conceptual whole. They become clear only progressively as the plays unfold.33 That they represent the Aeschylean perspective is borne out by the plays as a whole, where the progression is exemplified. The relationships implied by the genealogies clarify the underlying assumptions of the Persians and, as I shall proceed to show, contribute significantly to our understanding of the Oresteia, with its special concern for crime and punishment. V. THE ORESTEIA In the Oresteia ethical relationships are explored through a series of violent acts that bring this causal chain sharply into focus. The trilogy depicts the violent actions of Paris, Agamemnon, Clytemnestra, and Orestes. When their actions do not arise from the fundamental virtues, beginning with phron?sis and eusebeia, they lead to negative results and are punished; when they do adhere to the virtues, the characters are absolved of guilt. It is within this context that we see the working out of Aeschylus' sequence of ethical con cepts and their effects on the life of the agents. A. Paris The case against Paris, perhaps the simplest and clearest, is laid out in the first stasimon of the Agamemnon (355-402), where the Chorus celebrates, some what hesitantly, Clytemnestra's assertion that Troy has fallen. They view this event as a punishment of Paris for carrying off Helen, saying (A. 369-84), o\)K ecpoc TIC Geo?? ?pOTcov cc^io?aGoci piXeiv oooi? ?G?KTCOV xdpi? tcocto?O'- 6 ?' o\)K euoe?ric/ 7t?(pctvxoci ?' ?yyovoi? t?xoA,urix?)v apnt 7W8OVXC0V ine??ov r\ ?ikoc?co?, cp?,80vxcov ?cojiax v im?pcpei), i)7c?p xo ?e?/ci?xov ?axco ?' ?ni\ 33 Lebeck has argued persuasively that in the Oresteia verbal images and symbols move from enigma to clarity over the course of the trilogy. As she says (131), "Initial obscurity is gradually dispelled as later passages cast light on earlier." Just so, the genealogy of ethi cal ideals is built up gradually and becomes complete only in the Eumenides.</page><page sequence="17">Aeschylus' Genealogy of Morals 39 uxxvxov, coax' dcTtapKe?v ei) 7ipa7ri?cov taxx?vxi. o? y?p ?axiv enaXclic, kXovtov npb?

Someone denied that the gods consider it worthwhile to be concerned for mortals by whom the grace of things that ought not be touched is trampled; but he was not pious. The curse for things that ought not be dared has been revealed to the descendants of those who breathe more than justly [i.e., live beyond what is just], of houses that teem with too much abundance, beyond what is best; let it [i.e., abundance/wealth] be without pain, so as to be sufficient for one who has been allotted good sense. For there is no defense in wealth against greed for a man who has kicked the great altar of Justice into obscurity. The indefinite ti? in 369 must refer to or at least include Paris, who is men tioned just before (363) and after (399), as the object of Zeus' punishment. The description fits him well. He did not have enough good sense to be con tent with the abundance of what he had and has demonstrated his impiety by denying, if only implicitly, that the gods care for how mortals act or that they punish behavior that oversteps the bounds of propriety. Such a foolish view is responsible for Paris' impious failure to respect the laws of hospitality guaranteed by Zeus Xenios (362; 400-402). His arrogance leads to the rash impropriety of carrying off Helen (375 axoA,ur|xcov "things that ought not be dared"), an unjust act (376 jiei?ov f] ?ikoc?c??), and he himself can be de scribed as unjust (398 oc?ikov), having "kicked the great altar of Justice into obscurity" (383-84). Thus lack of sense, impiety, arrogance, rashness, and injustice lead to destruction, which ultimately strikes not only him but, as in the case of Xerxes, his whole people. Some, like Denniston and Page (xxix and 103), deny Paris' responsibility on the grounds that he was compelled by Persuasion (385 rieiGc?) to do what he did. As has often been observed, this view ignores the multiple levels of motivation present in the Oresteia; the events of the plays may be seen as re sulting independently from (1) the curse on the house, (2) the actions of the</page><page sequence="18">40 James J. Helm gods, especially Zeus, and (3) ordinary human motivations. All of these are at work at once through what Dodds (1951: 7 and note 32) has called "overdetermination." Note the view of the connection that Aeschylus ascribes to Darius: "Whenever a person is himself eager, the god also joins in" (Pers. 742). Especially when viewed as a psychological force, Peitho does not remove human responsibility any more than, say, Aphrodite's intervention would (cf. Dodds 1951:27). In the Eumenides (esp. 970) Athena uses Peitho to persuade the Furies to change their role, but this in no way deprives the Furies of their choice. Since Peitho particularly appeals to the mind, evil persuasion may, as with Paris, contribute to anoia. Persuasion is often contrasted with compul sion, and here the relative freedom under persuasion becomes evident. Finley (284) speaks of "the moral cogency of reason." Thus Peitho or no Peitho, Paris is responsible for his own actions, and hence may be described by the Chorus as adikos. The Herald, too, says of Paris (A. 534-37): ?(p^cbv y?p ap7rayfi? xe Kai K?07tf]? ?ucnv xo\) puaiau G' fijiapxe Kai rcavc?taGpov a\)x?xGovov 7caxpcoiov eGpioev ?ouov. bxnX? S' exeioav ?piaji?oai G?fi?pxia. For owing the penalty for rape and theft he both lost his plunder and destroyed his father's house completely, earth and all. The sons of Priam paid double for their sins. Paris' sins are clearly delineated? rape and theft?and he and his family have paid twice the penalty for them. The second stasimon of the Agamemnon, though focusing more on Helen, reemphasizes Paris' responsibility by stressing his dishonoring of the table of hospitality and of Zeus, the guardian of the hearth (A. 701-3). It is for this reason that the lion cub becomes a priest of destruction (735-36 iepr?c ti? "Atoc?), and an avenger ( 'Epiv?cJ appears for Zeus in his role as god of hos pitality (748-49). It is reflection on this that leads the Chorus to assert that the origin of ruin lies in impiety, arrogance, and rash behavior (750-71, the passage with which we began), and then to conclude with praise of Justice (772-80 Aka). JB. Agamemnon The instrument of Zeus' punishment of Paris and his city of Troy was the Greek army under the Atreidae (A. 60-62; cf. 131-34 and 355-66), with the</page><page sequence="19">Aeschylus' Genealogy of Morals 41 elder son of Atreus in charge. Agamemnon thereby becomes the agent of Zeus, and on the divine level his actions may be justified. But in the process of car rying out Zeus' will, Agamemnon himself becomes guilty because of an ar rogance and daring that is expressed in several ways. The first lies in putting his own personal reputation above the life of his daughter, Iphigeneia, and in sacrificing her in order to enable the fleet to set sail and himself to carry out an expedition of personal aggrandizement. This point needs to be explored in some detail, given the history of controversy that surrounds it.34 It is too often argued35 that Agamemnon really has no choice, that he must appease Artemis, since she has been offended, and that it is she, a divinity, who demands the sacrifice of Agamemnon's daughter. Furthermore, if Agamemnon is to be the agent of Zeus, he must get the ships moving, and this too requires the appeasement of the goddess. But Artemis had to be ap peased in the Agamemnon not for something that Agamemnon had done (as in an earlier tradition), but rather for what he was about to do.36 This is sym bolized by the image of the two eagles seizing and devouring the pregnant hare (A. 108-20). The Chorus reports that the seer expressly interpreted this as a sign that Troy would ultimately be destroyed (122-30), and further that this was the very reason that Artemis was angry ( 134-38). It must, then, have been the Trojan expedition itself together with the impending fall of Troy that infuriated Artemis; she did not feel that the death and suffering of innocents that was bound to be involved in the war was justified (cf. Conacher's Ap pendix, 76-83). The Chorus of the Agamemnon hints at this later, calling the Atreidae "killers of many" (461 koXvkt?vwv). As Parry (88-89) says, "The Chorus, while staunchly loyal to him, lyrically define Agamemnon's intoler able dilemma in such a way that our sympathy for his position of being damned if he does and damned if he doesn't is overlaid with our horrified rejection of child-murder as a solution to any human problem." 34 For defense of the position taken in what follows, see (among others) Finley 252 and 258, Kitto 3, Peradotto 249-58, and in large part P. Smith n. 101. Lloyd-Jones con curs that Agamemnon is guilty, but argues that the guilt ultimately derives from the curse on the house of Atreus. Lebeck (40) affirms Agamemnon's ability to make the ultimate choice, and Conacher (77) stays with this growing consensus. Otis devotes a chapter to "The Guilt of Agamemnon" (3-11, esp. 7-9, though he disagrees with Finley and Kitto on why Agamemnon is guilty, referring it instead to the change of a basically noble char acter that results from his decision to sacrifice Iphigeneia). 35 For example, Fraenkel (2:441), Denniston and Page (88), Webster (152). Lesky (85) would have it both ways, referring to "the close union of necessity imposed by the gods and the personal decision to act." That is, having become aware of the necessity of killing Iphigeneia, Agamemnon then also desires it. 36 Conacher (77) notes that Fraenkel attributes this view to Conington.</page><page sequence="20">42 James J. Helm The main issue, after all, is largely the fate of one person, Helen, and, as Aeschylus has the Chorus say, the wife of another (448 ???oxpiot?), who has broken her marriage vows (62 7coA,i)avopo?). Given the crime, the punish ment by the Greeks is excessive (see P. Smith passim) and characterized by the Chorus as without justice (464 aveu ?ixa?), and by the Herald as twice what was deserved (537 8i7cA,a ... Gdcuxxpxia). Before Agamemnon gets in volved in such mass destruction of innocents, Artemis wants him to be aware of the seriousness of what he is doing, and forces him to destroy the life of one dear to him as a sign before he even begins. She gives him one more chance to decide; if he will not return home, his only alternative is to choose the way of violence, and this hybris is symbolized by the sacrilege of sacrificing his own innocent daughter. Otis (20,35) telescopes this to a choice between the "good" Iphigeneia and the "bad" Helen. Note that Artemis does not actually require him to make the sacrifice; it is (in this interpretation) a conditional proph ecy: if he wants the ships to sail, he must sacrifice Iphigeneia. Hence the im portance and genuineness of Agamemnon's deliberation. But, the critics argue, was Agamemnon not required to go whether he wanted to or not, inasmuch as he was the agent of Zeus? No. He is indeed the agent of Zeus, and the Chorus sees him as such, but he himself does not.37 The reason he expresses for the decision to go ahead with the sacrifice is not duty to Zeus, but rather that he does not want to be a deserter (212 Xinovavq). Note the significance of motivation here, so important in the third play of the trilogy. If Agamemnon's motive had been to act as Zeus's agent, the situ ation would have been quite different. Thoughtfulness and piety would have guarded him against arrogance. But as it is, he makes his choice largely for his own personal position and glory, and it is for this reason that Artemis forces him to realize from the start what a dreadful choice he is making.38 That is why Aeschylus has the Chorus describe his decision in some of the worst value terms available: dusseb?, anagnon, anieron (A. 218-21): 87cei ?' ?vayKoc? ?'8-u X?nadvov (ppevo? Ttv?cov oucae?ri xporca?av ?vayvov dcv?epov, x?Gev to rcavx?xo^uov cppove?v iiex?yvco But when he put on the yoke of necessity, breathing a change of his mind, impious, unhallowed, sacrilegious, from then on he resolved to consider trying anything. 37 Kitto 5, Hammond 46 (especially good on personal freedom), Conacher 60 n. 2,167. 38 Peradotto describes this as Agamemnon's f)6o? (256), and it comes pretty close to Fisher's definition of hybris (above, n. 6).</page><page sequence="21">Aeschylus' Genealogy of Morals 43 Denniston and Page argue that "necessity" means that he has no choice, but the fact that he "put on" the yoke himself belies that. The active voice is criti cal here; he does it himself, it is his own decision. Furthermore, it is not sim ply a matter of Agamemnon being caught between two mutually contradic tory commands, as some have argued. Granted he is in a position in which he can make no satisfactory choice, but it is his motivation at issue.39 This impious decision involves a change in Agamemnon so that he begins to set his mind on the extremes of rashness. It is insanity that makes mortals rash in this way (222-23 ?poxouc Gpoca?ve?... rcapaKOTc?) and is the first cause of ill. Note the progression: there is a change in his thinking (proleptically described as already impious), and this insanity leads to rash behavior. With the exception of hybris, the genealogy is all there. The Chorus, too, later char acterizes this action as rash behavior (803 thrasos) that results from poor think ing (A 799-804): ah ?? uoi x?xe pxv ax?,XX(ov oxpocxiocv 'E?t?vr|? 8V8K\ Ol)K ?7UK?t)0"(?, K?cpx' ocTUOUouaco? rjoGoc yeypceu^?vo? o??' eu 7tpa7tt?c?v oicckoc v?uoov, Gpaoo? ?K Guaicov ?vSpaai Gvf|iaKouai kojli??oov But then, when you were sending out the army for the sake of Helen?I will not hide it, you were drawn very discordantly and were not well controlling the rudder of your mind, bringing rashness from sacrifices to men who were dying. The "rashness from sacrifices" that results from failure to control his mind refers, of course, to the sacrifice of Iphigeneia, and it is this in particular that the Chorus finds "discordant."40 39 Nussbaum (250-51) argues in a similar vein that it is not so much the choice that Agamemnon makes that puts him in the wrong, but rather the manner of action?the fact that he embraced the deed and did not oppose it. She focuses on his emotions, al though his motivation is more relevant to the play. She rightly emphasizes the impor tance of piety towards the gods, Agamemnon's failure in this regard, and the relevance of the Hymn to Zeus to all of this (257). 40 Line 803 presents us with another textual crux, and there is considerable disagree ment on its interpretation. The manuscripts read: Opaoo? ekougiov, which is unmetrical; Triclinius emended to Gapao?. Some read Gapao? with him or take thrasos in its positive sense of the courage that Agamemnon supplies to the men in the army. But Fraenkel ar gues against such a usage on the grounds that kouxCco cannot mean "implant." In any</page><page sequence="22">44 James J. Helm The death of his daughter is not the only indicator of Agamemnon's short comings; so is the whole Trojan expedition. The Chorus' words have already revealed not only their own discomfort but also widespread dissatisfaction with the expedition and with Agamemnon himself, both in the army (429 55) and at home (456-58; cf. 800-804 above, with the final emphasis on the deaths of his men). The plunder of cities and the attendant destruction of innocent human life forebode punishment by the gods (459-74). Further more, Agamemnon destroyed the temples and altars of the gods at Troy (525 28) and shows no remorse when he returns to Argos.41 The notorious impiety of the famous tapestry scene only confirms and reinforces Agamemnon's guilt. Here we find in miniature the same negative sequence of ideals. Agamemnon is initially reluctant to walk on the tapestries, because one must honor the gods (922 0?oi)c ... xiuoctape?v), not take their prerogatives (925 X?yw koct' ocv?poc, ur| Ge?v, oe?eiv ?pi), if one wants to enjoy success (928 oA?ioai). But Clytemnestra succeeds in warping his mind so that he actually does entertain the evil thoughts that he wanted to avoid (927 KocKcb? 9pov?iv) and forgets the prerogatives of the gods. The arrogance of putting himself in the role of a god leads him to the symbolic rash act of trampling down beautiful things?symbolic of the destruction of Troy and its temples?that will be followed immediately by disaster.42 Clytemnestra, of course, is quick to point to Iphigeneia's death as she at tempts to justify her own actions (1417,1431-33,1525-27), and she adds the personal affront to herself, that Agamemnon has brought Cassandra back with case this sense would make GvniOKODOi unintelligible. It must be the negative sense of "rashness" that the Chorus has in mind. But whose rashness? Some would retain the read ing of the manuscripts and assign the rashness to Helen, who has just been mentioned; Agamemnon allows her willing rashness to cause the death of his men, and the Chorus has already implied (62) that such a cause is not worth it. In fact, however, the rashness of Agamemnon himself better fits the preceding two lines with their critical view of his ac tions. Then Ahrens' conjecture ek Gdgicov is perfectly in order, though it is a shame to lose the eKouoiov (unmetrical though it is), which would emphasize the deficiency of Agamemnon's motivation. 41 As Lloyd-Jones notes (Segal 66). He summarizes (Segal 71),"Even his righteous re venge upon the Trojans involves Agamemnon in yet further guilt. In one sense, it is a tri umph of divine justice; in another, an atrocious crime; the instrument of Zeus' punish ment of Troy must himself be punished." See also Foley 210: "Agamemnon's own descrip tion of the army's behavior at the city's fall (A. 821-28) ... taints him with impiety." 42 Or, as Parry (96) puts it, "Agamemnon steps onto the carpet of tyrants. Of course, this act in itself is not responsible for his doom. Rather it symbolizes that weakness in his character which the lyricism of the odes has already suggested to us ... ."</page><page sequence="23">Aeschylus' Genealogy of Morals 45 him, intending to install a slave in the house next to his lawful wife (1438 47). Agamemnon may indeed be the agent of Zeus, but as the result of his lack of sense and piety he also has become guilty of his own deeds of violence.43 And so his destruction is swift once he returns home, as he is cut down by Clytemnestra, guided, she says, by the avenging fury of her daughter (1431? 33) and of the house of Atreus (1501-2). C. Clytemnestra Yet in a similar way Clytemnestra herself becomes both the agent of the gods in punishing her husband for his deeds and guilty of precisely the same arrogance and violence (see Foley 204-6). While she defends her murder of Agamemnon on the grounds that he had killed their daughter (1417, and 1525-29) and had been unfaithful to her (1438-43), nevertheless there are incriminating circumstances: she has been living with Aegisthus in her husband's absence, and her desire to have Agamemnon out of the way ap pears clearly to have had at least as much to do with her own infidelity (cf. Orestes' reference at Ch. 895) as with her desire for vengeance or her role as agent of the curse on the house (1501), which she brings forward largely as pretexts.44 Winnington-Ingram (Segal 87) ascribes the murder to her jealousy of Agamemnon and his power and "status as a man." The theme of Clytemnestra's impiety is most explicit in the Choephori, where Aeschylus pays it particular attention. The Chorus calls her "godless" (?uoGeo?, Ch. 46 and 525; cf. her "godless thought," SuoG v (ppovnua, against her children in 191). Since her murder of Agamemnon, reverence (oe?occ) is gone in Argos (55). Making success one's god is a form of impiety that inevi tably threatens disaster (59-62). She has made a mockery of the libations to Agamemnon, which are not sincere (43 points in this direction, while 189 43 Garner (30) comments on the way the Oresteia is often charged with ambiguity: "the same people simultaneously have and do not have justice on their side," and Mikalson ( 161 ) notes that "on occasion the gods punish the impious through agents who are them selves impious or otherwise morally culpable." 44 Hammond, too, argues (43-44): "Her motives are hatred of Agamemnon (1374f., 1391, 1407f.), lust for blood (1384f. and 1427f.), and adulterous love for the despicable wolf, Aegisthus ( 1224f, 1258f., 1435f, and 1625f). These motives figure more prominently in the play than any grief for Iphigeneia; indeed Clytemnestra's picture of Iphigeneia greet ing her father with a kiss in the underworld ( 1556f.) is inspired not by love for Iphigeneia but by hatred for Agamemnon. These motives are important precisely because Clytemnestra acted of her own choice; they and the thoughts she expresses determine the quality of her action, and Aeschylus leaves us in no doubt that her motives and so her acts were criminal."

The offering is called by the Chorus "a favor given with an ill will" (43 %?piv ax?piTov), and Orestes character izes it as wretched (517 ??i?aia). Such a lack of sincerity and religious duty only matches her behavior at the funeral, which was performed without par ticipation of the citizens, without grief, and without lamentation (430-33). She even mutilated the body before burial (439-44). Her children invoke her as "all-daring mother" (430 n?vToX\xz uoVc?p, echoing the 7tocvTOTO?,uov of Agamemnon in A. 221), and her deeds are "unhallowed" (986 ocvocyva). She has unlawfully transgressed the reverence owed to Zeus (644-45 to 7cav ?i?c oe?ac 7tap?K?avToc ox&gt; Gejuigtc??). Contrast with this the sincerity of her children in their devotion to Agamemnon. Orestes' first act on return is to perform the rites of respect at his father's tomb (Ch. 1-9). Electra still wears signs of mourning (16-17), and she attempts to turn the offerings of her mother to more genuine performance (84-95), or at least to defeat their original purpose (96-99). Orestes seeks the rituals that are the right of the dead (320-22,483-84). The Chorus approves of their acts (510), and even they, foreign slaves though they are, genuinely lament and tear their cheeks for Agamemnon (21-31). Their ritual lament serves its purpose: to motivate Orestes and Electra to punish Clytemnestra. Already in the Agamemnon the guilt of Clytemnestra is emphasized by the appearance of Aegisthus, who, though unwilling to carry out the murder him self, thereupon takes advantage of his position to play the tyrant, as he threatens the members of the Chorus when they express loyalty to their former king (A. 1617-24). They call particular attention to his hybris (1612) and adultery (1626). Clytemnestra, too, is obviously hypocritical in her criticism of Agamemnon's bringing Cassandra home; after all, she has established a rival to him in his own home while he was absent, and this is rather different from bringing home a woman as booty from the war. Thus, just as Agamemnon's punishment of Paris only served to create new crimes that in turn required punishment, so Clytemnestra's punishment of Agamemnon demands an equal penalty, and we can only expect a continuation of the sequence of murders. Anne Lebeck (74-79) notes that the verb 7iaT?C0?"trample with the foot," unique to the Oresteia?is used metaphorically of all the major wrong-doers in these plays: Paris (A. 372), Thyestes (A. 1193), Clytemnestra and Aegisthus (A. 1357), as well as literally of Agamemnon in the tapestry scene (A. 957). Thus this verb serves to tie together their reprehensible actions, and urges us to view these actions in the same negative light. The echoes confirm that Agamemnon's treading of the tapestries is symbolic of wrong-doing in general. Accordingly, Justice punishes wrong-doers with the same vivid verb ( Ch. 642).</page><page sequence="25">Aeschylus' Genealogy of Morals 47 D. Orestes Now it would seem that when Orestes avenges his father by killing his mother the chronicle of punished crimes is only going to be carried one logi cal step farther, and that he too will meet his ruin as a penalty. But the cir cumstances here are quite different, for Orestes (unlike Clytemnestra or Agamemnon or Paris) is not motivated exclusively or even primarily by per sonal advantage. While his father and mother acted unwittingly as agents of Zeus in punishing hybris and were really motivated by their own private gain, Orestes finds his primary motivation in the command of Apollo.45 In his first speech he invokes Zeus (Ch. 17), and throughout the second play he acts in accord with the oracle (558-59, 900, 941,1030-31). To be sure he considers other compelling motives for the deed (297-305), but these are not sufficient to make him act; his father's ghost, his sister, the Chorus in the Kommos, and finally Pylades are all needed to urge him on. Thus it is Apollo's oracle that provides the final impetus, and Orestes can claim that he acted justly, ?v?iKco? (988), in accord with the behests of Apollo (1030). Finley (273) remarks, "He had not, like his parents, sought chiefly his own good, but the end of evil." He alone of the four main characters can claim explicit divine sanction for his deeds, and he alone claims this sanction as his ultimate motivation. In fact, he is prepared to die for the deed (Ch. 438), thereby demonstrating his utter lack of self-interest.46 Consequently the Chorus can call the murder "blame less" (830 ctv?7iiuouxpov); indeed, the word they use here is not murder, but am,, the very term that denotes divine punishment, and they say "Justice guided his hand" (948-49). The importance of this motive can be seen in the crucial moment of the blow, for just when he is about to strike he hesitates, aware of the awful sanc tions against matricide.47 But he acts decisively when Pylades utters his only three lines in the play (Ch. 900-902), reminding him of the oracle of Apollo. Orestes considers the response and says, "I judge (Kpivco) that you win, and you advise me well" (903). 45 Despite Garvie (xxxiv), who downplays what he calls Orestes'"purity of spirit," con cluding that Orestes "becomes as guilty as his father." Although he stresses the parallels between Orestes on the one hand and Agamemnon and Clytemnestra on the other (xxxv), these parallels only serve to heighten the differences: thesis-thesis-antithesis. After all, Agamemnon and Clytemnestra die, and Orestes does not. 46 Peradotto (258) contrasts Orestes' t)6o? with that of Agamemnon, affirming his "purity of intent." 47 Foley (205) notes that Clytemnestra herself does not struggle with her decision to kill Agamemnon.</page><page sequence="26">48 James J. Helm In short, reflection (phron?sis) leads to obedience to the gods (eusebeia); Orestes is therefore prudent (s?phr?n) and his act justified (dikaion). In this vein the Chorus comments (Ch. 935-41,948-49): ?UO^? |X?V A?KCC nplOCjl??OCl? %pOVC0l, ?ocGuOiKOc now ? ?UO?,? ?' ?? 8?JLIOV XOV Ayajuiuvovo? ?m?o?? Aicov, ?ut?o??

Justice came in time to the sons of Priam, a penalty heavy but just; and to the house of Agamemnon came the double lion, the double attack, and he struck to completion? the exile supported by the Pythian prophecy, rightly set in motion by admonitions from the god. ... and in the battle the true daughter of Zeus (sc. Dike) touched his hand ... In other words, as a conscious agent of Zeus, Orestes neither deserves nor provokes punishment for killing his mother. This is why the Chorus calls the deed "blameless" (831). Although he admits committing the deed, he acted not out of ignorance but out of knowledge and self-control, not out of pride but rather out of piety, not out of self-aggrandizement but in obedience to the demands of Zeus.48 The Chorus comments on the deed by saying, "It is 48 Dodds (1960a: 30) states the matter clearly: "Orestes' case is again different. We see him stand where his mother once stood, in the palace doorway; once again a man and a woman lie dead at the Avenger's feet; but where Clytemnestra carried a bloody sword Orestes carries a QaXXoq and a wreath (Ch. 1035). The parallelism is intentional and sig nificant; so is the difference. Outwardly, his situation resembles hers; inwardly, there is a deep gulf between them. It is not merely that Orestes is humble where she was arrogant, or that his motives are 'purer' than hers; like her, he has simple human motives, which he does not conceal (299-304). The deeper difference is that the divine purpose, of which both Agamemnon and Clytemnestra were unconscious and guilty agents, is for Orestes something consciously known and humbly, though not easily, accepted. He is aware that his act is a crime, even before he has committed it (930 xo jLif) xpecov, cf. 1016-17 and 1029); but receiving it as a duty, he stands as a type of all those who take upon themselves 'the necessary guilt of human action.'"</page><page sequence="27">Aeschylus' Genealogy of Morals 49 right to respect (oe??iv) the power that holds the heaven" (Ch. 960). Later Apollo himself will say that he persuaded Orestes to kill his mother (Eu. 84), and the Furies will turn that into a charge against him (Eu. 202). Likewise, in the Choephori Electra had been concerned to retain her piety (122) when she prayed for him to come and avenge her father (138-39), and this was empha sized when she asked Agamemnon himself to grant her to be more temper ate and pious than her mother (s?phronesteran and eusebesteran, 140-41). So because Orestes obeyed Zeus out of piety, his was an act that could be justi fied by the poet, and he ultimately wins ?A?oc as the Chorus had prayed (865). There is no denying the complexity and difficulty of Agamemnon's choice at Aulis, but the experience of Orestes in a similar situation shows that what is at issue is not simply the choice, but, as we have stressed, the motivation. In each case the punishment demanded by Zeus entails some wrong-doing from the human point of view, but it is essential to the drama that the focus be on the intent, and that is why the jury is required. Nevertheless, such a heinous deed cannot be allowed to go unatoned. The objective guilt of Orestes is still there, only diminished, not removed, by his primary motives. Orestes him self recognizes the ambivalence of his act; he hesitates more than once, and after it is accomplished sees that it is soiled (Ch. 1016-17). Martha Nussbaum (258) notes his remorse in contrast to the self-congratulation of his father, and observes, "even such rationally justifiable killings violate a moral claim and demand emotions and thoughts appropriate to a situation of violation" (264-65). So Orestes is willing to accept punishment and make atonement (Ch. 1034-35), and does so before his trial (Eu. 276-77). It is also instructive to note the differences between Orestes' situation and that of Clytemnestra. Orestes says, referring to his mother's libations for his father, "If one should pour out everything on behalf of a single death, the hardship would be in vain" ( Ch. 520-21 ). This, of course, reflects the perspec tive of the Furies, that an untimely death must be avenged. Yet later Orestes himself will be able to atone for his murder of Clytemnestra. What is differ ent? Orestes' action is justified by the oracle and his own attitude, though he must still atone for the deed and remove the objective fact of pollution. Yet, since Clytemnestra was not justified in killing Agamemnon, either by divine command or motivation, no atonement will help. Thus the Oresteia presup poses and therefore confirms the importance of the two ethical chains of descent that we have posited. Since Orestes' motivation and attitude can be described in terms of the genealogy of virtues rather than their opposites, his actions are vindicated. The Furies predictably disagree, since they take the traditional and much simpler view, that the bare fact of one person's untimely death at the hands</page><page sequence="28">50 James J. Helm of another is sufficient grounds for vengeance; they are after all agents of Clytemnestra. ApaGocvxa rcaGdv: the one who has acted shall suffer, the killer shall be killed (Ch. 310-14; cf. Eu. 209-12,261-72,312-20). The conflict here over the nature of justice and its implementation comes to focus on the issue of whether Orestes is really justified in killing his mother. The Furies demand the unqualified punishment of Orestes, while Apollo defends him on the grounds that he himself had commanded the murder, and that Orestes had acted justly by avenging his father's death at Zeus' command. That Apollo was responsible is emphasized repeatedly both in the Choephori (269-97,900-903,954-57,1030-32) and in the Eumenides (84,198-202,463 67,579-80,593-94,797-99), and as the prophet of Zeus (Eu. 19) Apollo speaks Zeus' will (615-18). Orestes says explicitly, "I killed the woman who gave me birth, I will not deny it, As a penalty for the murder of my dearest father. And Apollo is jointly responsible for it" (463-65). Later he repeats, "I killed her... By the prophetic orders of this god" (588,594; cf. 598-99). Apollo agrees: "... I am responsible For the murder of this man's mother" (579-80). On the other hand, the Furies are not at all interested in why Orestes acted as he did or whether Apollo or Zeus was involved. Their only concern is the unnatural death of a person, especially at the hands of a relative (Eu. 212,421 27). They say, "For where is there such incentive to kill one's mother? (Eu. 427 7io?) y?cp tooo?to K?vTpov ?&gt;? u?|TpoKTOV?iv;), and are unmoved by special pleading (383-84). There is no apparent way in which this conflict can be resolved, for it represents countervailing divine claims and altogether differ ent views on what constitutes justice. When the problem is finally brought to Athena for arbitration, the jury of Athenian citizens impaneled to resolve the dispute will not only make a decision on Orestes' guilt or innocence but will also thereby determine which system of justice is to prevail in the future. Against the Furies' reasonable arguments about tradition and their own responsibilities within the old order of things is posed Apollo's strange claim that it is a more serious crime to fail to avenge one's father than to kill one's mother, since the father, not the mother, is the true parent. Yet these specious arguments only serve to produce a hung jury, since the Furies have a legiti mate claim to their position and do not care whether Orestes is justified or not, believing that no justification is sufficient to turn aside divine retribu tion. The human jury is caught between the old and the new, where the new has its allure but the old retains its claims. As president of the court, Athena is required to break the tie. The point at issue here is not so much the logic of the decision (made on the notoriously dubious grounds?apparently justified by the new biology of the day?that the father is the true parent) but rather how justice can best</page><page sequence="29">Aeschylus' Genealogy of Morals 51 be achieved while at the same time preserving society. The Persians had con centrated on the fact that unprincipled violence is punished by destruction; the Oresteia in its turn concerns itself with the process by which justice is secured and the penalty determined. The old system of retributive justice as a purely mechanical thing, requiring in all cases that the nearest of kin take revenge for the death of a relative (an eye for an eye, a life for a life, blood for blood), stands opposed to a new system of trial by jury, which need not be mechanical but can rationally take into consideration motivation and extenu ating circumstances. The remarkable shift in emphasis observed here involves not simply the substitution of a political institution for family vengeance in the administration of justice, important though that step is, but also allows for the consideration of motives in the judgment of guilt or innocence. The introduction of a role for motivation points to the importance of the main springs of action, and whether an action is just depends upon whether or not it is carried out in accordance with the will of the gods and especially of Zeus, the guarantor of justice. That is to say, just actions depend on the recognition of a shared humanity and on the impossibility of attaining divinity. Injustice emerges when human beings place themselves in a position superior to their fellows that only the gods possess. This is why Aeschylus is concerned to show how motivation operates in the genealogy of morals and leads to virtue or vice depending on its point of origin. This is why piety?Aeschylus' own addition?plays such a crucial role in the genealogy. A jury trial can further guarantee a decision and an end to the process rather than requiring a continuous succession of retributive acts that can only end with the extinction of a family. The issue is between different systems of jus tice?that of the tribe versus that of the polis?and is reflected in the conflict between the two generations of gods: the old, earthly deities as represented by the Furies, who are at best neutral to human concerns and at worst hostile and malevolent, and the new heavenly Olympian gods embodied in Apollo and Athena, who represent Zeus and are benevolent toward mankind. For the Furies, Justice depends on the ability to carry it out: the strength of an indi vidual or family. Not so a jury trial, which relies on the strength and stability of the city. As in the Prometheus, the concern is with the relative merits of brute force and rational discourse. The outcome does not, as the Furies fear, throw the harmonia of the system off balance, but rather guarantees its effective ness in another way, a way more appropriate to the radical changes in society and the advances of civilization. Moral questions are judged to be not simply the concern of one person or of his family, but rather of all of society; every one benefits from their peaceful resolution and suffers from a failure to re solve them.</page><page sequence="30">52 James J. Helm These twin concerns, then, underscore the importance of the moral rela tionships expressed in the genealogy; motivation is crucial because it deter mines with which side of the ethical family tree a set of acts is connected. The jury trial is necessary to remove from the individual the burden of guilt asso ciated with punishing the wrong-doing of another. It takes responsibility for punishment from the family and places it with the state, thus signaling a de cline in the importance of the larger family unit and undercutting the force of the inherited curse that runs through more than one of Aeschylus' trilo gies. For the Oresteia the genealogy of moral ideals is fundamental to the working out of the plot and for the interconnection of the separate plays of the trilogy, and it contributes directly to the establishment of a new standard of justice. This is Aeschylus' answer to the pessimism and despair of a Theognis (see Dodds 1951: 30). VI. SUMMARY Aeschylus places himself firmly in the tradition of the koros-hybris-at? ethic proposed by Solon, but he revises that tradition by recognizing the impor tance of piety to the sequence. Piety?mortals' recognition of their common subordination to the divine and of their equal status to each other?is par ticularly important for Aeschylus because of his identification of the gods, especially Zeus, with justice. The notion that there is some objective principle of just and ethical conduct that exists independently of the narrowness of the individual human's experience and that is ultimately connected with his hap piness or misfortune in a profound way gives such a principle status in a so ciety where definitions of justice had previously rested with the individual and his family. The judgment of individuals is fragile and clouded by self interest and passion, whereas a jury can broaden the perspective of the judg ment and free it from the narrow concerns of the individual.49 There is for Aeschylus no automatic progression from wealth to ruin, but only a tendency, which can be resisted by intelligence born of learning to see the appropriate relationship of a person to the gods (eusebeia), to oneself (s?phrosun?), and to others (dikaiosun?). This is the framework of justice (Dike) that Aeschylus sees leading to prosperity (olbos)?not simply wealth, but well-being in a much broader sense: contentment with what one has. Solon saw the importance of justness, but Aeschylus contends that it depends on 49 Lebeck 206 n. 11: "oe?ac, ae?co, and oeuvo? are theme words, made conspicuous by repetition throughout the trilogy. This verbal recurrence is linked with the action of Eumenides, anticipates and plays upon it. In the last drama the Furies struggle to retain the reverence and honor owed them and are appeased when worshiped as Semnae, their local cult title among the Athenians."</page><page sequence="31">Aeschylus' Genealogy of Morals 53 something outside the individual: the recognition of the place of the individual in the universe, which he describes in terms of piety, and which embraces one's role in society and one's relationships with other human beings as well. In response to the problem that life does not seem to work that way, Aeschylus points to the new structure of justice that has been established in Athens, the jury trial that is intended to help to maintain the Justice of Zeus. Aeschylus exemplifies this view in a series of vignettes, first in the Persians with Xerxes and then in the Oresteia, starting with Paris and the Trojans, and continuing through Agamemnon and Clytemnestra, using the trilogy form to show a progression, and finally a break in the chain, as Orestes reaches a precarious wisdom.
