<plain_text><page sequence="1">Diedre L. BADEJO The Yoruba and Afro-American Trickster : A Contextual Comparison I. INTRODUCTION. Generally, tricksters are associated with negative behavior or acts. They represent a fairly universal folklore motif which defines them consistently as dupes. Although trickesters like Ijapa do function as such, comparative contextual examination of Esu and High John de Conquer also suggest other rôles. These diverse rôles disclose the worldviews which are couched within related social, cultural, political and/or economic contexts. I wish here to explore selected narratives of Esu, Ijapa and High John de Con quer as a modus operandi, to challenge their common image as dubious characters. My approach explores their context and con tent and consequently complements the approach presented by Jay Edwards' monograph, The Afro-American Trickster Tale: A Structuralist Approach (1978). Related to this rethinking of the term « trickster » is the per ception of such genres as oral literature and folklore. Briefly, folk lore connotes the lore, customs and mannerisms of folk trans mitted informally by word of mouth, and includes performance and non-performance arts. From my research, I believe that, unlike the general informality of folklore, oral literature includes the verbal and performing arts of a culture that are transmitted orally within a formal setting, adhere to specific aesthetic princi ples and are restricted to skilled initiates. The difference in methods of transmission parallels the different contexts found among the various motifs. Esu, Ijapa and High John de Conquer illustrate the ways in which meaning is influenced by these various contexts. My concerns differ from that of Henry Gates who focuses on the linguistic relationship between Esu and the Signi fying Monkey in his essay « A Myth of Origins » (1985 : 31-33). Moreover, unlike the twentieth century urban tale of the Signi</page><page sequence="2">PRÉSENCE AFRICAINE fying Monkey, the High John de Conquer tales evolve from the rural fields of enslavement during the pre-Civil War era. Conse quently, my approach also emerges « from within the black cul tural matrix » (Gates : « The Blackness of Blackness » : 285). II. IDENTIFYING CONTEXT. Esu, Ijapa and High John de Conquer display similarities as tricksters which are conditioned by these different contextual frame works. Esu is the Yoruba trickster deity whose mythology places him squarely in a sacred context (Abimbola : Ifa Divination Poetry : 1977). His oral literature evolves largely from a religious corpus maintained by a trained priesthood (Pemberton : 20-27 ; 66 70). As the universal policeman and keeper of the « ase » or secrets of the creation of the world in Yoruba cosmology, Esu's rôle extends beyond that of a mere trickster (Abimbola : Ifa ; Farris Thompson : Flash of the Spirit ; Idowu : Olodumare). Ijapa is the trickster tortoise whose tales are widely known among the Yoruba (Babalola : Akojopo Alo Ijapa). The adven tures of Ijapa have appeared in many anthologies of African folk lore and are told by children and adults alike. These secular tales demonstrate the misdeeds of Ijapa as a trickster in its commonly accepted sense. Like the narratives of Ijapa, the tales of High John de Conquer also belong to the secular world (Hurston : Mules and Men : 61-122). Although they are no longer as widely known among Afro-Americans today, my research indicates that this tale cycle was well distributed during slavery. As told mainly by the enslaved, High John trekked through heaven and hell as well as the soil to outwit « Ole Massa ». In this respect, the nature of his character suggests a symbiosis of the sacred and secular contexts of Esu and Ijapa. Thus, while this symbiosis offers an example of fusion of these characters, it also reveals their reformation in the New World context. Exploration of their transformational forms and objectives sheds some light on the similarities as well as distinctions among these three specific tricksters.</page><page sequence="3">THE YORUBA AND AFRO-AMERICAN TRICKSTER... 5 III. CONTEXT AND CONTENT IN YORUBA AND AERO AMERICAN TRICKSTERS. As noted above, Esu and Ijapa represent the tricksters' pre sence in Yoruba sacred and secular verbal arts and High John represents the trickster's existence in Afro-American folklore and culture. As such, where Esu often symbolizes fate, High John symbolizes survival. While Esu and Ijapa are meant to reinforce Yoruba moral codes, High John tales are meant to subvert the oppressive codes of the slavocracy. Consequently, I view the latter as a primary symbol of Afro-American folkloric expression. He is a mediational character who is at once man, animal, demi-god and Nature. Indeed, when he becomes Brer Rabbit, juju man, a whisper, air and a root, the images created by these transforma tions embody the merger of the Yoruba sacred and profane cos mology (Hurston in Bontemps &amp; Hughes : 93-102). Appreciation of these transformations remains crucial to the question of « context ». Since, in Yoruba mythology, the deities look and behave like human beings, Esu maintains the qualities and characteristics of an anthropomorphic divinity despite his challenge or disguise (Soyinka : 27). Moreover, while Esu remains a god even in his many transformations in Yoruba oral literary traditions, High John does become a man and suffers the humi liation of the lash and enslavement on behalf of those he wishes to preserve. Esu's guardianship of the intersection between the sacred and the secular worlds is exemplified by his inspection of all sacrifices left for his companion deities at the crossroads. But unlike Esu, who mediates between both worlds, High John mediates within both worlds for his companion-slaves. This Afro-American trickster mediates in the ethereal world between its forces and his enslaved beneficiaries as well as in the mundane world between its forces and those same enslaved beneficiaries. There are two reasons for this dual mediation. First, as we know, this New World context destroyed or submerged the African institutions which generated and protected the formal organization and practice of such archetypal socio-religious cus toms represented by the priesthood of Esu. Hence, the attributes of the deity remain but without the customary rites and rituals of a priesthood to preserve those same attributes within a purely sacred context. Consequently, in the New World, the prototype of Esu must work both sides, so to speak. Second, the political, economic and social demands of the New World context differed radically from the former Yoruba ones. For instance, the Western idea of rugged individualism was</page><page sequence="4">6 PRESENCE AFRICAINE juxtaposed against the beseiged idea of communalism. In fact, the Ijapa tales bear witness to the force with which individualism, greed and selfishness were eschewed. Hence, these radical changes, along with the deinstitutionalization of various African social structures, altered the trickster motif. Nonetheless, rudi mentary aspects of cultural consciousness continued to influence the evolution of African-American literary traditions as witnessed by the existence of African related trickster and tale motifs (Dundes : 1978). In the case of High John, that meant that the secular wit and cunning of Ijapa served as the nemesis for the slave system. In that rôle, however, secular wit and cunning also symbolized an inversion of the mundane trickster from a selfish to a witty character whose actions benefited his companions. IV. THE TRICSKTER'S INTENTIONS. Generally, the term « trickster » conjures up images of one who dupes or tricks another character or her/his community. According to the Dictionary of Folklore and Mythology (1123 1125), such a creature creates havoc, causes disharmony and gener ally exists on the periphery of any given social order. The trickster is perceived as cunning, malicious, selfish, greedy and deceptive. Consequently, she/he uses wit to further their own ends, to escape responsibility or to dupe another character for amusement. Yet, on rare occasions, the trickster assists other characters or the commu nity in resolving their dilemmas. Irrespective of motivations, the trickster perceives the opponents' weaknesses and uses that infor mation advantageously. While this universal view of the trickster adequately suits Ijapa, it falls short of defining the nature of either Esu or High John. For example, Esu operates in a sacred realm which struc tures his behavior. Thus his rôle includes that of universal poli ceman and keeper of the « ase » which Olodumare used to create the world. In this sacred environment, he is also the guardian of the crossroads, the « inspector-general » for Olodumare and the one through whom sacrifice first must pass before it can be accepted by any other divinity. Esu then is the messenger of Olo dumare, the divinities and humanity. According to Idowu, he in spects the sacrificial offerings and the quality of worship. Those who are found lacking are struck by his cudgel (80-85). Hence, this trickster deity, as guardian of the crossroads, symbolizes chance, uncertainty, decision and fate. Idowu notes that Esu's nature is so precarious that « one must be wary of what one says</page><page sequence="5">THE YORUBA AND AFRO-AMERICAN TRICKSTER... 7 about him » (80). Yet, true to the trickster nature, Esu does deceive, usually disguised as an innocent or incidental character. More importantly, he poses choice which implies fate and possible duplicity. When he does play the dupe, he brings discord, upheaval and confusion where peace and tranquility may have reigned. Yet, on other occasions, he assists both his companion deities and huma nity by reversing misfortune (Idowu : 81 ; Abimbola : Sixteen Great Poems : 27-28). Clearly then, Esu is more than a trickster god for he marshals both human and divine order. Subsequently, his nature suggests that the term « trickster » includes the notion of the hypothetical, or « what if » ; the evaluation of conditions, or « how come » and the challenge of the crossroads where dual ity and transcendence reside. While Esu is thus defined within the Yoruba cosmos, High John is defined within the environment of the enslaved African in the Western World (Hurston in Negro Folklore). His context is secular for he dwells among human beings and mediates adversity on their behalf. Like Esu, he defies simple definition. He func tions specifically for an oppressed people who themselves exist on the periphery of the New World's social order (Edwards : 72-79). More often than not, his deeds result in some form of improved conditions, release or feast for the enslaved community and, occa sionally, himself, at the expense of the individual slave-owner. In this regard, High John represents an inversion of Ijapa whose objectives are more self-gratifying and much less altruistic (Holt : 153-157). Nevertheless, he is similar to Ijapa in his use of wit and perceptivity. Their objectives are also similar. Ijapa and High John are weaker characters who must dupe a stronger or more powerful opponent in order to overcome a lack. Neither of them, however, parallels Esu who is the keeper of the secrets of creation and therefore manifests and manipulates power. In short, unlike the other two, Esu does not confront an oppressive or stronger opponent than himself. Furthermore, while High John, we are told, has power, and Ijapa is simply a magician, neither of them are power brokers like Esu whose pronouncements can greatly alter one's fate. * * * According to Hurston's essay in the Book of Negro Folklore, High John was a « will-to-hope » and an expression of the oppressed to persevere with their dignity and their humanity intact (91-95) :</page><page sequence="6">8 PRESENCE AFRICAINE « High John de Conquer came to be a man, and a mighty man at that. But he was not a natural man in the beginning. First off, he was a whisper, a will to hope, a wish to find something worthy of laughter and song. Then the whisper put flesh. His footsteps sounded across the world in a low but musical rhythm as if the world he walked on was a sing ing-drum. The black folks had an irresistible impulse to laugh. High John de Conquer was a man in full and had come to live and work on the plantations, and all the slave folks knew him in the flesh. The sign of this man was a laugh, and his singing-symbol was a drum-beat. No parading drum-shout like soldiers out for show. It did not call to the feet of those who were fixed to hear it. It was an inside thing to live by. It was sure to be heard when and where the work was the hardest, and the lot the most cruel. It helped the slaves endure. They knew that something better was coming. So they laughed in the face of things and sang 'I'm so glad ! Trouble don't last always'. And the white people who heard them were struck dumb that they could laugh. In an outside way, this was Old Massa's fun, so what was Old Cuffy laughing for ? » (p. 93 94 : my emphasis). High John then is a culture hero whose charge includes bring ing laughter to a people immersed in sorrow. As culture hero, he disrupts a perverse social order whose stability creates havoc for the enslaved. As Holt demonstrates, this inversion allows those held captive to escape vicariously through High John's actions and to maintain their humanity through his laughter (152-159). In these tales, he employs his wit as a vehicle for the expression of that « inside thing to live by » — not only as a means to dupe or challenge a stronger and more powerful opponent but also to satisfy the quest of the human soul for survival. His tricks benefit a collective group rather than a specific individual. Again, Hurston notes : « Old Massa couldn't know, of course, but High John de Conquer was there walking his plantation like a natural man. He was treading the sweat-flavored clods of the plan tation, crushing out his drum tunes, and giving out secret laughter. He walked on the winds and moved fast. Maybe he was in Texas when the lash fell on a slave in Alabama, but before the blood was dry on the back, he was there. A faint pulsing of a drum lile a goat-skin stretched over the heart, that came nearer and closer, then somebody in the saddened quarters would feel like laughing and say, 'Now,</page><page sequence="7">THE YORUBA AND AFRO-AMERICAN TRICKSTER... 9 High John de Conquer, Old Massa couldn't get the best of him. That old John was a case !'. Then everybody sat up and began to smile. Yes, yes, that was right. Old John, High John could beat the unbeatable. He was top-superior to the whole mess of sorrow. He could beat it all and, what made it so cool, finish it off with a laugh. So they pulled the covers up over their souls and kept them from all hurt, harm and danger and made them a laugh and a song. Night time was a joke, because daybreak was on the way. Dis tance and the impossible had no power over High John de Conquer » (Negro Folklore 94 : my emphasis). In this passage, Hurston outlines the context for this Afro American trickster as the socio-political culture of New World plantations. High John is both ethereal since he « walked on the winds » and mundane since he « walked his plantation ». Hurs ton's reference to his movement between Texas and Alabama con firms the wide popularity these tales enjoyed among enslaved Africans. Examples like these illustrate the subtle nuances of cul tural transformation. Retained within these images are the meta phors of a changing worldview. In short, resistance to the dehum anization required to render them more thant just physical slaves y is expressed in and by the High John cycle : « He had come from Africa. He came walking on the waves of sound. Then he took on flesh after he got there. The sea captains of ships knew that they brought slaves in their ships. They knew about those black bodies huddled down there in the middle passage, being hauled across the waters to heplessness. John de Conquer was walking the very winds that filled the sails of the ship. He followed them like the albatross » {op. cit., 94). Again, Hurston : « John de Conquer was a bottom-fish. He was deep. He had the wisdom tooth of the East in his head. Way over there, where the sun rises a day ahead of time, they say that Heaven arms with love and laughter those it does not wish to see destroyed. He who carries his heart in his sword must perish. So says the ultimate law. High John knew a lot of things like that. He who wins from within is in the 'be' class. 'Be' here when the ruthless man comes and 'be' here when he is gone » {ibid., 95 : my emphasis). Thus, he reflects both the vision of African cultural transform</page><page sequence="8">10 PRÉSENCE AFRICAINE ation in the Western Hemisphere and the ability to believe in the possibility of such a transformation of values. In America, African culture collided with its European counterpart which con tinued to view African Americans and their perspectives as ana thema to Western development. The existence of the High John tales among the enslaved imposed a dialectic between African and European worldviews ; between the powerless and the powerful ; between the captives and the captors. As Houston Baker demons trates, from the juncture of this dialectic evolved the Blues (3-14). Given this example, a more useful definition of « trickster » in the diaspora context should include transcendence as well as wit over force. This aspect of the definition, however, excludes Esu who does not transcend but guards the matrix of transcendency. In short, the term « trickster » suggests not only a literary figure who dupes for self-aggrandizement but also one who challenges an established social order and probes the question of fate. V. ACTING OUT : THE TRICKSTERS' MOVES. As demonstrated earlier, unlike his African archetypes whose rôles are to reinforce prevailing Yoruba social mores, High John's rôle is to overthrow the social order of the New World. He exists beyong the ritual and traditionally defined structures found in the former. Soyinka's discussion of the interdependency between the deities and humanity, for instance, is instructive. He notes that the orisa risk the perils of the gulf of transition in order to re unite with humanity. They do so because of their dependence on the human community for existence. High John, however, will ingly relinquishes prominence among the enslaved and transforms into a root after slavery (Hurston in Bontemps &amp; Hughes : 101 102). He remains close at hand, we are told, in case of trouble ! Inevitably, he keeps the humanity of his enslaved companions alive, in contrast to the Yoruba community which interacts with its deities in order to keep both the divinities and humanity vibrant. The purpose of the latter interaction is to reinforce cul tural, social and political cohesion (Soyinka : 143-157). Instead, in the New World context, High John exists beyons the African ins titutions from which'he evolved. In shor,t, he nurtures the souls of black folk who found in his tales a means of preserving their dignity and their faith while expressing the dilemma of their cruel and foreign experience. Although these tales clearly belong to the informal transmis sion generally present in the folklore genre, his characterization</page><page sequence="9">THE YORUBA AND AFRO-AMERICAN TRICKSTER... 11 and activités suggest that, like Esu, he maintains a foot in each world. On the one hand, he travels to heaven and hell, taking the souls of the enslaved with him. In such tales, he provides them with a spiritual nourishment from which spirituals, Blues and jazz blossom. In a word, their journey with him represents the meta phor of their cultural evolution and experience. On the other hand, his own slave labor frequently serves as a vehicle through which he dupes the master into providing his companion slaves regularly with meat, a most rare commodity in the slave diet. In such tales, the successful duping of the slave-owner benefits the enslaved through freedom, food or leisure (Hurston : Mules and Men, 96-122). Compare these actions to those of Ijapa who acquires food or other benefits without labor. Obviously, High John's objective is to escape oppression, unlike Ijapa whose objective is to escape responsibility. VI. EXAMPLES FROM THE ORAL NARRATIVES. Since Esu is the guardian of the crossroads and the messenger deity of the Yoruba pantheon, he symbolizes chance and challenge. He represents the crossroads where fate is determined in both the sacred and the secular realms. As Gates points out, Esu's limp sug gests that he has one foot in the sacred and one in the secular world (« A Myth of Origins » : 33). Unlike High John, he remains a sacred icon because his mythology is a crucial component of Yoruba cosmology. Thus, he continually functions within its elabo rate religious structure. Even today, the worship of Esu remains institutionalized by its specific cosmic and religious structure ; it is maintained by a trained priesthood in conjunction with a ruling hierarchy and is supported by the patronage of its worshippers. The presence of the deity is depicted in icons, on opon trays, in laterite rock and sculptures (Abimbola : Ifa Divination, 9 ; Farris Thompson : 21-25). He resides at a cultural matrix where he personifies duality, complexity and challenge. Although his image faces that of Ifa on the opon (divining) tray, he is not in opposition to Ifa, deity of wisdom. Rather, Esu complements Ifa's interpretation of events : first, by monitoring the provisions of sacrifice ; second, by challenging the client to act upon the dic tates of consultation ; third, by controlling the ase or creative /destructive power of the universe (Abimbola : 9 ; Idowu : 80-82). An Ifa odu from the Bascom Collection illustrates the first two. Note here that Ifa is passive while Esu becomes the prime actor :</page><page sequence="10">12 PRÉSENCE AFRICAINE « 'Sore throat takes the good from the plate' was the one who cast Ifa for all the people of the earth when they were afflicted with illness. Esu says that the sacrifice will be effective if they will do as he says. The people on earth came and sacrificed one basket of snails, one ram and three shillings and six pence. From that time on, the world began to be good » (Bascom : 476). As we know, koloko (sore throat) is an infectious disease which prevents one from eating. In this particular Ifa odu, the epidemic has affected « all the peoole of the earth ». Although Ifa diagnoses and prescribes the cure for the disease, Esu directly challenges the « people on earth » to present the full measure of the offering. After they have done so, « the world began to be good ». In this example, Esu represents the bridge between disease and health. True to his nature, his acceptance or rejection of the offering will determine cure or prolong agony. Nonetheless, he mediates the mundane within the spiritual, the earthly confron tation with the heavenly from within a sacred context. In other words, he is the essence of duality. * * * In a different example, Ijapa (the trickster tortoise) dwells spe cifically in the context of the mundane or earthly realms. As noted previously, he displays qualities and actions usually asso ciated with the most common use of the term « trickster ». His greed and laziness motivate him to dupe larger or more powerful creatures. His adversaries are both human and animal. Like High John, he frequently is punished but, unlike the latter, his chief beneficiary is himself. Courlander defines Ijapa « as aprojection of evil forces and bad behavior against which mankind must contend » (1975 : 221). Such a definition takes him out of the secular context where he belongs and places him in the sacred context of the ajogun (or malevolent forces in Yoruba cosmology) but he is a secular manifestation of non-conformist behavior. He dwells within the social structure as opposed to Esu (who resides within the cosmic structure) and he functions to challenge the social restrictions as opposed to Esu (who enforces cosmic order). Notably, Ijapa is individualistic where his society is communal. He sleeps while his community works ; he indulges in life's pleasures where his community practises cons traint. He reflects the individual will to follow its own dictates and to exploit the endless possibilities of the intellect. In the tale, « Ijapa and Yanrinbo [sic] Swear An Oath »,</page><page sequence="11">THE YORUBA AND AFRO-AMERICAN TRICKSTER... 13 Ijapa and his wife, Yannibo, neglect their farming and marketing responsibilities : « As it is known to all, Ijapa was shifltess and did not tend his own garden. His wife, Yanrinbo, spent all her time making conversation with other women, sometimes in the market, sometimes on the trail, sometimes at the stream where the laundering was done. Between the two of them, nothing was ever put away for a time of need. There came a drought in the country, and food was scarce. Other people did not have enough food supplies to spare anything for Ijapa and his wife. They were faced with starvation. Ijapa said : 'Our neighbor, Bamidele, has a storage house full of yams. It is not right that he has yams while we. have none' » (226-227). Because Ijapa knows the imperatives by which the society oper ates, he plans a trick that will relieve him of guilt. He tells Yan nibo to take her basket and sit on his shoulders. She does so, and in this way they proceed to Bamidele's barn where they steal several of his yams. When there are suspected, the chief orders them before the shrine where a priest prepares a bowl of agbo. If they are telling the truth, then the herbal drink will not harm them : if they are lying, they will become ill and die. Ijapa swears : « If I, Ijapa, the husband of Yanrinbo [sic], ever stret ched up my hand to remove yams from Bamidele's storage house, may I fall sick instantly and die » (226). Then Yannibo swears : « If I, Yanrinbo [sic], wife of Ijapa, ever used my legs to carry me to Bamidele's storage house to steal yams, may I fall sick instantly and die » (226-227). Of course, neither dies because they swear to a specific truth and thus escape punishment. Ijapa repeats such antics in several tales where food is acquired by devious means which manipulates the social order. * * * Like Esu, High John's powers are bestowed from a cosmic</page><page sequence="12">14 PRÉSENCE AFRICAINE source and, like Ijapa, these powers are primarily for secular pur poses. As one of Hurston's informants notes : « (...) High John de Conquer means power. That's bound to be so. He came to teach and tell us. God didn't leave nobody ignorant (...) ». Now back in slavery time, us didn't have no power of protection, and God knowed it, and put us under watch care. Rattlesnakes never bit no colored folks until four years after freedom was declared. That was to give us time to learn and know (...) He [High John] had done teached the black folks so they knowed a hundred years ahead of time that freedom was coming. Long before the white folks knowed anything about it at all » (95-96). With the « drum beat » as his symbol, High John was the laughter that kept them from crying. For High John (as noted) « walked on the winds » : « Distance and the impossible had no power over High John. Old Massa met our hopebringer all right, but when Old Massa met him, he was not going by his right name. He was travelling and touristing around the plantations as the laugh-provoking Brer Rabbit (...) All the time, there was High John de Conquer playing his tricks of making a way out of no way » (Negro Folklore : 95). « To make a way out of no way » : the symbolic egress of Brer Rabbit also reminds us of the wily escapades of Ijapa who constantly made a way out by the mere fact of his regenerative powers. He, like Brer Rabbit, may become trapped or be punished for his misdeeds but nonetheless survives. Yet survival, in the High John tale cycle, is not a matter of personal triumph but a collective triumph further exemplified by the body of this rich folklore — the spirituals, work songs and Blues. Once again, context is important for while High John's nature and power seem to parallel these forces, his actions benefit the slave commu nity from whence he sprang. In a tale from Mules and Men (112), John wins the trust of Ole Massa who then leaves him in charge of the plantation while he and Ole Miss travel to Philly-Me-York. John sends one slave each three miles north, south, east and west to gather slaves from those plantations within that boundary for a party during Ole Massa's absence. He sends the^ rest to kill hogs « until you can walk on them ». John dresses up in Ole Massa's clothes, gets a</page><page sequence="13">THE YORUBA AND AFRO-AMERICAN TRICKSTER... 15 cigar and begins to call « figgers » for the square dance. The nar rative continues : « Bout this time, John seen a white couple come in but they looked so trashy he figgered they was piney woods crackers, so he told 'em to g'wan out in de kitchen and git some barbecue and likker and to stay out there where they belong » (113). Of course, the couple turns out to be Ole Massa and Ole Miss who swear that they will have him hung on the persimmon tree. John gets permission to have a few last words with his friend, Jack, who becomes an accomplice in the plan to trick Ole Massa. With the rope around his neck, John is granted one last prayer : « So John knelt down. 'O Lord, here Ah am at de foot of de persimmon tree. If you're gointer destroy Old Massa tonight, with his wife and chillun and everything he got, lemme see it lightnin'. Jack up the tree, struck a match. Old Massa caught hold of John and said : 'John, don't pray no more'. John said : 'Oh yes, turn me loose so Ah can pray. O Lord, here Ah am tonight callin' on Thee and Thee alone. If you are gointer destroy Old Massa tonight, his wife and chillun and all he got, Ah want to see it lightnin' again'. Jack struck another match and Old Massa started to run. He give John his freedom and a heap of land and stock. He run so fast that it took a express train running at the rate of ninety miles an hour and six months to bring him back, and that's how come black folks got they freedom today » (114). Like Ijapa, High John knows the society in which he operates. He is a student of its strengths and weaknesses and his actions manipulate them. Like Esu, he passes « the way » but, unlike the divinity, he requires no further sacrifice. His loyalty to his « folk » remains a powerful force : « High John de Conquer went back to Africa but he left his power here and placed his American dwelling in the root of a certain plant. Only possess that root and he can be summoned at any time » (Hurston in Bontemps and Hughes : 96).</page><page sequence="14">16 PRÉSENCE AFRICAINE VII. CONCLUSION. Where Esu is esoteric, High John is eclectic. Esu is grounded in the oral literary traditions of Yoruba language and culture. While High John's roots draw sustenance from African soil, his branches and leaves are nourished by his New World environ ment. Unlike Esu, his function, purpose and powers are specifi cally concerned with the survival of his spiritual heirs in Afro America. Thus, his challenges occur outside his ethno-cultural community, while Esu's and Ijapa's occur within theirs. Moreover, while he possesses power, he does not use it to rein force the social order as Esu is constrained to do. Instead, High John uses those powers to rebel against it. In this sense, he resembles Ijapa in behavior although not in function. Considering the function and relationship of Esu, Ijapa and High John discloses their inter-relatedness and further elaborates on the significance of the « black cultural matrix » (Gates : ibid.). The question of context for the trickster motif in African and Afro-American literary studies demonstrates to us not only the semantic complexity of the term « trickster » but also its complex perspectives.
