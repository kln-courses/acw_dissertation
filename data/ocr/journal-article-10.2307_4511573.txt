The author apparently has little familiarity with evolutionary theory, and his ignorance makes him antagonistic. We find such statements as "to make up to the twenty-five recognised species of Atlantic gull (sic), the original ancestral stock did not exceed more than about four recognisable super species." If Stokes really does understand what a superspecies is, he fails to enlighten the reader. And does he understand what a species is? "The ways of scientists are indeed difficult for the mere layman to understand." Birds sometimes look the same and are called different species "yet no one doubts that (the north European man and the pigmy) are merely race variations of the species H. sapiens." If you like anthropomorphic descriptions of birds, attend to the Herring Gull which "is one of the most evil scoundels of all birds . . . Nothing is too despicable for the Herring Gull." And some of the writing is simply poor: "The name [of the Adelie Penguin] is derived from Madam Adelie Durville, after whom the bird was originally named." It is unfortunate that the illustrator, Shackleton, did not write the text, for his preface is the most literate of its kind I have read: "A fickle task-master, the ocean has guided a trend of evolution for those who live off her bounty, with scope enough to make the flightless penguin equally as successful an animal as the long-winged albatross." And the masterful Shackleton sums up for us his subjects: "They bewitch us and humiliate us with their unassuming mastery of wind, water and whereabouts. They provide inspiration and example for mariners and aeronauts alike, but that is not all. Since man first ventured into their domain they have offered the solace of live company and visual delight where their need is greatest." Buy this book, read Shackleton's preface, marvel at his illustrations, but forget the text.-Jack P. Hailman. 86. Wildfowl 19. G. V. T. Mathews and M. A. Ogilvie. 1968. Wildfowl Trust, Slimbridge, Gloucestershire, England. 172 pp. $2.50 paperback-Wild- fowl 19 is the continuation of the old Wildfowl Trust Annual Reports, which went 18 volumes. The new issue contains 18 papers (some of which are noted elsewhere: see reviews 8, 16, 36, 38, 45, 46), an editorial, some miscellaneous reports, and the annual report of the Trust. It is an attractive volume (the cover painting and drawings by Peter Scott help greatly), and yet a scientific one too. It contains magnificent photographs. Some of the contributions lack summaries, an omission that is tantamount to criminal in the modern age of information explosion. And lest Americans get confused, "wildfowl" means only ducks, geese and swans, not all wild fowl. The new publishing concept is a good one, and we shall await Wildfowl 20 with anticipation.-Jack P. Hailman. NOTES AND NEWS The Bowdoin Scientific Station (Kent Island, Grand Manan, New Brunswick, Canada) offers facilities for research, on colonial sea-birds in particular.
