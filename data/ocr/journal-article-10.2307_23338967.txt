<plain_text><page sequence="1">Konkani Scene A Cheerful Blossoming OLIVINHO GOMES "I 989 ended on a vibrant note that brought a good deal of cheer to the faithful. The literary pot was kept on the boil by veter ans who stirred out of their slumber of a long spell of apparent hibernation with offerings of prose and poetry and drama, which did not exactly break bold new paths or provide propulsions of any magnitude but did not also yield signs of any noticeable decline in their literary health. On the other hand there was a cheerful blossoming all around in hitherto uncultivated terrain, auguring a fruitful season ahead, apart from some robust writing in the much-ploughed domains from the younger writers. A few names that had been glimmering on the literary horizon of the language for some time now, strayed more fully into its ken with significant writing that drew critical notice. Many from the rising generation, particularly of the long deprived sections of society, found their vigorous voice listened to with av?e for the first time while they made their debut in prose and poetry that held out promise of varying gradation. A critical and scholarly vein of writing also surfaced, though rather insub stantially but with enough dynamism to give the necessary drive in this sphere of rather sparse cultivation. There was also a trend towards compilation of anthologies of stories and folklore as well as audio-cassettes and translation? from other Indian languages into Kpnkarti,</page><page sequence="2">142 / Indian Literature The fiftieth anniversary of the Konkani Sahitya Parishad (actually the Konkani Bhasha Mandal/Parishad) was celebrated at a festive session in Manipal, Karnataka, that being an auspicious occasion for, inter alia, a seminar on language development, and publication of books. Among these was a short history of Konkani literature, with glimpses of prose and poetry from various periods, done by this writer. A similar scholarly work was brought out later by Matthew Almeida in the form of a linguistic grammar of Konkani, written in English on modern lines. A talk dealing with a few aspects of vocabulary on a comparative scale in respect of Konkani and Hindi done by A.R. Bhat was incorporated in a booklet published by Konkani Bhasha Mandal, Goa. An attempt to present some considera tions on literary criticism was made in a book by S.M. Tadkod. It was the year of the centenary of Konkani journalism too. Eduardo Jose Bruno de Souza, the pioneer in this and other genres like the novel and epic poetry, had brought to light the first Konkani periodical, Udentechem Sallok (The Lotus of the East) on 2 February, 1889, from Pune, though the first pi inting press in India had been installed in Goa in 1556 and the earliest books that came out of it from 1568 onwards were in Konkani. That provided an opportunity for the Dalgado Konkani Academy to organise a function where books and a cassette were released. The cassette featured lyric poems by the present writer, recited by himself and set to music by Maestro Antoninho de Souza and sung by professional singers, a new experiment in Konkani poetry. Also declared published on this occasion was a book of reflections from Fr. Antonio Pereira, the youthful elder, as part of his continuing prolific output. Later in the year, on his seventieth birthday on twentyfifth August, he presented us with a succinct and candid autobiographical narra tive. Reminiscences about his own life in the last phase of the Goan freedom struggle were told sensitively by Zotico de Souza. The short story in Konkani this year has taken considerable strides, gaining more adepts and furthering the range and depth of subjects handled, both in Goa and Mangalore, the two regions Nov.-Dec. 1990</page><page sequence="3">A Cheerful Blossoming / 143 which account for the bulk of the literary output. While novelist Sten Ageira in Mangalore continued his work in the realm of fiction with yet another collection of short stories, his contem porary in Goa, Damodar Mauzo while analysing man-woman relationships, as is his wont, digressed into space research and the search for peace. Abhaykumar Velingkar dissected contem porary issues of love and sex, while his much older colleague, Shantaram Hedo, surprised us with a bunch of short stories relating homely situations of domestic and social life. The short story collection that stood out in the year's crop was undoubtedly Jayanti Naik's, providing a forceful portrayal of rural women no longer willing to be doormats, throwing a challenge to the authoritarian behaviour of their men folk, with earthy jargon that crackles in dicy dialogue. It is another sweeping gale from rural Goa after Pundalik Naik's bursting on the scene some decades ago. Pundalik has, however, mellowed considerably since then, though his latest collection in this genre adds up to his saga of rural Goa awakening to the social changes. An anthology of short stories by women writers, edited by Gladys Rego, of Mangalore, attracted notice, dealing with issues that concern the fairer sex, rather belligerently. Some presentations at a seminar on women's issues too, restricted, however, to only one community in Goa, were put together by Hema Naik in another such compilation. Such a collection of articles essentially, comes from Fr. Vincent Menezes, editor of the Mangalore weekly, Raknno. Another kind of compilation has been of the traditional folktales in Karnataka, ably done by Santoshkumar Gulvady, editor of an important Kannada periodical. Folk-tales of the Konkanis of Kerala along with some parables taken from the discourses of Srimad Sudhindra Tirth Swamiji, were collected by P. Ramesh Pai. Konkani folklore in the matter of the Ramayana tradition originally written on palm leaves hundreds of years ago was discovered, edited and transliterated into devanagari script, with a scholarly introduction, by R.K. Rao No. 140</page><page sequence="4">144 / Indian Literature of the Konkani Language Institute of Cochin. An established short story writer like Chandrakant Keni came up with a collection of essays, which many of his short stories are in a way, reflecting his experience as a journalist, more in the nature of personal statements and views. The essay seems to have claimed considerable attention from writers like Bliikaji Ghanekar who usually handle other genres like verse for children. His book of essays on what he calls 'the colourful life' are spicy descriptions of a humorous character, culled from his vaiied medical experience. Lakshmikant Paraz who has been writing mostly in Marathi, made his entry on the Konkani literary scene with a collection of essays that ripple with humour too, an irreverent account of his encounters with famous and not so famous personalities. Poetry has always held the pride of place in Konkani and this year was no exception. In fact there were more outpourings this time from the younger poets and poetesses in particular. There were only two collections from the established frater nity, Nagesh Karmali having brought out his book, after a long spell of silence, in his stormy diction, drawing on recollections of his turbulent life; and Ramesh Veluskar's book singing of the beauties of anthropomorphic nature with which he merges him self, with the miscellaneous songs and roundelays in keeping with his earlier work in the same strain. There were several books from the younger lot. A significant debut was made by Nilba Khandekar giving vigorous yet rasping voice to the underprivileged in fiery lines that arrest notice. Nayana (Surla kar) Adarkar's and Maya Kharangate's poems exhibit promise of better things to come from them. Two collections of poems that make a forceful impact in this group are those of Arun Sakhardande and R. Ramnath, who deserve to be watched with high expectations. Similar is the collection of poems by Melwyn Rodrigues of Mangalore who has also offered us his first book for appreciation. J.B. Sequeira, the resourceful veteran from Mangalore too, now living in Bombay, took serious stock of his life and dreams in a contemplative mood that hovers over Nov.-Dec. 1990</page><page sequence="5">A Cheerful Blossoming / 145 his moving lines, while in Kerala Vatsala M. Rao poured her heart out with a deep sense of devotion. Drama made an important contribution this year unlike the previous ones, with Mangalore's accomplished playwright, C.F.D'Costa's plays coming out in devanagari script, thus enlarging his readership, while providing instructive fare and entertainment in his poetic handling of themes, uncovering the fallible humanity that lurks in the cloisters of priesthood and hearth and home. Another significant collection from Goa, this time, of one-act plays dwelling on the current politico-social scene, soused in satire, was authored by Dattaram BambolkaÂ»' in trenchant humour. Prabhakar Tendulkar made his debut in drama too with his one-acts on social themes, touching on current affairs. There was a large crop of novels from Mangalore. Dolfy Lobo's novel explored the complexities of love relationships between the two sexes. Lancy Pinto Naik's two novels depicted the situation and conflicts arising out of the life of a man work ing in the Gulf and another about a girl's journey through life. Leo D'Souza's and J.S. Silva's novels dealt with domestic issues while Rony Monteiro tended to be running along a suspense trail. Joy Paladka's novelette signalled the appearance of a budding talent, while L. Coutinho's had echoes of Murder in the Cathedral. Translations from other Indian languages have begun coming into Konkani in increasing number. There was one from Mala yalam and another from Bengali this year, done by R.K. Rao and N.N. Anandan, from Kerala, respectively, swelling the corpus of a distinctive Konkani literature, apart from some translations of the popular variety, done by Walter Lasrado. This will, it is hoped, provide the necessary catalyst in the stimulation of more qualitative literature in the language in the present period of its ongoing renaissance and, what is more important, re-integrate it fully into the literary mainstream of the country.
