<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> English Negligence Law  as a Human Practice Richard Mullender* Abstract. Three of the concerns identified by Paul Rabinow as central to the Human Practices thrust  of the SynBERC project feature in the English common law of negligence. They are the logic of prac- tical judgment, mutual flourishing, and capacity building. In two further ways, English negligence  law has relevance to the SynBERC project. It provides an example of “equipment” in the sense speci- fied by Rabinow and it is an institution informed by a number of sometimes antagonistic purposes.  This essay seeks to point up English negligence law’s relevance to the SynBERC project by focusing  on three of its more prominent features. They are the way in which judges incrementally elaborate ex- isting doctrine, the moral impulses that inform the law, and the way in which this branch of tort gives  expression to an ideal of community.

I n t r o d u c t I o n The common law of negligence, as elaborated in England, provides an example  of an institution in which three of the substantive concerns central to the Hu- man Practices thrust of the SynBERC project figure prominently.1 These con- cerns are, on Paul Rabinow’s account, the logic of practical judgment, mutual  flourishing, and capacity-building among those who participate in particular  practices.2 When English judges develop negligence law in response to novel  claims for compensation, they exercise practical judgment. They also seek to  fashion a body of doctrine that is just and that works to establish an environment  Law &amp; Literature, Vol. 21, Issue 3, pp. 321–33. issn 13-68x, electronic issn 141-2601. © 2009 by The  Cardozo School of Law of Yeshiva University.

Likewise, they seek (through the  guidance they give in their judgments) to foster among negligence law’s ad- dressees the capacity to manage reasonably foreseeable sources of risk. For two further reasons, the body of law we will be examining has rel- evance to the SynBERC project. Alongside the intensely practical concerns  listed earlier, the SynBERC project is concerned with the (general) concept of  “equipment.”3 This concept embraces practices that are, according to Rabi- now, “situated between the traditional terms of method and technology.”4 As  we will see, method looms large in negligence law. This is, for example, the  case when judges incrementally extend existing doctrine to sets of circum- stances not previously regulated by the law. But negligence law is also a form  of technology. For it affords a means by which to regulate a rapidly changing  environment in ways that judges should (if they are acting in accordance with  ideals internal to negligence law) be able to describe as just. As well as being  a form of “equipment,” the law of negligence also provides an example of a  type of human practice in which a number of (sometimes antagonistic) objec- tives are discernible. Here, again, we find a feature of negligence law that has  relevance to the SynBERC project. For the Human Practices thrust of the  SynBERC project focuses attention on the “objectives” that inform specific  practices.5 But before we develop the points outlined here, we must examine  negligence law in some detail. I I .  n e g l I g e n c e  l a w  I n  e n g l a n d Negligence law (in common with, inter alia, the law of defamation and pri- vate nuisance) is a component of tort law. Tort (along with contract law and  the law of restitution) is a body of private law in which the question as to  whether one party (the defendant) has wrongfully inflicted harm on the other  (the claimant) is centrally important. Within tort law, negligence has (since  its emergence as a distinct head of liability in the early nineteenth century)  assumed a place of prominence.6 Negligence law is a form of fault-based li- ability. This means that the claimant must (when seeking compensation) es- tablish that the defendant has not merely harmed her but has also perpetrated  a wrong while doing so.7 Establishing that the defendant was under a duty of care is the first require- ment that claimants must satisfy in order to advance a claim successfully. To  322 LAL2103_03.indd   322 10/19/09   3:16:36 PM </page> <page sequence="3"> Mul lender  •  Engl ish Negl igence Law as a  Human Pract ice  this end, they must prove that the harm they suffered was reasonably foresee- able and that they stood in a close (or proximate) relationship with the defen- dant. Where a claimant meets these requirements, judges turn to the question  as to whether the defendant failed to discharge the duty he or she was under.  When determining this (breach of duty) question, judges apply a reasonable  person standard (RPS). Judges assess the defendant’s conduct by reference  to the standard of an imagined reasonable person.8 Where the defendant has  failed to act as a reasonable person would have acted in the circumstances, the  breach requirement is satisfied. Thereafter, judges consider whether the de- fendant caused the harm suffered by the claimant. They also address the ques- tion as to whether the relevant harm is substantial and whether it is reasonably  foreseeable or too “remote” to warrant the imposition of liability.9 Where claimants have met these requirements, judges have grounds for  imposing liability and requiring the defendant to pay full compensation.10  However, two further features of negligence law may provide a defendant  with means to escape the imposition of liability. He may be able successfully  to plead one of a number of defenses (e.g., consent on the claimant’s part  to run the relevant risks).11 Likewise, the defendant may be able to adduce  policy-based (e.g., public interest–oriented) considerations as grounds for  rejecting an otherwise sound claim.12 Among these considerations we may  number the possibility that those in particular professions (e.g., doctors) may  act defensively if placed under a duty of care.13 While the features of negligence law we have examined were discernible in  the nineteenth century, it was in the twentieth century that this cause of action  began to assume that place of prominence it now enjoys in tort.14 Negligence  law’s rise to prominence began in the 1930s when Lord Atkin, a member of the  House of Lords, sought to fashion a generally applicable test for determining  when duties could arise.15 The upshot of his efforts has been a controversy that  continues to this day. In the half century from the 1930s to the 1980s, judges  expanded the range of circumstances in which addressees of negligence law  bore duties to others.16 Thereafter, they sought to stake out a more restrictive  position.17 But, while doing so, they followed their expansion-minded pre- decessors and identified negligence law as amenable to incremental develop- ment.18 As we will see, the process of incremental development provides an  example of practical judgment in the sense specified by John Dewey, a phi- losopher on whom Paul Rabinow draws when analyzing SynBERC’s Human  Practices thrust.19 According to Dewey, the “logic” of practical judgment is  323 LAL2103_03.indd   323 10/19/09   3:16:36 PM </page> <page sequence="4"> Law &amp; L i tera ture  •  Vo lume 21,  Number  3 not a question of performing a mathematical operation. Rather, it involves  undertaking a directed operation in a given situation.20 If we take the locution  “directed operation” to mean a process that is both ordered and an opportu- nity for the exercise of judgment, then incrementalism provides (as will soon  become apparent) a very obvious example. I I I .  I n c r e m e n ta l I s m Judges and commentators on negligence law regularly invoke the idea of “in- crementalism” or “incremental development.”21 This is unsurprising. For we  find in the history of the common law (of which the tort of negligence is a  part) a romantic attachment to the idea that the incremental elaboration of  existing doctrine is a prominent feature of the judiciary’s work.22 But rarely  do we find judges or commentators explaining in any detail what they mean  by “incrementalism.”23 Typically, they employ the term in ways that suggest  that its meaning is clear or associate it with, inter alia, a process that involves  “modest” or “small” extensions of existing doctrine on a case-by-case basis.24  However, when we examine relevant case law, we find that the practice in  which judges have engaged exhibits stable features or regularities and is ame- nable to systematization. For reasons given below, we can find in this practice  grounds for thinking that an abstract schema guides judges when they elabo- rate existing negligence law. Moreover, we might see this schema as providing  an example of the sort of “logic” (or “directed operation”) to which Dewey  refers in his account of practical judgment. a. towards an abstract schema As used by English judges when responding to negligence claims, “incremen- talism” refers to an adjudicative process that yields liability rules that are new  and yet rooted in existing law.25 This prompts the question “What connects new  liability rules to the existing doctrine?” Part of the answer has to do with negli- gence law’s protective purpose. Judges only spring to the aid of those claimants  who can establish that they have suffered harm to a significant interest. In most  cases, this is an interest in physical security.26 But negligence law also protects  interests in mental and financial security.27 Moreover, we might associate pur- suit of negligence law’s protective purpose with a commitment to the ideal of  324 LAL2103_03.indd   324 10/19/09   3:16:37 PM </page> <page sequence="5"> Mul lender  •  Engl ish Negl igence Law as a  Human Pract ice  personal autonomy. For judges seek to establish conditions in which negligence  law’s addressees enjoy sufficient security to be able to pursue their chosen proj- ects and, in other ways, author (in substantial part) their own lives.28 The range of circumstances in which negligence law protects significant  interests is sharply circumscribed. In order to recover compensation, a claim- ant must establish that he has suffered harm in the context of a wrongful  transaction. This is a form of proximate interaction during which the defen- dant wrongs the claimant by inflicting reasonably foreseeable harm on him.  The centrality, in negligence law, of the question as to whether a wrongful  transaction has unfolded is driven home by Ernest Weinrib. He identifies the  doctrines central to negligence law (duty of care, breach of duty, causation of  harm, and remoteness) as enabling judges to pick out sets of circumstances in  which wrongful transactions have occurred.29 Claimants who establish that they have suffered harm to a significant inter- est in a wrongful transaction can appeal to a principle and an ideal of justice  that resonate powerfully in negligence law. The relevant principle specifies  that judges should treat like cases alike, while the ideal is corrective justice (ac- cording to which those who have wrongfully inflicted harm on others should  make them whole).30 But even where claimants are able to invoke these (higher  order) norms, it does not follow that their claims will necessarily succeed. At  this stage, they have made a prima facie case for compensation.31 This is be- cause judges usually make an assessment of the anticipated impact of a deci- sion in favor of the claimant. Their aim in doing so is to determine whether  the expected costs of a new liability rule will be unacceptably high. Typically,  judges describe this aspect of their work as involving the “balancing” of two  competing sets of considerations. This is an exercise that involves judges in  weighing (or, at least, appearing to weigh) (i) the sources of expected posi- tive value that will be served by or arise from a finding of liability and (ii) the  anticipated negative effects of such a decision. The three features of the practice we have been examining (determining  whether a significant interest has been harmed, deciding whether a wrongful  transaction has occurred, and balancing arguments that weigh in favor of and  tell against the imposition of liability) provide a basis on which to set out an  abstract schema of incremental method: A judge has grounds for awarding compensation to a claimant mounting a novel  negligence claim if the claimant can establish (i) that he or she has suffered  325 LAL2103_03.indd   325 10/19/09   3:16:37 PM </page> <page sequence="6"> Law &amp; L i tera ture  •  Vo lume 21,  Number  3 harm to a significant interest and (ii) that this harm occurred in the context of a  wrongful transaction with the defendant and (iii) if the judge is satisfied that an  assessment of the costs and benefits of imposing liability weighs in favour of a  decision against the defendant [see Appendix 1]. We might see the three components of this schema as providing an ex- ample of the type of “logic” to which Rabinow (drawing on Dewey) refers.  When presented with a claim that does not fall under an existing liability rule,  a judge can assess its plausibility by reflecting on each of the three consid- erations that give the schema its content.32 Just as we can draw out of the  practice of incrementalism a logic of practical judgment, so too we can find in  the schema’s components an “equipmental platform.” In the sense specified  by Rabinow, such a “platform” is “characterised by . . . generality.”33 This  means that it is “applicable to a range of analogous problems.”34 Moreover, its  generality means that those employing it can use it in a variety of ways.35 This  point has relevance to the area of law we are scrutinizing. For we find two  variants of incrementalism, each of which contains the components outlined  in our schematic account. Examination of these variants is worthwhile since it  throws light on the objectives at stake in the practice we are examining. Like- wise, it conveys a sense of the controversy that surrounds the question as to  how judges should elaborate negligence law. B. narrow and wide Incrementalism The narrow approach to the incremental development of negligence law  finds expression in a decision of the Australian High Court (which won the  approval of Lord Bridge and his colleagues in England’s highest court, the  House of Lords). In Sutherland Shire Council v. Heyman, Brennan J. stated  that “[i]t is preferable . . . that the law should develop novel categories of neg- ligence incrementally and by analogy with established categories of case.”36  This approach exhibits a high degree of doctrine-boundness.37 Judges take an  “intense view of the particular” and ask themselves whether the facts of the  case before them bear obvious similarities to cases in which their predeces- sors have specified or expanded the scope of liability.38 This doctrine-bound  approach to adjudication reduces receptivity to strongly novel claims by en- couraging judges “to confine the law to rigid . . . categories.”39 However, the  narrow approach does not preclude novel actions. The judgment of Lord  326 LAL2103_03.indd   326 10/19/09   3:16:38 PM </page> <page sequence="7"> Mul lender  •  Engl ish Negl igence Law as a  Human Pract ice  Justice Phillips in Reeman v. Department of Transport supports this claim. Lord  Justice Phillips tells us that, when confronted with such an action, judges seek  guidance from “established categories of negligence” in order to “see whether  the facts amount to no more than a small extension of a situation already cov- ered by authority, or whether a finding of the existence of a duty of care would  effect a significant extension of the law.”40 However, he adds that, “in excep- tional [i.e., highly novel] cases,” judges “will . . . accept that the interests of  justice justify such an extension in the law.”41 By contrast with narrow incrementalism, the pursuit of justice proceeds  on a broader front for those judges who engage in wide incremental develop- ment of negligence law. This was made plain by Lord Wilberforce in Anns v.  Merton LBC.42 Having surveyed the doctrinal developments of the previous  half century, Lord Wilberforce concluded that “the position has now been  reached that in order to establish that a duty of care arises in a particular situ- ation, it is not necessary to bring the facts of that situation within those of  previous situations in which a duty of care has been held to exist.”43 Having  made this declaration, he set out a two-stage duty of care test. The first stage  of this test specified that claimants had to establish “a sufficient relationship of  proximity or neighbourhood” in order to show that the defendant owed them  a duty.44 Where judges answered this question affirmatively, they had to con- sider (when turning to the second stage of the test) whether there were any  “considerations” that might militate against the imposition of a duty.45 This  element of the test is an invitation to judges to consider whether policy-related  considerations provide grounds for rejecting an otherwise good claim. Thus  the second component of the two-stage test embraces matters of broad public  concern (e.g., the question as to whether a finding for the claimant will inspire  an unmanageable flood of similar claims).46 Lord Wilberforce’s approach to duty of care questions has been the object  of sharp criticism.47 Judges have argued that the two-stage test encouraged an  unacceptably wide range of claims.48 Likewise, they have expressed unease  concerning Lord Wilberforce’s acknowledgement (in stage two of his test)  that judges must grapple with large questions of policy.49 Misgivings of this  sort ultimately led the House of Lords to abandon Lord Wilberforce’s ap- proach to duty of care questions.50 However, judges continue to employ the  wide approach to the incremental development of negligence law. Consider,  for example, Watson v. British Boxing Board of Control.51 In Watson, a profes- sional boxer suffered permanent mental injury. This was because he received  327 LAL2103_03.indd   327 10/19/09   3:16:38 PM </page> <page sequence="8"> Law &amp; L i tera ture  •  Vo lume 21,  Number  3 inadequate medical and surgical treatment subsequent to injury suffered dur- ing a boxing bout. When faced with an action brought by the claimant against  the sport’s regulatory body, the Master of the Rolls, Lord Phillips, stated that  “there is no category in which a duty has been established from which one can  advance to this case by a small incremental step.”52 He thus recognized that  this case was highly novel. Nonetheless he imposed liability on the defendant,  having concluded that the parties’ relationship exhibited a sufficient degree of  proximity or neighborhood and that there were no policy-based arguments  that provided grounds for rejecting the claim.53 Decisions such as Watson provide a basis on which to point up a virtue of the  wide approach to incremental development. Judges who go about their business  in this way are likelier to act in conformity with the principle that “the catego- ries of negligence are never closed.”54 To act in conformity with this principle  will necessarily be harder for judges who adopt a more doctrine-bound, narrow  incremental approach. However, the narrow approach possesses a virtue that  the wide variant threatens to compromise: it promotes certainty by limiting the  range of circumstances in which judges can develop negligence law. Here we  find an acute source of tension in this branch of tort between two values that,  on one analysis, are internal to the concept of law.55 We might explain the an- tagonistic relationship between these values by reference to the notion of “com- petitive pluralism” (as elaborated by Joseph Raz) (see Appendix 2). On Raz’s  account, competitive pluralism may manifest itself in circumstances where two  eligible reasons for action provide incompatible grounds on which to respond to  the same practical problem.56 Moreover, clashes of the sort contemplated by Raz  may be occasions on which those appealing to one or other of the relevant rea- sons for action exhibit intolerance towards those who take the contrary view.57  Just such intolerance was, for example, exhibited by the House of Lords when  it retreated from and ultimately disapproved Lord Wilberforce’s approach to  duty of care and argued for more limited receptivity to novel claims.58 As will become apparent in the section below, the moral impulses that in- form negligence law also give rise to competitive pluralism. V.  m o r a l  P h I lo s o P h y The abstract schema described in the last section provides a basis on which to  pin down the moral impulses that figure most prominently in negligence law.  328 LAL2103_03.indd   328 10/19/09   3:16:38 PM </page> <page sequence="9"> Mul lender  •  Engl ish Negl igence Law as a  Human Pract ice  The first two considerations embraced by the schema (harm to a significant  interest and a wrongful transaction) focus narrowly on the relationship be- tween the parties to a claim for compensation. Where claimants can show that  they have suffered harm to a significant interest in the course of a wrongful  transaction with the defendant, they can appeal to the ideal of corrective jus- tice. Where claimants make such an appeal, judges typically assume (at least,  presumptively) that this ideal requires the defendant to pay compensation.  This assumption brings into view the first of the two types of moral impulse  with which we are concerned. These impulses are deontological. They give  expression to the assumption that certain interests and states of affairs are in- trinsically valuable. Likewise, they give expression to the view that certain  modes of behavior are the intrinsically right thing to do.59 We encounter these  impulses when we find judges assuming that defendants should compensate  those upon whom they have wrongfully inflicted harm. But while we find deontological impulses in negligence law, they do not  take the unqualified form that finds expression in, for example, Kantian moral  philosophy. On Kant’s view, we should always do those things that are intrin- sically valuable regardless of the costs: e.g., we should always tell others the  truth even if the costs of doing so are high.60 This is not, however, the view  of judges when responding to negligence claims. Where the anticipated costs  of a decision in favor of the claimant are high, judges typically regard them as  providing grounds for rejecting an otherwise good claim. Here, we find not  deontological but, rather, consequentialist moral impulses at work in negli- gence law. When judges treat the cost-benefit analyses in which they engage  as grounds for their decisions, they give expression to the assumption that the  value of an action derives from the value of its consequences.61 Given the presence in negligence law of both deontological and conse- quentialist moral impulses, the question arises as to how we should under- stand their relationship. We might see them as giving expression to a qualified  deontological moral philosophy. This name seems apt when we recognize  that duty of care–related doctrine and the abstract schema described earlier  give sequential priority to the question as to whether judges should vindicate  the ideal of corrective justice.62 Likewise, it seems apt when we recognize that  consequentialist considerations qualify judicial commitment to corrective jus- tice (and the deontological assumptions to which this ideal gives expression).  These considerations are, as we have noted, the anticipated costs of a decision  in favor of a claimant whose action is, in other respects, sound. 329 LAL2103_03.indd   329 10/19/09   3:16:38 PM </page> <page sequence="10"> Law &amp; L i tera ture  •  Vo lume 21,  Number  3 The presence in negligence law of deontological and consequentialist  impulses might lead some to draw a much less charitable conclusion. They  might see negligence law as “the witness and external deposit” of a culture  in a state of “grave disorder” due to the absence of a clear sense of moral di- rection.63 There might be something in this if we view deontology and conse- quentialism as mutually antagonistic.64 However, we might (more charitably)  see these two types of moral impulse as providing judges with grounds on  which to accommodate the interests of all those in the community regulated  by negligence law. Claimants have an opportunity to work up an argument for  compensation that draws much of its normative force from the ideal of cor- rective justice and the deontological assumptions that inform it. Defendants  may seek to resist such arguments by denying that the claimant has suffered  injury to a significant interest and/or that she has suffered harm in the context  of a wrongful transaction. Where defendants advance counterarguments of  this sort, they respond to an appeal to deontology in terms that are themselves  informed by deontological moral impulses. For they advance the claim that,  as a matter of fact, their relationship with the claimant does not yield grounds  on which to appeal to corrective justice. Alongside deontological counterarguments of this sort, we often find  consequentialist ones. For defendants regularly identify the liability rule  argued for by a claimant as a threat to the public interest or, at least, to the  interests of a broad aggregate of people.65 This happens when, for example,  a defendant argues that a decision in favor of the claimant will foster a de- fensive frame of mind in those delivering a service for the benefit of the  public (e.g., policing).66 In responding positively to some arguments of this  sort, judges make it plain that they seek to accommodate the interests not  just of litigants but of all those affected by negligence law’s operations. This  feature of negligence law provides a basis on which to suggest that judges  are committed to the pursuit of distributive justice. This ideal specifies that  the interests of all those served by a social institution should be defensibly  accommodated.67 But while this commitment may inform negligence law, there are reasons  for thinking that judges have not developed the practice in which they par- ticipate in ways that take sufficient account of all relevant interests. This is  because they have exhibited a readiness to accept public interest–oriented  arguments against the imposition of liability that may be less powerful than  those that lend support to the claim. In order to explain why this happens, we  330 LAL2103_03.indd   330 10/19/09   3:16:39 PM </page> <page sequence="11"> Mul lender  •  Engl ish Negl igence Law as a  Human Pract ice  must look more closely at the public interest arguments regularly identified  by defendants as providing a basis on which to reject otherwise sound claims.  In a wide range of circumstances, defendants might support these arguments  by reference to relevant empirical material. For example, they might refer to  experience in the same or other fields that supports the claim that the specifica- tion of a liability rule will (other things being equal) lead to a flood of claims.  This, however, rarely happens.68 This means that (in circumstances of the sort  we are contemplating) judges reject an otherwise sound claim in favor of an  in terrorem argument. For those who advance such arguments gesture in the  direction of an anticipated state of affairs. But they do not lead evidence that  identifies the relevant state of affairs as a live possibility.69 In such circum- stances, we have grounds for thinking that judges do not take the interests  of claimants suitably seriously. This is because they reject a reason for ac- tion that has relevant support (an appeal to corrective justice supported by  reference to a wrongful transaction) in favor of one that does not (a publicly  oriented countervailing argument). Where this happens, it is hard to see how  we might identify judges as properly attentive to the interests of claimants.  This is because they do not base their decisions on an undefeated reason for  action: vindicating corrective justice (where claimants have satisfied the rel- evant factual and doctrinal tests). Rather, they respond to speculation on the  part of defendants. But even if defendants were to adduce the sort of evidence typically lacking  when they make appeal to matters of public concern, a further problem would  remain. This problem arises in circumstances where claimants advance ar- guments informed by deontological impulses while defendants respond with  arguments that are consequentialist in character. When we contemplate the  question as to how judges should rank such arguments relative to one another,  we find that the law reports do not yield clear answers. These reports state,  for example, that judges should think “very carefully” about the clash we are  considering and accept only “very potent considerations of public policy” as  grounds on which to reject otherwise good claims.70 However, judges have  not explained in detail how to determine whether a consequentialist argument  exhibits sufficient potency to defeat an otherwise sound claim. This failure  to specify the law’s requirements in clear terms is not, however, the result of  judicial indolence. For judges have addressed on many occasions the question  as to how they should deal with the clash we are examining. The fact that they  have revisited this issue so often suggests that it is something of a sore point  331 LAL2103_03.indd   331 10/19/09   3:16:39 PM </page> <page sequence="12"> Law &amp; L i tera ture  •  Vo lume 21,  Number  3 in the judicial mind. This may be because the two types of argument we are  considering are incommensurable: i.e., not amenable to ranking on a com- mon scale.71 Assuming that this is the case, we might draw the conclusion that  judges have sought to deal by procedural means with the problem confronting  them. For they have fashioned a body of doctrine that (while giving sequen- tial priority to corrective justice) provides a framework within which they  may hear both deontological and consequentialist arguments before making  an all-things-considered judgment. Judges cannot (if incommensurability is  a problem that afflicts negligence law) identify their decisions as optimal. But  they can, at least, justify them by reference to considerations (either deon- tological or consequentialist) that have long featured in this branch of tort  (see Appendix 3). Moreover, these considerations have (for the reasons given  earlier) to do with fashioning a body of law that is supposed to accommo- date the interests of all its addressees adequately. However, the pursuit of an  adequate accommodation of interests is (if the two types of moral impulse  in play are incommensurable) an undertaking that gives rise to irresolvable  controversy. While each type of impulse yields eligible reasons for action, we  cannot rank them. As a result, the problem of competitive pluralism (in Raz’s  sense) arises.72 Each of the features of negligence law we have thus far examined (incre- mentalism and the law’s informing moral impulses) throws light on judicial  behavior in the practice we have been scrutinizing. We now turn to consid- erations that have to do, to a significant extent, with the conduct of the law’s  addressees. Moreover, these considerations bring us—for reasons given  below—to the topic of capacity-building (which, as we noted in the introduc- tion, is relevant to the Human Practices thrust of the SynBERC project). V I .  c o m m u n I t y The work of a legal philosopher, H. L. A. Hart, provides a basis on which  to explain how negligence law is an expression of and works to foster com- munity. Hart notes that the situations where the addressees of the law may  have to exercise reasonable care are “hugely various” and that existing law  is, consequently, a limited source of guidance.73 This means that individuals  must—as Hart recognizes—think through and act on the reasonably ascer- tainable implications of existing law in circumstances not spoken to in clear  332 LAL2103_03.indd   332 10/19/09   3:16:39 PM </page> <page sequence="13"> Mul lender  •  Engl ish Negl igence Law as a  Human Pract ice  terms by negligence doctrine.74 Hart explains by reference to negligence law’s  informing purposes what this involves: What we are striving for in the application of standards of reasonable care is to  ensure (1) that precautions will be taken which will avert substantial harm, yet  (2) that the precautions are such that the burden of proper precautions does not  involve too great a sacrifice of other respectable interests.75 Hart examines in detail the practical attitude of those who act in the way  he describes. They typically take up what he calls the law’s “internal point of  view.” From this standpoint, they regard themselves as being under an obli- gation to act in conformity with the law’s informing purposes. On Hart’s ac- count, this involves adopting a “critical reflective attitude” when confronted  with novel sets of circumstances to which the law may have application.76  How, we might wonder, does this attitude manifest itself in the thought pro- cesses of one of negligence law’s addressees? Hart goes some way towards  answering this question in his analysis of “the application of standards of rea- sonable care.”77 On his account, individuals have to address the question as  to whether they should relinquish some freedom of action by acting in ways  that make others reasonably secure. While this obligation only gives rise to a  duty of care in a limited range of circumstances, it is open-ended. Negligence  law’s addressees, when interacting with others, have to address the question  as to whether they may closely and directly affect them in adverse ways.78 To  the extent that they think and (where necessary) act along the lines suggested  here, we have grounds for describing them as participating in a cooperative  scheme.79 The outlook described by Hart and the conduct it prompts provide a basis  on which to argue that negligence law expresses a commitment to and serves  to sustain a community composed of its addressees. This point is far from  novel. The classical common law theorists of the seventeenth and eighteenth  centuries drove home the point that the common law (of which negligence  had by the nineteenth century become a component) gives expression to the  life of a community.80 Contemporary judges in England and other common  law jurisdictions make the same point.81 Moreover, we find in some contempo- rary judgments the outlines of a distinction that also appears to have informed  classical common law theory. For they distinguish between “ordinary notions  of what is fit and proper” (where their focus is on empirical community) and  333 LAL2103_03.indd   333 10/19/09   3:16:40 PM </page> <page sequence="14"> Law &amp; L i tera ture  •  Vo lume 21,  Number  3 “fair and reasonable” terms of social cooperation (where the focus shifts to  ethical community).82 In embracing these two notions of community, con- temporary judges (like their predecessors) indicate that their willingness to  weave contemporary social mores into the fabric of the law is qualified. This  is because ethical community is a higher-order ideal that places limitations on  the circumstances in which judges can justify the creation or modification of  legal doctrine by reference to “ordinary notions.”83 Where these notions give  rise to injustice, ethical community enjoins judges to reject them and specify  alternative norms that adequately accommodate the interests of all the law’s  addressees.84 But just as ethical community may prompt judges to reflect on  the acceptability of current modes of behavior, so too “altering social . . . stan- dards” can lead them to rework the idea of “legal responsibility.”85 These are  features of negligence law that we can theorize in a variety of ways. We might  identify them as an expression of commitment to the pursuit of distributive  justice. But this is far from being the whole story. For when we ask why dis- tributive justice plays this role in negligence law, the answer surely has to do  with a commitment to mutual flourishing. Judges seek to fashion a framework  within which all relevant persons enjoy a significant measure of security and  freedom of action (each of which is a necessary but not sufficient condition of  an autonomous life).86 We can find support for the claim that a commitment to community informs  negligence law when we look at twentieth century case law on duty of care.  When setting out his famous “statement[ ] of general application defining the  relations between the parties that give rise to [a] duty,” Lord Atkin presented  us with the neighbor principle.87 Moreover, he framed this touchstone of li- ability in terms that capture the practical outlook of one who participates in  the cooperative scheme described earlier. Lord Atkin did this by posing the  question: “[w]ho then, in law, is my neighbour? The answer seems to be per- sons who are so closely and directly affected by my act that I ought reasonably  to have them in contemplation as being so affected when I am directing my  mind to the acts or omissions which are called in question.”88 These words merit close scrutiny for three reasons. First, the term “neigh- bor” suggests some measure of other-regard on the part of the law’s address- ees. Secondly, Lord Atkin’s decision to project himself into the position of  one who seeks to meet the law’s requirements reveals his sensitivity to the role  played by negligence law’s addressees in its operations. Thirdly, the neighbor  principle has to do with much more than reducing a large body of case law to  334 LAL2103_03.indd   334 10/19/09   3:16:40 PM </page> <page sequence="15"> Mul lender  •  Engl ish Negl igence Law as a  Human Pract ice  a “general conception” or simple formula.89 We might use Richard Dawk- ins’s notion of a “meme” to capture Lord Atkin’s larger purpose. Dawkins  describes a “meme” as “a unit of cultural transmission.” By this, he means a  “replicator” (analogous to a gene) that will, if successful, (re)shape the envi- ronment into which it is introduced.90 Lord Atkin appears to have intended  his duty of care test to have this sort of effect. His grandson recalls that, be- fore judgment in Donoghue, Lord Atkin would (when discussing the case over  the lunch table) present his immediate family with “an easily understandable  theme.” This took the form of the question “Who is my neighbour?”91 This  suggests that Lord Atkin was seeking to find a simple form of words that  would have the sort of (society-wide) impact suggested earlier.92 We might also ascribe to Lord Atkin a modestly perfectionist agenda that  finds expression in Christianity’s “golden maxim”: “Do unto your neighbor  as you would that he should do unto you.”93 For he suggested (when writing  extrajudicially in 1932) that “the whole of the law of tort” might be “com- prised” in this maxim.94 His aim certainly seems to have been to foster in neg- ligence law’s addressees a form of other-regard that would inform their think- ing in circumstances not regulated by existing doctrine.95 On the assumption  that the neighbor principle contains this perfectionist strand, we might press  the analysis of it further by drawing on Alasdair MacIntyre’s communitarian  political philosophy. MacIntyre tells us that “characters . . . are the moral rep- resentatives of their culture.”96 If we assume that the addressee of negligence  law who features in the neighbor principle is a character, the question arises  as to what he or she represents. We can find part of the answer in Donoghue  v. Stevenson. Prior to setting out his approach to duty of care, Lord Atkin  states that “liability for negligence . . . is no doubt based upon a general public  sentiment of moral wrongdoing.”97 Thus the character he introduces is repre- sentative of the form of life (empirical community) in which she must make  practical decisions. In this respect, Lord Atkin rehearses a theme prominent in  classical common law theory.98 But, while being a bearer of actually-existing  culture (or “the way we do things around here”), Lord Atkin’s neighbor is not  content uncritically to embrace “common feelings.”99 Rather, she reflects on  practical questions in a way that bespeaks commitment to pursuit of the ideal  of ethical community.100 To this end, she seeks to accommodate her freedom  of action and others’ security in ways that are distributively just.101 That we should find Lord Atkin’s neighbor wrestling with so grand- sounding a task is far from surprising. For characters, according to MacIntyre,  335 LAL2103_03.indd   335 10/19/09   3:16:40 PM </page> <page sequence="16"> Law &amp; L i tera ture  •  Vo lume 21,  Number  3 “morally legitimate[ ] a mode of social existence.”102 Likewise, they provide  “a cultural and moral ideal” and a focal point for disagreement.103 This is an  analysis to which negligence lawyers might respond by observing: “Lord At- kin’s nineteenth-century predecessors got there before him.” In support of  this claim they could point towards the arrival on the negligence scene of “the  reasonable person” (as a touchstone of liability) in the 1830s.104 Certainly, the  reasonable person caught the imagination of the judiciary. By the time Lord  Atkin enunciated the neighbor principle, the reasonable person had become  established as a decent, if rather Pooterish, figure. Thus we find Lord Justice  Greer describing him as “the man who takes the magazines at home, and in  the evening pushes the lawn-mower in his shirt sleeves.”105 In fastening, as  he does, on the quotidian details of the reasonable person’s life, Lord Justice  Greer conjures up a picture of one whose horizons are narrow. But it is far  from obvious that this is equally true of Lord Atkin’s neighbor whose very  name suggests an amiability that may be less apparent in the reasonable per- son.106 If this is broadly correct, we might regard the reasonable person as  committed to the pursuit of justice (conceived as a “jealous virtue”) while the  neighbor seeks to play a more vigorous part in sustaining the practical life of  a community.107 Of these two characters, the latter seems more likely to be a  proponent of mutual flourishing (and, for this reason, of greater interest to  those participating in the Human Practices thrust of the SynBERC project). While these are not matters on which senior judges have dwelt in the de- cades since Lord Atkin rendered his speech in Donoghue, they have sought to  build on the foundations he laid. In Anns v. Merton LBC, we find Lord Wil- berforce addressing the question as to whether “a sufficient relationship of  proximity or neighbourhood” exists between the parties to a claim.108 Matters  are little different in the later case of Caparo Industries plc v. Dickman. Lord  Bridge considers whether the defendant failed to counter the threat of reason- ably foreseeable harm to the claimant while standing in a proximate relation- ship with him or her.109 In a further respect, however, each of these Law Lords  stakes out a position that is significantly different from that taken up by Lord  Atkin. They consider whether policy considerations provide grounds for re- jecting otherwise sound claims. While the contours of their respective tests  reflect the deontological and consequentialist impulses at work in negligence  law, we might regard Lord Atkin’s neighbor principle as more attractive than  either of them in one respect. Lord Atkin, unlike Lord Wilberforce and Lord  Bridge, employs a form of words (“who then, in law, is my neighbour?”) that  336 LAL2103_03.indd   336 10/19/09   3:16:40 PM </page> <page sequence="17"> Mul lender  •  Engl ish Negl igence Law as a  Human Pract ice  views the law from the standpoint of one of its addressees. When presented  with this point of distinction, a critic might ask “Does it really matter?” The  answer to this question surely has to be “yes.” Lord Atkin exhibits a greater  concern than either Lord Wilberforce or Lord Bridge with building capacity  among the law’s addressees. This is because he (unlike his successors) seeks to  model the type of reasoning process in which a potential duty-bearer should  engage. While open to criticism on this ground, Lords Wilberforce and Bridge do  (as we have noted) follow Lord Atkin’s lead by enunciating a general duty  of care test. Thus, we might see their respective contributions as attempts to  modify or refine the meme that Lord Atkin (on the above analysis) introduced  into the community regulated by negligence law. Moreover, the tests specified  by Lords Wilberforce and Bridge contrast sharply with the approach to duty  of care now employed in another common law jurisdiction, Australia. In Sul- livan v. Moody, the Australian High Court (AHC) abandoned Lord Bridge’s  three-stage test and announced that it would, henceforth, determine duty  questions by reference to an unspecified list of “salient features.”110 This is  not an approach that promotes understanding of negligence law’s operations  among its addressees.111 Hence, we have grounds for thinking that the AHC’s  position threatens to reduce among those to whom the law applies the capac- ity for participation in the cooperative scheme we are examining. While the English and Australian approaches to duty of care have in re- cent years diverged, judges in both countries have expressed broadly similar  misgivings concerning the emergence of a so-called blame culture. This is a  state of affairs in which a significant number of claimants seek to advance un- meritorious compensation claims.112 To the extent that this problem exists, it  marks a retreat from community. For claimants who engage in the sort of be- havior associated with blame culture are ready to privilege their own interests  relative to those of defendants. This is because those seeking compensation  cannot make appeal, in plausible terms, to corrective justice. Thus, in circum- stances where they succeed in recovering compensation, they act in ways that  undermine the integrity of this ideal, the practice underwritten by it, and the  community it serves. Assuming that blame culture is a problem, the “character” who features in  Lord Atkin’s duty of care test enables us to gain analytic purchase on it. The  problem of blame culture arises where individuals (claimants advancing un- meritorious actions) cease to see those around them as having interests equal  337 LAL2103_03.indd   337 10/19/09   3:16:41 PM </page> <page sequence="18"> Law &amp; L i tera ture  •  Vo lume 21,  Number  3 in significance to their own. If few individuals engage in the sort of behavior  we are considering, we may comment critically on their readiness to privilege  their own interests and leave the matter there. But where there are enough  unmeritorious claims to make talk of blame culture plausible, a gap opens up  between actually-existing or empirical community and the ethical ideal that  finds expression in the neighbor principle. The upshot may be a mounting  sense of social disintegration. While commentators on blame culture have not  spoken in these terms they have identified an increasing number of negligence  law’s addressees as ready to mount claims that lack merit.113 This suggests  an increasing readiness on the part of negligence law’s addressees to privi- lege their own interests. Moreover, we find when we turn to commentators  on contemporary England, a picture that lends some support to the analysis  suggested here. For example, A. A. Gill (in a particularly vehement outburst)  describes the English as “opportunistic, demanding, . . . lying scum.”114 This  is too sweeping. But we should perhaps recognize that, since the cultural  changes of the 1960s, “character” as an intersubjective standard has given  way to “personality” (a reference point for individuals).115 Here we may find  a basis on which to explain a (possibly increasing) readiness on the part of  individuals to privilege their own interests. If this analysis is broadly correct, it suggests that the practice we have been  examining can only work effectively if a sufficient number of those who partici- pate in it possess an other-regarding (or cooperative) practical outlook. While  this point has obvious significance for those who find themselves defending  unmeritorious claims, it also has relevance to all members of the community  served by negligence law. Hart’s analysis of this branch of tort provides a basis  on which to explain why this is the case. Hart recognizes that existing doctrine  does not provide exhaustive guidance on the circumstances in which threats  to the security of the law’s addressees may arise. Moreover, he identifies neg- ligence litigation as a context in which judges can specify new liability rules  that address sources of danger that have hitherto been “unanticipatable.”116  Hart also states that the requirements of “reasonableness” established by neg- ligence law become apparent when “put in conjunction with . . . possibilities  which only experience . . . bring[s] before us.”117 In light of these points Hart appears to regard negligence law as a discov- ery-procedure. This discovery-procedure affords a means by which to gather  information concerning previously unrecognized sources of significant risk.118  Likewise, negligence proceedings provide a context in which judges can  338 LAL2103_03.indd   338 10/19/09   3:16:41 PM </page> <page sequence="19"> Mul lender  •  Engl ish Negl igence Law as a  Human Pract ice  regulate these risks. In light of these points, those who advance unmeritorious  claims act in ways that compromise negligence law as a discovery-procedure.  For the claims they advance do not (or, at least, are unlikely to) make avail- able to judges information concerning significant sources of risk. Moreover,  behavior of the sort we are contemplating seems likely to shrink that radius of  trust in the sphere of negligence law.119 Where this happens, judges will, other  things being equal, be less willing to respond positively to claims that concern  genuine sources of danger.120 V I I .  c o n c l u s I o n The society-wide scope and richness of the branch of tort law we have been  examining make it a highly appropriate object of scrutiny for those, such as  Paul Rabinow, researching the field of human practices. But for Rabinow per- haps the most striking feature of negligence law is the assumption that not just  judges and lawyers but also the public should actively participate in its opera- tions. Individuals do this when they think through and act on the reasonably  ascertainable implications of existing doctrine. With the notable exception of  Hart, few commentators have devoted attention to this topic. But the classical  common lawyers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries did, at least, pur- sue the theme that the assemblage of norms and practices on which they dwelt  was not the exclusive preserve of legal technicians. Rather, they described the  common law as Lex Communis Angliae.121 However, while judges continue to  invoke “community” when responding to negligence claims, they have less to  say about the content of this concept than their seventeenth- and eighteenth- century predecessors. This reticence may be because “community” has come  to be associated with a strong social consensus that is at odds with the liberal  assumptions that for many are a “given” of practical life in contexts such as  Britain.122 Moreover, some commentators on negligence law identify commu- nities as forms of life within which there lurk retrograde moral impulses that  impede the pursuit of justice.123 The practice we have examined merits the description “rich” for a variety  of reasons. Prominent among them is a large body of doctrine that regulates a  wide range of social activities. This is the feature of this branch of tort to which  the label “law” is (for perfectly understandable reasons) usually applied. But,  as we have seen, there is much more to negligence law than doctrine. A range  339 LAL2103_03.indd   339 10/19/09   3:16:41 PM </page> <page sequence="20"> Law &amp; L i tera ture  •  Vo lume 21,  Number  3 of principles also feature in this area of the law: most obviously, the principle  of personal responsibility. So too do the ideals corrective justice, distributive  justice, and ethical community. And these higher-order norms (principles and  ideals) have relevance to the decisions made by individuals who are under  an obligation to strike a balance between their own interests and those of the  people with whom they closely interact. But while negligence law is a rich  practice, we can reduce the incremental method by means of which judges  elaborate it to a schema. Having done this, however, we can use this schema  to gain analytic purchase on controversies that, again, reveal the practice we  are examining to be rich. Thus we find both narrow and wide variants of the  incremental method captured (in general terms) by the schema. Each of these  variants places emphasis on particular values. Wide incrementalism bespeaks  a strong commitment to the pursuit of justice in the instant case. By contrast,  narrow incrementalism works to promote certainty in the law’s operations. To this source of controversy, we must add another that adds to negligence  law’s richness. Whether judges adopt narrow or wide approaches to the elab- oration of the law, we find them wrestling with two very different types of  moral impulse: deontology and consequentialism. While moral philosophers  regularly emphasize the antagonistic relationship in which these two types  of impulse stand relative to one another, judges have integrated them into a  composite body of moral thought: qualified deontology.124 On the analysis  offered here, there is much in this body of thought that has not been thought  through very clearly: most obviously, when—and indeed whether—we have  strong grounds for concluding that deontological reasons for action should  yield to consequentialist ones. While debate on this subject seems likely to  rumble on interminably, we can draw one firm conclusion. The clash between  the deontological and consequentialist impulses that feature in negligence law  provides a clear example of competitive pluralism. For both types of impulse  provide grounds on which to justify a greater rather than a lesser portion of  the general pool of “motivated action” in this branch of tort.125 In their efforts to elaborate negligence doctrine, we find that judges have en- gaged in one practice that has not attracted comment (at least in the terms used  in this essay). When setting out general duty of care tests, they have sought  not merely to fashion doctrine but to usher into existence (or sustain) a potent  meme. This feature of judicial practice bespeaks a commitment to community.  This is because those responsible for these tests have sought to throw light on  340 LAL2103_03.indd   340 10/19/09   3:16:41 PM </page> <page sequence="21"> Mul lender  •  Engl ish Negl igence Law as a  Human Pract ice  the circumstances in which sources of danger that are, as Hart says, “unan- ticipatable” become reasons for other-regarding action. Bearing in mind that  negligence law only requires its addressees to take steps to counter reasonably  foreseeable dangers, we might reach the conclusion that this feature of the law  presents us with a paradox. For how can a danger be both “unanticipatable”  and “reasonably foreseeable”? There is, however, no paradox in circumstances  of the sort described by Hart. For some of negligence law’s addressees will (as  they move through life) encounter novel sets of circumstances within which  significant sources of danger should become apparent.126 Finally, our examination of negligence law reveals that this branch of tort  has relevance, in a range of very specific ways, to the SynBERC project. In the  practice of incrementally elaborating existing doctrine, we have found a logic  of practical judgment. Likewise, we have found in this practice (shaped as it is  by deontological and consequentialist moral impulses) an example of “equip- ment” that is oriented towards flourishing. For judges seek to fashion a body  of doctrine that bespeaks commitment to the ideal of autonomy. But beyond  these concerns, we have found that a commitment to “community” informs  English negligence law. This is no small matter at a time when we regularly  find political commentators bemoaning the disappearance (or, at least, de- cline) of community.127 Those who set out views of this sort typically appeal  to a community that promotes (or sets the scene for) human flourishing.128  Their critics respond by describing communities in which people are mar- ginalized or actively oppressed.129 We might see this as a clash between naive  utopianism and skepticism. Those on either side of this dispute have much to  learn from the common law of negligence. They will find in it support for the  conclusion that community on the model described in this essay promises a  realistic utopia. This is a context in which we should, as reasonable people,  reflect upon and seek to accommodate adequately the interests of those with  whom we interact closely.130 It is also a context in which we acknowledge that  actually-existing (or empirical) community may be an impediment to the pur- suit of justice. To the extent that we recognize the inadequacies of existing  arrangements, we demonstrate that a readiness to interrogate “the way we do  things around here” is a feature of the way we do things around here. Thus  we find in the practice we have been surveying a willingness to “prob[e] the  limits of practicable political possibility.”131 In this, we find a commitment to  the pursuit of a realistic utopia. 341 LAL2103_03.indd   341 10/19/09   3:16:42 PM </page> <page sequence="22"> Law &amp; L i tera ture  •  Vo lume 21,  Number  3 a P P e n d I x  1 .

The analysis in the text raises questions concerning the descriptive adequacy of what Brian Tama- naha has called “the mirror thesis,” according to which “law is a reflection—a ‘mirror’—of society.”  On the view offered in this essay, judges do not passively reflect actually existing patterns of behavior  in the doctrines they fashion. They reflect critically on those patterns and, in a subset of cases, re- ject them. On the mirror thesis, see Brian Z.

Donoghue, [1932] A.C. at 80. (While our focus is on the neighbor principle, the life of the judge  who enunciated it raises important questions concerning “Englishness.” James Atkin was born  in Queensland, Australia, to a Welsh mother and an Irish father. Following the death of Atkin’s  father, he and his family relocated to Wales, where he attended school before going up to Oxford.  We might see these features of Atkin’s life as lending some support to Robert Colls’s critique  of “[t]he organic metaphor that insist[s] that England could be ‘England’ and nothing else.” See  Robert Colls, Identity of England (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), 73.

Wood  (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991), §§ 34–40, 142–17.  101.  Hart brings out the point made in the text when he describes “[w]hat we are striving for in the applica- tion of standards of reasonable care.” See supra note 7 (and associated text). Moreover, we can read  Hart’s use of the word “we” as relating to a community composed of negligence law’s addressees. 102.  MacIntyre, supra note 63, at 29. 103.  Id. at 29, 31. MacIntyre’s talk of an “ideal” may sound a little off-key when set in the context of  England in the early 1930s. For ideals are associated with the impulses to remake the world. (See  Susan Neiman, Moral Clarity: A Guide for Grown-Up Idealists (London: The Bodley Head, 2009),  8.) Moreover, egalitarian ideals (e.g., justly accommodating the interests of all those in a particular  group) may give expression to or encourage utopianism. (See Thomas Nagel, Equality and Partiality  (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991), 6.) These points are relevant to the context in which Lord  350 LAL2103_03.indd   350 10/19/09   3:16:46 PM </page> <page sequence="31"> Mul lender  •  Engl ish Negl igence Law as a  Human Pract ice  Atkin enunciated the neighbor principle, since (for many in England) the Great War (1914–1918) had  undercut the “pre-war assumption that civilization was permanent and progressive.” The pessimism  inspired by the Great War was sustained in the minds of many people by the economic dislocations of  the late 1920s and the 1930s. (See Richard Overy, The Morbid Age: Britain Between the Wars (London:  Allen Lane, 2009), 36 and ch. 2.) While we can only speculate on this point, we might see the neigh- bor principle as placing quite modest obligations on the law’s addressees and thus being sensitive to  what was motivationally possible among them. (See Nagel, supra, at 6 (arguing that those who seek to  fashion just institutions should be attentive to the motivational limitations of those who participate in  their operations).) (While we cannot explore the matter at length here, these points may go some way  towards explaining why (just ten months after the House of Lords’ decision in Donoghue v Stevenson),  Franklin D. Roosevelt (in his inaugural address) invoked the “the good neighbor” as a guide to action  “[i]n the field of world policy.” (See Franklin D. Roosevelt, Great Speeches of the 20th Century: The  Only Thing We Have to Fear Is Fear Itself (London: Guardian News &amp; Media, 2007), 10).)  104.  Vaughan v. Menlove, (1837) 3 Bing.

We might see similarities between the reasonable person as described by Lord Justice Greer and Sid- ney Strube’s cartoon figure the “Little Man,” who appeared in the Daily Express between 1920 and  1947. On the analysis offered by Peter Mandler, the Little Man “reflected post-Victorian conditions”  and “a new awareness of . . . a personality that needed to be incorporated into national character, as  seen in the image of . . . the bourgeois suburbanite.” Moreover, he was “kindly” rather than “cold”  and “aloof.” Mandler also notes that Arthur Henderson (a National Labour Member of Parliament)  was an advocate of the Little Man as an “exemplar of Englishness,” while Winston Churchill feared  that he represented a depressed national mood. See Mandler, supra note 9, at 16, 181. Cf. A. P.  Herbert, Uncommon Law (London: Methuen, 193), 4 (presenting the reasonable person as a risible  figure, “stand[ing] like a monument in our Courts of Justice, vainly appealing to his fellow citizens to  order their lives after his example”). 106.

The paradigmatic example of a discovery procedure is an economic market as described by Friedrich  Hayek. Hayek identifies processes of voluntary exchange in markets as affording means by which to  gather and distribute widely dispersed knowledge. The relevant knowledge is, according to Hayek,  encoded in prices (which serve to communicate it, in a highly compressed form, to broad aggregates  of people). Since this knowledge cannot (on Hayek’s analysis) be gathered by a central authority, he  argues that markets are a practical necessity that redounds to the benefit of all those in society.

(The costs involved in seeking to identify those who  may carelessly inflict injury on us may make the endeavor impracticable. This affords a basis on  which to explain why the (non-market) discovery procedure we are considering has come into exis- tence. These costs give rise to a market failure. Thus the paradigmatic discovery procedure described  earlier is not a practical option. See Jules L. Coleman, Risks and Wrongs (Cambridge: Cambridge  University Press, 1992), 84 et seq. (on tort law as a response to market failure).)  119.

(On the evidence of section 6 of this essay, English judges clearly  reject the view (set out by Alasdair MacIntyre) that theirs is a society from which “shared moral first  principles” are absent.

Alternatively, we might find, in judicial responsiveness to both deontological and consequentialist  moral impulses, evidence of trimming. On “trimming,” see Cass R. Sunstein, “Trimming,” 122 Har- vard Law Review 1049, 103 (2009) (where trimmers are described as “borrow[ing] ideas from both  sides in intense social controversies” and as seeking to “preserve what is deepest and most sensible  in competing positions”). 12.  See Thomas Nagel, Mortal Questions (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1979), 80–81, 83  (illustrating competition of the sort mentioned in the text by reference to nonconsequentialist and  consequentialist reasons for action and recognizing that, where such competition exists, the need for  a “theory of obligation” arises and may give expression to an understanding of “reasonableness”  sensitive to the relevant “moral context”).  126.  In light of the points made in the text, we can see that the situation described in the text is very  different from that contemplated in, for example, Zeno’s paradox of the arrow. Zeno argued that  an arrow can never reach its target since, at any point on its journey, we can identify (endlessly) a  halfway point it has yet to reach. But if we are inclined to conclude that the “unanticipatable” can  never become the “reasonably foreseeable,” Hart provides a response that makes it plain that we are  not dealing with a paradox. He interposes a third element that reveals why talk of “paradox” is wide  of the mark. This (third) element is “experience.” In the light of experience, individuals who possess  352 LAL2103_03.indd   352 10/19/09   3:16:48 PM </page> <page sequence="33"> Mul lender  •  Engl ish Negl igence Law as a  Human Pract ice  the cognitive capacities of the reasonable person should be able to grasp that they are (now) in the  presence of reasonably foreseeable dangers.

To the extent that negligence law’s addressees act in the other-regarding way contemplated in the  text, we have grounds for describing the successes of this branch of tort as, so to speak, silent. They  are the spontaneous upshot of cooperative interaction. For this reason, they are likely to go unre- marked and unrecorded. However, they play a part in changing the normative climate of the commu- nity in which they take place. These points lend plausibility to the suggestion that the silent successes  we are considering are the stuff of a “secret history” in the sense elaborated (or, at least, dwelt upon)  in Don DeLillo, Underworld (London: Picador, 1997).
