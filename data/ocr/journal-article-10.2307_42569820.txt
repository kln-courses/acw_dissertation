<plain_text><page sequence="1">Vivarium XXVII, 2 (1989) Attributes of Action in Maimonides JOSEPH A. BUIJS It has become clear to you that every attribute that we predicate of Him is an attribute of action or, if the attribute is intended for the apprehension of His essence and not of His action, it signifies the negation of the privation of the attribute in question. ( Guide of the Perplexed I, 58) In The Guide of the Perplexed , Maimonides classifies predicates into those that signify (i) definitions, (ii) parts of definitions, (iii) qualities, (iv) relations, and (v) actions.1 The issue that concerns him is whether any attributes are truly predicable of God. He goes on to argue that only the last category, attributes of action, are predicable of God. The others would result in false propositions. Thus, he reinterprets any reference to traditional divine attributes as signifying either negative attributes or attributes of action. A reinterpretation in terms of negative attributes amounts to talk about God's essence. But such talk cannot say what God is; it can only say what God is not. More specifically, Maimonides contends, we may ascribe perfections to God, provided we mean to deny the corre- sponding imperfection. Thus, we can say "God is powerful" and 'God is knowing," but these ascriptions are intelligible only if we understand them to mean, respectively, "God is not weak" and "God is not ignorant." A reinterpretation in terms of attributes of action, on the other hand, does not refer to the divine essence at all. Instead, it amounts to talk about the effects of divine agency in the world. Thus we can say "God is just" provided we mean by this that God pro- duced a just event or state of affairs; similarly to say "God is know- ing," on this reinterpretation, means that God produced an intelligent, orderly world. Ascribing actions to God in the way Maimonides suggests purportedly avoids those difficulties that generate a negative interpretation of divine attributes. 1 Throughout references to the Guide are to the English translation by Shlomo Pines, Chicago 1963. Maimonides' discussion and classification of predicables occurs in I, 52, p. 114-9. 85</page><page sequence="2">Here I want to explore the philosophical import of Maimonides' attributes of action. In particular I want to address the following ques- tions: How do attributes of action logically differ from other predicates? What justifies their affirmation of God! Do such affirma- tions avoid those difficulties that generate a negative interpretation of divine attributes? I intend to show that in attributes of action Maimonides proposes a viable alternative alongside negative language about God - an alternative that mollifies the usual charge of agnosticism. I While recent commentators have focussed, both critically and con- structively, on Maimonides' so-called negative theology, they have tended to gloss over the other aspect, namely, a reinterpretation of attributes as actions.2 1. M. Boch√©nski, for instance, analyzes the logic of negative attributes but not that of attributes of action.3 In a recent study comparing Avicenna, Maimonides and Aquinas, David B. Bur- rell remarks, Because Maimonides could not see how we could alter our characteristic manner of attributing when it came to divinity, nor could he attenuate the traditional confession that God is one, he had recourse to a radical agnosticism regarding the statements we use to praise God....4 However, it is not obvious that the charge of a radical agnosticism stands up in light of Maimonides' attempt to provide a positive way of talking about God in terms of actions. Yet Burrell gives no con- sideration to attributes of action and their apparently distinct logical status in Maimonides. Alexander Broadie correctly summarizes Maimonides viewpoint on attributes of action: 2 Some recent constructive studies are by Harry A.

Burrell, Knowing the Unknowable God : Ibn-Sina, Maimonides , Aquinas , Notre Dame, Indiana 1986, p. 57. 86</page><page sequence="3">The only exception that Maimonides allows to the thesis that affirmative attribu- tion cannot be made truly of God concerns God's actions. For he holds God's actions not to be part of God, that is, part of His nature, but to follow from that nature.3 Since actions do not describe God's nature, Broadie apparently does not see in them any helpful solution to the dilemma of either accepting univocal predication of God and its implicit anthropomorphism or equivocal predication and its implicit agnosticism.6 But, like Burrell, he faults Maimonides on the grounds of his negative theology without considering attributes of action. And although Isaac Franck defends negative theology, he considers Maimonides to be ambivalent or even inconsistent about an otherwise thoroughly negative theology, rather than to offer a legitimate alternative in attributes of action. About attributes of action, Franck remarks, 4 'This modification of his negative theology is surely a Maimonidean equivocation. It is noted by Aquinas in his De Potentia Dei and is properly criticized by him."7 But in adopting Aquinas' criticism, Franck also follows Aquinas in misunderstanding attributes of action. Two earlier, textual studies brought out the originality of Maimonides' attributes of action. Tracing Maimonides' classification of predicables to the influence of Aristotle, Harry A. Wolfson never- theless concludes: This classification of attributes by Maimonides, quite apart from its specific theological application, may be considered, in its bearing upon the general problem of the nature of logical judgment, as a new and independent revision of Aristotle's list of predicables - one on a par with the revision introduced by Porphyry, and perhaps even of greater importance than the Porphyrian revision.8 But Wolfson leaves aside an important philosophical question: "What Maimonides really means by action that is not a relation is not the subject of the present paper."9 Seymour Feldman does take up this 5 Alexander Broadie, Maimonides and Aquinas on the Names of God , in: Religious Studies, 23 (1987), p. 159. 6 See ibid., p. 161. 7 Franck, Maimonides and Aquinas , in: Maimonides , ed.

According to Feldman, the distinction between relations and actions in Maimonides constitutes not only an original feature of his overall theory of attributes, but also the essential point of his theory that the Scholastics failed either to recognizc at all or to appreciate fully.10 Unlike his predecessors who included actions under relations and allowed both to be predicated of God, 4 'Maimonides sharply distinguishes between these two types of predications and allows only one of them to be ascribed to God."11 And although Feldman, like Wolfson, lays out the textual context of Maimonides' theory of divine attributes understood as actions, he notes that "it is not the purpose of this paper to construct an argument in behalf of Maimonides' theory of attributes."12 A few recent interpreters have noted the significance of attributes of action in Maimonides' understanding of specific divine attributes. Thus Arthur Hyman shows that talk about divine wisdom and divine will in Maimonides can refer only to effects produced by God, that is properties of the world. Since for Maimonides order and regularity seem to be a sign of wisdom, disorder and irregularity a sign of will, it is the order and disorder appearing in the world that yield the interpretations of divine wisdom and will.13 Similarly, Lenn Evan Goodman argues that matter and form, philosophically associated with disorder and order in the natural world, are for Maimonides the only means by which to know anything of God. And he goes on to argue that Maimonides identified matter with the will of God, and thought or form with the traditional attribute of wisdom, both of which he believed to be mere human ways of recognizing God's act.14 10 Seymour Feldman, A Scholastic Misinterpretation of Maimonides ' Doctrine of Divine Attributes , in: Journal of Jewish Studies, 19 (1968), [23-39] and reprinted in Maimonides , ed.

A philosophical explanation, I believe, rests on Maimonides' theory of predication and his understanding of agency as a distinct kind of causality different from natural causation. I will proceed by first outlining the general problem and framework of Maimonides' discus- sion of divine attributes and then offering a philosophical clarification of his theory regarding attributes of action. II For Maimonides, as for others in the medieval tradition, the problem of language about God poses a dilemma, arising from two opposing poles: the transcendent nature of the divine reality, on the one hand, and limitations inherent in human conceptualization and language, on the other.15 The one risks total agnosticism and the other, a false anthropomorphism. Philosophically Maimonides approaches the problem from within a metaphysical and epistemological framework.16 Maimonides begins his formal discussion of divine attributes by maintaining, like Aristotle, that only propositions are truth-bearers. His insistence on true beliefs over mere verbal assertions and his defi- nition of beliefs as involving an intellectual apprehension of the reality of things imply that both meaningful language and true beliefs express propositions that correspond to reality.17 The problem of language about God, then, is bound by beliefs about the reality of God, which can only derive from demonstrations of his existence. But demonstrations of God's existence, according to Maimonides, 15 For a brief, clear statement of the problem in the Jewish, Islamic and Christian medieval tradition see Burrcll, The Unknowable God , p. 1-4. 16 For the different philosophical problems implicit in the question of divine attributes see my Maimonides and the Problem of Divine Attributes , forthcoming in: Thought. 17 See Guide I, 50, p. 1 1 1 : "belief is not the notion that is uttered, but the notion that is represented in the soul when it has been averred of it that it is in fact just as it has been represented." For the Aristotelian influence behind these claims see Wolfson, Aristotelian Predicables , p. 203-4. 89</page><page sequence="6">show that God exists of necessity as a totally uncaused being.18 As a consequence, God is neither ontologically composite nor comparable to anything else. If God were composite, then He would need some cause to explain His existence as a unified entity; and if He were com- parable to anything else, then there would be some feature in com- mon. But there cannot be anything in common between an ontologically necessary existent and everything else that is ontologically dependent on it. And even if this were possible, it would imply an additional feature and thus composition in God. For Maimonides, God is absolutely simple, single and unique. It also follows that God has neither essential nor accidental attributes. For on an Aristotelian understanding of attributes, accidental attributes would imply that the divine reality is composite and essential attributes would imply that it is both composite and caused.19 More- over, since no attributes pertain to the divine reality by which to apprehend it, we cannot apprehend what it is; we can only apprehend the fact that it is.20 The implication for theological language is that language pur- portedly descriptive of what a thing is, could not meaningfully apply to God in the same sense. This is so because meaningful language expresses true beliefs and true beliefs about the reality of things within human experience do imply both composition and comparison. They imply composition, because what is apprehended within human experience is contingent and caused, the result of matter and form. Moreover, they imply comparison, because the concepts by which the reality of such things are comprehended designate universais, features held in common by several entities. Thus any descriptive language that implies composition in the nature of an entity or comparison with other things must be literally false when applied to God. For this 18 See Guide II, 1 , p. 243-52; but also I, 57, p. 132 and 58, p. 135. What is established in Book II is presupposed in the discussion of divine attributes in Book I. 19 See Guide I, 51, p. 112-3. Although attributes as universais have only a conceptual status, they have a distinct ontological status in the reality of things as well; see Harry A. Wolfson, Maimonides on Modes and Universais , in: Studies in Rationalism , Judaism, and Universalism , ed. Raphael Loewe, London 1966, p. 311-21, and reprinted in Maimonides , ed. Buijs, p. 166-74; and also his earlier study, Cres√ßas and the Problem of Divine Attributes , in: Jewish Quarterly Review, n.s. 7 (1916), p. 12. 20 See Guide I, 58, p. 135: ... we are only able to apprehend the fact that He is and cannot apprehend His quiddity." 90</page><page sequence="7">reason Maimonides insists on a total equivocal use of terms in their application to God and other things.21 Maimonides is nevertheless faced with religious tradition, with its extensive and seemingly meaningful talk about God; he is also aware of a human need to acquire knowledge of God, expressed by way of language. Maimonides' immediate response to this pressure is to urge a reinterpretation of language about God. But then one problem is how language about God is to be reinterpreted, while respecting the absolutely simple and incomparable nature of God. Another problem is whether we are left with any knowledge of God at all. For even in a reinterpreted sense language about God must express true beliefs otherwise it is pure fanciful language. And if no knowledge is possible at all, then we are left with silence. At this point Maimonides gives a logical twist to the problem of theological language. Since only propositions are truth-bearers, any question about meaningful language as well as true beliefs reduce to the question whether "God" can serve as the subject in a logical prop- osition.22 This question, in turn, forces him to look anew at predica- tion in general and at kinds of predicables in particular. Maimonides advances conditions of predication in connection with a reductio argument against the supposition that either essential or accidental attributes might pertain to God. Terms used as predicates in a proposition, Maimonides admits, may designate either an essence or accidents. Now when terms designate an essence, he goes on to argue, they may do so either by simply identifying it or by explaining it. Maimonides' example for the 21 See Guide I, 52, p. 114 and 56, p. 131. Even an analogical use of language is excluded, because on Maimonides' understanding an analogical use of terms presup- poses some comparison between two entities. His rejection of analogical language deserves more attention in its own right. Some suggest that his rejection does not affect the Thomistic theory of analogy, because Maimonides has a more restrictive concept of analogy than Aquinas; see, for instance, M. T.-L. Penido, Les Attributs de Dieu d'apr√®s Ma√Ømonide, in: Revue N√©o-scolastique de Philosophie, 26 (1924), 137-63; or Harry A. Wolfson, The Amphibolous Terms in Aristotle , Arabic Philosophy and Maimonides , in: Harvard Theological Review, 31 (1938), 151-73, and reprinted in Studies in the History of Philosophy and Religion , ed. Isadore Twersky and George H. Williams, Vol. I, Cambridge, Mass. 1973, 455-77. I believe that a Maimonidean argument can be generated against the Thomistic theory of analogy. 22 Wolfson emphasized this logical dimension of the problem of attributes in Maimonides; see Wolfson, Cres√ßas , p. 2-5, and Aristotelian Predicables , p. 201-2. 91</page><page sequence="8">first usage is as if we said "Man is man" and for the second, as if we said 4 'Man is a rational animal."23 The latter illustrates an instance of predication, the former does not. His examples also indicate that propositions that explain an essence are informative about their sub- ject, whereas those that simply identify it are uninformative. The logical moral is not only that predication requires a relation between subject and predicate but also that the proposition be infor- mative about its subject. But these conditions are met, only if there is an ontological distinction between what the subject term designates and what the predicate term designates. There is such a distinction between an entity and its accidental attributes, which are added to its essence.24 There is also such a distinction between an entity and its essential attributes, for essential attributes constitute the causal com- ponents of a composite entity.25 Conventional Aristotelian predica- tion, namely, essential and accidental predication, satisfies these con- ditions. The requisite ontological distinction is assured because the predicate terms are general, designating universal attributes. But a problem arises when predicate terms are singular. These Aristotle held to point out, rather than describe, a subject. He did not consider that propositions with singular predicate terms constitute instances of predication.26 While "Socrates is a man" expresses an instance of predication, "Socrates is this man" or "This man is Socrates" does not. Applied to God, this conclusion means that if general terms were predicated of God, designating either essential or accidental attributes, the propositions would be false. Thus "God" could not stand as the subject term in such a proposition and still have it con- stitute an instance of predication. But if terms were applied to God as singular terms or names, then "God" could stand as the subject term in a (nominal) proposition, but the proposition would remain uninfor- mative, asserting tautologously that God is God.27 On the one hand, language about God apparently demands the use of singular terms that would identify, but not describe, the divine 23 See Guide I, 51, p. 113. 24 See Guide I, 51, p. 113, and 52, p. 115. 25 See Guide I, 52, p. 115. 26 See Wolfson, Cres√ßas , p. 5-6. 27 This logical conclusion confirms Maimonides' contention that terms can only be applied equivocally to God and other things. 92</page><page sequence="9">reality. On the other, singular terms do not seem to satisfy the general conditions for predication. Not content to leave the issue here, Maimonides looks at predicables anew, to see whether there are any singular terms applicable to God that nevertheless satisfy the general conditions for predication, that is, of designating an ontological distinction between subject and predicate. He finds such a predicate in terms designating actions. As mentioned at the outset, Maimonides classifies predicates into those that signify (i) definitions, (ii) parts of definitions, (iii) qualities, (iv) relations, and (v) actions.28 Wolfson has shown how Maimonides arrived at this list by combining Aristotle's ten categories, the developed Aristotelian list of four predicables, and Porphyry's modification.29 What interests us here is Maimonides' concern whether any of the terms on his list are truly predicable of God. He excludes the first three, namely, terms designating (i) definitions, (ii) parts of definitions, and (iii) qualities from being predicable of God. The first two indicate essential predication; the third accidental predication. Any of these, if predicated of God, would entail a multiplicity in God's essence. For accidental predication presupposes accidents that are added to an essence, while essential predication presupposes essential attributes that are distinct causal components.30 The fourth, terms designating (iv) relations, do not directly refer to an essence or to accidents. Nevertheless, according to Maimonides, rela- tional attributes do presuppose some attributes in the things related: corporeal attributes for temporal and spatial relations, a likeness or similarity for other relations.31 Thus relational predicates fall under either essential or accidental predication and are likewise excluded. Only terms signifying (v) actions Maimonides allows to be predicable of God. If so, then such predication must differ from both essential and accidental predication, otherwise it would violate restric- 28 See Guide I, 52, p. 114-9. 29 See Wolfson, Aristotelian Predicables , p. 201-34. Maimonides maintained a list of five predicables, as did Prophyry; he maintained the distinction between essential and accidental predication, as did Aristotle. He included in his own classification predicates understood to refer to any of the ten categories as well as those designating a definition (or species), genus, property, accidents, or specific difference. 30 See Guide I, 52, p. 114-5; and also Wolfson, Cres√ßas , p. 10-3. 31 See Guide I, 57, p. 116-8. 93</page><page sequence="10">tions imposed on language about God. Yet it must also satisfy the con- ditions of predication in general, otherwise the propositions cannot form the basis of true beliefs. How do attributes of action satisfy these demands? First, such predicates do not designate an essence but the products or effects of an essence. They designate a definite act, a specific event or state of affairs produced by an agent. Thus this kind of predicate term may be considered a singular term. Maimonides' example in the Guide is "Zayd built this wall" or "Zayd made this garment."32 Second, actions are not to be confused with habits or dispositions in the agent, the art or skill by which acts may be produced.33 Since habits fall under qualities, attributes of action do not designate the usual accidents, i.e., qualities or relations, either. Thus since attributes of action imply neither essential nor accidental attributes, they violate no restrictions on language about God. Yet what the predicate term designates is ontologically distinct from what the subject term designates. Propositions with attributes of action are informative about their subject, not in saying what it is, but in saying what it did or may do. Maimonides is proposing a different kind of predication in addition to the usual Aristotelian essential and accidental predication. He sees the difference - explicitly stated in his Treatise on Logic - in two struc- turally different propositions: propositions of the third adjacent and propositions of the second adjacent.34 The distinction may be put this way. A proposition of the third adjacent takes the form of 1) A is P; and a proposition of the second adjacent takes the form of 2) A o's. 32 See Guide I, 52, p. 119. While Pines (see note 1 above) uses 4 'action," Goodman ( Rambam , Readings in the Philosophy of Moses Maimonides , selected and trans. L. E. Goodman, New York 1976, p. 83) uses "work" to translate the Arabic JiH and the Hebrew peculah. The terms are clearly linked to both "verb" and "action"; see Wolfson, Aristotelian Predicables , p. 231. 33 See Guide I, 52, p. 118: "I do not intend to signify by the words, his action, the habitus of an art that belongs to him who is described - as when you say a carpenter or a smith - inasmuch as this belongs to the species of quality, as we have mentioned. But I intend to signify by the word, his action, the action that he who is described has performed." See also Wolfson, Aristotelian Predicables , p. 219-20. 94</page><page sequence="11">In (1) "P" stands for a descriptive term that is grammatically a noun or adjective; in (2) "0" stands for a descriptive term that is gram- matically a verb. In (1), propositions of the third adjacent, the relation of predication is expressed by the copula "is", either explicitly or implicitly; in (2), propositions of the second adjacent, the relation of predication is expressed directly by the predicate term, without the need of the copula "is".35 While Maimonides simply notes the distinction in his Treatise on Logic , in the context of the Guide he exploits it.36 For there he indicates that not all propositions are instances of predication. Those are not which are uninformative about their subject, because they imply no ontological distinction. But that is so only in (1) when its predicate term is singular, rather than general. But (2) does imply an ontological distinction, even when its predicate term is singular. When (1) is an instance of predication, P either explains A (in the case of essential predication) or describes A (in the case of accidental predication); the relation of predication is one of inclusion. In (2), 0 not only describes a state of affairs but also identifies A as the agent of that state of affairs. In other words, a relation of identity in (1) does not give an instance of predication, but in (2) identity is the relation of predication. A clearer reformulation of (2) then is 3) A is the one who (may, did) 0. Here "is" expresses a relation of identity between a subject and the agent of an act.37 34 See Maimonides, Treatise on Logic , trans. Israel Efros, New York 1938, ch. 3, p. 37. Aristotle suggests the distinction in De Interpretation (v, 1 9a5- 1 8) ; Ammonius labelled the two kinds of propositions; see Sir William Hamilton, Lectures on Logic , 2nd ed., ed. H. L. Mansel and John Veitch (Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt 1969; originally published in 1866), Vol. I, p. 228-30. 35 Unlike formalized modern logic, the Aristotelian subject-predicate logic still main- tains a linguistic structure. 36 The Treatise on Logic can be taken as presupposed in the Guide-, see, for instance, Guide , 4 'Epistle Dedicatory," p. 3, and I, 55, p. 129; and more recently Raymond L. Weiss, On the Scope of Maimonides' Logic, Or, What Joseph Knew , in: Straight Path , ed. Link-Salinger, p. 255-65. 37 This interpretation differs from Wolfson's conclusion in his early study of the problem in which he maintained that for Maimonides the relation of predication can- not be one of identity; see Wolfson, Cres√ßas , p. 4-6. But there Wolfson still included actions under relations, calling them dynamic relations as distinct from other external relations. He also considered Maimonides' theory of attributes to be "typical rather than original" (ibid., p. 24) - a view he revised later in "Aristotelian Predicables." 95</page><page sequence="12">Since in language about God only singular terms amounting to a statement of identity could uphold the divine simplicity and incom- parability, only terms designating actions could be predicated truthfully and positively of God. Other predicates can only be predicated negatively of God. Consequently, traditional language about God can be reinterpreted into true propositions provided terms predicated of God are understood as either negative attributes or attributes of action.38 Maimonides explicitly develops the latter inter- pretation for the traditional attributes of knowledge, power, will, and life; it is also the interpretation expanded by Hyman and Goodman in showing that, for Maimonide, talk about divine knowledge refers to order in the world and talk about divine will to disorder.39 Ill Answering several difficulties may serve not only to clarify Maimonides' view on attributes of action but to justify their legitimate application to God. The distinction between (1), propositions of the third adjacent, and (2), propositions of the second adjacent, it may be objected, is not a logical distinction, because any proposition in the form of (2) can be reformulated into a proposition in the form of (1). We can as well say "S builds a house" and "S is building a house" or "S built a house" and "S was building a house" (and so for other tenses). But for Maimonides statements in the form if (2) do not translate into (1) and retain the same meaning. English, and other languages, is ambiguous here in a way that the language of Maimonides is not. In Hebrew (and Arabic) the two sentences ''S is building a house" and "S builds a house" (or parallel sentences in other tenses) are grammatically as well as semantically different.40 The first sentence uses a verbal adjec- tive with the copula understood. The second sentence has a tensed verb, with neither an explicit nor implicit copula. The connotation of 38 See Guide I, 58, p. 136: "It has become clear to you that every attribute that we predicate of Him is an attribute of action or, if the attribute is intende for the apprehension of His essence and not of His action, it signifies the negation of the privation of the attribute in question." 39 See Guide I, 53, p. 121-122 and notes 13 and 14, above. 40 See Wolfson, Aristotelian Predicables , p. 229-31. 96</page><page sequence="13">the first sentence is to describe the subject as "a builder (of houses)"; it refers to the art or habit of building, a quality in the agent. The con- notation of the second sentence is to describe the result or effect of building. By themselves, Maimonides suggests, attributes of action say nothing about how the agent produced the event or state of affairs; it says only that it did. This explains Maimonides' reinterpretation of traditional divine attributes into attributes of action. Claims about divine knowledge or divine mercy, for instance, are to be taken to refer to specific events or states of affairs of which God is the agent. But even in the case of attributes of action, Maimonides suggests, terms are used equivocally in their application to God and human beings.41 From a human point of view, Maimonides would describe certain acts in relation to acquired habits or dispositions. But in the case of God actions cannot be understood to imply accidental or essential attributes, as they do in the case of human beings. Thus, for example, "God is merciful," on Maimonides' reinterpretation, means ''God is the one who did this (which we consider an act of mercy)." Another objection - raised by Aquinas and more recently taken over from him by Franck - argues that a reinterpretation into attributes of action would allow any terms whatsoever to be ascribed to God because such terms refer to the effects of God's agency and God is ultimately the cause of anything that exists.42 On Maimonides' formula, according to Aquinas, we can say God is angry because God is the cause of anger. Likewise, then, we can say God is fire or God is corporeal, because God is the cause of fire and the cause of material bodies. However, Aquinas' mistake here is twofold. First, he inter- prets Maimonides' attributes of action as causal attributes; second, he misses Maimonides' stricture that descriptive terms are applied to God only because we interpret actions a certain way. It is not Maimonides' contention to claim, as did the Latin Scholastics, that God is merciful because He is the cause of mercy.43 And so it is like- 41 See Guide I, 54, p. 123-8: "The meaning here is not that He possesses moral quali- ties, but that He performs actions resembling the actions that in us proceed from moral qualities - I mean from aptitudes of the soul; the meaning is not that He, may He be exalted, possesses aptitudes of the soul" (p. 124). 42 See Franck, Maimonides and Aquinas , in: Maimonides , ed. Buijs, p. 286. Aquinas raises the objection in De Potentia Dei , Q.7, a. 5, and Summa Theologiae I, Q.13, a. 2. " bee relaman, Misinterpretation , m Maimonides , ed. Buijs, p. 272-3. 97</page><page sequence="14">wise not correct to suggest that God is fire because he is the cause of fire or that God is corporeal because he is the cause of material bodies. Such causal language presupposes a relation of likeness between cause and effect, a relation Maimonides denies to God. Attributes of action are not unique to theological language. We could say, for example, 4 'So and so set a fire," but from this it does not follow that "So and so is fire." What, according to Maimonides, we could presumably say appropriately is "God is the one who made fire" or "God is the one who made material bodies." Maimonides would defend his position further by distinguishing the results of agency from the effects of natural causation. In a salient discussion of causality, Maimonides first notes a difference between "proximate" or "intermediate" causes and an ultimate cause, "the First Cause of all things. ' ,44 He goes on to list three kinds of proximate causes: accidental, essential or natural, and voluntary. The first, accidental causation, refers to chance. The second, essential or natural causation, to the Aristotelian causes involved in natural change. The third, voluntary causation, Maimonides further divides into animal instinct and human free choice.45 What interests us here is the distinc- tion between natural causation and free choice or human agency. Now natural causation, on an Aristotelian understanding, falls into the category of action and passion. That is, one entity is by its essence or nature a certain kind of cause because of an active disposition and another entity is a certain kind of effect because of a passive, receptive disposition. Natural causation also entails the principle that causes produce like effects.46 Thus causal predication, that is, to say that X causes Y, for Maimonides, amounts to relational predication, as is evident as well in the scholastic formula "God is merciful because He is the cause of mercy." By referring to natural causes or natural effects, in an Aristotelian sense, propositions imply a relation of similarity and thus presuppose attributes on the part of two entities. 44 Guide II, 48, p. 409. 45 See Guide II, 48, p. 410-1. 46 Some of the elements of Aristotle s theory of causality are contained in Physics II, 3, 194bl6-195b30; III, 1, 200bl2-201bl5. See also Feldman, Misinterpretation , in: Maimonides , ed. Buijs, p. 273; and Guide I, 53, p. 120: "However, he who knows the nature of fire, knows that it performs all of these actions by virtue of one active qual- ity, namely, heat." 98</page><page sequence="15">But having distinguished attributes of action from relational predicates, and having distinguished actions from dispositions, it follows that actions, for Maimonides, are not to be confused with natural causation. In other words, the realm of human agency - and even more so of divine agency - is not that of natural causation. The results of natural causation issue from entities that are alike in certain respects. The results of human agency issue from the intellect and will.47 Indeed, Maimonides adopts the language of emanation to explain agency as distinct from natural causation. Natural causation applies to material bodies interacting and effecting each other; emanation applies to the agency of immaterial entities, such as intellects.48 What is produced by way of the intellect and will, then, results by way of emanation. The implication of Maimonides' discussion of attributes of action as applied to God is that divine agency is neither comparable to natural causation nor to human agency. In particular, God cannot be under- stood to be the cause of the world in any usual - i.e., Aristotelian, physical - sense of that term.49 Not only do the notions of cause and effect imply a relation of similarity and thus distinct features, they also imply a necessary connection between cause and effect.50 Thus if God were a cause of a natural kind, that would imply, first, that God had a certain feature similar to its effect, and, second, that the effect results necessarily, given its cause. Neither implication is acceptable to 47 See, for instance, Guide I, 53, p. 121; II, 48, p. 410-1; III, 17, p. 469; and III, 25, p. 502-3. 48 See his characterization of the agency of immaterial entities in terms of "overflow" in contrast with the agency of material entities in Guide II, 12, p. 277-80. For a more detailed discussion of Maimonides' theory of causality see Arthur Hyman, Maimonides on Causality , in: Maimonides and Philosophy , ed. Shlomo Pines and Yirmiyahu Yovel, Dordrecht 1986, especially, p. 162-5. 49 Maimonides agrees with philosophers in considering God to be the efficient, formal and final cause of the world. But he does so cautiously. For this is to be understood in the sense of ultimate or first cause. And in that case, Maimonides sees no difference in calling God "cause" or "maker," i.e., ultimate agent; see Guide I, 69, p. 166-7. We may ask here why God cannot also be considered the material cause of the world in the sense of ultimate cause or ground? But we must remember his insistence on a total equivocal use of terms when it comes to talking about God. These notions are spelled out in opposition to what they usually mean in a human context. 50 See Guide I, 69, p. 166-7. 99</page><page sequence="16">Maimonides, for different reasons.51 Divine agency must also differ from human agency, first, because human agency is quite limited in its capabilities and, second, because human agency involves acquired dispositions or habits as well as knowledge.52 Thus, the world as a whole and certain features of it are in effect attributed to the agency of God, because neither natural causation nor human agency suffices to explain them. For example, in human affairs order is the result of knowledge. If neither natural causation nor human agency can ade- quately explain the order in the world, then by a process of elimination it is attributable to divine agency.53 But precisely how or why such order is brought about by divine agency we cannot comprehend. In keeping with their logical function, attributes of action identify an agent. They neither describe the agent nor explain the act. IV Some final comments are in order. First, Hyman suggest that, on Maimonides' view, only accidental attributes are to be reinterpreted as actional attributes in the case of God whereas essential attributes receive a negative reinterpretation: It remains that essential attributes predicated of God signify by negation or "negation of privation," while accidental attributes, among which there are qualities, habits and dispositions, signify as attributes of action.54 True, only what we consider essential attributes, i.e., perfections, are predicable of God and then signify by "the negation of privation."55 51 To the first implication, as noted, he objects in terms of God's incomparability; to the second he objects in connection with the eternity of the world which would entail a total necessitarian worldview; see, Guide II, 25, p. 328-9; and also Hyman, Maimonides on Creation , in: Studies , ed. Wippel, p. 45-61. 52 See Guide I, 54, p. 124. For the distinction between human knowledge and divine knowledge see, for instance, Guide I, 69, p. 163-6; III, 20, p. 480-2. 53 See, for instance, Goodman, Matter and Form , in: Straight Path , ed. Link-Salinger, p. 86-97; and Hyman, Maimonides on Creation , in: Studies , ed. Wippel, p. 45-61. 54 Hyman, Maimonides on Causality , in: Maimonides , ed. Pines and Yovel, p. 166; see also his Maimonides on Creation , in: Studies , ed. Wippel, p. 54: "For the case of essential attributes Maimonides holds that they must be predicated according to complete equivocation and that they signify by "negation of privation.' ... For the case of accidental attributes he holds that they must be understood as attributes of action." 55 See Guide I, 53, p. 123: "it may be believed with regard to some of them that they are attributes indicative of a perfection likened to our perfection, which are under- stood by us." See also I, 59, p. 139; 60, p. 143: "in God, may He be exalted, there is nothing belonging to the same species as the attributes that are regarded by us as perfections, but that all these attributes are deficiencies with regard to God." 100</page><page sequence="17">But accidental attributes are simply to be denied to God.56 However, such attributes as knowledge and will, Maimonides himself lists among the traditional essential attributes. He also reinterprets them both actionally and negatively.57 Thus essential and accidental attributes can be handled by a negative interpretation when applied to God, albeit in different ways; they can also be handled by a reinter- pretation as attributes of action.58 Both forms of reinterpretation are more on an equal footing than Hyman allows. The dual interpretation also raises a question about the purpose of each. Maimonides suggests that negative attributes serve a theoretical function, the contemplation of the divine reality within human limits;59 attributes of action serve a practical function, the imitation of God within human lives.60 Secondly, it is somewhat surprising to find Maimonides' contribu- tion to the theory of predication missing from the history of logic.61 As an assessment of the Treatise on Logic , Nicholas Rescher is quite correct when he writes, 4 'Maimonides' logic treatise contributes nothing new: it is a standard compendium of Arabic logical terminology. Its main importance lies in its role in transmitting this tradition to the Jews."62 But this is also a work written in Maimonides' youth; it only mentions the distinction between propositions of the third adjacent and proposi- tions of the second adjacent. In his more mature thinking in the Guide 56 See Guide I, 55, p. 128-9. 57 See Guide I, 53, p. 121-3; 57, p. 132; 58, p. 135-6. 58 One may well wonder whether the other traditional essential attributes, such as existence, unity, eternity, life and power, could also be reinterpreted as attributes of action and what that reinterpretation would be. 59 See Guide I, 58, p. 135: "As for the negative attributes, they are those that must be believed with regard to Him, may He be exalted, for no notion of multiplicity can attach to Him in any respect on account of them; and, moreover, they conduct the mind towards the utmost reach that man may attain in the apprehension of Him, may He be exalted." See also I, 59, p. 137-43. 60 See Guide I, 54, p. 127-8; III, 54, p. 638. 61 There is no mention of the distinction between propositions of the third adjacent and propositions of the second adjacent, nor of Maimonides, in such studies as William Kneale and Martha Kneale, The Development of Logic , Oxford 1962 and I. M. Boch√©nski, A History of Formal Logic , tr. Ivo Thomas, 2nd ed., New York 1970 (lrst ed., University of Notre Dame 1961). An otherwise extensive bibliography, Ashworth's study, likewise, lists no references to Maimonides' Treatise on Logic ; see E. J. Ashworth, The Tradition of Medieval Logic and Speculative Grammar from Anselm to the End of the Seventeenth Century. A Bibliography from 1836 Onwards , Toronto 1978. 62 Nicholas Rescher, The Development of Arabic Logic , Pittsburgh 1964, p. 181. 101</page><page sequence="18">and in connection with the problem of theological language, however, Maimonides exploited that distinction to develop a distinct form of predication and a distinct kind of predicate. Contrary, to Burrell who sees a failure in Maimonides "to alter our characteristic manner of attributing/' Maimonides did precisely that.63 He broadened the usual understanding of predication by including propositions that des- cribe actions in contrast to essences and their related natural causes. Finally, does this form of predication when applied to God avoid the dilemma of either anthropomorphism or agnosticism? It does avoid anthropomorphism provided attributes of action are understood pro- perly. For in attributing specific acts to divine agency, attributes of action ascribe what is distinctive and unique to God and only to God. If agnosticism is overcome only by a comprehension of the divine essence, then attributes of action do not avoid this horn of the dilemma. Negative language is intended to provide a systematic pro- cess of removing God from human conceptualization. Language in terms of attributes of action have the effect of identifying God as the agent of certain events in the world or of certain features of the world. The conception of divine agency, however, is still in human terms and, like negation, by way of exclusion or contrast. Yet on Maimonides' view, we are not totally at a loss regarding a human comprehension of God; nor is the content of such a comprehension exclusively negative. And this, Maimonides would maintain, is the best one could attain given the totally transcendent reality of God and the limitations of human knowledge.
