<plain_text><page sequence="1">READING ADAB AS F1QH: AL-GAHIZ'S SINGING-GIRLS AND THE LIMITS OF LEGAL REASONING {QIYÄS)1 Ignacio SÁNCHEZ University of Cambridge INTRODUCTION In the last years, have appeared, important contributions to the study of al-Gahiz aimed at reading his works in a new light and revising the stereotyped image of the author as a mercurial adtb eager to pander to his many patrons. This simplistic characterization of al-Gãhiz's "literary genius" together with a misleading biographical emphasis on the analysis of his works, brought about the scholarly phenomenon that James Montgomery has denominated Buhalaism, an approach that dissolves the apparent oddities of al-Gãhiz's works into the familiar conventions of his alleged humoristic treatises, such as the Kitãb al-Buhala. As a result of these misconceptions, al-Gãhiz's reputation as a reliable witness and active agent of the religious-political polemics of the Early 'Abbãsid period has carried the stigma of his inconstancy and many of his treatises have not received the attention they deserved2. This paper, inspired by the same revisionist spirit, aims to contribute to this new reading of the Gãhizian legacy by focusing on the complexities of one of his most famous works, the Epistle on the Singing Girls (Risàia fi al-qiy an). Concretely I shall be looking at one of the aspects of this work that I consider has been especially overlooked by scholars: al-Gãhiz's use of legal arguments. In this regard, this paper is an experiment in reading the treatises of fiqh and adab- works together and an attempt to demonstrate al-Gãhiz's acquaintance with legal hermeneutics. Al-Gãhiz's Risàia fi al-Qiyãn has been traditionally read as a reflection on love and passion, especially after Cheikh-Moussa's influential article "La négation d'Éros" of which I will make wide use3. 1 will argue that, in addition to this discourse based on the dichotomy hubb/'isq, there is a second argumentative line which addresses a scholarly polemic concerning the limits of legal prohibition and the interpretation of the revealed sources, and that this legal context is necessary for a proper understanding of the Risàia fi al-qiyãn. 1. 1 wish to thank James Montgomery and the anonymous reviewer for their valuable and insightful comments on this article. 2.

In fact, the little we know about al-Gãhiz's relation with the Muslim jurists of his time and his acquaintance with the principles of law shows a very negative image. Already in the third/ninth century, it was precisely one of al-Gãhiz's students, Ibn Qutayba, who put the first nail in the coffin where the credibility of his former teacher would be buried. Ibn Qutayba accused al-6ãhiz of being inconstant, capable of defending contradictory opinions, of using false hadïts and, even worse, of forging them4. This opinion, together with al-Gãhiz's Mu'tazilite credentials, his personal involvement in the Mihna, and the vitriolic treatises he wrote against the members of the Traditionist milieu to whom he contemptuously referred to as Hašwiyya and Nãbita, gained him the fame he has enjoyed ever since, that of being a refined adib who despised the religious scholars, a valuable yet anarchic theologian, and ftagellum hereticorum in his own way, which was determined by his defence of the Mu'tazilite cause5. We would not find many traces of al-Gahiz's interest in fiqh if we paid attention to the inventory of his works. Out of the almost 300 titles collected by Charles Pellat, only one refers directly to a legal topic, the Kitãb fi habar al-wãhid mentioned by al-BãqillãnT6. This work, if it ever existed, has not survived. The reference is also a single report in itself; we do not have any other reference to this treatise, but al-Bãqillãní knew what he was talking about: this work is mentioned, together with al-Gãhiz's Nazm al-Quran and al-Radd 'alã al-Nasãrã, as one of the works where the author discussed the concept of habar. The treatment of ahbãr is also the main topic of another treatise of al-6ãhiz, the Kitãb al-ahbãr wa-kayfa tasihhu, where al-Gãhiz reports the opinions of al-Nazzãm concerning hadit7. The information provided by this text does not offer any particular insight into al- Gähiz's attitude towards the religious scholars and legal theory, but there are other works that, despite not being exclusively devoted to legal topics, show clearly that al-Gãhiz was not only familiar with the legal polemics of his time, but also with the hermeneutical principles invoked in these debates. Of course, al-Gãhiz's interests were not reduced to the ahbãr. James Montgomery was the first to draw attention to the clear parallelisms between al-Gãhiz's definition of bayãn and that made by al-Šáfťí in his Risala8. For Montgomery, this discussion may have been part of a polemical engagement with al-ŠáfiTs treatment of this subject, an engagement that has been also recognised by Joseph Lowry in his study of al-ŠafiTs Risãla9. The relation between al-Gãhiz and al-Šáfn goes beyond the particular polemic concerning the definition of bayãn. Although I am aware of but a single direct reference to al-Šáfn in the works of al-čahiz10, al-Šáfn is a constant presence in his treatises and al- 4. Ibn Qutayba, Muhtalifal-hadït , p. 59-60. 5.

The Risala fi al-qiyãn provides a good example of this relation and, in general, of al-Gãhiz's knowledge of the legal polemics of his time. As I will argue, this epistle not only addreses real legal debates but also, legal polemics governing the underlying logic of this treatise and structure the entire text. DRAMATIS PERSONAE AND STRUCTURE OF THE EPISTLE Like the rest of al-Gãhiz's treatises, the Risala fi al-qiyãn is a polyphonic text of extraordinary complexity where several dialogic structures levels interact at varied levels. There are four interlocutors; three of them correspond to the different voices that speak in the epistle, as Cheikh-Moussa has shown, and the fourth are the addresses of the epistle, who do not speak but whose arguments are exposed and refuted:12 1) The 'Abbãsid notables who defend their right to enjoy the pleasures provided by singing-girls and whose names are given in the opening paragraph. As Cheikh- Moussa has demonstrated, they were notable members of the 'Abbãsid court and their voice corresponds to the first person plural in §1-32. 13 2) Those who criticised the practice of frequenting the company of singing girls, who are referred to as Hašwiyya, a pejorative term usually used by al-Gãhiz to refer to the most ignorant members of the Traditionist milieu. They are the addresses of the epistle. 3) Al-Gãhiz, whose voice would correspond to the first person singular in §33-35, and, occasionally, also in other parts of the epistle. 4) The merchants of singing girls ( muqayyinûn ), who defend both the lawfulness of trading with slave-girls and the dilatory ruses they employ to excite the passion of their clients, increase the frequency of their visits and obtain more benefits; their voice would correspond to the first person plural in §38-54. Both Pellat and Beeston, whose reading of al-Gãhiz's epistles is often conditioned by the digressive style of this author, have considered the Risàia fi al-qiyãn a highly disorganised work; after all, anecdotes were al-Gähiz's bread and butter and his innate curiosity prevented him from following a systematic method14. Of course, this is but one more of the "Buhalaist" stereotypes about this author that should be rejected. Beyond the welter of confusing voices there are two clear argumentative lines that structure the epistle: l) Discourse on law: the discussion between the purported authors of the epistle and their critics, the Hašwiyya, is centred on the discussion of the limits of the prohibitions contained in the revealed sources and the dichotomy harãm/halãl. 11. Al-Gãhiz makes a consistent use of Šáfťite hermeneutics especially in the Kitãb al-'utmãníyya. I have analysed al-Gãhiz's treatment of the Qur an in this treatise, see Sánchez (forthcoming ). 12. Cheikh-Moussa 1990, p. 101. 13. Cheikh-Moussa 1990, p. 89-95. 14. A good example of this consideration is Pellaťs taxonomy in his collection of translations from al-Gãhiz's treatises, see Pellat 1984.</page><page sequence="4">206 IGNACIO SÁNCHEZ The defence of the lawfulness of their trade made by the muqayyinün addresses similar critiques and is centred on the legal distinction between intention ( niyya ) and act (amai), and evidence ( zãhir ) and suspicion (sub ha). 2 ) Discourse on love and passion: this discourse has been read as an exposition of al-Gãhiz's ethical ideas to condemn the practice defended by the authors of the epistle. Cheikh-Moussa has cogently argued that al-Gãhiz's treatment of the qiyãn is predicated upon a solid theory of human passions and has demonstrated how al-Gãhiz's treatment of the dichotomy hubb/'isq articulates part of the arguments developed in this epistle. For Cheikh-Moussa, the purpose of this work is to elevate the discourse on human passions to the ethical level, overcoming the sophistry of the legal disquisitions that emerges here and there throughout the treatise. For him, the legal principles adduced in this text are indisputable for the Muslims and, despite the efforts of the defenders of the relations with the qiyãn to disguise their arguments behind decontextualised Qur anic quotations, the êarï'a clearly states that these practices are unlawful15. The references to legal arguments should be interpreted, therefore, as satirical allusions that provoke the opposite effect to the one intended. The main purpose of al-Gãhiz in this risala is to define the ethical boundaries that the members of the hãssa should respect; consequently, the logic that underlines his treatment of the polemics concerning the qiyãn should be found in al- Gâhiz's ethical theories. It is beyond doubt that the discourse on human passions constitutes one of the axis of this epistle. I do not consider, however, that legal considerations play any less a part. On the contrary, al-Gãhiz's epistle is also structured upon clear juridical argumentations and the legal issues prompted in this text were by no means undisputed, indeed, they refer to important polemics addressed by al-Gãhiz in other works. THE DISCOURSE ON LAW IN THE RISÃLA FIAL-QIYÄN If we consider the legal justifications adduced against the contention that socializing with singing girls and participating in their trade is unlawful, we can indentify a clear and coherent narrative line in the epistle that goes from the general to the particular: in the first part of the treatise, the discussion is focused on the lawfulness of the practice of seeing the faces of women, talking with them and enjoying their company; in the second part, the debate moves on to the slaves and hovers over proxenetism and sexual intercourse with singing-girls, often disguised as a commercial transaction. The preamble introduces the two main intellectual interlocutors of the treatise: the purported authors of the epistle and their adversaries, later on referred to as Hašwiyya16. The object of the polemic is also clearly stated: the authors hold that enjoying the company of singing slaves and participating in their trade does not contravene any law and they 15.

Although I have closely followed Pellat and Beeston's translations, the passages translated in this article are my own].</page><page sequence="5">READING ADAB AS FIQH: AL-ÖAHIZ'S SINGING-GIRLS AND THE LIMITS OF LEGAL REASONING ( QIYÄS ) 207 have decided to write this epistle so that their silence would not be interpreted as a tacit admission of the arguments of their critics. The first argumentative line is essentially devoted to refuting the claims of those who hold that looking at women and engaging in conversation with them is unlawful. The defence of this practice begins with a discussion of the natural causes explaining the mutual need of men and women that includes several references to Qur anic verses: the Earth is for man "a chattel and 'a usufruct for a time"' (Q. 2:36); "the woman 'was created so that [the man] could find solace in her'" (Q. 7:189, 30:2l)17; and "women are tillage ground for men" (Q. 2:223)18. The alleged authors of the risàia argue that men could have freely used women, as these verses imply, were it not that God had imposed over them the obligation (fard) of prohibiting that which is illicit and allowing that which is licit ( tahrim ma harrama wa-tahlñ mã ahalla Allah ) so that there would not be doubts concerning paternity and the assignation of inheritances19. The object of the discussion conveyed in the first part of the epistle [§§7-27] is, precisely, to determine what should and should not be prohibited concerning the relationship of men and women. The premise adduced to discuss this point may be read in terms of legal theory: "Everything that we do not find that the Book of God Almighty and the sunna of the Messenger of God -peace be upon him- have rendered unlawful ( mahram ) is legally indifferent (mubãh) and unqualified ( mutlaq ); people deeming something good ( istihsãn ) or bad ( istiqbãh ) do not provide any basis for legal reasoning ( qiyãs ) as long as we do not infer from the proscriptions ( tahrim ) [in the Qur an and the sunna] a sign (dalli) about something being good (husni-hi) and an indication of its lawfulness (halãli-hi). We do not know any rationale (wagh) for jealousy concerning other's [gaining access to women] than those who are prohibited ( harãm ); were it not because of the existence of the prohibition [regarding the mahãrim], jealousy would have disappeared and it would have been incumbent upon us [to apply] legal reasoning (qiyãs) about who is more entitled to a woman, [otherwise] someone would say: 'no one is more adequate for them than another, as they are like nosegays or apples that people exchange at one another'. That is why the man who would have had many women contents himself with one and shares the rest among his associates: when the legal obligation (farida) of differentiating between the lawful and the unlawful (al-halãl wa-l-harãm) was established, then the Muslims contented themselves with the limit established for them and gave the man permission to do that which they authorise for him."20 This passage is extremely complicated and presents serious textual problems. I interpret this argumentation as follows: all prohibitions should derive from the revealed sources, Qur an and sunna; if the revelation is silent concerning a particular issue this should be considered permitted, unless it is indifferent and unqualified. In order to ethically evaluate acts not directly addressed by the Qur an and the suna, and consider something good or bad, the reasoning should be based on the signs (dala il) provided by the legal prohibitions explicitly considered in the revealed sources, but it is not legitimate to infer legal rules form the opinion of the people about what should be considered good or bad (istihsãn). 17.

Qiyãn, § 9 [I47;12fj.</page><page sequence="6">208 IGNACIO SÁNCHEZ It is worth noting that the emphasis falls on the limits of the prohibition rather than on the possibilities of extending it to other cases by applying legal reasoning. In this regard, the condemnation of istihsãn follows an extremely reductionist approach to the sources of law and is intended to limit the scope of the laws that forbid relations with women exclusively to the mahãrim, as we can see in the several examples provided to illustrate this point in the Gãhiliyya as well as in Islam. The famous couples of pre-Islamic udrï lovers are mentioned to demonstrate that looking at women and talking with them (al-nazar wa-1-muhãdata ) was permitted in the õãhiliyya21, and that Muhammad forbade this practice exclusively (hassatan) when it involved married women, who should wear veil. With this particular exception, the Prophet did not abrogate this practice and it was not declared harãm in Islam22. The custom of performing the circumambulation unveiled is also adduced as an example, together with the story of Duba a bint 'Ãmir, who performed the tawãf naked, and brought about this tradition. Other examples are taken from episodes of the history of Islam, such as the caliph 'Umar, who, despite being known for his jealousy and his piety, allowed 'All to see his wife unveiled and did not prohibit this.23 According to the alleged authors of the risala, there is nothing against this practice in the religious sources except the specific laws concerning the wives. Respectable figures of Islam with great expertise in law such as 'Umar, 'Ali, or al-Sa'bï, would have prohibited this practice if they had known any prophetic tradition condemning this. Analogy is also adduced to support this claim: if looking at middle-aged women is not prohibited, it should not be considered prohibited when the women are young24. As in the aforementioned paragraph rejecting istihsãn, the reasoning is extremely restrictive: in absence of any explicit prohibition, this issue is legally indifferent and only narrow-minded people overstep the limits of jealousy ( hadd al-gayra ) - which should be limited to one's wives -, and consider the prohibition of looking at women as an obligation and duty ( ka-1-hãqq al-wãgib )25. Taking jealousy beyond the limits of that which God has declared harãm is not only futile ( bãtil ), but proper to frail minds like those of women.26 THE DEFENCE OF THE SINGING-GIRLS At this point, the argumentation abandons the general discourse on women and focuses particularly on the slave-girls27. The first point treated is the possession of slave girls and their appearance in public. Caliphs and noble men provide a good example of the lawfulness of owning slave-girls and enjoying their company in the presence of other men: Mu awiya used to have slave-girls and show them in public28, and caliphs and important 21.

The first to be discussed is singing. There is nothing reproachful in singing, as it is based on poetry and music. Poetry is not good or bad perse, as 'Umar b. al-Hattãb said: poetry is a kind of speech that should be judged according to its content, and the addition of melody does not contravene any prohibition.31 A prophetic hadït stating that "Some poetry is true wisdom" ( inna min al-si'r hikma) is also quoted to defend the lawfulness of poetry. As in the discussion concerning jealousy, the conclusion is that there is no legal basis in the Qur an and the sunna to consider singing or singers unlawful. Several examples of famous figures of Islam who enjoyed music are mentioned in support of its licitness. The list is striking, to say the least: the first example is certainly a pious Muslim, 'Abd Allãh b. Ga'far al-Tayyãr, who is said to have owned slave girls who sang and also a singing boy32; the pious 'Umar b. 'Abd al-'AzTz is also mentioned, as he used to be a singer before coming to the caliphal throne; the remaining examples, however, are Umayyad caliphs who did not enter into history as models of virtue: YazTd b. Mu awiya, who used to listen to music; YazTd b. 'Abd al-Malik, owner of a famous and virtuous qayna named Sallãma; and Walïd b. Yazïd, who was known by his love poetry. Cheikh-Moussa has noted the paradox of using these examples to defend the lawfulness of singing, when these caliphs are presented in the historical chronicles as epigones of the moral laxity and the dissolute life of the Umayyads.33 For Cheikh-Moussa these passages are an ironic reference to the faulty argumentation of those who defend the lawfulness of singing: the doubtful moral authority of the figures used to support their claim would be incompatible with the rightful position they intend to defend, and the reference to the ominous Umayyad caliphs would achieve the contrary effect and undermine their arguments. However, the Umayyad caliphs were not universally regarded as impious in time of al-Gãhiz; in fact, they enjoyed great acceptance among certain groups of the urban milieu associated to the ahi al-hadït, to the extent that some of them excluded 'All from the a'immat al-hudã and included Muãwiya and his son Yazïd among them.34 Ibn Qutayba mentions them when criticizing the extremism of some muhadditün who, in their zeal to refute the Mu'tazilite theses on the createdness of the Quran, went as far as to adopt anthropomorphist ideas ( tašbih ). The Risàia fi al-nãbita of al-Gãhiz is another example of this association of the traditionist milieu both with the Umayyads and anthropomorphism. It would be possible, then, to see in these references to the Umayyads a way of pointing out not only the contradictions of the defenders of the singing-girls, but rather those who held them as role-model, the Hašwiyya, who certainly were related to the pro-Umayyad Traditionists and had been the target of al-Gãhiz's darts 29.

It is pertinent to take this possibility into consideration, not only because war'a was behind the movements that, invoking the doctrine of al-amr bi-1-ma'rüf, condemned music36; but especially because it was based on similar legal principles to those adduced in defence of the qiyãn: whereas for the authors of the risaia everything not explicitly forbidden in the Qur an and the sunna is legally indifferent and, therefore, licit; for the Hašwiyya, anything not expressly sanctioned by the religious sources is suspicious of being harãm and, consequently, should be avoided.37 The defence of singing reported in this risàia could very well be an allusion to these polemics, and the striking mention of the Umayyad caliphs be explained with this interpretation. However, the defence of the singing girls goes further and the line between harãm and halãl becomes more blurred: it is no longer the practice of looking at free women and talking with them, or the pleasure of enjoying their company and their music, which needs to be justified: the next step in this particular tour de force is the description of the arts of coquetry in which the singing girls excelled and the discussion of the sexual relations to which this often led. The first explicit reference to sexual relations with the slaves seems to pose another conundrum: it is an anecdote about al-Ma'mûn that does not present him in a very positive light. According to the authors, al-Ma'mün was infatuated with one of his wife's slaves, whom his wife set free so that the caliph could marry her, giving her a dowry of ten thousand dirhams. Right after the consummation of the marriage, al-Ma'mûn let her go and paid her the money.38 If anything, this example seems to justify temporary marriage. Similar strategies are ascribed to the slaves who beguile their clients into marrying then to calm a passion that expires the very moment it is consummated39, and the muqayyinün to whom al-Gãhiz gives voice at the end of the epistle openly admit that muťa was the hidden intention behind the visits of many of their clients.40 Cheikh-Moussa argues that the association of al-Ma'mün with the owners of slave-girls and the authors that sign the epistle cannot be understood but as a satire, as it would have been highly improbable that al-6ãhiz would have assimilated the practices of the admired 'Abbãsid caliph to those of the lovers of singing-girls. We cannot exclude the possibility that this reference, like those of the Umayyads, may have conveyed an ironic meaning. However, the reference to al-Ma'mün can also be considered pertinent and logical for two main reasons: on the one hand, the presumed authors of the letter were attached to court figures who represented the cultural and legal heritage of al-Ma'mün; on the other hand, several sources include, among the polemical measures adopted by al-Ma'mün, the acceptance of temporary marriage (muta).41 35.

Aktam proved</page><page sequence="9">READING ADAB AS FIQH: AL-ÖAHIZ'S SINGING-GIRLS AND THE LIMITS OF LEGAL REASONING (QIYÃS) 211 Al-Gãhiz himself dealt with this issue in one of his works. The extant fragments of the Kitãb al-'abbàsiyya discuss the unlawfulness of two polemical measures taken by the first two caliphs: Abü Bakr's rejection of Fätima's claims over the inheritance of Muhammad, concretely the estates of Fadak and Haybar; and 'Umar's prohibition of the two modalities of temporary marriage, the tamattu' on the pilgrimage and the muťat al-nisã'.42 Al-Gãhiz's treatise relates the opinions of those who refuted the decisions of Abü Bakr and 'Umar on the basis of the principles governing the abrogation of Qur anic verses, wrongly applied by both caliphs; for them, the revocation of these decisions was correct. Although no mention is made of al-Ma'mün in the few passages that have survived from this treatise, we know that al-Ma'mün revoked both measures and the most plausible interpretation of these fragments is that they may have been part of a polemic concerning the controversial religious policies of this caliph.43 The prosopographical study carried out by Nagm and Cheikh-Moussa allows us to situate the alleged authors of the Risàia fi al-qiyãn in the human cartography of the early 'Abbãsid period44. All the figures mentioned in the introduction belonged to the circles of the 'Abbãsid court, and almost all of them seem to have been related to one of al-Gãhiz's patrons, Muhammad b. 'Abd al-Malik Ibn al-Zayyãt. Ibn al-Zayyãt was vizier for al-Mu'tasim and al-Wãtiq during the Mihna period, between 221/833 and 233/847, until he fell into disgrace with al-Mutawakkil, who ordered his imprisonment, torture and execution. The opposition between the members of the court and the urban 'ulamã' during this period has been thoroughly studied. Al-Ma'mün's religious policies and their continuation until the caliphate of al-Mutawakkil have been interpreted either as an attempt to restore for the caliphate the religious authority once associated to the person of the caliph, in opposition to the claims of the increasingly influential urban religious scholars;45 or as an authoritarian hiatus in the traditional cooperation of caliphs and scholars.46 In any case, the clash between the courtly elites, among whom the authors of the Risàia fi al-qiyãn should be included, and sectors of the urban milieu that became the seed-bed of the addressees of the epistle, the Hašwiyya, provide a plausible context to interpret this text and could explain the use of al-Ma'mün as an intellectual reference for this particular interpretation of the law. Does it mean that the defence of sexual intercourse with singing girls is related to al- Ma mün's revocation of the prohibition of muta? Even if the arranged marriage of the slave of al-Ma'mün's wife could be interpreted as a different modality of union, the anecdote about al-Ma'mün's ephemeral marriage is not innocent at all and the audience of this risàia would have perceived a clear allusion to the caliph's position with regard to muta ; furthermore, the final speech of the muqayyinün explicitly refers to temporary marriage the soundness of a prophetic hadït forbidding it.

THE QIYÄN AND THE LIMITS OF LEGAL INTERPRETATION The polemic that the Risàia fi al-qiyãn addresses is more sophisticated than that and echoes legal discussions that, already in time of al-Gãhiz, occupied the minds of important jurists. It is true that the epistle has an overall satirical tone, but satire is only possible because the interlocutors base their arguments on a shared paradigm, which is applied to discuss the lawfulness of all the practices considered in this epistle: looking at women and talking with them, owning slaves and displaying them in presence of other men, admiring the musical arts of the singing-girls and, eventually, enjoying their amatory skills. The arguments conveyed by al-Gãhiz are part of a scholarly polemic, an internal debate among jurists for which, despite the scarcity of legal sources from the ninth century, it is possible to find some evidence. The main topic of this risàia, at least in terms of fiqh, is the definition of the limits of legal prohibition. As we have seen, it was formulated in a very restrictive way, limiting the scope of legal reasoning (qiyãs) and condemning istihsãn. These references are by no means a mere rhetorical trick, they point to a seriously debated issue already addressed in a work with which al-Gãhiz was familiar. In al-ŠáfiT s Risàia, in the midst of a discussion concerning the interpretation of law made by those who give priority to reason over revelation ( ahi al-'uqul), the concepts of istihsãn and qiyàs are discussed in very similar terms: "Do you permit someone to say: 'I employ istihsãn, without using qiyãs [astahsinu bi- ghayr qiyãs]?' Shâfiî: In my view; that is not permissible -though God knows best- for anyone. It is only for the ahi al-'ilm to express [legal] opinions, and not for others [innamã kãn li-ahì al-'ilm an yaqülü dun ghayrihim ], so that they express [legal] opinions that are related to a revealed text, by adhering to it, in situations for which there is no [directly opposite] revealed text, by analogizing from the revealed text [li-an yaqülü f¡ al-khabar bi-'ttibaihifîmâ laysa ßiT al-khabar] bi'1-qiyãs 'alã al-khabar]. If it were permissible to invalidate qiyãs, then it would be permissible for the ahi al- 'uqul, who are other than the ahi al-'ilm, to express opinions concerning matters for which there is no revealed text [khabar], according to whatever mere preferences [istihsãn] they happen to have at hand"48. The interlocutors of al-Šáfn in this passage, the denominated ahí al-'uqül, can hardly be related to the Hašwiyya fustigated in the Risãla fi al-Qiyãn. But it would be an error also to consider that Mu'tazilites such as al-Gãhiz would fall into this category without further consideration. The principle enunciated by al-Šáfil in this passage limits the possibilities of expressing legal opinions to the revealed texts, exactly in the same terms as the enunciation made by the defenders of singing-girls in his epistle. 47.

In this treatise he develops an unusual treatment of legal ignorance based on an extremely literalist interpretation of the sources of law.49 When dealing with the obligations of the judge, the limits of legal interpretation are defined in similar terms: "[There is] the Book, then the sunna , or that upon which the jurists ( ahi al-'ilm) do not disagree, or legal reasoning based on any of these [sources] ( qiyãs alá bad). It is not permitted for anyone to judge or pronounce a fatwá on the basis of istihsãn when istihsãn is not obligatory ( wãjib ) and not in any of these cases ( maãni) [i.e. Qur an, sunna, ijma, and qiyãs]. If someone asks: What is the proof that it is not permitted to apply istihsãn when it is not included in any of these cases, as you have mentioned in this book of yours? You should reply: God Almighty said 'Does man think that he is to be left directionless?' (Q. 75:36). The ahi al-eilm do not disagree upon the Qur an concerning that which you already know, that lack of direction' (suda) is that which is neither commanded nor forbidden (lã yumarwa-lãyunhá)7 and he who pronounces â fatwá or judges on the basis of that which has not been commanded has allowed himself [to do it] within the definition of 'the lack of direction' (suda), and God has made him know that he is not to be left directionless".50 This descriptions answer to al-SãfiTs well known definition of bayãn: the religious sources and the consensus of the ahi al-ilm provide enough guidance to apply legal reasoning in those cases not specifically addressed by the revelation. God does not leave people directionless, as He always provides dala il that may be interpreted, but istihsãn is not a valid hermeneutical technique. The most significant aspect of this treatise is precisely the treatment of the limitations of legal reasoning, which are discussed by al-Šáfťí as a consequence of the ignorance of law: "It is incumbent upon the judges only to accept but the justice concerning that which is evident (adlan fx al-zãhir ); the characteristics of justice among them are known and I have described them in another place. There may be justice in that which is evident (fi al-zãhir) and that which it conceals (fi sariri-hi) be not just, but God has not imposed a moral obligation [upon his subjects] (lam yukallif-hum) concerning those things for whose knowledge he has not provided a means of attaining (sabïl ilá ' ilmi-hi ), and he has only imposed on them, whenever possible, but to reject those who openly act (man zahora min- hu) against that which they consider justice".51 In his Risàia , a similar statement is made concerning the evaluation of witnesses: "We are legally responsible for accepting the fitness of a man [who testifies] on the basis of how he appears to us [ mã zahara lanã minhu]. We marry him off or make him an heir according to how his religion looks on the surface [mãyazhar lanã min islãmihi]" ,52 49. On this treatise see LOWRY, "Ignorance of the Law is Sometimes an Excuse: al-ShafiTs Ibtãl al-Istihsãn and the Construction of Juristic Authority", unpublished paper presented in the 5th Meeting of the School ofAbbasid Studies. 50.

Lowry 2007, p. 148.</page><page sequence="12">214 IGNACIO SÁNCHEZ However, the examples that illustrate the theoretical formulations of the Ibtãl al-istihsãn seem to be based in an almost literal interpretation of the sources, and the prohibitions they discuss limited to that with is explicitly forbidden in the revealed texts.53 As we have seen, the refutation of btihsãn in the Risala fi al-qiyãn is very similar to that of al-šáfií, but the concomitances between both works do not stop here; the way al-Gãhiz addresses the problem of evaluating evident acts (zahir al-umür ) is analogous to al-SãfiT s treatment and employs a very similar formulation. The muqayyinãn report that some people condemn the houses of singing-girls adducing that those who frequent these places do not do so with the purpose of listening to their music or purchasing them, but with the intention of having sexual intercourse with the slaves. The answer given to this accusation is based, precisely, on the limitation of the legal judgements to those acts that are public and evident: "Judgements are only applied to the evident acts (zãhir al-umür ) and God has not imposed upon his subjects the moral obligation ( lamyukallif) of judging according to the hidden ( bãtin ), nor of taking action concerning their intentions ( al-'amal 'alã al-niyyãt). Thus, a man is considered Muslim (yuqdã li-l-ragul bi-islãm) on the basis of how he appears (bi-mãyazhuru minhu). He may inwardly be a heretic, or considered the legitimate son of his father when, perhaps, the father whose paternity he claims did nor sire him; however, since he was born in his bed and it is known, his origin is traced back to him. If it were a duty ( kullifa ) upon the one who testifies for a man in any of these two cases to tell the truth, there could not be testimony on this matter. Those who attend our assemblies do not evidence anything of that which is attributed to them, and if they did it and we turned a blind eye to it, then we would not incur any sin".54 The textual complexity of this epistle and the lack of information about the circumstances of its composition do not allow us but to speculate about the significance of these references. Although the textual evidence is not conclusive, the parallelism between these passages and al-SãfiT s considerations seems clear and, due to al-Gãhiz's familiarity with al-ŠáfiTs Risàia, we would not be on the wrong path if we were to consider that he was making explicit reference to his thesis on istihsãn. Nevertheless, the intention behind the particular use of this legal argumentation in the Risàia fi al-qiyãn is quite different. In fact, al-Gãhiz and al-Šáfťí part ways the very moment these theoretical disquisitions are put into practice: al-Sâfi'ï is interested in the practical consequences of the ignorance of law; but the consequences that al-Gãhiz discusses in his epistle are those which result from the ignorance of the acts themselves and the fact that no judgement can be based on intention. It would be possible, as Cheikh-Moussa argues, that the use of solid legal arguments to build the defence of the singing-girls, and the engagement in real polemics debated at the 'Abbãsid court in the time of al-6ãhiz were a narrative device used to emphasise the absurdity of this position. However, the fundaments of the reasoning are completely coherent with the overall argumentative line, and, as I will try to argue, the justification of 53. Joseph Lowry has suggested that this could be a concession to the thesis of the ZãhirTs, who, of course, also refuted istihsãn. We know that the son of the founder of the school, Muhammad Ibn Abi Da ud included a refutation of istihsãn in his manual of jurisprudence, some of whose fragments have survived in quotations transmitted by al- QãdT al-Nu mãn, (see Stewart 2002). 54. Qíyãn, §37.</page><page sequence="13">READING ADAB AS FIQH: AL-ČAHIZ'S SINGING-GIRLS AND THE LIMITS OF LEGAL REASONING (QIYÃS) 215 sexual intercourse with slaves was by no means absurd in this context. If these arguments can be considered satirical is precisely because they can be read literally. THE SPIRIT OF THE LAW VS. THE LETTER OF THE LAW The emphasis on the limits of the practices rendered harãm, the restrictive - almost literalist - treatment of the revealed sources, and the refutation of istihsãn point to a debate focused on theoretical legal problems. However, the insistence on judging uniquely the evident indicia (zãhir al-итйг), the reference to the testimony of the witness and the formulation of many of the anecdotes seem to point in the opposite direction, to the realm of praxis. This apparent contradiction is solved in the last stage of the risàia, when we hear the allegations of the owners of the slave girls whose names, real or not, are given by al- Gãhiz. The muqayyirmn do not only defend the nobility of their occupation, but also its licitness. The basis for this point is that the alleged sexual relations with the slaves, when they exist, can only be interpreted as the licit consequence of a perfectly legal contractual procedure. Concretely, they claim that those who can differentiate between permitted and prohibited ( farq mã bayna al-halãl wa-l-harãm ) would not find anything illegal in proxenetism (kash).55 Selling a slave and buying her again for a lower price, once the passion of her buyer has dissipated and he wants to send her back to her former owner, is perfectly licit; and if the intention of the clients who visit their girls is to arrange a temporary marriage (уакйпи qasduhu li-1-muťa), they ask, what discredited should be attached to them?56 Indeed, they are applying the principles exposed at the beginning of the epistle: enjoying the company and musical skills has not been rendered harãm by God, therefore it is completely lawful; as for their trade, their transactions are perfectly legal, as the ahkãm can only be based on evidences, not on the hidden intentions of their clients. This last affirmation, sustained on the repeated arguments concerning the limits of legal interpretation, is the perfect corollary to this fascinating tour de force in defence of the singing girls, and discloses the underlying logic of the epistle: it is the letter of the law which counts, not its spirit. It also points to the legal polemic to which this treatise of al- Gãhiz ultimately answers: the debate concerning the mahãrig ft al-fiqh or hiyalfial-fiqh, the legal tricks or devices used to achieve an objective, sometimes illegal, through apparently legal means. It is within the broad framework of reference of fiqh and the particular context of the polemics concerning hiyal where the Risala fi al-qiyãn reveals all its rich complexity. Several treatises that bear testimony to the vividness of the discussion of hiyal in the early 'Abbasid period have survived. It was Joseph Schacht who made the greatest contribution to the study of this subject with the edition of four treatises on hiyal, three HanafF and one Sâfiî. Two of the Hanafï treatises were written in the third/ninth century: the Kitãb al-mahãrig fi al-hiyal by Muhammad b. al-Hasan al-Šaybaní (d. 189/805), and the Kitãb al-hiyal wa-1-mahãrig by Ahmad b. 'Umar al-Hassãf (d. 261/874); the third one is a commentary of al-Saybãnfs work by Muhammad b. Ahmad al-SarahsT (d. 448/1056), 55. Qíyãn, § 59. 56. Qiyan , 9 59.</page><page sequence="14">216 IGNACIO SÁNCHEZ included in his Kitãb al-mabsüt. The fourth one, entitled Kitãb al-hiyal ft al-fiqh, was written by the Sâfi'ite jurist Mahmûd b. al-Hasan al-Qazwïnï (fi. 440/1048), although we know that at least two other Sâfi'ite treatises on hiyal were written prior to the fourth/tenth century57. For Schacht, the discussions on these legal devices aimed to fill the gap between legal theory and social praxis58. The pious jurists of the first/seventh century formulated the legal rules in such a rigid manner that it prevented the development of varied commercial activities. Like Roman commercial law, which complemented the formal and rigid ius civile, hiyal would provide a valid way to overcome these limitations.59 Schacht's thesis have been revised in the last years, notably by Satoe Horii, who has criticised the sharp distinction he posited between theory and practice and emphasised the role that the hiyal played in the theoretical discussions of jurists attached to different schools, not only Hanafîs. Precisely, one of the arguments upon which Horii draws attention to signal the importance of taking seriously the juristic understanding of hiyal is that, according to the remarks made by al-Hassãf in the introductory chapter of his Mahãrig, "a legal act must be judged according to its appearance, irrespective of the real intentions behind it".60 Although al-Hassãf does not use the expressions zahir or bãtin, his definition of hila is based in the opposition of dealings ( muamalãt ) and suspicion ( šubha , wahm ): "There is nothing wrong in the legal devices (hiyal) concerning that which is licit ( fimãyahallu ) and admitted (yagûzu). The legal devices (hiyal) are something with which a man escapes from sins ( al-ma'ãtim ) and prohibition (al-harãm) and finds an exit (yahrugu ) with it towards that which is licit (halãl). In this and similar things there is nothing wrong. The only thing blameful in this is when a man uses a legal device (yahtãlu) against the rights of another man in order to prove him to be wrong (yabtuluhu ), or when he uses a legal device on something wrong until it becomes doubtful (hattä yuwahima) or applies it to something to create doubts about it (šubha). As for that which corresponds to the method that we have described, there is nothing wrong, and this is a book in which there are things that people need regarding their dealings ( muamalãtihim ) and issues (u mur)". 61 Al-Hassãf also states clearly that legal judgement cannot be based on intentions: "the intention (niyya) of someone does not change any of the legal decisions stipulated by God (hukm min ahkãm Allah), nor does it remove him from his position".62 It is beyond doubt that the arguments conveyed by al-Gãhiz address similar legal problems, but two questions remain open: first, can we find any direct relation between the singing girls and the treatises on hiyal ? Second, were the members of the 'Abbãsid court mentioned in the introduction and the Hašwiyya related to these particular polemics? The answer to the first question is, to a great extent, provided by al-Gãhiz himself. As we have seen, the way of acquiring a slave described by the muqayyinün is a legal device that conceals a temporary marriage. The anecdote where Umm Ga'far, al-Ma'mün's wife, 57.

Even the anecdotes about free women reproduce the typical casuistry of this literature: someone wants to marry a woman whose former husband has divorced under certain condition ( šart ), and a legal device is applied to solve this problem. The episode concerning 'Umar b. al-Hattãb is one of these cases. 'Umar married 'Ãtika bint Zayd b. Nufayl after she became a widow and had received part of her former husband's possessions on the condition of never remarrying. 'Umar found a way to break this promise by stipulating that he should give her an equivalent sum of money, and that she should distribute it in alms.63 Though apparently less contrary to the spirit of the law than the former example, the objective of this measure was none other than breaking a promise, one of the main subjects of the treatises on hiyal. If we pay attention to the taxonomy of the cases contemplated in these treatises, marriages with free women and slaves hold a privileged position. In the introduction of the commentary of al-ŠaybanÍ s Kitãb al-mahãríg fi al-hiyal made by al-Sarahsï, these are precisely the main causes adduced in order to prove the need of hiyal : "He who scrutinises the legal judgements ( ahkãm al-šar') finds that all kind of acts answer to the description [of hiîa]: if someone loves (ahabba) a woman, when he asks: 'what is the legal device (hila) for me to achieve her?', the answer is: 'marry her'; if he is infatuated with a slave ( hawã gãriya ) and asks: 'what is the legal device (hila) for me to achieve her?', the answer is: 'buy her'; when he does not like the company of his wife and asks: 'what is the legal device (hila) for me to separate from her?', the answer is: 'divorce her', and if, after divorcing her, he regrets [his decision] and asks about the legal device (hila) to solve this, the answer is: 're-marry her (rãggaahã)'; and after divorcing her three times, if she repents from her bad conduct and they both ask about a legal device (Ma) for them, the answer is that the legal device (hûa) consists in marrying her with another husband who should have sexual intercourse with her. Those who abhor the use of hiyal in legal decisions, in reality, abhor legal decisions themselves, and only those who have little attention fall in this confusion".64 If we were to evaluate this passage by applying the same criterion used to read al-Gãhiz's epistles we should conclude that this is a fine example of irony, but it is not: the Muslims jurists on the third/ninth century took this issue very seriously. Al-Sarahsf s commentary begins with a defence of hiyal from the attacks of those who, in his opinion, are ignorant ( guhhãl ), miserable (mukãsafa) and incapable of doing a proper analysis of the sources of law ( qillat al-ta'ammul ).65 This commentary was written in the first half of the six/eleventh century, but, as we have seen in the case of al-Hassãf, the treatises that have survived from the fourth/ninth century also adopt a defensive tone. Since we cannot consider that the defence of hiyal was exclusively HanafF, we cannot ascribe its critics to one specific school or orientation. However, both the especial involvement of the early Hanafï school in the development of hiyal and the anti-Traditionist theological positions of Abû Hanîfa and his followers are well known.66 The ascendancy of illustrious scholars related to the Basran or 63.

Melchert 1997, p. 32-38.</page><page sequence="16">218 IGNACIO SÁNCHEZ early HãnafT schools over the caliphal court is also well attested; we only need to think of Abü Yüsuf - represented in the Alflaylã wa-laylã as a master of hiyall 67 -, Yahyã b. Aktam, or the patron of al-Gãhiz and Ibn Hanbal's archenemy, Ibn Abï Du ad. It is also possible to find evidence of a clearly belligerent position against hiyal in the Traditionist milieu where those whom al-6ãhiz pejoratively denominated Hašwiyya belonged. No less a scholar than al-Buhãrl included a chapter condemning hiyal in his collection of hadït, which begins with a prophetic hadït stating that God rewards people according to their intentions ( amãl bi-l-niyya)68, and includes an explicit condemnation of the hiyal used to arrange a temporary marriage. Al-Buhârï, on the authority of 'All, reports that the Prophet forbad the practice of muta on the day of the Battle of Haybar: some people consider that the legal devices applied to arrange a temporary marriage (ihtiyãl hattã tamattaa ) render the marriage invalid ( al-nikãh fãsid ), others argue that the marriage is valid ( gaiz ), but its condition is invalid ( al-šart bãtil )69. The same reasoning is repeated in the commentary of a hadït condemning a legal device used to avoid paying the dowry denominated sigãr70. The quarrel between the members of the court presented as the alleged authors of the Risala fi al-Qiyãn, the muqayyinn, and their intellectual interlocutors, the Hašwiyya, echoes this polemic and applies the same legal arguments to the defence of the singing girls and the pleasures of their magãlis. As we have shown, the legal basis for this defence is by no means a sophistic inversion of the sana, but a reasoned and coherent reflection upon the hermeneutical techniques that allow legal interpretation and its limits. CONCLUSIONS The aim of this article was to emphasise the importance of legal disquisitions for the proper understanding of the Risàia fi al-qiyãn. In the light of these conclusions, however, we need to ask an obvious question: how can we harmonise this reading with the solid ethical considerations discussed in the epistle? The metanarrative twist of the last paragraph offering three authorial ascriptions -which Pellat did not considered part of the work-, suggests that this risàia may have been conceived as an intellectual game. The moral distance between the proper -and ethical- interpretation of law and the legal -yet unethical- devices used to render it practicable may have been for al-Gãhiz proportional to that which separated hubb and 'išq. I would like to propose, however, an alternative reading: would it be possible to understand this discourse on love as a subversion of the moral principles on which it relies, in the same way that legal principles were manipulated to defend the singing-girls? If, rather than as a critique of the singing-girls, we read the censure of infatuation as part of a discussion between the noble men, who want to enjoy the pleasures provided by the slave-girls, and the muqayyinün, who are interested in prolonging this passionate 67.

Al-Buhârï, Sahîh , n. 6559.</page><page sequence="17">READING ADAB AS FIQH : AL-ÖAHIZ'S SINGING-GIRLS AND THE LIMITS OF LEGAL REASONING (QIYÄS) 219 state, this argumentation acquires a different meaning which may be compatible with the discourse on law. The dangers of the singing-girls denounced by al-Gãhiz, who speaks in first person in these passages, are based on the passion they inspire and its consequences for the physical and mental health of the infatuated client. Unlike the pure sentiments inspired by love, passion disappears as soon as the object of desire is attained. If there is nothing illegal in this practice, then the only obstacle between those who want to enjoy the company of the singing-girls and the object of their passion is the dilatory practices of the muqayyinun who seek to increase their benefits and know that, when the lover possesses the beloved, passion ends and their profits diminish71. From this perspective, al-Gãhiz's discourse on love could have also been aimed at supporting the arguments of the authors of the epistle: enjoying the company of singing-girls is a licit and acceptable practice whose only danger lies in the greed of their owners, always eager to play with the feelings of the clients infatuated with their slaves; but if passion could be easily sated by attaining the object of desire through lawful means, then decorum and muru'a would remain intact. Thus, both the discourse on law and the discourse on love could have been used to build the arguments of the authors of the epistle: the first is addressed to the Hašwiyya, the second to the muqayyinun. This subversion of the ethical principles of law and love can only be understood as irony. As in other treatises of al-Gãhiz, the humoristic effect of this text depends to a great extent on the ignorance of those who are incapable of understanding the subtleties of his reasoning. The narrative device that explains the satirical nature of this masterpiece is not the humoristic face value of the opinions of its purported authors, but the use of solid and coherent arguments in defence of immoral practices. Of course, many of my affirmations are entirely conjectural, but this interpretation offers a possible reading. We are not familiar with the conventions governing this epistle and there is still much research needed to decipher the codes of 'Abbãsid etiquette and how they are related to the social logic of texts. The Risàia fi al-qiyãn is a paradigmatic example of the problems we researchers have to face. This text challenges, especially, the generic divisions that affect the study of adab, but also those which affect the study of Islamic law. In this paper I have tried to demonstrate that fiqh is not only another element in al-Gãhiz's cabinet of curiosities. His intellectual connection with figures such as al-Šáfi'I can shed light on many aspects of his work; conversely, al-Gãhiz's use of sophisticated hermeneutical principles bears testimony of the extent to which legal theory had permeated 'Abbãsid society by the third/ninth century. In this regard, it would not be an exaggeration to affirm that historians of literature should keep in mind legal polemics when reading al-Gãhiz, and that al-Gãhiz is one of those authors that the historians of Islamic law should read. 71.
