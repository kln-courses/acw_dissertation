<plain_text><page sequence="1">Darwinism and the Behavioral Theory of Sociocultural Evolution: An Analysis' John Langton Georgetown University This paper challenges the widely held view that the social sciences are theoretically impoverished disciplines which have failed to develop anything comparable to the paradigms used in the natural sciences. More precisely, the aim is to demonstrate that the synthesis of an abstract, Darwinian model of systemic adaptation and the behavioral principles of social learning produces a theory of sociocultural evolu- tion having the logical structure and explanatory power of the theory of natural selection presented in On the Origin of Species. The principal task of this paper is to demonstrate that the social sciences have the capacity to make the evolution of sociocultural systems2 as com- prehensible as Darwin made the evolution of species. More specifically, the major goal is to indicate that the synthesis of an abstract, Darwinian model of systemic adaptation and certain principles of social learning established by behavioral psychology yields a theory of sociocultural evolution pos- sessing the logical structure and explanatory power of the theory of natu- ral selection presented in On the Origin of Species (hereafter, Origin) (Dar- win 1964). To realize this goal, I will show that the social sciences know, nomologi- cally and factually, at least as much about innovation and enculturation as Darwin knew about heredity and variation; that they know at least as much about the struggle for reinforcement as Darwin knew about the struggle for existence; that they know at least as much about sociocultural selection as Darwin knew about natural selection; and that they know at 1 I would like to express my gratitude to Melissa Butler, Chris Goldman, and Andrea Langton for their helpful comments and encouragement, and I would also like to thank an anonymous reviewer whose careful critique helped to improve the structure of this essay. 2 The use of the term "evolution" in this paper is not meant to indicate a commit- ment to the idea that sociocultural systems develop in a "progressive," unilinear fash- ion. Evolution, following the definition offered by Lewontin (1968, p. 203), will mean here simply that "the current state of a system is the result of a more or less con- tinual change from its original state." More specifically, "sociocultural evolution" will be construed to mean "a selective cumulation of skills, technologies, recipes, beliefs, customs, organizational structures, and the like, retained through purely social modes of transmission, rather than in the genes" (Campbell 1975, p. 1104).

HEREDITY AND VARIATION Darwin's ideas on heredity broke no new ground; as Vorzimmer (1970) notes, his views on this subject were simply an amalgamation of the teach- ings of his age. Unfortunately, these teachings were radically flawed. On the one hand, Darwin accepted the unimpeachable notion that organ- isms have a strong proclivity to resemble their parents: white cats tend to beget white cats and black dogs tend to beget black dogs. A simple truism, this principle nonetheless serves as a cornerstone of the whole Darwinian edifice, for it insures that "any selected variety [i.e., mutation] will tend to propagate its new and modified form" (Darwin 1964, p. 5). On the other hand, Darwin also accepted the mistaken notion that or- ganisms inherit, for the most part, a balanced blend or mixture of their parents' characteristics. As Darwin's critics quickly realized, if this doctrine were true, and almost everyone agreed it was, the idea of organic evolution was false because, given the mechanics of blending inheritance, any mu- tation, regardless of its profitability or fitness, would be radically "diluted" and eventually obliterated as it passed from one generation to the next. In short, by accepting the doctrine of blending inheritance, Darwin em- braced a notion which reinforced the erroneous belief that every species had a fixed eidos or essence from which it could not depart. (This flaw in the theory of evolution was not completely corrected until the 1930s when the solid parts of Darwinism were transferred to the firm, "particulate" base of Mendelism.) While interesting, the intricacies and implications of Darwin's adherence to the doctrine of blending inheritance need not detain us further. Nor do we need to review his speculations about the causes of variation since, again, in the light of current knowledge there is little in them which will pass muster. What must be underscored, however, is that Darwin fully recognized that he possessed almost no causal knowledge about the pro- cesses of heredity and variation. In the first chapter of the Origin (p. 13), for example, he grants that "the laws governing inheritance are quite un- known; no one can say why some peculiarity . . . is sometimes inherited and sometimes not. . . ." Later, he concedes (p. 167): "our ignorance of the laws of variation is profound." Nevertheless, as a number of commen- tators (Ghiselin 1969; Gruber and Barrett 1974) have pointed out, Dar- win also knew that his theory would stand without the support of a causal explanation of either heredity or variation. 289</page><page sequence="3">American Journal of Sociology In addition to the principle that organisms have a strong tendency to resemble their parents, there are four propositions about variation3 in the organic world which are absolutely indispensable to Darwin's theory. All but one of these can be found compressed into a single sentence in the first chapter of the Origin (p. 12), which reads simply: ". . . the number and diversity of inherited deviations of structure, both those of slight and those of considerable physiological importance, is endless." Although many of Darwin's colleagues adamantly refused to accept this contention, no one today seriously disputes its accuracy. Indeed, we take it for granted that (a) certain variations (i.e., genetic mutations and recombinations) are heri- table; (b) they can affect any part of an organism, including its behavior; (c) heritable variations have been and are produced in prodigious quanti- ties; and (d) variations possess differential utility depending on the envi- ronments in which they occur. This fourth proposition is, of course, the capstone of the theory of natural selection. These four propositions, it should be evident, are not laws of nature; they are not universal conditionals, expressing determinate relationships between properties or events (see Hempel 1966). They are instead simple inductive generalizations, established by the empirical investigation of one case after another. Darwin's contention that ". . . the number and diversity of in- herited deviations . . . is endless," albeit scientifically much more valuable, is nonetheless logically equivalent to the proposition that people come in a wide variety of sizes and shapes. Both propositions are inductive general- izations which, although falsifiable, cannot be controverted by any single experiment. Inductive generalizations obviously cannot function as the axioms of a hypothetico-deductive theory because empirical laws cannot be logically derived from them. They can, however, be combined to produce novel con- clusions. For instance, from the four propositions under consideration, it follows inductively that species (i.e., reproductively isolated populations) evolve. Of course, this proposition is itself an inductive generalization. There is obviously a profound difference between establishing the valid- ity of an inductive generalization and explaining it: while the former enter- prise entails only the judicious accumulation of factual evidence, the latter 3 Despite the crucial role it plays in his theory, Darwin never explicitly defines the concept of variation in the Origin. Indeed, he simply assumes that his readers can grasp what variations are. As Norton (1973, pp. 283-84) notes, "[Darwin] held that the different types of variation formed a continuous series. At one end of this series were the small 'individual differences' which made the members of a species distin- guishable, and at the other were the infrequent 'single variations' which could be sufficiently marked to brand their bearers as 'sports' or monstrosities. Between these two extremes all degrees of departure from the average specific form were to be found, and Darwin implied that the more extreme the degree, the less frequent it was. Overall ... [his] categorization was phenotypic and vague. 290</page><page sequence="4">Darwinism and Sociocultural Evolution demands the specification of substantiated "covering laws." With this dis- tinction in mind, it can be said that Darwin amassed enough evidence to validate all his propositions about variation but failed, as suggested above, to supply the laws or empirical generalizations necessary to explain three of them. To be specific, he failed to explain why variations occur, why they are so ubiquitous, and why some are inherited and some are not. As Gruber and Barrett (1974, p. 106) observe, Darwin "managed to construct a the- ory in which heredity and variation operated as essential but unexplained premises." Darwin did succeed, however, in explaining in general and in some in- stances in detail why some variations were profitable and others were not. And it is for this reason, primarily, that his theory of evolution deserves to be ranked as one of the great theories of the natural sciences. INNOVATION AND ENCULTURATION A sociocultural system does not encompass everything which the members of a society have learned. Instead, it includes, at least as it is usually con- ceptualized, only those patterns of thought and behavior which are at a particular time common to, distinctive of, or widely dispersed through the social community as a whole or one of its principal subsystems. To be an element in a sociocultural system, a habitual mode of cognition or action "must be socially shared" (Murdock 1965, p. 125). Clearly, however, everything in a sociocultural system at a given time was at some prior time "outside" the system. Socially shared habits of thought and action begin as idiosyncrasies; they begin as the innovations, the discoveries, or perhaps simply the aberrations of particular individuals. Between 1837 and 1858, for example, the theory of descent with modification by means of natural selection was not part of any sociocultural system, even though it existed in the minds of Darwin and certain others (e.g., Asa Gray) in whom he had confided. Even after the presentation of the papers by Darwin and Wallace before the Linnean Society in 1858, the theory was still known only to a handful of people and thus was not yet a full-fledged sociocul- tural trait. It only achieved that distinction with the publication of the Origin. Not every novel thought or action produced by Homo sapiens has had the potential to become a sociocultural trait. An incredible number, it can be safely assumed, were found by their initiators to be so trivial, bizarre, wrong, painful, or repugnant that they were never disclosed to anyone else. Novelties or variations of this sort were not "heritable"-that is, there was no possibility that they could be retained by or become part of a socio- cultural complex. 291</page><page sequence="5">American Journal of Sociology If, however, every novel thought and action which has been socially ex- posed is categorized as a (potentially) "heritable" innovation, then, to paraphrase Darwin, their number and diversity are endless. This propo- sition, it should be clear, is not a law. It is an inductive generalization, and it functions in the behavioral theory of sociocultural evolution in the same way that its analog functions in Darwin's theory-as an essential but un- explained premise. The premise must be regarded as unexplained because, like Darwin, contemporary social scientists are profoundly ignorant of the laws governing the production of variations. As Kunkel (1970, p. 257) ob- served after surveying some of the major treatises on the role of creativity and innovation in social development, conditions conducive to . . . [these processes] are described, but actual procedures remain to be specified. Hypotheses abound, but undefined terms and vague psychological processes and relationships reduce them to the status of being merely "interesting." In view of the limited information available, then, it is probably best to make no theoretical commitment and to treat "creation" and "innovation" as relatively unknown processes. For purposes of development analysis, it is sufficient to assume that novel- ties-be they symbols, tools, ideas, or behavior patterns-become available to a community or individual. Before considering the phenomenon of enculturation, the mechanism of "inheritance" which operates in sociocultural systems, it is necessary to take a moment to examine Campbell's (1965, 1975) highly controversial claim that the production of behavioral or cognitive innovations is, like the production of biological mutations, a "blind" process. Judging from the re- sponses (e.g., Goldschmidt 1976) to Campbell's (1975) presidential address to the American Psychological Association, most social scientists would re- ject this claim in the belief that the interaction of human purposiveness and knowledge often results in the generation of innovations which are, in con- trast to biological variations, in some sense prescient, preadapted, or intel- ligent. When the modern biologist describes the production of genetic mutations as a blind or random process, he does not mean that the process is causally undetermined, that variability is completely unrestrained, or that all vari- ations occur with equiprobability. Rather, he means that mutational pro- cesses are "random with respect to need" (Campbell 1974, p. 150). As Waddington (1969, p. 370) explains, ". . . the occurrence of a mutation and the nature of the mutational change is not directly connected with the environmental circumstances which will exert natural selection on the re- sult. As far as natural selection and evolution is concerned, mutations therefore can be considered as effectively at random." That countless behavioral and ideational variations have been produced in a blind, haphazard manner is a proposition no social scientist would 292</page><page sequence="6">Darwinism and Sociocultural Evolution want to challenge. Novel thoughts, some intriguing, most otiose, often spring into people's minds without need, desire, or invitation. Similarly, "behavioral accidents" happen all the time and sometimes lead to remark- able innovations-the development of the process of inoculation by Pasteur stands as a classic case in point. The crucial question, however, is not whether many or even most behavioral and ideational variations are pro- duced blindly, but whether the conjunction of human purpose and knowl- edge can at least once in a while generate a stream of such variations which is in some sense preadapted, insightful, or biased toward solving a problem or garnering a reinforcer. Although this question cannot be answered definitively here, the case for the randomness of sociocultural variations can be made clearer and more concrete by briefly reviewing Semmelweis's discovery of the way to prevent childbed fever. This particular example is chosen for review be- cause Michael Ruse (1974, pp. 431-32), a philosopher generally sympa- thetic to the evolutionary perspective, has argued that it demonstrates that innovations do not necessarily appear at random. Ruse opens his argument with the assertion (p. 431) that one of the "major differences between bio- logical and cultural evolution is the way in which the two processes obtain the 'raw stuff' of evolution." Then, after conceding (pp. 431-32) that "in the cultural realm . . . one does get new elements which appear just at ran- dom and which are certainly not necessarily needed," he goes on to claim that ". . . many, if not most, new cultural elements [appear] because they are needed. They do not just appear at random." To support this conten- tion, Ruse then points to Semmelweis's discovery that strict hygienic mea- sures would prevent childbed fever as "one dramatic instance of a non- random occurrence of a new cultural element." It "cannot be said," Ruse declares (p. 432), that the discovery "occurred 'randomly' . . . because Semmelweis spent several years thinking and working hard, proposing and testing different hypotheses before he hit the right one." In contrast to Ruse's interpretation, it seems more plausible to argue that Semmelweis's discovery of the relationship between the hygiene of attending physicians and childbed fever did just appear at random. It did not appear simply because it was needed. Need-in this case the desire to remove a very punishing phenomenon from the environment-explains why Semmelweis "spent several years thinking and working hard, proposing and testing hypotheses." Need explains Semelweis's behavior-his seaching, his diligent but blind groping for a way to suppress a deadly disease. It does not explain what he found. If the existence of Semmelweis's need somehow explains his discovery of the correct hypothesis, it must also explain the discovery of all the incorrect ones as well. But if this is so, the existence of human need generates novelties in a random way. 293</page><page sequence="7">American Journal of Sociology One other issue suggested by this case should also be confronted briefly. It might seem that because Semmelweis's use of an experimental method- ology imbued his inquiry with a certain measure of rationality, his discov- ery of the practice which would prevent childbed fever was something other than a random event. The problem with this idea is that it analytically con- flates the "irrational" process of innovation or variation with, in this case at least, the "rational" process of selection. Experimentation is part of the "logic of justification," while the production of novel conjectures is part of the "logic of discovery." Experimentation is not a procedure for generating new hypotheses; it is a procedure for "selecting" them, for winnowing the false from the true. Experimentation, in short, is a means for intelligently appraising what "blind groping" has found. And, it might be added, this procedure is itself a form of knowledge acquired in an evolutionary manner. Experimentation began as a novel pattern of action and then became a sociocultural trait because of its reinforcing consequences. (For a behav- ioral interpretation of the evolution of scientific methodologies, see Staats [1975, p. 498].) Although contemporary social scientists know no more about the causes of variation than Darwin did, their knowledge of the process of "inheri- tance" is decidedly superior to his. Darwin, it will be recalled, knew that organisms tend to transmit their characteristics to their offspring, but he could not explain this fact. Nor could he explain why certain characteristics or variations were heritable and others were not, or why traits which em- pirical observation had shown to be heritable were sometimes not transmit- ted. Darwin, in short, could not explain any of the intricacies of heredity because, as he fully realized and frankly conceded, he had no nomological knowledge to bring to bear on the subject. Social scientists, fortunately, are not in a similar situation. We not only know that all the components of a sociological system are "heritable" (at least to some extent) and that they tend to be transmitted between and through generations, we also know why this is so. Utilizing the behavioral principles of social learning (e.g., modeling, vicarious and differential rein- forcement), we can explain, given knowledge of certain initial conditions (i.e., the relevant historical facts), why and how some sociocultural trait or peculiarity was "inherited" by a particular individual, and, more important, we can account for its overall rate of replication over time. Consider, for example, the Semmelweis case. Before his discovery of the relationship between improper hygiene and the occurrence of childbed fever, the Vienna General Hospital (circa 1846) had a particular institutional structure. One component was a particular behavioral practice. To save time and energy, the doctors and medical students "used to come to the 294</page><page sequence="8">Darwinism and Sociocultural Evolution [maternity] wards directly from performing dissections in the autopsy room, and examine the women in labor after only superficially washing their hands, which often retained a characteristic foul odor" (Hempel 1966, p. 5). Once Semmelweis ascertained that cadaveric matter carried the in- fectious material causing childbed fever, he ordered the medical students to wash their hands in a solution of chlorinated lime before making an examination. Mortality from childbed fever declined after the inauguration of this practice, and thus the hospital's institutional structure evolved through a process of sociocultural selection. By combining the principles of reinforcement theory and the facts asso- ciated with Semmelweis's discovery, it is not too difficult to explain why the practice of "scrubbing up" spread through the staff of the Vienna Gen- eral Hospital, the institution where Semmelweis worked, and, in the follow- ing decades, through the medical profession as a whole. With a little thought, most social scientists could undoubtedly compile an impressive list of the ways in which enculturation or socialization differs from heredity (and this indicates that, in a purely factual or descriptive way, we know as much about the former process as Darwin knew about the latter). The numerous differences between the biological and sociocultural processes of inheritance do not diminish the validity of the hypothesis that sociocultural systems evolve in a Darwinian manner. The Darwinian model of systemic adaptation does not require that traits be transmitted in a par- ticular fashion. It merely requires that a significant percentage of a system's selected traits and favorable innovations be transmitted from one gener- ation to another, or that they be replicated over time. As Alland (1967, p. 196) explains, "Evolution is a process through which systems develop and are modified in relation to specific environmental backgrounds. All the [Darwinian] theory requires is that there be mechanisms of variation (pro- ducing new variables) and mechanisms of continuity (preserving maximi- zation) present in these systems and that these systems be subject to envi- ronmental selection. There is no requirement that these mechanisms be spe- cifically biological in nature." Ultimately, the gross morphological continu- ities and changes discernible in a species or sociocultural system during a particular period are but aggregate reflections of the differing rates at which countless discrete traits are inherited or replicated.4 As Catton (1976, p. 45) has noted, "Cumulative change in the statistical distribution of a variant trait in a population over successive generations 4 The well-known process of "cultural diffusion" is, of course, a prime source of inno- vation for sociocultural systems. I have not examined the process in this paper because of space constraints and because I am convinced that the intersocietal diffusion (or selection) of forms of action and cognition can be explained by the same behavioral principles which explain the intrasocietal diffusion of these phenomena. 295</page><page sequence="9">American Journal of Sociology is what the word 'evolution' has meant ever since Darwin. It is too impor- tant a concept for sociologists to permit themselves to remain hazy about it." THE STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE The struggle for existence is the central explanatory concept in the theory of organic evolution, and Darwin wisely devotes the entire third chapter of the Origin to an analysis of the phenomena covered by the term. Yet he never formally defines the concept and warns against construing it in an entirely literal way (Origin, p. 62): ". . . I use the term Struggle for Exis- tence in a large and metaphorical sense, including dependence of one being on another and including (which is more important) not only the life of the individual, but success in leaving progeny." Like any metaphor, the struggle for existence presents the paradox of being simultaneously heuristic and misleading. On the one hand, it draws attention, and powerfully so, to a multitude of forces and relationships which influence the selection of variations. 'rhe mongoose and the cobra, for example, truly do struggle for existence, and a mongoose cursed with a genetic defect which slows it down a step or two has little chance of living long enough to pass on that unfavorable variation. On the other hand, as Darwin acknowledges (pp. 62-63), the metaphor of struggle tends to ob- scure nonviolent relations of dependence which are crucially related to the question of survival. "A plant on the edge of a desert is said to struggle for life against the drought, though more properly it should be said to be dependent on the moisture . .. the missletoe is dependent on the apple and a few other trees, but can only in a far-fetched sense be said to struggle with these trees, for if too many of these parasites grow on the same tree, it will languish and die." What is perhaps most misleading about the struggle-for-existence meta- phor is the suggestion that life and death are the only salient issues. Clearly, however, success in leaving progeny entails more than mere survival to sex- ual maturity. Many a creature, although attaining a ripe old age, never manages to reproduce itself because, as the case may be, it lacks or mani- fests a particular variation. Darwin (p. 88) himself brings this point home in the fourth chapter of the Origin when he examines the question of sexual selection, a condition which "depends, not on a struggle for existence, but on a struggle between the males for possession of the females and . . . whose result is not death to the unsuccessful competitor, but few or no offspring.'" After a painstaking exegesis of all the major concepts developed in the Origin, Ruse (1971, p. 317) concludes that "for Darwin, the struggle for existence is basically a struggle to survive long enough to reproduce, that is, 296</page><page sequence="10">Darwinism and Sociocultural Evolution to leave offspring, and that this is something which, if it is to be successful, usually leads to the death of other organisms (and if unsuccessful, is usu- ally so because of death), but not necessarily." While informative, this in- terpretation does not sufficiently illuminate the fact that Darwin's concep- tion of the struggle for existence incorporates every factor or variable which acts or has ever acted in a systematic way to check the numerical growth of a species (of course, by implication a large percentage of these factors are also responsible for natural selection, for the differential replication of variations within species). As Darwin emphasizes at one point (p. 74), "In the case of every species, many different checks, acting at different periods of life and during different seasons or years, probably come into play; some one check or some few being generally the most potent, but all concurring in determining the average number or even the existence of species. In some cases it can be shown that widely different checks act on the same species in different districts." The struggle for existence is, in essence, the concept which encompasses all the independent variables used in the theory of organic evolution; it is the term under which all the factors causally responsible for natural selec- tion are subsumed. In terms of its logical structure, this means that the Darwinian system is what Kaplan (1964) calls a concatenated theory.5 It is a theory which conceptually integrates all the known empirical relationships linking partic- ular environmental checks and the differential replication of certain vari- ations. THE STRUGGLE FOR REINFORCEMENT The struggle for reinforcement is the central explanatory concept of the behavioral theory of sociocultural evolution, and it is, like the struggle for existence, a metaphor. It suggests that men must "struggle" with their phys- ical and social environments to obtain the things which will fulfill their needs and wants. It suggests, moreover, that men do not obtain these things, these reinforcing phenomena, unless they adopt effective behavioral or cog- nitive strategies. More precisely, the struggle for reinforcement is a concept which encompasses all the independent variables responsible for the selec- tion of particular sociocultural traits. In evaluating this broad proposition, it is important to keep in mind that Darwin was not, as it has so often been claimed (e.g., Ghiselin 1969), the Newton of the biological sciences. Darwin did not discover any theoretical 5 According to Kaplan (1964, p. 298), "a concatenated theory is one whose component laws enter a network of relations so as to constitute an identifiable configuration or pattern." "Most typically," he adds, "they converge on some central point, each speci- fying one of the factors which play a part in the phenomenon which is to be explained." 297</page><page sequence="11">American Journal of Sociology laws; he did not even, in any precise sense of the term, discover the cause of natural selection. Nor did he formulate an empirical principle which biol- ogists could facilely invoke to explain the proliferation or extinction of any specific variation. His contribution, although useful, was much more mod- est: he demonstrated with a remarkable use of inductive logic that the cause of a particular case of selection could be found among the forces checking the population growth of the relevant species-or conversely, that the cause of a variation's selection, whether positive or negative, could be explained by examining its environmental consequences. Similarly, Thorndike, Watson, Skinner, Bandura, and the other psychol- ogists working in the behavioral tradition have not effected a Newtonian revolution in the study of human action. Indeed, the basic thesis of this paper has been that their essential contribution to knowledge-that is, the articulation and refinement of the law of effect-has helped to establish a Darwinian revolution in the social sciences. As Skinner himself (1965, p. 81) has stressed, "the law of effect is not a theory," meaning that it is not the sort of hypothetico-deductive system created by Newton. Behaviorists have not discovered any theoretical laws; they have not in any precise sense of the term discovered the cause of learning or socio- cultural selection. They advance no empirical principle which can be facile- ly invoked to explain the selection of a particular action pattern or idea. In a sense, their fundamental contribution, although useful, is even more mod- est than Darwin's. They have simply confirmed, through rigorous experi- mentation, what most people have always realized at least tacitly: the re- currence, proliferation, or extinction of a particular pattern of behavior or cognition is determined by its consequences. As Homans (1972, p. 696) has observed, "behavioral psychology . . . is an achievement in systematizing what men and women have long known intuitively and unsystematically." Everything Darwin knew about the relationship between the struggle for existence and natural selection was based on circumstantial evidence and probabilistic reasoning. In contrast to Darwin, today's social scientist has at his disposal causal knowledge about the selection process which is sup- ported by something more than circumstantial evidence and untested judg- ments. As Kunkel and Nagasawa (1973, pp. 532-34) relate, there are now "literally hundreds of studies" which show, on the basis of laboratory and field experiments using human subjects, that the recurrence or extinction of particular forms of behavior can be causally attributed to the consequences they produce (for reviews of a great many of these studies see Bandura 1969, 1977; Staats 1975). Although partially grounded on the bedrock of experimental knowledge, the behavioral theory of sociocultural evolution is, like the Darwinian sys- tem, a concatenated theory. It conceptually integrates but does not actually 298</page><page sequence="12">Darwinism and Sociocultural Evolution explain the plethora of empirical relationships known to connect certain phenomena-described as reinforcing or aversive stimuli-and the selection of modes of action and cognition. The behavioral theory, to put the case quite bluntly, cannot explain these relationships because behavioral psy- chology does not know yet why reinforcers and aversive stimuli have the effects they do. As Bandura stated not too long ago (1969, p. 223), "It is evident . . . that exceedingly diverse events which have no apparent com- mon properties can all serve a reinforcing function. A theory of reinforce- ment that adequately integrates these heterogeneous consequences into a [logically] unified system has yet to be formulated." NATURAL SELECTION Ultimately Darwin never obtained any empirical evidence which directly verified the existence of selection in nature. As B. J. Norton (1973) has shown, evidence of this sort was not actually procured until 1895, 13 years after Darwin's death, when W. F. R. Weldon succeeded in demonstrating that the selective destruction of sexually immature crabs in Plymouth Sound was causally related to variations in their "frontal breadth," a seem- ingly insignificant anatomical characteristic. Essentially, what Weldon found by means of an ingenious experiment was that narrower crabs were becoming more common in the sound because they were, compared with their thicker brethren, better able to tolerate the increasing amounts of waste material deposited in the waterway by the area's burgeoning pottery industry. Because Darwin lacked hard data of this kind, he was forced in the Origin to rest his case for the concept of natural selection on two other considerations: (a) its intellectual utility, that is, its capacity to make organic evolution comprehensible without a deus ex mackina; and (b) its inductive plausibility, that is, its reasonableness given the struggle for existence, variability in undomesticated species and all the facts associ- ated with artificial selection (i.e., the selective breeding of domesticated plants and animals). In the Origin (p. 81), Darwin defines natural selection as "[the] preser- vation of favourable variations and [the] rejection of injurious variations." Although ostensibly simple and straightforward, this conception of natural selection is, in actuality, analytically problematical. This becomes obvious as soon as an attempt is made to operationalize the terms favorable and in- jurious (or any of the others Darwin uses synonymously: advantageous, profitable, useful, good, bad). What is it precisely that makes a variation favorable or injurious? Or, to put it another way, what is it that makes a characteristic adaptive or maladaptive? Why are the antlers of the stag, the blubber of the walrus, 299</page><page sequence="13">American Journal of Sociology the nectar of the rose, and the opposable thumbs of the chimpanzee all properly classified as favorable or adaptive traits? What common property do these essentially heterogeneous phenomena share? The general answer offered by Darwin is, of course, that favorable variations are those which give their carriers an "edge" in the struggle for existence or for mates, while injurious variations are those which "handicap" their carriers in either of these struggles. Although highly suggestive, this answer is too broad to impart a rigorous operational meaning to the two terms under review. To accomplish this goal, Darwin's general answer must be refined, and this can be achieved by making his implicit understanding of these two adjec- tives explicit-that is, by defining favorable variations, on the one hand, as those which mitigate the effectiveness of one or more of the external forces acting to check the growth of a particular species and by defining injurious variations, on the other hand, as those which exacerbate the in- fluence of one or more of these forces. Note that using only these definitions it is not possible to identify a variation's status through a simple inspection of its structure and character. Nor is it possible to classify a variation as favorable or injurious simply because it happens, with the passage of gener- ations, to be spreading through or disappearing from a particular popula- tion. (Typically, however, the proliferation or disappearance of a variation is a good indication that it is, respectively, favorable or injurious.) To identify a variation as favorable or injurious with any certainty, an ob- server either must possess an omniscient understanding of the environment in which the variation exists or must know through direct experimentation or sophisticated observational techniques that the variation tends to be pre- served or destroyed because of the action of some particular environmental force. To grasp this point, think of a stag which happens to develop a set of antlers 'somewhat larger than those of other males in the species. Is this variation favorable or injurious? The answer is, of course-it all depends. It all depends on the environment in which it occurs. In the Darwinian system, favorable and injurious are relational terms. Variations are favor- able or injurious with respect to some set of environmental contingencies. Large antlers may allow the stag to defeat rivals in the struggle for mates, but at the same time they may perhaps slow the animal down, making it more vulnerable to large predators, or they may make it more attractive to human hunters. Or, finally, the enlarged set of antlers may prove to be neither an aid nor a handicap in the struggle for existence, in which case, Darwin implies (Origin, p. 81 ), it should be classified as a neutral variation. In the light of this interpretation of the concept, it can be said that natural selection is the term Darwin devised to illuminate a fundamental trend occurring in the biotic world. It refers, in fine, to the differential repli- 300</page><page sequence="14">Darwinism and Sociocultural Evolution cation of favorable and injurious variations or, as biologists now put it, the differential reproduction of genotypes. SOCIOCULTURAL SELECTION From a strictly analytical perspective, the existence of sociocultural selec- tion is not a particularly controversial issue. Very few social scientists, it seems safe to assume, would challenge, for example, Weber's (1968, p. 40) contention that "all changes of natural and social conditions have some sort of effect on the differential probabilities of survival of social relationships." Most, moreover, would undoubtedly concede that "anyone is at liberty to speak in such cases of a process of 'selection' of social relationships" and that "in every case it is necessary to inquire into the reasons which have led to a change in the chances of survival of one or another form of social action or social relationship, which have broken up a social relationship or permitted it to continue at the expense of other competing forms." Briefly put, the vast majority of social scientists would surely acknowledge that some sort of selection process occurs in sociocultural systems and deserves thorough study. What is highly controversial, however, is the claim that the selection process which takes place in the sociocultural realm is closely analogous to the one which occurs in the biotic world. Interestingly enough, although scholars from many disciplines, including anthropology, biology, and phi- losophy, have advanced and defended this claim, those who have questioned its validity and utility in recent years have been almost exclusively sociol- ogists. There has probably never been a more persuasive critic of theories of sociocultural evolution than Robert Nisbet. An erudite and remarkably elo- quent writer (see Nisbet 1967, 1969), he has managed to convince many of his colleagues (e.g., Wrong 1969) that an evolutionary perspective, Dar- winian or otherwise, has simply no place in the social sciences, that it does nothing but distort the true configuration of the phenomena studied by these disciplines. Yet, as careful analysis demonstrates (e.g., Lenski 1976), Nisbet's indictment of evolutionism is full of misconceptions, oversimplifi- cations, and outright substantive errors. When a scholar of Nisbet's stature declares (1969, p. 288) that "there is no historical evidence that macro-changes in time in [social structures] are the cumulative results of small-scale, linear micro-changes," one can only blink in disbelief, since examples which controvert this claim come so readily to mind. Macrochanges have occurred, for example, in the Roman Catholic church since the convening of the Second Vatican Council, but these changes did not come about instantaneously. They are the results of 301</page><page sequence="15">American Journal of Sociology a protracted selection process-the gradual elimination of age-old doctrines, rituals, and relationships and the institution of new practices and teach- ings.0 In the final analysis, there is no valid reason why sociocultural selection, or for that matter social change, cannot be defined in exactly the same way Darwin defined natural selection-as "the preservation of favorable vari- ations and the rejection of injurious variations." In the case of sociocul- tural selection, variations are, of course, cognitive and behavioral in form, and their favorable or injurious status depends on whether they aid or handicap individuals in the struggle for satisfaction or reinforcement. Less metaphorically, sociocultural selection can also be conceptualized as the differential "reproduction" of modes of action and thought within societies. SELECTION AND CHANGING ENVIRONMENTS The process of evolution involves more than the emergence and selection of variations. It also involves changes in the "status" of already established features of the system under investigation. Like their biological counter- parts, sociocultural patterns which are favorable at one time can become injurious (or vice versa), given an alteration in the structure of the envi- ronment in which they exist. For social scientists concerned with the evo- lution of sociocultural systems, determining why a once heavily reinforced and entrenched pattern of behavior or thought changes status and under- goes total or partial extinction is probably the most intriguing problem of all. There are at least five general reasons why the status of a sociocultural characteristic might change. First, it may be discovered that the trait was simply an instance of what Skinner (1965, pp. 85-87) calls "superstitious behavior," that the connection between the trait and the appearance of a reinforcer was purely coincidental. In other words, a widely practiced form of behavior, the rain dance, for example, may disappear from a sociocul- tural system if it is discovered that the behavior, although sporadically followed by reinforcement, does not actually cause the desired environmen- tal effect. (Conversely, behavior thought to be superstitious and accord- ingly near extinction may be revived if it is found to have reinforcing conse- quences which are unintended or hard to perceive.) Second, an ostensibly favorable variation may be found to harbor hidden 6 In this connection, it is interesting to note that Parsons (1977, pp. 6-7) has called attention to "the fact that the process of natural selection . . . is paralleled by the process many sociologists have come to call institutionalization; that is, the process by which items of variation, especially from cultural sources, either come to constitute established parts of later action systems, or fail to do so." 302</page><page sequence="16">Darwinism and Sociocultural Evolution costs, significantly outweighing its more overt rewards. (Conversely, an ostensibly unfavorable trait may be found to have unanticipated rewards exceeding its more overt costs.) The discovery of the link between the pre- servative sodium nitrite and the formation of carcinogenic nitrates could ultimately lead to the suppression of the practice of curing meats with this chemical, even though it retards the growth of botulism-causing bacteria. In this case, as in so many others, explaining specific instances of sociocul- tural selection involves a kind of cost-benefit analysis (see Homans [1974] for an "economic" interpretation of behavioral principles). The situation in biology, as I tried to indicate in a previous section, is quite similar. Ecol- ogists, who often are forced to explain the selection of some trait in light of its "costs and benefits," can without too much distortion be described as the economists of nature. Third, governments or other powerful social organizations may act to punish forms of behavior or thought which are either intrinsically rein- forcing or rewarded by competing social groups. The suppression of slavery in the United States or of the smoking of opium in China are classic exam- ples of status changes of this sort. (Conversely, governments and social or- ganizations can make otherwise unfavorable traits favorable by using rein- forcers at their command.) Naturally, the adoption and implementation of public policies which induce profound changes in the sociocultural environ- ment can themselves be explained within a behavioral-evolutionary frame- work, and, even more interesting, this framework can be used to account for the existence of government and indeed asymmetrical power relationships in general (for a study which moves in this direction see Corning [1974]). Fourth, a favorable trait may become unfavorable when it is determined to be less efficient or effective than an innovation which garners the same kind of reward. In this situation, the established behavior continues, in an objective sense, to be reinforced at its usual rate and cost but is neverthe- less discarded or abandoned because the innovation is discerned to produce the same reinforcer more predictably, at a greater rate, or at less cost. For example, a definite evolution or process of selection can be detected in the structure of the projectile points used by big-game hunters in the New World during the Pleistocene. Willey (1960, p. 118) accounts for this situ- ation by noting that "the Folsom fluted points display technical improve- ments over the earlier and somewhat less specialized Clovis forms. The Folsom point is widest just back of the piercing end, and the flutes or chan- nels on each side are longer and occupy a greater surface area of the imple- ment. Such features probably insured a more effective puncturing of the hide of the animal ... and more profuse bleeding. Thus a reasonable argu- ment can be made out for a progressive adaptive efficiency of the Folsom 303</page><page sequence="17">American Journal of Sociology point over the Clovis point." In short, Clovis points (and the practices in- volved in their manufacture) were not replaced because they no longer pro- duced reinforcement. They were replaced because the Folsom points were found to produce the reinforcement (the procurement of game) more pre- dictably, at a greater rate, and at less "cost" (i.e., with more profuse bleeding a struck animal does not run as far or as fast and thus trailing it is far less exhausting for the hunters). Efforts to devise forms of behavior which are, in this sense, ever more effective and efficient are part of what Weber ([1946] 1967, p. 295) described as the process of rationalization. It seems, however, that the "quest" for this sort of rationality is not simply a characteristic of Western civilization but a component of the "nature" of all higher animals. As Herrnstein (1970, p. 377) reports, "A review of the evidence for the law of effect would quickly reveal that the notion of 'stamping in' . . . does not suffice. Animals do not just repeat the first suc- cessful act, they are likely to improve upon it until they find something like the optimal performance. In Thorndike's puzzle, in the maze, or Skin- ner's operant conditioning chamber, animals tend toward faster, easier, and more congenial movements, unless the movements are virtually optimal to begin with...." Finally, a favorable trait may become unfavorable and undergo extinc- tion simply because it ceases to be reinforced. In some cases, this situation may occur through what can be called societal satiation. A fad, a type of dance, a form of art becomes widespread but then loses its appeal and gradually (or perhaps rapidly) disappears. In cases such as this, the "en- vironmental" change responsible for the trait's change in status takes place within the individuals concerned. Their "state variables" change (for an analysis of the role of state variables in behavioral explanations see Kunkel [1970]). Much more important is the situation in which a widely dispersed and heavily reinforced pattern of activity is "strangled" and eventually extermi- nated by new, more effective innovations. The struggle for satisfaction, like the struggle for existence, is often a matter of competition-a condition which obtains, according to Mayr (1963, p. 67), whenever two groups "seek simultaneously an essential resource of the environment. . . that is in limited supply." In both the biotic and sociocultural realms, new variations emerge which are so effective that they absorb, as they proliferate, more and more of a resource in limited supply. In the organic world, this means, among other things, that members of the species without the variation will even- tually disappear. In sociocultural systems, it means that certain established patterns of behavior and cognition will in time become totally "unfavor- able," that is, go completely unreinforced and undergo the well-known pro- cess of psychological extinction. Weber's explanation of the rationalization 304</page><page sequence="18">Darwinism and Sociocultural Evolution of Western capitalism rests heavily on selection dynamics of this sort.7 Ac- cording to Weber (1958, pp. 54-69), the Puritans and allied sects, even though comparatively few in number, contributed significantly to the trans- formation of various capitalistic societies because their calculated, method- ical, and yet innovative business practices were reinforced (in terms of sales and profits) at a rate which eventually made the more relaxed, traditional practices of their competitors completely unfavorable. Ultimately, to stay in business, Anglican, Catholic, and Lutheran entrepreneurs were forced to adopt the marketing and organizational techniques of their Puritan rivals. There can be no doubt that analyzing and explaining the intricacies of sociocultural selection is often an inordinately complex and demanding task, but, as I have tried to show, it is a task which the social sciences have the theoretical capacity to accomplish at least as well as Darwin accomplished the equally complex and demanding task of analyzing and explaining natu- ral selection. DISCUSSION The behavioral theory of sociocultural evolution outlined in the preceding pages appears to be open to four fundamental criticisms. Two concern its analytical structure, that is, they pertain to the Darwinian model of sys- temic adaptation; and two concern its explanatory power, that is, they per- tain to the behavioral principles of social learning, particularly the law of effect. In responding to each of these anticipated objections to the behav- ioral theory, I hope to clarify further some of its current features, to indi- cate its relationship to the descriptive and historical studies produced by the social sciences, and to suggest the probable path of its future develop- ment. First, it can be argued that the Darwinian model of systemic adaptation is too simple or too crude to capture even the underlying dynamics of the incredibly complex process of sociocultural evolution. The basic response to this charge parallels in a way the often repeated apothegm about democ- racy: it's a terrible form of government, but it's better than anything else that's been tried. As Campbell (1974, p. 142) puts it, . . . for all problems of fit, there is available today only one explanatory paradigm: blind variation and selective retention. In application, it de- scribes weak, tedious and improbable (albeit not impossible) mechanisms, quite out of proportion to the magnificent achievements to be explained. We believe in it because it describes a possible route, and because there are at present at least no rival explanatory theories . . . while natural selec- 7 The importance of the concept of selection in Weber's work has recently been ex- plored by Beetham (1974). Until the appearance of this study, Weber's reliance on the concept of selection was all but ignored. 305</page><page sequence="19">American Journal of Sociology tion and its analogues produce only puny, tedious and improbable expla- nations, we judge these to be the only ones available. If this makes these achievements seem unlikely, rare and precious, this is quite compatible with our awe. The blind variation and selective retention model of systemic evolution, it must be stressed, does not replace the need for all sorts of social and cul- tural concepts (e.g., patrimonial bureaucracy, nuclear family, political par- ty); indeed, the model demands, if it is to have any substance, continuous examination of social and cultural phenomena from a descriptive and his- torical perspective. The biologist obviously requires innumerable concepts beyond those in the Darwinian schema, and so does the social scientist. Second, it can be argued (Nisbet 1967, pp. 234-35) that the terms in the Darwinian model cannot be given an operational meaning in a sociocultural context, that in this realm they can never be anything but confusing meta- phors, which tend to obscure "really crucial data . .. in a vaporous haze." There is irony in this charge. Time and again, it has been argued that Darwin created his theory of organic evolution by recasting the doctrines of political economy and applying them to nature. According to this view, Darwin attempted to elucidate the character of the biotic world by showing, in a metaphorical way, that it functioned like a 19th-century capitalist so- ciety. Writing to Engels only three years after the publication of the Ori- gin, Marx himself found "it ... noteworthy that Darwin rediscovers among plants and animals his English society with its division of labor, compe- tition, opening up of new markets, 'inventions,' the Malthusian struggle for existence. It is Hobbes' bellum omanium contra omnes" (quoted in Bober 1965, pp. 37-38). How is it possible that the Darwinian system has been faulted for being too anthropomorphic when applied to nature and too bio- logical when applied to sociocultural reality? The answer to the question, I have tried to indicate, lies, in a sense, between these antinomous views- that is, the Darwinian model reveals fundamental analytical similarities be- tween the biological and sociocultural processes of evolution. Having read and reread Nisbet's argument, I still cannot understand what led him to the conclusion that the concepts of variation and selection cannot be given an operational meaning when applied to patterns of action and cognition. Take something as simple as the evolution of the serving motion in the game of tennis: when the game of tennis began, the serve was not a powerful, attacking stroke. It was simply a way of getting the ball in play, and it was accomplished by holding the racket up in front of the body and more or less "patting" the ball forward. American players like Tilden, Kramer, Schroeder, and Gonzales began the practice, however, of cocking the elbow and wrist, thereby permitting the racket head to drop down into a "backscratching" position. From this position, they were able 306</page><page sequence="20">Darwinism and Sociocultural Evolution to snap the racket forward with a powerful, accurate whipcord motion. Of course, this innovation had momentous effects on the flight and pace of the ball, and the practice quickly spread. I fail to see why the concepts of variation and selection could not be operationally defined in this case or in the case of behavioral evolution occurring in an institutional or organiza- tional context. In fact, I cannot understand why the terms variatidn and selection need to be considered metaphors at all. Third, it can be argued that the law of effect or the principle of rein- forcement "explains too much," that it ostensibly explains everything and therefore is an unfalsifiable proposition which actually explains nothing. As I suggested earlier, however, the law of effect is not in any rigorous sense a law. It is an inductive generalization which sums up what has been found so far to be the case: forms of action, behavioral as well as cognitive, tend to recur or disappear when they are followed by certain consequences. A specific assertion about the causal connection-or at least the empir- ical conjunction-between the occurrence of a particular event (conse- quence) and the recurrence or extinction of a discrete action is, of course, always testable in principle, just as it is always possible in principle to test an assertion about the causal connection between some factor in the strug- gle for existence and the selection of a particular biological trait. In prac- tice, specific behavioral propositions can often be tested in laboratories, in institutions using programs of behavior modification, and in everyday social relationships. But the global assumption that the fate of every action is de- termined by its environmental consequence(s) is no more testable or falsifi- able than the assumption of universal causality. Finally, it can be argued that the law of effect and, by extension, the be- havioral theory "explains too little," that it is not sufficiently "theoretical," that it does not do what theories are supposed to do (i.e., explain empirical generalizations). For social scientists (e.g., Levy 1975, p. 661) who believe that their disciplines "need a Newton," who "long for a person ... to come up with an elegant simplification that . . . organizes and simplifies and in- creases the power of all sorts of ragtail-bobtail theorems," the behavioral theory of sociocultural evolution as it now stands will be one more disap- pointment-or failure. There probably is no way to combat or change this perception. Pointing out that Darwin gave the biological sciences a para- digm even though he produced no "elegant simplification" will probably have little effect on those who await "Newton's second coming." The be- havioral theory, admittedly, does not do what Newton's theory did. But it does make the process of sociocultural evolution as comprehensible as Darwin's theory made the process of organic evolution. And one day it will do more, just as Darwin's theory did more once it was joined to Mendelian genetics. 307</page><page sequence="21">American Journal of Sociology The behavioral theory of sociocultural evolution is itself destined to evolve, empirically and "theoretically." At the empirical level, the theory will grow richer as social scientists continue to discover the relationships that exist between the struggle for reinforcement and sociocultural selec- tion. The theory, in other words, will expand substantively as social scien- tists formulate empirical explanations for the selection of current and past patterns of action and thought. At the "theoretical" level, the behavioral theory will be incalculably enriched when someone discovers why, from a physiological standpoint, reinforcers and aversive stimuli have the effects they do. As Skinner (1974, p. 215) has observed, "Something is done today which affects the behavior of an organism tomorrow. No matter how clearly that fact can be established, a step is missing, and we must wait for the physiologist to supply it. He will be able to show how an organism is changed when exposed to contingencies of reinforcement and why the changed organism then behaves in a different way, possibly at a much later date. What he discovers cannot invalidate the laws of a science of behavior, but it will make the picture of human action more nearly complete." REFERENCES Alland, Alexander, Jr. 1967.
