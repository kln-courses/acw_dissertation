<plain_text><page sequence="1">TOWARD A DEFINITION OF A PICTOGRAPH STYLE: THE LOWER PECOS BOLD LINE GEOMETRIC by Solveig A. Turpin ABSTRACT Abstract linear designs found at 14 sites surrrounding the confluence of the Pecos River and Rio Grande form the basis for the definition of a new pictograph style, the Lower Pecos Bold Line Geometric. Based on superim position and relative preservation, the geometries are relatively late in the long sequence of pictography in this region, following the fluorescence of the classic Pecos River style. Although some of the most elaborate designs are painted around the mouths of seep springs, no demonstrable interpretation of the majority of the sym bols is confirmed by the known distribution of various design elements. This definition of style should enable researchers to detect additional examples, leading to a more secure dating and providing a cultural context for the art. INTRODUCTION For over 50 years, researchers have at tempted to classify the diverse and elaborate Native American rock art of the Lower Pecos River region of southwest Texas into mean ingful cultural units (Kirkland 1938, 1939; Jackson 1938; Gebhard 1960,1965; Grieder 1965,1966a, 1966b; Kirkland and Newcomb 1967; Newcomb 1976; Turpin 1984, 1985). Although several typologies have been pro posed, only three prehistoric style designa tions have found general acceptance. In chronological order, these are the Pecos River, the Red Linear, and the Red Mono chrome. A fourth minor style, the Bold Line Geometric, can now be defined from picto graphs painted on the walls of 14 sites con centrated along the lower reaches of the Pecos River and surrounding its confluence with the Rio Grande (Fig. 1). ESTABLISHED PICTOGRAPH STYLES The Lower Pecos River region consists of flat arid stretches of thorny rangeland, fringed by rolling hills and dissected by entrenched tributaries to the three permanent water | MU VERDE COUNTY /* ? / Fig. 1. Distribution of known Bold Line Geometric sites. 153</page><page sequence="2">courses, the Rio Grande, the Devils River, and the Pecos River (Fig. 1). Rockshelters hollowed from the limestone walls of these canyons were the nucleus of an Archaic stage occupation that endured from the end of the Pleistocene until the Late Prehistoric period, about A.D. 600. The introduction of the bow and arrow after that time "presaged a quick ening of culture change, possibly population movements, and the end of the old tradition as such" (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967:40). The custom of wall painting, begun sometime during the Archaic, continued well into the Historic period, after A.D. 1600, but its form and meaning varied according to the func tions it performed and the cultural roots from which it sprung. The oldest and most famous of the Lower Pecos pictograph styles, the Pecos River style (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967; New comb 1976), was recognized by Jackson (1938) and Kirkland (1938, 1939) who attrib uted it to the Val Verde Dry Shelter culture. The central characters in this monumental polychrome art are elaborate anthropomor phic figures, often surrounded by smaller replicas or animal life. Although several inter pretations of the style have been proposed (Kirkland 1938, 1939; Gebhard 1960, 1965; Grieder 1965, 1966a; Kelley 1974; Kirkland and Newcomb 1967; Newcomb 1976), the consensus is that this art is the manifestation of a magico-religious or ideological system rooted in a shamanic tradition. Based on the consistent depiction of the atlatl, the absence of the bow and arrow, and associations with midden deposits (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967:41), the Pecos River style is assigned to the Archaic period, between 6000 B.C. and A.D. 600 in this region. Based solely on preservation, most researchers agree that the pictographs still visible today are probably no more than 4000 years old. The second defined pictograph style, the Red Linear, consists of miniature mono chrome stick figures engaged in animated group activity (Gebhard 1965; Kirkland and Newcomb 1967; Turpin 1984). Basically a representational style, the dominant themes are hunting, warfare, and fertility. Although Red Linear panels are relatively rare, the internal consistency in themes, attributes, and manner of execution suggests a fully devel oped style. Red Linear artists often incorpo rated natural features or older Pecos River style figures into their compositions, the lat ter providing evidence for their sequential age. A few scenes showing bison hunts sug gest that this style may date to the last docu mented prehistoric bison presence period in the region, between 3000 and 2000 years ago (Turpin 1984). The latest prehistoric style, the Red Monochrome, is dated to the Late Prehistoric period after A.D. 600, by the common rep resentation of the bow and arrow. These life size and lifelike murals consistently illustrate frontally posed human figures with distinctive characteristics such as protrusions around the ears and emphasized fingers and feet (Turpin 1986). Naturalistic animals abound in this style, the most realistic of the Lower Pecos prehistoric types. Several aboriginal pictographs of demon strably historic age can be attributed to the early Spanish era and the later influx of Apache and Comanche. Only a few of these paintings have been adequately described, however (Kirkland 1938, 1939; Jackson 1938). THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE BOLD LINE GEOMETRIC STYLE All the defined pictograph styles of the Lower Pecos include some geometric forms in their iconographic repertoire. In the Pecos River style, the polychrome geometries are usually soft undulating lines which convey a sense of rhythm and harmony, leading to their interpretation as serpents (Kirkland 1939:63) or water symbols (Greco 1984). When incor porated into larger shamanic compositions, these geometries impart a feeling of energy or power, emanating from the central char acters. The Red Linear geometries are looped or hatched lines, many of which seem to be obstacles placed in the path of game animals (Turpin 1984). The Red Monochrome in cludes fewer of these forms, usually con sisting of blocks of solid color or long zigzag lines. The latter bear the strongest pictograph resemblance to the design elements of the Bold Line Geometric style. The Bold Line Geometric patterns are also strikingly similar to those found on painted baskets and mats of the Lower Pecos Late Archaic, but since the technique of basketry limits the form of 154</page><page sequence="3">decoration, this similarity could be coinci dental. The Bold Line Geometric style relies upon an extremely limited iconographic vocabulary. The basic element is the straight line. By varying the angle at which these lines inter sect, the more complex patterns are created. Series of connected or interbedded V, X, Y, and Z shaped symbols form chevron, herring bone, and pennant designs, often contained within an outline in the same color (Fig. 2). Blank space becomes an important visual component in a more elaborate arrangement (Fig. 3) wherein the elemental straight lines are interwoven to form a blanket design (Kirkland 1938; Parsons 1966). Solid squares or diamonds may be outlined with parallel corresponding quadrilaterals so that blank space is incorporated as the straight line. Alternatively, the intersecting straight lines outline a grid of black diamond shapes. In a variation on this mode, solid blocks of color are used to create the internal shape of a geometric figure, giving the impression of a stenciled design (Fig. 3). However, the irreg ularities in size and angles indicate that no template was used. This use of blank space as an integral element sets the Bold Line Fig. 2. Examples of intersecting linear design elements: (a,b) 41W138; (c) 41W323; (d) 41W660; (e,f) 41W224. 155</page><page sequence="4">Fig. 3. Blanket and stencil designs characteristic of the Bold Line style: (a) 41W187; (b) 41VV650; (c) 41VV644. blanket pattern apart from all other Lower Pecos geometries. The third and final design characteristic of the Bold Line Geometric is a zoomorphic figure whose sharply bent limbs protrude from a globular body (Fig. 4). Usually, a series of zigzag lines extends to either side of this creature. The convention of showing the arms of human figures bent at the elbow is com mon in the Red Monochrome style, but the Red Monochrome figures are much more realistic (Gebhard 1960,1965). The Bold Line figures, ranging from 13 to 50 cm tall, are also Fig. 4. Anthropomorphic or zoomorphic figures of the Bold Line style: (a) 41W224; (b) 41VV234; (c) 41VV187. considerably smaller than many of the Red Monochrome figures, which can reach 150 cm in height. In 1965, Gebhard carried out a detailed study of the pictographs of Seminole Canyon and its immediate vicinity. Even in this limited sample, he was able to detect the distinct characteristics of the Bold Line Geometric style. Based largely on the now-inundated Rio Grande cliffs, 41W81, he distinguished what he called the Red Line style, a subset of his Late Red Figure style. Some circular designs were included in his description, but the major 156</page><page sequence="5">elements are the angular, linear designs of the Bold Line Geometric style. The larger sample now available makes the term Red somewhat misleading as various shades of purple, red, and yellow have been found. I have therefore substituted the name Bold Line to include all the pictographs of this type and to avoid confusion between the Red Linear and Red Line styles. The Bold Line Geometric style is also distinguished from the multitude of geometric forms in the other Lower Pecos styles by the thickness of the line and the glossy, dense application of solid-colored pigment, hence the descriptor "bold." One avenue of profit able research would be to determine if the paint or binder has been specially treated to produce the glossy sheen of these picto graphs. THE SITES Fourteen sites are included in this initial attempt to define the Bold Line Geometric style (Table 1). Eight sites were copied by the noted Texas water colorist Forrest Kirkland in the 1930s, and five of those were included by Jackson (1938). These sites and three additional examples were formally recorded during the pre-impoundment studies between 1958 and 1968. Two panels, 41VV81 and 41W200, are now inundated and undoubted ly dissolved, so they have been included in this style solely on the basis of prior docu mentation. Three sites were newly recorded in 1984 and 1985 during an intensive picto graph study carried out by the University of Texas and sponsored by the Kleberg Foun dation of San Antonio, Texas. 41VV18 ? A series of four alcoves over looking the now-impounded lower Devils River contain pictographs clearly visible from Lake Amistad. The lower shelter is dominated by a large panther and shaman figures in the Pecos River style; the upper is marked by parallel zigzag lines and pennants, one of which is enclosed within a rectangular outline. This site was photographed by Jackson (1938:Site 99) and recorded by Graham and Davis (1958). 41VV79 ? Hanging or No Goat Cave was so named for its inaccessibility, high on the wall of Painted Canyon, a tributary to the Rio Grande beneath the mouth of the Pecos River. A few hundred meters up canyon, the largest extant panel in the Red Monochrome style, 41VV78, extends around an overhang above a pool of permanent water. The main characters in 41VV79 are two deer and two human figures in the Pecos River style but the upper end is a blanket design, similar to figure 3a but enclosed within a rectangle. Kirkland (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967:70) commented that the majority of the designs, presumably including the blanket design, were dimmer than the brightest red shaman and deer, but Table 1.

Parida Cave, 41VV187. 41VV81 ? Rio Grande Cliffs, now inun dated by Lake Amistad, was an extremely large and complex series of pictographs of varied styles. Towering Pecos River shamans stood in marked contrast to miniature animals and humans of later date (Gebhard 1965). Gebhard (1965), who largely defined his Red Line style at this site, clearly considered the angular geometries among the latest art works, citing superimpositions and their loca tion above the present .ground level on an eroded surface. Bold Line motifs included zigzags, Xs, rectangles, and branched ver tical lines. A seep spring flowed from the base of the cliff, and extensive midden deposits, noted by earlier researchers, had been buried or eroded by the time Graham and Davis (1958) and Gebhard (1965) recorded the site. 41VV136 ? Sloppily painted red and yellow zigzags sprawl across the wall of a small shelter high above the Pecos River. These geometries are much more carelessly drawn than the classic Bold Line motifs. Blotches above and below the zigzags may be handprints (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967: 70), a common characteristic of the Red Monochrome style. 41VV138 ? Just upstream of 41VV136, overlooking the Pecos River, four sets of parallel zigzag lines, alternating red and yellow (Fig. 2a, b), have been painted over faded Pecos River style figures. These large designs are clearly visible from the river. 41VV165 ? This shelter near Langtry lies in Mile Canyon just above its confluence with the Rio Grande, above a permanent spring now drowned by Lake Amistad. The majority of the dim designs are Pecos River style, dominated by curvilinear geometries and shaman figures. Grieder (1966b: 15) consid ered smaller Bold Line Geometric style picto graphs, straight lines intersecting to form a star and connected rectangles, as late in the sequence of wall painting because of their position low on the wall, over eroded rem nants of other styles. 41VV187 ? Parida or Painted Cave is an enormous shelter fronting on Lake Amistad just below the mouth of the Pecos River. A favored camping spot for boaters, the shelter is largely painted with Pecos River style pic tographs now marred by graffiti. Just below an elaborate Pecos River geometric and above the travertined column of an active seep spring are a yellow and red Bold Line blanket design (Fig. 3a) and a zoomorph with zigzag extensions (Fig. 4c). Careful inspec tion of the juncture between the two styles shows a perfect abutment with no overlap to indicate which was painted first. 41W200 ? Railroad Tunnel Shelter, a Pecos River style site on the Rio Grande below the mouth of the Pecos River, is now inundated by Lake Amistad. Zigzag lines and adjoining nested diamonds appear from prior documentation to conform to the Bold Line characteristics. 41W224 ? Immediately above Parida Cave, this site, often called Parida II, could stand as the type site for two of the Bold Line design motifs. Red geometries include nu merous variations on the intersecting straight lines (Fig. 2e, f), at least five of the charac teristic zoomorphs, and one possible painted pebble design. Two compositions offer one explanation for some of the Bold Line zoo morphs. In one, two globular beings flank a cross-hatched geometric which looks very much like a net or web. One of these has six legs and bulging eyes, suggesting it is meant to represent an insect; the other is a typical quadrapedal figure (Fig. 2f). Another single figure, some 50 cm tall, is also insectlike, with paired upper appendages and a distended abdomen reminiscent of a spider with an egg sac. This shelter, with equally unusual Pecos River style figures, ranks among the under rated sites of the region, perhaps because it has remained unpublished since 1938 (Jack son 1938:72; Parsons 1966). 41W234 ? Three characteristic Bold Line zoomorphs flanked by zigzags or chevrons were painted on the side of a large block of roof fall in a shelter high above the Pecos River (Fig. 4b). On the upper curve of the rear wall, just above the present surface, a rem nant of a blanket design is almost obscured by calcite coating and spalling. 41W323 ? This small shelter high on the Pecos across from 41VV136 and 41VV138 is marked by two purplish parallel zigzags with short lines appended to the lower course and ending in renditions of hands (Fig. 2d). 41W644 ? One stencillike figure (Fig. 3c) 158</page><page sequence="7">was painted under a shallow overhang above an occupied shelter in a small tributary to the Rio Grande above the mouth of the Pecos River. Red diamonds with blank centers con nect to form a semblance of a human figure. A red inverted W is above the left edge of this figure. 41VV650 ? A confusing mass of red in tersecting lines surrounds the mouth of a small seep spring in a low-lying shelter in the tributary to the Rio Grande immediately above the 41VV644 canyon. The blanket design in this site (Fig. 3b), like that of 41W224, is formed of solid red diamonds framed by a line. Although the site has been flushed of cultural debris, a hollow in the bedrock about 1 m above the floor was apparently used much like an oven, and a second shelter directly above retains considerable occupa tional material. 41VV660 ? The now-abandoned railroad bed traverses the debris cone of this large shelter, the Brite site, just below Amistad Dam on the Rio Grande. The only style represented is Bold Line; an extensive panel of nested variations on the intersecting straight lines (Fig. 2d) is coated with calcite and eroded, but the coherence of the design suggests it was the product of a single event. Other sites, some illustrated by Kirkland (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967:Plates 32.3,41, 42) may also hold designs in this style (Geb hard 1965). These sites must be reassessed to determine if their design elements fit within the definition offered here. SPATIAL AND CHRONOLOGICAL DISTRIBUTION The distribution of the 14 Bold Line Geo metric pictographs illustrated in Figure 1 is undoubtedly partially a function of intensive survey in the areas to be inundated by Ami stad Reservoir. However, recent survey of large tracts on the Devils River above Lake Amistad produced several Pecos River, Red Linear, and Red Monochrome sites, but no additional samples of Bold Line Geometric were found. I have suggested previously that the Red Monochrome pictographs, the style which most closely resembles the Bold Line Geo metric, are generally found under shallow overhangs and not in the true sheltered en vironment favored by the Pecos River style artists (Turpin 1986). The Bold Line Geo metric follows the Pecos River style pattern with only a few instances of exposed art work. This apparent preference for shelter surfaces gives the best clue to the age of the Bold Line Geometric. In every case where the Pecos River and Bold Line styles conflict, the geo metries are superimposed. The Red Linear and Bold Line styles have yet to be found in the same site. Intrasite distribution supports a relatively recent age for the geometric pictographs. All the extant paintings in this style are located in still accessible locations, as though ex ecuted from a level approaching the current ground surface. Earlier styles, such as the Pecos River and Red Linear pictographs, are often now far above reach. Although some of these were probably painted from artificial supports such as ladders, in many instances they originated from former floors now flushed from the shelters. The Bold Line designs are often painted on the eroded walls exposed beneath the traces of these more ancient sur faces (Grieder 1966b: 16; Gebhard 1965). Based on relative clarity, superimposition, and location, Grieder (1966b) and Gebhard (1965) placed the abstract geometric signs late in the sequence of wall painting in the shelters they studied. In Gebhard's (1965:38) opinion, his Red Line style verged on proto historic in age and "would appear to repre sent the intrusion of a new style into the area rather than a style which developed out of an earlier indigenous model." The attempt to relate the Bold Line Geo metric style to external influences is ham pered by the wide distribution of similar ab stract symbols. Geometric designs abound in pictographs west and south of the mouth of the Pecos (Lowrance 1982, personal com munication 1984; Apostolides, personal com munication 1984). Parallels between the Chi huahua Abstract Polychromes of the Greater Southwest (Schaafsma 1982) and the pre dominant style in the Saltillo-Monterrey region of northern Mexico are striking, but the ubiq uitous nature of angular geometries casts doubt on any generic relationships. The five regions listed by Grant (1967:150) as noted for abstract linear designs encompass most of North America. 159</page><page sequence="8">INTERPRETATION OF BOLD LINE GEOMETRIC By its very abstract nature, the Bold Line Geometric offers unlimited interpretive op tions to the imaginative. Jackson (1938:232) saw resemblances to the California puberty designs described by Steward (1929), New comb (personal communication 1985) sug gested that some abstractions may be group signifiers or markers of special resources, and Parsons (1966) compared the zigzag pattern to southwestern rain and cloud symbolism. The one tantalizing clue offered by their con text is the positioning of the two largest blanket designs around the mouths of seep springs within rockshelters (41VV187, 41W650). A third, 41W234, is so eroded and coated with calcite that past water seepage must be suspected. Graham and Davis (1958) and Gebhard (1965) also report seeing a seep spring at the base of the Rio Grande Cliffs, 41W81, but its relationship to the pictographs is unclear. Sites 41W79 and 41W165 are in shelters adjacent to larger springs. The other recorded Bold Line patterns have no demon strable proximity to water other than their overall riverfront locations. Two of the zoomorphic figures at 41W224 are apparently intended to portray insects. The remainder, however, clearly have only four limbs. As the human knee is incapable of bending at the angle shown on these figures, they are presumably animal, but the current sample permits little speculation on the species depicted. Indeed, the arbitrary nature of meanings attached to such abstract symbols suggests it is more profitable to view them in terms of their overall role in the regional cultural system than to strive for literal translations. At present, the wisest course is to more clearly define the regional extent of the Bold Line Geometric, using its unique attributes, angular linear designs, unusual zoomorphic figures, and blanket designs to distinguish it from other abstract pictographs. Once these geometric forms are recognized as a distinct style, additional recordings will enlarge the sample, optimizing the chances to detect superimpositions, determine a relative age, and establish a cultural context for the picto graphs. Attempts to interpret the style can then proceed from a more secure base in the culture history of the region, and the art, in turn, will illustrate cultural processes not manifested in the more mundane aspects of subsistence and technology. CONCLUSIONS The Bold Line Geometric is a minor style in terms of the long and varied sequence of wall painting in the Lower Pecos River region. Its stark simplicity offers few clues to the artist's intent, yet this monotonous repetition of abstract symbols implies encoded, shared information. At this point, however, no ready interpretation can be found in the form, con tent, or context of the paintings. Based on superimposition and relative preservation, the Bold Line Geometric is ap parently later than the Pecos River style but, based on broad stylistic affinities, may be coeval or closely aligned with the Late Pre historic Red Monochrome. Until such time as this sequence can be refined, the best possi ble estimate of the age of the Bold Line Geo metric is Late Archaic to protohistoric, after A.D. 200 in this region. As research progresses and more of the diverse pictographs of this region can be categorized, more meaningful cultural impli cations will hopefully emerge. At present, the definition of the Bold Line Geometric style serves its most useful purpose by demon strating the variability in art styles during the later phases of Lower Pecos prehistory. Suc cessful adaptation in the realms of subsis tence and technology, as demonstrated by the long, continuous occupation of these arid lands, need not imply a stagnant nor sterile ideological life. The proliferation of art styles during the last 3000 years of prehistory in this region reflects a cultural complexity that must be incorporated into future models of Lower Pecos adaptation.
