<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Minotaur's Revolution: On Animals and Politics Effie Rentzou MINOTAURE, THE LAVISH ART, LITERATURE, and culture mag azine published by Albert Skira with Tériade as its initial director, appeared in 1933 and produced its last issue, numbered 12-13, in 1939. While Minotaure did not start as a Surrealist publication, it was soon taken over by the Surrealist group. Precisely because it was not an exclusive Surrealist organ, the movement's overt political views and positions seemed to remain outside its pages, following the explicit desire of Skira.1 In this respect, Minotaure was diametrically opposed to the movement's magazine that immediately preceded it, Le Surréalisme au service de la révolution,2 which, in a very austere presentation that left little place for illustrations and the visual arts, deployed in its six issues from 1930 to 1933 a political posi tion subordinated to the French Communist Party and the directives of the Third International.3 This magazine, along with La Révolution surréaliste (1924-1929), framed the first ten years of the movement's existence within a rhetoric of revolution, announced in the titles and recalled in every issue. This rhetoric seemed to be abruptly discontinued when the Surrealists opted to coa lesce behind a magazine whose title invoked a mythical Greek monster, half bull and half-man. Is it, however, plausible to accept that during a period marked by heightened political activity—albeit outside the realm of the Com munist Party—the Surrealists abandoned all political aspiration within the magazine that they espoused? Is their disappointment over the Communist party and ensuing estrangement from it a sufficient explanation for their turn to an 'apolitical' forum, in which benign references to zoomorphic myths replaced the hope for a universal and generalized political revolution? In other words, within a movement that was remarkably consistent and continuous for all its diversity, is there a link between the revolutions announced in the 1920s and the hybrid animal-man of the 1930s? From the first issue of Minotaure the editors made clear that the new mag azine aspired to play an important role in the world of art and culture: Minotaure publiera, le premier, la production d'artistes dont l'œuvre est d'intérêt universel. [...] C'est-à-dire que Minotaure affirmera sa volonté de retrouver, de réunir et de résumer des élé ments qui ont constitué l'esprit du mouvement moderne pour en étendre le rayonnement, et il s'attachera, grâce à un essai de mise au point de caractère encyclopédique, à désencombrer le terrain artistique pour redonner à l'art en mouvement son essor universel.4 &gt; L'Esprit Créateur, Vol. 51, No. 4 (2011), pp. 58-72</page><page sequence="2">Effie Rentzou The magazine hoped to establish a universal sphere for artists and their work, a recurring theme in the magazine. This universal claim was repeated in the editorial of issue number five of 1934, in which the universal, the entire world, and the countries in which Minotaure circulated were conflated: Les journaux, les revues du monde entier consacrèrent des articles importants à l'activité de Minotaure et qui prouvent l'intérêt suscité par la revue auprès de l'élite de tous les pays où elle a pu déjà pénétrer. Ces encouragements nous confirment aujourd'hui dans notre volonté de créer un organe universel, vraiment moderne pour traiter sérieusement et aussi avec cohésion toutes les questions culturelles présentes.5 It was by making the world only as large as their own reach, and thus ensur ing that they cover it all, that they effectively, if perversely, asserted the real ization of the magazine's aspirations. Furthermore, to be truly modern is also to be genuinely universal; both qualities, modernity and universality, were, according to the editors, what made the magazine relevant. These two qualities were also embodied in the title of the magazine, along with a certain degree of violence. "La revue à tête de bête," as it was described in the editorial "Éternité de Minotaure," "se distingue de toute autre publica tion à tête de membre de l'Institut ou de conservateur de musée."6 Minotaure set itself apart from other publications by decapitating the intellectual, the aca demic or the museum curator in a gesture that recalls the beheadings of "la Ter reur," and by replacing Enlightenment authority with the head of the beast.7 The title, as yet another editorial declared, was also a call to reveal what lay hidden, but permanent and unaltered, under the contingency of an era: En présence d'une actualité de jour en jour de plus en plus dévorante et tout compte tenu des formes de notre périodicité nous croyons pouvoir dire que, fidèle à son titre même, Minotaure s'est proposé d'absorber et de dépasser en ce qu'elle a de toujours épisodique, cette actualité. [...] Nous nous réclamons de cette opinion qu'on ne peut faire œuvre d'art ni même en dernière analyse, œuvre utile en s'attachant à n'exprimer que le contenu manifeste d'une époque et que ce qu'importe par dessus tout est l'expression de son CONTENU LATENT.8 The figure of the Minotaur was then understood as an opposition to and attack on the merely academic and intellectual, as well as a token of permanence and as a promise of universal meanings concealed under the manifest content of reality. The title, proposed by Roger Vitrac9 or alternatively by Georges Bataille and André Masson (Pierre 97-98), referred directly to the Minoan mytho logical cycle, showing a generalized fascination with the half-man, half-bull monster, a fascination materialized on the magazine's covers. Each one of Vol. 51, No. 4 59</page><page sequence="3">L'Esprit Créateur these covers was an interpretation of the Minotaur by a prominent artist: Picasso, Duchamp, Ernst, Dali, Magritte and Derain are some of the artists who created a cover especially for the magazine.10 The theme of the Minotaur was persistent in and around Surrealism: one has to think only of Picasso's series of Minotaurs, of André Masson's relevant paintings (Minotaure in 1935, Le Labyrinthe and Le Rêve d'Ariane in 1938), of the Ariadne series by Giorgio de Chirico ( 1913) or the anthropomorphic Minotaure of Man Ray that graces the contents page of the seventh issue of Minotaure (Figure 2). In the wider culture of the time, interest in the Cretan mythological cycle was prob ably spurred by the publication of the excavation of Knossos by Sir Arthur Evans between 1921 and 1936, which received considerable attention," including from magazines influential in the formation of a modern canon such as Cahiers d'art.n This interest was an instance of a fertile intersection between archaeology and modernism, an intersection that has been generally described as the search for "an other (and even othering) archaeology loosely affiliated both with Freud's tracking of subterranean psychic and somatic intensities, and with an ongoing modern preoccupation [...] with tapping into 'prehistoric' instinctualisms, violence, savagery, sacrifice and sacrality." This modernist archeology "unburies life forms resistant to or hostile to Culture and Civilization."13 During the 1920s and 1930s, magazines like Cahiers d'art and Documents, together with Minotaure, pursued this type of "mod ernist archaeology," consolidating its connection with ethnography and anthropology in the search for human origins.14 A sample of this perspective appears in the first issue of Minotaure, with an article on the archaic temple of Artemis in Corfu from the 6th century B.C.E. In the article, early Greek art is described as essentially barbarian and oriental: Lorsque cet art fut découvert à nouveau par ceux dont les yeux avaient appris à regarder les œuvres des peuples primitifs, ce fut une nouvelle époque de cet art qui sut retenir l'attention de tous: ces débuts décriés comme "barbares" [...]. Contre la supposition primitive d'un art grec parfaitement original ou légèrement influencé par l'Egypte, s'impose de plus en plus l'idée que ses sources doivent être recherchées dans le proche Orient.1'' The effect of such comments is to turn Greece away from its humanist, Euro pean identity, to make it Oriental. In this gesture 'Greece' becomes its other, and the epitome of culture and civilization shades over into barbarism. Archaeology here definitely functions as the "fille parricide de l'humanisme," as Georges Henri Rivière put it aphoristically in an earlier publication in Cahiers d'art,16 "Humanism" in this case would be the original Greek view of a harmonious 60 Winter 2011</page><page sequence="4">Effie Rentzou human, very far removed from a barbarian primitivism. But "humanism" should also be understood as that which connects classical Greece on one end with the authority of the intellectual and the museum curator on the other—against whom stands Minotaure. It is this version of humanism that is put to death by the barbarian, oriental figures on archaic temples, as well as by setting an animal head on the shoulders of the cultured man. Archaeology and the figure of the Minotaur share an appeal to violence as they bring to the surface what has lain latent beneath, what has stubbornly survived from the past, material remnants or hidden monsters that modify idealist perceptions of antiquity or of humanity. Like archaeology, the Minotaur seems to unveil hidden aspects of 'Greece': a Greece invested in animality, a Greece in which the human, the center of Hel lenic civilization, is displaced and replaced by a hybrid creature. This is also the direction in which a comment by Pierre Mabille in the sixth issue of Minotaure points: "Ce sont les vieilles couches gréco-asiatiques qui reparaissent après un long séjour dans l'inconscient." And he adds in the form of a footnote: "Il y a certainement des phénomènes d'hérédité encore plus éloignée, qui remontent le cours des âges. Ressortent actuellement des tendances et des formes datant de l'homme avant l'ère historique. Signalons qu'on n'écrit pas au hasard dans Minotaure. Ce nom même est assez caractéristique."17 Indeed, the universality to which the magazine aspired was to be found, as the editors clearly noted, emblematically in its title. It is through this univer salism performed by Minotaure that humanist Greece, a code word for logos and culture, a synonym for the homo universalis and for humanist univer sality, is reversed. By designating the Minotaur as a symbol of universality, a different Greece is evoked, an imaginary space in which the human and the non-human, man and animal, meet and release unpredictable and uncontrol lable energies. The meeting of human and animal persists throughout the mag azine "à tête de bête" in which animals abound: from the bulls and Minotaurs of Picasso18 and the Abyssinian sacrificial bull described by Michel Leiris fol lowing the Dakar-Djibouti ethnographic mission,19 to the famous praying mantis of Roger Caillois20; from King Kong21 to monkeys described as "le plus homme des singes, le plus singe des hommes" in the article "Analyse spectrale du singe"22; from nocturnal birds23 to Brassai's moths,24 from frogs25 to Benjamin Péret's dogs and wolves26 and to Pierre Mabille's superimposed "ver, reptile, batracien, poisson, oiseau, mammifère à cornes, homme" (Mabille 2) (Figure 1). The constant presence of animals resonates with the title, but goes beyond symbolic, mythological or anthropomorphic uses of the animal.

The gen eral approach in the articles found in Minotaure, however, defies symbolisms and anthropomorphism, while approaching the animal not as the "other" or the opposite of the human, but as a continuation of the human. When Armand Petitjean's "Analyse spectrale du singe," for instance, discusses simian mim icry or the hierarchy between human and animal, the notion of model and its imitation is blurred: "Et voici notre vieille connaissance que nous ne remet tons jamais, le Grand Singe pithécanthrope anthropopithèque et anthropoïde, le plus homme des singes, le plus singe des hommes en pleine possession de nous dans l'absence de soi" (Petitjean 58). In a better known example, Roger Caillois in his 1934 article "La Mante religieuse: de la biologie à la psych analyse" claims that the major complexes discovered and explored by psy choanalysis, such as the Oedipus complex or castration anxiety, can be better understood within the frame of what he calls a "comparative biology": "Peut être y aurait-il avantage à demander leur origine à la biologie comparée plutôt qu'à la seule conscience humaine" (Caillois 26). The appeal to extend psy chology and psycho-analysis outside human consciousness towards a com parative biology of all living beings may or may not foreshadow contempo rary developments in neuroscience, but certainly proposes an eccentric consideration of the human and his humanity. Automata, mannequins, and the mechanical in general have been exten sively studied within Surrealism, and in Minotaure in particular, as an alter native examination of the human at a time of increased consciousness of cap italist and industrialist reification.28 Gestures to the animal, however, open a different space for consideration of the human or the post-human. Beyond usual readings of modernist and avant-garde anxiety before a rapidly chang ing mechanized world, the obsessive reference to animals upsets deeper seated assumptions about the human. While the opposition human-machine is paradigmatic for the modern industrial era and practically appears with it, the human-animal coupling has a long history during which its two poles have shifted in different positions. Minotaure takes a stance in this centuries-long Vol. 51, No. 4 63</page><page sequence="7">L'Esprit Créateur confrontation by adopting a hybrid symbol of universality that combines the two parts of the dyad. Against a Protagorean centrality of the human in the universe as the measure of all things, Minotaure chooses to blur the line between human and non-human, human and animal, thus asking us to recon sider the notion of the human altogether, and with it the notion of humanism. The Surrealists accomplish in fact a virtuoso gesture: while on the image of Greece, a solid base of humanism, a universal worldview had been built around the centrality of the human, the Surrealists manage to retool our cul tural experience of ourselves through the very same image so as to actuate a non-anthropocentric consideration of the human. This gesture gains in signif icance when set against the reactionary, nationalist, and fascist associations that classical antiquity acquired during the 1930s. By contrast, Minotaure deploys Greece as a metonymy for a new conception of the universal in which the animal is in the human and the human in the animal. This operation is best captured in the last editorial of the magazine, written probably by André Breton and with the telling title "Éternité de Mino taure," in which a movement of double negation is described: [La revue] se fait de l'événement artistique, intellectuel une conception À REBOURS DE TOUTES LES CONCEPTIONS RÉTROGRADES. [...] Devant la faillite incontestée du rationalisme, [...] la solution vitale n'est pas le recul mais l'avance VERS LES NOUVEAUX TERRITOIRES. Ces territoires, notre ambition a été de les désigner, de les définir. Notre rôle est à tout prix de maintenir, de continuer à améliorer cette position. ("Éternité," page not numbered) The image of going backwards from the retrograde in order to advance—an apophatic way of describing the avant-garde, that which goes forward—cre ates a sinuous line that recalls ancient boustrophedonic script: changing direc tion, back and forth, like oxen plowing a field, seems to be the operational mode of the magazine. It is not only the intellectual and artistic event that is addressed by flipping the retrograde on its head, but also the history of ideas and the immediate heritage of rationalism. The retrograde conception of a rationalist humanity, represented in its most concise form by the luminous humanist Greece, is overturned to reveal a Minotaur. At this point the initial question about the political relevance of Mino taure reasserts itself: does the Surrealists' gesture go beyond a simple cul tural critique, or a general Freudian discovery (and Lacanian elaboration) of the dark and violent side of the human in the deepest parts of the psyche? Do the Surrealists transcend a Minoan trend that cuts across modernist aesthet ics, from James Joyce's Stephen Daedalus to Giorgio de Chirico's sleep ing Ariadne? A movement backwards to the first official Surrealist magazine, 64 Winter 2011</page><page sequence="8">Effie Rentzou La Révolution surréaliste, may offer an appropriate interpretative framework for understanding the project of Minotaure. La Révolution surréaliste began publication on December 1st, 1924, and it printed its last issue five years later. It was the first magazine to display in its title the identity of Surrealism, a movement that had only just defined itself in the Manifeste du surréalisme published earlier that same year. Already by its title, La Révolution surréaliste is positioned as the organ of the revolution to come, a revolution that in the magazine takes aim at various institutions and values, from the Pope to the University. Amongst the most prominent targets are patriotism and the nation, while Europe stands as the quintessential expression of what Sur realism stands against.29 A short anonymous article titled "Europe" asks, "Europe exsangue, reine d'une bourgeoisie cadavre et de prolétariats abâtardis, que peux-tu nous offrir ?"30 The partial answer to this rhetorical question is: "Nous n'avons plus qu'un espoir: de lointaines coulées de peuples barbares sur le cadavre décomposé de l'Occident." This appeal to the barbarians as the only possible agents of radical revo lution resonates throughout the magazine, and especially so in the collective declaration "La révolution d'abord et toujours !" that appeared in the fifth issue of October 1925. Here, in a rage against patriotism and nationalism, Western civilization in general and capitalism in particular are presented as an attack on human dignity: "Partout où règne la civilisation occidentale toutes attaches humaines ont cessé à l'exception de celles qui avaient pour raison d'être l'intérêt, 'le dur paiement au comptant.' Depuis plus d'un siècle la dignité humaine est ravalée au rang de valeur d'échange."31 In a surprising twist to the Marxian trope, the text goes on to declare: "Nous sommes cer tainement des barbares puisqu'une certaine forme de civilisation nous écœure." This saving barbarism is regularly sought in Asia; André Breton writes in the article "Lettre aux voyantes:" "C'est notre rejet de toute loi con sentie; notre espoir en des forces neuves, souterraines et capables de bous culer l'Histoire, de rompre l'enchaînement dérisoire de ces faits, qui nous fait tourner les yeux vers l'Asie."32 However, Breton quickly makes clear that this "Asia" is "everywhere": L'Orient est partout. Il représente le conflit de la métaphysique et de ses ennemis, lesquels sont les ennemis de la liberté et de la contemplation. En Europe même qui peut dire où n'est pas l'Orient ? Dans la rue, l'homme que vous croisez le porte en lui : l'Orient est dans sa conscience. (Breton, "Lettre" 21 ) The Orient then becomes an imaginary, virtual space, created for and by the revolution to come. This space is opposed by its barbarism to Europe and Vol. 51, No. 4 65</page><page sequence="9">L'Esprit Créateur to the civilization and values of the West. The imaginary and stereotypical nature of the Orient is not downplayed by the Surrealists, who are very con scious of their use of the topos. In the seminal article "Légitime défense," André Breton reacts to stereotypical deployments, by the likes of Charles Maurras, of the Orient as a force destructive of Western civilization, asking, "Pourquoi, dans ces conditions, ne continuerions-nous pas à nous réclamer de l'Orient, voire du 'pseudo-Orient' auquel le surréalisme consent à n'être qu'un hommage, comme l'œil se penche sur la perle ?"33 Denis Hollier rightly notes that this use of the Orient as a reverse orientalist trope establishes a binary that is almost void of content: "The imposition of the East versus West binary model onto the experience of alterity evacuates its concrete content. Alterity here is constructed on the basis of a mere rotation, a mere reversal, or a negative print."34 This logic of the negative print is also applicable to the opposition of the civilized and the barbarian as it is evoked by Robert Desnos in his 1925 "Description d'une révolte prochaine": "Qui dit civilisés dit anciens barbares, c'est-à-dire bâtards des aventuriers de la nuit, c'est-à-dire ceux que l'ennemi (Romains, Grecs) corrompit."35 The barbarian ceases to be simply the other or the foreign, becoming instead he who has been specifically corrupted by Rome and Greece; the barbarian represents the other side of what the civilized have done. In this way, just as the Orient stands against Europe, the barbarian stands against the Greek. Moreover, just as the Orient survives within the con sciousness of the European, the barbarian still lives within the civilized. This is the foundation, beyond its Marxist and leftist political rhetoric, of the inter nationalist revolutionary position held by Surrealism. It is centered by an imaginary Orient, an anti-Europe and finally an anti-Greece, each of which stands in its amorphous homogeneity as metonymy for universal upheaval and revolt. Already in the 1920s this position was deemed to be at the best idealist and at the worst naïve and even dangerous, without any real political heft;36 the attack on the West and the cult of barbarism, however, goes beyond any simplistic critique of capitalism, and it certainly goes beyond the creation of a new social and political 'myth.' It aims rather at the heart of a humanist tradition that places a Greek perception of the human at its center, thus cre ating the hierarchies and cleavages that lie at the foundation of Western hegemony in the world. It is now clear that those elements laid out in La Révolution surréaliste in an unambiguously political frame as parts of a crucial equation for a revolt-— Greece and its others, civilization and barbarism—are also at play in Mino taure. Any exact parallelism between the constitutive elements of these two 66 Winter 2011</page><page sequence="10">Effie Rentzou magazines would depend on an analogy between the animal and the barbar ian, a comparison that is as old as the Greeks.37 Without going deep into such an analogy, it should suffice for the moment to consider the third term that connects the two—the human—referring at once to an object of biology and an object of culture. It is precisely this human, serving as a syllepsis between culture and nature, that looms over La Révolution surréaliste from its very beginning. On the cover of the first issue of the magazine, dated December 1st, 1924, a sentence stands out as demand, promise, and program: "Il faut aboutir à une nouvelle déclaration des droits de l'homme." The nod to the French Revolution is obvious in the aspiration to make of La Révolution surréaliste a continuation or a rejuvenation of the message of "la Révolution française."38 However, what seems to be at stake here, as much as the re founding of the rights of man, is the re-founding of what man is. André Breton will later comment on this mot d'ordre by giving it the dimensions of a radi cal critique of reason, a critique that, according to Breton, is best explained by Ferdinant Alquié, whom he quotes as follows: Déclarer que la raison est l'essence de l'homme, c'est déjà couper l'homme en deux, et la tradi tion classique n'y a jamais manqué. Elle a distingué en l'homme ce qui est raison et qui, par là même est vraiment humain, et ce qui n'est point raison, et paraît, de ce fait, indigne de l'homme.39 The new declaration of the rights of man implies a new definition of the human that goes beyond this "tradition classique," in other words beyond the humanist tradition. "Il faut aboutir à une nouvelle déclaration des droits de l'homme," taken at face value, unsettles the basis of republican universalism and programmatically frames the issue of man within the political realm. Read, however, against the backdrop of Minotaure, and thus within Sur realism's long history, it acquires a different dimension. This is not simply another declaration, nor is it the creation of new rights; it is rather the con stitution of a new human, one with real revolutionary power. André Breton comes back to the question of the human in Minotaure when, in order to identify what in 1934 stands as the most pressing political question, he quotes André Malraux's declaration: "A la bourgeoisie qui disait: l'individu, le communisme répondra: l'homme."40 This shift from the individual to the human also means that the true revolutionary art and poetry of the time must show "une tendance prépondérante à l'approfondissement du problème humain sous toutes ses formes" (Breton, "La Grande Actualité" 62). Going deep into the human riddle leads to the conception of a new human, a ver sion of which was to be found in the Oriental barbarian during the period of La Révolution surréaliste. Another and probably more subversive version is Vol. 51, No. 4 67</page><page sequence="11">L'Esprit Créateur assembled in the pages of Minotaure: a human continuous with the animal, a human that is not a master or a superior being, a human that positions itself beyond the human/animal divide. Thus, if the revolution needs a new declaration of the rights of man, it is because the revolution needs a new operative understanding of man. And in this respect perhaps Giorgio Agamben has a point. "In our culture," he writes, "the decisive political conflict [...] is that between the animality and the humanity of man,"41 to conclude with the following: in our culture man has always been the result of a simultaneous division and articulation of the animal and the human, in which one of the two terms of the operation was also what was at stake in it. To render inoperative the machine that governs our conception of man will there fore mean no longer to seek new—more effective or more authentic—articulations, but rather to show the central emptiness, the hiatus that—within man—separates man and animal, and to risk ourselves in this emptiness: the suspension of the suspension, Shabbat of both animal and man. (Agamben 92) In the search for the new human that would defy the humanist perceptions of the West, the Surrealists of La Révolution surréaliste dwelled on the divi sion of Europe and the Orient, of the Greek and the barbarian, with the latter as the reversed image of the former. The Surrealists of Minotaure, ten years later, do not seem to construct similar dualities based on negative prints. The animal in the magazine is not a human in reverse; throughout Minotaure human and animal experiment with different possible positions and relations with each other, ranging from the juxtaposition and the symbiosis of the two within the Minotaur itself, to animalized visions of the human, like the Mino taur's head composed by a woman's torso in Man Ray's photograph (Figure 2). Minotaure does not provide a definitive answer as to how to stop, once and for all, the "anthropological machine" that has sustained an image of the human as the conqueror of the animal first and foremost within himself (Agamben 33 and after). But it provides glimpses of a situation in which the smooth functioning of this machine might be sabotaged, showing the possi bility of a different configuration of the human, outside the dichotomies that underlie and support our civilization. "It is the very question of man—and of 'humanism'—that must be posed in a new way," claims Agamben (16), and Minotaure seems to have done exactly that. In this sense, the parricidal act against humanism, orchestrated by an archaeology that brings dark strata to the surface, results in a relentless questioning of the human and its limits, of the human and its position within the world. It results finally in a paradoxical investigation of what is human that does not place the human at its core.

In the wake of twentieth-century horrors, in anticipation of those to come, as theorizing who will count as human and who will not led to tragic political and ethical consequences, Minotaure appears to have been especially pre scient. From man to animal, from "l'homme" to "la tête de bête," from La Révolution surréaliste to Minotaure, the Surrealists attempted to provide a non-anthropocentric view of the human by breaking the chains of humanist tradition, by inviting the 'barbarian' outsider inside. The political project announced at the advent of Surrealism, in the first issue of La Révolution sur réaliste, found its continuation almost ten years later with a drastic and daring reconsideration of a long-standing revolutionary question: what is man? Posi tioned as we are in the present, in a historical moment when reconsiderations of the human and even the post-human abound, not only as philosophical queries but as deeply political ones, the Surrealists are our precursors and may have, once again, shown us a path forward.
