<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE LEGAL HERMENEUTICS OF AL-SHAFI'I AND IBN QUTAYBA: A RECONSIDERATION* JOSEPH E. LOWRY (University of Pennsylvania) Abstract In a 1993 monograph Norman Calder argued that Shafi'i's (d. 204/820) Risala must be a product of the early fourth/tenth centuries. Calder's argument, which has not been seriously challenged, rested mostly on a comparison of the Risala's hermeneutic techniques with those of Ibn Qutayba's (d. 276/889) Ta'wil mukhtalif al-hadlth. A comparison of these two works shows that the evidence is much more equivocal than Calder allowed. Moreover, the overriding purposes of the two works differ to an extent which robs Calder's argument of much of its force. A close examination of the two authors' hermeneutics shows, however, that Ibn Qutayba's relatively unsystematic Ta'wil stands closer to classical usul al-fiqh in several important respects than does Shafi'i's Risala. The relationship between the two works is thus broadly consistent with their traditional datings and ascriptions. * Some of the work on this article was made possible by a fellowship from the Center for Advanced Judaic Studies at the University of Pennsylvania during the spring semester of 2002. Several of the conclusions were first presented at the annual meetings of the American Oriental Society and the British Society for Middle Eastern Studies in 2000. Thanks are due to those colleagues who provided comments in those forums. Patricia Crone offered valuable criticisms of an early draft and Devin Stewart of a later version. Dr. James Montgomery kindly shared with me his illuminating article on Ibn Qutayba's remarks on the qasida, "Of Models and Amanuenses: The Remarks on the Qasida in Ibn Qutayba's Kitab al-Shi'r wa'l-Shu'ara' ," in Islamic Reflections, Arabic Musings: Studies in Honour of Professor Alan Jones, edited by Robert Hoyland and Phillip Kennedy (E.J.W. Gibb Memorial Trust Series, forthcoming), and Dr. Julia Bray also kindly shared with me a copy of her article "Lists and Memory: Ibn Qutayba and Muhammad b. Habib," in: Culture and Memory in Medieval Islam, edited by Farhad Daftary and Josef W. Meri (London: I.B. Tauris, 2002). Finally, I wish to thank David Powers, the editorial board of Islamic Law and Society, and the two outside readers, who provided useful comments, stylistic suggestions, and some additional references. Obviously, all shortcomings are my responsibility. ? Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2004 Also available online - www.brill.nl Islamic Law and Society 11, 1</page><page sequence="2">JOSEPH E. LOWRY I. Introduction In his 1993 monograph Studies in Early Muslim Jurisprudence,1 Norman Calder argued that the Risala, attributed to Muhammad b. Idris al-Shafi'i (d. 204/820), must post-date the Ta'wil Mukhtalifal- Hadith of Ibn Qutayba (d. 276/889). Calder's sensational redating of the Risala rested mostly on a comparison of the hermeneutic techniques employed in these two works. Although certain other of Calder's revisionist conclusions in his Studies have been shown to be without merit,2 his work remains an important contribution to the study of early Islamic law. Still, Calder's conclusions in regard to Shafi'i and Ibn Qutayba simply do not follow from the evidence that he adduces. Therefore, convinced by the importance of Calder's project to compare these two authors' legal hermeneutics but unconvinced by his conclusions, I retrace some 1 N. Calder, Studies in Early Muslim Jurisprudence (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1993). 2 Calder's redating of the early Maliki textual tradition, for example, is untenable. See the reviews by M. Muranyi, "Die friihe Rechtsliteratur zwischen Quellenanalyse und Fiktion," Islamic Law and Society 4:2 (1997), 225-41; Y. Dutton, Journal of Islamic Studies 5:1 (1994), 102-8; and M. Fierro, "Nuevas Perspectivas Sobre la Formacion del Derecho Islamico," Al-Qantara 21 (2000), 511-23. See also the articles by H. Motzki, "The Prophet and the Cat: On Dating Malik's Muwatta' and Legal Traditions," Jerusalem Studies in Arabic and Islam 22 (1998): 18-83; Y. Dutton, "'Amal vs. Hadith in Islamic Law: The Case of Sadl al-Yadayn (Holding One's Hands by One's Sides) When Doing Prayer," Islamic Law and Society 3 (1996): 13-40, esp. 28-33; and W. Hallaq, "On Dating Malik's Muwatta," UCLA Journal of Islamic and Near Eastern Law 1 (2001): 47-65. A more general critique is offered by J. Burton, "Rewriting the Timtetable of Early Islam," Journal of the American Oriental Society 115:3 (1995), 453-62. Less critical but with some reservations are R. Peters, International Journal of Middle East Studies 26 (1994), 699-701 and I. Schneider, Journal of Religion 75:4 (1995), 604-6. Favorable, but not uncritical, are B. Weiss, British Journal of Middle East Studies 21:2 (1994), 253-5; A. Rippin, Journal of Semitic Studies 39:2 (1994), 346-7; G.R. Hawting, Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies 59:1 (1996) 139-41; and L. Rosen, Law and History Review 13:1 (1995), 137-9. Relentlessly negative is M. al-Faruque, Muslim World Book Review 15:1 (1994), 11-5. Of these, only two mention Calder's comparison of Shafi'i and Ibn Qutayba. Burton dismisses "Calder's incongruous comparison of Shafi'i's forensic skills with the bumbling performance of the humorless and unimaginative Ibn Qutayba" (p. 460). Peters notes that in light of the failure of Shafi'i's doctrines to gain immediate acceptance (see the works by Wael Hallaq cited below), Ibn Qutayba's apparent ignorance of Shafii''s hemeneutical techniques is easily explained (p. 700). See the following note for the reception of Calder's ideas in the scholarship of Chistopher Melchert. 2</page><page sequence="3">A RECONSIDERATION of the ground that he covered in his Studies, finding it to be of inherent interest, but not, perhaps, as compelling as he claimed. I also consider material and issues which, though ignored by Calder, are vital to understanding how and why Shafi'i's Risala and Ibn Qutayba's Ta'wil differ. Accordingly, in this article, I will undertake a detailed com- parison of the legal-hermeneutic approaches of Shafi'i's Risala and the Ta'wll Mukhtalif al-Hadith of Ibn Qutayba. This study is warranted, in the first place, because Calder's revisionist claims about the Risala and the Ta'wll deserve to be tested,3 but this study is also of general interest for the early history of Islamic legal hermeneutics.4 The origins 3 Christopher Melchert has agreed with Calder that the Risala post-dates Shafi'i. He initially accepted Calder's redating. See C. Melchert, Formation of the Sunni Schools of Law (Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1997), 68 (but see his review, "Discerning the Will of God: Four Recent Books on Islamic Law," Religious Studies Review 23:1 (1997), 11-5, which is more reticent). Subsequently, however, he modified his view and now assigns the Risala to the later ninth century. See "Qur'anic Abrogation across the Ninth Century: Shafi'i, Abu 'Ubayd, Muhasibi, and Ibn Qutaybah," in Bernard G. Weiss ed., Studies in Islamic Legal Theory (Leiden: E.J. Brill, 2002), 75-98. In that article, Melchert compares the hermeneutic techniques, doctrines, and legal reasoning of the jurists named in the title, in the process covering some of the same ground as this article. Whereas Calder argues that the Risala and the Ta'wil are very different, Melchert argues that their substantial similarities compel the conclusion that they are roughly contemporaneous. In another article, Melchert again compares the Ta'wil and the Risala, finding that they both belong to a mid- to late ninth-century trend of arguing for the equally revelational character of Qur'an and prophetic hadith. "Traditionist- Jurisprudents and the Framing of Islamic Law," Islamic Law and Society 8 (2001), 383-406, at 394,402-4. This article aims primarily to correct Calder's conclusions, but I will refer to Melchert's views on occasion in the notes. I should note that I have benefited from discussions of these issues with Dr. Melchert, and am grateful to him for providing me with a copy of his above-cited review. 4 Gerard Lecomte has compared Ibn Qutayba's Ta'wil with another work by Shafi'i, the Ikhtilaf al-Hadlth, "Un Exemple d'Evolution de la Controverse en Islam: De l'Ihtilaf al-Hadith d'al-Safi'i au Muhtalif al-Hadith d'Ibn Qutayba," Studia Islamica 27 (1967), 5-40. Calder seems to have been unaware of Lecomte's comparison, even though Lecomte also refers occasionally to the Risala. In terms of outward literary form, Shafi'i's Ikhtilafand the Ta'wil are similar to one another: both have a substantial theoretical introduction followed by a discussion of numerous legal problems involving contradictory hadith and related textual difficulties. Although Lecomte focused more on results than reasoning techniques, he did make two valid observations: Ibn Qutayba is inferior to Shafi'i in regard to technical legal reasoning, and Ibn Qutayba is also much more concerned with theology than with law. Similarities between the harmonizing approaches of Shafi'i and Ibn Qutayba have been recognized by Ignaz Goldziher, Joseph Schacht, and most recently Eerik Dickinson. I. Goldziher, Muslim Studies, 2 vols., tr. C.R. Barber, S.M. Stern (London: George Allen and Unwin, 1971), v. 2, 86; J. Schacht, The 3</page><page sequence="4">JOSEPH E. LOWRY of Islamic legal theory, which are still poorly understood, lie in the ninth century, and the few preserved texts that engage in self-conscious legal interpretation, such as the Risala and the Ta'wil, constitute a major part of what little evidence we have on the subject. After a few brief remarks concerning these two authors, I will compare their hermeneutic strategies in a variety of legal example- problems, using the hermeneutic rubric 'dmm:khdss as a starting-point, and then turning to a more general examination of their strategies for harmonizing contradictory revealed texts. I will then offer a broader, summary comparison of the specific hermeneutic techniques employed by each. It will emerge that, in many instances, Ibn Qutayba and Shafi'i exhibit more similarities in their hermeneutic techniques than Calder allowed. It will also become clear that to the extent that there are important differences between their approaches-and there are- these flow from the very different purposes of the Risala and the Ta'wil Mukhtalif al-Hadith. The former elaborates a systematic and complete theory of a revealed law; the latter comprises a theological treatise in defense of the Prophetic hadith. Shdfi'i and Ibn Qutayba5 Shafi'i spent his entire life steeped in the study, teaching, and elabora- tion of the law.6 His teachers included legal luminaries such as Sufyan Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1950), 257; E. Dickinson, The Development of Early Sunnite Hadith Criticism (Leiden: E.J. Brill, 2001), 6. Both Goldziher and Schacht suggest that Ibn Qutayba was influenced in his hermeneutics by Shafi'i. 5 Both the Risala and the Ta'wil represent works that were composed later in their respective authors' lives. Up-to-date background information on Shafi'i may be found in E. Chaumont, "al-Shafi'i," Encyclopaedia of Islam, New Edition (Leiden: Brill, 1954 -) (hereinafter EF), v. 9, 181-5. My dissertation contains a detailed study of Shafi'i's Risala: "The Legal-Theoretical Content of the Risdla of Muhammad b. Idris al-Shafi'i," Ph.D. Diss. (University of Pennsylvania, 1999). For Ibn Qutayba's life and works, see G. Lecomte, "Ibn Kutayba," E2, v. 3, 845- 7, Lecomte's study Ibn Qutayba: L'Homme, son Oeuvre, ses Idees (Damascus: Institut Frangais, 1965), and his French translation of the Ta'wl, Le Traite des Divergences du Hadith d'lbn Qutayba (Damascus: Institut Frangais de Damas, 1962). Michael Cook usefully characterizes a number of Ibn Qutayba's concerns in the Ta'wll in "Ibn Qutayba and the Monkeys," Studia Islamica 89 (1999), 43- 74. See also my articles on "al-Shafi'i" and "Ibn Qutayba" in the forthcoming volume of the Dictionary of Literary Biography entitled Arabic Literary Culture c. 500-925 (Detroit: Gale). 6 Shafi'i's legal output was enormous. He is also said to have authored a work on archery, and a diwan of poems is attributed to him. See F. Sezgin, 4</page><page sequence="5">A RECONSIDERATION b. 'Uyayna (d. 196/811) in Mecca, Malik b. Anas (d. 179/796) in Medina, and Muhammad b. al-Hasan al-Shaybani (d. 189/805) in Baghdad. He was through and through a jurist. What is more, he aimed not merely at correctly stating legal doctrine on points of substantive law (as in his voluminous Kitdb al-Umm), but also at justifying the supremacy of law in Islam generally through the elabora- tion of an overarching theory of the fundamentally legislative character of revelation (above all in his Risala, but in other works as well). Ibn Qutayba's commitments were no less far-reaching or significant than Shafi'i's, but they were of an altogether different sort. Ibn Qutayba sought to mold a mass of disparate textual materials of the most diverse kinds into a uniquely Arabo-Islamic literary tradition. This tradition needed, on the one hand, to serve as the basis for a broad and vigorous, and ideologically powerful and attractive, high culture; on the other hand, it needed to form a bulwark against foreign and speculative intellectual pursuits, especially rationalist theology and its Greek underpinnings.7 In pursuing this project to create an appropriate cultural memory, Ibn Qutayba's interests ranged exceptionally widely, from belletristic literature, to history, to the linguistic competence and the general cultural literacy of the bureaucracy, to problems in the language of revealed texts. Crucially, Ibn Qutayba, quite unlike Shafi'i, was not necessarily writing for specialists.8 Nonetheless, Ibn Qutayba also Geschichte des arabischen Schriftums, 9 vols. to date (Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1967 -), v. 1,490 (no. IX) and Diwan al-Shdfi'i, ed. M. 'A. al-Zughbi (Beirut: Dar Ihya' al- Turath al-'Arabi, 1983). Titles of three additional, possibly non-legal works have recently been noted by Dickinson, Early Sunnite Hadith Criticism, 39. I owe this last reference to Christopher Melchert. 7 The latter concern is expressed, for example, in two works written twenty years apart, the Adab al-Kdtib, ed. M.M. 'Abd al-Hamid (Cairo: Maktabat al- Sa'ada, 1963), composed shortly after 850, and in his penultimate (or final) work, the Ta'wil, composed after 870. In the former he chastises the kuttab for being enchanted by the technical terms of theological and philosophical debate, including al-kayfiya wa'l-kamiya...wa'l-jawhar wa'l-'arad (pp. 3-4). In the Ta'wll, he complains that the ahl al-kalam use a superfluously un-Islamic vocabulary, including al-'arad wa'l-jawhar wa'l-kayfiya wa'l-kamlya (p. 13, tr. p. 15). The substantial terminological overlap is noteworthy. 8 Excellent appraisals of Ibn Qutayba's project are given by Bray, "Lists and Memory: Ibn Qutayba and Muhammad b. Habib," and Montgomery, "Of Models and Amanuenses." The Ta'wll was written at the urging of an unnamed patron, possibly someone connected with the de facto 'Abbasid head of government al- Muwaffaq (d. 278/891), brother of the caliph al-Mu'tamid (r. 256-79/870-92). Still, the question of its intended audience remains an open one, but in light of Ibn Qutayba's other works, it is possible that it was intended for an emergent, literate class of private readers, not for jurists or theologians (specialists). 5</page><page sequence="6">JOSEPH E. LOWRY made forays into law and theology, and he even held judicial appoint- ments for a time.9 Ibn Qutayba is a generalist, albeit gifted enough to move competently in many different intellectual arenas, and even excelling in not a few. For Ibn Qutayba the generalist, law is one piece of a larger puzzle; for Shafi'i, the specialist, it is everything. It would be surprising indeed if the two works under discussion in this article did not differ in substantial ways. II. Shdfi'T's and Ibn Qutayba's Hermeneutics It will be convenient to begin the comparison of these two authors' works on hermeneutics by considering some of the conclusions reached by Calder. Calder's analysis of the Risala and the Ta'wil consists of a comparison of the respective authors' hermeneutic approaches.10 After finding that certain specific techniques or refinements of tech- niques are present in the Risala but not in the Ta'wll, he concludes that the Risala "fits" "much more comfortably into a proposed dating of c. 300 [/912-13] than into any earlier period" (Studies, p. 242).11 This conclusion would assign the Risala to a period approximately a quarter century after Ibn Qutayba's death (276/889), about a century later than its traditional ascription.'2 Calder identifies in the Ta'wll not only absences indicative of historical precedence, but also qualitative differences between it and the Risala, a point to which he frequently returns: As a master of adab, Ibn Qutayba was perhaps undisturbed by the abrupt transitions and inconsequential juxtapositions, and disinclined towards systematic theoretical thought. His solutions are ad hoc; his skills are those of a sensitive litterateur rather than a jurist or a theologian; his theoretical framework is large but not evidently scientific. When compared with the systematic theoretical exposition of Shafi'i's Risala ... the rudimentary nature of his categories and terminology becomes evident. (Studies, p. 224) 9 Lecomte, Ibn Qutayba, 32-7, 42-3. He also studied law with at least one jurist of good reputation: Ishaq b. Rahoya (d. 237/851), himself a student of Ahmad b. Hanbal. Ibn Qutayba, 52-3. 10 Studies, 223-7, 233-4 and 241-2. Most of these are quoted in this article. 1 Calder also detects signs of organic growth and redaction in the Risala consistent with corporate authorship over a period of time. Studies, 241-2. Against this view, see my "Legal-Theoretical Content." 12 Ibn Qutayba mentions Shafi'i in the Ta'wll, numbering him among a group of jurists (qawm min al-fuqaha'), along with Ibn Qutayba's teacher, Ishaq b. Rahoya (problem 95, p. 213; see below for citation conventions). 6</page><page sequence="7">A RECONSIDERATION Though Ibn Qutayba's intelligence, cunning and resourcefulness are everywhere evident, as also his broad sensitivity to literary problems, he clearly does not have access to a systematic hermeneutic framework such as is provided in the Risala. (Studies, p. 225) In all categories except one, the Risala is a more sophisticated work and it should accordingly be recognized as representing a later stage of development.l3 (Studies, p. 226) 'Amm and Khass Calder sensed, and quite rightly, the centrality of the pair 'amm:khass to the argument presented by Shafi'i in his Risala. Shafii''s Risala shows an astonishing technical foregrounding of the hermeneutic device known as 'amm:khass. This is both the first major topic addressed in that work and one of the lengthier. (Studies, p. 233) It is one of three "major devices signalled" in the Risala (Studies, p. 241).14 Particularly significant for Calder, however, is its absence from Ibn Qutayba's Ta'wdl: A fundamental hermeneutic category adduced and explored in the Risala is that known by the terms 'amm and khass, the general and the particular. Though there are numerous instances where this terminology would be appropriate, I have found no instances at all where it is used by Ibn Qutayba. (Studies, p. 224) Notwithstanding the importance of the 'amm:khdss rubric for Shafi'i's way of thinking about the law, the suggestion made in the above quotation-that the 'amm:khass technique post-dates the Ta'wll and that Ibn Qutayba could not therefore have known it-is simply wrong. Not only is the 'dmm:khass rubric attested in the ninth century, Ibn Qutayba knew it. The two terms are used in eighth- and ninth- century tafslrs, informally sometimes, but also technically, and also as labels for text types in the Qur'an.'5 The root '-m-m in a technical sense also appears in the Ma'ani al-Qur'an of al-Farra' (d. 207/822), though the root kh-s-s does not appear in that work.'6 The word khass, 13 The one category, according to Calder, is identification of figurative language, an issue that I take up below. 14 Along with naskh and the pair jumla:tabyin, discussed below. 15 C.H.M. Versteegh, Arabic Grammar and Qur'anic Exegesis in Early Islam (Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1993), 74-5 (technical usages), 104-5, 107 (text types). 16 N. Kinberg, A Lexicon ofal-Farra"s Terminology in his Qur'an Commentary (Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1996), 495-6: "general, all-embracing," "in contrast to a form which refers to a particular entity." 7</page><page sequence="8">JOSEPH E. LOWRY and the pair 'amm:khass, appear as technical terms in the Kitab al- 'Ayn of the eighth-century grammarian al-Khalil (d. ca. 163/780?).17 The term 'amma is applied by the jurist Abu Yusuf (d. 182/798) to Q 59:6 in what looks like a technical sense in his Kitdb al-Khardj.i8 Its use by both Abu 'Ubayd (d. 224/839?) and al-Muhasibi (243/857- 8) has been noted.19 Finally, one of Shafi'i's students, al-Muzani (d. 264/878), uses 'amm and khass in a full-blown technical sense, and he was born over 35 years before Ibn Qutayba.20 One could, I suppose, redate all these texts on the basis of Ibn Qutayba's Ta'wil or other criteria, but even putting them all in the last quarter of the ninth century would undermine Calder's argument. And redating would not help with the fact that Ibn Qutayba himself knows the two terms in his Ta'wll Mushkil al-Qur'dn. In that work, he identifies the two concepts as among the majazat that are part of the Arabic language. He refers specifically to al-qasd bi-lafz al-khusus li-ma'na al-'umum wa-bi- lafz al-'umum li-ma'nd al-khusus.21 In fact, as we will see in the next 17 In Talmon's reconstruction of al-Khalil's Kitcb al-'Ayn, 'amm and khass denote nouns which are regular, or proper, respectively, and also denote the scope of reference of a noun. R. Talmon, Arabic Grammar in its Formative Age (Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1997), 328, 5.13 (proper noun: ism khass la yajrl majra al-asma' al- 'awamm), 338, 6.58 (scope of application of a noun: wa'l-inbijas 'dmm wa'l- yanbu' li'l-'ayn khassatan [ignoring the obvious misprint of ha' for kha']). 18 Kitab al-Khardj, ed. I. 'Abbas ('Amman: Dar al-Shuruq, 1985), 116-7. The verse in question concerns the Prophet's share of the booty taken from the Jewish tribe of Nadir. Abu Yusuf holds that the verse is "generally applicable to all villages," 'amma fi al-qurd kulliha. 19 Melchert, "Qur'anic Abrogation," 81-2, who also surmises that Calder was wrong to think that Ibn Qutayba did not know the opposition 'amm:khass. Muhasibi's usage is at least partly driven by the theological question of whether the threat of divine punishment applies generally or only narrowly, not by an interest in harmonizing rules, as it is for Shafi'i (see below). On the theological aspects of the 'amm:khass rubric, see Aron Zysow, "The Economy of Certainty," Ph.D. Diss. (Harvard University, 1984), 131-42. It is not clear to me that either Shafi'i or Ibn Qutayba has a theological agenda in his employment of this vocabulary, but it is not impossible. 20 See his Kitdb al-Amr wa'l-Nahy, R. Brunschvig ed. and tr., "'Le Livre de l'ordre et de la defense' d'al-Muzani," Bulletin d'Etudes Orientales 11 (1945- 1946), 145-96. I discuss this work in a forthcoming article, "The Recepttion of Shafi'i's Concept of amr and nahy in the Thought of his Student al-Muzani," in Law and Legal Education in Islam: Studies in Memory of George Makdisi, eds.

One should not, however, ignore Calder's other insights. He was right to be curious about the hermeneutic strategies in these two texts, right to call attention to their differences, and right to focus on techniques such as the 'amm:khass rubric. I will begin my own analysis of these materials by summarizing what is characteristic about Shafi'T's use of the pair 'dmm:khdss. I will then consider Ibn Qutayba's use of words derived from the root kh-s-s and move from there to an examination of other problems in which he might have been expected to use the 'amm:khass rubric. This procedure offers a convenient means for isolating example-problems in the Ta'wil which might be thought to elicit hermeneutic concerns common to both authors. Shdfi'''s Use of 'dmm and khdss There are two salient features of the 'amm:khdss rubric as it is used in Shafi'i's Risala. First, it functions by taking a legislative pronounce- ment found in one text, which pronouncement seems to apply to a large, undifferentiated group of persons and then, on the basis of another text, narrowing the scope of the first text's application. For example, in the Risala Shafi'i states that the Qur'anic rules governing inheritance by spouses and parents of the deceased at Q 4:11-12 are "expressed in unrestricted terms" ('amm al-makhraj), but that their sphere of application has been limited by the Sunna: The Sunna of God's Messenger indicates that He [= God] only meant certain parents and spouses and not others. That is, [he required] that the religion of the parents and their children, and of the spouses, be the same, and that the heir who is a parent or spouse not be a murderer [of the deceased] and not a slave. (Risala ?216)22 We have, then, a Qur'anic rule (suggesting that all parents and spouses inherit) which appears to apply unrestrictedly to the entirety of a certain class of heirs and a Sunnaic rule (providing that only some parents and spouses inherit) which restricts the scope of the Qur'anic rule to those heirs who are Muslims, not slaves, and not the killers of the deceased. The unrestricted, Qur'anic version of the rule appears 'amm in Islam: The Case of Majdz," Zeitschriftfiir Geschichte der Arabisch-Islamischen Wissenschaften 7 (1991-1992), 253-84, at 255-8. 22 The Sunnaic basis for this statement by Shafi'i consists of various hadlth that he cites later in the Risala, at ??466-80. 9</page><page sequence="10">JOSEPH E. LOWRY at first reading, but when read in conjunction with the Sunnaic text, it emerges that the Qur'anic text is, in fact, khass. Second, Shafi'i's use of 'amm:khass almost always represents a technique for harmonizing Qur'an and Sunna, and it applies asym- metrically to those two texts. Shafi'i does not say this, but it is true for the most prominent examples he gives in the Risala. That is, just as in the example above, passages from the Qur'an always appear 'amm and individual hadiths always show that the Qur'anic passage in question should be read as khdss. Thus, even though it seems that the 'dmm:khass rubric should work for any two texts whatever their provenance, in practice it represents one of Shafi'i's principal means of harmonizing potential contradictions between Qur'an and Sunna. It should be noted, too, that the application of the 'amm:khass technique functions, clumsily perhaps, to create exceptions to rules. It would be simpler to consider the example above as one in which the Sunna carves out an exception to a rule expressed in the Qur'an. In any event, the 'amm:khass rubric offers a means of harmonizing apparently inconsistent rules by allowing one to adjust the size of the group to which one of the rules applies. This becomes possible because the class of persons to which the rule applies, whether expressly mentioned or implicit in the rule's structure, could always be a subset of that class (as in the case of the heirs mentioned at Q 4:11-12). In other words, this technique depends on an ambiguity inherent in the presence of any class of persons, or, in grammatical terms, inherent in the use of the plural. That ambiguity can be exploited for purposes of harmonization with a second, potentially inconsistent text. Shafi'i considers the specific ambiguity which attends the deter- mination of the precise referent of an express or implied class to be a (hermeneutically useful) property unique to the Arabic language (e.g., Risala, ?173).23 23 It must be emphasized, however, that Shafi'i does not conceive of hermeneutic problems in grammatical or linguistic terms, even though he does occasionally suggest that they can involve (unspecified) properties of Arabic. Even his assertion that 'umum and khusus are special properties of Arabic feels much more like a theological claim about the special qualities of Arabic than an assessement of Arabic as a linguistic phenomenon. Classical usiil al-fiqh does conceive of many hermeneutic problems, including those involving the 'amm:khass rubric, as linguistic ones. E.g., Bernard G. Weiss, The Spirit ofIslamic Law (Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1998), 58-65. Recall that, in the Mushkil al-Qur'an, Ibn Qutayba listed 'amm and khass among the majaz-properties of the Arabic language. I will return to this point below. 10</page><page sequence="11">A RECONSIDERATION Ibn Qutayba's Use of the Root kh-s-s Ibn Qutayba uses words derived from the root kh-s-s in four problems, though Calder is right that the word 'amm and relevant cognates do not appear. I begin my consideration of the Ta'wll by examining these four problems in detail. Problem 22 (pp. 88-89)24 concerns a hadith "whose beginning," according to Ibn Qutayba's opponents, "is spoiled by its end" (yufsidu awwalahu akhiruhu), in other words, the hadith is allegedly incoherent. The hadith in question states that "If one of you awakes from sleep, then he should not plunge his hand into the water-container until he washes it three times [hattd yaghsilaha thaldthan]-after all, he doesn't know where his hand has spent the night."25 Ibn Qutayba's opponents claim that the last phrase ("he doesn't know where his hand has spent the night") is (a) patently absurd, since everyone knows where their hand has been during the night; (b) legally inapposite, since even if one touches one's genitalia while awake, that does not vitiate one's previous ablutions; and (c) inconsistent with a general precept of the law, to wit, that involuntary acts (e.g., those committed while sleeping) have no adverse legal consequences for the person who commits them. Ibn Qutayba disputes point (b) and in the course of that discussion, he says the following: So if the ablutions for touching the genitalia are that one wash the hands, then it is clear that God's Messenger (sl'm) commanded the person waking up from sleep to wash his hand before he puts it into the water- container, because that person does not know where his hand has spent the night. Perhaps, he says, during his sleep he touched his genitalia or his anus with it, and it cannot be certain that a drop of urine or the remnants of semen did not get on his hand if he had sexual intercourse before falling asleep. So if he put it into the water-container before washing it, he would defile the water and spoil it. He singled out the 24 I cite the number of the problem according to Lecomte's numbering in his French translation and the corresponding pages of the Arabic text. The Arabic text that I am using (Beirut: Dar al-Kitab al-'Arabi, n.d.) corresponds in its text and notes to the edition of M. Zuhri al-Najjar (Cairo: Maktabat al-Kulliyat al- Azhariya, 1966), but has a different pagination. The individual problems are relatively easy to count so that citations can be located. When citing to the introduction of the Ta'wll, I give the Arabic page numbers first, and then the corresponding pages from Lecomte's translation (e.g.: p. x, tr. p. y). 25 See A.J. Wensinck, Concordance et Indices de la Tradition Musulmane, 8 vols., (Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1943), v. 1, 128, for this hadith (under ina', "water- container"). 11</page><page sequence="12">JOSEPH E. LOWRY sleeping person for this [wa-khassa al-na'im bi-hhadh]26 because the sleeping person's hand might alight on these places, or on his anus, without him being aware of it. (emphasis added) Ibn Qutayba uses the verb khassa to indicate that the rule in question applies only to sleepers, or rather only to persons who awake from sleep. There is no confusion here about the group to which the rule in question applies. By its own terms, it applies to all sleepers (all other things being equal). It is true that sleepers are a subset of the group of persons who must perform ablutions, and it is also true that a slightly more rigorous rule applies to the sleepers than to other members of the class of ablutions-performers, but there is no confusion in the rule itself about the scope of its application. Put differently, this is not a problem requiring the harmonization of two inconsistent rules: there is only one rule and only one group of persons to whom it applies, and there is no competing, inconsistent revealed text which complicates the hadith that expresses the rule. Thus, the usual sort of ambiguity which requires Shafi'i to invoke the 'amm:khass technique is absent. The argument in this problem centers on whether the rule- which everyone understands perfectly well-is a good rule or not, and further, and perhaps more importantly, whether, if it is a bad rule (because incoherent), it seems right that it and other rules like it (in the corpus of hadith) could be expected to form part of a divine law. Ibn Qutayba's opponents think that it is a characteristically silly rule that reflects badly on Prophetic hadiths in general; Ibn Qutayba thinks that it is a rule which can and must be defended in order to maintain the dignity of the corpus of hadith. Whether Ibn Qutayba's deployment of the root kh-s-s in this problem is a garden-variety usage of the verb khassa in the ordinary course or a technical usage is very difficult to say. There is no place in this problem for the term 'amm or a cognate in the sense in which such terms are used by Shafi'i for the reasons already mentioned, because there is neither a potentially ambiguous class of persons at issue, nor a potentially inconsistent second text. The second problem, number 65 (pp. 152-3), involves a hadith in which Muhammad insists that his wives conceal themselves completely (ihtijdb) from a blind male visitor. When his wives complain that the man is blind, Muhammad replies that the issue is that his wives 26 Lecomte, Traite, 148: "I1 a parle en particulier de l'homme endormi a ce propos..." 12</page><page sequence="13">A RECONSIDERATION should not look at the man. The opponents allege that the Qur'an and consensus (ijma') invalidate the hadith. Consensus, they allege, allows that women may lawfully look at men so long as the women are appropriately covered (istatarna). What is more, Q 24:31 provides that women need not cover those of their charms (zina) which in the ordinary course are open to view (zahara). Ibn Qutayba responds that Muhammad's wives were implicitly ordered to conceal themselves from all male visitors in Q 33:53.27 The rule in the hadith applies, then, to Muhammad's wives in particular: This [verse] is for the wives of God's Messenger (sl'm) in particular [khdssatan li-azwaj rasul allah], just as they were singled out [khussisna] in regard to it being unlawful for any Muslim to marry them.28 Ibn Qutayba goes on to say, however, that the rule applies mostly in their dwellings, not when they must perform public religious obliga- tions such as the pilgrimage, or have other pressing reasons to go out in public. Repetition of cognates from the root kh-s-s to illustrate the same phenomenon across two different texts raises the possibility that we are dealing with a technical usage of kh-s-s to refer to the application of a rule to a restricted class. Does the technical term 'amm have a role to play in this problem? Ibn Qutayba might have said that Q 24:31 should be read as khass in light of the hadith (or in light of Q 33:53, for that matter), i.e., as applying to all women except Muhammad's wives. Instead, however, he seems to be saying that Q 24:31 is simply irrelevant and that the hadith in question, consistent with the rule of Q 33:53, applies ex- clusively to Muhammad's wives. Put differently, Ibn Qutayba denies that there is anything in this problem, as posed, to harmonize. Again, this problem does not necessarily bear on whether Ibn Qutayba was able to employ the term 'amm or relevant cognates in legal argumenta- tion. The third problem, number 103 (pp. 228-9), concerns two allegedly contradictory hadlths (mutanaqi.dn). One provides that water cannot 27 The verse provides, in relevant part: "If you need to ask [the Prophet's] wives for something, then ask from behind a curtain, which is more in keeping with purity for your hearts and theirs." 28 Lecomte, Traite, 250, has: "C'etait la un privilege des epouses du Prophete, auxquelles il etait en outre specialement interdit, d'epouser aucun Musulman." His rendering hardly does justice to the obvious technical usage of the root kh-s- s, which is repeated in the parallel example, signaling that it applies across a range of problems. 13</page><page sequence="14">JOSEPH E. LOWRY be defiled by anything and the other that water in an amount greater than or equal to two pitchers full (idha balagha...qullatayn) cannot be defiled. The opponents say that the negative implication of the second hadlth (small amounts of water can be defiled) contradicts the general import29 of the first (no matter how small the amount, water cannot be defiled by anything). In this problem we find ourselves clearly in the sort of terrain where Shafi'i likes to deploy 'amm and khacss. Ibn Qutayba replies to his opponents that the first hadlth refers to water in the sense of largish bodies or amounts of water, which usage, in turn, is the more usual. I quote his analysis in full: We say that it [= the second hadlth] does not contradict the first one. Rather, God's Messenger (sl'm) merely said that water cannot be defiled by anything in the most usual case and for the most part, since what is most usual for wells and pools is that they have a large amount of water. Accordingly, he uttered the phrase in a way that was of restricted import [fa-akhraja al-kalam makhraj al-khusus].30 This is just like when one says, "Nothing can repel the flood-stream" and, in the same vein, "A wall couldn't hold it [= the flood-stream] back." One intends [thereby] a large amount of it, not a little. It is also like saying, "Nothing can withstand fire." One does not intend thereby the flame in a lantern, which can be extinguished by blowing, and not sparks either. Rather, one intends the fire in a conflagration. Then, after saying that [in the first hadlth, in the second hadith] he used the term "two pitchers full" to distinguish [bayyana] the amount of water that is subject to defilement from a large amount of water that cannot be defiled by anything. This is an interesting usage of the word khusus. Ibn Qutayba means to restrict the sphere of the noun's application, but to its most usual and predominant ambit, not to some small, exceptional meaning or range of meanings. Thus, although its meaning is restricted, the resulting sense is the most prevalent one. It is true that Ibn Qutayba 29 "Negative implication" and "general import" are my terms, not those of Ibn Qutayba's opponents, who do not use a descriptive technical vocabulary. 30 Lecomte, Traite, 369: "I1 a exprime cette sentence [generale] comme si elle etait applicable a tous les cas particuliers." This translation is unsatisfactory- though it is interesting that Lecomte adds the word "generale" in square brackets, presumably as a rendering of an unstated 'amm. Obviously, Ibn Qutayba means that the word "water" in the hadlth in question refers to some kinds of water only rather than all kinds of water. What is confusing, and what probably confused Lecomte, is Ibn Qutayba's labeling of the most usual usage as "restricted," but it is restricted in the sense that it excludes marginal cases. Note also that Lecomte seems to take the word makhraj as implying that the utterance in question was made "as if" it were a khusus-usage. In fact, it is a common way of referring to the modality of the utterance ('amm vs. khdss) and has no such implication. See below. 14</page><page sequence="15">A RECONSIDERATION has reduced the universe of potential denotations, but only by excluding the marginal cases illustrated by his examples. When Shafi'i uses the word khusus or a cognate, he often envisions a more clear-cut reduction of the relevant class. It is a subtle difference, perhaps, but a difference nonetheless. Still, the phrase makhraj al-khusus looks technical, and even re- sembles the technical vocabulary of the Risala (compare Risala ?216: 'amm al-makhraj). The procedure employed in this problem in the Ta'wil aids in the harmonization of two apparently inconsistent texts by resolving a putative ambiguity. The ambiguity is resolved by adjusting the scope of reference of a particular noun. It is the sort of procedure that would be very much at home in the Risala, even though Shafi'i generally uses such procedures to deal with groups of persons affected by a rule, not for substances like water. Could Ibn Qutayba have used the term 'amm or a cognate in this problem? Here is a conjecture: If Shafi'i had analyzed this problem using 'amm and khass, he might have said that the first hadith (water cannot be defiled) looked 'amm (unrestricted in its application) until the second hadith came along. The second hadith showed that the first was in fact khass: the word "water" as used in it refers to water in pools and wells (i.e., all water down to an amount of two qullas) and not to other kinds of water. So, it would have been possible, hypothetically speaking, to use the term 'amm here, and, I suppose, one could argue that Ibn Qutayba's analysis is slightly clumsier for not having availed itself of that technical term. Nevertheless, Ibn Qutayba's approach to these two texts is broadly consistent with Shafi'i's, and so is his use of a word derived from the root kh-s-s.31 31 Shafici does analyze these two hadith in the Ikhtilaf al-hadlth, as well as several others that treat related issues. Shafi'i engages in an extensive harmonization of these texts by constructing a legislative matrix that distinguishes between standing (or permanent bodies of) water (da'im), flowing water (jarl), water used for ritual purification, water not so used, and large and small amounts of water. He carefully fits each of the several hadith into the relevant part of the matrix in order to create a coherent legislative scheme treating the defilement of each of these kinds of water. He nowhere uses the terms 'amm or khass, but he does use other technical terms, including qiyas, ma'qul, hujja, and dalll and cognates from the root d-l-l. His analysis is more sophisticated than Ibn Qutayba's, largely because he sets out to analyze a much more complex textual problem. His solution, though systematic, does not depend on the exploitation of a technical vocabulary. Ikhtilaf al-Hadlth, ed. 'A.A.

LOWRY Finally, problem number 104 (p. 229) concerns two different charac- terizations by 'A'isha of her own pilgrimage at the time of the Prophet Muhammad's so-called farewell pilgrimage (hajjat al-wadd') in the year 10/632. According to one report, she said "ahlaltu bi-hajj," and according to another, "ahlaltu bi-'umra."32 Ibn Qutayba's opponents consider these two hadaths contradictory (mutanaqi.dn). The real issue for the opponents in this problem, however, is not the doctrinal content of the two hadlths, but rather the fact that two eminent transmitters cannot agree on what 'A'isha said. The two persons in question, al- Qasim b. Muhammad (d. ca. 106/724-5) and 'Urwa b. al-Zubayr (d. 94/712-13), are grandsons of Abu Bakr al-Siddiq and nephews of 'A'isha. Both are numbered among the so-called seven jurists of Medina, both are major sources of traditions from 'A'isha, and both are, accordingly, culture heroes of the ahl al-hadith.33 If their reporting can be impugned, then so can the texts on which the ahl al-hadith place so much reliance. Ibn Qutayba sets out, accordingly, to show that neither of the two transmitters of these reports (al-Qasim and 'Urwa, respectively, for hajj and 'umra) could have made a mistake (lam yaqa' fhi ghalat min al-Qasim aw 'Urwa). Still, to accomplish this, he must harmonize 32 Lecomte, Traite, 370, renders the phrase in question as "J'ai prononce l'ihlal pour la hajj/'umra!" The verb ahalla (bi-hajj/'umra) can be a synonym for either labbayka (hajjan/'umratan) or ahrama (bi'l-hajj/'umra). Ibn Manzur, Lisan al- 'Arab (Beirut: Dar Sadir, 1990), v. 11,701 (h-l-l). I am grateful to Shawkat Toorawa for discussing appropriate uses of these phrases with me. 33 N. Abbot, Aisha: The Beloved of Muhammad (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1942), 199, 209, 217; C.

'A'isha took al-Qasim in after his father's death. 'Urwa, brother of the counter-caliph 'Abdallah b. al-Zubayr, is said to have been among the chief official mourners at 'A'isha's funeral. Lecomte seems not to understand what is at stake in this problem since he provides a note (Traite, 370, n. 5) which suggests that the dispute concerns when to utter the talbiya, and no further clarification is offered in his "Addenda et Corregenda," Arabica 17 (1970), 187-99, with G.H.A. Juynboll and in collaboration with J. Van Ess. In the "Addenda" (p. 199), however, he does upgrade al-Qasim from "non-identifie" (Traite, 448) to ibn Abi Bakr al-Siddiq, presumably for ibn Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr al-Sididiq. The problem only makes sense if it is about the transmitters, which is the issue that immediately commands Ibn Qutayba's attention, as should be clear from the quotation above. Interstingly, the immediate source of the two reports, according to the opponents, is Isma'il b. 'Ulayya (d. 193/809), one of Shafi'i's teachers, though Ibn Qutayba could not have had it directly from Ibn 'Ulayya. 16</page><page sequence="17">A RECONSIDERATION the two reports,34 which he does by arguing that 'A'isha set out originally to perform the hajj, but was then directed by Muhammad to perform the 'umra instead, along with many other Companions: We say that there is, for [each of] these two hadith, a solution [makhraj] which does not entail that al-Qasim or 'Urwa made a mistake in regard to either one. Namely, the Companions of God's Messenger (sl'm) proceeded to Mecca, having pronounced the formula "labbayka" for the hajj-pilgrimage. God's Messenger (sl'm) then ordered them to circumambulate [the Kaaba] and to run [between Safa and Marwa], and then to end their ritual state and to make it into an 'umra-pilgrimage. So the people exited their ritual state and returned to the enjoyments of the profane state before undertaking the hajj [tamatta'u]. The Prophet (sl'm) said, "If it were not for the fact that I have a sacrificial animal with me, I would exit the ritual state, too." Abu Dharr35 held that this- in regard to cancelling the [obligation of] the hajj-pilgrimage-applied specifically to them [inna hadha minfaskh al-hajj lahum khassatan],36 and many jurists have so concluded as well. Thus, it was permissible for 'A'isha (may God be pleased with her) to have said the ihlal formula first in regard to the hajj, and so she said to al-Qasim, "ahlaltu bi- hajj" and then to have canceled it and made it into an 'umra, whereupon she said to 'Urwa, "ahlaltu bi-'umra," being truthful in both regards. This is because the hajj in regard to which she said the ihlal formula became an 'umra by command of God's Messenger (sl'm).37 The use of khassatan in this problem seems to connote a one-time dispensation applicable solely to those persons whom Muhammad commanded to cancel their hajj-pilgrimage. In other words, although they had obligated themselves to perform the hajj, on this one occasion their failure to do so was excusable. Thus, not only could 'A'isha 34 Again-not because there is a doctrinal problem, but in order to show that information received in the form of hadith, from transmitters such as al-Qasim and 'Urwa, is reliable and not self-contradictory. 35 Jundub b.

I. Poonawalla (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1990), 109-15. 'A'isha and the Companions apparently completed the 'umra, exited the ritual state, reentered the ritual state, and undertook the hajj shortly thereafter, a variation on the pilgrimage referred to as tamattu'. The Prophet performed the hajj right away and was joined therein by 'Ali b. Abi Talib. On tamattu' see A. Gribetz, Strange Bedfellows: Mut'at al-nisa' and Mut'at al-hajj.

LOWRY validly have said "ahlaltu bi-hajj" and then "ahlaltu bi-'umra," but the two transmitters in question could in fact have heard and duly reported both utterances, even though they appear to contain a contra- diction. So, although this problem involves a contradiction (though one not, strictly speaking, in a revealed text), the use of the root kh-s-s plays little role in Ibn Qutayba's strategy for resolving it. It is possible that khassatan here indicates an exception for certain of the Companions and 'A'isha, but it is difficult to tell whether it is a technical usage. It vaguely recalls the use of khassatan in problem 65, and perhaps of the cognate verb in problem 22. Ibn Qutayba's result depends on asserting the occurrence of a particular historical event, not on the fact that khassatan indicates the scope of application of a particular obligation or ruling. Thus, it probably would not have been helpful to use the term 'amm or its cognates in this problem. What Ibn Qutayba has done is imagine a context in which two apparently contradictory statements could be true. This is a favorite technique of Shafi'i. In problems 22, 65, and 104 Ibn Qutayba uses cognates from the root kh-s-s to indicate that a class of persons is "singled out" for a particular obligation, status, etc. By contrast, in problem 103, he uses a word from the same root to "restrict" the denotation of a noun for purposes of harmonizing two texts. Only this last usage resembles that of Shafi'i, and not surprisingly, since it is the one problem that most resembles those instances in which Shafi'i likes to deploy the 'dmm:khass rubric. Ibn Qutayba's usage of the root kh-s-s, admittedly neither as consis- tent nor as productive as Shafi'i's, seems only to border on the technical. This is because he uses it in the largely non-technical way that a ninth-century mufassir would, "to pinpoint the exact referent for each historical and anaphoric referent" in revealed texts.38 Put differently, the root kh-s-s serves in three of the four problems to identify or characterize a class, not to change the parameters of a class in order to resolve an ambiguity arising from inconsistent rules 38 Versteegh, Arabic Grammar and Qur'anic Exegesis, 74. The quotation refers to pinpointing referents in the Qur'an. Versteegh concludes that in general the use of 'amm and khass in the early tafsirs is at best only barely technical, if at all: "In itself the terminology of 'dmmatan and khassatan is not particularly relevant to the development of linguistic studies, but it provides a good example of the non- technical origin of two terms which were to become later two of the important categories of usuli hermeneutics." Arabic Grammar and Qur'anic Exegesis, 75. 18</page><page sequence="19">A RECONSIDERATION which appear to apply to that class.39 This tafsir-usage of kh-s-s pre- figures the later usul al-fiqh usage, which concerns, from primarily a linguistic perspective, a noun's scope of reference.40 Shafi'i's usage, which serves exclusively the goal of harmonization, concerns the scope of application of a rule and seems not to be the origin of the later usul al-fiqh usage. This distinction is concededly subtle, since a noun's scope of reference can determine the scope of a rule's application, but the fact remains that in later usul al-fiqh, the 'amm:khasss rubric concerns what I would call linguistic ambiguity in one text (ambiguity of implication) while for Shafi'i it primarily concerns rules in two or more texts (ambiguity arising from apparent contradiction). It seems significant, in this regard, that Ibn Qutayba, unlike Shafi'i, is able to use kh-s-s in ways which do not really require (or imply) 'amm or some cognate as a necessary counterpart or complement. That is, identification of something as khass is sufficient in and of itself for Ibn Qutayba. Perhaps it is not surprising that, in the defensive context of the Ta'wll, it was more availing to argue that things were khass rather than 'amm. If my interpretation is correct, then it raises the question why usul al-fiqh received this idea and terminology from the tafslr (and grammatical) tradition and not from Shafici. It would also mean that Ibn Qutayba's employment of the root kh-s-s is not a more primitive version of Shafi'i's (unusual) technique of appealing to 'amm and khass, but a different, separately evolved (and more usual, though still emergent) technical usage. ** Are there other problems in the Ta'wtl in which Ibn Qutayba could have invoked the 'amm/khass distinction? Calder clearly thought so ("there are numerous instances where this terminology would be 39 Put differently, Ibn Qutayba chooses between identifying a class as A, or as B. Shafi', by contrast, shows that a class which looks like it should contain all A in fact contains a subset of A. The usage of the root kh-s-s in problem 103, as noted, differs from that of the other three problems. 40 This is not to say that 'amm:khass could not be a harmonization technique in later usul al-fiqh, only that it is presented as a linguistic phenomenon. See, e.g., Weiss, Spirit of Islamic Law, 107; by the same author, The Search for God's Law (Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press, 1992), 389-446; Wael Hallaq, A History of Islamic Legal Theories: An Introduction to Sunnl usul al-fiqh (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997), 45; Muhammad Hashim Kamali, Principles ofIslamic Jurisprudence, rev. ed.

In fact, as I will argue below, most of the problems dealt with in the Ta'wil concern issues of dogma, not legal doctrine, and the 'amm:khass rubric works for harmonizing rules, not for defending or denying theological propositions. Of the 109 problems analyzed by Ibn Qutayba in the Ta'wll, I would call only 38 "legal" in the narrow sense. Of those 38 problems, only six involve a conflict between Qur'an and Sunna,41 the situation in which Shafi'i deploys the 'amm:khdss technique. One of these is number 65, which I have already discussed. I will turn first to the remaining five such problems, and then to a consideration of a few additional problems that are analyzed by both authors and that involve apparently contradictory hadlth. Qur'an-Sunna Conflict in the Ta'wil Problem 5 (pp. 63-4) concerns adultery. The opponents claim that a hadith in which Muhammad announces his intention to impose the punishments of stoning and exile "on the basis of God's Book" (bi- kitdb allah) contradicts the Qur'an (yukhalifal-kitdb), which contains no mention of stoning or exile. Ibn Qutayba offers an ad hoc argument to the effect that "God's Book" in this instance refers not to the Qur'an, but rather to God's ruling (hukm) or imposition of an obligation (fard). He cites some further verses of the Qur'an that allegedly use cognates from the root k-t-b in this way, and a verse of poetry, as proof of his claim. The hadath in question is well known and was the subject of much discussion in early legal texts. Shafi'i offers a very complex analysis of this same problem in the Risala, mostly under the rubric of abrogation, but he also hints at the relevance of the 'dmm:khdss rubric.42 41 Problems 5, 44, 45, 46, 65, and 99. Eleven of the "dogmatic" problems involve Qur'an-hadith conflict. 42 For Shafi'i's analysis of this problem, see Lowry, "Legal-Theoretical Content," 131-43 and cp. J. Burton, The Sources of Islamic Law: Islamic Theories of Abrogation (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1990), 136-58. Again in this problem, Shafi'i analyzes a larger body of materials (more hadith and more verses from the Qur'an) than Ibn Qutayba. Shafi'i's analysis is more sophisticated, but he is also dealing with a much more complex textual problem. Lecomte compares Ibn Qutayba's discussion with Shafici's in his Ikhtildf, "Un Exemple," 27-9. I cannot agree with Lecomte's remark (p. 28, n. 1) "il est facile de voir que la demonstration concerne exclusivement l'exercise du qiyas juridique." The problem for both Ibn Qutayba and Shafi'i is one of harmonizing extant but conflicting texts, not analogizing from extant texts to an unregulated legal situation. 20</page><page sequence="21">A RECONSIDERATION In problem 44 (p. 130), the opponents allege that the hadith which has Muhammad stone an adulterer conflicts with Q 4:25, which provides that the punishment for adultery is flogging.43 The dispute centers, at least in part, on what the word muhsanat means in the verse in question.44 The opponents claim that it must mean female slaves (sg. ama). Ibn Qutayba argues that it means "free virgin women" and cites the beginning of the same verse, which, he argues, uses muhsanat in that sense. Ibn Qutayba also expressly labels his inter- pretation a ta'wil. Shafi'i's analysis of the materials in the immediately preceding problem also includes the passages analyzed separately in this problem by Ibn Qutayba. Shafi'i's analysis depends on a complex series of abrogations (naskh) but he, too, must argue that muhsanat in Q 4:25 means "free virgins." He bases his interpretation on an inference from a hadith (istidlal bi'l-sunna) and ijma' (Risala ?388).45 Note that both authors invoke other texts in support of a lexicographical argument. Problem 45 (pp. 130-1) involves the well-known conflict between the hadith which provides that no statutory heir may receive a bequest, and Q 2:180, which provides that parents and other near relatives should receive bequests. Ibn Qutayba responds that Q 2:180 was abrogated by Q 4:11-12, which provides a detailed scheme of fixed inheritance shares. This is more or less the argument made by Shafi'i in the Risala (??393-415).46 43 See the preceding note. 44 Q 4:25 uses the word muhsanat three times, and the cognate passive verb uhsinna once. It reads in relevant part (following Paret's translation): "And those of you who do not have the means to marry upstanding [muhsanat], believing women should marry instead your believing slave-girls that you own...Marry them with the permission of their families and give them their rightful due. They should be upstanding [muhsanat] women, not those who engage in lewdness or take lovers. If they become upstanding [uhsinna] and then commit an indecent act, then they receive one-half the punishment of upstanding [muhsanat] women..." For a plausible argument that muhsanat and cognates denote women who enjoy some kind of non-familial protected status, see J. Burton, "The Meaning of 'Ihsan,"' Journal of Semitic Studies 19 (1974), 47-75. 45 The hadith in question, cited at Risala ?386, provides that slave-girls who commit adultery should be flogged. It is not clear to me what inference Shafi' draws from it. Shafi'i argues that the first occurrence of muhsanat in Q 4:25 means "female converts to Islam." See the references to Burton's writings in the preceding notes and also to my "Legal-Theoretical Content." 46 Shafi'i also cites Q 2:240, which provides that a bequest should be made for widows (Risala ?394). He alludes to, but does not quote directly from, Q 4:11-12 and says that they might have abrogated the verses which provide for a bequest 21</page><page sequence="22">JOSEPH E. LOWRY In problem 46 (pp. 131-4), a hadith is said to be incompatible with Q 4:23-4 (yadfa'uhu al-kitdb). Q 4:23-4 lists certain women whom one may not marry, whether because of consanguinity or fosterage, and then expressly provides that all other women are lawful [uhilla]. Thus, by its own terms, the Qur'an appears to state an exclusive rule. The hadlth in question provides that certain additional women are off-limits. As the opponents point out, the hadith in question ought not to make something unlawful that God has so emphatically declared lawful in the Qur'an. Ibn Qutayba replies that, in this instance, the hadith has abrogated the Qur'an (presumably he means abrogated it to the relatively limited extent that the two are inconsistent on this point). Shafi'i discusses this same set of rules in the Risala (??624- 35), but harmonizes them using a different hermeneutic technique. For Shafi'i, the Qur'anic pronouncement is non-specific (jumal) and the hadith furnishes evidence (dalll) that the Qur'anic text should be read as restricted in scope (khass). Thus, the hadith supplies additional, clarifying detail, and narrows the scope of the language which says that all other women are lawful (i.e., to mean all other women except for those mentioned in the subsequent hadith). Presumably this means that, for Shafi'i, the two texts in question were deemed potentially divergent to an extent that required some interpretive intervention, but not so utterly inconsistent as to necessitate invocation of the doctrine of abrogation. Shafi'i's approach does seem more subtle, by virtue of his application of two technical devices (jumla/mufassar and 'ammlkhass), whereas Ibn Qutayba's resort to abrogation could be thought crude by comparison. In problem 99 (pp. 220-1), the opponents argue that a hadith is invalidated by consensus (ijma') and scripture (al-kitab). The hadith provides that whoever breaks a bone or becomes lame (kusira, 'araja) during the pilgrimage automatically exits the state of ritual purity (halla) and becomes obligated to perform the pilgrimage at a later (?396). Then, he adduces hadlths to show that abrogation did in fact occur. Shafi'i argues, then, that we know the inconsistency in the Qur'an to be an instance of abrogation because we have the hadiths which allow us so to infer. Ibn Qutayba argues that the Qur'an does not contradict the hadith because another passage in the Qur'an tells us that the first passage was abrogated. Both have the same understanding of the law and its legislative history, but each is answering a slightly different question. On the history of early Islamic inheritance law, see D. Powers, Studies in Qur'an and Hadith: The Formation of the Islamic Law of Inheritance (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1986). On abrogation in early Islamic law generally, see Burton, Sources. 22</page><page sequence="23">A RECONSIDERATION date.47 This, allege the opponents, contradicts both current practice and Q 2:196, which provides that one should complete the pilgrimage and, in case of difficulties, do one's best. Ibn Qutayba, using a technique known to Shafi'i, argues that the two texts apply in different circumstances: the hadith in Mecca, and the Qur'anic verse prior to entry into Mecca. Shafi'i's notion of 'amm and khass could have been used here: The Qur'anic verse would have looked unrestricted in its scope (i.e., would have appeared to apply to all pilgrims), but the hadith would have shown that it was in fact khass, and only applied to pilgrims prior to their entry into the haram, not to all pilgrims wherever located. In all of these problems, Ibn Qutayba uses techniques also used by Shafi'i: citing of shawahid to prove points of lexicography; arguing that apparently contradictory rules apply in different contexts; and abrogation. In one of the problems, he even uses the same argument used by Shafi'i. On the other hand, in one problem (number 99), the 'amm:khass rubric could have been employed. Apparently Contradictory Hadiths There is no reason why Shafi'i's technique of 'amm and khass could not have been used for resolving contradictions between hadiths.48 Thus, it will be appropriate to consider problems from the Ta'wil involving contradictory hadlths. Since there are many such problems in the Ta'wll, I have chosen to focus on those four that are dealt with also by Shafi'i in the Risala. I now turn to a brief survey of these. Problem 34 (pp. 112-13) concerns the punishment of amputation for theft. Ibn Qutayba's opponents pose it as an instance of two contradictory hadiths, one providing for a de minimis exception,49 and one denying that there is a de minimis exception. Ibn Qutayba first cites Q 5:38, which states the unqualified rule that thieves' hands should be amputated. He then says that the hadith denying the de minimis exception was in accord with the apparent meaning (zahir) of Q 5:38, but that God subsequently made known that there was a de minimis exception, by means of the other hadith. God did not reveal the whole rule all at once (jumlatan), but rather in stages. Ibn 47 See Wensinck, Concordance, v. 4, 175 ('araja). 48 In fact, his student Muzani did just that in his Kitdb al-Amr wa'l-Nahy, cited above. 49 I.e., the punishment does not apply to thefts of items below a certain value. 23</page><page sequence="24">JOSEPH E. LOWRY Qutayba also offers a ta'wil (his term) of the anti-de minimis exception hadlth to show that, in the alternative, it can also be harmonized with the existence of a de minimis exception. The principal legal-theoretical notion here, however, is that rules may sometimes be revealed piece- meal and may look contradictory if their correct sequence is not borne in mind.50 For Shafi'i, this problem is one of how to characterize the relationship between Q 5:38, which appears to state an unqualified rule, and the de minimis exception in the hadlth. He uses the 'amm:khass rubric: Q 5:38 looks as though it applies to all thieves, but in fact the de minimis hadlth shows that it applies only to those who steal something with a certain minimum value (Risala ??223- 4, reprised at ??1619-20). Problem 47 (pp. 134-5) concerns whether a major ritual ablution (ghusl) is required before the Friday prayer. According to Ibn Qutayba's opponents, one hadlth makes such a washing mandatory while another merely makes it preferable (afdal) to lesser ablutions (tawaddu'). Ibn Qutayba harmonizes the two hadlths by using a technique known to Shafi'i: the apparently mandatory language in the hadith requiring a major ablution only indicates that it would be best if one did that, not that one must. In fact, such an ablution entails merit, but is optional ('ala al-fadlla wa'l-ikhtiyar). In an arresting formulation, he says that it is a strict injunction to do something non- binding which entails merit, but not with the implication that it is obligatory: ijdb 'ala al-fadlla la 'ala jihat al-fard. It is hard to see what legal force the term Ijdb could possibly have after such a sentence, but on the other hand, such a slippery characterization of the hadith in question shows that Ibn Qutayba had the capacity to think very much like lawyer. For Shafi'i, too, this is a problem of contradictory hadlth (ahddlth mukhtalifa), and his analysis is very much in the spirit of Ibn Qutayba's: The strict hadlth is ambiguous (yahtamilu ma'nayayn). The apparent meaning (zahir) is that a major washing is indeed obligatory, but it is possible, too, that the obligation is optional, and concerns only manners and personal hygiene. Shafi'i's formulation is equally clever and does equal violence to the word wdjib: wajib fi al-ikhtiyar wa' -akhldq wa' -nizafa. It is "obligatory" 50 This point strikes me as consonant with the concern of classical usul al-fiqh with sequence, apart from questions of abrogation. E.g., Weiss, Search for God's Law, 416-62 (mujmal and mubayyan); Kamali, Principles of Islamic Jurisprudence, 110-1 ('amm and khass). 24</page><page sequence="25">A RECONSIDERATION or binding in respect of its optional character, and in regard to manners and personal hygiene, that is, binding in respect of non-binding matters-another quintessentially lawyerly formulation (Risala ?? 838-46). In this problem, the similarities in technique and formulation are striking. Problem 66 (p. 153) concerns an interesting issue in sales law: when goods are returned because of a latent defect ('ayb), may the returning buyer keep any gains reaped as a result of having had possession of the goods from the time of delivery to the time of their return to the seller? Ibn Qutayba's opponents allege a contradiction between two hadlth, one which provides that the buyer may keep the resulting profits even if the sale goods are returned, and another which provides that the return of a ewe or she-goat which was purchased with a full udder (musarrat)51 but then milked must include a small amount of compensation for the milk. Ibn Qutabya holds that the two cases are not analogous for the reason that, in the case of the ewe, the milk was already in existence at the time of the sale and constituted part of the bargain. Thus, the sale expressly included the animal and its milk and so some accounting must be made for the milk, which cannot be returned.52 In the other case, the gain arose after the transaction, was never part of the seller's property, and so need not be returned.53 Shafi'i reaches the same conclusion as Ibn Qutayba, but his argument is subtler, and the counterarguments to which he responds have to do not only with contradictory texts, but with important policy questions in regard to sales law. The issue for Shafi'i is this: allowing the purchaser to keep subsequently arising profits even after returning the goods that were the source of the profits presents the problem that the purchaser seems to have got something (profits) for nothing (after a full refund of the sale price). Unequal exchanges are abhorrent to Islamic law and this looks like an unequal exchange (of precisely the sort that the hadith about the unmilked ewe sought to avoid). Shafi'i describes the profits (as opposed to the milk) as "subsequently 51 See E.W. Lane, Arabic-English Lexicon, 2 vols. (Cambridge: Islamic Texts Society, 1984), v. 2, 1686. 52 Ibn Qutayba's analysis is not quite as smooth as I have presented it, but this seems to be his point. 53 Ibn Qutayba also makes the superfluous suggestion that, in the case of the ewe, there might have been fraud, since the milk could have been allowed to collect in order to induce the buyer to think that the animal produced milk regularly. Once it ceased producing, the buyer would have returned it. 25</page><page sequence="26">JOSEPH E. LOWRY arising within the purchaser's property and scope of liability" (haditha fi milkihi wa-damanihi, Risala, ?1504; a point also emphasized by Ibn Qutayba in regard to ownership but not in regard to liability). That is, the buyer owns and bears the risk of loss of the profits. More important, however, he bears the risk of loss with respect to the underlying property until it is returned. It is by virtue of bearing this risk of loss for the underlying property that the buyer is entitled to keep the gains from property returned to the seller (Risala, ?1659). This point gives rise to the slogan in the hadith at issue: al-khardj bi'l-damdn, profit in exchange for liability. That is, the buyer keeps the profits in exchange for bearing the risk of loss of the underlying sale goods, so that no unequal exchange results. Had the underlying goods perished before their return, it would have been the buyer's loss. This is legal (and economic) reasoning at a high level, especially in the conceptualization of an intangible form of value for purposes of imagining a bilateral exchange (see Risala ?? 1503-17 and ??1657- 64).54 Finally, problem 83 (pp. 177-8) concerns two hadlths that take opposite positions on whether enemy non-combatants (women and children of the mushrikun) may be killed in combat. In the first hadith, Muhammad appears to endorse the killing of such persons and in the second he disapproves of it. Ibn Qutayba harmonizes the two reports by arguing that such persons have, strictly speaking, the same legal status (hukm) as enemy combatants (accounting for the first hadith) but that it is disapproved to kill them intentionally (accounting for the second hadith). It is perhaps a fitting note on which to end this survey: these are precisely the argument and result found in Shafi'i's Risala (??823-37). Shafi'i knows a couple of other relevant 54 Both the cited discussions occur within the larger framework of Shafi'i's treatment of qiyas. They illustrate his point that some hadith may validly serve as the basis for an analogy and some may not. One may generally analogize from the hadith about the subsequently arising profits (which concerns a slave as the underlying goods), but not from the case of the unmilked ewe. The first hadith covers all sorts of sales where the underlying goods generate after-arising gain (animals, fruit trees, slaves, etc.), but the second hadith refers to a specific situation where an unknown quantity (milk in the udder) passes from the seller's property to the buyer's property in a manner incidental to the underlying transaction. Hence, the Prophet decreed in the second instance (sale of the unmilked ewe) that one need merely pay a token amount in exchange for the unknown quantity, since the point is to avoid the appearance of an unequal exchange, but not to provide a precise accounting. 26</page><page sequence="27">A RECONSIDERATION hadlths, and he also reports (but without endorsing) the opinion of his teacher Sufyan b. 'Uyayna that the more militant hadith was abrogated by the more tolerant one.55 But in the end, he reaches the same conclusion, using the same argument, as Ibn Qutayba.56 The differences in technique and result between Shafi'i and Ibn Qutayba are, in many instances, relatively slight. If anything, what is striking is how broadly comparable they are-at least in their analyses of legal problems. Still, I think Calder is right (and also Lecomte and Burton) when he suggests that Shafi'i's skills in legal analysis surpass those of Ibn Qutayba, and the above-discussed problem concerning sales law provides a good illustration of Shafi'i's heightened sensitivity to the interplay of facts, rules, policies and argumentation. This qualitative difference, which struck Calder, goes back partly to the fact that Shafi'i was a more accomplished jurist than Ibn Qutayba.57 Perhaps more important in this regard, however, is another, more fundamental difference: the Ta'wll concerns dogmatic theology and the Risala law.58 Law, Theology, and Hermeneutics Any comparison of the Risala with the Ta'wil which rests on the assumption that both seek to articulate a legal hermeneutic would be manifestly unfair to Ibn Qutayba. Above, I noted that only about one-third of the problems in the Ta'wll (38 out of 109) are legal in the narrow sense. Every one of the approximately 60 total problems in the Risala is legal in the narrow sense. Most problems in the Ta'wil 55 Shafici also adduces Q 4:92 to bolster his position, arguing that its rules for compensation in cases of wrongful death-which apply to Muslims-indicate by negative implication that no adverse legal consequences follow from the killing of the enemy's non-combatant women and children, who are non-Muslims. This move underscores that the more militant of the two hadiths is in accord with the Qur'an and therefore need not be discarded just because the more tolerant hadith is valid. 56 Lecomte, "Un Exemple," 29, also analyzes this problem. Strangely, he pays no attention whatsoever to either author's strategy for harmonizing the inconsistent hadlths that give rise to the problem in the first place. 57 Lecomte suggests that Ibn Qutayba's judicial position in the provinces was more sinecure than substance. "Evolution de la Controverse," 25. 58 A point repeatedly emphasized by Lecomte in his comparison of the Ta'wil with Shafii's Ikhtildf al-Hadith. "Evolution de la Controverse," 11, 26-7. 27</page><page sequence="28">JOSEPH E. LOWRY concern issues of theological dogma. This fact has real consequences for the sorts of hermeneutic techniques that were available to Ibn Qutayba: strategies for teasing legal rules out of texts simply do not work for texts which impart dogmatic lessons. Legal rules apply (1) to particular groups of people, (2) at particular moments in time, and (3) at particular points in space. Thus, for any given legal rule, there are three variables-who, when, and where- that can be massaged as needed when harmonizing apparently contra- dictory legal texts, such as apparently contradictory hadlth. As we have seen, the 'amm:khass rubric functions, for Shafi'i, by adjusting the groups of people to which certain rules apply. Naskh, the notion that certain rules were once binding but have now been abrogated, adjusts the points in time when different rules apply. The claim that different rules apply in different places (as in Ibn Qutayba's problem 99, above) functions to assign divergent rules to separate sets of spatial coordinates (temporal coordinates may be differentiated in this way as well, not only in cases of naskh, where a rule is discarded, but also in order to retain in force two inconsistent rules). Many of the techniques employed by Shafi'i and Ibn Qutayba can be understood in this way. The utility of such procedures, for retaining rather than discarding revelatory material, seems obvious. These sorts of harmonizing strategies do not work, however, for hadiths that express, say, abstract notions about the nature of God, that is, eternal verities, or for hadlth that are doctrinally repugnant. For example, one hadlth defended by Ibn Qutayba (problem 54; p. 142) asserts that God has two right hands. Now, either God does or does not have two right hands. But if we were to use one of Shafi'i's techniques, we might find ourselves in the uncomfortable position of having to argue that God only had one right hand last Wednesday or, worse yet, that some other doubly right-handed God, perhaps in some other place, was meant. Eternal verities are just that (quite obviously): true for all time or, in the case of those eternally false propositions that one wishes to refute, not true at any time. To the extent that one is faced with apparently contradictory eternal verities (so to speak), they could possibly be reconciled by idiosyn- cratic, ad hoc interpretations. This, in fact, constitutes one of Ibn Qutayba's strategies: he engages in ad hoc, speculative readings of texts. The term ta'wil, which appears in the title of Ibn Qutayba's work, frequently denotes precisely the overtly ad hoc, individualized 28</page><page sequence="29">A RECONSIDERATION interpretation of revealed texts. Ad hoc readings have the further benefit that they do not lead to the development, from problematic texts, of generalizable procedures that could be mischievously (mis-)applied to other texts. Ad hoc reading is possible for analyses of some legal texts, too, but not very useful if, like Shafi'i, one is engaged in system-building through classification of texts according to hermeneutic features. Another favorite technique of Ibn Qutayba, however, the appeal to figurative language, does not help with deciphering rules. Appeals to figurative language help with uncomfortably vivid formulations by allowing an argument to the effect that a particular proposition is true, but in some symbolic sense (in the case of our doubly-right handed God: "it's not literally about hands as such"). Legal rules are highly resistant to symbolic readings.59 The point is this: if one is going to claim that the Risala post-dates the Ta'wll on the basis of the Risala's more fulsome array of legal- hermeneutic techniques, then one could equally well claim that the Ta'wil post-dates the Risala on the basis of its more generous supply of interpretive techniques which help with problems of dogma. Neither claim would be very sensible. It is much more useful to recognize that the two works differ in important ways, notwithstanding the fact that their overlap in the area of legal reasoning and interpretation is a happy coincidence for the study of the history of legal hermeneutics in the ninth century. 59 Classical usul al-fiqh explored the haqiqa:majaz opposition as a preliminary to deciding whether a text constituted a rule at all. Legal theorists were interested in two questions in particular: was a particular word or phrase meant tropologically, and if so, under what conditions did tropological language engender legal obligation? Shafi'i's analyses usually concern texts in conflict, in other words, he starts at a point when he has already decided that they are to some extent normative. Ibn Qutayba asserts the existence of tropological formulations in regard to texts that do not engender any legal obligations. He does this in order to disarm his opponents' objections to embarrassing turns of phrase, and to avoid having to do away with the allegedly objectionable texts themselves. Still, Ibn Qutayba, unlike Shafi'i, shares with classical usul al-fiqh the notion that tropological language inhabits revealed texts, and that its existence can be exploited for certain interpretive ends. On haqiqa and majdz in classical usul al-fiqh, see, e.g., Weiss, Search for God's Law, 134-50 and the discussion below. 29</page><page sequence="30">JOSEPH E. LOWRY III. Overview of Hermeneutic Techniques in the Risala and the Ta'wdl I now offer a more bird's eye view of the differences between the hermeneutic techniques in the Risala and those in the Ta'wll Mukhtalif al-Hadlth than has thus far been attempted.60 Hermeneutic Concepts Common to Ibn Qutayba and Shdfi'l 1. 'Amm:Khdss: We have seen that Ibn Qutayba knew this pair in his Mushkil al-Qur'an, and that he used words derived from the root kh-s-s in the Ta'wll. On the other hand, as Calder noted, he does not use the pair in the Ta'wll, and does not really use the root kh-s-s therein in the technically consistent and productive way that Shafi'i does in the Risala. Perhaps the evidence is too equivocal to claim it as a shared technique, but then it is also too equivocal to serve as the basis for the radical redating of the Risala proposed by Calder. It is nonetheless interesting that Ibn Qutayba seems to know this pair of terms as part of an exegetical hermeneutics for the Qur'an, but not as part of a legal hermeneutics. It is, perhaps, even more noteworthy that Ibn Qutayba's formulation in the Mushkil al-Qur'an arguably represents a stage of development not yet attained even by Shafi'i's disciples. For Shafi'i, all texts from the Qur'an begin life as 'amm; some are then shown to be khass by other texts from the Sunna. Shafi'i's student al-Muzani realized that 'amm and khass did not have to be strictly identified with Qur'an and Sunna. Accordingly, he uses the 'amm:khass rubric to combine Qur'anic and Sunnaic texts in many more ways than Shafi'i did.61 Neither Shafi'i nor Muzani, however, seems to have contemplated the possibility that texts could begin life as khass and then be shown to be 'amm, in other words, have their sphere of reference or application widened. But that is exactly what Ibn Qutayba contemplates when he refers, in the passage quoted above from the Mushkil al-Qur'an, to al-qasd bi-lafz al-khusus li-ma'na al-'umum wa-bi-lafz al-'umum li-ma'na al-khusts.62 60 Lecomte has surveyed Ibn Qutayba's hermeneutic techniques, Traite, XX- XLII, and also compared these with Shafii's in his "Evolution de la Controverse," 11-27. As already noted, Melchert has compared both authors' doctrines of abrogation in the above-cited "Qur'anic Abrogation." 61 He seems not to allow the possibility that the Qur'an could make khass a passage from the Sunna which looks, initially, 'amm. This seems to be a scruple retained from the hermeneutics of the Risala. 62 It is interesting that Ibn Qutayba does not give any examples of the 30</page><page sequence="31">A RECONSIDERATION 2. Distinguishing the Sphere of Application: Both authors know how to distinguish apparently contradictory rules by arguing that the rules in question apply in different circumstances (or, we might say, by imagining appropriate contexts). Shafi'i has no consistent technical vocabulary for this type of argument, but it does represent a principal means by which he harmonizes conflicting hadith.63 By contrast, Ibn Qutayba has a recurring phrase which signals this particular strategy, for example in problem 30 (pp. 105-6): li'l-hadlth al-awwal mawdi' wa-li' l-thani mawdi' wa-idha wudi'a kullu wahid minhuma mawdi'ahu zala al-ikhtildf. In this and seven other problems, Ibn Qutayba uses the verb wada'a and cognates to express this idea.64 In fifteen other problems, he uses this technique, but not the root w-d-' (as we saw above in problem 99).65 Most of these problems, whether they use the root in question or not, are of the legal variety. 3. Abrogation: Both authors use the technique of abrogation to harmonize texts, the difference being, however, that Ibn Qutayba allows both intra-source (Qur'an-Qur'an, Sunna-Sunna) abrogation and inter-source (Qur'an-Sunna, Sunna-Qur'an) abrogation whereas Shafi'i expressly disavows the inter-source variety (noted by Calder, Studies, p. 224).66 According to Calder (Studies, p. 221), naskh is one of the three major devices signalled in the Risala (along with transformation of a text from khass to 'amm, though he does give examples of the usual transformation, from 'amm to khass. Mushkil al-Qur'dn, 217-8. 63 See Lowry, "Legal-Theoretical Content," p. 176 and n. 95. 64 Problems 2, 3, 4, 30, 31, 92, 98, 101. 65 Problems 10, 37, 38, 39, 51, 66, 67, 72, 75, 83, 94, 97, 99, 102, 106. 66 See Ta'wil, no. 45 (and also nos. 46, 89,95, and 2; he could have used naskh in no. 42 but did not) and Risala ??314ff. and ?569. Melchert, I think, pays too little attention to this important difference. He attributes Shafi'i's scruple on this point to "simple conservatism: if it were possible for the Qur'an to abrogate the Sunnah, many ordinances based on the Sunnah would have to be thrown away, as one could not be sure that the Qur'anic dicta on these points had not come later." "Qur'anic Abrogation," 86. If simple conservatism accounts for Shafi'i's position, then he could just have easily have worried about the abrogation of the Qur'an by the Sunna, but he does not discuss the possibility. Shafi'i betrays nervousness that the Sunna has not yet established itself fully as legal authority which is co-equal to the Qur'an, whereas Ibn Qutayba evidences no such fear. While it is true that both are engaged to some extent in the defense of the hadith, Shafi'i defends them as the legislative complement to the Qur'an and Ibn Qutayba defends them as an article of faith. This difference seems, to me, to indicate differing polemical contexts and concerns. Zysow takes the view, which I share, that Shafi'i's position aims "to save the prophetic traditions from a blanket rejection." "Economy of Certainty," 142. 31</page><page sequence="32">JOSEPH E. LOWRY 'amm:khass and jumla:nass). Moreover, the Risala's discussion is "sophisticated and nuanced...representing a scholastic subtlety which transcends the basic ad hoc devices of Ibn Qutayba's work" (p. 225, note omitted). It is certainly noteworthy that Shafi'i's notion of abrogation appears narrower than Ibn Qutayba's.67 Interestingly (or ingeniously), Calder sees the more expansive use of naskh in the Ta'wll as the historically earlier stage of development: Shafi'i's concept of naskh, he claims, does less work because it is supplemented by the 'amm:khass technique, which takes over some of the functions required of naskh in the Ta'wll, notably Qur'an-Sunna harmonization. Notwith- standing his strictures on the operation of naskh, Shafi'i is quite clear that naskh frequently involves complex interaction between Qur'an and Sunna.68 4. Permitted/Mandatory Distinction: Both authors also harmonize conflicting legislative texts by distinguishing between rules that are mandatory and rules that are merely optional (as we saw above in the case of the major ablution for the Friday prayer). That is, the contradiction between two rules that provide "do X" and "don't do X," respectively, can be resolved by making one of the two rules optional, so that doing the opposite does not result in a violation of law. The contradiction only obtains if one interprets both rules as mandatory. 5. Hadlth criticism: Both the Risala and the Ta'wll focus on her- meneutic problems arising from the use of hadith. In one problem, Ibn Qutayba labels a hadith "sahlh," sound, because of the "tatdbu' al-riwayat 'an thiqat bihi min wujuh kathira" (problem 52, at p. 138; quoted by Calder, Studies, p. 224). This turn of phrase seems to refer to recurrent, parallel transmissions. It is unclear to me, however, whether this phrase refers to both uninterrupted isnads (tatdbu' al- riwdyat) and their parallel recurrence ('an wujuh kathira) or solely to the existence of parallel recurrence.69 My guess, and Lecomte's 67 As we saw above, Ibn Qutayba also arguably has a more expansive version of the 'amm:khdss technique. 68 Shafi'i says that instances of intra-Qur'anic abrogation are known from indicants in the Sunna (Risala ?608), and rejects the cruder view of his interlocutor that abrogation may be employed to remedy apparent conflict between Qur'an and Sunna (Risala ??610-11). 69 According to Lane, tataba'a means to be or become uninterrupted, so tatdbu' could be expected to refer to an isnad in that sense. Lexicon, 295. But G.H.A. Juynboll has recently identified taba'a and mutdbi'at as technical terms of hadith 32</page><page sequence="33">A RECONSIDERATION position, is that he is referring to both.70 However that may be, it is not a recurring turn of phrase in the Ta'wll, though the term sahlh does recur. Ibn Qutayba has no term for the opposite of recurrent reports, isolate reports (akhbar ahad), though he does turn briefly to hadith criticism in his introduction to the Ta'wll (tr. pp. 73-4; pp. 45-6). There he argues that a report may be established by as few as one veracious transmitter (yuthbat al-khabar bi'l-wahid al-sadiq), using a phrase that at least echoes the technical phrase khabar al- wahid (Calder, Studies, p. 224, holds that the Ta'wll does not know the term khabar al-wahid, though it does have a "basic terminology for the description of hadith").71 One may at least agree with Calder's assessment (Studies, p. 224, n. 4) that Ibn Qutayba does not have a systematic set of criteria for evaluation of the formal properties (as opposed to the content) of hadlths.72 But then, none of the interlocutors' objections in the Ta'wll concern a hadith's pedigree (not surprisingly- that would be to concede Ibn Qutayba's major premise), so there would have been no reason for Ibn Qutayba to invoke the concepts of tawatur or akhbar ahad (though he does reject a few hadiths as inauthentic; e.g., problems 74, 80, and 88). Shafi'i's Risala deals relatively extensively with hadlth criticism (??998-1308). He has a concept of recurrence, expressed in one passage by the verbs tawatara and tazahara (Risala ? 1190; Calder, Studies, p. 224, claims that he does not know the term tawatur), and also criticism that refer to recurrent but slightly less authoritative lines of transmission, specifically the creation of alternative "diving" isnads. "(Re)Appraisal of Some Technical Terms in Hadith Science," Islamic Law and Society 8 (2001), 303-49, at 315-22. 70 Lecomte, Traite, 229, thinks that Ibn Qutayba is referring both to complete and recurrent isnads: "transmission ininterrompue par des chaines d'autorites diverses." 71 'Isa b. Aban (d. ca. 220/835) is said to have authored a work entitled Kitdb khabar al-wahid, a fact which tends to undermine Calder's suggestion that the term post-dates Ibn Qutayba. The work is listed in Muhammad b. Ish.q al-Nadim, Kitdb al-Fihrist, 2d ed., ed. R. Tajaddud (Tehran: Marvi, n.d.), 258. Al-Nadim also notes there that 'Isa b. Aban was polemically engaged with the doctrines of Shafi'i. On 'Isa's critique of Shafi'i, see now M. Bedir, "An Early Response to Shafi'i: 'Isa b. Aban on the Prophetic Report (Khabar)," Islamic Law and Society 9 (2002): 285-311. 72 He is aware that there are general problems attending the vagaries of transmission, some of which he lists in problem 82 (at p. 176). Shafi'i, too, is aware of such problems, but believes that they can be guarded against by carefully weighing the probity of individual transmitters. See, e.g., Risdla ??1001ff., 1009, 1251-2. See also Lowry, "Legal-Theoretical Content," 195-202. 33</page><page sequence="34">JOSEPH E. LOWRY uses the phrase khabar al-wahid and cognate terminology fre- quently. More usual for Shafi'i, however, is the vague phrase al-sunna al-mujtama' 'alayhd (e.g., Ris. ??1815-6), which indicates widespread acceptance (perhaps a synonym for what other authors call mashhur). In addition, Shafi'i has terminology for describing the completeness of isndds: mursal and munqati' for incomplete isnads and muttasil for complete ones (Risala ??1262-8). Finally, Shafi'i has a list of criteria for choosing between competing hadiths and these involve isnad criticism and a few other matters, such as doctrinal similarity to passages in the Qur'an (Risala ??778-82). Ibn Qutayba, it should also be noted, offers a tripartite hermeneutic typology of hadith: (1) those brought by the angel Gabriel, containing fundamental legal rules (usul); (2) those which God permits Mu- hammad to institute (sunna abaha allah lahu [= Muhammad] an yasunnaha) and in which Muhammad may employ his judgment (isti'mal ra'yihi) in order to create exceptions and special dispensations for cause (yatarakhkhas fha li-man yasha' 'ala hasab al-'illa wa'l- 'udhr); and (3) those which Muhammad instituted for the sake of inculcating manners (ta'dib) and urging supererogatory acts entailing reward (fadlla) (Ta'wil, problem 46, pp. 132-5). This typology rests on a notion of descending degrees of legal force, ranging from the mandatory, to the potentially omissible or excusable, to the optional but edifying.73 Interestingly, Ibn Qutayba implies that Muhammad's role as (human) initiator of such sunan stands in an inverse relation to the strictness of the legal obligation which they impose. Shafi'i, too, claims that revealed texts may have gradations of legal force, from the mandatory to the merely edifying. He elaborates this idea specifically in relation to prohibitions in hadlths (Risala ??926- 60) and also more generally in relation to the Qur'an (Risala ? 127- 30, 1469).74 6. Ijtihad: Ibn Qutayba allows ijtihad and offers a defense of it in problem 27 (pp. 99-101). He acknowledges that God may reward 73 This same typology appears in Ibn Qutayba's Kitdb al-Ashriba, ed. Y.M. al-Sawwas (Beirut: Dar al-Fikr, 1998), 115-6, but with the Qur'an occupying the place of sunan brought by Gabriel (for those using a different edition than mine, this typology appears at the beginning of Ibn Qutayba's conclusion, which is preceded by the subtitle "'adl al-qawlfi al-sharab" in my edition, and begins with the sentence "Wa-amma ma nadhhab ilayhi wa-narahu 'adlan min al-qawl." 74 I discuss this aspect of ShfiWl's hermeneutics in my forthcoming article, "The Reception of Shafi'i's Concept of amr and nahy in the Thought of his Student al-Muzani." 34</page><page sequence="35">A RECONSIDERATION exercises of ijtihdd that do not attain an objectively correct result (sawdb), and insists (against a Mu'tazili position?)75 that there is no necessary correlation between the relative exertions of mujtahids and their divine rewards. He also allows, in another passage, the possibility of legal disagreement (ikhtilcf) in regard to details of positive law (furu'), but does not connect that idea with ijtihad (tr. pp. 16-17; p. 13).76 Shafi'i insists on ijtihad as an indispensable part of legal theory and practice and offers a detailed description and justification of it which is methodologically self-conscious and epistemologically sophisticated (Risala ??1321-1670). For Shafi'i, ijtihdd and qiyas are functionally and semantically equivalent (Risala ?1324) whereas Ibn Qutayba repeatedly denounces qiyas (Ta'wil, e.g., p. 14, tr. p. 17).77 Both Shafi'i and Ibn Qutayba dislike istihsan intensely (Ta'wil, e.g., p. 14, tr. p. 17; Risala, e.g., ?1456). According to Calder (Studies, p. 226), Ibn Qutayba is "clearly unaware of the more sophisticated defence [of ijtihad] made available in the Risala." Certainly, Shafi'i's discussion of ijtihad is more sophisticated than Ibn Qutayba's, but a defense of ijtihad is hardly of central importance to the overall argument presented in the Ta'wll. 7. Ta'wll. "Technique" is probably too generous a word for de- scribing what is involved in ta'wll. It is the name Ibn Qutayba gives, in a number of problems, to ad hoc, individualized readings of texts, words, etc. (see, e.g., Ta'wil, problem 51, pp. 137-8). In many problems, he offers readings of this type, but without identifying his procedure as a ta'wil. Shafi'i knows the term, too, in the sense of an individualized interpretation of a passage or word, and uses it occasionally (e.g., Risala, ?904). As signalled in the title of his work (Ta'wll Mukhtalif al-Hadlth), the notion and the term play a considerably more important role for Ibn Qutayba than for Shafi'i. Finally, there is a terminological overlap that probably does not rise to the level of a hermeneutic technique. Both authors use the root z-h-r to characterize the apparent or plain (pre-interpretive) meaning of texts (Risala, e.g, ??557-8; Ta'wll, e.g., problem 34, pp. 112-13). 75 Zysow, "Economy of Certainty," 463-83 (esp. 466 and 468), shows that the Mu'tazila were resolutely infallibilist in regard to the result of ijtihad. 76 His point is that disagreement in regard to the details of positive law is permissible, but not disagreement in regard to matters of theological doctrine. 77 See also Lecomte, Ibn Qutayba, 256-7. 35</page><page sequence="36">JOSEPH E. LOWRY Techniques Known Only to Ibn Qutayba Ibn Qutayba knows a number of techniques that are not found in Shafi'i's Risala. Not surprisingly, perhaps, these techniques are most useful for sorting out apparent conflicts among hadiths with a dogmatic content, or for interpreting away or discarding hadiths identified as doctrinally repugnant. 1. Language and Figures of Speech: Several of Ibn Qutayba's techniques focus on language and might be termed literary-critical as opposed to legal-hermeneutical. As Calder implies (Studies, pp. 225-6), Ibn Qutayba is at his best when resolving interpretive diffi- culties by invoking the notion of figurative language. This represents by far the most common technique to which he resorts in the Ta'wil and it is employed in some 33 problems altogether, 7 of which use various recurring technical terms. These include (as Calder has noted, Studies, p. 225), the verb kanna, as well as tashblh, tamthdl, takhyil and Imad.78 On two occasions, he uses the term haqlqa,79 but in the Ta'wil he never uses the term majaz.80 Ibn Qutayba also occasionally appeals more generally to idiomatic usage to explain away troubling phrases, invoking the notion of kaldm al-'arab.81 Shafi'i, too, appeals to the irreducibly idiomatic usage of the Arabs, identifying 'amm and khass, and jumla, as linguistic phenomena unique to Arabic (Risala ??173, 425),82 but such appeals are not generally a means for inter- preting individual texts. Ibn Qutayba also, on a few occasions, asserts that the Qur'an, and also other texts, express ideas in abbreviated form (ikhtisdr, hadhf) and he even uses the term jumla in one instance (problem 34) as a synonym for ikhtisar. Jumla is found in the Risala, 78 I decline to translate these. Ibn Qutayba never employs them in such a way that their specific senses could be deduced, or explains what they mean, but rather only lists them as characteristics of texts he analyzes. See, e.g., problem 33 (pp. 110-2). 79 In problems 87 and 96 he denies that certain texts are meant veridically (haqiqa). 80 As we have seen, he does use the term in the Mushkil al-Qur'an. Heinrichs notes that Ibn Qutayba sometimes uses majaz to mean figurative language, and sometimes to mean idiomatic figures of speech. "Genesis," 130-2; "Contacts," 255-8. See below. 81 For example, in problem 63 (pp. 151-2) he adduces the pre-Islamic usage of the word dahr in order to excuse an embarrassing formulation in a hadith that equates God with dahr. 82 On this aspect of Shafi'i's thought, see now Sherman Jackson, "Fiction and Formalism: Toward a Functional Analysis of Usul al-fiqh," in: Studies in Islamic Legal Theory, ed. Weiss, 177-201. 36</page><page sequence="37">A RECONSIDERATION but in a very precise sense, meaning a "general rule the details of which are found elsewhere" (see below). Calder rightly notes that the Risala "shows no (overt) interest in the category of the non-literal" (Studies, p. 225), and goes on to say that "[t]he single category which is signalled in Ibn Qutayba and not developed in the Risala is that of the non-literal, covering allusion, simile, and metaphor" (Studies, p. 226). Of course, this difference reflects precisely the fact that Ibn Qutayba deals mostly with dogma and Shafi'i exclusively with law. 2. Bi-la kayf: Ibn Qutayba occasionally trots out the phrase bi-la kayf or equivalents, especially when defending hadlths against the charge that they involve anthropomorphism (tashblh) (e.g., problem 52, pp. 138-41).83 This phrase is not in the Risala, which in general has little time for the usual problems or terminology of early Muslim theological debate.84 Techniques Known Only to Shdfi'i The techniques and rubrics known to Shafi'i but not, apparently, to Ibn Qutayba in his Ta'wll Mukhtalif al-Hadlth are the following: 1. Jumla:Nass: In general, this is a means for harmonizing Qur'an and hadlth. Passages in the Qur'an labeled jumla contain a general but undefined obligation (e.g., aqlmu al-saldt!) the details of which are supplied by hadiths. Passages that do not require to be supple- mented by another text (that is, are hermeneutically self-sufficient), are labeled nass. As we have seen, Ibn Qutayba uses jumla on one occasion as a synonym for ikhtisdr, that is, in his vocabulary describing idiomatic usages (here brevity). Calder rightly notes that jumla and associated terms have, in the Risala, "a significantly more structured role than in Ibn Qutayba's work" (Studies, p. 225), and he identifies it as one of the three major devices signalled in the Risala (along with 'amm:khass and naskh) (Studies, p. 241).85 83 For an excellent brief overview of this term and its history, with references, see Josef Van Ess, Theologie und Gesellschaft im 2. und 3. Jahrhundert Hidschra, 6 vols. (Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 1991-1997), v. 4, 418-9. 84 The only technical vocabulary it uses from early theological debates is predestinarian, and then only in connection with the structure of the law (which is foreordained), not in connection with the usual problems of the predestinarian debate. See Lowry, "Legal-Theoretical Content," 399-414. 85 One might quarrel, however, with Calder's claim that jumal and cognates are connected with words derived from the root b-y-n (Studies, p. 225). Nass and very occasionally mufassar are opposed to jumla/jumal, but, more importantly, 37</page><page sequence="38">JOSEPH E. LOWRY 2. Amr:Nahy: Shafi'i has a theoretical account of God's prohibition (nahy, Risala ?? 926-60) and a hermeneutic rule concerning divine commands and prohibitions (?591: they are to be construed as absolute in the absence of other textual evidence). He also groups together problems involving commands and prohibitions (Risala ??846-925) as part of a larger treatment of contradictory hadiths (ahadlth mukhta- lifa, discussed at Risala ??7120-925).86 The notion that texts may appear contradictory, at least, is prominently signalled in the title of Ibn Qutayba's Ta'wil. 3. Qiyas: As already noted, Shafi'i considers qiyas the equivalent of ijtihad whereas Ibn Qutayba allows ijtihad but considers qiyas something highly suspect. For Shafi'i, qiyds is highly regulated and generally limited to two varieties, qiyds based on a shared policy reason (ma'na) and qiyas based on superficial similarity (shabah) (see Risala ??122-5, 1334). Finally, Calder points out that Ibn Qutayba is unaware of Shafi'i's "painstaking distinction between two types of knowledge" (Studies, p. 226; see also pp. 241-2).87 Calder is surely right about this, but since Shafifi's is not the epistemology of later usul al-fiqh, it is not clear that its absence from the Ta'wil is significant. V. Conclusions: The Risala, the Ta'wll, and Islamic Legal Theory Major differences between the Risala and the Ta'wll in purpose and content render a comparison such as that undertaken by Calder subject to certain qualifications. The Risala offers an all-encompassing legal hermeneutic whereas the Ta'wll offers a theologically driven defense of individual hadith. As a result, only a relatively small part of the Ta'wil concerns legal hermeneutics. A comparison of the two works' legal hermeneutics, the word bayan has a special role all its own in the Risala. See, e.g., my "Does Shafi'i Have a Theory of Four Sources of Law?" in: Studies in Islamic Legal Theory, ed. Weiss, 23-50, at 45-50. 86 On this aspect of Shafi'i's legal thought see my forthcoming article, "The Reception of Shaficl's Concept of amr and nahy in the Thought of his Student al- Muzani." 87 The distinction in question-between knowledge of matters unproblematic and accessible to all Muslims and knowledge of difficult matters requiring the intervention of specialists-is developed by Calder in an excellent article, "Ikhtilaf and Ijma' in Shafi'i's Risala," Studia Islamica 58 (1983), 55-81. See also Lowry, "Legal-Theoretical Content," 317-61. 38</page><page sequence="39">A RECONSIDERATION though possible, yields evidence that can be difficult to interpret. On the one hand, in terms of the actual problems analyzed and techniques used to address them, the two texts exhibit considerable overlap. On the other hand, both texts know and employ techniques and technical terms which are unknown to the other. And given that the whole point of the Risala, quite unlike that of the Ta'wll, seems to be to offer a comprehensive account of the architecture of the divine law, it is hardly surprising that its approach to legal matters appears more sophisticated than that of the Ta'wll. One might also add that the prose style of the Ta'wil seems more fluid and developed than that of the Risala, which latter proceeds in a dense, archaic Arabic. Such equivocal evidence, drawn from a narrow and heavily qualified comparison, hardly compels the conclusion that the texts are so dissimilar as to require a reversal of their traditional datings.88 Dating and ascription aside, it may be interesting to consider the relationship of these two works in terms of the history of usul al- fiqh. In two masterful articles tracing the history of the terms haqlqa and majdz, Wolfhart Heinrichs shows how the term majaz originates as a device of paraphrastic exegesis among grammarians and Qur'an exegetes, and then develops two specialized senses: that of "idiomatic expression" and that of "figurative language."89 Most relevant for present purposes is Heinrichs' discussion of Ibn Qutayba's use of the term majaz. Ibn Qutayba uses the term in both senses, that is, in ways traceable to the grammar-tafslr tradition ("idiomatic expression"), but also in ways influenced by the theologians (specifically by the Mu'tazila-"figurative language").90 In the sense of "figurative language," majdz then ends up becoming a stock technical term, and issue, in classical works on usul al-fiqh.91 Without wishing to claim Ibn Qutayba as a major progenitor of classical usul al-fiqh, it is nonetheless striking that, in regard to the term majaz, he lies on a line of development originating with the grammar-tafslr tradition, affected by theological debates, and pointing toward mature usul al-fiqh. Shafi'i, by contrast, does not invoke or 88 Neither do they appear to me similar enough to require that they be roughly contemporaneous, as Melchert has argued. "Qur'anic Abrogation," 92-3. 89 See his "Genesis" and "Contacts," cited above. Inevitably, I have somewhat oversimplified Heinrichs's presentation of a complex matter. 90 "Genesis," 132; "Contacts," 257-8. 91 See generally the two articles by Heinrichs, as well as Hallaq, History of Islamic Legal Theories, 42-3. 39</page><page sequence="40">JOSEPH E. LOWRY have much use for a concept of figurative or veridical language in the Risala. Above, I suggested that Ibn Qutayba's usage of the root kh-s-s also stems from the grammar-tafsir tradition, and that it more resembles the usage of mature usul al-fiqh than does Shafi'i's use of the term. In this regard, too, Ibn Qutayba's Ta'wil seems to lie on a route that bypasses Shafi'l's Risala. One might also add that Ibn Qutayba's concept of abrogation (allowing both inter- and intra-source abrogation) is more consistent with later usul al-fiqh than is Shafi'i's much narrower concept of the functioning of abrogation.92 Finally, Shafi'i mostly ignores theological issues, whereas a relatively wide range of standard theological problems appears in Ibn Qutayba's Ta'wil, especially in the non-legal problems, which take up the balance of his discussion.93 Later usul al-fiqh is clearly a literature by and for theologians. Lest it be thought that I am portraying Ibn Qutayba's Ta'wil as the precursor to usul al-fiqh, it is also worth noting the following global similarity between the Risala and the Ta'wll: Both proceed, mostly, by offering discrete example problems in which hermeneutic techniques are employed to reach a desired result. To this extent, both works proceed inductively rather than deductively. Works on classical usul al-fiqh proceed deductively and dispense, for the most part, with in-depth examinations of discrete legal or textual problems. Still, Ibn Qutayba combines an interest in language, grammar and exegesis with a sensitivity to theological debates, a passable knowledge of current legal issues, and a perspective conditioned (very strongly in his case) by the increasing importance of the ahl al-hadith.94 These considerations seem, paradoxically perhaps, to suggest that Ibn Qutayba stood much closer in his concerns in the Ta'wil to the mix of elements that gave rise to classical usul al-fiqh than did Shafi'i in the Risala. This is not to say that the Risala had no effect (however 92 E.g., Weiss, Search for God's Law, 533-4. 93 This does not mean, however, that Shafi'i did not aim his Risala squarely at kaldm, but rather that he wished to offer a systematic alternative to it. See G. Makdisi, "The Juridical Theology of al-Shafi'i: Origins and Significance of usul al-fiqh," Studia Islamica 59 (1984), 5-47. Shafi'i's account is, however more structural than methodological and so represents an alternative account of the functioning of revelation rather than an alternative methdology. 94 For the traditionists' contribution to the formation of the Islamic legal tradition, see Melchert, "Traditionist-Jurisprudents and the Framing of Islamic Law," Islamic Law and Society 8:3 (2001), 383-406. 40</page><page sequence="41">A RECONSIDERATION attenuated) on the formation of classical usil al-fiqh, but rather to point out the somewhat surprising fact that certain foreshadowings of usul al-fiqh appear more in evidence in Ibn Qutayba's relatively unsystematic Ta'wdl. This picture would accord with the traditional ascription and dating of both works.95 However that may be, both Shafi'i and Ibn Qutayba welcome and combine, though in their own ways, the intellectualism of the ahl al-kaldm with the textual postulates of hadlth-piety.96 What is interesting about the two works considered in this article is how differently they combine these two trends while remaining, at least in hindsight, within a common intellectual tradition from which Sunnism emerged. 95 It would also seem to confirm, to some extent, Hallaq's conclusions that Shafi'i's legal thought was ignored for several decades and not immediately relevant to the development of the science of usul al-fiqh.
