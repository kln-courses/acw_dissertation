<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS occurrences make a causal difference. This more restrictive version of MOVE would explain why the basic physical sciences are able to yield a privileged description of the world and provide an objective basis for the projectibility of natural kind predicates in causal laws. It also reveals a clear rationale for reject- ing (2) and GSV, if one is serious about augmenting one's ontology to include mental events. But Pietroski himself is ambivalent, wanting his theory to com- port equally with Davidsonian Nominalism. This, of course, makes it difficult to find a causal role for properties, let alone to ground naturalness. And in fact, Pietroski denies that causal claims can be sensitive to type-descriptions (96f.). Lacking a robust conception of properties, his proposed sufficient condition for event causation in terms of explanation (basically ceteris paribus laws, nota- bly involving those couched in intentional terms) must remain circular, as he himself admits (219). Barring projectivism, ceteris paribus laws are explanatory only if they relate events as cause and effect. Hence, relying on ceteris paribus laws to launch a defense of event dualism (3.2) presumably has little force against a physicalist, while it is dispensable for one committed at the outset to Strawsonian personal dualism (220-34). Let us take stock. Pietroski's commitment with respect to (1) is considerably higher than your usual NRP-type dualism, but the benefit is the same: mental causation is possible only as ersatz causation. That is clearly a negative payoff. Why even put dualism in, if ersatzism is all you can get out? Conversely, if you are a dualist, why downplay the causal relevance of the mental, salvaging (2) while rejecting (5)? Despite many intriguing suggestions and lines of thought throughout Pietroski's dense and varied discussion, Causing Actions disap- points through its failure to effectively answer these challenges. GEORG THEINER and TIMOTHY O'CONNOR Indiana University The Philosophical Review, Vol. 111, No. 2 (April 2002) R. J. Hankinson, Cause and Explanation in Ancient Greek Thought. Oxford: Ox- ford University Press, 1998 Pp. ix, 499. This is a book of prodigous proportions. It is intended as nothing less than a fully comprehensive treatment of every important discussion of its two princi- pal topics in ancient Greek texts from the works of Homer until the closing of the philosophical schools in the sixth century A.D. Moreover, Hankinson's sources are not limited just to philosophical writers; he also deftly extracts def- inite positive views on these subjects from the ancient medical literature (both before and after the classical period) as well as from the quasi-legal discourses of the fifth century B. C. sophistical movement. But this is no pedestrian lock- 294</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS step survey governed mechanically by chronological order. To the contrary, various subthemes are constantly interwoven throughout, as issues raised in earlier chapters reappear to be developed and augmented in later ones, which gives the progression of the book as a whole a rich and nuanced character. Some of these subthemes involve the evolution of ancient attitudes toward various "meta-principles" of explanation, such as the Principle of Causal Syn- onymy (that one thing cannot cause another to acquire a given property with- out itself possessing that property), or the better known Principle of Sufficient Reason. In the case of the latter, Hankinson focuses especially on its role in a distinctive style of ancient argumentation to the effect that if there are no prin- cipled reasons for deciding among some group of alternative possibilities, the correct inference to draw is that none of them is true on the grounds that each is "no more" (ou mallon) likely than the others. Yet other recurring topics involve such recognizable and familiar philosophical issues as the emergence of compatibilism as a response to the problem of free will and determinism, or the (distinctively Aristotelian) project of staking out a reasonable middle ground between the blind mechanistic theories of the Presocratics and the most blatantly anthropomorphic form of teleological explanation in terms of conscious intention and purpose. Curiously, Hankinson associates this latter position with Plato by taking the postulation of the demiurge in the Timaeus as a fixed point of Platonic doctrine. Although Hankinson does point to a sup- porting passage for this attribution from the Phaedo (97b-99d, where Socrates rails against the theories of Anaxagoras for leaving out of account such things as intentions, beliefs, and desires), one is left to wonder, if Hankinson is cor- rect, why there is no whisper of it in such central middle-period works as the Republic, Phaedrus, or Symposium. Inevitably, readers with some knowledge of the ancient sources will want to second-guess some of Hankinson's decisions about what to include and what to omit. This merely reflects what should be a comforting thought, that no two scholars could write the same book on the same subject, especially one of this breadth. Indeed, in his preface Hankinson openly acknowledges the occa- sional instance of liberality, explaining that it was difficult always to stay on the meta-level and discuss views about causation and explanation without descend- ing into particular explanations or particular views about what causes what. One wonders, however, whether he is sometimes led too far astray from his cen- tral concerns by a patently false "transitivity of relatedness" principle. There are also occasions where the rationale for inclusion is apparently that Hankinson has published important work on these peripheral subjects, and understand- ably wants to give his readers at least an overview of that earlier work. This seems to be the case with his discussion of some key fragments of Parmenides in chapter 1, and also in chapter 6 when he pauses to defend a charitable inter- pretation of Epicurus's notorious "atomic swerve" doctrine. Although these discussions are digressive and sometimes difficult to follow because they are so 295</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS compressed (one can almost hear the word counter ticking), their inclusion is not especially deleterious, since they are easy enough to skip over, and inter- ested readers can follow Hankinson's generous bibliographic leads to pursue these topics further for themselves. As for omissions, Hankinson evidently aimed for an evenness of treatment over the entire period covered, since he devotes only three chapters to Plato and Aristotle combined. It is therefore to be expected that he had to be much more selective in his discussions of these two prolific authors. Even so, the absence of discussion of the third section of the Theaetetus and the theory of demonstration set out in the PosteriorAnalytics stands out as especially puzzling, since these seem to be the places where their respective authors give their most sustained treatment of cause and explanation. Incidentally, it is also a bit suprising that Hankinson doesn't make mention of a well-known argument attributed by Aristotle (at Physics 3.204b.23-29) to certain unnamed thinkers- -the reference is possibly to Anaximander-that if any of the mutually opposed four elements were the unique and unlimited first principle, the remaining three, being finite, would, contrary to observed fact, long since have ceased to exist. What makes this omission particularly strking is that one of Hankinson's objectives is to chart the history of distinctive ancient patterns of argu- mentation, and he is evidently concerned in chapter 6 with just this style of reason- ing (generally put, that any postulated process that ultimately leads to some irreversible, "terminal" state of the cosmos should be rejected on the grounds that there is no reason why that terminal state should not have already come to pass). Such respectful demurrers do not detract in the least from my high estima- tion of this formidable book. Hankinson's discussions in every chapter are clear and plausible, and generally convincing. However, I believe the strongest and most valuable parts of the book are those dealing with the medical writers and the various post-Aristotelian philosophical schools. This is partly because these authors have received comparatively less scholary attention than others, so there was so much fundamental exigesis work yet to be done on them. How- ever, it is principally because these are the areas where so many of Hankinson's important past scholarly contributions have occurred, which makes it gratify- ing to have records of those contributions bound within a single cover. This is not really a book to be read through from cover to cover (unless one happens to have an encyclopedic mind like Hanksinson's). Rather, it should serve as an absolutely invaluable reference tool for ancient philosophers, his- torians of science, and students of antiquity more generally. As suggested above, anyone familiar with these topics will likely find something to disagree with in this book. However, it is inconceivable that there could be more than a small handful of scholars who won't find a tremendous amount to learn from it. MICHAEL FEREJOHN Duke University 296</page></plain_text>
