WITMER With the advent of the relativity theory science has entered a transformative period in which previous certainties are undergoing critical scrutiny and renova- tion. Critical movements in science arise at periods of its history when its foundations are brought into question. True it is that natural philosophers still regard science as a growing body of propositions dealing with natural events enabling them to find the structural laws of theexternalworld. But this "external world" about them changes in significance, interpretation, anld meaning as new epoch-making theories are propounded and experimental verification of some of their consequences tend to give them scientific plausibility. Although there is little or no difference of opinion among scientists and phi- losophers concerning the experimental aspects of scientific method there is, how- ever, considerable disagreement as regards the significance and evolution of scientific theories. We have on the one hand, the point of view which regards the well-established concepts and theories of science as inherently immutable. This conception of science, though no longer tenable, bases itself on an implicit materialist metaphysics according to which such basic concepts as space, time, mass, etc., are copies of things as they are. This materialistic metaphysics, dating as far back as Democritus, is but a conceptual refinement of the common- sense notions of every-day experience. The certainty associated with such concepts as matter, space, and time, is due largely to our feeling that these are self-evident, and hence, unchallengeable and irreducible. Such an orientation may be designated as the materialistic conception of science according to which there are basic concepts and principles that will never be altered regardless of the increase of the sum total of our knowledge and the extent of development of scientific theories. Save for a few exceptions, notably that of Ernest Mach, the materialistic conception of science was adhered to tenaciously by all scientific thinkers up to the birth of the relativity theory. It was the positivistic philosopher Mach who as early as 1868 in undertaking to rid the science of mechanics of metaphysical superfluities, challenged the concepts of absolute space and absolute motion as being incompatible with experimental procedure. In his own words, "No one is competent to predicate things about absolute space and absolute motion; they are pure things of thought, pure mental constructs that cannot be produced in experience. All our principles of mechanics are, as we have shown in detail, 275</page><page sequence="2">2Y76 ERWIN BISER AND ENOS E. WITMER experimental knowledge concerning the relative positions and motions of bodies. Even in the provinces in which they are now recognized as valid, they could not, and were not, admitted without previously being subjected to experimental tests. No one is warranted in extending these principles beyond the boundaries of experience. In fact, such an extension is meaningless, as no one possesses the requisite knowledge to make use of it" (1). He also undertook to define mass by means of actual experiments (2), as against the view of Galileo and Newton who, basing themselves on the hypothesis of the homogeneity of matter, defined mass as a "quantity of matter." Clerk Maxwell in his theory of heat took the same positivistic position with regard to temperature. It may be said in passing that Mach's criticisms paved the way towards the development of the ideas that led Einstein to his concept of simultaneity, and that Mach's ideas concerning the ether found their fruition in the general relativity theory (3). There is, on the other hand, a point of view necessitated by the recent develop- ments in physical theories that even our most basic and supposedly "self-evident" concepts and principles may be discaxded, revised, supplemented, or even re- placed by others, in order to obtain conformity with experimental facts. This view regards science as a dynamic movement cLunulative in its evolution, and comprised of approximate scientific patterns coming nearer to the world of reality by the route of successive approximations. On this conception of science, each physical theory grows out, so to speak, of the preceding ones which surely possessed workability and predictive value, tending towards more general prin- ciples compatible with experience. It would follow that the relation between fact and theory is reciprocal, functional, and experimentally mediated. Science, thus studied from the historical perspective subjects its very founda- tions and principles to critical and positivistic (experimental) analysis and possi- ble transformation. The historic point of reference allows us by regressive steps to explain the intrinsic worth, meaning, and significance of physical theories in the evolution of scientific thought. The notion of successive approximation leads us to look upon experiment and theory as being not absolutely separable as some Kantians would have us believe. On the contrary, the historic point of view tends to confirm our thesis that interaction and reciprocity between fact and theory are working towards the attainment of the physical real by successive approximations both in the conceptual and quantitative domains and towards the ultimate goal of identifying the real with the true. Though we commend positiv- ism for its emphasis on experimental procedure, we do not accept it in its entirety, since it is our belief that the concept of the external world cannot possibly be eliminated from any epistemological reflections concerning the fundamental subject-matter of science. These ideas are, to be sure, implicit in the thinking of modern theoretical physicists. Unfortunately the new ideas that have been shown to afford us a better and more precise ordering of reality, have not entered the critical con- sciousness of some scientists and philosophers who still choose to think in terms</page><page sequence="3">METHODOLOGY OF RESEARCH AND PROGRESS IN SCIENCE 277 of the materialistic conception of science, alluded to in our preceding reflections. In the "General Schema for Natural Systems" it was shown that no scientific pattern is conducive to dogmatism and finality in so far as even the most general and invariant physical theories can give only approximate answers to the most well-defined questions of fact (4). The approximate character of the answers afforded by a theory varies greatly from one case to another; in some instances the agreement between experiment and theory is very close indeed. But in others there are very large discrepancies due to the fact that every theory has only a limited field of applicability and to the impossibility of absolutely isolating natural processes in experimental work. The concept of successive approximation of physical theories suggests itself as a result of the historic growth of science. In this sense we may state that this concept is arrived at as a consequence of applying the method of induction on the conceptual level. The frequency with which physical theories have undergone transformation down to their most "self-evident" basic notions and principles tends to substantiate our theses: 1. That the idea of progress implicit in the motivation and technique of scien- tific investigation must now be extended to the foundations of science itself. 2. That the history of scientific thought offers an implicit definition of progress and suggests the criteria by means of which it shall be diagnosed and ascertained. It should be borne in mind that progress need not limit itself to mere accumula- tions of observable facts, but extends to the conceptual and theoretical formu- lations as well. For it cannot be too strongly emphasized that progress in the development of basic concepts and theories is not independent of progress of science in general; but is complementary to the growth of experimental data and the attempt to systematize these data in adequate theories. We do not wish to create the impression that it is possible to lay down rigid a priori principles to guide the further development of science for all time. To do this would indeed be at variance with the changes scientific theory has under- gone in the last fifty years. At this point we take issue with P. W. Bridgman who hopes "to understand so thoroughly the character of our permanent mental relations to nature that another change in our attitude such as that due to Einstein shall be forever impossible" (5) (Italics ours). This attitude presupposes-and quite dogmatically-that no future develop- ment of science will affect our conception of our mental relations to nature. No philosophic point of view is completely satisfactory or ever will be, not even positivism, which seems to enjoy considerable vogue among physicists, especially quantum-physicists. There is, and quite naturally so, a continual interaction between science and philosophy so that at any given stage in the development of scientific theory certain "Weltanschaungen" are compatible with existing science. A thought of similar vein was expressed in the "Schema" to the effect that "the curve of philosophic development is to run parallel to that of the evolution of scientific patterns" (6). This in fact means that no "Weltanschaung" can last forever but will come into contradiction with crucial discoveries and theories;</page><page sequence="4">278 ERWIN BISER AND ENOS E. WITMER hence no philosophic orientation is possible which will ensure the scientist against overlooking crucial features in the problems with which he is dealing. In the sequel we address ourselves to the processes and methods by means of which progress in science is consummated. The concrete examples cited to illustrate our theses are taken from the evolution of physical theories. Although these examples are taken from physics because it is the most highly developed of all the natural sciences, it is believed and hoped that some of these methods may be applicable to other sciences as well. The Urge for Unity So pervading is the concept of unity throughout the evolution of human thought and activity, that it is our contention that this urge is the most propulsive factor working towards progress in science. The gamut of human endeavor certainly would not exclude the social and economic factors in the pursuit of scientific investigations. It would indeed be a truism to mention the fact that, were it not for the industrial revolution with the concomitant strides in the advancement of technology, modern science would not be what it is today. In this paper we are concerned primarily with the conceptual factors and processes involved in the transformation of physical theory in its goal towards unity. The role of instrumental technique and its influence on theoretical thinking is of such capital importance that it deserves individual treatment and discussion. This phase of the problem will be given its due place in our subsequent reflections. Has it not been the ideal of philosophers and scientists of all ages to create a unitary schema embracing all actual and possible phenomena of the external world as well as of the world of ideas? In fact it seems to be a natural inclination of man even in the most primitive stages of cultural development to evolve orientations enabling him to order and explain the world about and within him. From the most primitive and superstitious animism to the metaphysical flights of a Bruno or a Spinoza we find the self-same urge going through the struggle towards comprehending the world. The notion of unity and the demand for synthesis is inherent in the very term "orientation." For we mean by a collective or individual orientation of man at a definite cultural level, a set of consequential judgments evolved out of his practical and conceptual contact with segments of nature about him. Each orientation even the most rudimentary and primitive was consistent and self-sufficient in so far as it possessed workability compatible with its cultural level of development. In fact the demand for practical and rational unity is an operative ingredient in any orientation whether it be at the level of sense-perception or at that of a highly formalized scientific pattern of our epoch. One may even extend the notion of unity inherent in an orientation to the behavior-pattern of an animal as it reacts to its environment. It, too, strives to attain workability and "harmony" with its world through a set of expectation-judgments peculiar to its trained capacity and its neurological structure. An orientation tends to become self-perpetuating and closed until new experi- ence compels a revision and a reformulation of older judgments and practices. The history of scientific theories teaches us a great lesson: ideational patterns</page><page sequence="5">METHODOLOGY OF RESEARCH AND PROGRESS IN SCIENCE 279 enjoy a "law of inertia" of their own until new wants, startling inadequacies plus bold and ingenious thought and activity, help to shake them out of their fixity in order to bring about a transformation of an inadequate theory. The tendency of an orientation at the animal level to become self-perpetuating and static is shown by recent experiments on animal behavior (7). Witness the tenacity with which the magical orientation endured up until the ushering in of the scientific point of view; it may be added that the former has not altogether disappeared from our midst. In fact we can still find vestigial footprints of older orientations in our own cultural epoch. The notion of unity takes on such form and content as is compatible with the various cultural levels of human development. At higher levels the urge toward unity takes on a rational aspect. Thus we see the evolution of this concept and urge from rudimentary sensibility through the sense-perceptual level to a de- mand for a unitary rational symbolic representation of reality. The following are some of the methods and processes operative in the pursuit of this goal: Tendency Towards Generalization The efforts towards attaining unity is coextensive with the tendency to form generalizations, i.e., with the tendency to form concepts, for this inclination lies at the basis of language itself. Some thinkers go even so far as to regard this ability as the presupposition of all language. At the higher level of scientific investigation the generalizing tendency takes on a more precise and articulate mode of expression. The establishment of scientific laws can be taken as a common example of this tendency at the level of scientific thought. An example of the process of generalization at the level of scientific theory is the extension of the inverse square law originally discovered by Newton in connection with gravitational phenomena, to the domains of electrostatics and magnetostatics. No doubt, this law influenced investigators who studied the law of force between electric charges and magnetic poles, and their researches led to the establishment of laws equivalent in form to Newton's law of attraction for masses. Analogously to the property of mass in the case of gravitational phenomena the existence of electric substances or fluids was postulated in the case of electrostatic phenomena, and this was found to be in accord with experimental data as known in that period. The concept of electric substances or fluids is an analogical extension of the concept of ordinary matter as dealt with in gravitational theory. This analogy is seldom if ever pointed out in our physics text-books. The natural consequence of the above-mentioned generalization is as follows: Whereas the previous examples served to illustrate instances of generalization at the level of laws, the following will offer instances at the level of theory. On the basis of the inverse square law it follows that the formalism of the gravitational potential theory can be taken over to the domains of electrostatics by substituting charge for mass, electric field strength for acceleration, electrostatic for gravitational potential,</page><page sequence="6">280 ERWIN BISER AND ENOS E. WITMER and such minor changes as are incident to this domain of phenomena, such as surface distribution of charge, and positive and negative signs of charges and forces. Similar remarks apply to the extension of potential theory to the domain of magnetism. Here we substitute pole strength for mass, magnetic potential for gravitational potential, field strength for acceleration, etc. The reader is cautioned not to regard potential theory as a physical theory in the broad sense of the term as it is applied to the domains of electromagnetism and quantum-mechanics, because it involves few assumptions and hypotheses of a physical nature. The previous examples were cited to illustrate how a mathe- matical pattern from a developed domain may find application and extension with little modification to a new domain. The efficacy of such analogical exten- sion can be ascertained only by sufficient experimental investigation. In this sense we can state that generalization at all levels must possess compatibility with experience in order to have physical significance. Isomorphism As physical theory attains a high discriminative level, it may be found that two or more domains of inquiry conform approximately to a theoretical schema of an equivalent or almost equivalent mathematical form. Be it noted that simple isomorphism which in pure mathematics stands for a one to one corre- spondence holding between two or several groups loses its ideal formal rigor when applied to physical fields where complete correspondence is improbable. We shall designate approximate correspondences as occur in physical theory simply isomorphic or, for brevity, isomorphic. An example of this kind of iso- morphism is offered by the classical gravitational theory and electrostatics. In this case the isomorphism is not complete since mass in gravitational theory is always positive, whereas in the latter charge may be either positive or negative; furthermore, in gravitational theory forces are always attractive while in electro- statics either attraction or repulsion is possible as was stated in a previous example. The discovery of approximate isomorphic relations as holding between two physical domains is shown by the evolution of science to be conducive to the development of new theory as is evidenced by the following example. Following the work of de Broglie who first introduced the idea of waves into the mechanics of a particle, E. Schrodinger, in making use of the analogy between the mechanics of a particle and the theory of geometric optics established by Sir William Hamilton, extended this notion by introducing the idea of wave mechan- ics corresponding to wave optics. A more recent example of the efficacy of isomorphism is the application by Bohr of the ideas of thermodynamics to nuclear phenomena. Thus Bohr speaks of the temperature of a nucleus and the evaporation of particles from the nucleus. This isomorphism is, however, not complete since the laws of thermodynamics apply with exactitude only to large statistical aggregates. A new theory can be developed by a vast amount of minute adaptation of an older theory to experimental data until it is possible finally by the process of generalization to recast the fundamental equations and principles of the older</page><page sequence="7">METHODOLOGY OF RESEARCH AND PROGRESS IN SCIENCE 281 theory. One of the most important methods of making progress in theoretical physics is that of taking an existing theory which is admittedly inadequate in furnishing a complete explanation of the phenomena in a given domain, and using it nevertheless to derive relationships which are approximately correct; and then noting what changes have to be made in the formulas so derived in order to obtain exact agreement with experimental data. In this fashion one can bring about a considerable amount of modification in the existing theory, so that a scientist of sufficient sagacity and insight may be able to see what alterations to make in the basic theory in order that the formulas derived from the new theory are valid without supplementary corrections. This is the way the matrix form of quantum mechanics developed. To be sure, the nature of these adaptations to conform to experimental data varies in different cases, depending on the form, content, and history of the theory in question. Thus in the development of the special theory of relativity the works of Lorentz and Poincar6 must be considered as stepping stones to the special theory as propounded by Einstein. Lorentz attempted to modify the existing classical theory in such a way as to account in large measure for the observed facts. He and Fitzgerald assumed that a body moving through the ether underwent a contraction in the direction of its motion depending on the magnitude of the velocity. In this way he obtained the transformation formulas characteristic of the special theory of relativity known as the Lorentz transfor- mation. Einstein, however, made an analysis of the nature of space and time from the positivist point of view and derived this transformation from the two postulates he laid down as the basic principles of the theory of relativity. In the process of adapting the Bohr theory to experimental data it was found necessary to "correct" the formulas derived for the intensity of spectral lines with the aid of the correspondence principle; this was necessary not only from empirical but also from logical considerations. Similar changes were made by Kramers and Heisenberg in the formula for the index of refraction when they replaced orbital-frequencies of the electron by observable frequencies associated with quantum transitions, etc. These changes in individual formulas suggested to Heisenberg the idea that one might avoid making them in the derived formulas by effecting the alterations suggested by the correspondence principle in the basic dynamical variables and the fundamental mathematical operations per- formed upon them. He thus arrived at the schema which came to be known as matrix mechanics. The present phase of our inquiry would demand more than a casual treatment of the problems dealing with the adequacy of physical theories. The notion of adequacy is of such paramount importance to our concept of successive approxima- tion of science that to leave it unmentioned would bring us back to the static conception of science which the experience of physics in our century has compelled us to discard. The concept of adequacy in scientific theories must take into ac- count the following notions: (a) Logical consistency (b) Theoretical adequacy (c) Experimental adequacy.</page><page sequence="8">282 ERWII BISER AND ENOS E. WITMER These three categories exhaust both the theoretical and experimental aspects of physical theory. (a) As to logical consistency we need but stress the fact that a logical or mathematical pattern is either presupposed by or inherent in a well-defined phys- ical theory such as electrodynamics or quantum mechanics. The question of logical consistency is to be decided in each theory by the rules of operation of the mathematical pattern of that theory. In quantum mechanics, for example, we must use non-commutative algebra as well as the operations of differentiation and integration; whereas in classical mechanics ordinary algebra and calculus are used. It is to be noted in this connection that the physical concepts and postulates of a theory must also be considered together with the mathematical scheme in any discussion of logical consistency of such a theory, since these equations must have physical significance. The following point needs special emphasis because of its importance to the philosophy of science, and of its oversight even by competent theoreticians. In many discussions about logical consistency of a physical theory the theoretical schema is critized from an extra-logical point of view i.e., the critic assumes ideas inconsistent with the fundamental concepts and postulates of the theory. In this sense he stands, so to speak, outside of the system he is subjecting to criti- cism. Thus, critics of the special theory of relativity have challenged its con- clusions about the composition of velocities, because the result afforded by the theory did not agree with their common-sense notions. Likewise, critics of quantum-mechanics assail its indeterminacy in the same "extra-logical" fashion. In these cases such criticism is, in our judgment, unsound. However, we do not wish to create the impression that all such criticism is devoid of merit. On the contrary, many epoch-making advances in theory owe their origin to such "extra- logical" critiques, as for instance the well-known example of Mach's criticism of the concepts of absolute space and time inherent in Newtonian theory. (b) By theoretical adequacy is meant that a theory furnishes the means of giving a theoretical answer to all appropriate physical questions that naturally occur in the domain it is purported to cover, i.e., the theory contains a set of fundamental equations that will furnish the answer to a question of fact if the necessary mathematical or rational operations and interpretations can be carried out. Thus, if the basic theory is in principle incapable of furnishing answers to questions of fact appropriate to the domain, we say the theory is theoretically inadequate. The Bohr quantum theory we judge to be inadequate because it furnishes only the frequencies of the light emitted by an atom but not the intensi- ties. The new quantum-mechanics does not have these short-comings. We should like to emphasize that the idea of theoretical adequacy is not an absolute but an approximate conception, hence there are degrees of adequacy for any theory. The whole history of science is replete with examples to show that every theory has only a limited and incomplete adequacy. In fact, on the basis of the concept of successive approximation of the development of scientific theories, alluded to above, no theory is, or could be, completely adequate. For it is the very theoretical and experimental inadequacies that make further progress necessary and desirable.</page><page sequence="9">METHODOLOGY OF RESEARCH AND PROGRESC IN SCIENCE 283 (c) As regards experimental adequacy it is commonplace to state that physical theory, in so far as it pertains to natural events, must have compatibility with experimental data. We shall now define what is meant by the experimental adequacy of a physical theory. We mean by this term the degree of accuracy, both qualitative and quantitative, between the prediction of the theory and experiment. By qualitative agreemeat we mean that the theory predicts facts of the type actually observed i.e., experiment confirms the presence of such qualitative aspects as the theory predicts. Thus, for example, Rowland con- firmed the presence of a magnetic field due to a moving charge, which was pre- dicted by Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism. An example illustrating quali- tative but not quantitative agreement is afforded by the Bohr theory which predicted consequences that were qualitatively correct but the quantitative agreement was not always satisfactory. Thus, the quantum numbers in the Bohr theory were integral, but experimentally half integral quantum-numbers were also observed. The importance of experimental adequacy is due to the link it forms between the deductive aspects of physical theory and the experi- mental field of inquiry. The function of a physical theory is to enable us to give an adequate answer to questions of fact that fall within the domain covered by the theory. This necessitates a disctssion of what is meant by fact and how it finds its setting in theory. On the theory of successive approximation we take cognizance of levels of facts, the lowest one being that of the order of sense- perception, as for example, the perception of simple sense data such as color and space-coincidences, the latter taken in their qualitative aspects. It is agreed that physical theory builds its edifice on the basis of correlation of sense-percepts and by a step-up process obtains the highly theoretical constructs of modem physics. However, in the process of experimental verification of the conse- quences of a physical theory we come, in the ultimate analysis, upon facts of the lowest order, namely, those of sense-perception. Thus, in the Michelson-Morley experiment, a very difficult experiment to perform, we finally come down to the location of a fringe in the interference pattern i.e., to perceptual sense-data. Facts of the lowest order have a relative irreducibility and permanence about them; they are what logical positivists construe as constituents of atomic proposi. tions. In addition to the facts of lowest order which are the most stable and ir- reducible, there is at any given stage in the development of science a body of well- established facts which are relatively permanent. These are expressed in terms of existing theories and may receive new interpretation with the creation of new theories. An example of such facts is afforded by the element of charge, the mass of an electron, the elementary quantum of action, and Avogadro's number; others may be found in the International Critical Tables. It must be added that such facts are subject to quantitative change due to improvement in experimental technique or to a transformation of theory. At any rate, they furnish the raw material for testing or establishing new theories, and they may take on new inter- pretation as theory develops. For example, dielectric constant, which originally was a purely empirical constant, can now be calculated with the aid of quantum- mechanics in the case of gases composed of simple molecules, and in principle</page><page sequence="10">284 ERWIN BISER AND ENOS E. WITMER could be calculated for all gases and for all crystalline solids. It would follow then from out reflections that there are no facts independent of theory save per- haps those of the lowest order. Experimental data have their setting in, and hence are to be construed in conjunction with, the physical theory that is ap- plicable to that domain. They do not possess the irreducible ultimacy characteristic of the facts of the lowest order of the sense-perceptual level and are subject to transformation both in the qualitative and quantitative sense. Such a transformation is coextensive with that of the basic concepts of the theory. By the term "scientific facts" we mean those items which are regarded as well- established by those competent in a given domain of science. These have objec- tive validity and are not purely subjectivistic in character. Thus, any question of so-called fact that is decidedly controversial in character is not be considered a well-established fact of science. This restriction obviously rules out facts of the lowest order as not having reached the status of scientific facts. On our view, then, all facts are dependent on theory because they are established by experimentation which can be carried out only on the basis of a theoretical pattern. There is thus constant interaction between theory and fact in the evolution of physical theory; an existing theory furnishes the means by which new facts are established which in turn may furnish the basis for the creation of new theory (8). Methods of Achieving Unity The world of experience presents a diversity of phenomena which thus far man has been able to comprehend only with the aid of a number of theoretical schemata. Thus, the natural sciences consist of various subdivisions each deal- ing with a subject-matter peculiar to its province. The science of physics though purported to have for its domain of inquiry the physical world is divided into mechanics, optics, thermodynamics, etc. Since the aim of science is to work towards a unity of symbolic functional schemas embracing all phenomena, it translates itself into attempts to unify the diversities of nature by a comprehen- sive structural pattern. As science develops it becomes necessary and desirable from time to time to develop more comprehensive natural patterns to subsume several domains hitherto treated as separate and distinct. The union of two domains by a theoretical schema implies the existence of experiments linking both domains as is illustrated by the work of Oersted (1819) and that of Maxwell (1831); the first of these established the magnetic effect of an electric current and the second the law of electro-magnetic induction. The complete theoretical unification of these two domains of electricity and mag- netism was made by Maxwell who ushered in the first field theory in physics. Another more recent example of the unification of two domains is furnished by the rise of the special theory of relativity uniting mechanics and optics. Accord- ing to classical mechanics a restricted principle of relativity, sometimes called Newton's principle of relativity, was valid for mechanical phenomena, but classicall optics assumed the existence of a preferred reference-system for optical phenomena, namely, that in which the ether was at rest. It is clear that we have</page><page sequence="11">METHODOLOGY OF RESEARCH AND PROGRESS IN SCIENCE 285 before us two conceptions of functional dependence of phenomena onl space and time reference-systems that are palpably inconsistent. In other words the laws of mechanics were invariant with respect to the Galilean transformation but not the laws of optics and electro-magnetism. This inconsistency was removed by A. Einstein who radically revised our notions of space and time as used in physics, and by changing the formulas for transforming from one co-ordinate-system to another moving uniformly with respect to the first, he showed the laws of physics to be invariant with respect to the Lorentz and not to the Galilean transforma- tion. PHILOSOPHIC AND ESTHETIC SATISFACTION Physical theory is not a haphazard collection of sense-data, or a correlation of sense-aspects of physical processes, for if we dealt only with aspects of bodies we would remain on the sense-perceptual level; it studies the actual and possible structure of processes with a view of correlating not only that which is known but of predicting phenomena not accessible to the perceptual level of knowledge, such as atomic phenomena. Science, as an activity arising out of a cultural pattern of an epoch is a selective ordering and analysis of, and functional correla- tion amongst, natural events. The terms "selective" and "analysis" are to emphasize the activity of mind in choosing and discovering facts with the help of theory, as relevant and significant to knowledge. It should not be overlooked that some of the most important discoveries in science have been made without the aid of any theory concerning the phenomena discovered, as for example X-rays by Roentgen and radioactivity by Becquerel. In these cases previously developed theory is used in performing and interpreting the experiments involved. In our opinion, the greatest discoveries are precisely those which do not fit into exsting theories. It is the hallmark of experimental rationalism, the view held by the authors that whatever is revealed about a domain of science as a result of experimental and theoretical inquiry is a function of the method and conceptual forms of analysis used. The facts or science are not the "brute facts" of immediate ex- perience, they are not there in nature to be found by anyone untutored in theory and experiment; on our view, scientific facts are inseparably bound with and are inconceivable apart from theory. Science is thus a creative activity, and con- cepts and leading principles are the inventions of genius. But unlike the creative artist who is limited only by the medium of his expression, the scientist must pay primary attention to experimental facts, since compatibility with experiment is the crucial test of the plausibility of a theory. The basic physical theories developed so far are characterized by definite sim- plicity of fundamental ideas and presuppositions which lend them a philosophic and esthetic elegance. Conversely, the effort to attain such elegance can become a driving force towards the improvement in theory as will be shown in the sequel. To insist that a physical theory presupposes fundamental assumptions and con- cepts is to insist on the obvious, but to state that these assumptions are not to be too numerous or too complex is to enunciate a principle of parsimony and an</page><page sequence="12">286 ERWIN BISER AND ENOS E. WITMER esthetic demand for simplicity. If each new experimental fact is to be accounted for by an ad hoc hypothesis, then there might be no end to the introduction of new hypotheses. Is it not the aim of physical theory to "deduce" experimentally verifiable consequences from as few initial assumptions and sets of concepts as possible? The basic faith of the creative scientist and philosopher is that the phenomena of nature can be rendered intelligible by means of general principles, that the structure of events can be revealed by a rational schema. It is the old conviction and idea that there is order in nature; the belief that science can reveal the structure of nature within limits of approximation. We have stressed thus far the two motivating principles, that of rationality, namely, that the structure of nature is to be unravelled with the aid of rational concepts compatible with empirical verification, and of simplicity, namely, that the laws of nature must not be numerous or too complicated. It is the latter heuristic postulate which ex- presses the demand for esthetic satisfaction and elegance of formulation of physical laws. One need not suppose, however, that nature is intrinsically gov- erned by simple laws, for to hypostasize the demand for simplicity into a meta- physical principle is to assume that natural phenomena take cognizance of our mathematical limitations and difficulties; such a view would degenerate scientific methodology into the crudest anthropomorphism prevalent in the prescientific epochs of human culture. We can, and we do, avail ourselves of rules of par- simony and rigour such as Occam's razor with the recognition that if laws of nature were too numerous and too complicated, they could not be effectiv ely manipulable and practicable. The inseparable connnection of the two principles of rationality and simplicity is emphasized by Weyl. "The assertion that Nature is governed by strict laws is devoid of all content if we do not add the statement that it is governed by mathematically simple laws.... One cannot help admit that this working principle of simplicity has stood the test well.. .. The astonish- ing thing is not that there exist natural laws but that the further the analysis proceeds .... the simpler-and not more complicated, as we would originally expect-the fundamental relations become and the more exactly they describe the actual occurrences" (9). Professor Weyl is guilty of just the sort of hypo- stasis spoken of previously, namely, he converts the principle of simplicity into a metaphysical principle. In doing this he identifies the category of reality i.e., the structure of phenomena per se, with the present scientific conception of the world. In his view simplicity is inherent in nature apart from the processes of scientific selectiveness and human ingenuity in inventing new concepts when old ones are found inadequate. There is a great deal of warranted confusion as to the notion of simplicity, which at times becomes as equivocal as the idea of reality in philosophical litera- ture. In this paper we are concerned with logical simplicity rather than with its psychological counterpart. Logical simplicity, or what is sometimes referred to as simplicity of fundamental assumptions, is often mistaken for simplicity due to familiarity with subject-matter and modes of thought ingrained for generations. The appeal such type of simplicity has is enhanced by what Pierce would call the "method of tenacity." It is quite natural on the part of the layman as well</page><page sequence="13">METHODOLOGY OF RESEARCH AND PROGRESS IN SCIENCE 287 as the scientific philosopher to bring to the fore questions as to whether one theory is simpler than another covering the same domain. Adequate and stimulating answers to such queries can only be given within the context of the approximation theory of scientific knowledge, viewing the evolution of scientific thought as a succession of patterns of progressive approximations both from the standpoint of quantitative precision and conceptual generalization and analysis. A compara- tive study of the Newtonian equations of gravitation and the field equations of Einstein will reveal that the former are more easily manipulable especially when applied to such problems as the two-body problem. But the ease of mathemati- cal operations is not the criterion adopted in this paper. What concerns us primarily is the fact that the field equations embrace such phenomena as the bending of rays of light within the sun's gravitational field, the anomalous motion of the planet Mercury, etc., phenomena unaccounted for by Newton's law of gravitation. And what is of greater importance from the standpoint of simplicity, Einstein's fundamental assumptions are fewer, eliminating the Newtonian notion of gravitational force, and result in the geometrization of a large part of macroscopic physics. We now turn to concrete examples to illustrate the need of philosophic satis- faction in physical theory, a notion closely connected with the esthetic demand for simplicity. The special theory of relativity and its inadequacies offers a singular instance of the point at issue. Although the special theory of relativity had banished the concept of absolute rest it still retained vestiges of the concept of absolute motion since the equiva. lence of two systems moving with respect to each other was restricted to the case of uniform translatory motions. According to the principle of relativity there is no privileged reference-system with respect to which physical processes can be described and functionally correlated; but inertial systems formed such a set of privileged frames of reference, since it is only with regard to such reference- systems that the motion of bodies not acted upon by external forces is described as uniform. It was felt that whereas absolute velocities were discarded by the new theory, there remained the relic of absolute accelerations and rotations. Such a principle of relativity was seen by Einstein to be self-contradictory and too restricted since it would open the back door, so to speak, to the Newtonian abso- lute space and absolute time. This defect was overcome by generalizing the special principle of relativity into the general principle of relativity, according to which all coordinate systems are on an equal basis. Another approach to this subject is through the invariance of the laws of physics with respect to a transformation of the space-time coordinates. The special principle of relativity leads directly to the consequence that the funda- mental laws of physics shall be invariant with respect to the Lorentz transforma- tion. In the general theory of relativity the physical laws-in the differential form-must be invariant with respect to any transformation of the space-time coordinates. Thus the theory of relativity in both the restricted and general forms is a transformation theory. The general theory has to its credit thus far only a relatively small number of predictions that are experimentally verifiable.</page><page sequence="14">288 ERWIN BISER AND ENOS E. WITMER Although the results of these experiments are regarded as favorable to the general theory of relativity, there is no doubt the general acceptance of the theory by competent theoretical physicists is due in part to the philosophic need for a general theory (of relativity), to its unifying power and to the elegance it has be- stowed upon the equations and concepts of macroscopic physics. One cannot refrain from saying: it is a work of art. Lastly, we wish to point out that the notion of invaxiance in a generalizedform has been used in the domain of quantum physics. This indicates the creative character of the principle of invariance. Physicists are attempting to cast the laws of many domains of physical theory into invariant form. The most re- markable results have been obtained by Dirac. It is the singular achievement of Dirac's theory of the electron that the spin properties of an electron are de- duced without an ad hoc hypothesis. His theory also enabled Darwin and Gordon to obtain an exact derivation of formulas similar to Sommerfeld's for the fine structure of the hydrogen spectrum. Although we have been speaking of the elegance of certain physical theories, it should be noted that an appreciation or feeling for such elegance may not be shared by all physicists, just as appreciation of art or poetry is not universal among people. In such cases where a feeling for the elegance of physical theory exists, it seems likely to us that this has a psychological explanation in the feeling of awe and triumph that such a simple set of postulates should be able to embrace such an enormous body of experimental data. Thus this feeling for elegance is a reflection of the simplicity and unifying power of the theory under consideration. On another occasion we hope to present some additional factors involved and presupposed, in the evolution of scientific thought. Rutgers University University of Pennsylvania REFERENCES 1. E.
