<plain_text><page sequence="1">HERMANN COHEN, 1841-1918 BY ERNST CASSIRER kJ n june 4th of last year one hundred years had elapsed since the birth of Hermann Cohen. No German philosophical review and no contemporary German philosopher noted the date. In Ger- many the greatest efforts have been made to forget the name of Hermann Cohen, and to efface or suppress his philosophical work. But all these efforts will prove useless. Future historians of German philosophy in the second half of the nineteenth century will regard Cohen as one of the greatest representatives of that period. It was Cohen who inaugurated that great intellectual movement that is commonly described under the name of Neo-Kantianism, and who led it to its real aim and its culmination. He spent more than thirty years on his description and interpretation of the Kantian doctrine, and not until he had performed this task did he begin to publish his own systematic works: his Logik der reinen Erkenntnis, his Ethik des reinen Willens, his Aesthetik des reinen Gef√ºhls. When these works first appeared they were a great surprise to the philosophical world in Germany. Cohen had won a great reputation in the field of Kantian studies, being regarded as one of the subtlest and most profound commentators of Kant. But at the same time he was charged with a sort of Kantian orthodoxy that was attacked from many sides. In his great systematic works Cohen entirely refuted this view. Here he stands before us not as a commentator or as an historian of philosophy but as a very inde- pendent and original thinker. Even in his books on Kant Cohen never swore by the master's words, but sought to pave his own way. In his last works, however, in the works of his old age, he went much further in this respect. He never lost sight of the first principles that had been firmly es- tablished by Kant, the principles of true critical philosophy, but he strove to enlarge those principles and to apply them to new</page><page sequence="2">22O SOCIAL RESEARCH problems. For this purpose he had to analyze once more, and some- times to criticize very severely, some of the fundamental concepts of Kant's theory of knowledge. Cohen felt himself to be only a sin- gle link in a great intellectual process, in that "golden chain" of idealistic thought that begins with Plato and, by way of Descartes and Leibniz, leads to Kant. On the other hand he was convinced that, according to the statement of Kant himself, we cannot speak of a "classical author" in the field of philosophy. What distinguishes critical thought from dogmatic thought is, according to Cohen, the fact that the former never expresses itself in a merely static way. It is a living and dynamic effort that must always be prepared for a new start: not gegeben but aufgegeben; not an immovable center of our intellectual universe but continual process and endeavor. It is not easy to delineate within the limits of a short discussion the whole range of problems with which the philosophy of Cohen is concerned. I must content myself with giving a general survey of the principal questions. i With regard to Cohen's interpretation of the Kantian system I may perhaps be allowed to begin with a personal experience. I was led to my first acquaintance with the works of Cohen in a rather unusual way. It was about fifty years ago that I first became inter- ested in the study of Kantian philosophy. At that time I was a young student not of philosophy but of German language and German literature at the University of Berlin. I was deeply im- pressed by the Critique of Pure Reason, and after each new reading I felt myself more under the spell of that book. But at the same time I had the greatest difficulty in understanding the thought of Kant. I met with various interpretations that were not only widely diver- gent but directly opposed to one another. It was then a generally admitted opinion that no one could enter the field of philosophy without a careful and thorough study of the work of Kant. The "back to Kant" idea-first promulgated by thinkers like Heimholte, Eduard Zeller, Friedrich Albert Lange-</page><page sequence="3">HERMANN COHEN 221 was deeply inculcated in all philosophical minds. But this general agreement was only an apparent one. It contained the germs of a radical dissension. Nearly all the philosophical schools referred to Kant and appealed to his authority, but there was never a clear and unambiguous way of interpreting his fundamental doctrines. There was an empiristic view of the Kantian system side by side with a rationalistic view; there was a metaphysical conception side by side with a strict phenomenalism, nay a strict skepticism; there was a "realistic" explanation in contradistinction to another that seemed to lead to mere "subjective idealism." It was extremely diffi- cult to find one's bearings in this mass of opposite interpretations. I remember very well the day on which I left the lectures on Kant given by Friedrich Paulsen with the definite impression that what Paulsen had taught here was not a true description but a polemical caricature, a travesty of the thought of Kant. As a young student, however, I felt entirely unable to prove my point and to contradict the famous professor, who at that time was one of the best known and most influential teachers of philosophy at the University of Berlin. Paulsen's own philosophy was a strange eclec- ticism that strove to combine various and even incompatible ele- ments of thought. In his ontology he maintained a universal idealism that came very near to being a system of panpsychism in the sense of Gustav Theodor Fechner. But this metaphysical atti- tude did not prevent him from upholding a strictly empiristic, even skeptical view in his theory of knowledge. In this field he was from first to last an admirer and disciple of Hume. He was convinced that Kant had failed in his principal task, that he had never suc- ceeded in solving the Humian problem. A few months ago I found by chance a striking example of this attitude in a preface written by Wickham Steed.1 Professor Steed went to Berlin as a student of philosophy in the autumn of 1892- at the same time that I was at- tending the lectures of Paulsen. But Paulsen could scarcely under- stand his interest in German philosophy. "I can't imagine," he told him, "why you English people come here to study German philoso- 1 To the book of Aurei Kolnai, The War Against the West (New York 1938) .</page><page sequence="4">222 SOCIAL RESEARCH phy. You have it all at home, and much more clearly, in David Hume." A man who thought in that way could be a very good academic teacher, but could scarcely introduce a student to Kant. I made a second attempt to find a clue in the labyrinth of the Critique of Pure Reason by attending the lectures of Georg Simmel. And here I was lucky from the beginning. Simmel was a very original and penetrating thinker. He worked in nearly all the fields of modern philosophy, and later he became one of the first founders of philosophical sociology. At that time, however, he was still a young privatdocent who delivered his lectures before a small but very interested and attentive audience. In one of the first hours he gave a short bibliography of the literature on Kant. And it was on that occasion that I first heard the name of Hermann Cohen. Simmel emphasized how much he himself owed to the study of Cohen's books, but he immediately added that those books, in spite of their real sagacity and profundity, suffered from a very grave defect. They were written, he said, in such an obscure style that as yet there was probably no one who had succeeded in deciphering them. That was, of course, a great paradox that could not fail to make an impression on the mind of a young man. What a surprise to hear that, after all, there was a work on Kant which the best judges considered to be a true and thorough explanation of his fundamental thoughts but which at the same time was de- clared to be nearly inaccessible to the common reader! Prompt in acting, as suits a boy of nineteen, I resolved to try the adventure myself. I bought Cohen's book, Kants Theorie der Erfahrung/ and began to study it. And here I felt, from the first pages, that I was on firm and secure ground. I could by no means overcome all the difficulties at once - the less so as I was still imper- fectly acquainted with the technical language of philosophy. But I pursued the reading of Cohen's work, for I was convinced that here at last I had found the guide that I had so badly missed and so eagerly desired in my study of Kant's philosophy. After a short time I had gone through all the principal works of Cohen, and it 1 First edition, 1871; second revised and enlarged edition, Berlin 1885.</page><page sequence="5">HERMANN COHEN 223 was only when I had come to this point that I felt prepared to make his personal acquaintance. I went to Marburg, where he held the chair of philosophy, and soon became a pupil of Cohen's and ulti- mately one of his most devoted and intimate friends. A full account of what seem to me the most important features in Cohen's interpretation of the Kantian system would necessitate a highly technical analysis. For those readers who are interested I may refer to an article in which I have explicitly treated these problems.3 Here it will be enough to offer a few suggestions. In the first half of the nineteenth century all German philoso- phers were following the path that had been hewed by Kant and were attempting to complete his work. But in this task they were divided into two different camps. Fichte, Schelling and Hegel offered a metaphysical interpretation of the thought of Kant; Fries and his pupils, and to a certain extent Herbart, were convinced that the true access to Kant could be found only by a new method of psychological analysis. It is at this point that Cohen's work be- gan. According to him the first step is to recognize that neither a metaphysical nor a psychological method is adequate. Both of them miss the point. Kant introduced neither a new metaphysics nor a new psychology; what he offered was something quite different- a new theory of experience. Such a theory cannot and need not go beyond the limits of pos- sible experience. It cannot answer any ontological questions about the existence or the qualities of the "thing in itself." But neither is it limited to a genetic view, to the problems of the origin of our concepts and ideas. A theory of experience is what in modern ter- minology we may call a general "axiomatic" of experience. Such a doctrine must be built up on independent logical principles. To discover and to establish these principles, first and foremost the principles of mathematics and mathematical physics, was the real aim of Kant. In pursuing it he had to introduce what he described as the "transcendental" method, which, though based on experi- 3 "Hermann Cohen und die Erneuerung der Kantischen Philosophie," published in Kantstudien, vol. 17, no. 3 (1912), on the occasion of Cohen's seventieth birthday.</page><page sequence="6">224 SOCIAL RESEARCH enee, depends not on mere empirical facts but on the general "con- ditions," on the "form" of experience. This fundamental form cannot be ascertained by mere psychological induction. Induction can never lead us to the certainty and the universal validity that are required for a true theory of experience. Cohen pointed out that all the modern attempts to revive the Kantian system failed in this very point. They were made by great physicists, like Helmholtz, or by philosophers like Friedrich Albert Lange, author of the Geschichte des Materialismus. Helmholtz approached the problem from a physiologist's point of view. He thought that he had found a new and convincing proof of Kant's transcendental theory in his doctrine of the specific energy of the senses: just as our eye can perceive nothing but light and color, our intellect can grasp nothing but what is contained in its funda- mental concepts and categories. And the same conception is to be found in Lange's description of the Kantian theory: the whole of our experience is based on our specific psychophysical organiza- tion; we cannot go beyond this circle; the limits of our sense experi- ence are at the same time the limits of our human world. But it was Kant himself who warned against such an interpreta- tion of his fundamental theory. In a very characteristic passage of the Critique of Pure Reason he gave a strict refutation of the theory that was later attributed to him. If this theory were true, he declared, all our judgments would, a priori, lose their ground. Our psychophysical organization is an empirical and therefore a con- tingent fact; and how can we hope to found upon such a contingent fact the universality and necessity that we claim for an a priori principle? "There are only two ways," says Kant, "in which we can account for a necessary agreement of experience with the concepts of its objects: either experience makes these concepts possible or these concepts make experience possible. ... A middle course may be proposed between the two above mentioned, namely, that the cate- gories are neither self-thought first principles a priori of our knowl- edge, nor derived from experience, but subjective dispositions of</page><page sequence="7">HERMANN COHEN 225 thought, implanted in us from the first moment of our existence and so ordered by our Creator that their employment is in com- plete harmony with the laws of nature in accordance with which experience proceeds- a kind of preformation system of pure reason. Apart, however, from the objection that on such an hypothesis we can set no limit to the assumption of predetermined dispositions to future judgments, there is this decisive objection against the suggested middle course, that the necessity of the categories, which belongs to their very conception, would then have to be sacrificed. The concept of cause, for instance, which expresses the necessity of an event under a presupposed condition, would be false if it rested only on an arbitrary subjective necessity, implanted in us, of connecting certain empirical representations according to the rule of causal relation. I would not then be able to say that the effect is connected with the cause in the object, that is to say, necessarily, but only that I am so constituted that I cannot think this repre- sentation otherwise than as thus connected. This is exactly what the sceptic most desires. For if this be the situation, all our insight, resting on the supposed objective validity of our judgments, is nothing but sheer illusion; nor would there be wanting people who would refuse to admit this subjective necessity which can only be felt. Certainly a man cannot dispute with anyone regarding that which depends merely on the mode in which he is himself organ- ized.'4 n If from the early books of Cohen we now proceed to the works of his old age, in which he presents a full and systematic description of his philosophical thought, we are confronted with a serious diffi- culty, for what we find here is not only a new direction of thought but also a new language. Cohen made use of a philosophical termi- nology which in many respects deviated both from the general tra- dition and from the Kantian terms. He spoke a strictly technical 4 Critique of Pure Reason, 2nd ed., p. 167, English translation by Norman Kemp- Smith (London 1929) p. 175.</page><page sequence="8">226 SOCIAL RESEARCH language that cannot be reproduced here. For present purposes it must be enough to give a brief account of the general tendency that governs and pervades his whole philosophical work. In a certain sense it is easy enough to describe this tendency. What Cohen wished to present was a coherent system of philo- sophical idealism. And he understood this term in its original and classical sense, in the sense in which it was understood by Plato or Parmenides. The latter's dictum that "thinking and being are one thing' ' is the essential theme of Cohen's Logik der reinen Erkennt- nis, a. theme that is repeated and varied in his Ethik des reinen Willens and his Aesthetik des reinen Gef√ºhls. There is no gulf, no difference, between reality and thought. Thought does not re- produce an outward reality; it is the foundation and the very core of reality. Cohen's Logik is based on what he called das Prinzip des Ursprungs (the principle of origin). By this principle he wished to express the fact that there is no being, no objectivity, no "nature of things" that does not originate in thought. A reality outside the sphere of thought and exempt from its principles and conditions is a meaningless concept. Thus Cohen rejected a fundamental step in Kant's theory of knowledge, for he did not admit that distinction between "sensi- bility" and "understanding" (Sinnlichkeit and Verstand) which is a cardinal point in Kant's Critique of Pure Reason. Sensibility is described by Kant as the "receptivity" of the human mind, whereas understanding is defined as a form of spontaneity. But according to Cohen we have to efface the term "receptivity" from our theory of knowledge. Neither in its sensuous experience nor in its rational activity is the human mind a tabula rasa, an empty tablet upon which outward things may make their impressions. It is active in all its functions, in perception as well as in conception, in feeling as well as in volition. There is no room left for a mere "receptivity" in addition to and outside the spontaneity of the human mind. The concept of a passive substratum- a mere material that is "given" from without, on which the human mind has to impress its own form, is to be abandoned in a true and coherent system of philo-</page><page sequence="9">HERMANN COHEN 227 sophical idealism. "Dem Denken darf nichts als gegeben gelten." This general thesis wins new significance if we pass from the field of theoretical philosophy to the field of practical philosophy. What is called ' 'spontanei ty" in the domain of logic appears in the domain of ethics under a new name. But this change of name is not a change of principle. The fundamental law of truth (das Grundgesetz der Wahrheit) is the same for logic and for morality. The latter is the theory of "pure will/' in the same sense in which logic is the theory of "pure knowledge." All moral truth is based on the principle of autonomy. As soon as we leave or restrict the autonomy of the human will we lose our ethical ground. Thus rationality, according to Cohen, is the outstanding feature and the characteristic mark of every true system of morality. "With- out knowledge," he says, "there is no idea of man and no idea of morality. Inspiration, imagination, mere reception or learning from other sources or spirits, are not possible foundations of knowl- edge; and just as little can they be regarded as true foundations of morality or of our idea of man. Knowledge is knowledge out of presuppositions and principles which the knowing one himself must account for, in each single step."5 For the moral law, there- fore, there is no other "lawgiver" than the human mind itself. There is no other authority to which we can appeal, no authority of a superhuman power or a holy scripture. "Only by our own action can morality become a true reality. For this action God means nothing else than, so to speak, the possibility of an ideal pattern and scheme."6 But when he had arrived at this point of his intellectual evolu- tion Cohen had to face a very grave problem. He was animated by a deep religious faith. From his early childhood he had learned to read the Bible and the other sources of Judaism; his father, a Jew- ish teacher, was his first instructor in Hebrew and in the Jewish religion. Later on he was a student of Jewish theology at the semi- 6 "Religion und Sittlichkeit" (1907), published in J√ºdische Schriften, ed. by Bruno Strauss (Berlin 1924) vol. 3, p. 111. 9 Ibid., vol. 3, p. 138.</page><page sequence="10">228 SOCIAL RESEARCH nar in Breslau. Had he to give up and to forget all this when he became a philosopher? Or could he reserve a place for the funda- mental problems of religion in his philosophical system? The answer to this question was not easy; and in studying the books of Cohen we perceive a certain tension, a sort of inward struggle, with regard to this problem. As a philosopher Cohen was not inclined toward any compro- mise. He did not hesitate to draw the most radical consequences from his premises. And according to these premises he could not admit a separate source of religious truth, a special revelation. There was no room for a religious truth apart from an intellectual or moral truth. In consequence of this, Cohen's system of philoso- phy does not contain a philosophy of religion as a separate and inde- pendent part. We find in this system a philosophy of knowledge, a moral philosophy, a philosophy of art, but no philosophy of re- ligion. In his Ethik des reinen Willens Cohen expressly declared that religion is to be resolved into morality. He admitted that the idea of God is an integral part of philosophical ethics, but denied that this idea introduces a new and independent principle. In a thorough philosophical analysis the idea of God, when understood in its true sense and when purified of all anthropomorphic ele- ments, coincides with the idea of the Good. In a later treatise, Der Begriff der Religion im System der Philosophie, Cohen somewhat modified this view. Here he seems to allow to religion a greater in- dependence, and to reserve for it a special category, that of indi- viduality. But even in this modification he made a characteristic restriction. Schleiermacher, in his Reden √ºber die Religion, tried to derive religion from a special feeling that he called "das Gef√ºhl der schlechthinigen Abh√§ngigkeit," the feeling of absolute depen- dence. If this were true, Cohen objected, there could be no philo- sophical approach to religion and no possible reconciliation be- tween religion and philosophy. According to the fundamental defi- nition given by Cohen, philosophy is based on spontaneity not on receptivity. It means freedom and autonomy instead of absolute</page><page sequence="11">HERMANN COHEN 229 dependence. If we cannot build up a religion of freedom we have to renounce every hope of finding philosophical religion. But Cohen did not admit that in order to establish the truth of religion we have to deny or restrict the power of theoretical thought. Religion in its true and genuine sense is to be proved by the strength of man, not by his weakness or infirmity. And the true strength of man rests on the power of his intellect and his moral consciousness. Religion cannot intend to mutilate these powers. Its real aim is to complete them, to bring them to their highest perfection and to direct them to one and the same end. This is the philosophical concept and the philosophical ideal of religion that are maintained and defended in all the works of Cohen. But he was perfectly aware, of course, that religion in its concrete, actual, historical existence does not coincide with this conception. Religion always contains an element that is unac- countable from the point of view of speculative thought. Its origin is mythical, not intellectual or ethical. Even in its highest stage religion can never deny or forget this mythical background. Myth is not merely an accidental feature that accompanies the life and the development of religion: it pervades its whole essence. If we cut off the mythical roots of religion it becomes lifeless and ineffec- tive. Therefore it would be hopeless to attempt to describe religion wholly in terms of a philosophical system or an ethical ideal. Religion is not a system of thought, nor is it a code of moral de- mands. The roots of its historical existence and of its real meaning are to be sought in our emotional and imaginative life. Cohen did not contest or minimize this intimate and indispen- sable connection between myth and religion, but he saw in it only a first and preliminary step: he described the evolution of religion as an evolution from mythical thought and feeling to prophetic thought and feeling. In the books of the prophets, in Isaiah and Jeremiah, he found the consummation, the culminating point of religion. Even here the mythical elements are by no means eradi- cated, but they are overshadowed by a new ideal. "All civilization," declared Cohen, "has grown out of mythical thought- knowledge</page><page sequence="12">230 SOCIAL RESEARCH as well as morality, poetry and all the other arts. Civilization in all its different fundamental directions has unfolded from mythical elements." But man, in the course of his intellectual, moral and religious history, has gradually won a new perspective. Instead of interpreting his life from the point of view of the mythical past he has begun to understand it from the point of view of its ultimate end: the idea and the ideal of the future have overcome the belief in the mythical past. "Myth," said Cohen, "goes back to the first beginnings, to the primeval age. It is here that man finds the roots of the holy and the religious. The holy has the worth and the dignity of an immemorial past. From this mythical time we come to a cosmic time. The divine is not only to be regarded as the beginning of time, as the origin in which religious thought and religious feeling are absorbed. It stands before us as the present and eternal order of nature, as a cosmic order. Even Plato speaks of the stars as 'visible gods/ In the unchangeable course, the periodical movement of the heavenly bodies, we contemplate an unalterable divine order al- ways identical with itself. The prophets, however, speak neither of the mythical primordial time nor of the cosmic time. They are inspired by the vision of the future time. The future, not the past or the present, becomes the true revelation of God. And this new religious point of view means also a new orientation of human life and a new ideal of humanity." The very essence of monotheism is now to be understood in a new and more profound sense. Myth has nothing in common with this ideal of monotheism. Myth is interested in clan, in tribe, in nation; no heathen myth ever directed its view upon humanity. "The idea of humanity," said Cohen, "is the fruit and issue of the unity of God. The prophets, by defying the mythical relation be- tween God and man, could implant the correlation between man and man into the original soil of prophetic religion. It was only by the idea of the unity of God that they were able to discover the unity of mankind- that highest thought of morality." Cohen emphatically denied the view that the God revealed and</page><page sequence="13">HERMANN COHEN 231 proclaimed by the prophets was nothing more than a national God. The Messiah predicted by the prophets is to be understood not as a national but as a universal redeemer. "Providence is divine if it does not take into account a special individual in particular, nor a special nation, but if it regards the whole of mankind." This cul- minating point of Jewish prophecy, this belief in the future of mankind, is the content of the idea of a Messiah. "Man is not at liberty to seek his supreme salvation simply in his nationality, much less, as nowadays they venture to say, in his pretended race. He must open his heart to more universal historical motives."* It may be objected, and it has often been objected, that this inter- pretation of the fundamental ideas of Judaism and of religion in general is not an historical description but an idealization of the religious facts. Cohen did not fear this objection. As a matter of fact, it was quite unintelligible from his point of view, for he was one of the most resolute Platonists that has ever appeared in the history of philosophy. As a Platonist he could not think of the "idea" as a lower or derivative reality that is to be subordinated to the phenomena, to the empirical facts. The idea was to him the Urbild, not the Abbild; the archetype, not the mere copy of things. Without such an ideal archetype we could never understand the true life, the deepest tendency of religion. Therefore idealization is by no means a mutilation or falsification of the historical facts. It is purification- and it is only in this continual process of purifi- cation that the true sense of religious facts can be discovered. "Without sympathy," wrote Cohen, "without the presupposition that in all mature religions true humanity or, what means the same, true divinity is striving for its development, we cannot un- derstand and we cannot judge any positive religion. Idealization is the first condition- for everyone who confesses a religion and just as much and no less for everyone who wishes to judge its value."* T Ibid., vol. 3, p. 165. 8 "Die Bedeutung des Judentums f√ºr den religi√∂sen Fortschritt der Menschheit/' address delivered at the Fifth World Congress for Free Christianity and Religious Progress (1910) , published in J√ºdische Schriften (cited above) vol. 1, p. 18.</page><page sequence="14">232 SOCIAL RESEARCH A survey of Cohen's fundamental theoretical views would re- main inadequate if it made no mention of his social and political views. Cohen was no politician in the proper sense of the term. He did not intend to play a political role, and he did not subscribe to the program of any political party. But he was deeply interested in all the political and social problems of his time, and on many occa- sions he expressed in clear and energetic words his fundamental convictions. He had the deepest sympathy for the working class; he was aware of its needs and he defended its claims. In this respect he was always a "socialist"- even at a time in which a profession of socialism was very dangerous for a professor at a German university. But he could never adopt an "orthodox" socialism. His whole phi- losophy was in strongest opposition to the fundamental views of Marxism, to "economic materialism." "Who could ever have thought," he remarked in one of his papers, "that the great political party which fights out the social problem in all its consequences, should regard materialism as its true basis and its principal dogma? This program and this party grew from the soil of idealism. Histor- ical materialism is the strongest contradiction to that ethical ideal- ism in which socialism has both its theoretical and its historical roots." Even in this respect the philosophy of Cohen was thor- oughly consistent; from the beginning to the end it was made from the same mold. I should like to conclude this short survey of Cohen's doctrine with words that he himself spoke, thirty years ago, when address- ing the World Congress for Free Christianity and Religious Prog- ress. They express in a very clear and striking way the spirit that pervaded all his works and gave to his various efforts an intellectual unity and a personal harmony. "We have to regain the belief in moral regeneration, in the moral future of mankind. We have to regain this belief in the face of and in spite of the egoism of nations and the materialism of classes.
