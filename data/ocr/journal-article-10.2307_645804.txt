<plain_text><page sequence="1">meaning of texts: read without benefit of Strathern's intervention, I suspect, the contributions would seem to have little in common. There is also an unfortunate lack of consistency in the use of some terms: the authors have liberally peppered their essays with the term context, which is central to the collection, but there seems to be little agreement on what it means. Nonetheless, Strath- ern's own essays are full of challenging ideas, and she manages to extend the arguments of the con- tributors in interesting directions. Counterworks: Managing the Diversity of Knowledge. RICHARD FARDON, ed. London and New York: Routledge, 1995. x + 233 pp., contributors, notes, references, name index, subject index. FRANK ROMAGOSA University of Chicago This volume's contributors, from a section of the Fourth Decennial Conference of the Association of Social Anthropologists (at Oxford in 1993), address the now seemingly ubiquitous problem of globali- zation. As Richard Fardon highlights in his intro- duction, of interest is "the status of 'global' and 'lo- cal' as organizing terms of social knowledge" (p. 1). The possible relations of this pair to another (society and culture) allow Fardon to articulate what may be distinctive about our contemporary situation: that "how the world is, and how it seems, are aspects of the same condition" (p. 5). Thus culture and knowl- edge, neither of which is an innocent term, are at stake here. This volume's eight ethnographic essays, framed by Fardon's introduction and Appadurai's rich con- clusion, cohere on shared theoretical bases. This collection is also remarkable as an extended object lesson in how to do ethnographically informed analysis while remaining attentive to local-global relations (a long-standing concern of anthropol- ogy). Thus the essays begin by juxtaposing episte- mologies; if long ago we learned that anthropology needs history, it now needs intellectual histories, in- cluding those of how knowledge is produced and consumed. Several of the contributors play understanding off translatability. Anne Salmond addresses the quali- ties of Maori relational thinking (whakapapa) in European-Maori encounters: open to the world, "Maori men and women of mana were (and still are) quickly cosmopolitan" (p. 41). Mark Hobart juxtaposes Western and Balinese modes of knowl- edge, the former (especially insofar as it underwrites globalization theory) "being a very grave business" (p. 66), a "mental entity" (p. 51). By contrast, Bali- nese "ways of knowing" (pramana) are forms of practice, exemplified in the dialogism between healer and client, or actor and audience, "co-agents in inquiry" (p. 60). David Parkin offers an epistemo- logical meditation on anthropology and the medi- cal cultures of Kenya's Swahili-speaking coast. He contrasts Western medical ideologies that treat dis- ease through elimination and confinement with Muslim and non-Muslim medical and religious mo- ments of dispersal. From his linguistic gleanings (in- cluding insights gained from initial untranslatabil- ity) and ethnography emerges a call for "middle- range theory" (p. 143) whereby initial dichotomies yield nuanced understandings. Another recurring theme in the essays is that of the uses and reifications of (often anthropological) knowledge in forming identity. Stephan Palmie dis- cusses the Afro-Cuban Santeria and American Yoruba movements. Again, the subject of this essay is knowledge and its history, especially concerning "syncretism," its uses in local agendas about authen- ticity, and the "management of tradition" (p. 94). Centuries of colonial and neocolonial history in Cuba, Africa, and North America complicate mat- ters, as Palmie demonstrates in his description of long-ongoing conversations between various prac- titioners and their anthropologists. He manages brilliantly to convey "the peculiar deja vu effect [of] elaborations upon the intellectual debris earlier generations of anthropologists left afloat in a variety of local and supralocal discourses" (p. 91). Writing about the Laymi (highland Bolivia), Olivia Harris addresses the various epistemological consequences of parceling identity as Indian, mestizo, and Euro- pean. She pursues "sources of knowledge rather than their origins" (p. 115), especially as the former bear on the contrast between Laymi "ways of know- ing the past" (p. 105) (to do with the local and the exogenous) and Aymara nationalist appropriations of an "Indian" past (to counter the Bolivian nation- state). Dispersed across the community and neces- sarily hybrid and self-conscious, Laymi knowledge challenges Western historiographic exclusivities based on "the natural singularity of place" (p. 119). Michael Herzfeld returns to a locality he knows well, the Cretan town of Rethemnos. Reflecting on the "passionate reifications of local actors" (p. 129), Herzfeld proposes the notion of "cultural inti- macy," treated in book length more recently, in or- der to explore "how people ... find their way around in a world still felt too large to call home" (pp. 124-125). Here, apprentices steal from arti- sans, and bureaucrats from clients. Through such idioms of theft, "deviousness" becomes "an accusa- tion and a boast, depending on context" (p. 131), making collective identity through cultural inti- macy. Finally, two contributors offer suggestive essays in which they risk reading global flows against the propriety of contexts. Signe Howell addresses the flow of knowledge from the "Rest" to the "West," offering anecdotal evidence from London (where the exotic is purveyed as decontextualized art) and from First World and New Age appropriations of "eastern mysticism or primitive religious practices" (p. 173). In explaining the successes and failures of the local adoption of the foreign, Howell makes a suggestive but underelaborated attempt at the epistem- ological rehabilitation of diffusionist theory, whereby local "cultural lacunae" (p. 165) are made manifest by the chance wisdom of foreign goods, knowl- edges, and traditions. One wishes for more on how and why alien objects sometimes resonate with for- eign contexts. Piers Vitebsky compares Sora ("tribal India") and Sakha (arctic Siberia) shamanisms. But the contrast is drawn too starkly; Vitebsky's reading reviews 503</page><page sequence="2">of Sora as a strong embodiment of shamanism's fea- tures renders Sakha a "weak" facsimile. The possi- bility of comparative insight is marred here by the evaluative prominence given to authenticity (about objects) and appropriateness (about contexts). In his valuable and well-wrought concluding es- say on "the production of locality," Arjun Ap- padurai notes that "much of the ethnographic re- cord can be rewritten, and reread, from this point of view" (p. 205), namely, with attention to the many ways in which the production of locality has been a long-standing human project. This retrospection dovetails with the ethnographic concerns of the es- says that precede Appadurai's. If culture and knowledge are at stake in the apparently contempo- rary trend toward globalization, how then to do an- thropology, if at all? The contributors go a long way in answering such questions. And if Fardon concludes his intro- duction by presenting the possibility that the "sub- version [of 'culture'] may be timely" (p. 18), the fol- lowing contributors take a diversity of positions. This is a collection of first order, showing us by ex- ample how anthropology can make an ethno- graphic contribution to the ubiquitous interest in lo- cal and global relations. Things as They Are: New Directions in Pheno- menological Anthropology. MICHAEL JACK- SON, ed. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1996. x + 287 pp., notes, references, contributors. BRAD WEISS College of William and Mary In his preface to this anthology of 11 ethno- graphic chapters and a lengthy introduction, Mi- chael Jackson indicates that phenomenology has had a rather diffuse influence on anthropology, pro- viding, as he puts it, "a repertoire of developing ideas" (p. vii). Yet no consistent and definitive phe- nomenological perspective has emerged, and none is offered here: "No consensus is reached, or reached for" (p. vii). As one might imagine, such willful eclecticism is both a strength and a weak- ness of the collection as a whole. Insights into the particulars of lived experience abound at every turn in these essays, but there is little overall coherence to the volume, and it is often difficult to see the broad potential that a phenomenological perspec- tive affords anthropology. In his wide-ranging introduction Jackson at- tempts (among other intentions) to show the rele- vance of phenomenology for some of the most con- temporary anthropological concerns. He traces a diverse genealogy of phenomenology, articulating the positions of American pragmatists Dewey and James with those of Dilthey, Husserl, and Merleau- Ponty. In weaving these connections Jackson fo- cuses on the central themes of phenomenology that have been especially relevant for anthropology: Husserl's epoche (or "bracketing") of the ontologi- cal status of ideas, the lifeworld, subjectivity and in- tersubjectivity, embodiment, practice, and habitus. Jackson further suggests that recent interests in subalternity and poetics take their cue from pheno- menological interests in ordinary experience, and an insistence on a subject-centered approach to so- cial forms. As valuable and eloquent as Jackson's survey is, his avowedly "anti-intellectual" (in the Jamesian sense) and antistructuralist position occa- sionally entails his granting greater emphasis to the subjective experience of the world than he does to the ineluctable grounding of being-in-the-world. In- tersubjectivity, in this view, is more often shared in common than weighted with inequalities, and the objects of experience appear as immediate exten- sions of the subject rather than as conditions with which subjectivity must grapple. To cite a brief but telling example: in his discussion of Marx (p. 28), Jackson emphasizes the anthropomorphic nature of the objects generated by the laboring body but never addresses the alienating effects of this labor process that were of especial interest to Marx. Nev- ertheless, while these are important concerns and many phenomenologists have struggled with the "givenness" of existence, Jackson's essay certainly provides an illuminating and stimulating overview. The promise of Jackson's intriguing introduction is not always fully realized in the ethnographic es- says. These contributions, arranged alphabetically by author, consist of a discussion of two worlds faced by educated Bedouin women upon marriage (Abu-Lughod); an exploration of the fragmentary nature of "experience" for residents of a homeless shelter in Boston (Desjarlais); a "praxiological" ap- proach to fertility and life transmission in the former Zaire (Devisch); the articulation of self in the life world as embodied in Umeda accounts of taboo (Gell); a rethinking of longhouse organization that focuses on the perceptual (primarily auditory) di- mensions of Dayak sociality (Helliwell); an ap- proach to the poetics of lamentation, highlighting the potential agency that such performative con- texts may provide a young, dispossessed Cretan woman (Herzfeld); a consideration of the eviscera- tion of suffering by the discourse of both clinical psychiatry and medical anthropology, grounded in the traumatic experiences of those who endured China's cultural revolution (A. and J. Kleinman); an exploration of bodiliness as revealed in the efforts of an American graduate student learning how to hand-drum (Lindsey); a discussion of the intersub- jective character of suffering and dying among Iqwaye (New Guinea) in the grip of habitual and prolonged sickness (Mimica); a rumination on the practical and ambiguous cultivation of empathic friendship between fieldworker and host in alpine Italy (Ridler); and a simultaneously ironic and ro- mantic disquisition on virtual ethnography organ- ized by aesthetic criteria of fracture, juxtaposition, and iconoclasm as tangibly embodied by anthro- pologists-as-lovers (Wafer). Part of the volume's evident lack of integrity stems from the fact that 7 of the 11 chapters have been published previously, and many of these do not really speak directly to the issues raised by Jack- son. In fact, in some cases I would argue that the authors' claims run counter to those that Jackson characterizes as phenomenological. Abu-Lughod, for example, insists that educated Bedouins lead a double life, thereby asserting precisely the kind of 504 american ethnologist</page></plain_text>
