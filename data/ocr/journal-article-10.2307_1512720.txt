<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Evolution of Composite Hieroglyphs in Ancient Egypt HENRY G. FISCHER Lila Acheson Wallace Curator in Egyptology, The Metropolitan Museum of Art ?I. THE CLASSICAL TRADITION. Among the more striking characteristics of hieroglyphic writing is the separateness or discreteness of its elements. In the first place, the phonetic and ideographic components are usually presented as individual signs; secondly, if the constituent parts of the signs sometimes combine di- verse elements or points of view, they are generally fitted together in an appropriate fashion, even if it does not always respect the nature of whatever is repre- sented. In inscriptions dating to the classical period of the Old Kingdom the exceptions to the first rule bear out the second, but in other periods the second rule was also infringed to a greater or lesser degree. This ques- tion may be examined by following the evolution of composite forms-those combining two or more hiero- glyphs in a single monogram. Given the close interre- lationship of art and writing in ancient Egypt, one may anticipate that such a survey will provide further in- sight into the aesthetic taste of that civilization. ?2. CLASSIFICATION OF COMPOSITE FORMS. i. For an example of this date see Goedicke, AZ 8 (1 956 )p. 22. 2. Pyr. d degris IV, p. 37 and pl. I6 (76). 3. From Petrie, RT I, pl. 20. The reading Shnw-ih "who em- braces the spirit" is given by the dramatic Ramesseum Papyrus (K. Sethe, Dramatische Texte zu alt-aegyptischen Mysterienspielen [Leipzig, 1928] p. I93). 4. One example as early as the last reign of Dyn. I is recorded by Klasens in Emery, Great Tombs III, pl. 37 (13) and p. 35. The next earliest, at the very beginning of Dyn. IV, occurs in the reliefs The most common type of composite form in every period is that in which one or more signs are enclosed within another. Thus, from the beginning of the First Dynasty onward, the Horus name of the king was framed by the so-called "palace-facade" or serekh ( ), while, from the end of the Third Dynasty onward, the round "cartouche" (CD) enclosed another of the royal names. Buttressed walls may surround the name of a city, and the ground plan of a building may enclose its designation either completely ()) or in part (i). The sign r~ partially encloses I less meaningfully in the compound E- (pri hrw), which was used at least as early as Dynasty II,2 and a pair of arms is apt to embrace a second element as in Archaic s3 and Old Kingdom fp,4_.5 A distinction must be made, however, between the first and second of these examples, both of them meaning "funerary priest"; in the first case the upper- most sign does indeed mean "embrace," and the com- bination is meaningful-"one who embraces the spirit"- while the second composite, although influ- of chty-rc in the Louvre (R. Weill, La Ile et la IIIe Dynasties [Paris, I908] pl. 6). Later Dyn. IV examples: G. A. Reisner, History of the Giza Necropolis I (Cambridge, Mass., 1942) figs. 24I, 242, 257; D. Dunham and W. K.

Some further mechanical combinations of the last kind came into use only later: - (U4, instead of .)7 does not seem to have been used until Dynasty XII,8 and did not be- come common until the second half of that dynasty; ' (U3 for -) is earliest known from the Second In- termediate Period,9 and only became common in the reign of Tuthmosis III.10 Except for a few early First Dynasty examples, where the frame is penetrated by an external hieroglyph (Figure Ia,I" b12), the elements of the enclosed com- 6. J. Spiegel (AZ 75 [I939] p. i i8) has argued that the reading of the uppermost sign is similarly shnw, and Pierre Montet had al- ready come to much the same conclusion some years earlier (Sc?nes de la vie privee dans les tombeaux egyptiens de l'ancien empire [Strasbourg, 1925] p. 403). This interpretation is disproved by a Fourth Dynasty writing of the plural as fl i j (Cairo CG I384), showing that hmw refers to the priests, while n is the object of their attentions, which can only be ki. Compare Edel, Altag. Gramm. I, ?99, who does not mention this evidence but cites the variant writ- ing U j, subsequently published by A.-M. Abu Bakr, Excavations at Giza I949-I950 (Cairo, I953) fig. 38. 7. Here, as in the following pages, I refer to Gardiner's Sign List (Grammar, pp. 438-548) wherever a composite form is repre- sented in his hieroglyphic font. 8. E.g. Sinai, pl. 21 (71, temp. Sesostris I); BM 574 (Simpson, TGG, pl. 6I [42.2], temp. Amenemhet II); BM 569 (same reign, HT II, pl. 20); BM 557 (Simpson, TGG, pl. 39 [26.1]; Boeser, Beschreibung II, pl. 7 (both temp. Amenemhet III). Note, however, that an isolated example is known from an Eighth Dynasty decree at Coptos (Urk. I, p. 296 [I5]) and (= (sm;) also occurs in this decree as well as two others of the same series (Urk. I, p. 300 [8], wrongly transcribed ,; compare H. Goedicke, Konigliche Doku- mente aus dem alten Reich [Wiesbaden, 1967] fig. I7); Urk. I, p. 302 (12). posite signs are usually quite separate. In other types of composites, however, a pair of signs are more imme- diately connected, and it is these that will be examined more closely, from one period to another, in the follow- ing pages, with particular attention to the appropri- ateness of the combination and the discreteness of the fusion. The second consideration calls for a further dis- tinction between two categories: the cases where the signs simply impinge on one another and those in which one sign is traversed by a second. ?3. THE ARCHAIC PERIOD. Emblematic writings of names are particularly characteristic of the early First Dynasty. They are well exemplified by the serekh of the Horus Aha and Queen Hetepw(y)-Neith13 (Fig- 9. J. J. Tylor, Wall Drawings and Monuments of El Kab: Tomb of Sebeknekht (London, 1896) pl. Io. The date may be later than the Thirteenth Dynasty; compare Smither, JEA 25 (I939) p. 35. Io. E.g. Urk. IV, pp. 72 (I5), 75 (I4), 6I (i6), 620 (6), 751 (i6), 860 (3), etc. (all temp. Tuthmosis III or only slightly earlier); Rekh-mi-Rer, pls. 68, I07 (temp. Amenophis II). I . From Petrie, RT II, pl. 14 (98). The serekh of King rh;'s successor is often similar, in that the name Dr (h, a sheaf) is placed at the top, so that the falcon stands upon it (RT II, pl. 15 [I05, io6]). 12. From J. de Morgan, Recherches sur les origines de l'Egypte II (Paris, 1897) fig. 559, p. I69. In addition to these royal names there is the list of besieged towns of the Libyan Palette, Cairo CG 14238, each of which is being pierced by a hoe, as well as the breached hieroglyphic fortress of the Asiatics on the Narmer Palette (W. M. F. Petrie, Ceremonial Slate Palettes [London, 1953] pls. G [ 9] and K). 13. A. H. Gardiner interprets this as "The Neith Hetepu" (Egypt of the Pharaohs [Oxford, 1961] pp. 4 I1, 412), but the two principal elements of the name are elsewhere presented normally, without the framing serekh. Furthermore the likeliest explanation of the terminal ? is that it represents the intensive ending -wy (as in the name _ &gt; p "How gracious she is," as interpreted by Edel, Altag. Gramm. II, ?946). 6 f d e</page><page sequence="3">ure a, b), as well as by two nonroyal names (Figure Ic, d) that are evidently to be read DSr-k;(.i)14 and rhA- k;(.i),s5 both of them being paralleled by normal writ- ings in later archaic inscriptions from Djoser's Step Pyramid.I6 In addition to these, there are other equally early combinations of words such as those shown in Figure Ie, f, where the emblems of Upperx7 and Lower Egypt18 are mounted upon legs and feet; the last are very probably patterned on the hieroglyph , (W25) which is evidenced from the First Dynasty,I9 referring to the "produce" that is brought from these two regions, as in a Second Dynasty inscription that has j] t "pro- duce of Lower Egypt."20 A similar interpretation is pos- sibly to be applied to }-j, which occurs among First Dynasty potmarks.21 Such emblematic combinations of words were scarcely ever again employed in the writing of names before the later years of Dynasty XVIII (see ?8).22 Another meaningful composite seems to occur in the later archaic writing ~ x,23 the first sign combining phonetic ) and ideographic -, and the whole phrase perhaps referring to snw-wr "the great round," a term for the sea, although the ideograph ~ is not otherwise 14. Emery, Great Tombs III, pl. 37 (9). On p. 34 Klasens sug- gests the reading ?hm-k(.y?), while Kaplony, Inschr. ag. Fruhzeit I, p. 448, reads Hrp-k;. The same form of dSr appears in the name Dsr-Nbwy (or Dsr-Nbty?), Petrie, RTI, pl. 4 (3). 15. Emery, Great Tombs III, pl. 78 (2); II, fig. 198 on p. 127 and fig. 229 on p. 170; Petrie, RTII, pl. x6 (121); Kaplony, Inschr. dg. Friihzeit III, pl. 68 (242). The earliest of these examples dates to Wadji, the latest to Den. This is read by Kaplony (I, p. 448) as rm-ki "Mein Ka ist mein Wurfholz." I6.

Here one may also take note of the similar way in which emblems administer to the king in ritual scenes of all periods: e.g. and i, equipped with human arms, wielding fans in reliefs of known to be attested for the stem sni earlier than Dy- nasty XVIII. Its use here is not an arbitrary transverse combination but a descriptive "encirclement" of Q. In addition to A, the First Dynasty provides evidence for at least one more of the familiar series of composites that mount a phonetic sign upon a pair of legs: 9 (MI8) ;24 and ' (N40) is known from the Second Dy- nasty.25 It remains uncertain whether 7 and ? (VI5, T32) were added only in the Old Kingdom.26 An equally familiar series of composites, showing a small hieroglyph at the base of some form of plant, is attested by a Second Dynasty example of i ms-nswt "royal child (ren) ."27 Several composites of the Archaic Period append a geographical term to the ideograph for land, as in , Thnw "Libya."28 A less common combination, dating to the reign of Narmer, oddly attaches the sign for wr to its phonetic complement, ~,29 so that the bird is perched on a human mouth. This degree of incongru- ity is avoided in later inscriptions-at least until those of the Eighteenth Dynasty.30 ?4. THE OLD KINGDOM. From this period there are many examples of the most usual type of enclosed Djoser: C. M. Firth and J. E. Quibell, Excavations at Saqqara: The Step Pyramid (2 vols. [Cairo, I935/1936]), pls. 40-42. Later such devices were sometimes used in private tombs: W. M. F. Petrie, Antaeopolis (London, 1930) pi. 28 (Dyn. XII); N. de G. Davies, Five Theban Tombs (London, 1913) pl. 3 (Dyn. XVIII). 23. Pyr. a degresV, fig. 140, p. 74; on p. I 6 this is read "+hr?." 24. The sign 9 in Petrie, RT I, pl. I5 (I8); the sign A in the same volume, pl. 15 (16). 25. Petrie, RTII, pl. 24 (213). 26. Note also an anomalous occurrence of J in the Dyn. IV place name IJ /" rLc (Rowe, ASAE 38 (1938) pp. 393-395 and pl. 55 [I]; A. Vigneau, Encyclop6die photographique de l'art: Le Musee du Caire [Paris, 1949] pl. 20); this is preceded by the car- touche of Cheops which may be part of the name, as in the similar names of estates (Helen Jacquet-Gordon, Les Noms des domaines funiraires sous l'ancien empire egyptien [Cairo, 1962] pp. 133, 226, 228). 27. Petrie, RTII, pl. 24 (210). 28. Cairo CG 14238: E. L. B. Terrace and H. G. Fischer, Treasures of Egyptian Artfrom the Cairo Museum (London, 1970) p. 22. 29. Petrie, R T II, pl. 13 (96). This also reappears in a potmark: RT I, pi. 39 (2). 30. If the same fusion occurred in later times, it was surely only by inadvertence; see, for example, a Thirteenth Dynasty example on an Edfu stela published by Barsanti, ASAE 9 (1908) pp. I-2 and plate (line I I). One might compare Old Kingdom writings of ~, which sometimes show the arms attached to &lt;&gt; rather than b, but this is a secondary deformation of the original idea; see the reference to Junker in note 5 below. 7</page><page sequence="4">composite, in which the identification of a structure is framed by its walls, as well as the more unusual case of ], containing the suffix-pronoun of inb.f in the epithet of Ptah who is "south of his wall."3I Probably * (08) should also be assigned to this same category. The hori- zontal position of - is not arbitrary, but is evidently usual in Third Dynasty hieratic,32 where it sometimes appears above 0 instead of within it.33 The earliest care- fully executed hieroglyphic examples of the Old King- dom show the ends of - barely projecting on either side (Figures 2a, b),34 and the amount of overlap may be compared with the slight overlapping of margins that occurs in hieroglyphic inscriptions and figurative representations alike from this time onward, notably in the case of long-tailed birds and mammals.35 The best parallel is provided by some examples of the enclosed composite hieroglyph for hwt wrt "great mansion" or 31.

Weill, La Ije et la IIIe Dynasties, pl. 6); example b is from the chapel of Mtn in Berlin (Goedicke, MDIK 2I [1966] pl. 2); some other examples from this source show no projection what- ever (pls. 5, 7, 8). An example on the base of a statue of Djoser con- versely shows slightly more projection than this (Firth and Quibell, Step Pyramid, pl. 58), but other Old Kingdom examples show very little (e.g. CairoJ. 72201 [ASAE 40 (I94i) pl. 73]; A. Fakhry, Sept tombeaux a l'est de la grande pyramide de Guizeh [Cairo, 1935] fig. I0, p. I9;Junker, Gtza III, figs. 27, 28, foll. p. 166). It should also be noted that some Dyn. IV inscriptions combined [ in the same manner: A. Fakhry, Monuments ofSneferu at Dahshur II, pt. 2 (Cairo, 1961) p. 5; H. Fischer, Egyptian Studies I: Varia (New York, 1976) pl. 7 (fig. 4). 35. Good examples in Hassan, Giza V, figs. I28-135, pp. 272- 273. 36. Cairo T. 6/4/49/ (Mitteilungen des Institutsfiir Orientforschung [Berlin] 7 [I960] p. 303); a similar example in Hassan, Giza V, fig. 122, p. 266. 37. For various writings of this title see Orientalia (Rome) 29 (1960) pp. 171-174; Kaplony, Inschr. ag. Friihzeit II, p. 1054, in- correctly reverses the sequence of the signs. 38. In each case the first example is illustrated: (a) Margaret Murray, Saqqara Mastabas I (London, 1904) pl. 20;Junker, Gzza VII, fig. 101; (b) Junker, Gzza VI, fig. 18; IX, fig. 72; (c) Murray, Saqqara Mastabas I, pl. 8; Junker, Giza V, fig. 36; (d) Murray, Saqqara Mastabas I, pi. 28; (e) Junker, Gtza VIII, figs. 32, 34; Cap- art, Rue, pl. 95; (f) Cairo CG I457; Urk. I, pp. I20 (I ), 122 (I2), "tribunal" (Figure 2c).36 The same considerations ap- ply to *, a knife on a chopping block (nmt); in kbh nmt, a title of butchers; this is frequently written f, which may be influenced more directly by -.37 Among the few emblematic combinations of two words there are two that are literally based on hrt "that which is under," the sign mx being placed at the bottom in each case, even though it is read first: hrt-ntr "necrop- olis" (Figure 3a-i)38 and hrt-hrw "course of the day" (Figure 3j-k).39 And there are some further combina- tions of two words that follow the pattern of i, men- tioned earlier: 4 (M28) in the title "greatest of the tens of Upper Egypt" (mdw Smrw) and the problematic 4.40 In other cases of this kind the lower element is a phonetic complement or the feminine ending: ? (M5), f (M6), ~ (M7), ] (M24) and i (for ? "king").4' Although these plant-composites are less meaningful 123 (6), 263 (14); (g) HTI2, pl. 3 (2); Urk. I, p. 164 (3); (h) Cairo J. 43371 (Urk.

In some cases in or H is written below 0, but there is no link between the signs: Urk. I, p. 37 (14) ;Junker, Gfza XI, fig. 76. 40. A possible example as early as Dyn. III: Pyr. d degris V, fig. 167, p. 81; this might, however, be a writing of Iin pr-nSwt, as in the case of no. I 17 on p. 53 (pl. 32 [5]). Old Kingdom examples may be found in Borchardt, Grabd. Sa.hu-rer II, pi. i; G. Jequier, Le Monumentfuneraire de Pepi II, II (Cairo, 1936) pl. 13. In the Mid- dle Kingdom i was sometimes employed as a succinct writing of the title rh nswt "acquaintance of the king" (e.g. Beni Hasan I, pp. 41, 43), but it is difficult to believe that it was originally read the same way; if the original reading was not iry (ht) nswt (for which question see, most recently, Fischer, Egyptian Studies I: Varia, p. 8, note I5), it may perhaps have been h(nms) nswt "friend of the king," as sug- gested by the writings shown in JJNES i8 (1959) p. 258 (3). A sign resembling i is also known from the Late Period (Dyn. XXVI on- ward), but this represents the Memphite title sm: H. De Meule- naere, Melanges Mariette (Cairo, 1961) pp. 285-290. The last also takes the form , which is once attested in an Eighth Dynasty writing of "0 ' , the place-name Zmnw (Turin coffin, Suppl. 13.268: E. Brovarski, in Studies in Honor of George Hughes [Chicago, 1976] p. 34). But in the isolated Eighth Dynasty occurrence it probably derives from a hieratic version of }, representing pho- netic zmn, although } did not normally appear in the name of nZmnw prior to the New Kingdom. 41. Some examples at least as early as Dyn. III, mostly in the phrasepr-nswt "king's domain": Pyr. d degres V, figs. I56, I6I, 162, 164, pp. 78-90, pls. 9 (I), 22 (9), 32 (5); probably also fig. 123, p. 69, fig. 147a, p. 76. 8</page><page sequence="5">than those compounded with 0, they are nonetheless appropriate in that each shows a plant "rooted" in a smaller sign at its base. At least nine more Old Kingdom composites of two elements, both of them phonetic, or one phonetic and the other ideographic, bring these elements together in the meaningful way that is sometimes called "spor- tive": a seated man lifts the first sign off;i "lift up" (Figure 4a) ;42 a standing man beats the initial sign of hwi "beat" (Figure 4b) ;43 a man bears the sign hm in 42. The example is from Wild, Ti III, pl. I55. Other examples in Junker, Giza II, fig. 21, p. 155; Davies, Ptahhetep I, pl. 4 (9); Urk. I, pp. 282 (I7), 283 (2), etc. 43.

AsJunker points out, this sign (D33) was often replaced by the meaningless form `-, probably influenced by hieratic (for which see P. Posener-Krieger and J. L. de Cenival, Hieratic Papyri It is, of course, difficult to say how many of the fore- going combinations were invented in the Old King- dom, more particularly in the classical period of the Fourth Dynasty and later, and how many are survivals from earlier times. The inscriptional evidence from the first dynasties is far too incomplete to resolve this question. Finally there are some meaningful composites that are entirely ideographic :'1, an owl being decapitated, occurs as a determinative for hs.k "cut off' in the Pyra- mid Texts;52 ' (T29), a knife on a chopping block, in the word nmt "slaughtering place" is a variant of the form 2` mentioned earlier, replacing an earlier writ- ing that shows the knife well above the block;53 A, a Fifth Dynasty sun temple, adds a solar disk to the tip of the obelisk;54 the sign 1( (MI9) apparently represents an assemblage of offerings.55 The remaining composites are few. A fusion of two phonetic signs occurs in at least two examples of i- hk; "magic," which is essentially an enclosed composite (see note 5). The early Old Kingdom monogram Z remains unexplained, although it evidently refers to a "master builder."56 In the late Old Kingdom the two elements of the name of Osiris are inexplicably con- in the British Museum, Fifth Series: The Abu Sir Papyri [London, 968] Pal. pl. 2 [D 33]).

A similar type of composite appears in an Eleventh Dynasty inscription that places the sign for wh "column" upon the determinative (Figure 6f).70 The same inscription also writes tr "span" with the sign r on the back of the determinative, an ox (Figure 6g).

A new sportive writing of the older variety does seem to sportive compounds that were popular in the Old Kingdom. 148 ?9. CONCLUsIONS. After the First Dynasty, when hieroglyphs were frequently fused in an arbitrary fashion, sometimes with little regard to their picto- graphic reality, combinations of signs generally re- spected that reality to a greater extent. A certain degree of meaning or logic is to be found in nearly all of those that are attested in Old Kingdom inscriptions. A much larger proportion of arbitrary fusions made their ap- pearance toward the end of the Heracleopolitan Pe- riod and in the Middle Kingdom, and in several cases one sign was inappropriately imposed upon another. In the New Kingdom, transverse combinations greatly increased in number, and often at the expense of com- parable alternatives that combined the same elements more discretely-abutted rather than crisscrossed- and this period tolerated the creation of particularly incompatible forms in which an arm or sickle was com- pounded with a bird. It is true that, in the earlier exam- ples of the bird compounds, the incongruity was often mitigated by showing the arm or sickle behind the bird rather than imposed upon it.'49 The latter alternative was at least occasionally preferred before the Amarna Period, however. 50 And by the beginning of the Nine- occur on the wooden base of a statue, probably Dyn. XIX, which shows the name Wsr-Sth with the first word written j. The stand- ing man might be explained as sr (}), echoing the final consonants of wsr (p): Florence 7666 [sic] (A. Pellegrini, "Glanures," Recueil de travaux relatifs a la philologie et a l'archeologie egyptiennes et assyriennes 20 [I898] p. 96). At the beginning of the New Kingdom (Urk. IV, p. 46 [6], reign of Amenophis I) the monogram"- serves as a writ- ing of htp di nswt "an offering that the king gives," but this is wholly pictographic; compare J. J. Clere in Studi in memoria di I. Rosellini (Pisa, 1955) pp. 35-38. The later (Dyn. XXV) monogram' for mdd mtn "who adheres to the way" is, on the other hand, an em- blematic writing of the kind that was sometimes employed for per- sonal names: Gunn, Bulletin de l'Institutfranfais d'Archeologie orientale (Cairo) 30 (1930) p. 795, note 2. I49. Thus in the examples from Rekh-mi-Rjc, Private Tombs IV, and Two Sculptors cited in notes I 9, 120, 123. 150. Thus in the example from Le Temple d'Amada cited in note 119, the one cited in note I20 being inconclusive; the first of the two examples from Ramose is similarly inconclusive, while the second shows the arm superimposed on 1. Two examples of are shown in E.

The gradual use of increasingly incongruous combi- nations of hieroglyphs is paralleled by other develop- ments that similarly violated the classical propriety of the Old Kingdom. Whereas Old Kingdom statues, un- like those of the Archaic Period, normally located the identification of the owner on the base or other struc- tural element, or else on some other logical appurte- nance such as a roll of papyrus on the lap or on the belt,I53 the increasingly lengthy inscriptions of later statuary gradually spread to other clothed areas of the body until finally, toward the reign of Tuthmosis III, inscriptions began to be placed on unclothed areas of the body as well.154 An even closer parallel may be seen in the treatment of the animal legs of furniture. While stretchers were placed between plain legs of chairs from the Old Kingdom onward, it was not until the reign of Amenophis III that such structural support was ever attached to legs of animal form.155 1 5 I.

Here one may also note the curious example in relief from the temple of Ramesses II at Abydos 7 , X FIGURE 1O .* : : :: . (Figure io), shown by Weigall, ASAE II (1911), p. 174, fig. 4, where the arm-sign is held by the wing of the quail chick. 153. A very few Old Kingdom statues do show an inscription on the kilt: MFA 12.1488; Berlin 8430 (Aeg. Inschr. I, p. 69); CG 76, 268(?); such examples are so rare that they may be con- sidered "exceptions that prove the rule." For inscriptions on the belt see Cairo CG 37, 89, 196,20 I; MMA 26.2.7 and CairoJ. 67369 (same person: A. H. Zayed, Trois ttudes d'lgyptologie [Cairo, 1956] p. 8; inscribed scepter of same, p. 2). 154. MFA 29.7.28 (cartouche of Tuthmosis III on shoulder: Dunham, JEA 5 [1929] p. 164 and pl. 32); Cairo CG 42123 (same cartouche and location); University Museum, Philadelphia, The last example in particular demonstrates that even in those cases where naturalistic forms were in- complete, there was, for many centuries, a great deal of resistance to the idea of amalgamating such forms with elements that were felt to be incompatible. For this reason, and in view of the gradual and progressive development of hieroglyphic combinations that might be considered incongruous, one may fairly conclude not only that the Old Kingdom scribe failed to invent a composite form such as 'q' but that he would, as a rule, have rejected it; and that the scribe of both the Old and Middle Kingdoms would similarly have re- jected a form such as -1. Perhaps the Eighteenth Dy- nasty scribe would have felt later forms such as ~ and ito be equally outlandish. Furthermore, although this evolution tended to disregard the concrete forms of hieroglyphs, it rarely, if ever, originated in the more abstract and cursive form of writing known as hieratic, where ligatures are frequent, but was, from first to last, essentially a hieroglyphic phenomenon.i56 The parallel that is to be drawn from the migration of inscriptions on statuary is scarcely less instructive. Here, as in following the evolution of composite hiero- E. Io980 (name of owner on upper arm: D. Randall-MacIver and C. L. Woolley, Buhen [Philadelphia, 191 I] pi. 36); the last example is evidently at least as early as the others. 55. An early Eighteenth Dynasty stool with highly conven- tionalized lion's legs (CairoJ. 43 65) has stretchers at the front and rear (Earl of Carnarvon and Howard Carter, Five rears' Explora- tions at Thebes [London, 1912] pi. 71); the earliest examples with stretchers between naturalistic lion's legs occur in the furniture of S;t-'Imn, the daughter of Amenophis III: T. M. Davis, Tomb of louiya and Touiyou (London, 1907) pls. 33-34 (chair, Cairo CG 511 3); pi. 37 (bed, Cairo CG 51110). In the Amarna Period, stretchers (and sometimes braces as well) were placed between the animal legs on either side (N. de G. Davies, Rock Tombs of El Amarna II [London, I905] pls. I4, 38; V [1908] pls. 21, 23). This subject will be dealt with more fully in a forthcoming monograph on Egyp- tian chairs. I56. There are possibly a few exceptions. Old Kingdom, and Dyn. XI-XII r are only known to me in the hieratic inscriptions of Hatnub (notes 6 , 80). The form'^- is known earlier in hieratic than in hieroglyphic script (note 89 above), and hieratic occurs in a Dyn. XII copy of the Story of Sinuhe (B214: A. M. Blackman, Middle-Egyptian Stories [Brussels, 1932] p. 33). Most curiously, the form J (for ') seems to occur repeatedly in a Sixth Dynasty papyrus from Elephantine: G. Moller, Hieratische Palao- graphie I (Leipzig, I909) no. I49; the hieroglyphic equivalent is found in Hyksos names, as Moller notes, and it occasionally makes a reappearance in names of the Ramesside Period (e.g. K. Kitchen, Ramesside Inscriptions [Oxford, I969-I974] II, p. I86 [9]; VI, p. i6 '7</page><page sequence="14">glyphs, we may trace an ever-widening breach in the unity of art and writing, which was so well respected in the Old Kingdom. That unity was never entirely lost, but hieroglyphic writing thereafter tended to follow its own evolution and to be used for its own sake, with less regard for the naturalistic aspect of the hieroglyphs, or for the forms upon which they were inscribed. The emblematic creations of the late New Kingdom might seem to revive the spirit of meaningful sportive monograms that were invented in the Archaic Period and (perhaps) in the Old Kingdom, and which, in many cases, continued in use, but the later writings of names are less meaningful and often highly contrived. This insistence on emblematic writing for its own sake must, in fact, be regarded as yet a further step away from Old Kingdom tradition. ABBREVIATIONS Aeg.
