<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES AND CORRESPONDENCE 349 NOTES AND CORRESPONDENCE A Longish Note on Ursula K. Le Guin's Lavinia. Ursula K. Le Guin's Lavinia is a beautifully written addition to Le Guin's canon and a fine novel. If it gets the attention it deserves, it will also be a controversial work. Lavinia gives voice to Lavinia, wife of Trojan Aeneas and mother of Silvius; the political overplot is the origin of Rome. Lavinia is a dead White European woman with a vengeance, a progenitor (legend has it) of the West's greatest empire and a character in the Aeneid by Publius Vergilius Maro (Vergil or Virgil?take your pick on the spelling). Le Guin's novel gives Lavinia a voice, but the novel is silent on a number of other topics, including the history of Rome foreshadowed in the shield of Aeneas and the history some readers bring to the novel. Virgil appears in spirit, but we get only a hint or two in Lavinia about Virgil's enthusiasm for Octavius Caesar, or Caesar Augustus, the first Roman Emperor, who put paid finally to the dying and corrupt Roman Republic. For people like my ancient history instructor, who drew Roman/US analogies, Virgil's support of the Empire should be a problem: our heroes should be those who honorably and for the public good resist one-man rule (when one can find such heroes). In her Afterword to Lavinia, Le Guin rewrites to new purpose the line Tacitus assigns to a British chieftain: " ubi solitudinemfaciunt, pacem appellant" (Where they make a desert, they call it 'peace' [277]); but there is nothing specific in the novel on the rape of the Sabine women, figured on the shield of Aeneas (the shield is seen in the novel) and there is nothing on the atrocities behind "the grandeur that was Rome" (Poe), no undermining of Virgil as a poet of Empire and imperialism. Le Guin's novel is friendly to Virgil and nonjudgmental on Rome. To tell one story is to leave out or de-emphasize other stories; and critics?who are often more judgmental than is healthy?should (eventually) argue about the gaps and silences in Lavinia, about the novel's politics. I am judgmental on Rome, seeing no reason to condemn modern empires while giving the earlier ones a pass. Still, as Le Guin says in her Afterword, what draws her is not the Empire but "early Rome: the dark, plain Republic, a forum not of marble but of wood and brick, an austere people with a strong sense of duty, order, and justice: ... extended families whose worship was of the fire in their hearth, the food in their granary, the local spring, the spirits of place and earth." This was a culture where "Women were not set apart as chattel" and where "slaves of the household ... sat at table with the free" (278-79). Even the early Republic is in the distant future at the end of the novel. Lavinia is not responsible for the Empire and cannot be blamed for it any more than Eve?or the she-wolf who suckled Romulus and Remus?or a terrorist like Crassus (Swain 302, 305), or that mass murderer of Germans, Julius Caesar, or Jews, Hadrian (about half a million apiece, impressive given the populations involved and the limited means by which people could be "massacred" or "slaughtered" [Swain 326, 515]). Crassus was, unfortunately, historical; Lavinia is pretend.</page><page sequence="2">350 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 35 (2008) What interests me most in Lavinia is something that Lavinia, the narrator, presents to us in detail: the religion of really ancient Italy and its implications for Le Guin on the modal "must." Latin worship in Lavinia (as in history) is not much directed toward personified gods of the Olympian fashion, but, as Le Guin says in her own voice, to the older powers of earth and sky and household, immanent in the world and woven inextricably into everyday life. We get an idea of what in this world it is right to do, including one very specific explanation of what Le Guin means by "must." I once asked Le Guin, "What do you mean by 4must'?"?I think at the 1978 convention of the Science Fiction Research Association (Cedar Falls, IA). She responded with something like this: "You are free; do what you must do ...? I guess I like paradoxes." Le Guin hasn't changed her mind since 1978?or since Ged told Arren in The Farthest Shore in 1972 that a mage might offer this advice to a king: "My lord, do nothing because it is righteous or praiseworthy or noble...; do only that which you must do and which you cannot do any other way" (67). There is a similar idea in City of Illusions (1967), when the young Werelian Orry explains the Kelshak concept of "rale": "the right thing to do, like learning things in school, or like a river following its course" (136). As Ogion tells Ged in A Wizard ofEarthsea, if a man "would not be a stick whirled and whelmed in the stream, he must be the stream itself (128 [cf. Lavinia 141]). You must follow the Dao, become the Dao ("Tao" in the older romanization). But that is mage-talk, philosophy or high-powered mysticism, and Le Guin has put a lot of effort into bringing the idea down to Earth, giving it concrete manifestation. In her poetry and fiction, and emphatically in the 1985 screenplay King Dog (1985), Le Guin has performed the poet's function to give to such "airy nothing" various realized local habitations and names, as in her use of Shiva and Kali in her poetry for the Dao's creation and destruction (Erlich ch. 17), as in the entire world-view and Way of the Telling in the novel by that name, and in other places in her canon. In Lavinia, we get a term like "rale," but one embedded in real Latin and in a very literally pagan religion?a religion of the pagus of farm folk (276; Afterword). It is embedded, too, in a world-view on the large scale and a very specific moment of narrative on the small. In Lavinia, the time-tripping spirit of the dying Virgil comments on the underworld as "a terrible place. On the far side of the dark river are marshy plains, where you hear crying?little, weak, wailing cries, from the ground, everywhere, underfoot. They are the souls of babies who died at birth or in the cradle, died before they lived. They lie there on the mud, in the reeds, in the dark, wailing. And no one comes" (61; Aeneid VI.426-29). Virgil knows because "I was there." But not with Aeneas; that was the Sybil. Maybe with a person some readers will recognize as Dante in the Inferno. Yet that cannot be right, since Circle 1 (Canto IV) does not have wailing babies: a lot of sighing there, but not wailing. Wherever the justifiably confused Virgil got the idea of the suffering infants, Lavinia finds it appalling. "If you invented that marsh full of miserable dead crying babies, it was a misinvention." Correcting the poet, she tells him "It was wrong," and tells us, "I was extremely angry. I used the second most powerful</page><page sequence="3">NOTES AND CORRESPONDENCE 351 word I know, wrong, nefas, against the order of things, unspeakable, unsacred. There will be many words for it, but that was the one I knew. It is only the shadow, the opposite, the undoing, of the great word fas, for the right, what one must do" (61-62). Condemning babies to limitless pain is evil, nefas?period. Lavinia's immediate reaction is a place where ethical thought can start. But philosophical sorts, distrustful of "Ethical Intuitionism" (or sentimentalism) can legitimately ask of fas: What one must do in terms of bleeding what? Not the will of Jupiter, who is not around yet, but in terms of what your Genius (if a man) or Juno (if a woman [64-65]) senses you must do in terms of that which is. In Lavinia, the world that is, the world we see, is, among other things, a world in which people take care of crying babies. More is at stake here than just custom and figurative social taboos, because the world of Lavinia is numinous: "The world is sacred, of course," Lavinia tells us, with an "of course" equivalent to the one a writer of sf throws in after introducing some novum implausible and awe-inspiring to us but presumably a matter of course in the future. The world "is full of gods, numina, great powers and presences. We give some of them names?Mars of the fields and the war," and separating tame from wild (208)?"Vesta the fire, Ceres the grain, Mother Tellus the earth, the Penates of the storehouse. The rivers, the springs. And in the storm cloud and the light is the great power called the father god. But they aren't people. They don't love and hate, they aren't for or against," unlike the Juno of Virgil's story (who hates the Trojans), whose appearance in Virgil's story-telling to Lavinia sparks her meditation on numina, lares, and penates. For Lavinia?and the reality she narrates?the powers "accept the worship due them, which augments their power, through which we live" (65; cf. also traditional beliefs in Ansul in UKL's Voices). That which is, is, and is sacred; to go against the order of things is desecration, a violation of fas, an unmaking, nefas. Le Guin's pius Aeneas acts worthily?the word is arlesh on Werel (CI 136)?because he consciously tries to do what is right. Lavinia has grown up with the minimally anthropomorphic gods, powers, and presences of the Latins and has developed more of a knack at following fas. She knows the order of things and chooses to follow an oracle, accepting her destiny/fate to marry Aeneas, come of it what comes (there is a fas even in war, which is what her decision brings [Lavinia 198]). In such a world, doing what one must also can mean doing something highly unusual and downright weird: following an oracle and marrying a stranger, someone claiming to come from the end of the world, coming to some sort of promised land?Italy? among the barbarous Latins??from Troy. And so she and Aeneas do what they must do and fulfill a destiny, following their sense of honor and the "sacred powers" (128), performing "the will of heaven and earth" (149). In the world of Lavinia, the "father god" is still just the semi-personified power of light and storm, not yet Zeus or Jupiter, much less a Semitic One-God separating sacred from profane and laying down universal Law. Still, there is a Tightness inherent in things, and a wrongness.</page><page sequence="4">352 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 35 (2008) "Sic fas aut nefas": a villain unoriginally balances while moving toward an atrocity involving another Lavinia in Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus (2.1.133-35): "Be it right or wrong." With consistent emphasis, Le Guin has presented us with worlds that offer us choices among varieties of right and wrong. Without gods to command or forbid (FS 137), Le Guin still wants us to make those choices, and presents/as and nefas?by whatever names?as a choice that is meaningful and a sacred duty.?Richard D.
