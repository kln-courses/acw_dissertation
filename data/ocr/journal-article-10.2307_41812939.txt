<plain_text><page sequence="1">Wives, Widows and Children: War Victims in Iliad Book II1 To Erika In the Diapeira ("trial"), the episode that precedes the "Catalogue of Ships" in Iliad Book II, both Agamemnon (110-41)2 and Odysseus (285-332) utter speeches that are not only complexly interconnected, but also strongly built upon the Trojan tradition as a whole.3 Agamemnon's deceptive speech, a tactic devised to test and motivate his men, causes the army's stampede. Odysseus' commanding speech, delivered after he scolds and punishes Thersites, restores the morale of the troops (333-335). The former speech almost causes the untimely end of the war, whereas the later is the first step towards the resumption of the fight. Critics have already pointed to the many lexical and thematic echoes that correlate Agamemnon's speech with Odysseus's.4 Nevertheless, one point has not been properly discussed so far: the lexical and semantic coincidences between the expressions ocXo^oi xaì vr¡7ua isxva ("wives and infant children", 136) in Agamem- non's speech, and Odysseus's 7iaT8sç vbocqoI T£ yuvaîxsç ("young children and widowed women", 289) and vrjma isxva (311). But what strikes the eye is that, although the wording is similar, the referents are not. Agamemnon mentions the Achaean wives and children who are waiting for their husbands and fathers at home, but Odysseus, in a short comparison, speaks of children and widows generally, and soon after, when he narrates the wonder formerly seen at Aulis, vr¡7iia tshvoc is used by him for the brood of a she-bird. 1 I would like to thank David Konstan, Philippe Rousseau, the audience at the "Homero Revisitado" Colloquium in Belo Horizonte, 2007, the anonymous reader of L'Antiquité Classique , and my friends Robert Brose, Marcos Bulcão and Erica Angliker for their many suggestions, questions and corrections. I am also thankful for the timely assistance of Susan Edmunds, Christopher Ulf and Ingomar Weiler. 2 I follow Martin West's edition of the Iliad (M. West, Homeri Ilias , 2 vols., Stuttgart, 1998-2000) and Helmut van Thiel's of the Odyssey (H. van Thiel, Homeri Odyssea , Hildesheim, 1991). All translation are my own, unless indicated otherwise. 3 A symptom of this complexity is the attempt of the German Analysis to find out, in the words of von der Miihll, the "natürliche und erwartete Fortgang der Erzählung", given the apparent lack of straightforwardness of the narrative (P. von der Mühll, Kritisches Hypom- nema zur Ilias , Basel, 1952, p. 34). Why did the poet fill the narrative between Zeus' message and the march-out of the troops with deceptions, false expectations, mistakes and a quite anomalous character (Thersites)? On the ongoing importance of the Analytic approach - but not necessarily of particular conclusions -, see P. Rousseau, "L'intrigue de Zeus", Europe 865 (2001), p. 120-125; on an early response to the Analytic reading of Book 2, cf. P.G.

WERNER In order to understand the semantic and thematic distinctions that the poet brings about by using (aXo^oi xaí) vÝ]moc isxva, and their consequences to the text, I shall use a double strategy. On the basis of the diachronic relation between formula and theme discussed by Gregory Nagy,5 and on John M. Foley's notion of "traditional referentiality,"6 I will first circumscribe the traditional meaning of the expression OLkoyoi xai vr)7tioc isxva. Secondly, I will analyze how ako^oi xaì vrj7cia isxva and vrj7ua isxva are used by Agamemnon and Odysseus in Iliad Book II in a way that supposes the oral nature of the Homeric poems, that is, the reception of the text by an audience that is not necessarily familiar with everything we label as "traditional."7 Finally, in the third section I will discuss the meaning of the phrase 7iaT8sç vbolqoì Xf)Qocí ib yuvaTxsç and argue that this expression, whose traditional character can not be attested, may also have a connotative meaning. I will delimit that meaning with reference to certain themes and motifs linked to the figure of the widow in the Iliad, and in doing so I will be suggesting that when our knowledge of what is traditional falls short, we may also take into account the plan underlying the monumental poem. Therefore, although I shall not discuss how the Homeric poems may have been fixed and transmitted, I would like to specify the paradigms I have followed. I assume that the Iliad and the Odyssey display a poetic language that evolved long before the form by which we know both poems was given to them. Because I intend to discuss how traditional themes and expressions could be used by a singer who was used to an audience familiar with the traditional resonance of - at least some of - them, it is important to say in addition that I do not mean that it was indispensable for a success- ful performance that every member of an ancient audience should be thoroughly familiar with the traditional language employed by a bard, nor is it necessary to suppose that every bard employed the same traditional expressions.8 Finally, my ana- lysis shows that beneath the poem lays the conception of a unified whole that may be due to the epic tradition and most probably - but not necessarily - also to the plan of a master poet.9 5 Gregory Nagy' s conclusion is formulated like this in G. Nagy, Greek Mythology and Poetics , Ithaca, 1990, p. 23: "In sum, the diachronic viewpoint suggests that the prime regulator of Homeric epithet in particular and formula in general is traditional theme rather than current meter ." See also C. Watkins, How to Kill a Dragon : Aspects of Indo-European Poetics, New York, 1995, p. 17. See, for example, J.M. Foley, Immanent Art: From Structure to Meaning in Tradi- tional Oral Epic , Bloomington/Indianapolis, 1991, p. 7: "Traditional elements reach out of the immediate instance in which they appear to the fecund totality of the entire tradition, defined synchronically and diachronically, and they bear meanings as wide and deep as the tradition they encode." Cf. R. Scodel, Listening to Homer: Tradition, Narrative , and Audience , Ann Arbor, 2002. 8 Cf. Foley, o.e. (n. 6), p. 42-45; Scodel, o.e. (n. 7), p. 11-13; and A. Kelly, A Refe- rential Commentary and Lexicon to Homer , Iliad VIII , Oxford, 2007, p. 9-14. The bibliography on this vexed question is enormous; see more recently A. Kahane, Diachronic Dialogues: Authority and Continuity in Homer and the Homeric Tradition , Lanham, 2005, p. 46-56.</page><page sequence="3">WIVES, WIDOWS AND CHILDREN: WAR VICTIMS IN ILIAD BOOK II 3 The traditional meaning of &amp;Xo%oi xal vrjma xéxva In the Homeric poems, vrj7iia xéxva comes always after the C2 caesura (the bucolic diairesis).10 In order to discuss the expression, the following patterns must also be stressed: 1) When the singular of vr]7uoç (nominative or accusative) is used to qualify a word for "son" or "child," the adjective always occupies the position mentioned above (after C2). Yet the noun may immediately follow it (II. V, 480; V, 688; VI, 366) or be in a different position (before A2: VI, 400; after B2: XXII, 484 and XXIV, 726); 2) vr]7iia xéxva is usually - but not always (II. II, 31 1; XI, 1 13) - introduced by a prepositive xoci ("and": II, 136; IV, 238; VI, 95; VI, 276; VI, 310; XVII, 223; XVIII, 514; XXII, 63; XXIV, 730); in that case, it is immediately preceded by a phrase built around aXo)(ot/ocXó)(oi&gt;ç ("wives"),11 as in al 8é nou r¡piéxeQaí ť äXoxoi xat vr¡7iia xéxva ("they, our wives and infant children", II, 136). Therefore, whenever I use the expression vXoyoi xal vr¡7iia xéxva below it will be in reference to this construction, with aXo^oi as a short form of the multiform phrase. 2.1) All three attestations of the expression in the Odyssey present deflections from the pattern: in XII, 42, the word that precedes the xat is a singular noun (yuvrj, and not òcXo^oç), and in both this passage and XIV, 264 (= XVII, 433; there the word for "wives" is yuvaixaç) it is not accompanied by any adjective or adnominal genitive as in the Iliad. Therefore, I shall not count these occurrences under the heading cx'o%oi xal vr)7iia xéxva.12 2.2) Concerning the verses mentioned in (1), in the first pattern (a noun following vr]7uov), there is also an aXo^oi before a xai; but when the noun is sepa- rated from its adjective, the alo^oi expression is missing. Therefore, considering these metrical, syntactic, and semantic patterns we are entitled to conclude that a^o^oi xal vr)7tia xéxva is a traditional expression,13 and that the phrase vr]7iia xéxva is somehow related to it. We must now find out its connotative, traditional meaning.14 10 On Hermann Frankel' s notation, see H. Fränkel, Wege und Formen frühgriechischen Denkens , München, 1955, p. 104. 1 1 On II. XXII, 62-63, an apparent exception that confirms the rule, see below. In the kind of analysis I am proposing here, it seems to be methodologically sounder to avoid material from the Odyssey, see Kelly, o.e. (n. 8), p. 9-10. Examining the passages in the Odyssey would force us to discuss the thematic particularities of each poem, and that is beyond the scope of this paper. 13 According to J. Latacz, C. Brügger, M. Stoevesandt, E. Visser, Homers Ilias, Gesamtkommentar: Band II: Zweiter Gesang ( B % München, 2003, ad II, 136, äXoxoi xal vrjrcia xéxva is a formula that may be enlarged by way of an epithet. 14 I am not interested in the lexical meaning of vr)7iioç; in the case of an expression like the one I am investigating, according to Foley, o.e. (n. 6), p. 24-25, "the primary concern must be a word's or phrase's métonymie meaning."</page><page sequence="4">4 Chr. WERNER Based on John M. Foley's notion of "traditional referentiality," we may suppose that whenever uXo^oi xai vr] nicc xsxva is used in the Iliad its referent is never only "women and children."15 The referent is metonymically defined by the tradition as a whole, and so it conveys a conferred, connotative meaning. In order to grasp that meaning, we must examine all the attestations of the expression in the poem. olKoxoi xai vr|7ita xsxva describes in seven out of a total of eight occurrences in the Iliad a group of potential or actual war victims, helpless women and children of a city that is defended by its warlike men or that is ravaged and destroyed by the enemy.16 I call them war victims despite the fact that the city where they live has usually not yet been taken. If it is taken, the women will be turned into slaves, concubines or even wives of the conquerors, and male children may be killed. What defines these victims thematically is a war; the expression is never used outside that context.17 The status quo of the city is linked to the fate of these people. If it is pene- trated by the enemy, its male population will be annihilated and the vloypi xai vr]7tia xsxva treated as war spoils.18 aXo^oi xai vrjma xsxva is used with this sense only once by an Achaean. In IV, 238, Agamemnon mentions the wives and children of the enemy as among the spoils to be conveyed home after the destruction of Troy. The expression turns up again in VI, 95 (same verse in VI, 276 and VI, 310), and from this verse onwards, usually in a context where their aaxu ("city") is also mentioned, the wives and children referred to by the expression belong to an endangered city that needs the protection of gods, warriors and its walls. These are the circumstances conjured up by Hektor when he justifies the allies' assembling (XVII, 223); this is also the case of the besieged city depicted on Akhilleus's shield (XVIII, 514). According to the perspective of the Iliad, the fate of the Trojan women and children, along with that of the whole city, is bound to Hektor' s destiny. If he is killed, everybody knows that no one will be able to secure Troy anymore. When Priam urges Hector not to fight Akhilleus alone, he cannot imagine anything but destruction, violated women, and dead vr]7iia xéxva (XXII, 61-63). When the best of the Trojans is finally dead, Priam's prediction is taken one step further into reality in Andromakhe's picture of a devastating future for women and vrj7iia xsxva (XXIV, 729-32). At the end of the poem, the ultimate Trojan vision matches the original Achaean desire. 15 Cf. Foley, o.e. (n. 6), p. 6-8. In XVIII, 514-51 5, old men are added to women and children. 17 Such a traditional context is more specific than the one defined by S. Edmunds, Home- ric Nêpios, New York, 1990, p. 25-30. According to her, "the contextual framework of the phrase vrjma xéxva can be considered an associative unit - that is, a complex of contextual elements that tend to appear together and gain a certain semantic value by their association with each other" (p. 30). That is certainly correct, but I hope to demonstrate that what frightens these children is not generally "the fact or imminence or possibility of doom or destruction" (p. 28), but specifically the destruction provoked by war. 18 In the Iliad , a poem whose story is built around a war, the expression displays a pattern, as showed above, absent in the Odyssey , an index of its central thematic relevance to the poem.</page><page sequence="5">WIVES, WIDOWS AND CHILDREN: WAR VICTIMS IN ILIAD BOOK II 5 Nevertheless, the expression refers on one occasion (II, 136) to what we could call indirect war victims, women and children whose husbands and fathers are fighting not in front of their city, but in a distant land. If ocko^oi xoci vrjTuoc tbxvoc points in fact to the "war against a city" theme, what happens if the same expression is employed in a return context? Heroes who defend their city are protecting their families who live inside; what about heroes who are absent from home? What amount of danger do their families face? In other words, may both parties in a war suffer similar consequences regarding their families? Even if the narrator is talking in both contexts (direct and indirect victims) about weak creatures whose safety is at stake because husbands and fathers are not able to protect them, we may suppose that a poet telling a war story could be inte- rested in showing and emphasizing the immediacy of the danger that menaces the people of the city under siege. During the performance of such a story, the destiny of these very people plays an important role in the poet's task of inducing pathos in his audience.19 Therefore, I am arguing that whenever the idiom alo^oi xoci vr]7iia tsxvoc turns up in the Iliad , it evokes, for a Greek audience familiar with the traditional idiom, the most terrible consequences the inhabitants of a besieged city may suffer. It is used almost only by characters (XVIII, 514 is the sole exception) and especially in two sorts of speeches, exhortations and laments,20 themselves among the commonest speech-acts in the poem.21 Exhortations and laments obviously belong to the context of war, in which victory or defeat is always desired, feared or mourned. But these genres are also deeply linked to the poetic protocol of the Iliad according to which every action that grants someone xXéoç ("fame") also brings others 7iév0oç ("grief').22 This is another indication that ockoxoi xoci vrj7iia tsxvoc is indeed a traditional phrase and that its use by the narrator may have other than merely pathetic consequences. (SX,o%oi xoci) vrjTcia xéxvoc in Iliad Book II The expression aXoyoi xoci vrj7cia isxva turns up almost at the end of the speech with which Agamemnon tests his army (II, 136), and the image it evokes contributes to the eagerness the Achaeans show when they run towards their ships. 19 On the many ways the Homeric narrator may provoke pathos, see, e.g., J. Griffin, Homer on Life and Death , Oxford, 1980, p. 103-142. 20 Lament: XXIV, 730; exhortations: IV, 238; VI, 95; and XVII, 223. Verses VI, 276 (request) and VI, 310 (pray) do not belong to an exhortation, but are repetitions of an order given before in an exhortation (VI, 95). Verse XXII, 63 is uttered by Priamos in a request whose diction foreshadows the fall of the city; so here we have again some features of a lament. 21 Cf. R. Martin, The Language of Heroes: Speech and Performance in the Iliad , Ithaca, 1989, p. 43-68. 22 Cf., e.g., Iliad VII, 81-91. On the relation between xXéoç, 7iév0oç and lament, see, among others, G. Nagy, The Best of the Achaeans: Concepts of the Hero in Archaic Greek Poetry , Baltimore, 19992, p. 94-117; K. Derderian, Leaving Words to Remember: Greek Mourning and the Advent of Literacy , Leiden, 2001, p. 15-62; C. DuÉ, Homeric Variation on a Lament by Briseis , Lanham, 2002; and Kahane, o.e. (n. 9), p. 174-188.</page><page sequence="6">6 Chr. WERNER The phrase "and they, I think, our wives and infant children, are seated in the houses expecting us" (136-137) focuses on what the Achaeans are possibly missing the most, what is highly precious for them and which they have left behind: property and family.23 The riches and glory they would obtain by conquering Troy, alluded to by Agamemnon (1 13-1 15), are not desirable enough considering Zeus' s intervention, the power of the allies of Troy, and their own rotting ships (1 10-135).24 But the women and children mentioned by the king the way he does are part of an impossible story, the untimely end of the war and the Achaeans' immediate return home. Final defeat by Agamemnon's army is not going to happen as he proclaims in verse 141, a defeat that is as contrary-to-fact and non-traditional as would be an immediate meeting between the Achaeans and their wives and children, characters who do not belong to the story built around the attack against Troy. Agamemnon's speech and the soldiers' reaction simulate an event that could have happened, but that was not part of the epic tradition.25 The non-traditional nature of such a story-to-be is set forth by a traditional expression in an unusual context. But can we really determine what the expression a^o^oi xai vr]7iioc isxva means in Agamemnon's speech? Is he referring to these women and children as potential indirect war victims, women and children who may suffer if a husband and father does not return home? In that case, Agamemnon would be talking like Hektor, the prince who protects his city. Or could the poet be using this idiom to allude to the traditional plot of Agamemnon's betrayal by his wife and her lover?26 If so, the poet would also be suggesting that a vócruoç does not guarantee a safe meeting between husband and wife. "Then, for the Argives, a return might have happened before the appointed time, if Hera had not..." (155-56).27 This is the first "if-not"-situation in the Iliad, a 23 Together with "dear country" (cpíXrjv 7iaiQÍôa ycuocv ), mentioned by Agamemnon in verse 140, "die grössten und kleinsten Elemente des Heimatbegriffs," according to A. Seibel, Volksverführung als schöne Kunst : Die Diapeira im zweiten Gesang der Ilias als ein Lehrstück demagogischer Ästhetik, Frankfurt am Main, 1994, p. 108. See also II. XV, 661-666. This same triad is what concerns the wandering Odysseus in the Odyssey ; cf., e. g., Od. V, 41-43. 24 Cf. Seibel, o.e. (n. 23), p. 99-109. 25 On the danger of an impending return as a common motif in the Iliad , cf. K. Reinhardt, Die Ilias und ihr Dichter, ed. U. Hölscher, Göttingen, 1961, p. 107-109. 26 I agree with the anonymous referee of this journal that there is no direct allusion in the text; any allusion would depend on a reader comparing Agamemnon's traditional fate with his formulation in verses 136-137. On the ways the Iliad incorporates other epic traditions - here, the Nostoi - see Nagy, o.e. (n. 22), p. 42-43; and Rousseau, I.e. (n. 3), p. 120-158. On the difficulty of affirming if a passage in the Homeric poems was intended to be understood as an allusion, see G. Danek, "Traditional referentiality and Homeric intertextuality," in F. Montanari, Omero tremila anni dopo, Roma, 2002; and Scodel o.e. (n. 7). By making Agamemnon speak of aXoyoi xaì vrj7tia xéxva, the poet of the Iliad may be alluding to the traditional knowledge according to which war is the first and a return journey the second stage leading to the end of the Heroic Race, a theme present in other speeches in Book II. 27 "Before the appointed time" translates Ò7i80|ioQa; here I follow N. Yamagata Home- ric Morality, Leiden, 1994, p. 113. Another possibility is "contrary to fate"; cf. M. Lang,</page><page sequence="7">WIVES, WIDOWS AND CHILDREN: WAR VICTIMS IN ILIAD BOOK II 7 narrative device very common in the poem and particularly effective here, because it establishes an important issue that will also be dealt with in the following speeches, the Achaeans' vóaioç.28 Thersites, Odysseus, and Nestor mention the return home but not the Achaean women or children, at least not in the way Agamemnon does. However, Thersites calls the Achaeans "Achaean women" (235); Nestor calls them 7iaiaiv v7]7ii(X)coiç ("young children", 337-38) and Odysseus not only compares the army to widows and infants (289), but also uses the expression vr]7uoc tsxvoc when making a reference to young birds. I now turn to this expression. In the Iliad , the phrase vrj7iia tsxvoc occurs alone, that is, without an explicit term for wife, three times. In Book XXII, when Priam urges Hektor not to fight Akhilleus alone, he foresees what will be the grim end of Troy if his son stays outside the walls and meets what would then be his inevitable death (38-76). He focuses on his family and himself, and among the victims he mentions the vr]7uoc tsxvoc (63). He does not name wives explicitly, but he numbers not only his daughters and daughters- in-law among the victims, but an even more pathetic equivalent, "the wasted rooms" (62-65). 29 Oatax|jioi does not necessarily refer to nuptial chambers, but these are alluded to by a possible evocation of the "war victims" theme by means of part of a traditional expression (vr¡7iia tsxvoc) and by a reference to rape (s&gt;.xy]Osíaocç, 62)30. This violent act is not explicitly mentioned in the Homeric poems very often.31 How- ever, that does not mean it could not have been traditionally associated with the "war victims" theme. In XI, 101-121, Agamemnon, during his ocqictcsíoc, kills two of Priam's sons, Isos and Antiphos. The narrator tells us that both were previously captured by Akhilleus, who released them for a ransom. Not only this anecdote, but also the ensuing simile, in which vr]7uoc tsxvoc (113) refers to fawns killed by a lion in the absence of their mother (a substitute for üXoypi), add pathos to an ocQKxustoc marked "Unreal conditions in Homeric narrative," GRBS 30 (1989), p. 5-26 (here p. 9). But see B. Louden, "Pivotal contrafactuals in Homeric epic," CA 12 (1993), p. 181-198 (here p. 187), on the polysemy of Ò7iép[iopa. 28 Louden, I.e. (n. 27), p. 184 points up that a pivotal contrafactual (what I.J.F. de Jong, Narrators and Focalizers: The Presentations of the Story in the Iliad , London, 20042, p. 68, terms "if not"-situations; cf. also Kelly, o.e. [n. 8], p. 128-131) "is an emphatic method for changing the direction of the plot." In that case, its use in Iliad Book II may be particularly ironic, because the twisting or twisted events of the book (Agamemnon's trial and Thersites' outburst), even if they seem to menace Zeus' s plan, that is unfolded at the beginning of the book (II, 1-34), in fact contribute to it. On other equally possible functions of an "if-not" situa- tion like II, 155-156, see B. Louden, p. 186-187 ("to stress incidents that are, in fact, outside Homer's tradition"; "to heighten the sense of climax"); de Jong, p. 74; and Lang, I.e. (n. 27), p. 10. 29 Even if Priam's words are understood as allusions to the particular events of the sack of Troy (Cassandra's rape, Astuanax's being hurled down from the walls, Deiphobos's killing, Helen's capture), they also certainly depict the fate of the whole city. 30 On this verb, see also Od. XI, 580. 31 For example, in II. II, 354-356.</page><page sequence="8">8 Chr. WERNER by "the ruthlessness of Agamemnon's killing."32 "The anthropomorphic vocabulary used for the fawns increases the pathos we feel for the mother."33 Unlike Hektor in Iliad XXIV, these two warriors are the object of a lament not by the women of their family, but by the narrator himself, who stresses the sadness of their untimely death. V7]7iia TBxva is also used in reference to animals in II, 311, when Odysseus recounts the Achaeans the portent they all once witnessed at Aulis (301-321). A pre- dator (snake), a mother (bird; again a substitute for aXo^oi) and her eight fledglings (v7]7iia TBxva) build together an image that not only tells, according to Kalkhas' inter- pretation, how long it would take for Troy to fall (322-329), 34 but also refers to the Trojan wives and children that will be "swallowed up" by the conquering Achaeans.35 32 O. Taplin, "Agamemnon's role in the Iliad in C. Pelling (ed.), Characterization and Individuality in Greek Literature , Oxford, 1990, p. 72. On the use of anecdotes and similes to provide pathos, see J.B. Hainsworth, The Iliad : A Commentary , vol. 3, Books IX-XII, Cambridge, 1993, ad XI, 91-147. On the pathos of the scene and the destiny of the young Trojans, see W. Schadewaldt, Iliasstudien, Darmstadt, 19663, p. 47; and Griffin, o.e. (n. 19), p. 113-114 (the author stresses the role of Priam as the old sufferer par excellence). On the effects of the simile, see also C. Moulton, Similes in the Homeric Poems , Göttingen, 1977, p. 97; and R. Martin, "Similes and Performance," in E. Bakker, A. Kahane (eds.), Written Voices , Spoken Signs: Tradition, Performance and the Epic Text , Cambridge, Mass., 1997, p. 140-146. 33 So S. Lonsdale, Creatures of Speech: Lion, Herding, and Hunting Similes in the Iliad , Stuttgart, 1990, p. 59. On the interpretation of the numbers involved in the omen, see Seibel, o.e. (n. 23), p. 356-357; and Kahane, o.e. (n. 9), p. 108-109 (with further bibliography). 35 O. Taplin, Homeric Soundings: The Shaping of the Iliad, Oxford, 1992, p. 87, argues that verses 314-316 presage "the way that in the Iliad both the doomed women and children of Troy and their brave defenders will be treated with sympathy and pathos," with the conse- quence that the snake, in its turn, points to the ruthlessness of the Achaean attackers. According to Seibel, o.e. (n. 23), p. 357-359, the nestlings also refer to the cities - and their population - which the Achaeans have been ravaging since they arrived at the Troad, and the sparrow- mother alludes to Troy and its inhabitants, especially the royal family. Later in Iliad Book II the "war victims" theme is used again by Nestor (337-356) in a speech that in many ways dupli- cates that of Odysseus. He does not mention the children of the enemy, but their women are explicitly depicted as a sexual prize (355-356). Nestor does not use the expression vrjTiia xéxva, but compares the Achaeans to 7rociaiv vrjTciá^oiç (337-338). It is not easy to define the tone of Nestor's speech. Von der Mühll, o.e. (n. 3), p. 46-47, expresses his own aesthetic bias when he compares Nestor's speech with Odysseus's and concludes that the former speaks "als müsste erst er mit Schelten die Wendung bringen. Die Gedanken variieren, gröber." For most inter- preters, Nestor's words are not rude, and must be understood in their context. Lohmann, o.e.

Seibel, p. 393-411 insists on the differences between the two heroes and defends the necessity of Nestor's speech. Cf. also H. Roisman, "Nestor the Good Counsellor," CQ 55 (2005), p. 17-38 (here p. 28), who affirms that the speech shows "aptness to the listeners and the occasion."</page><page sequence="9">WIVES, WIDOWS AND CHILDREN: WAR VICTIMS IN ILIAD BOOK II 9 Again we find the same "emotional coloring"36 and the same anthropomorphic voca- bulary used for animals as in the passage in Book XI.37 But this time Odysseus uses the expression to "correct" what Agamemnon has said in II, 136; that is, to emphasize that the only helpless war victims must be the wives and children of the enemy.38 When he tests the army, Agamemnon unfolds many topics that are intended to strengthen in his men the hope and desire for an immediate victory. He suggests, for example, that since the Achaean army is far superior to its enemy, victory should be attainable (122-130). Likewise, if he reminds his men that their wives and children are anxiously waiting for them at home, we may infer that he expects (at least some of) his soldiers to strive for a quick victory, so that they may return as soon as possible. In fact, most of the men of the attacking army left families at home that are, broadly speaking, as helpless as the aXoyoi xorì vrjmoc tsxvoc of the endangered city. In the Homeric poems, Odysseus's, Agamemnon's, and Akhilleus's households, for example,39 face dangers which the absence of the o'ixoç' male ruler, provider and pro- tector cannot avert.40 Nevertheless, it is rare in the Iliad that an Achaean remembers the fragility of his family members, especially of his wife and children.41 36 Taplin, o.e.

Danek, Epos und Zitat: Studien zu den Quellen der Odyssee , Wien, 1997, ad XI, 494-503. In Odyssey XI, 197-203, Odysseus's mother, Antikleia, tells her son that she has not died a "normal" death; longing for him has killed her. 40 After a long absence, there is never a full guarantee that a man will find his oixoç unchanged. On the different measures taken by Agamemnon and Odysseus regarding their olxoi and wives before leaving for Troy, see P. Nieto Hernández, "Odysseus, Agamemnon, and Apollo," CJ 97 (2002), p. 319-334. Whereas in the Odyssey someone might mention the precautions taken by the departing hero, in the Iliad the advice given by a father or father-like figure to his departing son may be evoked by another hero who has also heard it, as in IX, 438- 443 and XI, 769-789. 41 Cf. Nestor's appeal at a crucial moment in XV, 661-666. Akhilleus mentions his father twice and his son once in quite significant moments. The first time, he is mourning Patroklos after Briseis's lament in Book XIX. For him, nothing could be more painful than Patroklos's death, even if his suffering father or young son have died (321-327). His reasons are clear: he always thought he would die in Troy and Patroklos would guarantee that his son would occupy his place in Phthia as his true heir, since Peleus would be dead or very old by then (327-337). Akhilleus's father and son are first and foremost evoked to enhance his present loss and pain; cf. P. Pucci, The Song of the Sirens'. Essays on Homer , Lanham, 1998, p. 110. Something similar happens earlier when Akhilleus is found by a weeping Patroklos and consequently asks him about their fathers, Menoitios and Peleus, though he knows that the tears are for the dying</page><page sequence="10">10 Chr. WERNER Besides, when Agamemnon mentions the long and weary nine years they have already spent in the Troade (134), the warriors could have remembered Kalkhas' prophecy - as does Odysseus later. I submit that on account of his performance of the wonder at Aulis,42 Odysseus is able to lessen the sense of distance and time that sepa- rate the Achaeans from home. For someone listening to the Iliad , the beginning of the Trojan War actually happens in the hie et nunc performed by Odysseus, and so the route Greece-Troy is obliquely figured (at least temporarily) as a one-way journey. Odysseus rebuilds or reinforces the imaginary separation between homeland and besieged city, between the wives and children of the Achaeans and those of the enemy. Kalkhas' s prophecy (and, for the external audience, the "Catalogue of Ships" also) creates and develops a movement whose direction goes from Greece to Troy.43 When Odysseus delivers his performance, the land of the Achaeans - later demar- cated by the "Catalogue of Ships" - is the starting-point of a vector whose direction has a sense that cannot yet be reversed; for the time being, it must end at Troy. The image of the Achaean wives and children could not be more radically effaced by the hero. Odysseus performs a past story and predicts the future by correct- ly remembering that nine years have elapsed since they first arrived at the plains of Argives (XVI, 12-18). Both passages show that a hero fighting far away from his family may care for it, but they also suggest that the hero's present commitment is mainly to his fellows in arms. In Book XXIV, Akhilleus is eventually surprised by the sudden presence of his enemy Priam, and this two men are somehow brought together in an unexpected way by the uncertain fate of Peleus as evoked by Priam (XXIV, 486-542). Far from the battlefield, but in the immi- nence of his own death, Akhilleus has an eye to a suffering Peleus left without his only protect- tor. See also Euripides, Troades , 374-393, where Kassandra considers the relation between the hero and his family and country when she compares the Achaeans' fate with that of the Trojans. Cf. Collins, o.e. (n. 38), p. 23-25. 43 The origin and function of the "Catalogue of Ships" is a vexed question, although there are strong arguments to support the hypothesis that for the audience of the Iliad the Catalogue also evokes the beginning of the war, even if it does not refer directly to the army formerly assembled at Aulis (Aulis is mentioned at the beginning though; cf. verse 496) or alludes to some events that happened after Aulis and makes use of one external prolepsis, concerning the fate of Philoktetes (II, 721-725, on which see de Jong, o.e. [n. 28], p. 88; and K. Usener, Beo- bachtungen zum Verhältnis der Odyssee zur Ilias , Tübingen, 1990, p. 17-38). The Catalogue antecedes, in the poem, the beginning of the battles that lead to Hektor's death, and it belongs to the first seven books, which strongly build upon (or allude to) events that happened before Akhilleus's wrath (see, e.g., W. Kullmann, Die Quellen der Ilias , Wiesbaden, 1960; and S. Richardson, The Homeric Narrator , Nashville, 1990, p. 103-104: the Catalogue as "a sequence of retrospections"). According to E. Visser, Homers Katalog der Schiffe , Stuttgart/ Leipzig, 1997, p. 346-350, the Catalogue was composed to fit the poem, and is not just borrowed from somewhere else. If E. Bakker, Pointing to the Past: From Formula to Perfor- mance in Homeric Poetics , Cambridge, Mass., 2005, p. 80, is correct when he affirms that the Catalogue works "as an expression of the continuing presence of the glorious past in each new performance," we may add that, for a Greek audience, it epitomizes the greatness of the whole Trojan War, a Panhellenic enterprise first adumbrated at Aulis. On the origin of the Catalogue, see J. Latacz, Troy and Homer: Towards a Solution of an Old Mystery , Oxford, 2004, p. 219- 231.</page><page sequence="11">WIVES, WIDOWS AND CHILDREN: WAR VICTIMS IN ILIAD BOOK II 1 1 Troy. In fact, he contributes to the performance of a story,44 the story of the Trojan War built into the story of Akhilleus's wrath. In short, the three occurrences of the expression vrj7iia isxva show that it is intimately related to or even a curtailed form of aXoyoi xoci vrj 7ua isxva. The missing feminine part is always somehow present in the context. Besides, in II, 311 and XI, 113, the mother-figure is impotent to help her offspring, defenseless victims of a terrible doom. Therefore, I submit that theme and diction are traditional, even if it cannot be demonstrated how aXoyoi xoci vr)7iia tbxvoc and vrj7cia tbxvoc are diachro- nically related to each other. In Book II, by mentioning the aXo^ot xai vrjTiia isxva in a way that does not fit into the traditional context of this expression, Agamemnon is contributing to the eruption of an event that, had it not been stopped, could have disrupted the Trojan war as it was traditionally known. The king focuses the attention of his men on their homes, but for us, the external audience of the poem, his speech may also evoke the perils embedded in a return. What is more, if this expression traditionally refers to a key theme of a story like the one told in the Iliad - and I hope to have made out a case for that -, then it is not a surprise that the same expression is used (even though in its curtailed form) to establish that the only wives and children who are really part of the story of the Iliad are Trojan ones. 7iaI8eç veagol x^ea^ Te Yüva^xe£ H 2$$) As mentioned earlier, in the Iliad an Achaean usually does not mention the fragile situation of his family at home. However, when Odysseus urges the army to keep fighting against the Trojans in his paraenesis in Book II, there are two verses that might seem to allude to Achaean wives and children. According to the hero, in the past Agamemnon's army promised "Riov sx7isQaavi' sòisí^sov a7tovssa0ai ("to return after having plundered well-fortified Troy", 288), 45 but now the men are acting shamefully, coç is yccQ rj 7iaí8sç vsaçot ie yuvatxsç / áXkèXoioiv ôôÓQOviai oîxovSs vssaOat ("for like young children and widowed wives / they are lamenting with each other the return home", 289-290). Warlike men who once promised they would conquer a city are now acting like weak creatures who just want to go home. But who exactly are these "young children and widowed wives"? One possibi- lity is that Odysseus compares the soldiers to children and widows who keep lament- ing a vóaioç lost by a dead husband and father 46 Or is it that the soldiers are likened to children and widows because they have been behaving like mourning widows and orphans whose husband and father died when trying to defend their city? We could 44 On the self-referentiality of that passage, see e.g. M. Lynn-George, Epos: Word, Narrative and the Iliad, London, 1988, p. 271-272; Taplin, o.e. (n. 35), p. 88; and G.

WERNER think, for example, of Andromakhe and Astuanax after Hektor's death.47 Can one reading be favored over the other? First of all, I submit that the expression 7iatÔ6ç vsocqoi xrjQoct xe yuvatxBç need not be considered semantically and/or traditionally equivalent to ock)%oi xai vr]7ua TSHva.48 The meanings of the two expressions certainly overlap, as much as a (poten- tial) captive may also be a widow, but there are also semantic and thematic distinc- tions between them that are relevant and need not be traditional. A widow is a woman who has lost her husband and therefore has to mourn him; a captive has lost her city and has to submit to a new master. In the Iliad , only Andromakhe and Odysseus employ the term xrjQr] (VI, 408, 432; XXII, 484, 499; XXIV, 725). Briseis is the other widow of the poem, but she never calls herself a x^ÍQ7)- Nevertheless, the many similarities between their histories and their laments suggest that both are characterized according to the traditional role of the wife whose husband is killed in a war and who is subsequently lead into captivity.49 For example, like Hektor vis-à-vis his wife (VI, 414-28), Patroklos acts as a substitute for Briseis' family (XIX, 291-97). When she laments his death in front of Akhilleus, she presents the dead hero as a key figure in her life, because in the past he stopped her from mourning her husband by promising to her that she would be married to Akhilleus (XIX, 297-99). But through Briseis's lament for Patroklos the poet also evokes Akhilleus' s imminent death.50 Like the other captives in his cabin, Briseis mourns her uncertain future as a captive (XIX, 301-2), but with Akhilleus's following speech (315-37) that uncertainty turns into the certainty of the hero's near death. Patroklos is Akhilleus's surrogate or complement,51 and therefore Briseis is figured as a kind of widow of three men: her own husband, Patroklos, and Akhilleus. What defines Andromakhe and Briseis qua widows in the Iliad is the lament they 47 In what follows, I will concentrate on the widow, because when Andromakhe pro- nounces her laments, in which she always uses the word X^IQ7]* she is in the company of her son and sometimes even addresses him (XXII, 500; XXIV, 732), but he never answers; it is only her voice we hear. He is really a vrj7uoç (= "without 'énoç"), if Bakker,, o.e. (n. 43), p. 113, is right when he considers the possibility that "by way of folk etymology" there could be a link between s7ioç and vrj7iioç. 48 Contra Latacz et al., o.e. (n. 13), ad II, 289. 49 Cf. DuÉ, o.e. (n. 22). On Andromakhe's speech as a lament, see e.g. J.M. Foley, Homer's Traditional Art , University Park, PA, 1999, p. 188-198. On the three-part form of an Iliadic lament, cf. M.

On the first, she reminds Hektor that he means everything to her, since her whole family is already dead and the city of her parents, Thebes, was conquered by the Argives (VI, 413-29).54 Andro- makhe's past points to her possible future: if Hektor dies, she will have nothing, neither family nor city. Therefore, she finishes her speech by counseling her husband to fight the enemy in a prudent way (433-39). Indeed, the fate of Troy depends on this one man (403, 492-93). If he fails, the whole city will have to face the most dire consequences. In his answering speech, Hektor reaffirms his heroic role, but also concedes that Troy will eventually fall and acknowledges that his death will prevent him from seeing the most painful event, Andromakhe's bondage (441-65). This path- etic declaration may suggest that Hektor' s death will be the climax of the poem, but it also reiterates that it means the end of Troy and the enslavement of its entire feminine population. Andromakhe, like every Trojan, is utterly dependent on Hektor's valiance, but nothing she does or says, no matter how close their relationship is, will change his heroic path.55 All her speeches are centered on his death and the ensuing destruction of the city.56 The second time Andromakhe refers to herself as a she is actually mourning a dead husband.57 That it happens over the ramparts of Troy (XXII, 462- 464) is not mere chance; this is the same place where the oko^oi xoà vý]7uoe léxvoc of the menaced city represented on Akhilleus's shield await their fate (XVIII, 514- 515).58 This time, the focus of Andromakhe's speech is her son, Astuanax (XXII, 477- 514). At least since Aristarchus, critics have wondered why she is so pessimistic 52 Briseis's husband may have been Munes, the king of Lurnessos; cf. Pucci, o.e. (n. 41), p. 102-103; and DuÉ, o.e. (n. 22), p. 13-14. 53 Cf. VI, 237-241. 54 As told also in I, 366-367 and II, 69 1 . 55 That is why the poet, in Geoffrey Kirk's words, builds his scene not only with "the contrasting attitudes of Hektor and Andromakhe themselves," but also with "the alternation of heroic themes and more personal ones" (G. Kirk, The Iliad : A Commentary , vol. 2, Books V- VIII, Cambridge, 1990, ad VI, 440-465; see also Foley, o.e. [n. 49], p. 188-189). The ideal marriage between Andromakhe and Hektor belongs to Troy as much as Hektor's heroism and Andromakhes's widowhood point to the end of the city. 56 In Meleager's story in Book IX, Kleopatra, Meleager's wife, convinces her husband to stop the destruction of their city, the killing of the men, and the enslavement of the children and women (590-594); her speech is a supplication (591), but its content could pertain to a lament as well. 57 As in Book XXIV; cf. the verses that frame her laments in Books XXII and XXIV: both laments are marked as yòoç (XXII, 476; XXIV, 723), and each time she is accompanied by a group of weeping women (XXII, 515 = XXIV, 746). 58 Many other details related to Andromakhe's fainting (467-472) point to a climax; cf., e.g., S.L. Schein, The Mortal Hero , Berkeley, 1984, p. 175-177; and Taplin, o.e. (n. 35), p. 126-127.</page><page sequence="14">14 Chr. WERNER about the fate of the young prince.59 In fact, by figuring Astuanax as a young beggar, Andromakhe shows how hard may be the fate of a city without its king and protector. Astuanax stands for the whole city. That is why the poet uses övsiocq ("help, aid") to define the relation between father and son (485-86), a word Hekabe has employed just before to describe Hektor in regard to the Trojans (433-434). It is also the second time the poet explains why Hektor's son has received his name (506-507).60 As in her lament in Book VI, Hektor's absence means that Troy must not exist anymore. The last time Andromakhe calls herself a she again refers to Hektor as the great protector of the city, but the presence of his body and the eminence of his funeral are the ultimate token of the end of the city (XXIV, 728-30). What comes next, is a story the poem will not tell, the fate of the women of Troy and Astuanax's death. At least in the Iliad , a widow is bound to a dead hero, and her lament signals that the fall of his city, the annihilation of its male population and the enslavement (or even death) of the aXoyoi xaì vr¡7iia léxva will soon follow.61 The fate of Andro- makhe qua xriQrj is part of the Iliad story and foreshadows the end of Troy. But the destiny of the ako^oi xaì vrjma léxva qua creatures of a destroyed city, although it is feared or desired throughout the poem, is part of the story only as a kind of external prolepsis.62 This is the case even though, given the scanty Iliadic material, we should not take another step and affirm that in a war story there is a traditional distinction, existing independently from the Iliad , between the role of a widow who mourns a dead hero whose death must be followed by the destruction of his city, and the role of uXoypi xaì vrj7cta léxva, who are completely at the mercy of the conquerors after the devastation of their city.63 However, there are some textual reasons to suppose that if 59 Cf. Richardson, o.e. (n. 39), ad XXII, 477-5 14. 60 Cf. VI, 402-403, verses that appear shortly before Andromakhe' s speech mentioned above. 61 Cf. II. XXIV, 728-740. My interpretation of 7iatôsç veocçoi T£ YUV0"XSÇ does not preclude a socio-historical analysis aimed at reconstructing the real situation of widows and orphans in Archaic Greece. See especially I. Weiler, "Am Rande der homerischen Gesell- schaft: Die Ausgrenzung von Andromache/Astyanax und Thersites", in Berichte vom 2. Öster- reichischen Althistorikertreffen in Mauterndorf im Lungau (4.-6.10.1985), Salzburg, 1987, p. 23-35 (this and other references to such an approach in Latacz et al., o.e. [n. 13], ad II, 289); according to Weiler, through the fates of Andromakhe and Astuanax as depicted in Books 6 and 22 "werden soziale Normen und Verhaltensweisen sichtbar, von denen ich anneh- men möchte, dass sie fur die Zeit des Dichters und seine Umwelt kennzeichnend sind" (p. 27). 62 On this term, see de Jong, o.e. (n. 28), p. 81-90, with further bibliography. 63 The much discussed simile of the captive widow in Odyssey VIII, 521-531 points to such a thematic distinction as the one I am arguing for, but it cannot really be adduced as evi- dence because there is too much controversy around it. Verses 523-525 (obç 8è yuvr) xXaírjai (piXov 7ióatv à[xcpi7ceaouaa, ôç xe êfjç 71qóg0sv ttóXioç Xawv xe nàor'oiv, aaxei xaì xexéeaaiv á piòva) v vrjXeèç ^|xocq) certainly suggest that the woman's husband played a major role defending their city; cf. J. Haubold, Homer's People: Epic Poetry and Social Formation , Cambridge, 2000, p. 37-38 and 94-95. That is the reason why some critics suppose that the simile is an allusion to the Iliadic Hektor; cf. A.J. Podlecki, "Bird omens in the Odyssey ," G&amp;R 14 (1967), p. 14-23 (here p. 18). Nevertheless, if we accept that the simile is built into the</page><page sequence="15">WIVES, WIDOWS AND CHILDREN: WAR VICTIMS IN ILIAD BOOK II 1 5 the Iliad is built around a narrative plan,64 and if Hektor's and Andromakhe' s fate are important parts of that plan, then the °f 289 are supposed to face a destiny similar to that of Andromakhe.65 If Odysseus compares the Achaeans to widows who, like Andromakhe, have lost a man whose role had been to guarantee the safety of their city, we must take the matter further and ask why Odysseus chooses such a wording. According to verse 290, the Achaeans áXXrjXotaiv ôôÒQOvxai oixóvôe véeaQai ("are lamenting with each other the return home"). First of all, oixóvSs vésaOai is not part of the comparison.66 In fact, it seems that widows belong more properly to a traditional war story, not to a return song.67 In the Odyssey , Penelope's despair is never solely caused by the possibility of her being a widow. Indeed, her sorrow has begun the day Odysseus left for Troy text as a kind of ultimate scene of the Trojan War told in a highly compressed way by Demo- dokos's first and third song - at least nobody would deny that Demodokos's third song is a kind of sequel to his first -, then the role of its "Hektor" is secondary (and so therefore is the role of his wife as a widow), and what is emphasized is the sorrowful fate that equates the captive with the much-enduring winner Odysseus. Cf., e.g., W.G. Thalmann, Conventions of Form and Thought in Early Greek Epic , Baltimore, 1984, p. 165 ("the grief of both victors and van- quished is finally the same"); H. Rohdich, "Ein Gleichnis der Odyssee ," A&amp;A 33 (1987), p. 42- 52 (here p. 46); and I.J.F. DE Jong, A Narratological Commentary on the Odyssey , Cambridge, 2001 ad VIII, 521-531 (the "negative perspective on the Trojan War is typical of all Greek veterans"). The conquerors' violence effaces the captive's words (a possible lament) as much as Odysseus's convulsive tears preclude any rejoicing over his heroic feats. The end of the war means a time of labor and pain for both the captive and Odysseus. 64 On the idea of such a plan in the Iliad and in other traditional epic songs, see, e.g., A. Thornton, Homer's Iliad : Its Composition and the Motif of Supplication, Göttingen, 1984, p. 46-63; cf. also Rousseau, I.e. (n. 3), p. 120-158. However, there is no way to prove that the mention of x^£ai in that passage is suffi- cient to trigger off these thematic associations for an archaic audience. Scodel, o.e. (n. 7), p. 1- 43 alerts us not to treat tradition and audience as unified and homogeneous blocks. 66 Cf. Ameis, Hentze and Cauer, o.e. (n. 37), ad II, 289: "Der Vergleich bezieht sich nur auf das óòògoviai, nicht auf den Inhalt derselben." There is no doubt that oixóvôe vésaOat is the object of óôóqovtoci; cf. P. Chantraine, Grammaire homérique, vol. 2: Syntaxe, Paris, 1953, p. 304. Nevertheless, the verb (áTco)vésaôai is repeated three more times by Odysseus in the interval of eleven verses (288-298), always having the Achaean army as its explicit or im- plicit agent (288, 291, 298). We may also add that, when the verb òôòçeaOai is constructed with an accusative or genitive complement, that complement is usually a person, and the verb refers to the pain inflicted upon the subject because he or she misses that person; cf. Odyssey I, 243, where Telemakhos says of himself that he weeps for his father (he does not say that he weeps for the return of Odysseus; see also Odyssey IV, 110 and XIX, 46). Besides Iliad II, 290, the exceptions are all in the Odyssey. XIII, 219 (the narrator says that Odysseus laments for his country); V, 153 (Odysseus is said to be weeping for his vócrcoç); and XIII, 379 (Athena says to Odysseus that Penelope gòv aíel vógtov óôuQO(xévr], "is always weeping for his return"). Even in this last example, there is a reference to a person through the pronoun gov. 67 The word never turns up in the Odyssey. On the vógtoç story, see A.B. Lord, The Singer of Tales, Cambridge, Mass., 1960, p. 97-98 and p. 121-122; and Foley, o.e. (n. 49), p. 145-168.</page><page sequence="16">16 Chr.

In IV, 681-740, when she addresses the herald Medon, she insists on Odysseus's glory and on the evil that has been caused by her suitors (681- 695), but she does not refer to herself as a woman who wants or needs to marry.68 Only after having heard bad news about Telemakhos does she lament the loss of her husband, but that event is solely or mainly mentioned to enhance her present suffer- ing, that is, the strong possibility of her son's death (727-740). In fact, she later claims to be crying more for Telemakhos than for her husband (814-823).69 As for the grief mentioned in Iliad II, 290, the verb ôôòçsaOat is never used for the tears of a widow in the Iliad.10 However, according to Andromakhe in her lament in Book XXIV, the Trojan soldiers òòòqovt ou along the city, because they were bereaved of their greatest warrior (737-40). This verb does not point to some kind of activity like revenge, but signals a passive response to death or grief.71 In fact, Andromakhe' s lament indicates full out that nothing will be able to save Troy. Although the verb ô8ÙQsa0ai is quite common in the Homeric poems, it is accompanied by a dative like &amp;Xkr''oioiv only once more. In Odyssey IV, 740-741, Penelope considers that Laertes should XaoTaiv ôôùqstou, oY [xsfxaaaiv öv xai 'Oôuaarjoç cpOTaai y óvov ávxiOéoio ("lament to the people, who are eager to destroy his and also almighty Odysseus's descendant").72 Supplication, a kind of performance to which belong tears and speech, is not an unusual Homeric context for the verb.73 In Iliad II, 290 and Odyssey IV, 740, the dative indicates the addressee of such a perfor- 68 The widow of someone as powerful as Odysseus would not have any difficulty in finding or choosing a new husband; on the contrary, in the patriarchal imaginary of the Odyssey , the remarried widow is represented as a wife completely indifferent to her first marriage (XV, 16-23). 69 This does not mean that Penelope's situation is not desperate, given that "her husband has vanished without a trace, and although she retains the ability to imagine and wish for his return and is eager to learn anything about him that she can, he shows no sign of coming back to her" (S.D. Olson, Blood and Iron : Stories and Storytelling in Homer's Odyssey , Leiden, 1995, p. 149). 70 But in the Odyssey it is very often used for Penelope; cf. the passages in Derderian, o.e. (n. 22), p. 22. Cf. Derderian, o.e. (n. 22), p. 17-24. On the disputed interpretation of XaoTatv... o Y [xe[xáaiv, some scholars argue that only part of the Xccoi support the suitors; see K. Ameis, C. Hentze and P. Cauer, Homers Odyssee für den Schulgebrauch erklärt , Leipzig, 192013, ad loc.; and W.B. Stanford, The Odyssey of Homer , 2 vol., London, 19652 ad loc. But see also S. West, "Books I-IV", in J.B. Hainsworth, A. Heubeck and S. West (eds.), Oxford, 1988, ad loc., who argues that o Y is "virtually unintelligible" and so favors others' conjectures or the poet's carelessness. Finally, according to Haubold, o.e. (n. 63), p. 112-114, this set of verses is one of the passages which point to the close affinity between the À,aoí and the suitors. 73 Cf. Iliad IX, 591; XXII, 79, and Odyssey VIII, 33. - Laertes's performance would be similar to Telemakhos' s in front of the Ithacan assembly in Odyssey Book II when tears follow his speech (40-83).</page><page sequence="17">WIVES, WIDOWS AND CHILDREN : WAR VICTIMS IN ILIAD BOOK II 1 7 mance. In Penelope's view, Laertes should "wail to or before " the people.74 There- fore, the Achaean soldiers' behavior alluded to by Odysseus may foreshadow, mutatis mutandis , some later passages in the Iliad where the Achaeans, especially Patroklos, will behave like Meleagro's wife asking her husband to defend their city (IX, 587- 596). I thus think that 7tocT8eç vsocqoì T£ y^oiixsq does not refer to what I have called "war victims." Odysseus wants to be more specific. The soldiers have been acting like the Iliadic Andromakhe. According to Odysseus, who obviously trusts in Agamemnon's dream, that is foolish behavior. According to the sequence of the poem (and its proem, I, 1-7), they have good reasons to do so. As long as Akhilleus (and his surrogate Patroklos) remains "dead," that is, without partaking in the battle, the Achaean camp, despite its future wall, is prone to be conquered, and the Achaeans, to die.75 Their behavior prefigures death and destruction no less than Andromakhe's lament in Book VI. It can also be added that verse 288 ("to return after having plundered well- fortified Troy"), which alludes to a return that should happen only after the destruction of Troy, indirectly helps to circumscribe the meaning of the next verse. If verse 288 is read as a thematic epitome of the Trojan War, verse 289 appears to be a maximal denial of that same story, conquerors-to-be acting like their supposed future victims, but at the same time this verse is the result of the Iliad story, in which the Achaean camp is turned into "Troy" (the city to be conquered) owing to Zeus' s - and the poet's - plan.76 Given my analysis of oko^oi xai vrjîiia tbxvoc, it can be postulated that in every "war against a city" story the terrible doom of the women and children of the city is stressed by the narrator, but the Iliad and the Odyssey do not authorize us to argue with the same strictness for the traditionality of a thematic triangle composed by a city, its main hero, and his wife (Troy-Hektor- Andromakhe) in the way it is built into the Iliad.

For verses similarly constructed, see Odyssey V, 202 (xoTç aça [jlòOcov r)@x£ Kocà,ui|kó) and Iliad XXIV, 723 (xfjaiv 8' Avógo^áx^ XeuxaAevoç rj0(e vóoio); on that use of the dative, see Chantraine, o.e. (n. 66), p. 69-70. 75 Akhilleus has already predicted that the army would feel TioOrj for him (I, 240). In fact, immediately after that "vage Prolepse" (cf. J. Latacz, R. Nünlist, M. Stoevesandt, Homers Ilias, Gesamtkommentar: Band I: Erster Gesang [A], München, 2000, ad loc.), Nestor men- tions the fiéya 7tév0oç ("great sorrow", 254) caused by the quarrel between Agamemnon and Akhilleus; tisvôoç is exactly what Hektor causes to his parents after his death (XXIV, 741). In Book II, when Thersites mentions the troubles Agamemnon brings to the Achaeans (233-234), he is possibly referring to the consequences of reassuming the combats without Akhilleus (but cf. Seibel, o.e. [n. 23], p. 214, n. 29). Agamemnon himself hints shortly after Odysseus' speech at the troubles that the quarrel may cause to the Achaeans, but his formulation sounds rather casual (375-380); cf. Latacz et al., o.e. (n. 13), ad II, 375-380. 76 Cf. Rousseau, I.e. (n. 3), p. 138-139.</page></plain_text>
