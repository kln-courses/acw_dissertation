<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Relations of Magic and Rellg'ion By E. I. BLACK, London School of Economics. ATTEMPTS to demarcate the spheres of the magical and the religious have sometimes been made upon the hypothesis that they are readily distinguishable, and possessed of mutually exclusive traits. Thus, it is not infrequently suggested that magic works for evil, where religious aims are good; that religion is social, where magic is individualist in tendency; or again, it may be hinted that the latter operates at a lower intellectual level, so to say, than the former. But there is a magic which is not only beneficent but definitely social in its character-as witness the Intichiuma ceremonies of the Australians,' destined to ensure an abundant supply of animal food; or the elaborate agricultural rites of the Malays.2 Again, whilst the available evidence goes to show that no people, however primitive, can certainly be said to be without the elements of some religious belief, it is yet a matter of common knowledge that magical ideas and practices have survived right on into our own times and civilization, and only a month or two ago, for instance, a poor Frenchwoman was induced to consent to the murder of her husband, because the sor- cerer whom she had consulted in regard to the death of some cattle declared that he had cast upon them the evil eye. It thus appears that, for one reason or another-lack of definition in some cases, perhaps, or failure to distinguish between origin and aim in others, total differentiation is not so easy as it might seem at first sight; but it may be well, before going further, to outline what is probably the best known of the so-called " oil and water" theories, as we find it put forward in the first volume of the Golden Bough. Sir James Frazer begins by defining religion as an attempt to conciliate and propitiate the superhuman powers which are believed to control nature; whilst magic, on the other hand, is an attempt to coerce them.- Where the former assumes a certain elasticity of nature the latter posits order and uniformity, with the result that it is weak on the speculative and theoretical side, and is, in fact, a false science, founded upon a misapplication of the fundamental laws of thought, working mainly through a mistaken association of ideas, and upon a basis of sympathy. Magic and religion are thus fundamen- tally antagonistic; they may combine, but can never fuse. Magic, 1 For examples see Spencer and Gillen, Native Tribes of Central Australia, ch. vi, p.

Now, quite apart from the non-confirmatory nature of available ethnological data, the intellectualist fallacy underlying such a view of the supposed transition is obvious; and yet it has found a new champion in Freud, who argues that just as the child or the neurotic believes that by a mere wish he can bring anything to pass, so the magician, similarly confusing what he wills with that which actually happens, thinks that he can control the course of nature: and just as with time the one is led by the necessity of adjusting himself to the hard and bewildering facts of life to abandon the belief in his own omnipotence, so primitive man, becoming conscious of the over- valuation of his psychic acts, constitutes those spirits to whom he turns in more or less submissive mood. In the magical stage the Allmacht der Gedanken is thus supreme; in the religious, which follows it, there is a partial cession in favour of the gods.' But An- drew Lang has suggested that Frazer's original statement might with equal relevancy be reversed, and that if we find a race which has magic but no religion we cannot be certain that it did not once possess a religion of which it has despaired2; and as Doutte and Wundt, it may be mentioned in passing, do in fact appear to think of religion as prior and of magic as derivative, little of positive value is to be gained by pursuing this particular line of thought. We shall see later, too, that the foundation of sympathy upon which Frazer has erected the edifice of magic is hardly wide enough to cover the known facts: and further, the idea of magic as a pseudo-science can be assailed, on the ground that it tends to minimize the personal and capricious element involved, and that the whole background of the mysterious in which it operates is alie'n to the scientific spirit. Durkheim, who sees in Totemism the most elementary form of religious life, where Frazer is inclined to assign to it a more or less magical character, essays a fairly complete differentiation along fresh lines; all known religious beliefs, he says, suppose a dual classi- fication into things sacred (that is, set apart and forbidden) and things profane, the former being superior in dignity and power to the latter. Religion, therefore, is a " unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, uniting into one single moral community called a Church, all those who adhere to them."3 There is, on the other hand, no church of magic, and no lasting bond between the magician and the individuals who consult him. But, it has been asked, whence does the "sacred" derive its special character? Further, does it not imply a category every whit as heterogeneous as that of the profane ? And, if this be granted, what then becomes of the supposed unity of the religious system ? 1 Freud, Totem and Taboo, ch. iii. 2 Lang, Magic and Religion, p. 47. 3 Formes eldmentaires de la vie religieuse, English translation by Swain, p. 47.</page><page sequence="3">II4 ICONOMICA The general trend of opinion has been, indeed, away from the idea that any hard and fast distinctions can be maintained; for psycholo- gical, sociological, and ethnological research have all gone to show the difficulty-nay, futility-of attempting to elucidate the matter by reference to historical sequence; and, more. importantly, a wide borderland, conveniently described as that of the magico-religious, has been recognized, within whose shadowv limits it is yet possible to discern the elements of what Professor Hobhouse calls the " materia magica " and the " materia divina,"l and even, perhaps, to separate them out, whilst yet remembering that they belong in some sense to the same department of human experience-" the x region of experience, the region of mental twilight," as Marett2 puts it. E. Sidney Hartland, for instance, in his Ritual cad Belief, recog- nizes no decided boundaries between magic and religion, claiming that they both owe their origin to society, both concern themselves with forces " mysterious, far-reaching, constraining men and things"; while both use similar instruments to achieve their respective ends. Always, however, some disparity of aim is hinted at; whence we must conclude that the magic,which most writers have had in mind when dealing with the subject is sorcery-Black Magic-which certainly can only be described as anti-social in its tendency. Tylor's now famous minimum definition of religion as a belief in spirits played a useful part when it was first framed in drawing atten- tion to the universality of what, on this view, could be accepted as religious beliefs, and to the low cultural level at which they are discernible. But belief in itself does not constitute religion; we have already noticed what stress is frequently laid upon the congre- gational and ritual elements involved as well as on the dual aspect of faith and works; and it is, moreover, at least doubtful whether the belief in spirits does actually constitute the religious primordium. The attempt to determine whether Animism should in fact be ac- cepted as the raw material from which more developed conceptions have evolved throws us back into those regions of primeval mystery of which we have already spoken. Now, Marett's description of religion as the facing of the Unknown, and of its function as the restoration of men's confidence when it is shaken by crises, has been attacked on the ground that it ignores the whole of life so far as concerns the normal course of events. The Californian Hupa wakes in the morning, sees the dawn, and greets it with a silent prayer: this is surely religion, says Hartland-and yet it cannot be maintained that the man who prays is at his wit's end, or that the ordinary and expected has been replaced by the extraordinary and unexpected.3 Yet, while this is, of course, true, 1 Morals in4 Evolution, p. 396. 2 Anthropology, p. 209. *3 Hartlancl, op. cit., p. 86.</page><page sequence="4">THE RELATIONS OF MAGIC AND RELIGION I I we venture to think that Marett is perhaps right in regard to the origi- nal attitude involved, and that the bringing of religion into relation -with everyday life is rather one which has marked successive stages of development. Iin one way or another, however, man would early realize that it were well that he should be on terms with the unknown world; and it is in his attempts to handle the situation that magic and religion have their origin. The methods of the former, with reference to which indeed it m-iay be defined, are marked, as we shall see, by the utilization of occult influences; and though its ends may be achieved without the intervention of spirits, where these are invoked they are regarded as subservient. Religion, on the other hand, implies a slightly different attitude towards the world, and what has been called " a progressive apprehension of the spiritual," distinguished by the fact that the spirit is no longer the servant but the master, something to be propitiated and conciliated; a change which can be conveniently illustrated by reference to the title of one of Dr. Marett's essays, " From Spell to Prayer."'l There can be no doubt that much magical procedure is the outcome of inaccurate observation, invalid inference, and imperfect ability to follow the links connecting cause and effect. Imagination, too, is vivid among simple folk; and there is a tendency to give free play to the dramatic instinct, and to objectivize wishes to such an extent that there is probably more than a shred of truth in the contention that the peculiarity of savage beliefs in general is due to the influence of desire and anxiety upon imagination unrestrained by self-criticism, supported by the happy accidents of fortunate coincidence, and backed by popular consensus. The mind of primitive man is, moreover, ill-furnished to resist suggestion, with the result that he is easily imposed upon, both by himself and others: he tends to con- fuse seeming with reality, substance with attribute, similarity with identity-and thus the main forms of magical practice can be accounted for, in part at least, on psychological grounds.2 Of the first, founded upon a mistaken view of the possibilities of similarity, good examples are furnished by the doctrine of signa- tures,3 certain fertilization rites, and the widely diffused practice of making images which are operated upon with the idea that the con- sequences of what is done to them will be felt by the original model. In the second case there is a tacit assumption that the continuous identity once connecting two things persists in spite of actual sever- ance, and that the possession of a drop of a man's blood, or some clippings of his hair, will suffice to give a sorcerer power over him. 1 Threshold of Religion, p. 29 et seq. 2 Upon the psychological aspects of the question, see Carveth Read, Origin of Man. 3 According to this doctrine, plants and other objects are " signed " in such a way as to indicate their use for certain purposes. Thus Dracunculus, a plant with markings somewhat resembling those on a viper's skin, was used in Pliny's time as a remedy for 5nake-bite.</page><page sequence="5">ii6 ECONOMICA But it is with the third form that we are more particularly concerned here-a form based upon the notion of power or force for which, as we have seen, Sir James Frazer fails to make adequate allowance when he claims to trace the source of all magical procedure to appli- cations, or rather misapplications, of the so-called laws of association and sympathy. We find, thus, that certain impersonal properties and qualities resident in such objects as precious stones, amulets, and talis- mans, are supposed to act directly, by way of emanation. The glowing stick will bum, moreover, and smallpox is infectious; whence by an easy generalization the Bechuana warrior is led to wear the hair of a hornless ox among his own hair, and the skin of a frog upon his mantle, in the belief that the slipperiness of the frog and the elusiveness of the ox will be transferred to him, and that such qualities will serve him well in the fight.' The sort of personal power associated with the objectivation of desire and the projection of will must also be recognized as very important; but what we should notice most particularly for the present is that in the notion of qualities and influences inherent in things, impersonal, transfer- able, and even quasi-material, we have a link with primitive religion. Marett, indeed, claims for such ideas a definite religious value in the eyes of those who entertain them, and proposes to substitute what he calls a " Tabu Mana " formula for that of Animism as a minimum definition of religion on the ground that Mana, " whilst fully adapted to express the immaterial-the unseen force at work behind the seen-yet, conformably with the incoherent state of rudimentary reflection, leaves in solution the distinction between personal and impersonal, and in particular does not allow any notion of a high individuality to be precipitated."2 The attitude involved is per- haps best illustrated by reference to such beliefs as those of the Melanesians who, finding a stone marked with little discs, or a block of coral, say that it is " good to bring in money," and attribute the character stamped upon it to the action of an associated spirit which must be conciliated.3 The more fluid conceptions of elementary force thus begin to crystallize. On the one hand, Mana is aln instru- ment spelling power of a somewhat mysterious and often dangerous kind, which men can wield; on the other, it is itself a spirit which not only has, but is, Mana, and as a spirit becomes an object of respect. Once we arrive in the spirit region, however, we have still to dis- tinguish between the cruder forms of belief in which there is a ten- dency to endow all natural objects with some sort of life, and those higher manifestations derived from a perception of the human soul as quasi-material, separable from the body in which it dwells, and even transferable. But we must guard against the supposition that 1 This example is given by Sir James Frazer, op. cit., Vol. I, p. I5I, as an illustration of what he calls " homoeopathic " magic. 2 Op. cit., p. i I9. Tabu he regards in this connection as " the negative mode of the supernatural." 3 Cf. Codrington, Melanesicans, p. I9I.</page><page sequence="6">THE RELATIONS OF MAGIC AND RELIGION 117 spirits at this early stage imply the " spiritual " in the sense in which we generally use the word to-day; for " essentially, the cult of Animism is not an adoration of a being higher than man, but a mode of influencing beings conceived as possessing powers which may be useful or harmful to the believer. . . . We are accustomed to think of the rudest religions as anthropomorphic, and to say that man first framed gods in his own image; but in truth, the majority of beings worshipped by primitive men are not human, but something less than human."' The animal-god and the man-god of this phase may, indeed, be the object of a cult; but the latter has been known to be a sorcerer, and the place of Great Spirits, of Supreme Beings, and of High Gods at such a low cultural level is still disputed. The sphere of the magico-religious is, in fact, as we have hinted, a wide one, whose limits are necessarily ill-defined. Totemism, for instance, which some would place on one side of the borderland, and some on the other, seems really to fall within it, as although the bond of union which holds together the Totemic group is certainly of a magical character, the totem itself may be conceived and wor- shipped as a spirit; and even with the gradual evolution of gods who are more than human, more than terrible, beings not only to be feared and conciliated, but to be reverenced, we find that magical practices and beliefs still appear interwoven with those to which we are accustomed to assign a more definitely religious character. The doctrine of magic among the ancient Egyptians formed an essential constituent of their religious faith, the gods themselves being well versed in its intricacies; and in Babylonia and Assyria especially incantation and prayer were barely differentiated, the efficacy of the latter being to a great extent dependent upon the utterance of correct formulae at the right time and in the right place. In proportion as a finer idealism emerges, however, there grows up a conception of religion as a relation to the Unknown in which man takes his place as subservient to great spiritual powers, or a great spiritual being, for whom he feels a mingled awe and reverence, and towards whom, in so far as he regards them as responsible for the gift of life and the blessings of each day, he will feel love and grati- tude. In such a system magic, sorcery, the utilization of occult influences for purely human ends, can clearly have no place. It seems certain, however, that any attempt to prove that magic and religion were originally fundamentally antagonistic, or that one was necessarily and historically prior to the other, must proceed with the greatest caution. For they both, as we have seen, belong to the same department of human experience, and both have evolved as a result of man's attempt to get " outside himself," so to say, and into touch with something dimly perceived perhaps, but beyond the reach of his immediate apprehension. Both involve an element of faith, conscious or unconscious; and both (though this is an aspect I Hobhouse, op. cit., p. 375.</page><page sequence="7">IIs8 IECONOMICA of the question on which we have been unable to dwell) furnish sanc- tions for social conduct. Professor Hobhouse has laid particular stress on the fact that there are two ways of treating things in the primitive World; the first, to act as if they were alive, or else inhabited by spirits; the second, to treat them as united by occult connections.' According as the one aspect is emphasized, or the other, we can watch the emergence of religious beliefs and practices, or of magical-but this they have in common: they provide an outlet for man's overcharged emotions, help him to gather the confidence which he sometimes sorely needs in face of the Unknown, and to find expression for hopes, for fears, for aspirations. And yet, while all this must be granted, and due allowance made for points of contact, it is obvious that as magic and religion have developed, or rather as with the growth of general culture the former has declined, the line of demarcation between them has become increasingly clear. As statements of tendency, therefore, we may accept most of the suggestions offered and criticized in the course of this paper; that the term magic covers bad ways of dealing with the Supernatural and religion good ways, for instance, that magic is coercitive where religion is conciliatory; that the former concerns itself primarily with the human will, and the latter with the divine; that where religion is social in its manifestation 'and aims, magic tends to be individualistic and anti-social. Buit the contrast is perhaps best emphasized by reference to the spiritual; for though the magician may, indeed, have intercourse with spirits, it is always in an attempt to control them by spells, by incantations and other non-spiritual means, and to utilize them for human ends; whereas the very essence of religion lies in the idea of service and communion within a spiritual order of which man feels himself to be a part, and by reference to which, as to something higher, better and infinitely nobler than himself, he,may range his aspirations and conduct his life.
