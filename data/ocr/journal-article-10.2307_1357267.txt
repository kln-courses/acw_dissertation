<plain_text><page sequence="1">Stone Sculpture in Chalcolithic Cyprus LUCIA VAGNETTI Instituto per gli Studi Micenei ed Egeo Anatolici Via Giano della Bella 18 00162 Rome, Italy Stone sculpture in prehistoric Cyprus has a long tradition that starts in the Aceramic Neolithic period. One can easily follow the development of the figurative tradition from Neolithic to Chalcolithic, when the use ofpicrolite, an attractive blue, soft stone native to southwestern Cyprus, becomes widespread and produces figurines of high craftmanship and style. There are also connections with the figurative tradition of neighboring areas, such as the Levant and Anatolia; similarities with Cycladic figurines are more superficial. This article reexamines the basic features of Chalcolithic stone sculpture in the light of recent finds from regular excavations. A general comparison of some features of stone and terracotta figurines is also attempted. INTRODUCTION nowledge of stone sculpture in Chalcolithic Cyprus has evolved rapidly in the last 15 years thanks to a number of factors. A large amount of new material has come from regular excavations, some of which have received detailed and prompt publication (Peltenburg 1977: 140-43; 1985: 279-83; 1988: 289-99; Peltenburg et al. 1988: 43-52; South 1985: 65-79). There have also been recent studies of material known for a long time but which previously had not received appropriate attention (Bolger 1988: 103- 32). Moreover, the detailed picture of the Chal- colithic period in Cyprus that is emerging from intensive field research, especially in the Ktima Lowlands and in the Vasilikos valley, is of great importance in placing the stone and terracotta sculptures of the period in their appropriate setting (Peltenburg 1977; 1979; 1982a; 1988; Peltenburg et al. 1983: 9-55; 1987: 1-18; Todd 1985; Swiny 1985; see also articles in this issue by Peltenburg and Todd). When in the early 1970s, at the suggestion of V. Karageorghis, I first approached the study of picrolite figurines, very few elements were known apart from the large group of figurines and pen- dants from Souskiou cemetery, preserved in the Cyprus Museum and in private collections. In fact, before studying and publishing in detail that impor- tant group, I felt it necessary to consider all the known material and to try to order it taxonomi- cally, establishing typological and stylistic groups (Vagnetti 1974: 23-33; 1975: 1-4; 1980: 17-72; Morris 1985: 122-32). However, the limited infor- mation about contexts and chronology-due to clandestine excavation-and the consequent diffi- culty in understanding the meaning of the objects beyond their appearance, have affected the entire study. The Symposium on Chalcolithic Cyprus pro- vided an opportunity to reconsider the whole prob- lem and to reevaluate the progress engendered by attempts to establish a wider view on the corpus of stone figures and figurines available today. In this article, I shall not discuss the function and meaning of the figurines, as those topics are treated else- where (e.g., Karageorghis, this issue, pp. 163-66). NEOLITHIC PERIOD Stone sculpture had a long tradition in prehis- toric Cyprus. From the appearance of the early inhabitants on the island in at least the sixth millen- nium B.C.-the Aceramic culture of Khirokitia type, which seems to be the earliest evidence of human occupation and activity-there is a high degree of ability in stone working. Artifacts include 139</page><page sequence="2">140 LUCIA VAGNETTI BASOR 282/283 both human and animal figurines and utilitarian objects, especially andesite bowls that occasionally were decorated in relief. Excavations in the main settlement of the period-- Khirokitia, in the southern part of the island-- have produced a number of figurines of varying degrees of complexity in workmanship, which Dikaios (1953: 296-301, pls. 95-97, 143, 144) di- vided into four main types. Recent research on the site has added a few more objects to the list of figurines and decorated bowls, but those have not substantially changed the picture (LeBrun 1984; Karageorghis 1985: 924, figs. 73, 74; 1988: 795-96). In other sites representing the same culture, such as Petra tou Limniti, figurines have been found in limited number. No figurines, however, come from the site of Cape Andreas on the very tip of the Carpass peninsula (Gjerstad 1934: 1-12, pl. 8; LeBrun 1981). The figural world of the Cypriots of the Aceramic Neolithic is rich and varied. A unique head of unbaked clay is highly naturalistic (Dikaios 1953: 299-300, pls. 98, 144:1063); in other examples the human figure is highly modified, varying from the schematized to the abstract. Among the most re- markable achievements are some heads in which very few facial features are indicated but which have a very powerful effect in expression (Dikaios 1953: 298, pls. 96, 144:1, 1068; Karageorghis 1989: 790, fig. 4a, b). In the case of a complete figure, even if the head and body are reduced to two differ- ent geometric masses, the figurine truly achieves a monumental appearance (Dikaios 1953: 297, pls. 95, 143:967). One cannot exclude the possibility that this figurine, which Dikaios considered un- finished, was originally intended by the sculptor to be completed as a bowl, although the thickness of the body would not allow a very substantial cavity. We do know of bowls with human shapes from Khirokitia and from Kholetria Ortos, a recently discovered Aceramic site in the Paphos region (Dikaios 1953: 298, pls. 98, 143: 929a, 1140; Fox 1988: 31, fig. 4:7). A human figure with upraised arms appears in relief on a bowl from the recent excavations at Khirokitia and the rich relief decora- tion of another bowl from the same site includes a cross composed of little bosses that could be inter- preted as a very abstract anthropomorphic represen- tation, especially in light of the great popularity of the cruciform figure in later iconography (Dikaios 1953: 248, pls. 56, 122:813 LeBrun 1989: fig. 11, 4;). The preferred stones of that period are andesite and a gray, sometimes greenish, diabase. Also in that period, an interest in colored stones began to emerge.' Occasionally the attractive green-blue picrolite, which became very important in the Chalcolithic period, was used with carnelian for necklace beads and small ornamental objects such as a little fish from Khirokitia (Dikaios 1953: 302- 4, fig. 107, pl. 68a:1485, 1486). In the following period-the Ceramic Neolithic- there was a substantial decrease in production of stone sculpture, apparently without a compensat- ing production of terracotta pieces. The main evi- dence comes from Sotira Teppes in the south and from Ayios Epiktetos Vrysi in the north. In both cases figurines are primarily highly stylized phallic representations (Dikaios 1961: 201-2, pl. 109:106; Peltenburg 1975: 28-30, pl. 5, lower; Karageorghis, Peltenburg, and Flourenzos 1990: no. 10). CHALCOLITHIC PERIOD In the Chalcolithic period, according to recent evidence, andesite and diabase, the two preferred stones of the Aceramic Neolithic, were still used, but picrolite became extremely prized for both small ornamental objects and figurines. Picrolite, also referred to in other studies as steatite or antigorite, is an attractive, green-blue, soft stone. It is native to the Troodos mountains and is easily found along some river beds coming down from the Troodos, especially along the Dhiarrizos and the Kouris (Xenophontos 1982; see also Xenophontos, this issue, pp. 127-38). Al- though picrolite was a local Cypriot resource, it was not available everywhere on the island. It has been argued that settlements such as Erimi or Souskiou, where this important stone was readily available, were in fact particularly wealthy in the Chalcolithic period (Peltenburg 1982c: 41-58; Bol- ger 1987: 69-81). Limestone and calcarenites were also often used, especially for the larger figurines. Those stones are more ubiquitous and were used primarily at sites where picrolite was not native (Peltenburg 1985: 281). Some early examples of picrolite figurines appear from the beginning of the Chalcolithic pe- riod, at Kissonerga-Mylouthkia (Peltenburg 1982b: 12-14), but they reached their highest popularity and artistic accomplishment in the second phase of the Chalcolithic, also called the Erimi period.</page><page sequence="3">1991 STONE SCULPTURE IN CHALCOLITHIC CYPRUS 141 *?? r " Fig. 1. Picrolite cruciform figurine from Yialia. Cyprus Museum 1934/111-2/2 (Photo Cyprus Museum). The most remarkable and numerous examples are still those found at Souskiou-Vathyrkakas, where they were used as tomb offerings (Vagnetti 1980; Christou 1989: 82-94; see also, Peltenburg this issue pp. 107-26 [Lemba]). The objects vary from free-standing figures of various types and sizes to tiny pendants used in necklaces that repro- duce exactly the form of the larger figures. On the other hand, the use of small pendants shaped like human figures is well known since the discovery of the famous Yialia figure, which is still the most impressive example of this group, beautifully carved of green homogeneous picrolite with a shin- ing surface (fig. 1). Its shape with tilted head, long ... .::' ?* : r ! . L.' i " , "?- Fig. 2. Picrolite cruciform pendant of the Kythrea variety from Kythrea.

A miniature figurine with the same characteristics is tied around the neck of the figure (Dikaios: 1934: 16, pl. 6:1).2 The size of the picrolite figurines rarely reaches 15 cm, but in most cases they are no higher than 5 to 6 cm. Within the general cruciform shape are several variations. In the so-called Kythrea variety- named after the site where the first example was found-there is a complete absence of detail carved in relief or incised, including facial features (fig. 2). The figurines have an oval head set obliquely on the neck, sometime perforated at the back. The</page><page sequence="4">142 LUCIA VAGNETTI BASOR 282/283 i ??.? ?? * I "" ?; ?: I Fig. 3.

The so-called Salamiou variety is characterized by the intersection of two figurines (fig. 3). The outstretched arms are replaced by a second figurine, usually identical to the vertical one, with the head and feet in place of the hands (Vagnetti 1974: 29, pl. 6:2; see also Karageorghis, Peltenburg, and Flourenzos 1990: no. 30). In shape and form the cruciform figurines range from stylized to abstract, displaying those charac- teristics in varying degrees (see Morris 1985: 116- 17). This variation from figure to figure can be seen also in the ways in which the facial features are rendered. They can be in relief or incised or, more rarely, as a combination of the two techniques. iif .:.:.. Fig. 4. Picrolite cruciform figurine from Souskiou Cyprus Museum 1981/V-4/10. = Karageorghis, Peltenburg, and Flourenzos 1990: no. 33. The Yialia figurine (above) is one of the best examples of the relief technique (fig. 1). The hair is represented in relief by two curves, one on either side of the forehead; the eyebrows make a continu- ous relief line with the nose, and the eyes are two small square bosses. The positioning and rendering of the facial features are remarkably similar to those of an unstratified head from Khirokitia which represents one of the examples of the development from Neolithic to Chalcolithic (Dikaios 1953: 298, pls. 96, 143:1404). On a figurine from Souskiou-Vathyrkakas the facial features are rendered partially in relief, but the deeply incised lines around the big almond eyes result in a stronger and quite effective contrast of light and shadow (fig. 4; Vagnetti 1980: pl. 1:2; see also Karageorghis, Peltenburg, and Flourenzos 1990: no. 33). On other figurines the facial features are rendered completely by incision.

A further incised line separates the hair from the forehead (Vagnetti 1980: pl. 4:10). A very similar disposition of lines, although with more detail, can be seen on a unique pendant from Souskiou-Vathyrkakas (fig. 5b). This strange object in a general way recalls a type of pendant very common at Erimi. Through the use of incised lines, however, it is transformed into an abstract human representation to be worn upside down (Vagnetti 1980: pl. 12:65). The same pattern of representation can be ob- served in a picrolite figurine from Souskiou-Vathyr- kakas, which does not belong to the cruciform type but can be described as squatting (fig. 5c; Vagnetti 1980: pl. 1:1). The facial features of this example, however, are much less accurate than those of the cruciform type, and perhaps could be considered a step toward the complete decomposition of their figural or representational value. The change may evolve eventually to examples with a few disor- ganized lines that are only reminiscent of the facial features (fig. 5d) or to others whose faces are en- tirely covered by lattice pattern (fig. 5e; Vagnetti 1980: pl. 3: 6, 7; see also Karageorghis, Peltenburg, and Flourenzos 1990: no. 36). This consideration does not imply a chronologi- cal sequence from naturalistic to abstract. Although one can be seen as related to another, the different manners of representation seem to have been in use at the same time. The cruciform figurines are the most characteris- tic among those of picrolite and are a striking artistic achievement of the Erimi culture. However, a picrolite figurine from Kissonerga-Mylouthkia, an early Chalcolithic site, does not conform to that scheme. Peltenburg (1982b: 12-14) suggests that it may indicate the evolution from Late Neolithic "cigar-shaped" figurines to the early steatite type at Mylouthkia and eventually to the characteristic cruciform type of Erimi (Peltenburg 1982b). Peltenburg's convincing hypothesis seems to be corroborated by another recent find from Sotira Akrolies (Swiny and Swiny 1983: 56-59; see also Karageorghis, Peltenburg, and Flourenzos 1990: no. 11). The limestone figurine clearly represents a seated figure in an almost completely abstract way. However, it has several views and in each view takes a different representational value, becoming a representation of both male and female sexual attributes (fig. 6a; Swiny and Swiny 1983: 56-69); Karageorghis, Peltenburg, and Flourenzos 1990: no. 11). In spite of its lack of context-it was a surface find-the two scholars suggested a date in the Chalcolithic period, stressing the similarity of the front view of the figurine with that of a normal cruciform figure without the arms. That date is now supported also by a second fragmentary figu- rine of the same type from Erimi, recently published (Bolger 1988: 103-22, fig. 34, pl. 18:342). Karageorghis has rightly stressed the analogy of the Sotira figurine with Levantine Neolithic exam- ples of the Yarmukian period. To the example from Sha'ar Ha-Golan (fig. 6b; Karageorghis 1986: 45-46) we now can add an example from Netir Hagedud (fig. 6c), whose analogy with the Cypriot examples is even more striking. Two small pro- tuberances indicating breasts give the figure an even stronger bisexual meaning (Noy 1986: 63-67, 324, fig. 1).3 Other examples typologically intermediate be- tween the Neolithic and the Chalcolithic types in- clude two fragmentary figures recently found on the surface at Erimi. One of the figurines, unfortu- nately missing its head and arms, is of andesite, a favored stone of the Neolithic period (fig. 7). Its general outline, with little emphasis on the hips and pubic area, is reminiscent of Neolithic and Early Chalcolithic "cigar shape." The clear indica- tion of breasts, however, seems a fully Chalcolithic characteristic (Vagnetti 1987: 19-21, pl. 5:1, 2; see also Karageorghis, Peltenburg, and Flourenzos 1990: no. 15). The second figure is probably of diabase (fig. 8). It has more of a fiddle-shaped outline, which was known already in the Neolithic and developed in the Chalcolithic period (Vagnetti 1987: 19-21, pl. 5:3-5; Karageorghis, Peltenburg, and Flouren- zos 1990: no. 14). A number of parallels exist among the figurines from Lemba. One of the figurines from the "hoard," or sanctuary, at Mos- philia also displays some common Chalcolithic characteristics such as the short stump arms and the wide hips with indication of the figurine's sex. The breasts are rendered in a different fashion (fig. 9; Peltenburg et al. 1988: pl. 5:3; Karageorghis, Peltenburg, and Flourenzos 1990: no. 29): on the figurine from Erimi they are simple pellets, but on the Mosphilia figure they are a bisected V in low relief. The bisected V is similar to the representa- tion on the famous Lemba Lady (fig. 10) and to the large limestone figure now in the collection of the</page><page sequence="7">1991 STONE SCULPTURE IN CHALCOLITHIC CYPRUS 145 ":, " ..:' ?. ,. . ,: -"':: ": :;:'':::':'''''' '';:: 1):. 4. . .. . :., 4 .44 C Fig. 6. a.

These two figures show that the cruciform scheme typical of the picrolite examples is also adopted for larger figures in other stones. The Lemba Lady, with her extremely long neck and very large hips, seems a synthesis of cruciform and squatting types, while the Malibu Lady is closer to the cruciform (see Peltenburg 1977; Getz-Preziosi 1984: 21-28). There are several iconographic and stylistic points of contact between the stone and the terra- cotta sculptures.

However, fea- tures common to the two groups can be seen in the recently discovered figurine from Kissonerga- Mosphilia, which represents a woman giving birth. Her very long neck with tilted head is close to the familiar cruciform type. The facial features in relief are reminiscent of those on the Yialia figure; the arms, though not long, are outstretched; even the painted dot decoration set obliquely on the arms recalls the incised lattice pattern found on some picrolite figurines, perhaps alluding to a shawl. The long breasts divided by a groove are not dissimilar from the bisected V breasts of the Lemba Lady (Peltenburg 1988; Peltenburg et al. 1988). It appears that the Cypriot artists of the Chalco- lithic period shared a common figurative and deco- UWoI. m c.. 2??: * 3/ . ..:? _c..o Fig. 8. Diabase figurine from Erimi.

We certainly do not know if the same craftsmen were able to work with various kinds and qualities of stone and terracotta, not to mention perishable materials such as wood. The techniques and equipment varied from one medium to another, and our ignorance of the arts and crafts production system in prehistoric times prevents us from speculating on this point. What seems certain however, is that the stone sculptor did not ignore the coroplast, and vice versa. There is also some faint indication that occasion- ally the two techniques may have been combined. In fact the Pelathousa head (fig. 12), a white lime- stone piece about 7 cm high, seems to be an isolated and complete piece (Vagnetti 1975: 2, pl. 1:12). One</page><page sequence="9">1991 STONE SCULPTURE IN CHALCOLITHIC CYPRUS 147 s7fi: I... * 1 7 Fig. 9. Calcarenite figurine from Kissonerga = Kara- georghis, Peltenburg, and Flourenzos 1990: no. 28. can surmise that it might have been completed with a body of terracotta or perhaps unbaked clay, as known from examples from Neolithic Thessaly (Wace and Thompson 1912: 41, fig. 25). The stone figurines of Chalcolithic Cyprus have several aspects that may be studied at a deeper level. One such aspect is the possible isolation of individual artists or workshops. Getz-Preziosi (1987) has developed a methodology for studying at a very sophisticated level the Cycladic marble sculpture. The corpus and quality of material from Cyprus probably do not allow a similar achieve- ment. However, a first attribution of three figurines to the same workshop, is still possible. The square head of a figurine in the Cyprus Museum (Karageorghis, Peltenburg, and Flouren- zos 1990: no. 31), with big round eyes, long nose :?,ii ,iii~; ~ d~ : . . ' . .. : .~o. Fig. 10. Limestone figurine from Lemba = Karageorghis, Peltenburg, and Flourenzos 1990: no. 12. extending down to the chin, and ears accurately shown in relief (fig. 13), is very similar to the head of a less precise figurine in the Menil collection (fig. 14), said to be from Souskiou (Karageorghis, Pel- tenburg, and Flourenzos 1990: no. 29). A third example, also from Souskiou, in the Severis collec- tion (fig. 15), is also very similar (Vagnetti 1980: pl. 2:3).4 Some cultural and geographical connections can be made regarding the provenience of the Cypriot figurines. The main areas to be examined are Ana- tolia, the Levant, and the Aegean. Two picrolite figurines of unknown provenience can be connected to Anatolia (Vagnetti 1979). The schematic outline of those pieces-stalk head slightly enlarged at the top, outstretched arms, and sack-shaped body- have parallels with figurines known at Beycesultan</page><page sequence="10">148 LUCIA VAGNETTI BASOR 282/283 gig :.

Among recent finds from Mos- philia are other variations of the same scheme (Pel- tenburg 1988: pl. 5:7 [Goring's gingerbread type]). The Levantine connections between the Sotira Akrolies figurine and examples of the Yarmukian culture (Karageorghis 1986: 45-46) have been dis- cussed (above). The most discussed area of com- parison is the Aegean: analogies with the Cycladic figurines have often attracted scholars' attention. The tilted up heads, long necks, the tendency toward schematization, and the limitation or ab- sence of carved details create an apparent kinship between the two productions that is also in tune with modern taste. But the analogy cannot with- stand deep analysis and does not seem to support any true connection between the Aegean and Cy- prus. The only striking iconographic similarity is the representation of two figurines, one on top of the other, known in the Cyclades and in a Cypriot example in a private collection in Holland (Vagnetti W.... AM' Fig. 12. Limestone head from Pelathousa. Before 1974 this was in the Hadjiprodromou Collection, Famagusta (Photo Cyprus Museum). 1974; 1980; Peltenburg 1977; Crouwel 1978: 35, pl. 4:11). Other regions of the Aegean, such as Crete, offer even less potential for comparison. There is one exceptional figure, from the site of Pigadhia on the island of Karpathos; it is now preserved in the British Museum (Pryce 1928: 6-7, fig. 2; Melas 1985: 147-48, fig. 62a, b). At a height of 65 cm, this figure is really a "statue" rather than a figurine. It is of soft limestone and the only facial feature on its triangular head is the large, protruding nose. The outline of the body is very schematic, with stump arms and rounded hips. The back is flat. In contrast with this very schematized representation, the sexual characteristics are exaggerated. Two round bosses represent the breasts, and a triangle in relief, with a vertical incision, indicates the female geni- talia. This emphasis is not so common in the Aegean, and in examining this piece one cannot ignore that the same emphasis is used on the Lemba</page><page sequence="11">1991 STONE SCULPTURE IN CHALCOLITHIC CYPRUS 149 'Ril ?7 .~* ...~t~;B~ ??'.! ............. rcm Fig. 13.

Lady, on which the triangular genitalia are repeated twice as a conventional way also to indicate the breasts. Also on the Lemba Lady, the arms are represented as stumps while other details, such as the head and the lower part of the body, are entirely different. However, the general outline of the Kar- pathos figure is not without parallels in Chalcolithic Cyprus, especially among the numerous figurines of the squatting type.5 Whatever the few occasional similarities with other areas may mean, the sculpture of Chalcolithic Cyprus has deep roots in the previous Neolithic tradition and remains an original achievement and an important invention. The ability of the Cypriot craftman, whose fantasy we know also from later periods, remains unrivaled in the eastern Mediter- ranean world in the fourth millennium B.C. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I offer my warmest thanks to V. Karageorghis for his unfailing support during this and other research on the archaeology of Cyprus, to E. J. Peltenburg for the infor- mation he has supplied over the years about the progress of his excavations, to K. Hamma who most kindly re- vised my text and read it during the Conference in which, to my great disappointment, I was unable to take part in person. My absence, of course, prevented me from listen- ing to colleagues' papers and to the following discussions, which would have certainly improved the quality of my final text. I also thank E. Macnamara for her invaluable assistance in the British Museum, where I was able to see the stone figure from Karpathos. I am also indebted to technicians of the Istituto per gli Studi Micenei ed Egeo- Anatolici for considerable help in preparing the slides (M. Petrarca) and for some of the drawings (A. Mancini).</page><page sequence="12">150 LUCIA VAGNETTI BASOR 282/283 NOTES 1For the characterization of stones see C.

'A stone slab with a very coarse, human-shaped out- line, placed under the dead in a tomb at Kissonerga- Mosphilia recalls the very simple outline of the Karpa- thos figure (see Karageorghis 1989: 821, fig. 103).
