Edmiston Hindsight and Insight contributes to our knowledge of the history and evolution of the novel by demonstrating that France's earliest novelists were already engaged in the kinds of narrative experimentation that are usually associated with modern writers.

McCormick McCormick challenges the previous critical studies of Vanbrugh that have concentrated on either his architectural or his playwriting career to the exclusion of the other. He reveals the role of Vanbrugh's life in his works, especially his experience as a hostage in France and examines the sources of Vanbrugh's building style, demonstrating the essential continuity of his dramatic and architectural practice, a continuity stemming from his use of a distinctive body of combat and siege imagery in both his dramatic and architectural vocabularies. 224 pages 23 illus. $29.95 Bernard Shaw's Book Reviews Originally Published in the "Pall Mall Gazette "from 1885 to 1888 Brian Tyson These hitherto uncollected book reviews of Shaw-his first journalistic efforts-reveal much about not only the writer but also the culture of the time in which he lived.

D. Allen Allen's study deals with Lawrence's lifelong interest in the medieval world, especially medieval literature, and its considerable influ- ence on his view of himself and of the Arabs with whom he fought in an archaic theater of war, and hence on his own literary production. 224 pages $28.50 Refiguring the Hero From Peasant to Noble in Lope de Vega and Calderon Dian Fox Refiguring the Hero reassesses the social signifi- cance of several of the most widely read plays of Spain's Golden Age in light of then-contempo- rary ideas about heroism. The book discusses European literary heroism through the seven- teenth century, with particular attention to the Spanish oral and written traditions. Fox challenges the "democratic" view of the peasant triumphing over the nobleman as heroic and shows that political and social developments since the seventeenth century have enhanced the sympathy with which modern readers regard the violent acts of the peasants in these plays. 256 pages $29.95 Penn State Studies in Romance Literatures 969</page><page sequence="6">Oxford '.-- Sexual Dissidence :-,: : Augustine to Wilde, Freud to Foucault JONATHAN DOLLIMORE, I '9l? g University of Sussex NA."^ ..

Forrest Houlette No two writers have the same approach to the writing process. That's why Professor Forrest Houlette has authored one software program that can provide any writer with just the right environment. Developed at Ball State University, Professor Houlette's award-winning "Write Environment" software organizes a wide range of writing applications under the Microsoft? WindowsT version 3.0 format (see figure at right). By linking these applica- tions in a way that supports the writer's thinking, "Write Environment" offers the writer maximum flexibility. First, it enables them to work on several tasks at once and in any order they choose. For instance, with just a click of the mouse they can view parallel presentations of notes and drafts, easily shifting information from one to the other. Second, writers are free to insert the software tools they prefer most into the program. "Write Environment" even roj understands how these : tools relate to each i other. At the appro- priate times, the pro- gram will provide the information needed to complete various tasks in the writing process. ' When it came to completing the task of authoring "Write Environ- ment:' Professor Houlette chose Zenith Data Systems desktops. The Z-386/20T PC helped reduce develop- ment time considerably, while a network of 25 Z-286 LP Plusr PCs pro- vided him with the ideal testing ground.

Hughes and Michael Lund The authors provide a new approach to the study of installment literature by showing how it embodied a view of life intrinsic to Victorian culture. Their findings, based on actual accounts of Victorian readers, show that Victorian interpretations were different from those of twentieth-century single- volume readings. These differences suggest that for the Victorians the publishing format became an essential factor in creating meaning and that effects of this publishing format have been neglected in the twentieth century. $42.50 THE DISCOURSE OF SELF IN VICTORIAN POETRY E. Warwick Slinn This book places Victorian poetry within the context of a radical shift over the last 150 years in the key European model for human definition and experience-from the metaphor of self to the metaphor of text. In this innovative approach the author examines the continuities from Hegel to Derrida to explain the force and challenge of poetry that disrupts the assumptions of idealist lyricism. $35.00 ii t i'lUll 1i1lE11~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ _ S _|_|_ __~* 3? 987 0 .t 0 0.- (A ttt .4 la ii.. .r ;d ,u 2 0Z .. 00 ~t a u C I c2.</page><page sequence="24">PAIL]MPSEW1T: EDITORIAL THEORY IN THE HUMANITIES A Conference at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor; Fri.-Sat., November 15-16, 1991 I.

Barry details the technobabble style, which is characterized by logorrhea, excessive use of the passive voice, anthropomorphism, vague and abstract language, euphemism, obfuscation, solecism, synecdoche, and mangled metaphors.

Scheduled for publication in Septem- ber, this new volume offers twelve previously unpublished essays that relate the teaching of writing to vari- ous aspects of postmodern thought, including feminism, neo-Marxist the- ories, the historiography of Michel Foucault, and cultural criticism. In particular, Contending with Words aims to transform the composition course from a "service" component of the curriculum to a locus of intel- lectual activity. Ten essays examine modes of discourse ranging from Socratic dialogue to the "false magic" of the National Enquirer, review the present disciplinary impulses of composition studies, and propose new directions for the teaching of writing. The two closing articles syn- thesize the arguments of the essays and respond critically to the collec- tion as a whole. Contributors Don H.

Since 1974, the Florence Howe Award has honored distinguished feminist literary criticism written by scholars in the fields of language and literature study. Now, for the first time, the seventeen winning essays-many never before pub- lished-are collected in one volume. These essays discuss topics such as resistance to the patriarchal order and the development of a feminist literary theory and explore the works of writers such as Margaret Atwood, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, George Eliot, Henry James, Herman Melville, Toni Morrison, Sylvia Plath, and Alexander Pope. Nine of the authors have written afterwords to comment on their essays or to describe the experiences they had while or after composing them. The volume includes an introduction out- lining the history of the award and a preface by Florence Howe, who is director and cofounder of the Femi- nist Press at the City University of New York and a former president of the Modern Language Association.

Jarvis Junior Faculty Development is designed to encourage mentoring and developmental programs for junior professors. It also serves as a self-help manual for junior and senior faculty members at a variety of institutions, from junior colleges to research universities, and as a guide for job seekers who want to evaluate an academic institution's developmental programs. Jarvis has studied existing junior-fac- ulty-development programs, inter- viewed over one hundred teachers, researchers, and administrators, and reviewed the fields of personnel and faculty development. This volume offers recommendations for incen- tives, evaluation techniques, and model programs that promote not only sound research and writing habits but also the art of good teach- ing and institutional citizenship. "The shortage of qualified college teachersJarvis anticipates will become a serious problem before long, and it is in the interest of the nation's univer- sities to take steps now to help younger faculty members realize their potential, thus ensuring the institu- tions' future."

Redefining American Literary History presents seventeen essays and six bibliographies linked, in the words of the introduction, by "a commit- ment to deal with history and attributes of literature in ways that have been slighted in the making of previous literary histories of the United States." The volume suggests methods for redefining the American literary canon and emphasizes African American, American Indian, Asian American, Chicano, Hispanic, and Puerto Rican literatures. Sev- eral essays discuss the oral dimen- sions in both "mainstream" and ethnic literatures, and other contri- butions present critical and historical perspectives on American litera- tures. Redefining American Literary History also contains information helpful for teachers establishing courses or for librarians building library collections. Two final sec- tions list journals and presses that publish works by and about the authors and literatures in the volume. "Essential for any collection in Ameri- can literature."

"Literacy is a right and not a privi- lege: a right that has been denied to an extraordinary number of citi- zens." Guided by this belief, the authors of the twenty-nine essays in The Right to Literacy discuss what lit- eracy is, what keeps people from attaining it, and how we can help them to achieve it. The essays in this volume were orig- inally presented at the 1988 Right to Literacy Conference in Ohio, an event that brought together a wide variety of literacy workers-school and college teachers, superinten- dents, principals, tutors, lawyers, community volunteers, researchers, librarians, labor union officials, prison literacy project coordinators, and state humanities council mem- bers. Their analyses are provoca- tive, scholarly, often witty, and-most of all-readable. Contributors Kenneth Alston David Bartholomae David Bleich Deanne Bogdan Deborah Brandt Miriam P.

This book celebrates "the arrival of a national literature on the interna- tional stage." As the editor, Arnold E. Davidson, writes, "Books by Canadian authors are being read out- side Canada in greater numbers than ever before.... Canadian studies (in its various aspects) is now taught in many countries, and many of those countries have their own academic associations to further Canadian studies." Intended primarily for nonspecialists, the twenty essays in the volume sug- gest the breadth of Canadian litera- ture and illustrate the range and variety of contemporary Canadian criticism. The first section contains eight essays on Canadian writing in English; the second, eight essays on Canadian writing in French. Each section begins with an overview essay on the historical development of the literature. In the third section, four comparative essays "cross and conjoin the linguistic divide." The volume concludes with annotated biblio- graphic guides to Quebec literature and English-Canadian literature, a list of contributors, and an index. Contributors Barry Cameron Arnold E. Davidson Barbara Godard Terry Goldie Karen Gould Mary Jean Green David M. Hayne Linda Hutcheon Patrick Imbert Lorna Irvine D. G. Jones W. J. Keith What Is English? Peter Elbow In 1987, sixty teachers of English from all levels of instruction traveled to Wye Plantation in Maryland for three weeks of lectures, discussions, reports, and demonstrations. What Is English? contains Peter Elbow's reflections on the English Coalition Conference and on its implications for the profession as a whole. Writing in a lively and acces- sible style, Elbow identifies and tackles the major issues addressed by the conference: * the question of what "English" means * the place of theory in teaching reading and writing * the conflict between those who teach lit- erature and those who teach writing * the controversies surrounding the canon * the nation's preoccupation with assess- ment Elbow concludes that the conference "was a gathering of excellent teach- ers. By excellent I don't mean better than anyone else-but rather teach- ers who are representative of what our profession produces when peo- ple are simply smart and they care and they work hard at it long enough to become professional." The book incorporates those repre- sentative voices by including reflec- tions, reports, and responses the participants wrote before, during, and after the conference. 1990.

Used for eight years in college writing labs, Editor enables both students and experienced writers to improve their composition styles. Unlike other editing software, Editor's text-analysis system emphasizes thoughtful revision, not quick fixes; Editor helps writers improve their research papers, as well as their everyday correspondence. 0 Users simply exit from their word processors and then run Editor from I DOS. (Users need only a basic familiarity with DOS commands-e.g., copying and renaming files, formatting disks, creating a subdirectory on a hard disk.) Writers who use Editor learn to avoid problems in their writing and gain a better understanding of stylistic principles. Among Editor's many convenient features: * Editor is menu-driven, fast, and easy to use. * Contextualized online reference help is available with a keystroke. * A 128-page manual offers samples of incorrect and proper usage and mechanics. * Usage dictionaries can be modified and expanded by the user. * Users can create and run additional usage dictionaries. 1006 0 _ 4 1fi S I~~~~~~~~~~clrr cmi~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Ix~ 11 - I</page><page sequence="43">MLA Founded in 1883, the Modern Language Association now numbers over 30,500 teachers and scholars of language and literature.

Jensen By Johannes Birringer "Here is a genuinely readable and enjoyable book... humane, balanced, unpolemical, good humored, and fundamentally sane." - Charles R. Forker Jensen questions a persistent critical emphasis that finds the meanings of Shakespeare's comedies in their endings.
