Fischer Verlag, 1970. xxv + 295 pp., tables, glossary, bibliography, index. n.p. (cloth). Reviewed by ARDEN R. KING Tulane University The persistence of the ideal goal of a total anthropology is one of the more fascinating phenomena of the academic and intellectual aspects of culture. Most loudly proclaimed in American anthropology it finds most fervent advocates there although it is not exclusive to them. It is the general American impression that those who elsewhere study man are more narrowly specialized and are either ignorant of the goal of holistic anthro- pology or they have considered it and aban- doned it as impossible of achievement. The latter more clearly distinguishes the European and American analysts of data. The cement that has held American anthro- pologists together has always been more aspiration than accomplishment: a statement of faith that a coordinate and dependent relationship between the biological and non- biological aspects of man could be demon- strated and that a synthesis could be achieved. This is due more to the lack of anthro- pologists qualified to attempt such an achievement than the absence of the desire for its realization. Few anthropologists have possessed both the mastery and the under- standing of pertinent data even to begin the approximation of their synthetic conceptual- ization. Even fewer possess the linguistic tools to ensure that relevant literature is within firsthand experience. It is therefore ironic that Earl W. Count, one of the few capable of bringing such a synthesis within range of the possible, has published three of his more significant essays in German. These clearly express the intent and the application of his concept, the bio- gram. As the configuration of the mor- phology of the nervous system and behavior, it brings the possibility of an anthropology within the grasp of the reader. A brief introduction synthesizing the direction of Count's work for the past twenty years needs translation into English. Throughout, one is struck by the extensive synthesis each article represents. For a reviewer to do each justice a full critique would be demanded rather than a review. "Eine biologische Entwicklungsgeschichte der menschlichen Sozialitait" (1958-59), is a fuller German version of "The Biological Basis of Human Sociality" (Count 1958), a work familiar to most American anthro- pologists. The subtitle, "A Trial Search for a Comparative Vertebrate Sociology with Special Reference to Man" (my translation), gives one an immediate insight into the purpose of the piece. Here Count propounds his hypotheses concerning the inter- dependency of biological and behavioral evolution and function. Count's familiarity with data from other disciplines allows him to specify evidence and relationships that enable us to more correctly gauge the inter- play of biological structure and evolution and behavior. It is therefore somewhat dis- tressing, given the date of the publications of the two articles, that a notable number of newly published books in anthropology either chose to ignore the synthesis of data presented by Count or cite data with a cause and effect orientation that no longer has currency. The second article, "The Lactation Com- plex" (1967a), is a direct translation from the English. Its subtitle, too, is worth citing: "A Phylogenetic Consideration of the Mammalian Mother/Offspring Symbiosis, with Special Reference to Man." In some ways this is the most significant of the three for it laid the basis for an original proposi- tion concerning the origin and nature of</page><page sequence="2">970 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [74,1972 ] incest (Count 1967b). This should be read in conjunction with "The Lactation Complex." Perhaps the most important proposition here is that lactation is the insertion of a transi- tory life mode between gestation and nutri- tional autonomy. This is not saying simply that there are suckling infants among mam- mals. Count has explored the reptilian origins of lactation and the development of parentalism as an ecology between child and parent. But Count has other reasons to emphasize parentalism rather than mother- child relationship, for among vertebrates one sex can take the other's role. Further, the fact there is no anatomical relevance be- tween the structure and functioning of the suctorial apparatus and the mammae leads to a very different view of the mother-child relationship, for lactation and sucking are activated synchronically but independently. In order to achieve synchronization there must be cooperation between the child and mother. Count proposes a dyadic evolution that must also be viewed from the stand- point of mammalian mother-child mutual- ism. This also refers to the ethological observation that no mammalian neonate ingests (sucks) unless it is first secure. That is, unless it can satisfy the fetally learned urge to a point of reference to replace the one lost. Then primary post-natal attach- ment takes place and the mother-child mutualism initiates the training and learning. But it also initiates the dismembership of this mutualism and the lactation process itself. Count's justification for these pro- posals demands reading. The implications for the understanding of behavioral evolution are extensive. The implications for anthro- pological values concerning the mother-child relationship and incest can only be sug- gested. "Myth as World View: A Biosocial Synthesis" (1960) in some ways is the least exciting of the three pieces. Here Count attempts to correlate the neuroanatomical and neurophysiological aspects of language (which he here and later terms "phasia") and the adumbration, perception, and com- munication of experience. The differential mastery of the two aspects of human data that Count displayed when this was written does not lead to a convincing demonstration of a biosocial synthesis. When written, "Myth as World View" reflected his long systematic concern with myth. Although his experience with the biology of man was more extensive it had not yet fully attained the broader synthetic orientation that came later. If this was written after Count's far- reaching investigation of the neurological origins and functioning of language, it would be more commensurate with its title (see especially Count 1968, 1969). But the formulations of the nature of myth by them- selves are stimulating. All of Count's writings have been increas- ingly concerned with the functional aspect of, if not the application of general systems theory to, biological evolution and biological process. Throughout there is an insistence on the clear delineation between programmed potential for behavior and programmed behavior. Count demands the recognition of the biological basis for behavior in the former. He implies the persistence of long traditions of learned behavior among the vertebrates in the latter, and proposes a series of synthetic steps in behavioral evolu- tion resulting from the interaction of the two. All of this is directed toward an under- standing of becoming human and being human. The biological and behavioral factors are not constant but instead are continuous- ly and coincidentally developmental. Unless one reads Count closely, he will come away with an impression that here is a more sophisticated version of the biological deter- mination of behavior. Count is fully versed in ethology and in the implications of the "insistence" that "instinctual" behavior exists in man by such ethologists as Lorenz and Eibl-Eibesfeld. Count stands beside them in synthesis of data, but he is not a researcher. Ethologists try to be humans looking at the animal's view of the world. Count attempts the human animal's view of existence. The implication of Count's work is that the cultural animal views the biological through our knowledge of biology not that of other animals. Such a stance is a way of avoiding anthropomorphism in ethology and the quasi-instinctual bases of human behav- ior proposed by such eminent thinkers as Levi-Strauss and Chomsky. This reviewer insistently recommends this volume and Count's other writings even if one has to sit with a neuroanatomy book directly at hand.</page><page sequence="3">PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY 971 References Cited Count, Earl W. 1958 The Biological Basis of Human Sociality.
