On the other hand, Hegel's Encyclopedia is closer in imagining a virtual university. In this period, encyclopedias form to medieval and Renaissance encyclopedias that try to assumed their current form as encyclopedic dictionaries or be organons of all knowledge, than is the "encyclopedistics" alphabetized encyclopedias. Though reduced to secondary of Schlegel or Novalis. For it has the form of a system, not the reference systems that store rather than synthesize knowl- least because Hegel wants to pose his claim for the centrality edge, such encyclopedias bear with them a conception of of philosophy against the assumptions of the new French and knowledge, namely as information or technology, which has Scottish encyclopedias. In his "Introduction" to the earliest continuing implications for Wissenschaft, science, and the version of his encyclopedia, the one-volume Encyclopedia of the consequent separation of sciences as modes of knowledge Philosophical Sciences in Outline (1816), Hegel therefore criti from arts. In the Romantic period, however, Friedrich Schle- cizes "assemblages. . . of information" and the inclusion of gel criticized this "encyclopedia of the French," suggesting "pseudosciences" such as heraldry— the technologies (in a Idealism as a better basis for the unity (or otherwise) of Heideggerian sense) covered by Diderot and other post-Ba knowledge (Behler 284). I will here consider the Idealist en- conian encyclopaedists (53). His encyclopedia is to comprise cyclopedia: not the "literary" version of the Schlegels, but the the philosophical, not the empirical and practical sciences, more systematic, if related, philosophic encyclopedia. The Even as it expands philosophy into non-philosophy, thus ex Idealist encyclopedia can be considered a subset of a broader ploring the margins of philosophy, it will include sciences "Romantic" encyclopedia.

Idealist version as a subset of a Romantic project, is thus not a compilation of all knowledge, but an encyclopedic thinking To be sure, Hegel's Encyclopedia has a sweep that makes which discovers that thought cannot be exhausted in a single it Idealist rather than just Romantic. Yet Idealism is an "idea" discipline or form of thought. This thinking is "organicist:" it in Kant's sense ( Critique 218-29, 373-87), a desire for totality, sees different areas of knowledge as organically intercon- identity and absolute knowledge that develop as a project nected, with the caveat that organisms are infinitely complex, within a Romanticism that unravels these goals.

Hegel's notion of Fichte, he makes education a way of thinking, not "a content knowledge as infinite emerges within his critique of positiv of positive knowledge" (Readings 67). Schlegel similarly dis- ism, a term he uses well before Auguste Comte. Positivism is</page><page sequence="2">not just a securing of knowledge as what can be positively a multi-component system that contains all his more detailed known, but involves an autonomization of fields: positive sei- subsystems. Yet the archaeological shifts he introduces make ences such as natural history "do not recognize their con- system in the sense defined by Coleridge impossible, in ways cepts as finite" and thus allow claims of individual disciplines that Hegel himself never quite confronts, but that Schelling to be self-contained (Encyclopedia 54).

Culminating in "or ble to the same law" (2:1109), and Hegel finds this law in ganics," Schelling's work was to offer a system of nature as philosophy.

Abandoning the real</page><page sequence="5">WORKS CITED series of disciplines after 1805, he proceeds in the Freedom essay to what he calls the "ideal portion" of his system (218). He continues the project of a transcendental idealism, ex cept that the very meaning of "transcendental" has changed. To be sure, Schelling still wants to integrate nature and spirit. But nature is now spirit in the sense that spirit is nature. "God is a life, not merely a being, and is subject to suffering and becoming" (274). In Ages of the World Schelling further continues the ideal portion of philosophy by approaching spirit through its history, and yet this history is profoundly transcendental in being its own psychoanalysis rather than a production of events or contents. Curiously, Schelling had earlier approached nature as having no history, while Hegel focused on the history of nature. But now in writing the his tory of spirit as human nature, Schelling returns to the natu ral sciences, and as his title suggests, to geology as a way of thinking ontology within a return and retreat of the origin (Rajan, "Spirit's Psychoanalysis" 193-94). In effect Schelling now releases the work on the life sciences that had been a source of blockage in his early sys tem, into a larger fluidity, and explores its implications for history, ethics, and spirit. Picking up a key figure from the Freedom essay, Schelling in "The Nature of Philosophy as Sci ence" also uses the body to theorize the relation between parts of knowledge, thus rethinking the very nature of the idealist system according to the encyclopedic of Romanti cism. In the earlier essay he had discussed the part-whole re lationship in the body in terms of freedom: "The individual member, such as the eye, is possible only in the whole of an organism" but "it has a life for itself, indeed a kind of free dom, the obvious proof of which is disease" (228). In "The Nature of Philosophy as Science" he extends the figure to knowledge so as to make asystasy— or "inner conflict"— the condition of possibility for system conceived as a form of "co existence" (213), a darker form of the diplomat Leibniz' "consilience." As the body is a system made up of subsystems —nervous, digestive etc. , so the body of knowledge harbors parts that depart from the whole. "Healthy individu als do not feel" these parts, which "live only in the whole" (213). But health itself as systemization is at odds with free dom. Arguing that Kant's use of mathematics as a paradigm for knowledge favors a crystal over the human body because it never falls ill (212-13), Schelling instead sees the system as an organism. Though an organism has different parts, it is one subject who inhabits them, and one subject who "pro ceeds" through art, law and physiology (215). But this does not mean that these subjects yield a unified subject. If the subjects of thought are different, the subject too is differ ence: the circle of learning, then, is the constant deferral and troping of one area of knowledge by others. NOTES •The notion, which is implicit in Hegel's and Schelling's analyses of the part-whole relationship in illness, is elaborated by Coleridge (11.1027), Abernethy (101-02, 269) and J.H.Green (82).
