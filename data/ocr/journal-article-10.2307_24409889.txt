<plain_text><page sequence="1">Renaissance Studies Vol. 3 No. 1 Calvin on signs: an Augustinian dilemma G. R. Evans Should one choose to go to Holy Communion or to hear a sermon if only one is possible? asks Origen.1 This was a real dilemma in the later medieval West. But the practice of separating Mass and ministry of the Word in preaching did not go uncriticized. In the fifteenth century we hear pleas that hearing, reading and meditation upon Scripture should accompany the reception of the eucharist, the two together giving com fort to those who are weary 'in via dei'.2 It seemed to Calvin that the separation of the sacraments and the preaching of the Gospel encouraged Christians to place an emphasis upon the outward and visible signs of the sacraments, on images and relics, rather than on reading and learning from the Word. He suggests, for example, that confirmation has been 'substituted' for catechism.3 The debate rests on a double medieval heritage: a broad and compre hensive understanding of 'sacramentum'; and Augustinian sign-theory. In the twelfth century Hugh of St Victor includes among 'sacraments' not necessary for salvation but helpful to spiritual growth, a number of 'things' (water sprinkled, candles blessed), 'deeds' (making the sign of the Cross, bending the knees in prayer), 'words' (invocation of the Trinity). He explains how each of these works. Sprinkling water is done after the example of the prophet Elijah who put salt into water to make the bitter springs sweet. The water, says Hugh, signifies penitence for past acts, the salt discretion and caution in future deeds; if these two are mixed together the bitterness of the repentant conscience is turned into sweetness. When we bless palm branches on Palm Sunday we do in a bodily way what was done in a bodily way on the first Palm Sunday, and at the same time our actions help us to imitate what was then done spiritually. The waving palm branches signify good works. When we meet Christ in praise with palm branches in our hands, we praise him with good works. Words can work sacramentally in the same way. To sing 'Alleluia' is happiness. Hugh's inclusion of such additional signifying things among the 'sacraments' in no way implies that they are sacramental in the 1 Origen, Horn, in Exod., XIII, pg 12.391 A-B. 2 On the debate of Geiler's day, see J.

He emphasizes the steady diminu tion of the sanctifying power of the line of signifying 'things' down to such 'things' as the adornments of churches, which bring no holiness.4 In his Sentences, which became the standard theological textbook throughout the Middle Ages, Hugh's younger contemporary Peter Lom bard gives an account of 'sacramentum', which we may take as a basis for subsequent medieval discussion. A sacrament is a sign of a holy thing,5 he begins, citing Augustine.6 It is itself a 'thing', and yet it brings to the mind something other than itself. For this to occur there must be a similitudo between the 'sacramentum' and that of which it is a sign. It must be a likeness of a special kind, an 'invisible form of grace' ('invisibilis gratiae forma'), which has the effect of producing this image. Such a sign not only signifies; it also sanctifies. Old Testament 'sacramenta' promise salvation; those of the New Testament actually confer salvation. Again, we have gradation of the power of signifying possessed by different things, and a clear distinction of sacraments proper from other 'sacramenta', within a general grouping of created things which signify spiritual realities. The same explanation of the broader and narrower senses of the word 'sacramentum' was still needed in the sixteenth century. Gropper, with a nod to contemporary classical scholarship, includes a reference to the usage of the 'ethnici' out of respect for the full 'proprietas' of the Latin word. Biblical usage, he explains, confines 'sacramentum' to what the Greeks call 'mysterium', as do the Fathers. This signification is sometimes taken more broadly, sometimes more narrowly. It can mean any holy mystery (e.g. 1 Timothy 3.16), but more commonly it is said to be the sign of a holy thing, which bears its likeness, and in this way it covers both the signs and figures of the Old Testament and the special sacraments of the New Testament.7 Calvin's emphasis upon the two sacraments instituted by Christ, bap tism and the eucharist, is, like that of other reformers, in some measure an attempt to clarify by insisting upon differences. But it is necessary only because of the established habit of linking images and relics and all sorts of 'significant things' with the outward and visible signs of the sacraments as means of instruction used by God to teach his people about spiritual realities. The theory of signification which underlies this habit of thought is Augustine's. When Calvin refers to the sacraments as visible 'words', he is assuming with Augustine that words and things are both capable of signification. The later medieval schoolmen had pursued Augustine's theory to a high level of sophistication epistemologically, and also in its Hugh of St. Victor, De sacramentis, PL 176—n.ix. 1 -10.

References to the duality of words and things as signs are com monplace in many contexts in the late fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. One late medieval commentator suggests that the difference between nominalism and realism lay in the concern of one with the properties of terms ('words'), and of the other with the nature of 'things'.9 Conrad Neobardius, writing a handbook of dialectic, divided the disserendi ratio into two branches, the interpretation of words and the comprehension of things.10 Erasmus begins his De ratione studii of 1511, which was to be a Christian Quintilian, an educational manual, from the starting-point of Augustine's introduction to the De doctrina Christiana. Knowledge, he says, is of two sorts: that which is concerned with things and that which is concerned with words. Knowledge of things is obtained only by speaking about them in words, so a person who is not skilled in language will be short-sighted, deluded and unsound in his knowledge of things.11 Luther, writing on Deuteronomy, seeks to distinguish between words and things in the Bible's history books. 'These are truly called sacred histories not because those things were done by holy men, but because they were ac complished according to the holy Word of God, which hallows everything; . . . the proud and carnal are deceived by the simplicity of things in the Scriptures, for they take no notice of the Word of God and value only the things.'12 In the Acta of the Council of Trent we find among the articles on justification on 1546 an attempt to explain what justification is quoad nomen and quoad rem,13 Calvin asks whether we are talking about a word or a thing when he discusses justification by faith.14 As late as 1657 Brian Walton, in his edition of the apparatus to the Polyglot Bible, preserves the division, and has separate classes of ap paratus to the words of Scripture and to the 'things' in the Bible.15 8 See M.

R. Evans These examples, and a host like them, reflect something of the variety and complexity of the issues which the Augustinian notion had raised.16 They represent two broad schools of thought: that words are a higher and more direct means for God to teach us about himself than things; and the reverse: that things teach directly and words only indirectly, because they must first point to things. Augustine himself sees both as having been divinely instituted for our instruction, so that the signifying word or thing does more than point to what it signifies. It conveys us towards God himself. Two centuries after Augustine, Gregory the Great was applying the notion to the exegesis of Scripture and to questions concerning the right use of relics and images. He explains that the Holy Spirit has used pictures and analogies in the text of Scripture and in the world as a means of lifting human understanding beyond what can be perceived by the senses, to spiritual truths. Similarly, the outward and visible signs of the sacraments, the relics of the saints, and pictures and statues in churches, can be seen to point beyond themselves to the divine. These were not new ideas; they can be found in the Greek Fathers." But Augustine and Gregory were the principal agents by which this view of the divinely directed power of material things to signify spiritual realities became a commonplace in the medieval world, embracing a wide range of different kinds of signs in a single epistemology. This way of thinking affected the developing sacramental theology of the Middle Ages and the penitential system as well as medieval scholarly work on logic and language, because it made the relationship of significa tion seem to many to be more than a mere 'standing-for'. Images and signs of the divine were not simple labels; they were seen as holding the mind and heart of man in a complex relationship of mutual authentica tion and realization with the truths to which they pointed the believer, and as instruments used by God to bring the believer to himself. Calvin explains that the sacraments were instituted by God to help us in our need. We are not, he explains, to cleave to the visible signs, thinking we shall get salvation from these, or imagine that they themselves have a power of conferring grace. The sign is simply a help; it points us directly to Christ.18 Such signs enable our weak understanding to grasp something of the mystery they signify.19 But they do more than assist us intellectually. When Christ instituted the Last Supper he meant it, says Calvin, as a seal as well as a sign, that is a 'means' of giving us assurance of our salvation, a 'prompter' to praise and thanksgiving, an 'exhortation' to union and brotherly love.20 This is a sign with an effect. It is a witness to the effects 16 On the sources of Augustine's ideas here, see M. Colish, The Mirror of Language. 17 See my The Thought of Gregory the Great (Cambridge, 1986), part II, and The Logic and Language of the Bible: The Earlier Middle Ages (Cambridge, 1984), 1-4. 18 Catechism of the Church of Geneva, 84-5. 19 A Short Treatise on the Supper of our Lord (1540), para. 5, pp. 166-7. 20 Ibid. para. 6, p. 167.</page><page sequence="5">Calvin on signs 39 of Christ's Passion and it brings about in us confidence and holiness of life.21 The sacraments are not only ladders for our understanding to climb, but ladders by which we ourselves may scale upwards to heaven.22 In speaking in these terms Calvin is, as we shall see, treading a fine line in a minefield of medieval and contemporary debate. We need to look both at 'signification' and at 'analogy' to get a picture of his difficulties. He is striving in these comments to find the right point of balance bet ween thinking of these things which are signs as mere pointers, and recognizing that, as things in themselves, they are powerful realities. While a word is a mere noise if it has no signification,23 a thing exists in its own right and may simply be itself, as well as having the capacity to signify something beyond itself. As Augustine points out in his homilies on John,24 Jesus' deeds recorded in the Gospels are both deeds and signs. The daughter of the ruler of the Synagogue was really raised to life, but she also signifies latent sin. The widow's son was really raised, but he stands for sin actually committed. Lazarus was really raised, but he is also a sign of habitual sin. Christ showed by raising all three that he is able to free us from the consequences of our tendency to sin, our actual sins and even our entrenched habits of sin. It is because of this self-evidently real being of their own that things sometimes prove attractive in themselves. Though Luther seems to have thought that images could be useful as visual aids, he expresses an anxiety that the vividness of things in themselves may be so compelling for the simple that they forget to think of them as signs and do not look beyond them as they should.25 A par ticularly crude example of the way this could happen is described in a let ter of John Hoket, minister in Maidstone, Kent, to Bulling (c. May 1538). Hoket has seen a figure of Christ which is made to operate like a puppet by wires inside it, so that the statue can 'nod with his head . . . scowl with his eyes . . . wag his beard . . . curve his body' and so seems 'to reject and to receive the prayers of pilgrims'.26 Calvin saw an acute danger in such compelling images. He insists in the Institutes of 1536 that a God who is Spirit must be worshipped in spirit, that even if the Christian is aware of the danger, and tries to see beyond the image to God himself, the cult of images is bound to distract him, that for the simple who cannot guard themselves effectively against this danger the image is bound to convey a 21 Ibid. para. 9, p. 168. 22 Mutual Consent of the Churches of Zurich and Geneva: Exposition of the Heads of Agreement, 229. 23 Aristotle, De interpretatione, II. 162 24 Augustine, Horn, infohn, xi.2-3. 25 See H. von Campenhausen, 'Die Bilderfrage in der Reformation', Zeitschrift K G., 68 (1957), 96-128, and D.

Evans false notion of God.27 To pray to creatures is sacrilege, for our prayers are the chief sacrifice by which we do homage to God (Psalm 50). He gives ex tensive coverage to the second commandment and its fierce sanction in his commentary on Moses.28 He argues that the world has ceased to seek Christ in Word and sacrament and learned to entertain itself with his clothes.29 He thinks that in practice it is not possible to distinguish bet ween regarding relics as precious things and according them adoration for themselves.30 And to serve the creature and not God is to serve a lie and not the truth.31 There is, he suggests no difference between the idolatry which distracts the mind from God and the idolatry which pretends to direct the mind to God.32 It would seem that the 'lifting mechanism' Augustine and Gregory saw in holy things is for Calvin a sometimes dangerous machine. There remains a paradox in the position Calvin takes up in these passages. On the one hand, he is insistent that a sign is nothing but itself; we must never forget that and let our minds dwell on it reverently as though it were itself holy. (It is not lawful to affix Christ in our imagina tion to the bread and wine, or to worship him in the bread.)33 On the other hand, he emphasizes our need of signs as vehicles to carry our minds to see things we could not otherwise perceive. (While the Holy Spirit moves the heart and enlightens the mind directly, the sacraments, as secondary instruments, are used by God because our weakness needs them as mirrors in which we may see heavenly things in a familiar and earthly way, for we could not otherwise reach them in our understanding. )34 The distinction between holiness brought to earthly things by God himself for our benefit and therefore actually present in them, and a holiness 'really' in heaven but seen 'through' earthly things would seem to suppose a spatial separation between the created and divine, the world and the spirit. Calvin does in fact seem to take something of a physicist's view of heaven, as did Ridley in his arguments against transubstantiation. Both argue that the body of Christ now ascended is his natural body, that it is finite and is physically and spatially present in heaven, and is as dis tant from us in point of space as heaven is from earth. The signs are pre sent in this world, seen by our eyes and touched by our hands.35 Calvin's fear is that if this spatial separation of sign and thing signified is not em phasized there will be idolatry. When God forbade the worship of idols (Exodus 20.4-6) he forbade all actions and thoughts which stop at the 27 O.S.

To kneel or un cover the head before an image is to worship it, because it makes the object of reverance the thing here and not God in heaven.36 There is no difference in Calvin's mind between the idolatry which takes worship away from God by fixing the mind on the sign and that which pretends to direct the mind to God but does so by misuse of signs.37 But as he himself was well aware, the problem of the signifying power of things has to be taken into account in our understanding of the sacraments. Throughout the Middle Ages, the relation between the things which are signs of God and the words which speak of him by speak ing of those things, had been seen as involving a transference of significa tion.38 The word signifies the thing (a stock example is 'lion'), and when Christ is called 'the Lion of Judah', the 'thing', the lion in his majesty among the animals, stands for Christ.39 Thus, by translatio, or metaphorically, 'lion' signifies Christ. Calvin sees this occuring in the eucharist: 'the bread and wine receive the name of that which they signify'. That is to say, when the bread is called Christ's body, the words 'Christ's body' signify the bread directly and the actual body of Christ metaphorically. He points out that it is nothing new to transfer the name of the thing in this way; similar modes of expression occur throughout Scripture, and when he says that this is so he himself is asserting nothing but what is found in the most ancient and approved writers of the church.40 He was certainly saying nothing which his contemporaries would find unfamiliar. Gropper, for example, writing on 'baptism', ex plains that it is a Greek word signifying 'washing', and that it is transferred ('transfertur') to the death of Christ in the special usage of Scripture. 'Are you able to be baptised with the baptism with which I am baptised?' (Mark 10.38).41 This widely accepted and ultimately Augustinian account of the opera tion of figurative language in Scripture leaves unresolved the deeper ques tion whether the force of this transference of signification is more than verbal, whether there is any sense in which the thing itself may be said to be transmuted into the thing whose name it is given, the 'translatio' to become a 'transubstantiatio'. Although this question comes into sharpest focus in connection with the eucharist, it underlies all talk of images, relics and sacraments in the medieval tradition to which Calvin was heir. It is not simply a matter of whether a word signifies a thing merely by labelling it, by imposition or usage; or whether it has a real and perhaps effectual connection with the thing it signifies. There is also the issue of analogy. There was a strong patristic and medieval tradition of thinking On Shunning the Unlawful Rites of the Ungodly, Tracts and Treatises, 368-79. Ibid. 392.

Evans which argued that when a created thing signifies a divine reality, that is possible only because there is a real, perceived and enduring similarity between them. This link is put there by the Creator in order to help his creatures come to him in ways which lie within their capacity. He uses it to work not only upon their understanding but upon their very being. Peter Lombard explains the principle in the twelfth century Sentences which draw together patristic and earlier medieval thinking in a powerful synthesis. 'A sacrament', he says, 'is a sign of a holy thing' in which there must be a 'similitudo' between sign and thing signified. This 'similitudo' is able to generate an image or idea of the reality it signifies in the mind of the believer, and by so doing it not only signifies but also sanctifies. The signs of the Old Testament can do no more than promise; but the sacra ments of the New Covenant actually effect salvation.42 An opposing school of thought, also current from patristic times, held that no creature can give us any idea of the reality of God, that there can be no sort of 'similitudo' here. Calvin was, in other words, consciously taking a position on a long-contended issue, and he is in line with Aquinas and Cajetan in accepting the use of analogy with caution and taking the view that it is better to err on the side of denying the possibility of similarity than to fall into an anthropomorphism which brings God down to our level.43 Calvin gives the example of baptism. Baptism consists of two parts, forgiveness of sins and spiritual regeneration. Water represents these things. It washes, and forgiveness is like washing because by it our souls are cleansed from their defilements. We enter the water as though we were drowning, but only for a moment; we emerge at once, and that is like regeneration. This likeness is certainly put there by God. He has ordained the symbol of water to 'figure' to us that he washes and purifies our souls as water cleanses bodily defilements, Calvin explains.44 Similarly, bread represents the Lord's body and wine his blood to teach us that just as bread and wine nourish our bodies, the body of Christ and his blood nourish our souls spiritually.45 These sacraments figure spiritual grace by visible signs, seal God's promises in our hearts and in this way confirm their truth for us.46 We still have to bring together the transference of signification which takes place when the divine is spoken of in creaturely terms, and the rela tionship between things implied by this 'similitudo'. Can words make one thing into another if the user so intends and God gives effect to his inten tion by making it a reality? We have seen that the concept of 'the force of words' ('vis' or 'virtus sermonis') is a commonplace in the discussion of J: Peter Lombard, Sentences, iv, Dist. I, 2-4. 4Î See J. M. Ramfrez, 'De analogia secundum doctrinam Aristotelico-Thomistican', La Cienzie tomista, 24 (1921), 20-40; 25 (1922), 17-38. 44 Catechism of the Church of Geneva, 86; Form of Administering the Sacraments, Baptism, p. 114. 45 Catechism of the Church of Geneva, 89. 46 Ibid. 58.</page><page sequence="9">Calvin on signs 43 signification from at least the fourteenth century. One of William of Ockham's Quodlibetal Questions concerns the words 'hoc est corpus meum' as they are said by the celebrant in the Mass. There was evidently some contemporary debate as to whether this statement is true 'de virtute sermonis'. When the celebrant utters the word 'hoc' he cannot yet be speaking of the body of Christ because he has not spoken the words 'est corpus meum' which transform the bread. But if the 'hoc' refers simply to the bread, the rest of the sentence does not make sense. Either way, the proposition would appear to be false.47 Ockham resolves the matter by ex plaining that the significance of a demonstrative pronoun depends on the intention of the user ('intentio proferentis'). Furthermore, every proposi tion uttered corresponds to a mental proposition.48 When the con secrating priest says 'hoc' it is his intention to refer to the body of Christ; he forms the complete mental proposition when he begins to speak.49 There is no need to think in terms of the pronoun being uttered in advance of the words which give effect to the reality it points to. Mental proposi tions are independent of time and can be wholly thought in an instant.50 All this presupposes that words do something, that there are two different things for 'hoc' to signify, bread and body, before and after the utterance of the rest of the sentence. 'Hoc est corpus meum' is a unique case and the ultimate justification for this way of thinking about the relationship of words and things. Calvin was anxious to repudiate the idea that the words of consecration worked upon the bread in this special way. He accepts the 'joining' of the sign and the thing signified in the sacrament (the sign is that 'cui res signata con iuncta est'). He concedes that the thing signified is the truth of the signification (Veritas). But he argues that what happens when the word is used of the thing divine instead of the created thing is simply a transference of the word from one 'thing' to another. This he classifies with other similar figures of speech in Scripture, a 'sacramentalis locutio' which is no more than a metonymy. He gives a few instances: Christ is called a rock; the Holy Spirit is called a dove. Since there is no dispute that the name of the thing they figure is given to signs in this way in Scrip ture, he asks, why should the eucharist be any different? Why should what has been common doctrine since Augustine not apply to all the sacraments?51 Calvin would thus put the link between word and thing at no more than a 'testimonium' that the Lord designs an earthly and corruptible sign for our spiritual use.52 If the substance of the thing signified were to 47 Ockham, Quodlibets, II, Opera Theologica, IX, ed.

Evans be actually changed by the words which describe it, it would cease to be a sign and become the thing signified, and then we should not have a sacra ment at all.53 To adore the consecrated host is not to adore Christ but to reverence 'a little bit of bread'54 he says; we have confused sign and thing signified by misunderstanding the way the words are being used and defeated God's purpose in giving us the sacrament. We have not used the bread as a means of coming to a spiritual encounter with the divine reality, but become stuck at the stage of contemplating the bread itself. In what sense, then, can it be said that we eat and drink the body and blood of Christ? Calvin insists that we do so; it is necessary for our salva tion that we possess him in this way, as he makes himself ours, and we receive him as nourishment for eternal life.55 Yet in some sense the substance of the sacraments is Christ himself and is by them com municated to us.56 He adds the reality of himself to the bread and wine. How, when his body is in heaven and we are still pilgrims on earth, can this be possible? He does it by raising our minds to heaven to obtain the reality of the signs.57 Thus there is a relationship of signification between the sign and the thing signified in which there resides a reality. In bap tism, water is more than a figure of absolution. It is indeed a figure, says Calvin, 'but still reality is annexed to it'.58 He explains what he understands by 'reality' here in his account of the appearance of the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove at the baptism of Jesus. Our Lord, he says, wanted to give a visible appearance to Spirit at his baptism. So he presented him in the form of a dove. John the Baptist himself says that he saw nothing but the dove; that is right, argues Calvin, for the Holy Spirit cannot be seen. Yet John knew that the vision he saw was a certain sign of the presence of the Holy Spirit and so he does not hesitate to say that he saw the Spirit (John 1.32). The intellectual certainty of a truth presented by a sign, the experience of the spiritual reality in and through the sign, are both implied here. But this 'annexing' of the thing signified to the sign would seem to involve something more than the sign's pointing beyond itself in Calvin's mind. Not only was John the Baptist sure that the Holy Spirit was present when he saw the dove, we 'truly receive in the Supper the body and blood of Christ'; if he gave us only bread and wine, leaving the spiritual reality behind, the institution of the Last Supper would be a deception.59 The sacrament is not a sign alone, but 'is com bined with the reality and substance'.60 53 Short Treatise on the Lord's Supper, para. 39, pp. 182-5. 54 On Shunning the Unlawful Rites, 383. 55 Short Treatise on the Lord's Supper, para. 10, p. 169. 56 Catechism of the Church of Geneva, 89-90 and 105. 57 Ibid. 91. 58 Ibid. 87. 59 Short Treatise of the Lord's Supper, para. 15, p. 171, para. 17, p. 172. 60 Ibid. para. 14, p. 171.</page><page sequence="11">Calvin on signs 45 The point need not be laboured to make it plain that the sacramental signs are part of the larger complex for Calvin, and it is in part because he associates the dangers of the abuse of all sorts of signs (relics, images) that he is uneasy about any doctrine of the transformation of the consecrated elements which might seem to encourage the worship of the thing, rather than of what it signifies. The dilemma in which Calvin finds himself is set out clearly in more than one passage. On the one hand, he says, we neither tie the grace of God to the sacraments, nor do we transfer to them the work and influence of the Holy Spirit. It is not the sacraments which 'work' but God in them. 'We refer the whole efficacy to the Holy Spirit.' On the other hand, the sacraments are the instruments of God's grace, and their proper use can be effectual.61 The sacraments are instituted by Christ, and are therefore useful. But why are they needed if the Holy Spirit works in us directly? God certainly acts by the sacraments, exercis ing, cherishing, aiding and confirming our faith. 'The question turns upon this: should we ascribe all the parts of our salvation entirely to God alone, or does he himself by using the sacraments transfer part of his praise to them?'62 Calvin's dilemma was, then, a conscious one. It was also in many respects a medieval dilemma. That is, it was posed at least in part by habits of thought and philosophical assumptions inherited and still alive. It cannot be said that he wholly succeeds either in being consistent or in resolving the difficulties which had been apparent to his medieval predecessors. His contemporaries can be seen to be wrapped in similar tangles.
