<plain_text><page sequence="1">David Wright Louis Andriessen: Polity, Time, Speed, Substance Timeo danaos et donaferentes is usually construed as the old tag that warns against Greeks who came bearing gifts. But shouldn't we be just as suspicious of contemporary music bearing classical texts, whether they be Greek and authoritarian in tone, or the Latin speculations of a Philosopher- Saint? Particularly when the composer in question, Louis Andriessen, is a radical who espouses Anarchist politics but also writes works which feature extensive stylistic reference to Boogie- Woogie. Clearly this combination represents a curiously individual - even bizarre - viewpoint, but does it need to be taken very seriously? After all, it's open to any composer to incorporate chunks of Plato and St Augustine as an intellectual gloss or as a form of recondite titivation - added flavours in the musical recipe, expressly designed to convey gravitas. So do Andriessen's own raids on classical philosophy (among others) amount to more than a questionable sort of opportunism? And if the purpose is demonstrably serious, is the musical result able to bear the weight of the issues it seeks to deal with? In this article I shall focus on three 'concept' pieces by Andriessen (De Staat, 1972-76; De Tijd, 1980-81, De Snelheid, 1982-83, rev. 1984) which, together with De Materie (Parts I-IV, 1985/8) occupy a central place in his oeuvre. I shall attempt to outline the nature of the relationship in these works between the back- ground philosophical issues and the musical result, while discussing how their musical idiom responds to the compositional challenges posed by their subject matter. My opening remarks might also draw attention to a complicating factor in the reception of Andriessen's work. For his music provokes strong, even extreme opinions, pro et contra, a reaction fuelled by its characteristically uncompromising, hard-edged sound, minimalist material and variable quality. Given the nature of his political attitudes, this is something Andriessen is hardly likely to regret. Neither might he be sorry that certain aspects of his work seem to have been highlighted at the expense of others, with the emphasis on the exhilarating nature of the raucous hocketings and repetitive, jazz-based idioms of his earlier street-band music; especially as the musical controversy this avowedly 'vernacular', political, street music generates is bound up with its original anti-establishment purpose. Yet from a wider critical perspective, such focus can be too much at the expense of the more reflective nature of Andriessen's output that is represented by De Tijd and Parts II and IV of De Materie, for example.. Interestingly, several works of both sorts - 'street' and 'philosophical' - have composition dates which suggest extended gestation periods and crafted realization. Both extremes of this stylistic and expressive diversity are integral to the composer's musical personality, and they are fully represented in the works discussed below. In one sense, for example, De Staat, with its hard, almost unremitting assault, might well be considered the apogee of Andriessen's 'street' style. But it strikes deeper in its cumulative effect, for De Staat's music generates a striking image that substantiates its warning against totalitarian repression. Inevitably, some listeners will feel such philosophizing irrelevant, finding the music's vivid aggression sufficient and exciting enough in its own terms. But ultimately, that would be to trivialize the intentions behind these 'concept' works which have occupied Andriessen in the last 20 years. They set out to deal with big themes and the ability of music to express them: the relationship between music and politics in De Staat; our awareness and sense of time in De Tijd ('Time'), and of speed in De Snelheid ('Velocity'); essence and experience in De Materie ('Matter'). Hoketus (1977/8) provides a preliminary musical context that helps to place these four 'concept' works. It came out of a project that was both an exploration and a critique of American minimal art, which Andriessen began with his students at The Hague Royal Conservatory in 1977. As the title implies, the material is thrown about in antiphonal exchanges between two matching instrumental groups. Hoketus is important because it illustrates two basic attitudes in Andriessen's music. The first involves the musical ideal of a work evolving out of a collaborative relationship between composer and performers: a stance grounded in Andriessen's politics. The</page><page sequence="2">8 Louis Andriessen: Polity, Time, Speed, Substance second points to the European rootedness (as opposed to American orientation) of Andriessen's work. For essentially what he has accomplished is to refurbish the 'American' repetitive idiom with the 'European' concern for an internal musical opposition which yet contains the potential for an ultimate synthesis. It is this seemingly unlikely accommodation of repetitive techniques with symphonic concepts that provides the clearest indication of Andriessen's enterprise, and which is illustrated in the three works that are the particular concern of this article. Another characteristic of Andriessen's Eurocentricity is his quotation and use of compositional techniques from earlier music, as instanced by the hocket (although in Hoketus it achieves a relentlessness unmatched by any medieval composer!) Andriessen explained one aspect of his critique of Minimalism in the programme note to the work: What makes the piece Hoketus differ from most minimal art compositions is that the harmonic material is not diatonic but chromatic, and that it radically abandons the tonal continuous sound-masses character- istic of most minimal art, [together] with the inclusion of all accompanying cosmic nonsense. Andriessen's desire for collaborative working with those who performed his music had its origin in the group 'De Volharding' ('Perseverance'), whose repertoire was intended to blur the boundaries between jazz and classical idioms. With 'De Volharding' and later with 'Hoketus' (the group took its name from the work), Andriessen experienced a freedom in matters of style that he felt encouraged to develop in his compositions, building particularly on his enthusiasm for jazz. Frustrations in hearing his music performed (or perhaps he would consider it straight-jacketed) by 'classical' musicians developed into an anti-symphony orchestra stance (neatly mirroring his antagonism to musical establishments), which explains some of the scoring decisions he makes in his work. This enthusiasm for jazz also represented a musical rejection of the Darmstadt avant-garde, but while American jazz was musically vital, politically America was not, and 'De Volharding' was born out of the 1971 campaign, 'Musicians for Vietnam'. De Staat is about the contradiction between Plato's philosophical view of music in The Republic (attributing to it an intrinsic power which in the wrong hands poses a threat to good order), and the actuality (experienced by Andriessen), which is that music is impotent to achieve anything like the sort of radical upheaval Plato envisaged. So there is something of a sense of regret lying behind the intended irony of Andriessen's choice of Plato's text, strongest in the final chorus (Republic IV 424 c3-6): . . . beware of changing to a new kind of music. .. Any alteration in the modes of music is always followed by alteration in the most fundamental laws of the state.1 1 Translation by A.D. Lindsay. (photo: Camilla van Zuylen)</page><page sequence="3">Louis Andriessen: Polity, Time, Speed, Substance 9 This 'new kind of music' is symbolized by the radicalism of De Staat's repetitive idiom, as well as by its anti-lyrical stridency and anti-melodic character. The instrumention is also suitably unconventional in line-up. Two matching instru- mental groups are antiphonally arranged on stage (each with two oboes, trumpets, horns, trombones and violas; one electric guitar, piano and harp). Between them is a bass guitar and a chorus of four women's voices. The music contrasts textures characterized by unison elements, and textures The focus of De Staat's polemic comes in its three choral sections. Not surprisingly, therefore, their position within the work determines both the arrangement and the musical nature of the surrounding parts of the work's block structure, as instrumental sections lead towards them, and afterwards provide further musical commentary. The first chorus has A as its nodal pitch, and a uniform, measured delivery projected against the accompaniment's harmonically static quaver pulse (Ex.1). In this passage (Republic III 397 b7- Ex. I Eli De Staat Chorus4 J I | J |j J | l e - an tis a - po - di - doj Parts m - W - - Po _ W _ - _ _ I +2 :c/ ten X X ped. ten ['o -i , based on imitation or hocket (themselves both forms of displaced unison). Perception of this aspect of De Staat's process is facilitated by the mirrored instrumental layout, as in the concluding passage following the final chorus. Here, the anti- phonal presentation of the lurching, hiccupping rhythms of the whole-tone canon begins a tone apart at the distance of six quavers. But the comes gradually shortens this lead and narrows that interval by a semitone, until the piece comes to a rest on a long held unison G#. De Staat shows one way that Andriessen uses musical means to illustrate the point that only through the friction of musical opposition can there be the desired goal of constituent elements achieving an eventual synthesis. Where De Staat is built around different kinds of unison figures, De Tijd's concern is with the operation and interaction of layers of material that do achieve accord before again separating out. The very different processes in De Snelheid articulate the dialectic between different velocities which yet finally mange to synchronize in the closing moments. This confirms the primacy that Andriessen gives to the teleological effect of these pieces - the sense of individual elements being drawn together over the duration of a piece - a common aspect of these three 'conceptual' works, which are in fact constructed around different sorts of musical processes. From them it can be argued that, on a musico-philosophical level, Andriessen views the achievement of an eventual musical accord in a wider sense, as representing something of an idealized state. c2) Plato's concern is with how poetic content should be expressed, and we are warned against the type of delivery resorted to by a 'lower sort' of person who favours representation with the imitation of effects. Much to be preferred is narrative, the form suitable for and'favoured by the 'high minded': If it [the narrative style] be given a musical mode and rhythm in accord with the diction, it may be performed correctly in almost the same mode throughout; that is, since character is so uniform, in one musical mode, and also in similarly unchanging rhythm.2 The relationship between text and music can be seen to operate on two levels. On the surface it is an amusing pun about the nature of repetitive music - itself a style characterized by stretches of musical uniformity. But there is a deeper implication. For Plato's authority is not only invoked to appear to be praising this upstart style as 'high minded', but the criteria by which he seems to do so, simultaneously attacks the traditional apparatus of Western art music. So by his realignment of Plato, Andriessen turns artistic canons upside down in such a way as to undermine our basic assumptions about musical ways and means. As part of this process, one might relish other ironies implicit in Andriessen's treatment, for example the use only of women's voices in texts concerned with male education, and the musical puns on Plato's dismissal of imitation. 2 Translation by A.D. Lindsay.</page><page sequence="4">10 Louis Andriessen: Polity, Time, Speed, Substance The culmative effect of De Staat's musical imagery is powerful enough to persuade the listener that Andriessen's message is capable of transcending the immediacy of the composer's own situation and political preferences. Certainly the rebarbative nature of its sound is self- evidently a direct result of Andriessen's own cultural choice (an 'anti-symphonic polemic', as he calls it), as are its musical techniques. But within it is strong differentiation between passages that are invigoratingly raunchy and those which are malign. The harshest musical comment - the rhythmic unison of an instrumental jackboot stomp - follows from the central choral section (Fig.37), where the text comments on the wisdom of purging the city from undesirable elements. For as this music expresses it, History has produced too many unspeakable illustrations of the subjective manipulation of a society for its own good. And so in this more universal sense, the overall oppressiveness of De Staat's sound represents a graphic warning against totalitarianism. In several respect, De Tijd is De Staat's opposite. On one level, its contemplative stance contrasts with De Staat's action; while on another, the mentorship of the Christian teacher, St Augustine, is itself hardly a predictable enthusiasm. But at the centre of De Tijd stands Augustine's fundamental question, 'What, then, is time'. And so, transferred onto the musical plane, the work manipulates our perception of musical time by means of its structural organization and technical detail, and engages us by the poetry that these generate. One of the means of measurement which Augustine proposes to judge time (a short syllable in relation to a long) suggests an iambic pattern, and this becomes the work's basic durational unit. Some phrases of St Augustine's text (Confessions, Book 11, Chapter 11) give rise to the harmonic concept that Andriessen explores in De Tijd: ... if only [men's] minds could be seized and held steady, they would be still for a while and, for that short moment, they would glimpse the splendour of eternity which is for ever still... [I]n eternity ... all is present... They would see how eternity in which there is neither past nor future, determines both past and future time.3 As will be seen, this conception of eternity suggested the central harmonic metaphor of De Tijd, an image reinforced in the phrase from Dante which heads the score, 'gazing at the point where all times are present'. These texts therefore provide the clue to what Andriessen attempts in De Tijd, which is to mediate between conjuring up the sense of an 3 Translation by R.S. Pine-Coffin. ever continuing present which is outside time, and the compositional presentation of events that unfold within a temporal continuum. The musical strategy is designed to facilitate the counter- pointing of different time scales within the larger plan, by means of a constructivist schema of duration lengths that controls the layered cycles of material. Individually, these proportions are articulated in distinctly characterized musical gestures, which are anthropomorphic in their ability to suggest different types of human reaction to the experience of time. So where the long sustained notes and virtually continuous lines of the women's choir present an obvious symbol of eternal time, the various moods associated with images of secular time, such as the heaviness of time hanging, or the threat of time quickly passing, are captured by the instrumental sounds and textures. But throughout De Tijd is the sound of bells, imbuing its ritual progress with a sense of the numinous. The procedures governing the durational values of De Tijd's structural cycles are based on those of the isorhythmic motet, and their systematic decrease of duration values fuels the work's gradual accumulation of momentum. The fact that the piece lasts for some 41 minutes, and as notated occupies a mere 248 bars, gives an indication of its extended nature. As De Tijd opens, the slowness of the rate of change in the strings and voices is suggested by their note- length of eight crotchets at a stated metronome marking of 48. The effect is strikingly atmospheric, for the chords form a translucent backdrop to the choir's slow phonetic (rather than semantic) presentation of the text. This length then reduces, with choir and strings now moving at different rates. Meanwhile a third duration cycle, or talea, is proceeding simultaneously but at a very different place. It governs the independent 'bell' chords of the piano and crotales, whose notionally iambic, short-long pairing is initially struck at distances of 12 and 24 beats, respectively. The distance is reduced as the piece progresses, and the listener increasingly becomes aware of the iambic pattern. This quickening of events is matched in other instrumental cycles, and by an increase in textural density as the work drives to its climax, beginning with the instrumental anacrusis at bar 184. However, not all the duration patterns are so predictable. For as the piece winds down, the choir's notes again lengthen, again backed by string chords. But now these chord durations are more shifting, less rational, so emphasizing the symbolically 'eternal' quality of the vocal effect. De Tijd offers a good example of Andriessen's</page><page sequence="5">Louis Andriessen: Polity, Time, Speed, Substance 11 harmonic approach and shows that a residual tonal function continues as an important feature. For example, he complements the more mechani- stic sense of momentum, generated by the contracting durational process, with the instrinsically musical dynamic of harmonic tension and release. However, this functionality is occluded at times by Andriessen's attempt to encapsulate the text's notion of time standing still, by using chords designed to suspend the feeling of musical motion. The characteristic of these chords is that they combine both dissonance and its resolution, and so are capable of performing a plural role; it is the context which indicates which function (arsis-stressed or thesis- resolution) predominates at a given moment, and in determining this, the spacing of the chords is crucial. In discussion with Elmer Schonberger4, Andriessen showed that the idea of this chord originated in the form given in Ex.2(a), which then became that of Ex.2(b), the superimposition of two dominant chords without fifths, standing a fifth apart. It could be argued that, as an allegory of the text, the dominant's impulse to the tonic is thwarted by the tonic being simultaneously part of the 'dominant' chord, in effect an harmonic stasis produced by the exertion of two opposing forces which suspend the teleological nature of tonality, while retaining its polar function (in the Stravinskian sense) of co-ordinating pitches. But in fact, as suggested by my sketch (Ex.3) of the harmonic structure of the opening bars (which covers the work's first two sections), the play of harmonic tension and release can continue to dominate on the longer scale. De Tijd's tonality progresses over the course of the work, moving away from the opening polar centricity on A (in such concepts of polarity, as in many other ways, Andriessen's debt to Stravinsky is profound, and readily acknowledged). This mobility can be shown in relation to the succession of nodal pitches on which the choral strata is based (Ex.4). The fact that the piece is not tonally 'closed', but that the concluding section rather offers a new harmonic vista, is very much a reflection of the philosophical thrust of Saint Augustine's text. For it has not, after all, proved possible to hold men's minds 'steady', an aspiration that is against both their nature and that of the musical art which has been used as a metaphor. But on a musico-philosophical level, harmonic closure of the work would have implied that our experience of time was in some sense complete; whereas, as Augustine indicates, we may begin to grasp the issue, but it is outside our destiny to resolve it. There is a connecting sound as well as a conceptual link between the fast log drum pulse at the very end of De Tijd and the ever-quicker ticking of the wood block which characterizes De Snelheid. The musical process of De Snelheid was prompted by a light-hearted remark relating the experience of a car's velocity to the musical pace of a piece being played on the car radio: the question 'How fast do we have to drive to be as fast as the music?'. This set Andriessen to write a piece dealing with contradictory perceptions of musical velocity, and showing that this paradox arises as a result of a confusion about its nature. He wished to demonstrate that musical speed is inseparable from the rate of harmonic rhythm, but setting up a dialectic between velocity articulated by pulse rate (whose nature is not intrinsically musical), and that articulated by harmonic changes (which is).

I I I I</page><page sequence="6">12 Louis Andriessen: Polity, Time, Speed, Substance Description of De Snelheid's process is likely to make it seem more unremittingly predictable than it actually sounds to the listener. The orchestra (again of an 'anti-symphonic' nature) is divided into three groups, with the third placed centre stage and the mirrored forces of the two 'pulse' groups on either side. These keepers of the pulse (made up of two each of saxes, trumpets, horns, trombones, a tuba and four large wood- blocks) hocket the material across the dividing stage space. The rather different sound of the third orchestral group (flutes, two electric harps, bass guitar, Hammond organ, strings and percussion) is sufficiently distinct to pinpoint the harmonic rhythm. Andriessen's basic strategy pits the high, fast pulse sound against the low percussion sound of the third orchestra, which having failed early on to keep up with the pulse of the others, gradually establishes a powerful momentum of its own. This eventually overwhelms the whole texture, and is finally joined by the former 'pulse' groups to end the work in a symbolic accord. The sound of the pulse is constant until, in a very Ligeti-like gesture, it becomes an undifferentiated tremolo, suggesting the sort of speed where individual elements are distinguishable only by means of a stroboscope. The rhythm of the third orchestra, sounded by the bass drum (which has an associated 'after-tock' from the tom-toms) is heard at a ten bar interval. The system of tempo modulation which marks the quickening of the process, provides smooth changes of pace until an escalated diminution (from fig.47) heightens the final drive to the cadence. Finally, matters have been so compressed that events at the conclusion occur at several times the speed than was the case at the beginning. While De Snelheid builds to a drama, the point of its process depends upon the clear delineation of contrasting elements. In consequence, the musical material is necessarily circumscribed rather than expansive, and at times the invention can seem very thin (especially at the outset, where the stretches spanning individual events are widest). On the other hand, the compression of the final stages has an exciting, even exhilarating effect. De Snelheid illustrates some- thing of the problem facing works composed in response to a philosophical inquiry - namely the potentially difficult artistic conflicts generated between articulating the process and ensuring that the result has sufficient musical interest to validate it. De Snelheid is typical of Andriessen in its occasional subversion of constructivist rigour. Several times the bass drum fails to sound the beginning of a cycle; once it re-enters a bar too early and once a bar too late. Given the scrupulousness of many of the details of Andriessen's scores, these contradictions seem engagingly more like an artistic antidote to the relentlessness of impersonal systems. Discussion of Andriessen's most extended music theatre project to date, the four-work cycle De Materie, would take a further article. But for present purposes, some brief pointers will show that De Materie expands the approaches that have characterized the three works already surveyed. But one of De Materie's unexpected aspects is that in function and emotional weight, the sequence of its four constituent works correspond to the groundplan of a four-movement symphony. And here, Andriessen5 draws the distinction in attitude between being anti the symphonic orchestra (which he is) and being anti-symphonic, per se. So Part 1 (itself called De Materie) functions as the cycle's exposition, followed by the 'slow move- ment' of Part 2, Hadewijch. The 'scherzo' is the boogie-woogie dominated De Stijl, Part 3, while Part 4 (also called De Materie) functions as a musical conclusion. The symphonic comparison is emphasized by the relationship of the subject matter of each part in terms of the whole: for, as with the three earlier works, De Materie expresses a philo- sophical issue. Its preoccupation is with the nature of substance, and in particular the relationship between its physical and spiritual properties. Part 1 sets this out, together with a reference to revolutionary politics. It presents the unlikely coupling of the Declaration of Dutch Independence from Spain ('Plakkaat van Verlatinge', 1581) and a treatise on shipbuilding: the spirit of the revolutionary fervour that generated the Declaration is paralleled by the physical components of a ship, for ship-building reflects the material means to survival and so of sustaining independence. A further strand is the disquisition on the nature of structure and its composite particles by the Dutch philosopher Gorlaeus (David van Goorle, b.1591). The orchestral hammer-blows which open the work have an obvious onomatopoeic function. The sustained lines and musical intensity of Hadewijch's gradual unfolding are in direct contrast to the anti-operatic delivery and the abrupt contrasts of Part 1. Here, a sense of harmonic progression builds a musical passion mirroring the part-erotic vision of this 13th- century woman mystic. Hadewijch's accumulated power is abruptly released by the very different sort of frenzy that characterizes the Mondriaan- 5 Telephone conversation with the composer.</page><page sequence="7">Louis Andriessen: Polity, Time, Speed, Substance 13 centred De Stijl. The relationship of its jazz idiom to Mondriaan is explained by the titles the artist chose for his paintings, such as Broadway Boogie- Woogie. Rather more significant to De Materie's purpose are the theories of art which absorbed Mondriaan, such as those of Dr M.H.J. Schoenmaekers (which feature in the text), and the painter's own concern with 'the disentangling of essence from attributes', to use Robert Hughes' particularly apposite phrase6. De Stijl's celebration of life and art is succeeded by images of death and dissolution in Part 4, with poems by Willem Kloos and Madame Curie's prose expression of grief for her husband. The relentlessness with which this musical monolith pursues its course is an image of the inevitability of death, characterized as an instrumental chorale whose individual chords are rotated across the orchestral texture - drawn gradually closer together in an impressive climax which, at its height, has a percussive quality that recalls the hammering of Part 1. Music from the historical past has a significant role in De Materie. In Part 1, Bach's Prelude in E flat (from Book 1 of Das Wohltemperiete Clavier) is used in several ways. Firstly it acts as an architectural model based on the internal propor- tions of its tripartite plan (two distinct textures which are then combined), incorporated into the structure of Part 1. Second, the several distinct musical characteristics of Part 1 notionally reflect those of the Bach Prelude (Bach's initial toccata figuration becomes the opening 'toccata' of unison chords, for example, while the following, more vocal ricercare texture is paralleled in the close harmony choral setting of the 'Plakkaat'). Thirdly, in the Bach there is a coincidence between the head-motif that opens this ricercare section and the first phrase of the old Netherlands' favourite chanson, 'L'homme arme'. The tune was so popular that it appeared as a cantusfirmus in a large number of Mass settings, including famous ones by Dufay andJosquin, and this usage appealed to Andriessen, who buries the tune (carried by guitars and horns) as a cantus firmus within the texture of his own work. It accom- panies the Declaration, a positioning appropriate to the chanson's martial imagery. A structural characteristic that Andriessen develops throughout the De Materie cycle is the use of proportional relationships as the basis of musical planning. Examples include the propor- tional tempo scheme linking the individual parts of the cycle and the architectural ground plan of Rheims cathedral on which Hadewijch is organized. In De Stijl, Andriessen schematizes Mondriaan's painting Composition in Red, Yellow and Blue (1927) by isolating its five constituent elements (the eponymous colours, the background colour and the black connecting lines) and apportioning each to an instrumental group or musical line. The length of De Stijl is determined in relation to the painting's circumference, and the events are positioned in a way that is intended that they form an analogue of the visual composition. There are obvious dangers in removing the staged element of a music-theatre work, but Andriessen says that he also envisaged De Materie in terms of concert performance. British audiences will be able to experience the cycle in that format in the 1994 South Bank 'Meltdown' Festival. Despite the additional focus that this imposes, it is likely that they will find Andriessen's music able to sustain its two-hour span, and may possibly find themselves surprised by its expressive gamut. For it is the case that at a time when Repetitive pieces so often glide by in a coating of New Age anodyne, Andriessen's dialectical oppositions, with their gritty surfaces and rational structures, present a striking musical credibility.
