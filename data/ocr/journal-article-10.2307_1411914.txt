<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PSYCHOLOGICAL BASIS OF HEGELIE3M. BY ALXXANDER F8z^, B. A., Late Fellow at Clark University. I have already published in the American Joxrnal of Psychologyl what may be considered two contributiolls towards a new phase of psychological science, viz., the Psychology of Philosophy. As far as I am aware the method of treatment of philosophical systems used in these articles is almost entirely new. It aims at giving the psychological basis of the most fundamental principles of the vari- ous systems, and substituting for the mysticisms of the old philos- ophy more accurate categories obtained byscientific experiment. My first paper oSers an examination of the philosophical systems of Hobbes, LockeZ Berkeley and Hume from the standpoint of Visuali- sation; in whlch I attempted to show that many of the chief characteristics and short-comings of these systems have their fundamental basis in the psychological process of Visualization. In the other I have endeavored to point out an important group of conceptions, especially those of Natural Rea]ism, which have their psychological history in the sense of touch. Now I propose to offer a third contribution of the same nature, in which I shall endeavor to trace the influence of the discovery of galvanism in deteining the great system of philosophy presented by Hegel. In the development of the sciences there is perhaps no factor more potent than the psychological process of apperception. The development of the sciences undoubtedly does not take place ac- cording to any eternally fixed order, but rather through mutual influences,which are in many cases to a great extent accidental. The various sciences are necessarily interdependent; and out of this direct interdependence which gives rise to reciprocal action between them, there arises an opportunity for the constant activity of a great and powerful influence in determining their development, namely, that process which, since the time of Herbart, is known in psychology by the name of " apperception. " The conception gained through the experience of an interesting fact in one depart- ment of science serves as an " apperceiving type " for the cogni- tion of newly presented phenomena in other departments. Thus the law of gravitation once observed in a particular phenomenon SOOI1 appeared as the fundamental type of all physical action. Everything havillg the appearance of natural motion or force began to look like one more illustration of the law of gravitation. The discovery of the polarization of light was followed by the apper- ception of the polarization of heat. The refrangibility observed in light and heat led to the hypothesis of the refrangibility of sound. The theory that evaporation is a solution of water in airwas an unconscious assumptioIl that water and air stand to each other in a relatioll similar to that between salt and water. The theory of the atomic repulsion of the particles of the evaporating fluid, as an ex- 1VO1.

Of such apperceptive knowledge the whole intricate web of scientific theory is full. And this is the par- ticular psychological agency which we must keep constantly in view in tracing the influence of the discovery of galvanism on the mass of scientific and philosophic speculation which led to the production of the Hegelian system. The phenomenon of attractive and repulsive agency observed in magnetismhaslongservedasatype of scientific and philosophic apperception, and among the ancients as well as among the moderns has often formed the basis of the wildest and most estrav- agant mysticisms. In the earliest stages of physical and astro- nomical science all cosmical interactions, all actions between bodies at a distance, could be made intelligible only when classed under the general type of magnetic attraction or repulsion. Everything novel or strange in the shape of attractive or repulsive force, in any department of experience, naturally tended to be apperceived by the mystic mass of ideas gained from observation of magnetic action. So Gilbert tells us in his "De Magnete," that "the magnet and amber were cailed inaidby philosophers as illustra- tions, when our sense is in the dark in abstruse inquiries, and when our reason can go no further. " In these earlier times, however the phenomenon of magnetism stood apart from the great body of intelligible experience as an isolated fact, strange and mysterious in its nature. All facts and all systems of facts, accordingly, apper- ceived under this type, were on their very face mysticisms of the most mystical calibre. Very different is it, indeed, in the case of that period of discovery and speculation with which we have to deal in tracing that development towards a scientific consensus which followed upon the famous discoveries of Galvani and Yolta. Inthis period magnetic or electric agency still characterizes the "apperceiving mass" dominant in the speculation, but it is no longer an isolated fact: it is now scientific-close]y interwoven into, and widely spread throughout, the whole net of scientific experience. In this period we find the electric category of " polarity " presenting itself as the fundamental principle in all the sciences; weavlng itself rapidly, through the instrumentality of enthusiastic experi- mentation, into the basal network of Physics, Chemistry, Miner- alogy, Morphology, Anatomy, Physiology, the medical sciences, the social sciences, and various departments in the great body of facts which pertain to general experience. In this period, in short we find the principle of electricity as it was observed in galvanism accepted as the most satisfactory explanation possible of the fundamental facts of nearly all departments of knowledge- many facts, indeed, which in the light of modern science are as far from finding their explanation in this way as the east is from the west In this periodz consequently, facts apperceived under the type of magnetic or electric agency savored not the least of mysticism, but appeared truly scientific in their inmost fibre This diSerence between electric agency as an apperceptive type among the ancients and as an apperceptive type in the scientific period following the discovery of galvanismt illustrates a very im- portant law of apperception. The one all-lmportant thing which determines to what extent any observed phenomenon shall serve as an apperceiving "mass" for other phenomena is the itbterestwhich it excites. To the ancients the phenomenon of magnetism was not of universal interest. In fact it was of no realinterest; itwas rather a matter of curiosity. The discovery of galvanism, how-</page><page sequence="3">474 F:RASER: ever, seemed to carry within it a source of interest most real and intensean interest that bordered on the wildest e2rcitement. Amd now it becomes our investigation to inquire into this source of interest. Why allthis enthusiasmfollowingthe discoverar of gal- vanism ? Why should electricity suddenly take such a freak and nolently force itself into 80 many departments of knowledge into which modern science says it had no right to go ? What was there about the nature of galvanism that it should excite so mu¢h interest ? The great excitement which Galvani's experiments caused all over Burope was due principally to a circumstance in connection with hi# first di#covery, which was purely accidental and unes- sential to the true value of the #cience. This cir¢um#tance wa# the intimate connection of the e2mperiments with the animal orgaIiism and the phenomena of life. In it# fir#t announcement Galvani'# di#covery was given forth as a manife#tation of electricity under a new and remarkable character, namely, a# re#iding in the muscle# of animals. The limb# of adi##ected frogwhen touched with two heterogeneous metal#were observedto repeat almo#t all the mo- tion# of life. This fact once ob#erved the fir#tp#ychological ten- dency wa# to #ecretly #u#pecWand with great enthusia#m too-the probability that life wa# identical with electricity. And thi# on¢e su#pected, what could be more attractive than a headlong ru#h into the inve#tigation of electricity or galvani#m? Experiment# per- formed on e:xecuted criminal# met with #uch wonderful re#ults that men beganto hope that ere long the dead could be rai#ed. Life apparently revived! A thorough knowledge of galvani#m will give command over all the force# of life! In#piredby#uchphantom hope# men mrased enthusia#tic and mrere carried ofEtheir feet. A new #un appeared on the #cientific horizon in the intoxicated minds of it# wor#hipper#. A new #un-myth began to cry#tallize; a great scientific mythology began to dawn. Introduced in #uch a spirit of enthu#iasm, Galvani'# e:xperiment# were repeated, with variou# modification#, in all part# of Europe, exciting the greate#t curiosity and giving ri#e to the most extravagant speculation#. The #tudy of galvani#m soon became of paramount interest, not only to tho#e actively engaged in #cientific inve#tigation#, but even to many who were not. Valuable prize# were founded on all #ide# e:xpre#sly for promotingit#pro#ecution. Scientific institution# and #ocieties, a# well a# individual #cienti#ts, made it their problem of #pecial re#earch. Commi##ions from variou# in#titution# and #ocieties throughout Europe were appointed to inve#tigate the wonderful re#ults obtained by Galvalli and Volta. Not narrow or re#tricted in it# #cope, but fla#hing its magic light into all rece#se# of #cientific re#earch, repre#entative# of all department# of knowledge, Phy#- ics, Chemi#try, Phy#iology? Medicine, Biology, P#ychology, etc., were found bu#ily engaged ln experiment, with a view to its aE&gt;pli- cation in their particular #ubject# of investigation. The importance of galvani#m in the hi#tory of #cience i# indeed Ilot less than it was e#timated by the great band of enthu#ia#t# who devoted them#elve# to the #peculation# to which it gave ri#e in the fir#t #tages of it# hi#tory; but it# permanent scientific value i# of a character altogether diSerent from that which sugge#ted it#elf to their mind#. In every great #cientific discovery two kinds of value can alway# be ob#erved. Eir#t there i# it# value a# e#timated by tho#e who care for it in it# childhood-a value which generalls pa##e# oS into a ma## of #peculation, and is intere#ting afterward# only to the psychologist. Secondly, there i# it# true #cientific value into which it flnally settles down a value which remains per-</page><page sequence="4">manent throughout all further development of the sCience. 5dhe real #cientific value of the discovery of galvanism consists in none of the #peculation# to which it at any time gave ri#e, but in the practical means and many advantage# which it ultimately afforded for the ob#ervation of a larger number of fact# in variou# depart- ment# of #cience. But in thi# permanent #cientific value we are here not intere#ted; our intere#t i# in it# other value- the my#tic value attached to it in it# infancy. Ourintere#t centresinthat apperceptive type of #peculation which hovered about all the earlier experiment#, a type of #peculation which i# well illu#trated by a #tory told of Napoleon Bonaparte ju#t after he had called Volta to Pari#. After #eeing the decompo#ition of #alt# by the voltaic pile, he turned to Corvi#art, hi# phy#ician, and #aid: " Here doctor,i# the image of life; the vertebral column i# the pile, the liver i# the negative, the bladder the po#itive pole. "' Such #pecu- lation a# thi# i# deeply interwoven into the inmo#t dbre# of nearly all the thought of #core# of the greatest German #cienti#t# of the latter part of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth century. In its circulation through the variou# sciences, galvanism had two main avenues of approach. One was the science of chemistry, with which it was essentially connected; the other the science of phys- iology, with which it wa# accidently connected. In the department of chemistry, the decomposition of binary com- pounds by the "pile" laid the foundation of the whole so-called " electro-chemical " theory. From the wonderful facts collected by numerous e:xperiments along this line, quite early in the history of galvanism, a great theory of modern science was suspected and maintained, viz., the identity of chemical and electrical energy The chemical composttton of the fluid with the zinc in the voltaic pile, produces when the current is completed, a current of electric influences in tie wire; and this current, if it pass through an elec- trolyte, manifests itself there as decomposition, overcoming the chemical afflnity which resists it. The true scientific bearing of this fact was not properly understood until the time of Faraday. What we want to see however, is in what way it was understood by his predecessors. bhat these two sets of phenomena, the electrical and the chemical, were identical in principle, was undoubtedly appre- hended and maintained. But in what way wa# the common princi- ple apperceived? We find that the common principle was still the principle of electricity. Instead of electrical and chemical action being both referred to a common energy which manifests its nature in the#e two different ways, both were referred to electric agency The whole process, including chemical and electrical action, wa# apperceived under the type of electric action. Thus the forces at the point of composition and at the point of decomposition were con- ceived to be the same force; but this forcewas looked upon as mani- festing itself in the mystical polar opposition of the poles of the magnet or the positive and negative in electricity; composition and decomposition were polar opposites. In the recognition of the inti- mate relation between the two sciences, the chemical aspect of the #upposed common agency underwent #evere criticism, but the one thing that remained throughout uncriticised was the electrical aspect. (DonsequentlyX it served as the apperceiving " mass " for the facts of chemistry. Thus Berzelius, ths great (3wedish chemist, and a host of G[erman chemists considered that the descriptions in all 1 Becquerl, TraitF d'Electricit6* 476 HEGELISM.</page><page sequence="5">chemicalcombinations might be "polar." All chemical elements could be considered as electro-positive and elecjGro-negative. All elements were thus ¢la#sified: Hydrogen Oxygen, Acid, Alkali, etc. Andthis''polaropposition''theymaaethe basis of all their chemical doctrines. In the enthusiastlc apprehension of this polat relation of the chemical elementse all their phenomenal or sensibls qualities were 108t to view. The relation of polarity was conceived to constitute the very e88ence of the elements. Eydrogen, for exam- ple, was conceived to have its whole being and essence in its polar relation to other elements, just as the north pole of the magnet was conceived to have the essence of its being in its polar opposition to the south. A# Oken putsit, " The whole principle or rationale of chemical action consists in the potentiality of two elements to revert to their polar condition." Or, as Hegel puts it, " Objects chemically charged with diSerence are what they are expressly by that differ- ence alone." Tlle same tendency of speculation i8 also e2rhibited in the science of mineralogy. As the element# of all compounds could be de#cribed a# polar, that is, could be distinguished as electro-po#itive and elec- tro-negative, thus giving to every element a place in a serie# defined by the degree of the#e relations the electro-chemical hypothe#is seemed to aBord a rigorous and complete system of arrangement for the minerals. Accordingly, at one time, we find them arranged according to their electro-positive element, and the elements according to their electro-positive rank; at another time, accord- ing to their electro-negative element, andthe element# according to their electro-negative rank. Such #ystems of clas#ification were supported by such men a# Berselius, Gmelin, Bendant and Norden- skiold; and seemed thoroughly ju#tified bythe #tate of science at the time. Thu# in mineralogy, as in chemi#try, the tendency of thought which naturally grew out of the exaggerated estimation of the cate- gory of " polarity " was to entirely lo#e sight of the phenomenal or material element. The externalproperties of minerals, which are the proper object of the #tudy of mineralogy, were made to depend wholly on the electrical relatiom of their element#. " Such #chemes," say# Mr. Whewell in hi# " History of the Inductive Sci- ences," " e2rhibit rather a piay of the mere logical faculty, eser- cising it#elf on as#uined principle#, than any attempt at the real interpretation of nature."l From the #ide of physiology, the investigations were even more enthu#ia#tic. As the e2rperiment# were camed on by all the most active #cientist# of Europe, e#pecially by the Humboldts in Germany, the various phenomena of phy#iology, one by one, began to exhibit themselve# as manifestation# of electric agency. In the animal organi#m, the relation between whole and part wa# conceived to be that of polar opposition-that my#tical " diBerence in unity " which exhibit# itself originally in the phenomena of magnetic and electric action. Mu#cular contraction wa# e2rplained a# the mutual electric repul#ion of the fibre# which, on account of their being fa#tened at the e2rtremitie#, caused the muscle a# a whole to contract. Assain the underlying principle of all nervou# activity wa# explained on electrical principles. Ale2rander von Eumboldt made laborious and tedious attempt# to e2rplain "nerve current#" and "#ympathy" between nerve# by electrical " conduction." The animal organism wa# looked upon as an actual voltaic pile. Ihe #olid and fluid parts together formed a galvanic circuitXas did the metals and flwd in Volta'# pile. Every irritation, #en#ation and movement was con- 1 Vol. IIt. p. 243. 476 FR8BR:</page><page sequence="6">HEGELISM. 477 ceived to be a manife#tation of this galvanic agency. Thus Procha#ka explains #ensation: Any irritating body brought into contact with the organi#m form# a new link in it# galvanic circuit of solid and fluid part#, which cau#e# a quantitative and qualitative change in the electrical ten#ion, which i# conducted by the nerve# to thebrain, and thi#produce# #en#ation. So al#o "refles action." ReSleses, he #ay#, are " founded on electrical attraction and renul- sion of advantageou# or injuriou#irritations, according as the potarz- tqes of the organ and the irritatioll are identical or opposite," etc., etc. Into the science of morphology, too, the electrical category worked its way. For example, cells were viewed as standing to one another in the relation of polar opposition. aell-division was an illu#tration of electricity differentiating it#elf into the oppo#ite form# of po#itive and negative. The accumulation of cells into group# again took place on the principle of electric attraction. By #ome, the whole proce## of evolution in the animal kingdom was conceived to be nothing more nor les# than a galvanic proce#s exhibited inan endle#s number of variation#. Thu# we find #uch theorie# a#: The male corre#pond# to the po#itive and the female to the negative pole.

What would be organic must be galvanic; what would be alive must be galvanic. Galvanism lie# at the ba#i# of all organic con#titution; it is the rationale of organi#m.

The vital principle wa# gal- vanism. We have many illustrations of this doctrine in the history of medicine especially in thetheories of that group of physicians commonly aesignated as the " natural-philosophical School.XX2 John Christian Reil (1759-1813) was probably the first to clearly state the doctrine. According to him, the vital process was galvanism a potentialized galvanism. Irritability and sensibility are the two poles. Every organ manifests "polarity." The diaphragm is the indifferent point of the body. " Tension " prevails everywhere between organic and inorganic beings. Death arises from an elec- tricshockbywhich a neutralization of the "tensions" is accom- plished. In this doctrine, he was followed, with more or less varia- tion, by numerous othersz Dietrich, G. Rieser (1779-1862), professor at Jena, maintained that " polarity, conceived as a phenomenon is the basis of everything, since life is understood as an oscillatpon between a positive and negative pole, and the vital principle as the organic tension which kindles and supports this osciTlation." Ignaz Trosler (1790-1866), professor at Berne, conceived the various vital Oken. Physio-philosoph 2See Bass, History of Medicine. 4</page><page sequence="7">processes to stand in polar relation to one another: E2rcretion secretion, respiration, digestion, etc. E2rcretion is secretion directea externally, and secretion is exeretion directed internally. Respira- tion and digestion are identical in their essential tendencies and differ only in their relative direction. Life in its inmost character is individual productivity, in which the producing agent and the product are interwoven under the form of self-determination. This idea of self-determination,in which the producing agent and the product are indivisible,is the idea of self-differentiation as mani- fested in electricity. A similar view was held by Ph. Franz von Walther (1782-1849), professor of surgery, successively at Landshut, Bonn and Munich. He held the true essence of the organism to be that " it admitted no division of the idea of life." The primordial function of life is "self-production," "to which corresponds,in organic nature, magnetism." q: he original differentiating principle is apperceived under the type of magnetic differentiation. It differ- entiates itself into the two poles, irritability and sensibility, the former of which corresponds to electrical and the latter to chemical action. This was also the doctrine of Schelling, and of Hegel, too though perhaps in a disguised form. Among the pupils of Schelling who were mainly physicians, we find the same doctrine carried out to its extremes. All the phenomena and processes of life, and indeed of all nature, were arranged according to " polarities." Everything in nature was polar: Man, woman, irritability, sensibility, subjec- tivity, obJectivityl electricity, magnetism, o2rygen, hydrogen, acid, alkali, etc., etc. Here again we see illustrated the fatal tendency of the "polarity-myth.' The whole value of empirical facts of all kinds is lost to view, spiritualized away under the mystical meta- phor, and the only real thing left in all nature seems to be the rela- tion of polarity. Among those who supported this exaggerated theoretic type of doctrine were also a. H. Pfaff, Humboldt, J. F Ritter, Rheinholdt, Prochaska, Brandis, Treviranus, BischoS and Gropengieser. In the department of psychology the influence of galvanism is well illustratedin the theory of animal magnetism. A great por- tion of the literature on hypnotism, evenup to the present time is saturated with the mysticism of this doctrine. At the time which we have now under consideration, we find this theory supported by nearly all the physicians already mentioned; also by A. E. Kessler Wolfart Prof. Kluge ( a special Berlin authority) Hufeland, Eschen- mayer, iieser, Nasse, Walther, Ennemoser, and others.l The phe- nomenon of somnambulism in the hypnotic state was explained thus: The brain with all its dependent organs of motion was regarded as the positive or conscious pole; the sympathetic nerve, with its tissue of ganglia, as the negative or unconscious pole. In the somnambulistic state the vital power is driven from the brain or conscious pole to the sympathetic nerve or unconscious pole, whose larger tissues especially the "plesus solaris, " are turned intoa "sensorium, 7 which, as if by substitution, performs the functions of the brain This was supposed to account for the assertion by somnambulists that their consciousness has its seat in the pit of the stomach. The influence of the magnetizer on the patient was regarded as the ac- tion of the outer nervous pole (the brain) of the magnetizer on the corresponding positive pole of the patient, the former repelling the latter, according to the general law of polarization, by which means the nervous power of the magnetizer is concentrated on the nega- ___ 1 For a *ull account Qf these physicians see B«s' H&gt;tow of 5Iedicine. 478 FRASER:</page><page sequence="8">tive pole of the inner nervous system, the ganglia of the stomach of the patient. Qther phases of the same kind of do¢trine wers doIninant with regard to the relation between the brain and metals Metals were the simplest and most primitive production of the creative force, and consequently were diametrically opposed to the brain. Metal reduceswillto its primitive being. The positive or conscious pole in somnambulists ;s accordingly peculiarly sensitive to contact with metals, etc.? etc. Not only in the special sclences did this galvanic mythology have its sway, it also became deeply rooted in the fundamental constitu- tion of philosophic thought. The telldency of the scientific age i8 well illustrated by a passage from Schelling. " In the highest per- fection of natural science,8' he says, " the phenomenal or material element must disappear entirely and only the laws or formal ele- mentf remain. The more law becomes apparent in nature the more the hull or wrapping disappears- the phenomena tiemselves become more spiritual, and at last cease altogether. Optical phe- nomena are nothing more than a system of geometry whose lines .are drawn by the light, and the material nature of this light itself 1S already doubtful. In the phenomena of magnetism alltrace of nwaMer has already t/antshed. . . ." 1 At first sight we might view this tendency as bordering on a genuine idealism but on closer obser- vation it will be seen that this is not so. It is only a certain con- ception of matterX matter as a 4' coarse bulk7 " and not matter as such that tends to vanish, and what is substituted for it is itself of material origin. In the phenomena of magnetism all trace of maUerinthe ordinary meaning of the word may have indeed al- ready vanished but the remaining phenomenon of polarity is not therefore idealistic; it is still material forceJ and mightbe called spiritualism ormystic-materialism but not logical idealism. The illustration which Schelling regards most complete, the illustration of magnetism in which 11 trace of matter has already vanished, shows us clearly the root of tkis whole tendency to discard " the phenome- nal or tnaterial eletnent. ? It is the conception of polarity. Single force or laws of single force could not possibly appear to supply the place of matter; only when force presented itself in the Janus-like form of polarity did it appear able to do this. And only when polarity was read very estensively into the many forces and phe- nomena of nature did the material element become properly attenu- ased and appear to vanish. And tkis is what we i3nd: the concep-^ tion of polarity being estensively read into the phenomena of rlature and the material element as fastly disappearing. There seemed to be polarity in everything. Polarity in the universal law of gravitation in the fortn of a ratio of the squares of times to the cubes of di#tances passed over. Polarity in all mechanical force in its absolute and independent form, namely, the polarity expressed in vhe union of centripetal and centrifugal force. There is polarity in the colors, the proper objects of optical science. Polarity in the proper objects of mathematical science; for example7 in the ratio of the centre to the circumference of the circle. Polarity in more or less explicit fortn in the proper objects of all the special sciences, inductive and deductive. There is polarity also in the laws of the social sciences. Thus Hegel gives forth a doctrine of social chemism; and the one category of chemism in Hegel's time we sawwas polarity. This galvanic chemism is what takes place in the acquisition of a new language The German s SGauner- ' NYerke, It iiit 340 (quoted from A. Sath, IIegelianism and PerBollaiity) . HEGELISM. 479</page><page sequence="9">sprache " is a chemism of Hebrew and German. The morals and customs of familiest states and nations are all outward manifesta- tions of inward soclal chemism. The same principle is applied to politics, religion and asthetics. There are polar opposites in poli- tics; for example, anarchism and despotism, each of which when pushed to its extreme veers round into its opposite. There are polar opposites in religion, Ahe Father and the Son, and the higner unity in the Holy Spirit. There are polar opposii8 in asthetics, in tastes; for example, the French romantic and the antique, the neutralization of which two formed the normal taste under Ludwig XIV. Everywhere in nature, everywhere in experience, that two opposed facts could be found standing near to each other, they were conceived to be, now in more,. nowin less disguised or consciou# form, further e2ramples of the electrical category of polarity. The whole world began to appear as nothing more nor less than an infinity of antinomies. Kant in his studies of the four special ob- jects of cosmology recognized what he termed four antinomies of reason. But why leave them in the " realm of shades ?" VVhy any longer look upon them as dead, static contradictions of reasonv Filled with the living power of polarity, tiey will become four more of those living contradictions which move the world. The an- tinomies of reason and the polar antinomies of nature are the same antinomies; and the vitality of the latter must be read into the former. And they are not four, but spread out ccd infinitqhm throughout the rational constitution of the whole universe; they appear in all objects of every kind, in all conceptions, notions and ideas. Every actual thingwas thus conceived to involve the co- existence of polar elements. Every element of nature must have its opposite pole, or, as Hegel says, " its own other. " The whole world of experience seemed to fall apart into the quaint polarities of Mind-Nature, Subject-Object, Ego-Non-Ego, Thought-Feeling Sensory-Motor, Active-Passive, Irritability-Sensibilitv, Male-Fe- male, Day-Night, Good-Evil, Necessity-Contingency, Pleasure- Pain, Vitality-Mortality Matter-Form, Attraction-Repulsiont Centre- Circumference, /5entripetal-Centrifugal, Uni^ersal- Sin- gular, Identity-Difference Organic- Inorganic, Acid- Alkali, Oxygen- Hydrogen, Magnetism-ilectricity, Anarchy-Despotism, Father- Son, etc., etc. Polarity everywhere, polarity everything; this was the fundamental category in all knowledge, in science, socialism politics, religion, appearing sometimes "with open breast" and sometimes in subtle disguise, but always essentially the same cate- gory, whether expressed in such forms as the physio-philosophy of Oken or the social chemism of Hegel. Such, then, was the condition of the scientific age which gave birth to the philosophical system of Hegel. Knowing this, we are not surprised to find Hegel, a# he #urveys the world about him, phil- osophizing thus: " Everything that surrounds us may be viewed as an instance of dialectic. We are aware that everything finite instead of being infle-sible and ultimate, i# rather changeable ana transient; and this i# exactly what we mean by that dialectic of the finite, by which the finite, as implicitly other than what itis, is forced to surrender its own immediate or natural being, and to turn. suddazy into its opposite.''l "Everything is opposite. Neither in heaven nor in earth, neither in the world of mind nor of nature, is there anywhere such an abstract, ' either-or ' as the understanding maintains. 22 Wherever there is movement, wherever there is 1 Wallace'8 Hegel's Logic, p. 128. 2Ibid., p. 192. 480 FRASER:</page><page sequence="10">life, wherever allything is carried illto eifect in the actualworld there d ialectic i# at work. It is also the soul of all kllowlcdge tha; is truly scientific." " Every abstract form of the under#tanding, taken precisely a# it i# given, naturally veer# round into it# oppo- #ite.'l "Contradiction,aboveallthing#,i#whatmove#the world, and it i# ridiculous to #ay that contradiction is unthinkable. ' Let us now turn our attention to Hegel's logic with a view to de- termining what part the category of polarity played in the formation of his system. As we go on with this investigation let the object of our #earch be well defined. We recognizein Hegel the laborious and compre- hensive student, the patient observer of facts. We recognize in his work the value of the va#t number of important fact# which pa## before us in the " march of the object " towards it# completion in the motion. We recognize the profound philosophical critici#m of prev ious systems which accompanie# nearly every #tep of the dialectical evolution. We can agree with many of the general con- clusions. But with all the#e things we have nothing to do.

But this consideration is e:xternal. Hegel might be thu# indebted to electric science for his peculiar phraseology, and yet have obtained his fundamental principle from an entirely different and supremely higher source. Accordingly, the evidence which is to have validity in determining the question must be internal. What we must do, therefore, is to make an internal critici#m of the logic. If there is one place more than another in all the logic where the nerue of Hegel's philosophical principle is laid bare, it i8 in the doc- trine of essence. In this, we find the essential foundation of the dialectic made explicit. And the nerve of the doctrine of essence is the relation of identity and difference. These two categories standing togetherin a certain peculiar relation, form the basis of the whole logical procedure. In every step of the evolution, we find them activelypresent. In the doctrine of essence, Eegel, for the first time, make# explicit what he means by them, and what particu- lar kind of relation he conceives to exist between them. If we learn this well, then we practically learn all. Hegel begins his account of these categories with a statement of some true and arery important facts concerning them. The position adhered to in the " formal logic " with regard to them is stated and criticised. The inconsistency and untenability of such notions a# " abstract identity " and " abstract dilference " or " mere varlety " are clearly set forth. The indivisibility of identity and difference is insisted upon. Whenever we reflect on the notion of identity, we #ee that it implie# difference; whenever we reflect on the meaning of diBerence, we find that it implies identity, etc., etc. But in all the#e critici#m# and statement# of fact#, he i# not yet #tating hi# principle of interpretation; he i# only preparing the way for it. Now let U# see how he state# his interpretation. He begin# thus: " Difference implicit or in itself i# a difference of the es#ence, and includes both the positive and negative, and that in this way: The positive is the identical connection of #elf in #uch a way as not to be negative and the negative is the different by itself so a# not to be positive. ihu# either i# on it# own account, in proportion as it i# not the other. The one #how# in the other, and i# only in #O far a# that other i8.77} SO far anyone will readily ob#erve that what is #tated i8 the theory of the relation between positive and negative in electricity. But he continues: " The essential difference is, therefore, opposition; according to which the different is not faced by any other but by its own other or special antithesis."l This last passage gives us the key to the whole matter. If we fully grasp all that is implied in this peculiar kind of " opposition," in which the different is not facedby any other but by its own other, it will at once appear clear that the principle cannot be one of pure logic or pure thought. Professor A. Seth, in his work entitled " Hegelianism and Personality," says: " The opposition which Hegel makes his fulerum is contrary or real opposition; the second is not simply the negative of the first, but both are real determinations of things. But if this is so, then the Sirst does not of itself strike round into its opposite. The opposite arises for a subjective reflection which has the advantage of acquaintance with the real world." This is undoubtedly true. The dialectical evolution cannot possibly be a process of pure thought. The opposition is real; the two elements are real determinations of thinge and consequently mu#t be learned through experience. But I thini there i# still more definitene## implied in Hegel'# oppo#ition. 1 TVallace's lIegel's Logic, p. 189. 482 FRASER:</page><page sequence="12">It is restricted not only to real opposition, but it is a partwular kind of real opposition. Each element has it8 own other, its own special antithesis. Now this i8 not necessarily even a matter of experience -that i#, of necessary experience. It would require a partict4lar experience to know the special o?po#ition of things. The opposition i# not of the nature of that opposltion with which we are acquainted in general experience-it is a very peculiar kind of opposition. Now what is it? B:ow does Hegel define it? The best definition he can find i# the conception of polarityinphysics notthebestillustation, but the best deJinitio7w. "The conception of polarity," he says 4' which is so dolninant in phy#ic#, contain# by implication the more correct definition of oppo#ition.''l Let U# #top a moment and reflect. A# we read Eegel'# description of hi# fundamental principle in thi# chapter on es#ence, and watch him draving it out, a# he profe##e# from the rational con#titution of things, can we ob#erve whence he 1# taking it? I# he taking it from logic or from phy#ic#? It certainly does not savor of logic. If it is logic, it is certainly an entirely novel kind of logic. Nothing is more dete#table in Hegel'# #ight than the " ordinary logic.' He takes its matter a# hi# matter, but give# it an entirely new #etting. Now what does thi# new #etting amount to? What i# he really doing? Is he not jU#t reading into logic the " polarity science " which was so dominant at his time? The conception of polarity had been well spread through the phy#ical #cience# by other#. Hegel recognizes this. " In modern physical science,' he says, " the opposition first observed to e2rist in magnetism as polarity, has come to be regarded as a univereal law pervading the whole of nature."2 And he approves of this as " a genuine advance in science.t' But no one as yet had app3ied the conception to the sphere of thought. Physicists when they had any speculation to do in thi# sphere, still adhered to the old formal logic. And Hegel contemptuously disapproves of thi#. After urging the conception of " polarity " as the more cor- rect definition of that " opposition " which he makes the fulerum of his dialectic, he finds fault with the physical scientists thus. ' But phy#ic# when it has to deal with thoughts adhere# to the ordinary logic; and it may, therefore, well be honiaed in case it #hould ever expand the ¢onception of polarity, and see the thoughts which are implled in it."3 I do not mean to #ay that Hegel i# con#ciou#ly trying to apply the phy#ical category of polarity to logic. He i# not trying to give a physicalinterpretationofthought. Hi#aim and procedure are far above #uch type of materiali#m. What he means to do i# rather to apply the principle implied in the phy#ical conception to the consti- tution of thought. But how much of what i# implied in " polarity " doe# he #how u#? Simply nothing. The one principle or conception which remain# with him wholly uncritici#ed throughout is the con- ception of polarity. The very kind of polar behavior which we per- ceive in phy#ical phenomena i# exactly the #ame behavior which we ob#erve in the dialectic. Whenever Eegel reache# this peculiar kind of behavior he i# sati#fied; he ha# no de#ire to go any further. He never a#ks whether thi# behavior i# it#elf rational.

" Positive and negative," he continues, " are, therefore, intrinsically conditioned by one another, and have a being only when they are connectixrely referred to each other. The north pole of the magnet cannot be without the south pole, and vtce versa. If we cut a magnet in two, we have not a north pole in one piece and a south pole in another. Similarly, in elec- tricity, the positive and the negative are not two diverse and inde- pendent fluids. In opposition, the different is not followed by any other, but by its own other. Usually we regard different things as unaffected by each other. Thus we say: I am a human being, and around me are air, water, animals, and all sorts of things. Every- thing is thus put outside of every other. But the aim of philosophy is to banish indifference and to learn the necessity of things. By that means, the other is seen to stand over against its other. Thus, for example, inorganic nature is not to be considered merely something else than organic nature, but the necessary antithesis of it." 1 The fundamental iaws in electrical phenomena are the repulsion of the homogeneous and the attraction of the heterogeneous, which are in reality only two phases of the same law. In this law, Hegel sees the unity of attraction and repulsion. Thus the positive and negative, in so far as they are positive and negative? are hetero- geneous, and already involve repulsion. But the positlve and nega- tive are always attracting each other. Hence, we never find repulsion without attraction. So, conversely, we never find attrac- tion without repulsion. Homogeneity means abstract attraction- that is, attraction as it would esist without repulsion. But the homogeneous always repel; hence, attraction involves repulsion. Now Hegel treats this law as a uni^Tersal principle of reason, and it is the one law on which he falls back for all his explanations. In this way, for example, he explains infinity. If we look upon the relation between " somewhat " and " other " as mere repulsion as heterogeneous, we get an endless progression a bas- tard infinity. But if we remember in this that the unltke always attract, we get the true infinity. The true infinite is not merely the opposition of the " somewhat " and " other," but the unity or attraction of them in their opposition-the unity of attraction and repulsion. In all this, we can readily see that Hegelis not proceed- ing from a logical source, but rather reading into the laws of logic the law of electric action. The so-called law of attraction and repulsion is not a universal law of reason as Hegel maintains; it is peculiar to the phenomena of electricity. Homogeneity is not absolute attraction nor is it like attraction; neitheris heterogeneity repulsion. Another consideration, closely connected with this, substantiates this view. Hegel's categories are all living, active things; they seem to be quickened with physical force. As Professor Seth says, they take upon themselves flesh and blood and actually walk into the air. Each finite category tnduces its opposite as positive induces negative electricity. Thus the heterogeneity in the "one and the many " is actual repulsion. " The one manifest# an utter incompatibility with self, a self-repulsion; and what it makes itself explicitly be is the many." So the opposition between " somewhat " and " other " is not merely logical distinction but real physical change; it is the real alteration or mutability of tie physical world:, etc., etc. Some explain this by saying that the chief characteristic l w allace's Hegelns Logic, p. 191. 2Wallace's Hegel's Logic, p. 149. 484 FRASER:</page><page sequence="14">EEGELISM. 485 of Hegel'# #y#tem is that it i# the unity of logic and meta hysics-a logic that i# at the #ame time a metaphy#ic and claim K# a# Cs the beauty ' of the #y#tem.

Cla., 1890).</page><page sequence="15">Another possible interpretation of Mr. Harris' view is this. The thought is pure from the first. The experience of the phenomena of magnetistn serves as the occasion for its first ilnperfect realiza- tion. The transition to the World-Spirit makes it at home svith itself and reveals it in its purity. The pure thought is the thought of "self-opposition. " But to this sve may answer: The principle of self-opposition is not a pure thought, it is only a postulate-an empirical postulate. It has been from the first a postulate of phys- ical science just as the atomic theory is a postulate of physical science; it is of greatvalue as a postulate just as the atomic theory is valuable, but as a real principle of pure thought orpure mag- netism, or pure anything else, it is as unintelligible as the infinitely infinite number of atoms which would be necessary to the constitu- tion of the physical world. Schelling's philosophy is based on the symbol of the magnet. But Hegel's principle is an advance over that of Schelling, and this, Mr. Harris from allother point of view attempts to show, is a step taken from the physical symbolto pure thoughts. Schelling's absolute corresponds to the " indiSerence point " of the magnet. Now this indifference point is wholly devoid of polarity, a mere indiference utterly indeterminate-a sort of zero or nothing. The one pole is mind and the other nature, and the absolute essence is the point of indifference, a substance that is neither mind nor matter. This absolute accordingly transcends not only matter, but also intelli- gence; it is a supreme unity utterly devoid of determination; it is, as Hegel says, no better than the night, in which all cows are black. Now Hegel's conception of the absolute is very different. Schel- ling laid all stress on the indifference point or identity of the two poles. Hegel conceives that this is important, but that it is not all; the polar opposition or difference is equally as important. Schel- ling's absolute cannot be called the creator, " for to create is to im- part substance and existence, and such impartation would be self- separation and not 'indifference,' butrather a polar diSerence of positive and negative, or active and passive within itself."l This emphasis of difference or polar opposition, then, is the advance made by Hegel. In this, however, he is not at all transcending the symbol of magnetism. He is only presenting a more com- plete view of magnetic phenomena. He grasps the magnet as a totality. The all-important aspect of it is not the indifference- point: the opposition of the poles is eqvlally important. These two phases of agency always stand together in the conception of the magnet as a totality, namely, the identity of the two poles in the in- difference point and their opposition at the poles themselves. Thus we have the supreme law of Hegelism: the unity of attraction and repulsion-the unity of identity and difference without the destruc- tion of either. The philosophy of Schelling is characteristically distinguished as the philosophy of identity. That of Hegel may be characterized as the philosophy of the syllogi#m. The #yllogism, hoxvever, taken "not as it was understood in the old formal logic, but at its real value," in which " it gives expression to the law that every particular thing is a middle term whichfuses together the estremes of the universal and the singular."l The conceptions of both philosophers are based on the conception of magnetism, and the difference between the conceptions is due to the difference in their views of the magnet. For Schelling the magnet was Identity, for Hegel it was the Syllo- gi8m. 2 l H.*rris' H*gel's Le ic, p. 71. 2 * allace's }Iegels togic, pp. 41, 42. 486 FRASER:</page><page sequence="16">Whatwe have accompEshed thus far is a consideration of the Hegelian principle as such. We have considered some of the most important points of the definition and illustration which are calcu- lated to give the most direct evidence as to the nature of that pe- culiar kind of relation which Hegel conceived to contribute the ra- tional essence of things. The New-Eegelians follow him in the gen- eral conclusion that the essential nature of the world consists in " relations." But this position is much more general and indefinite than that of the master. His a8 we have seen, is a Deculiar kind of relation. And from his deinitions, descriptions and illustrations of it, our only conclusion is that it is the relation of polarity as pre- sented in the physical phenomena of electricity. Let this suffice then, for direct evidence; we shall now consider some points of in- direct evidence. We shall consider briefly the principle in its ap- plication to the problems of philosophy, with a view to determining how far this psychological interpretation will account for some of the chief difflculties and short-comings of the Hegelian philosophy. Let us frst consider the dialectic as an evolution of thought. Is it a purely sympathetic process? or is it after all an empirical pro- cess? This is a dispute of long standing among the critics of EXegel. Trendelenburg and his followers maintain that the procedure of the evolution is not an original synthesis, butasort of empirical synthesis which is the result of a previous analysis or abstraction All the elements of thought#, according to this school of criti¢s, in their original form are intimately united in the concrete forms of experience. By abstraction these elements are violently held apart What is thus violated by abstraction, however, cannot but strive to escape from this forced position; it must strive to complete itself When this completion takes place there will arise a new concention which contains the former in itself. This new conception, again will repeat the process; and 80 the evolution will go on until the full reality and concreteness of perception have been restored Thus, for example " if Becoming is clear to us through perceptione there may easily te distinguished in it the moments of Being and Non-Being. Thus while day is dawning, we may say ' it is already day,' and also 'itis not day.' NVe separate and distinguish these moments in Becoming as actually observed, but without in the lec^st understanding logically the characteristic of real existence in virtue of which they are present together." 1 The motionless ideas of Pure Being and Pure Nothing could never of themselves give rise to the movement of Becoming unless the idea of becoming were presup- posed. The synthesis in the movement, then, is not a true synthe- sis; it i8 due to previous e2rperience; a retracing of our steps from the concrete to the abstract. Such is the view of the Trendelenburg school. But perhaps a larger number of critics maintain, on the oth- er hand, that the synthesis is a real one, pure, original. And indeed this view corresponds more faithfully with the profession of Eesl The open pretence of the dialectic is that it is an entirely presup position movement; a real evolution of one categors out of anoth- er. The criticism contained in the dialectic isnot the criticism of an external subjective reflection, but an immanent criticism of one category by another; the march of the object itself. And so the discussion goes on. There seems to be a good deal of truth on both sides of the question. From the purely philosophical standpoint the question is a source of real perplexity. Only one of these siews canbephilosophicallytrue; yet in the Eegelian systembothare clearly observable. Now how are we to account for this difEcultye 1 Trendelenlourg, " Logische Untersuchurgen," 1, 38. 487 HEGELISM.</page><page sequence="17">According to the psychological view for which we are contending there are two lines of thought which must run parallel throughout Hegel's system: first, there is the series of facts which he brings up for explanation, and secondly, the principle which he reads illto these facts. The real facts of thought-evolution which he observes and endeavors to explain, are the facts noted in the view of the Trendelenburg critics; the living synthesis impliedin ths attraction and repulsion of electric agency is the pure and original synthesis noted by the opposing school of critics That the real synthesis apparent in the Dialectic is just the con- ception of electric synthesis and nothing more is evident from many considerations. It is clearly implied in many facts we have already noted. We have already seen, for example that the categories are living things, expressing themselves in such forms as physical mu- tability, etc. And when a category brings about its opposite in the dialectic, it does so not by the power of a mere logical d?sttnction but it does so actually and really, as if by electric induction. Again whenHegel speales of the sciences of magnetism electricity and chemistry in the Naturphilosophie, what does he call them? " The dialectical sciences." He calls the principle of these sciences " dia- lectic." Hegel's descriptionsof the synthetic processarefullof such evidences. In all his descriptions of the synthesis one can see no description which will not apply to electrical phenomena. What then, are we to say? Our answer must be that, in 80 far as Eegei tells us what the synthetic principle is, we are to understand by it nothingmore than the principle of electricity. But the advocate for pure synthesis has one more chance. If he has failed to convince us by telling us what the principle z8, he may accomplish his project by showillg us what it does. If the principle is one of rational syn- thesis it must show itself as a source of real development it must actually develop into the various stages presented in the aialectic. If it can do this we must admit without further discussion that it is a real principle of reason above and beyond the descriptions of it which we have already observed. But call it do this? A careful observation of the procedure in the Logic will convince any unbiased observer that in this also it fails. The real advances made in the evolution all seem to be made possi- ble only by reference to experience; they belong to the kind of pso- cedure noted by the Trendelenburg critics. Synthetic process, it will be noticedZ is always at a standstill; it never develons into anything but 18 ever the same old process repeated over ana over again. ake, for example, the section of the evolution beginning at identity. Let us suppose that we understand the synthetic pro- cessbywhichidentity and differencs coalesce in the "ground." Now why does the evolutioll not stop here? What is the motor power that carries the process out of the ground? Let Hegel an- swer. " We must be careful, whell we say that the ground is the unity of identity and difference, not to understand an aMstract iden- tity. Otherwise we only change the name, while we still think the identity of understanding which has been already proved to be false. To avoid this misconception we may say the ground, be- sides being the unity, is also the difference of identity and dif- ference. The ground,which originally seemed to supersede and swallow up contradiction, thus presents to us a new contradic- tion.''l We see by this that the synthetic process which is to take place inthe nexttiwad after mediation of identity and difference in the ground, is gotten by a bald repetition of the old process; 488 X Wallace's Hegel's Logic, p. 193.  F}tASER:</page><page sequence="18">489 HEGELISM. the ground, which is a category taken from experience in order to be made synthetic, is apperceived as " the iElentity and di;fference of identity and difference." In this we can observe the true method of Hegel's artful procedure. The synthetic principle itself does not develop, but is always static, always the same; and the secret of its activity seems to be that it is repeatedly read into the development that really does take place, namely, the develop- ment due to empirical a6sociation. This is the method throughout the whole system. Hegel never tires of warning us that such phrases as " being and nothing are the same," or " the unity of being and nothing," and all other such unities, that of suleject and objectw and others, misrepresent the facts by giving an exclusive promi- nence to the unity, and leaving the difference which undoubtedly exists in it without any express mention or notice. The immediacy or unity expressed in the third category in each triad is thus only a farce as far as the synthetic evolution is concerned; what must be done in order to get a synthetic movement in each new triad is to re- peat the old process. Thus we observe that the so-called synthetic principle has nothing whatever to do with the real development; it does not develop at all, but is oaly repeated. Hegel, however, so artfully mises up this repeated synthesis with the steps of the real evolution, that it is very difficult to distinguish them. Hence the double aspect of the dialectic. The substance of our conclusion then, is this: The evolution of thought in so far as Hegel presents it as synthetic is an evolution that never advances a step, an evolu- tion which is nothing more than the repetition in each tried of the category of polarity; and the development which really does take place is the movement from abstractionto the concrete forms of experience. The real principle of developmentin the dialectic, then, is the psychological principle implied in the empirical facts brought up for explanation, and not the principle which Hegel endeavors to read into these facts. And this, we shall find, is the really valuable thing and centre of attraction throughout the whole system, name- ly the empirical facts observed, and not the interpretation given W7hat is, we ask, the great centre of attraction in the Hegelian Logic? Probably his treatment and application of the central cat- egories of identity and difference. Now what is 80 attractive in his discussion of these categories? Undoubtedly it is some great truth which lies hidden somewhere in his theory of the essential relativi- ty of thought. "All knowledge consists in relations," say the New- Hegelians. "The whole world is essentially made up of thought relations." This is the attractive point. But what is the great truth we find beneath this doctrine of " thought-relations? " It is that the laws of the relativity of thought are ultimately not logical laws at all, but physiological. This is a great fact proved beyolld reasonable doubt by experiment, namely, that the so-called " rela- tivity " is ultimately not the relativity of consciousness, but the rel- ativitv of sensations. And what makes Hegel's treatment of iden- tity and difference so attractive is that it contains within it a com- paratively accurate statement of the laws of discriminative sensi- bility. In my paper on Natural Realism I endeavored to show that the facts which the rea;lists aimed at expressing were the laws of tactual perception, and that inthese ultimate facts of tactile sen- sibility lay the attractive centre of their doctrine. So here the facts which Hegel is striving to express in this discussion are the physiological laws of discriminative sensibility, and in this lies the really valuable and attractive element of his doctrine. And so in the case of all the categories: the valuable and attractive thing i8</page><page sequence="19">490 FRASER: Ilot the interpretation given, but the statement of the facts them- selve,s. We have e2amined the principle as a principle of development- x1OW let us examine it as a principle of explanation. In this capaci ty also, we shall find that it does not vindicate its right to be called a principle of universal reason. We said before that the one con- ception which remains wholly uncriticised with Hegel is the con- ception of polarity. Now we shall sSnd that his uncritical applica- tion of this conception to the nature of reason is the chief source of his errors in philosophical explanation. The powerful opposition whicll moves the mrorld does not prove itself rational. Its insuffi- ciency as a rational principle presents itself in its root form in the highest stage of the dialectical opposition, the opposition between mind and nature. Nature is the " other " of mind--its special an- tithesis. NVe are told that nature is implicitly mind, and therefore eltimately rational. Let us admit that we are satisfied with this half of the interpretation. But there is the other half which is equally important. Nature is the "other" or special antithesis of mind, and in this respect it is irrational. Now how is this phase of natlare explained? Hegel occasionally calls it "illusion," but his more explicit statements of the doctrine clearly show that " illu- sion " does not at all express what he means. Alld indeed we can readily see the truth of this if we remember that "illusion" is a category which is applicable only to psychological phenomena and not to the nature of reason. The " other," according to Hegel's gen- nine doctrine, mus-t " have its scope; " it is a real, necessary thing in so far as it is " other," and must not be e2rplained away. It is, in short, a real and definite phase of reason. Now here is the difficul- ty. The " other " is a real, definite, extensive irrationality which we must not attempt to rationalize, and yet Hegel insists that it is ul- timately rational. This difficulty is not merely a little hole that can be picked in the system just at this point: it is a huge insufflciency that pervades all Hegelism, and can be observedin more or less e2c- plicit form in every stags of the dialectic. Let us look, for exam- ple, at the transition from teleology, which is the last stage of ob- jectivity, to the idea. The finitude of the end or aim in te]eology consists in the circumstance that, in the process of realizing it, the material which is employed as a means is only externally subsumed under it and made conformable to it. ihe transition to the idea is explained thus: "But, as a matter of fact, the object is the notion implicitly; and thus when the notion,in the shape of end or aimX is realized in the object, we have but the manifestation of the inner nature of the object itself. Objectivity is thus only a shell or cov- ering under which the notion lies concealed." Let us for a tilne ad- snit the " matter of fact" that the object is the notion implicitly: but what about the opposition which has just been annulled? This is the essential point to be explained and the only account we get of it at this time is that it is " a sheil or covering under which the notion lies concealed." We may understand what is meant by the shell or covering of an oyster or a chestnut, but the shell or cover- ing of reason is a metaphor which means nothing. But the curious thing about it all is that we are not supposed to understand the so- called " shell." It must have its scope as such, and the true expla- nation of it is that it is inexplicable. While the scope of objectivity is being emphasized, this is the view adhered to, but when the tran- sition to the idea is made, it is subtly abandoned, and the view of ultimate rationality is put in its place. The two views are never harmonized, but each is sacrificed to the other according as objec- tivity or the idea is emphasized.</page><page sequence="20">Take, as another illustrationX the doctrine of contingency. Though 4' the contingent is only one side of the actual," yet as such it " has no less than the rest of the forms of the idea, its due office in the world of objects." 4' On the surface of nature, so to speak, chance ranges unchecked, and that contingency must simply be recog- nized, without the pretension which is sometimes, but erroneously ascribed to philosophy, as seeking in it a necessary and rigidly fixed law. Noris contingency less visible in the world of mind. The willX as we have already remarked, involves contingency under the shape of option or free-choice, but involves it only as a vanishing and abrogated element. In respect of mind and its effects, just as in the case of nature, we must guard against being misled by a well meant endeavorl after rational knowledge, which would fain ex- hibit the necessity of phenomena which are marked by a decided contingency, and try, as the phrase is, to construe them aprzorz."l In this we see that chance ranges unchecked and must simply be recognized as such. The only e2rplanation that can be gistetl is simply to recognize that it exists in the world, and is in its essen- tial nature irrational and inexplicable. The contingent, however is only " one side of the actual." The other side is rational neces- sity and the side of contingency when reviewed in its union with this, Hegel conceives is some way or other brought into a rational system. But in whatever way we may conceive this to be done we must be careful not to explain away the fact of contingency; it still must have its scope. Now the only possible way on these condi- tions to bring contingency within a rational system is to " lump it " and tie it mechanically to reason. But this is a mere jumble of words and contradiction of terms. By contingencywe mean that we can give no rational account of why thines are as thev are and not otherwise. And to let contingency range unchecked without seeking in it rational knowledge, to leave it eternally as it is on the surface, and yet attempt to bring it within a rational system, amounts to saying that in the highest stage of reason we can have rational irrationalities. Thus the higher unity of reason in which Hegel harmonizes necessity and contingency is a reason in which anything may be anything else. The same transparellt fallacy may be again illustrated in the doc- trine of identity and diference. The " other " of the rational element in this case is " mere variety." Mere variety by itself is untenable, but as the " other " it must have " its scope." It is the most com- man thing in the whole world. " Usually we regard different things as unaffected by each other. Thus we say: I am a human being, and around me are air water, animals, and all sorts of things. Everything is thus put outside of every other."2 The other side of the doctrine is e2rpressed in the following statement that " the aim of philosophy is to banish indifference and to learn the necessity of things." But this aim of philosophy, according to Hegel's rendering of it, never reaches the inner fibres of the nature of variety-it only regards it e2rternally. It never accounts for the fact of variety. It does not e2rplain it, or even attempt to explain it: it rather regards it as a weak and unimportant thing and treats it with contempt. We might go on with illustrationsX but it seems unnecessary. The same fallacy appears in all the various forms which the central opposition between mind and nature assumes. Nature as the 4' un- aufgelosten Widerspruch " always remains a huge lump of matter, foreign to reason. Hegel seems to maintain that as such it is ines- Wallace's lIegel's LOGjG P. 228. 2Wallace's Hegels Logic p. 191, 491 EEGELISM.</page><page sequence="21">492 FRASER: plicable, and that the true way to explain it is to ignore it. He does give it a kind of e2rplanation, but not a philosophical e2rplana- tion. It is a sort of wholesale explanation, an e2rplanation which does not penetrate into the inner network of nature, but only gives it an esternal and mechanical connection in the rational system The fundamental insufficiency of this e2rplanation is very artfully concealed beneath the veil of the familiar category " immediacy." Immediacy serves as a great box into which he casts all the irration- alities of the world. He then closes up the bo2r, calls it a moment in rational conciousness, and declares that by so doing he has ra- tionalized all. But Hegelwill make one more attempt to overcome the difficulty. Ee will insist that the opposition between reason and nature is all the time within the bounds of reason. Thought overlaps nature the subjective overlaps the objective; the former is always wealthier than the latter. And by means of this overlapping of the rational the irrational is ultimately some way or other made rationalv Reason is itself essentially a triple movement, embracing within its necessary activity both the opposition between itself and nature and their ultimate unification. The two movements are only two phases of the one essential activity of reason. Now this view does for a moment seem to lift us out of the difficulty. It is undoubtedly very attractive, and on the surface quite satisfactory. But on closerp observation one will observe that such a doctrine holds good only when reason is regarded in the abstract. In all this talk about reason, we never bring into realization what we mean bv it. We are, in all probability, thinking of something which has in common with reason very little more than the name. We might, with equal intelligence, talk of anything going through the same movements for e2rample, electricity. We have seen already that when Hegei regards reason in its actuality this principle of triple tnovement is not applicable to it. He faiA to read this abstract triple move- ment in the manifestations of reason in the real world, such as sub- jectivity and objectivity, identity and variety, necessity and contin- gency. If we regard reason in the concrete and try to apply this abstract principle to it we shall find that we are necessarily led into oIle of two doctrines neither of which satisfies the end which Hegel claims to have accomplished. In the first place the application may mean that the opposition between mind and nature is ultimately wholly done away with, that in the ful]y realized idea it does not e2rist. But this would amount to a mere formal subjective type of idealism in which the whole value of objectivity would be llost, an idealism which would be ignored by Hegel. In the second place it may mean that the rigid- ity of the opposifion is always maintained; that it is an eternal necessity of reason. This is undoubtedly Hegel's meaning. But the opposition is at the same time harmonized. Now what must be the nature of that higher unity which makes this harmony possible ? It cannot be called reason-that is, the reason which is opposed to the irrational-for if that were the case the harmony of the opposi- tion could mean nothing else than its complete destruction. Nature, we must remember, is opposed to the absolute and complete nature of reason; it is its special antithesis: the opposition is be- tween rational and irrational. Consequently the one may conquer the other and thus bring about harmony, but in order to retain the opposition and yet become harmonized a third party is necessary in which they must receive this new relation. Thus, in this case, the principle of unity of the rational and irrational which Hegel still</page><page sequence="22">HEGELIBM. 493 calls reason, is in reality a principle which transcends both mind and nature a principle identical with the absolute of Schelling. qdhe Hegeian principle, then, whatever it may be, is clearly not an ultimate principle of reason. Reason bends under its power. Rationality and irrationality are alike moments in it. The opposition which it makes between mind and nature is an opposition which transcends rationalitys and any attempt to bring it within a rational system lands us either in subjective idealism or in a doctrine of blank identity. This is the case when mre keep reason before us as a concrete reality. Only when mre regard it in the abstract does the principle of triple movement seem applicable to it. Now homr can we account for all this ? What can the principle be ? Putting together all the facts we have noted, have we not good reason to conclude that it is just the principle of polarity as observed in elec- tric agency ? In electric phenomena alone do we seem to e2rperi- ence an opposition which is annulled and at the same time retained. Is not this the principle of movement which Hegel reads into the laws of reason when he regards it in the abstract, and which lands him in contradiction when he attempts to make it concrete ? The relation between mind and nature-what is it ? Is not nature the negative induced by the postttre, mind, and at the same time csttracted by it ? The powerful logical distinction which moves the world which is not merely a dtsttrtotzorb but a ltvt7wg power imma- nent in all physical movement-is it not electrical repulsion ? The ultimate unity of the opposition or the " return-into-self "-does it mean anything more than what we understand by electrical attrac- tion ? Will not this interpretation give us an insight into the Hege- lian philosophy which will clear away for us many of its perple2ri- ties, and account for its principal inadequacies ? We have traced briefly the influence of the discovery of galvan- ism onthe scientific thought of Hegel's time. We have seen how the conception of polarity tacitly worked itself into the network of the whole intellectual world and became the central apperceiving thought in nearly all scientific and philosophic peculation. We have seen how the world consequently fell apart into an infinity of polar antinomies. In Hegel's Logic we have seen that his definitions and descriptions of his fundamentel philosophic principle are nothing more than descriptions of the conception of polarity. We have considered this principle as a principle of development, and have found that, though it presents the appearance of a real syn- thetic movement, it plays no part in the real evolution of thought; that it remains the same throughout the evolution and is all through completely satisfied by the description of polarity. We have es:- amined it as a principle of solution in the problems of philosophy and have found that it does not prove itself a principle of universal reason; that in this respect also it proves itself to be nothing more than the principle of galvanism. Our natural conclusion, then, is this: The age in which Hegel lived compelled him to stand between two great worlds, each full of contradictions. Behind him was the logical world pregnant with the Kantian antinomies of reason: before him lay the physical world charged with the polarities of electricity. The latter being his world of es:perience, becomes a part of his life, and constitutes his apperceiving thought; and in the life of this world he reads the former. It is thus he lmites the two. This is his monism. This is his logic that is at the same time a metaphysic. What, then, is the value of Hegelism ? It is valuable in two re- spects. First, there is value in the facts which he so extensively and so accurately observes. And from this point of view there is 5</page><page sequence="23">494 iFRASER: value in many of his general conclusions, for example, the accept- ance, in a very general way, of anthropomorphism as the highest possible world conception, and the interpretation in the same gen- eral way, of thought as a development. In these i' generalities," as such, must consist the whole metaphysical value of the system; in Hegelns peculiar rendering of them, in the particular kind of an- thropomorphism or development on which he insists, there is none. So, after all, the metaphysical value of the system may be said to be in the aim rather than in the accomplishment; it is ideal rather than real. But, secondly, there is another value which i think is more important and which is specially brought out by this investigation. It is a psychological and pedagogical value. In his endeavor to make the so-called Illtimate principles of reason as es:hibited in the science of logic conform to his newly conceived principle Hegel necessarily freed thought from the fis:ed and apparentiy ultimate forms in which it had lain bound for centuries. In the successful application of his principle to logic there is in- volved a deep criticism of the nature of thought, which reveals the fact that the fis:ed conceptions and so-called ultimate principles of reason are merely finite forms of the " abstract understanding." In this spirit of radical criticism the most final forms of logical and mathematical science are set down as crystallizations of the empir- ical imagination: retaining, however, their due office as stages in the development of thought. In this criticism of the old forms and in the substitution of his own principle as the final form of thought, Hegel, no one can doubt, has met with wonderful success. Now what is the underlying possibility of this success? Hegel would have us believe that the secret of the whole matter is that he has discovered the one fundamental principle of reason. But our es:amination of the nature and application of this principle will not warrant this belief. The great truth revealed as a result of Hegel's successful treatment is not, as he professes, the posittre inflnity of thought, but rather its wonderful plasttctty. The truth of the free- dom of thought has been revealed, but not in the sense that the principle of freedom or positive infinity has been grasped. The work done by Hegel may be regarded as a great psychological es- periment, through which he brings to light what a wonderfully plastic thing thought is. And in this consists the great educational value of Hegelism. A thorough study of it brings into activity the latent plasticity of the mind, thus lifting it out of its old ruts and preJudices, and giving it in consequence a spirit of independence and freedom. If our main thesis is true, its value will be not so much its own truth as what it suggests. We are led to question that the funda- mental principle of the universe has yet been discovered. Has phil- osophy yet attained that universal standpoint which it claims as its own, or is it still only one of the great number of things that go to make up the sum of life ? The aim and spirit of philosophy, the aim which seeks to know the essential nature of things and gain a world-conception devoid of presupposition, we can safely endorse but are we sure that the methods used are the best for realizing that aim ? How far has the aim been accomplished ? As we look over the various systems, do we find them presuppositionless? There seems to be an imperfection in the philosophic method which leaves it satisfied with bringing to light some dominating presupposition of thought, without inquiring into its nature and history. It leaves it uncriticised and regards it as ultimate, when in truth it is far from being so. Thus what Hegel does is to bring into consciousness the central presupposition or apperceiving</page><page sequence="24">HEGELISM. 495 thoughts of his intellectual world: but he does not ask what it is. By psychological criticism, we found it to be the conception of elec- tric agency. In the history of galvanism it has its history. If, then, the imperfection of the philosophic method leaves it satisfied with revealing the presupposition, is it not the business of psychology to make good this imperfection by tellillg what it i8 ? Psychology will not take the place of philosophy, but it can criticise and correct its methods. The philosopher must be a psychologist. In the history of philosophy there are scores of categories which, one may safely conjecture, have a psychological history. There are " unities " and " higher unities " and " double-faced unities; " " subjectivity " and " objectivity " and " subject-objectivity; " " self " and " not-self " and" return-into-self," etc.,etc.; all undoubtedly significant and use- ful to a certain es:tent. But who can fully realize what is meant by them? Are they not all presuppositions awaiting psychological criticism ? Again, in the history of science, if the discovery of gal- vanism has furnished the psychological history of one system of philosophy, may we not find the histories of others in the develop- ment of gravitation, wave-motion, and other epoch-making discov- eries ? Is there not a great work suggested here a work that may be of inestimable value to both psychology and philosophy ? What new relation it may reveal between these two departments of knowledge, and what benefits may accrue to both, will be seen only when the work is done. But the foretaste of the reslllts is sufficient to warrant the investigation. Philosophy would at least be made conscious of itsprejudices and delusive metaphors, and thus be equipped for a revolutionary advance to a higher standpoint. Psychology may find in the history of philosophy Psychological phenomena in the widest bearings and most highty developed stages; as well as obtain the results of naturally-performed experi- ments which are unattainable in the laboratory. I have much pleasure in expressing my indebtedness to President Hall for first suggesting that I should investigate the discovery of galvanism, with a view to finding the psychological basis of Hegel- ism; and also for valuable direction in the investigation.</page></plain_text>
