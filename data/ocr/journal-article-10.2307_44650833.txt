Davis Transport Canada Copyright Â© 2000 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc. ABSTRACT This paper provides details on the tests performed and the research findings of an underride guard test programme, including 10 full scale crashes using three types of deformatile guards. The deformatile guards tested included one meeting the minimum requirements of the NHTSA FMVSS 223 with ground clearances of either 560 or 480 mm, a second meeting the same minimum performance criteria with the addition of a device to limit the displacement of the horizontal member (ground clearance of 480 mm only) and a third being stiffer and designed to roughly maintain its 560 mm ground clearance during deformation. Crash tests were performed at speeds of 48, 56 and 65 kph. The tests showed that an underride guard built to the minimum requirements currently specified in FMVSS 223, could not provide adequate protection to occupants in a compact or sub-compact vehicle; in our tests, such a guard failed to stop a 1998 Honda Civic CX striking the guard at 56 km/h, resulting in the failure of the neck of the ATD sitting in the driver and front passenger positions. The tests also showed that lowering the guard height, increasing the guard stiffness, or limiting the guard's displacement, will improve protection to the occupants of the colliding vehicle and reduce the risk of passenger compartment intrusion. INTRODUCTION Rear underride occurs when a relatively small vehicle, such as a passenger car, collides with the rear of a much larger and heavier vehicle, and the front of the smaller vehicle slides under the rear of the larger vehicle. In the worst-case crashes, the smaller vehicle underrides the large vehicle sufficiently that the large vehicle's rear extremity enters the passenger compartment of the small vehicle. This effect, referred to as "passenger compartment intrusion" (PCI), frequently results in fatalities. Attempts to deal with the problem of rear underride date back to the early 1950s. The initial efforts resulted in the "Rear End Protection" regulation being established by the Bureau of Motor Carrier Safety (BMCS) of the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1953. This regulation required trucks and trailers manufactured for interstate commerce to have a rear impact guard designed to help prevent underride. To meet the BMCS requirements, the guard must have a maximum unloaded ground clearance of 30 inches, be located within 24 inches forward of the extreme rear of the vehicle and within 18 inches inboard from either side. Due to the continuing fatalities and serious injuries in accidents involving underride, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) continued its research into improving underride protection for passenger car occupants. This research and the ensuing consultations resulted in the introduction of two new Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, FMVSS 223, "Rear Impact Guards" [7]1 and FMVSS 224, "Rear Impact Protection" [8]. Together, these two regulations require that most trailers over 4536-kg GVWR, which are constructed after January 26, 1998, have a rear impact guard meeting minimum dimensional and strength requirements. These NHTSA requirements are similar to those specified by the Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) in regulation number 58, published in 1989. The ECE unloaded guard height requirement of 550 mm is only 10 mm lower than that required by FMVSS 224. Both sets of regulations require that the horizontal impact bar be a minimum of 100 mm in vertical height and extend to within 100 mm of the sides of the trailer. The ECE regulation also requires that the ground clearance be a maximum of 600 mm and the rear set-back be a maximum of 400 mm. when the test load is applied. The U.S. regulation includes an energy absorption test not required in ECE 58 [10]. Fortunately, collisions with underride are relatively 1 Numbers in square brackets denote references at the end of the paper. 918</page><page sequence="2">uncommon events in Canada. An analysis of the Canadian collision statistics indicates that there are an average of 15 to 20 fatalities annually resulting from passenger vehicles striking the rear of a trailer. Statistics also indicate that about 60% of the fatal collisions occurred during full or partial darkness and that between 80 to 90% of the fatal collisions occur when the posted speed limit was 80 kph or higher. The data also show that while there are approximately 300 injuries a year as a result of rear-end collisions with tractor-trailer combinations, there are few maior injuries. For example, in 1 995 there were only 1 1 rear-end collisions involving a total of 16 people who were admitted to hospital. These data appear to confirm the conclusion that underride accident are usually surprise events that occurs at high speeds. This would suggest that the drivers of the passenger vehicles do not expect to find a large vehicle stopped or moving slowly in their path, and that they have insufficient time to avoid the collision. Single unit trucks would be excluded from this regulatory initiative as they are rarely involved in fatal underride collisions. Statistical analysis of the Canadian Traffic Accident Information Database (TRAID) indicates that, between 1992 and 1996, single unit trucks were involved in an estimated average of four fatal rear impact collisions per year. These data are similar to the NHTSA data [2], indicating that single unit trucks are involved in only 25% to 30% of the combined total of trailer and unit truck fatal rear impact collisions. In addition to their lower involvement rate, many single unit trucks are equipped with rear hydraulic lift platforms. These lift platforms would either exempt the trucks from a guard requirement or would significantly increase the cost of installing a guard. Canada currently does not have a federal requirement for rear impact guards, with the exception of some tanker trailers. Tanker trailers designed to transport dangerous goods must meet the requirements of Canadian Standards Association (CSA) B-620-1998 [6] "Highway Tanks and Portable Tanks for the Transportation of Dangerous Goods". It should be noted that, In the case of these tanker trailers, the rear impact protection is essentially designed for the protection of the tank valves rather than for the protection of the occupants in the colliding vehicle. Even though there is no specific Canadian federal regulation requiring rear impact guards on trailers, many Canadian manufacturers install a guard complying with the FMVSS requirements. To meet the U.S. Federal Highway Administration requirements Canadian trailers, built on or after 26 January 1998 and operating in the U.S., must be fitted with an FMVSS 223 rear impact guard. In addition, several Canadian provinces have introduced legislation requiring rear impact protection on trailers under their jurisdiction. Some provinces have addressed their legislation to a particular segment of the trailer fleet, especially the 53-foot trailers and the longer tractor-trailer combinations. For these reasons, all of the research and development work on rear underride has been focused on developing a guard which can meet the NHTSA FMVSS 223/224 requirements in addition to any new Canadian requirements. The purpose of this paper is to report on the design and development of the rear underride guards used in the crash testing programme and to provide the results of the crash tests. This crash test programme was completed to determine the need for a Canadian regulation and to determine what performance the regulation should require. UNDERRIDE GUARDS Three guard designs were used in this programme; a minimally compliant guard, a minimally compliant guard which included a stopper device to limit the vertical displacement of the horizontal member, and a stronger guard which was designed to rotate through an arc, thus having an initial and final ground clearance of 560 mm. The minimally compliant guard was tested at both 480 and 560 mm ground clearance heights, while the displacement limiting guard was mounted at 480 mm in all tests. Each of these guards was positioned on the test structure so that the face of the horizontal member was approximately 300 mm in front of the structure's rearmost surface. This installation represents the worst case placement of the rear underride guard as it allowed the vehicle to travel 300 mm under the structure before contacting the guard. The 300 mm forward placement corresponds to the worst case placement allowed in FMVSS 224. MINIMALLY COMPLIANT GUARD (MCG) - The MCG was based on a concept developed by the Centre for Surface Transportation Technology of the National Research Council of Canada (NRC/CSTT) for the Canadian Transportation Equipment Association (CTEA) [11], As the goal of this test programme was to use a minimally compliant guard, the CTEA guard had to be weakened so that it would conform minimally with the strength requirement specified in FMVSS 223. While the guard was designed to meet only the minimum strength and energy absorption requirements of FMVSS 223, it was approximately 20% stronger and 120% more energy absorbent than that required by FMVSS 223. The guard design chosen by the NRC/CSTT was such that the top part of the guard was rigid and did not deform while the bottom part was weaker, thus easily able to deform under load and absorb energy through plastic deformation. This guard design resulted in it performing well for larger vehicles where there was interaction with the upper rigid section of the guard. Two different MCG ground clearances were used in the 919</page><page sequence="3">test programme, 480 mm and 560 mm. The guards were identical with the exception that the vertical supports and back braces were longer for the 480 mm guard, thus the distance between the top of the horizontal member and the point at which the back brace connects to the support was identical in the two guards. The 480 mm MCG was not tested according to the FMVSS 223 Laboratory Test Procedure [9] but one would expect the two guards to offer the same resistance within normal experimental and manufacturing tolerances. DISPLACEMENT LIMITING GUARD (DLG) - The initial testing programme showed that the 480 mm MCG was not capable of preventing PCI in the Honda Civic at 48 kph nor in the Cavalier at 65 kph; thus it was concluded that the travel of the horizontal guard member had to be limited. This was accomplished by modifying a 480 mm MCG to include a very rigid piece of steel mounted vertically to limit the travel of the horizontal member (Figure 1). The stopper was sized and positioned so that the horizontal member would contact it once it had raised 70 to 80 mm through rotation. This modification was performed mainly to investigate the effect of limiting the vertical displacement of a 480 mm guard, especially in crashes involving either very low vehicles or higher crash speeds. This concept of a stopper could not be adapted to the 560 mm MCG since its ground clearance was too high. Figure 1. Detail of stopper on DLG STRONGER SLANTED GUARD (SSG) - While a DLG was capable of successfully stopping the Cavalier at 65 kph and the Honda Civic at 56 kph, there was a desire to have a guard which could be mounted at 560 mm and also one which was more user friendly. It was suggested that the stopper on the DLG would be in the way during routine vehicle maintenance and, as it could easily be removed, any proposed benefits would be lost. The SSG was designed with the aid of the NRC/CSTT, CTEA and Manac Industries. This guard offers significant strength advantages over the MCG and its design also allows it to be installed with an initial ground clearance of 560 mm, thus avoiding operational difficulties associated with the use of a guard with a ground clearance lower than 560 mm. The SSG was a modification of the original CTEA design. The original design was not weakened (as was done for the MCG guard) but, instead, the vertical supports were slanted towards the rear of the trailer and elongated so that the horizontal barrier still had a ground clearance of 560 mm when undeformed. In addition to being much stiffer than the other three guards tested, this design has the advantage of maintaining a quasi-constant ground clearance of 560 mm for the first 125 mm of displacement of the horizontal member. Figure 2 shows this guard in its pre-test condition. Figure 2. Close-up of SSG GUARD STRENGTH AND ENERGY ABSORPTION TESTS - These tests were performed at the NRC/CSTT in Ottawa; for logistical reasons, these tests could only be performed after all the crash tests had already been completed. All three guard designs were tested. A 560 mm MCG was tested in accordance with the P3 test of the Laboratory Test Procedure for FMVSS 223. Both the DLG and the SSG were tested in accordance with the newly developed, full width uniform test as specified below. MCG P3 Test - The P3 test consisted of a hydraulic ram pushing on the horizontal member of the underride guard, directly under one of its vertical supports; the force was exerted through a 203 mm by 203 mm, 25 mm thick 140 T 100- -J Ã® "" * ! / * - . .

Test Result - FMVSS 223 P3 test on 560 mm MCG 920</page><page sequence="4">square plate. The ram was displaced over a distance of approximately 125 mm and then retracted until it was no longer in contact with the underride guard. To meet the requirement of a FMVSS 223 P3 test, a guard must be able to withstand 100 kN of force before it is displaced by 125 mm; in addition, it must absorb 5.65 kJ of energy over the entire test. Figure 3 shows the test results for this guard; the guard withstood a maximum of 120.9 kN and absorbed 12.1 kJ. The ram travel speed was approximately 0.85 mm/s. Full Width Test Procedure - A full width test is a modification of the P3 test. In this test, the load is applied uniformly across the full width of the horizontal member of the underride guard. A 203 mm by 203 mm H-Beam was used for the tests. To ensure that the face of the H-Beam would remain vertical throughout the test, a four-bar linkage system was used. The hydraulic ram exerted a load at the centre of the H-Beam through the same 203 mm by 203 mm square plate used for the P3 test. One should note that the use of a four-bar linkage results in a vertical motion of the H-Beam as the system rotates around its pivot points. To minimise this vertical motion, the pivot points were positioned so that, at the initiation of the test, the bottom pivot points were offset by 63.5 mm from the top pivot points (see Figure 4), as a result, the H-Beam drops by 5.1 mm during the first 63.5 mm of ram travel, and rises by 5.1 mm for the next 63.5 mm of ram travel. Figure 4. Close-up of H-Beam for applying load in full-width test on SSG DLG Full Width Test - The DLG testing was completed in two segments. In the first segment, the load was applied until the ram had displaced by 125 mm and then the load was removed. The maximum load applied was 170.6 kN. In the second segment, the load was re-applied and ram loading increased until the safety limits on the test rig were reached. The maximum load reached 294 kN (the stopper was still intact under this load but the plate supporting the guard was buckling, and vertical loads of the order of 37 kN were being induced on the ram load cells thus the test was ended). Energy absorption was computed only for the first push; the guard absorbed 13.7 kJ. The hydraulic ram speed was approximately 0.8 mm/s. SSG Full Width Test - The 560 mm slanted guard was tested according to the full width test procedure as noted above. Very early in the test (after a ram displacement of only 32 mm and 84 seconds of testing), there was a failure of the ram displacement transducer. The magnet holding the string potentiometer on the ram fell off. Because the guard had already started to deform and as there was only one such guard available for testing, a decision was made to continue the testing and to attempt to reconstruct the ram displacement from other sensors available. An attempt was made to follow the test procedure (i.e., displace the ram by 125 mm) but, with a failed distance transducer and little reference to the original ram position, it was difficult to ascertain when this 125 mm distance had been reached. Once the ram had travelled what appeared to be the required distance, it was retracted until it was no longer in contact with the underride guard. At that time, the transducer was reconnected to the ram (but not re-calibrated), and the guard was loaded until it failed. The maximum load applied was 286.8 kN (see Figure 5), with a ram displacement of 17.2 mm. The hydraulic ram speed was approximately 0.67 mm/s, slightly slower than the P3 test; this was computed by performing a linear regression on the reconstructed ram displacement-time data. Energy absorption was computed only for the first push. 300 1 3-1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 j ' Ram Displacement 250 T ' - Transducer Failure K 100 "A 1 1 i |^otajiÂ¿nerg^Absor^^ 50 -i ! 0 d- i 0 20 40 60 80 1 00 1 20 140 1 60 Ram Displacement [mm] Figure 5.

Table 1 shows some of the characteristics of each of the test vehicles. Each vehicle class represented provided a specific challenge for the various underride guards being tested. FORD WINDSTAR - The Windstar, at over 1900 kg, was the heaviest vehicle used in the test programme. Good engagement of the guard by the vehicle structure, engine and suspension posts was expected because of its height. Its hood, however, is quite short compared to conventional automobiles and there was some concern over the distance needed to stop the vehicle. CHEVROLET CAVALIER - The Cavalier approximates the "average vehicle" both in size and weight, and plans called for this vehicle to be tested at speeds as high as 65 km/h, thus providing Transport Canada with good information about the performance of various underride guards at higher speeds. HONDA CIVIC - The Civic was the lightest of the three vehicles tested and would therefore not represent a challenge to the structure of the underride guard, even at higher speeds (when compared to the Cavalier, for example). The specific challenge with this vehicle is the low height of the vehicle structure; the concern was that the deformation of the underride guard might hinder its capacity to slow the vehicle down. TEST MATRIX - Table 1 shows the main test parameters for the 10 tests performed; tests 8, 9 and 10 (shaded) were performed with Anthropomorphic Test Devices (ATDs). It is worthwhile to note that the Cavalier was not tested with the 560 mm MCG at 65 km/h; the original test matrix was changed after Test Number 4 when it became evident that a minimally-compliant guard could not stop the vehicle at such a high velocity. Similarly, the Civic 2 Vehicle registration data were used instead of vehicle sale since Road Safety does not currently have detailed (i.e. by Make and Model) annual sale data. was not tested with the 560 mm MCG given the results of Test Number 6. VEHICLE PREPARATION - Vehicle preparation included the adjustment of the suspension to simulate heavy braking, instrumentation of the test vehicles and positioning of the ATDs (tests 8 to 10 only) as well as vehicle weighing and measurements. Brake Test - Brake tests were performed on one vehicle of each model to determine its attitude3 during heavy braking from 100 km/h. During vehicle preparation, the vehicle suspension was adjusted (see Table 2) to replicate this condition. Table 2. Adjustment of suspension for crash tests Vehicle Front Rear Cavalier -5.4 cm + 5.4 cm Civic -6.3 cm + 4.9 cm Windstar -6.1 cm + 5.8 cm Barrier and Crash Area - A structure was used to simulate the rear of a trailer and to support the test rear underride guards. To facilitate the installation and removal of the rear underride guard, 19 mm mating plates were welded to the two 6-inch l-Beams running longitudinally along the structure; this plate was drilled with holes matching the flanges on the underride guard. The ground clearance under the mating plate was 1105 mm. Metal shims were used to ensure that the underride guard was horizontal and to provide the required ground clearance. Instrumentation - Vehicle instrumentation consisted of three, 3-axis accelerometers. Two accelerometers were mounted directly behind each of the front seats beside 3 The attitude is the angle that the longitudinal axis of a vehicle makes with the road surface; during heavy braking, the front of a vehicle will drop and its rear will rise. 922</page><page sequence="6">the B-pillar while a third accelerometer was located on the centreline of the vehicle near the longitudinal location of the centre of gravity. A tape switch on the hood/bumper of the vehicle was used to capture the instant of first contact and a wire on each air bag cover was used to capture the instant at which they deployed. The vehicle crash speed was measured by an external speed trap. ATDs were used in the last three tests (tests 8, 9 and 10). The ATD in the driver position was a Â£r percentile female Hybrid III while the ATD in the passenger position was a 50^ percentile male Hybrid III. CRASH TESTS WITHOUT ATDS - The first series of crash tests were performed to verify the performance of the underride guard and to measure vehicle deceleration and the amount of underride with various underride guards. ATDs were not used due to the potential for damage to them. Table 3 shows the main test results for these 7 tests. Tests which resulted in passenger compartment intrusion have been shaded for emphasis. Table 3.

Since the Cavalier and the Civic were tested with guards at 480 and 560 mm ground clearance, it is necessary to correct the displacement after first contact (obtained by integrating twice the accelerometer data from the two accelerometers positioned behind the seats and averaging) by adding the distance from the face of the bumper to the point of first contact. Ford Windstar - The 560 mm MCG provided good protection to the passenger compartment of the Windstar and there was very little damage inside the passenger compartment. The driver and passenger-side air bags deployed 22.7 and 26.3 ms respectively after the initial contact with the guard. The vehicle decelerated to a stop in 178 ms. This test demonstrated that this design of a minimally-complying guard could offer good protection to occupants of a minivan in a collision at 48 km/h. Figure 6 shows the Windstar in the post-test condition. Figure 6. Ford Windstar, 560 mm MCG, 48 km/h Chevrolet Cavalier - A total of four tests were performed with this vehicle; two tests were performed at 48 km/h and two others at 65 km/h. 560 mm MCG, 48 km/h - The 560 mm MCG did not provide good protection to the passenger compartment; the guard contacted and deformed the A-pillar on the drivers-side. The test structure came in contact with the top of the windshield (see Figures 6 and 7). Also, the steering wheel was displaced downward, pinching the lead bags used as weight between its rim and the seat. The driver and passenger-side air bags deployed 36.6 and 35.6 ms respectively after the initial contact with the guard. The vehicle decelerated to a stop in 238 ms. Figure 7.

Detail of damage to A-pillar, Chevrolet Cavalier, 560 mm MCG, 48 km/h 480 mm MCG, 48 km/h - The 480 mm MCG provided good protection to the passenger compartment. There was no contact between the windshield and the structure and there was no damage inside the passenger compartment. The driver and passenger-side air bag deployed 35.5 and 33.8 ms respectively after the initial contact with the guard. The vehicle decelerated to a stop in 212 ms. This test showed that a minimally-complying guard with a reduced ground clearance to 480 mm could provide good protection to occupants of compact vehicles in a collision at 48 km/h. 480 mm MCG, 65 km/h - The 480 mm MCG did not provide good protection to the passenger compartment of the Cavalier in the test at 65 km/h. The vehicle came to rest only after undergoing severe intrusion and extensive deformation of the A pillars (see Figures 8 and 9). Both the driver and passenger air bags deployed 27.7 ms after the initial contact with the guard, but this would have been of little help to front seat occupants, given the extensive amount of intrusion in the passenger compartment. The vehicle decelerated to a stop in 247 ms. Figure 9. Chevrolet Cavalier, 480 mm MCG, 65 km/h Figure 10. Details of damage to A-Pillar, Chevrolet Cavalier, 480 mm MCG, 65 km/h 480 mm DLG, 65 km/h - For this test only, a 25 mm solid square rod was welded behind each of the stoppers, between the stopper itself and the concrete barrier at the rear. This was done to prevent any movement of the stopper during the crash. The 480 mm DLG provided much better protection to the passenger compartment of the Chevrolet Cavalier than the 480 mm guard did; there was no contact between the structure and the vehicle or windshield. Some damage was evident inside the passenger compartment on the driver side, but none on the passenger side. The driver and passenger-side air bag deployed 28.7 and 28.2 ms respectively after the initial contact with the guard. The vehicle was decelerated to a stop in 113 ms. Honda Civic - A total of two tests were performed with this vehicle; the two tests were performed at 48 km/h. 480 mm MCG - The 480 mm MCG did not provide good protection to the passenger compartment of the Honda Civic. This was in large part due to the frame of the vehicle sliding under the horizontal member of the guard. By the time the horizontal member of the guard was contacted by the engine, it had rotated such that it struck the top of the intake manifold. The horizontal member then skipped over the engine, contacted slightly the suspension posts and came to rest by deforming the A-pillar. The driver-side and passenger-side windows shattered, as did a large portion of the windshield. The base of the windshield was pushed inside the passenger compartment. The driver-side air bag deployed 37.7 ms after initial contact (there is no air bag on the passenger side). The vehicle was decelerated to a stop in 222 ms. 480 mm DLG - The square rods were not used in this test, because of the reduced velocity and weight of the Civic compared to those of the Cavalier. The 480 mm DLG provided good protection to the passenger compartment; there were no contact between the structure and the vehicle or windshield. There were no visible damage inside the passenger compartment, except for the cracked windshield (caused by the hood folding during the crash). The driver-side air bag deployed 924</page><page sequence="8">42.3 ms after the initial contact with the guard. The vehicle was decelerated to a stop in 182 ms. CRASH TESTS WITH ATDS - Three tests were performed with ATDs, all using the Honda Civic as the test vehicle. The guards tested were the 560 mm MCG, the 480 mm DLG and the 560 mm SSG. Two ATDs were used in each of the test. A Ã¡h percentile female Hybrid III was used in the driver seat; the driver seat was positioned to the most forward position. A 50th percentile male Hybrid III was used in the front passenger seat; the front passenger seat was positioned in the mid-position. Table 4 shows the main test results for these three tests.

The Civic was travelling at approximately 40 km/h when its roof struck the rearmost surface of the barrier and at approximately 22 km/h when it struck the concrete barrier. This barrier is located approximately 2.4 m from the rearmost surface of the structure and the total displacement at that time would have been approximately 2.25 m. The driver-side air bag deployed 37.6 ms after the initial contact with the guard. The maximum vehicle deceleration was 17.5 G, excluding the deceleration due to the collision with the concrete barrier. The post-test ground clearance of the guard was 660 mm. The necks of both ATDs were damaged beyond repairs. Damage to the passenger compartment was severe; the roof was pushed down by the underside of the structure (see Figures 10 and 11). Figure 11. Honda Civic, 560 MCG, 56 km/h Figure 12. Front View, Honda Civic, 560 MCG, 56 km/h 480 mm DLG, 56 km/h - The 480 mm DLG provided good protection to the passenger compartment. There was little or no contact between the structure and the vehicle or windshield (see Figure 13). There was no visible damage to the passenger compartment. The driver-side air bag deployed 42.5 ms after the initial contact with the guard. The vehicle was decelerated to a stop in 183 ms. The post-test ground clearance of the guard was 555 mm. Figure 13. Honda Civic, 480 mm DLG, 56 km/h 560 mm SSG. 48 km/h - The test with the 560 mm SSG was performed at 48 km/h since no previous quasi-static or dynamic testing had been performed with this guard; the guard designer originally believed that the guard could withstand 320 kN but, when tested in the full-width test, it could only withstand 287 kN. The 560 mm SSG provided good protection to the passenger compartment; there were no contact between the structure and the vehicle or windshield (see Figure 14). There was no visible damage to the passenger compartment. The driver-side air bag deployed 40.1 ms after the initial contact with the guard. The vehicle was decelerated to a stop in 193 ms. The post-test ground clearance of the guard was 600 mm. Close examination of the guard after the test revealed that it had moved more than the expected 125 mm in the longitudinal direction. Also, the guard had rotated such that it was now resting on the vehicle structure; it is doubtful that this guard could have provided acceptable 925</page><page sequence="9">passenger compartment protection at a speed of 56 km/h (36% more kinetic energy at the beginning of the crash). Figure 14. Honda Civic, 560 mm SSG, 48 km/h ATP Results - Various criteria were used to determine the potential for serious injury; specifically, various data were compared to the suggested Injury Assessment Reference Value (IARV) for the two ATDs. The results obtained in the crash tests were transformed as indices and are tabulated in Table 5 for the three crashes. Indices higher than one indicate a high potential of severe injury; these cells have been shaded for visibility. As can be seen on Table 5, the only guard producing indices greater than 1 is the 560 mm MCG; as previously noted, this underride guard could not stop the vehicle and severe compartment intrusion occurred. It is also worth noting that the Tibia Index-Lower for the driver position of the test performed with the 480 mm DLG is close to one. In investigating this further, it was found that the value of 0.95 is for the left tibia (the tibia index for the right tibia-lower was 0.39); this 0.95 value occurs at 81.3 ms into the crash and its major contributor is My (My = -105.0 N-m, Mx = 2.2 N-m and Fz = 0.72 kN). All other indices for this test, as well as all indices for the test involving the SSG, are lower than 0.7. This indicates low probability of serious injuries for these two crashes (480 mm DLG and 560 mm SSG). DISCUSSION GUARD TEST -Test results on the 480 mm DLG showed that the FMVSS Laboratory P3 test results could not be directly compared to those obtained in the full-width test (i.e., the full-width test does not result in loads twice as large as in the P3 test). The 480 mm DLG (which is essentially identical to the 560 mm guard for this type of test) offered a resistance of 171 kN while the maximum load in the P3 test was 121 kN, thus, the full width test resulted in a maximum load of only 1.4 times the load obtained in the P3 test, (see Figure 15) It should be noted that the two test curves are not parallel, although their shape has similarities. The main reason for this behaviour appears to be the contribution of the "untested" vertical support in the P3 test. If the horizontal Table 5.

Test Results, Full-width test on 480 mm DLG and FMVSS 223 P3 test on 560 mm MCG member is stiff enough, it will load the vertical support which is not being tested. This effect can be seen in Figure 16 where the ram pushed on the post which is in the foreground; the horizontal member is so stiff that the untested support (in the background) was also deformed plastically. The load in the P3 test can exceed that of the full-width test (for the same ram displacement) if the untested support resistance is large enough (there is a twisting effect). This, of course, does not occur in a full- width test, due to the uniform loading of the underride guard along the entire length of the horizontal member. Figure 16. Close-up, 560 mm MCG in FMVSS 223 P3 test UNDERRIDE GUARD PERFORMANCE - This section provides a review of the performance of various underride guards tested for each of the three categories of vehicles tested. Light-Truck and Vans - As previously noted, the Ford Windstar was only tested against the 560 mm MCG. This guard worked well against this size of vehicle as the vehicle is large enough that rotation of the underride guard around its supports does not impair its ability to slow the vehicle down and stop it prior to passenger compartment intrusion. The Windstar was only tested at 48 km/h; it is likely that vehicle Total Displacement would have increased if it had been tested at 56 km/h. At higher speeds, PCI may have occurred. Compact Automobiles - This vehicle category was represented by the Chevrolet Cavalier. Tests were performed with the 560 mm MCG (48 km/h), with the 480 mm MCG (48 and 65 km/h) and the 480 mm DLG (65 km/h). The test results showed that: â¢ the 560 mm guard could not stop the vehicle in time to prevent PCI and therefore did not provide acceptable protection to the occupant compartment; â¢ the 480 mm guard offered adequate passenger compartment protection for the crash at 48 km/h but could not prevent severe PCI at 65 km/h. â¢ the 480 mm guard prevented PCI at 65 km/h, at the expense of high decelerations (30 G). Referring to Table 3, we note that the total displacement for the test with the 480 mm DLG at 65 km/h is of the same magnitude as that obtained in the test with the 480 mm MCG at 48 km/h. This example showed the importance of either having a low enough guard that will maintain contact with the structure of the vehicle during the collision, or of having some external means of limiting the vertical displacement of the underride guard as it rotates around its pivot points. It also showed that the strength requirement specified in FMVSS 223 is not sufficient to stop a compact automobile colliding at 48 km/h before PCI occurs. Sub-Compact Automobiles - This vehicle category was represented by the Honda Civic. A total of 5 tests were performed on this vehicle since it was found that this vehicle was the greatest challenge for the underride guard to stop before PCI occurred. Three of these tests were performed with fully instrumented ATDs in the vehicle; tests were performed both at 48 and 56 km/h on underride guards with ground clearances of both 480 and 560 mm. The test results show that: â¢ The 560 mm MCG could not stop the vehicle; it crashed into the concrete barrier supporting the trailer mock-up structure at approximately 22 km/h; â¢ The 480 mm MCG could not offer adequate protection for the crash at 48 km/h; PCI did occur. Video of the crash shows the vehicle frame sliding under the horizontal member of the underride guard, causing it to rotate around its pivot point; â¢ The 480 mm DLG provided good passenger compartment protection at both 48 and 56 km/h; in the 56 km/h test, a tibia index (lower left) of 0.95 was recorded. All other ATD responses for this crash were well below the threshold levels for severe injury; â¢ The 560 mm SSG provided good protection to the passenger compartment at 48 km/h; a test was not performed at 56 km/h. ATD responses for this crash 927</page><page sequence="11">were well below the threshold levels for severe injury. The test result of this crash show that it is possible to protect the occupants of a sub-compact vehicle if the guard is stiff enough and strong enough. â¢ The 560 mm SSG could withstand 287 kN with a ram travel of approximately 18 mm in a full-width test; in the same test, the 480 mm DLG (which is also equivalent to the 560 mm MCG) only resisted 171 kN with a ram travel of 10 mm. CONCLUSION The testing programme yielded the following conclusions: 1. The current Laboratory Test Procedure for FMVSS 223 does not permit the estimation of the total load that can be withstood by the whole guard. The guard design greatly influences the relationship between the resistance to a push on one support and that obtained in a full-width test. If the horizontal member is very stiff, the second support will contribute to the resistance of the tested support in a P3 test. 2. The minimally compliant guard mounted at 560 mm provided good protection to the passenger compartment of the Windstar at 48 km/h but could not provide good protection to the passenger compartment of the Cavalier at 48 km/h. This guard was not tested on a Civic at 48 km/h, but was tested at 56 km/h. The MCG was not capable of stopping the Civic without extensive PCI. The necks of the two ATDs used in that test were damaged beyond repair and had to be replaced; several of the ATD responses were greater than the suggested IARV threshold for severe injury, implying that both occupants would have been severely injured or killed. 3. The minimally compliant guard mounted at 480 mm ground clearance provided good protection to the passenger compartment of the Cavalier at 48 km/h but was not able to prevent PCI for the Civic at 48 km/h. Also, this guard was not able to prevent PCI for the Cavalier at 65 km/h. 4. The 480 mm guard with the displacement limiting stopper provided good protection to the passenger compartment of the Cavalier at 65 km/h, and to the Civic at 48 and 56 km/h. In the Civic test at 56 km/h, the tibia index (lower left) Increased to 0.95. 5. The 560 mm stronger slanted guard provided good protection to the passenger compartment of the Civic at 48 km/h. This guard demonstrates that a properly designed guard can protect occupants in a sub- compact vehicle even with an initial ground clearance of 560 mm, provided it is capable of absorbing the energy of the impacting vehicle. RECOMMENDATIONS The results of this programme have shown that it is possible to build a guard meeting, and even exceeding, the performance requirements specified in the US FMVSS 223 that cannot provide acceptable protection to the passenger compartment of compact and sub-compact automobiles. Since these vehicle classes represented approximately 35% of the light-duty fleet registered in Canada, it is important for Canadians that improvements be made to the current FMVSS 223 requirements to provide protections to the occupants of these smaller vehicles. The NHTSA (Table V-1 of [2]) has found that 30% of the fatal crashes involving underride had occurred with a speed differential (Delta V) of 48 km/h or less; an additional 27% of these crashes occurred with a Delta V of 48 to 56 km/h, and a further 16% involved crashes with a Delta V of 56 to 64 km/h. This type of data does not exist for Canada; at best, speed limit at the scene of the collision is available. The Canadian data show that an estimated 80 to 90% of the fatal rear impact collisions involving trailers occur at posted road speeds at or above 80 kph. Given that there is a significant portion of fatal collisions involving underride where the Delta V is between 48 and 56 km/h and that modem automobiles are built to withstand Delta Vs of 56 km/h (US New Car Assessment Programme), it is recommended that the safety standard for Canada require underride guards that will be able to prevent PCI at speeds up to 56 km/h. To achieve this goal, it is recommended that; 1. The Test Method for CMVSS 223 specify an additional full-width test in its compliance procedure. 2. The full width uniform load test should have a minimum requirement of 350 kN before the ram displacement has reached 125 mm. 3. As the post collision guard deformed ground clearance Is of paramount importance, it Is suggested that an additional requirement be added that the guard ground clearance after the ram has displaced by 125 mm be no more than 560 mm. 4. The guard be capable of absorbing significantly more energy, potentially in the order of 20 kJ during a full- width test. A guard meeting all these requirements is commercially and technically feasible. Accepting these requirements would also allow for easy harmonisation of US and Canadian requirements by allowing manufactures to install underride guards at 560 mm ground clearance. 928</page><page sequence="12">ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors would like to thank Suzanne Tylko for her assistance in interpreting the ATD response data.
