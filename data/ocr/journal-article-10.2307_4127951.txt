<plain_text><page sequence="1">Shaping Sacred Space in the Sixteenth Century Design Criteria for the Collegio Borromeo's Chapel JOHN ALEXANDER Texas A &amp; M University espite the profusion of studies about the Catholic churches built in Italy during the latter half of the sixteenth century, several misconceptions persist. It is clear that during this period of religious redefinition, Catholic prelates and patrons attempted to change church architecture to enact reforming criteria. However, some modern scholars have maintained-without sufficient proof-that longitudinal, architecturally austere churches with minimal decoration formed a standard church-type that exclusively fulfilled the reformers' requirements.1 This notion oversimplifies the topic: the reformers in fact spon- sored churches that displayed a variety of architectural forms, approving designs for sacred spaces whose sources, plans, spatial configurations, and architectural qualities dif- fered significantly from the type generally considered the norm.' A newly discovered design drawing for the chapel in the Collegio Borromeo in Pavia, Italy (Figure 1), pro- vides an opportunity to reexamine the issue. Analyzing the drawing and placing it in the context of the patron's build- ing program, the architect's oeuvre, and late-sixteenth-cen- tury sacred architecture will demonstrate that buildings with rich articulation and ancient sources could satisfy con- temporary expectations for churches. The drawing in question is held in the archives of the Collegio Borromeo. It is a carefully drafted plan for a sacred space with overall dimensions for the width and depth of the main area. The paper has no watermark, and the draw- ing has no original signature, label, or date. Based on the Figure 1 Pellegrino Tibaldi, chapel of the Collegio Borromeo, Pavia, ca. 1570-75, design drawing</page><page sequence="2">Figure 2 Tibaldi, Collegio Borromeo, Pavia, 1562-89, plan handwriting of the numbers, however, it can be attributed to Pellegrino Tibaldi (1527-1596), the architect of the Col- legio.3 It is also possible to identify the drawing as a design for the college's chapel: the scheme has a general configu- ration that resembles the space as built, and features a sim- ilar placement of pilasters along the side walls. The discontinuous lines near the entry suggest walls that extend beyond the confines of the chapel, allowing the plan to be understood as representing a space within the college com- plex (Figure 2). Yet the drawing differs from the chapel as built in the following respects: while the dimension recorded for the width is accurate, the length falls about 1.7 meters (roughly 5 feet 7 inches) short;4 the actual space does not have freestanding columns, and its chancel is notably deeper. Thus, the drawing is certainly a design for the chapel, but the project was altered at some point. On the basis of the chronology of the Collegio's con- struction, it is possible to suggest a date for the drawing. Carlo Borromeo (1538-1584), a young cardinal who later became the archbishop of Milan, founded the Collegio in late 1561 and commissioned the building soon afterward. Tibaldi developed a design and initiated construction, but in late 1564 Borromeo secured a larger economic foundation for the institution. He envisioned a greater number of stu- dents and a larger building to house them; consequently, he instructed Tibaldi to expand the project. Correspondence between patron and architect demonstrates that the earlier design did not have a space designed specifically to serve as DESIGN CRITERIA FOR THE COLLEGIO BORROMEO'S CHAPEL 165</page><page sequence="3">the college chapel. Because the enlarged design did include such a space, the newly discovered drawing must be an elab- oration on the later project.' Typically, Tibaldi first established a general master plan for a building and then provided more detailed information about the design as required during the progress of con- struction. Building on the chapel commenced in 1571, but the documentation suggests that changes were made to the design in 1575 that necessitated some demolition and reconstruction. Following the alterations, work continued uninterrupted until the chapel was completed in 1579.6 Tibaldi may have produced the design drawing as early as 1570; however, the differences between the drawing and the realized space demonstrate that the drawing predates 1575, when the definitive dimensions of the chapel were fixed. Unfortunately, the plan provides no information about the intended vaulting for the chapel, nor the system for con- necting the pilasters and columns. The drawing's close resemblance to the actual chapel suggests that Tibaldi must have projected similar vaulting and articulation for both. In the chapel as it currently stands, the main space is covered by a barrel vault with large, rectangular coffers (Figures 3, 4). Fluted Doric pilasters lining the side walls of the chapel establish an alternating rhythm and support a full entabla- ture that marks the springing line of the vault (Figures 5, 6). The pilasters and entablature continue around the reentrant corners to the chapel's end walls. Toward the altar, the pilasters and entablature enframe a chancel arch, with a large thermal window closing the space between the entab- lature and barrel vault (Figure 7). Figure 3 Chapel of the Collegio Borromeo, Pavia, 1562-89, view toward the rear of the space Figure 4 Chapel of the Collegio Borromeo, view of the coffered barrel vault 166 JSAH / 63:2, JUNE 2004</page><page sequence="4">Figure 5 Chapel of the Collegio Borromeo, view showing the articulation of the lateral walls Figure 6 Chapel of the Collegio Borromeo, detail of the architectural order Figure 7 Chapel of the Collegio Borromeo, view toward the chancel DESIGN CRITERIA FOR THE COLLEGIO BORROMEO'S CHAPEL 167</page><page sequence="5">Had the columns been erected, they would share cen- terlines (or line up) with the pilasters on both the side and end walls, continuing the alternating rhythm. The width of the pilasters is approximately equal to the diameter of the columns; assuming that they were to be the same architec- tural order, Renaissance proportioning systems would have given them the same height or a similar scale. While the drawing does not indicate how the columns would have connected to the pilasters, one possible solution would have mimicked the articulation of the end wall: a full entablature would span from one side-wall pilaster across the free- standing columns to another pilaster on the opposite wall.' This configuration would have created permeable screens subdividing the chapel: it would have formed an entry near the doors and established the confines of the sacred space in front of the chancel. However they were to be connected with the pilasters, the four freestanding columns would have significantly altered one's experience of the space. As the only design drawing for the Collegio Borromeo that has come to light, this plan is of great importance for understanding the history of the building design. At the same time, the drawing can shed light on the patronage of Borromeo and the architecture of Tibaldi. Borromeo, like other contemporary reform-minded clergymen, sought to build, renovate, and restore churches in order to promote a reform of faith and morals. Beginning as a young prelate at the court of Pope Pius IV (r. 1559-65), he attended to the architecture of hundreds of churches in his vast archdio- cese. He frequently engaged the services of Tibaldi, the architect to whom he entrusted some of the most impor- tant projects. Borromeo gained experience over time in his role as archbishop, developing a set of standards for churches under his jurisdiction, which he published as Instructionesfabricae et supellectilis ecclesiasticae (Milan, 1577). While the book left many matters up to the discretion of the architect, it provided clear instructions-often in minute detail-about the spatial settings and furnishings required for conducting the sacramental rites.8 The design for the Collegio's chapel falls chronologi- cally into a formative period of Borromeo's patronage, but foreshadows some of the directions he later outlined in his Instructiones. One important issue for Borromeo was demar- cating the liturgical area within a church.9 In his book, he demanded that the chancel be raised above the floor level of the nave, carefully prescribing the height and number of steps. At the top of the steps a tall balustrade or railing was to enclose the chancel. The Instructiones also provided ample space for liturgical functions by establishing minimum dis- tances between railing and altar. If the chancel itself did not afford this space, then the raised floor area, or dais, could extend into the main body of the church: "The dais of the [chancel] and its entrance steps may be arranged or repaired in such a way that they project somewhat beyond the extent of the [chancel] itself, thus presenting an octagonal or hexagonal plan. However, if beyond the confines of the [chancel] there are intercolumniations, and if the size of the church demands it, the above-mentioned space may be used and taken by extending the [side] walls of the [chancel] up to the first of these bays."10 Tibaldi's chapel design was in general agreement with the principles that Borromeo would codify in his text. According to the drawing, Tibaldi extended the liturgical space beyond the confines of the chancel by projecting the dais into the main space of the chapel, although with a rec- tangular rather than polygonal configuration. Furthermore, he extended the liturgical space into the bay formed by the freestanding columns, but without the walled enclosure that Borromeo suggested in the Instructiones. The freestanding columns would create a liturgical zone, thereby participating in an architectural tradition in which columnar screens separated the chancel from the nave. The Constantinian and early medieval liturgical fur- nishings for the most important churches in Rome -including the basilica of St. Peter-included screens of freestanding columns." In the sixteenth century, reforming Catholic prelates accorded renewed attention to those ven- erable examples, believing that the early Christian basilicas provided ideal arrangements that were valid for contempo- rary churches. One important reformer, Gian Matteo Gib- erti (1495-1543), the bishop of Verona, renovated the furnishings of his cathedral as an architectural component of liturgical reforms. Giberti's renovations extended the dais into the nave of the cathedral and enclosed it with a curv- ing parapet wall and columnar screen constructed on top of the platform. A reinterpretation of early Christian prece- dents executed with the classical architectural orders, the new screen provided an important example to other reform- ing bishops.12 Giberti's scrupulous attention to his episcopal duties and his systematic enactment of reforms inspired other bishops, Borromeo among them. Yet in spite of his knowl- edge of and respect for both historical church architecture and Giberti, Borromeo does not appear to have favored the columnar screen. He rarely, if ever, commissioned one to demarcate the sanctuary of a church, preferring instead a combination of steps and railing, and perhaps also a cruci- fix or sanctuary lamp suspended from the chancel arch. Indeed, as archpriest of the Roman basilica of Sta. Maria Maggiore (an office he held from 1564 until 1572), Bor- romeo ordered the removal of a historic columnar screen. 168 JSAH / 63:2, JUNE 2004</page><page sequence="6">Figure 8 Collegio Borromeo, courtyard That screen-located in front of the dais, on the floor level of the nave-impeded a view of the altar, and it appears that Borromeo had it removed in order to improve visibility.13 Tibaldi, who collaborated closely with Borromeo on many ecclesiastical projects, understood his patron's devel- oping criteria for sacred space. The newly discovered design represents an attempt to satisfy the patron's goal of an appropriately emphasized and demarcated chancel within a small space. Borromeo almost certainly evaluated Tibaldi's design, but it remains questionable whether he approved of it. The archbishop allowed his architect great latitude in matters of design but he had specific requirements, often of a practical nature. If Borromeo generally objected to colum- nar screens in the belief that they concealed the altar, he may not have accepted the one proposed for the Collegio's chapel. Other plausible reasons for rejecting the columns might have been their cost or the need to maximize the amount of usable floor space.14 The freestanding columns were deleted, but the chapel was lengthened, and the sacred zone was expanded by increasing the depth of the chancel. Tibaldi's design, however, was more than simply an Figure 9 Pellegrino Tibaldi, Church of S. Fedele, Milan, 1569-1835 attempt to fulfill Borromeo's liturgical requirements. The freestanding columns and their organization demonstrate the architect's sense of what was appropriate for church architecture, both in terms of architectural ornamentation and historical sources. Tibaldi employed freestanding, monolithic columns quarried in the mountains of northern Italy in many of his buildings around Milan, including the Collegio's cortile (Figure 8) and the interior of the church of S. Fedele (Figure 9). In northern Italy, freestanding mono- lithic columns were considered superior to other means of support, such as piers or punctured bearing walls. Expen- sive, difficult to quarry, and hard to transport, they were regarded as luxury items; using them in a design proclaimed the building's importance and displayed the patron's wealth. Furthermore, freestanding columns imparted specific qual- ities to an architectural space and its illumination: with slen- der proportions, columns delicately screened one space from another rather than forcefully dividing areas. They also cast slim shadows, allowing large amounts of natural light to pass into porticoes and loggias."5 Including free- standing columns in the Collegio's chapel would have made DESIGN CRITERIA FOR THE COLLEGIO BORROMEO'S CHAPEL 169</page><page sequence="7">it architecturally opulent and provided desirable spatial qualities to the interior. Freestanding columns also evoked ancient architecture. Magnificent, even egregious displays of monolithic columns characterized some of the more spectacular buildings of the late Roman Empire. When coupled with vaulted ceilings in bath complexes and mausolea, the designs captured the imagination of Renaissance architects. Although the typolo- gies and associations of the ancient buildings sometimes made them incongruous prototypes for churches, their for- mal qualities inspired the architecture of Christian sacred space. Important examples come from the late career of Michelangelo Buonarroti (1475-1564), who designed the Sforza chapel in Sta. Maria Maggiore and transformed the great hall of the Baths of Diocletian into Sta. Maria degli Angeli. Both of the sacred spaces had colossal freestanding columns supporting impressive vaulting.16 Michelangelo's projects were particularly important for Tibaldi, who styled himself a follower of the great master. In his painting and architecture, Tibaldi consciously imi- tated Michelangelo's artistic methods and forms; he had surely studied Michelangelo's latest architectural works and understood their sources. Not surprisingly, Tibaldi's design for S. Fedele demonstrates Michelangelo's influence in its evocation of ancient architecture. Tibaldi designed and began construction on the church in the late 1560s, a few years before producing his design drawing for the Colle- gio's chapel.17 The presence of relatively large, freestand- ing columns in both S. Fedele and the chapel design suggests similar sources and goals for the two sacred spaces. While the design for the Collegio's chapel arose from a study of late antique architecture in a general way, it may not be possible to identify a specific ancient source for it. Screens of freestanding columns within vaulted spaces were important components of ancient Roman architecture, occurring in bath complexes and imperial residences, among other sorts of buildings. Apparently, Tibaldi selected an architectural solution from ancient sources that also served a spatial function analogous to that of furnishings in important Christian churches. While the design drawing's columns would have functioned like the columnar screens of Early Christian basilicas, they were more than mere fur- nishings: their scale within the chapel and their connection to the pilasters would have made them an integral part of the architecture. What emerges clearly is that Tibaldi sought ancient sources for his religious architecture, and one can interpret that exploration as a desire to impart architectural complexity and magnificence to sacred space.'8 As discussed, the freestanding columns seen in the design drawing were deleted, but the chapel was highly articulated and decorated. The pilasters and the cornice were constructed into the walls as the chapel was being built, and so their location, the alternating pattern that they establish, and some of their detailing may have been deter- mined before the alterations of 1575 were executed, per- haps as early as 1571.19 The Doric order used in the chapel is one of a variety of columnar forms seen in the Collegio, which appears to be a lexicon of the orders. The inventory begins with the banded and fragmented Doric order of the Collegio's portal, whose base is composed of a plinth and a single torus (Figures 10, 11). The Ionic order appears in the upper-level cortile arcade, with a base that faithfully re-cre- ates Vitruvius's idiosyncratic description of the Ionic base (Figure 12; see Figure 8). The chapel's fluted Doric is a highly articulated version of the order, with simple bases yet extremely detailed cornice (see Figure 6)-demonstrat- ing Tibaldi's study of Michelangelo's oeuvre and the treatise of Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola (1507-1573).20 Doric pilasters may have been considered appropriate for this space because it is on the ground floor, and Tibaldi articu- lated that level with only the Doric order. Because of its mythical, anthropomorphic origins, the Doric represented "masculine" virtues such as strength and fortitude, and thus it could have been intended to inspire the young men who worshipped there. Perhaps it also represented the steely resolve that the chapel's patron, Saint Justine, must have demonstrated as she faced her martyrdom.2' The level of detail on this order, however, marked the space as the most important area of the ground floor. There were two distinct programs for the decoration of the chapel. The first was carried out in 1579, immediately after the vault was completed, and the other was contracted and completed in 1584. Unfortunately, later work destroyed much of the original decoration; only the barrel vault exhibits what may be the original decoration (see Figure 4). In 1579, a local craftsman was engaged to execute stucco and painted decoration in the chapel. According to the contract, the work essentially followed Tibaldi's instructions; it included the fine detailing of the Doric order, and thus completed the archi- tectural ornamentation. Furthermore, it included faux-mar- ble finishes and some small figural scenes.22 During the summer of 1584, a number of Borromeo's agents for the pro- ject contracted Bernardo Cane, a local painter, to execute the decoration of the chancel (Figure 13).23 The officials included Federico Borromeo (1564-1631), Carlo's young cousin who was both student and administrator in the recently opened institution. Tibaldi determined the architectural detailing in the chancel and later evaluated the completed work.24 The iconographic scheme, however, was to be determined by Fed- erico and Carlo. According to the contract, "[Cane] is obliged 170 JSAH / 63:2, JUNE 2004</page><page sequence="8">Figure 10 Collegio Borromeo, fagade Figure 11 Collegio Borromeo, entry portal to paint in the vault of the chancel the figures that will be ordered of him by Count Federico Borromeo. In the rest of the chancel Maestro Bernardo promises to paint those mys- teries that will be ordered of him by the most illustrious Monsignor [Carlo Borromeo] or else by the aforementioned Count Federico or by Signor Pellegrino, the architect."25 Although the paintings are lost, it is clear that both Carlo and Federico had a hand in determining the decora- tion of the chapel. The evidence provided by the building sequence and construction documents demonstrates that the architect and the patron considered a high level of orna- mentation and decoration appropriate for the space. With the freestanding columns deleted from the design, the chapel was spatially more simple. However, it was still stim- ulating visually and laden with decoration. The richness of the chapel's design and decoration may seem paradoxical in light of views about late-sixteenth-cen- tury church design commonly held by modern scholars. It is often assumed that a number of characteristics-includ- ing discrete spaces for different functional zones, unob- structed views of the altar, and restrained or even no decoration-typified the Counter-Reformation church.26 Tibaldi's original design for the Collegio's chapel, however, does not adhere to that supposed norm in the spatial com- plexity created by the columns, and the realized space is much more highly articulated and decorated than one might expect. Another conventional notion the chapel chal- lenges is that the mother church of the Society of Jesus in Rome, known as the Gesii, was the prototypical example of DESIGN CRITERIA FOR THE COLLEGIO BORROMEO'S CHAPEL 171</page><page sequence="9">Figure 12 Collegio Borromeo, courtyard, detail of the base of the Ionic order in the upper-story arcade Figure 13 Collegio Borromeo, view of the chancel the Counter-Reformation church and the model for aus- terity in architecture and decoration.27 This in turn suggests that antiquity no longer played an inspirational role for architects. As we have seen, however, Tibaldi turned to ancient sources for his religious spaces. These apparent paradoxes identify problems not with the example under discussion, but rather with some of the modern studies. In order to appreciate fully the place of Tibaldi's chapel (both as initially proposed and as finally built and decorated) in the contemporary architectural context, it is necessary to review the history of the Gesui and reevaluate current inter- pretations of it. Beginning in the late 1540s, the newly formed Society of Jesus sought to have a mother church built in Rome ex novo. The Jesuits had a series of architects draw up a num- ber of designs over several years; they initiated construction a couple of times, but no project progressed beyond the ini- tial foundations. To their great fortune, Cardinal Alessandro Farnese (1520-1589) assumed patronage of the building in 1561. Working with designs by his preferred architect, Gia- como Barozzi da Vignola, the cardinal studied the possibil- ities of the site and considered various solutions, finally selecting a scheme and ordering that construction begin in 1568. Later, he had the design altered somewhat, following the suggestions of Giacomo Della Porta to raise the height of the internal vaulting and to change the fagade design (Figures 14, 15).28 Modern studies on the Gesui have focused on its role as mother church of the Society of Jesus or on the criteria that supposedly informed its design. Ideological ends led some authors to posit that the Jesuits had a monolithic artistic and architectural program that they imposed on all of their commissions throughout the world;29 although this notion of "Jesuit art" has been discredited, there remains the idea 172 JSAH / 63:2, JUNE 2004</page><page sequence="10">Figure 14 Giacomo Vignola and Giacomo Della Porta, church of the Gesi, Rome, 1568-84, plan that the Gesii immediately became the predominant model for Catholic churches of the Counter-Reformation.30 Other authors have sought a correspondence between the stated goals of the Society of Jesus for their residential or educa- tional buildings and the characteristics of contemporary church architecture, including the Gesui. They posited that the Gesui originally had severely simple architecture and limited decoration to accord with the religious tenets of the Jesuits, a view that continues to color the study of the reli- gious architecture of the Counter-Reformation. 31 It is true that some of the reforming Catholic religious orders of the sixteenth century, such as the Jesuits or the Clerics Regular of St. Paul (commonly known as the Barn- abites), believed that simple architecture was appropriate for their colleges and residences. In imitation of Christ and in keeping with scriptural injunctions, they avoided financial endowments (initially) and required their members to take vows of poverty.32 They believed that this ideal should be reflected in the buildings in which they lived and taught: plain architecture would be an analogue of and visible testa- ment to the instituted indigence of the order. Thus, many of their buildings were devoid of architectural ornament, and some were downright pauperistic, demonstrating little atten- tion to overall form or architectural principles.33 Figure 15 Vignola and Della Porta, church of the Gesi, Rome, engraving by Valerien Regnard, ca. 1616 This austerity did not, however, extend to the churches that were built for these orders. The 1558 general assembly of the Society ofJesus resolved "to establish norms for the con- struction of the order's residences and colleges in order to avoid making them like noblemen's palaces (among other defects). These buildings should be built to be inhabited and to be useful for carrying out our duties; they should be hygienic and structurally sound. In them should be seen a tes- tament to our poverty, and therefore they should be neither sumptuous nor of elaborate design. ... About churches, noth- ing was decided, and it seemed preferable that everything regarding them should be considered at greater length."34 Although the wording of the decree suggests some ambivalence about what was appropriate for churches, nei- ther this nor later documents specified any particular archi- tectural character. Furthermore, a survey of churches built for the Jesuits on the Italian peninsula during the mid- to late sixteenth century demonstrates a variety of architec- tural qualities: many were fairly simple yet articulated build- ings, but some had more complex designs. Since the order's central authority in Rome approved each of these designs, it is clear that there was neither a specified rule nor a stan- dard practice that stipulated pauperistic architecture for Jesuit churches.3" DESIGN CRITERIA FOR THE COLLEGIO BORROMEO'S CHAPEL 173</page><page sequence="11">The contemporary Catholic authors who weighed in on the appropriate attributes for churches declared that they were worthy of the highest standard of art and architecture. A church was the house of God and deserved human beings' greatest efforts to adorn it appropriately. Seeking to justify the ornamentation of churches despite the criticism of Protestant reformers, Catholics sought precedents in the practices of the Early Church. Borromeo, for example, relied on ancient texts and the examples of the Christian basilicas of Rome to justify architectural ornamentation and rich furnishings. In his letter prefacing the Instructiones, he wrote that his goal was to ensure "the splendor and future use of all our churches" based upon "that ancient piety and reverence of the faithful (which originated in the time of the Apostles) ... which clearly shone forth in the construc- tion of... sacred buildings and in the admirable disposition of their sacred furnishings."36 This text speaks to Bor- romeo's intentions, while his patronage demonstrates that he sought splendor for churches in highly decorated archi- tecture, at least for the most important ones. The ideas cir- culating among reformers in the Catholic Church did not, in fact, propose that architectural simplicity was appropri- ate for churches, but rather elaborate designs and ornate furnishings.37 Problems arose, however, when nineteenth-century scholars began interpreting Roman religious spaces of the mid-sixteenth century as embodying the architectural pau- perism specified for religious residences and colleges. Some oratories, chapels, and churches shared a spatial organiza- tion that led to their designation as chiese ad aula. Entry and altar were organized along a longitudinal axis within a rec- tangular space; more elaborate examples had discrete yet interconnected spaces for a narthex, chancel, and sometimes side altars (Figure 16). Generally small buildings, some had minimal architectural articulation or decoration.38 These were straightforward and economical solutions, but some historians transposed the criteria of the reforming orders' residences and colleges to these churches, interpreting them as embodying a religiously motivated austerity.39 The same scholars also saw the monochrome of the naves as a symbol of austerity. Many of these churches had highly decorated and colored chapels but congregational spaces whose wall surfaces, details, and either flat wooden ceilings or masonry vaults all had subtle tonal variations of creamy travertine, whitewashed stucco, or light gray paint. This monochromatic effect was more likely the result of either financial constraints or aesthetic choice. In Rome, a medley of white or cream stucco and travertine details char- acterized the interior of the late-Quattrocento church of Sta. Maria del Popolo as well as many Cinquecento fagades, all in imitation of the marble buildings of antiquity. A sim- ilar sort of restraint could be seen in other Renaissance churches (such as Quattrocento Florentine churches and Palladio's Venetian churches) that were by no means con- sidered austere.40 Without documentation about the inten- tions of the patrons and the builders, it remains debatable that the simplicity and restrained palette of some of these churches had the purported religious significance. Developing further their study of the chiesa ad aula, these scholars stated that the Gesit represents an elevated version of that type, and that the Jesuit church's architecture and initial decoration demonstrated religiously motivated austerity.41 The nave of the Gesui (see Figures 14, 15) does indeed share certain qualities with the chiesa ad aula: both are longitudinal with separate spaces for side chapels. How- ever, the Gesui belongs to a lineage that combines longitu- dinal and centralized church-types, along with St.'Andrea in Mantua and some designs for the new St. Peter's in Rome. The spatial and structural organization (especially around the dome) demonstrates both study of and develop- ment on those buildings. Like its progenitors, the Gesit harkens back to impressive imperial Roman architecture, such as the Basilica Nuova on the Roman Forum.42 These august origins cast doubt on the claim that the Gesit had an intentionally austere architectural design. Indeed, the scale of the interior space and vaulting, the sophistication of the design, and the strength of the architectural orders all attest to a magnificent building. The patronage of the Gesit substantiates this reading of the building. Farnese was connected to the Jesuits in a num- ber of ways: his grandfather, Pope Paul III (r. 1534-49), had approved the constitutions of the order and fostered its early foundations. Farnese himself was cardinal-protector of the order for a number of years, and came under the sway of its spirituality late in his life. He may have felt a respon- sibility to assist in realizing the church, but the building had to serve his own ends as well. In addition to glorifying God and benefiting the Jesuits, the Gesui had to represent the cardinal: the building was to be a public display of his piety, wealth, and power, and Farnese planned to be buried under the chancel of the church. The correspondence about the project demonstrates that Farnese determined many general aspects of the design. He wanted one interior nave with side chapels and the highest quality design in terms of architectural pro- portions. Overriding the economic and functional concerns of the Jesuits, he insisted that the building be erected on the most prominent part of the site, and that vaulting cover the interior. To execute the design he relied on Vignola. An informed patron, Farnese demonstrated his faith in 174 JSAH / 63:2, JUNE 2004</page><page sequence="12">i'ast GcL-mgt?;t i.

Giovanni Decollato, Rome, 1534-52, plan and section Vignola's professional capabilities and his approval for the architect's all'antica forms, proportions, and details. Far- nese's criteria and Vignola's architecture gave the building a design that was spatially and structurally sophisticated. As construction progressed, Farnese became convinced that changes suggested by Della Porta could be improve- ments, and Vignola was replaced. The changes-added height to the interior and greater plasticity on the fagade-augmented the magnificence of the building.43 Throughout the process, Farnese was certainly in charge, but the Jesuits were not mute witnesses of some- thing as important as the creation of their mother church. Realizing from bitter experience that the project would inevitably cost them money and take years to construct, they wanted a building that would not be exorbitantly expensive and that they could utilize in the near future. Fur- thermore, they desired a church that could spatially and acoustically accommodate preaching to a large congrega- tion. The Jesuits are documented as establishing practical requirements for the Gesui, and such criteria informed much of the renovation and new construction of the Counter-Reformation.44 For example, the Medici dukes of Florence removed medieval choir screens and the devo- tional clutter that had accumulated in some important DESIGN CRITERIA FOR THE COLLEGIO BORROMEO'S CHAPEL 175</page><page sequence="13">urban churches in order to achieve an unobstructed view of the main altar.45 Borromeo's Instructiones codified the spatial configurations and furnishings that would allow a priest to carry out the sacramental rites.46 Similarly, the Jesuits requested a space in which to preach; contemporary processes for reforming liturgical spaces accepted such prac- tical concerns, and the broad, single nave of the Gesui accommodated them. The Gesui was also intended to house a sumptuous deco- rative program. Decoration of some of the side chapels began soon after the building was completed. Farnese had assumed patronage of the decoration of the domed crossing and the main altar, and he intended to have the half-dome of the apse decorated with a mosaic cycle. Farnese's death brought his dec- orative projects to a halt before the mosaics were begun, and the Jesuits tried (unsuccessfully) to convince Farnese's heirs to continue with less expensive frescoes in the apse. Often respon- sibility to secure funding for the continuing decoration of side chapels or the transepts fell upon the Jesuits, and they did their utmost to have the work executed. Their involvement in all aspects of the decorative campaigns-from determining the subject matter to engaging patrons-attests to their complic- ity in seeing that at least some areas of the interior were well adorned. What the Jesuits originally desired for the barrel vaults in the church remains an open question, although it is no longer possible to posit an intentional "austerity." They may have originally appreciated its monochromatic quality for aes- thetic reasons, only to have it decorated later because of a gen- eral change in taste. However, when viewed in the context of the Jesuits' efforts to adorn the interior, the late-seventeenth- century decoration of the vaulting seems like the culmination of a drawn-out yet continuous effort.47 A revised understanding of the Ges i illuminates its similarities to Tibaldi's chapel in the Collegio Borromeo and demonstrates how it, too, begs a redefinition of Catholic church architecture during the mid- to late six- teenth century. Neither the patron, the architect, nor the clients wanted the Gesui to be an architecturally forbidding church, and there is no documentation indicating that they intended it to have a plain interior. Individuals like Bor- romeo and religious orders like the Jesuits who were involved in religious reform had clear criteria for their churches. Borromeo, while insisting on dignified, tradi- tional, well-ordered settings, allowed for flexibility in the architectural articulation. He sought architectural splendor for the most important churches but would accept a sim- pler treatment when necessary. The Jesuits appear to have followed suit, accepting everything from Tibaldi's stupen- dous S. Fedele to some rather uninspired churches designed by a fellow Jesuit. Although the Jesuits normally confined themselves to identifying the practical requirements for their churches, they were by no means insensible to archi- tectural matters; indeed, their correspondence about the various phases of design for the Gesui demonstrates enthu- siasm for the participation of prestigious architects and for sumptuous designs.4" Furthermore, the Jesuits oversaw the decoration of their churches in Rome in the latter half of the sixteenth century. Although the themes were carefully selected to be consistent with the dedication of the church or its purposes-and may have been in debatable taste-the interiors did receive decorative work.49 The formal latitude that patrons such as Borromeo and the Jesuits allowed architects like Tibaldi and Vignola meant they could employ their full creativity in seeking solutions to the design of churches and chapels. While tak- ing into consideration the criteria they were given, they made use of a wide variety of sources in establishing the plans and spatial configurations of these buildings, includ- ing ancient and Renaissance models. The Gesui was an important building-one that was imitated in a variety of locations, and not just by the Jesuits-but it did not imme- diately become the unique Counter-Reformation church type.50 The newly discovered plan for the Collegio Bor- romeo's chapel and the space actually executed enable us to review and amend our conception of the church architec- ture desired by important reformers of the sixteenth cen- tury. Understanding the context of both Tibaldi's design and the Ges i permits us to appreciate the splendid archi- tecture and decoration in buildings that embodied reform- ing criteria yet quite adequately provided sites for the worship of God. Notes The bulk of the research for this essay was conducted with generous assis- tance from the Kress Foundation, for which I am extremely grateful. I would like to thank the rector of the Collegio Borromeo, Don Ernesto Maggi, for opening the archives to me and granting me permission to pub- lish the design drawing. I would also like to thank the Collegio's archivist, Sig. Ambrogio Gatti Comini, for kindly sharing his understanding of the archives and experience with the documents. The assistance of a number of colleagues-Dr. Richard Schofield of the Istituto Universitario di Architet- tura di Venezia, Dr. Paul Barolsky of the University of Virginia, Drs. Gregor Kalas, Vivian Paul, and James Rosenheim of Texas A &amp; M Univer- sity-was fundamental in developing the article's argument and polishing its form. 1. The seminal work that diffused this misconception was Milton Joseph Lewine, "The Roman Church Interior, 1527-1580" (Ph.D. diss., Colum- bia University, 1960). Reiterating Lewine's proposition were James S. Ack- erman, "The Gesis in Light of Contemporary Church Design," in Rudolf Wittkower and Irma B. Jaffe, eds., Baroque Art: The Jesuit Contribution (New 176 JSAH / 63:2, JUNE 2004</page><page sequence="14">York, 1972), 15-28 (reprinted in James Ackerman, Distance Points: Essays in Theory and Renaissance Art and Architecture [Cambridge, Mass., 1991]); Sando Benedetti, Fuori dal classicismo. Sintetismo, tipolgia, ragione nell'ar- chitettura del Cinquecento (Rome, 1984); and Giovanni Sale, Pauperismo architettonico e architettura gesuitica. Dalla chiesa ad aula al Gesil di Roma (Milan, 2001). The distortion is compounded when scholars opine that the Church of the Gesii, Rome, became the preeminent prototype of this sort of church, suggesting that all subsequent longitudinal churches with similar qualities must necessarily have been based on it-this despite planning features that change the typology, such as the side aisles of Sta. Maria in Vallicella, Rome, or spatial units that differentiate the example from the supposed type (as in the paired sail-vaulted units that form the nave in S. Fedele, Milan [see Fig- ure 9]). Different combinations of these ideas appear in otherwise sound surveys, such as Peter Murray, The Architecture of the Italian Renaissance (New York, 1986), 202; John T. Paoletti and Gary M. Radke, Art in Renaissance Italy (London, 1997), 424-25; and Rudolf Wittkower, Art and Architecture in Italy 1600-1750, Pelican History of Art, 6th ed. (New Haven and Lon- don, 1999), 15. 2. One example is the Jesuit church of S. Fedele in Milan; Stefano Della Torre and Richard Schofield's study of the church went to great lengths to disabuse scholars of the misconceptions I refer to in n. 1. See Stefano Della Torre and Richard Schofield, Pellegrino Tibaldi architetto e il S. Fedele di Milano. Invenzione e costruzione di una chiesa esemplare (Como, 1994), 138, 183,285-320. 3. Tibaldi's numerals are particular; one can compare those on the drawing with other examples (ibid., fig. 80). An inscription was later added on the verso of the drawing identifying it as the chapel for the Collegio. 4. The dimensions on the plan are provided in Milanese braccia. My con- clusions result from using the conversion ratio of 1 braccia = .595 meters, and comparing the resulting dimensions with the scale plan of the Collegio pub- lished in Waldemar Hiersche, Pellegrino de' Pellegrini alsArchitekt (Parchim i. M., 1913), fig. 7. There are also inconsistencies between the length and width of the space in the plan and the dimensions provided. Although care- fully drafted, it was either imprecise or superseded by slight adjustments in the size of the chapel. Tibaldi may have added the dimensions to rectify the problem, communicating the intended distance between walls. 5. John Alexander, "The Collegio Borromeo: A Study of Borromeo's Early Patronage and Tibaldi's Early Architecture" (Ph.D. diss., University of Vir- ginia, 2001), 18-35. 6. Tibaldi's method of providing more specific information and details as they were needed for construction is documented in Luisa Giordano, "Addenda per la storia di S. Cristofo," Archivio Storico Lodigiano, 2d ser., 39 (1991), 113-20. On the dates for the construction, see Alexander, "Colle- gio Borromeo," 23-46, 137-88. Note that the information presented here differs from the conclusion in my dissertation that there was no change to the design once construction on the chapel was under way (ibid., 41-46, 137-88). One entry from the construction account of 1575 may document the demolition noted in the text of this article, perhaps demonstrating an alteration in the design at that time (ibid., 174 n. 1). 7. Another possibility is that the entablature would extend from the pilasters on both the side walls and the end walls, meeting at a ninety-degree angle over the nearest column; the span between the two freestanding columns would remain open, thus emphasizing the axis into the chancel. Also, one should not entirely exclude the possibility of a Serliana. 8. T. Barton Thurber, "L'architettura religiosa nell'arcidiocesi di Carlo Bor- romeo," in Claudia Conforti and Richard J.

Borromeo's attention to the demarcation of the liturgical area can be identified in specific examples of ecclesiastical patronage that he undertook early in his career: Sta. Prassede (see Maurizio Caperna, "San Carlo Bor- romeo, cardinale di S. Prassede, e il rinnovamento della sua chiesa titolare a Roma," Palladio 12 [1993], 43-58), Sta. Maria Maggiore (see Klaus Schwa- ger, "Die architektonische Erneuerung von S. Maria Maggiore unter Paul V," Rimisches Jahrbuch fiir Kunstgeschichte 20 [1983], 241-312), and the cathedral in Milan (of which there are many studies-see esp. Sandro Benedetti, "Un'aggiunta a Pirro Ligorio. Il tabernacolo di Pio IV nel Duomo di Milano," Palladio, 3d ser., vol. 27, no. 1 [1978], 45-64; and Maria Luisa Gatti Perer, "Cultura e socialit6 dell'altare barocco nell'antica Diocesi di Milano," Arte Lombarda 42/43 [1975], 11-66). See also Alexander, "Col- legio Borromeo," 336-43. The criteria that Borromeo applied to these examples he later applied to his evaluations, restorations, and renovations of numerous churches scattered across his vast archdiocese; see Thurber, "L'architettura religiosa," 390-405. 10. Borromeo, Instructiones, as trans. in Voelker, "Borromeo's Instructiones," 144. The information about Borromeo's demands for the chancel is from Voelker, "Borromeo's Instructiones," 124-206. 11. The progenitor of these screens was the fastigium that Constantine donated to S. Giovanni in Laterano. See Sible de Blaauw, Cultus et decor Liturgia e architettura nella Roma tardoantica e medievale, vol. 1 (Vatican City, 1994), 117-26, 159-60; for the Early Christian screens in Sta. Maria Mag- giore and St. Peter's, see 385-93, and vol. 2, 475-84. 12. Studying the architecture and furnishings of Early Christian churches as a source for reforming contemporary church interiors became a com- mon practice during the latter sixteenth century; Giberti's use of Early Christian sources was certainly precocious and influential, but not out of context. See Derek Moore, "Sanmicheli's Tornacoro in Verona Cathedral: A New Drawing and Problems of Interpretation," JSAH 44 (Sept. 1985), 221-32. See also Penelope C. Brownell, "La figura di commitente del vescovo Gianmatteo Giberti. Il rinnovamento cinquecentesco della chiesa di Sto. Stefano," in Sergio Marinelli, ed., Veronese e Verona (Verona, 1988), 53-83; William H. C.

Borromeo demonstrated his understanding of and reliance on Early Christian models for new work in the cathedral in Milan in his letter of 23 Sept. 1564 (partially transcribed in Alexander, "Collegio Borromeo," appen- dix III, doc. 2, 377-78). Giberti's influence on Borromeo is attested to by their common attention to liturgical furnishings, in general, and by specific practices, such as placing the tabernacle on the main altar; see Moore, "San- micheli's Tornacoro," 229-32. See also Ackerman, "Gesiu," 20 (see n. 1); and Alexander, "Collegio Borromeo," 321-22, 336-38, 362 n. 17, 368 n. 49. The question remains, however, of how much of the work at Sta. Maria Maggiore Borromeo conceived of himself, and how much was planned by his immediate predecessor and merely executed by him. In any case, the screen was considered to impede a view of the altar and it was removed. For Borromeo's work in Sta. Maria Maggiore, see Alexander, "Collegio Bor- romeo," 338-43; De Blaauw, "Cultus," 1: 367-77; and Schwager, "Architek- tonische Erneuerung," 286-90.

DESIGN CRITERIA FOR THE COLLEGIO BORROMEO'S CHAPEL 177</page><page sequence="15">14. Borromeo had numerous architectural projects under way during this period, which strained his financial resources. Therefore, economizing on the details of the Collegio (criteria previously applied in 1565) may have been one motivation for deleting the freestanding columns from the chapel. See Alexander, "Collegio Borromeo," 35-36, 323-49. 15. In comparing one Renaissance villa (Palazzo del Te, Mantua, by Giulio Romano) with another that it was intended to surpass (Villa Madama, Rome, by Raphael Sanzio et al.), one can deduce the northern Italian appre- ciation for columns. In the garden loggia of the Mantuan example, a spec- tacular columnar display replaced the piers and pilasters of its Roman rival. See Egon Verheyen, The Palazzo del Te in Mantua: Images of Love and Poli- tics (Baltimore, 1977), 21-62. See also Howard Hibbard, The Architecture of the Palazzo Borghese (Rome, 1962), 28; Ciro Zucchi, L'architettura dei cortili milanesi, 1535-1706 (Milan, 1989), 99; and Alexander, "Collegio Bor- romeo," 559-60. 16. Despite continuing questions about what vaulting solution Michelan- gelo planned for the Sforza Chapel, it continues to be an example of his search in ancient architecture for sources for contemporary religious archi- tecture. For Michelangelo's religious buildings, see Giulio Carlo Argan and Bruno Contardi, Michelangelo Architect, trans. Marion L. Grayson (New York, 1993), 348-49, 354-57. 17.

Benedetti's and Sale's discussion of the architecture ofJesuit residences and colleges is valid (Benedetti, Fuori dal classicismo, 70-78; and Sale, Pau- perismo, 33-38).

Lewine recognized that a lack of decoration in oratories did not neces- sarily indicate the original intention of the patrons, but for some unknown reason he did not extend this understanding to the chapels and churches that he discussed. To the contrary, he concluded that these spaces exempli- fied religiously motivated austerity (ibid., 2-3, 50, 85-102). Benedetti and Sale repeated this view. See Sandro Benedetti, "L'avvio pauperistica alla prima stagione dell'architettura gesuitica," in Sale, Pauperismo, 9-20; Benedetti, Fuori dal classicismo, 69-90; and Sale, Pauperismo, 27-48. See Schofield, review of Sale, 299-301, for a refutation of their arguments. 40. Lewine discussed a possible aesthetic motivation for monochromatic church interiors ("Roman Church Interior," 57-65), as did Della Torre and 178 JSAH / 63:2, JUNE 2004</page><page sequence="16">Schofield (Pellegrino, 307).

Benedetti and Sale understood it to be a development on the chiesa ad aula (Benedetti, Fuori dalclassicismo, 72-91; Sale, Pauperismo, 77-78). Anglo- phone scholars, however, tended to emphasize the pauperistic interpretation of the original interior (Ackerman, "Gesii," 27 [see n. 1]; Hibbard, "Utpic- turae," 33; and Murray, Architecture of the Italian Renaissance, 202). 42. Claudia Conforti, "Roma. Architettura e citta," in Claudia Conforti and Richard J. Tuttle, eds., Storia dell'architettura italiana. II secondo Cinquecento (Milan, 2001), 47-54. I disagree, however, that the similarity between the Gesui and St.'Andrea is "esclusivamente visivo," as Conforti states (51). While her point about the differing vaulting is certainly valid, the similar- ities in planning and in interior elevation seem to me to demonstrate Vig- nola's study and reinterpretation of St.'Andrea. 43. Farnese also imposed budgetary limits (initially 40,000 scudi, and in 1568 25,000 scudi) that were quickly superseded. See Clare Robertson, 'll Gran Cardinale': Alessandro Farnese, Patron of the Arts (New Haven and London, 1992), esp. 181-96; Pecchiai, II Gesif, 19-81 (see n. 28); and Schwager and Schlimme, "La chiesa," 272-79 (see n. 28). 44. Three letters are important to an understanding of the requirements of the Jesuits, the orders of Farnese, and the accomplishments of Vignola: Giulio Folco to Alessandro Farnese, 23 Aug. 1568 (Robertson, 'Gran Car- dinale,' appendix, doc. 62, 301); and Alessandro Farnese to Francisco Bor- gia, 26 Aug. 1568, and Alessandro Farnese to Giacomo Vignola, (26?) Aug. 1568, (Pietro Pirri, Giovanni Tristano e i primordi della architettura gesuitica [Rome, 1955], docs. 24 and 25, 228-29). The Jesuits' focus on practical criteria is one point on which both sides of this debate agree.

Alcune precisazioni sulla difficile nascita del Gesiu di Roma," in Luciano Patetta and Stefano Della Torre, eds., L'architettura della Compagnia di Gesi in Italia, XV7-XVIIIsecolo (Genoa, 1992), 70-74. From the late 1560s through the mid-1580s, the Jesuits in Milan expressed similar enthusiasm about the architecture and furnishings of S. Fedele; see Della Torre and Schofield, Pellegrino, 117-238. 49. Lewine proposed a cutoff date of 1580 for his study of the Roman church interior, noting the decoration of the interior of Sta. Maria dei Monti as evidence of a change in attitude toward decoration. There is, how- ever, no documentary evidence for an earlier desire for austerity, and this calls into question the purported change in attitude. Thus, 1580 does not appear to be a useful demarcation and in this article I disregard it. Evidence for the sixteenth-century decoration of Jesuit churches in Rome exists, for example, for S. Vitale, an ancient church restored by the Jesuits and given a comprehensive decorative scheme. See Levy, "'Noble Medley,"' 47-51, and cat. entry 118, 188-89. 50. There are a number of sixteenth-century Jesuit churches that do not conform to the Gesui type: see B6sel, Jesuitenarchitektur, vol. 1, fig. 84 (see no. 35); Della Torre and Schofield, Pellegrino, 117-49, 273-329; and Schwa- ger and Schlimme, "La chiesa," 272-86. Perhaps the most telling sixteenth- century examples that do not conform to the type were designed by Jesuit architects: see the plans for ideal Jesuit churches, ca. 1580, designed by Gio- vanni de Rosis, SJ (1538-1610) (published in Pirri, Giovanni, pl. 6); the Jesuit churches in Genoa and Naples designed by Giuseppe Valeriano, SJ (1542-1596); and Valeriano's designs for other Jesuit churches in Rome and Cosenza (B6sel, Jesuitenarchitektur, vol. 1, figs. 125, 246-49). See also Sale, Pauperismo, 91-93; Schofield, review oflnstructionum, 208-9; and Schofield, review of Sale, 299-301. Furthering the view expressed by these authors, Aurora Scotti recently delivered a lecture on centrally planned churches that were designed and built in northern Italy in the second half of the sixteenth and the early sev- enteenth centuries. Her study provided additional evidence that the Gesiu was not the only church-type acceptable during that period.
