<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME RECENT PUBLICATIONS ON THE CLASSICAL TRADITION IN THE MIDDLE AGES AND THE RENAISSANCE AND ON BYZANTIUM I Professor Hanfmann's publication of the season sarcophagus of Dumbarton Oaks1 is also a monograph on season sarcophagi in general and on the symbolism of the Horae and seasons in literature and art. The appearance of two important reviews by Professor Doro Levi2 and by Miss Marion Lawrence3 affords this writer an opportunity of re-evaluating his first impression of the book in the light of criticism by others. One may agree with Professor Levi's warnings as to the uncertainties of stylistic analysis, in particular with regard to Professor Hanfmann's datings of Lte antique or early Christian monuments within limits of less than half a century on stylistic grounds, while still accepting the latter's over-all view of the formal development of third- and fourth-century Roman sculpture. The main results of Professor Hanfmann's stylistic analyses at any rate fit well into the history of late antique art and culture: so when he contrasts the 1 George . A.

Similarly, it is shown in a very illuminating manner how the abstract geometric order of the sarcophagi of the Tetrarchie period (c. 280 - c. 315) was transformed into the ' classicism ' of the Gonstantinian age to which the Dumbarton Oaks sarcophagus belongs. This sarcophagus is one of the most important representatives of its genus and probably the most beautiful extant, except for the season sarcophagus in Cassel and another one in the Palazzo dei Conservatori, both of the Severan period (nos. 461 and 336 of Hanfmann's list). The representations on these three sarcophagi of the seasons themselves ? two heroic youths on each side of a central subject ? are so close to one another in type, attitude, and position, that it is somewhat surprising that Professor Hanfmann does not seem to consider direct dependence of the classicist sculptor of the Dumbarton Oaks sarcophagus on a Severan season sarcophagus of the Cassel or Palazzo dei Con servatori type. It is true that the central subjects on the fronts of the three sarcophagi are different: while the Cassel sarcophagus shows Dionysius riding on a panther, and the one in the Palazzo dei Conservatori, the door of a funeral monument, the Dumbarton Oaks sarcophagus has a medallion (imago clipeata) with portraits of a couple, bordered by a band with the signs of the zodiac; in this respect, the latter resembles a season sarcophagus in the Camposanto of Pisa, Hanfmann's list no. 464, dated by him about 260* and considered by him as a close relative of the Dumbarton Oaks sarcophagus. The portraits of the Dumbarton Oaks sarcophagus are unfinished, a feature found in not a few other late Roman sarcophagi. Professor Hanfmann rightly concludes that sarcophagi were bought ready-made, but does not discuss the interesting question whether or not such portraits were usually finished in the likeness of the deceased, possibly, after wax masks. The cosmological symbolism of the imago clipeata, especially in its connection with the zodiac, would like wise bear further elucidation.5 The Dumbarton Oaks sarcophagus is, convincingly in this reviewer's opinion, identified by Professor Hanfmann as the work of a pagan sculptor of the second quarter of the fourth century. In spite of Miss Lawrence's remarks, it seems to me that there is considerable stylistic development, in the sense of loss of natural roundness and increase of puppet-like articulation, between the sarco phagi 336, 468, and even 497, of Hanfmann's list, dating from c. 260-280, and the Dumbarton Oaks sarcophagus. On the other hand, notwithstanding Pro fessor Levi's doubts, the exclusive seasonal-cosmological symbolism and the frankly pagan character of the whole work ? heroic nakedness of the seasons, the Attis costume of winter, etc. ? seem to rule out Christian origin of the Dumbarton Oaks sarcophagus. This sarcophagus thus takes its place in that strong current of diehard paganism which runs through the fourth and early fifth century.6 4 But cf. Levi, loc. cit. 235. 5 See H. P.

Alf?ldi, A Conflict of Ideas in the Late Roman</page><page sequence="3">580 TRADITIO The second and larger part of Professor Hanfmann's work deals with the history of the Horae and seasons in literature and art. The original meaning of the Horae as vegetation spirits persisted ? in spite of Hesiod's lastingly influential idea to connect them with the ethical-political sphere as the three daughters of Zeus and Themis : Eunomia, Dike and Eirene ? and very frequently led to their identification with the four seasons of the year. This identification, however, is reflected, in the visual arts, only from the Hellenistic period on ward (since c. 300 B.C.). It is continued in the literature and art of Rome, where, probably under ' Pythagorean ' or Neo-Pythagorean influence, the sacred number Four links the four seasons to the four ages of man and to various other aspects of a tetradic structure of the world ? a conception which astrological speculation of Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages was greatly to expand (the four elements, four directions, four winds, four temperaments can all be made dependent on, or parallel with, the varying influences of the stars in the four seasons). Professor Hanfmann's principal contribution to the history of the ideology and iconography of the seasons lies in the excellent exposition of the reasons for their popularity in Late Antiquity. He points out that in that period the wide-spread use of seasonal allegory is only one aspect of a general change in late pagan religious thought, in which personifications of cosmic and ethical forces ? such as nature, time, the virtues, etc. ? increasingly supplement and even replace the Olympian gods. This is an extremely important spiritual process of far-reaching consequences also for Christian literature and art, and I can, therefore, not agree with Professor Levi's statement7 that in view of the vagueness of late antique allegory and iconography, which include mythological astronomical, astrological and philosophical meanings, Professor Hanfmann's effort to review the monuments in the light of contemporary philosophy and religion ' is often completely futile. ' It is true that it will hardly be possible to decide from the reliefs of the Dum barton Oaks sarcophagus to which of the late antique religious philosophies or mystery cults the couple belonged which ordered it, but Professor Hanfmann has greatly clarified the general background against which this work of art, exceptional among the surviving specimens of its period, must be held. He has rendered a great service in offering a compendium of late antique season lore, with an interesting epilogue on its survival in medieval and early modern times, which also considers to some extent the relation between representations of the seasonal occupations and the better known iconography of the labors of the months in Antiquity and the Middle Ages.8 Of special interest is the chapter on the emperor and the seasons in Late Antiquity. On coins and other imperial symbols, representations of the seasons were since the reign of Hadrian inscribed felicitas temporum, saeculi felicitas, Empire: The Clash between the Senate and Valentinian I (Oxford 1952), and Die Kontor niaten (Budapest 1942-1943); also J.

In the last years of Trajan or the first years of Hadrian, a new iconographie type of seasons was introduced: instead of being personified in the shape of the female Horae or of Putti and Amorini, the seasons have become male youths. The first sur viving examples of this type, which is that of the Dumbarton Oaks sarcophagus and its direct ancestors (see above), are on the Arch of Benevento (after 114); it also occurs on the Arches of Septimus Severus and of Constantine the Great. The author well demonstrates how even after the Christianization of the Roman Empire the seasons, just as the sun himself, could for a while be interpreted in a quasi-monotheistic sense, as cosmic forces, neutral, so to speak, between pagan monotheism and Christianity, until they were firmly subordinated to Christ-Pantokrator within the patristic-medieval system of the cosmos. II Through what transformations did the ancient deities ? the mythological gods of archaic-classical origin as well as the cosmological and allegorical per sonifications of Late Antiquity ? live on during the Middle Ages until their original meaning was 'redintegrated* with a pictorial visualization, germane to the spirit of Antiquity, in the Italian Renaissance ? This problem forms the main subject of Professor Seznec's work on the survival of the ancient gods.1 Book I deals with the mythological concepts of the Middle Ages and with their visual forms in medieval art. The table of contents states the author's 'general arguments ' or working hypotheses: 'The ancient gods survive during the Middle Ages, by virtue of interpretations of their origin and nature pro pounded by Antiquity itself, ' and ' The true role of the Italian Renaissance in relation to the mythological material transmitted by the Middle Ages lies in restoring classical form, since, from Late Antiquity on, the manner of rep resenting the gods had undergone every variety of change. ' Expounding the first ' argument, * Professor Seznec discusses those ancient mvthological traditions which were above all continued and developed in the Middle Ages and Renaissance: the historical or Euhemerist tradition, according to which the gods had really been great men, founders of civilization, of dynasties, of nations; the physical or astrological tradition, according to which the gods symbolized the power of the stars, especially of the planets, a power which could be conceived of as subordinate to the Supreme God; the moral or allegorical tradition, according to which the gods and their anthropomorphic adventures were only 'types ' of the ethical drama of human life; finally, the encyclopaedic tradition, in which the three others intermingle and are incorporated into the Christian world view. As to the second ' argument, ' Professor Seznec works out in detail and with some new and interesting examples (greatly enhanced by the book's beautiful illustrations) a brilliant theory first enunciated by E. 1 Jean Seznec, The Survival of the Pagan Gods: The Mythological Tradition and Its Place in Renaissance Humanism and Art, translated from the French by Barbara F.

Saxl twenty years ago,2 to the effect that the Middle Ages, since they had no historical distance to Antiquity, could not see classical subject matter and form as an integral unity, while they could appreciate and represent either the one or the other separately ? so that we have many classical formal motifs in images of Christ and His saints, and many images of the ancient gods 'disguised ' as knights and ladies, but not between the ninth and the fifteenth century classical mythological subjects represented within the limits of the classical style. (According to this theory, the Carolingian 'Renaissance,' which still possessed a certain amount of integration of ancient form and subject matter, used it by way of ' quotation ' rather than of a true revival of the spirit of Antiquity.) Book II of Professor Seznec's study is devoted to the influence of mythological manuals, from Boccaccio's Genealogia deorum to Cesare Ripa's Iconologia (of 1593), upon the art and literature of the Renaissance itself. Not only Boccaccio, but even such sixteenth-century mythographers as Giraldi, Conti, and Car tari, were still largely dependent directly or indirectly upon the medieval mythographical tradition (especially, upon Albricus I and II, whose mutual relationship via Petrarch and Bersuire Professor Seznec clarifies in the tracks of a study by H. Liebesch?tz3). The age, therefore, of the Council of Trent and of Jesuit educational reform had not too much trouble in transcending the recent 'classical ' integration of the Renaissance. It did so not through a return to 'disintegration, ' that is to say, to a medieval separation of classical subject matter and classical form, but through a new moralization and allegorization of mythology.4 Poussin and modern classicism were then an escape from this new synthesis of Christianity and the classical tradition.5 From the rich content of Professor Seznec's book, only a few matters can be singled out here for discussion. One of these is the typological-moralizing aspect of mythology in the Middle Ages. As is well known, the typological (alle gorical, figurative) interpretation of Holy Scripture is the one which sees the New Testament pre-figured, ' typified ' by the Old.6 But it is not always realized that medieval mythological allegories are based on an extension, as it were, of the same typological principle : the basic idea of Eusebius that there was a Praeparalio Evangelica among the gentiles survived as well as that other idea which he expressed in the Demonstratio Evangelica that Jewish history fore shadowed Christianity. The Middles Ages, however, not only placed the an 2 E. Panofsky and F. Saxl, 'Classical Mythology in Mediaeval Art,'Metropolitan Mu seum Studies 4 (1932-1933) 228 ff.; see also Panofsky, 'Renaissance and Renascences,' Kenyon Review 6 (1944) 201ff. 3 H. Liebesch?tz, Fulgenlius Metaforalis (Studien der Bibliothek Warburg 4; Leipzig Berlin 1926). 4 The Image Decree of Trent itself deals only with sacred ecclesiastical art, rejecting both iconoclasm and lascivious representations in churches ; for documents and theological works illustrating this aspect of sixteenth-century art theory, see H. Jedin, ' Entstehung und Tragweite des Trienter Dekrets ?ber die Bilderverehrung Theologische Quartalschrift 116 (1933) 143ff., 404ff. 5 For the genesis and sequel of Poussin's classicism, see E. Panofsky, '?

Thus, one of the four traditional senses of Holy Scripture, the moral or 'tropological, ' is not without points of contact with the 'tropes ' or figures of speech of medieval grammar and rhetoric, which were often moral exemplars taken from the historical-mythological material of classical literature.7 Another point of great interest is the syncretism of classical, oriental, and Christian meanings in certain representations of the astral deities. Concerning the important role in this respect of Michael Scot, court astrologer of Frederick II, and his new image creations based on the late antique Aratea and the ' modern' Moslem astronomy, it is now possible to consult Saxl's posthumously printed introduction to the third volume of the catalogue of astrological and mythological illuminated manuscripts of the Latin Middle Ages.8 Of this work, Professor Seznec could not yet fully avail himself. He has, however, made very valuable suggestions concerning the reliefs of the planetary gods on Giotto's Campanile in Florence, where Jupiter, for instance, is represented as a monk with chalice and cross; this surprising transformation seems to be due to the influence of an Arabic manual of magic, the Ghdya, widely circulated in the later Middle Ages in Latin translation under the name Picatrix; here, Jupiter is the ruler of the western countries and, therefore, the patron of Christians. The strange and important phenomenon of the tenacious survival of the ancient gods in the Christian world order of the Middle Ages has altogether received much clarification through Professor Seznec's book, which offers both an original synthesis of previous scholarship on the mythological tradition of classical Antiquity in the medieval period and some new observations with regard to the continuity between mythographical manuals and art programs of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. 7 The original meaning of the tropological-moral sense does not yet seem to be fully clarified. Some remarks on the relations between the concepts of typus, figura, allegoria and tr?pus are found in H. de Lubac, S.J., '?Typologie? et ? all?gorisme ?, ' Recherches de science religieuse 34 (1947) 180ff. Both the typus (allegoria, figura) and the tropas in the moral sense emerge as species of the tr?pus in the general grammatical-rhetorical sense.

Bate, ' Some Technical Terms of Greek Exegesis, ' Journal of Theological Studies 24 (1923) 59ff. The roots of the equation of morals and tropology seem to lie in Philo, and they are not altogether rhetorical, for Philo uses the word in combination with for attitudes of the soul which he sees symbolized ( a ? ) by the ' alle gories ' of the Old Testament; see De spec. leg. 4.8 (114), cf. also H.

Seznec 214ff.). So, for instance, 'it is impossible to overestimate the significance of Petrarch's having turned to an Englishman, ? Albricus, ? as his authority in delineating the figure of Jupiter or Neptune. ' Professor Seznec's convincing arguments in favor of the important role of medieval northern elements in the genesis of the Italian Renaissance thus supplement E. Panofsky's distinction between twelfth-century northern proto-humanism and southern proto-Renaissance9 and P. O. Kristeller's excellent remarks10 about the humanism of the early Italian Renaissance (late thirteenth century), which grew out of the fusion of Italian residues of classical rhetoric11 with a new classical interest inspired in part by the retarded influence of elements originating in the predominantly French twelfth-century ' Renaissance ' and its thirteenth-century sequel.12 On the other hand, Professor Seznec is far from denying that other essential aspect of the Italian Renaissance (and, especially, of Italian Renaissance art), which separates it from the Middle Ages: the rediscovery of the 'animalic' beauty and strength of the human body,13 and its integration with the appro priate classical symbolism. 'We can speak of a Renaissance from the day Her cules resumed his athletic breadth of shoulder, his club and lion's skin ' (Seznec 211). The self-awareness of these 'vital' values led the Italian Renaissance itself to a ' vitalistic ' concept of spontaneous rinascit? (as distinct from spi ritual regeneration), which in this reviewer's opinion remains its unique charac teristic, for good and for evil. 9 See Panofsky's studies quoted above, and also his Studies in Iconology (New York 1939) 24. For the Norman Sicilian proto-Renaissance of the second half of the twelfth cen tury, see now the exceptionally important study of J.

Even in Tuscany there was in the latter part of the fourteenth century a temporary reaction, Byzantine-Gothic in ?haracter, against the proto-humanistic and proto-Renaissance tendencies of late thirteenth- and early fourteenth century Italy ; see the brilliant and convincing book by M. Meiss, Painting in Florence and Siena after the Black Death (Princeton 1951), where the relevant developments in art and literature are related to fourteenth-century Italian religious thought and mysticism. 13 See the very significant praise of sensual human beauty in Lorenzo Valla's De voluptate et vero bono 1.21?.</page><page sequence="8">BIBLIOGRAPHICAL SURVEYS 585 III Of the articles contained in the sixth and the seventh volume of Dumbarton Oaks Papers,1 those by Father Dvornik, Professor Grabar, and Professor Kitz inger will be discussed first, because they deal in various ways with classical survivals in Byzantium and thus are related to the studies with which the first and second sections of this review article were concerned. Professor Dvornik2 investigates the large role played by the emperors in the first seven or eight oecumenical councils. Following a suggestion made forty years ago by Battifol, and elaborating on it, he shows that the procedure followed in the councils was an adaptation of senatorial procedure in the empire. 'The emperor convoked the bishops as he convoked the senators, presided at the sessions of the council as he presided at the senate, and after making his relatio, called upon the members to state their point of view... '; but, no more than in the senate, did the emperor have the right to vote in the councils, though he confirmed their decisions. The Pope or his legates, on the other hand, held the position formerly exercised by the princeps senatus, they voted first, and their opinion was regarded as the most important. With an impressive array of sources, Father Dvornik demonstrates that many of the Popes and Fathers ' submitted to current imperialism without question ' and often ex plicitly conceded a 'priestly spirit' to emperors. He thinks that an under standing of the Hellenistic roots of such Christian ideas on rulership makes them look less formidable and threatening to the Church, even though he does not deny, of course, the dangers accompanying the lofty idea of the Christian emperor as vicar and image of God. With regard to the famous two-power doctrine of Pope Gelasius I, also Father Dvornik's paper 'Pope Gelasius and Emperor Anastasius I'3 should be mentioned, as well as the criticism by A. Michel,4 who finds that Dvornik somewhat minimizes Gelasius' role in the development of ' Church-State relations ' in the West as distinct from that in the East; on the other hand, Professor Michel admits the existence of a modus vivendi between Pope and eastern emperor so that 'einem unierten Kaiser gegen Anerkennung des Appellationsrechtes die ?berlieferte, von Chal kedon gesch?tzte Kirchenherrlichkeit in Verwaltung und Rechtssprechung be lassen wurde. ' It is not possible on this occasion to enter further into these complicated and important problems which are closely bound up with the medieval conception of the ruler as defender of the Church, as her 'temporal sword. ' I only wish to refer to Father A. M. Stickler's latest relevant study, 'Imperator vicarius Papae, '6 as it would be helpful to put the whole question into sharper focus through a comparison with high medieval canonistic doctrine. 1 Dumbarton Oaks Papers 6 (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press 1951) 251 pp., 15 plates. ?

The most important object is a large gold medallion with a figure in military garb wearing a diadem and carrying a globe and a spear with a cross, and flanked by personifications of sun and moon; the hand of God reaching down from heaven places a second crown on the head of the personage, and the personi fication of the sun offers a third (of the form of a torques). It is to this medallion that Professor Grabar directs most of his attention. However, he also establishes the prophylactic (amulet) character of the whole treasure, and sees in the small coin-like disks with a male and female bust, both crowned, on each side of a cross, which form the chain of the large medallion, early forerunners of the so-called Cons tant inata, amulet medallions of the Comneni period, showing on one side Constantine the Great and St. Helena. If the golds disks of the chain of Mersina represent Constantine and his mother, invoked as protectors by the inscription A ( e a), then it is a priori probable that the large medallion attached to the chain also is related to imperial symbolism. This is in fact proved by Professor Grabar, who interprets the central personage as the emperor-cosmocrator adored by sun and moon as representatives of East and West, of the orbis terrarum. He discusses in interesting fashion the relation of this image to the Constantinian conceptions of the emperor as ' new Helios, ' as servant of Sol invicfus and later of Christ, and to Constantine's famous, lost statue on the Forum Romanum described by Eusebius. He dates the medallion somewhat later than Constantine, but still in the fourth century, and argues for origin in the east, perhaps Syria. The frieze of running animals in the outer border confirms both the motif of the triumphant emperor, who is also the heroic victor in the chase, and the oriental provenance of the work. Professor Kitzinger^8 paper on the mosaic pavement in the transept wings of Basilica A, dedicated to St. Demetrius, at Nikopolis in Epirus is intended as the first of several studies on Byzantine floor mosaics and as a preparation for a history of pavement decoration of the period between Constantine the Great and Justinian I, which can now be written because of the important exca vations made at Antioch, Constantinople, in Palestine, etc. This interesting study has the twofold purpose of ascertaining the date and the subject-matter of the mosaics. Professor Kitzinger convincingly demonstrates from external evidence that the Nikopolis pavement panels discussed by him must be dated approximately within the second quarter of the sixth century, and not with G. A. Sotiriou in the second half of the fifth. As to the iconographical question, he interprets the landscape with trees and birds, surrounded by a zone of water with fish, water birds, and fishers, in the pavement of the north wing of the transept, as the image of earth and ocean, and the two figures carrying spears and placed on both sides of a tree, surrounded by hunting scenes and again by an ocean zone, in the south wing, as Enoch and Elijah in paradise. The meaning of the first scene leaves no doubt since the explanatory inscription is still to be read in the mosaic itself. I cannot, however, follow Professor 7 Andr?

The insci iption of the south panel is unfortunately largely destroyed, and no sug gestion as to its original reading has apparently been made by anybody. Pro fessor Kitzinger's identification of the two spear bearers as Enoch and Elijah, who were believed to have been transferred into paradise, and his metaphorical agonal-aretological interpretation of the hunting scenes in the immediately surrounding border seem very probable. He also points out the general sim ilarity in type between the Nikopolis spear bearers and Enoch and Elijah in the pavement mosaic of Cruas (late eleventh century). The paper by Professor Downey9 is important not only because it attempts to prove that Constantius II rather than Constantine the Great was the builder of the church of the Holy Apostles at Constantinople, but also because, as the subtitle indicates, it furnishes further arguments for the view, held by an increasing number of scholars, that the Vita Constantini in its present form is not by Eusebius but constitutes an expansion and a re-working at diffe rent times of Eusebius' original work.10 As Professor Downey puts it, 'in rea lizing that the Vita is not wholly authentic we actually are the gainers '; quite apart from the problem of the church of the Apostles, if it can be demonstrated that Eusebius is not responsible for certain parts of the Vita, it is no longer possible to hold with Jacob Burckhardt that he was 'the first thoroughly dishonest historian of Antiquity ' (which was in any case a very personal statement). Professor Downey gives an admirably thorough and erudite account of the two literary traditions which attribute the construction of the church of the Apostles to Constantine and Constantius, respectively, including also a discussion of Constantine's reputed intention to be buried as a thirteenth apostle. He shows that Procopius, Constantine of Rhodes (eleventh century), and Mesarites (c. 1200), all of whom ascribe the building of the church to Constantius, though of relatively late date, deserve more con fidence than the Vita Constantini and the writers dependent on it. He finally discusses the exact date at which the church was begun, and convincingly argues for 356.11 9 Glanville Downey, ' The Builder of the Original Church of the Apostles at Constantin ople: A Contribution to the Criticism of the Vita Constantini Attributed to Eusebius,' DOP 6.51-80, one plate (facsimile of a page from an Athos manuscript of Constantine of Rhodes). 10 But see also the defense of the authenticity of the Vita by so great and experienced a scholar as Pio Franchi de' Cavalieri, Constantiniana (Studi e Testi 171 ; Citt? del Vaticano 1953) 51ff. 11 Cf. the criticism of Professor Downey's paper in the article by J.

Professor Vogt bases his adherence to the common opinion that it was Constantine who built the Apostles' church largely on his interpretation of a crucial passage in Vita Constantini 4.71, in which he differs from Professor Downey. While the latter points out that it would be strange if Eusebius himself, who died soon after Constantine, had said that Constantine's tomb or remains ( a a a ) could still be seen, Professor Vogt asserts that the expression * still ' does not apply to Constantine's body or tomb, but to the prayers</page><page sequence="11">588 TRADITIO Professor Anastos13 studies the problem of the orthodoxy of the theologies of Theodore of Mopsuestia and of Justinian I, respectively. With regard to the former, he does not dispute Monsignor Devreesse's13 proof that not a few of the doctrinal statements ascribed to Theodore by the Acts of Justinian's Fifth Oecumenial Council, which condemned the Bishop of Mopsuestia post humously, are falsified; but, along with Jugie and de Vries, he feels that there is enough heterodox material in Theodore's genuine writings to make him a heretical forerunner of Nestorius. In his appraisal of Justinian's theological works and of his negative attitude to Theodore of Mopsuestia, Professor Anastos deals chiefly with one phase of the question, that of the immutability (a e - ) of Christ, which Theodore believed was not attained by Christ until after the Resurrection. This doctrine of Theodore's stands in the lineage of Arianism and, therefore, was contrary also to the Nicene Creed and to St. Athanasius' theology, the main authorities, together with St. Cyril of Alexandria, for Justinian. Professor Anastos' illuminating paper is a preliminary to a comprehensive book on Justinian's theology, in which he will no doubt utilize the recent studies by C. Moeller and by P. Grillmeier on fifth- and sixth-century Neo-Chalcedonism,14 which forms Justinian's theological background, and, per haps, also the Church-historical studies in the same work, which deal with the less defensible 'practical ' aspects of Justinian's theological activity. The two studies of Professor Vasiliev are among the last that were published by that great lamented scholar. The first15 is a sequel to his book on the Russian attack on Constantinople in 860le and deals with the raid of Oleg of Novgorod and Kiev against Constantinople in 907. The historicity of this second Russian attack, mentioned by the Russian Annals (Russian Primary Chronicle, Chron icle of Nestor), is vindicated by Professor Vasiliev with the help of additional sources, among which a hitherto overlooked passage in a work of the contem and honor rendered to him together with the apostles. Only an exact study of the syntax of the Vita Constantini would allow to decide with certainty whether the participle (rather than infinitive) construction of the passage in question favors Professo Downey's or Pro fessor Vogt's translation. ?

Regardless of this question, Professor D?rries' study is extremely valuable: among other things, it seems to me to prove convincingly against Weinreich et al. that Constantine did not see himself as a thirteenth apostle and that the later epithet a need not be taken too literally. 12 Milton V.

In his Golden Meadows, Masudi writes that Alawang (Alawandj), King of the Slavs, successor of the King al-Dir (the Dir of the Russian Annals), fought the Greeks. Vasiliev no doubt rightly identifies Alawang with Oleg; held together with the other evidence from the Russian Annals, Leo the Deacon, etc., Masudi's statement makes Oleg's raid on Constantinople indeed a near-certainty. The remainder of the paper consists of a detailed Liter?rgeschichte of Oleg's raid in modern historical literature, of remarks concerning his two treatises with Byzantium, of 907 and 911, and concerning the linking in the Russian Annals of Halley's comet of 912 to another raid which probably followed that of 907 and immediately preceded the treaty of 911. Vasiliev's second article17 is concerned with the ambition of two western rulers of the tenth century to win the hands of Byzantine imperial princesses for their sons. According to a letter preserved among the epistles of Gerbert of Reims (the later Pope Silvester II; never a cardinal, incidentally), Hugh Capet asked for a filia sancii imperii for his son Robert II of France. This project never materialized, and it is uncertain if such a letter was ever des patched. Of greater interest is the question whether or not the consort of the Emperor Otto II and mother of Otto III, Theophanou, married to Otto II in 972, was a porphyrogenneta, a daughter of Romanus II. In spite of the fact that Regino's Continuator and Liutprand of Cremona tell us that Otto I had for some time tried to obtain a daughter of Romanus II for his son Otto II, this question is answered in the negative by most recent historians, because it was supposed that, beside his sons Basil II and Constantine VIII, Romanus II had only one daughter Anna, who was a child in 972 (about nine years old) and later became the wife of Vladimir of Kiev. On the strength of Constantine Porphyrogenitus, De ceremoniis II 15, Vasiliev has now made it clear that Romanus had another child, older than the others, who may well have been a girl, and may in fact have been Theophanou. That Theophanou is called the niece of John I Tzimisces by Otto II himself at the time of the marriage (MGH, DO II 21), and later by Thietmar of Merseburg, is not surprising, since John I had married Romanus sister and was ruling Emperor in 972. The seventh volume of Dumbarton Oaks Papers is devoted to Byzantine icono clasm, with the exception of the last (fourth) study which, like Professor Vasi liev's articles in the preceding volume, belongs to political and military history. Professor Geanakoplos18 here investigates the events which led to Michael VIII Palaeologus' victory at Pelagonia over the anti-Nicene coalition of his ene mies, Michael II Angelos, Despot of Epirus, Manfred of Sicily, the illegitimate son of the Emperor Frederick II, and William of Villehardouin, Prince of Achaia. This victory, which was decisive for the reconquest of Constantinople by Mi chael VIII two years later, could, as Professor Geanakoplos shows, hardly have been won, had all three allies remained united. He sets forth the inter esting hypothesis that in order to protect themselves against the superior forces of William of Achaia, Manfred and Michael II concluded a secret treaty which aimed at William's eventual destruction. This hypothesis would explain more easily, not only the quarrel between Michel II's son John and William at the 17 'Hugh Capet of France and Byzantium,' DOP 6.227-251. 18 Deno John Geanakoplos, ' Greco-Latin Relations on the Eve of the Byzantine Resto ration: The Battle of Pelagonia ? 1259,' DOP 7.99-141.</page><page sequence="13">S90 TRADITIO eve of the battle, but also the subsequent defection of the Epirote Despot which led directly to Palaeoiogus' victory and to the capture of William; it might explain furthermore the continued help which Michael II received from Manfred even after these events. The study sheds lights also in other ways on the confused and complicated history of the Christian eastern-Mediterra nean world in the middle of the thirteenth century. The three papers on iconoclasm published in the volume are all based on lectures given at the Dumbarton Oaks Symposium on Iconoclasm held in 1951. The paper contributed by the present reviewer19 attempts to show that there is an intrinsic connection between patristic ideas of what an image is, and the image doctrine of the Byzantine iconophiles. Professor Alexander's20 important article on the second phase of Byzantine iconoclasm is supported by a new ediLion of the Horos (definition) and patristic florilegium, issued by the Iconoclastic Synod of Constantinople of 815. These survive only in fragments included in the inedited anti-iconoclastic treatise "E e a a a of the Patriarch Nicephorus of Constantinople who, together with Theodore of Studion, was the foremost fighter against iconoclasm in the Byzantine iconoclastic struggle of the ninth century (and the author of the Antirrhetici to be found in PG 100). Professor Alexander, who prepares an edition of the "E e and a monograph on Nicephorus, has identified two new fragments of the Definition and has generally improved on the previous editions by Serruys and Ostrogorsky. It is the main purpose of his paper to demonstrate that the doctrinal foundations of the ' second iconoclasm ' of Byzantium were not simply a weak replica of those of the first Byzantine iconoclastic controversy, of the eighth century. In this, Professor Alexander is more successful than previous scholars, even than Ostrogorsky, because he recognized that the patristic jlorilegium which formed part of the Acts of the council of 815, gives important cues to the iconoclasts' way of thinking. It emerges that ninth-century Byzantine iconoclasm was not as primarily centered around the image of Christ as that of the eighth century had been, but rather based on a theory of the image as such, a theory hostile to religious art images. Ninth-century iconoclastic doctrine postulated the necessity of substantial identity between an image and its model, and since such identity can not ob tain in pictorial images, they must be rejected as spurious. The only genuine and religious image of Christ or a saint is the man who is endowed with their virtues. Thus, for instance, fragment 23 of the jlorilegium of the council of 815 is understood to assert in an absolute sense (which it hardly had originally) that a true image is not one made by a painter, but man, who is made in the image and likeness of God (Gen. 1.26), and who with God's help becomes similar to God.21 The doctrine of man's image-likeness with God could, of course, 10 Gerhari .

As to Nicephorus' refutation of the icono clasts, Professor Alexander deals here only with the "E e (not with his other works), and especially with the patriarch's utilization of Aristotelian logic. All those interested in Byzantine iconoclasm will look forward with great interest to Professor Alexander's forthcoming monograph on Nicephorus. Father Dvornik,22 in his study on Photius and iconoclasm, brings proof for the continued actuality of the iconoclastic controversy even after 843. Elabo rating on the first chapters of his book on the Photian Schism,23 he describes how the ecclesiastical policy of the reigns of Theodora I, Michael III, and Basil I was to a large extent governed not only by the persistence of iconoclastic trends, but also by the deep-seated antagonism between the moderate and the radical anti-iconoclasts, which in turn created a fertile ground for iconoclastic agita tion. Photius, who belonged to the moderate anti-iconoclastic faction, neverthe less, found it necessary to have iconoclasm condemned by the Constantino politan Synods of 861 and 867, as did his opponent Ignatius in the Eighth Oecu menical Council of 869-870. Photius also treated the question of the images in some of his letters and in two homilies which Father Dvornik discusses at some length, availing himself of the new editions of Photius' letters and homi lies under preparation at Dumbarton Oaks. IV Professor John R. Martin, who is probably the foremost expert on represen tations of the monastic life in Byzantine art, has now made a valuable study of the illuminated manuscripts of the Heavenly Ladder ( a e a a ) by the late-sixth-century Sinaite monk and abbot John, surnamed Climacus after his work.1 Professor Martin's book is an important contribution both to the history of Byzantine art and to that of the development of Greek patristic ascetic ideology in Byzantine monasticism. The treatise of St. John Climacus describes the ascetic and mystical ascent of the Christian monk2 in the graphic imagery of a climb on a ladder of thirty rungs. In his upward movement, the monk is aided by virtues and angels and hampered by demons and vices; at the top, he is received by Christ. The Climax illustration, therefore, also plays a considerable role in the history of the me dieval ideology of virtues and vices and of their personifications in art. In the late-twelfth-century western Hortus deliciarum of Herrad of Landsberg, for instance, the influence of the Prudentian Psychomachia illustration combines with that of the Climax* 22 Francis Dvornik, ' The Patriarch Photius and Iconoclasm, ' DOP 7.67-97. 28 The Photian Schism, History and Legend (London 1949). 1 John Rupert Martin, The Illustration of the Heavenly Ladder of John Climacus (Stu dies in Manuscript Illumination 5; Princeton: Princeton University Press 1954) 198 pp., 112 plates with 302 figs. ?

Professor Martin examines the full cycles found in half a dozen illuminated manuscripts of the Heavenly Ladder. Among them, the most important are the Garrett Collection MS of Princeton University (late-eleventh century), the Vat. gr. 394 (same date), of which the Athos MS Stauronikata 50 (fourteenth century) is, according to Professor Martin, a direct copy, the Sinai Cod. gr. 418 (twelfth century), and the Vat. gr. 1754 (about 1200). The last mentioned codex is of interest chiefly because it also contains an anonymous penitential 'canon, ' consisting of eight beautiful odes (transcribed for the first time by Professor Martin); this canon is richly illustrated, whereas the Heavenly Ladder is accompanied by few pictures in this manuscript. Because of their relationship to the Climax illustration, the miniatures of the penitential canon, too, are analyzed by Professor Martin. In the concluding chapter of the book, 'Byzantine Monasticism and Monastic Art of the Eleventh Century,' the author makes it very probable that the pictorial Climax cycles, which do not seem to have been invented before the eleventh century, can be understood as products of that revival of Byzantine monasticism which occurred, in part at least, under the impact of the personality and mystical doctrine of St. Sym eon the Younger, called the New Theologian (died probably in 1022), who in spite of K. Holl's book and a few more recent studies is still too little known. A catalogue, finally, of illuminated Climax manuscripts precedes the plates, which are of high quality; the often almost minute marginal and vignette miniatures of groups of monks, which form the prevailing element of the Cli max illustration and which have a peculiar charm just because of their relatively small size, are reproduced very clearly. The following remarks are not meant to exhaust all aspects of Professor Martin's publication, but only to draw attention to some points with which this reviewer is more familiar. Professor Martin rightly stresses the connection between the conception of the monastic struggle for perfection and certain biblical topics. He demonstates how the concept of the monastic ladder and its pictorial representation are derive? from the angelic ladder of Jacob's dream (Gen. 28.10ff.) and its illustra tion in manuscripts of the Octateuch. Again, the tables of the Law of God, received by Moses on Mount Sinai, are parallelled to some extent by the monastic ' code ' of life, expounded by the Sinaite monk John Climacus ? in fact, he calls his work a e e a a , ' spiritual tablets. ' Certain manuscripts render these tablets pictorially, and one of them, the Vat. Ross. 251, places on them icons of the Lord of the New Law, Christ, in the guise of two famous a e a , the a and the e a . Furthermore, the faithful monk's reward by Christ on the top of the ladder is textually and pictorially dependent upon the doctrine and imagery of the Last Judgement. But the intrinsic connection between John Climacus' ascetic-mystical doctrine and its biblical substratum goes far beyond external parallels. Of relevance here is the whole conception of the perfect Christian's terrestrial renovation and tin, the important book by Morton W.Bloomfield, The Seven Deadly Sins (Michigan State College 1952), may also be consulted. (For further material concerning the mystical ladder in medieval western thought see also Mrs. GreenhnTs study, 'The Childin the Tree/ in the present volume, esp. pp. 337, 343-9, 365-9 supra. ? Ed.]</page><page sequence="16">?UBLIOGRAPH?CAL SURVEYS 593 eschatological resurrection as his return to the integrity of Adam in paradise. This is one of the central ideas especially of Greek patristic mysticism.4 In the Climax manuscripts, the idea is linked up in a very significant way with that of a a e a (translated in a somewhat pale and unsatisfactory manner as tran quillitas by the seventeenth-century translator of the Climax, Matthaeus Ra derus, S.J., whom Professor Martin follows in his rendering of a a e a as 'tran quillity ').5 a ea is the monk's achievment on the second-last step of his ascent; as Professor Martin points out, it is defined by John Glimacus as 'the resurrection of the soul before that of the body. ' It is the true Christian's freeing himself from all passions which are a consequence of original sin. Pro fessor Martin proves that the illustration of this spiritual resurrection is derived from Byzantine Anas/as/s-iconography, more concretely from the scene in which Christ extracts Adam from hell. Even that preliminary dispassionate ness (a a e a), which must be attained on the second rung of the ladder, is visualized in the Vat. gr. 394 by a picture showing Abraham and the Blessed Virgin in paradise and the resurrection of the dead. In this same codex, a a e a, thanks to which the monk can ' begin to speculate concerning heaven on earth, ' is represented as a virgin surrounded by a mandorla of glory topped by a segment of heaven. At the end of his treatise, John Climacus makes it clear that a a e a is the same as charity, that God is both charity and a a e a, and that, there fore, the monk who has attained these virtues is united with God. Finally, the last ode of the penitential canon, illustrated in Vat. gr. 1754, exults over the return of the monks to paradise; in the miniatures, they are shown as traversing the fiery, cherubim-guarded gate to dwell in the beautiful garden of Eden. Another trait of great interest in the illustration as well as in the text of the Heavenly Ladder is the conception of the life of the monk, who is the holy man par excellence, as angelic and princely: so, for instance, on the twenty-ninth rung of the ladder, where a a e a and charity reign, the monk is 'set ... with princes, holy angels, even with the princes of the people of the Lord ' (see Martin 101 and fig. 214, from the Sinai Cod. gr. 418). The idea that the Christian ascetic as ruler over the passions is the true king, is ultimately rooted in the Christian gnosis of Alexandria, and the angel-like status of both the monk and the Christian king is likewise an old Greek patristic inheritance. It is not sur prising, then, that in various Climax pictures the monk, even before his final coronation by Christ, is being awarded crowns by angels. On the other hand, both in the Climax illustration and in that of the penitential canon, the most fearful penances and humiliations are depicted in a remark ably impressive manner. Just as the Heavenly Ladder of John Climacus and the penitential canon are great and beautiful pieces of religious literature, so their illustration shows considerable power of imagination and expression, especially with regard to the monks' states of mind and body and their ascetic practices, and, in the penitential canon, also with regard to the intercession 4 See, for instance, Dom Anselm Stolz, The Doctrine of Spiritual Perfection (St. Louis, London 1938). 6 Similarly, a a e a is rendered as tranquillit? mistica by P. Trevisan, in his Italian version (with the standard Greek text), which may be added to the editions and trans lations mentioned by Professor Martin: S.

Pro fessor Martin (p. 83) is right in stating (against Kondakov) that the deliberate repetition of similar scenes does not in these cycles lead to monotony, but rather is part of their effectiveness. This is true also for the oft-repeated il lustration of the ladder motif itself ? the seemingly enormous height of the ladder (which by some illustrators is 'built up* gradually from one step to the next) and the laborious ascent of the monks enhance the latters' achievment. All in all, the illuminators through their pictures ? and Professor Martin by his publication and appraisal of the Climax illustration ? have success fully evoked the contrast between the new spiritual and eternal life ( ) to which the monks aspire, and the 'biological, ' natural and temporal life which they have left behind on the first rung of the heavenly ladder (in the a a ? *).
