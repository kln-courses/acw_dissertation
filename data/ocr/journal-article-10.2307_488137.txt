<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bila Baldzs: The Physiognomy of Things by Gertrud Koch Born in 1884 in the Hungarian city of Szeged - both parents were teachers, his real name was Herbert Bauer - Baltzs was to surface in the most diverse contexts and occupations: as a prose writer; as the librettist for Bdla Bartok's opera, Duke Bluebeard's Castle; as a friend of the young Lukatcs; as an activist in the Hungarian Council Republic; as a film critic for Viennese and Berlin newspapers; and finally even as a script writer whose products may not always have met the critical standards of the former. In short, Balatzs, like Kracauer, was a rather typical representative of the European intelligentsia of the first third of this century - an allround educated personality without steady income. Balatzs's intellectual persona was shaped by his early studies in philosophy, in particular with Georg Simmel in Berlin and Henri Bergson in Paris. Moreover, he developed a close friendship with Georg Lukatcs with whom he founded the Thalia Theater Society in 1904; that friendship, however, was not always free of discord. Lukatcs saw in Balitzs primarily a writer, rather than a philosopher, and, despite the latter's active participation in the Council Republic of 1919, expressed skepticism regarding Balatzs's later commitment to communism. For Luktcs, his friend's achievement remained that of a left-wing bourgeois writer. Such reservations also characterize his remarks on Balatzs's writings on film which, as he says in an autobiographical interview, could have been mistaken for Marxist film theory only because there wasn't much else to fit that label. Without detracting from Balatzs's personal commitment to communism, one will have to agree with Luktcs on that point. Still, Balatzs's influence on the tradition of German-language film theory is undeniable. Many of the ideas that Siegfried Kracauer was to elaborate decades later in his Theory of Film, for instance, are already implicit in Balatzs's concept of The Visible Man (Der sichtbare Mensch, 1924). And their younger contemporary, Rudolf Arnheim, whose first theoretical book, Film as Art, appeared in 1932, was to 167</page><page sequence="2">168 BMla Baldzs retrace a similar philosophical trajectory - from Lebensphilosophie through phenomenology to Gestalt psychology. In philosophical terms, Balatzs's film theory remains under the spell of his early teachers, Simmel and Bergson. Not coincidentally, he relies upon the model of an anthropomorphic poetics. Crucial to Balkzs's thought is the notion that film gives visual shape to a physiognomic quality in human beings, in animate and inanimate nature, and that film is the first medium in history capable of expressing this quality. "We see how a film can make the machine [a symbol of modern industrial capitalism] acquire a face and how, in motion, these features assume a horrifying expression. Sometimes we see how an ostensibly neutral industrial 'area' turns into a 'land- scape' full of ominous moods, a deadly animated landscape."' This observation comes rather close to the hidden aesthetic con- densations to be found in silent film, as the following example may illustrate. Explaining his method of visualization in The Lodger (1926), Hitchcock says to Truffaut: Lend me your pen a moment. I want to show you a shot, though we were never able to get it right. I showed the back of a small London news van. The back windows are oval. There were two men sitting in the front, the driver and his mate. You see them through the windows - just the tops of their heads. And as the van sways from side to side, you have the impression of a face with two eyes and the eyeballs mov- ing. Unfortunately, it didn't work out.2 A van with a face harbors a wide variety of connotations: thus, to the person who has just missed a ride, it may appear to be grinning. That kind of anthropomorphic visualization of objects, of inanimate things, permits transforming the whole world of dead matter into an animistic cosmos, rendering it as pure expression. To be sure, such a model of expression is a familiar topos in romantic and even mod- ernist theories of art. Objects of art, as Charles Taylor says in his book on Hegel, convey an expression "without necessarily referring beyond themselves." 'To return to the mocking soul inhabiting our 1.

The van expresses the mood of this character, just as the rolling bull's-eyes of the futu- rist mansion in Jacques Tati's Mon Oncle give expression to the iso- lated and suspicious life style of its inhabitants, rather than symbol- izing, in a documentary fashion, modern architecture in general. With its emphasis on expressive qualities, Balitzs's early film theo- ry hardly ventures on new ground. In the history of philosophical con- cepts, "expression," as an articulation of subjectivity, superseded aes- thetic concepts of imitation or description. Thus music became para- digmatic of a pure form of aesthetic expression, since it appeared as the only art not beset with problems of representation and imitation. Modern art's assertion of autonomy, its deliberate break with the sphere of normative and descriptive mediations, resulted in a prolifer- ation of the expressive model in artistic practice itself, epitomized by the movement of Expressionism which in turn coincided with Balhzs's first steps in film theory. The cinema presented a challenge to contemporary intellectuals by giving rise to two diverging if not paradoxical statements: (a) the novel- ty and advantage of film primarily reside in its technical repro- ducibility and mass circulation, and (b) film ranks with modern art only if it accepts the concept of autonomy and refrains from instru- mental references to reality. If the possibilities of (a) are to be realized, compromises have to made with regard to (b). This discrepancy re- sulted in attempts to redeem the cinema through, on the one hand, a critique of ideology and, on the other, aesthetic essentialism. As we shall see, Baliazs was torn between both of these options. Yet he also envisioned approaches that go beyond that paradox - beyond the sad truth that, concerning the question of cinema, the aesthetic avant- garde often sided with a politically conservative cultural criticism while politically progressive critics often endorsed an artistic instrumen- talism which pooh-poohed the principle of aesthetic autonomy. Bal~izs located the aesthetic dimension of film in the optical expres- sion it lent to its objects, a poetic argument which is conceptually endebted to the debate on "beauty of nature" [das Naturschine] in Ger- man.classical Idealist aesthetics: Not every bit of countryside is already a landscape. Nature in its objective, natural state is not. A landscape is a physiog- nomy, a face which anywhere and unexpectedly may look at us like the tangled lines of a picture puzzle [Vexierbild]. A face of an area with a particular if undefinable emotional expres-</page><page sequence="4">1 70 Bila Baldzs sion, with a precise meaning yet hard to describe. A face that seems to have a profound emotional relationship with the human beholder. A face that speaks to the beholder. To trace this physiognomy in nature's picture puzzle, to frame, to emphasize - that is the function of style in art. Framing, selection of motifs and lighting, whether available or artificial, are the human work which intervenes into ob- jective nature so as to create that subjective relationship with it which alone matters. I...] By the soul of nature we al- ways mean our own soul which is reflected in the former 1I: oo00f.] The soul and the forms of the visible are the raw material out of which Balkzs shapes his poetics of film. Nature opening its eyes, re- turning the glance - this is basically a romantic concept, a concept indebted to Lebensphilosophie. "It is the task of a director to discover the eyes of a landscape," to catch the glimpse of a city, of a person. "Such images, caught in the twinkling of an eye, have the expressive look of human eyes. Close-ups of such moments yield a subjective image of the world and succeed, despite the mechanical nature of the photo- graphic apparatus, in showing the world as colored by a temperament, as illumined by an emotion: poetry projected, objectified" (I: 91). Indeed, such passages read like Simmel's essays on culture applied to film. As a student of Simmel's, Balzs no doubt was familiar with his thought and he adapted, rather uncritically, many ideas grounded in his teacher's interpretation of modernity. Simmel's essay on Rodin - and BalWzs, too, invokes Rodin - illustrates the degree to which Bal~zs's categories depend upon a contemporary discourse on art: his primary innovation was to apply this discourse to film. Simmel's interpretation of the sculptures of Rodin is interesting in its emphasis on style, on internal movement and on psychology, all of which subvert the seeming naturalism of Rodin's work.4 Balhzs's aesthetic analysis of film takes a similar tack: the stilistic shaping of photograph- ic, mechanical reproduction, he argues, creates an expressive counterforce which undermines the seeming naturalism of the filmic image. He rediscovers in film all the familiar motifs of Simmel's essay: (e)motion, the dominance of facial expression, nature as itat d'dme, as physiognomic landscape. Pinpointing, as the unprecedented specificity of film, that capability of presenting an "animated mirror" which Simmel had attributed to modern art in general, Bal~izs was soon to depart from the mere phe- 4.

A few years later, in The Spirit of Film (1930), Balazs integrates romantic motifs with a modernist stance and defines the aesthetic possibilities of film in terms of technique rather than subject matter: How the eye and the apparatus have to penetrate the face in order to grasp that very nuance that actors find so hard to convey, even with the most precise instructions! The direc- tor must have a highly refined training in physiognomy, an education acquired especially through the use of close-ups. [II: 65] Although Bal~zs's other work focuses as much on the aspect of production as on that of reception, the underlying objective of his aesthetics remains a model of expression; the technical apparatus only figures as an expression of an 'inner' apparatus, that of the soul. Thus Balktzs elaborates under the heading, "The Optical Technique of the Camera": The camera has a number of purely optical techniques for transforming the concrete materiality of a motif into a subjective vision. [...] These transformations, however, reveal our psychic apparatus. If you could superimpose, distort, insert without using any particular image, if you could let these techniques have a dry run, as it were, then this "technique as such" ["Technik an sich"] would represent the spirit [Geist]. [II: 135] Baltizs's aesthetics of film has often been criticized for remaining fixated, by and large, upon the actor, for making human beings and their environment the measure of everything. Such a critique is based on a rather reductive reading, I would argue, since Balaizs's interest is not so much in the human being or actor as in a more comprehensive, though no less anthropocentric aesthetics of expression. After all, Bal~tzs saw the radically new aspect of film in the invention of the cam- era, its possibility of holding up a more animated mirror than any of the traditional arts. Especially pertinent here are a series of highly sug- gestive remarks about the moving camera and the ways in which it dis- solves the position of the spectator. These remarks anticipate many in- sights film theory has been elaborating over the past decade, for in- stance the inscription of the spectator in the film, the identification of the spectator's look with that of the camera. What, for instance, Balaizs asks, does it mean that the viewer cannot choose his or her own per- spective nor determine the duration and speed of viewing? Walter Benjamin, a few years after the publication of Balazs's Spirit of the Film, addresses similar questions in his influential essay, "The Work</page><page sequence="6">1 72 BMla Baldzs of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction" (1935), but never mentions Balkzs. It is possible that his many and diverse activities, which did not necessarily improve his reputation, had barred Balizs from the mutual footnoting circuit; his influence, however, is undenia- ble. One of the crucial passages in Benjamin's essay - crucial, that is, to an aesthetics of film - culminates in the well-known thesis that it is the highly artificial mediation by the apparatus which gives the specta- tor the illusion of participating in unmediated reality; the recording camera, itself invisible, can show everything: "Thus, the filmic repre- sentation of reality is incomparably more significant for contemporary man [...] since it offers, precisely because of the radical permeation of reality with mechanical equipment, an aspect of reality which is free of equipment."5 Under the chapter headings "We Are in the Picture" and "Identification," Balb'zs wrote in 1930: The camera carries my eye into the picture itself. I look at things from within the space of the film. I am surrounded by the characters of the film and enmeshed in its actions which I witness from all sides. What does it matter that I remained seated, for two hours, in the same place just as I would in the theater? I do not watch Romeo and Juliet from the pit, for I look up to the balcony with Romeo's eyes and down at Romeo with Juliet's eyes. My gaze and with it my consciousness is identified with the characters of the film. I look at the world from their point of view and have none of my own. I drift with the crowd, I fly, I dive, I ride along. And if one of the characters looks into the other's eyes, he looks down from the screen into my eyes. Because the camera has taken my eyes and and makes them identical with the gaze of the char- acters. They see with my eyes. Nothing like this kind of identification - which is stand- ard procedure in the average film of today - has ever oc- curred in any other art. [II: 56] Bala'zs's psychological observations, moreover, go beyond Gestalt theory and physiognomy, discerning a covert dimension which only film can raise to the level of consciousness. Benjamin, invoking Freud's Psychopathology of Everyday Life, defined this particular capability with the metaphor of the "optical unconscious." Although Balazs does 5.

Harry Zohn (New York: Schocken Books, 1969), 234.</page><page sequence="7">Gertrud Koch 173 not take explicit recourse to psychoanalysis - he rather travels via an interpretation of facial expression - he does arrive at a notion of the unconscious for which the camera becomes a secret writing pad. Un- der the heading of "microphysiognomy," Bal'zs notes: But the camera moved closer and, behold, within the face it reveals partial physiognomies which betray something different than the total expression had tried to suggest. In vain he knits his brow and flashes his eyes. The camera moves in even closer, isolating his chin, showing him as a coward and weakling. A delicate smile governs the total ex- pression. But nostrils, earlobes and neck have their own face. And shown in isolation, they betray a hidden crudeness, a barely disguised stupidity. In such detailed analysis, the "general impression" will not cover up. [...] The camera close-up aims at the uncontrolled small areas of the face; thus it is able to photograph the subconscious. [II: 60] These reflections must have inspired, among other things, Ben- jamin's thesis concerning the function of the film actor which is still being cited in discussions about the physical presence of actors and its special affinity with the work of the camera, the discovery of the "opti- cal unconscious." This presupposes that the camera assumes the role of an active observer rather than that of a mechanically recording ap- paratus before which the mise-en-scdne unfolds. Benjamin, for instance, considered the possibility of showing the effect of shock in a film, not by having an actor play at being startled, but by actually firing a shot and thus causing a real shock to be recorded by the camera. BalAzs's thoughts on film were to find reincarnation, not only in Benjamin's surrealistically tinged theses on film and the shock effect, but also in Siegfried Kracauer's Theory of Film (1960), albeit in a rather strange synthesis. The guiding assumption of Kracauer's book - that film is a medium of the "redemption of physical reality" - relies on a basically similar belief in the capability of the camera to retrieve some- thing from the stream of the optical unconscious which is in reality ephemeral and to redeem it in the form of a filmic image. The lines that Balkizs had begun to draw lead us, with detours, even into the camp of Critical Theory, not just Benjamin's. As is well known, the cinema was not received well among members of the Frankfurt School - with which Kracauer had little more than biographical connections. Yet, whenever Adorno does condescend ac- tually to deal with film, he is clearly indebted to Balizs's perspective.</page><page sequence="8">174 BMla Baldzs In a late essay, "Transparencies on Film" (1966), Adorno explicitly re- fers to film's affinity, as a medium, with the Kantian category of"beau- ty of nature": Irrespective of the technological origins of the cinema, an aesthetics of film will do better to base itself on a subjective mode of experience which film resembles and which consti- tutes its artistic character. [...] The technological medium par excellence is thus intimately related to the beauty of nature (tief verwandt dem Naturschinen).6 There are parallels even on a more general level of theory, independently of film as subject matter. In his posthumously edited Aesthetic Theory, Adorno again and again defines the expressive dimension as a central element in art. He undoubtedly must have had problems with Balizs's particular philosophical background, but from a historical distance we may perceive aesthetic affinities beyond Adorno's overt rejection of Lebensphilosophie as politically reactionary. Important differences notwithstanding, quotations like the following still echo Simmel: "Expression is the gaze of a work of art. [...] Art- works possess expression not where they communicate the subject but where they reverberate with the primal history of subjectivity, of animistic capability."' Balaizs's writings are fascinating to this day, partly because they do not present a theoretically coherent, closed system but rather - in the style of Simmel and his followers - read like essays, like a phenomenology of contemporary life. Like Simmel, Bala'zs directed his gaze towards the new, the modern, towards fashion. In the new medium of film, he discovered a dimension of the visual before language which, much as he preferred the silent era, includes the physiognomic qualities of sound. For this particular dimension has more to do with the specific bent of his particular philosophical background than with a particular type of film practice. Early on, Bala'zs's focus as critic - and later as a critic of ideology - was on the widespread discrepancy between, on the one hand, trivial scripts and subject matter and, on the other, the medium's expressive and emo- tional potential. Unlike many of his contemporaries, he did not allow the trivial tendency of most films and of the cinema as an institution to 6. Theodor W. Adorno, "Transparencies on Film," trans. Thomas Y.

This is cer- tainly due to the influence of Simmel, due to a general turn towards concrete philosophy which considered no phenomenon too slight and insignificant for philosophical speculation. Balizs defended even the most superficial, merely visual aspect of commercial film. Thus, he wrote in a review of 1923: When the girl, about to cancel, walks into the room deco- rated for the wedding, the wreaths and flowers, the presents and all the preparations are shown in such a way that one feels the weight of objects and facts, a weight which the soul can- not lift. Herein lies the cinematic specificity of this naive art, because it is easier to photograph things than emotions. [I: 261] In his reviews of particular films, Balizs already articulated a number of the positions he was to elaborate in his theoretical works. The latter often repeat, verbatim, passages from his daily reviews. As film critic for the Vienna paper, Der Tag, Balizs often wrote up to seven reviews a month. The object of his critique were not only the films themselves but, likewise, practices of distribution and exhibition. His style ranges from polemical fireworks to affectionate descriptions, from theoretical reflexions to poetic, metaphoric interpretations of filmic images. He was acutely aware of and explicitly addressed the problem of writing on a medium whose major quality he took to be vis- ual. His understanding of film as a medium of expression is demon- strated, on a rather concrete level, in these reviews which often derive aesthetic judgments from his own immediate reactions to a film or present them in the first person plural, as the reactions of a particular audience. This includes categories like boredom, suspense, monotony, entertainment, laughter as well as tears. In his controversy with Eisenstein ("Bela, Don't Forget the Scis- sors!"), the differences between a structuralist approach, based on the analogy of film with verbal language, and a physiognomic-expressive approach became evident, although the controversy was not really elaborated. Perhaps neither position was developed enough for any- one to realize that one excluded the other. While Balizs himself had occasionally spoken of a "language" of film, the so-called Eisenstein debate provoked him into writing a harsh critique of the genre of the "Montage Essay": Film images are not supposed to signify thoughts but to create and stimulate them. These thoughts arise in us as in-</page><page sequence="10">176 Bila Baldzs ferences rather than as symbols or ideograms already fully articulated in the image. If montage becomes little more than the reproduction of a prefabricated rebus, it is no longer productive. [...] And all we would get to see is ideo- grams and hieroglyphic essays. With such forms, film re- sorts to the oldest, most primitive kind of picture- writing - if that's the idea, why not stick to the more practical medium of phonetic writing? [II: 89j The difference between film images and logical constructs, the capability of images to convey indetermined, ambiguous expression, to provoke a multiplicity of perceptions, was more important to Balizs than the communicative and informational functions they share with written language. Thus Balitzs ultimately remained within the pale of an anthropologically centered aesthetics which assumes a basic human bent and need for expressive behavior. Therefore, his attempts at a critique of ideology and sociology of film at the end of The Spirit of Film (1930) remain schematic at best, especially where he tries to solve "The Last Questions" (a most remarkable subheading) with the pat formulas of a vulgar Marxism, in the manner of: "[...] the conditions of spiritual development are not to be found in the spiritual realm but, rather, in the economic and social base" (II: 181). Sentences like this must have prompted Lukitcs's doubts as to the Marxist status of Bal~izs's film theory. Balaizs's strength, after all, rests with his aesthetic analysis of film, his insisting upon the priority of the expressive nature of the image over its semiotic determination. At a time when, in current film theory, the linguistic paradigm has displaced phenomenological approaches, "last questions" like these still remain. Balaizs's writings undoubtedly spell out the heritage of Romanti- cism. One can draw a line from Blake's project to discover "cosmos in a grain of sand" to Balizs's microphysiognomy of the close-up. The techniques of film provide us with a laboratory of the soul. That film theory takes recourse to Romantic thought, however, also throws into relief the modernist aspects of Romanticism. The programmatic aesthetic sublimation of the everyday, rather than the pathos of the sublime, has found a medium in film. In that sense, a romantic turn also affects the concept of the public sphere: the salons and Romantic coteries give way to Benjamin's assertion that, in the age of technical reproducibility, every human being has the right to be filmed. The physiognomy of objects upon which Balhzs insists is part of such a concept. As Alvin Gouldner comments upon the progressive tendencies of Romanticism: "The Romantic view believed that the in-</page><page sequence="11">Gertrud Koch 177 significance of things was born of a failure of imagination; reality was now democratized."8 This in the end defines the latent progressive tendency in Balizs's Romantic phenomenology: the camera is the technical medium that releases the aesthetic gaze - "we are in the picture" - all positions are available and intelligible, all objects assume the dignity of aesthetic perception and sublimation. With the aesthetic democratization of reality, early film theory parallels artistic practices of the contemporary avant-garde: Eisler setting newspaper ads to music, found objects making their way into the museums. Ru- dolf Arnheim, reviewing The Spirit of Film, remarked that Balizs was de- scribing "films that do not yet exist. An abundance of inspirations, questions and perspectives wet the reader's appetite without satisfying it. Bal~zs offers an encyclopedic wealth of material for a unique aes- thetic theory of film. The book which he failed to write is excellent."9 Translated by Miriam Hansen 8.
