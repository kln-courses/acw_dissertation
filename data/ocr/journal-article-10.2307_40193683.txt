(Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 2003. Pp. x, 194. Illustrations, photographs, index. Cloth, $49.95, Paper $24.95). "Out-of-town visitors are amazed," this book remarks, "at what most Chicagoans take for granted: admission to Lincoln Park Zoo is completely free." (139) Since its founding in 1868; the Lincoln Park Zoo has remained one of the few free zoos in the world. This, plus its scenic location just north of the Loop, means that the zoo daily entertains not only visiting families, but also joggers, strolling mothers and children, and local office workers on their lunch breaks, all of whom use the zoo like a public park. Co-written by the zoo's Curator of Large Mammals, its former public relations director, and the project design director for Chicago's Millennium Park Project, The Ark in the Park tells the history of one of Chicago's great institutions from its founding to the present day; it is presented in a lively fashion that academic and lay readers alike will find accessible and rewarding. This handsome volume (it measures 8.5 by 11 inches) is lavishly illustrated, with black and white photographs on virtually every page, and includes eight pages of color photographs. The book's narrative focuses mainly on the institutional devel- opment of the Lincoln Park Zoo, though it provides along the way a number of anecdotes about some of the famous animals that have graced the zoo over the years. Some of the book's most colorful passages are stories of animals escaping from the zoo into Lincoln Park, and occasionally into the streets of Chicago's near north side or the waters of nearby Lake Michigan. When telling the institutional story of the Lincoln Park Zoo, the authors place a great deal of emphasis on the roles played by some of the zoo's more prominent directors. One of the book's most interesting sections deals with the tenure of Marlin Perkins, a passionate herpetologist who took over the zoo's directorship in 1944 and worked tirelessly to expand its collection of snakes and reptiles. More importantly, he was a public relations genius, giving talks on the radio, writing books, encouraging the zoo to adopt modern marketing strate- gies, opening its Children's Zoo, and accompanying Sir Edmund Hillary on a much-hyped 1960 expedition to Nepal to hunt for the Abominable Snowman. Perkins was also what the authors call a "visionary" (97) in 99</page><page sequence="2">his use of television; he first began working with the medium in the mid- 1940s. On his program Zoo Parade, Perkins proved himself "a natural on the small screen/' (99) and he rapidly expanded the zoo's institutional and his personal stature on the national scene when NBC picked up the program. After the show was cancelled in 1957, Perkins went on to to greater fame as the host of Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom. One of the larger trajectories the book highlights is the transformation of American zoos from simple sites for exhibition of exotic animals into leaders in the movement to promote animal conservation and preservation, a change in mission the authors suggest is one from public entertainment to public service. The discussion of these overlap- ping and occasionally conflicting functions suggests an area where the book's focus might have been expanded somewhat in an attempt to con- nect the Lincoln Park Zoo to some broader patterns in American cultural history. At one point, the authors discuss how many employees were con- cerned about the adoption of the "blues rhino, a blues-singing, sunglass- toting, urban-hip cartoon character" (149) as the Lincoln Park Zoo's new symbol. Fearing that it might be "too anthropomorphic," (149) many employees were concerned that the new symbol would overshadow the "critical conservation message" (149) they felt the zoo should be sending. The authors might have said more about this tension in the management of the Lincoln Park Zoo, and perhaps discussed how this relates to the ways in which it and other kinds of public institutions have been forced to modify their mission statements and marketing strategies in the past century. But this is perhaps asking the book to stray from its aim of cele- brating the history of one of Chicago's most esteemed and beloved insti- tutions, and one of America's truly unique zoos. This goal the book and its authors surpass in a graceful and engaging fashion. Michael Stamm is a Ph.D. candidate in the History Department at the University of Chicago.
