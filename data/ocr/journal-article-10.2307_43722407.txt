Pp. xxiv + 336. SwF 99. Since the only systematic treatment of the iconography of Northwest Semitic seals was an article written in 1941, this book establishes for itself a unique place in scholarly literature; all future work on this subject must make reference to it. All the</page><page sequence="2">COLLECTED ESSAYS 437 essays discussed below are copiously illustrated, one of the best features of a very fine book. Also extremely helpful are indexes of subjects, Northwest Semitic letters and words, and names and other legends on seals. André Lemaire, "Les critères non-iconographiques de la classification des sceaux nord-ouest sémitiques inscrits" (pp. 1-26), presents a masterful, if brief, dis- cussion of the classification of noniconographical criteria such as provenance, form and material, paleography, language and onomasticon, and their relative values. Becoming more specific, Dominique Parayre, "A propos des sceaux ouest-sémitiques: Le rôle de l'iconographie dans l'attribution d'un sceau à une aire culturelle ou à un atelier" (pp. 27-51), considers one iconographie motif, the "winged disc," as an ex- ample of the methodology necessary for analysis of seals in general. Parayre discusses whether this motif is indigenous or foreign, and where the workshops might be found (e.g., in Israel or in Sam'al). Tallay Ornan, "The Mesopotamian Influence on West Semitic Inscribed Seals: A Preference for the Depiction of Mortals" (pp. 52-73), isolates motifs borrowed from Mesopotamian iconography: combat, fantastic ani- mals, anthropomorphic figures, and mortals. She notes that seals of Mesopotamian manufacture have Aramaic inscriptions, while seals of Syro-Palestinian origin with iconographie elements derived from Mesopotamia generally avoid anthropomorphic representation of deities. Five papers deal with an "ethnic" or "national" identity of seals. Pierre Bor- dreuil, "Le répertoire iconographique des sceaux araméens inscrits et son évolution" (pp. 74-100), examines seals which are epigraphically determined as Aramaic, sub- dividing their iconographie motifs into Assyrian, Syrian, Egyptian(izing), and Per- sian categories. He suggests that the frequency of motifs representing heavenly bodies reflects Aramean appreciation of astral cults. Eric Gubel, "The Iconography of In- scribed Phoenician Glyptic" (pp. 101-29), characterizes the origin of the use of inscribed seals in Phoenicia and then discusses the chronology, materials, and dis- tribution of the seals. He also discusses the design and layout of seals, the issue of paleographical ambiguity, and ownership of seals among the Phoenician merchant class. Ulrich Hübner, "Das Ikonographische Repertoire der ammonitischen Siegel und seine Entwicklung" (pp. 130-60), discusses the manufacture of Ammonite seals, the criteria for discerning Ammonite seals, the problem of forgeries, and the Am- monite iconographie repertoire. Stefan Timm, "Das ikonographische Repertoire der moabitischen Siegel und seine Entwicklung: vom Maximalismus zum Minimalismus" (pp. 161-93), after reviewing previous studies of Moabite seals, identifies five seals with the element kmš as the only certain Moabite seals. He then relates their icono- graphical motifs to fourteen other seals which might be considered Moabite. Benja- min Sass, "The Pre-Exilic Hebrew Seals: Iconism vs. Aniconism" (pp. 194-256), presents a system for classification of motifs on some 700 Hebrew seals and stamps. He notes that anthropomorphic figures and celestial motifs are rare and discerns a trend toward aniconism during the seventh century b.c. Christoph Uehlinger, "Introduction: The Status of Iconography in the Study of Northwest Semitic Inscribed Seals" (pp. xi-xxiii), and "Northwest Semitic Inscribed Seals, Iconography and Syro-Palestinian Religions of Iron Age II: Some After- thoughts and Conclusions" (pp. 257-88), summarizes the issues and discussion. He</page><page sequence="3">438 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 57, 1995 notes the lack of methodological uniformity among the contributors and presents suggestions for further discussion and research. With regard to the issue of religion, he states that the idea of ancient Israel as an aniconic nation "is erroneous" (p. 281); while there may be a trend toward aniconism in seventh-century Israel, that same trend is found on Ammonite, Moabite, and Aramaic seals of the same date, sug- gesting that there may be forces at work besides the so-called biblical image ban.
