DE BURGH. 1. Everyone is familiar with Kant's criticism of the teleo- logical argument.* In its traditional form, it is open to the objection, anticipated by Hume, that the a posteriori evidence fails to yield a " determinate concept of a supreme world-cause." At best, the facts suggest the thought of Nature as a teleological system, a thought devoid of ontological validity, a " regulative" idea, necessary to guide the interpretation of Nature, but in no wise " constitutive " of its order. It is a principle of the " reflective," not of the "determinant" judgement. Under the guise of an empirical appeal, " the phvsico-theologians have reached their cognition by a very different road from that of experience." For the teleological argument presupposes the cosmological, which in turn presupposes the ontological. And, as all the world knows, Kant rejected the ontological argument on principle. "The subjective conditions of our thinking" cannot be taken as "objective conditions of things themselves."t 2. I have opened with this reference to Kant, because I believe his criticism, save in one vital point, to be well-founded. The facts cannot do more than indicate or confirm a hypothesis that goes beyond experienee. They do not suffice to prove a pur- posive order of Nature, let alone the God of Theism. It is true, again, that the teleological argument suffers violence if severed from the cosmological. Plato showed a sure insight, when, in * Kr.d.r.V: A 620 ff., B 648 ff. t Prolegg: ? 55. 2 L</page><page sequence="2">360 W. G. DE BURGH. proving God's existence in the tenth book of the Laws, he com bined inference from communicated (i.e., contingent) to self- initiated (i.e., necessary) motion with that from the uniformity and perfection of stellar movements to a divine mover of pre- eminent goodness. Moreover, I entirely agree with Kant in his insistence on the ontological implication. We must remember that he never questioned " the necessity, in the speculative interest of reason, to regard all order in the world as if it originated from the intention or design of a supreme reason."* Hume's objec- tions are brushed aside as irrelevant to the purely regulative value of the idea. I hope in the sequel to show that Kant was right in this view of the speculative interest of reason. But was he equally justified in the assertion that " we have not the slightest ground for assuming an object corresponding to this idea " ? t We must distinguish between the ontological argument in the restricted form in which it came to Kant from Descartes through Leibniz andWolff and its generalized form as an inference from the requirements of reason to the order of reality. The validity of the latter is the vital issue. But in any case the teleological argument rests on a priori as well as on a posteriori ground, and stands or falls with its implicit ontological assump- tion. 3. Before proceeding further, I would like to call attention to certain qualifications, especially in Kant's later writings, which have a wider bearing on the subject of my paper. (a) Despite the fact that it is riddled with fallacies-its own, in addition to those that vitiate the two other arguments-Kant invariably speaks of the argument from design as " deserving of reverence." "It is the oldest, the clearest, and the most accordant with the common reason of mankind. It animates the study of nature, as it itself derives existence and draws ever * A 686-7, B. 714-5. t ib.</page><page sequence="3">THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ARGUMENT FROM DESIGN. 361 new strength from that source. . . . This knowledge of nature again re-acts upon the idea, its cause; and thus raises our belief in a supreme author of the universe to an irresistible conviction. Hence it would be utterly hopeless to attempt to rob this argument of its authority."* Kant's democratic sympathies were, no doubt, attracted by its appeal, allied, as we shall see in a moment, with that of the Moral Law, to the unsophisticated intelligence of the man in the street. But there is more in it than this. In the Kritik of Judgement he remarks that pur- posive phenomena in nature evoke, prior to any explicit reasoning, a feeling akin to the religious, a sense of an unknown power behind phenomena, that is awesome or, in Otto's familiar phrase, " numinous."t We find an impressive confirmation of this experience in the recently published notes by Cook Wilson " on the Rational Grounds of Belief in God." Pointing out how the objections to the argument from design, which seem fatal when formulated " in a general abstract way," tend to vanish when we are confronted with the concrete facts, he writes: " We may imagine we have got rid of it as a prejudice or illusion; but if, forgetting our general theories, we are absorbed in the study of the adaptation and harmony of the various parts of a plant or animal to the maintenance of its life or function, is there anyone so adamantine that he can maintain an unemotional contem- plative or 'scientific' attitude ? Can he help feeling admiration and wonder ? Whether it be an illuision or not, the idea of plan or design and choice of means comes on us with irresistible force; we cannot shut it out."I Is there not here, I would suggest, something more than a mere emotional disturbance, something of the character of vision, comparable to that experienced by Wordsworth or Shelley in their awareness of veiled presences in nature; a vision that, if we are not unwarrantably to mutilate * A 623, B 651: cf. Kr. of Judgement, ? 91. t Kr. of J. ? 91, note. $ Statement and Inference, ii, ? 571. 2L 2</page><page sequence="4">362 W. G. DE BURGH. reason, must be regarded as intrinsically intellectual, as the revelation to knowledge of a reality ? The intensity of an emotion is, of course, no criterion of the truth of an associated belief. Yet even if, with Kant, we construe the experience in question as purely emotional, there is a certain paradox in the contrast between the strength and universality of the feeling and the logical shortcomings in the conviction that it generates; a paradox which becomes well-nigh incredible when, with Kant, we acknowledge the validity of the conviction as a clue- to the scientific interpretation of Nature. 4. (b) Dr. Kemp Smith has shown in his commentary* how Kant, when treating of the ideas of reason in the first Kritik, wavers between the sceptical position that they are merely heuristic principles, empirical in origin and devoid of transcen7- dental validity, and the truly critical position, inspired by the Analytic, that they are necessary conditions of the possibility of experience, and furnish the criteria for the distinction between the phenomenal and the noumenal. " It is difficult," wrote Kant, " to understand how there can be a logical principle by which reason prescribes the unity of rules, unless we also pre- suppose a transcendental principle whereby such systematic unity is a priori assumed to be necessarily inherent in the objects."t In the Kritik of Judgement he discriminates between the " natural purposes " revealed in phenomena of organic life and the idea of nature as a unified teleological whole, or, as Bosanquet put. it in a paper read to this Society, between "finite purposes " and "a speculative teleological system."$ The former, Kant. admits, defy interpretation on mechanical lines. "The internal form of a mere blade of grass can show, sufficiently for our human faculty of judgement, that its origin is possible only according to the rule of purposes." This recognition carries. * e.g., pp. 547 ff, 553 f, 558 ff. t A 650, B 678: tr. Kemp Smith. t Kr. of J. ? 67: Bosanquet in Proc. of Art. Soc., 1911-12.</page><page sequence="5">THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ARGUMENT FROM DESIGN. 363 with it two implications-(a) A purpose implies a purposive intelligence. To deny, as did the Epicureans, " intentionality, i.e., designed determination, to purposive production" is to reduce purpose to blind chance, in which case " nothing is explained, not even the illusion in our teleological judgment."* In other words, a purpose which is not the purpose of a mind is robbed of all its meaning. I submit that, for all the advance of biological science since 1790, Kant's words are as true to-day as they were then. (b) Secondly, he points out that the concept of " a natural pur- pose" leads necessarily to the idea of collective nature as a teleological system.t Here again Kant is surely right. Reason cannot acquiesce in a bare plurality of finite purposes or stop short of a umified speculative teleology. As Professor Taylor has recently said,T if there is purpose anywhere, there is purpose everywhere. The facts themselves point to this conclusion. Teleology cannot be confined to living organisms, but must be enlarged to cover their context and antecedents in the fields, e.g., of geology and astronomy. 5. (c) In the Kritik of Judgement, the teleological argument is handled in close association with the analysis of moral experi- ence. Kant thus justifies the reverence which it universally inspires. Moreover, its regulative use in speculative knowledge is " established " for practical reason on an ethical basis. The ontological assumption, discarded as a philosophical argument, comes by its own as an implication of moral faith. " The mere idea of God," we read in the Opus Postumum," is at the same time the proof of His existence."? The realityof the moral lawinvolves that of a teleological order, as the noumenal ground of pheno- menal nature. In the light of this assurance the empirical *? 73. t ib.

Kant certainly holds to the end by his distinctions of phenomena and noumena, and of practical and speculative reason. But is any thinker prepared to endorse them now in the rigid form in which he presented them ? The support furnished to speculative teleology by the moral consciousness retains its force independently on adhesion to the critical philosophy. Even for Kant, practical reason is reason still, with primacy to boot over the speculative; and the teleological idea, already a necessary thought of speculative reason, is " established " by practical reason in"the very heart of reality. 6. The teleological argument, then, is ontological and a priori. It is ontological, for it implies that the universe is responsive to reason's demand for intelligibility, and that the demand can be satisfied only by a purposive system. It is a priori, for its claim does not admit of empirical proof. (a) Let us take, first, the ontological postulate, postponing for the moment the question how far intelligibility implies a teleological order. The issue is not that of the inference to a personal and transcendent God, so decisively rejected by Kant; but the wider one, to which, as we have noted, he gave an ambiguous answer, of the conformability of the real to reason. I confess myself unable to understand how, when the nature of this assumption is once realized, it can be disputed by any philosopher. It is, of course, incapable of demonstration, for it is presupposed in the very attempt to prove it. It represents an act of intellectual faith, at once necessary and incontrovertible; affirmed in the act of denial. The intellect cannot question the truth of what it apprehends to be necessary; and the only necessity it recognizes is the necessity of what is perfectly intel- ligible. I would not dwell upon this point here, were it not that it has been obscured by Kant's severance of phenomena from noumena and of the regulative use of reason from the constitutive. The logical outcome of these distinctions is the</page><page sequence="7">THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ARGUMENT FROM DESIGN. 365 divorce of knowledge from reality all along the line. Such a radical dualism cannot survive a moment's consideration. The universe can present no intrinsic inexplicability for thought. Unexplained fact furnishes a problem, never a solution. In M. Meyerson's words, "reason is in essence absolute; it does not suffer anything whatever of the real to escape it; all must be subjected to it, all must appear rational; this is the funda- mental postulate of human knowledge, on which rest alike science and philosophy.* This faith in the rationality of the real is expressed differently in different ages; Dr. Whitehead has pointed out, for instance, how the belief of modern science in the reign of law has its source in the mediaeval belief in the divine reason.t But in essence it is one and the same; that thought gives knowledge, and knowledge is of the real. If I am asked, " what does this platitude amount to ? To what purpose is this waste-of words and paper ? " I reply: " at least it rules out, neck and crop, the theory of the Als ob." There is no half- way house in which the cowardly thinker may take refuge between sheer empiricism and acceptance of the ontological postulate. When, perhaps with Hegel in mind, we cavil at the doctrine that the real is the rational, it can only be because of some imperfection in the meanings we ascribe to "real," to " rational," or to both. As for "real," I am well content to borrow a phrase from Dr. Wittgenstein and define it as "what- ever is the case," only begging leave to underline the " is." What we are to understand by " rational " is the main problem of my paper, to which we shall pass in a few moments. 7. (b) The term " a priori " also must be disengaged from its Kantian associations. It does not imply independence of experience, or the divorce of the form of knowledge from its content. As Bosanquet has so clearly shown, there is no hard and fast distinction between a priori and a posteriori know- * La d&amp;duction relativiste, p. 322. t Science and the Modern World, ch. i.</page><page sequence="8">366 W. G. DE BURGH. ledge. Reason is what reason finds. The facts themselves, as facts, carry the mind beyond their apparent isolation and con- tingency. They provoke to an a priori synthesis. Apart from experience, there is no activity of reason; for reason has its being in the discovery of the rational. Even the a priori ontology of the dogmatists assumed that man was in possession of the idea of God. But, once functioning in union with reality, reason, like the experienced fact, is self-transcendent; i.e., it seeks in advance of what it has already found. Nor can it rest until it has found all it seeks. This is its a priori character, correlative with, and inseparable from, the organic unity of the object- world. There is here no contradiction, no question of an " either . . . or "; the basic paradox of knowledge, that the mind creates what it finds and finds what it creates, that its self- transcendence is the self-transcendence of the object, is charac- teristic of all the higher levels of human experience. It is evidenced alike in the inspiration of the artist, in prophetic revelation, in the lover's self-fruition in union with the object of his passion. " Either was the other's mine." In the process of actual knowledge the fusion is never complete; now the one, now the other, aspect is dominant; the vision of reason now piercing the veil of the unlknown, the nature of the real now forcing reason to break down the defacto unintelligibility. Thus the terms a priori and a posteriori win a relative justification. For the claims of reason, in their a priori character, are provi- sional; evoked initially by experience, they express the faith that the intelligible order, apprehended by anticipatory vision, is verifiable in the structure of reality. 8. An intelligible universe means an ordered universe. " Since there is a world," says Dr. Whitehead, " we know that there is an order."* The order, he goes on to tell us, is an esthetic order, and the " ordering entity" is God. My present concern is with the type of order rather than with the ordering entity, * Religion in the Making, p. 104.</page><page sequence="9">THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ARGUMENT FROM DESIGN. 367 though I shall refer to God before I close. There are orders and orders; is the teleological the type that best satisfies the demand of reason for intelligibility ? We have, first, to consider the claim of a rival view of ration- ality. Many thinkers, from Descartes onwards, have inter- preted reason, under the influence of modern science, as the faculty of logical deduction, looking to mathematical knowledge for the standard of intelligibility. On such a view, reason is essentially abstract, and its procedure consists in reducing quali- tative diversity to quantitative identity. Its ideal, in Dr. White- head's words, is " a conceptual world," which " will ultimately finds its complete expression in the equations of applied mathe- matics."* Dr. Whitehead uses this phrase to describe " the extreme subjectivist " position in epistemology; but the view is quite compatible with a realism of the Platonic type, for which the conceptual world is at once ideal and real. M. Meyerson, for instance, favours such an interpretation, when he says: " Must we, because relativism has set itself to rationalize physical reality . . . affirm that all in the real that is thus shown to accord with reason cannot be veritably real, but must belong to reason alone, which has somehow projected it beyond itself ? The most rational attitude for the philosopher to adopt to deny it would be the denial by thought of its right to think, is' it seems to us, to assert purely and simply with Plato that in mathematics thought and reality are in agreement. . . . That which is mathematical belongs at once to our reason and to nature."' 9. It would be absurd to question either the legitimacy of this procedure, which has proved so fruitful in modern physics from Galileo to Einstein, or the intelligibility that it reveals in nature, by the substitution of rational coherence for prima facie conjunctions of fact. The formulae of the mathematician with * La d&amp;duction relativiste, ? 160. t Science and the Modern World, p. 124.</page><page sequence="10">368 W. G. DE BURGH. their rigour and certainty, render reality intelligible, within the limits of their application; but where are the limits to be set? Is the real confined to what is measurable? It is not hard to see that the rational, which is the real, suffers violence when restricted to what can be expressed " in the equations of applied mathematics." 10. (i) M. Meyerson has shown that, even within the field of mathematical physics, the irreducible factor in Nature, so far from being eliminated, reasserts itself obstinately at each stage in the advance. The successive simplifications only push the inexplicability further back. The physicists, for all their debt to the mathematicians, refuse, almost with one voice, to acquiesce in the absorption of the real into mathematical abstractions. Throughout its history, modern science is Janus-faced; its appeal is, on the one hand, to mathematical deduction, on the other, to observation and experiment. The two methods, for all their intimate alliance, never coalesce. There is that about the real that declines to vanish-to adapt a phrase of M. Bergson-in algebraical, or even in geometrical smoke. Moreover, between the world of pure mathematics and the scene of its applications there is a great gulf fixed. The one is a world of logical possibles, the other of spatio-temporal events. I shall return to this dis- tinction presently, merely observing here that the chasm that severs logic from nature yawns even wider for the conceptualist mathematician of to-day than it did, a century ago, for Hegel. 11. A still graver difficulty (ii) is raised by the qualitative diversity of nature as actually experienced. This diversity is not illusion; even if it were, the illusion, as a fact, would require explanation. It is late in the day to content ourselves with the relegation of secondary qualities to mind. Dr. Whitehead's protest against bifurcation, his insistence on the objective reality of the world as revealed in the fullness of its beauty and splendour to the painter or the poet, and his justification, on this basis, of the abstractions of mathematical physics, are too well known</page><page sequence="11">THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ARGUMENT FROM DESIGN. 369 to need more than a bare mention. It is obvious, too, that a static mathematical order fails to render intelligible the creativity of Nature and the emergence of new qualities in the course of its temporal development. These features of the real, together with the unpredictable treasures of the future with which the universe is pregnant, remain, for this view of rationality, irrational fact. 12. The same is true (iii) of values. Whether, with Professor Alexander, we regard them as products of the compresence of coherent objects (and what objects are not coherent ?) to the mind; or, with Dr. Whitehead and others as inherent in nature (under the selective agency of God), values are manifestly recalcitrant to quantitative measurement. A purely mathe- matical order, as Spinoza recognized, is indifferent to values. Nor is there anything more significant, in this regard, in the history of philosophy, than his failure to keep true to his relegation of values to the relatively unreal sphere of human imagination, and the necessity that lay upon him to interpret the divine substance as possessed, sensu eminentiori, of knowledge, freedom and felicity.* Experience, in its quantitative and measurable character, provokes to mathematical interpretation, and this, be it noted, in the interest not only of practical control but of theoretical explanation. But it provokes also to the thought of a more comprehensive order. Even Kant, under the sway of New- tonian physics and before the rise of nineteenth century biology, recognized that the mechanism of Nature required supplemen- tation by teleology. 13. The mention of Kant suggests a possible variant of the mathematical idea of reason, resting on a distinction analogous * See especially the admission, in the discussion of scientia intuitiva, of reciprocity of eternal intellectual love between God and man, and the substitution of Beatitudo for Laetitia in the exposition of this perfect experience (esp. Eth. V 35, 36 and Cor. and Sch.).</page><page sequence="12">370 W. G. DE BURGH. to that between the noumenal and the phenomenal. The passage of Nature indeed defies reduction to mathematical expression; but is it not conceivable that spatio-temporal actuality is modelled in the likeness of a timeless order, which as purely conceptual is purely rational? Such a view would account for the progressive discovery of the approximation of nature to its eternal archetype, and also for the presence of an irreducible residuum of non- rational fact. It is substantially the view of Plato in the Timaeus, which has admittedly influenced Dr. Whitehead in his recent work. Now it may well be true that Nature, as a spatio-temporal process, being at any moment in its history incomplete, points by the contingency that infects it to explanation in terms of an eternal and transcendent archetype. But that such an arche- typal order cannot be merely or dominantly mathematical was grasped by Plato, who, despite his identification of forms with numbers, never wavered in his conviction that the One, the supreme formal principle in the intelligible world, was at the same time the Good. The mathematical order culminated in teleology. Dr. Whitehead endorses the Platonic view in principle. I shall return to this doctrine later, my immediate concern being with the inadequacy of any explanation in terms of a mathematical system apart from the assumption of teleology. 14. (i) I begin by noting a problem which I am not com- petent to discuss, but which seems to call for a clear word from the advocates of mathematical intelligibility. Are the ultimate principles of mathematical logic self-evident to the intellect; or are they, any or all of them, postulated as requisite for the construction erected upon their foundations ? In the latter case, selective purpose enters into the very heart of the logical order. Do they, again, form in their mutual relations a logical whole, or do they stand beside one another in irreducible plurality ? I believe that attempts have been made to present them in a single formula; but the matter remains one on which the non- mathematical philosopher badly needs enlightenment. How far,</page><page sequence="13">THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ARGUMENT FROM DESIGN. 371 again, can the indefinite multitude of possible spaces be said to present an intelligible system ? Further, when we extend our view to Dr. Whitehead's realm of " eternal objects," with its " boundless wealth of possibility,"* the lack of systematic unity is yet more evident. Qualitative diversity, e.g., of greenness from sphericality, is now admitted; but the question, why these objects in their inexhaustible plurality ? is unanswerable, for Dr. Whitehead as for Plato, save by reference to the fact of their ingredience into the passage of Nature. Their logical relationships alone are intelligible. Little wonder that for Dr. Whitehead " value is inherent in actuality."t 15. This brings me to two criticisms which I put forward with less hesitation. (ii) The ideal world of the mathematical logician has no room for values. It is a realm of classes and types of order, with their properties and relations, perfectly abstract and ethically neutral. The archetypal heaven as well as the visible has ceased to declare the glory of God. When we turn to Dr. WVhitehead's richer world of eternal objects, the issue is more complicated. Goodness and beauty must have a place there, with greenness and sphericality; and, unless they are meaningless, which is unthinkable, it seems a paradox to assert that they contribute no jot or tittle to the value of their actualiza- tion. Or are we to take, with the Platonists, a " longer " and surer " way," and solve the riddle of the status of the eternal " possibles " by aid of the " ordering entity," whose thoughts they are, and in whose eternal mind they secure an eternal actuality ? In any case, if the timeless order is valueless, it fails to satisfy reason; while, if it finds room for value, it is ipso facto revealed as teleological. 16. Lastly (iii), there is the difficulty, insoluble on the logico- mathematical terrain, of the relation of archetype to ectype, of the timeless order to the spatio-temporal actuality. Why this * Religion in the Making, p. 94. t ib., p. 100.</page><page sequence="14">372 W. G. DE BURGH. selection among possibles ? Why, again, any actuality at all ? Whatever be the status of the eternal objects, they are certainly not events. The two worlds stand over against one another in unmediated distinction, intimately akin in certain aspects of their structure, yet severed by an abyss, so near and yet so far; the one " a block universe " of abstractions, the other instinct with life and creativity. To the purely logical intellect, the antithesis presents an inexplicable mystery. Thus, here again, we are led forward to seek a more concrete use of reason, a more concrete type of rational order, that may, in some measure, (a) comprehend quality and value, (b) illuminate the relationship of the timeless to the temporal, and (c) justify, within its scope, the relative intelligibility of the mathematical view of nature. 17. The demand is for an order that expresses rationality in a form at least as full as the richest in our experience. Philosophy, as in Plato's phrase " synoptic "-the Oeapia " of all time and all being "-, has to guard unsleepingly against " the fallacy of misplaced concreteness."* The certainty and impersonality of mathematical science beguile the mind into thinking that reason finds fulfilment there as nowhere else. In the sciences as else- where, reason covers more than reasoning; the vision of faith is discernible alike in postulate and in ex-planatory theory, anticipating and perfecting the explicit processes of inference. I will not labour here how, in all intellectual, moral and vesthetic activity the intuitional factor is inseparably allied to the inferen- tial, how a rational faith and logic are complementary functions of one and the same reason. To deny intelligibility to a symphony of Beethoven or to the spiritual pilgrimage of a St. Bernard or a St. Francis, is to take the road to ruin. Its certain issue is the relegation of purposiveness and value to the limbo of mystery and superstition. There can be no question of any Kantian bifurcation of reason into the speculative and the practical. * Science and the Modern World, p. 72.</page><page sequence="15">THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ARGUMENT FROM DESIGN. 373 There are not two intelligences nor two intelligibles, but one intelligible and one intelligence. This is the metaphysical faith, " which except a man believe faithfully, he cannot be saved." The idea of a teleological system may have limitations, but it must at least fall within, not outside, the scope of reason. 18. I have referred to the natural prejudice of science in favour of an impersonal view of Nature. In the teleological argument it scents the bugbear of anthropomorphism. Certainly, ethical neutrality cannot be reconciled with a purposive inter- pretation. But it is equally certain that as human beings we cannot escape from taking human reason as the measure of our thinking. Those philosophers who, like Aristotle and Spinoza, have been most studious to rid themselves of anthropomorphism, have set mind, interpreted in the light of man's highest intel- lectual experiences, at the heart of reality. Moreover, the assumption of an impersonal mathematical order, with its impli- cation that the real conforms to the standard of our rational concepts, is guilty of the very anthropomorphism that it is devised to exclude. Naturalism is even more open to the charge, when it infers from the process of emergent evolution within the limited range of human observation to its continuance, at ever higher levels of perfection, through the illimitable universe of space-time. The true safeguard against anthropomorphism lies not in the exclusion of the interests of man's reason, but in affirming its inherent capacity for self-transcendence. Its con- sciousness of limitation presupposes, as Descartes insisted, a positive standard of perfection. The via analogica of ancient and mediaewal Neo-Platonism, with its appeal to the sensus eminentior, far from being an ignoble device of anthropomorphism, is the only refuge from its abuses. It is in the light of id quo maius cogitari nequit that we are enabled to distinguish between our purely personal wants and the naturale desiderium of reason. " The human mind has adequate knowledge of the</page><page sequence="16">374 W. G. DE BURGH. eternal and infinite essence of God."* Adequate, be it observed, but not complete. Here is the safeguard. If purposiveness be the highest form of rationality within our experience, we are warranted in holding that reality is purposive; we are not warranted in holding that it is nothing more. 19. When we turn to Nature and consider the purposiveness there displayed, we cannot fail to be struck by its pervasiveness. We find ourselves in the presence of a multiplicity of finite purposes, each of which is fragmentary and incomplete, but which are everywhere exemplified, are interlocked one with another and imply, each of them, an almost unlimited field of relevance. The term " purpose " can no longer be restricted to conscious human activities or to the behaviour of infra-human animals or of plants. Dr. Whitehead's doctrine of prehensive unity in events, bringing the atom, the electron, and even the point-instant (if such entity there be) under the category of organism, has evoked, if not a general acceptance, at any rate a sympathetic response from philosophers and scientists. Professor Alexander, with his analogy (though it be no more) of time as the mind of space, General Smuts, with his concept of creative Holism as the driving force of the universe, and our own President, with his association of the psychical and the physical along the entire line of emergent evolution, voice, in their several ways, a republication, in the light of advancing knowledge, of Spinoza's famous dietum: " omnia, quamvis diversis gradibus, animata tamen sunt."t We may say, negatively, that the word " mech- anism," in its traditional meaning, is no longer manifestly applicable to Nature; and this is why, save in reference to Kant, I have avoided it in the present paper. Positively, the concept of organism, with its implication of structures whose arrangement forms a natural whole, under a plan of combination that is more than the aggregate of the parts and that controls their functioning, * Spinoza: Eth. II, 47. t Eth. II, 13 S: cf. Alexander in Chron. Spinoz, tom. 5, pp. 16, 17.</page><page sequence="17">THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ARGUMENT FROM DESIGN. 375 is closely allied to the concept of purpose. In any case, its appli- cation beyond the field of the biological sciences to that of physics carries with it the insufficiency of a purely mathematical interpretation of the physical. Further, apart from this modern view of nature as through and through organic, the purposiveness indisputably present in human action cannot, as we have already seen, be isolated from its apparently non-purposive context. Human designs, again, imply as necessary for their actualization, the fact of law in the physical and moral worlds. A purpose would be futile, were we unable to foresee its issues on things and persons. We discover here a clue to the relation between the concrete order of teleology and the abstract order of mathe- matics. From the latter to the former there can be no passage, whereas the former includes the latter as the condition of its fulfilment. There is no contradiction possible between purposive action and physical law. Processes that can be described, qua motions, in physical terms; qua living processes, biologically; qua acts of human consciousness, psychologically; can at the same time be conceived, with perfect consistency, as the mani- festations of intellectual, moral or aesthetic purpose. No one in his senses, to say nothing of his reason, would suggest that the movements of the etcher's hand over the plate, be the hand a Diirer's or a Rembrandt's, find full and sufficient explanation in the mathematical formulae of the physicist. Yet they conform, qua physical movements, to physical uniformities. Without such conformity, the genius of the artist would lack expression; that is, it would not be at all. So, too, for the religious con- sciousness, the advance from mathematical equations to particular providences comes, not to destroy, but to fulfil. Individuality and value are thus brought within the scope of rational order, without detriment to the claims of generality. The artist's mastery is evidenced most clearly in the meticulous precision that he lavishes upon the minutise of his work. It is the same in every branch of purposive activity. There are no little things, 2 M</page><page sequence="18">376 W. G.

"Not one sparrow shall fall to the ground without your Father." 20. The purposes observable in Nature are finite purposes; and finite purposes, while they suggest the thought of a teleological system, never suffice to prove it. Nature is not, and cannot be, experienced as a whole. Yet the limitations of finite purposive- ness themselves point beyond Nature to a teleology that is both rational and real. (i) A finite purpose, as temporal, is incomplete at any moment of its history. Plan precedes fulfilment, and the art or work of art, be it ever so perfect, remains in some respect " unfinished." Each purpose, again, leads on to and merges in fresh purposes, thus revealing imperfection, not only in execution, but in intention. " There is no felicity but in proceeding." Yet the fulfilment, such as it is, is not confined to the close of the process, but is immanent throughout; in Aristotelian phrase, the process implies " act " and, thus far, transcends merely temporal analysis. Moral experience, as interpreted by Kant, furnishes an illustra- tion. The advocates of Naturalism will demur, but I am con- vinced that, in willing this duty here and now, the man wills duty universal, that the perfect measure is at once transcendent and immanent in each phase of its temporal enactment. Thus finite purposes, for all their temporal limitations, bear about them the mark of a timeless purposive attainment. They point beyond their incompleteness to an ideal purposiveness, in which perfect thought and perfect actualization are undivided moments of a single experience, and desire for the not-yet-existent is quenched in the consciousness of a good, at once willed and enjoyed in the act of volition. Purpose, it has been well said, intends perfection, never frustration or defeat.* I readily admit * Turner, Nature of Deity, pp. 85, 89, 113.</page><page sequence="19">THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ARGUMENT FROM DESIGN. 3T7 that, if we follow out this implication, the term undergoes trans- formation of meaning, and that we must discriminate, with Kant and Bosanquet, between finite purposes and a teleological whole. The former are temporal, because lacking in complete self-possession; while the latter " is the perfect and complete possession of self by self, and therefore is timeless."* But I fail to see that the transformation is illegitimate, or that the term " purpose," when used of such an " eminent " experience, is more open to criticism than the terms " life " or " spirit," which Bosanquet and Bradley admit as characterizations of the Absolute. An infinite purpose and a teleological whole are the same thing. 22. (ii) But, it may be said, an infinite purpose is a self- contradictory idea. This is, in fact, the nerve of Bosanquet's criticism of teleology. A purpose, he tells us, is " a partial pheno- menon within a totality."t It is true that finite purposes need materials and an environment that stretches indefinitely beyond the immediate field of relevance. Hence no purposive act is self-dependent; the agent's freedom is conditioned, and often thwarted, by what lies apparently beyond the scope of the intention. But we must realize the relativity of this distinction. The so-called materials or means are never merely external to the end, but rather constituents of its expression. The poet finds inspiration in the world around him; his poem is a thing he " half creates and half perceives." The sculptor, as Professor Alexander has lately told us, discovers the Hermes in the marble. This is the lesson to be learnt from Aristotle's paradox, that the form in the mind of the artist or the thinker is one and the same with the form in the work of art or the object known. Plan and execution develop as moments in a single process; as when the writer's thought wins clarity and concreteness with the words he writes. So in the moral life, the seeming obstacle proves to * Proc. of Ar. Soc., 1911-12, pp. 248-9. t Indiv. and Value, App. II to lect. x.</page><page sequence="20">378 W. G. DE BURGH. be not a thing but an opportunity; suffering appears inseparable from joy, and the self first wins free expression in the response given back from the hand or heart of another. The relation of end and means, of a design to its materials, is inadequate to describe the facts. " You cannot gather material for a purpose out of no situation."* True though this be of finite purposes, are we driven to endorse Bosanquet's conclusion that the idea of purpose in itself implies a reference to a wider whole, and is therefore inapplicable to the Absolute ? I cannot discuss this objection as it deserves, and will merely point out (a) that I entirely agree with his rejection of the answer that the materials for an absolute purpose are to be discovered in the realm of timeless " possibles. " " Possibility is within the real, not reality within the possible." t I believe that the problem of the status of possibles can only be solved on the lines of the Neo-Platonic doctrine that they are thoughts of an actual eternal mind; while (b) the key to the main issue was also furnished by the Neo-Platonists, in their teaching that the causal relation is transitive and asym- metrical, and that it is of the nature of transcendent Being to go forth from itself in creative activity.: Bosanquet has not, so far as I know, considered this alternative, so alien to the whole spirit of his philosophy. It led, in Christian Platonism, to the conception of God expressing His eternal purpose in a world other than Himself, by an act needing nought for its consum- mation save the intrinsic plenitude of His perfection. 23. (iii) Purposiveness in Nature is displayed in an indefinite multiplicity of particular purposes which, for all their intercon- nexions, defy reduction to a coherent system. Deferring for the moment the questioh of the general purposive nisuts in Nature, and confining our view to human purposes, this lack of coherence is evident both in the clash of personal and group-interests, and * Indiv. and Value, loc. cit. t Meeting of Extreme8, p. 180. $ See Prof. A. E. Taylor, on The Philosophy of Proclus, Proc. Ar. Soc.</page><page sequence="21">THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ARGUMENT FROM DESIGN. 379 within the bounds of a single individual life. When all allowance has been made for the unifying power of knowledge and goodness, on which Plato laid such stress, the aspect of conflict, in the heart and mind of the individual and in his relations with his fellows, appears more pronounced at each stage in the advance of civiliza- tion. Knowledge and goodness bring not peace only, but a sword. This fact is shattering to the dream of temporal progress nursed by so many of the Naturalist writers of to-day. But it is incident to temporality, and constitutes no bar to the conception of an ideal teleology, in which perfect unity of system is not merely compatible with, but demands, a unified plurality of wills. The analogy of " prehensive unification " on the higher levels of our experience, such as the finding of self in self by the lover or the mystic, debars us from setting any inherent limits to the possibilities of purposive coherence. 24. (iv) Purpose intends not merely coherence, but value; in the old phrase, an act is willed sub ratione boni. Reason demands the harmonious actualization of every type of value; a coherent immoral or a coherent ugly world would fall short of the standard of rationality. Here, once again, the facts of temporal experience belie the claim. For one thing, the values realized fall asunder; the verum is not ipso facto the pulchrum or the bonum, and the dictates of duty notoriously conflict with those of prudence. Further, we are confronted everywhere by the presence of disvalue. I do not propose to discuss here the problems of suffering, error, ugliness and moral evil; nor could much be said on the subject that is not familiar to my hearers. I content myself with a bare indication of their obvious bearing on my general argument. True though it be that evil tends to issue in disillusionment, that finite purposes vitiated by error or bad intention owe their transitory and partial coherence to the immanennce of something that is good, that facts of disvalue furnish material for valuable purpose and are absorbed and remoulded in the interest of good, as when the artist's vision</page><page sequence="22">380 W. G. DE BURGH. fashions out of the factory chimney and the slagheap a work of abiding beauty; yet it is only a faith which pierces beyond the temporal to the eternal that can bestow on these, its imperfect manifestations, a privileged position among the things of time. When, again, we think of man, or of all Nature, as struggling to work out a destiny that can only have spiritual value if it be self-achieved, and can only be self-achieved at the cost of suffering and evil; the thought of such an immanent purposiveness carries us beyond man and Nature to their dependence on a timeless standard. Nor can the presence of disvalue within experience be reconciled with the metaphysical or the religious conviction of the primacy of value save by aid of the same discrimination. The lesson has been taught, once for all, by Spinoza. Deny, with Naturalism, the timeless archetype; and good and evil, truth and error, fall on the same plane of actuality. If the values, which in temporal history are engulfed in a welter of disvalue, are to secure an indefeasible status in reality, it must be by acknowledgement of a timeless order, at once transcending and inspiring the course of cosmic evolution. 25. Can we offer, on the assumption of a timeless teleological order, a rational account of its relation to the world of spatio- temporal events ? We found this difficulty insoluble on the hypothesis of a timeless mathematical order. Unless teleology can suggest a solution, we are left with an irreducible dualism, in other words, with a factor of sheer irrationality. It may help towards an answer if we raise another question, arising in connexion with the facts of purposiveness in Nature, that, namely, of the subject of purpose. A purpose, as Kant saw, implies a purposing intelligence. Where is the purposing intelligence, when we pass from human to infra-human purposive- ness ? Even in man, conscious purposiveness is pervaded and upheld by what, for want of a better term, we describe as the general nisus of the universe. Bosanquet has pointed out that we cannot account for the facts in terms merely of discernible</page><page sequence="23">THE SIGMFICANCE OF THE ARGUMENT FROM DESIGN. 381 finite subjects. Or are we to refuse the title purposiveness to the instinct of the bee and to the growth of the acorn into the oak ? Phrases such as " quasi-purpose " or " unconscious purpose " simply serve to cover our affirmation and denial of purpose in the same breath. Either the term " purposiveness " is a misnomer, or it implies a mind. The problem is urgent when we find empirical philosophers speaking of a directive trend or bias in the process of emergent evolution. Professor Alexander tells us in a well-known passage that " space-time itself, by virtue of its own nisus, elaborates without forethought a " hier- archy of ministration " which, if it were produced by mind, would imply a vast and all-wise forethought of providence."* Is not this just what is implied ? Professor Alexander is perfectly consistent with his empirical method in refusing to ascribe purpose below the level of mind's emergence, and in interpreting the apparent purposiveness in terms of the survival of the fittest. Where I find it hard to follow him is in his discrimination of this criterion from that of the survival of-whatever happens to survive. Is the process, then, one of pure accident; or are we driven, in Aristotelian fashion, to a hypostasization of Nature in the abstract ? General Smuts seems to prefer the latter of these strange alternatives. His ambiguity as to the real subject of cosmic purpose is at times bewildering. Holism is a " vera cattsa," a definite guiding agency, " creative and self-creative " behind the passage of Nature; though initially it is a mere tendency which attains fulfilment in the evolutionary process.t We are haunted, here also, by the spectre of the Als ob; " it is as if the Great Creative spirit hath said: 'Behold I make all things new.' " $ Purpose, again, is a metaphor, prior to mind; yet the universe " has an immanent Telos." ? Is not Holism, * S.T.D.

DE BURGH. like all " isms," an abstract concept, a symbol for the acknow- ledged fact that wholes of increasing complexity do actually emerge; but impotent, as all symbols must be, to furnish a vera causa directive of the ordered sequence of events. What is it, we ask, that develops to these fine issues ? Not individual centres of consciousness merely, for the nisus palpably transcends these; nor a universal cosmic purposiveness, for no concrete subject of such purposiveness is discernible. How can the form of the series be one of its members, or that which is the Alpha and the Omega of the temporal process lie itself within the bounds of Time? 26. If this be true within the temporal process, it must be true also of a timeless system. Bosanquet's suggestion of an ultimate " satisfactoriness " which gives no one " satisfaction" is surely, to the eye of reason, profoundly unsatisfying. Apart from a purposing mind, such a system is an " ism," a mere abstraction, which can furnish no ground for concrete actuality. It is at this point that a rational teleology carries us forward to the thought of God. Dr. Whitehead, following in the wake of Plato, sees the necessity for this advance. If I understand aright his cryptic and all too terse pronouncements, the ingredience of eternal objects into Nature requires a controller of creativity, actual and eternal, who is the source of limitation, actuality and value. Whatever may be the relation of God to the substantial activity of Nature on the one hand, and to the eternal objects on the other, He is posited as the timeless subject of the world-purpose, a Being perfect in wisdom and goodness, analogous to Plato's God, who brings into actuality the spatio-temporal cosmos, in the likeness of the forms, and for the best. There is no question, on such a view as this, of a " block " universe or of denial of reality to time. Timeless cause and temporal effect alike find a place in the hierarchy of being. The eternal mind by a timeless act implants the nisus towards perfection in a world designed to</page><page sequence="25">THE SIGNIFANCE OF THE ARGUMENT FROM DESIGN. 383 work out its spiritual destiny through trial and error in a process of temporal self-development. I have already hazarded the further suggestion, to which, as far as I can see, Dr. Whitehead lends no authority, that the status of the eternal objects can only be determined on the line, not of Plato himself, but of Plato's followers, that they have timeless actuality as the thoughts of the divine mind. If this gloss be accepted, the theistic postu- late offers a solution-in my opinion, the only tenable solution -both to the problem of the possibility of an archetypal purpose (the teleological system) and to that of the relationship of this timeless archetype to the spatio-temporal world. 27. With this conception, unproven and unprovable, yet commended to our acknowledgement by many convergent lines of reasoning, I bring my paper to a close. Theism, like all other attempts at metaphysical explanation, is beset with difficulties, the gravity of which I have no desire to minimize. Reason, for all its power of self-transcendence, is bounded for finite minds. We cannot, for example, hope to comprehend how life is lived by an infinite and timeless being, or how such being allows of self-expansion, in the production of a world other than itself, without derogation of its unchangeable perfection.* We con- jecture but dimly, from pale reflections in the mirror of human experience, that creative love gives forth of its plenitude, yet * That this is a live alternative in metaphysics is evidenced by the whole history of Neo-Platonism. The clearest formulation is to be found in Proclus, Inst. Theol., 27. " Every true productive cause rests unaltered while its consequent proceeds from it. Subsisting in fullness and perfec- tion, it brings to actuality the order of Being subordinated to it; and this without movement, without loss, but keeping its own essence, neither transmitted into its consequents nor suffering any diminution " (tr. E. R. Dodds, Select Passages illustrating Neo-Platonism, p. 26). Christianity added creative love as the motive principle in this unilateral causality. Spinoza drew on both sources; thus harmonizing the initial definition of substance as perfectly self-contained, yet causal (essentia = potentia), with the concept of amor intellectualis Dei, wherein man's love for God is identified with God's love for man (Eth. V, 36). 2 N</page><page sequence="26">384 W. G. DE BURGH. suffers no circumscription or contraction. The faith that makes bold to affirm such things as these travels indeed beyond the limits of the argument from teleology. But it springs out of the endeavour to furnish a reasonable account of the implications of that argument. In doing so, it finds support at once in the via analogica and in the claim of reason to know the real. Reason conceives the real as a unified system that is, at least, teleological. The course of the world's history manifestly fails to satisfy the requirements of such a system. But it presents features analogous to those requirements; approximating, in its ever-creative passage, to the ideal of a rational teleology. The final goal of a process, while immanent throughout, cannot be part of the process itself. We are impelled, therefore, to think of the purposiveness discernible within Nature in the light of a timeless purposiveness beyond Nature; and this in turn as the purpose of an eternal mind, which is possessed " in an eminent way " of the qualities revealed to us in the richest of our pur- posive experiences. Thus the appeal, from first to last, is alike to a priori and a posteriori grounds. On their union, generative of a rational faith in a purposive order of the universe, rests the significance of the argument from design.</page></plain_text>
