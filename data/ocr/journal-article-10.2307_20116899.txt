<plain_text><page sequence="1">JULIET FLOYD WITTGENSTEIN ON 2, 2, 2 . . .: THE OPENING OF REMARKS ON THE FOUNDATIONS OF MATHEMATICS1 1. If we consider Wittgenstein's career as a whole, it is clear that he wrote more on philosophy of logic and mathematics than on any other subject. Yet his writings on these topics have exerted little influence. Indeed, the tide of response to Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics - which contains the bulk of his later views of mathematics - has been for the most part negative, and many able readers have concluded that Wittgenstein was simply out of his depth in the fields of mathematics and logic.2 Thus the most pressing question with regard to Wittgen stein's discussion of mathematics - addressed as yet by relatively few commentators - is, Does it offer anything at all? The opening sections of Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics are, I shall argue, the beginnings of a powerful and total reworking of a traditional philosophical picture of logic and mathematics. Witt genstein is out to question whether the hallowed earmarks of logical and mathematical truth - its necessity, a prioricity, self-evidence and certainty - may serve as the appropriate starting point for philosophiz ing, or even whether these notions, in the end, make sense. Even more, he will question the very applicability of the notion of truth to so called logical and mathematical "statements". The later Wittgenstein's conception of philosophy has long been a stumbling block for his read ers. But the very strangeness of the opening questions of Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics is highly revealing of Wittgenstein's aims: these questions are intended to slow up the too facile reasoning of the philosopher who fastens on the necessity of mathematical and logical inference as a peculiar philosophical datum. He challenges his interlocutor to explain precisely what it is he is trying to account for and what it is he is seeking. Wittgenstein's ultimate aim is to test the limits of idealized conceptions of logic in the doing of philosophy. He attacks the construal of formal logic as the overarching standard for clarity, as the basic model for the functioning of language in general, and as the key tool in the resolution of philosophical problems. (Such Synthese 87: 143-180, 1991. ? 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers. Printed in the Netherlands.</page><page sequence="2">144 JULIET FLOYD a construal was central to the work of Frege, Russell and Wittgenstein, himself, in Tractatus.) Wittgenstein is out to undercut the notion that particular claims must be made from within an overarching general philosophical conception or systematic logical structure. This means that he will continually question the urge to construe his own statements in general philo sophical terms, that is, as part of a systematic a priori theorizing about language, or logic, or thought. Wittgenstein writes in dialectical form in order to expose the character of philosophical debate over the nature of logic and mathematics. The philosopher's task, according to Witt genstein, consists in "assembling reminders for a particular purpose"3 - that is, at a particular juncture in the philosophical discussion - in order to give us insight into the workings of our language. The profundity and impressiveness of philosophy retreats from purported answers to the nature and character of the questions themselves.4 There is an impression, held by many readers of Philosophical Investi gations, that Wittgenstein's interlocutor is a straw character whose queries, assertions and claims are those of no serious philosopher. I believe that no amount of argument or methodological clarity can totally lay such objections to rest. However, Wittgenstein seems to have been acutely aware of this. As I read him, the dialectical style of his later writing - and its seemingly interminable character - reflects his conception of the problems under discussion. We are left in the end with dispensable comments, for purposes of linguistics, empirical psychology or mathematical practice, but the point of the investigation is to show that what the essentialist says about language, thought and mathematics is equally dispensable.5 This is not supposed to be demon strated by a linear argument from fixed premises. The tone and manner in which Wittgenstein's own considerations emerge - which so many of his readers find frustrating and tortuous - is internal to the claims being made. Wittgenstein's interlocutor reacts in an unguarded way, without re finement. He does not begin with a metaphysical conception. But as the interlocutor refuses, over and over again, to accept Wittgenstein's countersuggestions about the uses of various expressions, his words about "justification", "knowledge", "compulsion", "truth" and "proof" begin to take on a metaphysical cast. This is Wittgenstein's way of attempting to depict the move into a philosophical worry, i.e.,</page><page sequence="3">WITTGENSTEIN ON 2,2, . . . 145 the origin of both particular philosophical accounts and the need for them.6 Clearly, if there is such a stage in philosophizing to be un earthed, it cannot itself be made out in systematic or general terms; if someone (including himself) tried to do so, Wittgenstein would no doubt have subjected these terms themselves to the same sort of scru tiny. The roots of philosophy's demands for systematic accounts are divergent and multifarious. Wittgenstein's continued sparring with the interlocutor is meant to show this, and at the same time to portray the task of clarification as never definitively completed. The interlocutory voice is not meant to be silenced; illumination comes from the shifts and modulations of its tone and through the connections drawn between questions in the course of the conversation. The simplicity and na?vet? of the interlocutor (whose remarks, at the same time, are never foolish or off the point) is also intended to get us to ask the question, How much more sophisticated and explanatory are the full-blown theories which so attract us (including Wittgenstein himself)? It is an open question how much distance lies between a given, more refined view and the utterances of the interlocutor. And Wittgenstein intends to get us to see that this distance is always less than we might have initially supposed. The force of Wittgenstein's method - insofar as it attempts to depict the roots and seeds of philosophical puzzlement - lies in the details, the inner gropings of the exchanges between the interlocutor and Witt genstein. Too few of Wittgenstein's commentators (whether interpreters or critics) have been willing to offer detailed exegesis of his interlocutory debates (especially in the case of Remarks on the Foundations of Mathe matics) . But engagement with the text is the only way to see what the method in the end amounts to. The remainder of this paper will attempt to show, by way of example, the value of such interpretive scrutiny. My focus, after a brief discussion of the textual context of Part I of Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics, will be the first three sections of that book. In these sections, Wittgenstein attempts to unearth the roots of philosophical wonder about the nature and necessity of logical and mathe matical inference. He constantly challenges the interlocutor to rethink his (pre)conceptions of necessity, knowledge and truth so as to reflect our actual use of these notions. The intended result is to shock us into asking ourselves whether we are as clear as we might have supposed about what inference and necessity really involve.</page><page sequence="4">146 JULIET FLOYD 2. The first sections of Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics were not originally intended by Wittgenstein to stand on their own. They form the initial paragraphs of the second part of the so-called "early version" of Philosophical Investigations, composed between 1936 and 1937. This "Fr?h version" is a typescript consisting of two parts.7 The first part corresponds to a substantial draft of the first 188 sections of the final published version of Philosophical Investigations, while the second focuses on the philosophy of logic and mathematics. In 1938 Wittgenstein wrote a preface to the entire typescript and submitted it to the Cambridge University Press. Though the Press agreed to its publication, Wittgenstein never allowed the book to come to print.8 Von Wright hypothesizes that Wittgenstein's hesitation "was connected with his continued work on the second part of the book dealing with the philosophy of mathematics".9 This work Wittgenstein never lived to complete. He set aside the second part of the manuscript, reworked it,10 and finally abandoned it in 1944. It has been published posthu mously as Part I of Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics}l Thus it is clear that the text of Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics lacks some of the historical authority and integrity of Philosophical Investigations and must be used with care. Nevertheless, I believe it can fruitfully sustain detailed scrutiny. Its first three sections are especially noteworthy because they form the branching point of Wittgenstein's earlier and later drafts of Philosophical Investigations. We may think of Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics, Part I, Section 1, as initiating an alternate trajectory for the first 188 remarks of Philosoph ical Investigations.12 The first two sections of Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics are almost identical with Sections 189-90 of Philosophical Investi gations, and, as I have just said, the whole of part I of Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics originally followed (a draft of) Philosoph ical Investigations Sections 1-188. This explains its rather abrupt begin ning, which examines, as if out of nowhere, the notion of the "steps. . . determined" by an algebraic formula.13 In the framing dis cussion (i.e., the earlier sections of Philosophical Investigations and the "Fr?ftversion") Wittgenstein had embarked on a lengthy investigation into the notions of understanding, meaning and thinking in connection with our command of language. At issue is the nature of the logic of</page><page sequence="5">WITTGENSTEIN ON 2,2,... 147 our language, and in what sense our use of language may be regarded as the operation of a calculus of definite rules. Wittgenstein writes: F. P. Ramsey once emphasized in conversation with me that logic was a 'normative science'. I do not know exactly what he had in mind, but it was doubtless closely related to what only dawned on me later: namely, that in philosophy we often compare the use of words with games, calculi which have fixed rules, but cannot say that someone who is using language must be playing such a game. - But if one says that our linguistic expression only approximates to such calculi, one thereby immediately stands on the very brink of a misunderstanding. For then it may look as if what we were talking about in logic were an ideal language. As if our logic were, so to speak, a logic for a vacuum. - Whereas logic does not treat of language - or of thought - in the sense in which a natural science treats of a natural phenomenon, and the most that can be said is that we construct ideal languages. But here the word "ideal" would be misleading, for it sounds as if these languages were better, more perfect, than our everyday language; and as if the logician were needed to show people at last what a proper sentence looked like. All this, however, can only appear in the right light when one has attained greater clarity about the concepts of understanding, meaning, and thinking. For it will then also become clear what can lead us (and did lead me)14 to think that if anyone utters a sentence and means or understands it he is thereby operating a calculus according to definite rules.15 Among central questions examined in Philosophical Investigations are: What is it that we learn when we learn language?; What is it to under stand a word, or a sentence?; How is it that words, sentences, have meaning at all?; And, is the command of language itself a special kind of knowledge? These are for Wittgenstein simultaneously part of an investigation of the scope and nature of what he views as logic, that is, the logic of our language. Evidently, in Philosophical Investigations Section 81, Wittgenstein is revealing a plan to investigate the limits and presuppositions of philosophical uses of "ideal languages", including formalizations of what we have come to think of as logic, i.e., for malized languages whose grammatical structures are the truth-func tional and quantificational structures developed by Frege and Russell. In Wittgenstein's later philosophy, logical structure is not conceived of as lying behind language awaiting discovery through analysis of the proposition, the concept, or the nature of logical inference. Instead, structure is to be exhibited and elicited by "comparing" our uses of language to games with fixed rules (the simplified "language games" of, e.g., Philosophical Investigations). But this indicates that for Witt genstein our language is not itself a game with fixed rules; that is, our language is not itself a "language game".16</page><page sequence="6">148 JULIET FLOYD The example of an algebraic formula is brought into Wittgenstein's discussion in Philosophical Investigations Section 146 as a paradigm of what it is to operate in accordance with a definite rule. In the simplified "language game" of Section 143, we are asked to imagine that "when A gives an order, B has to write down series of signs according to a certain formation rule [Bildungsgesetz]".ll And now we imagine teach ing a pupil to write out the series of numbers from zero to nine. But then "the possibility of getting him to understand will depend on his going on to write it down independently"18 - that is, in his being able to follow a rule. What enables him to follow the rule? We can imagine that the pupil is unable to grasp the rule of the series; that no matter how we encourage, blame, or play with him, he simply continues on differently, all the while calling his way "going on in the same way".19 Wittgenstein emphasizes that we may imagine this,20 but imagining a scenario is not for Wittgenstein the same as understanding or making sense of it. Having a picture is not the same as using or applying it. Hence it is not clear that Wittgenstein wishes to say that we could make sense of such a case. Still, our capacity to picture it may allow us to reflect on the extent to which understanding may be fruitfully viewed as an activity governed by fixed rules - or even on the notion of what it is to operate with a definite rule in mind. The rule of an arithmetic series expressed by an algebraic formula is a paradigmatic case of something we feel we need to grasp before we are to be capable of carrying out the correct development of a series. By analogy, the understanding of a word may be thought of as the grasping of a rule for its use. Is the rule itself then a Platonic entity? How do we reach or follow out its "extension", i.e., the things or situations to which it correctly applies? According to Wittgenstein's figure of speech, the rule for use of a word must be grasped before correct responses and utterances are possible.21 What the recalcitrant pupil shows, however, is that the framing of such rules alone will not make sense of our uses of language. For even in very simple cases (like 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) it is clear that an algebraic formula will not carry within itself the understanding of its application.22 We may be tempted at this point to draw a distinction between the expression of a rule (the algebraic formula) and the rule itself.23 But then, having drawn a systematic distinction between the two, we may begin to suspect that the rule, not the rule's expression, compels and makes possible an individual's correct responses. The analogy with understanding a linguistic expression may then incline us to think that the understanding</page><page sequence="7">WITTGENSTEIN ON 2, 2, . . . 149 of the word, the rule, or concept grasped, is something other and more fundamental than any expression of the rule we can provide. The rule itself - or the understanding - determines something ahead of our applications of particular linguistic expressions. But since it is difficult to imagine what a self-interpreting rule would be, we are faced with a puzzle about how and in what sense a rule may determine its appli cations in advance.24 Wittgenstein's framing of the problem of rule-following in terms of an analogy between the use of an algebraic formula and the use of a linguistic expression is no accident, as Investigations Section 81 shows. But the analogy is more complex than either the background of Trac tatus or the text of Investigations straightforwardly indicate. For Witt genstein pushes the analogy in several different directions. In Investi gations the question of a rule's "determining the steps" ahead of time is examined as part of an effort to show the limits of conceiving of the meaningfulness of language as constituted by a set of definite rules. Various purported criteria of understanding are put forward as possible candidates for the role of "that which constitutes grasping a rule (or understanding a word)": an image [Vorstellung] (PI Sections 6, 396), a picture [Bild] (PI Sections 6, 425-6), a text (PI Section 156ff), a sound (PI Sections 6, 156ff ), a sensation (PI Sections 159-60, 243ff ), a feeling (PI Section 184), an act or way of meaning (PI Sections 188, 190), an act of intuition or insight (PI Sections 186, 213-4), an intention (PI Sections 197, 337). None of these seem to be able to constitute or explain the application of a linguistic expression on their own. But the analogy between a rule for the use of a word and the rule expressed by an algebraic formula has two sides, as the alternate trajectory of Investigations sections 1-188, in Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics Part I, indicates. And in fact Wittgen stein's investigation of the notion of what it is to grasp a rule for the use of a word is meant to shed light in the other direction: on our understanding of what it is for an algebraic formula to "determine" the algebraic "steps". The Tractatus notion that the necessity of logic and mathematics could be in some way illuminated by means of the (linguis tic) notion of grammar ("logical syntax") is still in play, though it has been substantially transformed. Now the notion of grammar is itself to be given content by way of an examination of our uses of language in particular contexts - including logical and mathematical contexts. How do we actually operate with algebraic formulas? In Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics the determination of</page><page sequence="8">150 JULIET FLOYD algebraic steps by a formula is an example of the necessity of mathema tical truth and logical inference. (In Tractatus it was intrinsic to Wittgen stein's attack on Frege's and Russell's conceptions of logical truth to view "proof" in logic in an algebraic way, as a purely mechanical transformation of symbols.25) In Remarks on the Foundations of Mathe matics Wittgenstein views the "steps" determined by an algebraic for mula, the necessity governing the development of a mathematical ser ies, and the inferential transitions determined by the rules of logic as exactly parallel. (The same German word "?bergang" is used for all three cases.) In Part I, Section 4, Wittgenstein writes: "But then what does the peculiar inexorability of mathematics consist in?" - Would not the inexorability with which two follows one and three two be a good example? and in Section 5: "But doesn't it follow with logical necessity that you get two when you add one to one, and three when you add one to two? and isn't this inexorability the same as that of logical inference?" - Yes! it is the same . . . In the initial sections of Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics, Wittgenstein seeks to "get clear what inferring consists in".26 But he seeks to undermine the idea of locating necessity in one place, that is, in a fixed structure or grammar that may be delineated a priori. Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics begins with an examination of our uses of the notion of algebraic determination in order to question the idea that we can make any general sense of what following an algebraic rule consists in. By analogy, Wittgenstein is thereby questioning whether we can make general sense of what inferring, understanding, or using a word in accordance with its grammar or meaning consist in. His attack on a fixed sense of "determination" is an attack on the idea of necessity as a clear phenomenon, and so, a fortiori, a. challenge to the idea that logic has an interesting and unique characterization. 3. In the original manuscript (the Fr?hversion) and in Philosophical Inves tigations 's version of the first section of Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics Part I, Wittgenstein is responding to the interlocutor's charge that in the preceding discussion Wittgenstein has in some way wished to deny, in a skeptical vein, that there is an appropriate sense</page><page sequence="9">WITTGENSTEIN ON 2, 2, . . . 151 in which an algebraic formula may be said to "determine the steps". The interlocutor objects, "[But] are the steps then not determined by the algebraic formula?"27 to which Wittgenstein responds, - The question contains a mistake.28 Clearly Wittgenstein wishes to fend off the interlocutor's attribution of skepticism. We need to ask what sort of "mistake" the interlocutor has made. Wittgenstein's response (with which Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics opens) makes this only partially clear. We use the expression: "The steps are determined by the formula ..." How is it used?"23 Wittgenstein's question insinuates that the interlocutor's misunder standing is about this, i.e., the use of an expression. How is calling attention to the use of an expression intended to unmask the interlocu tor's mistake? In a sense, my entire reading of Section 1 will be required to show how this might happen. There is no simple "mistake" or misuse of language involved in the interlocutor's question, and Wittgenstein invokes no theory of meaning (e.g., of meaning as use) to refute some independent interlocutory thesis. Instead, Wittgenstein immediately goes on to respond to his own question in what I shall view as six different ways. He fully knows that much of what he says will seem off the point to those who would ask the interlocutor's question. But once these responses to his own question are assembled Wittgenstein has succeeded, at least for the moment, in shifting the burden of explication onto the interlocutor, in effect making a (reasonable?) demand that the interlocutor specify what more he wants from the notion of determi nation and what more is left out to be accounted for. The first response Wittgenstein offers to the question "How is the expression used?" sounds quite behavioristic: We may perhaps refer to the fact that people are brought by their education (training) so to use the formula y = x2, that they all work out the same value for y when they substitute the same number for x.30 Wittgenstein's response suggests that the interlocutor who took Wittgenstein's earlier words to deny that the steps are determined by</page><page sequence="10">152 JULIET FLOYD the formula has misunderstood; for Wittgenstein can certainly find a use (so he seems to be saying) for the expression "the steps are deter mined by the algebraic formula". But was that all that was in question? Surely what bothered the interlocutor was not merely finding a sense for this series of eight words, but a concern that something essential to the notion of determination (perhaps its "compulsion", its "necessity", or its "rule-governedness") was being denied. Simply finding a use for an expression - particularly a use appealing so prominently to the notions of training, education and sameness of response - cannot touch that worry we may feel. So the interlocutor is bound to find Wittgen stein's answer here grossly irrelevant. Of course, this objection cannot rule out Wittgenstein's answer to the question about how the expression is used as false, or even inappropriate; and Wittgenstein's suggestion certainly raises a question about what more the interlocutor is after. Nevertheless, there are grave difficulties facing any attempt to align Wittgenstein's answer with the interlocutor's concerns. Viewed as a direct response, it seems crudely behaviorist. In fact, Wittgenstein's use of "Abrichtung", translated as "training", is bound to invite this read ing; "abrichten" is the verb for training or breaking in an animal, or coaching or drilling someone, as if by rote.31 Is Wittgenstein then denying that there is any sense of what Kant called "inward necessity" for the people computing the square of xl No. (See my discussion of this point in Section 4 below.) The behavioristic reading of Wittgenstein's suggestion is equally well invited by his second response: Or we may say: "These people are so trained that they all take the same step at the same point when they receive the order "Add 3"." We might express this by saying: for these people the order "Add 3" completely determines every step from one number to the next. (In contrast with other people who do not know what they are to do on receiving this order, or who react to it with perfect certainty, but each one in a different way.)32 Here Wittgenstein puts the notion of a command or order in the place of a formula.33 The comparison or shift from "y = x2" to the imperative "Add 3" is reminiscent of the language game of Investigations Section 143, and is intended to offer the interlocutor a kind of anthropomorphic source of compulsion which might give countenance to the idea of determination the interlocutor wishes to secure. As in Investigations Section 143, it also places the notion of truth in the background, since imperatives (like rules) are either followed or not followed, but are</page><page sequence="11">WITTGENSTEIN ON 2,2,.. 153 neither true nor false. "Determines" now means that educated people use the formula (and react to the order) as they were taught to, thereby always reacting in the same way, "with perfect certainty" at each stage. As Wittgenstein says, however, "we might" have been inclined to express the idea differently, in terms of the notion of "complete deter mination". Why might this way seem to better express the necessity or compulsion the interlocutor feels in the steps taken with an algebraic formula? Since this use of "complete determination" goes along with a reference to "every step from one number to the next", we may at first be tempted to read "complete determination" as making implicit appeal to the notion of a function. The generality of the function (i.e., its being defined for all natural numbers), coupled with its being a function (i.e., its uniquely "associating" a single "output" with a "given" "input"), then seems to provide us with an explanation of what lies behind the "determination" in the cases described. It would be natural to take the first formula, y = x2, to express the squaring func tion, and to use it as a representation of the computation of a function at a (given) point. For someone educated in elementary arithmetic, the ability to respond correctly to arbitrary inputs is then a test of their grasp of the function. Similarly, the command to "Add 3" determines our steps because the function expressed by, e.g., y = x + 3 determines a unique answer as correct. The root of our idea would be this: since a function "determines" a value for a given input (in virtue of being a function), may we not better explain how the formula "determines the steps" by saying that it expresses or denotes a function, which then does the work of "determining the steps"? In fact the word "function" [Funktion] appears nowhere in the pas sage.34 Wittgenstein's parenthetical remark wards off this Platonistic idea of "complete" determination, making clear that he means by it "complete determination of behavior", i.e., all people in this group react in the same way when asked to "Add 3".35 Although we may feel deprived of an essential concept, namely, that of a function, Witt genstein is not recommending that we substitute the notion of "having received appropriate training" for the idea of "grasping a function". Rather, he is suggesting that an ambiguity lies in the notion of determi nation. In order to be justified in postulating the existence of a function we need more than a mere formula: we need a determinate mathema tical system within which to work. This interpretation is confirmed in the remainder of the section. In</page><page sequence="12">154 JULIET FLOYD Wittgenstein's third response, he suggests an alternative way to find a use for the expression "The steps are determined by the formula . . .": On the other hand we can contrast different kinds of formula, and the different kinds of use (different kinds of training) appropriate to them. Then we call formulae of a particular kind (with the appropriate methods of use) "formulae which determine a number y for a given value of x", and formulae of another kind, ones which "do not determine the number y for a given value of x". (y = x2 + 1 would be of the first kind, y &gt; x2 + 1, y = x2 ? 1, y = x2 + z of the second.) The proposition "The formula . . . determines a number y" will then be a statement about the form of the formulae.36 Once again, Wittgenstein resists appeal to the notion of a "function". The italicized "Then we call" is meant to shift our focus from thinking about what the formulas denote (those of the first kind, as we might say, denote or express total functions on the integers; those of the second kind denote non-functional relations) to what we do, viz., define a notion of "determination" by way of our classificatory system. "The formula y = x2 determines the number y for a given value of x" becomes an expression of how we have decided to classify the formula; it is a statement about the "form" of the formula. Not, however, literally its mere shape. The activity of "sorting shapes" usually requires something like putting circles with circles and squares with squares, or like outlines with like outlines. But there is little, spatiotemporally speaking, which the shapes of formulas of the same kind in this system of classification have in common.37 The "form" of a formula is not for Wittgenstein merely its syntactic form; it is instead its kind relative to a practice in which we are trained. In this case, assuming our training in the use of particular formulas (as, e.g., in the first two of Wittgenstein's respon ses), we can reflect, in turn, on this use of these formulas and thereby be able to further sort given formulas into kinds, according to the sort of reactions trained persons (including, presumably, ourselves) have to them. Wittgenstein's fourth response, at first difficult to fathom, strikingly reveals the character and motives of his criticisms. Wittgenstein writes: - and now distinguish such a proposition as "The formula which I have written down determines y", or "Here is a formula which determines y", from one of the following kind: "The formula y = x2 determines the number y for a given value of x". The question "Is the formula written down there one that determines /?" will then mean the same as "Is what is there a formula of this kind or that?" - but it is not clear off-hand what we are to make of the question "Is y = x2 a formula which determines y for a given value of*?".38</page><page sequence="13">WITTGENSTEIN ON 2,2,... 155 In Wittgenstein's example of a classification system, particular state ments such as "This formula is of the first kind" represent elements of our (use of the) classificatory system itself. But now Wittgenstein wants us to distinguish such sentences from those such as "The formula y = x2 determines the number y for a given value of x". But on what basis are we to distinguish them? In the first case I point or call attention to a formula written somewhere; in the second I write "The formula y = x2 determines the number y for a given value of x" - But this does not seem to involve anything logically or semantically different. Both sentences are, as we would say, "metalinguistic", about a formula ("y = jc2"). The suspicion may arise here that Wittgenstein is involved in a use/mention confusion. But I think the distinction he asks us to draw, though subtle, is real. (It also illustrates the sort of distinction Witt genstein often urges us to draw in philosophy.) Wittgenstein is still bearing in mind the interlocutor's "mistake" about determination. The problem with the second sentence ("The formula y = x2 determines the number y for a given value of x") is that it is more likely to lead to the kind of philosophical worries about necessity which spawned the interlocutor's objection in the first place.39 Wittgenstein says that it is "not clear off-hand" what we are to make of the question "Is y = x2 a formula which determines y for a given value of x?". He has given us several ways in which to respond to his question about use (and there are others, e.g., appealing to the notion of a function). These ways differ in emphasizing, on the one hand, the determination (through training) of a group of people, hence their uniformity of response; and, on the other, their training in a practice of sorting formulas into those which "determine" and those which do not. In the first cases, it is the people who are (said to be) determined; in the second, the formulas (are said to) determine values; but in each of Wittgenstein's examples education (or rote training) in a practice bears crucially on the "determi nation". Thus, if the question "Is y = x2 a formula which determines y for a given value of x?" is unclear without something further ["ohne Weiteres"], namely, a choice among alternative scenarios, how much more equivocal must be the expression, "The steps are determined by the formula . . ."! And this ambiguity bears crucially on the interlocu tory question which originally prompted the whole remark, namely, "But are the steps then not determined by the algebraic formula?". Wittgenstein has not denied that there is any sense in which a formula can be said to determine the steps. (By analogy, he has not denied that</page><page sequence="14">156 JULIET FLOYD we are able to grasp rules for the use of a word.) He has instead suggested that there is not a single notion of determination (or rule governing, or rule-grasping) one could negate (or, presumably, affirm) unambiguously. Without something further the question "Is y = x2 a formula which determines y for a given value of jc?" is simply unclear-, it has no reference to any one essential thing. And this indicates the root of what was "mistaken" in the objection the interlocutor voiced. The last two of Wittgenstein's six responses are meant to indicate that although the sentence "The formula y = x2 determines the number y for a given value of x" is (as we have just seen) off-hand misleading and unclear, it is not meaningless. For, in a particular setting, the question may have an answer, e.g., [o]ne might address this question to a pupil in order to test whether he understands the use of the word "to determine"; or it might be a mathematical problem to work out whether there was only one variable on the right-hand side of the formula, as e.g. in the case: y = (x2 + z)2 - z(2x2 + z).40 In the first example we are to imagine a pupil who has been trained, like the people in Wittgenstein's first two responses, to calculate with individual formulas, and now we are trying to teach the pupil to use the system of classification outlined in Wittgenstein's third response. We may "test" whether he understands how to use the system of classification, and in this case there would be nothing misleading in asking the question, "Is y = x2 a formula which determines y for a given value of jc?". We would simply be asking the student to classify the formula according the system we are trying to teach. Wittgenstein's final response sets a "mathematical problem" to work out. A calculation shows that the variable "z" can be eliminated from the (simplified) fromula.41 In carrying out this calculation (or indeed, in using formulas like "y = jc2", or classifying formulas in the previously described way) we do not need to be clear about what the notions of necessity, compulsion, or determination consist in. Rather, we know what to do when asked. The entire Section 1, in examining the expression "the formula deter mines the steps", investigates the concept of "determination" ["Bestim mung"]. But I have interpreted Wittgenstein's use of the expression, and the examples he gives, to indicate an indeterminateness in the interlocutor's use of this notion. So there is a tremendous irony here, a play on the word "Bestimmung".42 On its own, Wittgenstein suggests,</page><page sequence="15">WITTGENSTEIN ON 2,2,... 157 the notion of "determination" makes no sense, and so offhand it is not clear what to do with either the question "Is y = x2 a formula which determines y for a given value of jc?", or the question "What sort of determination is the determination of steps by a formula?". To sum up, the interlocutor's "mistake" was to think that we have a determinate sense of determination (or a determinate absolute notion of a function). But then the idea that their is an univocal (metaphysical?) quality, logical or mathematical necessity, which may be said to compel us to assent to a mathematical sentence (such as "4 = 22") on penalty of absurdity - a quality whose character is independent of our ability to partake in particular mathematical practices - begins to crumble. The example of an algebraic formula fails to exhibit a special kind of deter mination except in particular mathematical contexts. Similarly, revert ing to Wittgenstein's governing analogy between an algebraic formula and a rule for the use of an expression, we may begin to suspect that the "determination" of our linguistic steps by our understanding, if conceived of as the grasping of a rule for the use of an expression, may not be the monolithic or clear phenomenon we are tempted to treat it as being when we wonder how it is that we can follow any rule at all. The logical necessity we think of as inhering, in traditional terminology, in the relation between a concept and its instances, and indeed, in the unity of a judgment itself, begins to slip from our grasp.43 4. Neither of Wittgenstein's final examples of uses of the expression "the formula determines the steps" seems to secure what the interlocutor was after. So, taken collectively, all six of Wittgenstein's responses to his own question about use fail to give content to the interlocutor's objection. This is Wittgenstein's point: the problem of necessity does not seem to lie in either our uses of the word "determines" or the carrying out of a solution to a particular mathematical problem. So there is a difficulty in getting a general problem about logical compul sion or necessity off the ground. But the interlocutor tries again in Section 2. Note, however, that in the opening question of Section 2 the interlocutor now uses "meinen", translated here as "to mean"; that is, how a speaker intends or means to use an expression. This contrasts with the discussion in Section 1, where one was tempted to talk about the meaning (in the Fregean sense of Bedeutung, or Sinn) of the formula</page><page sequence="16">158 JULIET FLOYD itself. In German a formula [Formel] cannot, grammatically speaking, "mean" [meinen], just as in English a formula cannot, literally "intend". The interlocutor responds to Wittgenstein's play on the ambiguity of "determines" as follows: 'The way the formula is meant [gemeint] determines which steps are to be taken'.44 The interlocutor's idea here is this: the determination of each of my particular steps, and, indeed, of the "mathematical" steps from input to output, is secured or constituted by the particular intention I have to use the formula and the particular meaning I endow or associate the formula with. This is a natural suggestion. As a description or (begin ning) explanation of how the formula "determines the steps", it has the appeal of seeming less crudely behaviorist than Wittgenstein's previous suggestions about how we are trained to use the expression "The for mula determines the steps". "Rule" is, apparently, an intentional no tion insofar as it plays the role of a guide for action. But Wittgenstein quickly presses the interlocutor on what it is to mean or intend the formula "in a particular way". He asks What is the criterion for the way the formula is meant? Presumably the way we always use it, the way we were taught to use it.45 The suggestion is that "meaning" or "intending" a formula "in a parti cular way" is itself an activity or feat accomplished by being able to use the formula, having been trained in its use. Our "criterion" for determining whether or not someone means the formula in a particular way is what they do. Wittgenstein makes his point by looking at how we incorporate into our language a sign unknown to us, but used by someone who speaks our language. Thus he says: We say, for instance, to someone who uses a sign unknown to us: "If by "*!2" you mean x2, then you get this value for y, if you mean x, that one". - Now ask yourself: how does one mean [meinen] the one thing or the other by "x!2"?46 Since the natural home of the notion of intending a formula in a particular way is just the intention to use it in a particular way, the answer to Wittgenstein's question presumably lies, so far as my view of the person using the symbol "x\2" goes, in what he does, and for me, in how I go on to use the symbol myself. I have no special experience of "meaning 'jc!2' the first way" when I do mean it; and I do not attribute</page><page sequence="17">WITTGENSTEIN ON 2, 2, . . . 159 such experiences to the other simply in virtue of interpreting his or her actions in one way or the other. Wittgenstein emphatically declares: That is how meaning it [das Meinen] can determine the steps in advance.47 So once again the use, the training, come to the fore. Wittgenstein is happy to give the interlocutor, at least for the moment, the notion of "intention" or meaning. Insofar as he compares the "truths" of mathematics and logic with rules of grammar, Wittgenstein himself assimilates questions about the special necessity of mathematics and logic to broader questions involving the relation of intention, expec tation, and desire to their (particular) fulfillments. This is indeed part of his challenge to the traditional picture of the a priori as a category of knowledge designed to account for our knowledge of necessary truth, for traditionally the relation of intention to action was hardly deemed one of a priori knowledge.48 So in addition to attempting to show the unclarity of the notions of logical and mathematical necessity, Wittgen stein's discussion restructures and broadens the field of concepts to be investigated in connection with the apparent necessity and full-blooded truthfulness of logic. This shifts the traditional epistemological frame work for discussing the character of mathematics and logic. For Witt genstein, Platonism in mathematics makes no more and no less sense than Platonism about meaning, desire, or intention. This is borne out in Investigations Section 437, where he writes: A wish seems already to know what will or would satisfy it; a proposition, a thought, what makes it true - even when that thing is not there at all! Whence this determining [Bestimmen] of what is not yet there? This despotic demand? ("The hardness of the logical must. ) My reading of the first two sections of Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics indicates at least the beginnings of an answer to the ques tion whether Wittgenstein is ultimately offering a behaviorist or conven tionalist account of logical inference and mathematical necessity.50 The answer he would give to such a question would be another question, viz., "Convention (or behavior) as opposed to what?". The opposed notion ("nature", "mind", "inner" "feeling", etc.) may be seen, with appropriate scrutiny, to suffer from the same unclarity as the notions of "conventional" and "behavior" themselves. The other side of absolute arbitrariness is absolute necessity, absolute determination or compul sion. And these are the notions I have argued Wittgenstein is trying to</page><page sequence="18">160 JULIET FLOYD unmask as unclear in the first two sections of Remarks on the Foun dations of Mathematics. 5. Wittgenstein's emphasis on our criteria for ascribing intentions and his example of the introduction of an unknown symbol into our language fail to unearth what has struck the interlocutor. Obviously we can define or find a meaning for the sign "jc!2" in particular cases like the one described. But this does not get at the peculiar compulsion, the sense of what must happen, the idea that something must be fixed ahead of our particular steps in virtue of the ways in which we mean, or intend to mean, the formulas (or, for that matter, the words) we are now operating with.51 Wittgenstein's emphatic remark that "That is how meaning it can determine the steps in advance" was intended to call attention to the fact that our criteria for determining "the way" someone intends or means an expression lie in what they (and we) do. But now a natural response to this is to ask How is it that he (or /) know what to do? Is Wittgenstein denying that we may say that someone who understands an expression knows what to do with it ahead of time? This is the kind of worry which prompts Wittgenstein to suggest, in Section 3, that the interlocutor pose the following question to himself: How do I know [Wie weiss ich] that in working out the series +2 I must write "20004,20006" and not ? "20004,20008"?52 Unlike the questions Wittgenstein posed to the interlocutor in Section 2, this first-person question is inflicted on a sign I already know how to use ("+2"). Thus it may seem to demand a different sort of answer than the one about "jc!2". Indeed, in the course of the ensuing passage Wittgenstein will try to elicit from his reader a sense that this is not the straightforward question it might appear to be: construed in the most natural way it is empty, that is, "How do I know..." is out of place here. What sort of "emptiness" is in question? In this case Wittgenstein does not, nor do I for him, appeal to an absolute standard of emptiness. (Wittgenstein had invoked something like such a standard in Tractatus in connection with the doctrine of a "formal", or "in ternal", relation holding between the members of a "formal" series.)53</page><page sequence="19">WITTGENSTEIN ON 2,2,... 161 Still, the relation(s) between the members of a series such as +2 is thought of by the later Wittgenstein as in some sense or another "gram matical".54 Our question is, What does this idea amount to in Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics! One can, upon reflection, imagine circumstances in which "How do I know to write . . .?" might have a point. For example, it might arise in the writing of a step in an algebraic series whose generating principle was especially complex or difficult (e.g., if I found myself computing differently each time I tried to determine the correct next step). In this case, "How do I know that in working out this series that this is the correct next step?" might be answered with several calculations worked out on paper. Similarly, a child learning arithmetic might reasonably pose this question. On the other hand, the rule or law of the series considered here (+2) is familiar and easy. I seem to be so certain that "20004,20006" is the correct thing to write that a calculation would seem superfluous, ad hoc - hardly informative about this particular step. This is part of Wittgenstein's point. The interlocutor continues to feel that Wittgenstein is denying some thing. He responds to the question "How do I know that in working out the series +2 I must write "20004,20006"?", as if Wittgenstein is endorsing a skeptical view. But you surely know for example that you must always write the same sequence of numbers in the digits: 2,4,6,8,0,2,4, etc. The interlocutor seeks to find some basis or justification for writing "20006" at the 10,003d step of the series. He locates his confidence in the repeating pattern of right-most digits of numerals in the series, thus hoping to circumvent worries about the infinite length of the series and his (apparently) unlimited capacity to continue writing different numerals in the correct order. Wittgenstein accepts this response as "Quite true!" ("Ganz richtigl", "Completely correct!"), and then, pushing the interlocutor's idea one step further, turns the purported answer against him: The problem must already appear in this sequence, and even in this one: 2,2,2,2, etc. - For how do I know that I am to write "2" after the five hundredth "2"? And if I know it in advance, what use is this knowledge to me later on? I mean: how do I know what to do with this earlier knowledge when the step actually has to be taken? What is "the problem"? A regress arises because the interlocutor</page><page sequence="20">162 JULIET FLOYD supposes that he knows something in advance of the step's being taken, something different from the taking of the step itself. He supposes that he holds a belief which leads him to act. The case of the recalcitrant pupil (PI Sections 143, 185) is brought home to the first person: Wittgenstein's question places a seeming gap between my knowledge of a general principle and its application, thus inviting a "Third Man" argument which asks, each time I try to apply my knowledge, how I know that this application is correct. At each particular step, when I try to say how I know that this is the next correct step in the series, my answers seem thinner than my conviction. And if there is trouble with the series 2,2, 2 . . . , then will there not be trouble, i.e., trouble in saying how I know, in every case? Wittgenstein's new question ("How do I know that I am to write "2" after the 500th "2"?") seems to raise a general wonder about how knowing the principle of any series tells me what to do in the particular case. How can I follow any rule at all?55 In fact, however, the example seems to just as easily cut the other way. Just because there is no problem (other than boredom or exhaus tion or pointlessness) with my writing the 500th "2" in the series 2, 2,2 . . . , it seems foolish to allow such worries to creep in about the 10,003d step in the series +2 - or at least, to view such questions as carrying the same force with them as grammatically analogous "How do I know. . .?" questions raised about matters of genuine arithmetic or empirical difficulty. Admittedly, Wittgenstein's reduction of "the problem" to the case of 2, 2, 2 . . . draws a somewhat daring analogy between the series +2 and the series +0 - if that is how we want to view my writing of 500 "2s". The series +0 is a limiting case, requiring, as we should ordinarily say, no calculation at all from step to step. In fact, it appears that nothing specifically mathematical is required to continue; i.e., no special kind of knowledge that, say, my writing out of a series of repeating color hues, or shapes, or repeating letter a's (a, a, a, a . . .) does not require. I have an idea in such cases that I write "the simplest" or "the most natural" pattern,56 but this does not pro vide me with knowledge of something specific which compels me at this particular step. The interlocutor's attempt to answer the original question about "20004,20006" directly by insisting that I ought to do "the same" (writing digits in the pattern 2,4,6,8,2,4. . .) evidently presupposes the knowledge or capacity in question. Thus it yields no independently informative answer. This is because knowing that</page><page sequence="21">WITTGENSTEIN ON 2, 2, . . . 163 "20006" is the numeral to write in order to "go on in the same way" at the 10,003d place is just (part of) what it is to know that this is the series " + 2" starting with 0.57 Suppose I exhibited confusion at the 10,003d step. To get this far successfully and then hesitate would proba bly look most like exhaustion, not error. But if it did not seem to be a mental seizure of some kind (e.g., I cheerfully chew on my pencil, giving every indication of thinking hard) I would, barring special cir cumstances, (be said to) not understand the series. So far as other people's views of me goes, my knowledge of the general and knowledge of the particular go hand in hand here. And even for myself, my wondering how I know what to do in the particular case is inseparable from wondering whether I grasp the series itself. But the "How do I know . . .?" question, as phrased, makes it look like my knowledge of the series has to hook up with, or fit into, my knowledge of the parti cular step. It is as if what the rule actually consists in is two things: the general principle and the atomic points in reality which fit its demands. However, while I can memorize a formula and call it "the formula of a series", I am not without further ado said to understand the formula unless I can operate with it. And if I operate with the series well enough to convince myself, my teachers and other speakers that I have grasped the principle, what more is needed? The question about what to do at the 10,003d (or the 500th) step, if viewed as opening up a doubt of some kind, begins to look absurd, like the question "How do I know that this thing is identical with itself?". One is tempted to say that this is simply what working out the series 4-2 (or what identity) is, amounts to, or comes to. This will not give me an informative answer to the question or a justification for taking this particular step in the way I do - much less a general defense of the practice of calculating with rules.58 Nothing (in particular) does. But so far, nothing is needed. "How do I know that in writing out 500 "2s" I should write "2" at the 500th step?". The question is empty - unless it is taken as a neurophysiological question, or a question about purported "mental machinery". (I shall discuss this way of giving the question content below.) Hence Wittgenstein's parenthetical remark, (If intuition is needed to continue the series +1, then it is also needed to continue the series +0.)59 Wittgenstein wants to undermine both the idea that a justification is required for each particular step in the number series and that in the</page><page sequence="22">164 JULIET FLOYD absence of such justification a special appeal to intuition is the only recourse.60 But the interlocutor reacts to Wittgenstein's move to 2, 2, 2 ... as if Wittgenstein is denying that he knows what to write at the 10,003d step of the series +2: But do you mean to say that the expression " + 2" leaves you in doubt what you are to do e.g. after 2004?61 Wittgenstein reacts sharply: - No; I answer "2006" without hesitation. But just for that reason [aber darum] it is superfluous [?berfl?ssig] to suppose that this was determined earlier on. My having no doubt in face of the question does not mean that it has been answered in advance. We need to get to the bottom of this "superfluousness". Wittgenstein says that he answers "2006" "without hesitation", "ohne Bedenken", without thinking over or considering anything. The analogy between the step to "2004" from "2002" and the 500th 2 in the series 2, 2, 2 . . . helps make Wittgenstein's point clearer. In the case of 500 2s, there is a real sense in which no thought can be brought to bear at the 500th step. Something rote governs the process. Unlike an initial segment of a series whose principle requires some kind of calculation, 2, 2, 2 . . . requires no guess, no inference, no thought at all between steps. My actions may become mechanical and they may remain mechanical. So Wittgenstein seems to be saying, with the writing of "20006" at the 10,003d step of working out the series +2. Of course my certainty that "20004" is the correct thing to write at this point is supposed by the interlocutor to reflect the fact that some thing was "answered in advance" of the steps actually being taken. He objects, still supposing that Wittgenstein is denying that he knows what to write: But I surely also know that whatever number I am given I shall be able, straight off and with certainty, to give the next one. to which Wittgenstein responds, - Certainly my dying first is excluded, and a lot of other things too. But my being so certain that I will be able to go on is naturally very important.62 Wittgenstein does not deem it irrelevant, much less false, for the inter locutor to fix on the certainty with which I develop the series under</page><page sequence="23">WITTGENSTEIN ON 2, 2, . . . 165 certain circumstances.63 But the certainty, Wittgenstein says, is a cer tainty that I shall be able to do something.64 I have been trained to react with confidence, without doubt, to such rules as +2. This is indeed of the utmost importance, this roteness of response, but the need for further attempts to justify it on independent and specific grounds ("grounds" more specific than "I have learned arithmetic") has not yet been made clear.65 The interlocutor's idea is that something is known "in advance" of the actual writing of the step. His reaction to Wittgenstein's remarks is that something is being denied, some kind of knowledge it seems to make sense to say we possess, knowledge that explains how it is we know what to do. However, it is not yet clear what the notion of "in advance" adds to the idea of being "determined". If our steps are "determined", it is natural to suppose something has fixed them ahead of time; this is just what being "determined", presumably, comes to. Wittgenstein is interested in the idea that something is "known ahead of time" insofar as it expresses the a priori. But Wittgenstein's earlier investigations of "determination" and his suggestion that "knowledge" is out of place (or anyway playing an idiosyncratic role) in the opening question of Section 3 serve to undermine the traditional category of the a priori entirely - at least insofar as it is viewed, in Kant's manner, as the epistemic companion to necessity. If "knowing" is out of place at the 10,003d step of working out the series +2, then (as the reductio ad absurdum of Section 3 shows) the urge to say that I (know to) write "20006" because it is a mathematical fact (or: mathematically true) that 20006 follows 20004 in the series +2 is undercut. There is no question of anything known here - it is rather a question of what is done.66 Having no doubt and being able to say how I know in this sort of case pull in opposite directions, in part because my having no doubt is seen (by the interlocutor) to be a matter of my being "determined". The "determination" must be determination, in this case, of a very particular sort. Let us try to make out a sense of genuine determination in advance. I have said that something "mechanical" emerges in "2, 2, 2 . . .". In what sense might we think of a machine determining the steps of this series in advance? Consider, by way of analogy, a computer, pro grammed to both add 2 and to write a sequence of repeating "2s" indefinitely. In a sense, the program (plus the machine's hardware) "determines" the steps it will take "in advance". Now we could ask,</page><page sequence="24">166 JULIET FLOYD "How does the machine know to write "2" at the 500th step?" An answer would presumably specify the program and the details of how the hardware implements the program. (The computer might even be programmed to "answer" the (first person) question "How do / know to "write" . . .?") But granted the program and the specification of the hardware's implementation of it, there is no further question to ask about this machine's taking this step at this point. The analogy with Wittgenstein's suggestion in Section 3 is this: once my program (my training in arithmetic) and the implementation of my hardware (by my neurophysiological nature) have been specified, it seems absurd to think that there could be more to ask about why I write "20006" (or "2") here. Thus, although it may be an interesting neurophysiological or psychological question what it is, e.g., that allows me to write "2" at the 1st, the 10th, and the 500th step of 2, 2, 2,... , or what the state of my retina and brain are when I watch a series of "2s" go by, one after the other, first in this sort of light, then after food deprivation, etc., these are still very particular and difficult questions with (if they make scientific sense) very particular answers, answers which would yield no general conclusions about the kind of determination the inter locutor is interested in.67 Wittgenstein offers the interlocutor other examples of epistemic com pulsion, or genuine knowing in advance in Sections 21 and 22 of Re marks on the Foundations of Mathematics. These sections are especially concerned with the Platonism of Frege and Russell, as the remark of Section 21 makes clear. 21. In his fundamental law68 Russell seems to be saying of a proposition: "It already follows - all I still have to do is, to infer it". Thus Frege somewhere says that the straight line which connects any two points is really already there before we draw it; and it is the same when we say that the transitions, say in the series + 2, have really already been made before we make them orally or in writing - as it were tracing them.69 Wittgenstein now replies to this patent Platonism by giving several further examples of "determination". 22. One might reply to someone who said this: Here you are using a picture. One can determine [bestimmen] the transitions [?berg?nge] which someone is to make in a series, by doing them for him first. E.g. by writing down in another notation the series which he is to write, so that all that remains for him to do is to translate it; or by actually writing it down very faint, and he has to trace it. In the first case we can also say that we don't write down the series that he has to write, and so that we do not ourselves make the transitions of that series; but in the second case we shall certainly say that the</page><page sequence="25">WITTGENSTEIN ON 2,2,... 167 series which he is to write is already there. We should also say this if we dictate what he has to write down, although then we are producing a series of sounds and he a series of written signs. It is at any rate a sure way of determining [bestimmen] the transitions [?berg?nge] that someone has to make, if we in some sense make them first.70 Thus Wittgenstein has given us several ways to determine the transitions "in advance". But he immediately returns to the lessons of Sections 1, 2 and 3, writing: If, therefore, we determine [bestimmen] these transitions [?berg?nge] in a quite different sense, namely, by subjecting our pupil to such a transition as e.g. children get in the multiplication tables and in multiplying, so that all who are so trained do random multiplications (not previously done in the course of being taught) in the same way and with results that agree - if, that is, the transitions which someone is to make on the order "Add 2! " are so determined by training that we can predict with certainty how he will go, even when he has never up to now taken this step [?bergang] - then it may be natural to us to use this as a picture of the situation: the steps [?berg?nge] are all already taken and he is just writing them down.71 But now our picture - the Platonist picture - is no longer literally true. Relative to these examples, it is only a metaphor. In the case of our actually writing out the series faintly, and then asking the pupil to trace what we have already marked out, there is a perfectly good sense in which the pupil, may make a mistake (perhaps by a slip of the pen). As the pupil copies, we can see the transitions or steps that are made, from faint numeral to darker numeral. If we ask the pupil to ask him or herself, "How do I know to write "20004,20006"?" there is a per fectly good answer the pupil can give: simply point to the faint marks that look just like this ("20004,20006"). But in the cases we were imagining earlier in Section 3, there was nothing to point to. The "picture" the interlocutor is operating with is that the case we described is just like the pupil's tracing of the faint numerals, only the numerals are very, very faint - in fact so faint they cannot be seen. But now the notion of a "transition" or "step" is metaphorical, a Platonic entity of some kind, or a whispering of the entity to us to take this step.72 Wittgenstein indicates in Section 3 that in order to be "answered in advance" there must be some question, some possible mistake, some particular way of getting it wrong. But rote learning - like the kind of drills lying behind our "training" in arithmetic - is a kind of memori zation ahead of time. This is not a matter of "answering questions in advance", but of practicing so as to not have to think. As we have seen, something "mechanical" is happening by the 500th step of</page><page sequence="26">168 JULIET FLOYD 2, 2, 2 . . . This is what leads to our not being sure whether to call the step at that point calculation, or inference, or even whether I may be said to have "intended" this step (or not intended it). It is no longer clear what sort of "necessity" is in question, or how we are to demarcate the role and scope of the notions of logical or mathematical inference. Let me back up for a moment and discuss a parenthetical analogy Wittgenstein draws in Section 3. After the posing of the original ques tion ("How do I know that in working out the series +2 1 must write "20004,20006" and not "20004,20008"?"), Wittgenstein writes: - (The question: "How do I know [Wie weiss ich] that this color is "red"?" is similar.) Now in Philosophical Investigations Section 381 we read the following: How do I recognize [erkenne] that this color is red? - It would be an answer to say: "I have learned English".73 Wittgenstein's response in Philosophical Investigations that "I have learned English" is, it may seem, hardly an answer at all. In fact, it is tantamount to a rejection of the question, at least as an intended articulation of the interlocutor's sense of the mystery and uniqueness of the meaning of "red". For the interlocutor did not doubt that he spoke English. If he had, he would have pictured himself as a foreigner or a child; but this is part of Wittgenstein's point: what the foreigner and the child lack is the training, the practice that we have engaged in. Posing the question in the way the interlocutor does can make it seem as if there is something special going on when I recognize that this color is "red", some particular understanding that is manifested, some knowledge of a particular and unique meaning relation between the word and the thing. Yet when I ask myself how I know. . . , there seems nothing particular to pinpoint in virtue of which I may claim to know. The result may be a kind of skeptical giddiness about meaning, but Wittgenstein offers instead the fact that I speak English. This squares with our untutored reactions: if I ask myself the question, "How do I now this color is "red"?" I am tempted to respond, "Because it's red!"74 These may seem to be irrelevant and impoverished responses if taken on their own. Certainly they are "circular" if taken as direct answers to the questions, but viciously so? From what standpoint could we find a better sort of response? Thus, using Wittgenstein's parenthetical analogy, we may rethink the</page><page sequence="27">WITTGENSTEIN ON 2, 2, . . . 169 opening question of Section 3. An analogous response to the question about my compulsion to write "20004,20006" would not be that I speak English; it would presumably be something like "I have learned basic arithmetic" or "I have learned to count". This response hardly informs me about this particular step (from "20004" to "20006"). In a real sense, it rejects the question. But it serves as a kind of reminder (cf. PI Section 127). Wittgenstein wishes to call attention to the interlocutor's inclination to view as irrelevant the fact that I have learned arithmetic. Why does this seem irrelevant? What more could the interlocutor want by way of a justification?75 NOTES 1 Eds. G. H. von Wright, R. Rhees and G. E. M. Anscombe; trans. G. E. M. Anscombe (revised edition, Cambridge: M.I.T.

More recently there has been more willingness to countenance Wittgenstein's views, though little consensus on what those views are or even how ignorant Wittgenstein was of certain central technical results.

And now the impressiveness retreats to these illusions, to the problems. 5 See LFM, Lecture I (p. 14): Mathematicians tend to think that interpretations of mathematical symbols are a lot of jaw - some kind of gas which surrounds the real process, the essential mathematical kernel. A philosopher provides gas, or decoration - like squiggles on a wall of a room. I may occasionally produce new interpretations, not in order to suggest they are right, but in order to show that the old interpretation and the new are equally arbitrary. I will only invent a new interpretation to put side by side with an old one and say "Here, choose, take your pick." I will only make gas to expel old gas. 6 Cf. Warren Goldfarb, T Want You to Bring Me A Slab: Remarks on the Opening Sections of the Philosophical Investigations', Synthese 56 (1983): 265-82, especially pp. 266-7. 7 A critical edition of both parts of this so-called "Fr?hversion" (hereafter FV), has been prepared by G. H. von Wright and Heikki Nyman. The first part of FV was composed during 1936; the second during the fall of 1937 (see pp. 113-4 of von Wright, 'The Origin and Composition of Philosophical Investigations' (in his Wittgenstein, (University of Minnesota Press, 1983, pp. 111-36)). The parts are of equal page length and form a consecutive typescript (see Ibid., p. 117). The so-called "intermediate version", or "A//#e/version" of PI (MV) was compiled by von Wright, who conjectures that it was completed by Wittgenstein some time in 1945 (see von Wright, 'The Origin and Composi tion of Philosophical Investigations', pp. 125ff). 8 von Wright, 'The Origin and Composition of Philosophical Investigations', pp. 120ff. 9 von Wright, 'The Origin and Composition of the Investigations', p. 121. 10 In the typescript from which RFM, I was printed (TS 222) approximately 50 passages were deleted and the order of others rearranged from the FV version (TS 221). Anhang III of von Wright's critical edition gives a list of the correspondences and alterations between TS 221 and TS 222. 11 See von Wright, 'The Origin and Composition of the Investigations', pp. 114-19. According to von Wright, there were originally three copies of the second part of the typescript. One contained a few revisions in Wittgenstein's hand; the second was entirely clean; the third Wittgenstein cut up into pieces which he "clipped together in a large number of bunches" many of which are annotated and changed (Ibid., p. 118). Part I of</page><page sequence="29">WITTGENSTEIN ON 2, 2, . . . 171 RFM was printed from this third copy, entitled TS 222 in von Wright's catalogue. In the editors' preface to the revised edition of RFM, p. 30, we read that "in a notebook as late as 1944 [Wittgenstein] proposed a few alterations to this typescript". 12 In Volume II of their Analytical Commentary on the Philosophical Investigations (Chapter I), Baker and Hacker emphasize the manuscript basis of PI and view PI Sections 1-189 as a tree which bore "two fruits": in the original sequel (FV) Wittgenstein focussed on the philosophy of mathematics and logic; in the intermediate and final versions (MV and PI) on the philosophy of mind. Developing this metaphor, Baker and Hacker suggest several interesting similarities between Wittgenstein's discussions of mathematics and his discussions of mind. But the complexity of the interweaving I find among Wittgenstein's remarks in RFM I and later sections of PI does not seem to me to bear out the metaphor of "two fruits", which suggests that there are two distinct yet comparable realms of Wittgenstein's later philosophy, distinguished by range of topic. 13 RFM /Section 1. 14 In an earlier draft of PI Section 81 (FV Section 78.(80.)), Wittgenstein explicitly mentions Tractatus, writing in the final sentence: Denn dan wird auch klar werden, was dazu verleiten kann - und mich verleitet hat (Log.Phil.Abh.) - zu denken, dass, wer einen Satz ausspricht und meint, oder versteht, damit einen Kalk?l betreibt, nach bestimmten Regeln. 15 PI Section 81. I have altered Anscombe's translation in the fifth, ninth and final lines of the published English text. Her translation suggests that games and calculi which have fixed rules must be different, and leaves out the word "logic" at one point altogether. 16 Despite occasional remarks which suggest otherwise (e.g., PI Section 7, RFM VI Section 28, RFM VII Section 35), my interpretation is reinforced by PI Sections 130-1: 130. Our clear and simple language-games are not preparatory studies for a future regularization of language - as it were first approximations, ignoring friction and air resistance. The language-games are rather set up as objects of comparison which are meant to throw light on the facts of our language by way not only of similarities, but also of dissimilarities. 131. For we can avoid ineptness or emptiness in our assertions only by presenting the model as what it is, as an object of comparison - as, so to speak, a measuring rod; not as a preconceived idea to which reality must correspond. (The dogmatism into which we fall so easily in doing philosophy.) 17 PI Section 143. 18 Ibid. 19 See PI Sections 143, 185. 20 PI Section 144: 144. What do I mean when I say "the pupil's capacity to learn may come to an end here"? Do I say this from my own experience? Of course not. (Even if I have had such experience.) Then what am I doing with that proposition? Well, I should like you to say: "Yes, it's true, you can imagine that too, that might happen too!" - But was I trying to draw someone's attention to the fact that he is capable of imagining that? - I wanted to put that picture before him, and his acceptance of</page><page sequence="30">172 JULIET FLOYD the picture consists in his now being inclined to regard a given case differently: that is, to compare it with this rather than that set of pictures. I have changed his way of looking at things. (Indian mathematicians: "Look at this".) The FV basis for this section (FV Section 126 (128)), identical with Z Section 461, draws a connection between geometrical figure construction, Wittgenstein's own philosophical method, and discussions of the convincingness of proof in RFM. 21 Stanley Cavell emphasizes the quality of the analogy as a "figure of speech" in The Claim of Reason (New York: Oxford University Press, 1979). In discussing the function of mathematical examples in PI he writes (pp. 121-2): Their general background is an idea that the primitive abilities of mathematics (e.g., counting, grouping, adding, continuing a series, finding quantities equal or smaller) are as natural as any (other) region of a natural tongue, and as natural as the primitive abilities of logic (e.g., drawing an inference, following a rule of substitution). The implication is that ordinary language no more needs a foundation in logic than mathematics does. More specifically, he uses the picture of "continuing a series" as a kind of figure of speech for an idea of the meaning of a word, or rather an idea of the possession of a concept: to know the meaning of a word, to have the concept titled by the word, is to be able to go on with it into new contexts - ones we accept as correct for it; and you can do this without knowing, so to speak, the formula which determines the fresh occurrence, i.e., without being able to articulate the criteria in terms of which it is applied. If somebody could actually produce a formula, or a form for one, which generated the schematism of a word's occurrences, then Wittgenstein's idea here would be more than a figure of speech; it would be replaced by, or summarize, something we might wish to call the science of semantics. 22 PI Sections 146, 152. 23 Elsewhere, however, Wittgenstein plays on the fact that it is usual in mathematical contexts to speak of the formula (e.g., (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)) and the rule (e.g., of associativity of addition) interchangeably. This comes out strikingly in his discussion of recursive proof, Skolem primitive recursive arithmetic and mathematical induction in PG Part II, Chapter IV. 24 Viewing concepts as rules, Kant raised a similar problem in the Critique of Pure Reason (A 133/B 172-A 136/B 175) and attempted to resolve it in the schematism and in the introduction to the Critique of Judgment. 25 See Tractatus 6.126ff. Compare Frege's critical discussion of Schr?der in his review of Schroder's Algebra der Logik, translated in Translations from the Philosophical Writings of Gottlob Frege, eds. Peter Geach and Max Black (Totowna, NJ: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1980) pp. 86-106. See also Russell's implicit criticisms of the algebra of logic tradition in his Principles of Mathematics (New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1938), Chapter II. 26 RFM I Section 6. 27 See both the Fr?hvex?on (FV, p. 162.(168.)) and PI Section 189. 28 Ibid. 29 This portion of the passage is identical in FV Section 162.(168.) and RFM I, 1. In PI Section 189 the first word of the question is italicized: "How is it used?". 30 RFM I Section 1. 31 Wittgenstein's play on the ideas of instruction ("unterrichten"), training ("abrichten"),</page><page sequence="31">WITTGENSTEIN ON 2,2, . . . 173 teaching ("lehren") and education, or up-bringing ("erziehen") in connection with the learning of language are of course familiar themes in the opening sections of PI, especially Sections 6, 7 and 9. 32 RFM I Section 1. 33 PI Section 206 uses a similar analogy in a different context to make a somewhat different point: 206. Following a rule is analogous to obeying an order. We are trained to do so; we react to an order in a particular way. But what if one person reacts in one way and another in another to the order and the training? Which one is right? Suppose you came as an explorer into an unknown country with a language quite strange to you. In what circumstances would you say that the people there gave orders, understood them, obeyed them, rebelled against them, and so on? The common behavior of mankind [Die gemeinsame menschliche Handlungsweise] is the system of reference [das Bezugssystem] by means of which we interpret an unknown language. 34 Nor does it appear in the final version PI Section 189. 35 All people, every time? Human frailty, such as it is, would eventually bring errors or exhaustion to falsify this claim. The possibility of mistakes in calculation versus uses of alternative "arithmetics" is a related and complex topic investigated by Wittgenstein at length in RFM and elsewhere. See, e.g., RFM I Section 136; RFM III Section 81; RFM TV Section 26, and ROC III, Section 293. Kripke offers an especially incisive criticism of dispositionalist accounts of meaning by focussing on the difficulty of stating non-question-begging ceteris paribus clauses to pin point an explanation of behavior. See Kripke, Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Lan guage, pp. 25ff. 36 RFM I Section 1. 37 One might have dismissed the conversation between the interlocutor and Wittgenstein from the beginning by dismissing the interlocutor's initial objection as rooted in a (rather obvious) confusion of use and mention. But such a dismissal would skirt the philosophical interest of Wittgenstein's writing: to plumb the sources of the interlocutor's interest in the necessity of logical inference. 38 RFM I Section 1. I have altered Anscombe's translation of the first clause quoted. 39 Here I am differing in point of emphasis with both Garth Hallett (A Companion to Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations, (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1977), pp. 278-9), and Baker and Hacker (Wittgenstein, Rules, Grammar and Necessity, An Analyti cal Commentary on the Philosophical Investigations, Vol. II, pp. 107ff). These com mentators label the latter kind of statement "grammatical". 40 RFM I Section 1. 41 Strangely, the simplified formula is y = x4, rather than y = x2, which would have made better sense. Perhaps Wittgenstein made an algebraic error, or there was a typographical error in transcription. If the formula to be simplified were instead y = (x + z)2 - z(2x + z), the simplification would be y = x2. Compare PI Section 189, where the altered passage reads in part: or it might be a mathematical problem to prove in a particular [bestimmten] system that x has only one square.</page><page sequence="32">174 JULIET FLOYD Note the substitution of the notion of proof for calculation in PI Section 189. 42 This is borne out in the revision of the section's final sentence Wittgenstein made in PI, quoted in the previous footnote. 43 RFM VII Section 42: When I said that the propositions of mathematics determine [bilden] concepts, that is vague; for "2 + 2 = 4" forms a concept in a different sense from "p Dp". "(x).fx Dfa", or Dedekind's Theorem. The point is, there is a family of cases. And again, at RFM VII Section 45: The word "concept" is too vague by far. Cf. RFM VII Section 70 and RFM VII Section 71: "'Concept' is a vague concept". Wittgenstein's discussion in RFM I Section 1 should be compared with the "indetermi nateness" [Unbestimmtheit] of our notion of sameness of color in ROC I Sections 17, 56 and 59; and ROC III Section 251. 44 RFM I Section 2. See the corresponding PI Section 190. 45 RFM I Section 2. 46 Ibid. 47 Ibid. I have altered Anscombe's translation of this sentence. 48 The tradition, of course, tended not to think of the relation as primarily epistemic. If it is thought of as an epistemic relation at all, such a relation would not presumably be known by means of the senses. (Compare G. E. M. Anscombe's idea of "non-obser vational knowledge" in her Intention (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1963) pp. 12ff.) Kant, who viewed the will as a kind of causality, would have discerned a (causally) "necessary connection" between an intention and an action, hence a relation with an a priori element. But the intention itself would not have been deemed knowledge a priori of the effect (the action); rather, the (regulative) category of causality would give us a priori knowledge that the effect (the movement of my body, say) had some cause or other in the realm of appearance. 49 The entire surrounding discussion in PI is relevant, especially Sections 435 and 437 where Wittgenstein says: 457. Yes: meaning [meinen] something is like going up to someone. (This section was drafted much earlier in Wittgenstein's life. See PG p. 157.) In PI Section 439 Wittgenstein explicitly speaks in terms of "metaphor". 50 Wittgenstein does his best to explicitly avoid being read this way. See, e.g., RFM II Section 61, LFM, p. Ill and PI Sections 307-8: 307. "Are you not really a behaviorist in disguise? Aren't you at bottom really saying that everything except human behavior is a fiction?" - if I do speak of a fiction, then it is of a grammatical fiction. 308. How does the philosophical problem about mental processes and states and about behaviorism arise? - The first step is the one that altogether escapes notice. We talk of processes and states and leave their nature undecided. Sometime perhaps we shall know more about them - we think. But that is just what commits us to a particular way of looking at the matter. For we have a definite concept of what it</page><page sequence="33">WITTGENSTEIN ON 2, 2, . . . 175 means to learn to know a process better. (The decisive movement in the conjuring trick has been made, and it was the very one that we thought quite innocent.) - And now the analogy which was to make us understand our thoughts falls to pieces. So we have to deny the yet uncomprehended process in the yet unexplored medium. And now it looks as if we had denied mental processes. And naturally we don't want to deny them. 51 Cf. PI Section 188: Here I should first of all like to say; your idea was that that act of meaning the order [Meinen des Befehls] had in its own way already traversed all those steps: that when you meant it your mind as it were flew ahead and took all the steps before you physically arrived at this or that one. Thus you were inclined to use such expressions as: "The steps are really already taken, even before I take them in writing or orally or in thought". And it seemed as if they were in some unique way predetermined, anticipated - as only the act of meaning [das Meinen] can anticipate reality. 52 RFM I Section 3. At PI Section 211 the question finds an analog: 211. How can he know how he is to continue a pattern by himself - whatever instruction you give him? - Well how do I know? - if that means "Have I reasons?" the answer is: my reasons will soon give out. And then I shall act, without reasons. 53 See TLP 4.1252, 4.1273, 6.02ff. 54 See, e.g., RFM I Section 128, RFM II Section 27, RFM III Sections 26, 39, RFM VI Section 27. 55 This is, essentially, the interpretive route taken by Kripke, whose much discussed Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language outlines an interpretation of Wittgenstein as a skeptic about the notion of meaning a word in a particular way. Kripke regards RFM I Section 3 as a vivid statement of the paradox he attributes to Wittgenstein. Says Kripke (p. 20): The passage strikingly illustrates a central thesis of this [i.e., Kripke's] essay: that Wittgenstein regards the fundamental problems of the philosophy of mathematics and of the "private language argument" - the problem of sensation language - as at root identical, stemming from his paradox. The whole of Section 3 is a succinct and beautiful statement of the Wittgensteinian paradox; indeed the whole initial section of Part I of Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics is a development of the problem with special reference to mathematics and logical inference. I cannot take up my systematic differences with Kripke in this essay. Reasonable doubts about his argument as interpretation of Wittgenstein seem to me to have already been raised by several commentators, including G. E. M. Anscombe, 'Critical Notice of Saul Kripke's Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language', Canadian Journal of Philosophy, 15 (March 1985), 103-9; G. E. M. Anscombe, 'Review of Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language', Ethics 95 (January 1985), 342-52; Baker and Hacker, Scepticism, Rules and Language, (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1984); Stanley Cavell's second Cams Lecture, 1988; Warren Goldfarb, 'Kripke on Wittgenstein on Rules', Journal of Philo</page><page sequence="34">176 JULIET FLOYD sophy 82 (1985), 471-8; and William Tait, 'Wittgenstein and the "Skeptical Paradoxes'", Journal of Philosophy 81 (1984), 759-78. 56 RFM TV Section 9 suggests that the appeal to "same" occurs most naturally when trying to explain a rule to someone: How could one explain to anybody what you have to do if you are to follow a rule? One is tempted to explain [Man ist versucht, zu erkl?ren]: first and foremost do the simplest thing (if the rule e.g. is always to repeat the same thing). And there is of course something in this. It is significant that we can say that it is simpler to write down a sequence of numbers in which each number is the same as its predecessor than a sequence in which each number is greater by 1 than its predecessor. And again that this is a simpler law than that of alternately adding 1 and 2. 57 Compare Baker and Hacker's discussion in their Scepticism, Rules &amp; Language, (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1984), pp. 82ff. I have some hesitations about Baker and Hacker's rather free use of the notion of an "internal relation" to expound the later Wittgenstein, hesitations I elaborate in my dissertation, 'The Rule of the Mathematical: Wittgenstein's Later Discussions' (Harvard PhD Dissertation, 1990). 58 Compare PI Sections 215-6. 59 RFM I Section 3. See also PI Sections 213-4 where we read: 213. "But this initial segment of a series obviously admitted of various interpreta tions (e.g. by means of algebraic expressions) and so you must first have chosen one such interpretation". - Not at all. A doubt was possible in certain circumstances. But that is not to say that I did doubt, or even could doubt. (There is something to be said, which is connected with this, about the psychological 'atmosphere' of a process.) So it must have been intuition that removed this doubt? - If intuition is an inner voice - how do I know how I am to obey it? And how do I know that it doesn't mislead me? For if it can guide me right, it can also guide me wrong. ((Intuition an unnecessary shuffle.)) 214. If you have to have an intuition in order to develop the series 12 3 4... you must also have one in order to develop the series 2 2 2... 60 Cf. Frege's Grundgesetze der Arithmetik, p. vii: Of course the pronouncement is often made that arithmetic is merely a more highly developed logic; yet that remains disputable so long as transitions occur in the proofs that are not made according to acknowledged laws of logic, but seem rather to be based upon something known by intuition. Wittgenstein is also indirectly attempting to undermine the kind of debate which took place between Russell and Poincar? over "intuition". See Russell's review of Science and Hypothesis, reprinted from Mind, July 1905, in Russell's Philosophical Essays (New York: George Allen and Unwin, 1966). 61 RFM I Section 3. Wittgenstein moved the final two paragraphs from a different place in the manuscript, which may explain his switch to "2006" from "20006". See FV, Section 310.(316.). 62 RFM I Section 3. I have altered Anscombe's translation of the last sentence.</page><page sequence="35">WITTGENSTEIN ON 2, 2, . . . 177 Cf. RFM IV Section 52: Now can it be said that the concepts which mathematics produces are a convenience, that essentially we could do without them? First and foremost the adoption of these concepts expresses the sure expectation of certain experiences. We do not accept e.g. a multiplication's not yielding the same result every time. And what we expect with certainty is essential to our whole life. 64 See PI Section 211. 65 Cf. OC Sections 448-9. 66 Pip. 211: "I know what I want, wish, believe, feel, . . . ." (and so on through all the psychologi cal verbs) is either philosophers' nonsense, or any rate not a judgment a priori. 67 What would count as a relevant specification of my physiological state - whether, e.g., it would have to be similar in different environments for the same computation, whether it could vary from step to step of the same series, whether there would have to be any similarity between my state for the 500th step of 2, 2, 2 . . . and the 20003d step of +2 beginning with 0, whether it would be similar to other humans' physiologies for the same computation, or even "related" computations, etc. - all this is, at present, unknown. An informative physiological specification of my state at the 20003d step of the series +2 would be considerably more difficult than our explanation of the computer's hardware, since after all, we built the computer. Warren Goldfarb, 'Wittgenstein, Mind, and Scien tism\ (Journal of Philosophy 86 (Nov. 1989), 635-42) explores such difficulties in connec tion with Wittgenstein's discussions in PI of intentional mental notions (understanding, believing, remembering, thinking, etc.) and the question of whether Wittgenstein is standing in the way of empirical inquiry on the basis of an a priori argument. The care with which Wittgenstein asks us to treat (and distinguish) specific questions serves, it seems to me, as a reasonable philosophical lesson for the psychologist, who may jump too quickly into glossing the aim of particular experiments to be the support of a general psychological hypothesis about, say, inference in general. 68 Wittgenstein is referring to the law of Russell and Whitehead expressed in Principia Mathematica (Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge, 1910; reprinted paperback version 1962), pp. 131-2: We have next two propositions concerned with inference to or from propositions containing apparent variables, as opposed to implication. First, we have, for the new meaning of implication resulting from the above definitions of negation and disjunction, the analogue of *1-1, namely *9-12. What is implied by a true premiss is true. Pp. That is to say, given "h . p" and "h.pD q", we may proceed to "h . q", even when the propositions p and q are not elementary. Also, as in *1-11, we may proceed from "K (f)x" and "I-. &lt;f)x D ipx" to "h . \px", where jc is a real variable, and &lt;/&gt; and ip are not necessarily elementary functions. It is in this latter form that the axiom is usually needed. It is to be assumed for functions of several variables as well as for functions of one variable.</page><page sequence="36">178 JULIET FLOYD See RFM I Section 19ff. 69 RFM I Section 21. 70 RFM I Section 22. 71 Ibid. 72 Cf. PI Section 223: One does not feel that one has always got to wait upon the nod (the whisper) next, but it always tells us the same, and we do what it tells us. One might say to the person one was training: "Look I always do the same thing: I. .." 73 PI Section 381: Wie erkenne ich, dass diese Farbe Rot ist? - Eine Antwort w?re: "Ich habe Deutsch gelernt". In the above translation, I have altered Anscombe's translation of "erkenne". The context of this remark is different from that in RFM I, 3. In PI Wittgenstein is engaged in a discussion of the notion of a private ostensive definition and interlocutor's notion that such a definition might be secured by way of an image. The primary focus of the discussion in the opening sections of RFM I is, by contrast, the character of logical inference. Cf. Baker and Hacker, Scepticism, Rules &amp; Language, p. 26. 74 Compare RFM VI Section 28: Someone asks me: What is the color of this flower? I answer: "Red". - Are you absolutely sure? Yes, absolutely sure! But may I not have been deceived and called the wrong color "red"? No. The certainty with which I call the color "red" is the rigidity of my measuring-rod, it is the rigidity from which I start. When I give descriptions, that is not to be brought into doubt. This simply characterizes what we call describing. (I may of course even here assume a slip of the tongue, but nothing else.) 75 I have many intellectual debts. My emphasis on the importance of Wittgenstein's style of writing derives from several years of courses, lectures, and reading of the works of Stanley Cavell, Burton Dreben, Warren Goldfarb and Hilary Putnam. My first debt is to Dreben, who urged me to work on Wittgenstein's discussions of mathematics and logic and whose wit and acuity have been a constant source of encouragement and stimulation. Conversation with Cavell on an earlier draft of Part 3 helped me to articulate my outlook on Wittgenstein's notions of grammar and logic and to rethink Baker and Hacker's metaphorical description of the manuscript basis of Wittgenstein's text. Goldfarb offered numerous helpful criticisms of earlier drafts of Parts 1-4. Thomas Scanlon's detailed comments on my characterization of Platonism helped me to clarify what I see at stake in Wittgenstein's writing. William Flesch's reading of an early draft of Parts 4-6 kept me focussed on Wittgenstein's text, while the thoughtful responses of Gary Ebbs and Charles Parsons made me better appreciate the importance of placing an emphasis on Wittgenste in's philosophical method in defending my interpretation.
