<plain_text><page sequence="1">BASKETMAKER AND ARCHAIC ROCK ART OF THE COLORADO PLATEAU: A REINTERPRETATION OF PALEOIMAGERY Jennifer A. Kitchell A new cognitive model is proposed and applied to the analysis of the anthropomorphic-dominated paleoimagery or rock art of both the Archaic Barrier Canyon Style and the Basketmaker San Juan Style of the Colorado Plateau, including the attrib utes of headdresses and messengers. Under the cognitive model, the decision to execute rock art is culturally and histori cally conditioned; the interaction of narrative language and visual imagery takes precedence over hallucinatory and trance mechanisms. The cognitive model examines the interplay between perceptual imagery and stored mental imagery, both of which occur within the human cognitive system. Such an interplay arguably has been as important in the shaping of human cultures as the role of language. These Archaic and Basketmaker ecologies and cultures also may have developed group rit ual, an early adoption not requisitely tied to the transition from a mobile hunter-gatherer ecology to an agricultural ecol ogy. Such interpretations redefine the predominant images of the region's Archaic and Basketmaker anthropomorphic figures, bird-headed imagery, messenger spirits, supplication panels, and processional panels. The model reinstates the praejudico role that visual imagery plays in the construction of culture. Se propone y utiliza un nuevo modelo cognoscitivo para el andlisis de paleoimdgenes o arte rupestre dominado por elemen tos antropomorficos en los estilos del grupo Arcaico de Barrier Canyon y de Basketmaker en la Meseta de Colorado. Estas imdgenes incluyen los atributos de los tocados y de los espiritus mensajeros. De acuerdo con el modelo cognoscitivo, la decision de llevar a cabo arte rupestre es condicionado por aspectos histdricos y culturales; la interaccion del lenguaje narrativo y las imdgenes visuales son mas importantes que mecanismos guiados por alucinaciones o estados de trance. El modelo cognosc itivo investiga la interaccion entre las imdgenes perceptibles y aquellas confinadas a las imdgenes mentales, ambas compo nentes del sistema cognoscitivo humano. Esta interaccion puede haber sido tan importante en la formacion de culturas humanas como el lenguaje. Las ecologias y culturas Arcaica y Basketmaker pueden haber desarrollado un ritual de grupo; una adopcion temprana no necesariamente asociada a la transicion de una ecologia de recolectores-cazadores a una ecologia agrwola. Estas interpretaciones redefinen las imdgenes predominantes de Arcaica y de Basketmaker figuras antropomdrficas, humanos con cabezas de pdjaros, espiritus mensajeros, paneles de suplica, y paneles de procesidn. El modelo reinstala en papel praejudico que las imdgenes visuales tienen en la construccion de una cultura. Images in their semiotic systems define cul tures, and in so doing channel the ways by which the world, including its ultimate dimen sions, is engaged [Neville 2006:117]. general interpretative consensus has devel oped in recent decades that the paleoim X A^agery of the Colorado Plateau described as Barrier Canyon Style and San Juan Anthropo morphic Style rock art represents shamanic activ ities and practices (e.g., Cole 1989, 1990; Grant 1978; Malotki 2007; Schaafsma 1980,1986,1990, 1992, 1994). More specifically, Schaafsma, in a study of these Archaic and Basketmaker paintings and engravings, apprises that "the early rock art of the Colorado Plateau of eastern Utah and northern Arizona includes some of the most explicitly shamanistic rock art in North America" (1994:45). This article proposes instead that the shamanic framework fits this paleoimagery inadequately, pro viding less explanatory power than an alternative model, designated the cognitive model. Before describing the cognitive model, a brief summary of the shamanic model is required. As developed, and the literature is voluminous and thought-provoking (e.g., Hays-Gilpin 2004; Hedges 1985; Hodgson 2008; Lahelma 2005; Lewis-Williams 2001; Lewis-Williams and Dow son 1988; Pearson 2002; Price 2001; Whitley 1998; Winkelman 2002), the shamanic model is an altered Jennifer A.

Unlike evolutionary models such as those that underlie the study of linguistic diversity, mito chondrial DNA population patterns, or Y chromo some distribution, with their reliance on principles of historical descent with modification, the shamanic model relies instead on the shared prop erty of the human nervous system. Such a model is consequently universal for the species, biologi cally determined, and ahistorical, except on an evo lutionary time scale. The coupling of altered states of consciousness to the production of rock art lacks much ethno graphic evidence, or the ethnographic analogies offered represent time gaps on the order of 102-103 years. However, it is widely accepted that Upper Paleolithic and Archaic shamans, entering into altered states of consciousness, acted on an imper ative (i) to record their trance-induced mental imagery after coming out of the trance and (ii) to record images that depicted themselves during trance (Turpin 1990, 1994; Whitley 1998). In the context of the Colorado Plateau region, Schaaf sma, e.g., concludes that "a shaman's commitment to record visions from his trance may account for many or most of Barrier Canyon Style and Bas ketmaker petroglyphs and rock paintings" (1994:47). A subsidiary hypothesis, based on the observation that images experienced during altered states of consciousness have a short half-life in the brain, proposed additionally that such rock art (iii) functioned as a mnemonic device for the shaman (e.g., Keyser and Whitley 2006; Whitley 1998). In all three classes of motives, the shaman is the artist. One of the main reasons, in my opinion, that the shamanic or altered states of consciousness model has gained such wide application to the interpreta tion of rock art is that this model firmly roots the explanation and cause of the "art" in the sciences, by positing that these images are universal neuro logical responses. Laboratory experiments, as an example, have provided copious evidence of process wherein the human nervous system pro duces phosphenes, the abstract or nonfigurative images created by the optic system and brain asso ciation processes (Lorenceau 2003; Tkaczyk 2001; Tyler 1978; Walker 1981), an experiment easily duplicated by applying mechanical pressure to the closed eye to produce pressure phosphenes. Con sequently, a principal piece of logic underpinning the shamanistic interpretation of rock art is that these abstract phosphenes represent the first stage of image acquisition during altered states of con sciousness and that iconic imagery is the product of further progression of the altered state, whether induced via the entoptic system, or the ingestion of hallucinogenic plants, or self-induced hyperventi lation and the induction of hypocapnia, or other physiological pathways. All such visual imagery produced by these means is hallucination, namely, "false sensory per ception in the absence of an actual external stimu lus" (Fregnac 2003:89). Moreover, the image is first perceived and then recorded. Hence, under the shamanic model, the decision to execute rock art is post hoc (Solomon 2008). This article chooses to challenge these interpretations, as well as to rein state the praejudico role that human-made visual imagery plays in the construction of culture. The Role of Visual Art in Ideographic Systems Language and visual imagery are coupled in the development of cognitive or ideographic systems whereby through their interplay they enable the dissemination of complex symbolic thought. Recent advances in cognitive neuroscience are pro viding evidence of the biological basis of what is defined as "mental imagery" a cognitive capacity wherein perceptual imagery is accessed not from the senses but from memory (Kosslyn et al. 2006a). Recent experiments, e.g., utilizing techniques of brain imaging, have shown that to an observer's brain, an imagined object can be as real as an object observed in the natural world (Kosslyn et al. 2006b). Experiments in cognitive neuroscience have shown not only that such imagery can affect both the mind and the body as much as perceptual experience can but that "mental imagery draws on much of the same neural machinery as perception in the same modality, and can engage mechanisms used in memory, emotion, and motor control" (Kosslyn et al. 2006a: 196). As a consequence, "imagery in many ways can 'stand in' for a per ceptual stimulus" (Kosslyn et al. 2006a:205). The term visual imagery has come to include both the optic system of visual perception and the cognitive system of mental imagery, as well as the recognition that these two types of visual capacity</page><page sequence="3">Kitchell] BASKETMAKER AND ARCHAIC ROCK ART OF THE COLORADO PLATEAU 821 are neurologically linked (Bower and Morrow 1990; Ganis et al. 2004; Johansson et al. 2006; Pearson et al. 2008). Via the construction of visual imagery such as rock art, the human has the capa bility to turn mental imagery into sensory percep tion by creating visual illustration (Lewin and Foley 2004). Initiating with mental imagery, the image maker can enter into this coupled neurological sys tem and render a mental image sensorially mani fest. The manifestation completes the neurological cycle, as visual perception becomes stored mental imagery. Such neurologically mediated feedback is sig nificant, in that a "culture's sacred canopy" (to bor row a term from Beit-Hallahmi and Argyle 1997:125) represents a deliberate act of construc tion. This sacred canopy, moreover, requires sym bolic engagement since "there is no intrinsically religious meaning in anything. Any object, person, time, or place may become imbued with holiness and thus gain religious meaning" (Beit-Hallahmi and Argyle 1997:1). The image maker, in produc ing visual images of the sacred, invokes the optic-neurological cycle, and these images thereby enter into cognitive reality. Via symbolic engage ment, then, construction of a culture's sacred canopy takes advantage of the linked cognitive-visual system. In a discussion of meaningfulness, Neville states that it is these images that direct human engage ment: "Signs engage us with reality; without signs, we are causally implicated in reality but cannot engage it_the existence of religious signs makes engaging religious realities possible" (2006:29). Similarly, as Gold has commented regarding the visual imagery of modern ceremonial Tibetan man dalas and Navajo sand paintings, "theirs is not art for art's sake but, primarily, art for spirit's sake" (1994:188), or the creation of a set of sensory per ceptions for that which has no perceptual or sen sual form. Specifically, then, it is this very lack of percep tual form that requires that an image be constructed, a proxy. The "otherworlds" that are evoked using language (whether by storytellers, chanters, singers, or prayer makers) to create narratives of primal time, and creations and animation of these other worlds that do not manifest themselves visually, all present problems to the visual image maker, and the solution of these problems is what I will term the "science of visual art." The cognitive model is driven by the cognitive system of mental imagery and the science of visual art rather than by hallu cination. Does San Juan Anthropomorphic Rock Art Illustrate Shamanic Transformation? Human figures are the focus of San Juan Anthro pomorphic rock art (Figure 1). The question of interest is: What aspects of these human figures have led researchers to a general interpretation that the figure is shamanic? Such figures were first described in the archaeological literature by Kid der and Guernsey as "large and very peculiar anthropomorphic representations" (1919:198). The overall impression recorded by many subsequent researchers is that these figures, so characteristic of Basketmaker archaeological sites, are distinctly immobile in aspect (in comparison, e.g., to the human form depicted in various stages of activity and mobility in African San rock art). The descrip tive phrase most characteristically applied to these San Juan anthropomorphic figures is that they are "static" in appearance. More recently a consensus has developed that these static anthropomorphs represent a human in a trance state, specifically a shaman. The requisite activity of a shaman, sensu stricto, is mastery of some physiological technique of what has been termed "ecstasy" or "trance," wherein ecstasy is operationally defined as "mystical journeys under taken by superhuman means and in regions inac cessible to mankind" (Eliade 1964:174). The general described purpose of the ecstatic or trance state is to enable the shaman to make so-called magical flight, with the shaman acting as psy chopomp, conducting souls between the earthly world and the supernatural worlds. The anthropo morphic imagery of Basketmaker rock art of the Colorado Plateau has been interpreted to represent such human shaman figures, the subject matter being "trance, metaphorical death, magic flight, and transformation" (Muench and Schaafsma 1995:13). The primary piece of evidence for this assertion is derived from the visual depiction of the figures' hands and feet: Formerly cited as merely a stylistic convention, the drooping attitude of hands and feet is herein</page><page sequence="4">822 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 75, No. 4, 2010 Figure 1. Typical San Juan Anthropomorphic Style anthropomorphs with exaggerated and drooping hands and feet: (a) pictograph from Apache County, Arizona (drawn from photograph by Jennifer Kitchell); (b) petroglyph from San Juan River, Utah (drawn from photograph by Jed Sims). Most of the Barrier Canyon Style images are polychrome (typically red-brown, orange-red, bright or cream white, blue, green-blue, green, yellow, black, brown, and buff) or monochrome paintings (pictographs); the San Juan Anthropomorphic Style images exhibit a higher frequency of petroglyphs, but pic tographs are common and of an equal diversity of pigment colors. regarded as having iconic significance, com municating information about the state of being of these anthropomorphs. ... the con dition of immobility and lifelessness conveyed by this posture also suggests a trance state [Schaafsma 1994:53; see also Cole 1990]. Against the medium of a planar rock face, such a sense of "drooping" is visually achieved by a hang ing or vertically oriented display of both tarsals and metatarsals in the feet and metacarpals and carpals in the hands and an exaggeration in size. A typical such anthropomorph is illustrated using paintbrush strokes in Figure la from the Lukachukai Mountain region of Apache County, Arizona, with a comparative petroglyph example in Figure lb from Butler Wash of San Juan County, Utah. Then the assertion is made that these char acteristic images represent a depiction, executed by a shaman, of the shaman during trance. I would like to argue instead that this is a fallacy of presump tion rather than an error of reasoning. It is a true statement to say that if a shaman wanted to make a symbolic depiction of himself in the trance state he might choose to display a front facing static human figure with drooping hands and feet. However, I propose instead an alternative model that redirects emphasis to the "science" of image making and the problem of rendering com plex thoughts visually manifest. The Cognitive Model: The Deliberate Manifestation of the Unseeable Metaphor is simple on its merits: one entity sub stitutes for another. However, the science of visual art lies in the devising of metaphors that capture the essence of complex cultural narratives. As Kip penberg notes, "There is no innocent eye ... the share of the beholder is a decisive one" (1986:vii). The role of the visual artist in the construction of a culture's sacred canopy is to create perceptual imagery of what otherwise is indiscernible to the</page><page sequence="5">Kitchell] BASKETMAKER AND ARCHAIC ROCK ART OF THE COLORADO PLATEAU 823 visual system. Ethnohistorical examples include the 108 snail martyrs covering the Buddha's head, the hourglass figure of the Navajo entity referred to as Born for Water, and the Hindu elephant headed deity Ganesha. The visual image in each case evokes a complex oral narrative of causal rela tionships. The nimbate figure in the visual arts may have had its origin in central Asia; in historical visual language, the term nimbus takes its name from the ethnohistorical representation of otherworldliness through the metaphoricity of light. Nimbate figures have more than 2,000 years of documented visual inventory, with numerous examples in Hindu, Sikh, Egyptian, Islamic, Buddhist, Taoist, Shinto, Greek, Roman, Western Christian, and Byzantine art (Makkuni 1989). The point here, however, is not any specific of the ethnohistorical device but, rather, its overarching visual principle: the nimbus divided a human form on earth from a god or holy person, visually distinguishing that which is supramun dane from that which is mundane. Consequently, I use the term nimbus as a metaphorical analogue. To depict a nimbate figure was to deliberately cre ate a visual image for that which was otherwise incapable of being visually perceived by the nat ural human world of the senses. However, as recent neuroscience has shown, once a visual depiction is rendered, the image may enter through the optic system to the brain, to attain a meaningful reality. Consequently, in the same way that historical nimbate iconography does not celebrate the local priest but, rather, focuses on the visual depiction of the supernaturals themselves whose aid is being sought, I posit that the anthropomorphic figures depicted in the San Juan Anthropomorphic Style imagery are not human shamans but, rather, the supramundane beings created in the construction of the culture's sacred canopy by the language arts of storytelling and singing, now made visually man ifest. I propose that the immobile-appearing, front facing anthropomorphic figures so characteristic of the San Juan Anthropomorphic Style imagery derive their meaning from culturally accepted nar ratives, not individual hallucinations, and that these images are not self-portraits of shamans or shamanic visions. This argument represents a departure as well from interpreting the visual imagery as metaphorical death, magical flight, transformation, or shamanic trance. The visual artist operating within the alternative cognitive model, however, must select a concise visual vocabulary. I propose that the characteristic oversized and drooping hands and feet of these anthropomorphic figures represent an artistic device and visual signal that the depicted figure is not of this world. Deliberate depiction of both the hands and the feet in an exaggerated drooping posi tion illustrates the concept that these are supra mundane hands and feet that neither touch nor walk on the ground in any human manner. The static drooping feet and hands thereby represent visual attempts to give image to an unseen world. Sup porting evidence comes as well from the absence, within this suite of Basketmaker rock art, of images from ordinary life, including the absence of most material objects of everyday life and depictions of everyday activity. Supporting evidence, to be dis cussed below, comes from an examination of addi tional visual artistic devices frequently termed "headdresses," often used simultaneously in the depiction of these Basketmaker anthropomorphic figures. "Headdressed" Shamanic Humans and the Spatial Patterning Model An interesting analysis of the variety of "headdress type" and geographic distribution of San Juan Bas ketmaker anthropomorphs is presented by Robins (1997) and Robins and Hays-Gilpin (2000), who developed a spatial patterning model derived from two stated assumptions, namely, that the San Juan anthropomorphic figures of the Colorado Plateau represent "adorned humans" and that these humans are wearing "emblematic headdresses." From a sample size of 44 such headdressed figures, a par titioning of three headdress types was found to be nonrandom, supporting their interpretation that headdresses distinguish geographic (and cultural) territories. Further, the authors conclude that the rock art was part of "shamanic rituals" wherein "rock art producers may have held positions of power and authority based on the control of sub sistence resources and shamanic skill" (Robins and Hays-Gilpin 2000:231, 246). This article presents an alternate conclusion. In particular, I argue against the construal of these San Juan anthropomorphic figures as adorned humans and find support instead for the cognitive</page><page sequence="6">824 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 75, No. 4, 2010 &lt;F t # ^ 5^ ?

In this study I have extended both the sam ple size of San Juan anthropomorphic figures described by Robins (1997) and Robins and Hays Gilpin (2000), from 44 to 194, and their geographic range, from three to 29 sites, to test their model of spatial patterning within the San Juan Anthropo morphic Style. A representative variety of head dress types encountered in this study is displayed with their localities in Figure 2. Analysis of San Juan anthropomorphic pale oimages displaying the same three "headdress" types reveals an even broader geographic range, wherein the types are not endemic to a specific locality but mixed throughout the range. Addition</page><page sequence="7">Kitchell] BASKETMAKER AND ARCHAIC ROCK ART OF THE COLORADO PLATEAU 825 ally, the so-called bifurcated headdress type (Robins 1997; Robins and Hays-Gilpin 2000) is not a headdress but "an evidently important, enigmatic 'ear' protrusion" (Robins 1997:94). Grant (1978:Figures 4.13-4.14) had termed this type of San Juan anthropomorph "earmen." Schaafsma later suggested that "the significance of the con traptions issuing from the left ears of [these] fig ures ... may lie in the realm of aural hallucinations; further that special 'hearing' is also a feature of a shaman's learning experience" (1994:59), and that "the elements extending from the left ear may sym bolize a shaman's supernatural hearing capacities" (Muench and Schaafsma 1995:103). I would argue against this interpretation, suggesting instead that these protrusions are indicative of the supramun dane capability of the depicted being, unrelated to shamanic aural hallucination. Moreover, use of the term headdress when refer ring to adorned humans suggests a material arti fact, yet such headdresses are not found in the material culture recovered from Basketmaker sites. Schaafsma, describing the imagery, notes that "material artifacts resembling these ear pieces or the characteristic headgear are almost nonexistent, in spite of the wealth of perishable material that has been retrieved from dry Basketmaker caves" (1994:59). (Hyder [2002], however, suggests that their rarity might reflect a practice of dismantling and destroying ritual art, particularly funerary rit ual attire. For other examples of typically recov ered Basketmaker material culture, see Cole 1989, 1990,1993; Farmer 1992,1997; Guernsey and Kid der 1921; Hyder 2002; Kidder and Guernsey 1919; Morris 1951; Morris 1980.) I argue instead that these visual aspects of the anthropomorphic head feature are not images of material headdresses adorning costumed humans, shamanic or not; nor do they represent a headdress in any functional sense. Rather, they represent a nimbus-like depiction providing further visual per ception that these figures are supramundane. That these paleoimages cover a broad range of geo graphic territory suggests both oral and visual means of shared communication. Additionally, I propose that the visual design of "head-plus-emanation" may function to provide a more specific identification of a supramundane being-type or aid in identification of specific supra mundane individuals. Such visual examples with historical/ethnographic data include the Ye'i or Hashch' eeh, Navajo supernatural beings who when depicted in sand paintings within a healing cere mony are differentiated via numerous visual signs. Fringed Mouth, e.g., is depicted with a longitudi nally bicolored body and an inverted triangular shape on its head (Figure 3a). In the case of such visually created Hashch'eeh, "the Navajo judges ... whether it will work as a sacred tool to attract the supernatural beings depicted in it" (Wyman 1983:79), correlative with what the Navajos have called nikee, or "faceprints of the Holy Ones" (Kluckhohn et al. 1971:345). Another example, derived from a visual history spanning more than a thousand years of Byzantine imagery, is the head of the Archangel Michael portrayed with bands or fillets wrapping from behind the ears (Figure 3b), which "symbolize the spiritual hearing of the angel, attentive to the divine commands" (Ouspensky and Lossky 1983:108). Similarly, from a twelfth century window in the apse of Saint Remi cathe dral, Rheims, the holy figure of St. John the Evangelist is distinguished from ordinary humans via the depiction of "contraptions" emanating from his head described as "a circular nimbus sur mounted by two sun-flowers, emblems of the sun" (Didron et al. 1851:29, Figure 3c). In the more than 2,000-year-old tradition of the visual language of the Tibetan thangka art form, an artistic language known to be based on canonical treatises, the pres ence/absence of the nimbus (of various shapes and designs) differentiates between human figures and human-appearing deities when they are shown together in mixed compositions used to "transport the viewer into the supernatural" (Makkuni 1989:227,1992). Basketmaker visual image mak ers may have similarly solved the problems of pro ducing an image to represent beings and events not of this world, i.e., not visually accessible. There are many different motivations for rock art. I posit that what have variously been referred to in the archaeological literature on Basketmaker rock art as "contraptions," "headdresses," and "ear protrusions" are means of providing cognitive/ visual reality that these anthropomorphic-appearing figures posses nonhuman capacity. Whereas the decision to render the anatomical feet and hands of the San Juan anthropomorph in an exaggerated drooping position produces a visual perception that this is a being, metaphorically speaking, whose</page><page sequence="8">826 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 75, No. 4, 2010 Figure 3. (a) Navajo Ye'i Fringed Mouth (drawn from Wyman 1983:Figure 12); (b) sixteenth-century Byzantine icon showing the Archangel Michael with ribbon at ear (drawn from Koninklijk Museum 1997); (c) St. John the Evangelist, Rheims (redrawn from Didron et al. 1851 .'Figure 3). "feet do not touch the ground," the visual portrayal of emanations, both above the head and projecting from the head and ears, provides for a wider vari ety of visual description and additional individua tion, since they are not restricted to, or fettered by, anatomical constraints. The Special Case of the Bird-Headed Anthropomorph One element depicted in Basketmaker anthropo morphic imagery went further: "In the Basket maker case, a whole bird sits atop the human body like a headdress" (Robins and Hays-Gilpin 2000:244-245). There are two variant motifs, either replacement of the entire head of the anthro pomorphic figure with a bird or "ornamenting" the top of the figure's head with a bird. This "bird headed man" is explicitly interpreted within the shamanic model as illustrating the ecstatic trance experience and transformation (Hedges 1985), specifically "the shaman's magical soul flight" (Robins and Hays-Gilpin 2000:245), "signifying their power of shamanic flight to celestial realms" (Muench and Schaafsma 1995:13), and "the moment of metamorphosis of shaman into bird" (McCreery and Malotki 1994:151). Such inter pretations hearken back to Eliade's statement that "becoming a bird oneself or being accompanied by a bird indicates the capacity, while still alive, to undertake the ecstatic journey to the sky and beyond" (1964:98). Accordingly, a bird sitting atop the head would be indicative of "being accompa nied by a bird," whereas replacement of the anthro pomorphic figure's head with a bird would be indicative of "becoming a bird oneself." Bock and Bock conclude that although the instance of the bird replacing the head occurred "more rarely than a bird perched on the head, it carries more signif icance, since it suggests the completed transfor mation from shaman into the bird 'psychopomp'" (1992:14). Before providing an alternative interpretation to the bird-headed anthropomorph as shamanic, I would like to briefly discuss the archaeological evi dence and biological attributes of the turkey. A cor relation has been made between the depiction of bird-headed or bird-on-headed anthropomorphs and the turkey, described as the most abundantly illustrated bird species in Basketmaker rock art. Grant (1978:53, 172) refers specifically to "the turkey-headed man" as occurring with significant frequency (see also Cole 1990:114; Schaafsma 1980:125). Further, there is excellent archaeolog ical evidence in association with cultural Basket maker material that the turkey was a contemporaneous domesticated species, including data from eggshell analyses (Beacham and Durand 2007), bone densities, guano, and pen remains. Geib and Spurr, e.g., have characterized turkey hus</page><page sequence="9">Kitchell] BASKETMAKER AND ARCHAIC ROCK ART OF THE COLORADO PLATEAU 827 bandry as a "widely recognized trait of the Bas ketmaker III period" (2000:198). However, to visually depict the shamanic power of celestial flight and the role of the shaman in fer rying souls as psychopomp, the selection of the turkey is probably the least likely choice. The turkey is a poor flier, better adapted to running than to extended flight. In terms of flight dynamics, the turkey's ratio of wing area to weight is among the lowest of all birds (.96), and "continuous active wingbeats rarely continue for more than 200 meters" (Dickson 1992:36). Given the adaptations for extended flight that occur in the eagle, vulture, falcon, and hawk groups prevalent in the Colorado Plateau region, the notion that the turkey was selected as a symbol of extraordinary flight to the "celestial realm" is probably misplaced. Grant (1978) was one of the first to describe "bird-headed men" in the rock art of Canyon de Chelly, Arizona, and concludes that Canyon de Chelly was the site of its origin. Based on his asser tion that the figure was rare elsewhere, though encountered in the Marsh Pass area, Tsegi Canyon, Kiet Siel, Rio Puerco, and John's Canyon, he con cludes that "most occur in the San Juan River drainage of northeastern Arizona and contiguous canyons in Utah" (1978:210). Dating of the bird headed anthropomorph rests on several examples of handheld atlatls (and not bows) in the panels, leading Grant (1978) to suggest an origin in late Basketmaker or early Modified Basketmaker times, rather than Pueblo times. Schaafsma agrees in gen eral, based on some examples of superimposition of the San Juan anthropomorphs by the bird-headed anthropomorph, that the bird-headed figures "occur in the latter part of the Basketmaker sequence" (1994:61). One of the problems, however, in dat ing the transition from Basketmaker II to Basket maker III is that "Basketmaker III traits such as pottery, the bow and arrow, beans, and turkey domestication do not appear as a 'suite' at a single point in time" (Geib and Spurr 2000:175). Bock and Bock (1992) attempted to extend the geographic distribution of the bird-headed motif beyond the sites described by Grant; their map (1992:Figure 20) shows a similar geographic pat tern, with examples from Canyon de Chelly, Chinle Wash, Rio Puerco, Petrified Forest National Park, and Kiet Siel in northeastern Arizona and John's Canyon, Grand Gulch, Castle Ruins, and Ruin Rock Natural Bridges in southeastern Utah. McCreery and Malotki (1994), in a detailed study of the rock art of the Petrified Forest National Park, describe a total of 44 bird-headed figures, of which 21 had birds on the head and the remaining 23 were bird-headed. This study attempted a wider geographic search to further extend the distribution of the bird-headed motif to include (in addition to the sites referred to above) Slim Canyon, Mystery Valley, and the Lukachukai Mountains of Arizona; Slickhorn Canyon, Cedar Mesa, and Schuertz Wash, Utah; and Mancos Canyon, Colorado. An interesting observation is that the anthropomorphic bird headed figures themselves are quite varied, includ ing anthropomorphs with drooping and exaggerated hands and feet (Figure 4a, e, g), with out-turned feet flexed at the ankle (Figure 4c), and with stick figure bodies. The bird is frequently over sized and out of proportion to the anthropomorph (Figure 4b, d). Additionally, there are compositions that combine the elements of the bird-headed fig ure and the flute-playing figure (Figure 4e-f). These flute-playing figures are frequently nonphallic and generally lack the humped back of later imagery. Robins and Hays-Gilpin consider "flutes ... to be one of a class of male-gendered 'tools' of fertility that also includes staffs, bows, arrows, and at least in Basketmaker II-III times, atlatls" (2000:243). If the flute player is the visual equivalent of a song of fertility, then a (turkey) bird-headed flute player may represent a song of fertility aimed toward this domesticated species. I propose that the visual imagery of the bird head is being interpreted in a backward manner: it is not the flight prowess of the turkey that is pro viding aerial power to the anthropomorphic figure but the reverse. In other words, the bird symbol does not modify the anthropomorphic figure but, rather, the anthropomorphic symbol modifies the bird fig ure. The anthropomorphic figure functioned in Bas ketmaker imagery to describe the supramundane. By adding such a figure beneath the turkey, the visual observer is able to distinguish between the turkey as bird and the turkey as spirit or supra mundane. I suggest that the artistic decision repre sented in the three depiction categories of (a) bird, (b) bird-on-head anthropomorph, and (c) bird headed anthropomorph are used to distinguish between the bird and its animal characteristics (a)</page><page sequence="10">828 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 75, No. 4, 2010 Figure 4.

In an ensouled world everything, both animate and inanimate, is filled with spirit (Price 2001). To provide a historical example, the Navajo refer to such depictions in their dry paintings as showing the "indwelling spiritual essence" (Zolbrod 1984:363). Moreover, in both oral narrative and visual depiction, the inner forms are "presented not as spiritual essences but as real characters" (Zol brod 1984:364). Ipropose that the bird-headed man is more appropriately a spirit-bodied bird. The increased frequency of these bird-headed images is not related to shamanic ritual but to the increased role of domestication of the turkey, initially for cer emonial use, and the need for a new visual vocab ulary. Barrier Canyon Anthropomorphic Tradition and Shamanic Transformation The exceptional yet different characteristics of the anthropomorphic-dominated rock art referred to as the Barrier Canyon Style of the Colorado Plateau have led to an interpretation that these Archaic images also reflect the ecstatic/trance state of shamanic activity. The imagery is purported to be shamanic based on the following key features: (i) frequent association between anthropomorphic fig ures and bird imagery (but no bird-on-head or bird headed imagery), (ii) recurrent depiction of animal spirit helpers, (iii) visual rendering of a trance state, and (iv) two-horned headdresses. Schaafsma, e.g., summarizes this view, stating that Barrier Canyon Style anthropomorphs have attributes and associations characteristic of shamans throughout the world. Horns, which are one type of headdress occurring on Barrier Canyon Style figures, are almost universally emblematic of shamanic and supernatural power. Animal spirit helpers, common to the shamanic realm [Furst 1974:135], may explain the many tiny animals and birds.... Birds in this context may symbolize the shamanic power of magic flight; the bird may lead the soul in flight, or the soul may actually change into a bird [1980:71]. Schaafsma further concludes that (i) such signs of ecstatic journeys of shamans are characteristic of Barrier Canyon Style rock art, where "we are not viewing living human beings as such, but trans formed anthropomorphic forms replete with trance and death symbolism," and that (ii) "the abstracted anthropomorph with its attendant death and trans formational symbolism is the main subject of this art" (1994:52, 50). Analyzing the purported key shamanic charac teristics first before further developing the cogni tive model application, I would like to review the evidence of a putative trance state. Numerous researchers have remarked on the "ghostly" aspect of Barrier Canyon anthropomorphs. In the West ern artistic tradition, the "ghost" is most frequently depicted as elongate and limbless. In the Archaic Barrier Canyon anthropomorph, appendages are similarly often lacking, rendering the limbless fig ure to appear exceptionally elongated, a character istic ascribed by Schaaf sma to hallucinatory trance: "One of the somatic effects of hallucinogens is the sense of bodily elongation" (1994:52). Such elon gated anthropomorphs have then been interpreted as "pictures of shamans experiencing symbolic death and at times transformation" (Schaafsma 1994:51). In numerous other instances, however, the arms and hands of the Barrier Canyon Style anthropo morphic figure are both present and active, or at least one arm is present and active, and legs fre quently end in feet. Moreover, the shapes of the feet are quite specific (and will be further discussed below). The heads are generally faceless, but over sized eyes may sometimes provide emphasis to the "ghostly" quality of the figure. Heads, generally round or trapezoidal in shape, bear projections fre quently termed "headdresses" in the form of horns, parallel antennae, feathered stalks, and crown-like rims of dots. Examples of such anthropomorphic figures with bodily elongation, limbs, and head projections are found in Castleton 1978:Figures 3.31-3.36, 1979:Figures 8.27-8.41; Cole 1990:Plates 18-19, 21-28; Malotki and Weaver 2002:Plates 17-27; and Schaafsma 1980:Figures 40-48, Plates 1,4-8. Although originally described from fewer than 20 sites in 1971 (Schaafsma 1971), Barrier Canyon rock art is now known from more than 250 sites (Sucec 2008), principally throughout the Colorado and Green river drainages of the Colorado Plateau, extending across Arizona, Utah, and Colorado. Yet, unlike the San Juan Anthropomorphic Style, there</page><page sequence="12">830 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 75, No. 4,2010 are no known instances of bird-headed or bird-on headed anthropomorphs. Instead, the Barrier Canyon bird imagery is replete with instances of flying or spread-winged birds. Hedges describes an image of a spread-winged bird with an unusually long tail "seen to end in two human legs with feet" (1985:Figure 8) and infers that this is an explicit image of shamanic transformation: "The painting ... preserves the image of a human at the moment of transformation, just as his soul in the form of a bird begins its magical flight" (1985:91). Finally, there is the repeated characteristic of some Barrier Canyon imagery, especially upon close inspection, to include what the shamanic interpretation refers to as animal spirit helpers. In addition to birds, these small animals include snakes and quadrupeds. In the altered states of con sciousness model, the helping spirits assist the shaman to attain the ecstatic "otherworld" of the sky or the underworld: We may thus widen the concept of shamanis tic trance to infer two distinctive experiences, one, the extracorporeal flight of the shaman with the assistance of helping spirits, two, on the spot information passed to the shaman by helping spirits. In both cases the seance opens with the calling of these spirits. The trance state is identical with the mysterious world where they appear. Shamanism is unthinkable without the helping-spirits [Hultkrantz 1996:16]. Arguing against the shamanic altered states of consciousness model, I propose instead that this Archaic imagery better fits the predictions of the cognitive model. I posit that the Barrier Canyon anthropomorphic figures, variously described as spectral and ghostlike, refer to characters of supra mundane powers known both to the people who made the images and to the people observing the images and that these characters derive their mean ings from narratives, rather than shamanic halluci natory imagery. I posit that the artistic decision to render these anthropomorphic figures visible as unusually elon gated and with horned, antennaed, or stalked "head dresses" was not an attempt to depict a shamanic trance state but reflects instead a need to differen tiate these figures as supramundane entities, moti vated by the intentions of seeking their aid and illustrating oral narratives that repeated interactions between these entities of supernatural power and the formation and workings of an earthly land scape. The replete bird imagery only reinforces this interpretation, suggesting the role of messenger spirits whose proclivities and exploits were based on oral narratives derived from the cultural canopy. By comparison to the shamanic model, the cog nitive model sees the varied snake, quadruped, and bird imagery, generally shown hovering in close proximity to the heads and ears of the anthropo morphs and in several instances alighting on an upturned hand of an anthropomorph, as an artistic decision to depict what are better termed "mes senger spirits" rather than shamanic "helping spir its." Message-transmitting symbolism, not shamanic death and transformation symbolism, is more likely. In an ensouled world, helper spirits abound, and "messenging" is omnipresent. An interesting comparative example of purported mes senging in both the Barrier Canyon (Archaic) anthropomorphic tradition and the San Juan (Bas ketmaker) anthropomorphic tradition compares a small winged figure held on the upturned hand of a Barrier Canyon figure (Figure 5a) and a small fig ure perched on the shoulder on a San Juan figure (Figure 5b). The associations appear friendly, even intimate. If we consider an ethnographic example from the historical period on the Colorado Plateau, the Navajo dry paintings depict numerous animal mes sengers that function to transmit bidirectional mes sages between the earthly and spirit worlds. According to Wyman, the animal Big Fly has been called the deus ex machina of Navajo mythology, for it is mentor and mon itor of humans and supernaturals alike, medi ating their disagreements, helping and instructing them. Because of its small size it can sit on one's ear or shoulder and whisper instructions, and it can go everywhere. . . . Hence it is omniscient and can warn or inform [1983:71]. Consequently, the mythical insect appears in the dry paintings of nearly every ceremonial. Barrier Canyon imagery of both hovering and perching messenger spirits is presented in Figure 6. Barrier Canyon Anthropomorphic Style figures that are limbed can also be distinguished by the</page><page sequence="13">Kitchell] BASKETMAKER AND ARCHAIC ROCK ART OF THE COLORADO PLATEAU 831 a Figure 5. Messenger spirits and anthropomorphs: (a) Barrier Canyon pictograph in red with blue eyes and blue snake in mouth, Seven Mile Canyon, Utah (drawn from photograph by Doak Heyser); (b) Basketmaker petroglyph, Lower Butler Wash, San Juan County, Utah (drawn from photograph by Don Austin). depiction of their feet, which range from out-turned, to forked, to wheeled, to rootlike, and a single com position may feature multiple types, as illustrated in Figure 7 (see also Figure 9b below). It is my assertion that such imagery represents an artistic device to allow for differentiation of the roles played by various supramundane entities, whether in narrative form, supplication, or homage. Some Barrier Canyon imagery has the excep tional characteristic of depicting a group activity, in which numerous figures are involved in what has been called supplication, such as those in Figure 8. It is a more likely argument that these supplication images are showing narrative events, perhaps a depiction of a ceremony done by the gods or between the gods and the first people or a depic tion of an early event of creation, than that they are depicting a shamanic seance. Out-Groups and Testable Predictions Testing between alternative models may involve use of an "out-group" to provide for testable pre dictions. An out-group is an unrelated group used for the purposes of comparison. An appropriate out-group for comparison to the putative shamanic imagery of the San Juan Anthropomorphic and Bar rier Canyon Anthropomorphic styles would be a group that satisfies these criteria: known to be non shamanic and nonecstatic, known to use extensive visual imagery in which anthropomorphic images abound, and known to have a vast compilation of ethnographic and historical evidence from sites on the Colorado Plateau. A testable prediction would then be that the two groups under study would dif fer from this out-group in terms of paleoimagery. The Navajo are an out-group that fits these cri teria. Their visual imagery, although not driven by any aspects of the shamanic model, is replete with artistic mechanisms of distinguishing specific supramundane entities. Such mechanisms include headdresses; designs of the feet; bodily elongation; facial features; messenger spirits; bird, snake, and quadruped imagery; etc. Yet in no case is the visual imagery depicting a shaman, a trance state, or a psy chopomp. As a consequence, such visual imagery is insufficient evidence of shamanic activity. But the out-group comparison can be further extended across a temporal gradient. Although it contains an implicit assumption of cultural conti nuity, an interesting prediction made by Barnes (2000) is that there should be an inverse relation ship between the post-Basketmaker development of kivas and the prevalence of rock art.

Lee). Barnes states that "as use of kiva and kiva-wall art for religious functions increased, the use of near or remote special outdoor sites and rock art for these purposes would decrease, as would the importance of rock art in general" (2000:63). Such a predic tion seems borne out by the observation that much of the Basketmaker II and III anthropomorphic dominated rock art phased out on the Colorado Plateau coincident with the time of the appearance of large kivas (Schaafsma 1994). Kivas would rep resent an excellent means of better preserving the imagery as well as a means of moving the visual imagery into seclusion and restricting access, an excellent defensive strategy in a historical world of increasing invasion. Processional Imagery An argument has been made that Basketmaker II and III San Juan anthropomorphic-dominated rock art gave way to replacement by "processional" imagery, reflecting a new ideology, a change from an "autocentric and static" anthropomorph to "more rhetorical discursive constructions" (Robins and Hays-Gilpin 2000:241). The distinguishing char acteristics of processional paleoimagery are that (i) the figures are many and diminutive (compared to other figures in the composition), (ii) there is a sense of closeness between the figures, (iii) the frontal view is generally exchanged for the side view, and (iv) there is an implication of directional "following" and active movement forward. Interpretations have been several. In addition to the narrative description (Robins and Hays-Gilpin 2000; Schaafsma 1980), both Manning (1992) and Hyder (2004) have proposed that the imagery may record an intercommunity Basketmaker assembly, drawing attention especially to the "Procession Panel" on Comb Ridge, Utah, involving approxi mately 200 diminutive figures. Manning (1992:22) interprets this panel as a depiction of people prepar ing for an event to take place inside a ring struc ture. The presence of atlatls led Manning to place the imagery in the Basketmaker rather than Puebloan period. Upon close inspection, the panel is remarkably complex, including several bird-on headed anthropomorphs. Close-ups of the diversity of these figures are provided in Figure 9a. Another Basketmaker example is found in Broken Flute Cave, in the Prayer Rock district of northeastern Arizona, where Hays-Gilpin (2000:Figure 3.1; Morris 1980) schematically shows a long line of processional imagery, reporting that these are "pro cessions of humans" (Hays-Gilpin 2000:36). On the basis of tree ring dates within Broken Flute Cave, Hays-Gilpin (1996) concludes that "proces sions become a popular rock art motif probably sometime in the A.D. 600s" (Robins and Hays Gilpin 2000:241). Figure 9c illustrates another Bas ketmaker processional panel from Grand Gulch, Utah, of approximately 21 diminutive figures in faded white pigment in association with the much larger static anthropomorph. A similar processional motif occurs within Bar</page><page sequence="17">Kitchell] BASKETMAKER AND ARCHAIC ROCK ART OF THE COLORADO PLATEAU 835 Figure 9.

A complex panel, anchored on one end by a large-sized Barrier Canyon anthropomorph and several sets of medium-sized anthropomorphs, occurs in the San Rafael Swell, Utah, where in addition to proces sions of quadrupeds, there is a long line of diminu tive anthropomorphs, again in a horizontal line at the approximate mid-torso of the larger dominant</page><page sequence="18">836 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 75, No. 4,2010 figures (Figure 9b). A processional pictograph in red pigment, from Deer Canyon near the Escalante River, Garfield Co., Utah (Figure 10a), depicts a forward-moving line of individuated figures. Fig ure 10b shows the detail of a small processional panel associated with a much larger Barrier Canyon Style panel illustrated in part in Figure 6g. These processional figures are very similar to the remnants of a Barrier Canyon Style procession in Seven Mile Canyon, north of Moab, Utah (Figure 10c), located to the right of a Barrier Canyon panel with hover ing messenger spirits. Another Barrier Canyon panel in Buckhorn Wash similarly features two pro cessional sets of diminutive figures, one running above the heads of the much larger anthropomor phic figures and the other running at their mid torso level (Figure lOd). I would argue, then, that the visual technique of placing linear processions of forward-moving diminutive figures within a composition that includes larger figures is present in both Archaic Barrier Canyon panels and Basketmaker panels and is not necessarily representative of a new ide ology. Hence it is worth arguing against the inter pretation that processional imagery is a later development on the Colorado Plateau. I propose as well that processional panels more likely elaborate creation story and supramundane imagery than a depiction of a social event in the lives of the peo ple of the culture. The examples provide support to the interpre tation that diminutive figures depicted in proces sion, including bird-headed anthropomorphs, are not evidence of civic figures but more reasonably represent figures from culturally derived narratives. Per the cognitive model, the Archaic Barrier Canyon and Basketmaker artist was not a recorder of historical events. Nor are the processional pan els records made by the artist of an observed event. Rather, the processional panels more probably rep resent a visual problem-solving technique aimed at providing images of large, complex narrative stories that were never visually perceived by humans but were made manifest by the visual image. Conclusions Our access to the past is limited. Rock art repre sents a significant material remnant. Unlike mate rial remnants that provide us with access to the ways in which ancestral populations devised solu tions to the problems that beset survival, including the material remnants of shelter, clothing, and food storage and preparation, rock art provides a win dow through which we may glimpse the nonmate rial or ideational aspects of their unique cultural canopies. Susceptibility to entering an altered state of con sciousness is a shared human universal. The shamanic model, by focusing attention on that uni versal, makes a mistake of emphasis in the inter pretation of the paleoimagery of the anthropomorphic-dominated Barrier Canyon and San Juan rock art on the Colorado Plateau. Altered states of consciousness and shamanism are neither necessary nor sufficient to causally account for the purpose and visual content of this imagery. The cognitive model removes the emphasis on altered states of consciousness and provides an alternative explanation to hallucination and trance, by redi recting attention to the human narrative and to the interplay within the human cognitive system between perceptual imagery and stored mental imagery. Such an interplay arguably has been as important in the shaping of human cultures as the role of language. The cognitive model proposes that Archaic and Basketmaker ecologies and cultures on the Col orado Plateau developed a deity-centric visual lit eracy, based on intragroup shared narratives. The cognitive model thereby proposes an earlier adop tion of group ritual than some researchers have posited and a shift toward group ritual not requi sitely tied to the transition from a mobile hunter gatherer ecology to agriculture and more sedentary living. The cognitive model is explanatory and predic tive. It predicts that (i) anthropomorphic forms will be modified in certain ways that differ from nor mal human form depiction, (ii) these visual means of showing differences will be consistent at the theme level but different in the particularities of depicting individuals within that theme, (iii) these techniques will be used both by the creators of visual art using pigments and by those creators of visual art using incision techniques, (iv) the tech niques of illustration used (the nimbate figure rep resenting a functional analogue) will not be found to be part of the material culture at archaeological</page><page sequence="19">Kitchell] BASKETMAKER AND ARCHAIC ROCK ART OF THE COLORADO PLATEAU 837 Figure 10.

Experiments in neuroscience have found sup port for a linkage between stored mental imagery</page><page sequence="20">838 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 75, No. 4,2010 and the visual system. A culturally based case can be made that narrative-informed mental imagery finds means of visual expression through the tech niques of visual art, producing visual perceptions that feed back into the cognitive system of mental imagery, providing meaningful engagement with the unseeable. Although visual art provides a perceptual expe rience to the viewer, the maker of that visual art need not have "seen" the object in the external world or as a hallucination; instead, the maker of the visual art may have activated mental imagery instead of perceptual imagery, wherein that men tal imagery was produced from language to account for an unseen but significant universe of culturally derived supramundane events and entities. Like evolutionary theory, which predicts contingent change but does not specify the specifics of that change, the cognitive model posits a linkage between stored mental imagery and the need for visual discourse but does not specify the particu lars of that visual discourse. The comparative dichotomy, then, resides between an altered state of consciousness and an unaltered state, redirecting explanatory power from the field of hallucinatory effects and the ecstatic trance state associated with shamanism to the pur poseful creation of visual art and its functional role in providing visual feedback to the human cogni tive system. The "art" of storytelling (which includes song) requires conscious awareness and control, unlike the ecstatic trance. The "science" of visual art refers to the calculated use of metaphor, design, and dimension to invoke recognition of supramun dane concepts, entities, and events for which there is no visual existence outside of the art. I do not intend to say that artists simply drew on a stock of stored mental imagery when creating images; rather, these artists were involved in the dif ficult task of creating visual imagery from narra tives that depicted supramundane entities with special knowledge and powers, origin and creation theories, previously inhabited worlds, etc. And var ious techniques were employed to visually com municate the identification of these concepts to allow viewers to gain cognitive awareness via the mechanisms we are currently coming to better understand from experiments in neuroscience regarding visual perception, mental imagery, and the construction of a cognitive "reality."
