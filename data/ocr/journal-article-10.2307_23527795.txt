<plain_text><page sequence="1">MEMRA IN THE TARGUM TO ISAIAH DOMINGO MUfiOZ LEÖN The Targum of Isaiah contains material of a double framework. Accord ing to Bruce D. CHILTON (The Glory of Israel. The Theology and Proven ience of the Isaiah Targum, Sheffield, 1983), who follows the insights advanced by P. CHURGIN (Targum Jonathan to the Prophets, New Haven, 1927), the stratum one corresponds to the period between 60-132 C.E., that is the period between the last years before the destruction of the Second Temple until the defeat of Bar Kokhba by the Romans. The stratum two corresponds to the amoraite period. Chilton's study of the term Memra consists (as in the rest of the terms studied) in examinating the various associations in which this term is combined in his use in the Targum of Isaiah, mainly in order to establish that there is such a double framework above described. Our study, although recognizing the value of Chilton's approach, con templates the use of Memra in the Isaiah Targum in his linguistical and theological regard with the use of the same term in the targumim of Pen thateuch, as we have studied in our work Dios-Palabra. Memra en los Tar gumim del Pentateuco. Granada, 1974. By this way it will appear better the' distinctive traits of each Targum. In our .Study we follow the texts editions by J. F. STENNING (The Targum of Isaiah,1949) and A. SPERBER (The Bible in Aramaic III, The latter Prophets according to Targum Jonathan, Leiden, 1962). We had had at hand the recently pub lished A Concordance to the Targum of Isaiah by J.B. ZIJL, 1979. 1.- The recurrence of Memra in IsTg The term Memra appears 126 times almost always related to the divine Word. Only 2 times is it related to the human word (but in reference to Messiah) and 2 times is it related to the Word of the holy prophets. Thus we can say that Memra is a term consecrated to the Divine Word. A) Morphologically we have: - Mymr dYHWH (subject, complement or with preposition) 27 times - Mymry (subject, complement or with preposition) 51 times - Mymrk (complement or with preposition) 5 times - Mymrh (subject, complement or with preposition) 26 times ־ Mymr 17 times.

Both to gether are distinguished from the use of Memra in the Palestinian Targumim. There are some examples lexically and exegetically: a) Tgls. and TgOnq. have the verb qbl; T.P. have sm* b) Tgls. and TgOnq. have the prep, 'ry; T.P. 'rwm c) The sentence "to be with" is translated in Tgls. and TgOnq. "to be for you a help"; in P.T. (Neophiti) "to be with". d) Tgls. and TgOnq. have the sentence "His Memra will be your Saviour" (69,8 cf. 12,2); T.P. (Neofiti) have "His Memra will be God Saviour". e) Tgls. and TgOnq. translate the verb "Co descend" (yrd) with "to reveal thyself" cf. Tgls 64,2 'tglyt'; P.T. have the same verb but with Memra, Iqar or Shekinah. These and other details which have been emphasized by A. Tal, The Language of Targum of the Former Prophets and its Position within the Aramaic Dialects (Tel Aviv, 1975) show that Tgls. (and in general Tar gum of the Prophets) and TgOnq. have a similar history; Palestinian origin and subsequent official recension or approval in Babilonia, 3.- The Meaning of targumism Memra in Isaiah Targum Four question are under consideration: A) Is Memra a grammatical phenomenon signifying only, v.gr. Memri= myself; Memrek - you; Memreh = he; Memra of the Lord, = the person of God? After the discussion we have done in our work Dios-Palabra it would seem idle or supperflous to insist on. We think impossible to reduce the meaning of Memra to a grammatical pronoun. In this case it would be difficult to find an adequate explanation why the targu mist in certain contexts uses "Memri" and in other he uses "Shekinti" as a substitute for the pronoun "I". We do not need to indicate that Memra is not meant as a substitute ir order to avoid pronouncing the Divine Name nor is it an exegetical ־term which stand for 'HYH, the Name revealed by God to Moses, as 138</page><page sequence="5">Memra in the Targum to Isaiah argues C.T.R. HAYWARD "The Holy Name of God and the Prologue of St. John's Gospel", N.T.S. 25 (1978-1979) 16-32; cf. Chilton o.e. p. 14J note . B) What is then the meaning of Memra? Our conviction is that Memra in targumic use maintains its original meaning of Word. Memra related to God is the Divine Word. This meaning is coherent with the verbs and expression in which it is used. It must not be denied that the expres sion "Memra of YHWH" and specially the form "Memri", has got a value of "terminus technicus" and in certain cases its use seems similar to an appelativ but that does not exclude, rather it requires, the meaning of Word. Otherwise we should have a pure grammatical phenomenon, the pos sibility of which we have excluded. We must have in mind that even Titulature-terms do not 10.se■ their original meaning as far as they do not become a pure grammatical phenomenon. In other respects we must remember that the employ of the targumic Memra does not have any Titulature mark (automatism, substitution of the first person for the third, etc.) C) Is Memra an intermediary being, that is, an hypostatic or personal, divine or angelic being, distinct from God? The answer must be in the negative. In Isaiah Targum Memra does not appear as an independent entity (nor even is it used absolutely). Memra is always related to God. Memra is the divine Word. The distinction between God and His Word, sometimes clearly underlined (cf. Chilton),can not be interpreted as a personal or hypostatic distinction. It is only a way of explaining the manner of speaking about God in many biblical texts by introducing a feature which represents God as acting by His Word. D) Theological dimensions of the Targumism Memra in IsTg. We can distinguish the following main lines: a) The divine Word (Memra) as concrete reference or fundament of man's relation to God. The targumTst has substituted God by his Memra - in contexts with the verbs "to exult" (29,19a.19b; 41,16; 61,10), "to trust" (12,2; 25,8; 26,3.4.13; 36,7.13), "to hope for" (51,1; 60,9) etc., cf. supra l,B,e. These substitutions are a cathechetical and exegetical way ofasserting God's presence in His Word. - in contexts with the verbs "to hear", "to listen", "to rebel" etc. cf. l,B,e and 3,D,C. These substitutions underline that the divine Word is the concrete expression of God's Will. b) The creative Word of God (God who creates by His Word) In 44,24 (I suspended the heavens by my Memra) the targumist has sub stituted the heb. lbdw by bMemri. With this substitution the targumist gives us a coherent explanation of the creation by the divine Word, an idea common to the Early Judaism and N.T.; blfymry is then a theological interpretation. We meet the same explicitation in 45,12 (I have made the earth by my Memra) and 48,13 (by my Memra I have founded the earth). c) The revealing Word of God As we have seen above, Memra is used to substitute the hebrew term py (mouth) in several sentences, as "It has been•decreed by the Memra of 139</page><page sequence="6">Domingo Mufioz Leön of YHWH." (1,20; 34,16; 40,5; 58,14 cf. etiam 48,3 and 62,2); on the same way the heb. ql (voice) is substituted "voice of the Memra of the Lord" (6,8; 30,30.31; 66,6) and likewise the mentions of divine locution are substituted by Memra (8,5; 12,2b; 21,17; 22,5; 25,8). We meet also targumic expressions as "to rebel against the Memra of the Lord" or "against my Memra etc. (1,2; 42,27; 66,24) or "to transgress against..." (26,19; 28,21; 31,9; 32,5) or "to perform his Memra" (40,10.13; 62,11). Given that in these expressions God is substituted by his Memra, and the contexts are of a revealing character, we can conclude that targumic Memra has the connotations both of the divine revealing Word and of the Divine Will (in Law) which demands obedience (1,19). The prophetic word (memar cf. 63,10.11) is for the targumist a con crete actuation of the holy Spirit, d) The active (saving or punishing)Word of God The term Memra does appear as a substitute for God as subject of a lot of verbs, as we have seen in the paragraph l,B,b. The idea of protec tion (27,3), guidance (45,2), assistance (49,15) and especially the frequent construction "to be for you a help" to translate the formula heb. "to be with" (17,10; 41,10.13.14; 43,2.5) indicates that with the use of Memra the targumist wants to underline the idea of God who saves by his Word. The God's salvific action through his Memra embraces the oath in the days of Noah (54,9a), the covenant with Abraham (48,15a), the salvation in the past (12,2; 63,8) and in the future (59,17), cf. etiam the other actions expressed by the other verbs cited in l,B,b and 1,B,d. It is difficult to ascertain whether by expressing with the term Memra the protecting action of God, the targumist wants to underline the saving value of the divine Word through the Law or does he have in mind the efficacity of the divine Word of blessing and promise. The way the targumist speaks of, gives the impression that he is speaking of an ef ficacious dwine Word in a certain way consistence. As we have seen above,that does not imply any personification or hypostatization. The targumism Memra does appear also with verbs of punishment, v.gr. to hate (1,14), to annihilate (33,11), to scatter (40,24; 41,16), to turn to be an enemy (63,10); cf. etiam 36,10 (divine edict of punishing). Memra, as the divine Word, will be for vengeance (8,14), as fire (10,27; 30,17) and as a mighty river (30,28; 30,33); cf. etiam 59,19. The targumic usage of associating Memra with punishment agrees with the biblical tradition which conceives the divine Word as an instrument or medium of punishment (cf. 0s 6,5). e) Memra a$ antianthropomorphism As we have seen in various cases above mentioned, Memra is used as a term which subsitutes (or avoids) anthropomorphic expressions. So v.gr. eyes (1,16); hand (34,17; 50,11.17); mouth (1,20; 34,16; 40,5; 48,3; 58,14); tongue (30,27); soul (1,14); for the same question in the tar gumim of the Pentateuch, cf. M.L. KLEIN, Anthropomorphisms and Anthro popathisms in the Targumim of the Pentateuch. With parallel citations" from the Septuagint. Jerusalem, 1982 (in hebrew). 140</page><page sequence="7">Memra in the Targum to Isaiah There is a substitution which can not be called antianthropomorphism but is very particular. We are refering to the substitution of the heb. rwh by aram. Memra, v.gr. 30,28; 48,16; 59,19; 63,14. Cf. etiam the substitution of "rwh qdSw" by "Mymr nbyy qwd^yh" in 63,10.11 and also 11,25. In 11,4 and 28,6 Memar substitutes rwh in messianic reference; in 4,4 (twice) Memar also substitutes rwh in the context of divine judgement (cf. Chilton o.e. p. 142, n. 17). It is very difficult to ascertain whether in these substitutions we have a deliberate prevention against the use of rwlj qdysh (a substitu tion often appearing in P.T.) or it is only a substitution of explan atory finality. The possibility the targumist would have seen in the term rwh an anthropomorphic connotation seems excluded but perhaps the anthropomorphic or reverential^ reason can be found in the whole phrase that has been substituted. On other respects we find in IsTg. the adjective qdysh in addition to heb. rwh v.gr. 40,13 cf. etiam 30,33. f) The meaning of (divine) Word as center of Memra's associations Chilton (o.c supra p. 56-69) in his analysis of the term Memra dis־ tinguishes eight aspects: i) Memra as an occasion for rebellion; ii) Memra as an agent of punishment; iii) Memra as a demand for obedience; iv) Memra as edict; v) Memra as a voice; vi) Memra as a divine protection; vii) Memra as an eternal witness; viii) Memra as an intermediary. This view is interesting but we think it necessitates a point of unification: that is, a nuclear center about which the diverse aspects could obtain coherence. This nuclear center, for us, is the meaning of Memra as the divine Word. From the richness of the divine Word, which becomes concrete in its voice (v) and in its inexorable edict (iv), derives its creative strength (vii), its capacity X.ajprotect (vi) and to punish (ii), and the responsability of man for rebelling against it. This richness of the divine Word explains why the targumist substitutes by Memra the terms which express the vitality of God; eyes, hand, mouth, tongue, zeal. This richness is also the reason why the targumist does present the divine Word as if it was a consistent entity. CONCLUSION As we can see, the use of Memra in IsTg. is very similar to that of Onqelos and is a clear example of the whole targumic tradition which consists in substituting God's mention in definite contexts by his Word. The reasons the targumists had had for this are various (cathe chetical, theological, exegetical etc.) but the issue has been a theology of the Divine Word inserted in the biblical text. Within this great targumic tradition of representing God as acting by his Word, IsTg. does mention of the creative function of the Word and substitutes by Memra various expressions related to God's assistance to righteous and punishment to the evil. However, it underlines in a special way the meaning of Memra as a manifestation of the Divine Will 141</page><page sequence="8">Domingo Mufioz Leön in the Law and in Prophetic Word. Therefore, we find v.gr. to come to God = to come to his Memra (cf. 55,3), to rebel against God = to rebel against his Memra (cf. 1,2) etc. IsTg. in its development of the theology of the divine Word had as a great precedent the same Isaiah who does exalt as none the creative, revealing and saving value of God's Word (cf. Is 55,11). Note: The title of this lecture in the Ninth World Congress of Jewish Studies (1985) was "Memra, Iqar and Shekinah in Targum to Isaiah". Given the extent of the subject I have discussed only on Memra as here published. I have left the study of the terms Iqar and Shekinah for a publication in the review Estudios Biblicos. 142</page></plain_text>
