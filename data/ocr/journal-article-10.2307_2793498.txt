KOOIJMAN Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde, Leiden 139 In a recent article in MAN (I95I, i85) V. L. Grottanelli discusses the large wooden clubs with their broadened, open-worked tops and stone discs, which were found among several tribes in the western part of the Territory of Papua, and among the Marind Anim in the southern area of the Dutch territory. He designates these objects as 'baratu,' a term used by the inhabitants of the middle Fly region. The data on the meaning and function of these clubs are vague and fragmentary. In general, we really do not know any more than that they were ceremonial weapons, and were employed in connexion with headhunting. The author tries to answer the question of the original proven- ance of these clubs, and quotes (in note I6) Elkin's opinion that headhunting is 'a comparatively recent addition to the cultural heritage, having spread from Dutch New Guinea.' Therefore he considers it possible that the baratu had their origin among the Marind Anim tribe, but he adds that apart from the Leiden and the Giglioli clubs 'which are the only two originally labelled Tugeri,' he knows of no other records of such clubs from the Marind proper. However, the specimens mentioned by Grottanelli can be supplemented by baratu-like clubs from the Marind territories in Dutch ethnographical collections. Grottanelli speaks of the club-hayam-collected at the beginning of this century by W. de Jong at Merauke, which bears an imitation in wood of the stone disc under the fret-worked blade. This club (Plate Ga) forms part of the collection of the Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde, Leiden (No. 1392-63). It has been described and reproduced byJ. D. E. Schmeltz,' together with another hayam (No. I392-62)2 in the same collection and from the same place, which in shape and ornamentation of the blade is entirely similar to the first specimen, though the imitation stone disc is lacking. These discs, in this case actually made of stone, also occur on the clubs used by the Marind as real weapons.3 The disc can slide up and down part of the shaft. In battle the warrior brandishes the club over his head, making the stone slip backwards; when he delivers a blow,, the disc shoots forward, greatly adding to the impact. The disc is prevented from flying off the shaft or slipping too far back by a cord of plaited fibre, running parallel to the shaft, and fastened to it by two nooses knotted round the shaft, one at the front end and the other further back. The wooden disc of the first-mentioned hayam proves to be an exact replica of the stone discs belonging to the battle clubs. This hayam is also still equipped with the cord, although this has quite lost its function, the wooden ring being firmly attached to the shaft by a strip of split rattan wound round the latter. In the museum of the Koninklijk Instituut voor de Tropen at Amsterdam, there are two more specimens.4 Both were collected at Merauke during the expedition to the south-west coast of the island, in the years 1904-I905, on which occasion Merauke was used as a base. On these clubs all that remains of a replica or imitation of the disc is a ring-shaped broadening of the shaft below the blade. Although several of these baratu-like objects from the Marinid Anim area are known, we have no direct data on their purpose and function in Marind culture. In the following attempt to draw up a functional inter- pretation of these hayam I shall, for the moment, leave out of consideration Grottanelli's conclusions on the baratu of the Fly area, as well as his remarks, due to information from Father J. H. M. C. Boelaars, M.S.C., on the cere- monial clubs of the Yaqai, who inhabit the Mapi area. I shall try to reach a conclusion as to the meaning and use of these hayam within the framework of Marind culture, by taking into consideration other ceremonial objects of the Marind Anim. Such are the pahui, ceremonial clubs with broadened tops shaped either like a hollow cylinder or like an ellipsoid, which may be either hollow or solid. Ornamentation is applied by cutting away parts of the outer surface and making shallow incisions which form lines and figures. Practically without exception these objects show a ring- shaped thickening of the shaft just below the top-the rudiment of what originally was the counterfeit stone disc. I know of some seven pahui in Dutch museum collec- tions,5 one of which is illustrated in Plate Gd. Four more are listed in the catalogue of the ethnographical collection of the museum of the 'Lembaga kebudajaan Indonesia' (Koninklijk Bataviaas Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschappen) at Djakarta, Indonesia.6 Before discussing the function and use of these pahui, I must first mention another group of objects, the kui ahat or headhunting poles, certain specimens of which closely resemble the pahui in form and ornamentation. These kui ahat represent the ahat dema, a figure in Marind mythology, who may be characterized as 'God of the nether world,' and who is associated with death and decay.7 In the art of the Marind Anim the most 'realistic' representation of the ahat dema-realistic in the sense of most closely correspond- ing to the myth 8-is a greatly conventionalized wooden human figure. The body is rendered by an upright post with a head on top, at the sides of which two 'arms' branch out upwards 9 (Plate Gb). The kui ahat are, then, essentially identical with the ahat dema, and in addition they may be recognized-some more easily than others-as derived from this 'realistic' repre- sentation of the dema. There are two kui ahat which, though conventionalized, *With Plate G 97</page><page sequence="3">No. I39 Man JULY, 1952 are still close to the original. They consist of a tree trunk forking into two branches, with a rough rendering of the 'head' between these two raised 'arms.' One is from Sangasee, west of the mouth of the Bian River, where it was raised in I9I2 on the occasioll of a headhunting feast IO; the other is probably from Aweerima on the south coast near Prinses Marianne Strait.", Even further conventional- ized, but still easily recognizable as derived from the plastic ahat dema, are the kui ahat shaped like bamboo staves ter- minating at one end in two parallel tapering points.I2 Yet further reduced to its essential feature, viz. the forked pole, is an object characterized as a kui ahat which consists of a staff with a thick knob, the top of which is, as it were, scooped out, thus leaving two raised points.I3 Finally I know of a kui ahat consisting of a staff with a hollow, cylindrical top, the outer edge of which is incised with U-shaped figures.I4 So we see that this object bears great similarity to the pahui type with cylindrical top. This kui ahat, too, has a ring-shaped broadening of the staff below the hollow cylinder, which makes the resemblance to the pahui even greater. In fact, the pahui all have this U- or V-shaped motif on top as dominating ornament, either incised in the hollow outer rim, or as bas reliefor haut relief on the solid types. In a few cases the two lines of the V do not meet at the bottom, but this only applies to some specimens of the hollow type, I5 and is probably due to technical considerations, viz. to prevent the top being too fragile. In view of the outward resemblance in shape and orna- mentation between pahui and kui ahat, it seems likely that we are dealing with two types of objects which, if not functionally identical, do at least belong to the same sphere of life. This hypothesis is strengthened by a comparison between what we know of the use and meaning of the kui ahat, and the data on the function of the pahui. The kui ahat, that is the ahat dema, the god of death and decay, occupies the central place in the headhunting rites, and the feasts con- nected with them. It stands in the centre when, before a headhunting expedition, the ajassee, the headhunting song, is chanted. It accompanies the expedition itself, and is erected near the festive hut which is specially erected on the occasion of the expedition. The captured heads are hung up on it.i6 On the meaning of the pahui our data are scarcer and more fragmentary: In general we may say that they also play a part in headhunting. P. Wirz, for instance, designates three pahui with cylindrical tops in the Djakarta museum with the term Kopfjagdbanner.I7 Father J. Verschueren, M.S.C., also says that the pahui are used in headhunting expeditions.'8 We have more information on a pahui in the Leiden museum (No. 2385-36), collected by Dr. J. van Baal in the middle Koembe area (Plate Gc). In that region this object played a role practically similar to that of the kui ahat: it was placed in the centre when the ajassee was sung, and accompanied headhunting expeditions. According to information from Father Verschueren,I9 it was thrown away after one had killed a victim. A striking feature of this pahui is the ornamentation of the cylindrical surface above the U-shaped incision, which makes the impression of a double monster's head.zo Probably both interpretations of the U-a forked shaft or an animal's head-are correct, or at any rate not mutually contra- dictory. At least, we find a combination of both represen- tations on the soma, the great poles of the festive hut erected on the occasion of a headhunting expedition; they are essentially similar to the kui ahat, and may likewise bear the captured heads.2I These poles are forked at the end, and the forked ends are, at the same time, representations of serpents' heads.22 Therefore we can positively state that this pahui of the middle Koembe region is closely associated in form and function with the kui ahat, the representation of the ahat dema, with his dominating position in headhunting ritual. This pahui also bears resemblance to the hayam with its typical shape and ornamentation. Both have the lozenge- shaped motif in the centre, with other lines curving round it, and also the replica of the disc. The hayam, however, lacks the forked terminal, the U- or V-shaped figure, which is the typical symbol for the attributes of the headhunting expeditions and headhunting ritual. This might lead us to suppose that the hayam do not belong in this sphere. On the other hand, the function and the use of the baratu-likeparasi from the Keraki and Wiram areas, described by F. E. Williams, are markedly similar to what we know of the above-mentioned pahui; both accompanied the headhunting expedition, and both were discarded after use.23 If we take into account the function of this analogous parasi from the Fly region, we reach the tentative conclusion that the hayam are probably function- ally associated with the kui ahat and the pahui, with their clearly observable role in headhunting ritual. Although I have been able to indicate, with considerable reserve, what was the place and meaning of the hayam in Marind culture, we are still in the dark as to the decoration of the blade. A number of its elements-the lozenge- shaped centre with the curved lines round it-also occur on the pahui, but the pattern as a whole is unusual within the framework of the ornamental art of New Guinea and the Pacific. The anthropomorphic representation of the ahat dema, with which the hayam is probably functionally connected via the pahui and kui ahat, is equally unusual. In additioln these two types of objects-the ahat dema figure in the round and the open-worked hayam blade-rather resemble one another. In view of this, we might be justified in consider- ing the 6rnamented blade of the hayam as derived from the ahat dema in the round. This would directly link the ahat dema, the central figure in the headhunting ritual, with the hayam. However, we do well clearly to realize that this cannot be more than a hypothesis until reliable data can be obtained from the population to confirm this stylistic association. The spears of the Mapi area with their 'flat oval slab carved out of the shaft and perforated with ornamental patterns' 24 are well represented in Dutch museum col- lections.25 In connexion with the ornamentation of these slabs, Grottanelli speaks of a style strongly reminiscent of 98</page><page sequence="4">JULY, I952 Man Nos. 139, 140 the baratu tops. Nevertheless the broad slabs of the Mapi spears-at least of the specimens known to me-with curvilinear decoration, differ so greatly from the narrow blades of the hayam, with rectilinear decoration, that it is hardly possible that the decorative pattern of the hayam could have been derived from these objects of the Mapi area. Besides the not too firmly based hypothesis that the hayam is a conventionalization of the ahat dema, there remains the possibility that objects occur in this still very slightly known territory, bearing a similar ornamentation, which may have become known to the Marind.
