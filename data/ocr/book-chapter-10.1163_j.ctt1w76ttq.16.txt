<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> chapter 11 Distinctive Contours of Jesuit Enlightenment   in France Jeffrey D. Burson Due largely to their persecution of more radical strains of Enlightenment that  emerged from Diderot’s editorship of the Encyclopédie, many historians have  too commonly neglected the important contributions of French Jesuit scholars  to eighteenth-century culture. The distinctiveness of French Jesuit contribu- tions to scholarship during the century of Enlightenment is the subject of this  chapter. This chapter also emphasizes some of the ways in which the radical- ization of the eighteenth-century French siècle de lumières—specifically its  strains of atheism and materialism—were ironically shaped, however acciden- tally and indeed unintentionally, by debates already well underway among  Jesuit intellectuals themselves.1 Accordingly, this chapter participates in a  broader trend, evident among church historians as well as intellectual histori- ans, of restoring agency to Jesuit writers in helping to forge the scholarly milieu  from which emerged the wider European Enlightenment, even if the Jesuit  contribution to the Enlightenment is often ironic in that many philosophes  subverted the original impetus for Jesuit scholarship. This chapter also partici- pates in scholarly conversations sparked in various ways by historians Alan C.  Kors, Ann Thomson, and Margaret C. Jacob whose work situates the origins of  Enlightenment radicalism in France, not strictly within a supposedly Spinozan  atheism but rather within a more complex dialogue among theologians, scien- tists, and lay writers throughout Western Europe.2 1 The standard work on the Jesuit contributions to the Enlightenment remains Robert R.  Palmer, Catholics and Unbelievers in Eighteenth-Century France (Princeton, nj: Princeton  University Press, 1939); Dale K. Van Kley, “Robert R. Palmer’s Catholics and Unbelievers in  Eighteenth-Century France: An Overdue Tribute,” Historical Reflections/Réflexions Historiques  37, no. 3 (Winter 2011): 18–37. My own research nuances and contextualizes Palmer by noting  how the Jesuit engagement with the Enlightenment ebbed and flowed in ways that both  reacted to, and inadvertently created, the radicalization of the Enlightenment. 2 Alan C.

The question is not without its many complexities, if only  because there is presently no clear consensus among eighteenth-century schol- ars as to how the Enlightenment ought to be defined, or when and where it took  place. Conventionally, the Enlightenment has been defined as a largely (but not  exclusively) eighteenth-century cultural and intellectual movement that opti- mistically assumed that extensive improvement of human nature was possible  through educational reform, the popularization of the scientific method of  empirical reason and its pervasive application to practical problems of socio- political reform. In addition, the Enlightenment is often defined as being almost  essentially motivated by “modern paganism” whether in the form of attacks on  established clergies, religious orthodoxies and orthopraxis, or a pervasive mate- rialism that favored the disenchantment of nature and the secularization of the  concept of the mind and soul.3 Complicating these rather straightforward  entre religion et science Angleterre–France (1690–1760) (Paris: Epoques Champ Vallon,  2013); Thomson, “‘Mechanistic Materialism’ vs. ‘Vitalistic Materialism’?” in La Lettre de la  Maison française d’Oxford 14 (2001): 22–36; also John Wright, “Materialismo e anima vitale  alla metà del xviii secolo.

Ever since the historian J.G.A. Pocock (1924–) first raised the  issue in the context of the English Enlightenment, some scholars have favored  the subdivision of the Enlightenment project into various Enlightenments,  many of which could not be described as uniformly anticlerical.4 Thus it is now  possible to speak of various styles of “Religious Enlightenment”—a “Jewish Enli- ghtenment,” a “Protestant Enlightenment,” and a “Catholic Enlightenment”—or  even different variants within the Catholic Enlightenment.5 Still others, begin- ning with the authors of the seminal volume, The Enlightenment in National  Context, historians Roy Porter (1946–2002) and Mikuláš Teich, have preferred to  thesis, see Jean-François Lyotard, The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge, trans.

Israel’s volumes controversially trace what he considers the Enlightenment van- guard—the Radical Enlightenment, especially of Spinoza (1632–77)—through- out nearly two centuries from 1650 in the Netherlands and onward.11 Still others  6 Roy Porter and Mikuláš Teich, eds., The Enlightenment in National Context (Cambridge:  Cambridge University Press, 1981). 7 Carolina Armenteros, “Introduction,” Joseph de Maistre and the Legacy of Enlightenment,  ed.

Indeed, classical republi- can thought, indebted as much to the fourteenth through seventeenth centu- ries as to the eighteenth, has also been given a privileged position in the  transformation of eighteenth-century political and revolutionary thought.12 It is far beyond the scope of this essay on the Jesuits to delve more thoroughly  into every niche of so many historiographical controversies; I mention them here  only as an important caveat to what follows, namely that with almost no agree- ment concerning what the Enlightenment is, it is very hard to address whether,  or to what extent, one might speak of a Jesuit contribution to the Enlightenment.  In any event, I have addressed the thornier issue of whether there truly was a  Jesuit Enlightenment elsewhere.13 Rather, this essay will solely describe some  salient characteristics of Jesuit scholarship in order to elucidate the distinctive- ness of the Jesuit contribution to the eighteenth century. If one defines the  Enlightenment as being essentially about the limitless ability of human reason to  improve itself by criticizing all forms of authority, especially established religious  authorities, and if the disenchantment of nature to the point of materialism or  even atheism is similarly vital to the Enlightenment, then it must be said that the  Jesuit contribution to the century of the Enlightenment was vastly different. Many Jesuits in Europe, including and especially French Jesuits associated with  their Parisian school Louis-le-Grand, were among the cultural elite of the early to  middle eighteenth-century republic of letters. Many believed that advancements  in natural philosophy, history, epistemology, and science could and should be  used, both for the moral edification of society, and for the apologetic utility of their  own promotion and defense of the Catholic faith.

In cit- ing the example of the Jesuit missionaries of China, Tournemine noted that not  until Matteo Ricci (1552–1610) did Christianity achieve success in China, and the  ticket to such success lay in the Jesuits’ ability to address the interests of the Chinese  scholar gentry in mathematics and natural philosophy. In Tournemine’s judgment,  therefore, the grace of God was necessary and efficacious for conversion, but divine  grace, he argued, often worked through human agency, and thus has more chance  of achieving its end if missionary-scholars like the Jesuits affect to be “all things to  all people.”14 Progress in the arts and letters, and in particular in mathematics and  modern science, was considered by many eighteenth-century Jesuits as the means  by which grace must come to a new, more enlightened generation. And this fact,  Tournemine believed, would be true as much of Europe as it was in China.15 Early in the eighteenth century, Tournemine was among an influential cadre  of Jesuits who articulated a broadening of the Jesuit spirit of the Ratio studio- rum for the eighteenth-century age of Enlightenment: he exhorted that one  must approach study, sometimes even of suspect authors and non-Christian  texts, as a prayerful act and a means of devoting one’s heart and will to God,  because in so doing, the church would better address the concerns of the cos- mopolitan eighteenth century.16 Engagement with an increasingly globalized  corpus of texts from human antiquity (even outside of Europe) and critical  engagement with the textual output of the Enlightenment was to serve an  apologetical and ultimately evangelical end: the defense and dissemination of  what Jesuits considered to be the one truly divine religion. For this reason, surmised Tournemine, the elites of the early eighteenth cen- tury continued to flock to the Jesuits, just as Chinese elites had flocked to  seventeenth-century Jesuit missionaries, because the Jesuit order was able  to teach the sciences and arts most useful to the sons of the nobles and haute  bourgeoisie, while preserving and fortifying their commitment to the church.  Unlike the early days of Christianity, Tournemine warned, “the time of having  any hope of rendering very much glory to God, or very much service to one’s  neighbor without the support of divine and human sciences is no more.”17  14 Florence C.

In what follows, I will develop this overarching emphasis by more closely  examining the intersection of Jesuit moral philosophy, apologetics, and his- toricism; it is in no way intended to be a comprehensive study of the totality of  Jesuit scholarship in the eighteenth century.18  Eighteenth-Century Jesuit Moral Philosophy, Apologetics, and  Historicism Insofar as a general optimism concerning the predilection of human nature for  rational reform and improvement is crucial to the spirit of the century, there  remains no question that many Jesuits shared such optimism whether or not  Ibid., 332; also 331, 345; see also Martin A.

Such speculations concerning  the slow end of this more optimistic state of nature provided a theological jus- tification for the integrity of their moral theology and sometimes even facili- tated debate with early Enlightenment writers. But contrary to the frequent  accusations by Jansenists that Jesuits followed Luis de Molina (1535–1600),  most Jesuits actually invoked their understanding of the authority of Thomas  Aquinas (1225–74) to defend their notions about human nature, notions which  unsurprisingly remained rooted in the Council of Trent: that Adam was cre- ated with a human nature that was essentially pure and perfectible.20 Indeed,  this must be the case since a perfect God could not have created an essentially  defective human nature. Accordingly, Jesuits understood supernatural grace to  have fortified Adam’s nature until the fall, at which point this efficacious grace  was revoked and human nature slowly drifted into sin. The Jesuit view repre- sented a critical departure from the prevailing opinion of many French clergy  influenced by Pasquier Quesnel’s (1634–1719) interpretation of the fall—that  human nature had been corrupted at its essence. To Jesuits, Quesnel’s interpre- tation, which many Jansenists shared (and even many non-Jansenist servants  of the Gallican church), implied that the choice of the first man to sin could  unmake an essence over which God alone possessed the power of creation.21  Jesuit moral philosophy thus presupposed a generally more optimistic  appraisal of human nature which facilitated dialogue with the developing  Enlightenment during the eighteenth century, and in fact, often comported  well with the “rehabilitation of human nature” assumed by many less orthodox  writers of the middle eighteenth century.22 Yet, because Jesuits believed by faith that human nature was not depraved  at its essence, but instead that the perfective and supernatural grace of God  was only removed at the fall, it therefore became possible to conceive of an  early and even partially postlapsarian state of nature that had degenerated  over time owing to the very nature of the human soul when no longer ignited  19 Palmer, Catholics and Unbelievers, 117–25. 20 Alexander Aichele and Matthias Kaufmann, eds., A Companion to Luis de Molina (Leiden:  Brill, 2013). 21 Jean Ehrard, L’Idée de la nature en France dans la première moitié du xviiie siècle (Geneva:  Slatkine, 1981; 1969), 438–40. 22 Northeast, Parisian Jesuits, 217–18; Roger Mercier, La réhabilitation de la nature humaine,  1700–1750 (Villemomble: Éditions La Balance, 1960). &lt;UN&gt; </page> <page sequence="9"> 220 burson and perfected by supernatural grace. As Claude Buffier (1661–1737), the Jesuit  editor of the Mémoires de Trévoux (Memoirs of Trévoux), argued, the natural  sentiment of humanity—our common sense—was warped after the fall  because natural reason was then inexorably dependent upon sense percep- tion.23 This definition of original sin as resulting from the natural corruptibility  of human understanding and moral behavior unites Jesuit moral philosophy  with views shared by other Enlightenment thinkers. Pierre Bayle (1647–1706)  argued that primitive humanity found itself beset by fear of inexplicable natu- ral forces, and that this in turn led to superstition and idolatry.24 For John  Locke (1632–1704), whose views were among those which directly informed  Buffier’s own, early humans, while still bereft of natural science, tended to  ascribe inexplicable natural catastrophes to the vengeance of angry anthropo- morphic beings inhabiting nature. These entities were thought to require  appeasement, and were therefore worshiped as gods or spirits. Such was the  opinion of Locke, for example, and it was in many respects apologetically  adapted by Buffier in works such as Traité des premières vérités (Treatise  concerning first principles) that effectively blended different strains of  Cartesianism with Locke’s sense-based empiricism.25 Enlightenment writers  23 Claude G.

Because Jesuits accepted that human understanding (whether concerning  moral, religious, or scientific “facts”) was liable to corruption because of the  very nature of sense perception, all of them concluded that natural theology  would never be sufficient, and in this respect, they differed from more radical  writers in the later years of the Enlightenment, for whom reason was suffi- cient. Jesuits contended that individual reason, even once properly enlight- ened, remained powerless to maintain or rediscover the pristine natural  revelation of God. Thus, Jesuits and other apologists of the eighteenth century  only considered the revealed religion of the Catholic Church to be philosophi- cally necessary as an effective bulwark against the inherently corruptive ten- dencies of natural reason. However, for such a claim to be palatable to  eighteenth-century readers, the Jesuits became the vanguard of a style of  apologetics that attempted to demonstrate that the traditions of the church  and its teachings were historically verifiable in toto in an unbroken succession  dating to within living memory of Jesus himself.26 The task before many eigh- teenth-century apologists, then, was to develop methods based on empirical  principles that would more aptly verify the likely divine inspiration of the  Catholic religion based on historical evidence. These apologetics drew from an  eclectic array of sources, and were designed to guide the reader to the conclu- sion that divine revelation rested with the church and was the only surety  against the vulnerability of human understanding to fears, passions, and the  needs of the body. To a great extent, the eighteenth-century pedagogical ethos of the Jesuit  scriptores concerning moral philosophy, apologetics, and natural science  remained rooted in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century humanism. This real- ity begs an important question: what is so distinctive about the Jesuit contribu- tion to the eighteenth century? In other words, what is really so different from  early modern modes of Renaissance criticism and natural philosophy in which  the Society participated from its founding? In answering this question, one  does well to recall that this question has been asked of the Enlightenment  more generally, and many scholars are revisiting the continuities between the  sixteenth and eighteenth centuries as a whole.27 Ann Thomson’s recent work  26 Burson, Rise and Fall of Theological Enlightenment, 64–70. 27 For my own reflections on narrowing the gap between sixteenth- and eighteenth-century  intellectual history, see Jeffrey D.

Kevin Cope (New York: ams Press, 2016). &lt;UN&gt; </page> <page sequence="11"> 222 burson has underscored the importance of early seventeenth-century religious  debates to the circulation of more radical scientific materialism in the eigh- teenth century.28 Dennis Des Chene and Anthony Kenny, historians of philoso- phy, have reminded us of the subtle but dynamic evolution of Aristotelian  modes of Scholasticism and natural philosophy that to a large extent served as  prelude to the Enlightenment.29 Historian Dan Edelstein’s genealogy of the  Enlightenment firmly roots at least the French Enlightenment in the quarrel  over the primacy of the ancients and moderns on the one hand, and the endur- ing legacy of Greek and Roman writers on the other.30 Scholars such as Neven  Leddy, Avi Lifschitz, Thomas Ahnert, Charles T. Wolfe, and James A. Harris  have revisited the role of Epicurean texts and motifs to the Enlightenment,  while intellectual historian Tim Stuart-Buttle has recently made the controver- sial but fascinating suggestion that Cicero was more commonly cited during  the eighteenth century than the sixteenth.31 To consider the culture of the  eighteenth century, including that of the Enlightenment, as firmly rooted in  gradual changes to various modes of early modern scholarship dating to the  Renaissance at least is not uncommon today, and such continuities afford us  more space to examine Jesuit contributions to the Enlightenment, not less. To observe, quantify, and apprehend nature was an act of moral edification,  and in that sense, directly descended from the gentlemanly ideal of the vir  virtutis. Study of nature supplemented and corrected study of ancients for the  moral utility of society. While arguably unique among Catholic Reformation  religious orders, this Jesuit intersection of piety and pedagogy is the same as  the self-fashioned identity of the scholar-missionary so central to the scien- tific missionaries studied by cultural historian Florence Hsia, and it is related  to the same polymathic ideal that motivated Leibniz (1646–1716) and Descartes  28 Thomson, Bodies of Thought, 22–27, 229–37; Thomson, L’âme des Lumières. 29 Dennis Des Chene, Physiologia: Natural Philosophy in Late Aristotelian and Cartesian  Thought (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1996), 3–4; Anthony Kenny, Essays on the  Aristotelian Tradition (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 2001), 5–6, 9. 30 Dan Edelstein, The Enlightenment: A Genealogy (Chicago: University of Chicago Press,  2010), 1–19, 37–52. 31 Thomas Ahnert, “Epicureanism and the Transformation of Natural Law in the Early  German Enlightenment”; Charles T.

What is increasingly distinctive about the Jesuit scholarship of  the eighteenth century, however, is its emphasis on the intersection of Catholic  erudition, apologetics, and social utility.32 The use of empirical reason to  sound out its own limits, probe the depths of natural wonders, and discern  commonalities and discontinuities within an increasingly global corpus of  ancient texts (often translated and studied by Jesuit missionary-scholars  themselves) was considered even more vital to the reform of society and pro- motion of Catholic piety in the eighteenth century. Such a subtle but signifi- cant shift toward historical-critical apologetics, and the augmentation of their  socio-religious importance, is already evident in the early years of the eigh- teenth century. Jesuits thus made distinctive contributions to such historical  apologetics, and even derived important methods of historical historicity to  evaluate historical sources and eyewitness testimony. Buffier in particular  derived important methods of historical historicity to evaluate historical  sources and eyewitness testimony. Buffier did so by expanding upon Locke’s  rules for historical probability, and he used them to develop methods for   evaluating the historical certitude of the Gospels and the authenticity of  the  Catholic Church’s revealed teachings.33 Such methods became widely  32 On the cultural continuities between the emergence of the seventeenth-century revolu- tion in natural philosophy and the culture of the Renaissance, see Matthew L.

Even from as early as the work by Jesuit controversialist  François Véron (1575–1649), entitled Méthodes de traiter des controverses de reli- gion (Methods for treating religious controversies) in 1638, some Jesuits had  attempted to disassociate speculative reason from the content of sacred myster- ies themselves, making theology dependent more upon the moral proofs of  historico-empirical analysis and textual transmission. As another Jesuit, Pierre- Daniel Huet (1630–1721), argued in his posthumously published critique of  Descartes and Spinoza, Alnetanae quaestiones de concordia rationis et fidei  (Questions concerning the concord of religion and faith, 1690), the veracity of  dogma—even the veracity of such foundational doctrines as the existence of  God and the immortality of the human soul—remains impervious to proofs  afforded by speculative reason.35 Theology thereby became a science increas- ingly concerned with uncovering empirical evidence for the veracity of scrip- tural texts and church traditions in history—a point not far from Richard Simon’s  (1638–1712) own approach to biblical scholarship. In fact, despite his many crit- ics, some Jesuit controversialists greatly admired Simon. The Jesuit Étienne  Souciet (1671–1744) sent Simon manuscripts for critique, and the controversial  Jesuit writer Jean Hardouin (1646–1729) was a friend of Simon as well.36 Common Sense,” Journal of Modern History 80 (2008): 1–54; Francisque Bouillier, Histoire  de la philosophie cartésienne, 3rd ed.

Huet’s Demonstratio evangelica (1679) responded  to Spinoza’s critique of the historical authenticity of the Pentateuch with  acclamation by the famous German philosopher of natural law, Samuel von  Pufendorf (1632–94). In it, Huet argued that all peoples possessed corrupted  copies of the Old Testament religion of the patriarchs preserved by Moses, and  transmitted ultimately by Catholic Church teaching. Huet sustained his argu- ment in a remarkable piece of erudition destined to become an eighteenth- century progenitor of comparative religious history; its thesis, that the  Pentateuch contained the most authentic surviving traits of God’s original  natural theology, cross-references ancient Greek and Roman sources with  mythological, philosophical, and archeological sources from Egyptian, Chinese,  Persian, Germanic, American Indian, and Celtic history.39 Huet’s Demonstratio  evangelica continued to be read in Jesuit and Lazarist seminaries throughout  Paris as late as the 1740s and 1750s, and it served as a source of controversy and  inspiration to many highly influential apologists of the 1720s–50s, including  Abbé d’Houtteville (1686–1742), author of Religion chrétienne prouvée par les  faits (The Christian religion proven by facts; originally 1722, but substantially  c.1700–1830” (PhD diss., Ohio State University, 2014), and Anthony Grafton, “Jean  Hardouin: The Antiquary as Pariah,” Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes  61 (1999): 241–67. 37 For varieties of apologetics during the Enlightenment and diverse interpretations of the  Jesuit apologists, see Masseau, Les ennemis des philosophes; William R.

Essential to this output, and the object of much  study in recent years, is the tremendous textual output of the Jesuit missionar- ies to China. One of the French Jesuit missionaries, Philippe Couplet (1623–93),  helped introduce the philosophy of Confucius to educated French audiences  with Confucius Sinarum philosophus (Confucius, the philosopher of the  Chinese, 1687). As a result, the European republic of letters swelled with  debates about Chinese religion and moral philosophy, in addition to debates  over the apparently well-ordered nature of Chinese politics. Chinese society  appeared to mimic the ideal of Enlightened Absolutism that scholars (Jesuits  and early philosophes alike) admired, and many Jesuits anchored the seeming  exceptionalism of Chinese morality and government in the unprecedented  length of time during which Jesuits believed that Chinese scholar gentry had  maintained the purity of the so-called patriarchal revelation before its degen- eration. Ricci’s assertion that the Chinese had worshiped the Christian God,  that Confucianism was therefore theistic and akin to Jesus’s moral teachings,  and that Confucianism had been corrupted only lately by Tang–Song material- ists (618–1279) all proved foundational to this argument.41 40 Jean-Martin de Prades claimed inspiration from Huet during his years of association with  the Lazarist Seminary of Bons-Enfants in Paris: see Jean-Martin de Prades, Apologie de  Monsieur l’abbé de Prades, 2 vols.

The circle included Marc-Michel Rey (1720–80), Picart’s son-in-law and one of the  most prosperous of later Enlightenment publishers. This group of publishers  and scholars was also close to those who would publish the Traité des trois  imposteurs (Treatise of the three imposters, 1719, 1721) designed to problema- tize the credibility of Jesus, Moses, and Muhammad altogether. But less well  known is the fact that both Bernard and Picart were interested in Jesuit mis- sionary texts concerning China, most likely through their fellow Chevalier de  jubilation, Prosper Marchand (1678–1756), who had once been a regular col- laborator with the Sinophile Jesuit, Tournemine, on the Mémoires de Trévoux  scarcely a decade before Marchand’s conversion to Protestantism and result- ing flight into the Low Countries.45 Bernard and Picart thus reproduced an  abridgment of the debates over the nature of Chinese religion based largely in  Jesuit writings, but their compendium left the heart of the matter dangling  without resolution.46 The answer implied by Cérémonies et coutumes reli- gieuses de tous les peuples du monde seemed to be, in the words of Wijnand  Mijnhardt, that “religious customs and ceremonies had kept the people in  Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas from seeing the universal truths for  44 Wijnand Mijnhardt, “Jean Frédéric Bernard as Author and Publisher,” in Bernard Picart  and the First Global Vision of Religion, ed.

Though the use to which freethinking Enlightenment authors often put  Jesuit works was for the most part quite at variance from the original purpose  of the Jesuit missionary-scholars themselves, it is important to note that by the  eighteenth century, controversies over whether the prisca theologia (pristine  theology) was theistic or materialistic divided even Jesuits against themselves.  As Marie-Hélène Cotoni has argued, religious writers engaged in many of the  same debates as more radical or secular writers. Citations and outright borrow- ing from all of these diverse sources find themselves entangled within the  same clandestine writings that circulated in academies, masonic lodges, lend- ing libraries, salons, and political clubs throughout the eighteenth century.48  Indeed, the historical research of some Jesuits themselves reached troubling  conclusions that could be taken by readers to imply that a kind of materialist  atheism may have been just as common as theism in distant antiquity. Nicolò  Longobardi (1559–1654), Ricci’s successor as leader of the Chinese mission, had  already complicated Ricci’s original assumption that the Chinese, like all other  peoples on earth, were originally monotheistic. Longobardi had discovered  that the most ancient Chinese classics possessed no clear idea of immaterial  deity, a finding which necessarily implied that the natural religion of humanity  might just as easily have been rooted in materialism or atheism. In effect,  Longobardi’s position is not far from the one espoused by the young Marquis  d’Argens (1704–71), who believed that primitive Confucianism had affinities  with Spinoza or other materialists.49 Even Jesuit classical philology closer to  47 Mijnhardt, “Jean Frédéric Bernard as Author and Publisher,” 18. 48 Marie-Hélène Cotoni, L’exégèse du Nouveau Testament dans la philosophie française du  dix-huitième siècle (Oxford: Voltaire Foundation, 1984), 124–26, 196; Olivier Bloch, ed., La  matérialisme du xviiie siècle et la littérature clandestine: Actes de la table ronde des 6–7  juin 1980 (Paris: Librairie Philosophique J.

Father Alexandre Pierre-Joseph Thoulier d’Olivet (1682–1768), a regular  correspondent with Voltaire even after the two began to disagree over the  potentially materialist implications of Newton (1643–1727) and Locke, com- pleted a new critical translation of De natura deorum (On the nature of the  gods) by Cicero (107–44 bce).50 De natura deorum was highly recommended  by Jesuits such as d’Olivet’s colleague, Tournemine, for use in Jesuit colleges  and schools, yet the critical remarks of d’Olivet’s translation implied that the  vast majority of Greek philosophers had actually possessed materialist con- ceptions of the cosmos, and were therefore (as most Catholics then under- stood it) atheistic.51 As Kors has noted, this tendency to find atheists lurking  behind every tree and under seemingly every rock—among the sages of  ancient Greece and Rome as well as those of China—not only globalized the  European understanding of the history of religion but may have accomplished  as much as Bayle’s notion that a morally upright society of atheists was possi- ble in undermining the Catholic doctrine of universal consent that Jesuits,  themselves, cherished.52 Though it cannot be said that Jesuits intended this  outcome, it seems hard to dispute that important individual examples of  seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Jesuit erudition ironically contributed to  the undermining of one of medieval and early modern Catholicism’s most  cherished notions—that all peoples originally possessed the same natural the- ology that declared the glory of one, anthropomorphic, immaterial deity.53  Kors may be prescient on this score given that Mémoires de Trévoux scarcely  criticized d’Olivet’s translation, and it later circulated in French translation  after 1721. Indeed, De natura deorum was constantly cited throughout the eigh- teenth century by popular radical authors including Benoît de Maîllet (1656– 1738) in Telliamed which argues for the plurality of other worlds beyond earth,  50 Father Thoulier was the prefect of Voltaire’s residence while the latter was a student at  Louis-le-Grand from 1704 to 1711; René Pomeau, “Voltaire au Collège,” Revue d’histoire lit- téraire de la France 52 (1952): 1–10; Voltaire’s acquaintance with Tournemine during the  latter’s tenure as librarian of the maison profess associated with Louis-le-Grand dates to  the same time: John Pappas, “L’influence de René-Joseph Tournemine sur Voltaire,”  Annales de Bretagne et des pays de l’ouest (Anjou, Maine, Touraine) 83, no. 4 (1976): 727–35;  also René Pomeau, La religion de Voltaire (Paris: Nizet, 1969), 42. 51 Kors, Atheism in France, 1:210–17; [Tournemine], “Instructions des Regens par le Père  Tournemine,” “Mélanges sur les jésuites, xviiie siècle”: BnF, Nouvelles acquisitions fran- çaises 10946, 318. 52 Perez Zagorin, How the Idea of Religious Toleration Came to the West (Princeton, nj:  Princeton University Press, 2003), 271–72. 53 Kors, Atheism in France, 1:296. &lt;UN&gt; </page> <page sequence="20"> Distinctive Contours of Jesuit Enlightenment in France 231 the possibility that earlier species of humans may have once populated earth,  and that the climate and geology of the earth are self-evolving.54 In light of the frequency with which eighteenth-century writers uncovered  examples of materialism in the traditions of ancient non-European societies  like China as much as in the more familiar antiquities of the Greeks and  Romans, some scriptores felt themselves impelled to devise creative ways of  adapting their apologetics accordingly. In a series of reflections on atheism  posthumously published in a 1776 revised edition of François Fenelon’s (1651– 1751) philosophical works, Tournemine went so far as to argue that “there are  no true atheists,” not even among followers of Spinoza. All atheism is merely  the willful attachment to metaphysical confusions that obscure the natural  sentiment of humanity that God must exist.55 Even the Chinese scholar  gentry—whom Bayle (1647–1706), Malebranche (1638–1715), d’Argens (1704–71),  and the Jesuit Longobardi himself considered to be atheistic—Tournemine  reframed as closet theists who possessed erroneous ideas about divinity and  nothing more.56 He continued with grace and beauty to describe the pious  metaphysics of the Chinese literati, some of whom were undoubtedly known  to Tournemine’s pupils and colleagues in the mission field: “One could not  speak of the Divinity in terms more magnificent than those employed by the  literati of China [...].

Atheism, in Tournemine’s estimation, is nothing more than  skepticism masquerading as bad philosophy with a dash of hubris. In fact,  Tournemine’s argument actually borrows its thesis—that “surely to forget God  is not atheism”58—from Bayle, with whom he regularly grappled and, in lim- ited ways, admired.59 Bayle’s work had underscored the observation that some  knowledge of God, however obscure, remains a precondition of idolatry  (which he had defined as corrupted theism).60 The Jesuit notion that efficacious grace had been withdrawn at the fall thus  leaving the human soul gradually unable to discern and practice the primitive  revelation of God once natural sentiments and perceptions were warped by  fear and passions, had led some Jesuits to very distinctive conclusions. For if  Spinozan or modern Confucian atheism were really just species of modern  idolatry presupposing the complexity and refinement of civilizations in Europe  or China, then might not the moral and religious values of supposedly primi- tive peoples be much closer to that unsullied natural theology practiced by all  humankind in its infancy? Certainly, some Jesuits flirted with this possibility  throughout the eighteenth century, a fact exemplified by the former director of  the Chinese missions, and one-time editor of Lettres édifiantes et curieuses,  Charles Le Gobien (1653–1708). Le Gobien recounts an address given by a leader of the failed 1685 revolt  against the Spanish by the indigenous peoples of Guam. No doubt Le Gobien  shapes the narrative according to the narrative conventions of the classical  harangue, but how much more then is this evidence of the globalization of  Jesuit horizons and their ability to provincialize their own European milieu?  Le Gobien’s report of the Guam freedom fighter reads as follows: We had what our Islands gave us; we relied on that, we did not want any- thing else. The knowledge they gave us made our needs bigger, our desires  57 “Réflexions du Père Tournemine,” in Fenelon, Oeuvres philosophiques, 381–82, also  393–94. 58 Ibid., 380. 59 Matytsin notes Tournemine’s relatively “warm appraisal” of Bayle, but this does contrast  with some of his more assertive critics among the French Jesuits, such as, for example, that  of Jacques Le Febvre in Bayle en petit (1737): Matytsin, “Specter of Skepticism,” 5–55, 119. 60 Thomas M.

[...] They think we are simpletons; they look on us as Barbarians.  But should we believe them? Is it not clear enough that, by pretending to  teach us and polish our customs, they are corrupting us? That they spoil  that first simplicity in which we used to live? That they take away our  freedom that we should cherish more than life? [...] They regard our his- tories as fables and fictions. Are we not entitled to say the same about  what they teach us, asking us to believe it as incontestable truth?61 Le Gobien’s text (which elsewhere cites Montaigne’s Essays and went on to  inspire Diderot’s Supplément au voyage de Bougainville) rhetorically drama- tized the possibility that, in reclaiming societies for Christ, a relative age of  primitive socio-political innocence may also have been lost, and values such as  civilization and barbarism are perhaps relative.62 If, as this chapter has shown,  Jesuit contributions to the eighteenth century exist in recursive and mutually  constructive dialogue with the more mainstream Enlightenment, while  remaining largely separate from the Enlightenment as such, then it must also  be said that at least a minority of Jesuits were occasionally willing and able to  express views largely identical to more radical thinking concerning the nature  of the soul, atheism, the history of religion, and the virtues of primitive  societies.  Conclusion The greatest paradox of Jesuit distinctiveness during the century of the  Enlightenment is the fact that they were so often victims of their own prowess  as philosophers and sacred historians. In the tremendously popular Nouvelles  ecclésiastiques, a story circulated about how Father Tournemine had delivered  a sermon at Caen in 1730 in which he was rumored to have exclaimed that the  only way to attain rational certainty concerning St. Matthew’s authorship of  the canonical Gospel that bears his name would be to verify the original  Hebrew orthography (a historical impossibility). His point seems to have been  that the authority vested in these gospels by Rome was their main source and  61 Charles Le Gobien, Histoire des Isles Marianes, nouvellement converties à la religion chres- tienne; et de la mort glorieuse des premiers missionnaires qui y ont prêché la foy (Paris, 1700);  quoted in Carlo Ginzburg, “Alien Voices: The Dialogic Element in Early Modern Jesuit  Historiography,” in History, Rhetoric, and Proof, ed.

Father Hardouin also got carried away with textual  criticism in his anti-Protestant apologetics, arguing that many texts of the  church fathers of late antiquity had been altered or outright forged in the thir- teenth century.63 Within the context of eighteenth-century Jesuit apologetics,  both Tournemine and Hardouin were merely attempting to remind readers  that the authenticity of scriptures had been vouchsafed by eye-witnesses who  then wrote the early texts of the church, which in turn, had been vouchsafed  and interpreted by that church as a living monument bereft of sound refutation  throughout the centuries in a way that guaranteed an unbroken chain of his- torical transmission. Taken in another way, however (as increasingly it was by  free thinkers, skeptics, and for other reasons, anti-Jesuit polemicists among the  Jansenists), the rhetorical skepticism that had served the apologetical pursuits  of the Jesuits so well also suggested that they were conceding far too much to  skeptics and heretics by appealing directly to the authority of the church for  whatever could not be affirmed by individual critical reason and scholarly  investigations. If the eighteenth-century Enlightenment is an intellectual revo- lution of sorts, and if revolutionaries often cannibalize their own forebears,  then I would like to suggest that the rise of anti-Jesuit criticism culminating in  the suppression of the order was at least in some measure the vengeance of  more radical writers of the eighteenth century on their own former teachers  despite the best apologetically inclined intentions of the latter.64 63 John McManners, Church and Society in Eighteenth-Century France (Oxford: Clarendon  Press, 1998), 2:542; it must be noted that Jean Hardouin was far too radical for many of his  fellow Jesuits, and was himself heavily criticized by them; even Tournemine was his bitter  polemical foe: see Michel Pierre Joseph Picot, Mémoires pour servir à l’histoire ecclésias- tique pendant le dix-huitième siècle, 3rd ed.
