By "prophetic realism," a term used "approximately in the sense" of Tillich's "kerygmatic theology," is intended "revelational theology, God's theology so to speak, wheresoever, by whomsoever, and in whatsoever cultural milieu it may be found ... its content is determined by the Spirit. Man may not impose upon it any of his cherished limiting categories, such as those of time and space, of race or class, or even of creed in the historic sense of that word." And the word "Gospel" is placed in the title of the volume "to voice the con- viction that the term ť Gospel* as employed in Scripture stands for the entire content of the prophetic revelation." So Dr. Bowman, since 1944 Professor of NT interpretation at the San Francisco Theological Seminary, informs us in the introduction to his latest work. Perhaps the sense of the title and the significance of the first of the three parts into which the book is divided become clearer if "prophetic realism" is considered a viewpoint and a method opposed to the viewpoints and methods of what the author terms "humanistic optimism" and "apocalyptic pessimism," with both of which as a conversation or "dialectic" Dr. Bowman contrasts it. While in the approach of "humanistic optimism" with its conviction that human reason is an adequate instrument for the attainment of all the religious truth man is destined to possess, the discussion or conversation ultimately becomes a "monologue of reason" in which God does not speak, and in the approach of "apocalyptic pessimism" the conversation is held with God "at long range" (the "God is in heaven and you upon earth" and the "wholly otherness" of the Kierkegaard-Barthian trend), in the approach of "prophetic realism" there is as a distinguishing feature the claim that a dialogue does take place between God and man, and one of so intimate a nature that man within history really comes to know God and to purpose to do his will. This approach insists that though mankind as a whole has lost the "secret of dis- tinct and constant communion with God," still to the prophets of the OT and NT God has continued to speak on terms of the greatest intimacy. So the proponents of this view insist first that God speaks to man for his well-being and that man may thus learn God's will for him (the thesis of "prophetic realism") ; secondly that man i.e., men of prophetic stature raised up by God, does hear God speaking to him (the antithesis of "prophetic realism") ; thirdly that man acts resolutely to carry out God's will when he has heard it (the synthesis of "prophetic realism"). It is in this first part of the book then that B. takes his stand against the naturalism, the relativism and the evolutionary optimism of Ritschl, Harnack, Wilhelm Hermann, Troeltsch and others, as well as against the reaction to that movement in the gloomy and forbidding apocalypticism of much recent con- tinental theology and American neo-orthodoxy. And it is with this part that readers of Catholic background will find themselves most in sympathy.</page><page sequence="2">186 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol. 18 Given the view that God can speak and has spoken effectively to man, one naturally asks the nature of the message. In the last two parts of the book the author turns to this problem in treating the theme and the content of Scrip- ture's prophetic realism; the difference between the two seems to be much the same as that between a general outline of the message and its more detailed teachings. It is presumably a sign of the times that the author in the second part of his work has to insist so strongly that the theme of the Gospel running through both Testaments is the "good news of Goďs redemptive activity on behalf of man." The author takes issue in this section with the "crisis theologies." They are "in grave danger of missing the right perspective if in their overweening desire to stress the judgment of God they forget the twofold aspect of that judgment - its saving as well as its condemning side." B. maintains that the "recurring theme of privilege and matching responsibility is sounded by these prophets within the purview of the universal redemptive purpose of God and of this they never lose sight." Perhaps in this section some may question whether the author has not gone too far in denying that God is present in the activity within the very "stage of creation" (the material universe except for and below man and history), no matter how justified he is in asserting the primacy of God-in-history, of God in man's purposeful activity through which he works out his will revealed to the prophets. And the objection that a theory of God immanent in nature makes him "a part of it - a dens ex machina, mixed up in the cogs of his own making," suggests a somewhat oversimplified theodicy. The third part, in which from the viewpoint of "prophetic realism" the writer treats in greater detail the Gospel message - its teachings on the incar- nation, atonement and resurrection of Christ, the Kingdom of God and its establishment, sin and justification - is from the viewpoint of Catholic the- ology the least satisfactory. The expressions in which B. speaks of the in- carnation and especially of the knowledge which the Incarnate Word has of himself and his mission raise as many questions as they answer, though one must in passing bear honest witness to the forthrightness with which he cen- sures every attempt to separate the "Jesus of history" from the "Christ of faith," even when those who make the distinction wish to accept the latter and not the former. If there is some vagueness in his views on the ontological structure of the Incarnate Word, there is none on the subject of the atonement. Every theory that postulates a God offended, a God angered and hence a God to be appeased is summarily dismissed, for the thought that "God requires to be propitiated or appeased is a pagan idea quite foreign to the prophetic Scriptures. Expia- tion consists rather in these Scriptures in the removal of that stumbling block between God and man which has destroyed their mutual fellowship. This stumbling block has always been man's rebellion against God's will. Its re- moval accordingly is accomplished by displacing man's rebellion with obedi-</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 187 enee through the persuasive work of Christ. . . . The history of Christian theology is not lacking, it is true, in theories of atonement that have held that Christ on the cross was endeavoring to appease his Father's wrath. In such theories stress has been laid on the passages in Paul which speak of the be- liever's being 'bought with a price.' But in the light of the teaching at which we have been looking such language can have but one meaning, viz., that the atonement has cost God much . It has cost him the very best he had to give, his unique Son." Even were it granted that without confident recourse to another font of revelation which completes and by completing tends to clarify the sense of redemption, atonement, appeasement, propitiation, expiation, one might hesitate before the analogies through which in Scripture the delicate relationships between God and sinful man are necessarily expressed, still one cannot easily brush aside or conjure away the recurring use of lutr on, lutroõ, lutrõsis, apolu - trõsis, agorazõ, 'ilastērion, 'ilaskomai. How misleading the suggested compari- son of 1 Pt 1, 18-19 then becomes if the "blood of the Lamb" by which we are redeemed was never weighed in any scales of divine justice, as "gold and silver" are constantly weighed in the scales of human exchange. And insofar as this purely "subjective redemption" appears to flow from the contention that an angered God is a pagan conception, one cannot but remark that whatever the inevitable anthropomorphism in our manner of ex- pressing it and however much we must avoid the irrationality and cruelty of pagan concepts of divine anger, a concordance will reveal that a major expur- gation of Scripture will have to be undertaken if we are to remove all notion of divine anger and hence of the need for appeasement. Nor need it be con- cluded, as the author appears to suggest, that an offended God could not or would not inaugurate the work of salvation and redemption. Certainly many Christian theologians find no contradiction in the concept of a God, affronted and offended by the deliberate rebellion of his rational creatures, preparing in his infinite goodness and wisdom the means by which in the person of the God-man those same creatures may make an amend that is commen- surate with the offense. Sin in arming the divine justice has not blinded divine goodness nor shackled omnipotence, and God may see that ultimately "it enhances human dignity that as man had been conquered by the devil it should be man who conquered the devil, and as man had merited death, so man by dying should overcome death" ( S.T. , III, 46. 3). And if as Dr. Bowman himself tells us "Jesus Christ is the norm of what God the Father must be," surely it is not hard to conceive an angry God when one recalls the scene of the cleansing of the temple ( Jn 2,13 ff) and the blis- tering condemnation of Mt 23. There are times when sin is something more than the foolishness of infants to sadden the heart of a father. These reservations are not intended to obscure the merits of a work which helps the reader immensely to penetrate and to assess correctly much of mod- ern theological speculation and biblical interpretation, and which manages with-</page><page sequence="4">188 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol. 18 out sacrificing scholarly qualities to free the movement of the text from the encumbrance of apparatus and the encroachment of footnotes.
