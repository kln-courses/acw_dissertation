<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTICES OF BOOKS seemed to me to be sub-standard. A few montages of fragments with joins in other collections are added, and one suspects that other joins will be found. The text is largely catalogue, with a modicum of commentary. The bulk of this first volume devoted to the Castellani 'residue' consists of cups, with a few other drinking vessels; the particular types of two of the three skyphos fragments are not noted. As one might have expected from the previously known distribution of material in Etruria, Sianas are rare, lip-, band- and all later cups common. Unfortunately no profiles are included, though occasionally there is recourse to stressing particular features of shape in the text. The ordering of the material seems to follow no clear pattern (chronology, decorative type etc.) other than basic typology. A set of joining sherds is regularly described as one fragment. Dates are often generous, e.g. c.550-525 for the eye- band-cup 211, and 'second half sixth century' for 339, which seems clearly pre-525; on the other hand '530-30 BC' is rather ungenerous for the Chalcidizing cup 243. Descriptions seem to be incomplete, whether with respect to all preserved details or the (unusual) direction in which figures face, on 1, 56, 93, 112, 290 and 320. While iconography is rarely unparalleled, there are a few pieces of interest, e.g. the winged females on the late band-cup 211, flanking a seated male; if he is Zeus and they Eilythuiai, then their wings are highly unusual. Or two odd Athenas on late type-B cups, running and looking back in the tondo of 269, and turning away from Herakles and the lion on 308. Inscriptions do not fare too well. It is always difficult to render nonsense inscriptions in typescript (7), but they are nonsense, not 'illegible' (52). The lip-cup fragments 24 and 25 could well be from one cup, with the same legend A and B, ]; rov&amp; (with presumably little lost before). The sigmas on 54, by Sondros, are clearly four- bar, though three-bar is printed, and on 104 the reading is ]XE; tnote, not ]KXo tnotsaev (possibly an imperfect to add to the many perfects previously known on Xenokles' cups). On 102 I read ]eX3[ rather than ]e?e[. The graffiti on 195 and 309 may or may not be accu- rately rendered in print. The normal Tleson hand is seen on 60, as well as Hermogenes' odd rho on 69 (together with a further spelling error to be added presumably to ABV 166,2). There are a few trivial errors. The 'pike' on the helmet of the warrior on 297 is presumably a spike, though the object is a feather when enough detail is given elsewhere. Lion, not panther, on 291. Vatican 343, not E14, is the comparandum for 239. Eisman is proper- ly cited for the kyathoi, though italicizing his name is perhaps de trop. And the drilled hole on 246 is hard to detect. Work of good quality is not lacking, by Lydos and the Amasis Painter among others, but overall the lasting impression is one of large quantities of humdrum figured pots being sent to Etruria in the period c.570-470. It will be interesting to see whether further volumes of the series confirm that impression; it will not cost too much to find out. ALAN JOHNSTON University College London CORINTH American School excavations, xviii, i. The sanctuary of Demeter and Kore: the Greek pottery. By E. G. Pemberton. Princeton: American School of Classical Studies at Athens, 1989. Pp. xix + 234, [70] plates, [29] text figs., 2 plans. Price not stated. This is the first of the volumes publishing material from the sanctuary of Demeter and Kore on the slopes of Acrocorinth. It has been followed by K. W. Slane's volume on the Roman pottery, both unacceptably delayed by the publishers, who must now take more seriously their duties both to the authors and readers of the volumes in the other series under their aegis. The sanctuary of Demeter and Kore has produced Mycenaean and Geometric pottery, but the site is first attested as a sanctuary in the seventh century. It expanded greatly in the following century and activity continued, albeit with a lessening in the Hellenistic period, until the sack of Corinth by Mummius in 146 BC. It is with the pottery of this period that Pemberton is concerned, that of the period following the revival of activity after Caesar's refoundation of Corinth in 44 BC being dealt with in the following volume. The book is essentially a combination of catalogue and shape studies with a context list and observations on various points of style. It is thorough and detailed, with welcome comments on ceramic use and the cult function of different vessels. More emphasis might usefully have been given to comparison with other sanctuaries. The shape studies are particularly valuable since much of the material dates to after c.550, a period which has been much less thoroughly studied than the preceding one. The most frequently found shape is the kalathiskos, classified in detail and fairly closely dated here for the first time. Its popularity may well be due to its common association with women, appropriate in a sanctuary of two goddesses. So too, the high number of pyxides (p. 57). In contrast, the almost complete lack of aryballoi is rightly noted (p. 53) as a point of difference from nearby sanctuaries. P. speculates on the intriguing possibility that the aryballos was considered an inappro- priate dedication to Demeter and Kore but, frustratingly, offers no suggestion as to why this should be so. While most of the shapes discussed are arguably functional, the miniatures and kalathiskoi are not, and as such are important indicators of definite votive activity, and must be seen in this light. The presence of thou- sands of kalathiskoi and other miniatures indicates the frequency with which small-scale dedications were made during the later Archaic and Classical periods. Although parallels are drawn with other sites, miniatures as a category remain hard to date and consequently of limited chronological interest, despite their quantity here. The standard range of sanctuary ware is well repre- sented, also the kotylai and kraters, and the common sanctuary activities of feasting and drinking are thus well attested. Along with these go the coarsewares, cookwares and amphoras, whose dating is often vague but is much enhanced by the strength of datable fine- wares. A final category of note is the clay perirrhanteria, a popular form of cult vessel in the Corinthia, of which fourteen are selected and catalogued. Although no number of different perirrhanteria is given, this appears to be a sizeable collection, as is that at the nearby 216</page><page sequence="2">NOTICES OF BOOKS sanctuary of Poseidon at Isthmia. Although plastic vases and heads attached to vases are briefly discussed, the lamps and terracottas are only mentioned in passing, so that the full extent of coroplastic dedications is not clear. The catalogue is divided into two sections, 'context groups' and 'fabric and decoration'. In the former, individual deposits are discussed, and in the latter, individual vases and questions of art-history and attribu- tion. Particularly welcome is the discussion of the Corinthian outline style (pp. 192-234), as a non-export style, and as a corrective to the view standardly expressed in handbooks that Corinthian figured wares end c.550. The book is liberally illustrated with both photographs and profile drawings, with some figure drawings. The small size of the photographs is of little consequence for much of the pottery, where repetitive and simply decorated types are illustrated perfectly adequately (e.g. the kalathiskoi on pls. 8-9). They are supported by a representative selection of profile drawings. The vases of art-historical interest, primarily the Archaic figured pottery, are much less well served by the photographs, and a more generous format would have been an improvement, particularly since there are few figure drawings, and those of a rather messy style. These criticisms are rather of the format of the series than of the present volume, which is both clear and useful. K.W. ARAFAT King's College London CARPENTER (T. H.) Art and myth in ancient Greece: a hand-book. (World of art.) London: Thames and Hudson, 1991. Pp. 256, [138] plates. ?6.95. Carpenter's Art and myth in ancient Greece is limited to a discussion of mythological illustrations created during the archaic and classical periods. Attic vases naturally hold the centre of the stage, but works in other media are also included. The abundant illustrations-a total of 356-are for the most part of very good quality, even including the black-figure vases, which are particu- larly difficult to reproduce. The text, presumably addressed primarily to beginners in the field, is commendable in pointing out that some stories found in images differ from those preserved in surviving literature, that certain elements (or even figures) in a picture are purely decorative and have no narrative significance and that the identification of a person or a story is not always simple and straightfor- ward. For instance, C. does well in explaining to the novice that an attribute does not always automatically identify a figure (e.g. torches may be held by Demeter, Persephone or Hecate). C. usually presents a brief summary of the story of a myth, followed by mention of how, when, where, in what media and how often it was represented. This somewhat dry enumeration tends to be informative rather than inspiring and C.'s treatment of myth is altogether more in the spirit of Apollodorus than that of Ovid. His method is, nevertheless, efficient in providing a great deal of essential information with laudable economy. Such information could be valuable to a wide range of readers and it is therefore unfortunate that C. sometimes appears to forget the needs of his intended audience. There is, for instance, much mention (without explanation) of the shapes of vases and names of painters, neither of which is necessarily familiar to the 'classicist in the street'-much less to a Renaissance historian or to the general public, who will also find the failure to add 'BC' to dates before Christ a distinct stumbling block to ready understanding. In such a wide-ranging work there are bound to be errors and oversights: red-figure vases are twice dated to the first half of the 6th century (pp. 205 and 207); a line of text has dropped out of the first paragraph on p. 195 robbing it of sense; Apollo, not Artemis (as stated in the caption), backs up Hektor in fig. 305; and the caption for fig. 240 has been omitted entirely; but such flaws are of minor importance. More disturbing are the occasions when clarity has been sacrificed to the rule of an arbitrarily imposed-sometimes ill-judged-principle of consistency. For instance, C.'s discussion of the iconography of Zeus and Ganymede begins awkwardly with the Ovidian version, then works back to the 4th century BC image of eagle abducting boy, and finally concludes with the earliest pictorial convention, namely an anthropomorphic Zeus pursuing a youth. The justifi- cation for such an illogical mode of presentation is that the story is subsumed under the rubric 'metamorphoses of Zeus'. Another example of where consistency in small matters obscures clarity in greater ones occurs in C.'s chapter on 'Portraits of the Gods'. C. introduces the gods following the order in which they appear as guests attending the wedding of Peleus and Thetis (on the vases painted by Sophilos and Kleitias)-a device presumably intended as a refreshing change from the usual presenta- tion according to the Hesiodic genealogy or the schema of a hierarchic family. The device is unsuccessful, however, because so many mythological nobodies are among the first to arrive, while so important a goddess as Athena virtually brings up the rear. This book will no doubt be used by many people in many fields, and it is, therefore, particularly disappoint- ing that it does so little to convey either the charm and power of the myths or the imagination and subtlety of the artists who illustrated them.

These two books share a single starting point, the relationship of art to contemporary political develop- ments, the underlying belief being that art reflects society and should be seen in conjunction with other manifestations of society. This reviewer wholeheartedly agrees, although it is hardly a new approach as Francis claims, and his final chapter shows how established such an approach is (the generality of the unnamed opposition [p. 6] is frustrating). 217</page></plain_text>
