<plain_text><page sequence="1">Barry Cohen and James Humber Sterling Lamprecht's Critique of Causality There have been numerous first-rate philosophers, past and present, who have rejected the traditional empiricist notion that we are only directly aware of sense-data but who nevertheless themselves claim to be empirical in outlook. Thomas Reid is an important example, both in his own right and because of his influence in American philosophy. Most academic philosophers in America during the first half of the nineteenth century were followers of Reid. Later the New Realists and Critical Realists picked up different strands of Reid's work and these strands have been reunited in the contemporary work of C. J. Ducasse and R. M. Chisholm. In almost all of these cases the allegiance to Reid's type of empiricism led to non-Humean views of causality. Two other empirical outlooks that, like Reid's, reject the sense-data base of acquaintance are those of Frederick Woodbridge and John Dewey; and these views together, in turn, influenced the work of Sterling Lamprecht and J. H. Randall, Jr. among others. Again we find a tendency toward non-Humean views of causality. It is Lamprecht's work, specifically his non-Humean view of causality, that we want to examine in detail in this paper because his work is historically important, bringing together as it does two strands in American philosophy, and also because it is proving influential in certain contemporary non-Humean views of causality. Our procedure will be as follows: in Section I we will present as concisely as possible Lamprecht's non-Humean view of causality, taking as our point of departure his concepts of particulars that are agents and patients; in Section II we will summarize the Humean arguments against the concepts of causal power and necessity and show that Lamprecht has effective replies to several points but fails to reply at all to Hume's in- principle argument; in Section III we will show in outline fashion how</page><page sequence="2">42 BARRY COHEN AND JAMES HUMBER Lamprecht's insights can be developed in such a way as to provide an answer to the in-principle argument; and in Section IV we will amplify, in the light of previous discussion, Lamprecht's claim that causal power can be directly perceived. I Lamprecht uses the concepts of "agent" and "patient" in giving his most detailed analysis of the causal relation. There is, he says, in any and all changes three factors that are always present: the agent, the patient, and the pattern of change. Change is not mere succession but it is also transformation, reconstruction, alteration: it is efficacious operation by something upon something. These "somethings" are individual things, or particulars, which he calls agents and patients depending on their role in any individual change.1 An agent is a specific entity that is displaying one or more of its powers by acting on a patient which is a specific entity that is displaying some one or more of its capacities to undergo some change. He believes all specific entities of nature have powers (i.e. a wind-blowing has the power to sway things) and capacities (i.e. water has the capacity to boil at 100°C). The prepositions, by and upon, are important. The preposition "by" points to the active agent. The preposition "upon" points to the receptive patient. Everything is both agent and patient all the time. For example, the power saw is the agent when it cuts the tree which in this case is the patient. But at the same time the resistance of the tree is having an effect on the saw, the teeth of the saw eventually become dull. The point is that agent and patient are not two different kinds of things, like males and females. A person who is a male is not a female but a thing that is an agent may also be, in fact always is, a patient. Likewise, a patient is also always an agent. A power saw is an agent when it is cutting the tree. It is not a patient when it is cutting the tree but it is a patient when its teeth are being dulled by the tree. Both these events (tree-cutting and teeth-dulling) are going on at once but in each happening we can distinguish the role of agent and the role of patient.2 In describing the causal relation between agent and patient, Lamprecht does not see it as the result of three distinct entities, things, events (actual processes of these things), and force (that which makes things into events). Force is neither a non-empirical entity inside of things nor a real agency behind events. Empirically we have forceful things</page><page sequence="3">Sterling Lamprechfs Critique of Causality 43 (agents and patients) . "Thinghood" (or the structure that an empirical existence has at any moment) and "eventness" (or its character as process through a temporal stretch) are entirely distinct concepts, but they do not stand for two separate particulars. It would, he says, be ". . . onto- logically wrong to suppose that particulars first exist merely in their thinghood and then somehow give rise to occurrences or events";3 like- wise it would, Lamprecht thinks, ". . . be ontologically wrong to suppose that eventness is a kind of materia prima which then crystallizes mysteriously and gives rise to things."4 Thing and event mean different aspects of empirical existence; they denote the same existences. There is no thing, he says, that is not an event, and there is no event that is not a thing. "What we empirically find," he claims, "... are happening- things or things-that-are-going-on."5 It is these changing things or changes-of -things that are causes and effects. The third factor mentioned in every change, the pattern of change, brings us to the concept of lawfulness. Lamprecht feels that scientists have emphasized and used exclusively this aspect of change in formulating their laws. "If a certain type of agent acts in a certain manner upon a certain type of patient when certain conditions prevail, then, ... a certain pattern of change will ensue and can be predicted with assurance."6 Lamprecht does not question the soundness of the contention that changes occur in the course of nature in accord with so-called laws which men can often discover and state with considerable accuracy. There is plenty of scientific evidence for this contention. Scientific knowledge is often generalized knowledge. Lamprecht contends, however, that science's interest in generalized knowledge makes the scientists deliberately over- look the particularities of the materials and of the tools of investigation, because the ". . . formula of regularity of sequence, and only that formula, is, for the time being, of major interest."7 This type of knowledge increases man's ability to control and utilize nature's powers. Lamprecht is in no way suggesting that man give up the pursuit for kowledge of this kind but he does want to point out that there are other types of things to know. For instance, the above type of knowledge is not the goal for natural- istic metaphysics. It is true, Lamprecht says, that the laws of nature can best be expressed in the form of the hypothetical proposition "If A, then B." The course of nature is full of "if's." These laws of nature are descriptions, Lamprecht contends, of a pattern that will occur if agents of a certain kind act, in a certain way, on patients of a certain</page><page sequence="4">44 BARRY COHEN AND JAMES HUMBER kind. They are not predictions, he insists, that agents will in fact act this way. They are not prescriptions. These laws enable us to say that the outcome of certain initiations of action is inevitable. (Unless, of course, some other agent interferes with the process in such a way as to modify, or annul or redirect it.)8 There is no doubt, Lamprecht says, that one can inquire into the kind of agent which is acting and into the kind of patient which is being acted upon. This is exactly what science does. However, the result is a loss for metaphysics because we are no longer dealing with an actual event ". . . that can be dated and placed after some other, simultaneous with others, and before still others."* We are rather, he claims, taking both agent and patient out of the existential world and putting them into the universe of discourse of scientific analysis. Metaphysics is the direct examination of "... a particular occasion in its full particularity."10 The more one generalizes, Lamprecht claims, the more one loses particu- larity. Both meticulous search into the rich particularity of a chosen event and careful effort to reach sound generalizations are important kinds of investigation for Lamprecht but they ought never to be confused with each other. Agents operate upon patients, and in the consequent process of change there are disclosed uniformities of vast practical and theoretical import. He stresses that these laws of nature are not agents at all. They are not causes and never bring events to pass. They are reports about agents each one of which is causal in nature. Lamprecht claims that 'causality' in his sense of agency, since it denotes an ultimate character of reality, is undefinable. That is, we cannot give a formal definition for it because, like space and time and color and sound, it is irreducible to anything more basic. It is a brute trait of existence. We can only get a denotative feeling for causality. Lamprecht holds that this inability to define causality satisfactorily is one of the reasons that causality though dealt with constantly in all other affairs of life is frequently denied or "explained away" in philo- sophic discourse.11 But, he contends that the indefinability of a term does not distress an empiricist in his sense. Empiricism does not mean that one must formally define every term we use. It is only when we can neither define our term nor point to the subject matter the term stands for that we are probably engaged in sheer nonsense. That is, though we cannot define causality we can analyze it. We can describe the term as a relation between agent and patient and give examples showing what we mean by causality,12 but we cannot formally define it.</page><page sequence="5">Sterling Lamprechfs Critique of Causality 45 Unlike the Humeans, Lamprecht feels that we can directly perceive causality and legitimately infer it in other cases. When a farmer sees the wind forcing the trees to sway or the unfortunate villager sees the moving hot lava burn and bury his cattle, the causality in nature is surely directly presented.15 Lamprecht claims not only that we can directly perceive causality but that we can legitimately infer it in other cases. We legiti- mately infer, he says, a causal connection between the points of light in the heavens and the spots in our photographic plate, or between the medicine we swallow and the health we recover.14 We know what we mean in inferring causality, even when our inference goes beyond the range of the immediately observed. He says we mean the same kind of compelling drive, though on quite a different scale, when we talk about atmospheric pressure pushing the water up a pump or when we say we directly see the waves eating away the shore. Lamprecht's concept of natural necessity is, in a sense, a conclusion of the previous considerations. He feels that he has avoided the Humean arguments against natural necessity and believes his own analysis of causality to be a solid basis for a non-Humean view. He agrees with the empiricists when they argue that logical necessity holds between or among propositions, not among things. British empiricism did a service in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries by ". . . pointing out that the relation between premise and conclusion in logic is not the same as that between antecedent and consequent in nature."15 Their argument was very relevant and effective against the rationalists of their time. Necessity, Lamprecht agrees, ". . . in the sense in which one may speak of a necessary conclusion from a set of premises, is not found anywhere in natural events."16 The deductive method relies on noting such necessity and therefore is not suited for revealing the course of existential things and events. There are many different logical systems of possible worlds that can be constructed by using logic but there is only one actual world. The system of nature, he says, cannot be known in the same way as these logically constructed worlds. "It must come to be known, if indeed, it is ever known, or insofar as it is known, by observation and experiment."17 Lamprecht admits that deductions may be useful in extending the range of accepted knowledge by enabling us to formulate hypotheses about further things still unknown, but it is only by checking these hypotheses empirically that we can assess their worth. Although Lamprecht agrees with the above analysis of logical necessity, he still feels there is another sense of necessity that is applicable to the</page><page sequence="6">46 BARRY COHEN AND JAMES HUMBER course of events. There is, in common parlance, he contends, another sense of necessity in which necessity is constantly found in nature. This sense of necessity follows from Lamprecht's analysis of causality. The falling tree (agent) crushes the blade of grass (patient). The grass cannot resist the tree's impact. The force of the falling tree makes the blades bend and lie prone. Although we cannot formally define it, we can directly perceive this compulsion according to Lamprecht. In addi- tion, there is compulsion of that kind throughout nature. This compulsion lies in the powers of the particular agents and the capacities of the particular patients. Scientific laws reflect what regularly happens when stimuli set off the powers of an agent, or active particulars. II In general, Hume uses three arguments in order to support the con- tention that it is impossible to arrive at a notion of causal necessity via experience: (a) Interpreting causal power or necessity to be some kind of "ontological tie that binds" C to E, he claims (quite correctly) that it is imperceivable. (The details of this argument are taken for granted as well known.) (b) Taking 'cause* as meaning 'total set of necessary conditions sufficient to E', he claims that causes cannot be known, for there would appear to be endless candidates for the role of necessary condition.18 (Needless to say, if we do not know the cause of a phenomenon we can hardly know what there is about that cause which necessitates its effect.) And finally, (c) even if we were aware of the whole set of necessary conditions, together with the power of the cause, this would not guarantee that E must always follow C, for "a change in the course of nature is always possible." For example, even if we knew: (1) that the striking of a match on a rough surface together with (2) the presence of a requisite amount of oxygen in the atmosphere, were jointly C of the match's lighting (E), we would not know that E must follow whenever C occurred. This must be so, for it is always logically possible that the course of nature will change, e.g., oxygen then having the power to snuff out rather than feed fire. Hence, it is im- possible in principle to know of the existence of causal necessity: even if the cause and its power could be denominated, the force of "necessity" linking C to E could disappear given a change in the course of nature. And a power that can disappear - a necessity which is contingent - is no real necessity.</page><page sequence="7">Sterling Lamprechfs Critique of Causality 47 The crucial question now arises, can Lamprecht' s theory withstand such a skeptical critique? Or, more modestly, does it have telling replies to any of the three Humean arguments? It seems that Lamprecht does have useful replies to arguments (a) and (b). (a) Hume is fundamentally mistaken in construing the concept of causal power as an ontalogical tie that binds events together. An onto- logical tic is certainly not a perceivable entity - Hume is clearly correct in making this claim. If causal power is taken as an undefined descriptive predicate referring to something behind or underlying the particulars of ordinary experience that make certain events happen, then clearly Hume's argument (a) demolishes it completely. But this sense of causal power is not at all what a descriptice metaphysician like Lamprecht has in mind when he talks about powerful particulars and agents. Causal powers are dimensions of physical particulars that can be observed and inferred just as empirically as various properties of these particulars. What an agent is able to do is no more mysterious than what it is, and, indeed, as we shall see, the two are intimately related: ultimately we explain what a particular is able to do by specifying the nature (determined at a given time by the relevant properties) of this particular. Lamprecht has an interesting response to (b) also. Hume assumes that 'cause' always means 'whole set of necessary conditions sufficient for E' without justifying his assumption. No doubt this is a perfectly intelligible sense of 'cause', and the word doubtless is used sometimes in this sense. But clearly there are other perfectly legitimate senses of 'cause', and Lamprecht is pointing out one such sense which is often the one intended in everyday discourse. In this sense 'cause' refers to a powerful particular in action - the atmosphere pressing down on the reservoir of water pushes the water up the pump, the rolling waves eat away the shoreline, and the swinging axe splits the log. This sense of 'cause' is also Locke's sense of the word, and given this sense Hume's argument (b) is simply irrelevant. There are still other senses of 'cause' that point up the irrelevancy of (b) again but also lead on to further rebuttals. We can say legitimately that pushing the air out of the shaft caused the water to rise in the pump, cutting the suspenders caused the pants to fall, and pulling the center beam caused the barn to collapse. Here we single out the change intro- duced into a set of conditions and call it the cause. Again, on this analysis of 'cause' Hume's argument (b) is irrelevant. Moreover we can combine these last two senses of 'cause' into a further one that tells</page><page sequence="8">48 BARRY COHEN AND JAMES HUMBER against (b) in a new way. The cause of the stick of dynamite exploding, we can say, is the detonation of the stick and dynamite having the (atomic) nature it does. This sense of 'cause' is a fusion of Lamprecht's sense and the releasing occasion sense. This concept of cause as powerful particular plus the occasion for the manifestation of its power corres- ponds, in a way, with Hume's concept of whole set of conditions sufficient for E. The powerful particular and the occasion for the manifestation of its power constitute the set of necessary conditions sufficient to E. But in this isomorphic rendition of Hume's claim the problem of the infinite number of candidates for the set of conditions sufficient to E is avoided. Whatever may be the causes, if any, of the nature of the particular and the releasing occasion, these together constitute in any specific case the C of E. Lamprecht really does not answer Hume's in-principle argument at all, a surprising fact indeed. He seems to think that because in his sense of 'cause' causes can be perceived that he has somehow avoided Hume's (c) as well as (a) and (b). But, of course, his sense of 'cause', like any sense of the term, is vulnerable to Hume's argument (c) . In fact, unless Lamprecht can rebut (c) his answer to (a) is not wholly satisfactory. In his in-principle argument Hume purports to show that it is impossible to perceive causal power since it is impossible to perceive causal necessity and the two concepts are synonymous. Unfortunately Lamprecht un- wittingly follows Hume in identifying 'causal power' and 'causal necessity' and so falls victim to the argument that causal power cannot be perceived. We believe that Lamprecht has provided concepts which if properly developed yield an interesting rebuttal to (c) and strengthen his answer to (a). In developing this line of thought we shall be depending upon the recent writings of Professors R. Harré and E. H. Madden,1* though, of course, we are not contending that they would necessarily analyze Lamprecht's work precisely as we do. We have, in fact, adumbrated several of their concepts in our efforts to elucidate Lamprecht's work in the present section. Ill In order to accomplish the goal of extending Lamprecht's line of thought and thus finding a telling reply to (c), we must elaborate on what can be meant by the "nature" of a particular (agent or patient) and</page><page sequence="9">Sterling Lamprechfs Critique of Causality 49 the relationship of this nature to the particular's powers and capacities. This endeavor is best served by examining the concept of a physical system. The exploding gasoline (agent), we would say, has the power to move the pistons (patient) , thus overcoming the drag of friction, and move the car, just as friction has the counter power to stop the car when the gasoline supply runs out and the pistons no longer move. The chemical structure, or nature, of gasoline, in turn, explains the explosive power of gasoline. Likewise we would say, correctly, that the atmosphere has the power to raise a balloon, raise water in a pump, raise the mercury column in a barometer, and crumple non-spherical containers; and here it would be the nature of the atmosphere - its having weight and exerting pressure - that would explain its power to bring about the results it does. The nature of the atmosphere itself, in turn, would be explained by gravitational attraction. "Power" tells the story of the agent while "capacities'1 tell the story of the patient. Together they tell the whole story about particulars. And the nature of a particular, along with conditions and occasions, helps explain the capacities as well as the powers of particulars. Water has the capacity to be pushed up a pump, waves have the capacity to sway in the wind, sugar the capacity to dissolve in water, etc., and the physical and chemical make-up of these substances help explain their capacities just as much as the nature of the atmosphere helps to explain its powers. The relationship between the nature of a particular and the powers and capacities this nature helps to explain is not a contingent one in the sense that particulars could lose all their powers and capacities, or special sets of them, and still be said to remain the same particulars. A liquid that had a gasoline smell but did not explode when ignited would not count as gasoline any more, since a host of interrelated concepts and explanations would break down. The claim that atmospheric pressure failed to raise water in a pump, given the appropriate conditions, but nevertheless that air has weight and the atmospheric blanket remains is simply self-inconsistent. To talk about the nature of a particular remain- ing the same even though P loses the powers and capacities this nature helps explain is to assert and deny at once that P has nature N. It is not impossible for P to act and react differently at ti and t0, but it is impossible* for it to do so incompatibly with its own nature and still remain the same particular. There is, in short, a natural necessity between what a thing is and what it is capable of doing and undergoing.</page><page sequence="10">50 BARRY COHEN AND JAMES HUMBER While there is a causal necessity between the nature of P and the powers and capacities of P, it is also true that there is nothing self- contradictory about the notion of a change in the nature of P. There are basically two different ways that P's nature might be altered. First, it might change in a way such that its identity is not questioned because this change takes place in a theoretical structure which explains it. Yeast may lose its effectiveness over a period of time, litmus paper will not retain its capacity to turn red in acid forever, and a person forgets many skills learned early in life; yet the yeast, litmus paper and person do not thereby lose their identities. They still count as continuous P's, since such changes in powers and capacities are explained, in part at least, by theoretical concepts which provide the invariant nature of x which con- tinues constant throughout the change. This theory, however, pre- supposes certain P's which do not themselves change since such changes could not be further explained. A change in these P's constitutes the second type of change which would be a fundamental change in nature. These unchanging P's constitute an explanatory frame of reference (S), and there is nothing self -contradictory about the notion of a change in their natures since no actual or possible S's entail the falsity of each other. Though there is a necessity corresponding to the nature of the actual, this necessity does not imply that the actual is itself necessary in the sense that its denial is self -contradictory. Though some things happen of necessity within S, it simply happens to be the case that S rather than some other logical alternative in fact constitutes the nature of our universe. The above analysis of causal necessity can be used to rebut the in- principle argument of the Humeans. The argument, it will be recalled, is this: "If there were a necessary connection between C • E, then the con- junction of C • r-^ E would be self -contradictory, but clearly this con- junction is perfectly consistent, since there is nothing self -contradictory about the concept of a change in the course of nature. Hence there is no necessary connection between C • E." However, it follows from the above analysis that the conjunction of C • . - E is self-inconsistent even though there is nothing self -contradictory about the concept of a change in the course of nature where this phrase means "a fundamental change in the nature of a particular." There is something self-inconsistent in the conjunction of C • ^ E unless one puts double quotes around C to in- dicate that while "C" • &lt;^ E is not self -contradictory the notion of x as C of E has been relinquished. If "C" • . - E occurred either "C" was</page><page sequence="11">Sterling Lamprechfs Critique of Causality 51 mistakenly identified or there was a change in the nature of x and it is no longer the particular that counts as C. It would be self -inconsistent to say that x has nature y which helps explain the occurrence of E, and hence is part of C of E, and yet x still has nature y when C occurs without E. This, in effect, says that x - y at once both does and does not explain E. The great error of the Humean is to think mistakenly that * "C" •^E is never self -contradictory' entails %C*r- &lt;E is never self- contradictory'. Or, putting the matter in a truer light, he never sees the ambiguity of the phrase "change in the course of nature" and so erroneously thinks that because it is possible for nature to change at all it is impossible for there to be necessary connections between matters of fact. In addition Hume's error seems due to his confusion about two senses of necessity. The "strong" sense of necessity is logical necessity, by which we intend an expression which holds true in all possible worlds. That x is either T or F must be the case no matter what universe of discourse gives factual meanings to V and T\ The weak sense of necessity is natural necessity, by which we intend a proposition about natural kinds which does not have to hold true in all possible worlds, but which, if it does hold true in the given universe, yields certain con- clusions. It is correct to say that factual propositions are never logically necessary but it does not follow from this that there are no necessary connections between matters of fact. That a change in the course of nature is always logically possible establishes only the first, quite obvious fact; it does not establish the second. The appearance that it does stems from the fact that "a change in the course of nature" is ambiguous as mentioned above and may mean either "O- - E is never self-con- tradictory" or * "C" • r^E is never self contradictory'. IV It is only after we have established that there is causal necessity in the world that the issue of whether it can be directly perceived or not can be decided. With the Humean objections out of the way, we can now reassert the belief that we do directly perceive causal power. We always felt in our everyday experience that this was true but Hume's criticisms raised legitimate doubts about the reality of that experience. The problem for us in this section is to give an accurate analysis or account of this "perception" of causal power. Do we see all causal power at work? If</page><page sequence="12">52 BARRY COHEN AND JAMES HUMBER not, what kind of causal power do we perceive? Where do we first perceive causal power? In ourselves or in the external world? If you answer "the former" to the last question you fall into the "inferential predicament." The inferential predicament arises by taking volitional contexts as the only ones in which causal power is directly perceived, and then projecting such experienced power onto objects and events in order to make sense of causal necessities in the physical world. This usually leads into pan-psychism and animism which is investing the physical world with all sorts of doubtful entities such as a world soul, absolute mind, spirits, etc. This is considered an absolute disaster by most contemporary philosophers. Peter Alexander and Peter Downing in their article "Are Causal Laws Purely General?"20 assume that we can start with human agency and still escape the charge of anthropomorphism. It seems perfectly possible to them that we may acquire a concept in situations involving human agency and at the same time see that it can be applied to situations not involving human agency. Not all the circumstances of the original learning situation need be part of the concept acquired; a paradigm, they say, need not give the meaning of an expression but may just exhibit one of the situations to which it is properly applied. In moving something himself, they claim, he could acquire the concept of making something move. They also point out that human agents are also patients. People are pushed and pulled by other people and inanimate objects. The fact that he is a person is irrelevant when a wave knocks him over. "I am no better than a pebble .... In seeing what I am doing I also see what inanimate objects can do. Generalization sets in, and with it the recog- nition that human agency is inessential."21 Alexander and Downing do not solve the predicamet but only assume that the predicament is not that bad and does not lead to anthropomor- phism. They apparently do not see that they are still making a leap from human agency to the relation of external things in the world. It seems to make perfectly good sense to them but the question still remains, How do they justify their so-called "generalization"? Certainly human agency may not be analyzable in the same way as the causal action of inanimate things. They may be right to say that people can acquire the concept of "making things move" from "my making something move"; but do we have the right to make that jump? Hume himself believed we acquire the concept of causal necessity from the working of the mind, yet his account does not establish the fact of causal necessity in the world.</page><page sequence="13">Sterling Lamprechfs Critique of Causality 53 It is obvious that the inferential predicament has difficulties we would like to avoid if we could. The fact is that there does not appear to be any legitimate reason to assume we are directly aware of causal power only in volitional situations. In fact, we can experience directly the causal powers in the external world. Lamprecht makes a good case for this point. . . . instead of going from the psychical facts of volition to the physical thrusts of things (so that belief in causality would be a kind of lingering animistic interpretation of the material world), we begin with the experience of causality in bodily thrusts and only later extend this notion to our mental life (and the degree to which such extension is legitimate is still to some philosophers an open question).22 His analysis also accounts for our belief and experience that some causal power in the world is directly perceived (i.e., an avalanche destroying a village) while other causal power (i.e., atmospheric pressure) is legitimately inferred. This real distinction in our experience becomes completely eliminated if we take as primary only human agency because then all statements about causal powers in the external world become inferences. This is certainly not consistent with the evidence of our experience. It seems legitimate once the Humean objections are removed to believe that we do directly perceive causal powers in the world. We perceive it in the work of particular agents acting upon particular patients. Youngstown State University Georgia State University NOTES 1.
