<plain_text><page sequence="1">II-EDUCATION AS A SCIENCE. (III.)* IN Education, there has to be encoulntered at every turn the play of Motives. Now the theory of Alotives is the theory of Sensation, Emotion and Will; in other words, it is the psycho- logy of the Sensitive and the Active Powers. THE SENSES. The pleasures, the pains and the privations of the Senses are the earliest and the most unfailing, if not also the strongest, of motives. Besides their bearings on self-preservation, they are a principal standing dish in life's feast. It is when the Senses are looked at on the side of feeling, or as pleasure and pain, that the defectiveness of the current classification into five is most evident. For, although, in the point of view of knowledge or intellect, the five senses are the really important approaches to the mind, yet,-in the view of feeling or pleasure and pain, the omission of the varied organic susceptibility leaves a wide gap in the handling of the subject. Some of our very strongest pleasures and pains grow out of the region of organic life-the Digestion, Circulation, Respiration, Muscular and Nervous integrity or derang,ement. In exerting influence over human beings this department of sensibility is a first resource. It can be counted on with more certainty than perhaps any other. Inideed, almost all the punish- ments of a purely physical kind fall within the domain of the organic sensations. What is it that makes punishment for- midable, but its threatening, the very vitals of the system ? It is the lower deegree of what, in a higher degree, takes away life. ness ; for on recovery the intoxicated person is said often to reinember h-aving imagined a vast number alnd variety of suecessive experiences. This distorted appreciation of the passage of time, owing to increased activity of cerebral action, may, I think, be instructively contrasted with the extra- ordinary accuracy of such appreciation which is displayed by somne idiots. Here we have exactly the opposite mental condition to that wlhich is pro- duced by Indlian hemp, &amp;c.; for amnong idiots of a low type there is not much variation in the degree of their nmental activity at different times, and as the streani- of their consciousness is thus always more or less on a dead level, an act of retrospectioni affords a more trustworthy measure of time than it does in the case of an inidividual whose intellectuLal life is of a miiore varied character. Dr. Langdon Down tells me that those of his patients who display the faculty of " guessing the tiimie " in a marked degree, are so little prone to consciotus miiental effort that in order to insure a correct ans wer they have to be first aroused to reflect by shaking. This fact shows Xn how dead a level their conscious life miiust be-thuLs allowing no oppor- tiunity for the occurrence of great variations in either of the factors of time- coiisciousness. And probably the same explaniationi applies to the accurate appreciation of time which is displayed by certain aniimials. * Continued from MIND, No. VI.</page><page sequence="2">-Education as a Science. 305 For example, the Aluscular System is the seat of a mass of sensibility, pleasurable and painful: the pleasures of lhealthy exercise, the pains of privation of exercise, and the pains of extreme fatigue. In early life, when all the muscles, as well as the senses, are fresh, the muscular organs are very largely ,connected both with enjoyment and witlh suffering. To accord full scope to the activity of the fresh organs is a gratificationi that may take the fornm of a rich reward; to refuse this scope is the infliction of mnisery; to compel exercise beyond the limits of the powers is still greater misery. Our penal discipline adopts the two forms of pain: in the milder treatment of the young, the irksonmeness of restraint; in the severe miethods with the full- grown, the torture of fatigue. Again the Nervous System is subject to organic depression; and certain of our pains are due to this cause. The well known state denorninated 'Tediuin' is niervous uneasiness; and is caused by undue exercise of any portion of the nervous system. In its extreme forms, it is intolerable wretchedness. It is the suffering caused by penal impositions or tasks, by confinement, and by monotony of all kinds. The acute sufferings of the nervous system, as growing out of natural causes, are represented by neuralgic pains. It is in graduated artificial inflictions operating directly on the nerves by means of electricity that we may look for the plhysical punlishments of the future, that are to displace floggings and muscular torture. The interests of Nourishment, as against privation of food, are necessarily bound up with a large volume of enjoymienit and suffering. Starvation, defic iency and inferiority of food, are con- nected with depression and imisery of the severest kind; in- spiring, the dread that most effectually stimiulates human beings to work, to beg, or to steal. The obverse conidition of a rich anid abundant diet is in itself an almost sufficient basis of enjoy- ment. The play of motives between those extremes enables us to put forth an extensive sway over human colnduct. An instructive distinietion may be mxade between Privation and Hunger; likewise between their opposites. Privation is the positive deficiency of nourishing material in the blood; Hunger is the craving of the stomach at its usual times of beinig supplied, and is a local sensibility, perliaps very acute, but not marked by the profounid wretchedness of inaniition. There may be plenty of material to go on with, although we are suffering from stoniachic hunger. Punishing, for onice, by the loss of a meal out of the three or four in the day is unimportant as regards the general vigour, yet very telling as a motive. Absolutely to diminish the available nutrimelnt of the systenm is a measure of great severity; to inflict a pending hunger is not the same tlling,.</page><page sequence="3">306 Education as a Science. When wve unite the acute pleasures of the palate with stomaclhic relislh aind the exhilarationi of abundance of food material in a healthy frame, we counit up a large mass of pleasurable sensibility. Between the lowest demalnds of sub- sistelnce, and the highliest lulxuries of affluent means, there is a great range, available as an instrumentality of control in the discipliDe of the young. The usual regimen being somiething colnsiderably above necessaries, and yet beneath the hiiglest pitchl of indulgence, room is given to operate both by reduction alnd by increase of luxury, withoiit either mischief or pam- pering; and the sensibility in early years being very keen in those heads, the motive power is great. HIaviing, in view the necessities of discipline with the young, the habitual regimen in food should be pitched neither too low, nor too high to per- mit of such variations. It is the misfortune of poverty that this means of influence is greatly wantinig; the next lower deptlh to the delinquent clhild is the application of the stick. These are the cliief departments of Organic Sensibility that contain the motives made use of in reward and punishment. The inflictiolns of caning, and flogging operate upon the org,an of the sense of touclh, yet, in reality, the effect is onie to be classed amonga the pains of organic life, rather than amiong tactile sen- sations ; it is a paini resulting from inijury or violence to the tissue in the first iinstance, and if carriecl far is destructive of life. Like all physical acute pains it is a powerful deterring influence, and is doubtless the favourite punishment of every age and every race of malnkind. The limitations to its use demiancd a rigorous lhandlingt; but the consideration of tllese is mixed up witlh motives afterwards to be adverted to. The ordiniary five Senses contain, in addition to their intel- lectual functions, many considerable sensibilities to pleasure and pain. The pleasures can be largely made tuse of as inicenltivTes to concluct. The pailns might of course be also employed in the same way; but with the exceptions already indicated they very rarely are. We do lnot punish by bad odours, nior by bitter tastes. Harsh and grating sounds may be very torturing, blut they are niot used in discipline. The pains of sight reach the hiohest acuiteness, but as punishment they are found onlly in the milost barbarous codes. Postponing a review of the principles of punishment generally, we approach the inost perplexing department of motives-the hilihher Emotiolns. Few of the simple sensational effects are obtained inl purity, tllat is, wvithout the ilnterminglilng of emotiolns. THE EMOTIONS. One large departmelnt of Psych,ology is made up of the classi-</page><page sequence="4">Education as a Science. 307 fication, definition, and analysis of the Emotions. The appli- cations of a complete theory of Emotion are numerous, and the systematic expansion must be such as to cope with all these applications. We here narrow the subject to what is indis- pensable for the play of motives in Education. First of all, it is necessary to take note of the large region of Sociability, comprising the social emotions and affections. Next is the department of Anti-social feeling-Anger, Malevolence, and Lust of Dominatiorn. Taking both the sources and the ramifica- tions of these two leading groups, we cover perhaps three fourths of all the sensibility that rises above the senses proper. They do not indeed exhaust the fouiitains of emotion, but they leave no others that can rank as of first-class importance, except through derivation from thenl and the Senses together. The region of Fine Art comprises a large compass of plea- surable feeling, with correspondillg susceptibilities to pain; some of this is sensation proper, being the pleasures of the two higher senses; some is due to associations with the interests of all the senses (Beauty of Utility) ; a certain portion may be called intellectual, the perception of unity in variety; whilst the still largest share appears to be derived from the two great sources above described. The Intellect generally is a source of various gratifications and also of sufferinigs that are necessarily mixed up with our intellectual education. Both the delights of attained knowledge, and the pains of intellectual lab6ur have to be carefully counted with by every instructor. The pleasures of Action or Activity are a class greatly pressed into the educational service, and therefore demand special con- sideration. The names Self-esteem, Pride, Vanity, Love of Praise, express powerful sentiments, whose analysis is attended with much subtlety. They are largely appealed to by everyone that has to exercise control over human beings. To gratify thein is to impart copious pleasure, to thwart or wound them is to iiiflict corresponding pain. Mention has rot yet been m-nade of one genus of emotion, formidable as a source of pain, and as a motive to activity, namely, Fear or Terror. Onlly in the shape of re-action or relief is it a source of pleasure. The skilful management of this sensibility has much to do with the efficient control of all sentient creatures, and still more with the savinig of gratuitous misery. Our rapid review of these various sources of emotion, together with others of a minor kinid, proposes to deal once for all, and in</page><page sequence="5">308 Education as a Science. the best inanner, with the various educational questions that turn upon the operation of motives. We shall have to remark upon prevailing exaggerations on some heads, and the insufficient stress laid on others; and shall endeavour to unfold in just propor- tions the entire compass of our emotional susceptibilities avail- able for the purposes of the teacher. Thbe Emotion of Terror. The state of mind named Terror or Fear is described shortly as a state of extreme misery and depression, prostrating the activity and causing exaggeration of ideas in whatever is related to it. It is an addition to pain pure and simple-the pain of a present infliction. It is roused by the foretaste or prospect of evil, especially if that is great in amount, and still more if it is of uncertain nature. As far as Education is concerned, terror is an incident of the infliction of punishment. We may work by the motive of evil without producing the state of terror, as when the evil is sligllt and well defined; a sinall understood privation, a moderate dose of irksomeniess, may be salutary and preventive, without any admixture of the quakings and misery of fear. A severe inflic- tion in prospect will induce fear; the more so that the subject does not know how severe it is to be. In the higher moral Education, the management of the passion of fear is of the greatest consequence. The evils of operating by means of it are so great that it should be reserved for the last resort. The waste of energy and the scattering of the thoughts are ruinous to the interests of -mental progress. The one certain result is to paralyse and arrest action, or else to concentrate force in some single point, at the cost of general debility. The tyrant, vorking by terror, disarms rebelliousness, but fails to procure energetic service, while engendering hatred and preparing for his overtblrow. The worst of all modes and instruments of diseipline is the employment of spiritual, ghostly; or superstitious terrors. Unless it were to scourge and thwart the greatest of criminals--the disturbers of the peace of mankind, hardly anything justifies the terrors of superstition. On a small scale, we know what it is to frighten children with ghosts; on a larger scale is the influence of religions dealing almost exclusively in the fear of another life. Like the otlher gross passions, Terror admits of being refined upon and toned down, till it becomes simaply a gentle stimula- tion; and the re-action more thani makes up for the misery. The greatest efiforts in this direction are found in the artistic handling of fear, as in the sympathefic fears of tragedy, aind in the</page><page sequence="6">Edication as a Science. 309 passing terrors of a well constructed plot. In the moral bearings of the emotions, its refined modes are shown in the fear of giving pain or offence to one that we love, respect, or venerate. There may be a considerable degree of the depressing element even in this situation ; yet the effect is altogether wholesome and ennoblina. All superiors should aspire to be feared in thij manner. Timidity, or susceptibility to fear, is one of the noted differ- ences of character; and this difference is to be taken into account in disciphne. The absence of general vigour, bodily and mental, is marked by timidity; and the state may also be the result of long bad usage, and of perverted views of the world. In the way of culture, or of high exertion in any form, little is to be expected froin tlhoroughly timid natures; they can be easily goverined, so far as concerns sins of commission, but their omissions are inot equally remediable. The conquest of superstitious fears is one of the grandest objects of education taken in its widest compass. It cannot be accomplished by any direct inculcation; it is one of the in- cidental and most beneficial results of the exact study of nature, in other words, science. The Social llotives. This is perhaps the most extensive and the least involved of all the emotional influences at work in Education. The pleasures of Love, Affection, Mutual Reg,ard, Sympathy, or Sociabilitv, make up the foremost satisfaction of human life; and as such are a standing object of desire, pursuit, and fruition. Sociability is a wholly distinct fact fromi the prime supports of existence and the pleasures of the five senses, and is not, in my opiniion, resolvable into tlhose, h-owever deeply we may analyse it, or however far back we may trace the historical evolution of the miind. Nevertheless, as the supports of life and the pure sense agreeables and exemptionis, come to us in great part through the medium of fellow-beings, the value of the social regards receives from this cause aln enormous augmentation, anld, in the total, counts for one paramouLnt object of h-uman solicitude. It would appear strange if this motive could ever be overlooked by the educator, or by any oine; yet there are theories and methods that treat it as of inferior accouLnt. The vast aggregate of social feeling is made up of the intenser elenients of sexuLal and parental love, and the select attachments in the way of friendship, together with the more diffuLsed senti- ments towards the miiasses of human beings. The motive power of the feelings in education may be well exemplified in the in- tense examples; we can see in these both the merits and defects</page><page sequence="7">310 Education as a Science. of the social stimulus. The Phamdrts of Plato is a remarkable ideal picture of the study of philosophy prompted by Eros, in the Grecian form of attachment. The ordinary love of the sexes, in our tiine, does not furnish many instances of the mutual strivinog after high culture; it miay be left out of account in the theory of early education. We frequently find mothers applying to studies that they feel no personal attraction for, in order to assist in the progress of their children. This is much better than nothing; a secondary end may be the initiation and discovery of a taste that at last is self-subsisting. The intense emotions, froin the very fact of their intensity, are unsuited to the promptings of severe culture. The hardest studious work, the laying of foundations, should be over, before the flame of sexual and parental passion is kindled; when this is at its height the intellectual power is in abeyance, or else diverted from its regular course. The mutual influence of two lovers is not educative for want of the proper conditions. No doubt considerable efforts are inspired; but there is seldom suffi- cient elevation of view on the one side, or sufficient adaptability on the other, to make the mutual influence what Plato and the romancists conceive as possible. By very different and inferior compliances on both sides, the feeling may be kept alive; if more is wanted, it dies away. The favourable conjunction for study and mental culture in general is friendship between two, or a small number, each natu- rally smitten with the love of knowledge for its own sake, and basinig their attachment on that circumstance. A certain amount of mutual liking in other respects perfects the relationslhip; but the overpowering sensuous regards of the Platonic couple do not furnish the requisite soil for high culture. As a matter of fact, those attachments, as they existed in Greece, prompted to signal instances of self-devotion in the form of surrendering worldly goods and life itself; and this is the highest fruit that they have yielded in later tinies. The remaininag aspect of sociability-the influence of the general multitude-holds out the most powerful and permanent niotive to conduct, and is largely felt in education. In the pre- sence of an assembly the individual is roused, agitated, swayed; the thrill of numbers is electric; in whatever direction the in- fluence tends, it is almost irresistible. Any effort mriade in the sight of a host is totally altered in clharacter; and all impressions are very much deepened. Having in view this ascendancy of numbers, we can make a step towards computing the efficacy of class teaching, pub,iic schools, and institutions where great multitudes are brought to- gether. The power exercised is of a mixed character; and the</page><page sequence="8">Education as a Science. 311 several elements admit of being singled out. The social motive, in its pure form of gregarious attraction and muitual sympathy, does not stand alone. Supposing it did, the effect would be to supply a strong stimulus in favour of everything that was sup- ported by common consent; the individual would be urged to attain the level of the mass. The drill of a reginment of soldiers corresponds very nearly to this situation; every man is under the eye of the whole, and aspires to be what the rest are, and not much, if anytliing, beyond: the sympathetic co-operation of the mass, guides, stimulates, and rewards the exertion of the in- dividual. Even, if it were the destination of a soldier to act as an isolated inidividual, still hiis education would be most efficaci- ously conducted in the mass system; being finislhed off by a certain amount of separate exercise to prepare for the detached or independent position. In every kind of education in classes, the social feelina, in the pure form now assumed, is frequently operative; and the results are as stated. The tendency is to secure a certain approved level of attainment: those that are disinclined of tlhemselves to work up to that level are pushed on by the influence of the mass. If there were no other strong passions called out in society, the general result would be a kind of communiism or socialism characterised by mediocrity and.dead level; everything correct up to a certain point, but no individual superiority or distinction. The influence of society as the dispenser of collective good and evil things, in addition to its operation in the affections and sym- pathies, is necessarily all-powerful in every direction. ' If this stimulus were always to coincide with high mental culture, the effect would be something that the imagination hardly dares to shadow forth. It is, however, a power that may be propitiated by many different ineans, includinig slhams and evasions; and the bearing upon culture is only occasional. Nevertheless, the social rewards have often served to foster the higlhest genius- the oratory of Demosthenes, and the poetry of Horace and of Virgil-a form of genius notoriously allied with toil and perse- verance of the most arduous kind. The same influence, working by disapprobation and approbation combinied, is, as I contend, tlle principal generating source of the ordinary moral sentiments of mankilnd, and the inspiration of exceptional viitues. The Anti-Social and Maliqn Emotions. The emotions of Anger, Hatred, Antipathy, Rivalry, Con- tumely, have reference to other beings, no less than Love or Affection, but in an opposite way. In spite of the painful in- cidents in their manifestation-the offence in the first instance, and the dangers of reprisal-they are a source of immediate</page><page sequence="9">312 Edtccation as a Science. pleasure, ofteln not inferior, and sometimes suiperior, in amount to the pleasures of amity and arecarious co-operation. In ilumer- ous instances, people are willingC to forego social and sympathetic deligi-hts to indulge in the pleasures of malignity. In the work of discipliine the present class of emotions occa- sions muclh solicitude. Tlley can in certaini ways be turned to good account, but for the larger part the business of the -educator and the moralist is to counterwork them as being, fraught witl unalloyed evil. Being a fitful or explosive passion, Anger should, as far as possible, be checked or controlled in the young; but there are no adequate means, short of the very highest influelnce of the parent or teacher. The restraint induced by the presence of a dread superior at the time does not sink deep enough to make a habit; opportunities are sought and found to vent the passion with safety. The cultivation of the sympathies and affections is what aloiie copes with angry passion, both as a disturber of equani- mnity, anid as the prompter of wrong. The obverse of ill-temiiper is the disposition that thinks less of harm done to self, anld more of harm done to otlher people; and if we can do anything to foster this disposition, we reduce the sphere of malignant pas- sion. Tlle collateral incentives to suippress angry passion in- clude, besides the uniiversal remedy of disapprobation, an appeal to the sense of personal diginity and to the balieful consequences of passionate outbursts. The worst form of malignant feeling, is cold alnd deliberate de- light in cruielty; all too frequent, especially in the young. The torturing of animuals, of weak and defenceless human beings, is the spontaneous outflow of the perennial fountain of malevolence. This has to be checked, if need be, at the expense of considerable severity. The inflictions practised on those that are able to re- crimiiinate, generally find their own remedy; and the discipline of conisequenices is as effectual as any. By having to fight our equals, we are tauglht to regulate our wrathful and cruel pro- pensities. Thle intense pleasure of victory contains the sweetness of malevolence, hei(rhtened by some other ingredients. The pros- tratioll and destruction of anl enemy or a rival is, no doubt, the primary situation where malevolent impulses lhad their rise; and it continue' to be perhaps the very stroDngest stimulant of the humani energies. Notwithstandilg its several drawbacks, we are obliged to give it a place amonC,g motives to study and miiental advancement. In the fight and struggle of party con- tests, the pleasure of victory eniters in full flavour; and in the competitionis at school, the same motive is at work. The social problem of restraiiiilln, individuals in their selfish</page><page sequence="10">Education as a Science. 313 grasping of good things-the mere agreeables and exemptions of the senses-is rendered still more intractable by the craving for the smack of malevolent gratification. Total repression has beei found impossible; and ingenuity has devised a number of outlets that are more or less compatible with the sacredness of mutual rights. One chief outlet for the malevolent impulses is the avenging of wrong, whether private or public. A convicted wrongdoer is punished by the law, and the indignation roused by the crime turns to gratification at the punishment. In the theory of penal retribution, some allowance is claimed for the vinidictive satis- faction of the public. To think only of the prevention of crime and the reformation of criminals, and suppressing all reselntful feeling, is a severe and ascetic view, beyond human'nature as at present constituted. The privacy of the punishments of crimi- nals, ill our modern system, is intended to keep the indulgence within bounds. A wide ideal scope is given to our resentful pleasures in his- tory and in romance; we are gratified by the retribution inflicted upon the authors of wrong. Narratives of evil-doers and of, their punishment are level to the meanest capacity; this is the sort of history that suits the imagination even of children. The highest refinement of the malevolent gratification I take to be the -emotion called the Ludicrous and the CoMic. There is a lauglh of vindictiveness, hatred, and derision, which carries the sentiment as far as it can be carried without blows. But there is also the laugh expressed by Playfulness and Humour, in which the malignant feeling seems alhuost on the point of dis- appearing in favour of the amicable sentiment. It is of some importance to understand that in play, fun, and humour, there is a delicate counterpoise of opposing sentiments, an attempt to make the most of both worlds-Love and Anger. The great masterpieces of humour in literature, the amenities of everyday society, the innocent joyousness of laughter-all attest the success of the hazardous coTmbination. Nothing could better show the intensity of the primitive charm of malevolence, than the unction that survives after it is attenuated to the condition of innocent mirthfulness. When the real exercise of the de- structive propensity is not to be had, creatures endowed with emotions still relish the fictitious forms. This is seen remark- ably in the amicable 'play' of puppies and kittens. Not being endowed with much compass of the caressing acts, they show their'love by snarling, and sham biting; in which, through their fortuinate self-restraint, they seem to enjoy a double pleasure. In the play of children, there is the same employmenit of the forms of destructive mlalevolence, and so long as it is happily 23</page><page sequence="11">314 Education as a Science. balanced, the effect is highly piquant. By submitting in turn to be victimised, a party of children can secure, at a moderate cost to each, the zest of the nialevolent feeling; and this I take to be the quintessence of play. The use of this close analysis is to fix attention upon the precarious tenure of all these enjoyments, and to render a precise reason for the well-known fact that play or fun is always on the eve of becoming earnest; in other words, the destructive or malevolent element is in constant danger of breaking loose from 'its checks, and of passing from fictitious to actual inflictions. The play of the canine and the feline kind often degenerates in this fashion; and in childish and youthful amusements it is a perpetual rock ahead. It is no less dangerouLs to indulge people in too much ideal gratification of the vindictive sentiments. Tales of revenge against enemies are too apt to cultivate the malevolent pro- pensity. Children, it is true, take up this theme with wonderful alacrity; nevertheless it is a species of pampering supplied to the worst emotions instead of the best. One other bearing of Irascibility on Education needs to be touched. When disapproval is heiglhtened with Anger, the dread inspired is much greater. The victim anticipates a more severe infliction when the angry passion has been roused; hence the supposition is natural, that anger is an aid to discipline. This, however, needs qualifying. Of course any increase of severity has a known deterrent effect, with whatever drawbacks may attend the excess. Btut anger is fitful; and, therefore, its co-operation mars discipline by want of measure, and want of conisistency; when the fit has passed, the mind often relapses into a mood unfavourable to a proper amount of repression. The function of anger in discipline may be something very grand, provided the passion can be controlled. There is a fine attit-ude of indignation against wrong that may be assumed with the best effect. It supposes the most perfect self-command, and is no more excited than seems befitting the occasion. Mankind would not be contented to see the bench of Justice occupied by a calculating machine that turned up a penialty of five pounds, or a month's imprisonment, when certain facts were dropped in at the hopper. A regulated expression of angry feeling is a force in itself. Neither containilng fitfulness, nior conducting to excess of infliction, it is the awe-inspiring personation of Justice, and is often sufficient to quell insubordination. The Emnotion of Power. The state named the feeling or emotion of Power expresses a first-class motive of the human mind. It is, however, shown}</page><page sequence="12">Edutcation as a Science. 315 with great probability, not to be an independent source of emo- tion. It very often consists of a direct reference to possessions or worldly abundance. In other cases, I cannot doubt that the pleasure of malevolent infliction is an element; the love of domineering, or subjecting other people's wills, would be much less attractive than it is, if malevolent possibilities were wholly left out. Power in the actual is given by bodily and mental superiority, by wealth, and by offices of command. Hence it can be enjoyed in any high degree only by a few. It is, however, capable of great ideal expansion; we can derive gratification from the contemplation of superior power, and the outlets for this are numerous, including not mierely the operations of living beings, but the forces of inanimate nature. For example, the Sublime is an ideal of great might or power. We have now almost, but not quite, led up to the much-urged educational motive, the gratification of the sense of self-activity in the pupils. This must afterwards undergo a very searching examination. Let us, however, first briefly review another lead- ing class of well marked feelings, those designated by the familiar terms--Self-complacency, Pride, Vanity, Love of Ap- plause. Whether these be simple or compound in their nature, they represent feelings of great intensity, and they are specially invoked in the sphere of edncation. The Emotions of Self. 'Self' is a very wide word. 'Selfish,' ' Self-seeking,' 'Self- love,' might be employed without bringing any new emotions to the front. All the sources of pleasure, and all the exemptions from pain, that have been or might be enumerated, under the Senses and the Emotions, being totalised, could be designated as ' Self' or 'Self-interest '. But connected with the terms Self-esteem, Self-complacency, Pride, Vanity, Love of Praise, there are new varieties of feeling, albeit they are but offshoots from some of those already given. It is not our business to trace the precise derivation of these complex modes, except to aid in estimating their value as a distinct class of motives. There is an undoubted pleasure in finding in ourselves some of those qualities tlhat, seen in other men, call forth our love, admiration, reverence, or esteem. The names self-com- placency, self-gratulation, self-esteem, indicate emotions of no little force. They have a good influence in promoting the attainment of excellence; their defect is ascribable to our enor- mous self-partiality: for which cause they are usually concealed from the jealous gaze of our fellow"Ts. It is only on very special occasions that persuasion is made to operate through these</page><page sequence="13">316 Education as a Science. powerful feelings; they are too ready to turn round and make demands that cannot be complied with. A still higher form of self-reflected sentiment is that desig- nated by the Love of Praise and Admiration. We necessarily feel an enhanced delight when our own good opinion of self is echoed and sustained by the expressions of others. This is one of the most stirring influences that man can exert over man. 'It exists in many gradations, according to our love, regacrd, or ad- miration for the persons bestowing it, as well as our dependence upon them, and according to the number joining in the tribute. The bestowal of praise is an act of justice to real merit, and should take place apart from ulterior considerations. But in rewarding, as in punishing, we cannot help looking beyond the present; we have in our eye merits that are yet to be achieved. The fame that attends intellectual eminence is an incentive to study, and the educator has this great instrument at his command. Praise to be effectuLal and safe has to be carefully apportioned, so as to approve itself to all concerned. As the act of praising does not terminate with the moment, but establishes claims for the future, tlhoughtless profusion of compliment defeats itself. Praise may operate in the form of warm, kindly expression, and no more; in which sense it is an offering of affection, and has a value in that character alone. A pleased smile is a moral influence. Discipline, properly so called, works in the direction of pain; pleasures are viewed in their painful obverse. The positive value of delights is of consequence as the starting-point where- from to count the efficacy of deprivations. The pains opposed to the pleasures of Self-esteem and Praise are among the most powerful weapons in the armoury of the disciplinarian. They are the chief reliance of such as deprecate corporal inflictions. Bentham's elaborate scheme of discipline in the Chrestomathia is a manipulation of the motives of Praise and Dispraise, which he would fain make us believe to be all-sufficient. Of the two divisions of the present class of emotions, namely, Self-Esteem on the one hand, and Desire of Praise on the other, the opposite of the first-Self-reproach, Self-humbling-is very little under foreign influence. To induce people to think meanly of themselves is no easy task; with the mass of human beings it is well-nigh hopeless. Any success that attenids the endea- vour is an offshoot from the second member of the class under discussion, namely, Dispraise, Depreciation. There is no mistak- ing our aim here; we can make our power felt in this form, whether it has the other effect or not. People live so much on one another's good opinion that the remission tells in an instant;</page><page sequence="14">Edutcation as a Science. 317 from the simple abatement or loss of estimation there is a de- scent into the depths of disesteem with a result of unspeakable suffering. The efforts that the victim makes to right himself under censure only shows how keenly it is felt. There can be little doubt that on the delicate handling of this instrument must depend the highest refinements of moral control. The Emotions of Intellect. The pleasurable emotions incident to the exercise of the In- tellectual Powers have not the formidable magnitude that we have assigned to the foregoing groups. Indeed, on the occasions when they seem to burst forth with an intense glow, we can discern the presence of emanations from these other great foun- tains of feeling. It is an effort of prime importance to trace exhaustively the inducements and allurements to intellectual exertion. What are the intrinsic charms of knowledge, whether in pursuit or in pos- session ? The difficulty of the answer is increased rather than diminished by the flow of fifty years' rhetoric. Knowledge has such a wide compass, embraces such various ingredients, that until we discriminate the kinds of it, we cannot speak precisely either of its charms or of its absence of charm. Some sorts of knowledge are interesting to every body; some interest only a few. The serious part of the case is that the most valuable kinds of knowledge are often the least interesting. The important distinction to be drawn here is between In- dividual or Concrete Knowledge, and General or Abstract Know- ledge. As a rule, particulars are interesting as well as easy; generals uninteresting and hard. When particulars are not interesting, it is often from their being overshadowed by generals. When generals are made interesting, it is by a happy reflected influence upon the particulars. It would serve nearly all the purposes of the teacher to know the best means of overcoming the repugnanace and the abstruseness of general knowledge. Waiving for a time the niceties of the abstract idea, and the obstacles in the way of its being readily comprehended, we may here adduce certain motives that co-operate with the teacher's endeavours to impress it. A little attention, however, must first be given to the various kinds of interest that pertain to Indi- vidual or particular facts. Any kind of knowledge, whether particular or more or less general, that is obviously involved in any of the strong feelings or emotions that we have passed in review, is by that very fact interesting. Now a great many kinds of knowledge are impli- cated with those various feelings. To avoid pains, and obtain pleasures, it is often necessary to know certain things, and we</page><page sequence="15">318 Education as a Science. willingly apply our minds to learn those things; and the more so, the more evident their bearing upon the gratification of our desires. A vast quantity of information respecti-ng the world, and respecting human beings, is gained in this way; and it con- stitutes an imnportant basis of even the hig,hest acquisitions. The readiness to imbibe this immnediately fructifying knowledge is qualified by its being difficult or abstruse; we often prefer ignorance, even in matters of consequence, to intellectual labour. All the natural objects that bear upon our subsistence, our wants, our pleasures, our exemptions from pain, are individually interesting to us, and become known in respect of their special efficacy. Our food, and all the means of procuring it, our cloth- ing and shelter, our means of protection, our sense-stimulants, are studied with avidity, and remembered with ease. This department of knowledge, notwithstanding its vital concern, is apt to be conisidered as grovelling; it has, however, the recom- mendation of truth. We do not encourage ourselves in any deceptions in such matters; and, if we make mistakes, it is owing to the obscurity of the case, rather than to our indiffer- ence, or to any motive for perverting the facts. Indeed, this is the department that first supplied to mankind the best criterion of certainty. There is a different class of objects that appeal, not to the more pressing utilities of subsistence, safety, and comfort. but to the gratifications of the higher senses and the emotions; the pleasures of touch, sight and hearing; the social aiad antisocial emotions. These comprise all the more striking objects of the world :-the sun and celestial sphere, the earth's gay colouring, and sublime vastness; the innumerable objects, inanimate and animate, that tickle some sense or emotion. In proportion as human beings are set free from the struggle for subsistence, do they lay themselves open to these influences, and so enlarge the sphere of natural knowledge. Individual things become interest- ing and known from inspiring these feelings. The culminating interest, however, is in living beings, and especially persons of our own species. The intellectual impressions thus left upon us are lively, but not necessarily correct to the facts. However all this nmay be, it is to individual things that we must refer the first beginnings of knowledge, the interest and the facility of acquisition. There are great inequalities in this interest and consequent facility; many individual objects inspire no interest at all in the first instance; while some of these becomne interesting afterwards, in consequence of our discovering in them relationships to things of interest. One notable distinction among the objects of knowledge is the distinction between movement or chalige, and stillness or</page><page sequence="16">.Education as a Science. 319 inaction. It is movement that excites us most; still life is rendered interesting by reference to movement. We are aroused and engrossed by all moving things; our attention is turned away from objects at rest to contemplate movements; and we imbibe with great rapidity the impressions of moving objects. This brief suLrvey of the sphere of Individuality and of the 'various attractions presented by indiviiduals is preparatory to the consideration of the most arduous part of knowledge-the knowledge of generals or Generality. All the difficulties of thc higher knowledge have reference to the generalising process- the seeing of one in many. The arts of the teacher and the ex- positor are supremely requisite in sweetening the toil of this operation, At the present stage, - however, the quLestion is to assign the motives colnected with general knowledge as distinct from individual knowledge. General knowledge, represented by Science, consists in hold- ing together, by a single grasp, whole classes of objects, of facts, of operations. This must, by the very natuire of the case, be more severe than holding an individual. To form an idea- of one tree that we have repeatedly surveyed at leisure round and round, is about the easiest exertioni whether of attention or of memory. To form an idea of ten trees partly agreeing and partly differing among themselves, is manifestly an entirely altered task; it is to exchange comparative simplicity for arduous complexity; yet this is what is needed everywhere in the higher knowledge. The first emotional effect attendant on the process of generalis- ing facts, and serving to lighten the intellectual burden, is the flash of identity in diversity, an exhilarating charm that has been felt in every age by the searchers after truth. Many of the grandest discoveries in science have consisted, not in bringing to light any new individual fact, but in seeing a likeness between things formerly regarded as wholly unlike. Such was the great discovery of gravitation. The first flash of the recognition of a common power in the motions of the planets and the flight of a projectile on the earth was unutterably splendid; and after a hundred repetitions, the emotional charm is unexhausted. With the emotion of exhilaratinig surprise at the discovery of likeness amiiong things seemingly unlike, there is another grate- ful feeling-the relief from an intellectual buLrden. This appears at first sight a contradiction to what has been already said re- spectinig the greater laboriousness of general knowledge: but the contrariety is only apparent. To contract an impression of one single individual, after plenty of time given to attend to it, is the easiest supposable mental effort. But such is the multi- plicity of things, that we must learn to know, and remember,</page><page sequence="17">320 -Education as a Science. vast nunmbers of individuals; and, we soon, feel ourselves over- powered by the never-ending demands upon us. We must know mnany persons, many places, many houses, many natural objects; and our capability of memory is in danger of exhaustion before we have done. Now comes in, however, the discovery of identities, wvhereby the work is shortened. If a new individual is exactly the same as the old, we are saved the labour of a new impression; if there is a slight difference, we have to learn that differeiice and no more. In actual experience, the case is that there are numerous agreements in the world, but accompanied witlh differences; and while we have the benefit of the agree- ments, we must take notice of the differences. What makes a general nlotion difficult is that it represents a large number of objects that, while agreeing in some respects, differ in others. This difficulty is the price that we pay for an enormous saving in intellectual labour. The overcoming of isolation in the multitude of particulars, by flashes of identity, is the progress of our knowledge in one direc- tion; it is the satisfaction that we express when we say we understand or can account for a thing. Lightning was accounted for when it was identified with the electric spark: besides the exhilarating surprise at the sameness of two facts in their nature so different and remote, men had the farther satis- faction of saying that they learned what lightning is. Thus by discoveries of identity we are enabled to explain the world, to assign the causes of things, to dissipate in part the mysterious- ness that everywhere surrounds us. When a discovery of identification is made among particulars hitherto looked upon. as diverse, the interest created is all-suffi- cient to secure our appreciation. This is the alluring side of generalities. The repugnant aspect of them is seen in the technicalities that are invented to hold and express them- general or abstract designations, diagramns, and formulas. When it is proposed to indoctrinate the mnind in these things, by themselves, and at a stage when the condensing and explaining power of the identities is as yet unawakened, the whole inachinery seems an uncouth jargon. Hence the attempt to afford relief to the faculties by teaching the dry symbols of Arithmetic and Geometry through the aid of examples in the concrete, and in all the abstract sciences to afford pleinty of particulars to illustrate the generalities. This is good so far; but the real ilnterest that overcomes the dryness arises only when we can apply the generalities in tracing identities, in solving difficulties, and in shortening labour; an effect that comes soonest to those that have already some familiarity with the field where the formulas are applicable. The liking for Algebra and for Geometry</page><page sequence="18">Education as a Science. 321 proceeds apace when one sees the marvels of curious problems solved, unlikely properties discovered, among numbers and geometrical figures. A certain ease in holding in the memory the abstract symbols, after a moderate application, is enough to prepare us for a positive relish in the pursuit. Such is the case with generalities in all departments. If we can hold on till they bear their fruits in the explanation of things that we have already begun to take notice of, the pursuit is sustained by a genuine and proper scientific interest, whose real grounldwork, however, deeply hidden, is the stimulus of agreenment among differing particulars, and the lightening of the intellectual labour in comprehending the world. These are the feelings that have to be awakened in the minds of pupils when groaning under the burden of abstractions. The opposition of the Concrete and the Abstract, while but another way of expressing the opposition of the Particular and the General, brings into greater prominence the highly composite or combined character of Individuality. The individual thing, is usually a compound of many qualities, each of which has to be abstracted in turn, in rising to general notions; any indi- vidual ball has, in addition to its round form, the properties called weight, hardness, colour, and so on. Now this composite niature, by charming several senses at once, gives a greater interest to individuals, and urges us resist that process of de- composition, and separate attention, to which are given, the designations, 'abstraction' and ' analysis'. It is for individuals in all their mnultiplicity of influence that we contract likings or affections; and according as the charm of sense, and especially the colour sense, is strong in us, we are averse to the classing or generalising operation. A fire is an object of strong individual interest: to rise from this to the general notion of the oxidation of carbon under all varieties of mode, including cases with no intrinsic charm, is to quit with reluctance an agreeable contem- plation. The emotions now described-the pleasure of identity, and the lightening of labour-are of avail to counterwork this reluctance. The second of the two motives that we have coupled together -the easing of intellectual labour-may be viewed in another light. When objects are viewed as operating agents in the economny of the world, as causes or instruments of change, they work by their qualities or powers in separation, and not by their entire individuality or concreteness. An iron bar, or a poker, is an individual concrete thing; but when we come to use it, we put in action its various qualities separately. We may employ it as a weight; in which case its other properties are of no account: we use it as a lever, and bring into play simply its</page><page sequence="19">322 Education as a Science. length and its tenacity. We can put it in motion as a moving power, wherein its inertia is alone taken into account, with perhaps its form. In all these instances, the magnetical and the chemical, and the medicinal properties of iron are unthought of. Now this consideration opens up an important aid to -the abstracting process, the analytic separation of properties, as opposed to the mind's fondness for clinging to concrete indi- viduality. - When we are working out practical ends, we must follow nature's method of working; and as that is by isolating the separate qualities, we must perform the act of mental isola-- tion, which is to abstract, or consider one power to the neglect of the rest. When we want to put forth heavy pressure, we think of various, bodies solely as they can exert weight, however many other ways they may invite or charm our sense. This is to generalise or to form a general notion of weight; and the motive to conceive it, is practical need or necessity. Tllis motive of practical need at- once bringss us to the very core of Causation, viewed as a merely speculative notion. The cause of anything is the agent that would bring that thing into being, suppose we were in want of it. The cause of warmth in a room is combustioln properly arranged; we use this fact for practical purposes, and we may also nse it for satisfying mere curiosity. We eniter a warm room; we may desire to know how it has been made warm, and we are satisfied by being told that there has been, or is now somewhere, a fire in communication with it. Thus it is that in proportion as we come to operate upon the world practically ourselves, anid from that proceed to contemplate causation at large, we are driven upon the a-bstracting and analysing process, so repugnant to one large portion of our feel- ings. Science filnds an opening in our minds at this point, when otherwise we might need the proverbial surgical operation. These observations will serve to illustrate the working of the emotion named Curiosity, which is justly held to be a great power in teaching. Curiosity expresses the emotions of know- ledge viewed as desire; and more especially the desire to sur- mount an intellectual difficulty once felt. Genuine curiosity belongs to the stage of advanced and correct views of the world. Much of the curiosity of children, and of others beside chil- dren, is a sham article. Frequently it is a mere display of egotism, the delight in giving trouble, in being pandered to and served. Questions are put, not from the desire of rational in- formation, but for the love of excitement. Occasionally, the inquisitiveness of a child provides an opportunity for imparting.</page><page sequence="20">Education as a Science. 323 a piece of real inforiimation; but far oftener not. By ingreniously circumventing a scientific fact, one not too high for a child's comprehension, we may awaken curiosity and succeed in impressing the fact. Try a child to lift a heavy weight first by the direct pull, and then by a lever or a set of pulleys, and probably you will excite some surprise and wonder, with a desire to know something farther about the instrumentality. But one fatal defect of the childish mild is the ascendancy of the personal or anthropomorphic conception of cause. This no doubt is favourable. to the theological explanation of the world, but wholly unsuited to physical science. A child, if it had any curiosity at all, would like to know what makes the grass grow, the rain fall, the wind howl, and generally all things that are occasional and exceptional; an indifference being contracted towards what is familiar, constant, and regular. When anything goes wrong, the child has the wish to set it right, and is anxious to know what will answer the purpose; this is the inlet of prac- tice, and, by this, correct knowledge may find its way to the mind, provided the power of comprehension is sufficiently matured. Still the radical obstacle remnains-the impossibility of approaching science at random, or taking it in any order; we must begin at the proper beg,inning, aoid we may not always con- trive to tickle the curiosity at the exact stage of the pupil's under- standing. Every teacher knows or should know the little arts of giving a touch of wonder and mystery to a fact before the explanation is given; all which is found to tell in the regular march of exposition, but would be lost labour in any other course. The very young, those that we are working upon by gentle allurement, are not properly competent to learn the ' how' or ' wherefore' of any important natural fact; they cannot even be made to desire the thing in the proper way. They are open chiefly to the charm of sense novelty and variety, which together with accidental charm or liking impresses the pictorial or con- crete aspects of the world, whether quiescelit or changing, the last being the most powerful. They farther are capable of under- standing the more palpable condlitions of many changes, without penetrating to ultimate causes. They learn that to light a fire there must be fuel and a light applied; that the growth of vegetables needs planiting or sowing, together with rain and sunshine through a sumnmier season. The empirical knowledge of the world that preceded science is still the knowledge that the child passes through in the way to science; and all this may be guided so as to prepare for the future scientific 'revelations. In other respects, the so-called curiosity of children is chiefly valuable as yielding ludicrous situations for our comic literature. A. BAIN.</page></plain_text>
