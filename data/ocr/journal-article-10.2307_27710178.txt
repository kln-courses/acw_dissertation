<plain_text><page sequence="1">Studies in Nietzsche and the Jud/eo-Christian Tradition. Edited by James C. O'Flaherty, Timothy F. Sellner, and Robert M. Helm. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1985. Pp. 391. $32. The eighteen essays assembled in this volume fall into four groups: those that explain Nietzsche's attitude to Judaeism and to what is here quaintly called</page><page sequence="2">296 Stern "the Ghristian ideology"; those in which Nietzsche's views are critically ex amined from a Jewish or Christian point of view; essays of the "Nietzsche and . . ." kind, including comparisons with Christ, St. Paul, Luther, Pascal, Lessing, and Kierkegaard; and finally there are two essays on Nietzsche's lin guistic views, which have not been related to the topic of the book though it would have been easy to do so. Clearly, in an enterprise of this kind some overlaps are inevitable, but the way the same arguments (based mainly on Nietzsche's The Antichrist) are repeated in many of these essays does not leave one with the impression that the editors took their task very seriously. They seem to have done little to save one or two of their contributors from flowery rhetoric and impenetrable obscurity, and many more from the bad habit of writing expository and critical prose in the free indirect style more usually associated with fiction; moreover, the least one could expect them to do was to collate all Nietzsche quotations with a single edition of his writings?and they have not done even that. The volume opens with an essay on Nietzsche as a "Critic in the Grand Style" by Eugen Biser, who singles out education, culture, morality, and reli gion as the four main areas of Nietzsche's criticism. While this essay is illuminat ing in showing the close relationship between these areas in Nietzsche's think ing, the concept of criticism with which Biser operates remains opaque. He portrays Nietzsche in the mode of the solitary critic (one who "had never found a place of domicile and security . . . moving from loneliness to lone liness" [p. 19]), yet the four topics mentioned are first and foremost areas of institutional experience, while Nietzsche's path led him further and further away from institutional life in any form. It may be argued that this increasing "pathos of distance" acted as a positive factor in his criticism, but no such argument is offered. Moreover, English-speaking readers retain something of Matthew Arnold's notion of criticism as a disinterested pursuit; however rela tivized that notion may have become, it is incompatible with Nietzsche's "existential way" (p. 18) and with the postures and styles he chooses?and again this essay has nothing to say on the problems that arise from this para dox. In his second contribution, "The Critical Imitator of Jesus," Biser briefly glances at Karl Jaspers's "Nietzsche und das Christentum" of 1936 and uses some of Jaspers's insights, only to concentrate on those numerous passages where it is "possible for us to hear in [Nietzsche's] No a repressed assent and in his accusations a suppressed homage" (p. 98). Jaspers's main point is more radical and more interesting. He is less concerned with Nietzsche's "imitation of Jesus" than with his indebtedness to Christianity, seeing this indebtedness in his truthfulness and integrity ("Wahrhaftigkeit" and "Redlichkeit"). Still on the subject of education, Hans K?ng writes on "What Christians and Non-Christians Can Learn" from Nietzsche. This homiletic essay (ex cerpted from one of K?ng's books) shows up Nietzsche's weaknesses as a critic of both Patristic literature and of Luther. It also makes the point that with his consistent belief in the ineducability of the mediocre and in socialism as a "tyranny of the stupid" (p. 347) Nietzsche can hardly be said to be in the forefront of either educational or political thought. Professor Harry Neumann's "Nietzsche's Interpretation of the Jewish In stinct" draws some illuminating parallels between Nietzsche's and Spinoza's reflections on the God of the Old Testament; but it offers little else of value, being wholly uncritical of Nietzsche's uses of "instinct" as a racial characteris</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 297 tic. Writing for pages on end in that unattributable style indirect libre I men tioned at the outset, the author never tells us whether he shares Nietzsche's opinions; the most racist of Nietzsche's reflections go uncommented. Defining politics exclusively in adversarial terms (he sees it, with Carl Schmitt of all people, as "the distinction between [what is a man's] own and what is hostile to it," p. 33), Neumann advances, and ascribes to Nietzsche, the thesis that the Jewish, and a fortiori the Christian, "invention of monotheism" has entailed the demise of serious politics. History since Moses' time (Neumann now tells us in his own person) has severed morality from politics and thus become a record of infantilism, because monotheism is said to be nonpolitical and in capable of restoring those "tribal politics" that are the stuff of real and serious politics. I found it difficult to decide whether Professor Neumann's views were meant as examples of heavy academic irony, or whether they are just irre sponsible frivolities. I now take the latter view, though my reason is quite unphilosophical: while I read this, there occurred yet another event in North ern Ireland's internecine conflict between two versions of monotheism?the lynching of two young soldiers in the streets of Belfast. It is then some relief to go on to Israel Eldad's sober and thoughtful "Nietzsche and the Old Testament." Confining himself largely to the pub lished writings, Eldad emphasizes Nietzsche's preference for the Old Testa ment over the New, yet in his observations on Zarathustra he shows some of the elements of parody and reinterpretation that Nietzsche derived from Luther's version of both. Eldad reports on Nietzsche's view of the New Testa ment as a life-denying and life-destroying document; and he seems to accept Nietzsche's view of Christian morality as "in its entirety . . . antisocial, anti nature," and of the Christian God as "an opponent of life" (p. 59). There are numerous scenes in the New Testament that contradict that view; and so does the very realism of the episodes from Christ's life recorded by the evangelists, which Nietzsche tried unsuccessfully to imitate. (In a similar vein Diana Behler quotes Nietzsche's claim that Christianity negates procreation [p. 201] as though "Suffer the little children to come unto me" were a saying of Zarathustra's.) But above all there is Christianity's central doctrine of the In carnation, not mentioned by Eldad, which may be seen as "antinature" but which, as the affirmation of the highest possibilities inherent in human kind, is hardly more mysterious, and a good deal more "life-affirming," than Nietzsche's "eternal recurrence of the same." Eldad is on firmer ground when he sums up Nietzsche's positive outlook on the Old Testament ("as well as occasionally on the idea of the 'Bible' encompassing both books," p. 59) by referring to Nietzsche's "general inclination to prefer [as in Greek philoso phy] the 'ancient' over the 'modern.'" Charles Lewis begins his account of "Nietzsche's Concept of Biblical Reli gion" by mentioning some of those qualities that, in the New Testament, make for an affirmation of life, though hardly in Nietzsche's sense of the phrase. "The justice of the old God, which was coextensive with the interests of his special people" (Lewis writes [p. 71]) was universalized in the interest of humankind, and then transformed "by its bestowal upon the neighbor, the suffering, the poor, the unfortunate, the powerless . . . into the religion of an oppressed class." In this way Christianity's highest values become those of egalitarian justice and a love that secures "the least of men from final harm, a love for which the blessed are these very childlike souls." It is this religion that</page><page sequence="4">298 Stern Nietzsche sees as the expression of "sublime vengefulness ... of man's ca pacity to diminish and denature himself," and that Lewis defends against Nietzsche's attack. However, at the centre of his argument Lewis places nei ther egalitarian justice nor love, but the concept of worship. Both Jewish and Christian worship are here seen as wholly inexpedient attitudes: not as a thanksgiving for blessings received or justice bestowed, not as propitiation in fear of punishment, nor even as reverence toward the highest good?in other words, not as a moral attitude at all, for "standing squarely in the way of such [moral] views is the theology of Job, which can be seen as an anguished affir mation of . . . the God whose will and ways are beyond the creature's moral assessment and understanding" (p. 78). And again: "The mysterious and gra tuitous love that can be found in the deepest levels of the biblical texts is not to be found in Nietzsche's understanding of the concept: he sees lying beneath this love, in its various expressions of it, the vengeance and judgment of a type of humanity. Morality is thus the basis and determinant of the 'new love,' which reveals and conceals its bitter core of ressentiment." In the end, this love, Nietzsche says, "wants to be paid well." Were Nietzsche not an advocate but a critic of this view, would he not treat the very attribution of mercenary mo tives with the utmost suspicion? Lewis is no antinomian. What he is saying is that, beyond the view of Chris tianity as a moral doctrine, there is Christianity as worship; that it is mislead ing to see it under one aspect only; and he is also saying, though less clearly, that Nietzsche knew this. In this argument the validity or otherwise of Nietzsche's criticism is not at issue. (On that question, a reader might ask whether there is anything in our experience, not as readers of Nietzsche but as social beings, that makes us agree with Nietzsche's unqualified condemna tion of compassion with, and love of, the selfless, the weak, and the lowly.) Lewis's point is that though the notions of unmotivated, gratuitous, and un deserved love and judgment are part of a concept of God that is "not without attributes dear to Nietzsche's heart" (p. 81), Nietzsche does not consider ei ther the Jewish or the Christian God in this way. On the contrary: his entire onslaught on Christianity stands or falls with the question of whether "the concept of Biblical Religion" can be moralized and psychologized. Perhaps it is no accident that Lewis's?and Karl Barth's?essays are not only the most clearly written pieces in this collection but also the most critical. The late Karl Barth wrote his monumental Die kirchliche Dogmatik between 1932 and 1962; his essay, "Nietzsche's Superman and Christian Morality," excerpted from the second volume (111/2) ofthat work, was written in 1948 (as the editors don't tell us). It is formally the most accomplished of the contribu tions, setting out its theme, seemingly abandoning it for a while, but then returning to it with additional arguments and renewed vigour. The theme is Nietzsche's encomium of solitude and his construction of the Superman as a portrait of himself as a man alone, as "the 'I am' of humanity without the fellow-man . . . the I am 'in azure isolation'" (p. 370). Barth is not concerned with the epistemological difficulties arising from Nietzsche's solipsistic per spective; nor does he introduce into his criticism the radical notion of Chris tian worship that is central to Lewis's essay. Barth's equally radical, and com plementary, refutation centers on Nietzsche's attacks on Christianity as a religion that speaks to men and women in association with each other? attacks by one "to whom a fellow-creature drinking at the same well is quite</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews 299 dreadful and insufferable" (p. 370). The historical part of Barths argu ment?the question "why Nietzsche was guilty of the Donquixotry of acting in the age of Bismarck as if the Christian morality of I Cor. 1 constituted the great danger by which humanity found itself imperilled at every turn" (p. 372)?receives a forthright answer in the demonstration of Nietzsche as "the most consistent champion and prophet of humanity without the fellow man" (p. 373). (Incidentally, Bertolt Brecht engaged in the same "Don quixotry," though for opposite reasons.) "Christianity," writes Diana Behler in another part of this book, "castigated . . . as a decadent will to decline directed against the very instinct for life and growth, is recognized [by Nietzsche] as still possible as an 'intensely private form of existence'?a paradox only if one does not distinguish the subjective, individual option from that of political Christianity" (p. 201). Not at all, Barth is saying: for the Christian there is no such "subjective individual option," for "Christianity places before the super man the Crucified, Jesus, as the Neighbor, and in the person of Jesus a whole host of others who are wholly and utterly ignoble and despised in the eyes of the world" (p. 371, my italics). There are two objections to Barth's view of Nietzsche. First there is his unquestioning identification of Nietzsche himself?the man, the philosopher, and in the end the thinker on the threshold of madness?with Zarathustra and the Superman: though Die kirchliche Dogmatik was hardly the place to expatiate on the Nietzschean rhetoric, Nietzsche doesn't necessarily "believe" what Zarathustra proclaims. Barth's insistence on hearing the various voices in which Nietzsche speaks as one is backed by his claim that Nietzsche did not write a single book that does not carry on his sustained polemic against Chris tianity (p. 373); and even though this is not strictly true of his earliest writings, it is true enough to serve as a confirmation of the centrality of his anti-Christian polemic and of his passionate involvement in it?occasional dissociations do not affect either the substance or the strength of Barth's case. But (so runs the second objection) what of Nietzsche's aim to present the Superman as a pat tern for all those other men (women obviously don't count) who are willing and able to follow his example? His "philosophy of the future" was surely not devised for one man only?is it not a doctrine for a community beyond the single man's solitude? The answer is that only the Superman's clones would be eligible for such a world, and would presumably fail to be elected because they are clones. In an expository essay of great clarity Joan Stambaugh's "Spinoza and Nietzsche" examines the points of contact between Spinoza's amor intellectus dei and Nietzsche's amor fati. She singles out the "complete and astonishing agreement" between the givenness of "my fate"?the "Dionysian relationship [of total assent] to existence" on one hand, and on the other the "non anthropomorphic and nonanthropological dimension of Spinoza's God. He is absolutely necessary and cannot possibly be other than He is" (p. 131). Stambaugh illustrates this kinship by contrasting it with the teleological view that both Nietzsche and Spinoza rejected (p. 141). Spinoza's is the vision of a God who, to be perfection, cannot have a purpose or telos outside Himself, while Nietzsche refuses to acknowledge a world process directed by an "as it ought to be"?again, a telos outside itself. The essay is at its most illuminating in trying to distinguish (as Nietzsche failed to do) between his notion of fate (one's understanding of oneself as fate, as?to put it in traditional terms?</page><page sequence="6">300 Stern "master and captain of one's soul"), and his notion of a fatalism "completely determined by outside forces or, more importantly for Nietzsche, by an out side Force, God" (p. 135). Stambaugh says little about Spinoza the Jew, while Sander Gilman, in a complementary piece on "Nietzsche, Heine, and the Otherness of the Jew" says nothing about Spinoza, but enough about the evolution of Nietzsche's image of "the Jew" and "the Jew's Otherness." Supporting his points by very long quotations from some of Heine's more regrettable poems, Gilman shows Nietzsche first under the influence of, and later in revulsion from, contempo rary anti-Semitism and its obscenities. "Spinoza's amor dei and Nietzsche's amor fati," Stambaugh writes, are two out of a large number of "feelings which get lumped together under the well worn blanket term, 'love'" (p. 138). And Josef Simon discusses the process of generalization in "Language and the Critique of Language in Nietzsche," basing himself mainly (as many others have done) on an early essay that Nietzsche dictated to a friend, but neither revised nor published. It is indeed one of Nietzsche's most remarkable extended reflections, in which brilliant insights into the semiotics of language are based on the flimsiest of "physio logical" speculations. Simon quotes the well-known passage on the meta phoric origin of concepts, paraphrasing Nietzsche's discovery that the con cept's "meaning consists in its becoming 'hard and rigid.'" (Actually, some concepts, like Nietzsche's "instinct," seem more like poisonous jellyfish.) But Simon ignores the full context of the quotation, and indeed of Nietzsche's essay as a whole?which is first and foremost aesthetic?that is, an evaluation and ironic celebration of "the artistically creative" faculty of man. Because of this omission, Simon seems not to see that Nietzsche's "theory of language" is above all a key to an understanding of his, Nietzsche's, uses of language. Fail ing to apply the "theory" to Nietzsche's own style(s), Simon misses the oppor tunity to make his essay relevant to the central topic of this book. Instead, he goes on to elucidate Nietzsche's view on consciousness and the self, and his rejection of the categorical imperative. Again one notes a surprising omission: it does not seem to occur to him that "the eternal recurrence of the same" is in fact Nietzsche's own dramatized version of the Kantian imperative. James O'Flaherty, one of the editors of this volume, in a piece entitled "The Intuitive Mode of Reason in Zarathustra," makes a valiant but not very success ful effort to set up a categorical scheme whereby to distinguish the two modes of Nietzsche's mythopoeic composition, that is, writing as the product of "in tuitive [later called Dionysian] reason" on the one hand, and of "abstract rea son" on the other. The distinction O'Flaherty aims at is between "unmit telbare Sicherheit der Anschauung" and "logische Einsicht," which Nietzsche mentions in the first sentence of his first book, The Birth of Tragedy. I can think of no more important task for literary scholarship to undertake than to set up such a distinction, but all we get here is mechanical enumeration in the Polonian manner, circular arguments, and inconsistencies (e.g., on p. 277 we are told that Zarathustra is a work informed by "intuitive reason"; on p. 279, that the "discourse ... of intuitive reason [is] nonreductive"'; and on p. 282, that Zarathustra is "so replete with imagery that the thought becomes difficult to follow," i.e., to treat it in the "reductive" fashion). But then, most of the linguistic arguments in this volume are written as though the analytical phi losophy of language had never existed.</page><page sequence="7">Book Reviews 301 Among the comparative essays there is Max L. Baeumer's sober assessment of the oscillations of Nietzsche's nationalism in his attitude to Martin Luther; Diana Behler's enterprising and convincing parallel between Nietzsche's hopes for "the emergence of the autonomous individual," freed from the incubus of a dogmatically inculcated bad conscience, and Lessing's "third gos pel for mankind," based on an internalizing of the moral prohibitions of the Old Testament and of Revelation in the New; J?rg Salaquarda's exceedingly elaborate explanation that the vehemence of Nietzsche's attacks on St. Paul reflects Nietzsche's belief that not Jesus but St. Paul is the real founder of Christianity. Brendan Donnellan's "Nietzsche's Critique of Pascal" illu minatingly juxtaposes opinions and views, never, alas, styles; while Gerd G?nther Grau's "Nietzsche and Kierkegaard" makes some interesting though occasionally impenetrable points about the Job-like situations of both authors; and, still on the subject of Job's disputation with God, Georges Goedert's "Dionysian Theodicy" presents the Dionysos of Nietzsche's last phase as a reincarnation of the Christian God freed from all notions of good and evil (reminiscent of that "knife without a blade which lacks a handle" which G. C. Lichtenberg discovered). Finally (and here I have an interest to declare) I come to Bernd Magnus's "Jesus, Christianity and Superhumanity," in which Nietzsche's views on Chris tian decadence and corruption, by now ground down to clich?s, are trotted out once more; and so is Christianity's "loss of instinctual vitality" (a view held, at a guess, by any member of the Hitlerjugend above the rank of Pimpf), and its habit of dressing up "thanatological values ... in life-affirming disguise." Like many of his fellow contributors, Magnus is so deeply immersed in the Nietzschean argument that he never comes up to enquire whether any of it is actually true, or, to put it more modestly, which parts of it conform to our experience of Christianity. Why, with the names of the Christian martyrs of National Socialism in mind, should we take Nietzsche's talk of the "decadence of Christianity"?take it, I mean, in its heedlessness, violence, and hysteria, as rational insights? Why should we not compare the record of the "great Nietzscheans"?the B?umlers, Oehlers, and Bertrams?under National So cialism with the record of the great Christians throughout those monstrous years? This question applies to many essays in this book, but above all to Magnus's, which goes out of its way to deny any connection between Nietzsche's views on the one hand and German National Socialism and Italian Fascism on the other. I have, on several occasions, argued the case for such a connection, and (more in sorrow than in anger) Professor Magnus deplores my arguments and finds them lamentable. Indeed, he considers them to be so self-evidently false that he feels no need to refute them?merely to quote them, he seems to believe, will demonstrate their absurdity. This review is hardly the place to discuss the various ways in which Nietzsche's thoughts have been used and misused by the National-Socialist propagandists?Hans K?ng shows, in this very volume, how close their notions of breeding and race come to those advocated by Nietzsche (p. 350). Still, to answer at least one of Magnus's charges: he quotes me correctly as saying that "Nietzsche seems unaware that he is giving us nothing to distinguish the fanaticism that goes with bad faith from his own belief in the unconditioned value of self-realization and self becoming"; and I do infer from this and many similar assertions that "the</page><page sequence="8">302 Foulkes intellectual superstructure of [National Socialism and Fascism] is as incon ceivable without Nietzsche's ideas as these movements are without their superstructure," and have given proof of this claim in more than one book. I did not for a moment claim, or suggest, that Nietzsche could conceivably have approved of National Socialism (as his sister was to do). I spoke of crite ria of distinction, and wish that, instead of comparing me to "Adolf Eichmann in the docket [?] at Jerusalem" (p. 309), Professor Magnus had indicated where such criteria are to be found. Coming to the end of this exceedingly mixed volume, I am puzzled to note that it contains not a single contribution that would illustrate and assess Nietzsche's stylistic debt to the "Judaeo-Christian tradition." "Fools rush in . . .": the sort of essay I have in mind would ask whether, for all his mytho poeic gifts, and for all his evocations of the life-creating virtue of serenity, Nietzsche was ever capable of writing such a line as "Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott," or whether, having repeatedly expressed his contempt for the resigna tion of "Mit unsrer Macht ist nichts getan," the philosopher ever allowed him self to grasp to the full the poetry and the vigorous life of the line that follows, "Es streit't f?r uns der rechte Mann." "They would have to sing me better songs, to make me believe in their Redeemer," Nietzsche wrote. Better songs? Such as his? I wonder. J. P. Stern Cambridge</page></plain_text>
