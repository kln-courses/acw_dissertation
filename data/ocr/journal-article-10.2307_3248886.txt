<plain_text><page sequence="1">D. T. DEVENDRA THE SYMBOL OF THE SINHALESE GUARDSTONE T he rectangular blocks of stone which stand on each side of the steps at the entrance to ancient Buddhist shrines in Ceylon are widely called Guardstones. The special word used for them is not known from any ancient source, but as many of the sculptures are prominent by the mythical semi-human beings, the latter being taken, so to say, as guards, the name of Guardstone is loosely used for them. Some of the figures, especially the Naga-rajas with multiple cobra hoods forming an aura round the head, are works of great beauty which contain a wealth of chaste ornamentation (Fig. i). They are also set amid a profusion of sculpture found in the adjacent Moonstones, scroll makara balustrades and risers of steps. The finely-wrought makaras and the scrolls, for some curious reason or other, appear at first sight to be concealed by these Guardstones which stand quite high enough to convey this deception. The reason for this position is not certain. The average person regards the semi-human figures as those ofpratibdra (door-keeper)i of Sanskrit literature. We shall see whether such an interpretation is actually warranted by the motifs. By far the largest number of the carved Guardstones have three motifs upon their faces: the Water Pot, Bahirava (a word which is better known locally than Sanskrit bhita) and Naga-raja. Rarely and in the remote districts away from metropolitan influences and traditions there is found an almost inexplicable representation, too2 (Fig. 2). But these were apparently haphazard motifs, not falling into any scheme and seem to be in the nature of individual eccentricities without a comprehension of the symbol proper to the occasion. When the idea of carving on the face of a Guardstone was conceived obviously a motif was selected from one of several. In this selection there must have been a guiding principle. The design could not have been picked up at random. In other words we have to imagine that the ultimate choice was symbolic signification. Among the Sinhalese Buddhists there is a sign of special significance, analogous to the black cat crossing the path or the horse shoe pointing towards one in the case of a Westerner. The Sinhalese Buddhist who sets out on a journey would seek no better sign of the outcome of his mission than that a person with a pot full of water should be the first to meet him. The water- filled pot placed at the entrance greets the eye of the invitee to a ceremony, domestic or religious. According to the Harivamsna of the Jains there was a royal line named Pratihara (founded about the middle of the eighth century A. D.) and Vatsaraja, a distinguished member of it, ruled in Avanti. 2 One example shows the nandiprda (or Buddha-pada). Another (Fig. 2) is that of a human figure resembling the Nga- raja in pose with a sprig in one hand, but with neither a pot in one hand nor cobra hoods framing the head. Both here and at Lahugala to the west the ornamentation of the block of stone itself, which does not appear to have been noticed by archaeologists, is of a unique type. 259</page><page sequence="2">It was in vogue among early Buddhists, whether of Ceylon or of India; in some of the Amara- vati reliefs we see it placed at the entrance to a shrine, more particularly where the Buddha is depicted within, and less often when he is absent. The Pot of Good Luck, as we may properly regard it, has been hardly shown (in Ceylon) as a mere outline. It must be shown that the pot is full. An empty pot is a most inauspicious sign. What is more natural, then, than to show flowers, leaves and stalks in conjunction with it? These would realistically convey the idea of fullness (Fig. 3). In the early carved Guardstones it was the Water Pot which most prevailed. A survival which has some reasons to be placed at the first century A.D. has been noted from Sanidagiri Dagaba, Tissamaharama, an early kingdom in the south of the island3. A water-tight chronological sequence has not been worked out for the three motifs which we have marked out for our discussion. A. M. Hocart, who was Archaeological Commissioner for nearly a decade, had attempted a study on these lines; but he confined himself rather to the general shape of the stone than to the sculptures themselves. His investigations showed that our three types existed, simultaneously it is true but sporadically, up to the ninth or tenth century; that the Naga-raja prevailed over the others towards the last stages of the classical period. He inferred this from the circumstance that he did not find the Bahirava (and presumably the Water Pot) in the twelfth century capital of Polonnaruva4. Although the principal types were found sometimes simultaneously the degree of frequency of their appearance would nevertheless suggest that the broad chronological stages should be: Pot, Bahirava, Naga-raja. It is indicated by several considerations, more suitable for a separate discussion. We shall then assume the Pot to be the first device employed to express the intention of those who conceived the symbolism. The Pot appears to have given way to a representation which, at first sight, seems strange and unintelligible. This new device was the unprepossessing bhzita of Sanskrit writings. In Ceylon he is called the Bahirava. The Bahiravas are considered semi-demons, living close to the earth, guarding buried treasures and requiring appeasement with sacrifices before the secrets in their keeping are revealed. The Sinhalese treasure-hunter, when baffled by the absence of the hoard expected as the illicit reward of his sweat, would often say: "The Bahiravaya has taken it away!" For the creature is reputed to play such pranks; the field-worker takes laborious care to forfend himself against the Bahirava's itch to spirit away the garnered corn! The Bahirava is generally sculpted as holding in one hand a shoulder-high "staff" with flattened and flaring top. But in many examples the "staff" is also jointed in the middle; further- more, the lower end is continued in the frame of the relief in a series of granulations. The "staff" is, therefore, not unmistakably shown as such and cannot be taken, beyond reasonable doubt, as a rod of office or weapon against intruders. A staff appears with a guard from Jeta- vana Dagaba, Anuradhapura. The right hand rests on the hip and the left on a staff which is shown obliquely. The figure does not appear to be that of a Naga-raja or a Bahirava5. Most pairs of Bahiravas wear on their head a stylizedpadma (Lotus) and the sanikha (Shell), respectively, which are expressed in the artistic idiom (Figs. 4 and 5). The largest of these pairs are in Abhaya- 3 Ceylon Journal of Science (Sec. G.) II, p. 75. 4 Ibid. pp. 13, 75, 76, and Vol. I, p. 97. 5 Ibid. II, P1.

Why was a human form - using the description loosely - now regarded necessary in place of the Pot? It certainly appears that human beings were now much more popular in the architectural context than they had been earlier where, in the strictest Theravada tradition, it was meet that not man but vegetal motifs should be represented in places associated with monks if such representation was thought neces- sary. In the course of time the restrictions were relaxed and human figures became prominent. It was also possible that, at the same time, a number of inchoate ideas (one being that of a guard) were associated with the (human) Bahirava apart from the very specific reason for his existence here on a Guardstone. We suggest that his very raison d'etre on a Guardstone is a continuation of the symbol of the Pot. Consider the physical features of the general Bahirava. The most prominent of them is his pot-belly, and we are of the opinion that this is exactly why the motif was selected in preference to many another, when the time was considered ripe for an animate device to take the place of an inanimate one in continuing the symbol. Again, we note that the idea of water is further indi- cated by lotus and shell which, otherwise, have no connection with the traditional bhita or Bahirava. The motifs are disparate but the symbol persists. If, on the contrary, the Bahirava is taken primarily as the door-keeper, despite the objections which have been raised above, then it would first be necessary to explain the gap in the ideas which underlie the two differing re- presentations on the same member of the architectural unit. Could there be such a break? It does not appear so, particularly when we note how the other constituents - Moonstone, steps, balus- trades - continued to explain the same architectural functions through the centuries. We, there- fore, suggest that the idea of the Pot filled with water is precisely the idea which the Bahirava represents; that though the visible form has varied the content has remained. From literary sources we gather that Safikha and Padma were two gate-keepers of Kuvera, the God of Wealth6. If our Bahiravas represent these individuals then they should be found only where Kuvera might justifiably preside. But they are found in places associated with the religion and only once at a building claimed as a royal residence. In the Nalanda Gedige too of about the 7th century there is a figure which is said to be of Kuvera. This ancient shrine was conserved in I893 by the Public Works Department without the direction of archaeologists, none of whom has committed himself to an expression of opinion as to whether the figure now occupies its own rightful position, to wit, in the centre of an arched tympanum, presently the pediment7. Astonishingly enough, we have what is clearly a more recognizable Kuvera in situ, and in a most unlikely place. This is on a stone plate used in the lavatory of one of the Western Monasteries at Anuradhapura!8 How far tenable is then the suggestion that Kuvera is associated with a complex of buildings with Guardstones? Assuming that it is Sanikha and Padma who have been personified on the Guardstones we surmise there is a more justifiable reason for their presence than as Kuvera's attendants. Safikha and Padma are water-spirits; they are associated with the nagas who are better known in the 6 Artibus Asiae, XVII ("The Significance of Sinhalese 'Moonstones"'), pp. 227-230, and XVIII ("Samkha and Padma"), pp. 121-127. Dr. S. Paranavitana has given an interpretation of the figures on the Guardstones with which the present writer disagrees. 7 Archaeological Survey of Ceylon Annual Report for I91 o- 1, p. 47. 8 Archaeological Survey of Ceylon Memoir I, P1. 39 (fig. io6). 265</page><page sequence="8">same connection. In the Ra-iatarangaef (completed in II50 A.D.) Kalhana has mentioned that they were regarded as tutelary spirits of the water, that one of them presides over a great lake. Safikha, in the opinion of the late Professor J.Ph. Vogel, is at least a partly Naga name; Sankha- pala and Safikhachuda have acquired a special significance in Buddhist tradition, appearing in a Jadtaka (of the former's name) and in the legend of Jimitavahana, respectively. The former is also a king of serpents. Safikha is a Naga-raja in Hindu writings, too, in one of which he is one of the chiefs of the tribe of serpents. The general idea prevails in Nepal and in some parts of India besides Kashmnir9. It does not appear improbable that folk-myths like these, which travel far, were known in Ceylon. Ceylon, too, has Naga spirits in its own repertoire. We tend to think that this connection is sculpturally indicated in some Guardstones at Runiu Maha VeheraIo. They belong to the fifth or sixth century at the latest and show the Naga- raja, accompanied by what may reasonably be taken as the Bahirava in much larger size than when the pair are represented together in later times (Fig. 6). Later on, the Naga-raja came to be prominent and the Bahirava was indicated diminutively as the idea progressed. So that, we have Guardstones of Vessagiriya, Ruvanvalisaya, Vijayarama and the Outer Circular Road (all of them in Anuradhapura) in which Safikha and Padma figure as the small attendants of Naga- raja (Fig. 7). Why was the Naga-raja brought in conjunction with the Bahirava? We suggest that it is because of the same symbolic idea. "In Buddhist tradition both Varuna and Sagara, really gods of the sea, have become converted into Nagarajas." So Dr. Vogel in his work. We have already mentioned the water-associations of both Bahirava and Naga-raja. We now point out a specific instance of the actual idea of the Cobra as connecting the two. This is in a relief from AmaravatiII. The illustration is of a thick garland supported by two Bahiravas of small size and one of them has on the head a cobra coiled with hood expanded and head raised. This is a clear expression of the relation of Bahirava and Naga and, to our mind, is the link between the anthropomorphic representation of the two types on Guardstones and elsewhere. We may here remember the fact that Ceylon and Amaravati had intimate cultural associations over a long period; in fact when Amaravati had become almost wholly Hindu there was yet a Buddhist minority in the fourteenth century, and it was the leading Sinhalese Thera who had carried out the last recorded Buddhist work at the well-known stipa of Amaravati, before it came to the attention of British archaeologists in the nineteenth century'2. We have now reached the period when the Naga-raja predominates and the other figures which accompany it should be considered as secondary, if not mere embellishments. Before we seek for the continuance of the symbol of the Guardstone we should examine the different positions of the Nagas in the ancient sculptures of Ceylon. The Naga motif most frequently appears in association with water and by stzpas. When placed on the embankments of reservoirs (locally, "tanks"), ponds or excavated pools, they are re- presented theriomorphically, and polycephalously as for kings. Theriomorphic Nagas are found 9 Indian Serpent-lore or the Nagas in Hindu Legendand Art by (the late) Dr. J. Ph. Vogel, pp. 150, 179, 197, 205, 215, 220, etc. 10 Ceylon Journal of Science (Sec. G.)

In all these cases it is the king who is shown by means of plural heads. Thus it is natural to expect a king depicted on the Guardstone, too. Could the Nagas have any other idea behind them; for instance, could we euhemerize from their presence? There were kings by the name of Naga until 571 A.D., but no outstanding act of piety is recorded of them, except of Mahadathika Mahanaga (7-I9 A.D.); neither did anyone of the name reign for a great length of time. There is, however, one instance where we may think on these lines. Built into the embankment of a tank in the Eastern Province there was found a sculpted slab showing an anthropomorphic Naga-raja in a devotee's attitude and ac- companied by royal Nagis. It is not known whether it is in its original position. However it is interesting to note that even here we find shells depicted'4. The Naga-raja of the Guardstone is an expression of a tradition which is precisely re- membered, for here he is in theposition occupied by Pot and Bahirava. Every Naga-raja carries a pot in one hand and holds a long spray in the other. These unvarying features convey an exact idea and take us back to the origin of the motifs. It is relevant here to note an instance of the integration of the pot and the cobra. When the writer was excavating a small stuspa in Padaviya he was struck by an unusual concentration of the representations of cobras on the floor of the relic chamber. The square chamber had a niche in the centre of each wall within which had been deposited a Buddha statuette. One of the three objects in front of, and away from, the Buddha, was (in each case) a rimless pot placed mouth downward. Upon the bottom (now upward) was a cobra with head raised and hood expanded (Fig. 8). The two pieces had been done in terracotta and fired together to form a single pieceIs. The stipa was close to the embankment of a reservoir and dated about the tenth century A. D. Here, it seems, is a fusion of two motifs and an expression of identity of ideas. The symbol of the Guardstone had been impressed too deepl to be forgotten. When the Guardstone as such ceased to be a separate member of the architectural scheme its place was taken by figures within a rectangular panel. Such figures are found at Yapahuva, a fourteenth- century rock citadel. Here, at the commencement of the third stage of the partially collapsed stone stairway leading up to some building which is now in ruin, we see two of such figures. They are women and each is holding up a jar in one hand16 (Fig. 9). We thus see how though the outward form has changed, yet the symbol itself has remained through the many centuries since it was conceived. Symbols die hard in traditional lands. It is not possible to imagine the Guardstones exhibiting pratZhdras (door-keepers), for then the figures should be recognizable in their own right: by means of a staff of authority, their stance, an indication of their station in life, and in other ways which we associate with those who stand guard. Nothing common to the three devices is apparent to convey any such function. It is conceivable, nevertheless, that each was associated with attributes added to its actual symbol; '3 Only one instance of the demi-form has so far been recorded and that at the Nalanda Gedige. (Arch. Survey of Ceylon Annual Report for 1910-II, p. 49 and P1. LXV). "4 Ibid. for I953, p. 24 and PI. IX. '5 Ibid. for I954, pp. I7ff. (writer's description) and corresponding Plate. 16 We have here to consider that the women have not only displaced the King, but should also assume that they, and not the tiny Bahiravas on the simulated Guardstones at the foot, are in the proper line of those who occupied the more ancient Guardstones. 267</page><page sequence="10">this is not unusual. The Bahirava may here convey the idea of a guard; the vessel flowers and leaves may there suggest the idea of fertility in the case of the Pot and the Naga-raja. But none of these secondary associations remain as the attribute common to all of them. What does re- main constant is the symbol. What precisely does the symbol mean? It means Prosperity. We have it in words in the Vallipuram gold-plate of King Vasabha (67-I i A.D.) introducing the royal grantI7. Siddha! In some pre-Christian cave epigraphs we have it in another form, that of the Svastika. Hail! Prosperity! This, we suggest, is the symbol of the Sinhalese Guardstone. 7 Epigraphia Zeylanica IV, p. 2 3 7. 268</page></plain_text>
