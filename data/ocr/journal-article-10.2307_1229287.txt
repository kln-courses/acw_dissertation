<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES Once a Peculiar People: Cognitive Dissonance and the Suppression of Mormon Polygamy As a Case Study Negating the Belief-Action Distinction Elizabeth Harmer-Dionne* In this note, Elizabeth Harmer-Dionne argues that the suppression of re- ligious practice, under the guise of the Smith neutrality principle, actually changes belief and that this comes dangerously close to violating the Free Exer- cise Clause, which purportedly holds belief sacrosanct. Ms. Harmer-Dionne reviews the history of Mormon polygamy and contrasts the once prominent po- sition ofpolygamy with current Latter-day Saint theology, which largely ignores the practice. According to Ms. Harmer-Dionne, this change accords with pre- dictions made by cognitive dissonance theory and law and economics as to the effects of external sanctions and pressures on belief. Consequently, she argues that meaningful free exercise requires strict scrutiny of governmental actions that outlaw unpopular religious behavior, particularly when that behavior has no demonstrably detrimental societal effects. To some extent this is a personal essay. I am a practicing Mormon whose grandmother regaled me with stories of the polygamous ancestors who peopled her childhood. Like most Mormons, I have a general sense of the early history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (the "LDS Church"): its founders, forced removal to Mexican territory (now Utah), and ultimate survival. Like most Mormons, I had no idea how central polygamy' * Associate, Testa, Hurwitz &amp; Thibeault in Boston, Mass.

Many scholars have written about both Reynolds v. United States3 and the belief-action dis- tinction,4 but few outside the Mormon community can truly appreciate the impact that decision has had on Mormon belief. As a Mormon practitioner studying my own religion, I ponder how the Supreme Court's role in Mor- mon history influences its present theology. This essay represents my at- tempt to highlight an inherent conflict at the root of much free exercise juris- prudence. To paraphrase Jonathan Boyarin,s this note also represents an at- tempt both to be a practicing Mormon and to practice being a Mormon-to consider my beliefs in a systematic way.

The official name of the Mormon Church is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The term "saint" indicates "one who would follow Christ," much as Paul used the term in the New Testament. See Romans 1:7; 1 Corinthians 1:2 (King James). Members of the LDS Church prefer to be known as Latter-day Saints. We are known colloquially as "Mormons," a name derived from one of our books of scripture, The Book of Mormon.

The First Amendment to the United States Constitution states, in part, "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or pro- hibiting the free exercise thereof . . ."10 The meaning of the second clause has fueled many First Amendment debates. According to Professor Michael McConnell, the free exercise debate divides between two different concep- tions of what religious freedom requires.11 The first-the no-exemption po- sition-argues that the Free Exercise Clause requires only that society and the law not single out religion for discriminatory or oppressive treatment.'2 In other words, formal neutrality satisfies free exercise demands. The sec- ond-a position favoring exemptions for religions-insists that formal neu- trality may mask de facto discrimination: "The evil includes not only active hostility, but also majoritarian presuppositions, ignorance, and indifference. The remedy generally is to leave the government policy in place, but to carve out an exemption when the application of the policy impinges on religious practices without adequate justification."13 This position favors strict scru- tiny of laws that burden religion and requires the government to justify a compelling interest before the particular law is upheld.

Among the most severely abused victims of the free exercise debate were the nineteenth-century Mormons who at- tempted to build a latter-day Zion-survivors of an ambitious but ultimately doomed attempt to circumvent the state and establish a religiously based system of substantive justice.14 Their history illustrates how a hostile legal environment can suppress a minority community that attempts to establish a distinctive social structure.15 Establishing Zion included restoring polygamy, an ancient order of marriage in which one man took several wives.16 Despite contemporaneous arguments to the contrary, polygamy met any measure or test of religious belief. Yet to gentiles17 polygamy represented a bizarre re- version to barbarism and provided a powerful justification for stamping out the secular power of the LDS Church. The question of polygamy is not merely a historical one. Both African Christians and Moslems may currently engage in the practice.18 But, despite religious motivations for practicing polygamy, they enjoy no constitutional protection in this country for doing so. As recently as 1984, a United States district court ruled that the Free Exercise Clause does not protect the practice of polygamy. In Potter v. Murray City,19 the court upheld a Utah city's dis- charge of a policeman for violating the state's antibigamy law.20 The court noted "a vast and convoluted network of other laws clearly establishing [Utah's] compelling state interest in and commitment to a system of domes- tic relations based exclusively upon the practice of monogamy as opposed to plural marriage."21 For good measure, the court reaffirmed the belief-action distinction first enunciated in Reynolds: "Freedom to believe or not to be- lieve is absolute. Freedom to act, however, is not absolute but limited or qualified by the power of the state within reasonable limits to protect society 14. See text accompanying notes 190-201 infra. 15.

Verner,25 the compelling interest doc- trine has faced a strong challenge in free exercise cases.26 Recently, the Su- preme Court has in principal opposed religious exemptions from neutral, generally applicable laws. Since 1972, the Supreme Court has rejected all claims for free exercise exemptions outside the context of unemployment benefits as addressed in Sherbert.27 In 1990, the Court formalized its objec- tion to religious exemptions, ruling in Smith that a neutral, generally applica- ble law that incidentally forbids the performance of a religiously required act-in this case, the sacramental ingestion of peyote-does not violate the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.28 Nonetheless, proponents of religious exemptions and a vigorous Free Exercise Clause press forward. One argument favoring exemptions from neutral, generally applicable laws is that such was the understanding of the framers of the First Amendment. Professor McConnell notes, "Even oppo- nents of originalism generally agree that the historical understanding is rele- vant . . .."29 He admits that the historical evidence around an interpretation of the Free Exercise Clause favoring exemptions is not entirely dispositive, 22.

One may disagree with the practice of polygamy, consider it irrational and even immoral, and still remain commit- ted to an individual's freedom to practice it. A third argument-and the one advanced by this note-follows from the libertarian argument. The state should allow religious exemptions not only because freedom to practice one's religion is a fundamental right, but also because a refusal to do so has detrimental effects on belief-belief being the one religious freedom the Supreme Court has consistently regarded as sacro- sanct. In Reynolds and other religion cases, federal courts have reiterated their commitment to freedom of belief.32 If restrictions on religious practice actually change religious beliefs, then the Supreme Court must consider, more seriously than it recently has, the protection accorded those practices. To support this contention, this note offers two different lines of argu- ment. After a review of the genesis of the belief-action distinction in Part I, Part II invokes the literature of psychology and the sociology of religion to argue that external coercion does indeed impact religious belief. In particu- lar, Leon Festinger's theory of cognitive dissonance discounts the constitu- tional distinction made between action and belief. In Part III, I present the history of Mormon polygamy as a case study on the effects of suppressing religious practice. Polygamy was once central to Mormon theology, a cor- nerstone in the reestablishment of Zion. The moder Church has abandoned polygamy, both in practice and in theology. Such a change may have oc- curred regardless, as the LDS Church attempted to expand its reach and in- fluence.33 However, that is not a cogent point in the theory of the free exer- 30. See id. 31.

Polygamy died an unnatural death, not one which proceeded from the organic evolution of Mormon belief. After repeated legal attacks and decades of relentless persecution, the LDS Church literally and spiritu- ally abandoned plural marriage. The Mormon experience indicates that not only may laws "interfere with mere religious belief and opinions,"34 but that such laws may fundamentally change them. For the doctrine of free exercise to have substantive meaning, it must account for this fact, a topic further ex- plored in Part IV. I. THE SUPREME COURT'S FREE EXERCISE CASES: FORGING A BELIEF- ACTION DISTINCTION In 1878, the United States Supreme Court ruled that the Free Exercise Clause did not exempt polygamists from a federal law that criminalized the practice of plural marriage.35 George Reynolds, a Mormon polygamist, ap- pealed his conviction for polygamy on several grounds.36 His central claim was that he could not be found guilty of violating the law against polygamy because he was practicing plural marriage as a sincere belief, central to his religious observance. Reynolds contended that the penalty for non- compliance would be "damnation in the life to come."37 The Court based its decision in Reynolds on several grounds. Under the guise of originalism, the Court turned to the history of the Free Exercise Clause and read into it a general proscription against legislating opinions or religious belief.38 Quoting Thomas Jefferson, the Court stated that "the leg- islative powers of the government reach actions only, and not opinions,"39 Donald Bowen, The Church Abroad, DIALOGUE: JOURNAL OF MORMON THOUGHT, Winter 1970, at 66 [hereinafter DIALOGUE]; Garth N.

The historical background to Reynolds is discussed at text accompanying notes 202-231 infra. 36. One of Reynolds' arguments on appeal was that the instructions given the jury were prejudicial. These jury instructions read as follows: I think it not improper, in the discharge of your duties in this case, that you should consider what are to be the consequences to the innocent victims of this delusion. As this contest goes on, they multiply, and there are pure-minded women and there are innocent children,- inno- cent in a sense even beyond the degree of the innocence of childhood itself. These are to be the sufferers; and as jurors fail to do their duty, and as these cases come up in the Territory of Utah, just so do these victims multiply and spread themselves over the land.

The Court disallowed the polygamy exemption for two other reasons: the opprobrium with which American society viewed polygamy and its sup- posedly deleterious moral effects. The Court considered the practice im- moral, barbaric, and contrary to civilized marital norms.42 Under the laws of both Great Britain and the prerevolutionary American colonies, punishment for the practice purportedly included death.43 Given polygamy's history, the Court found it "impossible to believe that the constitutional guaranty of re- ligious freedom was intended to prohibit legislation in respect to this most important feature of social life."44 However, the most significant rationale the Court offered for its ruling was its belief that polygamy subverts democratic ideals.45 The Court referred to polygamy as an institution that "fetters the people in stationary despot- ism"46 and declared that polygamy could not coexist with monogamy.47 Faced with this threat to its civil ideals, the government could favor monog- amy.48 Ignoring any ability of the courts to make analytical distinctions, the Court asserted that if the government could not outlaw polygamy, then it likewise could not prohibit human sacrifice or the actions of "a wife . . . [who] believed it was her duty to bur herself upon the funeral pile [sic] of her dead husband."49 The Court added that to permit polygamy "would be to make the professed doctrines of religious belief superior to the law of the land, and in effect to permit every citizen to become a law unto himself. Government could exist only in name under such circumstances."50 40. Id. 41. Id. 42. See id. 43. See id. at 165. 44. Id. 45.

[Vol. 50:1295 1302</page><page sequence="9">MORMON POLYGAMY Consequently, the Supreme Court denied Reynolds' free exercise claim and upheld his conviction under the antibigamy law.5' In doing so, the Court reacted to a concern that likewise informed the decision of the Court in Smith-namely, how a nation maintains the rule of law in the face of a Free Exercise Clause that may demand exemptions from the law. The concern is a worthy one, but the Court in Reynolds and Smith answered it in an inappro- priate way, one which needlessly impinges on religious freedom and individ- ual rights. The rule of law does not demand suppression of religious liber- ties. In fact, it often dictates precisely the opposite result. Although the bal- ance between majoritarian law and the rights of minority religions may not be an easy one, the Supreme Court has made some meaningful attempts to mediate between the two. A. Cases Recognizing Exemptions for Some Religiously Based Actions In 1940, the Supreme Court for the first time recognized that the Free Exercise Clause may actually protect some religiously motivated actions. In Cantwell v. Connecticut,52 the Court held that an ordinance requiring relig- ious groups to obtain permission from a designated official before distribut- ing religious literature was an invalid restraint on free exercise.53 Some crit- ics have suggested that this case effectively overturned the distinction made in Reynolds between belief and action. However, because the action in this case involved freedom of speech as much as the free exercise of religion, it is difficult to argue that the Court in fact recognized a constitutional exemption for purely religious action. The decision in Sherbert came closer to granting an exemption for re- ligiously motivated action. In this case, Oregon denied unemployment com- pensation benefits to a Seventh-day Adventist who refused to accept em- ployment on Saturday, her religiously required Sabbath.54 The Supreme Court agreed that to force her to choose between disobeying her religion and forfeiting state benefits violated her religious liberty under the Free Exercise Clause.55 The case is most famous for its enunciation of the compelling in- terest test, a four-part test for determining when a free exercise violation has occurred. To make a prima facie free exercise argument, an individual must show that she has a sincere and truly religious practice and that the contem- plated governmental action would truly injure that practice. The burden then shifts to the state to show, first, that a compelling state interest necessitates the state action and, second, that it has no alternative means, less burdensome 51.

Yoder58 marked the pinnacle of judicial recognition of free exercise exemptions. Here the Court held that the state could not compel Amish parents to send their children to school beyond the eighth grade.59 The Court recognized the state's strong interest in educating children, but stated that the interest must be balanced against the fundamen- tal right to practice one's religion and the liberty interest of parents in the upbringing of their children.60 Citing Sherbert and Cantwell, Justice Burger implicitly overruled Reynolds-at least in part-when he recognized that the Free Exercise Clause does protect at least some religious action: [T]o agree that religiously grounded conduct must often be subject to the broad police power of the State is not to deny that there are areas of conduct protected by the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment and thus beyond the power of the State to control, even under regulations of general applicability. This case, therefore, does not become easier because respondents were convicted for their "actions" in refusing to send their children to the public high school; in this context belief and action cannot be neatly confined in logic-tight compart- ments.61 Justice Burger further suggested that forced action (and perhaps forced inac- tion) can affect religious belief. He wrote that to apply compulsory educa- tion laws to the Amish would seriously endanger their religious beliefs by exposing their children to antithetical values.62 This would unjustly interfere with the religious development of the children and their integration into the Amish community.63 56.

The Supreme Court's Retreat from Compelling Interest to the Neutrality Test After the decision in Yoder, the Supreme Court refused to grant further exemptions under the Free Exercise Clause for religious practices outside the context of unemployment compensation.64 In 1990, the Court retreated even further, holding in Smith that if a law is rational, facially neutral, and gener- ally applicable, then the state need not carve out a religious exemption.65 Alfred Smith and Galen Black, both members of the Native American Church, lost their jobs as drug counselors for ingesting sacramental peyote at a church ceremony. The Oregon Department of Human Resources found them ineligible for unemployment benefits because they had been dismissed for work-related misconduct.66 The Oregon Court of Appeals overturned the decision, declaring that the state had failed to show a compelling state inter- est in withholding benefits from those who ingested peyote for religious rea- sons.67 The Oregon Supreme Court affirmed.68 The United States Supreme Court overruled the Oregon Supreme Court's decision69 and, in the process, changed its doctrinal approach to free exercise. One of the most startling aspects of Justice Scalia's opinion in Smith is the enthusiasm with which he cites Minersville School District Board of Education v. Gobitis70 and Reynolds, two cases at the nadir of American re- ligious tolerance.

Justice Scalia first suggests that perhaps the political process will rectify shortcomings in his very narrow interpretation of the Free Exercise Clause,80 but then acknowledges the flaw at the heart of this argument: "It may fairly be said that leaving accommo- dation to the political process will place at a relative disadvantage those re- ligious practices that are not widely engaged in; but that unavoidable conse- quence of democratic government must be preferred to a system in which each conscience is a law unto itself. . ."81 Justice Scalia fails to recognize that there is a middle ground between the extremes of absolute accommoda- tion of religious practice and absolute supremacy of popular legislation. This middle ground would recognize exemptions for religious practice, unless doing so caused measurable harm to other individuals or the body politic. As Justice Scalia predicted, a nation solicitous of the First Amendment did pass legislation in an attempt to give it greater force.82 The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 ("RFRA") was designed "to restore the compelling interest test as set forth in Sherbert v. Verer and Wisconsin v. Yoder and to guarantee its application in all cases where free exercise of re- ligion is substantially burdened."83 RFRA declares that the government can- of Employment v.

McConnell, supra note 79, at 1120-21; see also note 330 infra. In particular, McConnell suggests that Justice Scalia ignored the following declaration in Yoder: "A regulation neutral on its face, may in its application, nonetheless offend the constitutional re- quirement for government neutrality if it unduly burdens the free exercise of religion."

At least one state court has disregarded the Smith decision and has interpreted a free exer- cise case under the more stringent requirements of its state constitution. In Minnesota v.

The state decision upheld the right of the Amish under the Free Exercise Clause not to display triangular emblems offensive to their religious beliefs on their vehicles.

A mere statutory protection, RFRA has no binding authority should Congress change its mind and either repeal the statute or override it. In addition, in City ofBoerne v. Flores86 the Supreme Court recently limited RFRA's application to federal statutes only, holding that Congress cannot mandate that states protect free exercise rights the Supreme Court does not recognize.87 The Court's opinion in City of Boerne seriously discounts the burdens on minority religions of neutral, gen- erally applicable laws. It is legislative compulsion that sends religionists to the courts in the first place. Considering the sometimes unfortunate history of deviant religious groups in this country, it is disingenuously optimistic to suppose that misperceptions and bias will not once again influence legisla- tion on both state and federal levels. Under the Supreme Court's current in- terpretation of free exercise rights, religious practitioners have no safe harbor for their religiously motivated actions. RFRA also suffers from a definitional problem. The compelling interest test of Sherbert and the pre-Smith level of free exercise protection are not one and the same.88 Consequently, RFRA remains susceptible to different interpretations by various courts. In City of Boerne, however, the Court at- tempted to clarify this confusion by insisting that the compelling interest doctrine did not govern pre-Smith jurisprudence.89 Although the Court may be correct in its interpretation of the division of powers among state legisla- tures, Congress, and the Supreme Court, this is cold comfort for those dis- turbed by the Court's callous attitude toward minority and marginal relig- ions. If nothing else, the City of Boerne opinion has highlighted the desper- ate need for more vigilant judicial guardianship of the Free Exercise Clause. Although the Supreme Court's recent free exercise jurisprudence dis- heartens religionists, some of its actual holdings have been less harmful than expected.

In Lukumi Babalu Aye, the Court delved behind the surface of purportedly neutral city ordinances and, on the basis of legislative history and particular terminology, determined that ordinances banning religiously motivated animal sacrifice had discriminatory intent.91 Likewise, if one delves behind the 1862 Anti-Bigamy Act, one soon realizes that it was neither neutral nor generally applicable.92 The House re- port for an 1860 version of the Anti-Bigamy Act read as follows: [T]he moral sense of our own people, as well as of every refined and intelligent community upon the habitable earth, has been shocked by the open and defiant license which, under the name of religion and a latitudinous interpretation of our Constitution, has been given to this crime in one of our Territories... [T]he citizens of Utah, "with a high hand and an outstretched arm," laugh to scorn the sacredness of the Bible and the majesty of our laws .... It would, perhaps, require no elaborate statement to demonstrate that the framers of the Constitution, . . . when they declared "Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or the free exercise thereof," they did not mean to dignify with the name of religion a tribe of Latter Day Saints disgracing that hallowed name .... [I]t is more than probable that by the term religion they meant only to convey the idea of a belief founded upon the precepts of the Bi- ble; . . . surely they never intended that the wild vagaries of the Hindoo or the ridiculous mummeries of the Hottentot should be ennobled by so honored and sacred a name.93 More than a century later, we indeed dignify the LDS Church with the name of religion. Considering that such bias formed the basis of the belief-action distinction, it is appropriate to reconsider the validity of that distinction. II. SOCIOLOGICAL ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE BELIEF-ACTION DISTINCTION Students of law and economics, sociology, and psychology have long pondered the incentives behind religious belief and action. Contrary to ordi- nary expectations, external challenge and resistance may actually strengthen an adherent's commitment to a particular religious creed. Such challenges 90. 508 U.S. 520 (1993).

However, at a certain critical juncture, the opposition becomes too great. The costs of compliance force the believer to make a choice between conformity and continued observance in the face of adversity. This juncture falls at different points, depending on the strength of the group and the individuals within it. Some conform quickly. Others offer impressive resistance, but at some point they too must conform or be pushed to the brink of social and civil annihilation. A. The Effects of Positive and Negative Incentives on Religious Practice and Belief 1. The mainstream response to marginal religious movements. A marginal religious movement ("MRM") is one which challenges the social and theological norms of the dominant culture to such a degree that the dominant culture feels compelled to marginalize and sanction it, often with startling severity. In the face of mainstream opposition, MRMs tend to fol- low one of two paths. On the first path, they may continue to defy the domi- nant culture, in which case they remain in small enclaves and face continued persecution, often leading to obliteration. If MRMs follow the second path, they eventually capitulate to mainstream pressure and incorporate dominant norms to a sufficient degree to survive as viable entities. The timing and degree of capitulation depend very much on the commitment of the MRM to its deviant practices and the external costs imposed by the outside culture.94 According to Charles Harper and Bryan LeBeau, a pattern of "stormy, con- flict-ridden beginnings and subsequent accommodation" describes many re- ligious groups-including Mormons, Quakers, Shakers, and Roman Catho- lics-that had marginal beginnings, but that eventually gained acceptance in the dominant culture.95 Sociologist Armand Mauss notes similarities between the early history of the Mormon Church and the legal challenges that have more recently faced conspicuous and unpopular religions such as the Moonies or Hare Krishnas, two groups which certainly challenge the normative order of American soci- ety.96 The more serious and militant the deviant movement, writes Mauss, the harder society will work to domesticate it. If the group does not suffi- ciently assimilate, the host society resorts to persecution and repression,97 94. See Charles L. Harper &amp; Bryan F.

Sociologists Harper and LeBeau have identified an interesting phenome- non in the persecution of MRMs. The degree of accommodation demanded by the dominant culture depends less on the supposed heterodoxy of the MRM's religious beliefs and more on the extent to which the MRM appar- ently threatens national, secular values.98 A group's religious beliefs may incite popular opposition, but this opposition will generally not rise to the level of effective, official, and civil persecution unless the group's theology and beliefs challenge the current social order.99 Mormon polygamy provides a pertinent example of this phenomenon. Although Americans waged an intense legal and social battle over polygamy, their real concern was the per- ceived power of the Mormon Church and the belief that Mormons wished to establish a neotheocracy.?00 2. Religious responses to positive and negative incentives. Law and economics scholar Laurence Iannaccone has noted one of the elements of religion that greatly interests economists.'01 To the outside ob- server, the stigma and sacrifice associated with membership in a marginal religious group should render membership more costly and therefore less desirable.102 However, these apparently gratuitous costs serve a valuable purpose in that they mitigate free-rider problems by encouraging half-hearted members to leave the group and inducing even greater involvement from more committed members.103 In other words, religion is an ideal example of "nonmarket" behavior, behavior which responds to beliefs and norms rather than to unmitigated personal advantage.'04 Critics of the application of law and economics to religion seize on non- market, religious behavior as a basis for discounting the study of incentives in religion. According to Steve Bruce, religion cannot be economic in nature because religions themselves are not alternatives to one another.'05 Each re- 98.

Paul Diesling writes: Salvation is a definite end, so it can have means and a technique of achievement; but it is not alternative to any other end. It is priceless. The technical question, "What must I do to be saved?" makes sense and can be answered; but the economic question, "How much is salvation worth to you?" does not.

Salvation, being infinite in value, is not subject to cost-benefit analysis and therefore not subject to ra- tional economic choice.'06 If religious choices are not subject to economic analysis, then we may naively assume that the penalties society and government impose on a prac- titioner for her religious beliefs will in fact have no effect on those beliefs. If salvation is of infinite worth, then a person should be willing to pay any price for it, regardless of the penalties imposed by mainstream society. In fact, such a conclusion ignores two realities. The first is that both positive and negative incentives do impact people's religious commitments, regardless of their salvational beliefs. At the extremes, religious norms and actions do respond to economic pressures. The second reality, discussed in Part II.B, is that not only do religious actions correspond to incentives, but that religious beliefs do so as well. According to the psychological theory of cognitive dissonance, people both act and believe in order to minimize the divergence between action and belief.'07 This has serious implications for the Supreme Court's assumption in free exercise cases that action and belief are separable. A similar assumption has long influenced various analyses of religious change that posit that religious change occurs in response to the shifting de- sires of religious consumers.'08 In contrast, Roger Finke and Laurence Ian- naccone argue that religious developments mirror the changes in incentives and opportunities facing the producers of religion.109 They chart how legal restrictions have ended various religious movements, such as the First Great Awakening in the eighteenth century, and how easing legal restrictions has correspondingly allowed various religious movements to flourish.1? Finke and Iannaccone note with concern recent attempts to regulate religion through litigation regarding purported kidnapping, fraud, tax evasion, brain- washing, and clergy malpractice."' They posit that, in the post-Smith era, the government may pass "any number of 'formally neutral' and 'generally applicable' regulations that seriously constrain the activities of specific re- ligions" without regard to their detrimental effects on some religions. 12 Likewise, Michael McConnell and Richard Posner, arguing for an eco- nomic approach to religious issues, offer an effective rebuttal to those who PAUL DIESING, REASON IN SOCIETY: FIVE TYPES OF DECISIONS AND THEIR SOCIAL CONDITIONS 63 (1962). 106.

It does not tell us what to value, but it can tell us the most efficient way to obtain what we value.""13 In other words, a religious adherent's beliefs and preferences may not be objec- tively rational, but she will attempt to fulfill those beliefs and achieve those preferences through rational means. Because religious institutions require money and members, both limited resources, they compete among them- selves and also with secular institutions. Therefore, they are affected by government policies that either tax or subsidize particular actions. Accord- ingly, governmental actions may inadvertently or purposely favor or disfavor certain denominations. 14 Costs imposed on religious groups may therefore affect their member- ship. If an individual member can more easily realize her beliefs through another religious organization, she may have an incentive to switch her alle- giance. If no other religious organization satisfies the beliefs of the member, she faces at least three choices: She may remain a faithful adherent and suf- fer increased costs; she may forsake practice of her beliefs, but suffer guilt for doing so; or she may change her beliefs entirely in order to avoid both increased costs and the psychological discomfort of guilt. Depending on the nature of the belief, any one of these outcomes is plausible. Religions some- times derive positive benefit from moderate persecution in that the faithful adherents gain the satisfaction of proving their loyalty-hence, the first op- tion. As for the second option, people often live in some discord with their beliefs. The greater the discrepancy between belief and action, however, the greater the associated psychological pain.15 This increases the incentive to pursue the third option-an actual change in belief. Apart from concerns with one's ultimate salvation, there are a number of positive reasons, both physical and psychological, for membership in par- ticular religious groups.16 In particular, religious belief allows one to iden- tify with or against various social groups. Edward Tiryakian notes that fun- damentalist movements have a sense of collective purpose and being called 113. Michael W. McConnell &amp; Richard A.

The social isolation of ideologically ho- mogeneous groups ultimately produces extralegal cooperation and allows these groups to produce collective benefits not otherwise available.19 Timur Kuran has noted that fundamentalist movements allow their adherents to identify the failures of secular politics and sociology and to posit that such failures would be mitigated by a return to religion.120 Accordingly, increased costs do not always correspond to decreased re- ligious adherence. Rather, costs may actually be a positive indicator that an individual is part of a select or chosen group.'21 Members may associate other costs-such as attending services, participating in functions, serving on committees, or paying tithes and offerings-with corresponding benefits, such as peace of conscience and spiritual fellowship.'22 As long as the ex- pected and perceived benefits exceed the actual costs, these costs will not hinder membership. Again, they may actually encourage it. Social psychology partially explains this seemingly irrational response to increased costs. People commit themselves to causes for which they are re- quired to sacrifice.'23 In fact, once MRMs enter the mainstream, the most successful ones maintain an "optimum tension between the two opposing strains" of assimilation/respectability and peculiarity/militance.124 They se- lectively adopt traits that make them more palatable to the mainstream, but that do not abrogate their fundamental distinctiveness.'25 Nonetheless, even religious beliefs ultimately respond to rational incen- tives and cost-benefit analysis. Although some social costs lead to an in- creased commitment by the faithful, at a certain critical point the costs asso- ciated with social marginalization become too great to bear.

Ultimately, belief does respond to market forces, a powerful argument against the dis- tinction drawn between action and belief. The Mormon experience, dis- cussed in Part III, provides a well-documented example of both adherence to polygamy in the face of social costs and ultimate abandonment of polygamy when the costs threatened the very survival of the LDS Church. As the persecutions associated with polygamy intensified, Mormons be- came a more cohesive, insular community. To them, legal and social perse- cution indicated that they were on the path to sanctification.'27 Opposition hardened their resolve, uniting them even further in defense of their marital practices.128 In fact, one Mormon historian has suggested that the opposition to polygamy actually lengthened its survival by endowing it with greater theological import.129 Nonetheless, the persecution ultimately shifted the balance from proud defiance to crushed capitulation. The United States gov- ernment punished Mormons for their mass violation of marital norms by sus- pending their civil rights and effectively dismantling their Church. To save their Church, regain their civil rights, and obtain statehood, the Mormons abandoned plural marriage. They assimilated in order to survive.130 To Mormons, polygamy was a belief and practice fundamental to their salvation. Government persecution, however, caused Mormons to forsake polygamy. I argue that such abandonment ultimately resulted in a funda- mental change in Mormon belief, such that polygamy no longer plays a sig- nificant role in Mormon notions of salvation. B. Cognitive Dissonance and Change in Belief 1. An outline of cognitive dissonance theory. Previously, this note suggested three options faced by a religionist when persecution finally forces a change in religious practice: she may convert to another faith that largely fulfills her particular belief; she may cease to prac- tice the belief, but still retain it; or she may altogether relinquish the belief. In the event another religion does not practice the belief, the first option is not possible. If the belief is deeply held, then the second option will be a painful and difficult one. 126.

Defining cognitive elements as thoughts, atti- tudes, and beliefs, this theory "assumes that a person behaves in a way which will maximize the internal consistency of his or her cognitive system."'31 If any of the elements of a person's cognitive system are in conflict with one another, then the person is in cognitive dissonance. "Because dissonance is psychologically uncomfortable, its existence will motivate a person to reduce it and achieve consonance."'32 The theory of cognitive dissonance has suffi- cient predictive ability133 to bolster the argument that one cannot claim a meaningful distinction between suppression of action and belief in free exer- cise questions. Leon Festinger first outlined the theory of cognitive dissonance in 1957.134 Stating that "the individual strives toward consistency within him- self," Festinger noted a general consistency among one's knowledge, atti- tudes, beliefs, and actions.'35 Inconsistency among any of these elements results in psychological discomfort, motivating the person to reduce the dis- sonance.'36 As the importance of the dissonant elements increases, so too does the magnitude of the dissonance the person feels.'37 Accordingly, the person will work harder to reduce the dissonance and avoid situations that might increase it.138 Festinger posited that, to reduce dissonance, one may change one's own behavior, change one's environment,139 or most drasti- cally, change the very cognition (i.e., belief or opinion) that is in conflict with the behavior or the environment: "The dissonance may be reduced, or perhaps even eliminated completely, by changing one's own opinion so that it corresponds more closely with one's knowledge of what others believe."140 Once one has made a particularly important decision, she may reduce cognitive dissonance through several means. She may reevaluate the alter- 131. ENCYCLOPEDIC DICTIONARY OF PSYCHOLOGY 93 (Rom Marre &amp; Roger Lamb eds., 1983). 132. Id. 133. See Russell H. Fazio, Mark P.

She may also add elements to the entire decisionmaking process that cast it in a broader light, such that elements that seemed to con- flict with one another actually become part of a compatible whole.'41 Festinger termed this latter technique "cognitive overlap."142 Cognitive dissonance addresses the issue of coerced behavior, an issue of particular interest in considering the belief-action distinction. According to Festinger, "Dissonance almost always exists after an attempt has been made, by offering rewards or threatening punishment, to elicit overt behavior that is at variance with private opinion. If the overt behavior is successfully elic- ited, the person's private opinion is dissonant with his knowledge concerning his behavior . . ."'43 Significant reward or punishment decreases the disso- nance associated with the behavior because it offers external justification for acting in a particular manner. Still, if forced compliance has caused disso- nance, one may reduce the dissonance by changing her private opinion to accord with her overt behavior.'44 Finally, group dynamics likewise involve cognitive dissonance. When in disagreement with others, one tends to reject those with whom one disagrees and seek out those who share similar cognitions. This social support, on an immediate level, tends to block the discomfort produced by dissonance with the larger society.145 Robert Wicklund and Jack Brehm have refined Festinger's original the- ory. They note that taking an overt position at odds with an earlier position is "a form of conversion."'46 Following such a conversion, there is deep re- luctance to reconvert for fear of appearing hypocritical or indecisive. Also, once one has made a behavioral commitment, one tends to filter out infor- mation that would lead to a different commitment.'47 Finally, if one has made a cognitive commitment prior to experiencing dissonance, changing that commitment is more difficult.'48 141.

The stark contrast between the gentile rejection of polygamy and the lengths to which Mormons went to defend and practice itl49 suggests a large degree of cognitive dissonance between the Mormon community and main- stream society. Before persecution forced the Mormons to concede defeat, the disparity between their beliefs and that of American society increased the cohesiveness of their community and actually deepened their commitment to polygamy.150 Once they succumbed to persecution and abandoned polyg- amy, the Mormons were able to retain an active belief in polygamy for about fifteen years.151 Despite their inability to practice plural marriage, they could point to external coercion as justification for their behavior and thus mini- mize any dissonance they felt. However, as the United States Senate con- ducted hearings on the continued practice of polygamy, hearings which threatened to penalize Mormons once again by denying office to their elected representatives,152 Mormons felt increased pressure to bring their actions and beliefs into conformity with one another. By 1920, they had largely done so.'53 Because the final push to conform came from within the Mormon community rather than from without,154 Mormons could no longer point to outside forces for this change in belief. They had become converts to mo- nogamy and would now find it very difficult to reconvert to plural marriage. To decrease the cognitive dissonance of such a drastic shift in action and belief, Mormons went through a series of adjustments that allowed for cog- nitive overlap. The initial reason for abandoning polygamy was to ensure the continued existence of the LDS Church and enable members to practice other aspects of their religion. Mormons regarded the renewed commitment to monogamy during the early part of this century as a necessary step to be- coming good citizens and full members of the polity. With the passage of time, polygamy has become a historical and cultural phenomenon rather than a current theological reality. Mormons now explain polygamy as a practice that was necessary for a time, but one the Lord no longer requires of his peo- ple.155 As predicted by Wicklund and Brehm, there is no adherent like a con- vert. Having converted to monogamy, Mormons are in no danger of revert- ing to polygamous life. If anything, Mormon moral strictures against sexual experience outside the bounds of monogamous marriage are far more strict 149. See texts accompanying notes 159-179 &amp; 264-326 infra. 150.

Should cognitive dissonance once again visit this issue, Mormons would have deep psychological incentives for remaining monoga- mous. Currently, Mormons follow one last mode of dissonance reduction pre- dicted by Wicklund and Brehm. As much as possible, Mormons simply ig- nore the question of polygamy because, "[i]ndependent of adding consonant elements, removing dissonant ones, or lowering the importance of either, there is a mode of coping with dissonance that simply involves not thinking about the dissonant relations."157 For decades, Mormons have largely ig- nored the issue of polygamy; it is simply not a current question.158 III. THE MORMON POLYGAMOUS EXPERIENCE: A CASE STUDY OF SUPPRESSED ACTION AND ITS EFFECTS ON BELIEF Although polygamy is not part of current mainstream Mormon culture, it certainly is a part of historical Mormonism. At one point, Mormon theology maintained that polygamy was a necessary-in fact, the central-practice for eternal salvation. This vast evolution between past and present belief, the result of suppressed religious practice, undermines the jurisprudential dis- tinction between belief and action. A. The Theological Foundations of Mormon Polygamy Mormons were not the first or only ones to practice polygamy.'59 How- ever, Mormons endowed polygamy with unprecedented moral attributes by incorporating it into their eschatology.160 Perhaps the most radical doctrinal 156.

A review of several decades of the Church's official magazine (the Ensign), official weekly paper (the LDS Church News), and the 1991 edition of the LDS Bishop's Handbook indi- cates that the subject of polygamy is largely ignored by the hierarchy of the LDS Church. In fact, the LDS Bishop's Handbook does not even mention polygamy by name, instead merely referring to any relationship outside of monogamous marriage as adulterous. Unofficial Mormon publications, such as Sunstone and Dialogue, more frequently address polygamy, but even these publications tend to focus on historical rather than current aspects of plural marriage. For examples, see note 32 supra, notes 255 &amp; 256 infra, and Dialogue articles referenced therein. 159. Eighteenth-century treatises refuting plural marriage indicate some popular advocacy of polygamy both for philosophical reasons and as antidotes to social ills.

More wives ensured both increased progeny and greater future glory.'62 Men who rejected the practice of polygamy not only forfeited god- hood, but were damned. Accordingly, the salvation of women depended on their union with a righteous-by definition, polygamous-man.163 Joseph Smith evidently considered polygamy during the early 1830s and began to practice it himself in 1841.164 Publicly the leaders of the young Church denounced plural marriage, but privately they practiced it and began to test the reactions of a select group exposed to it.l65 Confronted by a public stance that contradicted widespread rumors of polygamy, members of the LDS Church were understandably confused. In 1843, Joseph Smith resolved the confusion by announcing the receipt of two revelations, now incorporated into the Doctrine and Covenants as sections 131 and 132,166 that called for the restoration of biblical polygamy within the framework of marriage to be solemnized-or "sealed," in Mormon terminology-for eternity.167 Al- 161.

As Mormon historian Richard Van Wagoner states: This emphasis on procreation became the basis for the Mormon concept of man's prog- ress to divinity. All of Joseph's Nauvoo doctrinal innovations fell into place around this new teaching. The prophet explained that God was an exalted man and that mortal existence was a testing ground for men to begin progress toward exalted godhood. Salvation became a family affair revolving around a husband whose plural wives and children were sealed to him for eternity under the "new and everlasting covenant." Id.; see also JESSIE L.

Generally, these men were LDS Church leaders with at least five years of membership. See id. This was consistent with the general instruction given in the Book of Mormon, another book of Mormon scripture, that polygamy is not pleasing to the Lord unless done at his express command: "For there shall not any man among you have save it be one wife; and concubines he shall have none; ... For if I will, saith the Lord of Hosts, raise up seed unto me, I will command my people; otherwise they shall hearken unto these things." THE BOOK OF MORMON, Jacob 2:27, 2:30. 166.

Partially in response to persecution of the Mormons, polygamy became the defining characteristic of faithful Latter-day Saints. Orson Pratt, the foremost apologist for the polygamous cause, declared that damnation followed rejection of the practice.170 The practice of polygamy was necessary to achieve godhood, a condition to which devout Latter-day Saints aspired.171 LDS Church leaders presented polygamists as true Saints, an elite cadre establishing a model by which other Saints should conduct their lives. It quickly became clear that polygamous marriage benefited men who wished to advance through the LDS Church hierarchy.172 On a more spiritual plane, LDS Church leaders taught that the choicest spirituals await- ing mortal existence would come to polygamous families.173 During the Mormon Reformation of 1856-1857, Jedediah M. Grant, a counselor to Brigham Young, stressed spiritual cleanliness, confession, repentance, self- sufficiency, and a commitment to plural marriage.'74 As a result, couples married in droves.175 Both my maternal and paternal family histories provide anecdotal sup- port for the temporal and spiritual benefits of plural marriage. George Q. Cannon, my great-great-great-grandfather, was an apostle and a first coun- selor to several LDS Church presidents.

One reward for converting to Mormonism and leaving his beloved England in 1843 is the existence of over 21,000 Cannon descendants currently living in the United States, a testament to the power of polygamy in ensuring progeny.177 Another ancestor, Loren Hannibal Harmer, was a bishop in Springville, Utah, for six years before being convicted of polygamy and imprisoned for several years. He too engaged in a post-Manifesto marriage and fathered many children. He later testified in the 1903 Smoot Senate Hearings'78 about his conviction and imprisonment, declaring that he had committed adultery rather than admitting to the Senate that he had practiced polygamy.

A Peculiar People: Fears of Mormon Political Dominance 1. The initial public reaction. When the LDS Church made its 1852 announcement regarding polyg- amy, public opposition to the practice quickly coalesced. Clergymen, women's leaders, and newspaper editors all called on national leaders to wipe out the practice.180 In 1856, the newly formed Republican Party called for the eradication of polygamy and slavery, the "twin relics of barba- rism."'8' In 1857, President Buchanan authorized a $15 million invasion of Utah intended to intimidate the Mormon leadership and cause them to revoke the practice.'82 In the face of Mormon quiescence, the invasion floundered, earning the name "Buchanan's Blunder."'83 Soon thereafter, Congress passed the 1862 Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act.'84 Yet, despite a series of bills 177.

Sanctions for the practice included suspension of the rights to sit on juries, hold public of- fice, vote, or become a naturalized citizen.'87 When the Cullom Bill passed the house, citizens of Salt Lake City sent a desperate message to the Senate: "We ... are believers in the principle of plural marriage or polygamy ... not simply as an elevating social relationship and a preventive of many terrible evils which afflict our race, but as a principle revealed by god [sic], under- lying our every hope of eternal salvation and happiness in heaven."'88 Mi- raculously, the bill was kept from the Senate floor.'89 2. Establishing a literal, millennial Zion. To judge the persecutors of Mormonism fairly, one must recognize the nineteenth-century perception of Mormonism and the challenge posed by the Latter-day Saints to governmental authority. Mormons were an incredibly cohesive group, one which voted as a political block and which answered first to their ecclesiastical leaders.'90 Passionately committed to their cause, Mormons quickly established themselves wherever they settled. They were not loathe to announce that they had come to establish a new Zion-a city and people devoted to God and committed to the establishment of justice, social and economic equality, and spiritual purity.19' The 1844 martyrdom 185.

They passionately maintained that polygamy, as a tenet of their religion and an express command from God, enjoyed constitutional protection.195 In a New York Herald article published on July 15, 1852, W.W. Phelps, a Mor- mon editor, insisted that neither the United States government nor the Utah territorial congress had control over religion, morality, or polygamy.196 Matters of conscience answered solely to "the word of the Lord."197 Thus, LDS Church leaders denounced the 1862 Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act as a pat- ently unconstitutional abrogation of their First Amendment rights.'98 United States authorities were not convinced. In 1856, while the Repub- lican Party denounced polygamy by equating it with slavery, the real concern of both Republicans and Democrats was the secular power of the LDS Church. According to Idaho Senator Frederick Dubois: Those of us who understand the situation were not nearly so much opposed to polygamy as we were to the political domination of the Church .... There was a universal detestation of polygamy, and inasmuch as the Mormons openly defended it we were given a very effective weapon with which to attack.199 Hoping to attain statehood and its concomitant privileges and powers for their territory, Latter-day Saints sided with the Democratic Party, which strongly advocated states' rights. However, Stephen A. Douglas, then Democratic Chair of the Senate Committee on Territories, laid to rest Mor- mon hopes of Democratic support by declaring that Mormons "were a trai- torous group whose allegiance to Brigham Young superseded their commit- Lake Valley.

He retorted that neither the President nor Congress had any business med- dling with polygamy and that Mormons would become "a sovereign State in the Union, or an independent nation by ourselves."201 3. The Supreme Court's distinction between belief and action. In 1874, George Reynolds, Brigham Young's personal secretary, agreed to be tried in a test case of the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act.202 An English con- vert to Mormonism, Reynolds spent his life serving the LDS Church as a scholar, theologian, author, missionary, and cofounder of its Sunday school program.203 He was also a devoted father and, at the time of his trial, hus- band to two women.204 Reynolds stated that he entered plural marriage "most thoroughly convinced" that it was "the Law of the Lord" and that he had an affirmative obligation to do so in order to "escape condemnation and [God's] displeasure."205 Polygamy was an expression of his "most deep seated religious convictions."206 Early on, federal prosecutors agreed to drop charges against LDS Church leaders in exchange for Reynolds' cooperation in the test case.207 Convinced that the Constitution would protect their pecu- liar institution, LDS Church leaders encouraged the trial to go forward.208 They believed they would win on the basis of their sincere religious belief in the centrality of polygamy to their eternal salvation. After his initial conviction was overturned on jury irregularities, Rey- nolds was again found guilty in a second trial one year later.209 Judge Alex- ander White's charge to the jury presaged the Supreme Court's ultimate rul- ing against Reynolds: "In matters of opinion, and especially in matters of religious belief, . . . all men are free.

Waite rejected this argument, writing that the monogamous family is the basis of Western society and that, in the interest of social order, the government has the power to preserve it by suppressing polygamy.213 Religious conviction did not give one the right to defy the law and violate one's "social duties."214 Mormons greeted the Court's decision with shock. George Reynolds' words reflected the feelings of his community: I regard [the decision] a nullification of the Constitution, so far as religious lib- erty is concerned. To say the Constitution simply grants freedom of religious opinion but not the exercise of that opinion is twaddle .... I should never have taken a second wife had I not considered that in so doing I was obeying a law of God, which I could not evade without just condemnation.215 Congress read the Reynolds decision as tacit permission to impose more stringent antipolygamy legislation and acted accordingly. The 1882 Ed- munds Act216 facilitated prosecution of polygamy by creating a new of- fense-unlawful cohabitation-that required no proof of marriage and thus closed a loophole in the Morrill Act.217 The Edmunds Act also imposed civil disabilities on polygamists, canceling their rights to vote, hold public office, and serve on juries.218 After a marked increase in polygamy prosecutions, Mormon polygamists accounted for most of the Utah prison population. Those lucky enough to escape imprisonment went into hiding.219 212. See Reynolds v. United States, 98 U.S. 145, 161 (1878). 213. See id. at 166-67.

It disenfran- chised women under the assumption that they would vote only according to their husbands' dictates.221 The Act disincorporated the LDS Church, trans- ferred all its property to the government, and dissolved the company that had funded and overseen all Mormon emigration to Utah.222 Voters had to swear to uphold the 1882 Edmunds Act before they were registered.223 Witnesses had to attend trials without benefit of subpoena.224 Federal officials could prosecute adultery whether or not a spouse filed a complaint.225 Wives could be called to testify against their husbands.226 Some have called this the most intense campaign against any outlawed religious group in American his- tory.227 In 1885, President Cleveland recommended that Congress prohibit foreign-bor Mormons from entering the United States.228 Several years later, Congress proposed the Cullom-Strubble Bill, which would have stripped Utah Mormons of their rights as American citizens.229 The 1890 bill was a response to a Supreme Court decision that upheld the constitutionality of the Idaho test oath, which disfranchised Idaho Mormons.230 The LDS Church was exhausted; that same year, it capitulated and issued the Mani- festo, commencing the gradual eradication of polygamy.231 C. A Peculiar People: Pseudo-Scientific Claims in the Polygamy Debate Mormons and gentiles alike voiced exaggerated claims regarding polyg- amy. Mormons claimed that it would ameliorate social ills. Gentiles insisted that, to the contrary, polygamy was at the root of social ills and threatened democratic government. According to legal scholar Robert Dyer, the latter view prevailed when the Supreme Court upheld Reynolds and allowed the suppression of polygamy.232 He contrasts the conclusory statements in the Reynolds opinion with the detailed psychological studies that frequently ac- company moder briefs.

I charge it to be a crying evil; sapping not only the physical constitution of the people practicing it, dwarf- ing their physical proportions and emasculating their energies, but at the same time perverting the social virtues, and vitiating the morals of its vic- tims."236 Voicing concerns about the Church's political dominance, McCler- nand equated polygamy with political despotism and further stated that it "invariably begets among the people who practice it the extremes of brutal bloodthirstiness or timid and mean prevarication," attributes in opposition to vigorous democracy.237 Despite sensational descriptions of polygamy, Mormon polygamy was essentially a puritanical system introduced to people raised in a framework of monogamy.238 One demographic study suggests that, at most, twenty percent of Mormon families practiced polygamy and that of those, the vast majority (roughly two-thirds) involved only two wives.239 Brigham Young wrote that when Joseph Smith first revealed the practice to him, he "desired the grave."240 However, by 1865, he wrote, "God never introduced the Patriar- chal order of marriage [polygamy] with a view to please man in his carnal desires, nor to punish females for anything which they had done; but He in- troduced it for the express purpose of raising up to His name a royal Priest- hood, a peculiar people."241 It is a truism among Mormons that the most faithful members of the early Church came from polygamous families and 233. Maura I. Strassberg has made a rather odd argument that polygamy should be outlawed, but that same-sex marriages should not. She bases this conclusion on a Hegelian argument that polygamy results in despotism to the individual. Maura I. Strassberg, Distinctions of Form or Sub- stance: Monogamy, Polygamy, and Same-Sex Marriage, 75 N.C. L. Rev. 1501, 1532-36 (1997). However, in making this argument, Professor Strassberg overstates the degree to which Mormons rely on authority for truth and appears to be ignorant of the strongly individualistic tendencies in much Mormon theology. 234.

Antipolygamy laws did not criminalize informal sexual relations between men and women, nor did they require any proof of sexual intimacy for criminal conviction. Rather, the laws attacked a marital system that prima facie challenged the notion that monogamy was the only acceptable social form of marriage.247 Just as the gentiles used social arguments to attack polygamy, Mormons used social arguments to defend it. Among the more hyperbolic were that polygamous men were more vigorous and produced healthier offspring and that more valiant spirits came to polygamous homes.248 Other arguments sound more persuasive to moder ears. Traditional marriages were fre- quently unhappy. Why not allow the Mormons to attempt an improvement by experimenting with a different form of marriage? Historically, many na- tions of the world have practiced some form of plural marriage.249 Why then is polygamy not the natural social order? Where there is a surplus of women and their status depends very much on being a wife and mother, why not provide them with such status? Would this not eliminate the evils of adultery and prostitution?250 In fact, the Mormon women who married into polygamy often did enjoy a higher social status than those in monogamous situations.251 The reality of polygamy very much reflected the reality of monogamy: Sometimes it worked, and sometimes it didn't. It did provide a social net- work and welfare system.252 Often the women who married into polygamy 242. See JESSIE L. EMBRY, MORMON POLYGAMOUS FAMILIES: LIFE IN THE PRINCIPLE 8, 62- 65 (1987). 243.

The manner of courtship, the number of wives, and the manner of support all varied, as did the happiness of the participants in these ar- rangements.255 Many wives were very close, with well-adjusted children who considered themselves part of the general family.256 According to Martha Cragun Cox, she and her two "sister wives" "loved each other more than sisters, children of one mother love .... We enjoyed many privileges that single wifery never knew," such as sharing childcare and housekeeping duties.257 My own grandmother, Claudia Cannon Jonas, often spoke of the close- ness between her grandmother, Wilhelmina Mousely Cannon Cannon ("Grandma Miney"),258 and her sister wives (collectively referred to by the various grandchildren as the "aunt grandmas"). Long after their common husband had died, the women visited back-and-forth, caring for one another during illness, mourning together in the face of death, and rejoicing together during holidays and joyful times. On the other hand, other women endured dreadful situations, ridden with strife and jealousy, from which their children bore sensitive scars.259 And much as Grandma Miney loved the other aunt grandmas, it is telling that, after the death of her first husband, she chose to marry a gentile. 253.

Many pursued careers in business, medicine, politics, journalism, and writing.260 Emmeline B. Wells declared that polygamy "gives women the highest opportunities for self-development, exercise of judgment, and arouses latent faculties, making them more truly cultivated in the actual realities of life, more independent in thought and mind, noble and unselfish."261 As Martha Cannon, third wife of Angus M. Cannon, more bluntly put it, "If [a woman's] husband has four wives, ... she has three weeks of freedom every month."262 Nonetheless, polygamy required extraordinary dedication from the women who practiced it, a deliberate suppression of monogamous expecta- tions for the sake of religious conviction. Zina D. Jacobs Smith Young, a plural wife of Brigham Young, speaking in 1869 and then 1876, described polygamy as follows: Much of the unhappiness found in polygamous families is due to the women themselves .... They expect too much attention from the husband, and because they do not get it, or see a little attention bestowed upon one of the other wives, they become sullen and morose .... [A] successful polygamous wife must re- gard her husband with indifference, and with no other feeling than that of rever- ence, for love we regard as a false sentiment; a feeling which should have no existence in polygamy.263 Thus, in sum, polygamy was not the depraved and sensuous institution envisioned by the United States, and there was insufficient evidence of its detrimental effects to justify the very real civil disabilities and personal per- secutions visited on its Mormon adherents. Polygamy did challenge the mo- nogamous ideal, but it required such religious commitment and suppression of traditional desires from those willing to enter into it that it posed little threat of supplanting traditional marital norms.

In 1885, George Q. Cannon, First Counselor to President Taylor and considered by many to be the real leader of the LDS Church, invoked God's wrath as the reason for rejecting the Cleveland administration's call for a public statement aban- doning polygamy.266 A wanted man, Cannon finally turned himself over to authorities in 1888 to demonstrate his commitment to the cause of polyg- amy.267 Not everyone was so hardy, however. With LDS Church leaders in hiding or imprisoned, the organized LDS Church outlawed, and federal agents on the prowl, many polygamists either abandoned the practice, fled the United States, or faced jail time themselves.268 Others chose to forsake polygamy altogether.269 In 1888, Wilford Woodruff succeeded John Taylor as President of the LDS Church. Woodruff, in contrast to Taylor, had a conciliatory attitude toward the government, and George Q. Cannon had likewise begun to see the necessity of capitulation. By April 1889, the First Presidency270 began to deny permission for plural marriages.271 By September 1890, Woodruff was prepared to abandon the practice altogether.272 On September 24, 1890, Woodruff met with Cannon, Joseph F. Smith, and three other members of the Council of the Twelve Apostles.273 Woodruff asked the Council to accept and abide by the Manifesto, the document he had penned that announced his intention to abandon polygamy.274 Cannon argued that Mormons were ulti- mately required to obey the nation's laws and that they had exhausted every means of salvaging polygamy for the LDS Church.275 Cannon declared him- self "willing to do the will of the Lord. And since the Prophet of God, after long season of prayer, had submitted this revelation as the will of the Lord, he was ready for the sacrifice."276 The next day, Woodruff wrote in his jour- nal: 265.

The United State[s] Gover[n]ment has taken a Stand &amp; passed Laws to destroy the Latter day Saints upon the Subje[c]t of poligamy [sic] .... And after praying to the Lord &amp; feeling inspired by his spirit I have issued the [Manifesto] which is sustained by My Councillors and the 12 Apostles.277 In reality, Cannon and Woodruff forced the Manifesto through the Council. Five of the apostles learned of the Manifesto only through its publication in newspapers to which it had been distributed.278 In pertinent part, the Mani- festo read: Inasmuch as laws have been enacted by Congress forbidding plural marriages, which laws have been pronounced constitutional by the court of the last resort, I hereby declare my intention to submit to those laws, and to use my influence with the members of the Church over which I preside to have them do like- wise.... And now I publicly declare that my advice to the Latter-day Saints is to refrain from contracting any marriage forbidden by the laws of the land.279 Gentiles correctly perceived that unless the LDS Church claimed an un- qualified, revelatory origin for the Manifesto, it would carry no weight against the 1843 and 1882 revelations. Consequently, federal officials and the notoriously anti-Mormon Salt Lake Tribune called for presentation of the Manifesto to and approval by the entire LDS Church body.280 The govern- ment refused to accept the Manifesto unless the First Presidency did so.281 Ultimately, the First Presidency again capitulated. They presented the Manifesto to a formal General Conference and claimed unanimous approval for it.282 In reality, many LDS Church members abstained from voting.283 Although some felt relief that the Church had finally agreed to abandon this troublesome practice, others felt tremendous grief at relinquishing a belief for which they had sacrificed so much.284 In the short term, gentiles re- warded Mormons for accepting the Manifesto. The LDS Church was rein- corporated and its property returned.285 In 1896, Utah achieved Brigham Young's goal of admission to the Union, an admission conditioned on a pro- vision in the Utah Constitution that Utah would never approve the practice of polygamy.286 277.

Many Mor- mons viewed the Manifesto as a purely political proclamation that was not morally binding.287 The Manifesto falsely claimed that plural marriages were no longer being performed.288 Also, it was ambiguous on the status of future cohabitation with spouses who had already entered into polygamy.289 Fi- nally, the First Presidency itself sent a thinly veiled message that what it said to the United States and its public advice to LDS Church members did not necessarily govern their private behavior.290 A surprising number of plural marriages-at least 262 documented between 1890 and 1910-occurred after publication of the Manifesto.29' Lorenzo Snow, who succeeded Woodruff as President of the LDS Church, was willing to draw a line between LDS Church policy and private activity: He personally submitted to the law of the land, but did not insist that LDS Church policy should govern private con- science, particularly in reference to cohabitation with families already in ex- istence.292 George Q. Cannon, still a member of the First Presidency, authorized a number of post-Manifesto marriages while Snow observed a tacit policy of neither asking about them nor forbidding them.293 Faced with this contradiction between public pronouncement and private action, most Mormons were confused about the official policy of the Church regarding polygamy.294 The American public was justifiably skeptical of Mormon assertions that the practice of polygamy had ceased.

Roberts was elected to Congress in the late 1890s, more than seven million people signed a petition demanding that he be denied his seat.295 The House of Rep- provide, by ordinance irrevocable without the consent of the United States and the people of said State-First.

For three years, the Senate held hearings that generated more than 3000 pages of printed testimony regarding the history, teleology, and culture of Mormonism.298 One commentator has called the Smoot hearings the most searching and bigoted congressional investigation of any religious body in American history.299 On the whole, LDS Church leaders performed badly during the Smoot hearings.

Taylor, were expelled from the Council of the Twelve Apostles.302 The Church's efforts ensured that the next generation of Mormons, those that came of age in the twentieth century, were firmly committed to monogamy.303 Polygamy, once the cornerstone of the Mormon faith-the mark of a proudly peculiar people-had finally been obliterated. 2. A practical change in Mormon theology. Devotees of plural marriage today consider themselves Mormon funda- mentalists-the faithful few who continue to practice the patriarchal order of marriage, following the divine mandate and everlasting covenant revealed through Joseph Smith and confirmed by later prophets.304 As such, they place themselves in a tiny minority. Critics of the LDS Church insist that polygamy is still central to Mormon theology. One such critic, Einar Ander- son, wrote, "The importance of Joseph Smith's polygamy revelation is such that it is not possible to properly evaluate the doctrines of this church without studying this teaching."305 This may be true of a few fundamentalists who 296.

Yet most Mormons do not fully appreciate the centrality of polygamy to early Mormon notions of salvation and the imminent establishment of Zion, God's holy city and people.307 If anything, Mormons now define themselves in opposition to polygamy rather than in conjunction with it. In my experience with Mormonism, polygamy is a historical issue-and a difficult one to explain away-rather than a moti- vating factor for belief. For decades, polygamy has been, as it continues to be, an offense meriting excommunication.308 Part of Mormon worship in- volves reiteration of a covenant to be faithful to one's single, lawful spouse. The Mormon focus on and enforcement of sexual abstinence, monogamy, and fidelity now set Mormons apart from their contemporary environment as surely as polygamy did a century ago. The purpose of this note is not to defend polygamy, but rather to high- light the very real effect suppression of religious practice has on belief. Af- ter decades of persecution, Mormons abandoned their notions of polygamy and Zion and instead turned to a radical program of assimilation. By 1922, Mormon philosopher and sociologist E.E. Ericksen could conclude that the repeated conflicts with non-Mormons during the nineteenth century had re- shaped Mormonism's theology and social aspirations.309 Historians have noted that once the LDS Church made this massive switch, Mormons epito- mized the progressive family ideals of the early twentieth century: They were monogamous, patriarchal, thrifty, and fertile.310 Moreover, the LDS Church actually joined forces with gentiles to sup- press polygamy. In 1918, Heber J. Grant, himself a former polygamist who once attempted to take a post-Manifesto wife, began an effort to uproot po- lygamy once and for all.31' In 1933, he issued a document reaffirming the Manifesto, reiterating LDS Church support for governmental actions against polygamy and distinguishing between polygamy and celestial or eternal mar- 306.

The Twelfth Article of Faith lists being subject to "kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates" and "obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law" as central tenets of Mormon theology.314 Accordingly, this forms the basis of an offi- cial resolution between the divine revelation of polygamy and a current practice very much at odds with it. In 1922, President Joseph Fielding Smith wrote that the antipolygamy legislation was a restriction of religious rights to which the LDS Church had been forced to submit. He maintained, however, that no amount of legislation could invalidate a "commandment given to them by revelation from the Lord."315 In 1937, despite his declared coopera- tion with the government, President Heber J. Grant could still say, "We never believed polygamy was wrong and never will .... [O]ne of the cardinal rules of the Church is to obey the law. So long as polygamy is illegal we our- selves will strictly enforce the law."316 It is difficult to measure how this division between belief and action im- pacted Mormon theology. The radical assimilation and accommodation ne- cessitated by the struggle over polygamy has had ramifications far beyond merely forsaking the practice of plural marriage. Kendall White has argued that repeated conflicts with society and the government secularized Mormon theology, turning it toward Protestant neoorthodoxy.317 Mormons are gener- ally regarded as a very conservative religious sect. To appreciate the signifi- cance of this turn to orthodoxy, one must understand the liberalism and op- timism at the core of Mormon theology. It completely rejects the notion of the helpless, depraved humanity presented by Calvinism in favor of the ra- 312. See id. at 342.

Considering the struggle the United States gov- ernment had in enforcing the antipolygamy laws, to claim that the LDS Church teaches its members to obey the law seems disingenuous. However, when one considers that Mormons firmly believed the antipolygamy laws to be unconstitutional and that they exhausted every legal resource in argu- ing this (itself an indication that they accepted the legitimacy of the American legal system), their commitment to the law seems more credible. 317.

At the same time, there is a strongly arational element to Mormon theology, an emphasis on the emotional and supernatural in the form of faith, personal revelation, and reliance on biblical and prophetic teachings.319 Thoughtful Mormons spend their lives navigating the uneasy tension be- tween the humanistic and the divine.320 According to White, Mormons now emphasize the importance of the divine at the expense of valuing the knowl- edge and capacity of the human. He attributes this movement, in large part, to the repeated clashes with secular authorities and social norms, the same clashes which forced the LDS Church to abandon polygamy. White acknowledges that during the middle part of the twentieth century, the LDS Church embarked on a worldwide quest for converts and that this may explain its conservative shift.321 However, worldwide acceptance fol- lowed conformity, not vice versa, particularly in the case of polygamy. In- terestingly, in recent decades Mormonism has once again become a distinc- tive religion based on its declared beliefs and indices of the commitment of its members, but this is more a reflection of a shift by other religions rather than a shift in Mormon theology. As other religions have relaxed their moral codes and theologies and have eased their efforts at proselytizing, the LDS Church has held firm on such issues.322 There are many explanations for Mormon assimilation and conservatism, but the suppression of polygamy still stands as an obvious and central cause.

The sharp divide between the Church's his- torical and current conceptions of both Zion and polygamy has unquestiona- bly impacted Mormon theology and belief. Rather than reaching independ- ent theological conclusions, the young Church was forced to accept laws in opposition to its then current beliefs and practices. The issue of polygamy has never reached a natural conclusion. A strange tension colors moder Mormon discussions of polygamy. Some Mormons view it as a huge mistake and would leave the Church rather than resume the practice. Some choose not to consider polygamy at all, ex- pressing the view that it is a historical issue and not one that reflects the cur- rent direction of the Church. Finally, some Mormons express their willing- ness to practice it should God once again command His people to do so, and others have left the fold of the official Mormon Church to do just that. I might fall somewhere between the latter two camps. To practice plural mar- riage would require me to uproot my deep-seated emotional preferences and conceptions of happiness in marriage; yet my religious convictions would require me to seriously consider the advice of a prophet asserting God's will regarding my eternal salvation and happiness. Polygamy is not central to my beliefs, nor is it a factor in my current reasons for belonging to the LDS Church. However, it was a significant part of the Church's past, and it re- mains a live theological issue, if only an academic one. As such, any thoughtful Mormon must consider it. 323.

April 1998] 1339</page><page sequence="46">STANFORD LA WREVIEW The presence of theological tension is certainly not an issue exclusive to Mormonism. However, the extent of the Supreme Court's contribution in heightening or diminishing this tension is probably unique in the case of Mormon polygamy. Both the Court and public sentiment irremediably im- pacted the practices and beliefs of an entire religious body. This is a legacy with which any devotee of the Free Exercise Clause-or general freedom of conscience and belief-must grapple. IV. IMPLICATIONS FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW OF CASES BURDENING RELIGIOUS ACTION The purpose of this note is to highlight the flaw at the heart of the judi- cial distinction between belief and action. Yet the argument is incomplete without some consideration of its ramifications. Despite the current state of Supreme Court free exercise jurisprudence,327 discrediting the belief-action distinction may encourage a return to a compelling interest standard capable of affording genuine protection to religious belief. I would advocate a return to the compelling interest test as presented in Sherbert.328 However, I offer the following refinement: Before the government may suppress or force any action that would violate the salvational beliefs of a particular religion, it must provide compelling proof that the practice harms an individual or soci- ety in a quantifiable way. In other words, as in the instance of polygamy, the religious practice cannot merely offend public morals or norms. It must cause sufficient damage to justify the state's abrogation of the Free Exercise Clause and the suppression of someone's religious beliefs. To prove a compelling interest in suppressing religious action or taking action that violates religious beliefs, the government should have to prove one of three things. In some way, it must show that the action (1) signifi- cantly infringes on another's right to exercise her civil liberties, (2) presents a meaningful threat to democratic liberty or social welfare rather than merely threatening or offending mainstream society's moral preferences, or (3) causes actual physical or psychological harm to another person. Under this test, for example, the government may certainly disregard religious justifica- tions for abrogating another's civil rights, attempting to overthrow demo- cratic ideals, destroying property, or subjecting children to malnutrition, sex- ual abuse, or medical neglect. To meet this compelling interest standard, the government could not rely on groundless assertions. For instance, it would not be sufficient to compare polygamy to human sacrifice and suttee. Rather, the state would have to prove that the religious practice inherently involved the verifiable abuse of 327. See text accompanying notes 64-93 supra. 328. See text accompanying notes 52-63 supra. 1340 [Vol. 50:1295</page><page sequence="47">MORMONPOLYGAMY women and children. In addition, should the government yield to parental concerns and sanction the abduction and "deprogramming" of Scientologists or Moonies, it would have to do more than assert that adult children had been brainwashed. The standard would require some antecedent proof that such individuals had not joined these groups of their own free will before the gov- ernment could abrogate their rights of religious observance and association. This expansion of free exercise protection has a familiar philosophical basis. We live in a polity founded on the notion that conscience and belief are free, that the law knows no heresy. Action is a central part of belief be- cause suppressing the former may well change the latter.329 Continuing to distinguish between belief and action-and allowing suppression of the lat- ter-violates our historical commitment to individual liberty.330 Further- more, this distinction favors one version of religion over another. Marci Hamilton has argued that the belief-action distinction reflects a tendency of the Supreme Court to define religion as an internal, purely intellectual expe- rience rather than as an experience that permeates the lives, choices, and ac- tions of its adherents.331 That the belief-action distinction exists is certainly understandable. From the inception of the Christian church, Paul and James argued over the merits of faith versus action. Paul wrote that "by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: .... Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law."332 James tersely retorted that "faith without works is dead."333 Surely this debate over belief and ac- tion is not confined to Christianity alone. In favoring belief, the Supreme Court prefers one side of a religious debate. Taking sides in this manner ex- ceeds the Court's institutional competence and violates our notions of civil freedom. In an expansive interpretation of the First Amendment, Professor Jesse H. Choper proffers a rule of legislative review and religious exemptions en- titled the "burdensome effect principle": 329. See text accompanying notes 131-158 supra. 330. Professor McConnell has stated that, at the time of the American founding, the term "free exercise" was intended to protect "religiously motivated conduct as well as belief."

April 1998] 1341</page><page sequence="48">STANFORD LA WREVIEW If government regulations of conduct that are generally applicable and enacted for secular/neutral purposes . . . conflict with action or inaction pursuant to the tenets of a particular religion, the Free Exercise Clause should be held to re- quire an exemption under the following circumstances: the claimant has suf- fered cognizable injury; the exemption does not violate the Establishment Clause; the exemption does not require the government to abandon its entire regulatory program; the individual's beliefs are sincerely held; violation of those beliefs entails extratemporal consequences; . . . and the government can- not demonstrate that denial of the exemption is necessary to a compelling inter- est.334 Choper's principle is open to debate, but it provides a useful starting point to evaluate an expanded compelling interest test. The main argument against strict scrutiny-and one emphasized by the Court in both Reynolds and Smith-is that requiring religious exemptions from neutral, generally applicable laws would negate the rule of law altogether and instigate social chaos.335 This is a specious argument. First, laws with little social benefit may impose serious burdens on religion.336 Yet if the laws have little social benefit, providing exemptions to them will probably not upset the entire so- cial order. Second, there are sufficient limiting factors to prevent wholesale social upheaval: Recognizing the religious rights of some does not require society to sanction religiously motivated conduct that sacrifices the civil rights of others. For example, when the physical safety of abortion doctors and patients conflict with religiously based attempts to stop abortions, pro- tecting the civil rights of the former justifies suppressing the religiously mo- tivated conduct of the latter.337 The Supreme Court has proved capable of protecting such civil rights. The Court, however, has not shown itself to be as capable of defending religious rights. Meaningful free exercise of religion requires that when the rights and well-being of individuals or society are not at stake, the beliefs of religionists be accommodated. The Constitution itself provides the first limiting factor to an expansive interpretation of the Free Exercise Clause: the Establishment Clause. The two clauses distinguish between an accommodation of religion and the af- firmative support of it. In other words, free exercise is a negative right. The fact that the government cannot compel or suppress religious action in no way requires certain governmental actions in support of religious practices. Under this interpretation of the Free Exercise Clause, the government would not have to recognize polygamy or give it equal status with monogamy. It simply could not criminalize or otherwise attempt to suppress the practice. 334. JESSE H.

Moreover, the government could still build a road on property that it owns339 because the people who wish to worship on it have no legal right to the land. Consequently, despite real spiritual suffering, the religionists in question cannot compel the government to grant them an affirmative relig- ious benefit. On the other hand, governmental entities could not suppress the use of sacramental wine or peyote, mandate education that hinders religious belief, or prohibit the wearing of religious clothing, symbols, or accessories because these activities generally do not cause quantifiable societal harm, nor do they require the government to confer a positive benefit. By strictly defining religion in the context of free exercise, one may im- pose a second limiting factor on the compelling interest test. Professor Cho- per sensibly notes that expansive interpretations of constitutional rights re- quire some limiting principles, lest exemptions protecting those rights be abused. The broader the protection in theory, the more restrictive it should be in application.340 Hence, he proposes limiting the definition of religion for free exercise purposes. To claim an exemption under the Free Exercise Clause, a religious adherent must show that the belief in question has salva- tional or extratemporal consequences, that violating this belief involves su- pernatural punishment.341 Unfortunately, this restriction would discriminate against those who merely have strong moral scruples. But to allow everyone an exemption from any law on the basis of moral scruples really would abro- gate the rule of law. Because moral scruples potentially have a more expan- sive scope than religious belief, they are less amenable to limiting princi- ples.342 Choper offers several other justifications for a salvational definition of religion. First, he notes that the religion clauses do favor religion over other systems of moral belief, thus justifying discrimination in favor of religious belief. To limit this preference, the definition of religion must have some substantive content.343 Second, Choper notes that religious imperatives hold unique sway over believers: "This makes it particularly cruel for the gov- 338.

Roy, 476 U.S. 693 (1986) (holding that the statutory requirement that a state agency utilize social security numbers in administering its programs does not violate the Free Exercise Clause). 339. See Lyng v. Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Ass'n, 485 U.S. 439 (1988) (holding that the First Amendment does not preclude the government from building a road or authorizing timber harvesting on land that it owns, but that has traditionally been used for worship). 340.

For example, it could have reached the same decision in City ofBoerne while still maintaining a vigorous free exercise doctrine. The issue in City of Boerne was whether or not a city had to grant a church an exemp- tion from historical district guidelines.346 The location of a particular church site is probably not a salvational issue. Therefore, the Court would not have had to apply strict scrutiny in declaring RFRA-the statutory protection un- der which the church brought suit-unconstitutional and could have still re- quired the church to submit to a neutral, generally applicable zoning law.347 One argument against defining "religion" for the purpose of free exercise exemptions is the difficulty of doing just that. Courts have traditionally avoided judging the content of religious beliefs,348 the centrality of particular religious beliefs to the person professing them,349 or whether the beliefs cor- respond to those of a particular religious organization.350 Consequently, some worry that unscrupulous individuals will profess religious beliefs to gain the benefits of a free exercise exemption. This fear, however, should not be dispositive. Courts are capable of recognizing false assertions of re- ligious beliefs and judging them accordingly. One district court denied a religious exemption for marijuana possession and trafficking to a man who 344. Id. at 74. 345. See id. at 78. 346. See City ofBoerne v. Flores, 117 S. Ct. 2157, 2160 (1997). 347. A case involving similar zoning issues is Western Presbyterian Church v. Board of Zoning Adjustment, 849 F. Supp. 77 (D.D.C. 1994). In this case, the church argued that feeding the homeless was a central requirement of its theology. See id. at 79. However, there was no doctrinal requirement that it feed the homeless from a particular building-merely that it feed the homeless. The free exercise doctrine proposed in this note would not require the government to forbid feeding the homeless altogether, but neither does it require the government to provide special zoning ex- emptions if there are other places where the church may reasonably carry out its mission in compli- ance with city laws. 348. See, e.g., United States v. Ballard, 322 U.S. 78, 86 (1944) ("[W]e do not agree that the truth or verity of respondents' religious doctrines or beliefs should have been submitted to the jury."). 349. See, e.g., Employment Div. v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 886-87 (1990) ("It is no more ap- propriate for judges to determine the 'centrality' of religious beliefs before applying a 'compelling interest' test in the free exercise field, than it would be for them to determine the 'importance' of ideas before applying the 'compelling interest' test in the free speech field."). 350. See, e.g., Frazee v. Illinois Dep't of Employment Sec., 489 U.S. 829, 834 (1989) ("[W]e reject the notion that to claim protection of the Free Exercise Clause, one must be responding to the commands of a particular religious organization."). 1344 [Vol. 50:1295</page><page sequence="51">MORMON POLYGAMY claimed to be a Reverend of the Church of Marijuana.351 The court offered the following explanation: While it is difficult for the courts to establish precise standards by which the bona fides of a religion may be judged, such difficulties have proved to be no hindrance to denials of First Amendment protection to so-called religions which tend to mock established institutions and are obviously shams and absurdities and whose members are patently devoid of religious sincerity.352 After considering such factors as metaphysical beliefs, the moral and ethical system, teleology, and the accouterments of religion-including holy teach- ers, important writings, and ceremony and ritual-the court concluded that the Church of Marijuana was in fact a sham and denied it free exercise pro- tection.353 Another argument against defining religion for the purpose of free exer- cise exemptions is that people will join a bona fide religion for insincere or opportunistic purposes. For instance, the court in Potter posited that an ex- emption for polygamy would lead to "false assertion[s] of religious motiva- tion for physical gratification."354 Frankly, I find this argument less than convincing. If a man wants to satisfy his libido, he can surely find easier ways of doing so than entering into a formal relationship that will expose him to significant social censure. Despite the centrality of polygamy to early Mormon theology, it seems unlikely that it was a motivating factor behind most conversions, particularly given the persecutions its practitioners suf- fered. Likewise, an exemption for peyote would probably not inspire drug addicts to join the Native American Church. As noted by Justice Blackmun in his Smith dissent, the carefully circumscribed use of peyote "is far re- moved from the irresponsible and unrestricted recreational use of unlawful drugs."355 Moreover, during Prohibition, Congress enacted a statutory ex- emption for the use of wine for Eucharist.356 I would be surprised to learn that this boosted attendance at the local Catholic mass. Active religious ob- servance generally imposes sufficient costs to counter any incentives offered by particular exemptions.357 Even if exemptions provide some motivation to join a particular religion, the impact would likely be minimal. By definition, minority and/or marginal religions are relatively small in number. They also have less political clout 351. See United States v. Meyers, 906 F. Supp. 1494 (1995). 352.

Consequently, they have a greater need for the constitutional protections of the Free Exercise Clause, as they are less able to influence legislation that might negatively impact them. Accordingly, pro- viding minority religions with certain exemptions is not likely to have a widespread impact on the general population. A final, admittedly troublesome, argument against a strong free exercise doctrine is that it could actually encourage rather than discourage belief- potentially a violation of the Establishment Clause. This quandary does not have a clear answer. Either religionists must conform to laws or enjoy an exemption. This means that the government, purposefully or not, will either discourage belief or encourage it. There are strong arguments that the Con- stitution, although a secular, humanistic document, nonetheless favors indi- vidual belief and the "freedom to pursue (or not to choose) a religious faith."358 As long as the government does not proscribe particular beliefs, it seems entirely legitimate and within the reading of the religion clauses for the government to favor belief in general. CONCLUSION Given the current climate of constitutional jurisprudence, I fully appreci- ate the improbability of an expansion of free exercise protections. Nonethe- less, I hope that highlighting the flaws at the root of the belief-action distinc- tion will promote discussion in furtherance of this end. Many have attacked the belief-action distinction and others have discussed the centrality of action to religious belief, but to my knowledge no one has highlighted how gov- ernmental implementation of the belief-action doctrine has fundamentally changed religious belief. Consequently, I have argued that suppression of religious practice, under the guise of the Smith neutrality principle, actually changes belief and that this comes dangerously close to violating the Free Exercise Clause. This is particularly true for churches that place as much or greater emphasis on ac- tion as on faith. For them, to act is to believe. The United States Supreme Court's current separation of belief and ac- tion inadequately protects the free exercise of religion, particularly in light of the absolute protection supposedly given to belief. Adequate protection of both religious belief and action requires the reinstatement of a strict scrutiny standard where government regulations impose a significant burden on cen- tral religious practices, even if those regulations are facially neutral ones. To prevent majoritarian biases against minority religions, I propose that the gov- ernment can only meet the compelling interest test when it affirmatively demonstrates significant threats to individual or democratic liberties.

Rather, these exemptions would merely prevent the government from suppressing such practices. In other words, this is not an argument for posi- tive rights, but rather for the right of religionists to be left alone. As a believer, I can attest that religious life is a far from costless system. Nonetheless, I recognize that all choices entail some cost, and it is legitimate for religious choices to bear a cost as well. It is not, however, legitimate for religious choices to bear a disproportionate cost, particularly when the cost is the suppression of religious belief and action. Current tensions within Mor- mon theology may no longer be a pressing concern of free exercise jurispru- dence, but governmental interference that imposes similar tensions on other religions should be. In the absence of a natural evolution, I am curious as to what contemporary Mormonism would have to say regarding polygamy and why it would say so. Because of past governmental interference, this is not an answerable question. When I step back from the morass of competing free exercise tests, I feel both pride in and compassion for my pioneer ancestors. Committed to the rule of law myself, I nevertheless admire the conviction that caused them to push the law to its limits and their ultimate resilience in submitting to it. I have a much greater understanding than I once did for what that surrender cost them. A verse of an old Mormon hymn reads: We'll find the place which God for us prepared, Far away in the West, Where none shall come to hurt or make afraid; There the Saints will be blessed. We'll make the air with music ring, Shout praises to our God and King; Above the rest, these words we'll tell-all is well, all is well.359 The struggle over polygamy negated the optimism and hope that the Latter- day Saints felt in journeying to Utah. Nonetheless, they survived and con- tinue to praise their God. Perhaps retelling the history of their persecution will discourage government oppression of other religious sects, through a heightened understanding of the inseparable relation between belief and ac- tion. Then, indeed, would much be well. 359. William Clayton, Come, Come Ye Saints, HYMNS OF THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS 30 (1985). April 1998] 1347</page></plain_text>
