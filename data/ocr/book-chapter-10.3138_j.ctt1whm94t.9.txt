The new and evolving post-totalitarian East Central European iden- tity2 exemplifies one such contested site, which is being continuously  redefined in a geopolitically ambivalent and fluid space of shifting bor- ders. The mythologies inherent in the geopolitical spaces of the region,  including urban spaces, are significant in that they form cultural topoi,  become important ideological constructs, inspire narratives of nostal- gia, and contribute to the reimaginings and retellings of history. In the context of European history, East Central Europe is one of  those peripheral regions whose stories, according to Norman Davies,  “historians tend to forget” (Vanished Kingdoms, dedication). These geo- politically peripheral spaces and border territories, while often over- looked in favour of metropolitan spaces, are indicative of the complex  multi-vectorial political and cultural processes that come to shape their  communities as a result of transfer between multiple empires. More  specifically, cities become important witnesses of history in that they  bear material change (shifts in cultural architectonics, physical destruc- tion and rebuilding, selective preservation) but also become symbolic,  discursive constructs that create hypertextual ontologies: the kind of  imaginary cities that exist in literary discourses, cultural representa- tions, and spaces of memory. Such constructs and representations  </page> <page sequence="4"> 122 Irene Sywenky often engage in ideologically driven archaeologies of the national, the  regional, and the local, thus participating in larger narratives of his- tory and collective identity. The region bears witness to many cities’  sociopolitical and cultural transformations, which are then nostalgi- cally revisited and reimagined through literary (re)constructions: Sán- dor Márai’s Kassa/Košice, Chesław Miłosz’s Wilno/Vilnius, Günter  Grass’s Danzig and Pawel Huelle’s/Stefan Chwin’s Gdańsk, and Elias  Canetti’s Plovdiv, to name a few. The former Galician city of Lemberg/Lwów/Lvov/Lviv, which  belongs to this sort of geopolitically ambivalent space, has recently been  the object of several studies in urban history and urban culture, for it is  a city whose multiple identities have been shaped by various histori- cal forces as well as by several languages and cultures, some receding,  some moving to the foreground over the centuries (Czaplicka, Davies,  Grabowicz, Hrytsak and Susak, Narvselius). In the course of its history  of imperial transfers, the city has been part of various peripheral spaces  as zones of political, economic, and cultural gravitation towards a suc- cession of capital centres: Vienna, Warsaw, Moscow, and, most recently,  Kyiv (the capital of independent Ukraine). This chapter focuses on the  way Lviv’s historical profile has been constructed through post–Second  World War and post-1989 literary narratives – poetic and essayistic – in  order to foreground its alterity, its fundamentally off-centric quality,  and its condition of unhomeliness, which reflects multiple geopoliti- cal displacements and “extra-territorial and cross-cultural initiation[s]”  (Bhabha 9). Comparable to Joseph Cary’s project of a “ghost story”  about the “ghost town” of Trieste, another former periphery of the  Habsburg Empire, writing Lviv’s polyglot history means uncovering  narrative palimpsests, retracing elusive ghost memories, and “remem- bering a past known almost exclusively through books” (10). Exam- ining the construction of literary Lviv in the writings of some of the  key authors who have defined that city’s literary landscape – Józef Wit- tlin, Stanisław Lem, Zbigniew Herbert, Adam Zagajewski, and Iurii  Andrukhovych – I contend that the historically ongoing process of  negotiating Lviv’s geopolitical profile along the East/West and centre/ periphery continuum has positioned this city’s evolving identity as a  fluid signifying space, a cartographic game, and a locus of the nostalgic  desire for an elusive, historically displaced “home.” The transhistorical space of Lemberg/Lwów/Lviv has been defined  by transculturation, continuous border-crossing, colliding affinities  and divisions, and cultural pluricentrism. As Caryl Emerson once  contended, </page> <page sequence="5"> Spaces of Unhomeliness 123 in Eastern Europe, one town would commonly speak several native  languages, belong to two or three empires in the course of a single  generation, and assume most of its residents to be hybrids who carried the  dividing-lines of nationality within their selves. [...] Exile, displacement,  multi-languagedness, heteroglossia, outsideness to oneself and thus  a taste for irony, the constant crossing of borders and the absence of a  tranquil, organic, homogenized center that belongs to you alone: all these  Bakhtinian virtues and prerequisites for genuine dialogue have long been  endemic to Central Europe. (203–4) Emerson’s reflection on Eastern and Central Europe in the context of  the conditions of border-crossing, decentredness, and Bakhtinian dia- logism is a fitting commentary on the city of Lviv. Today’s western Ukrainian city of Leopolis, Lemberg, Lwów, Львов  (Lvov), and Львiв (Lviv) has a centuries-long history of colonial trans- fers: from the Kingdom of Poland (14–18th c.), to the Austro-Hun- garian Empire (1772–1918), to the Second Polish Republic (1918–39),  to the Soviet Union (1939–91). Since the thirteenth century, the city at  various times has been home to a wide range of cultural communities:  Ruthenians (Ukrainians), Poles, Armenians, Jews, Tatars, Germans, and  Hungarians, to name a few. Today’s Lviv – Lemberg, in its German- ized version – became in 1772 the capital of the Kingdom of Galicia and  Lodomeria, a Crown land of the House of Habsburg. Austro-Hungarian  Lemberg was mostly Ruthenian (old Ukrainian), Polish, and Jewish,  with German being the language of government. Thus in Austrian  Galicia the scholarly and sacred languages of Latin, Old Church Sla- vonic, Old Armenian, and Hebrew were complemented by secular Pol- ish, Ruthenian, Yiddish, and German, and being fluent in three or four  languages was not uncommon (Davies 460–1). Although initially the  Austrian authorities pursued a “policy of steady linguistic German- ization,” the city was re-Polonized with the introduction of municipal  autonomy in 1870, when Polish became the official administrative lan- guage. Owing to its development under Austro-Hungarian rule, by the  end of the nineteenth century the city was included in major European  tourist guides (459, 470). Largely untouched by the devastation of the Second World War, Lviv  has retained the street plan and architecture of a Central European city,  including its prominent late-medieval marketplace. This is a testimony  to the city’s administrative sovereignty and economic privileges under  the Magdeburg Law, which encouraged trade and thereby created  favourable conditions for the coexistence of many ethnic communities.  </page> <page sequence="6"> 124 Irene Sywenky The years of development under Habsburg rule further solidified  Lviv’s Central European feel. Soviet urban planning had little signifi- cant impact on the city’s historic core; it was left almost untouched by  Soviet architectural modernization. The same cannot be said about the  city’s demographics. The multicultural image of today’s Lviv, a result  of numerous border shifts and geopolitical changes, masks many cen- turies of a troubled past, often marked by ethnic conflicts, political  strife, mass violence, and displacement. In the aftermath of the Second  World War and the redrawing of Poland’s borders, Lviv lost between  80 and 90 per cent of its population due to “the decimation of the Jews,  the deportation of the Poles, as well as the persecution and exile of  indigenous Ukrainians” (Czaplicka 2005, 15, 18; see also Hrytsak and  Susak). This did irreparable damage to the pluri-ethnic composition of  the city. Over the following decades, the construction of a monologic  narrative of a Soviet Ukrainian city almost obliterated the Austrian cul- tural legacy along with memories of the Jewish and Polish historical  presence. Lviv’s historical identity came to be defined by its geopolitical mar- ginality. Although the capital of the Austro-Hungarian province of  Galicia, it was at the same time part of the economically and cultur- ally disadvantaged fringes of the empire. It was also peripheral as part  of the Polish and Soviet territories, and it remains so within today’s  independent Ukraine, where it is sometimes referred to as a major city  in or the centre of western Ukraine, which itself is a regional designa- tion. An “(un)usual borderline city” (Narvselius 57), Lviv likely owes  its rich narrative memory precisely to the ambivalence and complex- ity of its geopolitical identity and the many historical displacements  that have shaped its past and present communities; such displacements  and traumas require a process of looking back, of retelling one’s experi- ence and creating a discursive network/community of similar expe- riences, the kind of Lviv that belongs to different cultural/national/ political users. With regard to post-authoritarian cities, Ruble refers to  the emergence of “parallel historiograph[ies]” (10) – narrative retellings  that claim the city’s past through different stories/histories; such poly- phonic spaces of memory in the context of the city are inherently linked  to its material landmarks and structures, thus creating spaces of what  is termed “urban memory.” The concept of urban memory is suscep- tible to the pitfalls of anthropomorphism; more commonly, however, it  “indicates the city as a physical landscape and collection of objects and  practices that enable recollections of the past” (Crinson xii). The organic  </page> <page sequence="7"> Spaces of Unhomeliness 125 symbiosis of spatiality and temporality in the urban imaginary often  means that different, temporally incompatible things are juxtaposed in  one place, “memories of what there was before, imagined alternatives  to what there is. The strong marks of present space merge in the imagi- nary with traces of the past, erasures, losses, and heterotopias” (Huys- sen 7). These intersections of the spatial and the temporal, which are  at the heart of the Lwów/Lviv narratives examined below, constitute  heterotopic structures that, according to Foucault, are “outside of all  places” (4), even though they have a concrete, physical location in real- ity. Akin to “slices in time,” they are “heterochronies,” “counter-sites”  (3–6), of the sort that are endemic to all human groups both as spaces  of the collective imaginary and as sites of resistance (even as a way of  reading and interpreting official, “real” places). Foucault privileged a  society with many heterotopias “not only because these places affirm  difference through its multiple interpretations, but also as a means of  escape from authoritarianism and repression” (Boedeltje 5). Literary  representations of urban space as a performative space of history con- stitute heterotopias of a divergent multiplicity of histories, memories,  and imaginations, which in turn project different nostalgias and desires. This chapter is structured around the two most recent historical  shifts that have changed the cultural and geopolitical profile of the city:  Lviv’s transfer from Poland to the Soviet Union (following the region’s  annexation by Soviet forces in 1939); and its social transformation and  reorientation towards the cultural and geopolitical paradigm of Central  Europe after the collapse of the Eastern Bloc. The first shift was accom- panied by a major change in the city’s demographics, with an almost  complete disappearance of the Jewish population and the mass expul- sion of the Polish population westward (a mass displacement similar  to the one along the German–Polish border). The second shift has been  marked by a retrospective gaze back to the past, towards recovering the  city’s identity and history, which had been repressed for decades. The  narratives from the Polish and Ukrainian sides, which also engage –  implicitly or explicitly – with the city’s Central European heritage,  are stories that “speak” to each other, not only intertextually but also  transhistorically, by contributing to a common heterotopic space, the  “other” Lwów/Lviv, the city of the reimagined past. While Lviv’s urban culture has drawn some academic attention, the  literary history/ies of the city have not been examined. Considering  that Lviv has always been at the periphery of all empires – that it has  always been slightly off the map, and aware of its own marginality – it  </page> <page sequence="8"> 126 Irene Sywenky has attracted a remarkable amount of literary attention. The most nota- ble literary representations of Polish Lwów3 after the Second World  War, which constitute nostalgic returns to the “lost” city, include Józef  Wittlin’s Mój Lwów (My Lwów) and Stanisław Lem’s Wysoki Zamek  (Highcastle: A Remembrance), but most importantly the poetic and  essayistic writings of Zbigniew Herbert and Adam Zagajewski, two  prominent, internationally acclaimed Polish poets whose love affair  with the city turned into a lifelong presence haunting their entire oeu- vre. These names are well known both in the canon of Polish literature  and internationally, yet there has been little academic discussion of  their contributions to the collective poetic narrative of the city. These  retrospective re-creations of Lwów are significant on several levels: as  selective (re)constructions of the city, as selective presences/highlights  versus absences/silences, and as specific memories and the emotional  landscapes those memories create and perpetuate. Józef Wittlin, a Jewish-Polish translator and writer, spent only part of  his life in Lwów, but this connection inspired a strongly poetic and sen- timental tribute, Mój Lwów (1946), which explores Wittlin’s emotional  connection to the city and his youth. In the words of the author, “it’s  not Lwów we long for after years of separation, it’s ourselves in Lwów  we long after” (7).4 In this way he explicitly acknowledges that his nar- rative is a journey of nostalgia into an imagined, non-existent Lwów,  the city that resides in his long-faded memories. Although Wittlin’s  account of the city’s history does not fail to mention its darker, more  violent memories (e.g., the Polish–Ukrainian war of 1818–19 and the  massacre of Lwów’s Jews in 1941), he chooses to construct primarily a  leisurely, cultured urban space in which the Austro-Hungarian legacy  is foregrounded. He leads the reader through some of the city’s architec- tural landmarks and social spaces that owe much to Austrian cultural  influence and to Austria’s program of urban modernization in Galicia;  he also makes a point of dwelling on some of the better-known – and  supported in popular culture – connections between Lemberg/Lwów  and Austrian metropolitan culture. In particular, he reminds the reader  that Lemberg is associated with the professional life of Mozart’s son  (who worked there as a tutor and a choir conductor) and with the name  of Leopold von Sacher-Masoch; although Sacher-Masoch’s connection  to the city was rather tangential (he was born in Lemberg and spent  his childhood there), in many of his writings he explored Galician cul- ture.5 These links to Austrian and European culture are discussed with  the pride of someone who claims rightful “ownership” of the city. For  </page> <page sequence="9"> Spaces of Unhomeliness 127 Wittlin, his Lwów is both a fantasy and a reality, a material existence  on which his subjectivity has been superimposed but which retains a  form of truth: “We [...] have to acknowledge every image of the world,  reflected in our memory, as a reality. The reality of our soul. And then  it will not matter whether Lwów was really the way we remember it  here or whether it was different” (8).6 Although his essay reads like  an excursion to a smaller interwar Central European city that can be  appreciated by any reader, his intimate narrative tone constructs a spe- cific audience; his story is implicitly addressed to those who know the  city and who share in the emotional and cultural landscape of Lwów’s  urban space. Various references to its topography, which he uses as  memory tags, hail the readers who will recognize and appreciate these  references. The frequent use of the first person plural is meant to create  a sense of collectivity based on belonging to the city through the inti- mate knowledge of its cultural code, which can be acquired only by liv- ing in it. For all its exclusivity, Wittlin’s account creates a transhistorical  and transcultural Lwów (he writes as a Pole and a Jew) that transcends  time and space (he published the piece after moving to New York) and  constructs a discursive space of the city that implicitly invites a dia- logue with his literary successors. Stanisław Lem’s autobiographical coming-of-age story Wysoki Zamek  (1966) is set in the Lwów of his childhood and continues the theme of  the “lost” city, albeit in a much subtler way. Although Lem is known  primarily as an author of science fiction, his nostalgic memoir of the  interbellum Polish Lwów gained immediate critical acclaim. In this  autobiographical piece, Lem meditates on the elusive and vulnerable  memory of childhood, but also on the impact that the early environ- ment has on one’s formative years and later life. Furthermore, Lem  writes history in an unobtrusive way: the city and the sociopolitical con- text are veiled by the more vivid details of his parents’ apartment, their  library, and his years at the Gymnasium. Almost intentionally avoiding  the broader context of the 1930s, the writer focuses on the microcosm of  his memory and his mind. The story of his childhood, however, is also  a story of his Lwów, a memento of a world that, by the time he wrote,  was no more. Except for the High Castle, a historic landmark in the city,  Lem does not dwell on specific locations; compared to Wittlin’s, his lit- erary topography of Lwów is rather underdone, perhaps intentionally  so. In the inner world of his childhood and youth, the unity of his self  and the city (i.e., the apartment, the street, the school, the neighbour- hood) is organic; no explicit tours and explanations are necessary; his  </page> <page sequence="10"> 128 Irene Sywenky surroundings are an extension of himself, expanding and growing with  his growing world. Wysoki Zamek is an introspective narrative; from the  perspective of the 1960s, by which time he was living in Polish Kraków,  having left Lwów at the end of the war, Lem’s reflections on his early  inclination towards solitude are also retrospective reflections on the  loss and loneliness inherent in the exilic condition. By reaching back to  memories of his younger years he also reaches out to a city that no lon- ger exists. Thus the title of the memoir refers to the ruins of the oldest  structure of the city; it is both the geographical point of its origin and its  foundational myth, its symbolic point of reference. Lem’s titular refer- ence foregrounds the role of this landmark in the symbolic space of the  city and in the symbolic space of his memory, while also pointing to the  role of the city itself as the foundational narrative of his life. Zbigniew Herbert, an exilic poet with homes in many places, embod- ies Central European ethnic complexity as well as mobility between  the metropolitan regions and the peripheries of the former Austro- Hungarian empire. He was a Pole of some Austrian heritage (whose  ancestors moved to Lemberg from Vienna and Graz) as well as a lin- eage of Polonized Armenians (Herbert, Collected Poems 585). He was a  quintessentially nomadic figure, both culturally and politically, but at  the heart of his unsettledness and lack of belonging had always been  his exile from Lwów, the city of his childhood and youth. Having been  forced to relocate to the post-Yalta, geopolitically reconfigured Poland,  and having escaped the Soviet Union, Herbert nonetheless ended up  in a country under a socialist totalitarian regime. With a brief period  of political thaw in 1956 and the publication of his critically acclaimed  debut collection, the borders of Europe were open for him not only to  travel, but also to settle for various periods of time in Germany, Aus- tria, Italy, and France. According to the younger poet and fellow-migrant Adam Zagajew- ski, Herbert belonged to “those who had been disinherited from Lvov,7  cut to the heart by the loss of that extraordinary city” (Defence of Ardor  107). The theme of that loss pervades Herbert’s poetry, appearing in the  first collections and resurfacing well into the 1990s, the last years of his  life. It is then, for example in the poem “Time,” that he acknowledges  living “in several times like an insect in amber” (Collected Poems 558),  simultaneously existing in past and present, never quite leaving the  space of remembrance. Herbert’s nostalgic poetic relationship with Lwów indicates the  depth of his connection to the city and the feeling of irreparable loss left  </page> <page sequence="11"> Spaces of Unhomeliness 129 after his departure for western Poland. In his 1957 collection, the poem  “Never of You” (“Nigdy o tobie”) sets the tone for his ongoing intimate  meditation on the elusive reality of his childhood and the city’s haunt- ing presence in his memory: “I never have the courage to speak of you”  (Collected Poems 82).8 The second-person addressee of Herbert’s poem  (the actual city) creates an illusion of immediacy and reality while also  underscoring Herbert’s common themes – the unreliability of language,  the infinite deferral of meaning, and flawed, dreamlike memories. He  is always aware that his reconstruction of the city is merely a fleeting  image, subjective, elusive, and already slipping through his fingers,  and that he can “use only a cruelly common litany of words” (82).9  Reflecting on Herbert’s language of Lwów, Zagajewski comments that  Herbert “never called [it] by name in his poems, he spoke of the ‘city’  as if the name itself was too painful, as if all other cities – and he knew  so many – required names, and only this one city could get by just fine  without one” (Defence of Ardor, 108). The topos of the city – an anonymous city – becomes a presence of  a haunting memory, an attempt to recover the past and seek mean- ing in a palimpsest of layers of unreality. Unlike Wittlin’s assertively  possessive Mój Lwów, with its abundance of specific topographic refer- ences and vividly material urban reality, Herbert’s poem “My City”  (“Moje miasto”) is about absence, abandonment, and the impossibility  of regaining the fragile connection with the place of his birth: as his  “fallible memory draws up / the map of a city” (Collected Poems 104)10  in a dream-like state, he sees only fragments and unclear images that  inevitably come to an end. In his blurry vision of the inaccessible past,  the poet acknowledges only one moment of certainty – his own begin- ning, which is inextricably connected to the city whose loss he mourns:  “in the end a stone is left / upon which I was born” (Collected Poems  105).11 The poignant concluding verse of the poem, stark in its unpre- tentious simplicity, speaks of non-belonging and exclusion: “every  night / I stand barefoot / before the locked gate / of my city” (105).12  The trope of the (locked) gate as a threshold, a borderline between past  and present, imagination and reality, a liminal space of transition and  change, also echoes in the texts discussed below. The poem “Report from a Besieged City” (“Raport z oblężonego mia- sta,” 1983) is both a commentary on the effects of wartime and a reflec- tion on transience and loss. The reference to the city ruins, which can  be read both literally and metaphorically, constructs an epistemic space  of archaeology, a process of removing layers from the meaning. Ruins/ </page> <page sequence="12"> 130 Irene Sywenky fragments/gaps, as flawed and unreliable as they are, become a new  text and the only possible way of connecting and understanding: “we  were left only the place and an attachment to the place / we govern  ruins of temples, ghosts of gardens and houses” (Collected Poems 416).13  Continuity rests in memory and in articulating the emotional legacy that  comes with memory; in speaking of the survivor who, in his exilic life,  will always have the city inside him, the poet certainly speaks of himself. In the poem “In the City” (1998), written during his last years, Her- bert bids farewell to “the borderland city [he]’ll never see again” (Col- lected Poems 551). “Seeing” here probably refers to the space of memory  and imagination rather than to an actual visit (after his forced reloca- tion from Lwów/Lvov in 1945, he visited the city only once, in the  1990s). The poet reiterates the importance of memory but also the con- structed nature of his Lwów, a city “which doesn’t exist on any map /  of the world” and where “there’s bread giving lifelong / nourishment  black as an exile’s fate” (551). It is also in the last collection – in a rare  case where Herbert chooses to identify the city (i.e., he actually refers  to Lwów) – that there is presence of history. In “High Castle,” the poet  discusses Herbert’s visit to Lwów (at the time already officially Lviv)  and references the city’s central landmark but also engages intertextu- ally with Lem’s text, thus implicitly establishing an affinity between  these two exilic figures. While “High Castle” identifies the city’s origins  in Ruthenian history, Herbert also refers to Józef Kapuściński and Teo- fil Wiśniowski, leaders of the Polish-Galician insurrection, who were  executed by the Austro-Hungarian authorities in 1847 in the vicinity  of the castle’s ruins. While bringing together – wittingly or unwit- tingly – Ruthenian/Ukrainian and Polish forces in the city’s history, the  poet remains nonetheless in the shadow of the Austro-Hungarian and  Soviet empires. Through its theme of loss, Herbert’s poetry constructs  a complex historical profile of the city that does not belong to anyone –  perhaps least of all to him. This anxiety of not belonging also relates  to the idea of Central Europe. Although Herbert does not discuss the  concept extensively, in the poem “Mitteleuropa” he treats this anxiety  both with a touch of cynicism and with disillusionment, as a “painted  toy of a child / an old man’s nostalgic dream” (485). Always a political  construct and a myth, beginning with its roots in German influence, the  idea of Central Europe remained so, albeit with new variations, in the  aftermath of the Eastern Bloc. Adam Zagajewski’s narrative of Lwów appears to have many  affinities with Herbert’s loss and nostalgia, yet it is very different: his  </page> <page sequence="13"> Spaces of Unhomeliness 131 construction of the city is not based on his personal memories. The  poet, translator, and essayist was born in Polish Lwów in 1945, but his  family left when he was only four months old. Zagajewski never had  any childhood memories of the city, and his personal encounter with  post-Soviet Lviv did not take place until the 1990s. His imagined and  imaginary Lwów was shaped by the city’s pervasive presence in his  parents’ and grandparents’ lives in the small town of Gliwice in west- ern Poland, where they had resettled. Zagajewski’s relationship with  the city he never knew – yet knew so intimately – is conditioned by its  simultaneous absence and presence, its unreality, and its almost mytho- logical nature as sustained by his family’s stories. His longing for the  city he had not experienced for most of his life and the sense of unroot- edness associated with his parents’ forced expatriation came to define  much of his writing, especially his non-fiction prose. Having grown up  with an awareness of cross-cultural influences and bilingualism in his  family (e.g., his grandfather was fluent in German), Zagajewski intro- duced Lwów in his writings both as a space of personal loss and as a  geopolitical and cultural space of in-betweenness, a meeting point of  differences; historically both a capital and a periphery, it favourably  combined Western European cultural influences with an “openness to  Eastern emanations (although the East was certainly less obvious here  than in Wilno or even Warsaw)” (Defence of Ardor 3).  For Zagajewski, living in cultural and geopolitical interstices fostered  in him a strong sense of absence of home. In his essay “Two Cities”  (“Dwa miasta”), he reflects on his lifelong state of “unhomeliness”  (in Homi Bhabha’s terms): “If people are divided into the settlers, the  emigrants, and the homeless, then I certainly belong to the third cat- egory” (Zagajewski, Two Cities 3).14 His condition of unhomeliness is  something that can be understood only in a metaphorical sense, as a  feeling that took root in him through the stories his parents and grand- parents had told him since childhood. Those stories instilled in him a  sense of unbelonging in provincial Gliwice and a pervasive desire for  the “other” city. He learned early on that his parents’ life had been split  in two, and for many years afterwards they told him stories about the  beautiful city they had to leave. Always aware of the trauma of his par- ents’ displacement, and always living that same displacement through  their many storytellings, he was gradually immersed in the world of  the ghost city whose presence was so constant in his family’s daily life:  “I walked the streets of Gliwice with my grandfather [...] but in fact we  were strolling two separate cities. [...] I was absolutely certain that [...]  </page> <page sequence="14"> 132 Irene Sywenky I was where I really was. My grandfather, however, despite his walk- ing right next to me, was in Lvov. I walked the streets of Gliwice, he the  streets of Lvov” (Two Cities 16–17).15 In the poem “Strange Towns” (quoted in this chapter’s epigraph),  Zagajewski talks about the allure of unknown, unfamiliar urban  spaces; written by a well-travelled author, this poem can be read at its  surface level. However, the strangest and most foreign city for him has  remained the Lwów of his parents’ and grandparents’ prewar lives.  In an essay with the telling title “Should We Visit Sacred Places?,” he  describes his journey to the most important “strange town” of his life  when he is invited to a conference in Lviv in independent post-Soviet  Ukraine, a conference ironically dedicated to the issues of the Polish–  Ukrainian border, international collaboration, and European integra- tion. The emotional impact of being in the city for the first time is  enhanced by the crucial moment of collision between the constructed,  imagined world of his parents’ Lwów and the real place: I had before me a city that was both absolutely foreign and completely  familiar, forgotten, forsaken, surrendered, mourned, bullet-ridden, but  still truly existing, vividly and persuasively illuminated, solid, living [...].  You shouldn’t visit mythic places, there’s no way to see them, catch them,  seize them. They’re easy to recognize, but what then? What’s to be done?  After a long moment, I capitulated and reached for my Japanese camera  in order to eternalize the city’s astonishing, early morning performance.  (Defense of Ardor 169) “Seizing” images of the city on camera creates an illusion of capturing  its fluidity along some seemingly fixed parameters, stabilizing it, even  if within the conventional geometry of the photographic frame. How- ever, Zagajewski’s discourse about Lwów/Lviv is full of irreconcilable  binary opposites and paradoxes: “I found myself in my city, which  wasn’t mine, about which I knew next to nothing, in a foreign city,  about which I knew a good deal” (170). This impossibility of fixing the  city in any specific set of terms – historical, cultural, national – informs  the poet’s stroll along its streets. Zagajewski walks in the Lwów of his  parents’ memories guided by a prewar city map given to him by his  father, “without taking the new, Ukrainian onomastics too seriously”  (171–2). His Lwów is a non-existing city of vanished Polish street  names, of even older landmarks such as Kajzerwald and Ossolineum,  the legacy of the Austrian imperial era. As he peels away the layers  </page> <page sequence="15"> Spaces of Unhomeliness 133 of twentieth-century history, he ponders that somewhere in western  Poland, along the German–Polish corridor, German tourists may be  strolling through the equally unreal cities of Gdańsk or Wrocław, reliv- ing their own and their parents’ dreams of prewar Danzig and Bre- slau, with the new life in these cities appearing “imperfect, accidental,  provisional, and finally superfluous” (172). Zagajewski admits that his  nostalgic quest for Lwów, fostered by his family’s intergenerational sto- ries and memories, translates into a “search for something that doesn’t  exist, something that may never have existed” (172), a symbolic struc- ture that has strong emotional roots, a hope for an “original” home that  can never be realized. Herbert’s and Zagajewski’s writings about Lviv are deeply per- sonal and intimate reflections. They also constitute part of the larger  discourse of collective memory in Central Europe – specifically, the  memory of the twentieth-century mass displacements. On yet another  level, these narratives participate in the complex geopolitical play that  followed Poland’s loss of its eastern territories after the Second World  War. These discursive re-creations of the city’s historical past produce  alternative ontological constructs, such as Austrian Lemberg or Polish  Lwów, that may or may not have any real connection with the present- day city; they serve, however, to foster and perpetuate various national  sentiments about the city and its belonging to specific national groups. The historically founded, ongoing debate over the geopolitical image  of Lviv was renewed after the collapse of the Eastern Bloc in post-Soviet  Ukraine, especially with the gradual opening of the borders and devel- opment of domestic and international tourism. With the reorientation  of the post-socialist satellite states along the East–West axis, the concept  of Central Europe has undergone essential changes. If Mitteleuropa was  associated with the rise of German and Austrian political and economic  interests in Europe (see Naumann 1916), the idea of new, post-1989  Central Europe meant, primarily, emancipation from eastern/Rus- sian hegemonic influences and looking towards the West. Thus, in the  context of post-Soviet Lviv, Czaplicka contends that for this Ukrainian  city, with its history in the former Habsburg province of Galicia, “the  association with Europe is based on historical ties to the region of Cen- tral Europe” (Czaplicka 2003, 400). He also argues that because of the  architectural and cultural legacy of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the  residents of the city, and perhaps of the region, think of themselves as  distinct from the rest of Ukraine. In the context of this westward gaze,  the last several decades have witnessed concerted efforts to revive  </page> <page sequence="16"> 134 Irene Sywenky the historic urban ambience of Lviv (the revival of ethnic districts, the  restoration of Armenian and Viennese coffee houses, the founding of  cultural societies, and so on). While most of these ventures have been  privately funded, some initiatives have come from public groups and  the municipal government. In keeping with these efforts, in 2000 a peti- tion was signed to erect a monument to Emperor Francis Josef I as a  “symbol-testimony of our choice of Europe and our will to co-exist in  the circle of free and independent nations of Central Europe” (qtd. in  Zayarnyuk 15). Such manifestations of westward orientation in the  guise of imperial nostalgia have troubled some commentators (for a  critical analysis, see Zayarnyuk16). In October 2013, a sculptural trib- ute to Iurii Franz Kulchytckyj, the Galician who introduced coffee to  Vienna (from whence it came to Lviv), was erected in the city centre,  thus “visibly” reconnecting Lviv to Austria, but also reminding onlook- ers that influences between the province and its metropolis flowed in  both directions. According to Heidi Schlipphacke’s recent study of  Habsburg nostalgia, the manifestation of this phenomenon is “particu- larly striking in light of the historical vicissitudes of the twentieth cen- tury: World War I, World War II, Nazism, the Holocaust, the rise of  independent nation states throughout Central Europe, and the demise  of the Soviet Bloc.” Significantly, the longing for empire is equally per- sistent in the cultural landscape of the capital city of Vienna and the  former imperial borderlands (such as Lviv) and can be seen as a search  for “the elusive stability” associated with the rule of Emperor Francis  Josef I (2). The above examples of the material and visible signs of reorienta- tion of post-Soviet Lviv that affect its current topography go hand in  hand with narrative (re)constructions and rewritings of its history and  culture. As Ruble points out, while the physical city is being reclaimed  by various groups and communities through selective preservation or  neglect respectively, “the metaphysical city is restructured by a selec- tive retelling of history through tours, guidebooks, textbooks, films and  Internet sites” (14). In the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet empire,  with the promotion of tourism and the regained freedom to circulate  texts within and across borders, literature on the city, its regional his- tory, and its culture has undergone a renaissance. The publication of  area travel guides, city guides, historical references, and travelogues  catering to various audiences (thereby endorsing different perspec- tives) has become an industry in its own right. Foreign publishers have  expressed significant interest in various aspects of the city’s history.  </page> <page sequence="17"> Spaces of Unhomeliness 135 German-language publications focus mainly on the Austrian period  in the development of Lviv (see Bisanz; Fäßler, Held, and Sawitzki;  Woldan). There has been a flurry of publications in Polish; one example  is a multi-volume series on Lwów/Lviv edited by Żaliński and Karolc- zak. Another significant Polish publication is the 2007 collection Miasto  jak brylant (Grodziska, A City like a Diamond). This impressive six-hun- dred-page compilation of quotations and excerpts about the city from a  variety of literary sources represents primarily the Polish perspective,  which constructs Lwów/Lviv as a Polish city and an important part  of Polish history. The three-volume history of Lviv by Isaievych is rep- resentative of the current Ukrainian narrative of Lviv, which empha- sizes Ruthenian/Ukrainian historical influence in the city. An example  of the literary revival is Dvanadciatka, a recently published anthology  of Ukrainian urban prose produced in Polish Lwów of the 1930s. For  postcolonial Ukrainian culture, such rewritings of local urban histories  are important ways to restore a voice that had long been erased from  official historiographies of the city. Both in Poland and in Lviv there are  publishing houses specializing in regional history and culture (e.g., the  Centr Ievropy in Lviv and Kraków), and these have been very active  in reviving interest in the city’s history. Some publications emphasize  the regional context (e.g., Halyts’ka brama [The Galician Gate], in which  the idea of Galicia is revived as a distinctly geopolitical concept). The  2004 collection Lviv Leopolis Lwów Lemberg Genius Loci, published by  the Lviv sociopolitical and literary journal/publisher Ji, is notable in  that it brings together a wide array of narratives about the city, mostly  non-fictional, drawn from different historical periods, cultures, and  languages. Some contributions appear in translation and some in the  original language, thus acknowledging and reviving the historically  polyglot and polyphonic space of Lviv. According to Ruble, “the emer- gence of pluralistic images of the past, present, and future may open  the way for more pluralistic understandings of power and social rela- tions” (5). These publications are important signs of the ongoing pro- cess of rebuilding the city’s civic identity. While the historical, journalistic, and tourist publications construct  today’s city as a contested site of different national and geopoliti- cal orientations, the post-1989 literary discourse has been an equally  important contributor to the discussion of Lviv’s cultural and politi- cal space. The dialogue started by Polish writers such as Wittlin, Lem,  Herbert, and Zagajewski did not have parallel Ukrainian counterparts  during the decades of Soviet rule for reasons of much stricter political  </page> <page sequence="18"> 136 Irene Sywenky censorship and suppressions of local (anti-Soviet) nationalism. Privi- leging Lviv’s Central European/Austrian heritage, acknowledging its  Polish history, recognizing the role of important ethnic communities  such as the Armenians, or emphasizing the presence of Jewish or Ukrai- nian historic agency in the area would have meant subverting its totali- tarian monologic character as constructed by the Soviet regime.  One prominent Ukrainian literary figure who has contributed to the  post-totalitarian, pluralistic narrative of Lviv is Iurii Andrukhovych,  whose oeuvre has also become associated with the discourse of Central  Europe in today’s western Ukraine. Andrukhovych’s poetic work of the  early 1990s engages in the archaeology of imperial history and empha- sizes the process of repeated recontextualization and displacement of  the national self. Maura Hametz’s argument regarding the function of  Habsburg memories in the sociocultural landscape of Trieste can be  extended to the case of Lviv, another borderland city where a return to  the narrative of Austro-Hungarian imperial history “provides a vehicle  to reconcile the city’s Central European past with its position on the  geographic periphery” (131), in this case the periphery of both Ukraine  and Europe. Andrukhovych’s poetry of this period features much of  Lviv’s actual historic topography; in this way, he identifies both the  setting (for those familiar with the city) and the historical context. His  exploration of Lviv’s multilayered colonial past is performed on the  thematic, allegoric, and linguistic levels. A representative poetic cycle  is “Три балади” (“Three Ballads”), in which the poet sketches scenes  from the life of Austrian Lemberg based on actual events and referenc- ing real historical figures. In a matter-of-fact description of the collapse  of the city tower17 in “Лемберзька катастрофа 1826 р.” (“The Lemberg  Catastrophe of 1826”) as a “minor apocalypse” of the “tragic city”  (Andrukhovych, Бy-Бa-Бy [Bu-Ba-Bu] 18), the poet’s focus is on the  connotation of the “minor” and “small”; these qualifiers can be read  in terms of the city’s and its people’s unimportance both in the general  course of history and in the system of imperial hierarchies. In its use  of specific details, the poem references the actual archival document  in which the event was described; the mock German accent used to  offset the document text emphasizes the critical distance imparted by  the archivist’s neutral/indifferent official language. The second poem  of the cycle, “Дидактична вистава в театрі Богуславського” (“A Didac- tic Show in the Boguslawski Theatre”), refers to Wojciech Boguslawski,  who is considered to be the founder of Polish national theatre and who  lived and worked in Lemberg for part of his career. Here, again, the  </page> <page sequence="19"> Spaces of Unhomeliness 137 poet emphasizes the distance between the imperial elite and the lower  classes, but also a history built on human losses and tragedies (“we  all walk on dead bodies,” 19). In the explicitly parodic commentary of  “Нашіптування з віків” (“Whispering across the Ages”), the figure of  the Austrian Emperor Francis Josef I – significantly referred to just as  Emperor or Joseph – becomes not only symbolic of the imperial power  of Austro-Hungary, but also an allusion to another Joseph to come (Sta- lin). The poet adopts the form of a ceremonial praise/eulogy, one that  is heavy with ironic double-meanings – for example, in its reference  to a “happy nation” (“щаслива нація,” 20) and in its celebration of the  emperor’s visit to Lemberg. The poem juxtaposes two historical impe- rial spaces where both rulers (Francis Josef I and Joseph Stalin) are part  of the same political structure; thus, addressing the ambivalent Joseph,  the poet comments in anticipation, “it’s still a while before the twenti- eth century, when you die” (20).18 Frequent intrusions of other linguistic  spaces (German, Polish, Russian) into the poetic space result in layers  of nuanced subtexts of the imperial structures of the past. Furthermore, the poet’s treatment of Lviv’s historical context is  somewhat contradictory: he acknowledges the city’s colonial past and  its geopolitical peripherality, but he is also fascinated by its cultural  and aesthetic complexity, which is precisely a consequence of its his- toric legacy. For the Polish authors discussed earlier, pre-Soviet Lwów  was part of their personal experience and personal memory (or, as in  the case of Zagajewski, his parents’ and grandparents’ stories of Lwów  were an integral part of his childhood and of what can be construed as  his “historical” identity). Andrukhovych’s nostalgia for Lviv, however,  is a nostalgia for a mythic construct, for the pre-Soviet Lviv he never  knew. Under the Soviet program of modernization, Lviv had never  become an industrial and “proletarian” urban centre as envisioned by  the state (Narvselius 63); it always remained primarily a cultural, edu- cational, and administrative centre. Nonetheless, during the totalitarian  years the emphasis was on an ideologically monologic and mono-eth- nic construction of the city’s narrative. The poet’s reading of the Lviv  that he knows intentionally goes beyond the years of totalitarian con- trol; it is a process of reimagining and rediscovering the city, whose past  was neglected, if not suppressed, for decades. His poetry of the 1990s  uncovers a palimpsest of voices and discourses and explores Lviv in  its connection between the past and the present, lost “somewhere ...  / between the renaissance and the baroque” (1019; see his poetic cycles  such as “Faustian Celebration,” “Medieval Menagerie,” “Exotic Birds  </page> <page sequence="20"> 138 Irene Sywenky and Plants,” Бy-Бa-Бy). Andrukhovych’s construction of the different  cities of Lviv and the problematic hermeneutics inherent in their his- torical opacity is strongly reminiscent of the development of the same  theme in China Miéville’s recent The City &amp; the City, where one physi- cal, material city (ambiguously situated somewhere in post-totalitarian  Eastern Europe) houses two ontological constructs, two superimposing  urban imaginaries that remain both contiguous and irreconcilable. The theme of the city, so pervasive in Andrukhovych, remains for  him primarily the theme of the City as a Galician and a Central Euro- pean cultural space. Andrukhovych was born in western Ukraine, but  not in Lviv, although he would spend his student years there. For the  poet, as a western Ukrainian, Lviv had always been the centre of cul- tural gravitation, the space that largely defined the identity of what con- stituted the historical region of Galicia.20 Andrukhovych’s construction  of Lviv is therefore also a search for the roots of his historical identity,  for the kind of collective belonging that is defined against, and opposed  to, the years of officially imposed totalitarian, Soviet collectivity. But  his archaeology of memory and history is far from unproblematic and  is dominated by silence, amnesia, and semantic opacity; it is a mutable,  discursively constructed space: “it is only through us that cities pass  / into un-memory. / We pronounce them / and find them different”  (46).21 A character in one of his untitled poems collected “impressions  / of castles, dungeons, monasteries, / ruins, stairs, monks’ cells and  yards, / and listened to what the stones would say at last ... // But they  remained silent ...” (12).22 Andrukhovych situates the historical space of  Lviv as a complex palimpsest of multiple narratives, where the original  text is no longer legible and interpretation is becoming ever more prob- lematic and ambivalent. The metaphor of the gate, likely linked inter- textually to Herbert’s poem – the gate that is both a passageway and an  exclusionary divisive line – emphasizes the impossibility of belonging:  There are cities that are impossible to enter through a gate.  There are cities that are impossible to enter  And they bring a huge key, and they look for a place to insert it, but there is no gate, the guards all crumbled  to dust. Seven winds are sweeping  across its squares and halls. (44)23 Andrukhovych’s hermeneutic quest for his city, a city as a narrative of  collective belonging, is a disillusioning experience; the text of the city is  constituted by gaps and lacunae rather than a coherent story. The poet’s  </page> <page sequence="21"> Spaces of Unhomeliness 139 narrative of Lviv is a site of continuous tension between presence and  absence, transparency and opacity; it is a fundamentally unhomely and  historically nomadic space that resists appropriation through definitive  reading. In his later essays, which often focus on the geopolitical and cultural  aspects of the space of East Central Europe and Galicia, Adrukhovych  looks back on his earlier experiences of Lviv. Thus, in “Intimate Urban  Prose” he revisits, more critically, his first encounter with Lviv and  explicitly acknowledges, in this slightly tongue-in-cheek description,  that his initial construction of that city had little to do with the real place: The imaginary city of Lviv was spread on the picturesque green hills,  completely preserving the architectonics and architecture of a city that  looked distinctly medieval. From the windows, one could hear harpsichord  music [...] and long-haired maidens were waiting for me on the grass by  the fountains. In the imaginary Lviv they spoke only Ukrainian, except  maybe for some old warlocks or magicians who could throw in a little bit  of Latin or Greek. Generally, it was a city of eternal mystery. (Дезорієнтація  на місцевості [Disorientation on Location] 13)24 Although clearly a fantasy, this conceptualization of Lviv nonetheless  points to its role both as a Ukrainian national space and as a cultural  nexus associated with the West. With its mix of medievalism, national  sentiments, and cultural components gravitating towards a Western  cultural paradigm, this imaginary, “foreign” cityscape is an escapist  dream that is subversive of the poet’s everyday Soviet reality. Andruk- hovych’s actual experience of Lviv as a Soviet city in the 1980s shat- tered his earlier mythology: Ninety percent of the real Lviv was comprised of awful outskirts and  new developments. Agglomeration of industrial areas, chaotic piling of  factories, monotonous high-rise apartment neighbourhoods of the 70s and  later years, concrete, panels, and stench [...]. Its municipality was helpless  about the problems with water, sewage, and public transportation. If there  was any music coming from its windows, it was Soviet pop; there turned  out to be a lot of Russian language spoken in the city. (Dyjavol kxovajet’sja  v syri 13–14)25 Caught between two conflicting, irreconcilable spaces, the poet opted  for a different reality of the city: “There was little left for me but to  believe in some sort of parallel, secret Lviv. From time to time this city  </page> <page sequence="22"> 140 Irene Sywenky signalled its existence to me” (14).26 The “parallel,” clandestine Lviv of  Andrukhovych’s preference was a city of political actions against dis- sidents, underground art exhibitions, rumours of the rock opera “Ste- pan Bandera” (a forbidden Ukrainian nationalist icon), a screening of a  Tarkovsky film, or a midnight climb up the hills of the High Castle (14). Andrukhovych’s typology of the city identifies three planes of exis- tence: as a space of imagination, a mythology; as a real, physical space;  and as a space of resistance. All of these have symbolic meanings; in  the first instance, it is a site of desire, and, in the others, a site of active  subversion and opposition. In some ways, these different visions of  Lviv also relate to Andrukhovych’s long-standing engagement with  the debate over Central Europe and Galicia and show a distinct evolu- tion of his views regarding the reorientation of this post-Soviet space  (see also Sywenky, “Romancing the Empire”). If his 1990s writings tend  to indulge in a nostalgic search for a “better” empire, western Ukraine’s  lost home, the next decade witnesses Andrukhovych’s rethinking of his  platform, as he himself acknowledges: I have recently arrived at the conclusion that for me [East Central Europe]  is not, by any means, the ruins of the Habsburg-Danube idyll (which  could have been easily derived from my earlier writing), and, thus, not  the territory of old Austro-Hungary, not the coffee places with the aroma  of cinnamon, not the Viennese postcards, not the old Galician anecdotes,  not Sacher, not Masoch, not Kafka, not Musil, not Schulz, not Roth, not all  the others. (Dyjavol kxovajet’sja v syri 87)27 Thus the explicit and often superficial aestheticization of the Central  European space gives way to a more sober conceptualization of what  this spatial and geopolitical construct means to Andrukhovych in  historical terms. In the essay “Атлас. Медитації” (“The Atlas: Medita- tions”), the writer reflects on his reading of the 1996 Diercke Weltatlas  (Diercke World Atlas) and his own revision of the cartographic narra- tive. While Diercke Weltatlas’s “Mitteleuropa” is limited to the histori- cally traditional concept centred on the German-speaking cultures and  the former sphere of Austrian influence, Andrukhovych’s revisionist  Central Europe includes what he understands as East Central Europe –  that is, most of the post-totalitarian region. In his words, this East  Central Europe is a space of extreme historical tensions, deportations,  displacements, and genocides; an interstitial territory between East and  West; a “transitional, inter-imperial seismic zone” (Dyjavol kxovajet’sja v  </page> <page sequence="23"> Spaces of Unhomeliness 141 syri 119–20). While acknowledging many of the problematic aspects of  today’s reality in the region, he nonetheless embraces it as his current  and only home and as a cultural space that is closer to him than the  sanitized nostalgic utopia of the bygone empire. In the recent Лексикон інтимних міст (Lexicon of Intimate Cities 2012),  an autobiographical exercise in urban studies that includes more than  one hundred essay-entries on cities all over the world that he lived in  and visited during his life, Andrukhovych understandably devotes sig- nificant space to Lviv, the city that defies any clear chronology of his life,  a place that is not “before” or “after,” but “always.” Here, Andrukhovych  constructs a kind of Borgesian space that includes every imaginable pos- sibility of this city and thus offers an infinite unrealized potential. Among  its many different faces is “Lviv-simulacrum” that is always the “other,”  and “Lviv-phantasm,” a fictional labyrinth that falls into all the other  cities, their “fragments, broken pieces and reflections” (250–2). Andruk- hovych inevitably revisits the topos of High Castle, the “epicentre” of his  youth (96), thus explicitly connecting to Lem’s narrative. Zagajewski’s  and Andrukhovych’s intertextual “bonds” with Lem establish a com- mon space of memories that transcend individual linguistic and cultural  experience, bringing together the three very different cities of Lwów/ Lviv and creating a transhistorical continuum and continuity, which is  constituted by the simultaneous belonging and non-belonging of the  three writers in the city. Commenting on the actual castle, which was  destroyed several times in its history, Andrukhovych reflects that the  very name of High Castle carries in it a phantom presence; it “disori- ents and assumes that we believe in ghosts and that we agree with any  topographic-poetic conventions” (96). It is a pure hyperreal, a symbol  that is no longer supported by the real geophysical landmark, a continu- ous reinvention, an originary act that subverts its own reality. Just like  its central landmark, the city is an ongoing experiment in imagination,  a construct and a spatio-temporal heterotopia that continues to evolve. In the late 1980s, when Lviv was formally still a Soviet city but was  already starting to recover from the decades of totalitarian stagnation,  the German historian Karl Schlögel commented on its elusive identity;  he described it as a space of “washed out borders” and expressed a hope  that it would be able to regain its multi-voiced nature with which to tell  not just a history of Lviv, but a history of a Central European city (258).  It seems that this process is under way, from the changes in local topog- raphy to literary and cultural dialogues. This is important not just for  the reconstruction and rewriting of the historical narrative, but for the  </page> <page sequence="24"> 142 Irene Sywenky current social transformation. In Ruble’s words, “the task of rebuilding a  civic identity in L’viv following Ukrainian independence has prompted  present-day residents to look back once again to their city’s multi-ethnic  past in an effort to construct a future civic identity that might transcend  the Soviet experience” (13). The search for a point of confluence in these  emerging polyphonic discourses and for a shared space of historical  and cultural experience is a process familiar to many other East Cen- tral European cities, uncertain of their identity, unsettled and unhomely.  Reflecting on the journey as an interstitial condition, Zagajewski revis- its Plato’s concept of metaxu, being “in between” the commonplace and  the transcendent, the physical and the symbolic, between different sto- ries, meanings, ironies, “incurably ‘en route’” (Defence of Ardor 9). Lviv,  among other East Central European cities, is a city “en route,” a space  of continuous in-betweenness and hesitation, resisting finality through  definitive cultural categories and still writing its heteroglot story. The  ongoing literary (re)constructions of Lviv participate in the gradual  making of today’s city as a place and space of belonging; more impor- tantly, however, they also contribute to the broader discussion of the  civic future of the city and its community within national and cross-bor- der contexts while renegotiating the legacy of twentieth-century history. NOTES  1 “W obcych miastach jest radość nieznana   zimne szczęście nowego spojrzenia ...” All translations into English in this chapter are by Irene Sywenky unless  otherwise indicated.  2 Designations such as East Central Europe are always problematic,  geopolitically and culturally, if not geographically. However, following  the many examples of its use in much of the recent academic literature  (see, for example, Czaplicka), I suggest that in the context of the present  study, it serves the purpose of foregrounding the dual historical legacy  of the region in question: its situatedness between the Austrian-centred  Zentraleuropa (and western Ukraine’s current westward gaze and  orientation towards Central Europe) and the legacy of the Cold War and  socialist totalitarian regimes.  3 Commenting on the “nomenclature” problem with most Central European  cities, Davies and Moorhouse contend that “when a city has a different  name for every nationality that lays claim to it, to prefer one version over  another is to make a political statement” (11). To acknowledge Lemberg/ Lwów/Lviv’s situatedness between different cultural legacies, I will  </page> <page sequence="25"> Spaces of Unhomeliness 143 be using different versions of the name depending on the historical  context and the perspective discussed. This approach will serve both to  acknowledge the city’s complex historico-political background and to  foreground the different heterotopic spaces of the city that are sustained by  its different communities, past and present.  4 “Nie do Lwowa tęsknimy po latach rozląki, lecz do siebie samych we  Lwowie.”  5 For a detailed discussion of the way Sacher-Masoch’s historical figure and  legacy are appropriated in today’s discourse of the city, see Chernetsky.  6 “Powinniśmy [...] każdy obraz świata, odbity w pamięci, też uznać za  rzeczywistość. Za rzeczywistość naszej duszy. A wtedy będzie już obojętne,  czy Lwów był naprawdę taki, jakim go tu wspominamy, czy inny.”  7 Many post-1991 English translations from Polish and other languages use  dated (and politically incorrect) Soviet/Russian nomenclature, such as  Lvov. In this case, it would have certainly been much more appropriate to  use either the official Ukrainian place name of Lviv, or the Polish Lwów  (as a way of emphasizing the poet’s perspective).  8 “Nigdy o tobie nie ośmielam się mówić” (Poezje 106).  9 “powtarzam tylko okrutnie pospolitą litanię słów” (Poezje 106).  10 “ułomna pamięć tworzy / plan miasta” (Poezje 131).  11 “w końcu zostanie kamień / na którym mnie urodzono” (Poezje 132).  12 “co noc / staję boso / przed zatrzaśniętą bramą / mego miasta” (Poezje 132).  13 “pozostało nam tylko miejsce przywiązanie do miejsca / jeszcza  dzierżymy ruiny świątyń widma ogrodów i domów” (Poezje 521).  14 “Jeśli ludzie dzielą się na osiadłych, emigrantów i bezdomnych, to ja należę  zapewnie do tej trzeciej kategorii” (Dwa miasta 7).  15 “Chodziłem więc tymi ulicami Gliwic z moim dziadkiem [...] ale w istocie  spacerowaliśmy po dwu różnych miastach. [...] byłem absolutnie pewny,  że [...] znajduję się naprawdę tam, gdzie się znajduję. Mój dziadek jednak,  mimo że szedł tuż przy mnie, przenosił się w tym samym momencie do  Lwowa. Ja szedłem ulicami Gliwic, on Lwowa” (Dwa miasta 15).  16 Unlike the critics of this proposal, some think that, in the context of Lviv’s  history, such a monument “would not appear out of place” (Czaplicka and  Ruble 401).  17 The collapse of the Lemberg Town Hall on 14 July 1826 was a significant  and well-documented event, especially in the light of its later rebuilding in  a distinctly neoclassical style by Austrian architects; this, at the time, was  considered one of the important contributions to the city’s change under  the Austrian rule (for more discussion, see Prokopovych 152–57).  18 “і де ще той двадцятий вік, в якому ти помреш?”  19 “десь отам, / між ренесансом і бароко....” </page> <page sequence="26"> 144 Irene Sywenky  20 Galicians tend to see themselves as different from other regions of Ukraine.

Фатальна безпорадність  міської влади з водою, каналізацією, транспортом. З відчинених вікон якщо й  долинала якась музика, то тільки радянська естрада, російської мови в місті  виявилося страшенно багато.”  26 “мені не залишалося нічого іншого, крім віри в якийсь паралельний, таємний  Львів. Час від часу це місто посилало мені сигнали про своє існування.”  27 “Нещодавно я дійщов висновку, що для мене це аж ніяк не уламки  Габсбурзько-Дунайської ідилії (про що можна було недалекоглядно виснувати  з моїх давніщніх писань), отже, не територія старої Австро-Угорщини, не  цинамонові кав’ярні, не віденські поштівки, не старі галицькі анекдоти, не  Захер, не Мазох, не Кафка, не Музиль, не Шульц, не Рот, не всі інщі.” WORKS CITED Andrukhovych, Iurii.
