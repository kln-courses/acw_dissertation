The author, a Professor of English Literature at Zurich, is engaged on a two-part study to be collectively entitled Comparative Tragedy, in which he will consider tragedy from the classical period to the present day. The importance he attaches to the Greeks in this matter is shown by the fact that his first part - the volume to be reviewed here - is devoted exclusively to Greek tragedy. We classicists are thus reminded once more of the scale of our responsibilities, of the immense implications of our subject for the study of literature as a whole. The book falls into three main sections. In Section I, "Tragedy and Reality," Vickers expounds his own approach to Greek tragedy, at the same time challenging many of the current critical assumptions; on this aspect of the book more will be said below. Section lI, "Tragedy and Myth," continues the process of ground-clearing. Vickers considers recent analyses of Greek myth by classicists and anthropologists, and their application to the criticism of tragedy. His conclusion here is not new (Wilamowitz for one - who does not appear in the Bibliography - would have warmly applauded it), but it deserved to be restated. In brief: there is "a radical difference between Greek anthropomorphic mythology and the fluid and fantastic myths of less complex cultures" (p. 204), in that the Greek myths reflect the preoc- cupations of a relatively advanced urban society and are "resolutely human" (p. 205). Remarkable is Ch. 5, which attempts nothing less than a motif-index of Greek mythology, in such categories as "the preservation of the oikos" and "the con- sequences of crime." From this index Vickers infers (pp. 261-62, cf. p. 269) that the Greek myths in themselves already embodied a coherent system of social and religious values - a system which was reproduced, when the time came, by the tragedians, however much they might modify or criticize it. Vickers' manner of posing the problem, as well as his analysis, will almost certainly be questioned by the experts; yet his fundamental contention here seems highly important. Sections I and II are essentially concerned with method, although their arguments are illustrated by lengthy examples from the whole range of Greek tragedy. In Section III Vickers finally proceeds to the full-scale criticism of certain specific works: the Oresteia; all the suppliant-plays in the tragic corpus; the Oedipus and Antigone; the three Electra- plays, considered together with the Orestes. This final section will perhaps be of the least interest to classicists. Most of it is virtually a prose paraphrase of the plays concerned, such as anyone might produce for himself, whatever his critical principles; there are some useful observations here and there, but one has to excavate far for them. There follow three Appendices (notable is App. II, a lengthy critique of G. S. Kirk's study on myth), a Bibliography, and an index of classical and modern authorities. Eight plates of vase-paintings precede the text but seem to have little</page><page sequence="2">344 THE CLASSICAL WORLD FEBRUARY 1976 relevance to it, being referred to only briefly on pp. 42-3. Such are the contents of this very long book. In general, its virtues and its failings are great; and perhaps both are attributable to the amateur status of its author. This reviewer welcomes above all the general approach to Greek tragedy which Vickers here champions: he has dared to reintroduce to our studies the simple principle that the tragedies, after all, really do relate to human life and conduct. "Perhaps students of the classics," he writes on p. 3, "have felt that such a gigantic achievement as Greek tragedy needed some more impressive critical model to do justice to it, some more weighty philosophical scheme. Perhaps they felt that human beings are not enough." A tragedy is not, he protests, "a thesis or an object" (p. xi); and "to discuss a literary genre which has such strong links with life as tragedy has and not to make human judgments is a peculiarly sterile form of academicism" (p. xii). Vickers thus bases himself on strong and ancient ground (it is, surely, the ground of classical and Renaissance humanism), and from it he succeeds in dealing punishing blows to certain dogmas of the modern professional critics: Chs. 1 and 2 in particular are recommended for their irreverent and intelligent handling of dike, hybris, nemesis, the current orthodoxy on "character," and the theme of "learning through suf- fering." In such matters the judgment of a humane, widely-read, and independent- minded literary critic, as Vickers clearly is, deserves to be heard with the closest at- tention. It is all the more unfortunate that he has not recognized the limitations of his own expertise. If the book had only been what its title suggests, a guide towards the appreciation of Greek tragedy! But it is nothing of the kind; it is an ambitious at- tempt to wrap up the whole subject in one volume. Believing, rightly, that it cannot be fully understood without an understanding of Greek society, popular ethics, and religion, Vickers has undertaken his own large-scale investigation of these matters. The trouble is that he seems to have worked entirely at second hand. His reading in recent secondary literature is astonishingly wide, and his judgment on it is often refreshing. Yet at no point can one escape the feeling that one is being held at a distance from the primary data (the Greek texts, the stones, the clay) which alone can form the basis of a valid jucdgment - that Vickers is acutely classifying echoes. And a similar objection applies, if less forcefully, to his criticism of the tragedies themselves. On closing the book, for all its interest, one asks oneself whether Vickers has ever heard a Greek lyrical drama in its totality. Everything that can be found in the available modern translations of the tragedies is accounted for more or less com- petently; what is missing is any sense of the very medium itself, Greek tragic diction and verse in all their beauty and complexity. A strange anomaly: where other literatures are concerned, it is still generally agreed that you cannot criticize verse without having sensed its texture in the original language (one doubts, for instance, if a book on Donne or Milton by someone who had read those authors exclusively in mediocre Russian translations would be accepted as definitive by professors of English Literature). Why this rule should be waived for any critic who chooses to teach or write on classical literature- of all literatures - is beyond me. Finally one must ask, what general conclusions about the nature and function of Greek tragedy emerge from the long analysis? These above all: "The direct presentation of suffering and the answering response of pity are shown throughout Greek tragedy" (p. 76); "the final insight of [Euripides'] Orestes is that you or I, despite our liberal and humane pretensions, might, if the appropriate pressures built up, collapse into 'irrationality' and 'animality' " (p. 587); "I argue, then, for a con- tinuity of form and feeling throughout Greek tragedy, and a shared attitude towards human violence, destructiveness and perversion" (p. 598, from the Conclusion). Here again, the book seems to attempt too much. It remains valuable in many respects, and</page><page sequence="3">FEBRUARY 1976 THE CLASSICAL WORLD 345 certainly deserves to be consulted by classical scholars.
