<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEW ARTICLE A NEW REFERENCE WORK ON SEAL-AMULETS* WILLIAM A. WARDt BROWN UNIVERSITY Based on two decades of research, Othmar Keel's introductory volume to his corpus of seal-amu- lets discovered in Palestine offers an encyclopedic reference work on this genre of artifact. While concerned primarily with material from Palestine, this volume represents a landmark in the investiga- tion of scarabs and other seal-amulets that generally also applies to Egyptian evidence. Wide-ranging essays on typology, design motifs, materials, and especially the local Palestinian production of these objects mark this work as the most complete analysis to date of this class of archaeological material. OTHMAR KEEL'S EINLEITUNG to his forthcoming cor- pus of all seal-amulets discovered in Palestine is far more comprehensive than the title indicates. The book is almost breathtaking in its scope and, while it is not ori- ented toward evidence from Egypt itself, Keel's research is a detailed examination of just about everything one needs to know about these objects: their typology, his- torical development, how they were used, and what they may have meant in their own and in a foreign context. The breadth of this volume can be stated in a few sta- tistics: Keel examines seal-amulets from Neolithic times to the Persian period, material has been gathered from over a hundred public and private collections (pp. 3-6), and the bibliography (pp. 292-360) supporting the text contains over 2,300 entries. While one may question a particular detail or theory, this is a major archaeological volume, a genuine watershed between what has appeared previously and what will appear in the future. Establishing a corpus of seal-amulets discovered in Palestine has been the ultimate goal of Keel and his colleagues for over two decades. This is a competent and knowledgeable group of scholars, well versed in a sub- ject the mastery of which really requires a group effort. They have collectively produced a steady stream of books * This is a review article of: Corpus der Stempelsiegel- Amulette aus Palastina/Israel: Von den Anfangen bis zur Perserzeit, Einleitung.

The structure of this volume follows the headings of the individual corpus entries: object, style of engraving, base designs, date, and so on. Within each of these categories, whole chapters are devoted to the presentation of a wealth of information. Keel's examination of the base designs, for example, takes up almost one hundred pages and his analysis of the typology of the various forms of seal- amulets almost a hundred more. We thus have at hand a genuine textbook on these objects, with the usual thor- ough examination we have come to expect from Keel's previous works. One of the major themes Keel develops throughout this book is that of local production in Palestine versus the importing of Egyptian pieces. While this problem has long been noted in the literature, some truly convinc- ing research has been done by Keel and his colleagues. Certainly, those scarabs he identifies as the Omega- and Jasper groups (??54-58) were locally made, amply shown by their engraving techniques and the subject matter of their designs, at least partially drawn from the repertoire of west Asiatic cylinder seals. Local design motifs also include the "toga-wearer" (??569-70), the "naked god- dess" (??574-76), and the figures of Baal-Hadad and Reshef (??571-73). It is very difficult, in my opinion, to go much beyond such groups which, collectively, show un-Egyptian motifs or manufacturing techniques. Keel does propose a secondary category of designs that indicate local manufacture, the mixing of Egyptian and Asiatic motifs. For example, the combination of the Horus falcon and branch or a branch or flower held by 673</page><page sequence="2">Journal of the American Oriental Society 117.4 (1997) a falcon-headed figure is "totally un-Egyptian," the branch being a symbol for the Canaanite "branch-goddess" or the weather deity who renewed vegetation (??62, 64, 433). Similarly, the branch is used with the Canaanite "naked goddess" motif (?574) and the Canaanite adaptation of the Hathor-head (?579). This is an interesting argument. The branch motif is not one used on Egyptian scarabs; scarabs with this symbol seem to appear only at Egyptian sites, such as Tell el-Yahudiyah and Tell Maskhuta with their obvious Asiatic connections. The "toga-wearer" and "naked goddess" designs just noted illustrate the basic problem of "local production" that no one has as yet really solved. There is no doubt that both motifs have clear analogies in the contempo- rary Syrian cylinder-seal tradition and should be con- sidered Canaanite. But these motifs are engraved on scarabs that, in all other respects-material (steatite) and the typological features of backs and sides-are pre- cisely what one finds on scarabs made in Egypt and discovered at Egyptian sites. Keel suggests (?54) as a working hypothesis that the Asiatics who settled in the Delta, primarily at Tell ed-DabCa, may have brought the craft of making scarabs to Palestine where these ob- jects have been found in such large quantities in MB IIB deposits. The emphasis on Middle Bronze Age Tell ed-DabCa, certainly the most productive site in the Delta as far as evidence of Asiatic influence is concerned, obscures the fact that there were other contemporary sites where Asiatic influence can be seen, such as Tell el-Yahudiyah and Tell Maskhuta. While the final report on the latter has not yet appeared, Redmount's doctoral dissertation (1989) is a thorough description of the intrusive settle- ment. Such sites are generally considered to date to the Hyksos age, but Dever (Ward and Dever 1994: 61) has judged much of the Maskhuta pottery to be of MB IIA-IIA/B (his MB I-I/II) date. This ought to have some impact on when scarabs appeared in Palestine and whether or not they were locally manufactured there. The emphasis on Tell ed-DabCa is understandable in light of the outstanding discoveries made there, but the pub- lished chronology of the site may not be as reliable as most scholars assume (Ward and Dever 1994: 74-87 and ch. 6). There are other solutions, of course. Since there are no steatite deposits in Palestine-the overwhelming ma- jority of scarabs found there are of this material-one must consider the importing of the raw material from Egypt where it is found in abundance. Blank scarabs, manufactured in Egypt specifically for export, could have been decorated with local motifs in Palestine, or even finished in Egypt for the export trade. One thinks also of itinerant Egyptian engravers plying their trade abroad or of Palestinian craftsmen who learned this craft. It may be that all these factors are involved. As Keel suggests, beyond the obvious evidence of local manu- facture typified by his Omega- and Jasper groups, we must look at individual objects and un-Egyptian details of design to find hints that any given piece was made in Palestine. There is another approach not generally emphasized in discussions of connections between Egypt and Palestine in this and later periods: the probability of Egyptians resident in Palestine, part of the mobile middle class. This is the stratum of society that was not tied down to a particular place and which could perform its func- tion anywhere it chose: the professional people who were free to go where they wished, to wander about or settle temporarily or permanently in foreign places. Assyrian merchants established branch offices in Anatolia. Hittite and Mycenaean merchants lived at Ugarit. Canaanites and Hurrians went to Deir el-Medineh in Egypt to settle and work on the construction of the tombs in the Valley of the Kings. Canaanite weavers and musicians plied their pro- fessions in Egyptian households and temples. The list is long and varied. It is also a very old phenomenon, as wit- ness the Canaanite metallurgists living at Maadi and the Egyptians at Canaanite sites at the beginning of Egyptian dynastic history (Ward 1991: 16-17). One cannot overestimate the impact this international movement of individuals had on cultural exchange. They took with them not only the skills of their professions, but also their languages, religions, costumes, beliefs- everything they knew from their own native cultures. In- dividuals moving to foreign places therefore had great impact, a factor that we sometimes neglect amidst the invasions and conquests. There is one aspect of this observation worth consid- ering. We are accustomed to speaking of "Egyptianized foreigners" who moved to Egypt and remained there to establish new homes for their descendants. These people were absorbed into Egyptian culture and were ultimately buried in the Egyptian fashion, implying that they had adopted the religious beliefs of their new home. If there were Egyptianized foreigners in Egypt, the reverse should also be true. Egyptians were as much a part as anyone in the movements of individuals around the region as just described. Since they lived in for- eign communities, many must have been buried there. In this connection, Dothan's assessment of anthropoid clay coffins at many Canaanite sites as an originally Egyptian tradition later adopted by the Philistines is quite convinc- ing. Those at Deir el-Balah just south of Gaza, four of which were accompanied by Egyptian funerary stelae, 674</page><page sequence="3">WARD: A New Reference Work in Seal-Amulets are of particular interest (Dothan 1982: 252-60). There is at least one purely Egyptian funerary stela from level VI at Beth Shan and there are the numerous clay an- thropoid coffins there of the thirteenth century B.C., now considered to be Egyptian burials. Other stelae from the Beth Shan temples, dedicated to local deities by Egyp- tians probably living there, are exactly what one would expect in a similar context in Egypt. These stelae name more ordinary folk: a construction engineer, an Egyptian housewife, a musician, and a royal overseer of granaries. A fragment of a lintel mentions an Egyptian scribe and another housewife whose names are broken away (Ward 1966). These are the kind of people one would expect to find in an Egyptian community abroad, those who left Egypt to find opportunities elsewhere. We know of Egyp- tian physicians, singers, businessmen, and other profes- sionals living abroad who are mentioned in local texts (Helck 1971: 434). One of them was a resident of Ugarit to whom the king of that city gave in perpetuity a house and land (Nougayrol 1955, text 16.136). Thus, while the evidence is certainly not abundant, it does suggest that we can properly speak of Canaanized Egyptians. And while the evidence noted here comes largely from the Late Bronze Age, there is no reason why the situation it suggests did not exist in the Middle Bronze Age as well. This hypothesis presents one route for the transmission of Egyptian scarabs that might produce answers to some of the vexing problems concerning the extraordinary number of scarabs found in Palestine, especially in the MB IIB period. Keel's discussion of typology forms the bulk of this work, including a survey of previous systems and the strength and weaknesses of each. He has opted for the typology of Tufnell (1984) with some modifications, since Keel's material is more inclusive and covers a much longer period. On occasion, Keel offers general obser- vations on typology which hold good for his Palestinian material, but not always for that from Egypt. Although it is true, for example, that schematic and simplified scarab forms tend to be later than the more realistic ones, I think it premature to conclude that such schematic and simplified forms appear earlier in western Asia than in Egypt (?93). They appear on early Egyptian scarabs, albeit rarely, but since most of the earlier evidence from Egypt consists of seal impressions from several sites, we know nothing of the typological characteristics of the scarabs that made these impressions. Keel seems to have been influenced on this point by his early Omega- group made of glazed composition; scarabs of this ma- terial are almost inevitably of the schematic and implied types no matter what their date. Keel's typological stud- ies include all the forms seal-amulets may take: scara- boids, cowroids, animal backs, plaques, and many others that ought to prove helpful in future studies. I have already found his discussion of "bundled handle" seals (?212) of use in describing a unique example engraved with the prenomen of Rameses IV recently found dur- ing the new excavations in downtown Beirut. Since his typologies and the resulting chronologies are based on objects found in Palestine, however, the conclusions do not always hold true for those found in Egypt. One of Keel's most informative essays concerns the materials of which seal-amulets were made (??340-405). This includes descriptions of their chemical composi- tion, notes on the difficulties (and errors) in identifi- cation of materials, how they may be altered by firing or glazing, and the like. Two professional mineralogists joined the project for this phase and the non-scientist now has available a concise and understandable essay on what has always been one of the most pressing problems in archaeology-the proper identification of materials. Indeed, it is often the case that a proper mineralogical identification is only possible by laboratory analysis, so more caution is necessary in archaeological publications. He also notes that ancient craftsmen were probably not as consistent in their choice of materials as we would like, often using similar materials as available. "Green jasper," for example, is currently used incorrectly for similar but not identical stones (?369). The proper iden- tification of materials, of course, has an impact on where objects may have been made, on trade connections, and the like. Turning to the decoration on the base of seal-amulets, Keel notes one factor usually ignored in scarab studies, the orientation of the base design to that of the scarab itself, that is, the orientation of human and animal fig- ures or other designs that have a top and a bottom to the head of the beetle. Do the tops of the designs corre- spond to the head of the beetle in a head-to-head orien- tation? This is an interesting question although, as Keel notes, it can only be answered by viewing the originals. To publish drawings and photographs is not necessarily illuminating in this respect since backs and designs are usually arranged for easy reference without considering the orientation of back to design. Where Keel was able to examine the originals, the conclusions are interesting. In the scarabs of his Omega group, the earliest found in Palestinian contexts, the head-to-head principle is not evident, while in his somewhat later Jasper group, the principle is characteristic. This is a factor that ought to be considered in future studies of scarab collections. It may or may not have some chronological or other significance. 675</page><page sequence="4">Journal of the American Oriental Society 117.4 (1997) As noted, after a review of previous classifications of design, Keel adopts Tufnell's system with appropriate changes and additions, giving a thorough discussion of each design class and all its varieties. While one may not always agree with his conclusions, this is a conve- nient starting point for the study of the designs and motifs found on these objects. It is the category of de- sign and motif that brings us face to face with meaning, symbolism, and religious intent, of particular interest to Keel and his colleagues. Designs made up of Egyptian signs and symbols re- ceive an extended treatment, since they are so common on Palestinian seal-amulets: hieroglyphs are engraved on 2,600 of the 3,400 objects of the Middle Bronze II Period alone. Keel raises a series of questions as to whether these hieroglyphs and symbols should be inter- preted as sound or sense signs-for example, the falcon, one of the most common. Is a falcon (1) figurative dec- oration symbolic of aggressiveness and protection; (2) a manifestation of a falcon deity, hence to be read "Ho- rus" or "Montu"; (3) with a red crown as a symbol of pharaoh; or (4) does it have multiple meanings embody- ing protective powers? In other words, is a falcon deco- ration, deity, symbol, or a combination of all these? Keel also shows that the symbols on seal-amulets are sometimes drawn from Egyptian symbols on other types of objects: the pair of udjat-eyes on Middle King- dom coffins and funerary stelae; the phrase "protection of life," on magic knives of the period; the red crown as symbolic of some connection between Lower Egypt and Palestine during the Hyksos age. He wisely re- frains, however, from drawing conclusions, although this does raise the important issue of whether symbols that had real and significant meaning in their Egyp- tian context had the same or a similar sense in foreign places. Throughout his writings, Keel answers this with a qualified "yes," whereas I have leaned more toward a qualified "no." There are analogies available and, while analogies are imperfect, they can be helpful. One thinks immediately of the first-millennium Phoenician scarab style found throughout the Mediterranean world, which made liberal use of scenes from the Isis-Osiris cycle. Keel's specula- tion about the falcon symbol applies equally to this later phenomenon. The widespread use on Phoenician scar- abs of such motifs as Isis holding Horus, Horus in the papyrus-marsh, Isis protecting Osiris, and the like, raises the same issues. Were Phoenician engravers of the eighth century B.C. and later simply decorating scarabs with pleasant scenes, or were these of significance to Medi- terranean religious beliefs? It seems to me that the pop- ularity of the Isis-Osiris cycle on Phoenician scarabs of the first millennium B.C. must represent the early spread of the Isis cult which gained such importance in classi- cal times. It is thus possible to place the scenes of the Isis-Osiris cycle on Phoenician scarabs in a historico- religious context. If this is a reasonable interpretation of the Phoenician scarab tradition, then a similar explana- tion may perhaps be true for apparently similar tradi- tions in Palestine during the second millennium B.C. Keel then turns to a discussion of the hieroglyphs that appear on scarabs from Middle Bronze Age con- texts in Palestine (??448-65), what they signify in the hieroglyphic writing system, and their possible symbolic significance on scarabs. Non-Egyptologists who will in- evitably use Keel's volume as their main reference work should, however, consult the discussions noted by Keel, which are not always as convincing as his text might indicate. He states, for example, that the ankh-hieroglyph is "probably not sandal-straps, as often assumed, but a phallus-sheath" (?449), quoting an article by Baines (1975). But Baines's study is highly theoretical and, while he considers an idea long proposed by others in a far more detailed analysis, he reaches no firm conclusion. This is, of course, not a criticism of Keel, whose purpose here is to provide the reader with the available informa- tion, rather than to determine whether it is completely reliable or conclusive. Further discussions on the "class 3" designs include those on the ubiquitous anra-motifs (??469-70) and the use of cryptography on New Kingdom scarabs (??472- 81). In both cases, Keel offers an excellent summary and his usual full documentation of previous studies; these are not simple problems to be thoroughly exam- ined in a general survey. In his discussion of cryptogra- phy he makes the important observation that while the general theory is "difficult to dispute," some who have written on the subject make "excessive assumptions" that are ultimately counter-productive (?481). This is a wise conclusion since cryptography has indeed been over- emphasized by many writers. This phenomenon was ex- amined primarily by Drioton in a long series of studies that established cryptographic spelling as a genuine ele- ment in hieroglyphic writing. Of interest in the present context is his study (1957) of the trigrammes d'Amon on scarabs which, if taken to the limits his researches al- low, means that any three hieroglyphs or symbols in any combination can be made to stand for the consonants i, m and n, hence the name of Amon. Drioton even postu- lated such readings for purely decorative scarabs of the First Intermediate Period. Keel himself rightly states that Amon does not appear in any form on scarabs prior to Dynasty XVIII (?642). Cryptography is valid up to a point, but one wonders if "Amon" was really intended 676</page><page sequence="5">WARD: A New Reference Work in Seal-Amulets as often as is now assumed. Keel's essay is more bal- anced than others in this regard. Although Keel does not insist on a particular inter- pretation of what the whole range of geometric designs may signify, he does note the various theories given by others. Concentric circles are thus defined as a sun-disc in Egyptian terms, as an eye in Anatolian art, the two ideas perhaps merging in the numerous concentric circle designs found on seal-amulets (?488). Cross and rosette patterns are said to symbolize the power of the center, that is, the king (?494), woven and knotted patterns express the idea of knotting ropes and amulets or tying body parts together (?495). While such symbolic inter- pretations of decorative designs may well reflect ancient beliefs, I am somewhat doubtful at times, for example, as regards the symbolic meaning of concentric circles just noted. This motif appears on several pottery tradi- tions, on ivory boxes, and other objects, and I would hes- itate to see in this a sun-disc or eye instead of just what it appears to be, decorative design. Design classes 9, animals and heraldic beasts, and 10, humans and anthropomorphic deities, together form a very substantial part of the seal-amulet design repertoire. Here, we are on surer ground as to origin and mean- ing; the "toga-wearer," "naked goddess," and Canaanite version of the hathor-head, already noted above, belong to this group. Figurative motifs such as these are some- what easier to define than geometric designs since they sometimes have excellent parallels in other media. One important conclusion is that caprids shown frequently on the seal-amulets are not antelopes, as often suggested, but ibexes. Since ibexes are represented in western Asi- atic art from neolithic times, this may be another exam- ple of local influence (?519). Far more to the point are rare motifs showing two flanking ibexes looking back- ward toward branches or a deity holding two caprids by the neck, both motifs being surely of Asiatic origin (?520). While I admit to a certain skepticism toward attempts to "read" these figurative scarabs, the more one studies Keel's remarks and the concrete examples he provides, the more convincing some of his arguments become. Crocodiles, for example, are quite common on scarabs of the Middle Bronze Age and a few of the designs in which they appear do seem to have specific meaning. An excellent "reading" of this type is of the design on a Megiddo scarab showing couchant lions facing outward and flanking a winged sun disc rising on the horizon, the whole group surmounting a crocodile. Keel interprets the crocodile as symbolic of the primeval water out of which the morning sun appears (?534 and fig. 348), which seems quite plausible. On a Gezer scarab (?535 and fig. 512), human figures with crocodile and falcon heads flank a palm, the group symbolizing the primeval ocean (croco- dile), the sky (falcon), with the earth (palm) between. I do not think, nor does Keel, that all crocodiles should be interpreted in this way, but it is of interest that certain designs do give evidence of symbolism clearly in keeping with Egyptian beliefs, designs which can sometimes be paralleled elsewhere in Egyptian art. Human figures represent a large category of motifs, already divided by Tufnell into many sub-types based on their position (standing, kneeling) and what, if anything. they may hold in their hand (e.g., palm, flower, cobra). Keel adds several new sub-types both to further clarify Tufnell's system and to account for new ones in his much larger corpus. He makes some interesting observa- tions here. Human figures holding a lotus/papyrus appear earlier than those holding a branch; the latter is an Asiatic motif, since women holding branches are frequent on Old Syrian cylinder seals (?561). A standing figure accom- panied by the anra-sign is derived from Middle Kingdom name-and-title seals. A standing woman holding a lotus is of Egyptian origin, a standing man holding a lotus is derived from Asiatic cylinder seals (?562). A stand- ing human holding nothing and with both arms hanging downward is of Egyptian origin, a standing figure with one or both arms raised in adoration or in a dancing ges- ture is of Asiatic origin (?564). I have some doubt that such distinctions can always be supported. One might just as reasonably argue that the motif of a standing male holding a lotus on the cylinder seals is a local adaptation of an Egyptian original (as Tessier 1996: 108). Further- more, dancing figures are represented everywhere in an- cient art as part of a universal aspect of religious ritual. The inspiration here could as easily have been Egyptian as Asiatic. A similarly thorough examination is accorded to dei- ties represented on seal-amulets, both in their anthro- pomorphic form and represented by names only, with discussions of the positions such figures take along with their many attributes (??580-93). As Keel correctly points out, it is not true that anthropomorphic figures of Egyp- tian deities appear first in the New Kingdom; Hapi, Heh, and Ptah are found on seal-amulets before this time. Ptah is shown far more frequently in the New Kingdom, second in popularity only to Amon, who himself is com- pletely absent, both in figure and name, before Dynasty XVIII. The large number of seal-amulets representing Amon found in Palestine-90 examples with his figure and name, 360 with his name only (?642)-is due to the spread of the Egyptian Empire as well as to the pres- ence of an Amon temple at Gaza. While no Amon temple was actually discovered at this site, or anywhere else in 677</page><page sequence="6">Journal of the American Oriental Society 117.4 (1997) Palestine for that matter, there is indirect evidence that such temples did exist (Uehlinger 1990). One of the goals of a catalogue of any genre of artifact is to assign to individual pieces a probable date, a sub- ject Keel takes up in some detail (??653-94). In gen- eral, he dates each object to the time it was certainly or probably made rather than to the archaeological context per se in which it was found. There are many reasons for this: small objects tend to get displaced by natural causes or moder carelessness; they can be retained as heirlooms or found in antiquity and reused at a later date; there was an archaizing tendency in the manufac- ture of seal-amulets during the New Kingdom. Thus, we must often fall back on judging the date by typology, engraving techniques, general style, and so on. Since there are few scarab groups that can be assigned absolute dates, even with Keel's exhaustive analysis of typology, absolute dating is not often achievable. This is a partic- ularly acute problem for the Middle Bronze Age. While Keel's absolute dates for the MB IIA, B, and C phases are reasonably close to those of the so-called "high chro- nology" defended by Dever and myself (Ward and De- ver 1994), there is a significant difference in the dating of specific groups, and this bears on the important ques- tion of when scarabs began to appear in Palestine. Keel accepts the Montet Jar group as the oldest dat- able find of scarabs in the Levant and adopts an early Dynasty XII date (?683). However, he places the scarabs from Ruweis6 (Sidon) Tomb 66 in early Dynasty XIII rather than early XII (?684), suggesting that the scarab of Sesostris I in that group is a later intrusion or of post- mortem manufacture and that the typological features of these scarabs can indicate either an early XII or early Dynasty XIII date. The key here is the Sesostris I scarab, and I see no reason why this cannot be considered con- temporary, other than it invalidates the low chronologies supported by Bietak, O'Connor, and others, and there- fore has to be explained away. I prefer taking this piece and the scarab from Ruweis6 Tomb 73 naming Sesostris II at face value as an indication that these burials are of earlier Dynasty XII. Contra Keel's short note on the scar- abs from the Tel Aviv Harbor Cemetery (?685), not all of them come from MB IIA or IIA/B burials, so Keel's early Dynasty XIII date cannot apply to the whole col- lection. Unfortunately, there is bound to be some differ- ence of opinion on these and similar groups until some undisputed evidence is discovered in Egypt or Palestine. I get the impression that, under the influence of Bietak's analysis of the chronology at Tell ed-Dab'a, Keel and others see Egyptian influence in Palestine more as a phe- nomenon of Dynasty XIII rather than XII. This involves a complex set of problems that cannot be investigated in the present context, though I am presently more com- fortable with the earlier date. Keel's final essay on the practical, religious, and political significance of seal-amulets (??721-27) is a concise summary of the uses to which these objects were put and what meaning they may have had to those who owned them. Beyond such obvious functions as offer- ing protection against all manner of evils, ensuring good health, and the like, and making impressions to establish ownership or to "sign" documents, there are other uses. Private-name seals, for example, often have funerary ep- ithets and should be considered part of an individual's funerary equipment. It is of interest that one-fifth of the private-name scarabs found in Palestine include such fu- nerary epithets; Keel considers these to be imports, indi- cating that this funerary aspect of scarabs did not apply in Palestine. This, of course, raises the issue as to why Egyptian private-name seals should have found their way to Palestine in the first place. Keel suggests that those seals naming higher officials were imports, while those of minor functionaries were taken there by their owners, implying that these men were in Palestine on official business of the Egyptian state. He wisely refrains from espousing Helck's "antiquities trade" theory, by which the presence of Egyptian Middle Kingdom material in both Nubia and Palestine is explained as plunder from Egyp- tian sites during the Hyksos period (Helck 1976; but see Ward 1979 and Scandone-Matthiae 1984). Seal-amulets with figures or names of deities and rul- ers must have been produced in temples and palaces to be purchased by individuals as votives or personal amu- lets. Both uses are amply proved by groups of these ob- jects found in temples and burials. Keel suggests that motifs such as the "naked goddess" and deities wielding weapons are miniature reproductions of statues in tem- ples, reproductions that a devotee could wear as a sym- bol of personal adherence to a specific cult. Such was the case in Egypt, and the idea that typically Canaanite motifs represented loyalty to a Canaanite cult parallels the Egyptian use of scarabs naming, for example, Ptah, signifying loyalty to that deity. This is certainly possi- ble and takes such motifs beyond the realm of pure art into that of personal religion. Keel thus offers a purpose for such designs that makes sense. He seems also to apply the same principle to the very common occur- rence of Amon on seal-amulets found in Palestine. He is not, I think, suggesting a widespread Amon cult among Canaanites, but rather local acceptance of the chief cult of their Egyptian overlords, a practice not at all foreign to polytheistic religious systems. Keel also explains the unique "toga-wearer" motif in a similar fashion. These are local rulers whose followers 678</page><page sequence="7">WARD: A New Reference Work in Seal-Amulets carried amulets portraying their princes much as Egyp- tians wore amulets loyally portraying Egyptian kings. Egyptian soldiers and officials on duty in Canaan may well have carried such amulets signifying loyalty to the crown, perhaps a better explanation for the appearance of Egyptian royal-name scarabs in Canaan than trade. Scarabs may also be symbolic of the deities these sol- diers and officials served. Keel points out the interesting fact that the four Egyptian deities most often portrayed on seal-amulets of Late Bronze Palestine-Amon. Re, Ptah, and Seth-are precisely the protective deities of the four Egyptian battalions at the Battle of Qadesh. This intriguing suggestion, noted almost in passing, is well worth following up, since here is at least one reason why Egyptian deities are so prominent in the Canaanite repertoire. As stated at the beginning of this review, no volume with the scope of Keel's Einleitung can escape some criticism of some detail or other or disagreement about some conclusion. But we now have a true reference work, the result of many years of meticulous research on the part of Keel and his colleagues which, with the catalogue volume to follow, represents a genuine new beginning in the study of seal-amulets. Not only is this a solid and dependable source of information, there are two areas here that promise positive future results. First, Keel has now proved beyond doubt that local Palestin- ian production of these objects in an Egyptianizing style is fact rather than theory. Second, he has taken on the complex task of attempting to explain what Egyptian symbols may have meant in a foreign culture. The lat- ter subject is still in its infancy, but Keel's research will inevitably show the way to a better understanding. This is a superb volume. REFERENCES Baines, J. 1975.
