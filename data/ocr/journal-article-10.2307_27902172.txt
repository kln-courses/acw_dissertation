<plain_text><page sequence="1">A CURIOUS BLINDSPOT IN THE ANGLO AMERICAN TRADITION OF ANTITHEISTIC ARGUMENT Theistic philosophers often tend to assume an inferiority com plex attitude of defensiveness in the face of antitheistic argument. They know that their own traditions of argumentation can easily fall into a repetitive rut by failing to incorporate the new insights or adjust to the new challenges of ongoing contemporary philoso phy. But they tend to take it for granted that antitheistic argu mentation will almost by definition be up-to-date, alert, freshly minted, using the best tools of the latest thought. I would like to submit that antitheistic traditions too can fall into a traditional rut of out-of-date, already discredited, or no longer relevant arguments. They too can become turned in on themselves and self-repetitive, tilting at long dead, if ever existent, adversaries. One of the most striking examples of this, to my mind, is to be found in one Anglo-American tradition of antitheistic argument. I am referring to one of the most widely and persistently repeated critiques of the so-called cosmological argument for the existence of God. Strange to say, it does not seem to occur with anything like the same frequency in the continental European tradition. And the reason seems to be precisely that it is a tradition, handed down among Anglo-Saxon philosophers from well-defined sources, accord ing to a well-established family tradition, and apparently never seriously reexamined even up to the present date. In the interests of good philosophical argument and fruitful dialogue, for the benefit of both sides, I would like in the present article to expose the ghost of this curiously long-lived red herring, in the hopes of laying it to rest once and for all among serious philosophical circles. There are all too many weighty philosophical objections to proofs for the existence of God, as it is, for us to waste time on irrelevant ones. Exposition of the Tradition Let me introduce this traditional Anglo-American critique in the words of one of its best known and most influential contempo rary proponents, Bertrand Russell:</page><page sequence="2">182 W. NORRIS CLARKE The First-Cause Argument Perhaps the simplest and easiest to understand is the argu ment of the First Cause. (It is maintained that everything we see in this world has a cause, and as you go back in the chain of causes further and further you must come to a First Cause, and to that First Cause you give the name of God.) . . . The philoso phers and the men of science have got going on cause, and it has not anything like the vitality it used to have; but, apart from that, you can see that the argument that there must be a First Cause is one that cannot have any validity ... If everything must have a cause, then God must have a cause. If there can be any thing without a cause, it may just as well be the world as God, so there cannot be any validity in that argument. It is exactly of the same nature as the Hindu's view, that the world rested upon an elephant and the elephant rested upon a tortoise; and when they said, 'How about the tortoise?' the Indian said, 'Suppose we change the subject.' The argument is really no better than that.1 Russell's critique is, of course, impregnable. Either one takes seriously the principle that every being has a cause, and then one must apply it to God too, thus going on forever, no nearer to a solution of our original problem about this world, or else one should never raise the question at all, and merely accept the exis tence of the world as a brute given fact. Russell is by no means the originator of this critique, nor does he claim to be. He recounts in the same book, and also in his account of his mental development in the Schilpp "Library of Living Philosophers" volume, how as a young man his own belief in the First-Cause argument was rudely shattered by reading the young John Stuart Mill's rejection of it: I may say that when I was a young man and was debating these questions very seriously in my mind, I for a long time ac cepted the argument of the First Cause, until one day, at the age of eighteen, I read John Stuart Mill's Autobiography, and I there found this sentence: 'My father taught me that the question "Who made me?" cannot be answered, since it immediately suggests the further question "Who made God?" ' That very simple sentence showed me, as I still think, the fallacy in the argument of the First Cause.2 1 Why I Am Not a Christian (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1957), pp. 6-7. 2 Ibid., p. 6; see also The Philosophy of Bertrand Russell, ed. P. Schilpp (New</page><page sequence="3">BLINDSPOT IN THE ANTITHEISTIC ARGUMENT 183 Neither was Mill's father, James Mill, the originator of the objection. As far as I can discover, the first well-known proponent of it was, as might be expected, the fertile critical mind of David Hume: I shall prove that there is no ground to suppose a plan of the world to be formed in the divine mind. ... It is not easy, I own, to see what is gained by this supposition. . . . We are still obliged to mount higher, in order to find the cause of this cause, which you had assigned as satisfactory and conclusive. . . . How therefore shall we satisfy ourselves concerning the cause of that Being, whom you suppose the Author of Nature, or, according to your system of anthropomorphism, the ideal world into which you trace the material? Have we not the same reason to trace that ideal world into another world, or new intelligent principle? But if we stop and go no farther; why go so far? Why not stop at the material world? How can we satisfy ourselves without going on in in fini timi? And after all, what satisfaction is there in that infinite pro gression? Let us remember the story of the Indian philosopher and his elephant. It was never more applicable than to the pres ent subject. ... It were better, therefore, never to look beyond the present material world. . . . When you go one step beyond the mundane system, you only excite an inquisitive humor, which it is impossible ever to satisfy. . . . The first step, which we make, leads us on forever.3 The basic principle, "Every being has a cause," is not mentioned here explicitly. But it is clearly operating implicitly and controlling the reasoning, for if one did not suppose it, one would have no right to carry on the causal inquiry in infinitum. Either every being has a cause, or why demand it of any? Part of the effectiveness, however, of Hume's critiques on the ordinary reader may perhaps lie in this, that he so often leaves implicit the full set of premises at work. At any rate, Bertrand Russell has brought all the premises clearly out into the open and has formulated the critique as cleanly and neatly as could be desired. The lineage of the argument is therefore clear York: Tudor, 1951 [now published by the Open Court Publishing Co. of La Salle, 111.]), p. 8.

Burtt (New York: Modern Library, 1939), pp. 714-15.</page><page sequence="4">184 W. NORRIS CLARKE in its main lines: from Hume through Mill to Russell in our own day. From Russell, or perhaps independently of him, it has spread to a considerable number of contemporary agnostic thinkers influ enced in one way or another by this tradition. Let me give a few recent examples from widely read and influential books. The first is from the widely used and in many ways highly competent textbook by John Hospers, An Introduction to Philosophical Analysis, now in its second edition, several of whose chapters, notably those on "Matter and Life" and "Mind and Body," I have often used myself for their lucid analysis and critical acumen. Thus I am picking out this book precisely because it is in many other respects such a good book and its author a respected analytic philosopher. In his chapter on God he puts forward the following as a succinct summation of the "traditional" cosmological argument for the existence of God: The cosmological argument proceeds from the fact that the uni verse, or cosmos, exists. . . . Look around you at the universe, one might say?the millions of stars and galaxies, the vast array of living things, the panorama of human life. Some being must have produced all this?and who or what could have produced it but God? More succinctly stated, the argument says: Everything has a cause. If this is so, then the universe itself must have a cause. That cause is God. Therefore, God exists.4 The author's critical comments are as clear and explicit as could be desired, rubbing the point in until no one could miss it, and demonstrably inspired by the Hume-Russell tradition we have been tracing: Let us, however, assume that we can admit the question 'Does the universe as a whole have a cause?' Now suppose we answer 'God.' Then comes the inevitable next question: 'But what caused God?' Many children ask this question, to the great embarrass ment of their parents. But the question is perfectly legitimate: After all, we have just been told that everything has a cause, and if that is true, then God too must have a cause. And if God does not have a cause, then it is not true that everything has a cause. 4 John Hospers, An Introduction to Philosophical Analysis, 2d ed. (Englewood Cliffs: Prentice-Hall, 1967), p. 429.</page><page sequence="5">BLINDSPOT IN THE ANTITHEISTIC ARGUMENT 185 It would seem, then, that the causal argument is not merely invalid but self-contradictory: the conclusion, which says that some thing (God) does not have a cause, contradicts the premise, which says that everything does have a cause. If that premise is true, the conclusion cannot be true; and if the conclusion is true, the premise cannot be. Many people do not at once see this be cause they use the argument to get to God, and then, having ar rived at where they want to go, they forget all about the argument. . . . But consistency requires us to think further: if the conclusion contradicts its own premise, we have the most damning indictment of any argument that we could possibly have: that it is self contradictory. 'But,' one might object, don't mean that every thing has a cause?I mean that everything except God has a cause.' But why do we stop at just this point? If we stop somewhere, why not stop with the universe itself? At least that is something of which we have experience and some knowledge.5 He then goes on to quote the identical passage of Hume which we have reproduced above. Again it must be abundantly clear to the reader that if such is the cosmological argument it is patently invalid?so patently, in fact, that it should have aroused the sus picions of its attackers. For, despite the amazing amount of am biguities and non-sequitur's strewn throughout the long history of philosophy, it is rare that philosophers of any sophistication have proposed patently self-contradictory arguments, such as this one surely is. But let us first complete our survey. Another even more widely used book by distinguished authors that has introduced thousands of students to philosophy presents the same argument and critique, but in a more confused form: One of the oldest arguments amounts essentially to the asser tion that nature . . . requires an explanation . . . Thus we must explain it by appealing to the concept of something supernatural. Nature could not have brought itself into being; it must have had some cause. Or the argument is sometimes stated in this manner: Any event whatever must have had some cause, it is a contradiction to say that anything brings itself into existence. But by the same reasoning, the cause is itself the effect of some previous cause. And so on back in the case of each preceding cause. Now this chain of causes must have had a beginning . . . There must consequently 5 Ibid., pp. 430-31.</page><page sequence="6">186 W. NORRIS CLARKE have been a first or ultimate cause, itself uncaused, responsible for the initiation of the series of events. This series of events is nature, and the first cause, God.6 The reader will note the unexplained shift in the course of the argument from the principle, 'Every event has a cause', to 'Every cause has a cause', which implicitly is another way of saying that every being has a cause. The authors now make their critique: The argument fails to give an adequate reason why, though every cause must allegedly have had a previous cause, the 'first' cause is excepted from this rule. To say that the rule applies only to natural causes is simply a restatement of the same point; for the question still remains. Why may we assume that the super natural requires no cause and is its own cause? The usual answer is that the supernatural is something incomprehensible?we can know that there must be such, but we cannot know what it is, we cannot know anything about it. The argument falls back on the presupposition of an unknowable reality with miraculous prop erties. . . . Difficulties of this kind indicate that an appeal to faith is sooner or later inevitable for supernaturalists who appeal to argument.7 The reader will note the main point on which this critique rests: the transition from 'Every event has a cause' to 'Every cause has a cause'. This can be justified only if either every cause is an event?a highly dubious proposition which no theistic philosopher (who is supposed to be proposing the argument) would admit?or if every being has a cause. This unexplained shift, however, is necessary if the traditional Hume-Russell coup de gr?ce is to be administered. The same unexplained and unjustified shift from 'Every event has a cause' to 'Every being has a cause' is not infrequently found in other contemporary writers. Thus even such a sophisticated thinker as Ronald Hepburn falls into the same pattern of exposi tion and criticism: 6J. Randall and J. Buchler, Philosophy: An Introduction (New York: Barnes and Noble, 1942), pp. 159-61. Ibid.</page><page sequence="7">BLINDSPOT IN THE ANTITHEISTIC ARGUMENT 187 The defender of the argument may reply: 'All that we have to know is that every event has a cause. We do know that; and it makes no difference what events we are talking about nor how hard it is to conceive the cause which they require. And so the world requires God as its cause. The argument is perfect ly sound.'8 After criticizing the obscurity in the principle, 'Every event has a cause', he then proceeds with the traditional objection: Suppose, however, that we allowed that the universe might in fact demand a cause. . . . Would this concession be enough to rid the Argument of its difficulties? Only if, for one thing, we could be sure that the being who caused the universe to exist did not himself require a cause of a still higher order. If every thing without exception demands a cause, then God must have his cause too. God, replies the Thomist, is the author of his own existence. But then, his critic can point out, here is an exception to the rule: not everything demands a cause, after all. And if this is so, how do I know that the world demands a cause, or everything in the world? Admit exceptions, and the Cosmological Argument at once loses its purchase.9 Another author, Elmer Sprague, tries to involve St. Thomas Aquinas himself in the same trap. In his famous Second Way for proving the existence of God, Thomas argues from the existence of a series of caused causes to an uncaused First Cause. In so doing he enunciates the principle, 'No being can be a cause of itself. Sprague seems to believe?to argue from his subsequent critique that this can be transposed logically into 'Every being has a cause'. He then proceeds with the traditional Hume-Russell critique we have seen before.10 The confusion is disastrous here. The proposi tion, 'No being can cause itself is in no way reducible to 'Every being has a cause', since implicit in the former is the qualifying proviso, 'No being which needs a cause (or if it needs a cause) can be the cause of itself. This obviously asserts nothing as to whether 8 Christianity and Paradox (London: Watts, 1958), p. 161. 9 Ibid., pp. 165-66. For another example, see H. Titus, Living Issues in Philosophy (New York: American Book Co., 1964), p. 435. 10 Elmer Sprague, What Is Philosophy? (New York: Oxford, 1961), pp. 58-64, esp. p. 63.</page><page sequence="8">188 W. NORRIS CLARKE every being requires a cause or not, but only that every one that does require a cause must be caused by another. It is as though one were to maintain that 'No man can be married to himself logically implies 'Every man is married*?an obvious non-sequitur. Further more, St. Thomas himself has explicitly rejected the 'Every being has a cause* principle: Now to be caused by another does not appertain to a being in asmuch as it is a being; otherwise every being would be caused by another, so that we should have to proceed to infinity in causes an impossibility, as was shown in Book I of this work.11 There is no need, I take it, to multiply indefinitely examples of the prevalence and tenacity of this tradition of interpretation and criticism of the cosmological argument. We are here dealing with a clear-cut case of a tradition of antitheistic argument which keeps perpetuating itself by family inheritance without renewal from outside and, as we shall see, without any effort to ascertain whether the antagonists at whom the salvos are regularly fired are still there any more. In fact, this tradition has been so much taken for granted by Anglo-Saxon philosophers that we occasionally find it accepted without question even by theistic philosophers who are themselves critical of traditional proofs. Thus Prof. H. D. Lewis, in his other wise excellent book, Our Experience of God, before laying out his own approach of a one-step insight into the exigency of the infinite in the finite, criticizes briefly the traditional formal arguments. He says of the First Cause argument: "If, for example, we appeal to the traditional 'first cause' argument, we invite the rejoinder that, on our premiss that everything must have a cause, the alleged 'first cause' must have a cause as well."12 The Blindspot in the Tradition Now let us examine this classic critique. Let it first be agreed without qualification that if one does admit the principle 'Every being has a cause', then the refutation is inescapable and devastat ing. But the very ease of this refutation, if nothing else, should have 11 Summa contra Gentes, Bk. II, ch. 52, . 5 in trans, of A.

And it is in itself a highly suspicious fact that no one among the many in this Hume-Russell tradition whom I have read ever quotes any specific theistic philosopher who does make use of it. So constant is this pattern, in fact, that I am willing to wager that this family trait is found also in those I have not yet run across. What are the facts? I submit that this long-intrenched tradition of antitheistic argument is completely out of touch with the actual reality of the theistic tradition it is supposed to be attacking. And this is the case for the simple reason that no reputable theistic philosopher (understanding 'reputable' in a very broad sense as intending to exclude primarily the popular apologist who is not a trained philosopher), at least since about the fourth century A.D., has actually proposed such a principle as 'Every being has a cause' in the sense understood by the Hume-Russell tradition, i.e. every thing is caused by another being. Thomas Aquinas, in fact, certain ly one of the leading representatives of the causal argument tradi tion, explicitly repudiates the principle, as we have seen; nor has any other scholastic philosopher ever used it. It would, in fact, make no sense for any theistic philosopher who knows what he is doing to subscribe to such a principle. It goes directly counter to the whole aim and meaning of the enterprise of metaphysical causal explana tion. In fact, I do not see how any philosopher of whatever persua sion, theistic or not, could propose any evidence for such a proposi tion, though he could, of course, make a postulatory assertion of it, or add some qualifier such as: every being in our experience has a cause. In what follows I shall first examine what the causal principle is which actually functions in traditional cosmological or First Cause arguments for the existence of God, and how in general it func tions. Then I shall take up the historical question of how the misunderstanding of it by the Hume-Russell tradition might have arisen. The Causal Principle in Theistic Argument The reason why no reputable theistic philosopher either has used or could possibly use the proposition 'Every being has a cause'</page><page sequence="10">190 W. NORRIS CLARKE as a premise for arguing to God as First Cause is that the acceptance of such a principle exhibits a complete misunderstanding of the whole context, meaning, and purpose of causal inquiry in meta physics (as distinct from the special restricted meaning and use of causality in modern scientific inquiry, where it is more or less equivalent to lawful predictability). In traditional causal analysis, on which the cosmological argument is based, the general procedure is as follows: The context of inquiry is the search for the intelligi bility or sufficient reason of the beings of our experience. This involves a prior commitment of the inquiring mind to the principle of the intelligibility of being, often formulated as the principle of sufficient reason: 'Every being must have the sufficient reason for its existence somewhere in being, i.e. either in itself or in another being (or set of beings) \ Just how one arrives at acceptance of or commitment to this fundamental principle underlying all explana tory inquiry of any sort is not our present concern.13 It should be noted, however, that since this exigency for intelligibility is a func tion of the inquiring mind at work, its meaning can be defined more precisely only in function of the particular relevant questions which the mind judges reasonable to raise in a particular horizon or context of inquiry. Next, the inquiring mind applies this general exigency of intel ligibility to some particular data, some being or set of beings, of its experience. If it finds the latter positively lacking in intelligibility, defective in sufficient reason (i.e. not just, I do not happen to understand them, but I see that they cannot measure up to the exigency of intelligibility I reasonably bring to bear on them here) if taken by themselves alone?i.e. as hypothetically self-sufficient or self-explanatory?then it postulates that they must have their suffi cient reason, their objective ground of intelligibility, in some other being (s), which is thereby termed its "cause," or that which is responsible for its actual existence, either totally or in some respect. The type of cause taken for granted here, unless otherwise specified, 13 See my own articles, "Analytic Philosophy and Language about God," in Christian Philosophy and Religious Renewal, ed. G. McLean (Washington: Catholic University of America Press, 1966), pp. 39-73; and "How the Philosopher Gives Meaning to Language about God," in the challenging symposium, The Idea of God: Philosophical Perspectives (Buffalo: University of Buffalo Press, 1969), pp. 1-27.</page><page sequence="11">BLINDSPOT IN THE ANTITHEISTIC ARGUMENT 191 is the primary type, the so-called efficient cause, that by which some thing is made to be or given being in whatever way it needs as non self-sufficient being.14 The notion of cause, therefore, is not at all the same as that of sufficient reason. The latter simply means adequate ground of intel ligibility, and applies to all being; it can be verified either in the being itself under inquiry?which is then termed 'self-sufficient', 'self-explanatory', or 'self-accounting-for'?or in another being (s) ?which is then termed its 'cause'. The notion of cause is thus more restricted in meaning, as one of two possible modes of answer to the quest for sufficient reason or intelligibility. The question of a cause for some being arises only in a context of inquiry where the being in question turns out to be somehow defective in its internal intel ligibility when taken by itself, not self-sufficient for some specified reason. Then alone does the search for an adequate cause, its sufficient reason in another being (s), arise at all and take on mean ing. It follows from all this that until some clearly evidenced defi ciency in intelligibility is discovered in a being, it simply lacks meaning to ask, 'What is its cause?' since the necessary premise for the meaningfulness of the causal question is lacking. Hence all causal principles of the form, 'Every X has a cause', must, to make sense, specify under the X some kind of being which is judged to be somehow defective in intelligibility by itself alone. Thus for Aris totle the causal principle would be, 'Every being which comes into existence or undergoes change requires a cause'. In another meta physical system where finitude is seen as more fundamental than change, as is the case for Thomas Aquinas, the principle could be broadened to 'Every finite, or composed, or participated, being requires a cause'. Or one could enunciate a purely formal all inclusive principle such as, 'Every contingent being requires a cause'. To avoid the logical complications of possible and necessary being implied in the strict conception of 'contingent' as that which can be or not be, the opposite of 'necessary', I and many others (following Aquinas' implicit practice) prefer the absolutely general 14 For the origin of the philosophical notion of cause, see H. Boeder, "Origine et pr?histoire de la notion philosophique de 1 ," Revue des sciences phil. et th?ol, 40 (1956), 421-43.</page><page sequence="12">192 W. NORRIS CLARKE and formal 'Every being which does not have its sufficient reason in itself requires a cause*. It follows, of course, that it literally makes no sense, within this tradition of the complementary meanings of 'cause* and 'sufficient reason* (where something that does not have its sufficient reason in itself must have it in another being or beings which is then called its 'cause'), to ask why the world cannot be self-caused, if God is self caused. For the very term 'self-caused* would be a contradiction in terms. If 'cause', on the other hand, is taken to mean merely 'sufficient reason*, then there is no difficulty in calling something 'self-caused*. But the reason why the world is asserted to be not self caused is precisely that it has been shown not to contain its own sufficient reason within itself. One can, of course, use any meaning of 'cause* he wishes to. But one cannot mix two mutually exclusive meanings at once in the exposition of another's argument and then maintain that the argument does not hold. Accordingly, to enunciate a principle such as 'Every being has a cause* would either be meaningless or would imply the prior judg ment that every being in the universe is somehow defective in intelligibility, not self-sufficient. How any philosopher could arrive at the latter conclusion?since it could hardly be a self-evident principle?is to say the least obscure, if not in principle impossible. But it would be particularly unintelligible for a theistic philoso pher to do so, since he would be eliminating ahead of time the very possibility of the existence of the being he is trying to prove, God as the self-sufficient being or First Cause. The whole point of the causal inquiry as applied to the argument for the existence of God is to pursue the search for intelligibility from the non-self-sufficient being from which it started, back through non-self-sufficient causes, to some ultimate self-sufficient cause, which is called 'God*, in which alone the causal inquiry can come to an end, and without which the fundamental principle of sufficient reason itself would have to be abandoned. To have reached this point of the affirma tion of a self-sufficient being and then to ask what is the cause of this being would simply make no sense, since in a self-sufficient being there is lacking by definition any basis for even raising the question of cause, though the question of sufficient reason still applies, since it allows of the answer "self-sufficient." We can only conclude, then, that the Hume-Russell tradition of</page><page sequence="13">BLINDSPOT IN THE ANTITHEISTIC ARGUMENT 193 antitheistic argument, on this point at least, somehow got off to a bad start by completely misunderstanding and misrepresenting the very argument it was trying to refute, and that it has continued to repeat itself ever since, talking only to itself, and without ever both ering to inquire whether the supposed other party to the debate was still there at all, or had ever been there. In a word, it has become a tradition in the worst sense of the word, truly in a rut and apparently unaware of it. Historical Origins of the 'Every Being Has a Cause9 Principle How could such a tradition of misinterpretation have ever got ten started in the first place? Has anything like it ever been formu lated, which could have given Hume the occasion for his critique? If we turn to ancient philosophy, we find that, although it cannot be found in any ancient metaphysicians, such as Plato and Aristotle, it does seem to have been accepted by some lesser thinkers. Thus Lactantius, a Christian writer of the early fourth century, whose philosophical ability is definitely below par, quotes approvingly Seneca as saying, "God made himself (ipse se fecit)/9 which would seem to presuppose that everything is made by something. Lac tantius then goes on to make the following astonishing philosoph ical assertion in his own right: "Since it is impossible for anything that exists not to have at some time begun to exist, it follows that, when nothing else existed before Him, He [God] was procreated from himself before all things (ex se ipso sit procreatus)."1^ It was for reasons such as these, among others, we might add, that Lac tantius was never numbered among the Fathers of the Church. St. Augustine firmly outlawed once and for all for succeeding Christian thought any such notion as God's making himself and with it any principle such as 'Every being has a cause* in the strong meaning of cause.16 Yet even among these ancient thinkers, to do them justice, there was none who held that every being is caused by another being, as Hume's critique really demands. 15 Lactantius, Divinae Institutiones, II, 7 (ed. CSEL, XIX, 128). For some other early figures who spoke of God as "making himself" see my article on "Aseity" in the New Catholic Encyclopedia (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1967), I, 945-47. 16 Trinitate, I, 1, 1: trans. Stephen McKenna, On the Trinity, Fathers of the Church series (Washington: Catholic Univ. of America Press, 1963), pp. 3-4.</page><page sequence="14">194 W. NORRIS CLARKE The next time something like this principle occurs in the history of Western philosophy is with Descartes, Spinoza, and the rationalist school. In his Third Meditation Descartes had spoken of God as in a sense self-caused (causa sui), related to himself somewhat like the relation of an efficient cause to its effect. Both Caterus in the First Objections and Arnauld in the Fourth Objections take him sharply to task for this type of expression, insisting on the classical meaning of efficient cause as always distinct from its effect. Descartes makes two rather complicated defenses of his position and language, in which he at least apparently changes his terminology and the mean ing of 'cause* several times during his sinuous replies. Here we do find clearly enough stated at least twice the proposition that every being has a cause, or that it can be asked of every being what is its cause or reason for existing. Descartes insists that one be allowed to ask such questions even of God in the process of arguing to Him; otherwise one could never rise to the discovery of Him as self originating First Cause. But it seems to me self-evident that everything that exists springs either from a cause or from itself considered as a cause; for, since we understand not only what existence is, but also what negation of existence is, we cannot feign that anything exists per se as to which no reason can be given regarding why it exists rather than does not exist; hence there is no reason for not in terpreting self-originated in the sense in which it implies causal power, that power, to wit, which passes all bounds . . . found in God alone.17 Moreover, the light of nature certainly tells us that nothing exists about which the question, why it exists, cannot be asked, whether we inquire for its efficient cause, or, if it does not possess one, demand why it does not have one. Hence, if I did not be lieve that anything could in some way be related to itself exactly as an efficient cause is related to its effect, so far should I be from concluding that any first cause existed, that, on the contrary, I should once more ask for the cause of that which had been called first, and so should never arrive at the first at all. But I frankly allow that something may exist in which there is such a great and inexhaustible power that it has needed no assistance in order to IT Meditations, Reply to First Objections; Philosophical Works, trans. Haldane and Ross (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1967), II, 16-17.</page><page sequence="15">BLINDSPOT IN THE ANTITHEISTIC ARGUMENT 195 exist, and requires none for its preservation, and hence is in a certain way the cause of its own existence; such a cause I under stand God to be.1? He then goes on to insist in the Reply to the Fourth Objections that we must be allowed to ask the universal question of efficient cause about God too; and it must be admitted that his words at least invite confusion: We shall not be able to pursue this proof with accuracy if we do not grant our mind the liberty of asking for an efficient cause in every case, even in that of God; for with what right should we exclude God, before we have proved that He exists? Hence in every single case we must inquire whether it is derived from it self or from something else; and indeed by this means the exis tence of God may be inferred.19 And again: For how could those who have not as yet known God enquire into the efficient cause of other things, in order thus to arrive at the knowledge of God, unless they believed that it was possible to enquire for the efficient cause of everything whatsoever? And how could they make God, as being the first cause, the end of their investigation, if they thought that things must in all cases have a cause distinct from themselves?20 Nonetheless, Descartes goes on to explain that he does not mean efficient cause in the strict sense of producing another, but rather something positive like efficient cause, whether you call it formal cause, sufficient reason, or what have you.21 It is clear that there is enough material in these sinuous answers of Descartes for an un sympathetic mind to pick up the principle 'Every being has a cause*. But what is also clear is that he himself understands it as 18 Ibid., p. 14. Note that the causal principle expressed here allows for a being's not having an efficient cause, though it must then have a reason why it needs no such cause. 19 Meditations, Reply to Fourth Objections: Haldane-Ross, II, 109. Note the at least verbal discrepancy here with note 18; here it is said that we can ask for the efficient cause of everything, including God; in the former text this was not jequired. 20 ibid., p. 114. 21 See both before and after the above texts in Replies I and IV.</page><page sequence="16">196 W. NORRIS CLARKE analogous, as shifting in meaning between efficient cause in the strict sense and the looser meaning of some positive sufficient rea son, and that he certainly does not understand it as implying that every being is caused by another being than itself. In fact, he formally denies this. Hence one can certainly not legitimately ob ject, as the Hume-Russell tradition does, that once one asks the question 'What is the cause of God?' one will be obliged to go on to another and so on forever.22 Descartes may well be accused of an unfortunate confusion in terminology between 'cause* and 'suffi cient reason'; but he certainly cannot be accused of a patent contradiction in logic. The same blending of cause and sufficient reason occurs even more pronouncedly in Spinoza, where cause itself tends to be con ceived on the model of the necessary relation of ideas flowing one from another. The notion of God as causa sui also persists in various modified forms down through much of the German idealist tradition. But there is no need for our purposes to explore further in detail this history, since the situations are basically analogous to the one we have just explored in Descartes and Spinoza. We are now in a position to see more clearly what Hume and his successors have done. They have taken a somewhat confused or ambiguous statement of the principle of sufficient reason, 'Every being has a cause, or sufficient reason, for its existence', from the rationalist tradition, where, understood as it was there, it would not be subject to the Humean critique of an endless regress. They have then reinterpreted it to mean only the strict classical sense of efficient cause as other than the effect it causes, which its proponents had actually repudiated; they next proceeded to demolish as contradic tory the argument for God in which this newly interpreted princi ple was supposed to function as key premise. Thus the First Cause argument for the existence of God which the Hume-Russell tradi tion so devastatingly attacks is indeed an inviable metaphysical monster. But it is a monster of their own fabrication, not that of 22 if the antitheist continued to object, "If you allow one being (God) to be self caused, why not allow the same to the world or any being in it?" Descartes could easily reply, first, that self-caused here does not mean bringing itself into existence from previous nonexistence, and secondly, that the starting point of the argument was precisely the discovery of some defect in a being that rendered it incapable of being self-caused or self-grounded.</page><page sequence="17">BLINDSPOT IN THE ANTITHEISTIC ARGUMENT 197 any reputable theistic philosopher. It is actually a kind of hybrid of both the traditional scholastic and Cartesian rationalist traditions, which would make sense in neither and be repudiated by both. Now it may be that Hume had some excuse for this in the ambiguity of Descartes' own terminology, and perhaps did not realize exactly what kind of hybrid he was constructing. But it is much harder to excuse his successors in this tradition, with all the resources of historical scholarship and linguistic analysis at their disposal, for perpetuating this confusion. The very fact that no one in this tradition ever quotes a specific theistic philosopher as source for the key principle, 'Every being has a cause*, should by itself have aroused the suspicions of the present-day descendants that some further investigation was called for. To sum up, the point I have tried to make is that we are here in the presence of a philosophical tradition that is truly in a self repetitive rut, a tradition that has long since ceased to look outside of itself to check with reality and see whether the adversary it so triumphantly and effortlessly demolishes really exists at all. I maintain that no such other party in the supposed dialogue actually exists, or ever existed in either medieval or modern times, and I challenge anyone to produce a bona fide instance among profes sional or recognized philosophers who use it in a theistic argument. If this is not possible, as I feel certain is the case, then it would seem to be high time that those who still follow this particular tradition of antitheistic argument should have the grace and humility to acknowledge that their argument is dead, and let us get on with more substantive problems with regard to philosophical argument for and against the existence of God. The Substantive Question Remaining Lest this article appear too negative, I would like to conclude by proposing what does seem to me to be one of the most profoundly substantive issues in the legitimacy of any attempt to construct a philosophical proof for the existence of God. Let us suppose that for other good reasons the critics of the eosmological argument are right and that the argument is not conclusive. What then is the response to the question which the eosmological proof raised and was attempting to answer? This is the radical question of the adequate sufficient reason, the adequate</page><page sequence="18">198 W. NORRIS CLARKE intelligible grounding or explanation of the actual existence of the world of our experience, of the system of nature as a whole. I do not mean that one should start with the natural universe as a whole as an immediate datum of experience, which it is not, as Russell and other critics have well shown. One must start with some particular experienced beings as a datum. But once one draws them back through a series of causes into the system as a whole in the search for explanation, the question then inevitably arises: What about the existence of the interacting system as a whole (whether it is one or many unconnected systems does not matter) ? This is a question which those in the agnostic or antitheistic tradition simply refuse for the most part to raise, and all refuse to answer. Explanation for them consists in relating any particular item to be explained to other elements in the system, or by showing its place as a derivative of the system as a whole. But at this point the explanation stops. The question of the existence of the system itself as a whole is simply never asked. It is taken for granted as a sheer ultimate given about which no questions are legitimate. As Bertrand Russell has put it in his debate on the existence of God with Father Copleston: "I should say that the universe is just there, and that's all."23 Merleau-Ponty and others in the phenomenological tradition maintain that, because man is only a part of the whole, always presupposing the world as an indeterminate whole as the horizon of all his knowledge, and condemned by his historical spatio-temporal mode of being to a limited relative perspective on the whole, he can never raise questions?let alone answer them?about the whole as such, since that would presuppose an absolute viewpoint outside the whole, which is impossible for man.24 A small number of others in the agnostic tradition far more wise and sophisticated, it seems to me, are willing to concede that the question can be legitimately raised, and that it is a profound and significant one that can do us much good to ask. But it must remain 23 "A Debate on the Existence of God," in The Existence of God, ed. J. Hick (New York: Macmillan, 1964), p. 175. See also the discussion following my third article cited in note 13. 24 Cf. J. Bannan, "Merleau-Ponty on God," International Philosophical Quar terly, 6 (1966), 341-65; F.

Can or cannot the human intelligence legitimately raise the radical question about the very existence of the universe as a whole in which he lives? And if so, is there any legitimate schema or type of explanation which would render meaningful and possible an answer in the theistic sense? Personally, I believe that once one has taken full cognizance of the irreducibly polymorphic character of human consciousness and the unrestricted scope or illimitable horizon of its drive to know, then to attempt to limit the mind's ability to raise relevant questions to certain restricted types of explanation is to do violence to its nature. Hence not only can one not prevent someone from reasonably raising the question of the existence of the universe as a whole and its sufficient reason or ground, but to raise this question is the necessary fruition of the full conscious taking possession of one's intellectual dynamism in depth. With regard to the possibility of a meaningful answer, I believe again that there is a legitimate schema of explanation which can be used, though by its nature it resists reduction to the rigorous cogency of any formal logical proof. This is a strictly metaphysical postula tory type of explanation, whose general form is: Given radical commitment to the total intelligibility of being implicit in the acceptance of my mind's unrestricted desire to know, and given some concrete empirical datum or set of data which can be shown not to contain the adequate sufficient reason for their given exis tence in themselves, there must be in reality some entity such that it can do the job, fulfill the explanatory role called for by the other wise unsatisfiable exigency of the mind for intelligibility, in other words, be an adequate cause. It therefore must be and can be reason ably postulated both to exist and to possess all those?and only those?properties or attributes necessary for it to do its job. In a word, as Bernard Lonergan puts it: "If being is intelligible, then God exists. But being is intelligible. Therefore God exists."
