<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE AMERICAN CROW AND THE COMMON RAvEN. By Lawrence Kilham, illustrated by Joan Waltermire. Texas A&amp;M Univ. Press, College Station, Texas. 1989: 255 pp., Appendix of Scientific Names, 17 numbered figs., 8 tables. $29.50.-Lawrence Kilham absolutely loves corvids. This book is obviously a labor of love about the behaviors of crows which is divided into four unequal sections. The first two parts provide detailed descriptions of his observations of the behaviors of wild American Crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) both in Florida and New Hampshire. The second section concludes with Dr. Kilham's notes and remembrances of hand-raising a crow, "Crowsy." The third part of the book is a rather rambling description of crow behavior in general which speculates on some possible evo- lutionary origins, associations, and aspects of crow social systems. Part four of the book concerns Common Ravens (C. corax) in the wild and the hand-raising of a young crippled Raven, "Raveny." There are several chapters associated with each section. Each chapter is comprised of very detailed qualitative descriptions of the observations Dr. Kilham made concerning particular aspects of behaviors (e.g., varieties of foraging), and then a discussion in which the author, with a liberal use of literature citations, draws analogies to similar behaviors in other corvids, other avians, and perhaps other vertebrates, which usually includes wolves (Canis lupus) and humans (Homo sapiens). It is in these discussion sections that Dr. Kilham's scientific background is demonstrated, and also these areas that form the basis for a fatal flaw in the book. This flaw may lead the casual reader and the dedicated amateur to incorrectly conclude that she/he is reading scientific literature. The preface of the book tells the reader that statistics are not necessarily useful in trying to understand animals. Yet in each discussion section strong evolutionary correlations are drawn between the crow or raven behavior and similar behaviors in other organisms. I suggest that venturing such relationships demands the use of some statistical support. To suggest the notion that avian behavior has a peculiar place in science that does not rely on statistics does not give proper legitimacy to the field. To the professional ornithologist, the descriptions of the behaviors have little meaning. There is no flow. There is little context. There is not nearly the amount of quantitative detail to allow the descriptions to be useful. For example, Chapter 4 (Territory and Food Storing), begins with a brief description of 47 territorial encounters between 1981 and 1983. The description references a pen and ink drawing which adds no detail nor clarity to the description. To have some value, the professional ornithologist needs to have some idea of the length of each encounter, the behaviors of each of the participants and the periodicity of the encounters (time of year, time of day, period since the last encounter etc.) for the description. I fear an amateur might find this description engaging and then mistakenly infer that it is a scientific observation due to the detail and scientific context of the writing. Throughout the book, the behavioral descriptions are liberally laced with anthropomor- phic terminology (e.g., use of weapons, fooling, small talk, respect, etc.). Although a non-</page><page sequence="2">160 THE WILSON BULLETIN * Vol. 103, No. 1, March 1991 scientific book could make such depictions, the overriding tone of this book suggests that anthropomorphic descriptions are scientifically permitted. In summary, I can not determine who should read this book. It is not one that should be on the professional shelf of an ornithologist. The amateur must be wary of the book also. It has a prevailing style of scientific veracity which may deceive the unsuspecting amateur into the pitfalls that field biologists and behaviorists have been successfully climbing out of for the last dozen years.-RICHARD B.
