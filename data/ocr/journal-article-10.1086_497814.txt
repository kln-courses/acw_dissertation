They may all be taken literally as kinetic operations but also as gestural imitations signaling mental or linguistic operations, so that “rec- ollection” comes to mean calling something to mind, and “handing down” the oral or scriptural transmission of  words and phrases to future genera- tions. Since this set of  terms apparently forms a consistent whole, a kind of  device, one may ask how it operates in specific domains of  society: what it does and what it pretends to do? It would be anachronistic to evoke etymology, originally understood as a search for ultimate truth, as a means of  purifying academic vocabulary. In this essay, however, the etymological endeavor has some undeniable heuristic advantages, for it principally sets out to understand how certain The preparation of  this essay was made possible through a generous grant from the Swedish Foundation for International Cooperation in Research and Higher Education, which enabled me to spend the 2003–2004 academic year at the University of  Chicago.

Such an in- stance of  self-referentiality may also be referred to as exegesis, which I take to mean an interpretation that remains an inherent part of  the system it interprets. Cicero is consequently an exegete insofar as he dwells on the significance of  Roman customs, whereas approaches to Germanic cus- toms in the writings of  Caesar and Tacitus would belong to the area of  in- terpretatio. Indeed all analytical concepts employed in order to highlight other concepts or phenomena within the same system could be conceived as exegetical tools. We should keep in mind, however, that the distinc- tion between intrinsic and extrinsic interpretation is in itself  the outcome of  interpretation. Furthermore, the very need for an exegesis, for an inter- pretation by and for the system, is indicative of  the difficulty in deciding when and where a system ends or passes into another one. Nevertheless, every concept has a tradition of  its own, and not even the most idiosyn- cratic definitions can resist this tradition. A final task of  this essay is to test the applicability of  the semantic field uncovered in Greek and Latin literature to similar instances of  self- referentiality in societies outside the ancient Mediterranean world. This will be done in the hope that correspondences may help to prepare the ground for further theorizing. i. religio, thrEskeía, and anámnEsis It is well known that the original sense of  the term religio was already a matter of  dispute among classical authors. Most important among these are Cicero, who derived it from relego, “to pick up again, to go back over, retrace (a path), to transverse an area again,” and the Christian author Lac- tantius (third and fourth century), who derived it from religo, “to restrain with bonds, bind fast.” The etymology is usually presented as uncertain in modern dictionaries. Neither of  the two suggestions could easily be dis- missed as folk etymology or educated fancy. It should be kept in mind, however, that both Cicero and Lactantius presented their etymologies for obvious rhetorical, apologetic reasons. Cicero did it in an attempt to defend the scrupulous and dutiful attitude toward the cultus deorum as opposed to the excess and foolishness of  superstitio. He saw religio as a matter of  proper conduct, rejecting at the same time many of  the beliefs associated with the gods being worshipped. Lactantius, on the other hand, proposed his etymology in defense of  the pious relation (uinculum pietatis) between man and God in contrast to Cicero’s rather technical attitude toward ritual. It was in the sense proposed by Lactantius that the term re- ligio became uniquely associated with Christianity, and the characteristics of  this unprecedented institution still inform contemporary approaches to </page> <page sequence="3">                                                                                      History of Religions 3 religion as a universal category. No matter which one of  these etymologies appears the most plausible from the point of  view of  contemporary schol- arship, one cannot help noticing a conflict between two different systems of  belief. These were defended, on the one hand, by a Roman intellectual still paying attention to the prescriptions of  an open-ended, indigenous tradition and, on the other hand, by a Christian relying on the newly re- vealed, monolithic message of  the only true God. The pagan past of  the term religio may have afflicted it with associations that would have ap- peared improper or obsolete to a Christian. In Le vocabulaire des institutions indo-européennes, Émile Benveniste offered a brilliant analysis of  attempts to etymologize religio by compar- ing it to the connotations of  the term in Old Latin authors such as L. Accius and Plautus.1 From these early strata of  Latin literature onward, the term retains the sense of  “being scrupulous (with special regard to ritual matters).” Benveniste convincingly argued that these associations of  the term conformed much better to Cicero’s etymology than to Lac- tantius’s. He also presented further morphological and textual argu- ments in support of  this observation. Another merit of  Benveniste’s treatment is the initial attention brought to the Greek term threskeía, which also seems to convey the sense of  observance and studiousness with respect to ritual matters. Attested for the first time in Herodotus (in the Ionian form threskeíe), it was once used to designate the norm among the Egyptians not to eat cow’s meat (2.18). The noun is most likely de- rived from a verb thre 1sko, attested only in the lexicographer Hesychius, who glosses thre 1sko with noo 1, “to perceive,” and the variant thráskein with anamimne 1skein, “to recollect.” Threskeía has apparently less to do with faith than with the observance of  proper conduct. The fact that the Vulgate invariably translates threskeía with religio may seem a little odd in the light of  the subsequent development of  the term.2 Whereas Chris- tianity understood itself  as religio (in the sense of  religare) in the writ- ings of  the early church, the context of  threskeía in the New Testament is neither necessarily that of  piety (such as in the case of  the intrinsically beneficial eusébeia) nor something unique as opposed to anything that could be termed heretical or pagan.3 Just as in earlier Greek literature, threskeía in the New Testament seems primarily focused on the practical side of  worship. 1 Émile Benveniste, Le vocabulaire des institutions indo-européennes, 2, Pouvoir, droit, religion (Paris: Les éditions de minuit, 1969), 265–78. 2 Acts 26:5; Col 2:18; James 1:26–27. 3 For a slightly different view, see Peter Antes’s discussion in “ ‘Religion’ einmal anders.” Temenos 14 (1978): 184ff.; see also W.

Another act of  reiteration referred to elsewhere in Ci- cero’s writings seems relevant in this connection. It is the act implied by the rare term recordatio, which Cicero uses as a translation of  the Greek term anámnesis in a discussion of  Plato’s theory of  memory (elaborated in Phaedo 73a and elsewhere).4 Plato assumed that learning was nothing but a recollection of  previous states of  existence of  the soul. Recordatio literally means “a recalling to heart (or mind),” with a similar focus on the cordial (Latin cor) seat of  the mind as seen in Latin credo, Avestan zrazda-, and Vedic ¶raddha-. All these compounds contain the Indo- European word for heart (*kr3 ed-) and a verb (*dhehl) meaning “to set, put, place.” The reverse effect of  this cordial commitment could be con- strued as a hardening of  the heart associated with blindness, ignorance, and forgetfulness (Mark 8:17–18). The noun recordatio is also used in the context of  burnt offerings and sacred gifts of  greeting in the Vulgate translation of  Numbers (10:10), where the Septuagint not very surprisingly reads anámnesis. With regard to the underlying Jewish tradition, particular attention should be paid to the semantic field represented by the root zkr in the sense of  “re-presentation, making present the past which can never remain merely past but becomes effective in the present,” especially to different kinds of  “memorials” (e.g., the blast of  trumpets) ordained by God with a promise of  his grace.5 Numbers 10:10 reads: “And at the time of  your rejoicing, on your annual festivals and your new moons, you must blast the trumpets over your burnt offerings (Hebrew ‘ôlah, Septuagint: holokauto 1masin; Vulgate: holocaustis) and your sacred gifts of  greeting. The [blast] will serve as a reminder (Septuagint: anámnesis, Vulgate: re- cordationem) of  you before God. I am YHWH, your God!”6 I pointed out above that anamimne 1sko, the verb underlying the noun anámnesis, was 4 Cicero Tusculan Disputations 1.57. 5 A.

Levine, trans., Numbers 1–20: A New Translation with Introduction and Com- mentary, Anchor Bible no. 4 (New York: Doubleday, 1992). This passage, while inciting some hesitation regarding the use of  the term “holocaust” (literally a “burnt offering [to God]”) as a designation of  the Nazi extermination of  European Jewry, may also turn our attention to the fact that the persecution of  the Jews remains a major theme in contemporary discussions of history, memory, and forgetting. The latter issue is touched on in Carlo Ginzburg’s essay, “Distance and Perspective: Two Metaphors,” in Wooden Eyes: Nine Reflections on Distance (New York: Columbia University Press, 2001), 141. The term “holocaust” is sometimes falsely </page> <page sequence="5"> History of Religions 5 employed by Hesychius as a translation of  the otherwise unattested verb thrásko (which, if  Benveniste was right, constitutes the basis of  threskeía along with the likewise isolated variant thre 1sko). Consequently, the terms considered so far seem to be engaged in an exchange of  meaning that would have appeared less obvious at the outset: religio ≠ recordatio ¶• ¶• threskeía a anámnesis They all refer, directly or indirectly, to mental acts of  reiteration in the context of  behavior and to imply a fidelity that is directed toward modes of  conduct, toward the process of  reiteration, and not primarily to- ward the beliefs engendered by such modes of  conduct. Despite their conspicuously different motivations, classical authors rely- ing on either of  the two competing trends in the interpretation of  religio would inevitably have had to acknowledge that this phenomenon implied an act of  reiteration (signaled by the prefix re-). They would probably also have agreed that it was an act informed by constraint and duty rather than by mere habit. Surely it is not going too far to say that, even today, both practitioners and students of  religion take these things to be prime con- cerns and characteristics of  religion. As for the many views usually not shared by these groups, however, an important point of  refraction seems to be the unprecedented and unchanging nature attributed to the situation reiterated. ii. traditio and parádosis The next step in this investigation is to address the process of  mediation that must precede any act of  reiteration signaled by terms such as religio, threskeía, and anámnesis. Whether mental or kinetic in nature, a reception requires an act of  giving.7 On the one hand, this process has been studied under the heading of  “communication,” by which one usually understands the transmission and exchange of  meaning in space, whereas the cor- responding transmission of  meaning in time has been studied under the assumed to be the translation of  Hebrew so’â, a word that originally meant “dung, excre- ment, filth,” but which was used to describe a coming disaster in the prophetic proclamations of  chastisement (cf. Ezra 4:12). See the discussion in K.-M. Beyse, “so’â,” “se’â,” “so’î,” in Theological Dictionary of the Old Testament, 12:195–96. 7 It may seem trivial to state that religio implies traditio, and one is not surprised to see this interdependence made explicit in Latin literature (“Servius Sulpicus religionem esse dictam tradidit quae propter sanctitatem aliquam remota ac seposita a nobis sit, quasi a relinquendo dicta, ut a carendo caerimonia” [ap. MACR. Sat. 3.3.8 (GRF 425,14)]; my emphasis), yet the nature and background of  this interdependence is not necessarily a trivial issue. </page> <page sequence="6"> 6 Retracing the Path heading of  “tradition.” Informed by attempts to model communication on the structure of  sender, message, and receiver, Aleida Assmann suggests that tradition should be modeled on the structure of  memory and author- ity.8 This point is well taken, but I am hesitatant about the emphasis on “meaning” (or Nachrichten) as the prime object of  transmission. It may seem trivial to point out that meaning is an outcome rather than an object of  interpretation, yet this distinction is crucial to the discussion of  a pro- cess involving such salient changes and ruptures of  meaning as those of tradition. Let us confine ourselves for the moment to stating that tradition requires an object to be safeguarded, a traditum, without suggesting any further specifications as to what that object might be. Tradition also re- quires a subject, which, depending on its role in the process of  transmis- sion, could be termed either “tradent” or “recipient.” If  one applies the reciprocity of  giving and taking to acts of  recollection and transmission, the choice of  a term for the process as a whole becomes a matter of  voice and perspective, because a thing passed down as traditum has usually been received and retraced before, and it is destined to be received again in an unbroken chain of  giving and taking. By virtue of  the terms at stake here, classical literature provides some striking examples of  this interactive process. Despite its rather profane context, an example from Horace may serve as a starting point: “qui testamentum tradet tibi cumque legendum, abnu- ere . . . momento.”9 The sentence concerns the transmission of  someone’s last will (testamentum), an inscribed object that he passes on (tradet) to be received and read over (legendum) by an intended heir. In all its sim- plicity, the context of  the phrase is suggestive of  a traditum, transmitted through the medium of  a tradent, supported by a covenant (testamen- tum), and finally read over by a recipient. As for the verbs trado and lego, a context giving cause for their conjunction would accordingly be that of  inheritance in the intrinsically economic and judicial sense (“to deliver possessions into another’s hands”) of  the verb trado and its Greek counterpart paradídomi. An early example in Latin literature, where trado clearly means “to transmit as an inheritance,” is found in Plautus’s Menaechmi: Liparo, king of  Syracuse and successor of  Pintia, who was the successor of  Agathocles, is said to have passed on his king- dom to Hiero.10 I would like to anticipate some of  the comparanda to be treated below by quoting the display of  a similar context (more precisely the division of an estate) in a Vedic prose passage (Taittiriya-Samhita 3.1.9.4–5): “Manu 8 Aleida Assmann, Zeit und Tradition: Kulturelle Strategien der Dauer (Cologne: Böhlau, 1999), 64. 9 Quintus Horatius Flaccus Satyrarum Libri 2.5.51. 10 2.3.56–60 (409–10): “tertium Liparo, qui in morte regnum Hieroni tradidit.” ONE LONG </page> <page sequence="7"> History of Religions 7 divided (vi-÷bhaj) his property (daya-) among his sons. He deprived Nabhanesdistha, who was a student, of  any portion. He went to him, and said, ‘How hast thou deprived me of  a portion?’ He replied, ‘I have not deprived you of  a portion; the A“girases here are performing a Sattra; they cannot discern the world of  heaven; declare this Brahmana to them; when they go to the world of  heaven they will give (÷da) you their cattle.”11 Just as in the case of  trado, the term dayá- (derived either from a verb ÷da4 meaning “to divide,” or from ÷da1, “to give”) evokes both the trans- mission of  material property to an heir and the religious transmission of immaterial tradita. An isolated attestation in the oldest collection of  Vedic hymns (Rig-Veda [RV] 10.114.10) merely allows us to interpret the same term as an afterlife recompense for the hardships of  ritual, but an incon- testable example of  the marked sense is found in another Vedic prose passage (‡atapatha-Brahmana [‡B] 1.5.2.12). Here, the prefixed noun sampradaya- evidently refers to the (ritual) object of  (oral) tradition and is most likely associated with a verb sam-pra-÷da1, “to transmit, hand down by tradition” (attested for the first time in epic language).12 How- ever, the nominal element -daya- and Vedic dayá-, if  not ultimately derived from the same root, must at least have fallen together at some early stage of  development.13 Now when he (the Adhvaryu) calls (on the Âgnidhra), he thereby calls after sacri- fice, “Listen to us! come back to us!” and when he (the Âgnidhra) responds, then the sacrifice comes back, saying “so be it!” and with it thus passing over to them, as with seed, the priests carry on (÷car) the tradition (sampradaya-), impercep- tibly to the sacrificer; for even as people hand on from one to the other a full vessel, in the same way they (the priests) hand down that (sacrifice) from one to the other. They hand it down by means of  speech (vac-), for the sacrifice is speech (prayer), and speech is seed: therefore they keep up the tradition by means of  it.14 This brings us back to the classical examples of  trado (traditio) and para- dídomi (parádosis), for it remains to be considered on what grounds these terms are drawn into a context similar to that of  the latter Vedic example. Walter Magaß has demonstrated the high degree to which the abstract sense of  traditio, with its particular tinge of  religion and canonical literature, 11 Arthur Berriedale Keith, trans., The Veda of the Black Yajus School (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1914). 12 In both its form and sense, this verb is very similar to Latin prodo, “to hand down, transmit, bequeath.” 13 Regarding the ambiguities involved in deriving and interpreting dayá- (especially in the light of  Pali daya-, “gift,” as opposed to dayajja-, “inheritance”), see M. Mayrhofer, Ety- mologisches Wörterbuch des Altindoarischen Erster Teil. Ältere Sprache, 2 vols. (Heidel- berg: Universitätsverlag C. Winter, 1992–96), “÷da4.” 14 Julius Eggeling, trans., ‡atapatha-Brahmana: According to the Text of the Madhyandina School (Oxford: Clarendon, 1883). </page> <page sequence="8"> 8 Retracing the Path draws its meaning from Roman civil law. It was especially the obliga- tion to protect a private deposit against theft and forgery that inspired early Christian theologians to incorporate the term traditio into their writings.15 The principles of  civil law, as implied by Tertullian, should incite the tradent to be a custodian, not someone who proceeds inquis- itively and arbitrarily with a property that has been handed down to him in the strictest confidence.16 A problematic aspect of  this mediating pro- cess is the perpetual sacrifice of  intelligibility. Whereas tradition always involves some degree of  interpretation insofar as things have to be said and heard, written and read, read and translated, and so on, the search for intelligibility must never jeopardize the inviolable deposit. Ideally, tradi- tion is not conceived as a dialogue with the past but, rather, as an uni- linear process of  custody directed toward the future, the safekeeping of  a code that must remain unbroken. In the external world, however, tradita evidently do change and invite interpretation: they change because they invite interpretation, and they invite interpretation because they seem so oblique and obsolete. Another aspect of  this ambiguity, perhaps even the superordinate reason for ambiguity in this connection, is the simple fact that tradita must remain unmolested while still passing from hand to hand. If  the phatic and scriptural world of  revealed truth (as regulated by divine law) could prove so suggestive of  the physical world of  deposits and their custody (as regulated by civil law), does it not follow that the re- vealed truth, since it is circulating in a world of  human interaction, would eventually get worn out?17 It seems as if  the exegesis of  tradition feeds on two closely related yet scarcely compatible judicial domains: the law of  inheritance, which in- evitably has to involve the right of  possession, and the law regulating the custody of  deposits. The traditum is inherited not as either a private or public property, but as a deposit. Just like an heirloom, it is not supposed to be consumed by its heirs but to be passed down intact to the next gen- eration. In a Maussian system of  reciprocal gift giving, we expect the act of  giving to trigger a response, a counter gift, in order to assure the cir- culation of  wealth. But a given traditum moving along a time axis could not imply any counter gift, since this would break the unilinear move- ment through time. Likewise the traditum resists definite consumption by 15 Walter Magaß, “Tradition—Zur Herkunft eines rechtlichen und literarischen Begriffs,” Kairos: Zeitschrift für Religionswissenschaft und Theologie 24 (1982): 111–20. 16 Tertullian De praescriptione haereticorum 7.12.

For further treatments of  this rich metaphor, see H. Weinrich, “Münze und wort: Untersuchungen an einem Bildfeld,” in Sprache in Texten (Stutt- gart, 1976); and Jacques Derrida, “La mythologie blanche,” Poétique 5 (1971): 1–52. </page> <page sequence="9"> History of Religions 9 inciting further transmission through time, the claim to be passed down unexpended as if  never truly seized. This double responsibility is sharply outlined against the evocation of  parathe 1ke and diathe 1ke, of  de- positum and testamentum, in the New Testament. In 1 Timothy 6:20, the author touches on the custody of  apostolic tra- dition with special emphasis on the principles of  civil law. After a series of  instructions regarding his duties as a pupil and a leader of  the parish in Ephesus, Timothy is urged to guard the deposit of  Paul’s teachings: “O Timothy, guard what has been entrusted on you [paraqhvkhn]. Avoid the godless chatter and contradictions of  what is falsely called knowledge, for by professing it some have missed the mark as regards faith.” Similar expressions are also found in 2 Timothy 1:12–14. The employment of  the judicial term parathe 1ke (Latin depositum) in these passages sheds light on the apparent post-Pauline authorship of  the Pastorals. According to the different schools of  antiquity (e.g., the Pythagoreans and the neo-Platonics, but perhaps also early guilds of  singers such as the Homeridai), the ex- tended teachings of  a doctrine were possessions of  the original teacher and could thus safely be ascribed to that teacher without incurring the accu- sation of  forgery. By the members of  the Pauline school, Paul was like- wise conceived as the testator, whose teachings they had been summoned to pass down and protect against unlawful dispossession, because the course of  Pauline tradition ultimately leads back to God and the teach- ings of  Christ.18 Although absent from the Pastorals, the verb paradídomi occurs in similar contexts elsewhere in Greek literature. An early ex- ample is a passage in Plato’s Philebus (16c) relating how “a gift of  the gods to men,” along with bright fire, was thrown down from heaven through the agency of  Prometheus. The ancients, who lived closer to the gods, handed down (parevdosan) this gift in the form of  the phe 1me (“(di- vine) saying” or “report”) “that all things said to exist stem from one and from many, and that they carry both the finite and the infinite within them.”19 Like the post-Pauline author of  1 Timothy with regard to para- the 1ke, Plato retraces the path of  the divine gift through an intermediary agent (Prometheus). It is also significant that both authors hint at a multi- directional transmission of  the traditum: a vertical transmission from the eternal world of  God-gods to the temporal world of  men, and a horizontal transmission from hand to hand within the temporal world of  men. Another judicial concept, that of  diathe 1ke (Latin testamentum), deserves attention in this connection. It is pivotal because it is situated at the very core of  both Christian canon and ritual: the new covenant or testament 18 Jürgen Roloff, “Pastoralbriefe,” in Theologische Realenzyklopädie, ed.

The saying over the cup, “this is the new covenant of  my blood” (Luke 22:20; 1 Cor. 11:25), or “this is my blood of  the (new) covenant” (Mark 14:22; Matt. 26:28), recalls God’s first covenant with Israel on Mount Sinai as expressed in Exodus 24:8: “behold the blood of  the covenant!” The covenant on Mount Sinai was a one-sided obligation (with a pledge attached to it) rather than a two-sided contractual agreement.20 However, the meaning of  the word diathe 1ke in secular Greek usage primarily recalls the establishment of  a last will or testament, which only takes effect at the death of  the testator. This ambiguity is further elaborated in Hebrews 9:15–17, where Christ is said to be the mediator of  a new covenant (diathe 1ke), so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance. Where a will (diathe 1ke) is involved, the text continues, it is not in force as long as the testator is still alive. Even the first covenant on Mount Sinai involved death, because the people and the book were sprinkled with the blood of calves and goats when the commandment of  the law was declared. Let us pay some further attention to the description of  the Lord’s Supper. As we shall see, many of  the concepts touched on so far coincide with the treatment of  this event. In 1 Corinthians 11:23–25, a text is quoted that is strongly reminiscent of  the different variants handed down by the Synoptics (especially Luke 22:17–20): For I received [parevlabon] from the Lord what I also delivered [parevdwka] to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed [paredÇdeto] [he] took [eßlaben] the bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it [eßklasen], and said, “This is my body which is for you. Do this in remembrance [a ̊navmnh- sin] of  me.” In the same way also the cup, after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant [kainh; diaqhvkh] in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of  me.” It is notable that Paul, while passing from the plain text of  the letter to the apparent quotation, makes use of  a chiastic arrangement that seems to explore the different connotations of  the verbs (para)lambáno and para- dídomi. On the one hand, the verbs are used by Paul in the figurative sense of  receiving and handing down an oral testimony; on the other hand, they are used in the literal sense of  taking up (a loaf  of  bread) and handing over someone-something (to death-destruction). The latter sense is under- scored by the reference to the breaking of  the bread representing the body of  Christ. The word order in the beginning of  the verse—parevlabon . . . oJ kaμ parevdwka—seems to be marked, as suggested by the expression parevdwka . . . oJ kai parevlabon in the same letter (1 loc. 15 3). It has been 20 H. Hegermann, diaqhvkh, in Exegetical Dictionary of the New Testament, vol. 1. </page> <page sequence="11"> History of Religions 11 noticed by others, furthermore, that the occurrence of  paradídomi, espe- cially in passages associated with Jesus’s Passion, defies simple classifica- tion in terms of  whether the verb refers bluntly to the seizure and handing down of  Jesus to Pontius Pilate or to the soteriological notion of  self-sur- render, the act of  God underlying these human events (see especially Mark 9:31).21 In Paul, the ambiguity of  the verb may be due to an inten- tional chiastic arrangement, the center or turning point of  which becomes “an apophthegmatic summary of  its contents.”22 God through Christ, by being handed over to death, hands himself  down to mankind through sac- rifice and extends himself  by means of  tradition in the circulatory system of  an ever-growing body of  disciples. The occurrence of  anámnesis in this passage also deserves some con- sideration. We noticed in the previous section that this term shared certain textual and conceptual associations with religio. Religio could be under- stood as an act of  recollection in a more or less literal sense, whereas anámnesis is vaguely suggestive of  the same act from a figurative point of  view. Aristotle, in his treatise On Memory and Recollection, interprets the act of  recollection (anámnesis) as a recovery of  previous knowledge. Memory proper can only be established posterior to this act, because it is impossible to remember the present.23 The act of  recovery (analambáno) characterizing the anámnesis is metaphorically understood as a seizure pre- ceded by the search for previous knowledge or experience rather than the memory of  this knowledge or experience. In the context of  oral tradition, any seizure has to be taken metaphorically. It does not literally involve the hand but, rather, the ears and the mind. One may thus conjecture that Paul’s reference to what he “received (from another)” (parevlabon), what he has handed down so that it might be received once more, reflects and forestalls the situation described in the following verses: the disciples being urged to recover and reiterate through an act of  anámnesis the sit- uation initiated at the Lord’s Supper. I suggested above that the wearing down, consumption, and eventual destruction of  the traditum is an involuntary consequence rather than a deliberate aim of  tradition, which sets out (or pretends) to counteract this degradation process. Yet these things may turn out to be less clear-cut. Not only is the very notion of  destruction inscribed in the concept itself (the leftover, that which is surrendered, handed over to death, left behind, 21 Günter Bornkamm, “Herrenmahl und Kirche bei Paulus,” in Studien zum Neuen Tes- tament (Munich: Kaiser, 1985), 278ff.

The logical connection between these two aspects of  behavior becomes even clearer when we turn to some culturally discrete comparanda. iii. the footprint code of tradition in vedic poetics We now move from the familiar example of  the Lord’s Supper to the less familiar example of  Vedic ritual exegesis. Needless to say, Vedic literature differs fundamentally from the texts of  the New Testament with regard to its trajectory, historical context, and style. The Vedic hymns were com- posed within an open-ended oral tradition spanning a considerable space of  time. The earliest hymns contained in the Rig-Veda probably belong to the latter half  of  the second millennium BC. Nevertheless, this terminus a quo merely marks the closure from an historical vantage. Vedic religion did not acknowledge any historically transparent founder or circum- scribed creed. The progenitors of  Vedic tradition were said to be poet- priests, to whom the secrets of  ritual had been revealed in a distant past. Their actions were considered prescriptive with regard to the perpetual duties of  ritual. Overlapping yet at times contradictory hymns and exe- getical treatises were composed and handed down within family traditions or by specific priestly offices. After a process of  codification, which may have begun during the middle of  the first millennium BC, the extensive Vedic corpus gradually entered a state of  fixed oral transmission. The Vedic texts revolve around ritual (yajñá- or yájus-), either by providing the actual liturgy or by offering a painstaking exegesis of  ritual details. These perspectives occasionally interlock, because the mantras per- formed as a part of  the ritual may also be considered exegetical insofar as they contain ritual metaphors or touch on the nature of  ritual action. Despite the apparent lack of  a cultural interface between Indian society and the Greco-Roman world before the time of  Alexander, there is another common trait that could add new dimensions to the comparison of  Greek and Vedic data. I am thinking of  the shared Indo-European vocabulary. This linguistic background has informed assumptions regarding ideolog- ical commonalities unaffected by any direct linguistic traits (e.g., in the works of  Georges Dumézil), but a more skeptical attitude toward the re- construction of  Indo-European ideology is not tantamount to a complete rejection of  the heuristic value of  a common linguistic heritage. Unlike concepts translated from one, less familiar system into another, more fa- miliar one, cognates share certain formal features that may be pinpointed without an in-depth study of  their pragmatics. A probe into their Sitz im Leben can thus be supported by the simple fact that they belong to the same diachronic continuum. As for common traits in terms that refer to </page> <page sequence="13"> History of Religions 13 the transmission and establishment of  cultural heritage, a particularly high degree of  concentration involves nouns and verbs derived from the commonplace verbal roots *deh3, “to give” and *d heh1, “to set, put, place.”24 Some of  these correspondences (e.g., Latin prodo, Greek paradídomi, and Vedic sam-pra-÷da) have been largely ignored, whereas others have found a way into the textbooks because of  their relative pe- culiarity. A familiar case is the devotion characteristic of  ritual obser- vance and the transmission of  customs, “committing (literally “putting”) one’s heart to something,” as exemplified by the cognate Latin and Vedic compounds credo and ¶raddha 1-. The verbal compound ¶raddha 1- in fact provides a suitable point of  departure in this connection, because it allows us to uncover a series of  actions directed toward and proceeding from the very heart of  the Vedic tradent. Before entering on this path, however, we must briefly touch on another datum in the Vedic exegesis of  tradition. George Thompson, in two important articles from 1995, shed new light on an early Vedic doctrine of  signs centered on the notion of  padá-, or “footprint.”25 This doctrine applied, on the one hand, to the concerns of  poets and ritual specialists in the present by inciting them to pursue the verbal precedent left behind by their ancestors.26 On the other hand, the same doctrine was transferred to mythical narratives involving gods or the apotheosized poet-priests who tracked down the lost cows captured in the cave of  Vala or pursued the hidden tracks of  the god Agni “fleeing from his responsibilities as a priest.”27 In accordance with this notion, furthermore, the padá- (understood as a visible, transient, or invisible track) could be hidden, deposited, or left behind (ni-÷dha 1) by a divine agent or tradent and then found or recognized by the “knowers of  the track” (padajña 1 ), or “track seekers” (padavı 1 ), entering on a prescriptive course. In his capacity as a personification of  the sacrificial fire reflecting the mediating function of  the priest, Agni was conceived as a patron of sacrifice and chief  custodian of  proper ritual conduct. This notion was already firmly established in the opening hymn of  the Rig-Veda, which characterizes the god as “ruling over the ceremonies, the shepherd of  ‰tá- (= the governing principle of  cosmic and ritual order)” (8a–8b; ra 1jantam 24 See Calvert Watkins, “New Parameters in Historical Linguistics, Philology, and Cul- ture History,” Language 65 (1989): 783–99. 25 George Thompson, “The Pursuit of  Hidden Tracks in Vedic,” Indo-Iranian Journal 38 (1995): 1–30, and “From ‘Footstep’ to ‘Word’ in Sanskrit,” Semiotica 106, n.s. 1–2 (1995): 77–98. 26 Similar conceptions, such as the chijikijilu, “landmark, ritual unit,” among the Ndembu, prevail in modern ethnography (see Victor Turner, The Ritual Process [London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1969], 15). While undoubtedly relevant to a probing into the universals of  tra- dition’s exegesis, an inventory of  this kind would by far exceed the limits of  this essay. 27 Thompson, “The Pursuit of  Hidden Tracks in Vedic,” 23. </page> <page sequence="14"> 14 Retracing the Path adhvara 1na $m ' gopa 1m ‰tásya). The pursuit of  Agni’s hidden tracks essen- tially implies a return to the principles once and for all established by him. Consider, for instance, the following passage quoted by Thompson: “Insightful poets follow [Agni’s] track [padám], protecting variously the unaging [= Agni-Agni’s track?] in their hearts [h‰da 1]. Wishing to win him, they have searched the river. He, the sun, has become visible to them, [illuminating] heroes!”28 A similar notion is expressed in the two follow- ing passages: “Keeping all manhood [pl.] in his hand, he [Agni] caused stupefaction among the gods as he took a seat in the hiding-place [gúha]. They find him there, the devout [dhiyamdha 1] men, when they pronounced the formulas fashioned in their hearts [h‰da 1]” (RV 1.67.2–3). “Among us, they—all the desiring, immortal, judicious ones—would not find the one who had clasped the calf  [= Agni]. Ambitious, pursuing his tracks, de- voutly [dhiyamdha 1s] they stopped by the farthest track [padé paramé], by the dear [track] of  Agni” (RV 1.72.2). The tentative translation of dhiyamdha 1- (“devout ones” or “devoutly”) does not fully capture the actual sense of  the compound. Taken at face value it evokes the same notion of  cordial or mental commitment as the more familiar verbal com- pound ¶raddha1-. The Vedic noun dhíyam- (from the root ÷dhay, “to behold, to think”) covers a broad semantic spectrum ranging from “perception,” “vision,” and “thought” to the formulation of  thought as “poetry” or “praise.” To be devout is consequently to commit one’s vision to some- thing (preferably the track, the verbal precedent), figuratively grasping it with one’s hand, whereupon it enters one’s heart or mind as if  entering a vessel. Furthermore, this active and gestural recognition (dhiyamdha 1-) of the track is preceded by a divine act of  marking or concealing that is sometimes expressed by the same verbal root ÷dha plus the preverb ní, or “down.” This is the sense in which the three strides of  Visnu (by means of  which the god measures the world) are described as his padá- three times “left behind” (ní dadhe; RV 1.22.17). It is also the sense in which the “udder of  the cow” (dhenúr u 1dhah), a parabolical designation of  poetic speech, has been “concealed” (see RV 3.55.13). In the shape of  a great steer, Agni puts his feet (or leaves his footprint behind) on the face of  the earth (RV 1.146.2c) so that his track may be pursued by the poet-priests and protected in their hearts (once more RV 1.146.4): 2c: urvya 1h padó ní dadhati sanau; 4a–b: dhır1 asah padám kaváyo nayanti ' na 1na h‰da 1, ráksa- mana ajuryám (He [Agni] leaves his footprint on the broad back [of  earth]: Insightful poets follow his track, protecting variously the unaging [= Agni- Agni’s track?] in their hearts). An additional interpretation of  the simile in 2c (Agni as steer [uksán-] treading the earth) is vaguely suggested by a passage (RV 3.55.17) depicting Parjanya’s (the god of  rain and thunder) fertilization of  the earth as a bull (v‰sán-) “placing his seed” (ní dadhati 28 RV 1.146.4; Thompson, “The Pursuit of  Hidden Tracks in Vedic,” 23. ONE LONG </page> <page sequence="15"> History of Religions 15 rétah [cf. pado ní dadhati ]) in the herd. The simile in 2c may thus be double-edged insofar as it simultaneously interprets the track left behind by Agni as the verbal precedent of  ritual and as the seed (or prototypical traditum) initially planted by the god. We should recall the Vedic prose passage quoted above: “as with seed [retas], the priests carry on the tra- dition . . . they hand it (the sacrifice) down by means of  speech [vac-], for the sacrifice is speech, and speech is seed: therefore they keep up the tra- dition by means of  it.”29 This ongoing process of  tracking and tracing, of  sowing and reaping, while always recalling the exemplary events of  the past, also implies a continuous change of  status. Agni’s role as disseminator is transferred to the poet-priests who once pursued his tracks. They become the new vessels of  his seed, and their imitators in the present become the future disseminators of  the past: “With ritual/sacrifice they [the next generation of  poet-priests?] tracked down [padavıy1 am ayan] speech [vacáh]. Then they found those [tracks, words?] having entered into the sages [ ‰s3 isu]. Having brought them forth [abh‰t3 ya], they divided them amongst many [vy adadhuh purutra 1]. The seven singers [original poet- priests?] jointly extol them” (RV 10.71.3).30 As for the traced matter hinted at in this passage, whether literally understood as the verbal pre- cedent of  ritual or as anything else left behind by a previous generation of  ritual specialists, its distribution is once more signaled by the verbal root ÷dha (*dheh1), “to set, put, place,” and a preverb ví, “away, forth.” This verb completes and unites a series of  operations, all of  which may involve the padá-: (a1) ni-÷dha, “leaving behind, concealing”; (b) dhíyam-÷dha, “committing one’s vision to”; and (a2) vi-÷dha, “distribut- ing, redistributing” § (a1) “leaving behind.” Operations a1 and a2 de- scribe acts of  coding, the creation of  a (new) track or path, whereas operation b describes the decoding or tracing of  operation a, the retracing of  a path. Yet the act of  decoding could eventually turn into a coding as well, into something left behind, because the “vision” (dhíyam-) by means of  which the track is recognized may also denote the object of  rec- ognition. By way of  example, according to RV 10.67.1, the seven-headed “poem” (dhíyam-) found by the ancestor (or “father”) apparently refers to a poem fashioned and left behind by the seven poet-priests through an act of  devotional decoding (dhiyamdha 1-). A similar formulaic appropriation of  vi-÷dha occurs in two other hymns (both in the tenth book of  the Rig-Veda).31 The verb in these hymns not only pertains to the distribution of  speech, as in the “Hymn to Speech” 29 ‡B 1.5.2.12; see Magaß. 30 The “sages” referred to in this quotation, the seven poet-priests (or A“giras), were the first to find (÷ved ) the track or path (see Rig-Veda 10.46.2 and 3.31.5). 31 See Vladimir N. Toporov, “Die Ursprünge der indoeuropäischen Poetik,” Poetica 13 (1981): 233. </page> <page sequence="16"> 16 Retracing the Path (Vac) (RV 10.125.3c), but also to the division of  a sacrificial victim, as in the cosmogonic so-called Purusasukta (RV 10.90.11a). Through their di- vision of  Vac, the gods allow Speech to enter different regions of  space and assume different (marked and unmarked) verbal shapes. Through the dismemberment of  the prototypical victim (the anthropomorphic Purusa or primeval “man”), on the other hand, the gods create the cosmic and social foundations of  human society. The distribution of  Speech (in RV 10.125.3c) and the verbal precedents (or “footprints”) of  the ancestors (RV 10.71.3c) may thus have been informed by the dismemberment of  a sacrificial vic- tim: RV 10.71.3c: ta 1m ma deva 1 vy àdadhuh purutra 1, “the gods divided me amongst many”; RV 10.90.11a: yát purusam vy àdadhuh, “when they (the gods) divided Purusa”; and RV 10.125.3c: ta 1m abh‰t3 ya vy adadhuh purutra 1, “having brought them forth, they [the poet-priests] divided them amongst many.” It is notable that the two latter myths have influenced one another conceptually in other respects as well. It is said of  both Vac and Purusa that they consist of  four parts (literally, “measured up into four tracks”32), three of  which remain hidden or divine while the last part enters creation and circulates among ordinary men (cf. RV 1.164.45, 10.90.3–4). The hidden parts are not to be disturbed or disarranged (né“gayanti [ná + ÷i“g]; RV 1.164.45c). It is significant that the same verb (÷i“g), in post-Vedic grammar, denotes the division of  a compound into separate members.33 While thus alluding to the decomposition of performative speech into analyzable parts, restraining from such inter- pretative endeavors is characteristic of  other approaches to tradition, not least with regard to the perpetual sacrifice of  intelligibility discussed by early Christian authors (see above). The theme of  sacrifice as an indicative path is further elaborated in Brahmanic literature. Whereas the earliest Vedic texts seem less explicit in this respect, the Brahmanas occasionally present gods and humans as antagonistic competitors for the science of sacrifice. The gods, who were the first to invent sacrifice, rendered their own language opaque and tried to erase their tracks so as to obstruct the indices of  the operations that once caused them to obtain the celestial world. According to some such etiological accounts (e.g., Aitareya-Brah- mana 2.1; ‡B 1.4.3), the gods used the sacrificial post (yupa) to erase the traces of  sacrifice by pointing its tip downward. As observed by Charles Malamoud, this myth seems to explore the ambiguous etymological sense of  yupa as that which “unites” (÷yav1), “separates” (÷yav2), and “causes the tracks to disappear” (÷yop).34 32 Thompson, “The Pursuit of  Hidden Tracks in Vedic,” 6. 33 See Monier Monier-Williams, A Sanskrit-English Dictionary (1899; Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1956), “÷i“g,” “to divide or separate the members of  a compound word.” 34 Charles Malamoud, “The Gods Have No Shadows: Reflections on the Secret Language of  the Gods in Ancient India,” in Cooking the World: Ritual and Thought in Ancient India (Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1998), 202.

The chief  objects of  tradi- tion are units that must remain undisturbed and hidden, but that still lend themselves to scrupulous recollection and transmission along a time axis. Since they retain the appearance of  tracks, these units are always poten- tial objects of  interrogation. However, any such interrogation threatens to disarrange them and ultimately erase them from the path on which they persistently appear. Furthermore, the transmission of  tradita is analogous to the dismemberment of  a sacrificial victim. Just as the ritual prescrip- tions (or tracks) have been found and divided among many by the apothe- osized poet-priests, the first sacrificial victim was divided by the gods so as to establish human society. The origin of  tradition and the origin of  the sacrifice maintained within tradition unfold themselves as the traces of divine intervention. By repeatedly pursuing the tracks left behind by the gods, the ritual specialists retrace the creative origins of  ritual. iv. gothic anafilhan and the germanic concept of tradition The fourth-century Gothic translation of  the Bible is the oldest compre- hensive document written in a Germanic dialect. The extant manuscripts contain large portions of  the New Testament and a few fragments of  the Old Testament. Because of  the scarcity of  literary sources of  pre-Christian Germanic culture before the Viking Age, a document such as this pro- vides helpful insights into an early Germanic dialect that set itself  the task of  interpreting a foreign religious vocabulary in the light of  indige- nous concepts and categories. The prospect of  grasping aspects of  early Germanic religion through the medium of  Gothic language seems par- ticularly favorable in cases where indigenous Gothic terms, such as blo- tan (= Greek latreúein, “to worship”) and gudja (= Greek hiereús, “priest”), display younger offshoots in other literary (especially Old Norse) sources concerned with religious and judicial institutions that had begun to lose their importance as a direct result of  the propagation of Christianity. Such a favorable instance is found in the Gothic translations of  the Greek terms paradídomi, parádosis, and parathe 1ke. While we can show that the Gothic translator(s) gave prominence to the intrinsic unity of  these terms by translating all with the verb filhan, further attention to the concepts that ensue from this verb may help us grasp the systematic analysis of  cultural inheritance in pre-Christian Germanic culture. Let us first take a closer look at the Gothic attestations. The unmarked sense of  filhan (proto-Germanic *felhan) corresponds to the Greek verbs krube 1nai, “to conceal” (Luke 10:21), and thápsai, “to bury” (Matt. 8:22 and 1 Tim. 5:25), whereas the marked sense inherent in later manifestations of  the same verb (e.g., Old Norse fela) is expressed in Gothic by adding the preposition ana-, “at, on.” As seen in the Old Norse expression fela á hendi, “to give into one’s keeping, entrust,” the </page> <page sequence="18"> 18 Retracing the Path marked sense of  *felhan seems consistent with that of  Latin trado and Greek paradídomi. The Gothic deverbative noun ana-filh translates pará- dosis, parathe 1ke, and sustatikós.35 The verb ana-filhan accordingly trans- lates paradidónai; ekdídosthai, “to give up, surrender”; paratítesthai, “to commit”; and sunistánein, “to commend.” Cognates of  the same verb are still found in German befehlen and empfehlen. Since the primary sense of the verbal root could either have been that of  Old English feolan, “to penetrate, commit,” or Gothic filhan, “to conceal,” we may assume that both notions were assigned to the same gesture in early Germanic dia- lects.36 To pass something down along a time axis was consequently un- derstood to be an operation that required encoding; the traditum had to be concealed in order to penetrate the change of  generations. As ob- served above, the Vedic verb ni-÷dha exhibits a similar ambiguity in that it either denotes the impression of  a visible track or the encoding of  a se- cret message (the parabolic “udder of  the cow”). Now, if  we proceed from the twice-attested noun fulhsni (from filhan), which occurs as a translation of  “that which is done or said in secret [tò kruptón]” in a passage concerning the practice of  piety (Mark 6:1–18) and in a fragmentary translation of  a lost commentary on the Gospel of  John (Skeireins IVd) where it is the direct object of  the verb anafilhan, another Gothic noun comes to mind. It is the term runa (Greek muste 1rion, “mys- tery, secret”; boule 1 “plan”; sumboúlion, “counsel”), which (as I will argue below) in some Germanic dialects became associated with the indige- nous “runic” script. In the Gothic Bible, however, such scriptural conno- tations are absent, and it may be assumed that Gothic preserves an early sense of  the term having more to do with things said, whispered, or sung in a context of  confidentiality or performative markedness (see Old English runian, “whisper”; Old Saxon and Old High German runon, “whisper”; the presumed Old Irish cognate run, “secret, mystery”; and the Finnish loan word runo, “[traditional] song, poem”). Compare the following passages: Skeireins IVd: “But [Christ] born of  heaven, handing down [anafilhands] the hidden things fulhsnja [singular fulhsni ] he had seen and heard from the father.” Luke 8:10 (cf. Mark 4:1): “To you it has been given to know the secrets [muste 1ria : runos] of  the kingdom of  God; but for others they are in parables [parabolaîs : gajukom (i.e., things ‘yoked together’)], so that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.” 1 Corinthians 15:51: “Lo! I tell you a mystery [muste 1rion: runa]. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed.” 35 In the expression sustatikaì epistolaí, “letters of  recommendation” (2 Cor. 3:1). 36 See Brigitte Schirmer, “*pelk,” in Lexikon der indogermanischen Verben (Wiesbaden: Reichert, 1998). One Line Long </page> <page sequence="19"> History of Religions 19 Ephesians 3:9: “And to make all men see what is the plan of  the mystery [muste 1riou : runos] hidden [apokekrumménou: gafulginos (from filhan)] for ages in God who created all things.” Not unlike the use of  the term in classical Greek literature, muste 1rion in the New Testament especially denotes something that has been or is in the process of  being revealed to some but which remains hidden (a puz- zle or a parable) to others. In Classical and Hellenistic Greece, a mystery did not belong to discursive reason and was only accessible through the deeper level of  experience characteristic of  ritual participation.37 The term is derived from the verbal root mu-, which either refers to the clos- ing of  the eyes or lips, or to the production of  inarticulate sounds when one tries to speak with closed lips. Just as “hidden things” ( fulhsnja) are the objects of  tradition (anafilhands) in the Skeireins, the runa could function as an object of  a similar action in the sense that it has been “hid- den” (gafulginos) in God for ages (Eph. 3:9). Whereas the quality of  being partially concealed is apparently a seman- tic property of  runa, the term also seems to concern that which is passed down, received, encoded, and decoded through human interaction within a context of  marked behavior, through a specific competence or initiatory status. Granting that this was the primary sense of  the term in prehistoric times, it would be consistent to derive its association with the indigenous runic script from a situation in which a set of  fixed characters became legible through an acquired interpretative competence. Despite some re- cent attempts to dismiss the idea that Northwest-Germanic run originally had anything to do with “mystery, secret,” I would insist that this associ- ation remains highly plausible. A major reason for arguing that *runo, or “mystery,” and Northwest-Germanic run, or “rune,” should be considered homonyms is “the problem of  how to explain satisfactorily the semantic gap separating the two meanings without relying on the presumed magi- cal nature in the runes.”38 On account of  this apparent semantic gap, Ri- chard L. Morris has suggested that Northwest-Germanic run, even if  it accords phonetically with terms related to Gothic runa and German raunen, “to whisper,” developed independently from an inherited Indo- European root with the original sense “to dig” and the developed sense “to scratch, carve, write.” It is certainly possible, however, to find etymo- logical support for a common origin of  the two meanings without presum- ing that a magical quality was ascribed to the runic script. Furthermore, the idiomatic and textual conjunction of  the two meanings in early dialects 37 H. Krämer, musthvrion, in Exegetical Dictionary of the New Testament, vol. 2. 38 Richard L.

Runa ‘Mystery,’ ” Beiträge zur Geschichte der deutschen Sprache und Literatur 107 (1985): 344–58. </page> <page sequence="20"> 20 Retracing the Path other than Gothic would speak against a case of  homonymy. Let us em- phasize once more that a mystery, in the sense of  classical Greek and Koine usage, has nothing to do with magic, not even necessarily with the supernatural, but with things that have acquired a marked status, so that they may only be seen or shown, heard or said, in a special way. While Morris rightly supposes that is the nature of  an alphabetic sys- tem to be accessible to a large number of  people, it is also the nature of a written message to be a codification and fixation of  human speech in all its performative efficacy.39 If  Gothic runa had nothing to do with notions that invited scriptural associations, Morris has yet to explain how North- west-Germanic run- ( like Gothic runa) could function as an object of  the verb *felhan. I quote the introductory phrases of  two early runic inscrip- tions (Björketorp and Stentoften), both of  which are followed by a curse (approximately “he who breaks this [monument] is condemned to an in- sidious death through baseness [or perversity]”): Stentoften: hideRruno[ro]no felAhekA ( falh ak &lt; proto-Germanic *felh ek) hederA ginoronoR Looijenga: “A clear rune row I bury here / runes from the ruling gods.”40 Antonsen: “To the sequence of  clear runes I commit hither mighty runes.”41  Björketorp: HAidRrunoronu fAlAhAk hAidera ginArunAR Looijenga takes fAlAhAk as a first singular preterit indicative (“I bur- ied”).42 As suggested by the choice of  verb in both variants, it seems un- likely that the carver merely wished to commit a message to writing and thus expose it to the public eye, especially when we consider the con- junction of  filhan and runa in the Gothic translation of  Ephesians 3:9 (runos Âizos gafulginos) or the conjunction of  fela and rún in the Old Norse phrase fólgit i rúnum. The latter phrase, found in Snorri Sturlu- son’s treatise on poetic diction (Skáldskaparmál [Edda 47]), concerns an operation by means of  which one word is represented by another in the poetic language of  the skalds. For example, “gold” is referred to as the “speech,” “words,” or “reckoning” of  the giant Êjazi, because he and his brothers divided their inheritance by taking the same-sized mouthfuls of  their dead father’s gold. When “gold” is thus called “Êjazi’s speech,” the word has been fólgit i rúnum; it has been concealed and passed down in the form of  a poetic message that simultaneously obscures the purport of  a poem and provides the same poem with an index to the world of  myth. 39 Ibid., 347. 40 Tineke Looijenga, Texts and Contexts of the Oldest Runic Inscriptions (Leiden: Brill, 2003), 178, 183. 41 Elmer H. Antonsen, Runes and Germanic Linguistics (Berlin: de Gruyter, 2002), 304. 42 Looijenga, Texts and Contexts, 178. </page> <page sequence="21"> History of Religions 21 The rún is that into which an unmarked word is deposited so as to pro- vide it with marked status.43 In early Old Norse poetry, furthermore, rún is an object of  interroga- tion and recollection that has much more to do with sententious speci- mens of  prescriptive knowledge than with writing or written messages. Scriptural associations evidently do occur, but it is impossible to assign these to a completely different semantic field. When the term rún occurs as the focus of  agonistic riddling in the mythological poem VafÂrúdnis- mál, that which is said frá jo 4tna rúnom ok allra goda (about the giants’ rúnar and those of  all gods; Vafdrfúdnismál [Vm], 42, 43) is precisely that which is true but remains hidden to a majority of  beings. It is also notable that, apart from being potentially carved or scraped off, rúnar could also be directly told.44 It thus seems (pace Morris’s objections) highly plausible that Gothic runa, Northwest-Germanic run, and Old Norse rún all belonged to the same family. This familiarity is further substantiated by the etymology first suggested by Sigmund Feist in 1939. It proceeds from a Greek de- nominative ereunáo, “to find out,” and connects this with the Old Norse raun, “trial, experiment, investigation” (Proto-Germanic *rauno). The Ger- manic noun can easily be explained as an ablaut grade related to Gothic runa, Old Norse rún, and so on. This etymology would be consistent with the understanding of  proto-Germanic *runo as an object of  inquiry or investigation. In specific contexts, the Greek verb ereunáo could in fact literally refer to the decoding of  a vestige, such as the “tracks” (íkh- nia) left behind by Apollo’s stolen cattle in the Homeric Hymn to Hermes (lines 176–77). Ereunáo could also take as its object the noun boule 1, which the Gothic Bible invariably translates with runa (Luke 7:30; 1 Cor. 4:5).45 The heroic and mythological (so-called “Eddic”) poetry contained in the thirteenth-century Codex Regius often presents the rúnar as a special 43 Another suggestive evidence against Morris’s general assumption that an alphabetic system always invites public access is a passage concerning the invention of  the indigenous Ogham alphabet in the Middle Irish Auraicept na n-éces (The scholars’ primer), 5471ff. According to this text, Ogma (“a man well skilled in speech and in poetry” [ fer reolach a mberla 7 a filidecht]) invented the Ogham letters so “that this speech should belong to the learned apart, to the exclusion of  rustics and herdsmen.” Julius Caesar, in his De bello Gal- lico (6.14.3–4), had assumed that writing was partly avoided by the Druids because it might obstruct the hermetic claims of  this privileged community. This ethnographic perspective is completely inverted in the Auraicept, a document emerging from within the same cultured circle. 44 See the expression “to tell true rúnar” (segia sannar rúnir; Fornaldar Sögur, 2.302 [in a verse]). 45 (For it is impossible that he will search out the gods’ plans [qeΩn boulevmat’ ejreunavsei] with a mortal mind.)

Although little is known about the history of Eddic poetry, whether most of  the poems were composed after Iceland’s conversion to Christianity or whether they merely received their final shape during this period (preceded by a long period of  oral transmis- sion), we are not led to look for its primary sources in the literary canon of Christian Europe. Nothing in the form or content of  Eddic poetry speaks against the assumption that it was linked to the oral traditions of  pre- Christian western Scandinavia. This poetry depicts Ódinn as “the great Êulr,” or FimbulÂulr (from the verb Âylja, “to chant, murmur”; Hávamál [Háv.] 80, 142), who first painted or embellished the rúnar. He searched for the kind of  knowledge represented by the rúnar in the context of  ago- nistic code testing (e.g., in Vm.), and in another passage he “took up rúnar” (nam . . . upp rúnar; Háv. 138–41) so as to acquire ritual compe- tence through a sacrificial giving up of  himself. The latter passage, the so-called Rúnatals Êáttr, belongs to the most controversial in the study of  Old Norse mythology. I quote Gabriel Turville-Petre’s translation: 138. I know that I hung / on the windswept tree / for nine full nights, / wounded with a spear / and given to Ódinn, / myself  to myself; / on that tree / of  which none know / from what roots it rises. 139. They did not comfort me with bread, / and not with the drinking horn; / I peered downward, / I grasped the ‘runes’, / screeching I grasped them; / I fell back from there. 140. I learned nine mighty songs / from the famous son / of  Bölthór, father of  Bestla, / and I got a drink / of  the precious mead, / I was sprinkled with Ódrerir. 141. Then I began to be fruitful / and to be fertile, / to grow and to prosper; / one word sought / another word from me / one deed sought / another deed from me.46 Since the time of  Sophus Bugge (1889), many scholars have interpreted this passage as a reflection of  the scene on Calvary. Bugge found expres- sions of  popular Christian piety in other parts of  northern Europe that were strongly reminiscent of  the myth of  the hanging Ódinn, such as the notion of  the rood tree in Old English poetry and a nineteenth-century folksong recorded in Unst (Shetland), according to which Christ “hang pa de rütless tree. . . . Nine lang nichts, / i’ da nippin rime.”47 Nevertheless, other scholars have been more prone to regard this as a sign of  confluence between, on the one hand, a pre-Christian myth of  sacrificial death on a tree and, on the other, the martyrdom of  Christ on the cross. Turville- Petre has convincingly argued that “nearly every element in the Norse myth can be explained as a part of  pagan tradition, and even of  the cult of 46 E. O. G. Turville-Petre, Myth and Religion of the North: The Religion of Ancient Scan- dinavia (London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 1964), 42. 47 Ibid., 43. </page> <page sequence="23"> History of Religions 23 Ódinn.”48 Considering the importance of  Ódinn as a recipient of  human sacrifice (in some cases even human self-sacrifice) in the Old Icelandic sagas, it is tempting to regard the Rúnatals Êáttr as an etiology of  sacri- fice.49 The god, in days of  yore, exhausted himself  so as to establish the performative pattern of  sacrifice. Such an interpretation is further sup- ported by verses 142 and 143, which refer to the search, acquisition, and distribution of  rúnar and stafar (“staffs, staves, letters”) first painted or embellished ( fádi ), made (gørdo), and carved (reist) by the gods, and by verses 144 and 145, which call attention to the proper use of the runic script (rísta, ráda [to counsel read], fá, freista [to try]) as well as different cultic duties (bidia [to bid], blóta [to worship], senda [to send], sóa [to sacrifice]). All these verbs are preceded by the question veiztu hvé? (do you know how?) in verse 144, whereas in verse 145 the proper practice of  the four latter duties are compared with regard to their respective defaults and excesses (“it is better not to bid than to worship too much . . . it is better not to ‘send’ than to sacrifice too much”). Al- though the specific sense of  senda in this connection remains somewhat unclear, it is plausible that it refers to ritual actions associated with the killing of  animals. While the verbs bidia and blóta apparently denote more abstract aspects of  worship, sóa seems to denote the making of  an offering or even the actual slaughter. In this case, senda possibly refers to the apportionment of  meat or shares subsequent to a sacrificial slaugh- ter. Such a share of  meat could be referred to as a sending (a dish of meat) in Old Norse literature, and the verb senda occasionally denotes the exchange of  precious gifts (gjafar).50 The moral of  the last verse would thus, it seems, involve the moderation expected of  ritual partici- pants. Just as a request (bæn) or petition (bón) in the context of  worship (blót) is always subordinate to the worship itself, the apportionment and consumption of  sacrificial food (sending) among the ritual participants is always subordinate to the sacrificial atonement (són) as such. Verse 145 closes with an apparent return to the context of  the two opening verses: “So Êundr (= Ódinn) carved . . . when he rose up [as opposed to ‘fell down’ in verse 139], when he came back.” The god returns from a limi- nal state of  sacrificial exhaustion, bestowing on mankind the prescriptions for sacrifice. Arguably, these prescriptions are presented to mankind in the form of  rúnar, that is, as primeval revelations or objects of  inquiry to be passed on from generation to generation. 48 Ibid. 49 See the Swedish King Erík the Victorious, who gave himself  (gafsk) to Ódinn in order to win a battle (Flateyarbók 2.72). 50 See Richard Cleasby and Gudbrand Vigufsson, “senda, sending,” in An Icelandic- English Dictionary (Oxford: Clarendon, 1957). </page> <page sequence="24"> 24 Retracing the Path Ódinn in his capacity as a god who entrusts insight to future genera- tions is also thematized in the myth of  the loss of  his eye. According to a famous strophe in the poem Vo 4luspá (28), the sibyl (or vo 4lva) knows that he “hid” or “deposited” ( falt, from fela &lt; *felhan) his eye as a pledge in the well of  Mímir. By thus depositing his vision into the fleeting substance of  the well, Ódinn provides a perpetual source of  knowledge from which the god of  the well (Mímir) is thought to profit. Mímir drinks mead every morning from Ódinn’s pledge (28), and from the same pledge a wet clay (aurr) is seen pouring down from the World Tree (27). I leave it to others to decide whether the name mímir has anything to do with the perfect participle underlying Latin memor, but it is tempting to imagine this god as a personification or supervisor of  living memory. A closer look at the context of  the verb senda gives us further reasons to associate this term, not only with the apportionment of  sacrificial shares, but also with the distribution of  tradita. In the Eddic poem Sigrdrífumál, the hero Sigurdr is brought “tiding from all worlds” from the valkyrie Si- grdrífa. She teaches him about the use and origin of  secret lore and pays particular attention to the rúnar associated with the mind (hugrúnar). They, she says, one must know in order to be wise (13). They were first “read” (réd), “carved” (reist), and “thought out” (hugdi ) by Hroptr (= Ódinn) from a liquid dripping from the head and horn of  two mythical beasts. The next verse (14) abruptly introduces a change of  scene by seemingly quoting five verses from a different poem. The subject of  the first line once again appears to be Ódinn, who stood with sword and helmet on a cliff. Mím’s head then spoke the first word and true letters (sanna stafi ).51 What follows in the next three verses is an extensive enumeration of  dif- ferent objects, or physical locations, on which the rúnar were originally carved (the feminine object underlying the past participle ristnar could hardly be anything but rúnar). Some of  these locations are directly asso- ciated with myth and mythical geography (the shield standing before the sun [15], the ears and hoof  of  the two horses pulling the sun [15], the tongue of  Bragi [= god of  poetry; 16], and the point of  Gungnir [= Ódinn’s spear; 17]). Others recall the sphere of  human remedy (delivering hands, the track of  healing [16]) and prosperity (glass and gold, wine and wort [17]). In view of  the líknar spori (track of  healing) in verse 16, it is sig- nificant that many of  the objects enumerated, while all bearing the signa- tures of  carved markings, are themselves capable of  leaving behind a 51 Mím is presumably identical with Mímir. According to Snorri’s Ynglinga Saga (IV), Mímir was the wisest of  the Æsir. His head was chopped off  as he was held hostage among the Vanir, but Ódinn brought the head back to life by the use of  herbs. The head talks to him and he derives wisdom from it. Although this story is not told elsewhere, the two references to the talking head of  Mím in Eddic poetry (Vo 4luspá 46, Sigrdrífumál 14) most likely allude to a similar myth. </page> <page sequence="25"> History of Religions 25 trail or mark (a hoof, teeth, a wheel, a paw, a claw, a beak, the point of  a spear, or a nail). In the final verse (18) of  this apparent quotation, the rúnar are all “scraped off ” (af skafnar); they are “mixed” (hverfdar) with the holy mead and “sent” (sendar) far around. They are among the Æsir, among the Elves. Some are with the Vanir, some are with men. The verbal sequence af skafnar-hverfdar-sendar is striking in its concrete imagery, yet one should keep in mind that the physical sense in which something is scraped or shaved (PIE *(skabh) also underlies verbs such as Gothic gaskapjan and Old English scyppan (to create). On the analogy of  a carpenter’s knife or chisel, the removing of  redundant matter is un- derstood as the basis of  any creative process. An example of  a similar semantic leap is Pahlavi kirrenidan, “create” (sometimes “mis-create”), which may derive its developed sense from an Old Iranian belief  in the creative origins of  sacrificial dismemberment.52 If  the verbal sequence in verse 18 is thus taken in its widest metaphorical sense, we are led to com- pare it to a similar formulaic sequence, which contains two cognate ver- bal roots. It occurs in the Old English Nine Herbs Charm: A snake came crawling, killed a man, then took Woden nine twigs of  glory, smote then that adder that it flew apart into nine parts. There did apple and venom/gall bring it about (?), that she [the adder] never would turn into the house. Chervil and fennel, great and mighty two, those herbs did the wise Lord create (gesceop), holy in the heavens, when he hung (Âa he hongode); he set (sette) and sent (sænde) them into the seven worlds, to the poor and the rich, as a help to all.53 The “wise Lord” (witig drihten) referred to in line 37 is undoubtedly Christ. It is significant, however, the extent to which the charm rather in- discriminately mixes Christian and pre-Christian motifs. The presumably rather late archetype underlying the manuscript (MS Harley 585; ap- proximately from the late tenth century) might suggest that the apparent syncretism of  the charm resulted from the increasing presence of  Norse Vikings on the British isles. Yet the benevolent function of  Woden (or Wodan) in another continental charm, the Old High German Second Merseburg Charm (ca. 750), rather indicates that pre-Christian motifs were particularly persistent in this kind of  popular literature. It would 52 Bruce Lincoln, “Pahlavi kirrenidan: Traces of  Iranian Creation Mythology,” Journal of the American Oriental Society 117, no. 4 (1997): 681–86. 53 The English translation is based on those found in Anna Helene Feuler, “Zur Metrik der Merseburger Zaubersprüche,” Die Sprache: Zeitschrift für Sprachwissenschaft, 41, no. 2 (1999): 126. </page> <page sequence="26"> 26 Retracing the Path thus be fair to assume that the image of  Christ (lines 37–40), and espe- cially the creative achievements assigned to him as he “hung” on the cross, were likewise an outcome of  syncretic, popular beliefs. Like the folksong from Unst, the Nine Herbs Charm represents Christ in a context that recalls the myth of  the hanging Ódinn-Woden. Through an act of sacrificial exhaustion, the hanging god shares his achievements with mankind. No less conspicuous is the verbal sequence associated with the herbs created on the cross. Christ “created” (gesceop) them, “set” (sette) them, and “sent” (sænde) them into the seven worlds, to the poor and the rich. They become a remedy for all. Save for the alliterative verb sette, the sequence is perfectly consistent with the one in Sigrdrífumál (18): af shaf- nar (*skabh) - hverfdar - sendar; Nine Herbs Charm 37–39; gesceop (*skabh) - sette - sænde. The two herbs in the Nine Herbs Charm are of course not directly interchangeable with the rúnar in Sigrdrífumál. Nevertheless, both texts present the zero point of  transmission by high- lighting the same threefold gesture: to create or shave off; to put down; to distribute. It is also notable that many of  the rúnar in the Eddic poem are carved on objects that seem to be sources of  remedies. More important, however, the Old English passage allows us to bridge what, in Eddic po- etry, seemed to be two different, independent versions of  the origins of rúnar. To sum up, the Germanic concept of  tradition (*felhan) can be seen to oscillate between the notions of  handing down and of  concealing. A typical object of  such an operation, the *runo, likewise involves the no- tions of  secrecy and of  coded knowledge to be distributed and passed down. Just as in the Vedic cases touched on above, the traditional unit (or traditum) bears the trace of  divine intervention. It reaches mankind ver- tically, as it were, before it starts to pass from hand to hand along a hori- zontal time axis. According to Old Norse poetry, Ódinn acquired the rúnar as he hung on the tree. These were handed down to mankind in the form of  coded specimens of  sacrificial knowledge. Furthermore, they were “apportioned” (sendar) on the analogy of  a victim shared among the par- ticipants in a ritual slaughter. v. concluding remarks The testing ground of  this essay has been the reutilization of  the earliest accessible definitions of  religio in lieu of  an understanding that can be traced back to the hegemonic appropriation of  the concept by early Chris- tian writers. In its earlier sense, it seems, this term did not principally re- fer to the reestablishment of  man’s relation to a coexisting divine force but, rather, to a reiteration of  the past in terms of  duty and scrupulosity. With this emphasis on the flow of  time rather than on ontology, religion </page> <page sequence="27"> History of Religions 27 seems to be more closely connected to tradition than to any all-embracing understanding of  the world. Religion is the mental reception of  things (tradita) passed down by means of  tradition; it is the retracing of  a path left behind by tradition. These complementary concepts (religio and tra- ditio) might now begin to serve a heuristic purpose. Insofar as similar concepts in other cultural settings employ the same device, they become clues to the ways in which a given society thinks and rethinks its own past, how it is affected by its past in the present, and how it imagines its own future. Heuristic undertakings at best reveal unexpected connections in the material analyzed; they challenge us to put forth new questions and seek new solutions to problems that were less obvious at the outset. A common feature of  the separate “cases” treated in this study is the way in which the exegesis of  tradition informs that of  sacrificial apportionment. While I have not been able to offer more than a provisional account of this issue here, I hope that others will acknowledge what is at stake and be encouraged to pursue it further. Let me use an analogy to clarify my point. The gesture of  tradition resembles the pick-up that simultaneously reads off  and wears down a rotating gramophone record. The record gen- erates no sound by itself. Certain additional rules of  use and information regarding the date of  its origin may be attached to it, but the actual con- tent of  the record can only be traced by means of  an external decoding device. Unlike the developed visual trace of  a photograph, the grooves of the gramophone record are virtually impossible to decipher without ac- cess to this external device. In addition, the more we use the record, touch it with our hands, and expose it to dust and the markings of  the pick-up, the more worn out it gets, and the more difficult it becomes to trace the event that had been recorded. Designed to do the best possible justice to the code without transforming it, the decoding device eventu- ally and inevitably changes it anyway. The pick-up wears down the record, as it were, by creating new tracks in the course of  tracing the original code. That which was never meant to be a code, but simply to re- main a trace of  the decoding process, becomes a new track to be traced on the already worn-out surface, a new code (or “pseudocode” if  you like) to be recorded and decoded. The pick-up eventually picks up nothing but the traces of  its own past. This is where the analogy becomes applicable to the issues that concern us here, for in the case of  tradition the modifi- cation of  perpetual deposits is an unavoidable consequence of  an opera- tion that pretends to do the opposite: to decode and pass down in exactly the same fashion as before without disarranging the traditum. But it is always a slightly different story that is left behind to be told. The con- tinuous gestures of  tradition, even if  imagined as a series of  identical gestures, inevitably leave some trace in their matter of  commitment. </page> <page sequence="28"> 28 Retracing the Path All the more conspicuous, therefore, is the degree to which religious activity entails the active affirmation of  disarrangement and consumption, at least from the point of  view of  everyday life: the deliberate destruction of  artifacts in mortuary rituals, initiation rites involving bodily mutilations, or the abstruseness of  ritual speech. At the risk of  promoting generaliza- tions, we may assume that such encroachments on the perceived “natural” order of  things often seek legitimacy in a higher or invisible order of things. While tradition stands between the not yet or no longer present heirs of  a legacy, sacrifice (and to some extent ritual in general) is com- monly thought of  as a channel between ontologically differentiated agents. In neither case do we recognize an interaction between present agents in- volved in utilitarian exchange or communication. Situations in which com- munication is obstructed by a highly formalized diction, in which useful things are destroyed and useless things are considered priceless vehicles of  symbolic power, are all characteristic of  these modes of  action. Some- thing is given up, exhausted, and consumed to the same extent as it is not to be given up, exhausted, or consumed. The impossible is reconstrued as a possibility, and the obstacle as a unifying force. This at least is how the story goes in certain cultural settings. Universitetet i Tromsø </page> </plain_text>
