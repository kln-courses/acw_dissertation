MAIR University of Pennsylvania NOTE 1. Francine Patterson and Eugene Linden, The Education of Koko (New York: Holt, Rine- hart, and Winston, 1981), p. 193. Sainthood: Its Manifestations in World Religions. Edited by Richard Kieckhefer and George D. Bond. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1988. Pp. xii + 263. $38.50. Kieckhefer and Bond have produced an unusually helpful book in the genre of the history of religions. Seven noted scholars have provided rather comprehensive reviews of sainthood or its analogues in major religious traditions. Richard Kieckhefer has written on Christianity, Robert L. Cohn on Judaism, Frederick M. Denny on Islam, Charles S. J. White on Hinduism, George D. Bond on the Arahant in Theravada Buddhism, Donald S. Lopez, Jr., on the Bodhisattva in Mahayana Buddhism, and Rodney L. Taylor on the Confucian tradition. Because the essays are not aimed to be monographic, but rather historical reviews, experts in any tradition covered might find little new save perhaps for the organizing principles. Yet any expert will find much that is helpful in the discussions of those traditions outside the field of expertise. The underlying problematic of the book is how to define sainthood and thus to be able to compare the traditions. Kieckhefer in the lead chapter notes that within Christianity the term "saint" (hagios, sanctus) was first used broadly to refer simply to people in the Christian com- munity (as Paul addressed the Philippians), then was narrowed to mean those who stood up to martyrdom, and finally to those who fit a canon-law definition having to do with miracles and heavenly intercession. He discusses medieval monastic hagiography, recent theological views on saints, and the development of current Roman Catholic practice regarding saints. Contrary to the Roman Catholic legal definition of saint- hood, Robert L. Cohn points out that, for the term to be relevant to Jewish tradition, it should mean a holy person who is "both a model for imitation and an object of veneration" (p. 43). Of distinctive interest for Judaism is the importance of scholarship in the definition of the saint as sage as well as leader. Frederick M. Denny points out that the Arabic equivalents of "holiness" and "sanc- tity" do not ordinarily apply to people in Islam, and that the closest analogue to saint- hood is wali, "friend of God." A friend of God is one who can intercede with God on behalf of a petitioner, most often in matters of injustice. Denny describes several of the great saints, and discusses the veneration of them and the pilgrimages to their tombs or holy places. It would be instructive to compare and sort the historical interac-</page><page sequence="2">579 tions of medieval and later Islamic pilgrimages with those of European Christians and Asian Buddhists, Indian, Parthian, and Chinese. Whereas Islam is the newest of the world religions, Hinduism is the oldest, and Charles S. J. White's essay is remarkable for its historic scope and generosity. Hindu sainthood in his treatment is a function of being a highly evolved human being. Furthermore, White points out that the treat- ment of the gods in Hinduism is deeply anthropomorphic so that, even if the gods are not literally shaped like people, "all can be related to as though they were capable of experiencing the human situation, though from a very high level" (p. 98). Thus saint- hood is a stage on the way to divinization, as divinity itself involves a set of niches in a hierarchy of spiritual stages. Denny discusses the saintly roles, including those of women, in the Vedic period and in the time of the rise of Buddhism and Jainism. The center of his discussion is Sankara, the saint of intellect and spirit alike. Denny carries the review of particular saints down to the current day, including discussions of medie- val Hinduism, the impact of the Mogul empire, the European influence, and the situa- tion after independence. George D. Bond points out that the arahant in Theravada Buddhism is an ordinary human being who transcends that ordinary nature. Bond provides the most theological discussion in the book by analyzing the steps that are to be taken by the arahant-in- the-making. He also recounts some of the lore according to which arahants are ven- erated as well as imitated. Imitation of a highly transcendent being is made plausible in Buddhism by the view that you have a great many lifetimes to make progress, and the model himself or herself also had many lifetimes, each imitable. Nevertheless, the distinction between the arahant and ordinary folk is very great in Theravada, a situa- tion that contrasts with that in Mahayana, according to Donald S. Lopez, Jr. The Bodhisattva path is open to anyone, is entered by a vow, and is helped along by the many openings of grace. Every other Bodhisattva is dedicated to your enlightenment, as you are to theirs, and compassion abounds. Lopez splendidly lays out the steps in the Bodhisattva path, and points out that, of the three criteria for canonization of saints in Roman Catholicism-doctrinal purity, heroic virtue, and miraculous interces- sion after death, the Bodhisattva qualifies naturally for the first two. The last is prob- lematic because, with a vast succession of lives, death is hardly important to the Bodhi- sattva; after any given life, of course, there is another in which the Bodhisattva can perform gracious works. Rodney L. Taylor succinctly traces the development of the idea of the sage in Con- fucianism from the notion of the well-cultured person in Confucius' own writings, to Mencius' identification of the sage with the kings of antiquity and the presentation of them as a contemporary ideal, to the intensely practical path of sagehood as a spiritual and ontological goal in the Neo-Confucians. Although there is no bearing whatsoever of the Confucian or Neo-Confucian ideal of the sage on the Roman Catholic definition of the saint-sagely discernment is not doctrinal purity and virtuous integrity is not necessarily readiness for martyrdom-the sage does indeed attain to an ontological conformity with the principles of heaven and earth. In that sense, a sage is like a saved person well on the way to sanctification in a Christian sense. Taylor's attempt to compare Confucians and Christians by abandoning the defini- tion others used of Christian saintliness points up the methodological limitation of this book. Although its historical descriptive method facilitates the presentation of a great</page><page sequence="3">580 Book Reviews amount of interesting material, there is no well-developed comparison because there are no normative fundamental comparative categories. The editors' faint attempt to link the discussions of sainthood by reference to a tension between imitability and venerable otherness applies to heroes in general, to Alexander the Great, Stan Musial, and James Beard, as well as to religious heroes. By normative fundamental com- parative category, I mean one whose merit is that it identifies something real in reli- gion, but vague, of which all the religions to be compared have different versions or specifications. I would have supposed that sainthood, in a properly vague sense ready for compara- tive specification, means distinguished achievement in being rightly formed relative to the ultimate or divine. Thus two fundamental comparative categories would have to be elaborated relative to one another: an analysis of ultimacy, properly vague so as to be specifiable by theistic and assorted nontheistic ultimates alike, and a categoreal analy- sis of the elements in human life in which achievement relative to the ultimate is to be sought. This book rarely discusses the ultimates with reference to which saints might be understood, and when it does, they are treated without dialectical connection, like apples, oranges, automobiles, and square roots. The initial paradigm for sainthood, taken from the Roman Catholic criteria for canonization, is far too specific for anyone to expect it to be a prime analogate, as Cohn had to say in the second chapter. Even Protestant Christians, as Kieckhefer points out, reject the Roman Catholic notion as religiously important. Protestants do, however, advocate sanctification, meaning the perfecting of personal and social life by means of embodying and institutionalizing the mind of Christ. Something like that sense of sanctification is what the Roman Catholic canonization procedure is supposed to define from the perspective of authoritative certification. The mind of Christ, through the doctrine of the Trinity, is an ultimate and divine matter, fairly directly analogous to Confucian Principle and Mahayana Buddha-mind, and indirectly analogous through apophantic expressions to other formations of the ultimate that bear upon sanctification. Whether distinguished spiritual achievement in each tradition involves heavenly intercession, miracle working, effects beyond this life, or other accoutrements of the saints discussed here depends on how the religions differently specify the divine or ultimate, and how they differently understand the conditions and continuities of life. A set of fundamental comparative categories would allow those differences to be set forth without straining to find analogies. The most dangerous bias of historical sorting and comparison based on a prime analogate is not that it leaves a hodgepodge of different classes but that it suggests that apples, oranges, automobiles, and square roots are somehow alike, obscuring their differences and the reasons for their differ- ences. Delighted as the field of history of religions is to have separated itself from theology, it needs to cultivate an appropriately normative world theology on which to base its grounds for comparison.
