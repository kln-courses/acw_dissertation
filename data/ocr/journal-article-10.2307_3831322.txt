MATTHEWS UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO Competitive Giants: Satiric Bedrock in Book One of William Carlos Williams' Paterson William Carlos Williams completed Book One of Paterson in early February of 1945. He wrote of the event not only to James Laughlin, his publisher at New Directions, but also to Horace Gregory, a personal friend and one of the few literary critics Williams thoroughly trusted. To Gregory, Williams confessed that his friend Kitty Hoagland, who had typed the manuscript, and his wife Floss "were both curiously impressed and agreed I should have my pants kicked?a good sign."1 To Laughlin, Williams not only declared that he hoped his book would be "gravel for critics" which "cuts their hearts out," but also jokingly asked where he should send his "contribution to the meal of the gods, perhaps a radish . . . ."2 This attitude of playful joking was unsuited to the high tone of a serious epic, but it did suggest Williams' pleasure in releasing his strange collage, a landscaping of America complete with shadow figures from the literary world. Paterson One was an unusual book that could be appreciated on several different levels, a book that embodied history, poetics, and satire. 1 The Selected Letters of William Carlos Williams, ed.

MATTHEWS Williams had good reason to be pleased with himself. He had just completed the first installment of a long poem which would demonstrate his commitment to America and depict his own struggle to lift the American idiom to the level of poetry. He had begun the creation of his own myth, the myth of a man and his city raised to larger-than-life proportions. He had created his own anthropomorphic giant, a giant composed of his city's geography but also created as a mock-heroic image of himself. In this completely modern poem, Williams could demonstrate the importance of a local area and his poetic abilities while simultaneously satirizing the shortcomings of other poets, particularly of T. S. Eliot, his greatest rival and literary enemy. Only gradually and in sporadic efforts have critics come to notice satiric jabs at Eliot, Ezra Pound, Hart Crane, and, most recently, Allen Ginsberg in Books One through Five of Paterson.3 No one has yet fully explained how Williams sketched the American literary scene with oc- casionally heavy strokes of satire. In this essay, I will suggest the main source for Williams' approach to satire, explore the significance of Paterson, the mock-heroic giant, and illustrate how Williams selected and integrated into Book One historic documents about figures who could serve ascaricaturesof Eliot, Pound, Crane, and E. E. Cummings. Williams' use of satire was just the opposite of traditional uses, for it was subservient to his sense of place and his declaration of poetics. Traditional satirists waged their attacks in the foreground of their poems, appealed to readers who enjoy the conflict, the plot, the open wit of a satiric thrust. More serious moralistic or idealistic goals of the satirist were often only implied and lingered in the background for particularly astute readers. Williams reversed the process. His dream of a people aroused to their historical heritage and their growing living language occupied the foreground of his poem. His contempt for and castigation of those who had held the literary limelight and confined him to the sidelines were hidden in passages with double meanings where only the reader with wit and inclination could decipher them. The technique was adopted primarily from Williams' own view of a Spanish satire by Quevedo entitled El Perro y la Calentura, a book Williams and his Early references to Eliot and Pound are mentioned by Benjamin Sankey, A Companion to William Carlos Williams' Paterson (University of California Press, 1971), pp. 28, 64, 66, 78, 158, 192, and 216. Eliot and Crane are mentioned together on p. 161. Although these passages refer to attitudes or work which annoyed Williams, their tone is not given careful attention. More recently, the scoffing and mockery implicit in some earlier references and in additional passages have been noted by Charles Doyle, William Carlos Williams and the American Poem (St. Martin's Press, 1982), pp. 88, 89, 124-26, and 129.

While researching Quevedo's background at the New York Public Library, Williams discovered an early translation by an Englishman who, he confided to Laughlin, had "missed the entire point of the whole book, its double-entendre."5 By 1944, Williams evidently considered double entendre as the best approach to his own satiric impulse. Probably through working with the translation, Williams had discovered a way to include both the serious and satiric purposes of his poem. By carefully selecting and editing a large body of historic and poetic material he had collected and written, he could stress local events, both state and dem- onstrate his poetics, and simultaneously develop a homegrown literary allegory. He could interweave the story of his own life and the life of his city with parodies, puns, and satiric passages embedded in a factual presentation of his local area. Like Quevedo, he could both reveal and conceal his frustrations by becoming a master of double entendre. After Book One had gone to the printer and while Williams was struggling to complete Book Two, he stepped up his campaign to get Laughlin to publish the Spanish satire. In July of 1945, he described the book to Laughlin as "far more 'modern' than ever Hemingway or even Gertie [Stein] ever thought of being" and as "absolutely 'new directions' in its manner of writing and hot as hell besides."6 Laughlin agreed to look at the manuscript, so Williams sent it off noting in a letter that there was "an essay on Quevedo to go with it?if desired."7 When Laughlin later questioned Williams on the meaning of Quevedo's work, Williams replied that the satire was "the first recorded use of the pure image to tell a story." Because the story involved a young girl's pregnancy caused by a high church dignitary, Quevedo had been forced to describe the story in "double talk" by "using parables, popular sayings, slang, anything he could lay his hands on."8 4 In a November 1936 letter to Pound (Selected Letters, p. 164), Williams notes that his mother is helping him translate an old book Pound once left at the house, El Perro y la Calentura by Quevedo. 5 Letter from Williams to Laughlin, October 24, 1944. 6 Letter from Williams to Laughlin, "July something or other," 1945. 7 Letter from Williams to Laughlin, July 24, 1945. 8 Letter from Williams to Laughlin, August 9, 1945.</page><page sequence="4">240 KATHLEEN D. MATTHEWS Laughlin decided not to publish the book and did not see Williams' essay until May of 1949 when Williams expanded it and again requested publication. This time Williams suggested his essay be run side-by-side with the text. He also reiterated that Quevedo's experimental mood "is no more difficult than Joyce or Pound or even Gertrude" and "is, in fact, a forerunner of the styles in all of those books in some part."9 Williams also must have hoped Laughlin would see Quevedo's book as a forerunner of Paterson, for his Book Three drafts composed in 1948 and early 1949 contained the following passage: (At least these are the words I prefer or as Quevedo said: like this you should never write?and went on from there)10 Despite Williams' accompanying essay, Laughlin again refused to publish the satire, and Williams did not include his passage on Quevedo in either Book Three or Book Four. His essay, however, is preserved in manuscript and gives a good indication of how Williams' work on Quevedo had affected Paterson.u Williams begins with an explanation of Quevedo's reasons for writing in terms which only a few of the quick-witted could understand: Dog and fever, what more natural to us? We're dogs, all of us, at our best and worst if the fever hasn't got us, all. Then let us find other means to hide it than our present one, for its sweat reeks from us. Quevedo was in exile for having killed a man at the entrance to the cathedral, for having kicked a lady at her prayers on the stones. He was embittered at the treatment he had received and walking about impotent on his country estate to which he was confined, began to write. The fever had him and he was boiling over. For he if anyone, knew the intrigues of the court as he knew only too well that others in high positions were profiting by his absence. But his enemies were not ordinary enemies, they occupied high positions, the chief of them a high church man. To attack such a man required subtlety, double talk. Quevedo was a man for double talk so he sat down at his novella and let fly. When Book One of Paterson was published, Williams was not a man in exile. He was, however, an accomplished poet who as recently as 9 Letter from Williams to Laughlin, May 6, 1949. 10 The Quevedo fragment appears in two manuscripts, Book III, Part 1, and Book IV, Part 3, housed at Beinecke Library, Yale University.

Eliot, his archenemy, was a respected member ofthe Anglican Church and one of the most highly praised poets on both sides of the Atlantic. Even Laughlin, Williams' own publisher, was an acknowledged fan of Eliot's. Williams' other sometime antagonist and sometime friend, Ezra Pound, was in nearby St. Elizabeth's Hospital, having been judged insane and mentally unfit to stand trial for treason. Certainly, Williams could not ridicule either Pound or Eliot openly in his long poem. Like Quevedo, he needed to resort to a kind of double talk. In his essay Williams reveals one of Quevedo's techniques of making lists "put down without comment other than the facts of which they speak." The technique fascinated Williams, who saw it as "almost con? temporary in its literary method: No comment, nothing 'about' the subject, a bare placing ofthe matter before the attention, as an object, that which with wit, a man might see for himself?swiftly and to the point. The list is loaded with Quevedo's contempt." Williams also in? cluded objects in Paterson, scraps from history and from letters which concealed Williams' contempt for other literary figures and for patterns of thought which he bel ieved were dangerous for a democratic society. Williams also saw in Quevedo the need for the satirist to place himself in the same position as those he satirized. Thus, Williams characterized his own poem as "just another dog / among a lot of dogs,"13 depicted himself as a giant among other literary giants, and closed Book Four with a clownish "final somersault" (204). In his essay he wrote, "Quevedo descends to the level?a pure literary device?of those he attacks. He has come to his climax, the point he would make, the climax of his scurrilities and of his story?his deliberate scurrility as a gossip and an inspired clown." Years later in interviews, Williams would also speak of the "scandal" he included in the documentary sections of Paterson.14 Finally, Williams included a comment which certainly must have been confirmed by his knowledge of Pound's experience and which may have explained in part why Williams' own satiric thrusts were at 12 Reed Whittemore, William Carlos Williams: Poet from lersey (Houghton Mifflin Co., 1975), p. 291. 13 William Carlos Williams, Paterson, 8th paperback printing (New Directions, 1958), p. 3.

But with the will for it and the proper disguises, it might well and still serve for getting said salutorily that which would put us in jail were we to speak outright." Williams disguised his own satire well, and he did not really expect his work to be fully understood until the poem was complete and could be submitted to the kind of careful scrutiny characteristic of the new critics, a group who worshipped Eliot but had either ignored or belittled Williams' earlier work. When and if the new critics came prying, they would find caricatures of their literary heroes plus comical allusions to some of their favorite works. Perhaps Williams wished that such a sympathetic reader as Gregory would be the first to discover his satire and would view it as a play of wit. Perhaps he hoped the "kick in the pants" suggested by Floss and Kitty would set the tone for a compassionate reading of the playfully ironic but sometimes brutally serious dimension of his poem. Whatever Williams hoped for or expected, he was surprised with the initial critical response to Book One.15 Reviewers who had ignored him or been cool in the past now praised his autobiographical approach, applauded his Americanism, lauded his language theme, and raised great expectations for the three books which were to follow. No one, neither Gregory nor less partisan readers, noticed the biting flavor of Williams' "radish." II Williams entitled Book One "The Delineaments ofthe Giants," and the title surely had double meanings. Overtly, the giants are male and female figures created from the landscape of Paterson and represented by the people of the area. N. F. Paterson, a mock-heroic version of Williams, reports on the history and the activities of his people. Covertly, however, Paterson is an anthropomorphic myth which competes with Eliot's myths and a mock-heroic giant who competes with other literary giants. Paterson is the first giant in Book One. Formed of rock and water, he "lies in the valley under the Passaic Fails," the anthropomorphic incarnation of a city. But Paterson is asleep. The people ofthe city, like the giant, are "unroused" and function as "automatons" because they are unable to hear. They have no poet to "unravel" the common lan? guage, the language which must be "combed into straight lines / from 15 Paul Mariani, William Carlos Williams: The Poet and His Critics (American Library Association, 1975).

Williams' uses of rock and water imagery as both real elements of a real geographic area and as fresh new metaphors for an indigenous culture and the language to depict that culture are particularly significant. Both uses distinguish his poetic prac- tices from Eliot's. Williams will imaginatively find meaning in his imme? diate environment rather than resort to either traditional imagery or accepted symbolism. Eliot had used traditional rock and water imagery in The Waste Land to suggest the barrenness of modern life. By the mid-forties, poetry readers and professors all over America were familiar with the sterility symbol ized by rocks without water as part of "What the Thunder said": If there were water And no rock If there were rock And also water And water A spring A pool among the rock If there were the sound of water only Not the cicada And dry grass singing But sound of water over a rock Where the hermit thrush sings in the pine trees Drip drop drip drop drop drop drop But there is no water16 Williams offers an ironic and creative solution to the drought in this well-known passage. He creates a local anthropomorphic deity of rock and water and also uses the sound of water over a rock as the major metaphor for a living language. After Eliot had accepted Anglo-Catholicism, he used rock and water imagery in Ash Wednesday, and the water was associated specifically with spiritual regeneration, Eliot's answer to modern sterility. Finally, in hisChristian pageant The Rock, Eliot embraced the traditional religious symbol of the eternal church as his answer to a world which needs specific values. Williams' very different use ofthe same images under- scored his major difference from Eliot. For Williams, an American lan? guage which would lead to a new metric and a new national poetry would do more to regenerate the local and national sense of purpose than any spiritual rebirth. Williams had been thwarted in his promotion of such ideas in part by the popularity of Eliot's poetry and the continuing T. S. Eliot, The Complete Poems and Plays: 1909-1950 (Harcourt, Brace and Co., 1952), pp. 47-48.</page><page sequence="8">244 KATHLEEN D. MATTHEWS emphasis on the mythic approach to literature which began in The Waste Land. In Paterson, he would demonstrate his search for a new language and American culture and would belittle those poets who blocked him. Paterson is more than a local deity; he is also a "man?like a city" (7). As Williams turns from the anthropomorphic element of his giant to the human element, he employs parodic echoes and double entendre which put his rock and water imagery into a humorous context and stress the mock heroic nature of his giant. Williams was probably playing on the overworked metaphor of the stream-of-consciousness when he made Paterson's thoughts analogous to the Passaic Fails. Jostled as are the waters approach ing the brink, his thoughts interlace, repel and cut under, rise rock-thwarted and turn aside but forever strain forward?or strike an eddy and whirl, marked by a leaf or curdy spume, seeming to fo rget Retake later the advance and are replaced by succeeding hordes pushing forward?they coalesce now glass-smooth with their swiftness, quiet or seem to quiet as at the close they leap to the conclusion and fall, fall in air! as if floating, relieved of their weigrjt, split apart, ribbons; dazed, drunk with the catastrophe of the descent floating unsupported to hit the rocks: to a thunder, as if lightning had struck (7, 8) In the first eight lines, the passage vividly describes rushing water and aptly depicts the intricacies of a functioning mind. When Paterson's personified thoughts regroup, however, like a suicidal band of invaders and "leap to a conclusion," the passage becomes humorous. When his thoughts "fall . . . drunk / with the catastrophe of the descent . . . to hit the rocks: to a thunder, / as if lightning had struck," the analogy to mental processes becomes exaggerated to the point of burlesque. The passage, however, is more than a burlesque. Not only do the combina? tion of rocks, water, thunder, and lightning parody the high seriousness of "What the thunder said" in The Waste Land, but when Paterson's thoughts are "rock-thwarted," and later "hit the rocks," they may well be mounting an attack on both The Waste Land and Eliot's religious pageant, The Rock.</page><page sequence="9">WILLIAMS' PATERSON 245 In Eliot's pageant, The Rock is a character who carries on a poetic dialogue with a chorus of sixteen stone-like figures whose costumes make them appear to be growing out of the hill of rock on which they stand. The dialogue introduces scenes from the history of the London Church, and the entire pageant depicts man's continuing need for the church in all ages. The Rock's abstract character serves several purposes in the beginning of the pageant, but all are associated with traditional church symbolism. The Rock can represent the Eternal Church founded upon a rock as well as Christ, himself, who is metaphorically referred to in I Cor. 10:4 as "The Rock." By the close ofthe pageant, however, Eliot identifies The Rock as a representation of St. Peter, of whom Christ had said, "On this Rock will I build my Church."17 Thus, The Rock, both as symbol and as pageant, was Eliot's dramatic assertion of Chris- tianity as a force in the modern world. Williams, however, believed Christianity was an outdated anthropomorphic myth. One way to demolish an old myth is by ridicule and another is by replacing it with a new myth: Williams does both. By lifting his own anthropomorphic giant to mythical proportions which rival the Christian myth, Williams suggests that one god is as good as another and that a local deity may even be superior. In addition, the giant city-man has amorous inclinations and a female companion. By creating two giants, one male and one female, Williams undercuts not only Eliot's Christian myth, but also the earlier fertility myths Eliot had explored in The Waste Land. Williams' giants struggle toward fertility in Books One and Two, but their search for love gradually becomes associated with a more human search, a search which requires new discoveries in language. By Book Four, the anthropomorphic giants will be abandoned as both myths and metaphors, to be replaced by an emphasis on science, Wil? liams' version ofthe new twentieth-century myth. When Williams aban- dons his own anthropomorphic myth to turn to science, he suggests that his poem truly belongs to the twentieth century whereas Eliot's poems do not. Replacementof Eliot's myths, however, is not the only device Williams uses to undermine Eliot's poems. When compared to Eliot's Rock, Wil? liams' Paterson is far too humoroustobeconsidered heroic. Even though his first appearance lyrically associates him with the people of his city and elevates him as a mysterious force in the lives of the citizens, Williams adds a mock-heroic touch when "Butterflies settle on his stone E. Martin Browne, The MakingofT. S. Eliot's Plays (London: Cambridge University Press, 1969), p. 26.</page><page sequence="10">246 KATHLEEN D. MATTHEWS ear." When Paterson's thoughts take their drunken plunge over the fails, Williams sets the scene for a later drunken plunge by the historic local braggart, Sam Patch. Finally, the city-man will become raucously human when he urinates in Book One and when an observation tower becomes the giant phallusof this city-giant in Book Two. Williams' anthropomor? phic giant has a Rabelaisian coarseness which relates him to the capri- cious gods of Ancient Greece and which identifies him as a mock-heroic character. Furthermore, Paterson embraces a blossoming mountain woman made of "colored crystals," with "pearls at her ankles," and whose "monstrous hair" stretches into "the back country" where "the wood-duck nests." She lies "facing him, his arm supporting her, by the Valley ofthe Rocks, asleep." By placing his amorous but unroused giants by the Valley of the Rocks, which is italicized for emphasis, Williams invites a comparison between his two rock figures and the character from Eliot's play, The Rock. Williams' creation of a city giant who is also a man allowed him to compete with other poets in two ways: both as a demonstration that he could create myth while writing a lyrical passage and as a burlesque of the serious myths for which Eliot was known. Though Williams had written over a dozen books of poetry before Book One of Paterson, he had been critically pigeonholed as a lyric poet who wrote clean and spare poetry but whose work was second rate when compared to the work of Eliot, Pound, Yeats, and Crane, poets who had a mythmaking power Williamslacked.18 The giant Paterson provedotherwise. Williams could create myth even as he poked fun at Eliot. Furthermore, as a mock-heroic giant, he could compete with other literary figures who were included in Book One disguised as historic characters from the city's earlier days. Almost one third of Book One is made up of prose, an addition to the poetry which pleased some readers and puzzled others. Although critics were quick to suggest the variety of voices provided in the prose inserts, they have overlooked the variety of personalities Williams se? lected. All four historic characters have been identified as figures of poets, but critics have viewed them as masks or versions of Williams himself rather than as caricatures of his contemporaries.19 By careful 18 Mariani summarizes critical viewpoints on Williams from 1930 to 1945 in his chapter entitled "Holding Action," pp. 39-72. 19 Ralph Nash, in "The Use of Prose in 'Paterson,' " Perspective, VI (Autumn 1953), 196, suggests Williams used Pieter the dwarf as "a sardonic symbol of himself." joseph E. Slate identifies Tim Crane as Hart Crane in "William Carlos Williams, Hart Crane and 'The Virtue of History,' " Texas Studies in Literature and Language, VI (Winter 1965), 468-511. Slate reads Patch as a mask for Paterson. Although Sankey relates Mrs. Cumming</page><page sequence="11">WILLIAMS' PATERSON 247 selections of verbatim passages, addition of a few integrating lines, and just enough original composition to tie the characters to his language theme, Williams depicts and often satirizes four contemporary American poets who had great influence on the language of poetry during the first half of the twentieth century. Although unnamed in this first prose segment about him, Pieter the dwarf is called a "monster in human form" and has characteristics which can easily suggest Williams' views of Eliot. A large quantity of informa? tion about Pieter, also called "Big-headed Peter," was available to Wil? liams in the early forties, yet he chose a Revolutionary Officer's account to use verbatim except for slight changes in capitalization and the use of italics.20 It is easy to see why Williams could have selected this particular fragment as a caricature of Eliot. Eliot's intellectuality is satirized by the dwarf's inability to "support the enormous weight of his head," but the dwarf's interest in religion and connection with British politics are the details which finally pin down the identification. The dwarf, who is a "natural curiosity," is "visited by great numbers of people, and is peculiarly fond of the com? pany of clergymen, always inquiring for them among his visitors, and taking great pleasure in receiving religious instruction" (10). Eliot's con- version to Anglo-Catholicism was, to Williams, the beginning of his poetic downfall. Also like Eliot, the dwarf is acquainted with illustrious persons, for even General Washington has made him a visit and inquired "whether he was a Whig or a Tory." The dwarf claims to have taken no "active part" on either side, and Williams retains the original italics to indicate irony in this declaimer. By the mid-forties, Eliot's political attitudes had been well-established, particularly through his essay "The Idea of a Christian Society."21 In this essay, Eliot proposed the need for a close alliance between church and state but also professes himself unconcerned with the political forms of a Christian society. For anyone who followed Eliot's career as closely as Williams, it would not have and Patch to Williams' risks in Paterson (44), neither he nor any other critic has identified Cumming as a figure of any particular poet. 20 Mike Weaver, William Carlos Williams: The American Background (London: Cambridge University Press, 1971). Weaver traces Williams' pursuit of historic documents in pp. 115-21. In a note on p. 202, he indicates Williams' sources for the prose fragment on Pieter the dwarf: a lost manuscript borrowed by Williams from Herbert A. Fisher, "The Legends of the Passaic," which in turn draws from J. W. Barber and Henry Howe, Historical Collectionsof New/ersey (Newark, Newjersey: 1885), p. 407; and L. R. Trumbull, History oflndustrial Paterson (Paterson: Carleton M. Herrick, 1882), p. 20. The two latter books are available in the Paterson Public Library. Both quote the account Williams used, though they differ in their introductions, the context in which the quotation appears, and the details of capitalization and punctuation. 21 Bernard Bergonzi, 7. S. Eliot (Collier Books, 1972), pp. 127-30.</page><page sequence="12">248 KATHLEEN D. MATTHEWS been difficult to see the potential allegory in the historic account of Pieter the dwarf. After the prose fragment introducing the yet-unnamed dwarf, Williams added a line which stands apart from the smaller type in which the prose has been set: "A wonder! A wonder!" This expression is more than an exclamation at the dwarf's spectacular qualities; it is a unifying device which connects the dwarf to Sam Patch, the historic character who represents Ezra Pound. The expression is also used in the poetic insert which separates the story of Patch and Tim Crane, Williams' caricature of Hart Crane, from the tale of Patch's fatal leap over the Passaic Fails. In the second reference, however, Williams calls "the water pouring still / from the edge of the rock . . . / A wonder." Since the passage also associates Patch and Crane with Williams' language theme, the poets' search for a language becomes as miraculous as the dwarf. The process by which Williams intended to associate Pieter with Eliot can best be traced through early manuscripts of the poem in which Williams also used "a wonder" to unify his material. In very early drafts, the minister who appears in Book Two preached a sermon designed to represent a metaphorical leap over the fails and into the stream of language. The sermon concludes on a note of wonder combined with the irony of doubt. A wonder! A wonder in the woods. In the name of the Father and of His Blessed son Who died for you upon the cross of wood, Are these the truest words were ever said?22 When Williams decided to omit the minister from Book One, he prob? ably planned to associate the minister with the dwarf by calling him "A Wonder," for the early passage was retained through a fairly late draft of Book Two. 22 Unpublished manuscript E-4, Lockwood Library, SUNY, Buffalo.

Also in the final version, the minister and the dwarf are brought together in Paterson's mind during a moment of anger, a moment when Paterson suffers a strange metamorphosis and "his voice is drowned under the fails" (83). Thus, Eliot and other poets with Christian, economic, or political messages prevent Paterson's or Williams' voice from being heard. Not until the dwarf is dead in Book Four will Paterson be saved. At one point, Williams also considered using part of Book Three as a meditation on the minister's sermon.23 One fragment of the meditation shows how Williams considered his language theme as a direct challenge to Eliot and also how he associated Pieter the dwarf with Eliot's Peter the Rock. Let this be a stone in your crop the unformed language: and within the rock, entrapped cupped, when broken, like two hands holding the crystal, red and blue (Peter the rock. Gnaw on that, your meat, the language, the unformed language ? caught and held Williams never included this fragment which is far more blatant than most of his satire in Books One and Two. However, he did change the traditional spelling of Pieter to Peter and included in Book Four a frag? ment of prose depicting Peter's grave as a wind-up to the allegorical interpretation of Pieter's story. In Book Four, Pieter the waterhead is finally identified by name as Peter the dwarf who can be associated with the St. Peter of Eliot's religious pageant. In this account, Peter's remains are found in the cellar of an old church with the body buried separately from the head which is now only "an enormous skull" reminiscent ofthe large-headed monster in Book One and the "glabrous skull" (63) of the minister in Book Two. These details support an identity of Peter and the minister as Eliot, the intellectual poet who proclaimed Christianity anew. Significantly, the body is removed "to make room for a new furnace." The allegorical significance of this furnace also appears in Book Four where Williams introduces Madame Curie's discovery of radium as a major metaphor Yale manuscript: Paterson III. Early Notes and Drafts.</page><page sequence="14">250 KATHLEEN D. MATTHEWS for new discoveries in science and language. It will be the poet's task to work with the new twentieth-century furnace rather than with Eliot's old mythology. When the dwarf's body is removed from the church to make room for a new furnace, Williams suggests that Eliot's Christianity has been replaced by a new mode of thought. For Williams, the new science should have a vital relationship to new poetry. In any given era, the poetic forms must mirror the age in which they are written. Williams attempted to clarify the relationships of a people's myths to their society and their poetic forms in an essay written in 1947 and published in Touchstone, January 1948.24 Look! the fixed overall quality of all poems of the past was a plainly understandable counting. The lines were measured and in general evenly arranged?to reveal a similar orderliness of thought and behavior in the general pattern of their day. Such measures (notice the word) were synony- mous with a society, uniform, and made up of easily measurable integers, racial and philosophic. The arts were of that world aristocratic and, as time went on, Christian. Thus there was a correlation between the world as it stood politically and philosophically and the form of the poem that rep? resented it?notably so in Dante's terza rima. But how, today, shall a Christian address a sonnet, in form, to a Jew or a Negro? It might have an ironic meaning but little more than that. . . . But the greatest genius of our day is a Jew. He has invented a different counting. It would be a stupid insult to Einstein to write him a sonnet. We do not live in a sonnet world; we do not live even in an iambic world; certainly we do not live in a world of iambic pentameters. . . . such things are out of place for us today, and, if we haven't the wit to see it quite apart from discovering the inventiveness we should possess to go beyond that, then let us be the shallow artists our work for the most part shows us to be. But again an objection: Everything ofthe past's artistic forms shows such forms to have been related to an anthropomorphic myth in which we gravely believed. Today we have little more of that. Today a far more comprehensive myth has absorbed our beliefs?Science. But when I say science is a myth I disturb the good man and the scientist equally. But we have moved from the position of having our gods on the mountain in our back yards to the acceptance of the probability of the very non-existence of matter as such. . . . shall our poetic forms not show it? With such an attitude, Williams could hardly have completed an entire poem as the full development of a new anthropomorphic myth. He had to turn to science, the new myth. In Books Three and Four, the anthropomorphic aspects of the giant Paterson give way to Paterson, the man-poet. Williams does indeed create myth in Paterson, but in each book he carefully controls the kind of myth he creates.

Each is represented by an actual historic figure, but Williams slightly modified names and accounts of these figures, just enough to weave them into a homegrown allegory based on double entendre. Williams joins the others as Paterson, Pound's literary son and the only one who will survive his leap into the stream of language. As early as 1940, Williams had declared, "In the use of language Pound and Cummings are beyond doubt the two most distinguished American poets of today."25 By 1945, however, Pound was in disgrace and Cummings had done little to develop any coherent approach to language of the sort Williams sought. Sometime during the planning of Paterson Williams must have recognized the possibility of associating Cummings and Pound with two historic characters who had leaped to their deaths over the Passaic Fails. By using the Passaic River as a metaphor for a living language, Williams could indicate two poets who had been enticed by language but had not survived their encounters with it. Furthermore, some accounts of Sam Patch included references to Tim Crane, a tavern owner who had attempted to build a bridge across the fails. By careful manipulation of his historic sources, Williams could also associate Hart Crane with his language theme. E. E. Cummings is the first literary giant to be actually associated with the metaphorical stream of language. Cummings appears as a married couple, Sarah Cumming and her husband, Hopper Cumming, a minister from Newark. The minister represents two qualities Williams recognized in Cummings' work. In his 1946 essay, "Lower Case Cummings," Wil? liams noted, "The drunk, the whore, the child, are typical cummings heroes. (Is that Deacon Cummings speaking? Probably.)"26 Such moralism can be associated with Hopper Cumming when he appears as the minister "to supply . . . a destitute congregation." Williams also suggests in his essay that Cummings should not "be held too closely to account for some of his doodles, his fiddling with the paraphernalia of the writing game."27 Such fiddling refers to poems in which Cummings breaks up words into syllables or letters and combines groups of words 25 Letter from Williams to Laughlin, September 25, 1940. 26 William Carlos Williams, Selected Essays (New Directions, 1969), p. 266. 27 Williams, Selected Essays, p. 264.</page><page sequence="16">252 KATHLEEN D. MATTHEWS into nonstop expressions. One such early poem had appeared in Contact back in the thirties when Williams briefly attempted to revive the magazine; Cummings had fiddled in this poem with letters and syllables of the word grasshopper until the poem itself appeared to hop across the page.28 The grasshopper poem surely must have prompted Williams to rename the historic Hooper Cumming as "Hopper" Cumming.29 Neither Cummings' fiddling nor his moralism, however, had been the only reason why Williams declared at the beginning of his essay, "ee cummings means my language/' Instead, Williams admired the way Cummings adapted old words to new contexts to convey an acceptance of and joy in his environment, even the area around his apartment in New York City. To Williams, this meant discovering both a new language and the life which that language represents: cummings is the living presence of the drive to make all our convictions evident by penetrating through their costumes to the living flesh of the matter. He avoids the cliche first by avoiding the whole accepted modus of english. He does it, not to be "popular," God knows, nor to sell anything, but to lay bare the actual experience of love, let us say, in the chance terms which his environment happens to make apparent to him. He does it to reveal, to disclose, to free a man from habit. Habit is our continual enemy as artists and as men.30 This use of words to depict a living experience of love describes the element in Cummings' work which Williams himself was seeking. In Cummings' poems Williams sees a drive similar to his own toward new modes of expression which are distinctly American and are therefore a step toward discovering specifically American values. When Sarah Cum? ming fails or leaps into the Passaic River, she is enticed by such discov? ery. The words which follow her disappearance over the fails refer both to the prose which reports her story and to the reason for her fall: "A false language. A true. A false language pouring?a / language (misun- derstood) pouring (misinterpreted) without / dignity, without minister, crashing upon a stone ear" (15). The language "without minister" is more than a pun on Sarah's departure from her husband, for it is also the language which the American poet must understand and interpret. Cummings, in some of his work, makes just such an attempt; thus, he qualifies at least as a partial leaper into the stream of language. Though 28 E. E. Cummings, Contact #2, I, No. 1 (February 1932), 11. 29 Weaver, p. 202, notes Williams' source as Barber and Howe, Historical Collections, p. 412. He neglects to note, however, that the name in this source is the Rev. Hooper Cumming. 30 Williams, Selected Essays, pp. 265-66.</page><page sequence="17">WILLIAMS' PATERSON 253 Sarah Cumming is killed by her leap or fall, Hopper returns to his home in Newark. When Book One went to press, it appeared that Williams had plans for playing with the name Hopper. He had already decided to incorpo- rate a flight of grasshoppers as "couriers" or "outriders" to announce Paterson's coming. In his earliest handwritten notes, grasshopper is written as two words, and Williams instructs himself, "Love, the grass hopper - combats the sleep of their ways." In an early draft of Book Two, Williams includes "grass-hoppers," now sometimes hyphenated, as contributors to the many voices in the air, voices which compete with the minister's harangue.31 Because Williams had taken the trouble to change his Book One character's name to Hopper Cumming and because the grasshoppers appear to represent love for a living environment and an attempt to express that environment, it appears that Williams intended an associ- ation between E. E. Cummings and the grasshoppers. But Williams had trouble with the grasshopper passages. He modified them and then modified the modifications.32 In the final version of Book Two the grass? hoppers still serve as "couriers to the ceremonial of love" (48) and by their "churring song" can still be considered voices of nature and of love. Ironically, however, the grasshoppers and their music, like the other voices in the park, go unnoticed by the Sunday crowd. Paterson struggles to catch a particular accent in the voices which surround him, but he cannot sort them out. The grasshoppers, like the language ofthe fails, can only be heard in dreams. The grasshoppers of love fail as surely as Sarah Cumming's leap had failed. As Book Two draws to a close, Williams borrows a technique from E. E. Cummings to explain the failure. In a passage with words designed to look like the fails over which she plunged, Sarah's fall isrecapitulated. She was married with empty words: better to stumble at the edge to fall fall and be ?divorced 31 SUNY manuscripts E-8 and E-18. 32 SUNY manuscripts E20, E21, E22, E24, and E25.</page><page sequence="18">254 KATHLEEN D. MATTHEWS from the insistence of place? from knowledge, from learning?the terms foreign, conveying no immediacy, pouring down. (83) E. E. Cummings' work contained some of the elements Williams admired, but Cummings had not sufficiently pulled together his language experiments and his love of the American scene into any coherent poetics for other American poets. Sarah's fall seems to illustrate a divorce in Cummings' work which prevented him from surviving in the stream of language. Because references to Eliot and Cummings are conveyed through double entendre and are related to an allegorical reading of Book One, Williams could be fairly sure their identities would not be noted when Book Two was published in a single volume. No reader of Book One had mentioned either Eliot or Cummings in relation to "the monster in human form" or Hopper Cumming. No one had seen Pound in Sam Patch, and even Hart Crane, most obvious of the literary giants, had not been identified in 1947. Hart Crane and Ezra Pound appear as Tim Crane and Sam Patch in a long historic account of the first attempt to bridge the Passaic Fails. Although Williams would have found information about Sam Patch in several sources, he chose the one which associated Patch with Crane, selected and arranged segments which he could use verbatim to achieve the emphasis he wanted, then incorporated other details into a prose segment he himself composed. His source for the material is A Little Story of Old Paterson by Charles Pitman Longwell. Most ofthe material about Patch and Crane comes from Chapter Five, though Williams did transfer a few important details from other chapters.33 Even more signif? icant is what Williams omitted and what he added. Most material which could not possibly be related to Pound or Crane was dropped. Williams composed instead an entire segment to introduce his language theme and condense the material concluding Patch's story. Williams opens his account with a quotation that begins in the middle of a paragraph two-thirds of the way into LongwelPs fifth chapter. By this means he stresses the most significant event, "everything made in readiness to pull the clumsy bridge into position" (15). The significance of this clumsy bridge becomes apparent when the reader learns "the 33 Charles Pitman Longwell, A Little Story of Old Paterson: as told by an old man (Paterson, 1901), Chapter 5, pp. 37-42. This obscure volume is available at the Paterson Public Library.</page><page sequence="19">WILLIAMS' PATERSON 255 happiest man in the town that day was Timothy B. Crane who had charge of the bridge." At this point the clumsy bridge also becomes Hart Crane's poem The Bridge. By the time he compiled Book One, Williams probably had read Philip Horton's 1937 biography of Crane.34 In the biography, Horton uses letters from Crane to indicate Crane's admiration for Eliot's poem The Waste Land but also his dislike of its negative implications. Crane's answer to Eliot's early pessimism had been a kind of naTve and optimistic mysticism. Horton attributed Crane's mysticism to his heavy drinking. As early as 1939, Williams was associating Eliot and Crane as poets who "want to speak directly to the soul and its difficulties."35 It is impossible to know exactly when Williams decided to associate Tim Crane with Hart Crane, but the details he carefully selected and arranged for his historic narrative can be read allegorically. Tim Crane's occupation as tavern keeper certainly suggests an identity with Hart Crane, the heavy drinker. Also, since Tim Crane built the bridge to prevent his rival tavern keeper from getting advantage of the hundred steps on the other side of the fails, Williams could have seen this as Crane's poem preventing his rival Eliot from getting an advantage in the area of mystical poetry. When Crane was finishing The Bridge, Eliot published Ash Wednesday, his own mystical answer to his earlier doubts and skepticism. Ash Wednesday presents a spiritual ascension depicted in part by the image of climbing a spiral staircase. Lest readers should miss the association, Williams included not only the term "Jacob's Lad- der" which appears in Chapter Five of his source, but also the terms "hundred steps" and "long rustic winding stairs" which had to be trans- ferred from the previous chapter.36 In Paterson, the "long, rustic, winding stair" which benefits Fyfield, Crane's competitor, parodies the circular staircase of Ash Wednesday and further suggests that Eliot's religion is just another version of Crane's drunken mysticism. Both are belittled by comparison. When Crane's clumsy bridge topples into the Passaic River, an entire mystical approach to poetry topples. Williams makes another association with Eliot's work when a "wooden pin" causes Crane's bridge to topple. Crane had been an early disciple of Eliot's poetic theories. Williams' "wooden" bridge and "wooden" pin are similar to the use of wood in poetic fragments found in early man- Philip Horton, Hart Crane: The Life of an American Poet (1937; rpt.

MATTHEWS uscripts, fragments which also appear to be associated with Eliot. Wil? liams apparently wanted to play on the title of Eliot's earliest book of criticism, The Sacred Wood. Natural ly, it is Patch, therefore Pound, who rescues the "wooden pin" which has slipped and caused Crane's bridge to topple. By allowing Pound, as Patch, to rescue the underpin- nings of Crane's bridge, Williams suggests that Pound has been able to separate the basic values of Eliot's criticism from the more clumsy and worthless aspects. Therefore, Pound, not Crane, is the real hero of the twenties and thirties. Like Patch, however, the heroic Pound becomes a victim of his own bravado. Patch first enters the Crane fragment as a resident of Paterson described by the narrator as "my boss" who "many a time . . . gave me a cuff over the ears" (16). Pound's letters to Williams contain many literary cuffs and Williams' letters to others indicate his frequent exasperation over them. By the time he compiled Book One, Williams had decided to envision Pound as a teacher and literary father to Paterson, but only a father who would influence Paterson in his youth. Although the term "boss" and fatherly cuffs are appropriate for suggesting Pound's attitude toward Williams, they are also ironic, for the father will leap to his literary death in Book One while the son escapes. Pound's bragging is given particular significance in the Patch fragment. Patch had boasted so frequently that he would jump over the fails that he had been "placed under arrest at various times" and "had previously been locked up in the basement under the bank with a bad case of delirium tremens." Again, at this point, Williams departed from the chapter which was his major source to transfer from another chapter the detail that the jail was located under the bank.37 By 1946, references to imprisonment would suggest Pound's incarceration at St. Elizabeth's Hospital, but being locked up in the basement of a bank also suggests an arrest in Pound's literary progress as a result of his single-minded concern with money systems and their relationship to evil in the world. Furthermore, Pound's incarceration under a bank could suggest still another arrest in his development at the time of his close association with Eliot, the days when Eliot had worked in a bank. Although Williams no doubt enjoyed his hidden humor in comparing the careers of Patch and Pound, Pound's real literary value to Williams had revolved around his early proclamations regarding Imagism and his Longwell, Chapter 7, p. 52.</page><page sequence="21">WILLIAMS' PATERSON 257 experimentation with the poetic line. Pound had first stimulated Wil? liams' interest in colloquial language and had prompted Williams to abandon metrics which simulated a metronome. Throughout his life, no matter how angry Williams became about Pound's political or economic foolishness, he respected Pound's use of the poetic line. Pound was therefore the perfect figure to make early successful leaps into Williams' stream of language. Even Pound could not survive, how? ever, and Williams needed to manipulate his historic material to indicate why. Williams altered his material to associate Tim Crane with Sam Patch by changing the name of Sam Pope in his original source to Sam Patch in his own version. After describing Crane's physical appearance, Wil? liams continued, "He was well known to the other citizens as a man of much energy and no little ability. In his manner, he resembled the large, rugged stature of Sam Patch." In addition to associating the two literary giants, this passage adds meaning to Patch's boast, "Now, old Tim Crane thinks he has done something great, but I can beat him." Hart Crane had given American history a central place in The Bridge long before Pound began introducing massive amounts of American history into The Cantos. Williams, however, believed Pound's effective inclusion of actual letters from John Adams and Thomas Jefferson was far more daring than Crane's symbolic use of history. Williams manipulated his material even more by composing the final prose fragment which depicts Patch's and Pound's demise. As Patch left his native area and jumped into other streams, his fame increased just as Pound's fame had increased as he moved from his native country to England, from England to France, and from France to Italy. As his fame increased, Patch took to speechmaking before each plunge into a new stream, and people traveled great distances "to see the wonder." Finally, away from home territory, speech failed Patch after "the word had been drained from its meaning." Patch plunged to his death when his words no longer had meaning just as Pound had plunged to his literary death as a result of meaningless speechmaking on behalf of the Fascists over the Italian broadcastingsystem. When Book One appeared, Pound's literary death seemed certain, but Pound had prepared the way for Wi11 iams as surely as Patch prepares the way for Noah F. Paterson. Williams, as Paterson, joins the Cummings, Crane, and Pound alle? gory by way of a flamboyant billboard placed strategically between prose fragments.</page><page sequence="22">258 KATHLEEN D. MATTHEWS THE GRRRREAT HISTORY of that old time Jersey Patriot N. F. PATERSON! (N for Noah; F for Faitoute; P for short) "Jersey Lightning" to the boys. (15) Immediately preceding the Patch and Crane fragment, this interjected announcement demonstrates Williams' sense of humor. In the opening pages, Paterson's thoughts had plunged drunkenly over the fails "to hit the rocks: to a thunder, / as if lightning had struck." Now Paterson is featured as a local hero nicknamed "Jersey Lightning," the term for a local applejack or cider brandy, a popular alcoholic drink, particularly during Prohibition years. This illustriousdrunken giant will survive where other giants have fallen to their deaths. His full name provides hints both to his literary lineage and his methods of survival. Noah, Paterson's first name, suggests the Biblical Noah and his sur? vival of the flood; Paterson survives the flood of language. Noah also suggests Noah Webster, whom H. L. Mencken had cited as one ofthe earliest Americans to insist on a distinctly American language.38 Like Webster, Paterson seeksthe historic beginningsof that particularly Amer? ican idiom, welcoming both the polyglot contributions of immigrants and the native contributions of aboriginal Indians. Faitoute, Paterson's second name, meaning "does all," is similarly appropriate. Throughout Paterson, Williams does all that Eliot, Pound, and Crane have done, then discovers beyond them. He creates myth as successful as the myths Eliot had used, then abandons anthropomor? phic myth for scientific metaphors. He incorporates history as effectively as Pound but uses it for dual purposes. He celebrates the American landscape as enthusiastically as Crane even as he recognizes the indus? trial deformity associated with it. As he writes knowingly of his own locality, he develops an allegory as rich in literary allusions as work by Eliot or Pound. The allegory is personal and contemporary. It tells the story of Williams and his fellow poets of the twentieth century, of his need to separate himself from them in order to develop an appropriate poetics for America. Williams, as the giant Paterson, survives in part because he does all. H. L. Mencken, The American Language (Alfred A. Knopf, 1936), pp. 380-81.</page><page sequence="23">WILLIAMS' PATERSON 259 Paterson finally survives his plunge into the stream of language be? cause he knows what to accept from his literary father and what to reject. The very name Paterson combines pater and son, father and son. "P for short" suggests that the name can also be shortened to Patch, thus to Pound. In Section Three of Book One, Williams uses the letter P to introduce a quotation from Pound.39 "Your interest is in the bloody loam but what I'm after is the finished product" (37). On a literal level, the quotation refers to Williams' preference for the raw materials of his poem rather than a perfected work of art. On a comic level, "the bloody loam" has become a "finished product," for Williams has created an anthropomor? phic giant from the very ground he walks on. When "I," probably Williams the narrator rather than Paterson the giant, responds to "P," his answer is equally clever: "Leadership passes into empire; empire begets insolence; insolence brings ruin." The answer parodies Pound's expansive theories of civilization in cadenced language reminiscent of some passages from The Cantos. Ironically, the narrator also depicts Pound's literary career. Pound's leadership in the poetic revolution had placed him at the head of a literary empire, but a single-minded correlation of his economic theories with Mussolini's fascist aims in the late thirties and early forties had led to his ruin. Despite a greater sympathy for Pound than for Eliot, Williams identifies Pound's misapplication of his economic theories as the major factor which perverted Pound's talent with language. Paterson survives in the stream of language because Williams can separate his literary father's valuable contributions from his crackpot schemes. In many ways, Book One of Paterson is Williams' virtuoso perfor? mance. He defies tradition by using prose and poetry together. He creates a lyrical myth and undercuts the very creation of myth at the same time. He dips into local history to turn it in one direction until it becomes myth and in another direction until it becomes satire. He begins to roll up a devastating picture of the literary landscape and a mock-heroic picture of his own local landscape which includes satire and celebration simultaneously. But the mockery in Williams' perfor? mance was not fully understood by those early readers who perceived an epic when Williams thought he was writing a satire. 39 Sankey identifies the quotation from Pound but suggests that "?" and "I" are "two voices (minds) to Paterson" (66).</page><page sequence="24">260 In May of 1945, after Book One had gone to the printer, Williams wrote to Laughlin about "having fun reading the history of Greek Lit.: Studies of the Creek Poets by John Aldington Symonds."40 Within a month, he discovered in his reading a quotation which he described to Laughlin as "the single footnote to the entire poem."41 This important addition comes from Symonds' chapter "The Satirists," specifically the last portion which depicts Hipponax, the Greek satirist who restored satire to its "primitive function" and "used the iambic as a weapon of personal attack. . . ."42 Without mentioning personal attack, Williams chose to use a major segment of the paragraph which relates "the de- formed and mutilated verses" to "the distorted subjects with which they dealt?the vices and perversions of humanity?as welI as their agreement with the snarling spirit of the satirist" (40). Williams' own spirit may well have been snarling in the early years when he was first planning and composing Paterson. Publication of Book One, however, launched Williams into a prominence he had never known before. Suddenly, he was compared favorably with the very poets he had begun to satirize. If he had planned to reveal his satire more blatantly in future books, as some unused fragments from early manuscripts suggest, he would change his mind and continue to incorporate satire primarily through double entendre. In Book One he had provided the satiric bedrock for a poem with a comic dimension. Later books would also include satiric elements presented through dou? ble entendre: satiric jabs and parodic echoes which accumulate meaning in accordance with the foundation laid down in Book One. 40 Letter from Williams to Laughlin, May 15, 1945. 41 Letter from Williams to Laughlin, June 14, 1945. 42 John Aldington Symonds, Studies ofthe Greek Poets (Harper and Brothers, 1901), I, 283.</page></plain_text>
