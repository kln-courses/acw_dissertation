<plain_text><page sequence="1">Realism as a Practical and Cosmic Joke ALEXANDER WELSH This essay consists of four parts: an illustration of the idea of existence as a cosmic joke; an excursus on ordinary practical jokes; a retrospect of quixotic fictions; and an examination of Samuel Pickwick, victim of circumstances, in the light of a Kierkegaardian joke. By the end of the nineteenth century the conditions of existence were commonly regarded as a bad joke. Thus Thomas Hardy entitled a group of poems "Time's Laughingstocks" (1904) and referred in the last line of Tess of the d'Urbervilles (1891) to the "sport" the President of the Immortals had enjoyed with his heroine. Or Joseph Conrad wrote of the "infernal joke" and "burlesque mean- ness" of the apparent collision that cost the hero of Lord Jim (1900) his honor and career, and consequently his death. An actual ship had been deserted by its officers in the Indian Ocean in 1880, but Conrad, in order to make a bad joke worse, included "one of us" in the affair and made the circumstances more incongruous: the S. S. Jeddah had been abandoned in rough weather with a flooded engine room; the Patna, in a calm sea after nothing more than a bump in the night. These writers worked in the shadow of a century-long debate over the origin and destiny of the created universe. Because the starting point of the debate in received Christianity was theistic and, let us admit, anthropomorphic, the question of intent of creation was always prominent; and now, at the end of the century, writers like Hardy and Conrad were forced to contemplate a universe without conscious purpose. Creation was gratuitous, like a needless practical joke. Created beings therefore experienced what Albert Camus and others would call the absurd, "that divorce between the mind that desires and the world that disappoints." 1 The notion of a cosmic joke is well illustrated by an essay entitled "A Free Man's Worship" that Bertrand Russell contributed to the Independent Review in 1903. Russell can properly be regarded as a Victorian at this time; he was thirty-one when the essay appeared, and the joke itself summarizes the nineteenth-century views on which it is founded. It is a Mephistophelian account of creation, in which God is reported to have smiled inwardly before and after the event. The endless praises of the choirs of angels had begun to grow wearisome; for, after all, did he not deserve their praise? Had he not given them endless 1 The Myth of Sisyphus, trans. Justin O'Brien (New York: Vintage Books, 1955), p. 37.</page><page sequence="2">NOVELJFALL 1975 joy? Would it not be more amusing to obtain undeserved praise, to be worshipped by beings whom he tortured? He smiled inwardly, and resolved that the great drama should be performed. For countless ages the hot nebula whirled aimlessly through space. At length it began to take shape, the central mass threw off planets, the planets cooled, boiling seas and burning mountains heaved and tossed, from black masses of cloud hot sheets of rain deluged the barely solid crust. And now the first germ of life grew in the depths of the ocean, and developed rapidly in the fructifying warmth into vast forest trees, huge ferns springing from the damp mould, sea monsters breeding, fighting, devouring, and passing away. And from the monsters, as the play unfolded itself, Man was born, with the power of thought, the knowledge of good and evil, and the cruel thirst for worship. And Man saw that all is passing in this mad, monstrous world, that all is struggling to snatch, at any cost, a few brief moments of life before Death's inexorable decree. And Man said: "There is a hidden purpose, could we but fathom it, and the purpose is good; for we must reverence something, and in the visible world there is nothing worthy of reverence." And Man stood aside from the struggle, resolving that God intended harmony to come out of chaos by human efforts. And when he followed the instincts which God had transmitted to him from his ancestry of beasts of prey, he called it Sin, and asked God to forgive him. But he doubted whether he could be justly forgiven, until he invented a divine Plan by which God's wrath was to have been appeased. And seeing the present was bad, he made it yet worse, that thereby the future might be better. And he gave God thanks for the strength that enabled him to forego even the joys that were possible. And God smiled; and when he saw that Man had become perfect in renunciation and worship, he sent another sun through the sky, which crashed into Man's sun; and all returned again to nebula. "Yes," he murmured, "it was a good play; I will have it performed again." 2 Only the framework of this story is invented. Everything bracketed by God's smiles really happened, according to the best authorities of the day. Even the rationalist account of Man's religion is historical, according to Russell. The framework he adds simply as an explanation of existence: purposeless, gratuitous, and comparable to a practical joke in that its motivation, if any, is entirely dis- proportionate to its effect ("would it not be more amusing to obtain undeserved praise, to be worshipped by beings whom he tortured?"). The view of religion shifts radically from within the story to this overview, in which Russell does not subvert religion but proves himself "in" on the joke, as we say: for one of the only successful ways to respond to a practical joke is to pretend that one appreciates it. Russell's opening paragraphs bear only incidentally on received religion. They are intended to characterize an up-to-date scientific view. "Such, in outline, but 2 "A Free Man's Worship," The Basic Writings of Bertrand Russell, ed. Robert E. Egner and Lester E. Denonn (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1961), pp. 66-67. 24</page><page sequence="3">ALEXANDER WELSHJPRACTICAL JOKES even more purposeless, more void of meaning," the essay continues, "is the world which Science presents for our belief." Even more purposeless and more void of meaning because science tells this story without the framework, without even the bad joke. Then Russell moves steadily into his eloquent statement of the conditions of existence: That Man is the product of causes which had no prevision of the end they were achieving; that his origin, his growth, his hopes and fears, his loves and his beliefs, are but the outcome of accidental collocations of atoms; that no fire, no heroism, no intensity of thought and feeling, can preserve an in- dividual life beyond the grave; that all the labours of the ages, all the devotion, all the inspiration, all the noonday brightness of human genius, are destined to extinction in the vast death of the solar system, and that the whole temple of Man's achievement must inevitably be buried beneath the debris of a universe in ruins-all these things, if not quite beyond dispute, are yet so nearly certain, that no philosophy which rejects them can hope to stand. Only with the scaffolding of these truths, only on the firm foundation of unyielding despair, can the soul's habitation henceforth be safely built.3 The putative joke of Russell's opening is thus hammered into a duller irony, the disparity between human experience, including hope and courage, and purpose- less reality, commencing in accident and ending in the dissolution of the universe. The irony is far bleaker, though less confused, than that of Tennyson's In Memoriam a half-century earlier. It closely resembles the central irony of Hardy's major work, The Dynasts (1904-08), which translated historical events of the beginning of the nineteenth century into the ethos of its close-the "intolerable antilogy," as Hardy called it, "of making figments feel." 4 Russell and Hardy clearly anticipate the position of Camus at the following mid-century in their definition of the absurd and in the moral they draw. The Dynasts and "A Free Man's Worship" celebrate courage for its own sake. It is true that Russell, in this essay, first counsels "renunciation," whereas Camus "cannot conceive that a skeptical metaphysics can be joined to an ethics of renuncia- tion." 5 But in this respect Russell is solidly Victorian and nicely confirms our notions of chronology and nationality. Russell's claim to construct a philosophy from "unyielding despair" recalls a number of existentialist thinkers; Hardy acknowledged a debt to Eduard von Hartmann and Arthur Schopenhauer. But it is not necessary to go to the Continent to view the background of their attitude. It derives, first of all, from an earlier protest against Christian apologetics, especially the argument that divine goodness and human goodness are not the same, and that manifest evil and divine omnipotence therefore need not be contradictory. John Stuart Mill had offered to go to hell rather than accept this argument, and in his refutation of Henry Mansel one can feel his indignation over an argument that seemed 3 Ibid., p. 67. 4 The Dynasts (London: Macmillan, 1965), Pt. I, Act IV, sc. vi, p. 77. 6 The Myth of Sisyphus, p. 41. 25</page><page sequence="4">NOVELIFALL 1975 nothing better than a trick: "The Divine Power is always interpreted in a completely human signification, but the Divine Goodness and Justice must be understood to be such only in an unintelligible sense." 6 The rise of historicism, of science, and of social science had meanwhile broadcast a growing conviction that the conditions of existence were no more responsive to God's wishes than to man's. Once historians had discovered that men lived in a continuing stream of history, once Charles Lyell and others knew that the earth was changing underneath their feet, once Darwin and Spencer were persuaded that life itself in all its forms was subject to change, and once word leaked out that thermo- dynamics postulated an increasingly random organization of matter and the diminution of available energy, there was little latitude for any conclusion but that man was a victim of forces beyond any deliberate control. When compared with what he had imagined previously, and still wished, the prospect made it seem that he was a victim of a joke. Relatively early in this period, which witnessed the most far-reaching transformation ever, in all its details, of mankind's conception of itself, the prospect did not seem all that bad or all that funny. In his essay on "The Spirit of the Age" (1831), written in his Saint- Simonian phase when he was only twenty-five, Mill diagnosed this change in world-view but then saluted the extrahuman forces: "Let us place our trust for the future," he wrote, "not in the wisdom of mankind, but in something far surer-the force of circumstances. . . ." 7 Poets, Mill later admitted, knew more about passions than he did as a young man; and novelists, I submit, knew better than to trust to circumstances. The attitude I have summarized so far takes little account of a curious fact about practical jokes played by men and women upon each other: namely, that such jokes occur more often in literature than in life. The entire action of The Mayor of Casterbridge (1886), for example, follows from a cruel jest that turns into a practical joke. Michael Henchard actually sells his wife when the resentments of both parties render words inadequate. Hardy's "man of char- acter," moreover, is continually joking. He intends and does not intend to harm others. He thrusts Donald Farfrae to the edge of the hayloft, but decides not to throw him over. He reads Lucetta's old love letters to Farfrae, but conceals their identity and claims it was only a "practical joke." Like Susan and Lucetta themselves, he conceals and then reveals crucial information at the strangest times. Toward the end Henchard tells the sailor Newson, Elizabeth-Jane's actual father, that she is dead. He does not quite expect to be believed; and Newson, once again, is the only one who appreciates the joke: he laughs outright when he learns the truth and exclaims, "'twas a good joke, and well carried out, and I give the man credit for't!" 8 Hardy may be trying to tell us something about the resilience of this obscure sailor who, far from protesting, took advantage of Henchard's first joke years before by purchasing Susan for five guineas.

There are, indeed, plentiful occasions in the novel in which coincidence or simply the weather plays a joke on Henchard. On the other hand, one might argue that the jokes of human agency compete against or detract from the significance of the circumstantial jokes. There is no easy answer. Even the bull who chases Elizabeth-Jane and Lucetta around the barn is said to have "perhaps rather intended a practical joke than a murder"; and the infamous skimmity-ride, which does murder Lucetta, is a traditional shaming joke used "when a man's wife is-well, not particularly his own." 9 Practical jokes abound in literature: in the picaresque and quixotic modes of the novel, in fabliaux and the Italian beffe, and even in some epic materials. I therefore assume that realistic literature has a special need for recounting jokes. D. H. Lawrence, interestingly enough, assumed a different explanation. Lawrence translated in 1929 a sixteenth-century beffa by Antonio Francesco Grazzini, The Story of Doctor Manente, and argued in his introduction that the Floren- tines of the time frequently played such jokes.'? There may be grounds for believing that practical jokes were at one time practiced more freely than in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries; but surely practical jokes occupy a greater proportion of narrative time, whether true or false, than of the day-to-day activities of people in any age, including the types of people who appear in such stories. Consider the inverse proposition. The nineteenth century affords many stories of people who are victims of circumstance, but it is unlikely that there were proportionately more persons who fell victim to circumstances in the nineteenth century than in the sixteenth. There were, to be sure, differences in the stories. The Story of Doctor Manente, the tenth and last story of Grazzini's Le Cene, is briefly summarized as follows: for little reason at all, Lorenzo the Magnificent kidnaps Manente when he is drunk, makes it seem as though he has died of the plague, and releases him months later when his wife has remarried and is with child by her second husband; after Lorenzo has amused himself further, he puts the blame for the joke upon a supposed necromancer and patches up the bigamy. It is a kind of teleological suspension of the ethical that Lorenzo has carried out, except that the teleology is hardly discernible. In the nineteenth century Tenny- son beautifully narrated a similar story, in which the telos is similarly weak. Tennyson did not think of Enoch Arden (1864) as a joke, but the hero of his popular poem is so utterly a victim of circumstances that it is not tragic. The entirely meritorious Enoch Arden is shipwrecked upon a distant island, his meritorious wife eventually remarries another childhood friend; Enoch returns but conceals from his family that he still lives, and Enoch dies. The arbitrary Lorenzo has been replaced-by what? God? Circumstance? It was, and is, difficult to say. The bigamy is also repaired differently-by a special Victorian 9 Ibid., ch. 29, p. 179; ch. 36, p. 225. 10 The Story of Doctor Manente, trans. D. H. Lawrence (Florence: Orioli, 1929), pp. xv-xvii. 27</page><page sequence="6">NOVELIFALL 1975 hint that the first husband will be united with a certain deceased child of the first marriage, and by the expensive funeral mentioned in the last line. But though Lorenzo has vanished and Tennyson is the only necromancer, a bad joke has certainly been played on Enoch. The story by Grazzini, Lawrence contended, displayed "the superb earthly life-courage" of Doctor Manente;1l the story by Tennyson-and there were other stories of the kind-displays the self-sacrifice of Enoch Arden. The antagonists of the two stories, phenomenally as different as a Medici prince and bad weather, nevertheless function alike and are experi- enced alike in the broadest sense. The actions are pointless, gratuitous, un- necessary. II Before pursuing literary history further it is important to ask what is meant by a "practical joke." The sense of the adjective is not workable, practical as opposed to impractical. The implied opposition is undoubtedly nonverbal. Practical jokes are jokes that require acting out; their use of words, if any, is incidental. There may be a corollary that such jokes are easier to carry out than verbal jokes: for the practical joker the so-called punch-line of a joke need only be a punch on the shoulder accompanied by a friendly grin. It seems probable that man was capable of practical jokes well before he became homo sapiens. Dogs and other animals engage in play that is like rudimentary joking, and that may be why practical jokes are held in low esteem by persons of wit and learning. Experience suggests that practical jokes are either experimental or demonstra- tive. The two categories overlap, and in their extension as group activities they tend to converge. The experimental joke is the more subjective, the joker himself is more uncertain, and the personal valuation of both parties is at stake. The demonstrative joke is more objective, the joker less obviously involved, and personal identity is at stake. That is, in the first sort of joke the wish to be valued or to make a valuation is prominent in the relationship that the joke seeks to explore; in the second, the wish to be the same as, or different from, the other person is prominent. Love and hatred (it is not clear which) are the ultimate grounds of the experimental joke; superiority and inferiority (the joker claims superiority), the grounds of the demonstrative joke. All testimony I have gathered on this subject indicates that practical jokes occur most frequently in the midst of a definable social group, usually a peer group. Summer camps, college dormitories, and businessmen's clubs are favorite arenas, and the jokes are typically conducted among youthful persons of whatever age. The number of jokes in which the "punishment" meted out consists of sheer embarrassment rather than pain is indicative of a group function. In groups the experimental joke may become a test of membership, both for the individual victim and the 11 Ibid., p. xiv. 28</page><page sequence="7">ALEXANDER WELSH PRACTICAL JOKES others. The demonstrative joke may become an act of discipline and even vengeance. In large groups so many factors are intertwined that jokes are difficult to classify. What is the foolish significance of a friendly punch on the shoulder? This is a simple experimental joke and depends weakly on surprise. Without surprise there is no uncertainty, and without uncertainty, no joke. What momentarily must appear as an act of aggression, then, is merely a gratuitous punch on the shoulder. The object is struck on purpose, but not with the pure intent of hurting him. The joke appeals to a pre-established tolerance, and hence these two individuals alone may be thought of as an organized group. The aggression, here as in most practical jokes, is unmistakable, and that is another reason why such jokes, and all back-slapping, are disliked by civilized persons. Yet this particular greeting fairly translates as, "I hate you but I love you." The extent to which the joke signals love is evident from the way that it frequently misfires: more happy-go-lucky punches are resented for the presumption of friendship than for the mild element of aggression. The experiment itself may also be resented by one who does not feel the same need to test the personal relation as the subject does. But the limits of love as well as hatred are being explored nevertheless. One joke, repeated so often when I was a boy that the surprise was only physical, nicely illustrates this ambivalence. When just at that age when we began to roam about without adult supervision-supervision that had been ever mindful of looking both ways before crossing the street-it was a favorite trick to shove a friend off balance into the oncoming traffic, while at the same time grabbing his jacket and pulling him back onto the curb. The saying that often accompanied the trick-"Saved your life!"-expressed all the love that a human being or a dog is capable of; but I never played this joke and shook with anger as well as fear when it was played upon me. I suppose it was repeated until I learned not to show my anger, or until I learned to trust my friends as they trusted me. It was, of course, an appropriate exercise in the transition from filial dependence to the condition which is called "independence" but which is really dependence upon one's peers. The experimental function of such a joke suggests a homely explanation of the popularity of the cosmic joke in the late nineteenth century. That was a way of adjusting from filial trust in God to the necessity of getting along on one's own-which for some writers, like Conrad, explicitly meant getting along together. "We exist only in so far as we hang together," was Captain Marlow's way of putting itl2-with an unconscious pun on "hang" that recalls the dangers of my adolescence. The demonstrative joke, as conducted on the ordinary human level, is well illustrated by the ancient procedure of pulling a chair out from under a person as he sits down-or even more simply, tripping a person as he walks by. These jokes imply less concern with the victim's response; they seem to concentrate on the actual come-down, the physical hurt or the acute embarrassment. In a curious way the joker is associating with his victim, rather than testing an emotional 12 Lord Jim, ed. Thomas C. Moser (New York: Norton, 1968), ch. 21, p. 136. 29</page><page sequence="8">NOVELJFALL 1975 relation. Though the trick implies a boast of superiority, one cannot make such a boast without admitting grounds for comparison. The demonstrative joke calls attention to the common predicaments of existence. The come-down upon the floor or into disgrace is something to which everyone is susceptible. It takes a long time to learn to walk, and it is impossible to sit down, on our most common article of furniture, without turning one's back to it. These are perilous balancing acts. Every act of sitting down, especially, depends on faith. Removing a chair after the victim has checked its presence out of the corner of his eye destroys, more effectively than the most skeptical philosophy, what David Hume called "the notion of the independent and continued existence" of things. An accident is thus generated; but it is no accident that this is a classic practical joke. Without being permanently harmful (in most cases) it shatters the faith in the external world and, because the victim also loses control of himself, makes him ridiculous in the eyes of his fellows. Two kinds of trust have been violated: trust in the stability of things and trust that friends will not play tricks like that. All practical jokes have to do with materiality in that they are practical. It is not essential that something be said to the victim but that something be done to him. And all have to do with trust because the victim is blithely unaware of what will happen. The experimental joke involves mutual trust; the demonstra- tive joke, trust in the existence of things. Both suddenly bring trustfulness and materiality into juxtaposition, to see what will happen in the one case and to prove what will happen in the other. They are pragmatic in spirit and often practiced in peer groups (though the latter observation is not one that I am elaborating here). The ordinary messages of the jokes, considered as com- munications, are "Let's not take anything for granted" and "Don't take anything for granted." The nineteenth-century cosmic joke takes its comfort from experimental jokes, which hover between love and hate with an ambivalence far more welcome, whatever the risk to the object, than the unrelieved enmity of the powerful. Compare Russell's speculation that creation was a joke with some of Swinburne's charges against "The supreme evil, God." 13 Russell pretends to accept God as an equal who has played a joke on him, whereas Swinburne childishly hates back. Russell and his contemporaries had to be satisfied that no intention was better than a bad intention, and they found an analogue for the purposeless universe in the apparently gratuitous joke. The demonstration of reality in the second type of joke explains why so many practical jokes crowd the pages of realistic literature. Because literary fictions are by definition removed from reality, they recover lost ground by recording innumerable practical jokes. The narrated jokes reduplicate the effort of realism itself, which confounds desire, belief, trustfulness with materiality-or so it can be argued. Don Quixote, who trusts more deeply in himself and his cultural heritage than any reasonable person, is easily the most famous victim of practical jokes. 13 Atalanta in Calydon, ed. Morse Peckham (Indianapolis &amp; New York: Bobbs-Merrill, 1970), p. 249. 30</page><page sequence="9">ALEXANDER WELSH PRACTICAL JOKES III Modern readers fail to appreciate the deliberate jokes narrated by Cervantes. We prefer episodes in which Don Quixote's imagination clashes freely with his surroundings to those episodes in which he is merely tricked. Even sophisticated admirers of Part II of Don Quixote do not much like the condescension or worse feeling implicit in the elaborate jokes that the Duke and Duchess play on the hero and Sancho. Virtually all of thirty-four chapters (Part II, chapters 30-63) are given over to these jokes; and in the second part of the novel, for that matter, the knight and squire-in the adventure of the Cave of Montesinos and in the famous enchantment of "Dulcinea"-display an alarming willingness to deceive each other. But these episodes do more than amuse seventeenth-century audi- ences, and in a moment I shall argue that there are equivalent episodes in later quixotic novels. To understand them, in truth, I have to appeal to the interpretation of Cervantes by Ortega y Gasset, a contemporary of Bertrand Russell. Ortega wrote the Meditations on Quixote in 1914 not as literary criticism but as the first volume of his philosophy, founded on the belief that "Man reaches his full capacity when he acquires complete consciousness of his circumstances. Through them he communicates with the universe." 14 He was then thirty-one, the same age at which Russell had promised to build a philosophy upon unyielding despair. Essentially Ortega teaches that reality, in its literary representation, has to be rendered aggressive. It cannot "enter into art in any way other than by making an active and combative element out of its own inertia and desolation. It cannot interest us by itself. Much less can its duplication interest us." Quite simply, then, reality needs to be assisted by the sort of push that is given it in demonstra- tive jokes. The hard floor does not interest us of itself, but we have to live with it as we live with all our surroundings. Pulling the chair out from under someone dramatizes the floor, and the fragility of trust, as crudely as the exploding of Clavileno under Sancho and Don Quixote. Mostly Don Quixote and Sancho propel themselves against reality; but Cervantes cannot afford to miss the chance to set reality in motion also, and he does this through human agents and their practical jokes because he does not himself believe in enchanters. The resulting demonstration was important to Ortega, I suggest, because he was born in the late nineteenth century: We see in this materiality its final claim, its critical power before which, providing it is declared sufficient, man's pretension to the ideal, to all that he loves and imagines, yields; the insufficiency, in a word, of culture, of all that is noble, clear, lofty-this is the significance of poetic realism. Cervantes recognizes that culture is all that, but that, alas, it is a fiction. Surrounding culture-as the puppet show of fancy was surrounded by the inn-lies the barbarous, brutal, mute, meaningless reality of things. It is sad that it should 14 Meditations on Quixote, trans. Evelyn Rugg and Diego Marin (New York: Norton, 1961), p. 41. 31</page><page sequence="10">NOVELIFALL 1975 reveal itself to us thus, but what can we do about it! It is real, it is there: it is terribly self-sufficient. Its force and its single meaning are rooted in its sheer presence. Culture is memories and promises, an irreversible past, a dreamed future. But reality is a simple and frightening "being there." It is a presence, a deposit, an inertia. It is materiality.' It is not surprising, therefore, insofar as Cervantes' novel was a demonstration of reality, that it should incorporate a social form of aggression that is not aggrandizing, not acquisitive, but fundamentally gratuitous. It can even be argued, though this is not the occasion, that all novels are themselves a form of practical joke. It was inevitable that Don Quixote and Sancho encounter the Duke and Duchess; for if there were no such thing as a practical joker in the world, he would have to be invented. Quixotic novels in several languages offer partial confirmation of this argu- ment. Just as practical jokes tend to be concentrated in Part II of Don Quixote, where Cervantes is struggling to perfect his representation of reality, so the practical jokes in later novels, though they may be afterthoughts, function as afterthoughts by contributing a "combative element" to the action. Oliver Goldsmith's novel, The Vicar of Wakefield (1766) also breaks into two parts, though it was published as one. The first fifteen chapters paint genre pictures of family life, while the self-revealing narrator displays the mild quixotism that permits the reader to dismiss this idyll even as it attracts; the remaining half of the novel recounts a series of bad jokes played by Providence on the Vicar's family. Sir William Thornhill, like Lorenzo the Magnificent or the Duke and Duchess, still operates in the background, but the providential character of the novel is one way in which it anticipates Victorian culture, for which it became enormously popular. The difference from Don Quixote, and the measure of the future, can be taken by comparing the various come-downs experienced by the knight-errant to the catastrophes of bourgeois life-such as having one's daughter ruined or one's house burned down-experienced by the Vicar. In The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club (1836-37), indebted both to Cervantes and to Goldsmith, the action is again merely episodic and mildly quixotic until the forces of reality gather to a head in the principal joke played upon Mr. Pickwick, which transforms the novel. This time the joke, which begins as nothing more than a funny coincidence misinterpreted by Mrs. Bardell and witnessed by Pickwick's friends, is labeled in the modern way-"a dreadful instance of the force of circumstances!" 16 The action of Madame Bovary (1857), Flaubert's much less entertaining homage to Cervantes, culminates in a searing death scene that has troubled many intelligent readers since the time it was published. And the scene is a bad joke. Like Charles Bovary's attempt to cure the clubfoot of the stableboy, Emma's attempt to solve her difficulties by taking her own life blows apart: the pain and torture of her self-inflicted death catches 15 Ibid., pp. 144-145. 16 The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club (London: Oxford, 1948), ch. 18, p. 245. 32</page><page sequence="11">ALEXANDER WELSH PRACTICAL JOKES 33 her totally by surprise, and Flaubert omits few details of her suffering, which ends in hideous laughter. Was Flaubert a bit carried away? Perhaps so; but he is piling irony upon irony, torturing a character with whom he identifies closely, not to punish her for her sins but out of desperate reaching for more and more realism. Part I of Don Quixote does contain two important practical jokes: the blanket- ing of Sancho and the strappadoing of Don Quixote in the same inn yard on the return journey. Sancho never forgets his blanketing, and whenever Don Quixote mentions the numerous enchantments that appear to have taken place at that inn, Sancho cites the blanketing as something that unmistakably happened.17 As for the incident in which Maritornes and the innkeeper's daughter persuade Don Quixote to stand on Rocinante's back and reach his hand into the window of the loft, then tie his hand fast with the harness of Sancho's mule-once this joke is set in motion, it becomes delicately circumstantial. The narrative anticipates Laurence Sterne: At that moment one of the horsemen's mounts came up to smell Rocinante as the hack, sad and melancholy, with his ears drooping, stood there motion- less, supporting his well-stretched master's weight; and being, when all is said, only flesh and blood though he appeared to be of wood, Rocinante could not but weaken and in turn smell the one that had come to court him. In doing this, he moved ever so little, and at once Don Quixote's feet slipped from the saddle and he would have fallen to the ground if his arm had not been held fast, a circumstance which caused him so much pain that he thought his wrist would be cut off or his arm torn from his body. For he was left hanging so near the ground that he could touch the earth with the tips of his toes, which was all the worse for him since, being conscious of how little he lacked of being able to plant his feet firmly, he wore himself out by stretching himself as far as he could in an attempt to accomplish this.18 Note that the human perpetrators of this joke could not have foreseen how perfectly it would work. Circumstances have refined the joke for them-which is the same thing as to say the narrator has refined the joke. When Grazzini tells the story of Doctor Manente, he betrays at one point that he is aware of a similar conspiracy between personal and impersonal forces-a conspiracy that I am suggesting is very literary. "So you see," he casually remarks, "how luckily everything works together for the success of a practical joke." 19 Boccac- cio, also, in the first of his stories of Calandrino, whose very name came to mean simpleton or dupe, admits at one point that circumstances are favoring the deceivers of this legendary victim.20 Turn this admission around, or study the 17 The blanketing, which occurs in Pt.

There is always a potential alliance between jokers and circumstance. The novelist not only can improve the joke by arranging the circumstances: he introduces the joke in the first place to compel circumstances and humanity to meet. The same principle explains why we can hardly forgive simple demonstrative jokes when they are practiced upon us in real life. As if he were impatient for an accident to occur to us, or as if he were a novelist needing to invent some- thing to happen next, the joker impels circumstance. He intervenes on the side of reality. He is only apparently on the side of reality, because reality is on every side. But our desires and ambitions, our mastery of reality, always dramatize the stuff, just as Don Quixote dramatizes windmills. The joker enters from the opposite side of the stage and trips us up even before we can stumble on the reality strewn everywhere. We resent the joker, in short, because we are so patently beset with contingencies of every kind, because we do not enjoy complete mastery, because we wish the obstacles to desire and ambition out of the way. The demonstrative joke exposes what we have always suspected, our helplessness. So that if it is true, as Lawrence suggests, that men and women today conduct fewer practical jokes than in former days, this decline in the joke- rate is due not only to the increased sensitivity to pain since the late eighteenth century but to the increased sense of contingency in the modern world. To those who are already convinced victims of circumstance, practical jokes are in bad taste. And one of the inheritances of the Enlightenment, and of the rise of modern history and science, is the conviction that we are victims of circumstance. Sterne deserves credit for the discovery of this predicament and the insight that novelists could allow the circumstances to play the jokes. In Tristram Shandy he was able to transform the quixotic novel in such a way that con- tingency became its main subject. Accidents that befall the hero do result from the quixotries of his father and uncle. The catastrophes of "geniture, nose, and name" correspond to Walter Shandy's anxious theories of the same; and the window fell, when Susannah held Tristram up to ****, because the sash weights had been removed for my uncle Toby's cannon. Unlike Don Quixote's errantry, however, Shandean theories and hobby-horses have become formal and remote causes. The proximate causes are links of contingency so fine that they cannot be narrated without a regression in time. Don Quixote's sallies are voluntary, his role as a victim of practical jokes is the counterpart of his idealism; whereas Tristram is a sort of son and nephew of Don Quixote whose uniqueness results from his involuntary existence. "Thousands suffer by choice," as he disarmingly puts it, "what I did by accident." Or, with more grandiose self-pity, "Sport of small accidents, Tristram Shandy! that thou art, and ever will be!" 21 Nearly every page of the novel magnifies this sense of contingency. Sterne keeps his knights-errant at home, permits them little exercise but talk, 21 Tristram Shandy, ed. Ian Watt (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1965), Vol. V, ch. 17, p. 284; Vol. III, ch. 8, pp. 124-125. 34</page><page sequence="13">ALEXANDER WELSHIPRACTICAL JOKES and concentrates on the receiving end of the jokes played by circumstance. The jeopardy to his hero from mere existence-from before existence-at first seems only funny, and readers under the age of thirty-one find the race against death in Volume VII one of the duller digressions. Gradually it becomes apparent that the theme of death in Sterne's novel summarizes every other contingency including birth. IV In The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club, and more mysteriously in his later novels, Dickens reinterpreted these forms of jeopardy for the nineteenth century. With something like the exaggeration of Tristram Shandy his hero exclaims, "We are all the victims of circumstances, and I the greatest." 22 Deeply impressed by Cervantes and by Goldsmith, Dickens readied this protest at the same age Mill had been five years before when he incautiously entrusted the future to "the force of circumstances." Dickens swiftly realized that mere contingency, the Sterne-like combination of circumstances that results in the discovery of Mrs. Bardell in Mr. Pickwick's arms, could become further entangled in the hapless life of human institutions. Mr. Pickwick is sued for breach of promise, and his lawful trial is the means by which more and more circumstances inform against him. Circumstances weigh upon the law, and the law ominously inflates circumstance. Culture and materiality become strangely mixed, to use Ortega's terms, and the individual is left high and dry as individual. For Mr. Pickwick will soon find himself alone: though he is joined in the Fleet prison by Sam Weller, the latter contends with culture and materiality on different grounds. Here is Serjeant Buzfuz for the plaintiff and the force of circumstances in the trial of Bardell vs. Pickwick: I shall show you, gentlemen, that for two years Pickwick continued to reside constantly, and without interruption or intermission, at Mrs. Bardell's house. I shall show you that Mrs. Bardell, during the whole of that time waited on him, attended to his comforts, cooked his meals, looked out his linen for the washerwoman when it went abroad, darned, aired, and prepared it for wear, when it came home, and, in short, enjoyed his fullest trust and confidence. I shall show you that, on many occasions, he gave halfpence, and on some occasions even sixpences, to her little boy; and I shall prove to you, by a witness whose testimony it will be impossible for my learned friend to weaken or controvert, that on one occasion he patted the boy on the head, and, after inquiring whether he had won any ally tors or commoneys lately (both of which I understand to be a particular species of marbles much prized by the youth of this town), made use of this remarkable expression: "How should you like to have another father?" I shall prove to you, gentlemen, that about 22 Pickwick, ch. 18, p. 245. 35</page><page sequence="14">NOVELIFALL 1975 a year ago Pickwick suddenly began to absent himself from home, during long intervals, as if with the intention of gradually breaking off from my client; but I shall show you also that this resolution was not at that time sufficiently strong, or that his better feelings conquered, if better feelings he has, or that the charms and accomplishments of my client prevailed against his unmanly intentions; by proving to you, that on one occasion, when he returned from the country, he distinctly and in terms, offered her marriage: previously however, taking special care that there should be no witness to their solemn contract; and I am in a situation to prove to you, on the testimony of three of his own friends,-most unwilling witnesses, gentlemen-most unwilling witnesses- that on that morning he was discovered by them holding the plaintiff in his arms, and soothing her agitation by his caresses and endearments.23 The accusations are all factual; even the central charge, though false, is based upon what are commonly called-in a phrase that shifts the burden of prosecution to the facts-"suspicious circumstances." Serjeant Buzfuz proceeds immediately to the written evidence against Mr. Pickwick, including the notorious letter written in his own hand that states in its entirety, "Chops and tomata sauce." It is one of the funniest lines, and one of the direst lines, in English literature. Ridiculous as it may be that a hero should be convicted on the evidence that he had once ordered his dinner, the jeopardy is something we all share. I do not refer merely to the fact that Dickens based this satire on evidence admitted to the Norton-Melbourne trial,24 but to the case in which each of us stands in respect to circumstances. Every day we leave behind a long trail of evidence- scraps of paper, chance encounters, careless speech-that is equally incriminat- ing. To the jeopardy that Sterne discovered in small events and smaller gestures, Dickens added-or rather, he represented-the double jeopardy of law and circumstance. The supposed contract broken by Mr. Pickwick was one small corner of the law of contract, which at bottom remained the nineteenth-century theory, if not the foundation in fact, of civilization. Mr. Pickwick found himself squeezed between a handful of facts and the social contract; and his heroism was to stand up to society, as Tristram Shandy stood up to death, and Don Quixote to doubt. It is always the response to circumstances that finally interests the realist- because the realist is a human being, like Mr. Pickwick himself. Think of the shifting complexity of the idea of circumstances in a great novel like Middle- march (1871-72), with its concern for social organization and the circumstances at work within character itself. Tertius Lydgate, to summarize only one case, fails in the struggle against chance, against provincial mores, against "the circumstance called Rosamond"-a phrase invoked to describe her power over her own father-and against his own character. Yet George Eliot, in defiance of nearly all the evidence she provides, presses the moral: "It always remains true 23 Ibid., ch. 34, pp. 472-473. 24 Cf. John Butt and Kathleen Tillotson, Dickens at Work (London: Methuen, 1957), p. 71, n. 1. 36</page><page sequence="15">ALEXANDER WELSH PRACTICAL JOKES that if we had been greater, circumstance would have been less strong against us." 25 Circumstance would have been less strong against us? George Eliot is writing here of the response of as well as to circumstance. Her sentence opens as if she were introducing a tautology-"It always remains true that"; but then she would be saying merely, "If we had been stronger we would have been stronger." George Eliot does not intend a tautology. Rather, she phrases her conclusion so that circumstance apparently responds to human beings-as if circumstance would let up, entertain second thoughts, pick on someone less great. Because she is moralizing the affair, she allows her language to slide away from the impersonal, objective relation of circumstances to the victim of circum- stances that I have associated with demonstrative jokes. The language veers instead toward an experimental relation, a sort of give-and-take, in which circumstance merely tests us. In her syntax "circumstance" is suddenly sub- jective. The force of circumstance stops short of being an intelligent force only because "less strong against us" is sufficiently ambiguous, active or passive, that a tautology can be rushed in to make useless logic out of the wish that circumstances are only experimenting with us. To comprehend the ethics of realism one has to take into account this hint of intelligence, or what I prefer to call the attribution of law, of concerted power in circumstances. I include the kind of attribution of fate that even Flaubert permits himself in making Emma Bovary conscious, on her death bed, of the return of the blind man. One also has to take into account that realism is beyond good and evil-for even very ordinary realists contend that literature should depict what is true and not necessarily what is good. The idea of the cosmic joke subtends both these considerations, the lawlike power and the suspension of the ethical, and to it one must return for a definition of the heroic response to circumstances. S0ren Kierkegaard, a contemporary of Dickens, described faith as the response to a certain Old Testament version of the cosmic joke. In a book called Fear and Trembling (1843), published about six years after Pickwick, he told and retold the story of Abraham and Isaac until he was sure he knew what it meant, though he confessed he could never understand it. In a sense the intensity of Kierke- gaard's book comes from the effort to show that the story of the sacrifice of Isaac, as given in Genesis 22, was not a bad joke. The account in the Bible tells us nothing whatever of the divine intention, except that it was some kind of experiment-"God did tempt Abraham." We know still less of Abraham's thoughts. Among the many possibilities that Kierkegaard rejects-some defi- nitely heroic-is that Abraham resigned himself to the loss of Isaac. "By faith Abraham did not renounce his claim upon Isaac, but by faith he got Isaac." 26 Essentially, according to Kierkegaard, Abraham obeyed God but still believed that Isaac would be saved. 25 Middlemarch, ed. Gordon S. Haight (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1956), Bk. IV, ch. 36, p. 252; Bk. VI, ch. 58, p. 428. 26 Fear and Trembling, trans. Walter Lowrie (New York: Anchor Books, 1954), p. 59. 37</page><page sequence="16">NOVELIFALL 1975 I find Abraham's faith logically equivalent to a daring strategy based on a true surmise, "It must be a joke"; or to a decision that can be expressed, "I'll go along with this because He doesn't mean it." As a proposition it is comparable to Mill's un-Pickwickian exhortation, "Let us place our trust for the future . . . [in] the force of circumstances"-because circumstances are not going to be all that bad. But let us try to understand what is Pickwickian about Abraham's response. Kierkegaard contrasts Abraham with tragic heroes who face merely ethical decisions: Agamemnon and Jephthah, who sacrificed their daughters; Brutus, who delivered up his sons. The tragic heroes overcome their personal loves for public causes. Abraham is called upon to overcome the ethical, to overcome the principle that it is wrong to slay one's child. By accepting the command he becomes, in Kierkegaard's language, an individual who is higher than the universal. "The tragic hero renounces himself in order to express the universal, the knight of faith renounces the universal in order to become the individual." 27 Therefore there is such a thing as "the teleological suspension of the ethical," both in certain situations that individuals must face and in the response to these situations. Even ordinary practical jokes sometimes beg to be excused on this principle; and in extraordinary situations the victim of a joke should reply on the same ground. When Mr. Pickwick, defending against a "plaintiff having all the advantages derivable, not only from the force of circumstances, but from the sharp practice of Dodson and Fogg to boot," refuses to pay the damages and costs lawfully assessed against him, he is engaged in the teleological suspension of the ethical. "You may try, and try, and try again . .. but not one farthing of costs or damages do you ever get from me, if I spend the rest of my existence in a debtor's prison." 28 His end is justice, but in order to achieve justice Mr. Pickwick has to defy his friends and his own lawyer as well as Dodson and Fogg. Above all, he must repudiate the judgment brought against him by the civil court of his own law-abiding society. Mr. Pickwick consequently becomes an individual, higher than the universal. Dickens does not leave his hero out on this limb-the damages and costs are eventually paid. But for a time Mr. Pickwick is in a revolutionary position, a position similar to that which is known today as passive resistance or civil disobedience. He must desert one set of ethical assumptions for another. The position that I would characterize as revolutionary, Kierkegaard explains some- what differently. For Kierkegaard, beyond the ethical lies the absolute. The knight of faith is superior in that he stands "in an absolute relation to the ab- solute . . . or else there never has been faith." I shall seem crass if I say what I think he means by an absolute relation to the absolute in the context of the present discussion. He means that by faith Abraham has secured a permanent membership in a better club-that he has been elected, so to speak. The joke about sacrificing his son has been used to test his belonging to that club. Kierkegaard employs language nearly this crass when he writes, in a churchly tone, that those who grasp the significance of the story of Abraham and Isaac 27 Ibid., p. 86. 28 Pickwick, ch. 26, p. 363; ch. 34, p. 478. 38</page><page sequence="17">ALEXANDER WELSHIPRACTICAL JOKES have at least "a presentiment of the marvelous glory this knight attains in the fact that he becomes God's intimate acquaintance, the Lord's friend, and (to speak quite humanly) that he says 'Thou' to God in heaven, whereas even the tragic hero only addresses Him in the third person." .2' The far less formidable Pickwick is a more attractive hero than Abraham: for merely ethical reasons and because he is merely ridiculous in the first place, but also because he fights back when conventional ethics fail him and because there is no superior club prepared to receive him. He is already, one might point out, President of the Pickwick Club. The comparison is both anachronistic and unfair to Abraham, however, who was also leader of his people. Abraham has to assume that the joke proposed for him is experimental, that his response will be watched closely. Mr. Pickwick faces a demonstrative joke of the force of circumstances: his response cannot possibly affect his relation to circumstances, only his sense of his own identity. Much that Kierkegaard says about Abraham applies, nevertheless, to Pick- wick. The "knight of faith" is also in the quixotic tradition. "Humanly speaking, he is crazy and cannot make himself intelligible to anyone." This is especially true if one thinks of Pickwick in the Fleet prison after he has defied the law, after he has bewildered his friends, and after he has turned in despair from the suffering he has witnessed. It is easy to conclude that because Pickwick has the means to free himself at any time, his plight is less serious than that of his fellow prisoners; but in Kierkegaard's terms this is not so. Unlike the tragic hero whose action is complete, the knight of faith can always turn back on his decision. "The tragic hero is soon ready and has soon finished the fight, he makes the infinite movement and then is secure in the universal. The knight of faith, on the other hand, is kept sleepless, for he is constantly tried, and every instant there is the possibility of being able to return repentantly to the uni- versal. . ." 30 Inwardly Mr. Pickwick's struggle is more painful than the life of prisoners who cannot improve their situation but are, in many if not in all cases, sustained by hope. Only without hope, only in unyielding despair, later writers would argue, can the victim of circumstances survive. Dickens perhaps more truthfully showed Mr. Pickwick begin to sicken and die. He is saved, as existentialist theories and revolutions are saved, by inconsistency and a return of the ethical. Mr. Pickwick's friends are able to make him forget his sleepless vigil of defiance by reopening opportunities of service to others. We owe to Kierkegaard's analysis of the cosmic joke the perception that victims of circumstance have a stature different from but no less interesting than that of tragic heroes. Few protagonists of novels achieve the transcendence that Pickwick achieves. Dickens himself never dared create another legendary individual of this order. But readers of realistic novels, like witnesses of practical jokes, must brace themselves for a teleological suspension of the ethical whenever they sympathize with victims of circumstance, even those as passive as Enoch Arden. Literary realism is apparently a teleological suspension of the ethical without a teleology. I suspect that its telos is justice-but that is another story. 29 Fear and Trembling, pp. 66, 88. 30 Ibid., pp. 86, 88. 39</page></plain_text>
