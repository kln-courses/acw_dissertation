<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ecological Concern and the Anti-Foundationalist Debates: James Gustafson on Biospheric Constraints William C. French James M. Gustafson's recent two-volume work Ethics from a Theocentric Perspective, surely stands as one of the strongest and most systematic attempts in recent decades to articulate a naturalistic basis for theology and ethics.1 His project has proved controversial and a key criticism leveled against it is that it wrongly seeks to transcend the embeddedness of thought and experience in culture and history. This charge is often made against ecologically-oriented theologians and ethicists, and it arises, I believe, from an entrenched belief that a turn to nature and creation entails a turn away from culture and history. Those who focus upon nature are thus often suspected of attempting a flat footed retrieval of the natural law agenda of elaborating culturally invariant ethical principles. Gustafson's claim that the "subject matter of ethics" has "objective referents" in the "objective ordering of all life" (2:8) flies in the face of prominent movements in contemporary theology and philosophy which deny the existence of any truly "objective" order at all. I will examine anti-foundationalist arguments that stress that because reality is culturally and socially "constructed,"2 truth-claims are culturally relative. These linked claims about the cultural construction of reality and the cultural relativity of truth highlight well the inadequacies of positivist accounts of an extracultural objective order whose contours may be empirically known. Richard Bernstein recently has helpfully described this debate as one between "relativist" and "objectivist" positions.3 It is not surprising that much attention is being devoted to issues of cultural and ethical relativity for their implications are massive. However, I believe that the "constructivist" claim that we fabricate reality culturally and linguistically, found so often allied to the relativist view, deserves much more critical scrutiny than it ordinarily gets. Certainly, the term "reality construction," when used to refer specifically to cultural</page><page sequence="2">114 The Annual of the Society of Christian Ethics traditions, artifacts, beliefs, and institutions, is not problematic. However, too often such modest constructivist claims are stridently exaggerated to imply that there is no reality beyond what we and others fabricate via our language and culture. Nelson Goodman, we will see, employs expressions which suggest this "radical constructivist" position.4 Unfortunately modest constructivists in their polemic against crude objectivist views frequently fail to distance themselves explicitly from radical constructivist claims. In this way their terms of expression often support overblown accounts of human freedom, creativity, and historical agency. These in turn validate the ethic of world-making and world-transformation which lies at the core of the technocratic agenda of modern industrial societies. I am troubled by the extent to which influential movements in theology and ethics today appeal to constructivist projects in epistemology, the philosophy of science, and the sociology of knowledge for support in framing anthropo logical accounts depicting the human as homo faber, as maker not just of artifacts but of culture, history, and thus "the world" or better "worlds." The goal of the progressive domination of nature thus draws support and moral authority from this interlocking web of epistemological and anthropological beliefs. The ecological perspective informing the work of Gustafson and others is so interesting and important because it challenges both radical constructivist and strong relativist claims. Against those who stress the "social construction of reality," Gustafson emphasizes that we must attend to, and respond to, given "objective orderings" both in nature and society. There is room for creative invention, but our fabrications must conform to constraints imposed by the embodied orderings of life in the world. That Gustafson attacks anthropocentric ethics and theology is well known. I will try to show that his critique also challenges the anthropo centrism which is prominant in many influential accounts of the power of language, texts, stories, and narratives to shape worlds and com munities.5 These do, of course, have a massive impact on the shape of our experience—but so does our genetic heritage and so do the "or derings" of the biosphere. Similarly, Gustafson's focus upon increasing biospheric damage draws attention to a set of global concerns and constraints, common to all cultures, which raise doubts about the adequacy of radical constructivist claims about the cultural relativity of all human experience. The ecological perspective attends to a totality or frame of reference which encompasses all of earth's cultures and thus highlights not so much cultural differences as our common participation in the global ecosystem. In what follows, I will, first, examine the main contours of Gustaf son's project and some of the main lines of criticism. Second, I will attempt to show that critical, ecologically-oriented theologians like</page><page sequence="3">Ecological Concern 115 Gustafson do not fail to take history seriously. On the contrary, their projects may best be understood as responses to intertwined historical developments: the conceptual objectification of nature; the modern historical revolutions in raw industrial, technological, and military power; and the consequent accelerating potential for destructive abuse of the biosphere. Third, I will examine the implications an ecological perspec tive holds for the anti-foundationalist debates. In a critique of radical constructivist and relativist claims in epistemology, ethics, and theology, I will argue that talk of "many worlds" each shaped by different texts, disciplines, or cultures is misleading and is ecologically and ethically unsound. There is one world, not many. Its ordering is fundamentally given and not subject to the free play of our constructions. Its name is Earth and it is a world not well lost. Gustafson on the Constraints to our Freedom and Agency Gustafson's project is mobilized along three fronts. He criticizes: (1) anthropomorphic construals of God; (2) denaturalized accounts of the human person, culture, and history; and (3) the restriction of value to human life in traditional anthropocentric ethics. Gustafson insists that God is sovereign, and thus God, not the human, is the center of value. The affirmation that God is creator and sustainer requires a vision of the horizon of value that is as broad as the sphere of creation. The human, according to Gustafson, must be viewed as a participant in the natural world fully as much as in history and culture. God, Gustafson argues, must be understood as "ordering," "sustaining," and "judging" us through the workings of nature as much as through the workings of human society and history (1:309). The human, Gustafson says, is properly the "measurer of all things," but distinctly not the measure of the value and meaning of all that is (1:82). Humanity experiences "powers bearing down" and supportive forces "bearing up"; we experience "orderings" in society and nature "requiring" and "enabling" us to act in conformity to those orderings. Humanity interacts with nonhuman nature and remains dependent upon it, even as we transform it to our use. But the world has structure and order that sets limits and restraints upon human action and patterns of life. As Gustafson puts it: "In the religious consciousness the patterns and processes of interdependence of life in the world (and not merely in nature) are signs or indications of the divine power and ordering" (2:145-46). The "human fault," according to Gustafson, consists in: (1) idolatry, (2) "wrongly ordered love," (3) the "corruption of rationality," and (4) disobedience (1:294). He borrows Johnathan Edwards's metaphor of</page><page sequence="4">116 The Annual of the Society of Christian Ethics the "contraction" of the "human spirit" to capture both the vertical and horizontal dimensions of fault. In the vertical relationship of persons with God, egoism fuels anthropocentrism which seeks to domesticate God into our own image. Such a picture of God, drawn from categories of human agency and personality, supports human confidence, pride, and desire for comfort. God comes to be seen as the guarantor of human well-being, happiness, and salvation and as the power who created the cosmos for the sake of human life. We contract our understanding of God to suit our purposes. In this way "God becomes an instrument in the service of human beings rather than human beings instruments in the service of God" (1:25). In our horizontal relations, we contract our attention to the human sphere and fail to acknowledge value and dignity beyond it. Indeed often we contract our notions of value and worth to exclude other humans— those beyond our national community, those not of our race, our gender, our religion. In instrumentalizing God we gain pseudo-theological warrants for the instrumentalization of all of the rest of creation. In thinking creation ours and in reveling in our superiority to, and separation from, nature, we overemphasize the range of human freedom and agency. "The corruption of rationality," Gustafson believes, entails a "contraction of our loyalties," vision, imagination, and "moral interests" (1:305-6). The anthropocentric contraction pushes us to construe human Ufe in radical distinction from the rest of the created world. In this fashion the constraints on our freedom, our embeddedness in nature, the dignity of nature (both in its Uving species and inanimate structures), and our close evolutionary connection to nonrational life are played down. The affections, in Gustafson's view, both prompt and channel moral attention and response. "[T]he affection of piety: a sense of dependence on, and respect and gratitude for, what is given" is the "primary moment in a religious view of the world" (1:61). Gustafson stresses that "religion is grounded in experiences of 'others': of nature, of human communities, of human creativity and action" (1:134-35). The ranges of human creativity and action are limited, however, for they are played out in response often to actions and patterns of forces not of our making (1:128). Where Gustafson takes away certain theological doctrines because they are in "sharp incongruity" with our best available scientific knowl edge (1:251-52), he gives us the modern sciences now construed as theological disciplines. Against the "two-worlds" division of labor that has given theology and the sciences different spheres (but at the cost of narrowing the scope of theological attention and vision), Gustafson stresses that there is one world and that our knowledge of it when interpreted "in piety" offers "signs of the power and presence of God"</page><page sequence="5">Ecological Concern 117 (1:251). One does not pursue scientific inquiry and then cut piety to fit; rather, from a construal "in piety" of the world, one sees science as a theological discipline for interpreting "God's ordering of the world."7 A distinctive feature of Gustafson's ethics is his attention to humanity's participation in and responsibility for the rest of creation. The "substance" or "content" of morality, he states, "must be derived from our most adequate perception and conception of the relations that are appropriate for ourselves and for other things to the ultimate power and orderer of life" (2:2). We are enabled and required, he insists with a litany-like phrase, "to relate to all things in a manner appropriate to their relations to God" (1:158). Theocentric ethics requires a biospheric expansion of our moral attention and notions of value. Gustafson suggests that "God's purposes are for the well-being of the whole of 'the creation'"; thus, we can no longer take humanity as the "measure of the value of all things" (1:99). He affirms that the "good that God values must be more inclusive" than "what is good for the human species" (1:96). The good of the whole takes precedence over the good of a part, and this implies that the good of the common biosphere takes precedence over some of the interests of humanity (1:99), even as the good of future generations takes precedence over some of the interests of this generation. Theocentric ethics, while stressing God as the ultimate source and center of value, can still at the normative level be relatively human centered regarding the priority of human value over that of a wolf or chimp. Yet at the same time it affirms that wolves and chimps, especially as a species, have value, too; recognition of this fact establishes certain stewardship responsibilities in humans to protect these species and to restrict activities that harm them. "[A]ll things," according to Gustafson, "are 'good,' and not just good for us" (1:109). However, a biospheric expansion of ethics need not be interpreted to compete with the affir mation of the importance of human well-being. One of Gustafson's main points is that because humanity is a part of the broader natural world our well-being is dependent upon its well-being, and in turn its well-being now depends upon our careful stewardship and restraint. Ecologically enlightened human self-interest clearly can generate strong reasons to protect the biosphere, but any such reasoning remains thoroughly anthropocentric: we protect nature because it serves our interests. This view has been dubbed "shallow ecology."8 In contrast, Gustafson insists that there is distinctive value in nonhuman nature that sets up in us obligations of respect both for its sake and for our sake, but also in order to give God glory. Gustafson is a theocentric "deep ecologist"; though he does not deny the "special dignity" of human life (1:101), he affirms that the "well-being of the whole" of creation must be</page><page sequence="6">118 The Annual of the Society of Christian Ethics taken directly into account in our moral reflection (2:16). According to Gustafson: it cannot be argued that all things were created for the sake of man. The need for food for the human species is not the sole end to be realized in human interventions into nature; attention must be given to the conditions of possibility not only for the continuity of human life but also for other forms of life to be sustained and developed. .. . [We must be] sensitive to the natural needs for the sustenance of the rest of nature both because of human dependence on it and for the sake of nature's own flourishing [2:243]. When we fail to consent to ecological constraints and consequently cause biospheric harm, we confront in the unfolding consequences "the judgment and wrath of God" (1:246). Having violated the "divine ordering," we meet God's judgment and wrath in smog, in Chernobyl, in drug addiction, in species extinction, and in the "greenhouse" conse quences of excessive use of fossil fuels and the burning and clearing of the jungle forests. Many are put off by Gustafson's refusal to use categories of personality to speak of God; they find his theological vision to be austere and depressing. While some think Gustafson's model of God cuts out divine graciousness, I believe that in Gustafson's account God remains a vastly gracious deity, though the tone and modality of that graciousness is changed. Gustafson does cut out notions of God modeled on human personality; he does argue that God's care is not exclusively concerned for humanity. In return, however, Gustafson's concept of God broadens and deepens the range of divine care. In the concrete fabric of life, we are everywhere both judged and "borne up." In the immediacy of our daily experience we encounter massively the presence of God in the sun's warmth, in the flight of ducks, in the structures and requirements of human bodies, in minds, in love, in food, in AIDS, in war. Taking History Seriously in an Ecologically Endangered Age Many reviews and articles, especially those appearing in the initial wave of response, praise Gustafson's courage, honesty, and erudition, but go on to voice strong criticisms of his approach.9 While many briefly commend Gustafson for confronting ecological issues, few focus in any sustained way on the significance of his radical and thoroughgoing location of humanity within the natural world. This illustrates, I believe, the continuing impact of the modern theological turn away from creation</page><page sequence="7">Ecological Concern 119 to focus upon Christology, eschatology, and history. Ecological issues, while acknowledged to be practically important, are typically relegated to the sphere of applied ethics and are viewed as having no bearing on the central methodological debates in theology and ethics regarding cultural and ethical relativity, historicity, hermeneutics (especially the roles of narrative and metaphor), and epistemology. This entrenched pattern of concern and attention causes many readers to ignore some of Gustafson's most important points and to misread others. The criticism of Gustafson's project focuses on three main issues. First, many have charged Gustafson with an inadequate doctrine of God because of his rejection of person and agent language. They find his Christology too thin and deeply unsatisfactory. Gilbert Meilaender and others suggest that Gustafson shares much with the Stoics.10 Richard McCormick argues that Gustafson's account of "God" is a "gloomy" one—not the "God of Christian belief," but the remote God of "an impersonal deism."11 Second, many reject his use of modern science as a general test for the adequacy of theological doctrines. They are especially distressed that this methodology entails dismissal of the notion of an afterlife. They fear that Gustafson corrupts theology by importing the evidences of an extrinsic discipline in such a decisive way that they become the standard for theological adequacy.12 Third, critics complain that Gustafson's turn to nature entails a failure to take the historicity of experience seriously. For example, in a generally deeply appreciative review, Stanley Hauerwas suggests that while Gustafson rightly emphasizes that human experience and thought is history- and culture-laden, he still is "struggling to find an epistemological high point that can insure our ability to stand back from our histories as well as to provide the basis for our necessary pursuit of universality."13 In a later essay, Hauerwas acknowledges Gustafson's stress on historicity but nonetheless criticizes him for pushing beyond particularity in an attempt to make universalist claims about human nature and the world. On Hauerwas's reading, Gustafson's selections from the Reformed tradition perhaps "betray a lingering desire, if not presumption, that some ahistorical standpoint is valid or at least must be attempted."14 In criticizing Gustafson on the grounds that he has taken flight from history, Hauerwas exemplifies the common and even predictable critical response provoked by contemporary creation-oriented theologies. The prevalence of this complaint makes clear the degree to which our thinking continues to be influenced by old habits of setting history and nature in conceptual opposition. History is the arena of freedom, and nature, the realm of necessity. Quite commonly in existentialist and eschatological schools of theology the category of nature has been denigrated in order</page><page sequence="8">120 The Annual of the Society of Christian Ethics to build up history as the locus both of human agency and of divine disclosure and activity.15 However, it is precisely my point that concern for the orderings of nature found today in the work of Gustafson and others arises not because these theologians are in flight from history but rather because they attend with great seriousness to the implications of the forces being unleashed by modern history. Biospheric concern must be understood in light of modern scientific, technological, and ecological history. We might, in turn, accuse these critics of a "flight from creation," a theological indifference to nature that represents a response to the rise of the mechanistic picture of nature.16 Where once the Aristotelian picture of nature stressed intrinsic purpose and living process and where other influential western traditions employed the metaphor of a "nur turing mother" to describe nature, Francis Bacon, Isaac Newton, and other leaders of the scientific revolution in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries inspired a new understanding of nature as an intricate ma chine.17 This view legitimated the manipulation and use of nature as a field of objects and resources even as it suggested to theologians that there was little loss in ceding over the natural world to the disciplinary purview of science. With purpose and personality seemingly evacuated from the natural world, the definitively human sphere, as well as the sphere of divine action and disclosure, came to be viewed as restricted to the realm of culture and history where personality and rationality remained free from mechanistic causal necessity. With the universe apparently bifurcated between humanity and nature, there appeared to be no genuine competition between theology and science so long as each kept to its respective sphere. The scope of theology narrowed as questions of our relation to the rest of creation were bracketed off. While the early maturity of Newtonian physics lent authority to the mechanistic account of nature, the impact of Darwin's theory of evolution, Einstein's theory of relativity, and the recent rise of the model of nature as a living ecosystem have overthrown the mechanistic world-picture. The picture of nature that emerges in modern physics, biology, and ecology is a world of life—a world of events, process, development, and energy—not an inert world reducible to mechanics.18 Despite these changes in science, the "thingified" picture of nature still holds sway in the popular culture of industrialized societies. Tech nological practices constrict our modes of interaction with, and construals of, nature. As Martin Heidegger notes, technology by "enframing" and "entrapping" nature sustains the view that nature is a field of passive objects and things available for transformation into commodities for human consumption and use.19 Similarly increased urbanization means that the dominant experience of more people is the experience of a</page><page sequence="9">Ecological Concern 121 constructed environment, insulated from sustained, close interaction with nature and animals (other than pets). Likewise, in ethics the legacy of Kant has continued to authorize a view of the moral universe as divided between the sphere of rational beings who as "persons" have intrinsic value as "ends-in-themselves" and the sphere of "natural" (non-rational) beings who are properly mere "things" having only instrumental worth by virtue of their usefulness to persons.20 Kant admits in his Lectures on Ethics that we must not be cruel to animals. However, he holds that this is really an indirect duty derived from direct duties owed to ourselves (that we not become corrupted through habits of cruelty) or owed to other humans (whom we might victimize if we were to become callous). As he puts it: "Animals are not self-conscious and are there merely as a means to an end. That end is man. . . . Our duties towards animals are merely indirect duties towards humanity."21 John Rawls's analysis in A Theory of Justice illustrates the con tinuing marginalization of questions of the moral status of animal life and the rest of nonhuman nature in dominant schools of ethical theory. While denying that we owe such beings and entities "strict justice," he holds that we nonetheless have "duties of compassion and humanity" which require us not to be cruel to animals and not to destroy whole species. He continues: I shall not attempt to explain these considered beliefs. They are outside the scope of the theory of justice, and it does not seem possible to extend the contract doctrine so as to include them in a natural way. A correct conception of our relations to animals and to nature would seem to depend upon a theory of the natural order and our place in it. . . . How far justice as fairness will have to be revised to fit into this larger theory it is impossible to say.22 By construing justice in terms of obligations obtaining between full moral agents who are able to enter freely into a social or an economic contract, modern ethical theory has foreclosed questions about possible duties owed to non-rational non-agents like animals and other entities of the natural world.23 Existentialist thought, Hans Jonas argues rightly, has arisen in part in reaction to the mechanistic world-picture sustained in modern indus trialized culture. Like gnosticism before it, existentialism emphasizes the experience of "homelessness," of "being thrown" into an alien, "de nuded," and often hostile universe. "No philosophy has ever been less concerned about nature than Existentialism, for which it has no dignity</page><page sequence="10">122 The Annual of the Society of Christian Ethics left."24 According to Jonas, the existentialist critique of metaphysics hides its own metaphysical position, namely a metaphysical dualism between the human sphere and the sphere of nature which is viewed as emptied of value, purpose, or ends. In such a world "the self is thrown back entirely upon itself in quest for meaning and value. Meaning is no longer found but is 'conferred.' Values are no longer beheld in the vision of objective reality, but are posited as feats of valuation."25 Clearly existentialist thought has helped encourage modern theology to focus upon divine and human agency in history. Christocentric, eschatological, historicist, and personalist concentrations have marked dominant movements in modern Protestant and Catholic theology alike. Consequently the doctrine of creation, with its stress on God's action in nature and on humanity's rootedness in nature, has been too often relegated to the shadows.26 While twentieth-century theology has bent little attention on nature and creation, this century has witnessed an unprecedented acceleration of scientific and technological power as well as, especially after World War II, accelerating environmental damage resulting from the displacement of relatively benign modes of production by ecologically destructive ones. The dynamism of our technological advance is seen nowhere more clearly than in the acceleration of the power of our weaponry. Today our nuclear arsenals contain roughly eighteen thousand megatons, six thousand times the firepower that was expended in all of World War II.27 Statistics concerning other sorts of environmental threats—rates of species extinction, ozone breakdown, rain forest destruction—are both tedious to examine and frightening to acknowledge. The slowness of the religious and theological communities to respond to the implications of these trends arises, at least in part, from entrenched concerns and patterns of thought that channel attention away from God's ordering of, and our responsibility for, nature. Whose Ozone Layer? Which History? Hauerwas does correctly diagnose in Gustafson's project something of a push for "universality." However, this results not from an attempt to "stand back from our histories" but rather from Gustafson's recog nition that modern history has unleashed forces which increasingly threaten the biosphere. Though many ecological problems are local, some certainly are global—like the greenhouse effect and ozone depletion. Similarly, even local cases of ecological damage, when added up, may have a global impact as well. Alasdair Maclntyre's recent book Whose Justice? Which Rational ity? sharply reminds us that theories of justice and practical rationality are "tradition-constituted."28 His title nicely stresses that there are diverse</page><page sequence="11">Ecological Concern 123 accounts of justice and rationality given in different cultures and tradi tions. Thus there is no way to step out of culture and history to grasp some final Truth or some foundational principle of the Good. My question "Whose ozone layer?" is meant to highlight the global character of at least some biospheric structures and processes which have made possible certain avenues of evolution and have set strict constraints upon others. In Gustafson's terms, such structures have been both "enabling" and "requiring." Our species, like other species, has adapted, by the long process of natural selection, its forms of life and its physio logical structures to accord with the opportunities and checks presented by environmental niches or habitats. While many species have niches that are relatively narrow, humans have proved to be immensely successful at adapting to a broad variety of regional ecosystems. Whereas there are indeed multiple theories of justice, there is one ozone layer, global in scope. Different cultures may indeed construe and experience the ozone layer differently. Some may not be aware of its existence at all. Still the fact that the human race evolved enjoying the protection that the ozone layer affords against the sun's ultraviolet radiation means that ozone depletion will increase rates of skin cancer. This impact will be transcultural though of course different skin colors, clothing styles, and life patterns will affect such rates. My question "Which history?" is meant as a reminder that Gustaf son and other critical, creation-centered theologians and ethicists do not fail to take history seriously. They differ with other theologians and philosophers only about which ranges of history must be taken most seriously. Ecological Foundations and Anti-Foundationalism: Global Problems and the Limits of Cultural Relativity Anti-foundationalists rightly stress the particularities of human experience and rightly call attention to the shaping of thought by narratives, institutions, traditions, and languages. Consequently they emphasize the cultural relativity of truth-assertions. Without minimizing the embeddedness of experience in history and tradition, creation centered theologies draw attention to cultural commonalities by attending to global biospheric problems. All peoples draw breath from the same atmospheric system, and we, the Nuer, and the Ik all depend ultimately upon the integrity of the common biosphere. Issues of cultural relativity primarily arise when the totality under consideration is the sphere of human community. Comparisons between and among communities not surprisingly highlight differences. When the frame of reference is expanded to the human species, common, basic requirements for health</page><page sequence="12">124 The Annual of the Society of Christian Ethics and survival are highlighted. Cultural differences are not dismissed; rather, they are located within a broader attention to a set of species characteristics. In expanding the frame of reference further to the biosphere as a whole (as Gustafson and ecologists hold is necessary), our attention picks out certain problems that impact, now or in the future, all cultures and life-forms together as members of a common "earth community."29 Ecology, by attending to the planetary ecosystem, confronts natural structures and forces that are global and transcultural. From this vantage-point human cultures can be seen merging toward a global culture whose impact on the planet, while certainly promoted by different communities in different degrees, will be borne ultimately by all regard less of linguistic, religious, or culinary differences. I am not arguing that the biospheric perspective undermines all claims about cultural relativity. My point is that attention to cultural differences must not obscure the fact that all cultures together participate in the biospheric community. There are realities that are common to all cultures, and these recalcitrant realities establish sharp boundaries with respect to what may be judged to constitute an adequate interpretation. The constraints the biosphere imposes on the ordering of human life and our productive practices highlights the bankruptcy of overblown claims in philosophical and theological anthropologies regarding humanity's "worldmaking" powers. "Doing" and "making" certainly are characteristic activities of humans, but these do not exhaust the range of our modes of living in the world.30 The linguistic turn in philosophy has provided an important critique of the objectivist position and has often used vivid expressions to make technical and quite proper claims about epistemological issues. My concern is that these expressions are often carried out of their technical context and are used to buttress claims about the expansiveness of the range of human freedom and agency. Often the polemic against objec tivism becomes so strong that emphases and claims become unbalanced. C. P. Snow has correctly noted how the practitioners of the natural sciences and the humanities have come to constitute two distinct cultures each viewing the other across "a gulf of mutual incomprehension" and sometimes "hostility."31 This disciplinary separation often leads to deformities in discourse as certain issues dominate attention while other important issues are de-emphasized or ignored completely. If the typical occasion of sin for scientists is the temptation of crude objectivism, then the occasion of sin peculiar to prominent schools of humanists is a temptation to overstate the powers of mind, language, and culture. Sweeping assertions about the power of language and narratives to "construct worlds" should not lull us into dreaming that there is no "ready-made" world.</page><page sequence="13">Ecological Concern 125 Nelson Goodman, in Ways of Worldmaking makes the excellent point that language classifies, directs attention, and thus dynamically constructs our world of experience and thought. In his view there is no "world"; rather, there are various "world-versions" each built up for different purposes and described in various ways.32 Goodman's emphasis falls upon human freedom to create "worlds" through our conceptu alizing, selection, weighting, and design. He argues for the validity of plural frames of reference and holds that physics has no privileged epistemological fix on reality that makes it superior to art or philosophy. There are, he believes, multiple "contrasting right versions" of the world. However, he holds that we cannot get beneath our versions to test them for correspondence against some raw world underlying them because there is no "perception without conception."33 While his polemic against objectivism is loud, he does in a much more muted voice acknowledge that our "discerning" of patterns is as important as our "designing" of them. As he puts it, "if worlds are as much made as found, so also knowing is as much remaking as reporting."34 The importance of Gustafson's project is that it provides an important corrective to the model of homo faber armed with words creating worlds like God by fiat. We certainly remain agents, in Gustaf son's account, but we are agents who find ourselves participating in a world whose patterns we "discern" and whose patterns resist our attempts to impose "versions" unsuited to them. As Hilary Putnam (who generally looks favorably on Goodman's views) notes, people whose "version" suggests they can fly and who act upon this belief by leaping out of the window will "see the weakness" of their version "at once." For Putnam, data like falling and crashing provide "experiential inputs" to our knowledge.35 Like Gustafson, Barry Lopez in Arctic Dreams advances the view that a model of human interaction with and participation in an already ordered world is more accurate than "worldmaking." First, the landscape is not inert; and it is precisely because it is alive that it eventually contradicts the imposition of a reality that does not derive from it. Second, language is not something man imposes on the land. It evolves in his conversation with the land—in testing the sea ice with the toe of a kamik, in the eating of a wild berry The very order of the language, the ecology of its sounds and thoughts, derives from the mind's intercourse with the landscape. While the "correspondence theory" in epistemology has been shown to be inadequate, it is difficult to imagine individuals or communities surviving or flourishing who truly ignore the "fit" between their "versions"</page><page sequence="14">126 The Annual of the Society of Christian Ethics and the furniture of the world. In the realm of epistemology, talk of there being no "ready-made world" has plausibility, but such claims break apart when viewed from an ecological perspective. There are "ready made" realities which "enable" and "require" that life be lived in certain ways and not others. Is Gustafson then a foundationalist? If by "foundationalist" we mean a crude realist or objectivist in epistemology who thinks that we can get at the stuff of raw reality below, and independent of, our concepts, the answer is no. Gustafson especially stresses the way history and culture shape thought, including scientific thought. His ethics of discernment begins with interpretation and construal, and he refuses to lay out a set of principles that structure discernment in all cases. If by "foundationalist" we mean an ethicist who believes it is possible to define one permanent and universal ethical principle from which we can derive all other relevant moral principles, then again Gustafson clearly does not qualify. Theology and ethics are activities of practical reason, he holds, and both are to be tested for adequacy "in the light of a broad range of human experiences" (1:158). In his discussion of the affections, he describes his approach as an "empiricism" which accepts the pluralism of our affections (1:226). Like Thomas Aquinas, he accepts the "need for a 'naturalistic' basis for ethics," yet he rejects Thomas's belief that there is a single unifying telos which orders all of life and thus ethical reflec tion. "A 'naturalistic' basis for ethics must be satisfied with a variety of ends of human activity" (2:55). There is no principle or end that serves as an ethical Archimedian point.37 Still Gustafson's thought does seem to move toward a foundation alism of sorts. We might perhaps think of him as an "ecological foun dationalist." He stresses that the "patterns and processes of interdepen dence of life in the world are a basis, foundation, or ground upon which ethical reflection is further developed." These are the "necessary conditions for human action," and as such they "are 'facts' which ground values." The "bottom line," he argues, is that the "value of the preser vation of human life and of other varieties of life issues in caring for the fundamental natural conditions on which life is dependent" (2:295-96). This, he holds, is "the juncture at which the most determined patterns and processes on which we depend yield the most immediate and direct values and imperatives." Because these "fundamental natural conditions" are "instrumental to everything else," they are worthy of "fundamental concern" (2:296). While not sufficient alone, these conditions are the "necessary basis for ethics" (2:298). Against Robert Johann's objection that the "moral order" emerges by means of moral "deliberation" and that it is sharply distinct from the "antecedent" order of nature,38 Gustafson replies by stressing the notion</page><page sequence="15">Ecological Concern 127 of "discernment" which better catches how our moral order emerges in closer continuity and conformity with the "boundedness of the ordering" of nature and society.39 "Ecological" is an expansive category and includes the sphere of nonhuman nature as well as human communities which remain fully natural communities even as they are linguistic ones. In describing Gustafson as an "ecological foundationalist," I mean to highlight the "ecological foundations" of his ethics; I do not mean to claim that these foundations directly determine the full content of his ethics. Gustafson clearly holds that the natural ordering provides no ethical "blueprint" (2:58); it is a necessary but not a sufficient basis for ethics. Conclusion Kant's achievement in the "turn to the subject" was to highlight that the mind has no access to "things-in-themselves." Rather reality for us is always enfolded in culture and shaped by the concepts that inform our experience and channel our attention. As Hilary Putnam is fond of repeating: "The trail of the human serpent is over all."40 It is true that mind, in this sense, enfolds matter, but this should not be the final word. Gustafson and critical ecologists remind us that human culture is in turn enfolded within the biosphere and that human history is enfolded within the natural history of the planet. Mind emerges from, remains dependent upon, and resides within, the material stuff of the biosphere. We must certainly "turn to the subject," but our expanded capacities for destruction require at the same time an ethical turn to the subject's participation within the ecosphere because historical subjects have initiated processes and practices which, if unchecked, will undermine the necessary condi tions for the existence and flourishing of human subjects as well as many other life-forms. There must be turns upon turns. Often anti-foundationalists stress the arrogance of those who seek to establish a transcendental epistemological vantage point or to devise universal ethical principles, but foundationalists have no monopoly on arrogance. It also often lurks in anti-foundationalist constructivist images of humanity heroically striding the planet recognizing no realities but those we "name" and make. The linguistic turn in theology and ethics has focused our attention on the role of narratives, texts, interpretation, "classics," and metaphors. These are important concerns and deserve careful examination for as Martin Heidegger puts it poetically: "Language is the house of Being."41 Still, let us be clear about the boundaries of our ability to make or remake the world, lest we unmake it through negligence. The "house of Being" includes more than language or language-users. Heidegger, I</page><page sequence="16">128 The Annual of the Society of Christian Ethics believe, captures a greater truth when he writes, "Only if we are capable of dwelling, only then can we build." He is surely right that we "must ever learn to dwell" upon the earth for the "basic character of dwelling is to spare, to preserve"—which means to "take it under our care. Gustafson's creation-oriented theocentric ethics performs a critical service in delimiting the requirements for our continued dwelling upon the earth.
