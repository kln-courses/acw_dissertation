<plain_text><page sequence="1">The dissipation effect: A general tendency in causal judgments about complex physical systems PETER A. WHITE Cardiff University This research was concerned with naive ecology: ordinary people's understand- ing of causal processes in nature. Three experiments were performed to inves- tigate the dissipation effect, defined by White (1997) as a tendency to judge that effects of a perturbation at a particular locus in an ecosystem or food web dissipate as they spread out from that locus. The experiments found further evidence for the generality of the effect, ruled out confidence in judgment as a possible explanation, and suggested that the dissipation effect may be a gen- eral feature of causal reasoning about complex physical systems. There is a danger that the dissipation effect may underlie unintentional maltreatment of the environment, and there is a need for more research on this. How do ordinary people understand the workings of natural processes? What sort of understanding do they have of the factors that regulate population levels in animal and plant species, the transfer of energy through biological systems, or the trophic relationships that define food webs? These questions fall under the aegis of naive ecology. White (1997) defines naive ecology as the layperson's understanding of how organisms interact in and with the natural world, and all cognition, particularly causal cognition, in which that understanding is evoked. The term interact is the key. The defining feature of naive ecology is not the unit causal relation or the kind of individual object of interest; the objects in naive ecology are biological organisms, and the naive under- standing of those, and of single cause-effect relationships in which they are involved, comes under the heading of naive biology (Atran, 1995; Keil, 1995). What marks out naive ecology as a domain is its concern with relationships between causal relations involving biological organisms (and the physical environment in which they exist). That is to say, its concern is with the processes involved in the interactions of organisms with each other and with the natural world. White (1997) investigated how people reasoned about the dynamics of a simple food web. The food web was verbally described as a set of eating relationships between various animal and plant species, togeth- AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY Fall 1998, Vol. 111, No. 3, pp. 379-410 ? 1998 by the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois</page><page sequence="2">er with information about physical conditions preferred by the differ- ent species of plants in the food web. Subjects judged how to bring about a particular stable change in the food web and also the effects of dif- ferent kinds of disturbance within the food web. Their judgments showed a consistent tendency that White named the dissipation effect: a tendency to judge that effects of a perturbation at a particular locus in an ecosystem or food web dissipate as they spread out from that lo- cus. In other words, the strongest effects were judged to occur at loca- tions adjacent to the perturbation, and the weakest effects at locations most distant from it. Distance was defined in terms of the number of other locations lying between two locations on the shortest route from one to the other. To illustrate, in the information about the food web, subjects were told that there were two species of plants, one preferring warm and dry con- ditions and the other preferring cool and wet conditions, and that the two species competed for space. They were then told about various spe- cies of herbivores that fed on one or other of these plants and various species of carnivores that fed on one or another of the herbivores (see Figure 1). Thus, in the distance measure, each herbivore was one link away from the plant on which it fed, and each predator of a given her- bivore was two links away from the herbivore's foodstuff (i.e., the her- bivore-carnivore link and the plant-herbivore link). Each herbivore was two links away from the plant on which it did not feed (i.e., the plant- herbivore link and the link between the two plant species). In one prob- lem subjects were told that over a period of years, the climate gradual- ly became warmer and drier. They estimated the effect of this change on the populations of all the species. The biggest estimated effects were found for the two plant species. Smaller changes were estimated for the herbivores: increases for those that ate the plant that benefited from the climate change and decreases for the rest. Smaller changes still were estimated for the carnivores, again with increases for species that ate herbivores that ate the plant that benefited from the change and vice versa for the others. Thus, the effect of the change in climate dissipat- ed in subjects'judgments with increasing distance from the location of the perturbation. Dissipation is not characteristic of the effects of real perturbations to food webs, which tend to be complex and unpredictable, and often greatest at locations remote from the perturbation (Pimm, 1982; Rick- lefs, 1993). The dissipation effect appears to represent unidirectional causal thinking. In other words, people tend to trace the implications of a perturbation in one direction, away from its location in the food web. This represents a failure to appreciate the interactive properties of natural systems (Laszlo, 1972; White, 1992, 1995, 1997). 380 WHITE</page><page sequence="3">White (1997) set four judgmental problems, including the climate change problem. Each concerned a perturbation to one location in the food web. Evidence of the dissipation effect was found in all four. How- ever, the study left a number of important questions unanswered. First, all fourjudgmental problems concerned the same food web and it is not clear whether the effect would generalize to other food webs. Food webs vary in a number of characteristics, any of which may be critical for the occurrence of the dissipation effect. The first two experiments report- ed here both used food webs with different characteristics to investigate the generality of the effect. Second, the food web used by White (1997) was constructed for the purposes of the study and not drawn from any- thing found in nature. Although it was the kind of reasoning (e.g., think- ing in terms of unidirectional causal relations versus thinking in terms of interactive systems), not its accuracy, that was the main focus of inter- est, it is important to investigate whether the dissipation effect is found in the case of a model food web that is an accurate representation of one found in nature, and in which dissipation is known not to occur. The second experiment is designed to investigate this question. Third, one possible alternative interpretation of White's (1997) re- sults is that they reflect varying degrees of confidence by the subjects in theirjudgments, not varying magnitudes ofjudged change. It is plau- sible that confidence in judgment should decline as the judge consid- ers locations increasingly remote from the perturbation simply because there appear to be more intervening variables to take into account. Because subjects were allowed to judge only the amount (and direction) of change they thought would occur, the only way they could express a reduction in confidence is as a reduction in magnitude of effect. White's data therefore do not allow this interpretation to be evaluated. Even if this interpretation were correct, however, it would not be a mere methodological artifact. Imagine someone whose reasoning reflected an understanding of the interactive nature of natural systems. Such a person would be equally confident (or unconfident) about all judgments because of his or her recognition that all components of the web are affected by their interconnectedness with all the other compo- nents. Even the effect of one component on its nearest neighbor is moderated by interactions involving the rest of the system. Regardless of whether the dissipation effect shows changes in estimates of magni- tude or confidence, therefore, it still represents unidirectional causal thinking. Nevertheless, it is important to investigate the extent to which the dissipation effect is caused by changes in confidence, and this is one goal of the second experiment. Finally, White (1997) suggested that the dissipation effect may occur because people are reasoning by analogy with other, more familiar 381 DISSIPATION EFFECT</page><page sequence="4">382 WHITE physical systems. If this is the case, then the dissipation effect should not be confined to judgments about food webs but should be a general feature ofjudgments about complex physical systems. It would obviously take many experiments to establish the validity of this proposition, but the final experiment reported here takes a first step in that direction by investigating judgments about a different kind of physical system, in this case one based on the hydrological cycle. EXPERIMENT 1 The main aim of this experiment was to investigate whether the dis- sipation effect generalizes to a food web with different structural prop- erties from the one used by White (1997). The food web used in White's study is shown in Figure 1, and the one constructed for this experiment is shown in Figure 2. In addition to the eating relationships depicted in these figures, in both food webs the two plant species were described as preferring different conditions of temperature and rainfall, and as Carnivore CI Carnivore C2 Carnivore C3 Carnivore C4 Herbivore H1 Herbivore H2 Herbivore H3 Plant P1 .

The food web used here has more trophic levels (four, against three in Figure 1). In Figure 1 the two halves of the food web have only a single connec- tion, at the level of plants. The two halves of the food web in Figure 2 have three connections, two above the level of plants. In Figure 1 each of the predators has only one prey species, whereas in Figure 2 three predators (eebugs, deebugs, and ceebugs) each have two prey species. 383</page><page sequence="6">In Figure 1 there is no omnivory. An omnivore can be defined as a species that feeds on more than one trophic level (Pimm, 1982). Be- cause omnivory greatly complicates the number of routes through the food web, it may alert subjects to the possibility of complex interactions within the food web, and it is therefore particularly important to assess the extent to which the dissipation effect depends on the absence of om- nivory. In Figure 2 there are two omnivores (deebugs and eebugs), re- sulting in a complex network of possible routes through the web. The approach taken in this experiment was similar to that taken by White (1997). Subjects were given a series of judgmental problems in- volving perturbations to the food web and asked to judge the effects of the perturbation on the population of each species, except the species perturbed. Subjects were repeatedly reminded that they were to judge only stable changes, and each time they were told that stable means that the population would maintain itself naturally at that level year after year, barring outside interference. This was an important feature of the instructions because it made it clear that there was time for interactions with the rest of the food web to occur and that subjects were to judge what would happen by the time those interactions had run their course and an equilibrium had been attained. METHOD Subjects The subjects were 39 paid volunteer undergraduate students of subjects other than psychology. Age and sex data were not collected but approximately two thirds were female. Forty subjects were originally run, but one was excluded before analysis for failing to follow the instructions correctly. Materials The materials consisted of a general information sheet, which subjects re- tained throughout the experiment, and a set of three judgmental problems. On the general information sheet, subjects were instructed to imagine a large field containing various species of plants and insects. They were told that the initial information described a stable state of affairs in the field and that they should imagine the field as a closed system cut off from outside interference except for the changes that would be described in the problems to come. They then read the following information, which verbally described the food web. Plant P1 thrives best under warm temperatures and high rainfall. Plant P2 thrives best under cool temperatures and low rainfall. Plants P1 and P2 compete for space: The more space one has, the less the other has. Aybugs only eat plant P1. Beabugs only eat plant P2. 384 WHITE</page><page sequence="7">Ceebugs eat aybugs and beabugs and nothing else. Deebugs eat aybugs and ceebugs and nothing else. Eebugs eat beabugs and deebugs and nothing else. Effbugs only eat eebugs. Subjects were not shown Figure 2, but were not prevented from drawing diagrams if they wished to do so. They were told to keep the information in view so that they could use it in the tasks to come. Three judgmental tasks were then presented, always in the same order. Problem 1. Subjects were told to imagine that a new species of insect is in- troduced to the field, geebugs. Geebugs eat only plant P1 and are eaten only by beabugs. Their task was to judge what effect, if any, the introduction of gee- bugs would have on the populations of the other species in the field. They were told to judge only stable effects, where stable meant a change that would natu- rally maintain itself year after year, once there had been time for it to get es- tablished, and assuming nothing else interfered with it. For the rating task they were given a population descriptor, such as popula- tion of plant P1, accompanied by the three alternatives increase, decrease, and no change. They were instructed to underline one of these. They were further in- structed that, if they had underlined increase or decrease, they should indicate how much change they thought would occur by putting a score from 1 to 100 beside it; the bigger the change they thought would occur, the higher the num- ber they should put. This is the measure that was used by White (1997). Problem 2. Subjects were first told to forget about geebugs and imagine that things were as they had been before geebugs had been introduced. They were then asked to imagine that a disease was introduced to the field that wiped out the entire population of deebugs, without directly affecting any other species. Their task was to judge what effect, if any, the elimination of deebugs would have on the populations of the other species. They were again told to judge only stable effects and were reminded of the meaning of the word stable. The judgmental task was as for Problem 1, except of course that they judged only effects on the remaining seven species. Problem 3. Subjects were first told to forget about the disease and assume that everything was as it had been before the disease was introduced. They were then told to imagine that, over the years, global warming takes effect and the local climate of the field changes somewhat, becoming warmer and wetter. Their task was to judge what effect, if any, this would have on the populations of species in the field. They were again told to judge only stable effects and were reminded of the meaning of the word stable. The judgmental task was as for Problem 1. Procedure Subjects were run either singly or in groups of two or three in a comfortably furnished office, supervised by an experimenter. If in groups, each was seated so that none could see what the others were doing. Instructions were all writ- ten, so the experimenter gave a brief introduction in which subjects were en- couraged to ask questions if anything was not clear. A couple asked whether they could draw diagrams and were told that they could. Subjects then proceed- 385 DISSIPATION EFFECT</page><page sequence="8">ed at their own pace. When they finished they were paid and thanked. Subjects were not debriefed at the time, but after the conclusion of this experiment and Experiment 3, which was run contemporaneously with Experiment 1 but with different subjects, information was posted on a noticeboard reserved for this purpose. Experiment 2 was run in a different academic session and the sub- jects were not undergraduates at the time information was made available about the other two experiments. RESULTS Two subjects failed to provide quantitative judgments for Problem 1 but then did so for the other two problems. Therefore, n = 37 for Prob- lem 1 and n = 39 for Problems 2 and 3. Mean judgments for each spe- cies in each problem are presented in Table 1. To test the dissipation hypothesis, only the magnitude of judged change was of interest, so the direction (increase or decrease) of each individual judgment was disregarded. In addition, it was not species as such that were of interest but the minimum number of links necessary to get from the location of the perturbation to the location of a given species. For example, in Problem 2 the location of the perturbation was deebugs. The minimum number of links from deebugs to aybugs was one, from deebugs to beabugs was two (via either eebugs or ceebugs), from deebugs to plant P1 was two (via aybugs), and so on (see Figure 2). The structure of the food web entailed that there were longer routes between locations as well; for example, there was a two-link route from deebugs to aybugs (via ceebugs) as well as the one-link route. In the analyses to test the dissipation hypothesis, distance was always defined in terms of the minimum number of links, and longer routes were dis- regarded. Where more than one species was at a given number of links distant from a perturbation, judgments were summed and averaged. Table 1.

For example, ceebugs, aybugs, and eebugs were all one link distant from deebugs, so in Problem 2 ratings for all three were summed and averaged to give a score for one link distant. These scores were the units of analysis for the test of the dissipation hypothesis. For Problem 1 there were three different distances: one, two, and three links. Scores were initially analyzed with one-way analysis of variance with repeated measures, which revealed a significant effect, F(2, 72) = 83.340, p &lt; .001. Planned comparisons using the t test for related means revealed that judged change was greater for species at one link distant than for those at two links distant, t(36) = 6.983, p &lt; .001, and three links distant, t(36) = 10.575, p &lt; .001, and also greater for species at two links distant than for those at three links distant, t(36) = 7.951, p &lt; .001. For Problem 2 there were also three different distances, from one to three links. Analysis of variance revealed a significant effect, F(2, 76) = 39.455, p &lt; .001. Planned comparisons revealed thatjudged change was greater for species at one link distant than for those at two links distant, t(38) = 5.306, p&lt; .001, and three links distant, t(38) = 7.201, p&lt; .001, and also greater for species at two links distant than for those at three links distant, t(38) = 5.025, p&lt; .001. For Problem 3 there were four different distances, from one to four links. Analysis of variance revealed a significant effect, F(3, 114) = 113.256, p &lt; .001. Planned comparisons revealed greater judged change for species at one link distant than at two, t(38) = 3.590, p &lt; .001, three, t(38) = 14.208, p &lt; .001, and four links distant, t(38) = 10.940, p &lt; .001. There was also greater judged change for species at two links distant than for those at three links distant, t(38) = 12.996, p &lt; .001, and four, t(38) = 9.763, p &lt; .001. There was no significant difference between species at three and four links distant, t(38) = 0.202. The results of these analyses are shown in Figure 3. Regression anal- yses of the means show that the results for Problems 1 and 2 were sim- ilar: The slopes were -18.333x and -13.012x respectively, a difference of roughly 5% of the range of the rating scale, and linear solutions ac- counted for 100% of the variance in the means in both cases. For Prob- lem 3 the slope was -20.538x, not profoundly different from the other two, but the linear solution accounted for only 86.2% of the variance in the means. DISCUSSION Judging from the slopes of the lines the dissipation effect was actual- ly stronger in this experiment than in White (1997), where the slopes 387 DISSIPATION EFFECT</page><page sequence="10">WHITE : 50- - \ o 40- 30 - 20- ----------- -- -- 10 I I I I 0 2 3 4 5 Distance (number of links) Figure 3. Relationship between mean judged change and distance from per- turbation, Experiment 1 varied from -10.549x to -12.219x, using the same rating scale. In the case of Problem 3, however, the linear solution accounted for less of the variance in the means. Figure 3 suggests that the greatest departure from a linear relationship occurred at three links distant, where the mean judged change was almost identical to that for four links distant. The species involved were ceebugs, deebugs, and eebugs, with effbugs being the solitary species at four links distant. Three links distant (in Problem 3) was certainly the level at which omnivory introduced the greatest complications into the structure of the food web because dee- bugs and eebugs, the two omnivores in the food web, were both at this distance. The fact that deebugs and ceebugs were both three links dis- tant from the perturbation, even though deebugs preyed on ceebugs, is an apt illustration of the complexities. However, it is not clear that omnivory provides the explanation for the low mean rating at three links distant. There are two main reasons for thinking otherwise. First, if we look at ratings of individual species, the least change was judged to occur for ceebugs, not for the omnivores. The mean gross rated change (that is to say, mean change when direction of judged change is ignored) for ceebugs was only 4.61, compared to 19.41 for 388</page><page sequence="11">eebugs, 35.95 for deebugs, and 19.36 for effbugs. The complication specific to ceebugs is that there were two routes that shared the mini- mum distance from the perturbation: via aybugs and plant 1, and via beabugs and plant 2. For a unidirectional causal thinker, these two routes generate opposite effects: Plant P1 benefits from the climate change, which increases the population of aybugs, which in turn benefits ceebugs. But plant P2 suffers from the climate change, which harms beabugs, and in turn harms ceebugs. The two effects therefore cancel each other out. And it is possible to arrive at this conclusion without engaging in system-type reasoning: Zero change is the outcome of two unidirectional changes with opposite effects. Deebugs and eebugs were connected to both sides of the food web as well. But in both cases the minimum distance clearly favored one side over the other. Eebugs were three links distant from the perturbation via beabugs and P2, but at least four links distant via any route through P1. Deebugs were three links distant from the perturbation via aybugs and P1, but at least four links distant via any route through P2. As Table 1 shows, subjects tended to judge that eebugs would decrease and deebugs would increase, which is what would be expected if the shorter route exercised the greater influence on judgment. Despite the complications introduced by om- nivory, the results were therefore compatible with the general hypoth- esis of unidirectional causal reasoning. Second, the complications associated with omnivory did not disrupt the linear relationship between judged change and number of links distant in the other two problems. In Problem 2, for example, the per- turbation afflicted deebugs, which lay right at the heart of the omnivo- rous relationships. Yet in this case the relationship between judged change and number of links distant was exactly linear, and the slope of the change was actually greater than for any of the problems studied by White (1997). In general, then, the results of this experiment provide strong evi- dence for the dissipation effect despite the use of a food web with pro- nounced omnivory. The results suggest that one minor qualification is appropriate: Where two routes with opposite judged effects share the minimum distance between a given location and the perturbation, judged change is close to zero, and the dissipation effect may be atten- uated or eliminated. Even so, this qualification can be interpreted as an instance of unidirectional causal thinking. Moreover, where there are two or more routes of different lengths, the pattern of results is consis- tent with the interpretation that only the shorter or shortest route in- fluences judgment to any significant degree. The findings are consis- tent with the hypothesis that people treat food webs as unidirectional chains, not as interactive systems. 389 DISSIPATION EFFECT</page><page sequence="12">EXPERIMENT 2 The aims of this experiment were to test the dissipation hypothesis using a model of a real food web and to investigate the possibility that the effect might be attributable to changes in confidence. The food web used in this experiment was taken from Paine (1963). It can also be found in Pimm (1982, p. 131).1 The food web used in this experiment is shown in Figure 4. The structure of the food web was faithful to the original. However, English names were used in place of the Latin names in Paine's version. It should also be noted that some locations in the food web were occupied by more than one species, and this has been glossed over in Figure 4. It was considered unlikely that this would make a difference to lay causal judgment. There was a mild degree of omnivo- ry in the food web: Starfish 2 was an omnivore, feeding on more than one trophic level, but there were no others. The specific problems used in this experiment were slightly different from those used in the previous one. It was judged inappropriate to use problems in which new species were introduced or existing species wiped out because this would make the food web different from the one discovered by Paine (1963). To ensure that the structure of the food web remained faithful to the original, therefore, two problems were devised involving increases and decreases (but not extinction) in species in the food web. Subjects were also asked to rate their confidence in each judg- ment they made. Starfish I Starfish 2 Seli / Shellfish 2 Shellfish 1 / \ Shellfish 3 Shellfish 4 Worm 1 Figure 4. Food web used in Experiment 2 390 WHITE</page><page sequence="13">METHOD Subjects The subjects were 46 paid volunteer undergraduate students of subjects other than psychology. Age and sex data were not collected, but approximately two thirds were female. Materials The form of presentation was similar to that for Experiment 1. The general information sheet asked subjects to imagine a small community of animals liv- ing in the sea. They were informed that the list of who eats what described a real food web, simplified only in that common names were used instead of scientific ones. They then saw the following information: Starfish 1 eats Shellfish 1. Starfish 1 eats Shellfish 2. Starfish 2 eats Shellfish 2. Starfish 2 eats Shellfish 3. Starfish 2 eats Worm 1. Shellfish 2 eats Shellfish 4. Shellfish 2 eats Worm 1. Subjects were not shown Figure 4, but were not prevented from drawing di- agrams if they wished to do so. They were told to keep the information in view so that they could use it in the tasks to come. Two judgmental tasks were then presented. Half of the subjects received them in one order, half in the reverse order. Problem 1. Subjects were instructed to imagine that, as part of a study of the way food webs work, scientists removed half(50%) of the population of Shellfish 1 from the community. The subjects' task was to judge what effect this would have, if any, on the populations of the other species in the community. This was followed with the instructions about rating stable change and the instruc- tions for the judgmental task that were used in Experiment 1. Subjects were then told that, under each judgment, they would see the word confidence. They were instructed to put beside this a number from 1 to 7 indicating how confi- dent they felt about their judgment, where "1" meant that they had no confi- dence at all and "7" meant that they were completely confident. Problem 2. Subjects were instructed to imagine that things were as they had been before the change to Shellfish 1. They were then told to imagine that scientists introduced more of Worm 1 to the community, doubling the popula- tion of that species. Their task was to judge what effect this would have, if any, on the populations of the other species in the community. The remainder of the instructions were as for Problem 1. Half of the subjects encountered Problem 2 first. For these subjects the ref- erence to the change to Shellfish 1 was deleted. A sentence was added to the beginning of Problem 2 instructing them to imagine that things were as they had been before the change to Worm 1. Procedure All details of procedure were as for Experiment 1. DISSIPATION EFFECT 391</page><page sequence="14">RESULTS There were no effects of or interactions with problem order, so both orders are combined in all analyses reported here. Ratings of change Mean judgments for each species in each problem are presented in Table 2. As before, testing the dissipation effect meant analyzing by number of links between perturbation and species, again using the minimum distance criterion. For example, in Problem 1 Shellfish 2 was two links distant from the perturbation to Shellfish 1 (via Starfish 1), and Shellfish 3 was four links distant (via Starfish 1, Shellfish 2, and Starfish 2). For Problem 1 there were four different distances, from one to four links. Analysis of variance revealed a significant effect, F(3, 135) = 16.430, p &lt; .001. Planned comparisons revealed no significant difference between one and two links distant, t(45) = 0.026. There were significant- ly higher ratings of change for one link distant than for three, t(45) = 5.397, p &lt; .001, and four, t(45) = 5.633, p &lt; .001. There were also signifi- cantly higher ratings for two links distant than for three, t(45) = 4.004, p &lt; .001, and four, t(45) = 5.002, p &lt; .001. The difference between three and four links distant was marginally significant, t(45) = 2.010, p = .0504. In Problem 2 there were three different distances, from one to three links. Analysis of variance again revealed a significant effect, F(2, 90) = 50.363, p &lt; .001. Planned comparisons revealed significant differences in all cases. Higher ratings were given for one link than for two, t(45) = 3.987, p&lt; .001, and three, t(45) = 8.921, p&lt; .001, and there were also higher ratings for two links than for three, t(45) = 7.099, p &lt; .001. Means for these analyses are reported in Table 3 and displayed graph- ically in Figure 5. In general the results gave good support to the dissi- pation hypothesis, although there was no sign of an effect in the com- parison between one and two links distant in Problem 1.

For Problem 2 analysis of variance revealed no significant effect, F(2, 45) = 0.522. Planned comparisons confirmed that there were no signifi- cant differences between any pair of means: one link versus two, t(45) = 1.169; one link versus three, t(45) = 0.604; and two links versus three, t(45) = 0.309. DISCUSSION At first glance it appeared that confidence ratings were closely relat- ed to change ratings in Problem 1 and that the apparent support for the dissipation hypothesis could be interpreted as a change in confi- dence. Shanks (1987) argued that asking for causal judgment and confi- dence ratings separately unconfounded the two so that causal ratings were no longer contaminated by effects of confidence. However, there is no guarantee that subjects saw it that way, either in his experiment or in the present one: Subjects were not instructed to prevent confi- dence from influencing causal judgment and might not have been able to comply with such an order anyway. It is therefore possible that caus- al judgment could have been determined by both the judged causal relation and subjects' confidence in their judgment. Changes in confi- dence may therefore account for some of the findings on the change rating measure in Problem 1. However, closer inspection shows that they cannot account for the findings completely. In the comparison between one and two links distant there was a significant difference on the confidence rating but not on the change rating; indeed, the mean for two links distant was marginally higher than that for one link distant. By contrast, on the comparison between two and three links distant there was a significant effect on the change rat- ing but not on the confidence rating. In comparisons between adjacent numbers of links, only on that between three and four links was the difference significant on both measures. In other words, effects on the confidence rating tended to occur in different places from effects on the causal judgment. This is not what would be expected if the causal judgments reflected differences in confidence. If we look at individual species an interesting pattern emerges from the confidence ratings: Confidence is closely associated with trophic 394 WHITE</page><page sequence="17">level. The highest confidence ratings were given to the two top preda- tors, the lowest to the three species at the lowest trophic level, and an intermediate rating to the one in the middle, Shellfish 2. The relevant means are shown in Table 4, which also reports the results of related means t tests comparing pairs of means, with the significance level ad- justed using the Bonferroni correction. This pattern may account for the apparent relationship between confidence and rated change, because it happens that Shellfish 1 is closer on average to the two top predators (one and three links distant) than to the other species (two to four links distant) and closer to Shellfish 2 (two links distant) than to the species at the lowest trophic level (three and four links distant). As Table 4 shows, subjects also rated themselves as more confident aboutjudgments of top predators in Problem 2, although in this problem there was no appar- ent difference between the middle and bottom trophic levels. In the case of Problem 2 the result is straightforward. There is a strong effect on the change ratings supportive of the dissipation hypothesis and no effect on the confidence ratings. In this case, therefore, the effect on the change ratings cannot be explained as a change in confidence. This failure cannot be interpreted as being caused by insensitivity in the confidence measure because in Problem 1, a significant difference was found in confidence in the absence of a significant difference in the change rating. To summarize, changes in confidence may account for some of the evidence for the dissipation effect in Problem 1 but cannot account for all of it; changes in confidence do not account for the support for the dissipation effect found in Problem 2 at all. The apparent capacity of the confidence ratings to account for some of the results in Problem 1 could result from the fact that confidence was actually a function of Table 4.

This interpretation cannot be confirmed from the present data, but may be worthy of further in- vestigation. If confidence really is higher for higher trophic levels, this may reveal much about the way people reason about food webs. For example, they might start at the top and work down, and differences in confidence could emerge from that kind of organization in their reasoning. EXPERIMENT 3 White (1997) proposed two possible explanations for the dissipation effect. One possibility is that people may acquire beliefs about short- term effects of perturbations that they then generalize to stable chang- es. For example, by watching television programs concerning a year in the life of a community or group of animals, people may acquire infor- mation about the effects of relevant factors on the time scale of a year or a season, which they then suppose to be long-lasting because they lack further information about processes that restore equilibria on longer time scales. The second possibility is that people reason by analogy with more familiar physical systems that exhibit dissipation or appear to do so. For example, the ripples caused by a stone dropped into still water dissipate as they spread out from the point of origin, as do heat radiat- ing from a fire and light from a light source. Rolling objects tend to come to a halt unless they are going downhill or powered by something. Physical exertion also dissipates energy. Any of these could be taken as an analogy to food web dynamics, and doing so would result in the general belief that effects of perturbations dissipate in the manner of a process running out of energy. It would take a considerable program of research to investigate this possibility thoroughly. Experiment 3 had the more limited aim of seeking evidence for the dissipation effect in a nonecological system as a first step toward testing the claim that dissi- pation is a general property of beliefs and judgments about complex physical systems. Evidence to this effect would not refute domain-specific explanations because the two kinds of explanation are not mutually exclusive. However, it would give a better idea of the scope of the phe- nomenon and would enhance the plausibility of a more domain-gen- eral explanation. The materials for this experiment were based on the hydrological cycle and used true but somewhat simplified information about the relationships between temperature, humidity, rainfall, evap- oration, and other factors applied to a limited hypothetical geograph- ic area. 396 WHITE</page><page sequence="19">METHOD Subjects The subjects were 38 paid volunteer undergraduate students of subjects other than psychology. Age and sex data were not collected, but approximately two thirds were female. Materials The form of presentation was similar to that for Experiment 1. A general information sheet told subjects that in some parts of the world there are very shallow lakes that vary a lot depending on the weather. In wet periods they may extend for dozens of square miles, but in drought they may dry up and virtual- ly disappear. Subjects were asked to imagine such a lake and were given the following information about local climate in relation to the lake. 1. A wind blowing from the south brings in warm and moist air, raising both temperature and humidity. 2. A wind blowing from the north brings in cool and dry air, lowering both temperature and humidity. 3. Rising air temperature increases evaporation from the surface of the lake. 4. Falling air temperature reduces or stops evaporation from the lake. 5. Increasing evaporation from the surface of the lake increases humidity. 6. Evaporation reduces the surface area of water in the lake. 7. Reducing or stopping evaporation from the surface of the lake decreas- es humidity. 8. Rising humidity causes cloud formation. 9. Falling humidity prevents or reverses cloud formation. 10. Increasing cloud lowers the local air temperature. 11. Increasing cloud causes rain to fall. 12. Decreasing cloud makes it stop raining or prevents rain from falling. 13. Rain depletes clouds of moisture, causing them to get smaller or break up. 14. Rain causes an increase in the surface area of water in the lake. 15. Increasing the surface area of water in the lake increases evaporation. As before, subjects were not required to remember this information, but kept the information sheet in view throughout the experiment. The information is summarized in Figure 6. Subjects were not shown this figure, but were permit- ted to draw diagrams if they wished. As the figure shows, the system is less complex than it seems in the verbal information because some links (e.g., that from humidity to cloud formation) require two verbal statements to describe them. The arrows in Figure 6 show permissible directions of influence; for example, cloud formation and rain may both influence each other, but whereas temperature may affect evaporation, evaporation is not described as having any direct effect on temperature. This is important for measuring the minimum distance between two locations. This measure must be of causal connection between two locations, so it can be tak- 397 DISSIPATION EFFECT</page><page sequence="20">WIND CLOUD FORMATION TEMPERATURE HUMIDITY RAIN \V / SURFACE AREA A / EVAPORATION Figure 6. Hydrological cycle used in Experiment 3 en only in the direction of permissible causal influence. For example, the dis- tance from temperature to evaporation is one link, but the minimum distance from evaporation to temperature is three links (via humidity and cloud forma- tion). As a general guide, distance should be measured only by following the arrows in the figure. This is different from the food web studies because feed- ing relationships are invariably bidirectional: Eating affects both that which eats and that which is eaten. It should also be noted that, as the system was constructed here, wind is func- tionally equivalent to an external forcing function. External forcing functions are "material inputs from outside the system and physical conditions of the environment that influence the system's structure and function" (Ricklefs, 1993, p. 163). The relevant feature of external forcing functions is that although they influence the system, they are not influenced by it. That is, there are no pro- cesses of interaction, such as negative feedback, between the system and the external forcing functions. Thus, nothing in the system described here affects the wind, which is an input from outside the system. By contrast, the other components of the hydrological cycle, like species in food webs, are linked by 398 WHITE</page><page sequence="21">processes of internal control feedback. These tend to maintain stability by re- storing equilibrium levels after perturbations. The distinction between exter- nal forcing functions and internal factors was maintained in this experiment to make the formal characteristics of the system as similar as possible to those in the food web used in the study by White (1997). Four judgmental tasks were then presented, always in the same order. Problem 1. Subjects were told to imagine that their task was to bring about a stable increase in average rainfall. To bring this about, they were allowed to do only one thing. They could allow some time for the change to take effect, but they had no further control after doing the one thing they were allowed to do. They were told that, because things to do with the weather obviously fluctuate on short time scales, they should think in terms of an average over a period of time, such as average temperature. This was followed with the usual instructions about rating stable change. They were then presented with a list of possible changes and asked to rate the likelihood that each change would lead to success in achieving the goal by giving it a rating out of 100, where 0 meant that they thought the change had no chance of success at all and 100 meant that they thought it was certain to lead to achievement of the goal. They were told to assume that it was in their power to do any of the things in the list. This was included because at least some of the interventions are not normally regarded as under direct human control and might otherwise have been given zero ratings for that reason. These in- structions were designed to be as similar as possible to those used in Problem 1 in the study by White (1997). The list of possible interventions was as follows: Increase the average number of days with winds from the south. Raise the average air temperature. Increase the average amount of evaporation from the lake. Increase the average surface area of the lake. Raise the average humidity. Increase the average amount of cloud formation. If people have some grasp of the distinction between external forcing con- ditions and internal control feedback, they should realize that adjusting inter- nal factors is unlikely to lead to stable changes because such adjustments will be wiped out over time by internal control processes that tend to restore the previous equilibrium. The most effective way to cause a stable change is by changing an external forcing function because this change will not be subject to the effects of internal control processes. By this reasoning, the highest rat- ing should be given to changing the wind. Under the dissipation hypothesis, however, the highest ratings should be given to changes to components of the system nearest to the location of the desired change, which in this case would be cloud formation. Problem 2. Subjects were instructed to imagine that a new irrigation scheme is started and that this drains water from the lake, significantly reducing its average surface area. Their task was to judge what effect, if any, this would have. This was followed with the usual instructions about rating stable change and the instructions for the change rating task that were used in Experiments 1 and 399 DISSIPATION EFFECT</page><page sequence="22">2. Subjects rated average air temperature, average amount of evaporation from the surface of the lake, average humidity, average amount of cloud formation, and average rainfall. These corresponded to all components of the system in Figure 6 except the location of the perturbation. Problem 3. Subjects were first told to forget about the irrigation scheme and imagine that things were as they were before it was introduced. They then had to imagine that a specially bred species of water lily was introduced to the lake. The water lilies spread rapidly, and their large, flat pads cover most of the sur- face of the lake, significantly reducing the amount of evaporation that takes place. Their task was to judge what effect, if any, this would have. This was fol- lowed with the usual instructions about rating stable change and the instruc- tions for the change rating. Subjects rated average air temperature, average surface area of the lake, average humidity, average amount of cloud formation, and average rainfall. These corresponded to all components of the system in Figure 6 except the location of the perturbation, which was evaporation. Problem 4. Subjects were instructed to forget about the water lilies and imag- ine that things were as they were before they were introduced. They were in- formed that, over the years, the climate changes somewhat and the average number of days with a southerly wind increases significantly. Their task was to judge what effect, if any, this would have. This was followed with the usual in- structions about rating stable change and the instructions for the change rat- ing. Subjects rated average air temperature, average surface area of the lake, average humidity, average amount of cloud formation, average rainfall, and average amount of evaporation from the surface of the lake. These correspond- ed to all components of the system in Figure 6; the perturbation in this prob- lem was an external forcing factor. Procedure All details of procedure were as for Experiment 1. RESULTS Three subjects omitted one or more responses on Problem 1 but completed the remainder of the problems. For Problem 1, therefore, n = 35, and for the other problems n = 38. Mean judgments of likelihood for Problem 1 and mean change ratings for the other three problems are presented in Table 5. As before, testing the dissipation effect meant analyzing by number of links between perturbation and a given component, again using the minimum distance criterion. For Problem 1, where subjects were asked to judge what sort of change would bring about a change in rainfall, distance was measured by fol- lowing the arrows in Figure 6 from a given component to the location of the desired effect. For example, surface area was four links distant from rainfall, via evaporation, humidity, and cloud formation. 400 WHITE</page><page sequence="23">Table 5.

The dif- ference between two links and three was not significant, t(34) = 1.360. For the remaining three problems distance was measured by follow- ing the arrows in Figure 6 from the perturbation to the component in question. For example, in Problem 2, cloud formation was three links distant from surface area, the site of the perturbation (via evaporation and humidity). For Problem 2 there were again four distances, from one to four links. Analysis of variance revealed a significant effect, F(3, 111) = 10.444, p &lt; .001. Planned comparisons revealed no significant differences between one, two, and three links distant: one versus two, t(37) = 0.483; one versus three, t(37) = 0.457; two versus three, t(37) = 0.000.

The difference between one link and three was not significant, t(37) = 1.319. The first of these results is the only case in all these experiments where there was a statistically significant difference contrary to the dissipation effect. In Problem 4 there were again three distances, from one to three links. 401 DISSIPATION EFFECT</page><page sequence="24">Analysis of variance revealed a significant effect, F(2, 74) = 18.110, p&lt; .001.

Results for all four problems are presented in Figure 7. For Problem 1 regression analysis of the means yielded a slope of -6.478x, and the linear solution accounted for 95.6% of the variance in the means. For Problem 2 the slope was -4.216x, and the linear solution accounted for 68.4% of the variance in the means. For Problem 3 the slope was -2.190x, but not surprisingly the linear solution accounted for only 8.7% of the variance in the means. For Problem 4 the slope was -7.796x, and the linear solution accounted for 99.9% of the variance in the means. With the exception of Problem 3 the slopes were fairly similar, but only in Problems 1 and 4 was the linear solution really compelling. DISCUSSION On the whole these results give reasonable support to the hypothe- sis that the dissipation effect occurred in judgments about the physical system used in this experiment, just as it does in food webs.

I 3</page><page sequence="25">anomalous result, however. In Problem 3 the location of the perturba- tion was said to be evaporation. Two components of the system were one link distant from evaporation: surface area and humidity. Consultation of the gross judged change for these two factors revealed means of 39.66 and 52.89, respectively. As the latter was similar to the means for com- ponents two links distant from the perturbation, it appears that the low mean for one link is attributable mainly to judgments of change in sur- face area. The particular relationship between evaporation and surface area in the stimulus information may therefore account for this result. Evaporation and surface area are in a mutual relationship of nega- tive feedback: Increasing the surface area of the lake increases evapo- ration, and increasing evaporation reduces the surface area of the lake, which implies a decrease in evaporation. The two components are in effect a miniature system within the lake system described. Many sub- jects may therefore have worked out that perturbing evaporation will not lead to a stable change in surface area because of the negative feed- back relationship. If this is the case, then it is evidence that people can reason in a systemlike manner, at least if the system about which they are reasoning is sufficiently simple. One problem with this interpretation is that a similar simple negative feedback relationship holds in another part of the system, but subjects did not reason about it in the same way. In the stimulus materials in- creasing cloud is said to cause rain to fall, and rain is said to deplete clouds of moisture, causing them to get smaller or break up. In Prob- lem 1 subjects were asked how they would bring about a stable increase in rainfall, and the candidate with the highest mean judged likelihood of success was increasing the average amount of cloud formation. If subjects had reasoned in a systemlike manner about this simple nega- tive feedback relationship, they should have realized that increasing cloud formation would be ineffective. The fact that they did not suggests that they were not reasoning in a systemlike manner. Furthermore, the rain and cloud statements are almost adjacent in the stimulus materi- als (Items 11 and 13), whereas the evaporation and surface area state- ments are well apart (Items 6 and 15); if subjects noticed the relation- ship between evaporation and surface area, it is unlikely that they would have failed to notice the similar relationship between cloud and rain. A second problem with this interpretation is that it generates the prediction that many subjects would judge no change in surface area. In fact, only 9 out of 38 did so. Instead, there was little consensus about the direction of change, with 18 judging a decrease and 11 judging an increase. (Compare, for example, with judgments of humidity in the same problem, where all but two subjects judged that a decrease would occur.) Surface area is linked to evaporation not only directly but also 403 DISSIPATION EFFECT</page><page sequence="26">indirectly, via humidity, cloud formation, and rain. There was a high consensus among subjects that all of these would decrease as a result of the perturbation. A unidirectional causal thinker could therefore see two causal chains from evaporation to surface area, opposite in effect: Decreasing evaporation reduces the tendency of evaporation to reduce surface area, and decreasing rainfall reduces the tendency of rain to increase surface area. The direction of change judged by the subject may therefore depend on which of these unidirectional tendencies they see as the stronger. Moreover, it is not clear how the specific nature of the perturbation, the introduction of water lilies, would influence subjects' reasoning. It is possible, for example, that some of them interpreted surface area to mean only the part of the surface not obscured by lily pads. Or perhaps some of them reasoned that the lilies would add moisture to the air by transpiration or that they would catch a proportion of the rain that would otherwise have fallen into the lake. Or they may suppose, even though they are not told this, that any increase in surface area is offset by drainage through rivers leading out from the lake. Finally, whereas the previous experiments used arbitrary or unfamiliar sets of causal relations, the system described in this experiment is based on factual information about the hydrological cycle. It is therefore possible that subjects accessed and used in judgment preconceived beliefs about the cycle or parts of it. If these beliefs did not precisely resemble the infor- mation in the stimulus materials, then they would have influenced judg- ment in unpredictable ways. This adds to the difficulty of interpreting the anomalous result. It is therefore not possible to draw definite conclusions about this solitary trend contrary to dissipation, but it seems likely that it resulted from some idiosyncrasy of the particular judgmental problem used. Clearly dissipation is not an invariable characteristic of reasoning about complex systems, but further research would be necessary to ascertain whether this result shows systemlike reasoning. GENERAL DISCUSSION These three experiments have added to the body of evidence for the dissipation effect in causal judgments about complex physical systems. In Experiment 1 dissipation was found to occur in a food web with dif- ferent properties from that used by White (1997), including omnivo- rous relationships that considerably complicated the structure of the food web. In Experiment 2 dissipation was found to occur in reasoning about a model of a real food web. This experiment also found evidence 404 WHITE</page><page sequence="27">of dissipation in the absence of changes in confidence, implying that changes in confidence can be no more than a partial explanation for the dissipation effect. In Experiment 3 dissipation was found to occur in judgments about a different type of physical system. Dissipation was not absolutely ubiquitous in any of these experiments, and in Experi- ment 3 an effect contrary to dissipation was found in one comparison. The general consensus of findings, however, is clear. This is shown most clearly in Figure 8, which plots the means of the means for all 13 prob- lems used both in this article and in the study by White (1997). All prob- lems used a common scale of 101 points (once direction of judged change was taken out), so computing overall means was unproblemat- ic. Each problem had at least three different distances; seven problems had four, and two had five. Even though the number of problems con- tributing to the overall mean declined after three links, the relationship between mean causal rating and number of links is quite clear. Regression analysis of the means yields a slope of-8.143x, and the linear solution accounts for 96.1% of the variance in the means. Al- though it is not implausible that the curve would flatten as it approached either an asymptote or the extreme of the rating scale at the lower end, there is no sign of this in Figure 8. The high percentage of variance accounted for by the linear solution strongly suggests that departures 60 -c0---0- All problems 50 - 40- S 30- 20 i I I 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Distance (number of links) Figure 8.

Establishing the basic phenomenon of the dissipation effect is only a first step. The two main priorities for future research should be to in- vestigate further the generality of the effect across judgments about different kinds of physical systems, and to formulate and test possible explanations for the effect. White (1997) proposed two classes of expla- nation, one specific to the domain of naive ecology and one domain- general explanation. The results of Experiment 3 support the case for a domain-general explanation, but do not preclude the possibility of the domain-specific explanation in the case of food web problems. It is important to develop methodologies suitable for investigating beliefs about and judgments of energy flow in simpler physical systems: White (1997) gave as examples ripples spreading out from a stone thrown into a pond, heat or light spreading out from a source of radiant energy, objects rolling along a surface, and physical exertion by humans or animals. Despite the progress made in research on naive physics (e.g., McCloskey, 1983), little is known about how people reason about such processes, or whether such reasoning could provide models or analo- gies for reasoning about the more complex physical systems investigat- ed here. In particular, the development of reasoning about energy throughout childhood would shed much light on the judgmental pro- cesses underlying the dissipation effect. Other explanations can also be proposed. One possibility2 is that the dissipation effect may result from the limited capacity of working mem- ory. Although subjects can see all the written information about the system when making their judgments, it is still taxing to construct a mental model of the system, and only a minority of subjects actually drew any diagrams. Thus, although it may be straightforward to infer from a perturbation to a location one link distant, tracing out the pos- sible routes to more distant locations becomes increasingly demanding. Subjects may not have been able to construct a clear model of the links from a perturbation to a distant location because the task put too heavy a load on working memory. This explanation is not entirely straightforward. One would expect that increasing difficulty of the judgmental task would reduce subjects' confidence in their judgments, so that confidence would decline with increasing distance from the perturbation. But as Experiment 2 showed, changes in confidence were not closely associated with the dissipation tendency in causal judgments and could not explain more than a mi- nority of the differences observed. Moreover, it is not clear why increas- ing difficulty would lead subjects to make lower judgments of change. There is just as much reason to suppose that subjects would use the 406 WHITE</page><page sequence="29">judgments they can make as a guide to the magnitude of change that would occur for the cases that they cannotjudge. This would imply sim- ilar judged magnitudes of change for distant locations as for locations near the perturbation. The working memory limitation hypothesis would be stronger if it could explain why dissipation occurs, rather than a constant level of judged change, or indeed any other pattern. However, the hypothesis does receive indirect support from Green (1997, Experiment 4). In this experiment Green manipulated load on working memory by varying the complexity of a food web reasoning problem. He investigated whether subjects in their reasoning about the food web produced a two-way causal account (e.g., animal A affects animal Z, which affects animal A) or a one-way causal account (e.g., animal A affects animal Z). He found significantly more two-way causal accounts in the simpler of the two problems used, suggesting that the tendency to unidirectional causal reasoning increases as load on work- ing memory increases. That experiment was not concerned with the dissipation effect but does lend support to the idea that demands on working memory affect subjects' reasoning about food webs. The work- ing memory hypothesis is testable: One could compare conditions in which subjects have only verbal information about the food web, as in the present experiments, with conditions in which they are provided with a diagram of the food web in addition to the verbal information. The load on working memory should be significantly reduced in the presence of the diagram, so if demands on working memory are respon- sible for the dissipation effect, subjects given the diagram should show less dissipation in their causal judgments. Research is under way to test this. Another possibility3 is that the dissipation effect may reflect intuitive appreciation of error in successive links between pairs of elements. For example, suppose in the food web depicted in Figure 4 that the popu- lation of Shellfish 1 is reduced by 50%. Then in a unidirectional infer- ence from Shellfish 1 to its predator, Starfish 1, we might predict a fall in the population of Starfish 1. But the judgment of amount of change is of necessity an estimate and therefore subject to error. If we assume that error is constant for each link in a chain, then error accumulates as we move away from the location of the perturbation. Thus, smaller changes are judged for more remote locations because the perturbation is judged as making a progressively smaller contribution to population dynamics relative to the error contribution. This is still unidirectional causal thinking and implies a failure to appreciate systems properties, but it is of a domain-general kind: an intuitive appreciation of the way in which relationships between variables are attenuated by error be- tween pairs of variables in a chain. If this hypothesis is correct, then a similar effect should occur in reasoning about chains of any kind. 407 DISSIPATION EFFECT</page><page sequence="30">It is also possible that subjects may have judged only short-term chang- es.4 Care was taken to instruct subjects to judge only stable effects in every problem, and in every problem stable was explicitly defined as a change that would naturally maintain itself year after year, once there had been time for it to get established, and assuming nothing else in- terfered with it. However, it is impossible to be sure that every subject heeded this instruction. The problem with this is that system dynamics, such as those involved in restoring equilibrium after a perturbation, tend to occupy a considerable amount of time. Thus, the dissipation effect could emerge because subjects judge only short-term changes, and dissipation could be a genuine short-term phenomenon. Suppose a food web links species A to B, B to C, C to D, and so on. Then a perturba- tion to species A will affect species B, and the change to species B will affect A and C, and so on. Assuming each effect takes a certain amount of time, species D will not be affected by the perturbation to A for some time. Thus, in the short term, one might expect to see large changes in populations of species close to the perturbation and small changes in species further away. If people had an intuitive appreciation of this and judged only short-term changes in these experiments despite the instructions, then the dissipation effect would result. If this reasoning is right, then instructions that compel subjects to consider the long term should significantly reduce the dissipation effect. For example, judg- ments made by subjects instructed to estimate population levels 10 years after a perturbation should be less prone to the dissipation effect than those made by subjects estimating population levels 1 year after a per- turbation. Research is under way to investigate this possibility. It is important to investigate hypotheses of these kinds because they explain the dissipation effect by assimilating it to known processes or properties of the cognitive system. The implication of this is that dissi- pation would be expected to occur whenever those processes or prop- erties come into play in judgments of causality across a chain or series of factors or events, and furthermore that dissipation could be brought into meaningful relation with otherjudgmental phenomena. In the real world causes and effects do not occur in isolation but as elements in complex systems or chains comprising many events. Studyingjudgments about single causal relations in isolation may therefore give a mislead- ing impression of causal cognition by ruling out effects of the context of those causal relations, whether those effects be caused by general factors in cognition such as the limited capacity of working memory or by domain-specific factors such as acquired knowledge relevant to the judgment in question. Further investigation of hypotheses concerning the dissipation effect could therefore shed much light not only on the effect itself but on causal cognition in general. 408 WHITE</page><page sequence="31">In addition, it is important to investigate the possibility that the dis- sipation effect occurs in applied settings, in reasoning about real phys- ical systems. For example, what do farmers think happens to the pesti- cides they spread on their land? Do they suppose that pesticides naturally dissipate as they move through the food chain or the general physical environment of the farm and the surrounding land? The dam- age done by DDT occurred because the parties involved failed to pre- dict that precisely the opposite of dissipation would occur, so that the chemical accumulated in damaging proportions in the tissues of animals at the far end of the food chain from where it was introduced (Rick- lefs, 1993). This example demonstrates the practical as well as scientific importance of elucidating that extent to which the dissipation effect and the processes that lead to it may bias reasoning about complex physi- cal interactions. The present research adds to the small but growing body of work on naive ecology (Green, 1997; White, 1992, 1995, 1997). The paucity of research in this area contrasts with the rich and flourishing corpus of findings in other domains such as naive biology (Atran, 1995; Carey, 1995; Keil, 1995). In nature, individual organisms and species never exist in isolation but are always embedded in a complex network of causal interactions involving other organisms and physical variables. This is as true of humans as it is of any other species. Because we are ourselves located in systems and are constantly influencing and influenced by other organisms and species in those systems, it is evident not only that such understanding as we may have at an ecological level constantly enters into our interactions with the world but that there is both scien- tific and practical importance in investigating ecologically relevant cog- nition and its impact on our behavior. The dissipation effect is at most the merest glimmer of insight into this largely uncharted territory. Fur- ther research holds the promise of increasing the breadth of our un- derstanding of causal cognition in general, and at the same time help- ing to prevent some of the more destructive mistakes to which misunderstanding of the global ecosystem may lead.
