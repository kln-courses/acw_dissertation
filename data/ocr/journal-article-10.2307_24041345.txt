<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jade: An Indicator Of Trans-Pacific Contact? Jerry Towle* The few scholars who have attempted a balanced, rational evalua tion of evidence for pre-Columbian contacts between the Old and the New World generally admit that some characteristics of Ameri can civilization are not easily explained by local invention. At a su perficial level, at least, what may be called the jade complex of the New World is one of these characteristics. Advanced jade carving techniques appeared in Mexico with no evidence of local evolution; from a culture base in which the lapidary arts were virtually non existent arose Olmec jade artists who as early as 1000 B.C. displayed a technical proficiency equalling that of China.1 Though it is not the purpose of this investigation to evaluate the importance of trans-oceanic contact in stimulating American cultural development, jade carving is linked with the Olmec, the earliest high culture of Mesoamerica. This trait has parallels not only in Asia but also appeared in the New World at a critical juncture in history.2 While no one claims that artistry in jade is an indispensable stimulus to civilization, it is part of a culture complex that gave rise to great * Mr. Towle is an Assistant Professor of Geography at California State Uni versity, Fresno, 93710.

When the material becomes associated with ritual observance and is the subject of myth or when it is arbitrarily valued above similar mate rials, a number of traits relating to its use become joined in a culture complex. From archaeological inference to written records of early European observers, it appears that jade was a prized commodity in Maya and in Aztec culture as well as in Olmec. Written accounts deal only with the Aztec period but attest to the exceptional value placed on jade. A relatively small chalcahui was more valuable than a load of gold.4 One of the earliest chronicles of New Spain quoted a native father describing his daughter as "precious as a chalchihuitl."5 Similes involving jade abound; perhaps significantly both the Chinese and Mexicans may say: "He has a heart of jade" in reference to a highly esteemed person.6 In general, comparisons of jade with the good, the beautiful, and the divine are common in Mexico and China. Was the prizing of jade an arbitrary trait? Certainly it has a scarcity value, but this alone does not explain its exceptionally high status. Emerald is at least as rare as jade in Mexico yet seems to have been much less esteemed. Nor does jade lend itself well to carving. Both jadeite and nephrite are hard minerals, 6.25 to 7.0 Mohs, and both have fibrous structures making them difficult to fracture. Ne phrite, the jade of early China, is especially liable to show a splinter fracture with no plane of cleavage.7 It seems that Mexico and China were unique in having artists able to make a plastic medium of this refractory material. Though jade was highly regarded in other parts of the Pacific world, a combination of high technical proficiency and 3 Michael Coe, Mexico, New York, 1962, pp. 82-100. 4 Bernardo Diaz del Castillo, The True History of the Conquest of Mexico, New York, 1927, p. 86. 5 Elsie Ruf, "The Jade Story," The Lapidary Journal, Vol. 14, No. 5 (De cember, 1960), p. 315. 6 Stirling, op. cit., p. 43. 7 John Goetle, Jade Lore, n.d., New York, p. 29.</page><page sequence="3">YEARBOOK • VOLUME 35 • 1973 167 mystical regard was limited to Mexico and China. While raw or crudely-worked jade was valued among the peoples of British Co lumbia and Alaska, apparently no myths or superstitions were con nected with its use and possession.8 Likewise, Maori prized "green stone" highly but their artistic use of the material was far less elab orate than that of Mexicans or Chinese. In two widely separated cen ters a jade complex was highly developed. Moreover these centers meet the time function criterion; the Chou dynasty, a high point of jade artistry in China, coincided with or slightly predated the begin nings of Olmec art. The remainder of this paper is an attempt to ex amine various aspects of this complex to weigh the evidence for con nection and cultural interchange between these centers. Art Motifs No evidence exists that art style associated with early Olmec jade work derived from China. The Olmec used jade for many deco rative objects including small figurines, beads, polished celts, and votive axes.9 Dominant themes or motifs included representation of anthropomorphic jaguars in combination with infantile or dwarfed human forms. The art historian, Covarrubias, noted a "feline cult" linking this jaguar preoccupation with the frequent tiger representa tions of the Chou dynasty.10 This could be coincidence since the se lection of a totem animal is common among American Indians and probably is of very ancient origin. This is not to deny the questions posed by similar and very arbi trary art motifs on both sides of the Pacific. Some of the strongest general arguments for trans-oceanic contacts are made on the basis of art styles. Jade carving is no exception. Chinese and Mayan decora tive motifs seem to have converged some 10 centuries after the begin nings of New World jade carving. 8 George Emmons, "Jade in British Columbia and Alaska, and its Use by the Natives," Indian Notes and Monographs, No. 35, Museum of the American Indian, New York, 1923. 9 Tillie Smith, "The Main Themes of the 'Olmec' Art Tradition," Kroeber Anthropological Society Papers, Vol. 28,1964, pp. 126-127. 10 Miguel Covarrubias, The Eagle, The Jaguar and The Serpent, New York, 1954, pp. 44-45.</page><page sequence="4">168 ASSOCIATION OF PACIFIC COAST GEOGRAPHERS Ceremonial Use The most striking parallel is in the use of jade as a burial offering. Both Mexicans and Chinese often placed jade pieces in the mouth of a corpse. Although this may have been coincidental, similarity be tween the two cultures is strengthened by the common practice of painting funeral jades with a coat of bright red cinnabar.11 Burial practices involving jade persisted through the Mayan period. The Popul-Vuh records a Mayan custom of placing jade and maize in the mouth of the deceased, maize alone if the family were poor.12 A highly elaborate funerary use of jade was also characteristic of the Chinese. Belief that jade had the power to prevent decay led to the custom of stopping all bodily orifices with carved and decorated pieces. Mercury and cinnabar were placed in the mouth which was then plugged with jade to prevent the material from falling out. A more striking parallel with Mexican practices was the placing of un cooked rice in the mouth along with jade pieces.13 In proper Chinese burials, a number of ritual jade objects were placed in the coffin, among them a stylized tiger symbol, Hu, that lay at the right of the corpse. The tiger was the symbol of the West and was believed effec tive in barring demons from the grave.14 Though no stylized arrange ment of jade offerings appeared in Mexican graves, jaguar represen tations were frequently found in Olmec tombs, and the practice of burying engraved jade plaques is noted from Mayan sites.15 Techniques of Working Techniques of working which could be a key to similarity be tween the two regions are difficult to reconstruct. Covarrubias listed a series of methods "probably" employed by ancient Mexican lapi dary artists: sawing stone with flint implements, shaping it by means 11 Miguel Covarrubias, Mexico South, New York, 1946, p. 106. 12 Ruf, op. cit., Vol. 15, No. 1 (Jan., 1961), p. 50. 13 Goette, op. cit., p. 252. 14 Berthold Laufer, "Jade: A Study in Chinese Archaeology and Religion," Field Museum of Natural History Anthropological Series, No. 10, Chicago, 1912, p. 78. 15 Elizabeth Easby, "The Squier Jades from Tonina, Chiapas," in Lothrop, op. cit., p. 60.</page><page sequence="5">YEARBOOK • VOLUME 35 • 1973 169 of strategically placed drill holes used as points of reference, and then drilling or picking away all the surplus material and smoothing the surface with abrasives and water.18 The silica-rich stem of bam boo was used for final polishing. Using abrasive grit in a fluid medium was also employed in China where many different kinds and grades of sand were utilized.17 Such a gross comparison is worth little, how ever, since grinding and polishing of stone is widespread and of great antiquity. A rather exclusive trait, known from effect more than cause, which links the two regions was the ability to drill small perfect holes in jade beads and pendants. While the bones of birds were used as drills or carriers of abrasives in Mexico, more refined techniques existed. Olmec artists drilled such small-bore holes through tubular beads that even with modern facilities it is difficult to string the beads.18 In other Pacific regions where jade was worked, the technique was far less developed. Peoples of the Northwest Coast were unable to drill regular holes in the hard material, and the Maori could pro duce only unskillfully made crater-mouth holes.19 Use of string sawing has been reported from Costa Rica.20 Al though there are no specific references to string saws in Chinese jade artistry, certainly the Chinese were acquainted with the use of abrasive-coated string for other purposes e.g., kite battles, and further investigation of this trait may provide a rather specific parallel. Techniques of Prospecting In both China and Mexico a high proportion of jade was dis covered as water-worn cobbles and boulders which, through weather ing, had become virtually indistinguishable from other rock. Identifi cation of jade in the raw state required considerable skill, or luck, or 16 Howard S.

That it was an art is attested by the great difficulty modern researchers have experienced in finding Mexican jade sources; likewise, it appears that ancient sources within China proper have been lost. Knowledge of the prospector's art dates from rather late sources. Chinese reference books and writing on jade usually quote the T'sien kung K'ai Wu, published in 1637, as the authority on sources and methods of acquisition. Among the customary approaches was the searching of river beds on moonlit nights in autumn in the belief that jade reflected moonlight more readily than other substances. Another method was to make women strip and wade in the water; because jade was an embodiment of the yang or male principle, it was at tracted to the female yin principle.21 Mexicans reportedly believed that some individuals were espe cially talented in finding jade. According to legend, the experts stood in a promising place at sunrise, faced the sun, and looked for a mist or vapor arising from the earth as a sign of a buried jade or a boulder with a jade core.22 While methods differed, it is apparent that both regions had pro fessional jade prospectors whose techniques were closely guarded secrets. Though details differ, it is not totally unreasonable to derive these legendary methods from a common source. Medicinal Use Inasmuch as belief in the supernatural powers of jade empha sized its life-giving properties, it is not surprising that it was regarded as a curative agent. The most elaborate record of medicinal jade comes from China. Internal remedies based on chopped or powdered jade were used to provide a sort of alchemical balance, easing the disturbance of heat, cold, hunger, and thirst. When emperors fasted, their sustaining food was chopped jade. In the 16th century various jade concoctions were alleged to strengthen the heart and lungs, 21 Hansford, op. cit., p. 39. 22 Bernardino Sahagun, Historia General de las Cosas de Nueva Espana, Lib. 11, New York, 1938, pp. 277-278.</page><page sequence="7">YEARBOOK • VOLUME 35 • 1973 171 harden the bones, improve the blood stream, and soothe the nervous system. In addition to specific cures, the eating of jade was a religious rite among Taoists.23 Whether the ancient Mexican cultures had any comparable me dicinal uses is uncertain. A legend that the god Quetzalcotl was con ceived when his mother swallowed a piece of jade suggests that the idea of ceremonial ingestion was not unknown. When knowledge of jade reached Europe via Mexico, its earliest use was medicinal rather than decorative. Jade pieces placed over an afflicted part were alleged to cure "spleen stones" ( gallstones? ) and the current mineralogical terms reflect this usage. Nephrite is derived from the Latin nephriti cus lapis in reference to its effect on kidney ailments, and jade comes from the Spanish ijada, the loins. Because early chroniclers do not mention medicinal use among the Indians, it is uncertain whether the Spanish borrowed or invented this curious belief. Proceeding rationally, however, the Spanish would hardly be likely to formulate anything of this nature do novo. In acquiring jade from the Indians, they probably acquired belief in its medicinal powers as well. Some of the aspects discussed above are part of the jade com plex as it developed in China and Mexico. The aggregate can perhaps best be described as a mixed bag of general similarities with specific differences. Before attempting to evaluate the significance of these comparisons, there are some general complications to elucidate. The Time Factor As mentioned earlier, one of the chief attractions of the Ameri can jade complex for diffusionists is its contemporaneity with the first efflorescence of the art in China, yet most of what we know of the myth and ritual associated with jade in the New World comes from Spanish observers of the Aztec era. A two and one-half millenia time span is testimony to the depth and durability of the jade complex, but one must allow for considerable divergence. To demand precise agreement between the Chou dynasty and immediate pre-conquest Mexico is unreasonable. 23 Goette, op. cit., p. 228.</page><page sequence="8">172 ASSOCIATION OF PACIFIC COAST GEOGRAPHERS Archaeology cannot invest stone remnants with specific ritual meaning or tell a great deal of the beliefs and attitudes let alone the inspiration of their creators. However, the archaeological record does indicate a marked change in style between Olmec and Classic (ca. 500-1200 A.D. ) jade working. Where the Olmec favored blue, blue gray or translucent spinach green stone, later cultures adopted the familiar emerald green jade. Instead of the naturalistic were-jaguars of the Olmec, the later artists produced plaques and masks carved in low relief in which stylized cuts, curves and circles represented limbs and other features.24 Art styles changed markedly, whether from the impact of outside influences or from local artistic idiosyncrasies. Cer tainly there is no necessity to postulate contact with another culture. One possibility is that a mass production craft operation replaced the work of individual artists as labor specialization became more complex. Changes in attitude and myth complex almost certainly accom panied changes in style. We are fortunate if anything resembling precise parallels occur within two divergent systems. In most cases the question must not be, "Are these traits identical?" but rather, "Do they both stem from some common trait?" In this light the detailed specific points of similarity in Mexican and Chinese burial customs are remarkable, and the general parallels in prospecting techniques and medicinal use are valid as possible indicators of contact. 24 Covarrubias, Mexico South, pp. 112-113.</page></plain_text>
