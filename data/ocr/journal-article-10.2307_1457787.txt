<plain_text><page sequence="1">Eternal Values in Religion. By JAmES BISSETT PRATT. New York: The Macmillan Com- pany, 1950. 162 pages. $2.00. A foreword by Willard L. Sperry tells us the author of this posthumous volume left the ms. saying he wished it to be published. Sperry says that Pratt had worked on it for years. He was a philosopher with a collateral interest in psychology. He thought of philosophy as a guide to life, if not a way of life. He was deeply interested in religion and in the churches, first the liberal Protestant churches of the New England way, but also in all organized or systematised expressions of religious culture. He presents here a penetrating study of mysti- cism subjective and objective. In this volume he is mainly occupied with the idea of worship. Dr. Pratt discusses the psychology and justi- fication of worship; religion and the mind; the mystic's sense of Presence; the nature of Chris- tianity; faith, worship and sincerity; knowledge and religious experience. Considering reasons for the continuance of the Christian cult, Pratt begins with the influence of custom and habit. Public worship strengthens religious faith by connecting belief with things visible and tangi- ble and by reinforcing the faith of the lonely individual with the massive power of social confirmation. "We too often forget that faith is not merely a matter of logic and cognition. Long ago James pointed out that belief was an emotion. In a later treatment of belief Professor McDougall identifies it with the emotion of confidence. It is the feeling of satisfied desire or confidence on the intellectual plane." The discussion of the psychology of worship poses the question, Is objective worship in any sense to be rationally justified? The author says "Religion is not simply a way of acting toward one's fellowmen. It is a way of acting and a way of thinking toward or about the universe... I use the word religion to mean man's attitude toward the ultimate cosmic Power. Religion is no mere philosophical posi- tion. It is a felt attitude of a practical nature. It has to do with the practical question of destiny. What is going to become of me? What is going to become of us? Religion is one's attitude toward the Determiner of Destiny." Discussing the mystic's sense of Presence, Pratt believes it will be content to believe in God without defining him.

It will have nothing to say of specific answers to prayer or of divine inter- ventions. Yet he feels the testimony of religious consciousness through thirty centuries is not without cosmic significance. He admits that he was nonplussed when in India a student in public assembly asked "Sahib, what is Chris- tianity? In this book he says, "It is peculiarly characterized by love: love for God and love for man; an active outpouring of that love which forms the center of the Christian ex- perience. The love which it feels, the activity which it displays have for their background, and to some extent as their presupposition, a certain kind of attitude toward the universe." One wonders what warmth of love is likely to burn in heart of a man whose God is the Determiner of Destiny, if He is not also the "Dear Lord and Father of mankind"? One who was "in Christ" reconciling the world unto Himself? This book will rouse discussion. And that may be a most valuable thing today. JoHN GARDNER New York City</page></plain_text>
