Among his findings, William Labov con- cludes that "the principal problem in reading failure is not dialect or grammati- cal differences but rather a cultural conflict between the vernacular culture and the schoolroom some of this conflict proceeds from the pluralistic ignorance which prevails in the classroom: the teacher does not know that the students' rules are different from his own, and the students do not know just how the teacher's system differs from theirs. The chief difficulty which we can now point to, therefore, is not so much in the dialect differences themselves as in the ignorance of those differences." William Labov, the 1968 winner of the NCTE David H. Russell Award for Dis- tinguished Research in the Teaching of English, presents a concise, readable report of research methods and results and of some basic features of non- standard English. The study will find wide use in teacher training and cur- riculum planning. From the Foreword: "Labov's achievement lies not so much in producing con- crete solutions as in dispelling a number of old myths about the subject of his study. His suggestions to the teacher or student interested in nonstandard English are marked by his practical approach." Published by special arrangement with the Center for Applied Linguistics.

Follett presents The World of Language. Benefiting from the latest research findings in English studies and the recommendations of leading educators, this oral-language based English Program, for grades 1-6 features a spiraling learning approach in five general areas: communication /For children in the elementary grades, the program places a significant emphasis on oral-language development, leading to greater success in reading and writing. language skills /А distinctive feature is the discovery method, through which students see the difference between structure (grammar) and usage (language appropriateness). literature / Drawing from contemporary writings as well as the classics, The World of Language features a planned, developmental program using language in many literary forms (stories, poems, plays, and others). cognitive development /Another distinctive feature is the inclusion of mate- rial, at each grade level, to develop the skills of comparing and contrasting, classifying and categorizing, sequencing, and generalizing. human relations /The World of Language consistently correlates and extends content with photography and artwork to help children build a better self- image as well as a better understanding of the community around them. j FOLLETT EDUCATIONAL CORPORATION Dept.
