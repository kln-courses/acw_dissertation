<plain_text><page sequence="1">1967] Book Reviews 295 Textus : Annual of the Hebrew University Bible Project, vol. V (Jerusalem [Israeli sector] : Magnes Press, 1966). Edited by S. Talmon. Pp. 146 (English) ; 10 (Hebrew), n.p. Like its predecessors, this volume of Textus has significant material for the history of the OT text. Its first three articles arise out of the Qumrân Psalms text, llQPs a. Beyond the scroll as published by J. A. Sanders, another frag- ment (E) is made known here (pp. 1-11) by Y. Yadin. The publication, of parts of 3 columns that belong between fragments A-D and col. I of the con- tinuous scroll text, is of course excellently presented. Its editor states that the fragment was sold to him by a citizen of the United States, "who wishes to remain anonymous." Since this unknown fellow countryman of the reviewer must at the least have been aware that the fragment was smuggled out of Jordan, he has in his anonymity the cordial loathing of the reviewer, for the contemptible rogue he has proved himself to be. Be that as it may, this fragment provides the end of Ps 118, and portions of Pss 104, 147, and 105, in that order. In Ps 118,27, a reading 'swry (hg), with yod , is seen by the editor, and the photograph seems to bear him out, though certainty is not claimed for this variant (MT ' srzv ). Ps 105,3 has a reading [mebaqqes~' i^sônô which occurs otherwise only in the LXX of 1 Chr 16,10, where this Psalm is being quoted at length. Basing his observations on the non-canonical materials contained in llQPsa, S. Talmon proposes that the "blank in the middle of the verse" phenomenon in the OT books, especially frequent in the Books of Samuel, is a clue for the reader of the text as to the existence, in or outside the Bible, of parallel accounts or poetical paraphrases that go beyond the narrative he has before him. This will need to be tested further in the light of the rather ample Samuel texts being edited by F. M. Cross. Two incidental points puzzled the reviewer: Sanders and Yadin are not ( pace Talmon, p. 11) at variance on the dating of llQPsa : and classifying Ex 20,14 or Dt 5,18 as in narrative, rather than legal, context, by contrast with Dt 23,8 (pp. 15, 16) seems a bit forced. M. H. Goshen- Gottstein raises (pp. 22-33) the question of llQPsa' s relation to the canon, and to the canonical text, of Pss. He can indeed take issue with the designation of that MS as simply a Psalms scroll; the same would now apply to 4QPsf, which also contains extrabiblical texts (cf. J. Starcky in RB 73 [1966] 353-371). The reviewer, used to calling the Psalms adapted for recita- tion over the days of the week a Psalter (though this contains much besides Psalms), is not himself troubled by this usage. In the case of the Qumrân MSS, the label preceded the recognition of non-biblical elements; inevitably for llQPs a, since it had to be referred to somehow in 1956, when not yet fully un- rolled. For the rest, as G. suggests (p. 24, n. 11), it is the reviewer's position that llQPs* is derivative from the pre-existing collection of 150 Psalms. From G.'s position that llQPs* is a liturgical collection, he would differ only to go a step further: the scroll is not in itself a compilation for liturgical purposes, but an assemblage of Psalms and other materials (some of them already reworked</page><page sequence="2">296 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol. 29 and interpolated for liturgical use) into a library scroll whose direct purpose is the glorification of David as author, by attributing to him all that can be found of a hymnie nature that will superficially bear such attribution in a non-critical milieu. S. Iwry discusses (pp. 34-43) the reading wehannimsď of lQIs* at 37,31. Analyzing a series of OT passages for background material, he finds in the term a notion of "caught, captured," from which he derives sociological implica- tions, ending up with "displaced person(s)." The reviewer cannot make the term mean other than a person or persons said to have been present in a place on a particular occasion (even though sometimes the context implies that they habitually belong elsewhere). The occurrences bearing on Is 37 are best read, the reviewer thinks, in the light of 1 Chr 29,17. C. Rabin, "Noserim" (pp. 44-52), starts from Jer 4,16 in one more effort to account, among other things, for Nazôraioi. In "A Recovered Part of the Aleppo Codex," M. H. Goshen- Gottstein describes (pp. 53-59) and reproduces on 3 plates the photograph of a 2-page opening in the famous MS, displaying text of Dt 4,41 - 6,3, thus including the Decalogue. The photograph appeared in a missionary publication from London in 1910, and this part of MS A is seemingly no longer extant. Progress in the study of other 10th century Torah MSS is indicated in the article. The remaining studies are: B. Keller, "Fragment ďun traité d'exégèse masso - rétique" (pp. 60-83) ; S. Esh, "Variant Readings in . . . Rashbam," (pp. 84- 92) ; Y. Ratzabi, "Massoretic Variants to the Five Scrolls from a Babylonian- Yemenite MS," (pp. 93-113) ; Z. Zinger, "The Bible Quotations in the Pesikta de Rav Kahana," (pp. 114-124) ; H. S. Gehman, "Adventures in Septuagint Lexicography," (pp. 125-132) ; J. Shunary, "Avoidance of Anthropomorphism in the Targum of Psalms," (pp. 133-144) ; report on the Hebrew University Bible Project, 1965-1966 (p. 145). J. Shunary's article yields the result that avoidance of anthropomorphisms is based on contextual considerations and habit, rather than on any rigid me- chanical rule involving any specific name from a part of the body. P. 140, line 24, read "with" for "without"; p. 145, line 4, read "Isaiah chapters 2, . . ." (not: 3). Catholic University of America Patrick W. Skehan</page></plain_text>
