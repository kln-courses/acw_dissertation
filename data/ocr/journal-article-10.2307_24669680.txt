<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE LIKENESS OF THE IMAGE: ADAMIC MOTIFS AND צלם ANTHROPOLY IN RABBINIC TRADITIONS ABOUT JACOB'S IMAGE ENTHRONED IN HEAVEN BY SILVIU BUNTA Marquette Marquette Unwersity, Milwaukee Summary The present article analyzes the various texts concerning Jacob's image engraved on the throne of glory. It compares the Jacob texts with pre vious traditions regarding Adam's special status as the image of God or the equivalent of a cultic representation of an ancient Near Eastern king or of a Roman emperor. The Jacob texts reveal a similar anthropology that emphasizes the dichotomy of humanity. On one hand the earth liness of the functionality of the human body is associated with angelic opposition, and, on the other, the body's divine likeness gives rise to angelic veneration. The investigation of the two traditions demonstrates a conspicuous dependence of the Jacob texts on the Adamic traditions. The paucity and the succinctness of the midrashic and targumic texts concerning the image of Jacob on the throne of the divine כבוד do not permit an exhaustive ascertainment of their possible tradition sources. Contemporary scholarship does not furnish any attempts for such an analysis.1 1 Recent literature on these traditions includes Jarl Fossum, The Image of the Invisible God God (NTOA 30; Gottingen: Vanderhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1995), 135-151; J.

The texts employ terms and imageries used in Second Temple literature and early rab binic literature to describe Adam's special status as the image of God. The Jacob texts further construct a dichotomic portrayal of Jacob; the patriarch's heavenly dimension (i.e., his image enthroned in heaven) is contrasted with his earthly dimension. The latter dimension encoun ters opposition and ridicule from angels, while Jacob's heavenly status receives angelic worship. The dichotomous portrayal of Jacob is remini scent of the anthropology of Adamic traditions. In these traditions the protoplast's earthliness encounters opposition and ridicule from angels, in contrast to his status as the cultic statue of the godhead, for which he receives angelic reverence. For the purpose of illustrating the iconic function of Jacob, the Jacob texts employ a parable about the connection between a king and his cultic statues. This parable is developed within Adamic traditions for the exemplification of Adam's iconic value. The The Texts The traditions regarding Jacob's image in heaven are documented in several exegetic endeavors of targumic and midrashic literatures. In these exegeses Jacob's dream of Gen 28:12 is the portal to a heavenly reality. Jacob sees in a dream that his image is engraved on a heav enly throne. The revelation provokes unrest among angels, a to and fro journey between the sleeping patriarch and his enthroned image. Tg.Tg. Ps.-J. on Gen 28:12 states that the image of Jacob is "fixed on the throne of the Glory."2 A ladder facilitates the ascent of the wit OrigenianaOrigeniana Sexta (Louvain: Leuven University Press, 1995), 71-80; J.

Similarly, Tg. Neof. on Gen 28:12 describes the angelic ascent as the bearing of the good tiding that the prototype of the image "engraved on the throne of glory" is asleep on earth. The angels descend to look at the prototype of the heavenly image and again ascend to look at the image itself in heaven as in a desire to confirm the similarity.3 Jacob's image engraved on the throne of God is also mentioned in Gm. Rab. 82:2,4 as well as in Num. Rab. 4:15 and Lam. Rab. 2:1.6 A passage in Hekhalot Rabbati, a late mystical treatise,7 3 "And he dreamed, and behold, a ladder was fixed on the earth and its head reached to the height of the heavens; and behold, the angels that had accompanied him from the house of his father ascended to bear good tidings to the angels on high, saying, Come and see the pious man whose image is engraved in the throne of Glory, whom you desired to see. And behold, the angels from before the Lord ascended and descended and observed him" (Targum .Neofiti 1: Genesis [tr. M. McNamara; ArBib la; Collegeville: Liturgical Press, 1992], 140). 4 H. Freedman and N. Simon, eds., Midrash Rabbah (10 vols.; London: Soncino Press, 1961) [henceforth cited by writing], vol. Genesis, 752: "R. Isaac commenced: An altar of earth shalt thou make unto me .. . in every place where I cause My name to be mentioned I will come unto thee and bless thee (Exod 20:24). If I bless him who builds an altar in My name, how much the more should I appear to Jacob, whose features are engraved on My Throne, and bless him. Thus it says, And God appeared unto Jacob . . . and blessed him. R. Levi commenced: And an ox and a ram for peace offerings ... for today the Lord appeareth unto you (Lev 9:4). If I appear to him who offered a ram in My name and bless him, how much the more should I appear to Jacob whose features are engraved on My throne, and bless him." 5 Freedman and Simon, Midrash Rabbah, vol. Numbers, 94: "The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Jacob: Thou art exceedingly precious in my sight, for I, as it were, set thine image on My throne, and by thy name the angels praise Me and say: Blessed be be the Lord, God of Israel (Ps 41:14)." 6 Freedman and Simon, Midrash Rabbah, vol. Lamentations, 151: "Similarly spake the Holy One, blessed be He, to Israel: Do you not provoke Me because you take advan tage of the likeness of Jacob which is engraven upon My throne? Here, have it, it is thrown in your face! Hence, He hath cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel (Lam 2:1)." 7 The terminus ante quem of Hekhalot Rabbati is generally estimated at c. 800 C.E. This terminus terminus is established by a possible reference made by bishop Agobard of Lyons. Gershom Scholem first dated the text to the fifth or sixth century {Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism [3rd ed.; New York: Schocken Books, 1954], 40-79). He subsequently argued for an earlier date and further contended that the main concepts have Tannaitic origins (Origins of of the Kabbalah [3rd ed.; trans. Allan Arkush; Princeton University Press, 1990], 23; Jewish Jewish Gnosticism, Merkabah Mysticism and Talmudic Tradition [2nd ed.; New York: Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1965], 6). David Halperin contends that Hekhaht Rabbati Rabbati cannot be dated before the fourth century, although he concedes that certain materials have Tannaitic origins (The Faces of the Chariot [Tubingen: Mohr/Siebeck, 1988], 360-363).

Genesis Rabbah,Rabbah, a classical Palestinian midrash dated to the beginning of the fifth century C.E.,9 records an exegetical dissent attributed to R. Hiyya the Elder and his disciple and colleague R. Jannai.10 R. Hiyya the Elder was a Palestinian Tanna of the early third century. R. Jannai was a first generation Palestinian Amora. R. Hiyya the Elder and R. Jannai disagreed. One maintained: They were ascending and descending the ladder; while the other said: They were ascending and descending on Jacob. The statement that they were ascend ing and descending the ladder presents no difficulty. The statement that they were ascending and descending on Jacob we must take to mean that some were exalting him and others degrading him, dancing, leaping, and maligning him. Thus it says, Israel in whom I will be glorified (Isa 49:3); it is thou, whose features are engraved on high; they ascended on high and saw his features and they descended below and found him sleeping. It may be compared to a king who sat and judged in a [basilica];11 peo pie ascend to the basilica and find him [judging],12 they go out to the chamber and find him [sleeping].13 (Gen. Rab. 68:12)14 R. Hiyya apparently interprets בו of Gen 28:12 as a reference to the ladder. In R. Jannai's exegesis בו is associated with Jacob. It is difficult flux" and early mentions or references cannot be regarded as testimonies for a final redaction of the writing as a whole ("Tradition and Redaction in Hekhalot Literature," JSJJSJ 14 [1983]: 172-181, here pp. 174-176). 8 Peter Schafer et al., eds., Synopse z.ur Hekhalot-Uteratur (TSAJ 2; Tubingen: Mohr/ Siebeck, 1981), #164. 9 Genesis Rabbah is critically edited by Julius Theodor and Chanock Albeck in Midrash BereshitBereshit Rabbah: Critical Edition with Notes and Commentary (3 vols.; Berlin: Akademie Verlag, 1903-1928) [no volume numbers will henceforth be provided in reference to this pub lication, since the pages of the three volumes are numbered in sequence]. An English translation is available in Freedman and Simon, Midrash Rabbah. 10 Several other disagreements between the two rabbis are recorded: Gen. Rab. 22:5; 34:9; 55:7; 69:3; Lev. Rab. 9:6; Song Rab. 4:12. It seems that the disagreements of the two marked later exegetical schools.

Hiyya and R. Jannai con cerns solely the interpretation of the ambiguous biblical בו or it also extends to the motif of angelic derisive attitude toward Jacob. Only the ensuing expansion of the two rabbinic interpretations introduces the motif of angelic derisive attitude toward Jacob. This commentary interprets the movement of the angels "to mean that some [angels] were exalting him (i.e., Jacob) and others degrading him, dancing, leap ing, and maligning him."15 Peter Schafer notes that in rabbinic understanding sleep defines human Sterblichkeit and VerganglichkeiO6 He further argues: Die Engel entdecken, daB das Bild, das sie taglich im Himmel sehen und das von Gott so sehr geehrt wird, in Wirklichkeit das Abbild eines ganz gewohnlichen und sterblichen Menschen ist. Ihre Reaktion is der Spott: Sie verspotten den in ihren Augen erbarmlichen Menschen und sind sich ihrer LJberlegenheit gewifi.17 The contradictory reaction of the angels reflects the complexity of their vision; they see both the image of Jacob enthroned in heaven and Jacob sleeping on earth. The contrast enthronement-sleep expresses a polarity between glorification and prostration, dominion and vulnera bility.bility. This polarity resides in the essence of Jacob and, may be argued, of the human condition. Jacob is both the enthroned image and the vulnerable human asleep. In this context the quotation of Isa 49:3 emphasizes that Jacob's heavenly dimension is a representation of God and a symbol of divine presence. This ontological polarity of the human condition does not originate in Jacob traditions. While the attribution of the midrash can be questioned, the tradi tion about Jacob's image has known widespread circulation among early rabbinic circles. Additional evidence places the roots of the tradition before R. Hiyya's time and further associates R. Hiyya's circles with this tradition. 15 Based on the manuscript evidence it cannot be asserted with certainty if this addi tion is a unity or, as Friedman notes, if it exhibits two distinctive editorial processes, of which one, namely the mention of the angelic opposition to Jacob, involves "extra neous material from other Genesis Rabbah passages" ("Graven Images," 234). Even if the passage is a secondary addition, its inclusion into the text occurred before the middle of the fifth century and is nevertheless a testimony to early developments of the tradi tion about Jacob's image, as Friedman admits ("Graven Images," 234). 16 Rwalitat, 206.

Hul. 91b records, as Schafer notes, "eine verkurzte Fassung des Midraschs":18 A Tanna taught: They ascended to look at the image (דיוקנא) above and descended to look at the image (דיוקנא) below. They wished to hurt him (בעו לסכוניה), when Behold, the Lord stood beside him (Gen 28:13). R. Simeon b. Lakish said: Were it not expressly stated in the Scripture, we would not dare to say it. [God is made to appear] like a man who is fanning his son (כאדם שמניף על בנו), (b. Hul. 91b)19 The first half of the text is attributed to an unnamed Tanna. The attri bution is a conventional talmudic method of introducing a view that is extensively accredited to Tannaitic circles. The second half of the text is most probably juxtaposed to the view attributed to the Tannaim because of their common focus and similar interpretation of Gen 28:13. It further associates the tradition of the angelic opposition to Jacob with R. Hiyya's circles. It is accredited to R. Simeon b. Lakish (or simply Resh Lakish), a mid third century Palestinian Amora, who was a colleague and brother-in-law of R. Johanan (b. Nappaha),20 a disciple of R. Jannai. Num.Num. Rab. 4:1,21 which is part of the late (possibly medieval) section of Numbers Rabbah, attributes a similar interpretation of Gen 28:13 to the famous third century Caesarean Amora R. Hoshaya.22 R.

Hiyya the Elder, whose discipleship he shared with R. Jannai. In collaboration with R. Jannai he also contributed to the education of R. Johanan, and together benefited of the erudition of R. Simeon b. Lakish. Given the possible medieval dating of the text, the attribution must be considered with caution. It is necessary to emphasize the similarity between this text and the traditions attributed to R. Hiyya, R. Jannai, and Resh Lakish. The text also provides addi tional support to the connection between R. Hiyya's circle and the Jacob traditions. Modern scholarship has formulated several general conclusions con cerning the Jacob texts. First, in all forms of the traditions Jacob is doubled by his image/likeness (דיוקנא/איק1ךן). Second, the "throne of glory" or "of God," on which Jacob's image is engraved, is reminis cent of the throne of the כבוד of Ezek 1:26-28. Christopher Rowland has argued that this connection implies that Jacob is identified with the divine כבוד of Ezek 1:26-28.23 The identification is further sup ported by b. Hul. 91b,24 which preserves a supposed Tannaitic tradi tion according to which the angels ascending and descending on the ladder of Jacob are the four angels accompanying the throne of the כבוד in Ezekiel 1. David Halperin has noted that the identification is also proposed in a targumic Tosefta to Ezekiel in the medieval MS Montefiore, in which the כבוד is identified with the form (צורת) of Jacob.25 An identification of Jacob's image with the כבוד of Ezekiel 1 is also present in the Slavonic Ladder of Jacob.26 The association of Jacob with the כבוד of Ezekiel 1 introduces the possibility of a connection between the Jacob texts and traditions about Adam, who is a prominent identity of the כבוד in Second Temple lit erature.27 This possibility has remained heretofore unexplored. Linguistic 23 'John 1.51," 504. Rowland's argument is followed by Fossum, Image, 140. 24 "A Tanna taught: What was the width of the ladder? Eight thousand parasangs. For it is written: And behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it. At least two were ascending and two descending, and when they met each other [on the ladder] there were four (cf. Ezek 1:10); and of an angel it is written: His body was like the Tarshish, and we have a tradition that the Tarshish is two thousand parasangs long." 25 Faces, 121. See also Fossum, Image, 143-144. 26 Fossum, Image, 143, n. 30. Fossum's suggestion is further supported by Andrei Orlov's arguments in "The Heavenly Counterpart of the Visionary in the Slavonic Ladder Ladder of Jacob," in C. A. Evans, ed., Studies in Scripture in Early Judaism and Christianity (Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, forthcoming). 27 One of the earliest testimonies regarding the identification of Adam with the כבוד occurs in Moses' throne-vision in Ezekiel the Tragedian's Exagoge (verses 68-89), which</page><page sequence="8">62 SILVIU BUNTA and thematic analyses of the Jacob texts provide additional support for this connection. Linguistic Linguistic Considerations All the targumic Jacob texts and, with the notable exception of b. Hul. 91b, all the rabbinic texts designate the image of Jacob with איקונין, a Palestinian Aramaic transliteration of είκών/είκόνιον.28 A second cen tury C.E. (circa 140) papyrus (BGU #423) contains a phonetic link between the Greek terms and the Aramaic transliteration, namely είκόνιν.29είκόνιν.29 This form could either be an accusative singular form of είκών30 or a nominative-accusative-vocative form of εΐκόνιον.31 According is generally dated to the second century B.C.E. Critical texts of the passage can be found in M. Denis, Fragmenta pseudepigraphorum quae supersunt graeca (Leiden: Brill, 1970), 210; B. Snell, Tragicorum graecorum fragmenta /(Gottingen, 1971), 288-301; C. R. Holladay, Fragments Fragments from Hellenistic Jewish Authors. Volume II: Poets (Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1989), 362-366. In this vision Moses sees an anonymous humanlike figure on a heavenly throne, whom he designates as φώς. The throne is reminiscent of the throne of the כבוד in Ezek 1:26-28; the use of the term φώς for the enthroned humanlike being is an allu sion to Adam, defined by the wordplay φώς-φώς in Hellenistic Jewish circles (cf. the testimony of Zosimus of Panopolis in On the Letter Omega 10-15; text in Howard M. Jackson, ed. and trans., Zosimus of Panopolis, On the Letter Omega [Missoula, Mont.: Scholars Press, 1978], 28-37). A second early testimony comes from the second cen tury B.C.E. fragments of 4Q504 8 (Puech col. I), 1-7. For the relevance of this testi mony see M. Baillet, DJD VII (1982), 137-168; Crispin Η. T. Fletcher-Louis, All the Glory Glory of Adam. Liturgical Anthropology in the Dead Sea Scrolls (STDJ 42; Leiden: Brill, 2002), 92-93. A portrayal of Adam as the כבוד is preserved in T. Ab. 11. The identification of Adam with the כבוד is facilitated by Priesdy Source's and Ezekiel's correlative use of דמות. As Mark S. Smith notes, "whereas Ez 1,26 conveys the prophet's vision of God in the likeness of the human person, the Priesdy Source's vision of the human person is in the likeness of God" (Mark S. Smith, "Divine Form and Size in Ugaritic and Pre-exilic Israelite Religion," £AW 100 (1988): 424-427, here p. 427). See also John F.

Hul. 91b uses a late Jewish literary Aramaic cognate of איקונין, namely דיו קנא (with the variant דיוקן). Levy translates it as 'image.'33 Jastrow notes that the word is "a reverential transformation of איקון" and translates it with 'image' and 'likeness.'34 דיוקנא occurs in Targum Pseudo-Jonathan^Pseudo-Jonathan^ and scarcely in the Babylonian Talmud.36 Fossum has recently noted that the use in the Jacob texts of the words איקונין and דיוקנא bears witness to connections with early tradi tions about Adam, who is defined as the image of God in the same terms. Fossum has further noted that in Tg. Ps.-J. דמוח of Gen 1:26 and 5:1 and צלם of Gen 1:27 and 9:6 are rendered with צלם ;דיוקנא of Gen 5:3 is rendered with 37.איקוניה Moreover, in b. B.

Angelic Angelic Veneration and Opposition In the Priestly Source and the book of Ezekiel Adam's special rela tionship with the deity is defined by means of צלם and 38דמוח (Gen 1:26). The two terms belong to the vocabulary regarding the cultic statues of gods.39 Recent scholarship has further contended that the use of the two terms in the definition of Adam's special relationship to the deity implies that the protoplast was regarded as the equivalent of a -ιον often loses o, generating a form in -iv. E.g., κλειδίν for κλειδίον, in BGU #775. For this phenomenon, see Robertson, A Grammar, 260-261; Moulton, "Grammatical Notes," 34. 32 Dictionary, 60. In the family of the word, איקוניא (E.g., Deut.

This expands considerably the problem of aniconism versus icon ism in Second Temple Judaism. Shamma Friedman locates precisely the new issue: Of course, the ban on icons is in force ... But how about in the other direction? "I am my Beloved's and my Beloved is mine" (Song 6:4). If I manufacture an icon picturing my Beloved and worship it, I deserve the death penalty. Would my Beloved equally refrain from the graven image?41 For the Priesdy Source and Ezekiel, as well as for subsequent Adam traditions, the godhead creates its sole self-portrait in Adam. Crispin Fletcher-Louis has subsequendy extended the implications of the early Second Temple conception and has proposed a connection to the tradition about the worship of Adam.42 He has remarked that, in light of the cultic setting of Genesis l,43 "to speak of an 'image' in this context is to allude to a cult object."44 It could be further added that, as in the ancient Near East the statues of the gods mediate the presence of the gods to humanity in a cultic setting and for a cultic purpose,45 in early Second Temple Judaism the iconic Adam is also 40 Ε.

Therefore, Fletcher Louis remarks, "the theology of the worship of Adam story must now be rooted firmly in the beginnings of the Second Temple period."4® Sources from later Second Temple period build on this theology a tradition according to which at Adam,s creation the angels worship the protoplast as the image of God.47 An early expression of this tradition is 4Q381 1,10-11, which is paleographically dated to the first half of the first century B.C.E.48 The text is most probably a copy of an original from the Persian or early Hellenistic periods:49 "All His hosts and [His] ange[ls. .. ] to serve man (or Adam: ולעבד לאדם) and to minister to him (50". ...(ולשרתו Although the connection with the theology of the worship of Adam has not been noted in the first editions of the text,51 sub sequent studies have ascertained that the text reflects this theology.52 The belief that Adam was worshiped at his creation is also docu mented in the Latin, Georgian and Armenian versions53 of Life of Adam and and Eve.

This combination is most probably rooted in the Adamic tra ditions of the early Second Temple period. H. Niehr remarks that, given the conception of Adam as the equivalent of a pagan cult statue or idol, the inspiriting of Adam with divine breath in Gen 2:7 was in all probability associated with the ancient Near Eastern ritual of vivification of the cultic statues of gods.73 The angelic opposition to Adam, which in rabbinic literature exceeds the category of fallen angels,74 stands in contrast with the angelic ven eration of the protoplast. The contrast emphasizes the twofold nature of the protoplast. Adam is both the living cultic statue of God and, as Satan stresses derisively, a "youth."75 This dichotomy is situated entirely within Adam's body. His body is a mixture of divine likeness and clay.76 The Bartholomew Bartholomew and Encomium on Michael. The reading of the latter is worth mentioning: "The angels beheld the likeness and image of God in Adam and they fell down and worshipped him and gave him glory as the likeness of God fmy emphasis!" (Crum, "Texts Attributed," 396-397, n. 3). 72 The Armenian version reads: "when God breathed his spirit into you, you received the likeness of his image" (Anderson and Stone, Synopsis, 11). The Latin records: quando insicfflavitinsicfflavit deus spintum vitae in te et foetus est vultus et similitudo tua ad imaginem dei. 73 "Search," 93. For this ritual see A.

A: "When the Holy One, blessed be He, created Adam, He formed him (with two faces), front and back, as it is said, "Thou hast fashioned me back and in front, and laid Thy hand upon me" (Ps 139:5). Then the ministering angels came down to destroy him, but the Holy One, blessed be He, took him up and put him under his wings, as it is said, ,And Thou hast laid Thy hand upon me.'" (Judah Goldin, trans., The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan [2nd ed.; New Haven, London: Yale University Press, 1983], 15). For the motif of angelic opposition against Adam see also Gen.Gen. Rab. 8:4-6, b. Sanh. 38b, 3 Enoch 4:6. 75 Steenburg notes the presence of a similar duality in Sib. Or. 8:442-445: "The con cessive force of πέρ ("although") in the participial phrase, φ θνητω περ έόντι, assumes a tension between Adam being mortal and being 'served' by all things" ("The Worship of Adam," 97). Without discerning a connection with the motif of the angelic oppo sition to Adam, Steenburg continues: "Why this tension would exist is not clear" (ibidem, 97). 76 This bodily dichotomy escapes the attentive analysis of Stefan Schreiber, "Der Mensch im Tod nach der Apokalypse des Mose\ eine friihjudische Anthropologic in der Zeit des Paulus," JSJ 35 (2004): 49-69.

The ancient concept that Adam was created as a cultic statue of the godhead is also reflected in rabbinic sources. The editorial variants of Gen. Rab. 8:8, which expands on the significant rabbinic argument that God did not take equal council with angels in the creation of Adam,77 do not furnish a consensus concerning the source of the fol lowing parable: R. ליה/Laya78 said: There is no taking counsel here, but it may be com pared to a king who was strolling at the door of his palace when he saw a clod (79(בולרין lying about. Said he, What shall we do with it? Some answered: [Use it in building] public baths; others answered: private baths. I will make a statue (אדדיינטיס) of it, declared the king. Who then can hinder him? (Gen. Rab. 8:8)80 אדריינטיס is a corrupt form of 181.אנדריאנטוס/אנדרטא The word is an appropriation of άνδριάς, which denotes a statue of a human. In rabbinic literature the Aramaic transliterations generally indicate royal statues.82 It is significant that this rabbinic tradition opts for a parable about the building of an imperial statue for the illustration of the creation of Adam without angelic consent. God is compared with a king that wishes to make a statue of himself. Adam is associated to the resulting statue, which is created out of clod without the concurrence of the royal coun selors. The parable shows evidence of the same juxtaposition of Gen 1:26 and 2:7 as LA.E. 13:1-16:1. In the biblical story Adam is created out of earth and the material of the royal statue is clod. In both sto ries the clod is formed into a statue. 77 In regard to the rabbinic disputes concerning the partners of God in creation, see Alan Segal, Two Powers in Heaven (Leiden: Brill, 1977), esp. 121-134; J. Fossum, "Gen 1,26 and 2,7 in Judaism, Samaritanism, and Gnosticism," JSJ 16 (1985): 202-239. 78 Theodor proposes that ליה/Laya stands for Hila (Theodor and Albeck, Midrash BereshitBereshit Rabbah, 62). He also records the variant Levi (Theodor and Albeck, Midrash BereshitBereshit Rabbah, 62). Levi seems to be a secondary lectio facilior. 79 בולרין is most probably a corrupted derivation from βωλάριον, clod.

It must be noted that one (probably secondary) variant associates the parable with R. Levi. R. Levi was a late third century Palestinian Amora, a disciple of R. Johanan. He is repeatedly portrayed as a quite accurate source for the teachings of his master.83 The tradition of the angelic veneration of Adam receives another rabbinic formulation in Gen. Rab. 8:10, with the theological parameters that the tradition entails: R. Hoshaya said: When the Holy One, blessed be He, created Adam, the ministering angels mistook him [for a divine being] and wished to exclaim 'Holy' before him. What does this resemble? A king and a gov ernor who sat in a chariot, and his subjects wished to say to the king, 'Domine! (Sovereign)!' but they did not know which it was. What did the king do? He pushed the governor out of the chariot, and so they knew who was the king. Similarly, when the Lord created Adam, the angels mistook him [for a divine being]. What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He caused sleep to fall upon him, and so all knew that he was [but mortal] man (אדם); thus it is written, Cease ye from man, in whose nostrils is a breath, for how little is he to be accounted (Isa 2:22)! {Gen. Rab.Rab. 8:10)84 The parable is attributed without editorial variations to the famous third century Caesarean Amora R. Hoshaya, to whom Mum. Rab. 4:1 ascribes the teaching concerning the angelic opposition to Jacob. The tradition interprets the concept of image of God as physical resemblance to God,85 as do LA.E. 13:1-16:1 and Gen. Rab. 8:8. The 83 Gen. Rab. 91:8; 98:11 (dissent); Num. Rab. 2:12; Esther Rab. 3:10; 5:3; 6:3; Song Rab. 1:11; 1:11; Lam. Rab. 3:22; Eccl. Rab. 1:7. Dissent is also often attributed to the two: e.g., Gen.Gen.Gen. Rab. 98:11. 84 Freedman and Simon, Midrash Rabbah, vol. Genesis, 60; Theodor and Albeck, Midrash Beresh.itBeresh.it Rabbah, 63-64. The tradition reappears without attribution in Eccl. Rab. 6:9. A different version of the confusion is also recorded in Pirqe R. El. 11: "Adam stood and began to gaze upwards and downwards.... He stood on his feet and was adorned with the Divine Image. His height was from east to west, as it is said, Thou hast beset me behind and before (Ps 139:5). Behind refers to the west, and before refers to the east. All the creatures saw him and became afraid of him, thinking that he was their ere ator, and they came to prostrate themselves before him" (G. Friedlander, ed., Pirke de Rabbi Rabbi Eliezer [New York: Hermon Press, 1965], 79). 85 This, A. G. Gottstein contends, is in rabbinic Judaism the main connotation of the concept of image of God ("The Body as Image of God in Rabbinic Literature," HTRHTR 87 [1994]: 171-195, esp. pp. 173-176). See also Morton Smith, "The Image of God: Notes on the Hellenization of Judaism with Special Reference to Goodenough's Work on Jewish Symbols," BJRL 40 (1958): 473-512; idem, "On the Shape of God and the Humanity of the Gentiles," in Jacob Neusner, ed., Religions in Antiquity (Leiden: Brill,</page><page sequence="17">ADAMIC MOTIFS AND צלם ANTHROPOLOGY 71 resemblance between Adam and God confounds the angels. Unable to differentiate between the image and the prototype, the angels unwit tingly direct their worship to Adam. The angelic mistake, however, entails no binitarian intent. It has been argued that the parable expresses a rabbinic polemic against the tradition of the worship of Adam, consequendy viewed as a threat to monotheism.86 The argument exceeds the intent of the para ble. The parable solely opposes the worship of Adam as God. The enti dement of Adam to worship or reverence, as the representation of God, is not negated. The worship of Adam per se is not the intended sub ject of the text. The majestic procession of Adam in the divine char iot alludes to the common Roman practice of the festive ride of a victorious commander of the army (commonly the emperor) for pub lie veneration.87 In the rabbinic parable the angels fulfill the function of the revering spectators. Adam's ride in the divine chariot, alongside God, entails the entidement of the former to angelic veneration. The text also does not imply that the angelic adoration of Adam as God God resides in the recital of the 'Domine' (i.e., Isa 6:3) in front of the protoplast. The recital of 'Domine' for humans is regarded as a legit imate practice in some rabbinic circles, including apparendy the one of R. Johanan, R. Hoshaya's disciple (cf. b. B. Bat. 75b). The empha sis of the parable is that the angels direct the 'Domine' to Adam as God. The text thus emphasizes both the resemblance and the distinction between the image of God and God. They have the same form, yet they do not share the same nature. A. G. Gottstein has emphasized that the message of the text is that "Adam is distinguished from God not by form, but by the different quality of life attached to the same form; in other words, God and Adam are distinguished not by body, but by bodily function."88 The confusion of the angels is the consequence 1970), 315-326. For a critique of Gottstein's literal understanding of rabbinic references to Adam's body of light, see David H. Aaron, "Shedding Light on God's Body in Rabbinic Midrashim: Reflections on the Theory of a Luminous Adam," HTR 90 (1997): 299-314. 86 Steenburg, "The Worship of Adam," 98. See also C. R. A.

The complex relationship of Adam to God, relationship entailing both resemblance and distinctiveness, parallels the rapport between a statue of a Roman emperor and the emperor himself. The latter relation is analyzed in Exod. Rab. 15:17 in terms reminiscent of Gen. Rab. It is as if a beautiful tree was erected in the bath-house, and when the chief of the army with his suite came to bathe, they trampled upon the tree, and all the villagers and everyone else were eager to tread upon it. Some time later, the king sent his bust to that province that they should put up a statue (איקונין) of him, but they could find no wood except that from the tree in that bath-house. The artisans said to the ruler: If you wish to set up the statue (איקונין), you must bring the tree which is in the bath-house, for that is the best there is. They brought it and pre pared it thoroughly, and placed it in the hands of a carver, who fashioned the bust on it and placed it within the palace. Then came the ruler and bowed before it; and the general, the prefect, the imperial officers, the legionaries, the people and everybody else did likewise. Then did the arti sans say unto them: Yesterday, you were trampling on this tree in the bath-house, and now you are bowing to it. They replied: It is not to the tree that we are bowing, but to the bust of the king engraved thereon. {Exod.{Exod. Rab. 15:17)89 The worship of the imperial statue is not directed to its substance, but to its likeness, which is ultimately the emperor's. The relationship of Adam to God, which is also an image-prototype connection, entails that the worship of Adam as God's statue is intrinsically a worship of God. The worship of the image is a veneration of the prototype in its likeness.90 This is no more binitarianism than the worship of an ancient Near Eastern god in his statue.91 89 Freedman and Simon, Midrash Rabbah, vol.

The wor ship of the image as entirely equal to the prototype, likeness and sub stance,stance, as the angels venerate Adam in Gen. Rab. 8:10 and as the artisans view the cult of the imperial statue, is unwarranted iconologically (in the case of the imperial statue) and theologically (in the case of Adam). Gottstein has briefly remarked that Gen. Rab. 8:10 parallels the Jacob tradition in Gen. Rab. 68:12 (one may add b. Hul. 91b). He has empha sized that in both texts sleep symbolizes the distinctiveness of human ity from the divine.92 It could be added that both texts construct an anthropology centered in the concept of צלם. In Gen. Rab. 8:10 Adam is distinguishable from God not in body or form, but in bodily func tion. In Gen. Rab. 68:12 Jacob's image is identified with the divine כבוד, while the sleeping patriarch embodies the human Sterblichkeit and Verganglichkeit. The parallelism between the Adamic traditions and the Jacob texts also extends to the motifs of angelic veneration and opposition. In Adamic traditions Adam is venerated as a cultic statue of God. This status is contrasted with the nature of his body, which attracts angelic opposition and ridicule. In Jacob traditions the image of Jacob, which functions as the divine כבוד, receives the reverence of angels, while the sleeping patriarch is attacked with mockery.93 The association of both Adam and Jacob traditions with R. Hiyya the Elders school provides a possible traditional bridge between the Adamic and Jacob traditions. R. Hiyya had R. Hoshaya and R. Jannai as pupils. Gen. Rab. 68:12 ascribes the controversy concerning the lad der of Jacob ("D of Gen 28:12) to R. Hiyya and R. Jannai. In Gen. Rab.Rab. 8:10 and Num. Rab. 4:1 a formulation of the motif of the angelic veneration of Adam and a speculation concerning angelic opposition to Jacob are attributed to the same R. Hoshaya. b. Hul. 91b ascribes as as God's image need in no way threaten Jewish monotheism" ("The Worship of Divine Humanity," 125). 92 "Body," 182, n. 35. 93 The parallelism with Adamic traditions is also evident in a Jacob tradition pre served by Origen (Commentary on John 11.31; GCS 10: 88,23-89,2). The fragment is gen erally regarded today as part of The Prayer of Joseph. In it Uriel reveals to Jacob the latter's heavenly identity: Jacob is the "firstborn (πρωτόγονος) of every living thing" and "the archangel of the power of the Lord and the chief captain among the sons of God (αρχάγγελος δυνάμεως κυρίου και άρχιχιλίαρχός είμι έν υίοΐς θεοΰ)." Even though he is an angel, Jacob still faces the fierce opposition of Uriel.

The The Adamic/Iconic Value of Jacob and Humanity A theological bridge between Adamic and Jacob traditions is provided in the Adamic speculation concerning the transmission of the likeness to God from Adam to other humans or the whole humanity. According to this speculation the likeness has not been retained undiminished. One of the consequences of the fall of Adam was the diminishment of the protoplast's original enormous stature and bodily luminosity (cf. Gen.Gen. Rab. 12:6; b. Sanh. 38b etc.). Humanity still retains, although par tially, the likeness of the deity, b. B. Bat. 58a reads: R. Bana'ah used to mark out caves. When he came to the cave of Abraham, he found Eliezer the servant of Abraham standing at the entrance. He said to him: What is Abraham doing? He replied: He is sleeping in the arms of Sarah, and she is looking fondly at his head. He said: Go and tell him that Bana'ah is standing at the entrance. Said Abraham to him: Let him enter; it is well known that there is no pas sion in this world. So he went in, surveyed the cave, and came out again. When he came to the cave of Adam, a voice came forth from heaven saying, Thou hast beholden the likeness of my likeness, my likeness itself thou mayest not behold.... R. Bana'ah said: I discerned his [Adan^s] two heels, and they were like two orbs of the sun.94 Compared with Sarah, all other people are like a monkey to a human being, and compared with Eve Sarah was like a monkey to a human being,95 and compared with Adam Eve was like a monkey to a human being, and compared with the Shechinah Adam was like a monkey to a human being. The beauty of R. Kahana was a reflection of [the beauty of Rab; the beauty of Rab 94 The passage has a parallel in Lev. Rab. 20:2. An English translation that follows the standard Vilna edition is available in Freedman and Simon, Midrash Rabbah. It attributes the saying to Resh Lakish in the name of Simon b. Mennaseyah. A critical editition appeared in Mordecai Marguliot, ed., Midrash Wayyikra Rabbah (3 vols.; Jerusalem: Wahrmann Books, 1972). Marguliot's text ascribes the saying to R. Levi in the name of Simon b. Mennaseyah. The passage also appears in Eccl. Rab. 8:2, where it is attributed to R. Levi. For interpretations of the tradition see Aaron, "Shedding Light," 303-314, which is a response to Gottstein, "The Body," 179-181. 95 In Gen. Rab. 40:5 Sarah has the image (איקונא) and the beauty of Eve. The tra dition, either polemically, against the view attributed to R. Bana'ah, or incidentally, reads in the chain of beauty an undiminished resemblance.</page><page sequence="21">ADAMIC MOTIFS AND □צל ANTHROPOLOGY 75 was a reflection of]96 the beauty of R. Abbahu; the beauty of R. Abbahu was a reflection of the beauty of our father Jacob, and the beauty of Jacob was a reflection of the beauty of Adam. (b. B. Bat. 58a) Friedman notes that the Hamburg Codex completes the chain of beauty with: "The beauty of Adam the first was like the beauty of the Divine Presence."97 So do MS Munich 95 and MS Escorial G-I-3, both here and in the parallel b. B. Met. 84a. The addition is a logical conclusion to the previous comparison of Adam with the Shekinah. The beauty of Adam, who is created in the image of God, is itself a reflection of the beauty of God. The last phrase concerning the transmission of beauty from Adam to R. Kahana reflects a complicated editorial process. The phrase appears in a different context in b. B. Met. 84a, which omits Rab from the chain of beauty. It is improbable that the tradition has Tannaitic origins in its present form, as it is suggested in the attribution to R. Bana'ah, a Tanna from the early third century. R. Kahana was a late third century Palestinian Amora, disciple of Rab. Rab was a Palestinian Amora from the middle of the third century. R. Abbahu could only be the Caesarean Amora from the late third century. These rabbis flourished after R. Bana'ah. It is, however, highly probable, as Friedman notes,98 that the text combines two traditions, an early tra ditions that only mentioned the Shekinah, Adam, and Jacob, and a later development that added the rabbinic names with the evident intent to extend the transmission of divine resemblance from biblical to rab binic figures. The present form of the text dates before the sixth cen tury, when the redaction of the Babylonian Talmud was completed. The primary form of the tradition, which mentioned only Adam and Jacob, predates the addition of rabbinic names, which occurred after the activity of R. Abbahu in the late third century. In the first part of the text, itself of uncertain origin, humans do not retain Adam's likeness to God in its entirety. The likeness is trans mitted partially through history. Abraham, while he is not the perfect icon (דיוקנא) of God, still possesses the likeness of the icon (דמות דיוקני). It is unclear whether the end of the text, concerning the transmission 96 The mention of Rab in MS Vat. 115 disrupts the evident intent of the addition to establish a descending line of transmission of beauty from rabbinic authorities to Adam and the Shekinah. 97 Friedman, "Graven Images," 237-238. 98 Friedman, "Graven Images," 236.</page><page sequence="22">76 SILVIU BUNTA of beauty from Adam to Jacob, implies an undiminished resemblance between humanity and God, contrary to the previous imagery about the monkey-to-human transmission of the likeness. The language (cf. 'reflecting' מעין) is ambiguous; it does not attribute any degree to the resemblance. However, Jacob possesses the reflection, complete or par tial, of the beauty of Adam. The reflection of God in the human beauty, likeness, or form, con fers the whole humanity the value of representation of the deity. This seems to be a development of the early Second Temple conception of Adam as the equivalent of a pagan cult statue or idol. This develop ment of Adamic traditions is subjected in rabbinic speculations to the ban on icons, b. cAbod. £ar. 42b-43b attests to a tradition among the last generations of Babylonian Amoraim according to which the mak ing of a portrait of a human is prohibited, since it would be equiva lent to making an image of the deity." The prohibition is supported with an interpretation of את of אתי in Exod 20:23 as nota objecti ("me") instead of preposition ("with me"). This leads to the reading "You shall not make idols of me." Exod 20:23 is therefore read in conjunction with Gen 1:26. To follow Friedman's thought, while the deity is free to make icons of itself, humanity is still bound not to follow. The The The Roman Emperor and His Statues The speculation that extends Adam's iconic value to humanity is often illustrated with parables about the Roman emperor and his cultic stat ues. Lai. Rab. 34:3 attributes such a parable to Hillel: Another explanation of the text: If thy brother be waxen poor (Lev 25:25). It bears on what is written in Scripture: The merciful man doeth good to his own soul (Prov 11:17). Hillel the Elder once, when he concluded his studies with his disciples, walked along with them. His disciples asked him: Master, whither are you bound? He answered them: To perform a religious duty. What, they asked, is this religious duty? He said to them: To wash in the bath-house. Said they: Is this a religious duty? Yes, he replied; if the statues (איקונין) of kings, which are erected in theatres and circuses, are scoured and washed by the man who is appointed to look after them, and who thereby obtains his maintenance through them nay more, he is exalted in the company of the great of the kingdom 99 The story reappears in b.

Kutsko remarks that Ezekiel's connection between the shedding of human blood and God's with drawal from the Temple could have the same rationale as Gen 9:6.103 Additional sources furnish evidence for the circulation of the tradi tion regarding the iconic value of humanity and for its association with imperial images in Tannaitic times. In Mek. R. Ish. (Ba-Hodesh 8), a col lection of Tannaitic midrashim most probably compiled in the third century,104 murderers are viewed as guilty of diminishing the image of God and are compared to those who destroy cultic images of kings: How were the ten Commandments arranged? Five on the one tablet and fiveon the other. On the one tablet was written: I am the Lord thy God. On opposite it on the other tablet was written: Thou shalt not murder. This tells that if one sheds blood it is accounted to him as though he diminished the divine (likeness)105 (דמות). To give a parable: A king of flesh and blood entered a province and the people set up portraits (איקונות)(איקונות) of him, made images (צלמים) of him, and struck coins in his honor. Later on they upset his portraits (איקונותיו), broke his images (צלמיו), and defaced his coins, thus diminishing the likeness (בדמותו) of the king. So also if one sheds blood it is accounted to him as though he had dimin ished the divine (likeness)106 (בדמות). For it is written: Whoso sheddeth 100 Freedman and Simon, Midrash Rabbah, vol.

The creation of Adam "in the facsimile of God's own face" has direct and undifferentiated relevance for the treatment of every human face. Humanity retains the likeness of God fully. Any insult addressed to the human face is relationally transmitted to the divine face. The close connection between Adam and humankind is also attested in the beginning of Sirach 17. The creation of Adam is the creation of the human, άνθρωπος."2 The noun is generic. Subsequent references to humanity are plural: αύτοί. Verse 3 stands to attention: κατ' εικόνα αύτοΰ έποίησεν αυτούς. Adam's divine likeness is reflected upon all humanity. Mark 12:16-17 (and parallels: Matt 22:20-21, Luke 20:24-25) con stitutes a further evidence that the association between the connection of humanity with the deity and the relation of the imperial images (εί'κων) with the emperor circulates in the first half of the first century C.E.C.E. Gen.Gen. Rab. 68:12 uses a similar parable about the Roman emperor to illustrate Jacob's iconic value. As seen above, b. B. Bat. 58a establishes a direct connection of divine resemblance between Jacob and Adam. Jacob has the privileged position of heir of Adam's divine likeness. The use in the Jacob tradition {Gen. Rab. 68:12) of the parable about the Roman emperor, parable previously employed in Adamic traditions, further attests to the connection between the two traditions. An analy sis of Gen. Rab. 68:12 evinces further connections with Adamic traditions. It is thou [Jacob], whose features are engraved on high. They [i.e., the angels] ascended on high113 and saw his features and they descended below and found114 him sleeping.

The preference for ומוצאים is an obvious attempt to strengthen the parallelism between Jacob and the king, since ומוצאים is used for the king. 115 Four manuscripts contain משל, while the others simply introduce the comparison with the preposition ל.</page><page sequence="26">SILVIUSILVIU BUNTA 80 text: should read דן instead of ישן), they go out to the chamber and find him [sleeping] (emended text: should read ישן instead of דן).

All the manuscripts read: "It may be compared to a king who sat and judged in a פרוור; people ascend to the בסילקי and find him sleeping, they go out to the פרוור and find bim judging." Following a remark of Albeck,117 Schafer notes that, in order to preserve the intended parallelism between Jacob and the emperor, the text must be emended.118 First, the descent should reveal in both cases a sleeping individual. Second, for historical accuracy, בסילקי should be the judgment place.119 The above translation incorporates the necessary emendations. 120פרוור probably has a Persian origin, evident in the biblical form 121.פרבר Jastrow translates it as "open place, court."122 In the Roman period the term was associated with the Greek πρόθυρον ("vestibule"), association evident in the variant פרוזדור. The association added to the original meaning of the term (i.e., "court") the connotation of outdoor colonnade or portico.123 Porticos were common features of Roman imperial villae, large properties or estates in the country (cf. ],ויוצא), with houses and subsidiary buildings. The large porticos of the sumptuous villae villae were the preferred places for relaxation. The story of the emperor serves only as a parable (cf. משל or ל) or an illustration of the duplication of Jacob with his image. The paral lelism between Jacob and the emperor is implicit. The journey of the angels between Jacob's image and Jacob is compared with the journey of the people between the judging emperor and the sleeping emperor. 116 Freedman and Simon, Midrash Rabbah, vol.

The angels descend and find Jacob sleeping (ומוצאים אוחו ישן), the people go out and find the emperor asleep (ומוצאים אותו ישן). As Jacob sleeps down on earth and his image is on high, the emperor sleeps down in his פרוור, while the judgment takes place in a higher location (cf. עולים) in the basilica. The journey of the people between the basilica and the colonnade is fictitious, realistically impossible. The imperial villa was certainly not open to the public. The imagery is most probably the appropriation of a common literary motif of imperial subjects desiring to see the emperor in his entire imperial magnificence. As in the case of Jacob, the sleep of the emperor is a dramatic contrast to his glorious enthronement and the expecta tions of the people. The parallelism between Jacob and the emperor entails further con nections. The parable does not explicidy mention a portrait or a statue of the emperor. Friedman contends that the imagery refers to "two beings who looked alike, and not one person and his picture,י' and that it incorporates an apparently familiar motif of "a double vision of the king."124 However, the only example that he offers for this motif is from the Hebrew Bible and not from the Roman world. The parallelism of the parable with the story of Jacob and the fact that the concept of the emperor's presence in his images (based on the common likeness) is widely attested in rabbinic thought, as evinced above, presence that allows for the naming of imperial images as the emperors themselves,125 support the possibility that the sleeping emperor is doubled by an imperial image, as Jacob is doubled by his image. A closer analysis of the parable evinces further support for this possibil ity. The emperor's double in the basilica is both judging and sitting (cf. "sat and judged" יושב ודן), which implies enthronement. With the increasing role of basilicae in the imperial cult,126 role also attested in the Eastern provinces of the empire, statues of the emperors were 124 "Graven Images," 235. 125 The practice is common in the ancient Near East and ancient Israel (cf. the unqualified use of אלהים for both gods and their statues). It is also common practice in the Roman empire to refer to the worship of an emperor's statue as worship of the emperor. The awareness among rabbis of such a practice in regard to Roman impe rial statues is attested in Lev. Rab. 34:3. The proximity of a custodian of royal statues to these cult objects ensures for him the company of "the great of the kingdom," i.e., of the emperors. 126 E.g., the testimony of Vitruvius (De Architectura, v. 1.7), which attributes such a role to the basilica he has just built (shortly after 27 B.C.E.).</page><page sequence="28">82 SILVIU BUNTA placed in main apses of basilicae. These imperial statues mainly served as objects of the cult of the emperor and constant reminders of the extension of the emperor's absolute judicial powers within the whole Roman territory.127 An example is the famous statue of Constantine, which is unfortunately preserved only partially. The statue was built between 315 and 330 C.E. and placed in the basilica of Maxentius (henceforth of Constantine), after Constantine defeated him at the bat tie of Milvian bridge. The statue was thirty-feet-tall and portrayed Constantine on his curile throne, as an absolute leader and judge.128 Most probably Constantine's statue replaced a similar statue of Maxentius, according to the ancient Roman tradition of replacing an opponent's monuments with the victor's.129 The parallelism of the image of Jacob with the enthroned king also entails that the former is enthroned. Immediately previous to the para ble the text mentions Jacob's "features/image engraved on high" (שאיקונין 130.(הקוקה למעלה Two manuscripts131 do not contain the phrase "on high."

Conclusions Conclusions The succinctness of the texts about Jacob's image in heaven does not permit an exhaustive consideration of their sources.

First, both traditions demonstrate a similar anthropology and empha sis on humanity as both earthly, dimension identified in both traditions within the functionality of the human body, and heavenly, dimension associated in both traditions with the divine likeness of humanity. Second, both traditions symbolize the earthly dimension of human ity with sleep. Third, both traditions express the heavenly dimension of humanity in statuary concepts, through the concept of צלם in the case of Adam and by means of the equivalent Aramaic terms איקונין and דיוקנא in the case of Jacob. Fourth, in both traditions the dichotomy likeness-sleep is associated with the motifs of angelic veneration and opposition. In Adamic tra ditions Adam is venerated as a cultic statue of God, while his mortal ity or vulnerability encounters angelic opposition and ridicule. In Jacob traditions the image of Jacob enthroned in heaven receives the rever ential admiration of angels, while angels also ridicule and even attack the patriarch asleep on earth. Fifth, both traditions employ parables about royal images to illus trate the divine iconicity inherent in Adam and Jacob. Sixth, it can be safely concluded, based on the previous observa tions, that in Jacob traditions the image of the patriarch functions as a representation of the godhead, as does Adam in Adamic traditions. Jacob's image is defined in terms used in Second Temple literature and early rabbinic literature in regard to Adam's special status as the image of God. Moreover, certain rabbinic traditions regarded Adam's divine resemblance as transmitted to the rest of humanity in a chain of likeness. In this transmission of likeness Jacob has the special status of direct reflection of the beauty of Adam. A final observation is due. It has been proposed that the Jacob tra dition functions as an anti-anthropomorphic method of safeguarding God's transcendence.133 It must be noted that the identification of the כבוד with a human is previously claimed for Adam in Adamic tradi tions.
