In an earlier review of a recent collection of essays dealing with the archaeology of Jerusa- lem (JNES 57 [1998]: 1-3), I noted that the colleagues and core staff of the late Yigal Shi- loh have carried forth the work he began in the City of David with admirable dedication and</page><page sequence="2">300 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES VOL. 59 No. 4 quality. The present volume stands as further proof of that observation. In 1984, Shiloh him- self published an "interim" report on the first five seasons of excavations entitled Excavations at the City of David I (Qedem, vol. 19). Since the subsequent series of "final" reports continues the numerical sequence begun by Shiloh's initial pub- lication, the work under consideration is called Excavations at the City of David, vol. 4, even though it actually represents only the third of six final reports scheduled to appear. The volume presents the work of eighteen scholars from a wide cross-section of specialties and institutional affiliations, including (for the latter) Hebrew Uni- versity, Tel Aviv University, Ben-Gurion Univer- sity of the Negev, the Geological Survey of Israel, and the Israel Antiquities Authority. In organizing this monograph, the editors have presented the rather multifarious reports in three parts. Part I consists solely in D. Gill's geological study, which treats Jerusalem and its environs generally and the city's ancient sub- terranean waterworks specifically. Part 2 takes up the lion's share of the book and incorporates ten independent articles that cover various facies of material culture, including ceramic figurines, loomweights and whorls, Jerusalem's groundstone industry, weights and the practices of weighing in the City of David, flint implements, gemstones, beads and pendants, "Horus Eye" amulets, bird remains, and faunal remains. The editors describe the evolution of this potpourri in their preface to the book (p. vi). Each essay contains its own extensive bibliography; hence, neither a collec- tive bibliography nor an index of authors ap- pears at the end. Besides the excellent reference bibliography, every study also concludes with a complete catalogue of materials treated therein and usually includes a generous supply of line drawings and photographs of the artifacts under consideration. The authors deal with a myriad of technical facts in a very comprehensive and, to their credit, comprehensible manner. Conclu- sions regarding each topic are stated concisely and clearly at the end of every article. Finally, part 3 provides a concordance in which all rel- evant data (locus, registration number, stratum, category/type, IAA number, volume/page) are given for every object that has received individ- ual attention in the second and third final reports (i.e., City of David, vols. 3-4). This handy com- pendium complements a similar one that appeared in City of David, vol. 2 (pp. 167-88), and, taken together, these databases facilitate greatly the cross-referencing of published finds. Every exca- vation report should include this feature, espe- cially those that span multiple volumes such as this one. The concordance data are conveniently organized by excavation area (including surface finds), with Areas E and G on the eastern and northern slopes of the site contributing the largest number of finds to the catalogue. The lengthy chap. 2 presents a database of over 1,300 figurines recovered during eight seasons of excavations. The figurines fall into two cate- gories: anthropomorphic representations (usually women "displaying or clutching their breasts") and a markedly larger group of animal figures (of which 82 percent are horses). Parallels are cited for these items from the Iron Age II period gen- erally, without consideration of stratigraphical or chronological matters. But precision in these ar- eas seems required to buttress some of the con- clusions drawn in the study. For example, the author holds that the persistence of human, ani- mal, and bed-shaped figurines (Types A, B, and C, respectively) into the sixth century B.C.E. con- flicts with the Josianic reforms purported by the biblical texts. But the sixth century is, of course, post-Josiah, and cultic reforms such as the one described in the Bible often wane quickly with the accession of a new government (compare the Akhnaton-TutCankhamon transition in Egypt). The thesis requires tight stratigraphic controls that place the figurines securely in the heart of the Josianic reign, but even that would not nec- essarily undercut the historicity of the reform completely, for such measures were not likely ab- solute. A complete catalogue of figurines "pre- sented in order of typological classification" (p. 42) follows this essay, as do appendixes treat- ing the relationship of this facies of culture to the faunal world, the technology, provenance, and chemical characterization of the figurines, and the homogeneity of figurines recovered from Strata 13-10 (i.e., ninth century B.C.E. to 587/86 B.C.E.). Given that over 50 percent of the collec- tion stems from secondary contexts, some of the data seem overanalyzed. Still, interesting patterns emerge, such as the observation of a "marked in-</page><page sequence="3">OCTOBER 2000 BOOK REVIEWS 301 crease" in human vs. animal figurines in the late Iron II levels (p. 104). One wonders how this trend might relate to the results from some other studies that have stressed the rise in importance of the individual during this same period (for ex- ample, B. Halpern, "Jerusalem and the Lineages in the Seventh Century BCE: Kinship and the Rise of Individual Moral Liability," in B. Halpern and D. W. Hobson, eds., Law and Ideology in Monarchic Israel, JSOT Supplement Series 124 [Sheffield, 1991], pp. 11-107). Finally, this por- tion of the book concludes with drawings of 155 figurines (figs. 10-19) and photographs of 133 selected entries (pls. 1-10). A thorough and insightful presentation of loomweights and whorls by O. Shamir appears in chap. 3. The excavations recovered 186 loom- weights and 73 whorls scattered among the six- teen strata (pp. 20-25) spanning from the Early Bronze Age to the first century C.E. (p. 135). The author categorizes and analyzes them according to use (loomweight, whorl), material (unfired clay, poorly fired clay, well-fired clay, limestone or dolomite, chalk, and basalt), and shape (seven- teen different styles). Once again, however, the reader must become aware of the details sur- rounding the findspots. For example, 97 of 135 loomweights (72 percent) derive from two loci in Area G, Stratum O10C (late Iron Age II): L. 1108, described as a subfloor fill (73 loom- weights), and L. 1110, a living surface (24 loom- weights) (p. 137, Table 2). Regarding the latter findspot, it is important to note that it encom- passes both the "plaster from the floor of the 'House of the Bullae' (L. 967) and the earth fill beneath it ..." (p. 138) and that the 24 artifacts in question came from both deposits. The study concludes that the relatively limited number of whorls and loomweights recovered from the City of David points to domestic rather than indus- trial production there, while the large yield of sheep bones suggests that the textiles produced were of wool, not linen (p. 153). Yet the most prominent weight type attributed to the Iron II period consists in the heavier (in the hundreds of grams), doughnut-shaped style, which other studies have shown generally served in the spin- ning of linen, not wool (compare pp. 149 and 151). Lighter weights of a biconical form charac- terize the Persian period. In chap. 4, E. Hovers attempts a diachronic study of domestic stone tools in an effort to estab- lish temporal patterns within this class of arti- facts (pp. 171-72). To help identify typological changes, the author utilized seventeen categories of tools, with five groups relating to pounding in- struments (mortar, pestle, various styles of ham- merstones) and twelve belonging to grinding instruments (grinding stones/slabs, basins, mano, muller, etc.). The broader groups of pounding vs. grinding tools merge at the point of mortars (pounding) and deep bowls (grinding) (pp. 176- 77). The small sample consists in 190 implements made from eight categories of raw materials (mostly limestone; see p. 181, Table 4), including 40 intact items, which showed the greatest con- centration in Stratum 12 (eighth century B.C.E.). Multiple factors, however, led to disappointing results: only selected items were actually saved in the field; others were lost in either the field or the lab; some came from chronologically questionable contexts; broad stratigraphical des- ignations at points militated against a precise diachronic analysis (for example, Strata 17-20 cover roughly 1,200 years); 15 of the 40 intact items could only fit into a group labeled "varia" (e.g., chalk cylinders, geometric pebbles, etc.; pp. 179-80); and this branch of material culture generally proves difficult to date on typological grounds (a fact that once again accents the impor- tance of tight stratigraphic controls). As a result, the sample proved "useless in terms of defining any temporal patterns and diachronic changes" (p. 174), and "any attempt to relate metrical data to temporal patterns [was] rendered impossible" (p. 175). Still, the essay contains much helpful information, including practical, methodological suggestions offered in the conclusion regarding the future collection and preservation of these artifacts. D. Gill's and A. Shimron's petrographic description of selected specimens, which follows in Appendix B (pp. 193-94), shows that the ma- terials for a number of these tools likely origi- nated in the deep south or Sinai and, in certain instances, from completely outside the eastern Mediterranean area. A. Eran's extensive analysis of the weights and practices of weighing in Jerusalem (chap. 5) considers this area, by necessity, from the evi- dence of recovered weights alone; while balance</page><page sequence="4">302 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES VOL. 59 No. 4 beams and pans are known from certain other sites, none appeared in the City of David excava- tions. Scale weights at this site concentrate in two broad periods, the Bronze Age (27 weights) and the Iron Age (121 weights, again dating mainly to the eighth and seventh centuries B.C.E.). Like the groundstone implements, a number of these items were "made of materials not available in the neighborhood of Jerusalem': (p. 209, Table 4), a fact that increases the likelihood of the use of foreign standards in the Judahite capital. Ulti- mately, the study shows at least that "the mass standards used in Egypt, Mesopotamia and Phoe- nicia were known in Jerusalem" (p. 223). Eran's work not only analyzes the corpus of weights recovered through Shiloh's excavations but also provides a critical assessment of the history of retrieval, registration, and publication of weights by earlier explorers such as Macalister, Duncan, Crowfoot, Fitzgerald, and Kenyon (pp. 214-20). From this survey, we see that, though the com- bined excavations have saved more than 300 weights from the City of David, the collection covers such an extended time span that we are left with relatively meager evidence by which to evaluate the practices of weighing in any par- ticular century. Throughout, Eran remains sensi- tive to matters of methodology and interpretation. For example, the likely use of weights over a pe- riod of time (perhaps even generations) implies that we should not equate the date of the appear- ance of a certain type of weight with the date of its findspot (p. 220). S. Rosen's presentation of flint implements (chap. 6) continues to recognize methodological problems relating to the nature of the site, the artifacts, and of "archaeological interpretation and chronological attribution" (p. 257). For ex- ample, the usual small size of flint artifacts al- lows them to move beneath ground rather easily. Rosen shows that this movement generally oc- curs in an upward direction and that we should therefore expect more derived materials than in- trusive elements in any given layer. Further, "the vast majority of flint artifacts are not culturally or chronologically diagnostic" (p. 257); the ana- lyst must date them by context and by the assem- blage as a whole. With regard to this particular class of culture, then, "periods" are distinguish- able only through close stratigraphic analysis (p. 261). Despite such challenges, the author is able to utilize his database to address possible mod- els of trade and exchange, the eventual replace- ment of most lithic industries by metallurgic ones, and the reasons for the persistent use of flint sickles even after the establishment of ade- quate controls over bronze and iron industries (pp. 262-63). A. Swersky's report on 53 gemstones recov- ered from the City of David (chap. 7) represents a rare and welcome addition to archaeological reporting. To her credit, Kathleen Kenyon stands as virtually the only archaeologist ever to utilize the expertise of a trained gemologist (pp: 268- 69). This seems somewhat ironic, since gem ma- terials are durable and do not change severely over time (p. 273) and because gem testing in- volves nondestructive methods of analysis (p. 269). The novelty of this category of reporting perhaps accounts for the devotion of a significant portion of this article to an explanation of termi- nology and methodology used by gemologists. In the report on beads and pendants (chap. 8), S. Zuckerman refers to more than 60 objects made of gemstones, faience, glass, ivory, bone or stone, and categorized according to an early (1928) system established by H. C. Beck. This report treats only those items made of gemstones, faience, and stone; it complements an earlier publication of similar objects of ivory, glass, and bone (p. 276). Within this corpus, we find once again that only a small percentage (less than one quarter) of the collection comes from securely dated floor levels or other primary loci (p. 277). As with other small objects (for example, flint implements), natural pressures promote consid- erable subsurface movement of beads. An inter- esting, perhaps expected, correlation between raw material and form arose in the course of this in- vestigation. Generally speaking, smaller beads are round and made of translucent, veinless ma- terials. Larger beads may appear in biconical, elongated, or barrel-shaped forms fashioned from more opaque raw materials. Excavators recovered one complete and two fragmentary amulets showing the "Horus Eye" motif, and J. M. Cahill describes all three fully in chap. 9. In only a short space, the author ade- quately covers the meaning and etymology of the Egyptian term "wedjat-eye," the characteris- tics of the motif itself, the use of such eye amu- lets, and comparative materials published from</page><page sequence="5">OCTOBER 2000 BOOK REVIEWS 303 other sites. Although the motif is Egyptian in origin, says Cahill, there remains no compelling reason to assume that the City of David speci- mens were imported. The final two studies consider the bird remains retrieved from Areas A, D, H, and K (chap. 10), and the faunal remains from Areas A, B, D, H, and K (chap. 11). In the former, L. H. Horwitz and E. Tchernov discuss 71 identifiable bird bones representing five distinct avian species (p. 299, Table 1). While this collection comes from seven different strata, most of the fragments (45 of 71 = 63.3 percent) derive from an early Roman pot- tery dump in Area Al. The discovery of four pigeon bones in the fill of a Hellenistic colum- barium (L. 2336) combines with archaeozoolog- ical evidence from Maresha and Masada to help confirm the function of these structures. In the latter essay, L. Horwitz concludes that, in the Iron Age, the City of David "conforms to the expected patterning of a site involved in the primary pro- duction of food through hunting or herding," while in the Roman period the city shows a more "consumption oriented economy (perhaps a mar- ket system), with a higher frequency of animals exploited for meat but a generally narrower vari- ety of food sources" (p. 314). This addition to the City of David reports will prove itself a good resource on a variety of topics for some time to come. It is generally well written and free of errors. The delayed publi- cation of early submissions has not harmed them significantly. Though nearly half the articles were written between 1987 and 1990 (for exam- ple, chaps. 4, 6, 7, and 9; the discussion of figu- rines omits a reference to R. Kletter's recent, detailed study even though Kletter himself was among the authors of chap. 2), they remain ade- quately current and need little to no revision. In approaching their various subjects, many of the authors engaged in hands-on experiments to test the viability of certain theories (see, for example, the various experiments with weight variation among loom weights described on pp. 143-45 and 149). Such basic procedures not only help provide answers to questions raised throughout this book, but they remind us that low-technology procedures (for example, simple attempts to duplicate the actual ancient custom) as well as high-technology advances (such as computer generated statistical analyses of large databases; virtual reality language programs) can provide new insights into everyday problems. We may also reiterate that, time after time, these essays confirm the absolute necessity of tight stratigraphic controls in an excavation. Without such quality control in the field, a reliable inter- pretation of so much of what we discover (par- ticularly those facies that do not lend themselves to clear sequence dating) will remain somewhat hamstrung. Finally, we may note that the pre- ponderance of material covered on this volume derives from the late Iron II period, the eighth and seventh centuries B.C.E. The more meager database from the tenth and ninth centuries will undoubtedly continue to fuel the already heated debate over the interpretation of the Solomonic period as portrayed in the Hebrew Bible and the nature of its relationship to the archaeological record.
