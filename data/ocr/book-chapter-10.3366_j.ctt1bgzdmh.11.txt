(Plato  Timaeus 27b) ‘A feast of reason’ – cosmology in the Timaeus Anticipating ‘a complete and splendid banquet of discourse’, Socrates prompts  Timaeus to begin his narration about ‘the knowledge of the nature of the uni- verse’ after calling upon the gods, ‘as custom requires’ (27b).1 To launch the  ‘discourse about the universe’ with the epic convention of the invocation of the  gods places Timaeus’ description of the origin and the nature of the cosmos in  the realm of poetic invention – the realm of muthos.2 Timaeus explains that we cannot know the cause of the creation of the cosmos  with certainty and that his transmission is only a probable story (eikōs muthos,  29c–d). Why is the origin of the cosmos difficult to ascertain and the pattern on  which it is built unknowable? For Plato it is not because, as Heraclitus remarked,  ‘nature loves to hide itself’ (B123). If Plato contended that he had some privi- leged way of knowing the origin of the cosmos, he would be enlisted in the ranks   1 I am indebted to Richard Seaford for his insightful comments on this chapter  2 Cornford (1997: 31): ‘The Timaeus is a poem . . . There are two senses in which the  Timaeus is a myth or story (muthos, cf. Frutiger, Mythes de Platon, 173ff.): [in the first  place] no account of the material world can ever amount to an exact and self-consistent  statement of unchangeable truth. In the second place, the cosmology is cast in the form of a  cosmogony, a “story” of events spread out in time. Plato chooses to describe the universe,  not by taking it to pieces in an analysis, but by making it grow under our eyes.’ Since, as  Cornford states, for Plato, ‘To find reality you would do better to shut your eyes and think’,  we might say that Plato makes the universe grow in our minds.

In How Philosophers Saved Myths Luc Brisson elucidates Plato’s presentation  of Timaeus’ discourse as both eikōs muthos and eikōs logos as follows: ‘And this  is because the dialogue is a discourse on the constitution of the sensible world,  that is the “image” or “copy” of the intelligible world.’4 As Brisson notes, Plato  contrasts (29b3–c3) the true discourse and a credible discourse in terms of their  corresponding subjects, the model (paradeigma) and its copy (eikon). Timaeus’  discourse is a description of the physical world of becoming which cannot be  known with certainty. The starting point of Plato’s cosmology (27d–28a) is the distinction between  being (‘that which is always real and has no becoming’) comprehensible by  rational understanding and becoming (‘that which is becoming and is never real’)  perceived by the senses. The first question regarding the world (‘heaven or the  world – let us call it by whatever name which would be adequate for it’) is then: Has it always been or has it come to be, starting from some beginning? (28b)5 Clearly, the world has come to be ‘since it can be seen, touched and has a body  and all such things are sensible’. Desiring goodness, beauty and harmony Desiring that all things should be good, and, insofar as it is possible, nothing imper- fect, the dēmiourgos took all that is visible – not at rest, but in discordant and  unordered motion – and brought it from disorder to order since he judged that order  was in every way better. (30a) Desiring to make the best universe from a model, paradeigma, with the available  material in the ‘receptacle’ of the material, khōra, the dēmiourgos builds the   3 Einstein (1954: 262) writes in ‘Scientific Truth’: ‘Certain it is that a conviction, akin to  a religious feeling, of the rationality or intelligibility of the world lies behind all scien- tific work of higher order.’ Wittgenstein, in his construction of the logical universe in  the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, which opens with the resounding proclamation, ‘Die  Welt ist alles, was der Fall ist’ (The world is all that is the case), verges on mysticism  when it comes to cosmological considerations: ‘It is not how things are in the world that  is mystical, but that it exists. To view the world sub specie aeterni is to view it as a whole  – a limited whole. Feeling the world as a limited whole – it is this that is mystical’ (1995:  6.44–5).  4 Brisson 2004b: 28.

Johansen (2004: 54–5) explains that the description  of the sensible world shares the imperfections of the sensible world itself.  5 Citations from the Timaeus are adapted from Cornford 1997.

He makes one unique cosmos  and not multiple universes since a part is less complete compared to the whole  (31a–b, 33a–d).6 The true cause (aitia) of the coming to be of the cosmos is the desire of  the dēmiourgos that all things should be good, ‘insofar as it is possible’. This  qualification foreshadows another factor operating in the process of ordering the  pre-existing material. The generation of this world was a result of a mixed combination of necessity  (anangkē) and reason (nous). Nous overruled necessity persuading it to guide the  greatest part of things that become towards what is best. (48a) As Brisson and Meyerstein explain, ‘A cause, called anangkē, perpetually resists  the order the demiurge attempts to introduce in the world.’7 Anangkē is an ‘errant  cause’, a recalcitrant and an intractable feature of the khōra, within which ‘all  that is visible’ is found. From the contents of the receptacle the dēmiourgos  separates out four ‘kinds’, fire, air, water and earth. With triangles as the funda- mental units, he constructs regular solids as the figures for the primary elements  (53c–55c). The soul of the universe and the divine part of the individual soul are made  by the dēmiourgos. The world soul is made from a harmonically proportionate  combination of sameness, difference and being (35a–b). The compound of the  three constituents is divided in accordance with the interval of a musical scale  (harmonia).8 Being endowed with reason and harmony (36e–37a), the world  soul is a formal ordering principle of the constituents and the interconnected ele- ments of the universe. The dēmiourgos makes the immortal part of the individual  souls from the remaining material of the world soul ‘in somewhat the same way,  but less pure’. The mortal parts of individual souls, made by the gods (created by  the dēmiourgos) are prone to erratic and discordant motions (41d–42d). The con- ception of the psyche in the Timaeus as comprising the immortal part (reason)  and the mortal parts (appetitive and spirited) consolidates the tripartite view of  the soul in the Phaedrus, Republic and the Laws.9 The rational part of the individual soul must govern the two subordinate   6 Seaford (2004: 247–8) accentuates the self-sufficiency of the cosmos in ‘needing no other’  and being ‘a sufficient acquaintance and friend for itself’ (Tim. 33d).   7 Brisson and Meyerstein (1995: 23) point out that anangkē is usually translated as ‘neces- sity’ (‘constraint regarded as law prevailing through the material universe’), but this is  different from the way in which anangkē operates in the Timaeus.   8 See Cornford (1997: 60–7) on being, sameness and difference in the creation of the world  soul.   9 Robinson (1990: 105) compares the three parts of the soul in the Timaeus to reason, spirit  and appetite in the Republic (439a–441d).  SEAFORD PRINT.indd   73 16/06/2016   08:18 </page> <page sequence="4"> 74 Hyun Höchsmann parts of appetite and spirit and the body as the world soul governs the cosmos.  But if the world soul and the individual soul are not isomorphic, how can the  individual soul emulate the order-creating activity of the world soul? The con- gruence between the world soul and the individual soul is not structural since  the world soul has pure reason whereas the individual soul is a tripartite com- posite of reason, spirit and appetite.10 But there is a functional congruence: the  order-sustaining functions are the same in the world soul and in the individual  souls (90c–d). The world soul creates and sustains order within the cosmos, the  individual soul, by studying the harmonious order of the world soul, strives to  manifest order within itself.11 Cosmogony, ātman and brahman in the Ṛgveda and the Upaniṣads Then, in the beginning, from thought there evolved desire, which existed as the  primal seed. (RV 10.129.4)12 The universe comes into being as an activity of desire. Among the various cos- mogonic poems in the Ṛgveda and the Upaniṣads there is a common premise:  all things have originated from one primal cause. In one cosmogonic poem the  creation of the universe takes place through the sacrificial division of the body of  a primeval progenitor (puruṣa): the sun from the eye, the moon from the mind,  wind from the breath, sky from the head and earth from the feet (RV 10.90). The coming to be of the universe in the Ṛgveda and the Upaniṣads could  be characterised as ‘spontaneous order’ (self-organisation) in contrast to the  mathematical order in the Timaeus where the cosmos as a living organism comes  to be not as the result of matter’s internal self-organisation but by rational order  established from an external cause. However, similar to the conception of the  universe as a work of a craftsman in the Timaeus the universe is compared to a  work of a sculptor, a smith or a carpenter in the Ṛgveda (10.81). In the Ṛgveda  10 Cornford argues that there is ‘an irrational element in the World-Soul’ (1997: 176, 209–10):  The body of the world ‘contains motions and active powers which are not instituted by the  divine Reason and are perpetually producing undesirable results. Since all physical motion  has its ultimate source in a living soul, these bodily motions and powers can be attributed to  an irrational element in the World-Soul.’ Notwithstanding Cornford’s comprehensive and  penetrating analysis of the Timaeus, the obduracy of necessity in disorderly motion does  not entail imputing an irrational element in the world soul. As Cornford emphasises, since  disorderly motion, chaos, has existed prior to the creation of the world soul and reason can  mitigate ‘discordant and unordered motion’, by persuading necessity in ‘the greatest part  of things that become towards what is best’, persistence of disorder does not provide the  ground for the belief that the world soul is afflicted with an irrational component.  11 Cornford 1997: 354. 12 Translations of the Ṛgveda are adapted from Jamison and Brereton 2014. SEAFORD PRINT.indd   74 16/06/2016   08:18 </page> <page sequence="5"> Cosmology, psyche and ātman 75 (10.72) the gods are not at the very beginning but come into being subsequently  as in the Timaeus. The genealogies and prodigious deeds of various gods (Agni,  the fire god, Indra, the highest god, Varuna, the sky god, gods of the storm, and  other major gods) are celebrated with elaboration of ritual and sacrifice through- out the Ṛgveda (1.26, 1.85, 1.92, 2.12, 4.18, 5.85). There is a closer interaction  between the gods and the mortals than in the Timaeus as the gods are recipients  of offerings and sacrifices, dispensers of alleviation of calamities, and averters of  disasters who can be placated with entreaties. In a notable later poem in the Ṛgveda all pervious perspectives on cosmog- ony are abruptly called into question, bringing the uncertainty of knowledge  regarding the origin of the cosmos into the forefront: Who really knows? Who shall here proclaim it? – from where was it born, from  where this creation? The gods are on this side of the creation of this (world). So then who does know from  where it came to be? This creation – from where it came to be, if it was produced or if not – he who is the overseer of this (world) in the furthest heaven, he surely knows. Or if  he does not know . . . ? (RV 10.129.6–7) The uncertainty of the knowledge of the origin of the cosmos persists even with  recourse to the higher authority of the gods, since what is sought is the primal  cause before the gods came into existence. Inviting conjectures and disputations  (perhaps not excluding the possibility of a plurality of universes), the corre- spondence with the emphasis in the Timaeus that all investigations in cosmology  are provisional is significant: cosmogonic theses are speculative and incomplete  as cosmology is not a closed system. With a direct reference to the poets (sages,  kavi) who sought the connection between ‘the existent’ and the ‘non-e xistent’,  enquiry into the beginning of the universe is an open-ended investigation in the  realm of poetic insight. When regarded as a collection of cosmogonic verses,  Ṛgveda is also in the realm of muthos. While Timaeus’ discourse aims at alleviat- ing the uncertainty in presenting itself as an approximation meriting confidence,  the persistent questions, ‘Who? When? Where?’ in the Ṛgveda ignite a debate  regarding the origin of the universe. Continuing the enquiry into the origin of the universe, the Upaniṣads invoke  Prajāpati, ‘Lord of Creatures’ (BU 3.9.6). Desiring expansion, Prajāpati begins  to generate a variety of living beings from self-division. Again, desire is the  cause of partition from the initial unity (Prasna Upaniṣad 1.4). This primeval  desire as an impetus for the creation of the universe is distinct from the desire  of the dēmiourgos, ‘that all things should be good’. In the Upaniṣads it is not  the desire for goodness which provides the motivation for the creation of the  universe but a morally non-committal impulse for expansion. In the beginning  SEAFORD PRINT.indd   75 16/06/2016   08:18 </page> <page sequence="6"> 76 Hyun Höchsmann ātman in the shape of puruṣa (person) desired a companion and divided himself  into two (BU 1.4.1–3). Proceeding from this initial division the world and the  deities arise out of puruṣa (Aitareya Upaniṣad, 1–2). The origin of the universe  is not chaos but singularity. The universe comes into being from a process of  separation and multiplication from simplicity to complexity and from division  of one substance into the manifold of phenomena. Given this conception of the  unity of the origin of all things in the universe, the central thesis of the Upaniṣads  that the essential self (ātman) of each individual entity is identical with or  incorporated within the totality of all that exists (brahman) can be regarded as a  corollary (ChU 3.14.1–4; BU 2.5.19). The earliest mention of ātman is in the Ṛgveda (1.115.1; 1.162.20; 10.16.3;  10.33.9).13 Similar to the concept of psyche before Plato, ātman has a range of  meanings.14 Ātman is variously interpreted as breath, soul, essence, or the true  self which underlies all change. ‘Breath’ in the wider sense includes breathing,  thinking, speaking, seeing and hearing and is frequently equated with the life of  the individual self (BU 1.5 21).15 One pervasive meaning of ātman is ‘the ulti- mate essence of a human being’.16 Ātman is the common essence of all entities  underlying the multitude of diverse manifestations.17 As from the flames of fire, sparks fly out in every direction, so from this self (ātman)  the vital functions (prān· a) fly out to their separate places, and from the vital func- tions, the gods, and from the gods, the worlds. (KauU 4.19)18 Brahman also has a range of meanings as an epistemological and a met- aphysical concept, including ‘a formulation of truth’ or ‘ultimate and basic  essence of the cosmos’.19 In the Upaniṣads, two divergent perspectives on ātman  and brahman are presented: some texts emphasise that brahman is identical with  ātman while others consider that ātman is a part of brahman.20 What is the iden- tity or the constitutive relation which holds between ātman and brahman? Like  rivers flowing in different directions which merge into the ocean and become  one, individual souls are part of the ocean of one universal soul (ChU 6.10.1).  Brahman is ātman when embodied within a particular individual entity. 13 Deussen 1906: 86. 14 For expositions of psyche prior to Plato see Snell (1946).  15 Olivelle 2008: l. The significance of ātman as breath can be compared to psyche in Homer  as vital breath.  16 Olivelle 2008: lv.  17 Raju 1985: 26.  18 Translations of the Upaniṣads are adapted from Olivelle 2008. 19 Olivelle 2008: lvi. 20 Deussen 1966: 86–111, 182–212.

That is brahman! (TU, 3.1) When ātman (or brahman or puruṣa) enters into material bodies, the constituents  of individual bodies are separated parts of universal elements within the individ- ual embodiment. Tell me – when a man has died, his speech merges into fire, his breath into air, his  sight into the sun, his mind into the moon . . . his material body into the earth, his self  (ātman) into space, the hairs of his body into plants, the hair of his head into trees  and his blood into water – what then happens to that person? (BU 3. 2.13)21 Both the identification and the incorporation of ātman within brahman aim at a  comprehensive and fundamental principle underlying the multitude of phenom- ena.22 When it is identified with ātman, brahman comprises the aggregate of all  individual ātman and is coextensive with the totality of all that exists: Ātman is indeed brahman. It is also identified with the intellect, the mind and the  vital breath, with the eyes and ears, with earth, water, air and sky, with fire and with  what is other than fire, with desire and the absence of desire, with anger and the  absence of anger, with the righteous and the unrighteous; this self that is made of  everything. (BU 4.4.5)23 When the various applications of the concept of ātman are assembled, it can be  understood as the synthetic unity of the functions of reason, intellect and sense  perception. There are significant differences between the world soul and individual soul  on the one hand, and ātman and brahman on the other. Ātman and brahman are  not created, as the world soul and the individual souls are in the Timaeus. To the  extent that the individual souls in the Timaeus are neither identical with the total- ity of the constituents of the universe nor merge into the world soul, brahman is  not analogous to the world soul. Even if the three parts of the soul in the Timaeus  could be understood as forming a unity, this is distinct from ātman merging into  21 This is similar to the myth of creation of the primordial Titan, Pan Gu, in China, whose  body is transformed to the sun, the moon, the earth and the ocean. 22 Olivelle 2008: lv. Brereton (1990: 118) observes that: ‘Upanishadic teaching creates an  integrative vision, a view of the whole which draws together the separate elements of  the world and of human experience and compresses them into a single form. To one who  has this larger vision of things, the world . . . forms a totality with a distinct shape and  character.’ 23 Yeats (1975: 9) encapsulates the main thought of the Upaniṣads as follows: to ‘postulate  an individual self possessed of such power and knowledge [and] to identify it with the Self  without limitation and sorrow, containing and contained by all . . .’. SEAFORD PRINT.indd   77 16/06/2016   08:18 </page> <page sequence="8"> 78 Hyun Höchsmann brahman.24 However, brahman can be characterised as the soul of the universe,  as that which animates the universe. There are further differences between the Timaeus and the Upaniṣads regard- ing the goodness of the world. From readily observable phenomena questions  arise concerning the goodness and the order in the universe emphasised in the  Timaeus: What of the rampant and seemingly random evil in the world? More  frequently not nous but ‘the errant cause’ seems to hold sway. One possible view  of the problem of evil is developed in the Upaniṣads: the world is a battlefield of  the demonic and the divine.25 There were two kinds of descendants of Prajāpati, the devas (gods) and the asuras  (demons). The devas were the younger, the asuras were the elder, and they  contended  for the world. (BU 1.3.1) The divine, the demonic and the mortal all originate from one primordial being: The descendants of Prajāpati are of three kinds, the devas, men and the asuras who  lived as disciples with their father, Prajāpati. (BU 5.2.1) Prajāpati teaches the same to all: Prajāpati said ‘We must seek and aspire to know the self which is free from evil, old  age, death and sorrow, from hunger and thirst, and which desires and envisages what  it ought to desire and envisage. One who has sought and understands the self attains  all worlds and all desires.’ The devas and asuras both heard these words and said, ‘Well then, we will search  for the self (ātman) by which one attains all worlds and all desires.’ (ChU 8.7.1–2) The life and death struggle between the divine and the demonic for the posses- sion of the world and attainment of all desires ends with the victory of the gods. So long as Indra did not understand the self, the asuras (demons) conquered him.  When he understood it he conquered the asuras, obtaining pre-eminence among all  gods, supremacy and sovereignty over all beings. (KauU 4.20) In the Vedas and the Upaniṣads there is no explicit argument for the continued  existence of the created world as in the Timaeus, but from the eternity of brah- man the same implication might be drawn. The identification or incorporation of  ātman with brahman as the totality of all that exists would entail the existence of  one universe as in the Timaeus. However, in the absence of the goodness of the  24 According to Guthrie, ‘the three parts of the soul, when they reach the divine level, are not  merely in harmony but merge into one, namely nous’ (1962: 4:425). 25 In the Mahābhārata one hundred demonic sons are born from the beautiful Gandhari and  resort to treachery to overthrow the Pandavas, the five sons of gods.

The great oceans dry up; the mountains fall; the pole-star  strays; the wind ropes (holding the stars) are cut; the earth is submerged; the gods  depart from their place – In such a world of samsara (wandering back and forth) what good is it pursuing the  enjoyment of pleasures . . . (MaiU 1.4)26 The answer to this question is self-knowledge. Self-knowledge and the knowledge of the universe The moral and epistemological significance of self-knowledge or self-realisation  is pervasive in the Upaniṣads. The most fundamental thesis of the Upaniṣads is  that the true self, ātman or puruṣa (person) is the same as the self of the universe,  brahman (Isa Upaniṣad, 6–7; BU 2.5.19).27 Self-knowledge consists in recog- nising that the true self, ātman, is identical with the totality of reality, brahman,  and culminates in ‘bliss’.28 In the beginning this world was only brahman; therefore it knew even that the ātman  is brahman, therefore it became all. It is the same with the sages, the same with men.  Whoever knows the self as ‘I am brahman’, becomes this entire universe. Even  the gods cannot prevail against him, for he becomes their ātman. Now, if a man  worships another god, thinking: ‘He is one and I am another’, he does not know.  (BU 1.4.10) Cosmology is the prerequisite for self-knowledge and ethics in the Timaeus  and the Upaniṣads. The knowledge of psyche and ātman is inseparable from the  knowledge of the totality of existence and imbued with moral significance. The  knowledge of the true self within the framework of cosmology is metaphysical in  the Timaeus in so far as the dēmiourgos, the eternal model of the universe and the  forms are concerned. But it is also empirical, since the activity of psyche takes  place neither in solipsistic introspection nor is derived from a priori principles  but in relation to the order and harmony of the planetary movements correspond- ing to the laws of musical harmony. The activity of ātman encompasses all that  is encountered in existence. The precedence of the soul over the body in Plato and the priority of the  26 Translations of the Maitrāyaṇīya Upaniṣad are adapted from Roebuck 2014.

Carried along by the waves of the qualities, unsound, inconstant, disconnected, full  of desires, wavering, he falls into believing, ‘I am he, this is mine’; he binds himself  with himself, as a bird with a net . . . (MaiU 3. 2) Self-knowledge, the knowledge of the ātman as brahman, raises human beings  to the level of the gods. Whoever knows ‘I am brahman’ becomes the self, ātman, of all, including the gods.  (BU 1. 4.10) In the Upaniṣads full equivalence between divine and human reality is affirmed  by knowledge of the true self as brahman. In the Timaeus there is at most a par- allelism between the divine and the human existence. Even when a soul attains  goodness through reason and the result is eudaimonia, it is only an approxima- tion to the divine.31 As Pindar observed: Creature of a day – What is he? What is he not? Such is man – a shadow in a dream. The delight of mortals grows in a short time, and then it falls to the ground, shaken  by an adverse thought. But when the brilliance given by Zeus comes, a shining light is on man, and a  gentle lifetime.

The horses and drivers  of the gods are noble and good but those of other beings are mixed . . . the charioteer  29 Plato emphasises the priority of the soul also at Phaedo 79dff., Phaedrus 245dff. and Laws  896c (‘the soul is anterior to the body’). In the Laws the soul is the most divine and ‘most  his own self’ (726a) which governs all things (896dff.). See also Bostock 1986. 30 For early developments of the view that the self is soul in Hesiod, Pindar, Pythagoras,  Heraclitus and Empedocles, and that it may survive death, see Long 2015. 31 As reason is the divine element in man, in the activity of reason we can ascend to the level  of the gods, ‘becoming like a god (homoiosis theoi) insofar as it is possible’ for a mortal  (Theatetus 176a–b). 32 See also Magnone, Forte and Smith, and Schlieter in this volume.

So in our case the driving is of necessity troublesome and difficult . . .  The soul looks after all that is inanimate . . . When it is perfect and fully winged it  rises up and governs the whole world. But a soul which has lost its wing carries on  only until it gets hold of something solid and then settles down taking on an earthly  body . . . The whole now, soul and body fused, is called a living being with the epi- thet ‘mortal’. (Phdr. 246a–c)33 In the chariot metaphor of the Phaedrus the soul is not a static substance but an  activity, a dynamic process of its constituents. Psyche and ātman are likened to  a chariot both in Plato and in the Upaniṣads, signifying the conflicting forces  within the soul, which need to be harmonised. In the Timaeus, before the souls  are placed in the bodies, the dēmiourgos placed each in a star, ‘mounting them as  it were in chariots’ (41d–e). The star-chariot of the soul in Timaeus, the chariot of the soul in the Phaedrus  and the Kaṭha Upaniṣad illuminate the composite nature of psyche and ātman  and the unity and harmony in the soul as the goals of moral autonomy and  freedom. Know the self as riding in a chariot, and the body as the chariot. Know the intellect  as the charioteer, and the mind as the reins. The senses, they call the horses, and the  objects of the sense are the paths . . . [When] the self is unified with body, senses and  mind, the wise call him the ‘enjoyer’. (KaU 3.3–3.5) The emphasis on the intellect and its function has some points of similarity to  reason represented by the charioteer in the Phaedrus: only when the intellect  is the driver can the soul attain true understanding of itself as brahman (KaU  3.6–9).

But all allotted power divides us: man is nothing, but for the gods the bronze sky  endures as a secure home forever. Nevertheless, we bear some resemblance to the immortals, either in greatness of  mind or in nature, although we do not know, by day or by night, towards what goal  fortune has written that we should run. (Pindar Nemean Ode 6) Pindar’s view of man as having ‘some resemblance to the immortals, either in  greatness of mind or in nature’, is further developed in the Timaeus as the gulf  33 The tripartite structure of the soul is further developed in the Republic (435c, 550b, 580d– 581e): the ‘rational’ (logistikon), the ‘irrational’ or appetitive (alogiston or epithumetikon)  and the ‘spirited’ (thumoeides).

If a man perseveres in pursuing learning and wisdom he will certainly be led to  immortal and divine thoughts reaching truth and will attain immortality to the full  extent it is possible for human nature. (90b–c) Plato concludes the Timaeus with a resounding affirmation of the possibility for  achieving eudaimonia (happiness) for all those who strive to attend to the divine  part of the soul.34 Plato’s conception of the divine is not that of the soothsayers  or inspired poets but firmly grounded in the soul’s activity towards beauty and  goodness and the study of the natural phenomena, ‘the thoughts and revolutions  of the whole world’. The alignment of the activity of the psyche with the plane- tary movements revitalises its original state. The motions that have an affinity to the divine part in us are the thoughts and revolu- tions of the universe. These, therefore, are the ones that every one of us should follow.  We should redirect the revolutions in our head that were thrown off course at the time  of our birth by coming to learn the harmonies and the revolutions of the universe, and  bring the intelligent part, in accordance with its original nature, into alignment with  the objects of the intellect. We shall then attain the fulfillment of the best life set by  the gods before mankind for the present and for the time to come. (90c–d) The divine part in us is that which is conducive to the flourishing of the individ- ual in unison with the order, goodness and beauty of the universe.35 The individual soul is urged to aspire towards goodness by studying the  order and harmony of the cosmos.36 The soul contemplates the harmony of the  spheres, not turning inward but outward to the universe. In the contemplation of  the beauty of the universe the soul reflects the goodness of the universe, linking  the cosmological and the ethical. But it would seem that the goodness of the  dēmiourgos and the universe is not moral but aesthetic goodness and beauty  arising from the transformation of disorder (chaos or undifferentiated matter) to  34 The soul is divine and immortal and ascends to abide with the gods when it is freed from  bodily constraints (Phd. 80e–81a). 35 Einstein reinvigorates Plato’s insight on the interconnectedness of the individual and the  universe: ‘A human being is a part of the whole, called by us “the universe”, a part limited  in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings, as something sepa- rate from the rest – a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind  of prison for us restricting us to our personal decisions and to affection for a few persons  nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves by widening our circle of compassion to  embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty’ (Calaprice 2005: 206).  36 As Robinson (1990: 105) has pointed out, the goodness of order is emphasised in the  Gorgias (503–504d). Also in the Republic by creating order and harmony within, the soul  attains virtue (431d–e, 442c–d, 443c–444a).

However, to the extent that moral goodness can be conceived as the order  and harmony of the internal organisation of living beings which enables them to  flourish together, it could be brought about by the contemplation of the order and  harmony of planetary movements. The goodness of the dēmiourgos, cosmos and the world soul are a priori  and axiomatic. The dēmiourgos is good; the cosmos, being the work of a divine  craftsman, is good; and the world soul and the divine part of individual souls,  also the work of the dēmiourgos, are, therefore, good. The goodness of the indi- vidual soul is a posteriori and can only be achieved through continuous striving  after the pattern of ordered harmony exemplified in the planetary movements. By achieving immortality and attending to the divine element Plato means  the continuous search for knowledge and truth. In the Timaeus, a just soul  returns to its star, while an unjust soul is reincarnated (42a–d.). Being divine  and immortal, the rational part of the soul ascends to its star. Only nous is free  from the cycle of rebirth (42a–d); the appetitive and spirited parts are mortal.37  The activity and the resulting condition of the soul determine the body it will  occupy in rebirth: a well-ordered soul will be lodged in a higher form of life, the  disordered in a lower form. The central place of the transmigration of the soul in  Plato’s ethics is elucidated by Luc Brisson in ‘Myths in Plato’s Ethics’: Myths  have ‘a fundamental and permanent’ importance in revealing ‘the emergence  of a tendency to orient ethics towards physics . . . by resituating man within his  place on the scale of all living things’.38 The cosmogonic processes in Ṛgveda and the Upaniṣads seem morally and  aesthetically neutral: the world is not described as good or beautiful. Unlike in  the Timaeus, there is no motivation of the maker of the world to create a cosmos  bestowing on it beauty and goodness; there is no eternal model, a paradigm  of supreme goodness. However, an ethical conception of the cosmic order is  emphasised in the Ṛgveda, the Upaniṣads and in subsequent Indian cosmolo- gies.39 While the anthropomorphic conceptions of the process of creation in the  Ṛgveda and the Upaniṣads are distinct from the mathematical structures and the  ordered harmony of the cosmology in the Timaeus, both regard the universe as  a hierarchically organised and interrelated system in which order prevails. The  concept of ṛtá (order, truth, cosmic order or course of nature) in the Ṛgveda  can be compared to the concept of order in the Timaeus. Upheld by the gods,  Varuna and Mitra (RV 1.2.8; 4.5.4–9), ṛtá is pervasive. Agni, the god of fire, is  37 The customary view that only nous is free of the cycle of rebirth (for instance Guthrie 1971:  2:223–4) has been contested by Robinson 1990. 38 Brisson 2004a: 63. 39 Olivelle 2008: xlvii. ‘The ethicization of cosmic order evident in the Upaniṣads remains a  constant feature of later Indian cosmologies.’ SEAFORD PRINT.indd   83 16/06/2016   08:18 </page> <page sequence="14"> 84 Hyun Höchsmann ‘the guardian of ṛtá’ (RV 1.1.8; 1.77.5). Usias, the Dawn, does not depart from  ṛtá (RV 1.123.9). It might seem that ṛtá is similar to anangkē, necessity, in the  Timaeus because of its inexorability. But unlike necessity, ṛtá has a moral func- tion in sustaining world order. Cosmic and moral order are not inherent features  of the universe in the Vedic and the Upaniṣadic texts as they are in the Timaeus  but are maintained by gods. (Indra) lead us along the path of truth (ṛtá), across all difficult passages. (RV  10.133.6) Ṛtá is the truth and cosmic principle which ensures the functioning of the uni- verse. Conceived as the laws that sustain the continuity of the universe, ṛtá is  aligned with the moral laws governing the realm of actions and develops into the  concept of dharma (duty, justice, right action).40 Dharma is both cosmological  and ethical: it is that which sustains the world order and upholds justice, right  action and duty. Actions in accordance with dharma (in the sense of sacrifice, charity, study,  asceticism) lead to ‘the realm of the blessed’, but only the knowledge of brah- man leads to immortality. The one who abides in brahman achieves immortality. (ChU 2.23.1) As in the Timaeus, immortality must be achieved by attending to the divine  dimension. When the universe is divided into human beings, ancestors and  gods, those who follow the world of the ancestors will return to be reborn in this  world, while those who follow the world of gods will become immortal (BU  1.5.16; 6.2). This is partly analogous to the hierarchy of the gods and mortals  in the Timaeus and the prospect of mortals becoming like gods, in so far as it is  possible for mortals. Paralleling the rebirth of discordant souls in the Timaeus (42b–c), the cycle  of rebirth is also recurrent in the Vedic and the Upaniṣadic texts. The moral laws  governing rebirth are the same for psyche and ātman: those who perform good  actions are reborn in good circumstances and those who perform bad actions,  into the opposite (ChU 5.10.7). As a man acts, as he behaves, so he becomes. A man of good actions will become  good, a man of bad actions, bad. He becomes pure through pure actions, bad by bad  actions. (BU 4.4.5) ‘Thinking thoughts immortal and divine’ and endeavouring ‘to attain immortal- ity in the fullest extent which human nature is capable of’ (Tim. 90c), the soul  moves upwards (ChU 8.6.6): 40 For the evolution of the concepts of rita and dharma, see Horsch 1967, Hacker 1965, and  Jurewicz and Chaturvedi in this volume.

One of them penetrates the summit of the head. Moving upwards by it, a man reaches immortality. The others lead to departing in different directions – In different directions’ Epilogue: Convergent and divergent evolutions of ideas from the Timaeus,  Ṛgveda and the Upaniṣads to the cosmology of the present We still do not know one thousandth of one percent of what nature has revealed to  us. Whoever undertakes to set himself up as a judge of truth and knowledge is ship- wrecked by the laughter of the gods.41 These remarks regarding the difficulty of knowing the nature of the universe have  come down to us not from Greek or Indian philosophy but from Einstein. They  echo the perspective of cosmology as an open-ended enquiry in the Timaeus and  in the Ṛgveda. The metaphysical foundations as well as the mathematical and  empirical aspects of Platonic, Vedic and Upaniṣadic cosmology have been com- pared to current research in cosmology.42 The comparisons with science tend  41 Einstein 1954: 28. 42 In the later texts of Purana, the cycles of destruction and rebirth are attributed to the uni- verse. This aspect of cosmology in Indian thought has been compared to the current views  of cosmology by Carl Sagan (1980) and Firtjof Capra (1975). ‘Hindu religion is the only  one of the world’s great faiths dedicated to the idea that the Cosmos itself undergoes an  immense, indeed an infinite, number of deaths and rebirths. It is the only religion in which  the time scales correspond, to those of modern scientific cosmology. Its cycles run from  our ordinary day and night to a day and night of Brahmā, 8.64 billion years long. Longer  than the age of the Earth or the Sun and about half the time since the Big Bang. And there  are much longer time scales still’ (Sagan 1980: 213–14). In ‘Worlds on worlds are rolling  ever’, Shelley describes the cycle of creation and immortality: Worlds on worlds are rolling ever From creation to decay, Like the bubbles on a river Sparkling, bursting, borne away. But they are still immortal Who, through birth’s orient portal And death’s dark chasm hurrying to and fro, Clothe their unceasing flight In the brief dust and light Gathered around their chariots as they go; New shapes they still may weave . . .

Beginning with Heisenberg, the parallels between particle physics,  chemistry, cosmology and Plato’s ideas regarding the origin of the universe con- tinue to stimulate discussion.43 The philosophical impulse to seek unity among multiplicity permeating the  account of the creation of the universe in the Ṛgveda, the Upaniṣads and the  Timaeus continues to resonate in the present. Tracing the convergence and  the divergence in the evolution of the concepts of cosmos, psyche and ātman  aims at a reciprocal enhancement of our understanding of the continuing explo- ration of the nature of the cosmos and the soul which animate the universe. The  conceptions of the universe and of the nature of soul in Timaeus, Ṛgveda and the  Upaniṣads converge and overlap but do not coincide. The ethics of Timaeus and the Upaniṣads have a thematic and discursive  correspondence, laying the foundations for moral realism, the view that moral  values, principles and actions have objective validity beyond individual pref- erences, cultural norms, conventions or social institutions. The knowledge of  ātman and psyche prepares the ground for moral universalism and the autonomy  and responsibility of the individual. Subjectivism and relativism are regarded  as partial perspectives of the whole. Interpretive analyses of ātman and psyche  as the constant and enduring self throughout persistent change can enhance our  understanding of personal identity and continuity of consciousness.44 43 Heisenberg 1974. See also Brisson and Meyerstein 1995: 40–1. Machleidt (2005) explains  that, as Heisenberg recognised, the ideas of modern particle physics which regard geomet- ric symmetries as generating the particles from a few elementary components are close to  Plato’s views. Lloyd (2007) has emphasised the significance of Timaeus in symmetry anal- ysis in inorganic and physical chemistry. Plato’s questions in the Timaeus are still being  asked in contemporary cosmology: whether the universe had a beginning and whether it  has an external cause or is self-generated (Carroll 2010); whether the universe exists in  time and why the universe exists (Leggett 2010). 44 ‘Whatever the date, those forest Sages began everything; no fundamental problem of phi- losophy, nothing that has disturbed the schools to controversy escaped their notice’ (Yeats  1975: 11).
