Sorrentino Dipartimento di Ingegneria Industriale, Università degli Studi di Cassino Copyright © 2003 SAE International ABSTRACT The present work shows the comparison between a robotized filament winding cell equipped with a feed and deposition system able to wind asymmetric or complex parts by means of two rovings and the traditional cell able to wind only one roving. The comparison has taken into account the quality of the manufactured workpieces. The use of two rovings allows about to halve the winding time and, therefore, to reduce significantly the manufacturing costs. To compare the two cells many experiments have been carried out by changing the values of the process parameters through design of experiment (D.O.E.) techniques. The quality of the workpieces manufacture by the two cells has been evaluated and compared. INTRODUCTION A traditional filament winding system is composed of a winding die and a deposition arm: coordinating the relative motion of these two parts is possible to describe a 3D deposition trajectory of the roving on the winding die. The winding die rotation is combined with the translation of the deposition arm that occurs parallelly to the winding axis. The winding die looks like the part that has to be produced. The process involves the roving deposition, according to the planned robot trajectory, and its polymerisation, that may be accomplished in a furnace for thermoset resin matrix. This system is able to manufacture axial-symmetric parts. The winding process of axial-symmetric shapes occurs along geodetic trajectories that enable to reduce the side slippages of the roving during the deposition. The first attempt to wind complex, concave surfaces and in the 0° (axial) orientation, which is not possible with conventional filament winding, is represented by Hercules fiber placement machine that involves transporting prepreg tow material from a refrigerated creel through a ribbonizing delivery head [1]. The delivery head roller is in intimate contact with the part, which allows the material to be placed precisely on the part with almost zero tension. However, it allows to wind only rotational parts and parts constituted by surfaces achievable by the head. Hercules machine is programmed off-line using existing CAD/CAM tools [2]. Those tools are on mainframe and silicon graphics workstation, since they require a high amount of calculus. Robotized cells appeared in order to wind more and more complex asymmetric parts [3]. A robotized cell for filament winding technology is composed of an industrial robot opportunely equipped with a feed and deposition system. It enables to produce different shapes in a short time, thanks to its reprogramming. The robotized cell replaces the human operator representing the only system that was previously used to manufacture asymmetric parts. It was used to wind parts characterized by a double-concave shape, by means of a placement head in contact with the mandrel [4,5]. The limitations of this system are due to the length of the head in contact with the part, which makes the robot to perform large movements for a small change of orientation at the roller. The degrees of freedom of the robotic cell were increased by using a deposition head with 5 or 6 degrees of freedom and a die with more than one rotational degrees around its axis in order to avoid collisions or singularity positions or joint-angle limitations of the robot arm [6,7]. A two robots system, i.e. a mandrel manipulator and a payout tool carrier that are properly coordinated during the process of winding, was introduced by [8]. The parameters of the robotic winding cell (speed, fibre tension) were put into relationship with the accuracy of the manufactured simple asymmetric parts, such as tanks, high-pressure conduits, ogives for missiles and drive shafts [11-13]. The robot trajectory was planned off-line through a CAD/CAM software: different alternative software packages were proposed [14,15]. These software packages may deal only with simple geometry, such as cylinder or cone. However, all these studies consider parts with a rotational axis in order to test their approaches, such as T-shapes, and, therefore, they do not exploit completely the dexterity of the robot. Moreover, the further advantages of a robotized filament winding cell, such as process control and repeatability, appear not to be enough investigated. A robotized cell to manufacture composite parts characterised by complex shapes and high functional performances has been developed by Manufacturing Laboratory of Engineering Faculty in Cassino. It is constituted by a robot, a fixed support and a unique device including a fibre feed spool, a fibre tensioner and a deposition system [16,17]. It allows to control the process parameters, such as fibre tension, winding speed and fibre path [18,19]. Fibre tension influences composite compactness and, then, mechanical properties of composite part. In fact, higher is the tension value, higher is the pressure pushing winding fibre on the support or on the previous 331</page><page sequence="2">wound fibres. This pressure decreases the empty spaces among fibres and, then, it increases the quantity of fibres in a unit of volume. Larger is the quantity of fibres in a unit of volume, better are composite mechanical properties. Moreover, fibre tension improves the alignment of fibres inside the matrix. In fact, a fibre is oriented along an assigned direction during winding. If the applied tension is not enough, fibre may present folds along the deposition direction that cause defects in the composite part (i.e. marcel). At the same time fibre tension causes a stress to the fibre. The winding speed influences the movement accuracy of the deposition eye and, then, the robot accuracy to perform the planned path. The robot moves among points of the path: higher is movement speed, lower is movement accuracy and then lower is accuracy of fibres arrangement on winding die. Therefore, fibres result non-aligned along the direction of maximum stress. Fibre path determines the quality of composite part, i.e. the presence of empty spaces among fibres, of fibre bridging, of slippage tendency and of fibre torsion. A new robotized filament winding cell using two rovings has been developed to improve the performances of the cell [20]. The two rovings are unwound by two spools fixed to a creel and, then, they are conveyed towards the new feed and deposition system connected to the robot end-effector. The use of two rovings allows about to halve the winding time and, therefore, to reduce significantly the manufacturing costs. The present work shows a comparison between the cell able to wind asymmetric or complex parts by means of two rovings and the traditional cell able to wind only one roving. The quality of the composite workpieces has been taken into account. To compare the two cells many experiments have been carried out by changing the values of the process parameters through design of experiment (D.O.E.) techniques. A benchmark constituted by an irregular ring has been used. It is the part commonly used by an important aeronautic firm to test alternative technologies and systems to manufacture composite parts. Its shape, its dimensions and its composite material have been accurately chosen on the basis of accurate numerical analyses and destructive tensile tests. The new winding technique has proved to improve workpiece quality in all process conditions. In the following sections the cells for winding of one roving and two rovings are presented. Then, the parameters that have been used to characterize the quality of composite workpieces are discussed. Finally, the experimental approach is presented and the obtained results are deeply discussed. WINDING CELL WITH ONE ROVING The Manufacturing Laboratory of Engineering Faculty in Cassino, Italy, has developed a robotized filament winding cell that allows to produce composite complex shape parts characterised by high functional performances. It is constituted by a robot equipped with a feed-deposition head and a winding die [16,17], as shown in Figure 1. The feed- deposition head has a modular structure composed of 5 elements: the main frame, the back flange, the secondary frame (with the pertinent roving-guide system), the tension system (clutch group) and the end-effector (deposition system) [18,19], as shown in Figure 2. Figure 1. Robotized cell for one roving winding 332</page><page sequence="3">The new device has been designed and built on the basis of compactness, structural lightness, stiffness and functionality principles, in order to guarantee the maximum dexterity of the robotized cell and to improve the control of the process parameters. The compactness of the feed-deposition head increases considerably the robot dexterity, which is the motion range of the robot joints, and minimises the probability of crashes between the winding die and the components of the robotized cell. This requirement has been met by assembling in a unique structure the feed system, the fibre tensioner and the deposition head. The structural lightness of the feed- deposition head decreases the inertia moment acting against the movement of the robot joints. This aim has been achieved, either directly by minimizing the whole weight or indirectly by redesigning the head geometry. This aim has been carried out by acting on three variables: the device symmetry, the spool location and the material choice. The stiffness of the feed and deposition head influences the fibre locating on the mandrel and, therefore, the accuracy and the repeatability of winding, because it moderates the production of vibrations during sudden direction shifts. The head structure has been designed in order to have a high flexional stiffness along the two main stresses directions and to reduce the locating error. The new feed and deposition head has been designed in order to have an high flexibility. It has been adopted a modular structure in order to be easy to maintain and to upgrade in time. In figure 2 the main modules that form the feed and deposition head structure are shown. They can be summarised into three important subgroups: the main frame, the back flange and the deposition system. Figure 2. Feed-deposition head The main frame, forming the deposition head framework, is the structure on which are assembled the roving spool, proving the fiber to wind, the spool shift system, composed of the spool press and the tightening handle, the fiber tensioner, composed of the clutch group and the roving-guide system carrying directly the fibre to the deposition system. The back flange, enabling the connection to the robot end-effector, has been designed in order to interface with different robot kinds, such as cartesian or anthropomorphic, and with single-purpose machines. The deposition system can have different configurations, according to fibre geometry: round eye or pulley. All these properties allow the new feed and deposition device to control process parameters better than traditional deposition system. The winding die is mounted on a circular plate by means of a tie rod. The plate allows to mount the tie rod in different locations as required by the shape of the winding die. The length of the tie rod is reduced in order to avoid collisions during winding. WINDING CELL WITH TWO ROVINGS In order to improve the performances of filament winding cell, the Manufacturing Laboratory of Engineering Faculty in Cassino, Italy, has developed a winding cell for two rovings. The new cell is constituted by a creel, a robot and a winding die, as shown in Figure 3. Two rovings have been wound on a winding die by the new roving-guide and deposition system mounted on a cartesian robot. The robot has 3 degrees of freedom, a payload of 400 N, a work enveloped volume of 0.3 m3, a repeatability lower than 0.2 mm, an accuracy lower than 0.2 mm and a maximum speed along rectilinear path higher than 1000 mm/s. The robot has been opportunely equipped with a roving-guide and deposition system. The feed- deposition system has been obtained by adapting the head that was designed for one roving winding, briefly described in previous paragraph and more thoroughly reported in previous publications [18,19]. It has a main frame on which the back flange, enabling the connection to the robot end-effector, and the other modules of the guide-deposition head, i.e. the roving-guide system and the deposition system are assembled. The components related to the roving feed and tension have been removed thanks to the modular structure of the implemented device [19], and substituted the creel. Therefore, we have designed two spools on two independent axes that have two independent tension devices. Each spool has a clutch to tension the roving. The two spools move nearly along two parallel directions and converge directly on the upper pulley of the roving-guide system. This pulley is subjected to two coinciding tension directions that favour the overlapping of the two rovings and direct the resulting roving towards the second pulley of the roving-guide system. In this way the micro-slippages of the roving on the spool during unwinding are counterbalanced by the clutch that avoids a surplus of roving to unwind by the spool and, therefore, a tension loss before the overlapping on the pulley of the roving-guide system. 333</page><page sequence="4">Figure 3. Robotized cell for two rovings winding QUALITY OF COMPOSITE A composite material is univocally defined by the nature and the properties of its constituents, by the reinforcement geometry and distribution and by the characteristics of the reinforcement-matrix interface. The reinforcement geometry may be defined by a shape, a dimension, a concentration and an orientation inside the matrix. Different orientations and kinds of fibres carry out to different composite mechanical performances. The quality of products manufactured in composite material is connected with the presence of defects inside part volume or on its boundary surface. These defects are inevitable, since manufacturing process is very complex; they are due to the different manufacturing steps, such as winding, die closing and curing. To determine a composite part quality, some diagnostic techniques, called non-destructive tests, are used: they map defects distribution inside a part, at the end of the manufacturing process, allowing to define part acceptability. In aeronautic field, the attention is focused on the following defects: marcels , delaminations , porosity , wrinkles and pinchings. They are function of winding, die closing and curing processes. Once noticed the presence of defects inside a part, the part is not rejected, but it is classified on the basis of defects dimension and distribution. In this way parts are classified into a set of classes characterised by scores increasing (1-^-4) with decreasing of part functionality (increasing of defects presence). The scores under 3 value imply to accept the tested part. Therefore, these scores define how much critical is the part defectiveness. They were established on the basis of the experience ripened by manufacturing companies of composite parts. The scores scale was defined in conformity with the aeronautical certification standards; it is the result of a set of fatigue failure tests, measuring functionality changes, carried out on parts with known defects. Marcel is a fibre buckling that can occurs during winding. It is characterized by a shape ratio, G=L/R, where L and R are buckling length and height respectively (see Figure 4). Increasing buckling height and, therefore, worsening part defectiveness, involves decreasing G ratio value. It is possible to classify composite parts on the basis of G ratio. It is possible to obtain different classes characterised by scores increasing with increasing of part defectiveness (see Table 1). The maximum diameter of a circle inscribing marcel cross section has not to exceed 10 mm. X 7 Ļ _ Figure 4. Marcel cross-section 334</page><page sequence="5">Table 1. Scores scale of marcel Scores scale Shape ratio G=L/R 1 G&gt;3,7 2 2,5&lt;G&lt;3,7 3 2,1&lt;G&lt;2,5 4 G&lt;2,1 Delamination or debonding is due to the presence of empty spaces at the interface between fibres and matrix without fibre breaking. A part may present one or many empty spaces that are placed in parallel (called multiple delamination), as shown in Figure 5. A delamination is characterized by the length L and the width D of the area A concerning the empty spaces. If D may be neglected, the delamination is single, otherwise it is multiple. The number and the dimensions of the empty spaces, that render part acceptable, depend on the kind of manufactured part. For example, the benchmark used in aeronautic field and described in the following is considered acceptable if it presents a single longitudinal empty space whose maximum length "L" has a value of about 10mm, while its width D may be considered negligible, as shown in "single delamination" column of Table 2. These conditions correspond to score values less than 3. If the distance among empty spaces is less than 25mm, it has to consider these empty spaces as a single one. Multiple delaminations involve a part acceptable if the length and the width of the empty spaces are no more than 1 0 mm and 5 mm respectively (see column "Multiple delamination" in Table 2). Porosity is due to the presence of empty spaces inside part that are caused by a not enough compacting force of the fibres. To quantify this kind of defect is hard, it is based on the comparison of part radiography with a set of radiographic standards that take into account the empty spaces position more than their dimensions. In this way, parts are divided in classes characterised by scores increasing (1-^4) with increasing of porosity and, therefore, increasing of part defectiviness. A part with a score ranging inside l-s-3 is considered acceptable. Pinchings and wrinkles are defects placed on part boundary (see Figure 7). They are due to a wrong mating of the closed die on the winding die. Wrinkles are acceptable if they concern part boundary, while pinching are neglected, since they are removed through glass-paper. APPROACH TO COMPARE WINDING CELLS' PERFORMANCES In order to compare the performances of the cell that winds two rovings on a die with the traditional cell winding with one roving, some experimental tests have been carried out for different process conditions. It has been produced an irregular ring, shown in Figure 7, that is the part used by an important aeronautic firm to evaluate alternative composite technologies. Its shape, its dimensions and its composite material have been accurately chosen on the basis of accurate numerical analyses and destructive tensile tests. The resulting shape of the irregular ring guarantees, in presence of negligible damage, a 335 minimum value of the breaking strength, for the most critical section, equal to 1.5 kN/ mm2. This benchmark is characterised by all the winding problems of complex shape 3D parts that are widely spreading in industrial application and to which high functional performances are required, even if it has a simple shape. In the benchmark tests the main winding problems are stresses concentration and not enough compactness along curvilinear lines, buckling and tension loss along rectilinear lines, pinching and irregular boundaries at the interface among material and closed die. The benchmark is constituted by carbon roving 950-G30-500- 12K (roving type A, shape IV) impregnated by epoxy resin conformed to MIL-R-9300 requirements. Type A roving implies 125°C curing epoxy resin systems, while shape IV involves a slip tape consisting of 12 thousand (12K) filament- count tows. Polyacrilonite (PAN) precursor graphite fibres are used. Graphite fibres should conform to the AMS 3892/9 requirements, except for: 1. tensile modulus range: 220-248 GPa 2. minimum elongation: 1,4% 3. minimum tensile strength: 3400MPa Figure 5.

Irregular ring (dimensions in mm) The slip tape should have a 3.2±0.8mm width and a 0.76-î-0.85 g/m yield. This ring requires 56g of (pre-impregnated fibres) roving; so, 92-94 or 46-47 complete revolutions of about 0.61 g of material should be performed around the winding die for winding with one roving and two rovings respectively. The values of the winding parameters have been chosen on the basis of the experience ripening in aeronautic field; all the unsuccessful combinations have been avoided. The winding path has been considered as a fixed factor. Therefore, the path of the fibre, of the robot end-effector and of the robot joints have been accurately planned by means of the technique deeply discussed in [4]. The kinematics analysis has been processed respecting both the path geometrical rules previously described and the constraints connected with feed- deposition device and winding die shapes. The winding path has been translated in the minimum number of line segments allowing a continuous winding on the die with the imposed geometrical constraints. Once fibre and deposition pulley paths have been determined, robot joints trajectory has been obtained by means of inverse kinematics reasoning. The movement of the feed and deposition device has been simulated in terms of positions and orientations. The positions of robot axes during winding have been automatically defined [21]. Once determined the winding trajectories, the sequence to carry out the 92-94 or 46^-47 revolutions around the winding die for winding with one roving or two rovings respectively, in order to manufacture the designed shape, has been planned [22]. The winding speed and the fiber tension have been considered as variable parameters. The choice of the values of these parameters has been done in order to avoid all combinations that would have given ineffective results. Moreover, the values of the process parameter have been chosen in such a way to reproduce industrial manufacturing conditions, but even to overcome them by proving economic convenient combinations. Therefore, for each process parameters a value higher, and more demanding, than industrial one has been used. A set of experimental tests have been designed by means of a factorial experimental plan. The designed plan is given in Table 3. Each test has been replicated three times, yielding a total of 36 manufactured benchmarks. Once wound, the irregular rings have been closed between winding and closed dies. Then, they have been placed inside an autoclave to carry out the curing process. Curing conditions have used a heat up rate of 2-^-3 °C/min, a temperature of 125±3°C for a time of 90 min, a cool at 60°C. Finally, the benchmarks have been pulled out the die and they have been deburred and subjected to x-ray non destructive tests in order to identify the defects described in the previous section. Table 3. Experimental plan Process variables Number of levels Values Winding speed [mm/min] 2 3200-4800 Fiber tension [N] 3 50-70-90 Rovings number 2 1-2 öü ications 1 3 | Manufactured 36 benchmarks RESULTS ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION All the benchmarks have been wound halving the time required for one roving deposition adopting the same process conditions (about 18 min for 3200 mm/min and 11 min for 4800 mm/min). The quality of the benchmarks has been evaluated and puts into relationship with the adopted process parameters by a multifactor analysis of variance. The fundamental hypotheses of the ANOVA applicability to the experimental data (residual normality, homogeneity of residuals variance) have been tested. The number of rovings used for winding has shown to influence significantly the composite quality for every considered defects, together with the fiber tension and the winding speed; while the interactions between these three factors has not shown to influence part quality. Passing from one to two rovings used for winding causes an increase of marcel shape ratio G (see Figure 8) and a decrease of delamination maximum length L (see Figure 9). It involves a decrease of the workpiece quality score (see Figure 10) and, therefore, an increase of workpiece quality. The improvement in workpiece quality due to the use of 2 rovings instead of 1 roving arrives up to about 38% for marcel shape ratio and up to 60% for delamination maximum length (see Figure 11). This is probably due to the cluch mounted on each spool axis placed on the creel that counterbalances the micro- slippages of the roving on the spool during unwinding. Therefore, it avoids a surplus of roving to unwind by the spool and, therefore, a tension loss before the overlapping on the pulley of the roving-guide system. The multiple-disc mounted on the deposition head of the cell that winds only one roving does not allow to recover the surplus of rovings and, therefore, it controls less efficaciously the tension loss.

Part quality score as a function of fiber tension An increase of fiber tension causes an increase of marcel shape ratio G and a decrease of delamination maximum length L (see Figures 8-9) up to 70 N, while above 70N they show inverse trends. It involves a decrease of the workpiece quality score (see Figure 12) with a consequent increase of workpiece quality. The tension values of 70N and 90N seem to be the best choice. The quality increase connected with the tension increase is due to the improvement in fibers alignment and compactness. An increase of winding speed involves a decrease of marcel shape ratio G and an increase of delamination maximum length L (see Figures 8-9). This means an increase of the workpiece quality score (see Figure 13) with a consequent decrease of workpiece quality. All the values of the part quality scores monitoring the presence of marcels, delaminations and porosity are summarized in Figure 14. The scores due to two rovings are lower than those related to one roving, except for the first process condition. The process conditions 3, 5 and 6 belong to the range 1^-2, so all the corresponding benchmarks are considered acceptable by aeronautic industry and all the considered process conditions manufacture acceptable benchmarks. The process condition 4 manufactures benchmarks whose scores belong to the range 2-^-3 and, therefore, are not acceptable for aeronautic industry. The process condition 1 and 2 manufacture benchmarks with are critical for the presence of marcels. 337</page><page sequence="8">Figure 14. Part quality score as a function of process conditions CONCLUSIONS The winding of two rovings on a die has been compared in this work with the traditional winding of only one roving in order to manufacture composite parts. Two rovings winding allows to manufacture composite parts in about half of the time required by one roving winding. It involves an increase of marcel shape ratio of about 38% and a decrease of the delamination maximum length of about 60% with respect to one roving winding. This implies a decrease of the quality score monitoring the presence of marcels, delaminations and porosity that ranges from 1 to 2, so all the corresponding benchmarks are considered acceptable by aeronautic industry. The better quality level is probability due to the clutch mounted on the spool axis placed on the creel that is different from that used for one roving winding. The clutch mounted on each spool axis of the creel avoids a surplus of roving to unwind by the spool and, therefore, a tension loss before the overlapping on the pulley of the roving-guide system. The multiple-disc mounted on the deposition head of the cell that winds only one roving does not allow to recover the surplus of rovings and, therefore, it controls less efficaciously the tension loss. However, it is needed to take into account that the two rovings, once they have been unwound from the spools on the creel, are conveyed towards the roving guide system mounted on the robot end-effector. The two rovings may undergo torsions and frayings during the movement from the spool to the deposition head. The solution adopted in one roving winding avoids this problem, since the spool and the roving guide system belongs to the same equipment, that is called deposition head. In this last case the roving is unwound from the spool and conveyed directly towards the winding die without relative movement between the spool and the roving guide system.
