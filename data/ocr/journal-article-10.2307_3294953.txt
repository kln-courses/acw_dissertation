<plain_text><page sequence="1">LUCRETIUS' CARMEN DIGNUM L UCRETIUS, HAVING examined the discontent evident among his con- temporaries, concluded that men were frustrated and despairing because they lacked self-knowledge. 1 Their patent ig- norance led them to misinterpret the purpose of their existence to such an extent that they could not discharge ad- equately their duties as human beings. Lucretius proposed to offer a remedy based on Epicurean atomism, first by demonstrating the existence of natural laws which governed all created things,2 and then by showing how these laws applied specifically to human be- ings. When men had thus come to re- alize the true nature of the universe and their own position in it, they would un- derstand the meaning of human life and would be able to conform to the limita- tions imposed by their human nature. Lucretius chose to present his gospel of Epicureanism in poetry, and there- fore the De rerum natura is liable to examination on artistic as well as on philosophic grounds. A poet worthy of the name must have a message, and must select a poetic form suitable for the communication of his message. In both argument and structure the poem should be a satisfying whole, with a be- ginning, a middle, and an end. It is the task of the individual poet to work out his own techniques, so adapting them to his material that neither overshadows the other. This paper will attempt to as- sess the artistic achievement of Lucre- tius in producing a work obeying these demands. One of the chief technical problems confronting Lucretius was the reconcili- ation of the expository methods of the philosopher and the poet. Philosophy is a study of universals, which can have little meaning for the average mind un- less they are explained in terms of ev- eryday experience. Since the human brain comprehends the concrete with more ease than the abstract, a success- ful teacher of philosophy makes con- stant use of comparisons which enable the student to understand the unknown by relating it to the known. Similarly the poet, by a skilful mastery of lan- guage, transmits his message through imagery requiring an act of comparison on the part of the reader. In Lucretius the poetic method, happily, could be identified with the philosophic; he was thus able to bridge the apparent gap between the two. The philosopher ap- peals primarily to the intellectual facul-</page><page sequence="2">146 ELIZABETH M. MCLEOD ties of his audience, whereas the poet appeals primarily to the emotional and imaginative faculties. Lucretius, poet- philosopher, applies doubly the tech- nique of revelation by means of paral- lels between the known and the unknown; he simultaneously captures the emotions, the imagination and the intellect of his readers. Epicureanism assumes that every- thing, from the soul of man to the world itself, is created in the same way and will be destroyed by the same causes.4 Creation takes place by a fortuitous clash of suitable atoms as they hurtle through the void.-5 Destruction takes place by a dissolution of the atomic compound.6 Creation and destruction, birth and death, are set at opposite ends of the scale; but they are also linked, because the latter is the prereq- uisite of the former.7 Existence for all created things depends on the balance between the twin forces of creation and destruction, and nature effects this equilibrium through the inevitability of the birth-life-death cycle. 8 Man, being only one of many created beings on earth, is also subject to this cycle, and therefore the nature of man can be re- vealed by equating the laws governing human behavior with those governing the everyday phenomena in the sur- rounding world. Because Epicureanism insisted on a common pattern of existence for all cre- ated things, and furthermore consid- ered the senses to be the chief criterion of truth and the gateway to all knowl- edge," it was ideally suited to a method of exposition which incorporated figures of comparison, so that the unknown could be explained in terms of the known. It will be recalled that much of Lucretius' argument depends on the lit- erary devices of simile, metaphor, and allegory, and on the philosophic device of analogy. All four operate by estab- lishing parallels between two things, one of which is familiar, the other less so. A brief examination of the figures of comparison in the De rerum natura will provide a review of Lucretius' exposi- tory technique, and at the same time should shed some light on his poem, not only in its individual parts, but also as a whole.10 Simile is "a comparison of one thing with another, especially as an ornament in poetry or rhetoric.""' Lucretian sim- iles adhering to this definition are rare.12 They appear chiefly in passages which most reflect conscious artistry, as in the proems. They either illustrate ideas which Lucretius takes to be self- evident facts requiring no further proof or, occasionally, add poetic decoration to a previously proven point without adding anything to the current argu- ment. An example of the former use is the simile explaining Lucretius' adop- tion of poetry as a medium for the prop- agation of Epicureanism: just as the rim of a cup of medicine is smeared with honey so that children will be lured to drink the contents without perceiv- ing the unpleasant taste, so Epicure- anism is to be expounded in verse in order that the reader may pleasurably absorb its moral benefits.' An exam- ple of the latter use occurs in the ex- planation of the processes of change in nature: as the runner in a relay race passes on his torch to another when he has completed his appointed course, so the death of one thing leads to the birth of another.14 Analogy is properly a term of logic, a "resemblance of relations or attributes as a ground of reasoning. Presumptive reasoning based on the assumption that if things have some similar attributes, they will have other similar attri- butes;"s5 or more simply, a process of "reasoning from parallel cases."'1 In a world not blessed with laboratories and modern research techniques, analogy was a trusted method of explaining the</page><page sequence="3">LUCRETIUS' carmen dignum 147 workings of natural science.17 There is a very great number of analogies in the De rerum natura; when one con- siders the didactic nature of the poem this is to be expected.18 Some of Lu- cretius' analogies take the form of sim- iles; but there is a distinction between his use of true similes and his use of analogies. Whereas simile is a poetic device, used for illustrative rather than explanatory purposes, Lucretian anal- ogy serves primarily to present evi- dence which will reinforce and illumi- nate philosophic doctrines.i Because these analogies are produced by a poet, they naturally exhibit poetic qualities. But they are never merely descriptive; they are always used as proofs to es- tablish the argument at hand. Both the extremely large and the extremely small are brought into human compre- hension by the insertion of analogies, so skilfully introduced into the argument that they seem to arise naturally from it. For example, in Book 2 the doctrine of the constant motion of atoms is enun- ciated. The Epicurean explanation is that atoms move by reason of their own weight; when they strike against one another they may be deflected in other directions, and this in turn produces more motion. When suitable atoms meet, creation can take place. Then the analogy is presented, bringing convic- tion to a theory based on invisible fac- tors by an appeal to a concrete and familiar parallel. The reader is invited to consider motes in a ray of sunshine, where particles of dust are seen to ex- hibit the characteristics of motion pos- tulated for atoms (2.80-141). Lucretius' application of the Epicu- rean doctrine of isonomia is an exten- sion of his use of analogy. For example, if one accepts the existence of one's own world, where there may be seen many members of different classes of things, and if one places beside this ob- servation the Epicurean doctrine of the infinity of the universe and of nature's powers to create and destroy for an in- finite time, one is bound to conclude that there is no reason why other worlds besides one's own should not exist.20 The process of "reasoning from parallel cases" is here employed to lay bare the secrets outside the known world, as it is employed elsewhere to lay bare the secrets hidden from human perception within the known world. dumtaxat rerum magnarum parva potest res exemplare dare et vestigia notitiai (2.123-4). Inasmuch as everything is created in the same way, that which is true of classes of things within human experi- ence should be equally true of other things beyond human experience. Metaphor is "the figure of speech in which a name or a descriptive term is transferred to some object to which it is not properly applicable."21 It is the common property of all poets. Meta- phor above all else facilitates Lucre- tius' constant identification of the physi- cal and the mental, the emotional and the moral. Thus he calls love "a flame" (4.1087), ignorance "darkness" (2.59; 6.39; etc.), and knowledge "light" (1.144; 3.1; etc.). Metaphor also in- cludes the device of personification; this enables Lucretius to draw upon the life cycles of human beings to clarify his rational explanation of the processes of creation. 22 These scanty examples scarcely hint at the wealth of metaphor- ical language pervading nearly every line of the poem. Metaphor imparts a vividness which makes Lucretius' dic- tion, and therefore his thought, more accessible to his audience. Allegory is the "description of a subject under the guise of some other subject of aptly suggestive resem- blance,"23 or "a figurative representa- tion carrying a meaning other than, and</page><page sequence="4">148 ELIZABETH M. MCLEOD in addition to, the literal."24 The force of some Lucretian allegories is grasped immediately, per se; some the author explains. Quintilian thoughtfully pro- vides an example of the first type in his definition of allegory.25 An example of the second type is Lucretius' treatment of the myths of Tartarus. Their alle- gorical application is intended to re- move the specter of a life after death, and to show that man subjects himself in life to those very tortures he thinks to be reserved for the life hereafter. The sinners of Tartarus who undergo physical suffering personify the living man who undergoes mental suffering fostered by his perennial inability to adapt himself to the requirements of his own nature.26 The exigencies of Lucretius' material, combined with his gifts as a poet, pro- duce a constant succession of explicit figures of comparison; these demon- strate the pictorial nature of his thought patterns, and his faculty of instinctively associating an abstract idea with some- thing concrete. The implications, how- ever, of some of his more extended images are not always immediately ap- parent, but become clear only gradu- ally as the reader progresses. The classic illustration of this is the proem to Book 1, the force of which cannot possibly be grasped until much further on.27 Since Lucretius depends on the technique of gradual enlightenment in so important a passage as his introduc- tion, it is surely legitimate to approach the rest of his work with the conscious- ness that this technique may be repeat- ed. The impact of the whole poem cannot be judged fairly until the last line has been read and the processes of gradual revelation have been allowed to work themselves out. namque alid ex alio clarescet nec tibi caeca nox iter eripiet quin ultima naturai pervideas: ita res accendent lumina rebus (1.1115-7). The poem opens with an allegorical introduction to the physical and ethical discussion which forms the subject mat- ter of the whole work. The dominating image is that of Venus, who as the symbol of productive calm presides over creativity on the physical, mental and moral levels. These are dealt with in order of ascending importance. The first part of the allegory is de- voted to the physically creative aspects of nature, personified as Venus genetrix (1.1-20). The request that Venus be Lu- cretius' ally in the composition of the De rerum natura refers specifically to the physical and moral calm necessary for mental creativity, and provides a smooth transition to the second part of the allegory, which is primarily moral and ethical in its implications (1.21-8; cf. 1.136-45). Here Venus hominum divumque voluptas is the personifica- tion of that peace of mind of which the gods are men's models and which means the fulfilment of the truly happy life (1.29-49). It must be remembered that Lucretius' way of thought depends on the merging of the physical, the emotional, the intellectual and the mor- al, and that his images cannot be limit- ed by any one interpretation.28 Mars is the symbol of destruction which can disrupt productive calm and hinder all types of creativity. Perhaps the de- scription of Mars in the arms of Venus may be taken to suggest the balance between the forces of creation and de- struction, which is synonymous with life itself. Man can be destroyed mor- ally by wrong goals and ambitions due to the misunderstanding of human na- ture and its demands.2' Therefore Mars may represent the wrong goals of mankind; and Lucretius may be in- dicating allegorically how man may reshape his goals in the atmosphere of productive calm symbolized by the figure of Venus. This alone will permit him to attain to the heights of Epi-</page><page sequence="5">LUCRETIUS' carmen dignum 149 curean ataraxia.3o If Venus as the "re- formed" Epicurean godhead31 be taken in conjunction with the description of the gods which follows the proem prop- er, there is evident at the outset of Lu- cretius' work a contrast between the happy life of the gods and the unsatis- factory life of men. This contrast ap- pears throughout the poem, holding up the ideal to the actual. In Book 5 there is a particularly compelling analysis of man's disorders which are the exact opposite of the peace of the gods de- picted in the opening lines of the poem: ergo hominum genus incassum frustraque laborat semper et &lt;in&gt; curis consumit inanibus aevum, nimirum quia non cognovit quae sit habendi finis et omnino quoad crescat vera voluptas. idque minutatim vitam provexit in altum et belli magnos commovit funditus aestus (5.1430-5). This is a needless waste. There is noth- ing to prevent man from achieving the ideal peace of the gods (3.322). Epi- curus apparently did so; other Epicure- ans may do so.32 The proem to Book 1 holds out the promise of salvation, which as the poem progresses is trans- formed into a workable philosophy of life. The other books as well are intro- duced by proems with moral overtones intended to show the reader the bene- fits he may expect to derive from his study of Epicureanism. The evil influ- ences exerted by the enemies of human happiness are frequently recalled, and the proems and the so-called "digres- sions"33 form an integral part of the poem because they preserve the proper perspective and prevent the reader from forgetting the primary purpose of Lucretius' undertaking. Each book is concluded by an illustra- tive passage producing an effect of gloom and often of disintegration and death which balance the optimism of the proems.34 These pessimistic epi- logues, far from being unconscious re- flections of Lucretius' mental imbal- ance, are consciously placed by him in their prominent position for their effectiveness. For as well as the fig- ures of comparison, Lucretius makes liberal use of example to drive home individual Epicurean principles. Thus, to explain the term properties he states that weight is a property of rock, heat of fire, moisture of water, touch of all bodies, and intangibility of void.35 The descriptive passages at the ends of the books operate similarly. Their emo- tional impact on the reader supple- ments the more intellectual arguments in the body of the books; and they round off the content of each book so that a fresh start may be made in the succeeding book.36 Book 1, which is de- voted to a statement of the first prin- ciples of atoms and void, and to the demolition of rival doctrines in prepa- ration for the dissemination of Epicure- anism, concludes with a passage fore- shadowing the physical destruction of the world, and in this it balances the theme of physical creation in the open- ing part of the Venus allegory. Al- though the passage apparently rises out of a refutation of opposing philosophical views, the final impression is certainly one of decay.37 Book 2 continues the discussion of creative principles and the necessary decay, and concludes with an example of the earth's physi- cal decay which is even now evident, as the aged farmers discover.38 Books 3 and 4 conclude with examples show- ing the results of wrong thinking and wrong goals on the moral being of an individual. If the reader is so foolhardy as to defy the rules of life outlined in the earlier portions of these two books, he has only to turn to their conclusions to see what he may expect in his own future. In Book 3, in which Lucretius demonstrates the true nature of death</page><page sequence="6">150 ELIZABETH M. MCLEOD by analyzing the material character of the soul, the last sections constitute a diatribe against the folly of the fear of death. The conclusion reiterates the futility of craving life and shows the be- wilderment of the man who wastes his life because he cannot find happiness in the shadow of a death whose nature he does not understand (3.1053-94). Book 4 deals with human psychology and physiology, and concludes with an extended passage on love, which is an example of the results of the overindul- gence of one appetite, and suggests parallel degradation if other appetites be overindulged.39 Book 5 discusses the creation of the world and the de- velopment of the human race, and the concluding sections hint at the moral degeneration accompanying the mate- rial progress of civilization.40 Book 6 discusses certain phenomena which had wrongly instilled in men supersti- tious fears of the gods and false fears about destruction; after revealing the true causes, it concludes with a pas- sage illustrating human destruction and degeneration both morally and physi- cally (6.1138-1286); thus it recapitu- lates the two themes of moral and physical being from the proem to Book 1. The description of the plague at Athens follows inevitably both from the course of its own book and from the course of the whole poem.41 The dis- cussion of the atmospheric and terres- trial phenomena, which occupies the earlier portion of Book 6, is gradually intensified in its tone of destruction, so that the note of death which has hov- ered in the background throughout most of the work is brought more and more into the foreground, but now with a feeling of finality rather than a view of death as the prerequisite of birth. All the processes of decay and destruction are shown to be a part of the processes of nature. All atoms cannot mingle healthfully with all atomic compounds, and the parallel is drawn between the diseases of earth and the diseases of men, just as formerly the parallel was drawn between the creation of earth and the creation of men. The tone of gloom is slightly relieved before the cli- max. The discussion of pestilential lakes would naturally inspire Lucretius' active imagination to examine other pe- culiar bodies of water in the light of atomic theory. This is followed by the discussion of the magnet, chosen partly because it is a strange and fascinating thing which is proven to obey the laws of nature in spite of its baffling behav- ior, but also because in explaining it Lucretius can seize the opportunity to provide a final review of the mechanics of atomism, the starting point of the Epicurean system. 4 2 Because death and decay are shown to be a natural process, and not a di- vine visitation, the plague is the deci- sive argument against the existence of malevolent deities. The pitiable pic- tures of human physical destruction evoke a highly emotional response. But the moral degeneration is even more serious because it reveals the unwilling- ness of mankind to accept the rules which define the limits of human life. Men clung to life because of their need- less fear of death, and, refusing to rec- ognize that their appointed time had come, they betrayed their nearest and dearest in a fruitless cause, for the plague claimed both the good and the bad (6.1239-46). Any accumulated riches provided their possessors with no more security than could be enjoyed by their less fortunate neighbors. The poem closes with the wretched Athenians wrangling over the pyres of their dead, the victims simultaneously of spiritual and physical defeat and disintegration. The final impact of the plague is the in- evitability of death for all created things.43</page><page sequence="7">LUCRETIUS' carmen dignum 151 The structure of the preceding books prepares the reader for this ending. Each book shifts from a tone of fresh- ness and of an invitation to make the most of life in the proem to an insist- ence on degeneration and decay and gloom in its conclusion. The six books fall into three groups. In Books 1 and 2 physical creation is discussed; in Books 3 and 4 the state of being as it affects mankind; in Books 5 and 6 the gradual downward path to moral and physical destruction. Thus the tone of the poem itself moves from the hymn of creation at the beginning to the picture of utter desolation at the end; within the poem the same process takes place on a lesser scale in the individual books. The De rerum natura is itself the embodi- ment of the birth-life-death cycle, and reflects the processes of nature herself for any created being. According to Lucretius, the chief ob- stacle to human happiness was a per- niciously false religio which confined men's mental and spiritual faculties to such an extent that it completely pre- vented them from achieving that self- knowledge which permits peace of mind. This binding power instilled ir- rational fears of divine intervention in the affairs of men both during their lives and afterwards, and a dread of death itself.44 Fear of the gods and fear of death are often coupled in a dis- cussion of the De rerum natura, and yet these two fears are of a very differ- ent nature and therefore require a dif- ferent approach if they are to be suc- cessfully routed. Fear of the gods is not an inborn characteristic of the human race, as is the fear of death. The exist- ence of controlling gods was early man's rational explanation of occur- rences which he could not understand. 4 5 Because it was engendered by his help- less feeling that he was not after all master of his own environment, emo- tions entered into his attitude towards his gods; but these emotions were of the sort naturally inspired by the con- templation of a controlling power. Lu- cretius simply substituted the Epicu- rean explanation of the operations of the atoms for the operation of the gods, and thereby automatically stripped the traditional deities of their long-standing powers. Every argument for the exist- ence and the operations of atoms is a blow to the pantheon. Because belief in the gods had an intellectual foundation, it could be refuted on intellectual grounds. The enlightened Epicurean view of the true functions of the gods reveals them as a source of inspiration to men, not the cause of their downfall. The tendency to put fear of the gods and fear of death on an equal footing is probably partly responsible for some of the scholarly discontent with the pres- ent text of the poem. Several men of learning, depressed by the conclusion and misinterpreting Lucretius' artistic purpose, have sought to demonstrate that the poem as we have it is incom- plete, and have accordingly suggested more soothing endings. It should be noted that Lucretius himself states that Book 6 is to be the last (6.92-5). There is no valid reason to doubt his inten- tion.46 Another book is not to be en- visaged, although Lucretius' statement need not preclude an addition to Book 6 itself. The popular candidate for this hypo- thetical conclusion is a passage devoted to the gods.47 Such a conclusion, it is claimed, would fulfill the promise in Book 5 to discuss the Epicurean deities in more detail (5.155). Largo sermone, however, need not mean a prolonged and uninterrupted discourse; it may re- fer to several shorter passages, in- serted as the occasion presents itself. The information regarding the gods, which is scattered throughout the poem, should be enough to satisfy the average man.48 It was the policy of Lucretius to</page><page sequence="8">152 ELIZABETH M. MCLEOD select only those points of Epicurean- ism relevant to his task of showing his fellow men the basic requirements of the good life. It was not his purpose to expound all the more intricate and ad- vanced doctrines suggested by the ex- tant Epicurean corpus. Such teachings might well contribute to the intellectual joys of the more advanced student, but were hardly useful for the common man or for the novice.49 The theory that Books 1, 2 and 5 were written before Books 3, 4 and 6 makes this position even more attractive be- cause all the chief observations on the gods appear in Books 5, 3 and 6.50 The only legitimate criticism could be that Lucretius failed to delete the rather misleading lines in Book 5 when he as- signed the book to its present position. He says enough to remove the fear of the intervention of the gods in the af- fairs of men, and this is his only con- cern with them. To conclude a poem written specifically for man with a su- perfluous passage on divine beings would be inharmonious artistically, philosophically, and pedagogically. If man is to be self-sufficient, and is to fulfill his function as a human being, in pursuit of the happy life in his al- lotted span of time, he must be free not only from fear of divine intervention in the world, but also from fear of death. Of these two intimidating fears, the latter is surely the more formidable, because death is such a mysteriously personal thing. Proof of the mortality of the soul and of the non-existence of ma- licious deities could remove on intellec- tual grounds the fear of pain and torture after death.51 But there is an innate dread of change in the human make-up - a tendency to maintain the status quo and a reluctance to venture into the unknown. Because of their in- stinctive craving for immortality, men hope or fear that some part of them will survive.52 They insist on casting their minds towards the possibilities of the future, and therefore live in a state of uncertainty which spoils the present for them.5 3 Epicureanism could offer no substitution for the fact of death as it could for the fancy of the gods. Lucre- tius was a fine student of human psy- chology, and he realized that the re- moval of the fear of all that death involves requires more than sheer logic. Death presents an emotional problem which is probably insurmountable for Epicureanism, because human beings cringe at the idea of complete annihila- tion of personality. The assurance that death is like a deep and dreamless sleep is after all a very empty consola- tion.54 Nevertheless, Lucretius tried valiantly and honestly to meet the prob- lem, both by marshalling his intellec- tual and logical arguments and by at- tempting to provide for the human emotional reaction. As every proof sub- mitted for the operations of the atoms is a refutation of divine control, so every proof at the same time leads up to the understanding of human death. The latter part of Book 3 is one of the emotional peaks of the poem. 55 The de- scription of the plague at the end of Book 6 is an even more important emo- tional peak. It is Lucretius' final appeal to his readers' sensibilities. For if they refuse to accept the Epicurean explana- tion of the fact of inescapable death with every fiber of their being, all the preparation and instruction for achiev- ing human happiness, so painstakingly presented in the body of the poem, will go for nought.56 The hopes and fears of the immortality fostered by false re- ligion will still prevail. Man will con- tinue to dread death, and his life will be so distorted that ataraxia can never be a part of it. Inasmuch as the poem is directed not towards reconciling the insensate world to its natural end, nor even to expounding physical theory for its own</page><page sequence="9">LUCRETIUS' carmen dignum 153 sake, but towards reconciling men to the implications of their own mortality, the ending is as appropriate as it is powerful. 57 Lucretius has used the striking picture of human death to stand in place of a more impersonal de- struction which his reader might fail to associate with himself; 5 8 this was a chance which our author could not afford to take. Nature, to Lucretius, implies the ceaseless and ordered processes of both creation and destruc- tion.59 The poem is about nature as it affects mankind. Venus and the plague play a part in the life of every man. The symbol of the plague artistically balances the picture of Venus, and completes one cycle of life. The poem as it stands has a begin- ning, a middle, and an end, which show the processes of creation, the processes of being, and the processes of destruc- tion, all going on simultaneously as a mirror of existence.60 The poem is bal- anced in content and structure as nature herself is shown to be balanced in her workings.61 Few would deny that spe- cific lines and passages would have been the better for a final polishing at the hand of the author. The form of the poem is in some measure due to the material. But the persuasive arrange- ment of this material is due to the skill of an artist who is consistent in his approach and inspired in his per- formance. It is impossible to ignore the movements from creation to de- struction throughout the poem. Death is the inescapable sequel of birth. "Poetry reduces life . . . to a certain rhythmical or harmonical pattern."62 It was precisely because man refused to acknowledge the rhythmical pattern of life that he was unable to live wisely and happily. In the De rerum natura Lucretius unfolds the rhythmically poetic expression of Epicurean life. He has indeed answered his own rhetorical question: quis potis est dignum pollenti pectore car- men condere pro rerum maiestate hisque repertis (5.1-2)? The De rerum natura is a parable of life. Creation occurs when atoms meet. Destruction occurs when atoms part. The poem keeps pace with the atoms, and it ends as abruptly as life itself departs. ELIZABETH M.

The rules of the rhetori- cians were formulated after certain techniques had been found servicable, and not vice versa. (Lucretius would approve this, cf. 4.823ff.) The rules are not the sole property of the orators and rhetoricians, but have a place in any kind of teaching or persuading. E. K. Rand has demon- strated ("La composition rhetorique du troisisme livre de Lucr~ce," RPh 8[19341243-266) that the De rerum natura obeys the rules of the rhetori- cians, but if one considers the nature of Lucretius' task this is not really surprising. 11 Shorter Oxford dictionary (Oxford 1933).

Analogies compare the effects or processes of things rather than the things themselves. The use of analogy tends to increase from Book 1 to Book 6. The reason for this is Lucretius' discrimination in choosing the most persuasive method of convincing his audience. In Book 1 he is establishing the exist- ence of atoms and void and is refuting opposing philosophical tenets. Here he depends mainly on argument by the reductio ad absurdum and on example. The other books contain the applications of the basic principles laid down in Book 1, and to explain these applications Lucretius compares the effects of perceptible phenomena to the in- ferred effects of the atoms moving in void. The more securely Lucretius feels he has demonstrated his basic principles, the more freely can he branch out into analogy. 19 Cf. R. V. Schoder, CJ 45(1949-50)128-9. R. C. Hohler ("Lucretius' use of the simile," CJ 21[1925- 6]281-5) has many penetrating observations on Lucretian imagery, but seems to confuse simile with analogy. 20 Infinite number of each shape, 2.522-68; in- finity of the universe and of matter, 1.958-1051; cf. 2.1048-89. 21 Shorter Oxford dictionary.

If the author can establish a sort of code system with his reader, so that both parties realize, for example, that Neptune is really an- other word for sea, and that no tainting super- stition about the traditional powers of the gods is suggested, he may then use these personifica- tions to add to his poetic ornamentation (see 2.655-60).

Elder ("Lucretius 1.1-49," TAPA 85 [1954]88-120) has shed most valuable light on this; cf. also E. A. Hahn, "The first prooemion of Lucretius in the light of the rest of the poem," PAPA 72(1941)32-3. 28 Cf. Schoder, CJ 45(1949-50)129: "In the poetic act, both on the part of the poet and of his reader, all the human faculties must operate, and on their highest natural plane." Cf. Elder (TAPA 85[1954191), who notes the ease of movement from the physical to the mental or spiritual plane. 29 E.g. 1.80-135; 2.1-61; 3.31-93; 5.43-54. 30 The ideal of man is to achieve peace of mind, to be a curis semotus; thus he may approximate the state of the gods.

De Lacy (TAPA 88[19571125) mentions that Mars symbolizes the destruction of values, and certainly the destruc- tion of values involves wrong goals. 31 Elder, TAPA 85(1954)115. 32 For the example of Epicurus, who so far ap- proached the state of godliness as to be addressed as a god, see the proems to Books 3, 5 and 6. The peace of mind of practising Epicureans is hinted at in the proem to Book 2. 33 See Bailey, 1.14, 33; 3.1513; cf. 2.167-83, 1090- 1104; 5.110-234, 1117-35, 1148-60, 1194-1240; 6.379-422. 34Cf. E. A. Hahn, PAPA 72(1941)33, who points out that four of the six books end on a note of death. 35 1.451-454. Examples show the likenesses be- tween two things in themselves rather than the similarity between their attributes. Example is "a typical instance; a fact . . . that forms a particular case of a principle, rule, state of things or the like" (Shorter Oxford dictionary). Ex- amples are used to define rather than to explain; to give the meaning rather than to show the proc- esses or operations. The following list contains a minimum count of examples in each book: Book 1, at least 10; Book 2, at least 18; Book 3, at least 14; Book 4, at least 22; Book 5, at least 15; Book 6, at least 20. 36 Ernout and Robin point out (De rerum natura, ed. Paris 1925, 1.xvi) that the conclusions of Books 3, 4, 5 and 6 have tableaux which poetical- ly envelop the preceding technical discussion. 37 1.1102-1113. The last four lines of the book en- courage the reader to persevere in his study of Epicureanism (cf., e.g., 2.381; 4.176-182, 749; 5.1281- 2; 6.423-5). This is typical of Lucretius' solici- tude for his prospective converts. The concluding four lines of Book 1 have no mitigating effect on the impact of the final picture of the preceding lines, but rather serve as a pre-proem to Book 2. Damage to the archetype prevents dogmatic state- ments about lines 1.1102-13; but the lines deal with a possibility which is described more fully later on (e.g. 2.1144-5; 5.95-6; 6.603-7) and in very similar language. 3d2.1150-74. Lucretius does not seem able to make up his mind about the earth's age. In 5.330-1 the earth is new; but in 2.1157-74 she is past her prime, and in 5.826-7 she is compared to a wom- an past childbearing, and therefore at least middle-aged. 39 4.1058-1287. This series of pictures shows to what depths undisciplined emotions, spurred on by uncontrolled physical desires, can descend. The examples prove that moral degradation and physi- cal pain together bring anguish to the man who does not constantly aim at ataraxia. The lan-</page><page sequence="11">LUCRETIUS' carmen dignum 155 guage is strong, but Lucretius is making a strong point, because he is delivering an object lesson preaching against the abuse of the senses and appetites. Lines 1209-87 are slightly quieter, giv- ing guidance to the proper attitude towards love and in a way balancing the preceding lines. But there is still bitterness (see lines 1274-7) which preserves the tone of decaying moral being to the end of the book. 40 5.1105-1457. This concluding series of tableaux shows the gradual change of values which Lucretius thought brought unhappiness to his own contemporaries (see especially 5.1105ff. and 5.1277 ff.). Cf. P. Boyanc6, REA 49(1947)93; W. M. Green, AJP 63(1942)58; C. Martha, Le po6me de Lucrdce (3d ed. Paris 1881)324. In some ways at least primitive man is an unconscious Epicurean; for example, he has few wants (5.937-72; cf. 2.14-39); he realizes that death means the end of pain (5.995-998; cf. 1.107-8; 3.59-86, 670-93, 943). Epi- curus has rediscovered the path towards the original state of childlike innocence in a world basking in the miseries of more sophisticated fears. 41 Several scholars feel dissatisfied with the composition of Book 6, e.g. J. D. Duff (introduc- tion to H. A. J. Monro's translation of the poem, [London 1932]xviii), who says that it is "miscel- laneous in its contents"; W. E. Leonard (De rerum natura ed. Leonard and Smith, [Madison 1942]8) refers to the "patchwork"; C. Murley (TAPA 78[19471341) says that it is an epilogue, not specifically included in the plan; H. J. Rose (Handbook of Latin literature [London 19361127) calls Book 6 "the most plainly unfinished of all"; Bailey (1.37) feels that the conclusion is abrupt, and suspects that the book was left unfinished. 42 6.906-1089. The examples used to demonstrate certain basic facts concerning the behavior of atoms in previous books are here repeated: 6.921- 35, cf. 4.217-29; 6.936-58, cf. 1.348-55 and 1.494-6; 6.959-78, cf. 4.633-72; 6.979-97, cf. 4.643-72 and 2.381- 97 (cf. Bailey 3.1694ff.). Most important, the mag- net reemphasizes the fact that not everything is affected the same way by the same atoms (6.959- 78; cf. 4.633-72, 706-21; 4.1039-40). The relevance of this as far as the diseases of man are con- cerned is indicated in 6.1090-1137 and 6.1226-9. The magnet passage, then, is significant both struc- turally and philosophically. 43 Lucretius considered that bodily diseases have a kinship with mental diseases, as the body has a kinship with the mind. H. S. Commager has many enlightening observations on this ("Lu- cretius' interpretation of the plague," HSCP 62 [1957]105-18). He points out (111) the similarity between the victims of the actual plague in Athens and the sufferers from the psychic plague of fear and desire. There is indeed reason for re- garding the plague as the "moral culmination of the whole poem" (Commager 113). Commager states (108) that Lucretius makes the plague a punishment for those displaying cupido and timor. The association of mental and physical ills made by Lucretius particularly in the last part of Book 6 does seem to indicate that he was showing his readers graphically the state of their non-Epicurean souls. In Book 3 he states that true character emerges only in the face of disas- ter (3.55ff.); the plague certainly proved this (6.1282-6). Elder (TAPA 85[1954193) regards the plague as possibly a deliberate effort to turn men to the only true salvation. But these points, although important, are not of primary impor- tance. Surely the main point of the plague is that it is as indiscriminate as death itself, and is therefore a symbol of death. Death comes to all (e.g. 3.1078-9; 6.1235-51). Perhaps Lucretius' ex- tension of the scope of the plague to encompass the surrounding countryside (as compared with the version of Thucydides) is really another hint of the all-embracing jurisdiction of death. What you do during your life does not affect what hap- pens after death (according to the Epicureans, nothing happens), but merely makes the differ- ence between a happy and an unhappy life. 44 See H. M. Howe, "The religio of Lucretius," CJ 52(1956-7)329-33. These were the two categories of mental fears or curae which their victims tried to escape by physical means. Lucretius showed that mental fears (no respecters of world- ly rank, 2.47ff.) can be conquered only by the mind. Material benefits do not help the body once the minimum demands of nature have been filled; much less can they help the mind, which re- quires assistance at its own level (2.37-39). Not all atoms are beneficial for all atomic compounds, and this applies to everything. Men had mis- understood this; hence they tried to help them- selves by the wrong remedies. Mental fears led to crimes which violated human nature because they produced both mental and physical pain and were therefore directly opposed to Epicurean pleasure, the summum bonum of ataraxia. 45 5.1161-93; cf. 2.168-76. Fear of the interven- tion of the gods in the lives of men developed from wrong opinions attached to the observation of certain phenomena: atmospheric phenomena (1.68-9, 151-4; 5.1204-17; 6.50-5), terrestrial phe- nomena (5.1218-40), sterility (4.1233-8). The sacri- fice of Iphigeneia (1.80-101) showed the extremes to which men were led by this sort of fear. For most people fear of the gods would not manifest itself so horribly; it merely produced an over- whelming sense of insecurity because people felt that their lives were subject to the capricious whims of unstable deities whose demands could not be foreseen and forestalled. Fear of the gods of the underworld was an extension of the fear of the gods during life, and led to attempts to pla- cate the rulers of Acheron beforehand (3.52). 4, 6.92-5. Cf. N. W. DeWitt, Epicurus and his philosophy (Minneapolis 1954) 251, who envisages a seventh book on the gods. This is to mistake Lucretius' purpose in writing a work designed to introduce Epicureanism to beginners. The study of the gods was reserved by the master himself as postgraduate work, and would have been quite out of place in the De rerum natura. 47E.g. J. Masson, Lucretius: Epicurean and poet (London 1907) 287; J. Van der Valk, De Lu- cretiano carmine a poeta perfecto atque absoluto (Rotterdam 1902)13-14; J. Masson, The atomic theory of Lucretius (London 1884)168 n.3; Bailey, introductory note (3.1724) to 6.1138-1286. For a handy synopsis of Bignone's view see Bailey, Addenda et Corrigenda, 3.1759; Elder, TAPA 85(1954)93 n.10. 8 The important fact about the gods is that they are a curis semoti, and this is the character- istic which men of good thinking were bound to copy (see 1.44-9; 2.646-8, 1093-4; 5.82). The rela- tionship between gods and men is also stated in the poem (5.1198-1203; 6.68-78); see also W. H. Fitzgerald, "Pietas Epicurea," CJ 46(1950-1)195- 9; cf. C. Bailey, Greek atomists and Epicurus (Oxford 1928), 479-80. Other details concerning the</page><page sequence="12">156 gods are superfluous for the living of a happy life, because the gods have nothing to do with men's lives. A few things are mentioned: the nature of the gods' dwellings (3.18-24, perhaps explaining 5.146-55), their fineness (5.148-9), their anthropomorphism (5.1169-74). 49 Cf. Epicurus on the pleasure of intellectual pursuits, Vatican fragment xxvii (ed. Bailey, Ox- ford 1926). 50 Cf. note 56 below. On the order of composi- tion of the six books see Bailey's Prolegomena, 1.32-7, and supplementary bibliography supplied by Elder (TAPA 85[1954]88 n. 2). 51 For a discussion of specific and general fears of death cf. Bailey, introductory note (2.994) to 3.31-93. 52 E.g. 1.102-35; 3.35-7,978-1023,1076-94; 4.37-41. Perhaps immortality is another example of men's craving after what they have not, a symptom of refusing to accept complete death as the proper limit of life. Cf. 3.1082; 4.1089-90. 53 3.1053-75 especially. 54 3.910,977; cf. 4.907-24. 55 S. R. Pope observes (G&amp;R 18 [1949] 71) that Lucretius employs longer images when he talks about the fear of death, as though it were a sub- ject "that not merely stirred his intellect, but also aroused his emotions, so that he wrote more self-consciously." 56 Cf. S. B. Smith (De rerumrn natura ed. Leon- ard and Smith [Madison 19421) 185. 57 Cf. A. K. Michels, "Death and two poets," TAPA 86 (1955) 161: "Since, however, Lucretius is a human being writing for his fellow men he is forced to consider death in its more limited as- pect, as it affects human life." Cf. also Guillemin, REL 21/22 (1943/44) 143: "la note humaine qui resonne tout le long du po6me." 58Thus the suggestion of George Santayana (Three philosophical poets [repr. New York 1953] 45), that the De rerum natura might have ended with a Mars-myth to balance the introductory Venus-myth, would remove the personal, human impact of the conclusion, and relegate the force of the poem to the realm of an impersonal my- thology. 59 Even at the very outset of the poem, 1.54-7. 6so The significance of this for man and the life of men is to be found in 2.575-80. 61 E.g. 5.666-79,737-50,923-4,1436-9. 62 H. W. Garrod, The study of poetry (Oxford 1936) 35.</page></plain_text>
