MACINTOSH BELIEF-IN REVISITED: A REPLY TO WILLIAMS There is a general consensus of opinion about the central features of the notion of 'believing-in' and in 'Belief-In and Belief in God' J. N. Williams refreshingly rejects a number of the central points of this consensus.1 It is always valuable to reassess entrenched positions, but I find myself uncon vinced by Williams's arguments, and in this paper I shall argue that his conclusion does not follow from the considerations he adduces, while the points he makes along the way, against myself and others, are often import antly incorrect. The notion of believing-in is found in quite ordinary domains of language as well as in religious language, and it is helpful when considering its function to look initially at these uses. In his discussion of the matter Williams is, I think, either wrong or misleading concerning three main issues in this area: the dual nature of belief-in, the performative aspect of belief-in, and the nature of belief arousal, and I shall consider these before turning to the special case of belief in God. I. THE DUAL NATURE OF BELIEF-IN (a) Belief in and commendation That belief-in has two main uses was suggested by a number of writers in the late I96os, the most influential of whom was H. H. Price, who discussed the matter in an early paper.2 From the point of view of non-religious language there is not a great difference between 'having faith in' and at least one of the senses of' believing in', though there is an increasing tendency to separate them when religious language is under consideration. As D. M. High remarks, 'It has become hallowed parlance among modern Protestant theo logians to distinguish sharply between the terms "faith" and "belief", reserving "faith" for [that] which is beyond or independent of ordinary rational considerations and shunning "belief" as more akin to intellectual assent.'3 Similarly, the OED records the fact that "'belief in God" no longer 1 J.

MACINTOSH means as much as "faith in God"',4 nor is the claim that 'belief' and 'faith' should be distinguished new. 'To beleeve onely possibilities', said Thomas Browne, 'is not faith, but meere Philosophy.' Indeed, following Tertullian, Browne went further, 'me thinkes', he said, 'there be not impossibilities enough in Religion for an active faith ... to credit ordinary and visible objects is not faith, but perswasion'.5 That 'believe-in', or the more prestigious 'have faith-in', has two senses is generally accepted. As early as I953, Hick noted that The word 'faith is commonly used, in relation to religion, in two distinct though related senses, which may conveniently be designated by the termsfides and fiducia. Fiducia ... denotes the worshipper's attitude of practical trust in God. This religious attitude, however, presupposes the occurrence of faith in a different and cognitive sense. For before we can repose our devotion and confidence in God, we must first be aware of His existence. And this awareness is also an exercise of faith, faith not now as trust but as cognition. The religious person is said to know God 'by faith', or to believe 'by faith' that there is a God. Faith in this logically prior sense, as a mode of apprehension, we may distinguish as fides.6 I accepted an analogous dual nature for believe-in in my early paper 'Belief In'.7 I still do. In one of these main uses 'believe in', in addition to reporting a belief, has a commendatory aspect: I can say, unproblematically, that I believe in your competence, but not, save ironically, that I believe in your incompetence. If I believe in someone' s suitability for a given task, then I believe that s/he is suitable for the task, and of course in saying I believe in his or her suitability for the task, I am (thereby) commending that person as suitable for the task. Again, remarking that I believe in someone's un suitability for the task is only semantically acceptable if my intention is pitched in a dimension of irony, sardonicism, or the like. There is a family of attitudes of which approval is one central member (others are commending, trusting, being willing to rely on, having faith in), one or more members of which accompany paradigmatic cases of this use of believing-in. This group is essential to the concept of friendship, and by simple extension to the greatest of the theological virtues, caritas (charity, love), characterized by Aquinas as 'the friendship of humans for God '.8 One of the strengths of ' believe-in' in this sense is that it spans the commending/ approving group, and so may express now approval, now trust, now com mendation, etc., depending on the context of utterance. 4 Oxford English Dictionary (Oxford: University Press, 2nd ed., I989), belief I. 5 Religio Medici (London, I643; reprinted Menston: Scholar Press, I970), Pt. s, ?46, I07; Pt.

It is children who believe in Santa Claus, and in saying of them that they believe in Santa Claus we are recording both their belief in the existence of Santa Claus, and our disbelief. Apart from 'I believe in God', first person present tense uses of what we might call existential belief-in sentences are rare and are almost inevitably accompanied by an awareness that the belief-in in question stands in need of justification. James I, we say, believed in witches, but we do not say that he believed in horses, because horses exist, and that fact was as well known to him as it is to us. The standard use of this sense of 'believe in' is not a first person use, but a second or, more usually, a third person use, and the term is used to indicate the fact that the existential belief of the believer-in is mistaken.9 Typically, someone is said to believe in an entity in this use only if the normal consensus of rational belief is against that entity's existence. In 'Belief-In' I suggested that this linguistic feature should alert believers who use the idiom of themselves to the fact that at some level they themselves are aware of the need for justification for the belief. Such justification, I argued, would require something very like the traditional proofs. I still believe that something as strong as a traditional proof is necessary, but in view of the recent resurgence of fideism in a new and logically more soph isticated guise, I think that more is necessary in the way of argument than I offered there, or than I can offer in the present context. Part of the problem in discussing the notion of 'believing in' is that there appears to be not as much consensus as one might hope concerning the semantic acceptability of various possible sentences. Williams, for example, seems to feel that the sentence I believe in the combustibility of nylon. is unexceptionable - he writes, 'belief in the combustibility of nylon is simply belief that nylon is combustible' (40I) - but such utterances are not stan dard. We do not say things like 'I believe in the solubility of sugar in water': we know that sugar is soluble, and there's an end on't. 'Believe in' suggests that the position is dubious, and hence is not used for remarking on common places. This is not to say that the believer in is believing irrationally, necessarily. In general children believe in Santa Claus because their parents have lied to them and, still in general, though they do have grounds in favour of their parents' general trustworthiness, they do not (yet) have sufficient grounds to know that their parents may on occasion be systematically untrustworthy. 9 Compare Wittgenstein's remark that 'If there were a verb meaning " to believe falsely ", it would not have any significant first person present indicative' (Philosophical Investigations (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, I953), II x, I90).</page><page sequence="4">490 J. J. MACINTOSH Thus their belief may be rationally based. Nonetheless, when people say of a child that it believes in Santa Claus, they make it clear thereby that that is not one of their beliefs. The subjective belief state of the child may be of a piece with a similar belief concerning his or her grandparents, but that does not license a 'reduction' of 'A believes in Santa Claus' to 'A believes that Santa Claus exists'. The first sentence conveys significantly more information than the second. The first sense of 'believe in' also has existential overtones. If I (approv ingly) believe in a particular entity (paradigmatically, a person), then I cannot consistently accept that that entity does not exist. In 'Belief In' I wrote - too strongly, it may be - 'it is impossible to believe in God ... in the first sense without either (i) knowing that he exists or (ii) believing in his existence.'10 Williams's proposed counter-examples (believe in the practice of taking cold showers, believe in equality of pay) are not at all to the point when what is at issue is believing in, or having faith in an entity and, in particular, a person. The abolition of capital punishment is not an entity, so that although the believer-in a putative entity is committed to the existence of that entity, believers in the abolition of capital punishment are not committed to the existence of an entity called 'the abolition of capital pun ishment'. Nor, of course, are they committed to believing that capital pun ishment is (universally or otherwise) already abolished. Rather, they favour the abolition of capital punishment. William's failure to notice that the existence point concerns entities vitiates an important step in his subsequent argument.1" Asking himself whether it is the case that ' (ii) Belief in God entails a belief that God exists - like a belief in one's doctor', Williams suggests that 'one cannot argue for (ii) from the premise that whatever is believed in is believed to exist, since this is false for practices and ideals' (403, 405). However, God is not believed, by Christians at least, to be either a practice or an ideal. And since the existence point concerns entities, points about practices and ideals are not a propos. If we restate Williams's (ii) as (ii) Belief in God (in either of the main senses) is inconsistent with a belief that God does not exist, just as belief in one's doctor is inconsistent with a belief that one's doctor does not exist. then we can see that this result does follow directly from the premise, 'Believing in an entity is inconsistent with believing that that entity does not exist'. Moreover, that premise seems to be true - certainly Williams's alleged counter-examples leave it quite untouched. 10 MacIntosh, 400. Price also made the point that, 'when the "object" of evaluative belief-in is an entity of any kind' the believer-in must at least believe that there is such an entity (Belief, p. 437, Price's emphasis.) " In 'Belief-In' I seem not to have remarked explicitly that I was talking about entities rather than ideals in this context. Presumably I thought, mistakenly as it now appears, that the context would make it clear to readers.</page><page sequence="5">BELIEF-IN REVISITED 49I We should note, however, that people can and indeed usually do have inconsistent belief sets. Williams himself points out that human psychological states allow large departures from the norm, and since it is not even true that A's believing that A believes that p entails A's believing that p (BaBap does not entail Bap), it is surely best not to speak of beliefs entailing beliefs. However, that someone believes p may commit him or her on pain of in consistency to acquiescing in some other sentence q, and that is all that is really needed here.12 Williams accepts this point, I think, for he has himself argued that, e.g. someone may believe p and believe q without believing (p and q).13 We have two senses then, with a strong limiting factor in both cases. In the one we reserve believe-in (existential sense) typically for those cases where we the speakers think the belief is mistaken, with a first person use being allowed only, as it were, in the teeth of evidence. In such a case we expect justification for the existence claim to be forthcoming from a rational speaker: 'You may think I'm going around the bend, but I believe in UFOs (witches, fairies,...). Here's why...' In the other (commending or approving or trusting) sense we insist on a positive evaluation (hence the simple label 'evaluative' for this sense can be misleading). Recognition that there are these two senses of believe in is not limited to philosophers. Don Marquis had archie play upon this fact in 'ghosts': you want to know whether i believe in ghosts of course i do not believe in them if you had known as many of them as i have you would not believe in them either perhaps i have been unfortunate in my acquaintance but the ones i have known have been a bad lot no one could believe in them after being acquainted with them a short time14 Williams's summation of these two senses is not felicitous. He writes, The two sorts of belief-in I have characterized, i.e. belief-in which is straight forwardly identical with a belief-that, and belief-in which is not, are often taken to be indicative of two senses of 'belief-in', a factual sense and an 'evaluative' sense. (402) This leaves it unclear, to me at least, whether or not Williams accepts the dichotomy, but before looking at that question we should emphasize the 12 That A's believing that A believes p is compossible with A's not believing p is generally accepted, in part, at least, because belief is so heavily intertwined with behaviour. In order to set up aformal system in which (BaBap -* Bap) philosophers invoke the notion of an 'ideal' or 'rational' believer. Specific cases in which the putative entailment breaks down (without recourse to psychological considerations) are considered in J. J. MacIntosh, 'The Logic of Privileged Access', Australasian journal of Philosophy, LXI (I983), I42-5I. 13 John N. Williams, 'Inconsistency and Contradiction', Mind, xc (I98I), 600-2. That is, belief often does not collect over conjunction; its not distributing over conjunction is also a possible, though less frequent, case. 1 Don Marquis, 'ghosts', archy and mehitabel (London: Faber &amp; Faber, I 960), p. II 4.</page><page sequence="6">492 J. J. MACINTOSH strangeness of the claim that a belief in might be 'straightforwardly identical with a belief that'. Williams is not the only one who has made this surprising claim. H. H. Price seems to be the original culprit: it is not very difficult to find examples which point the other way. An obvious one is belief in fairies. Believing in fairies amounts to no more than believing that fairies exist. Again, if someone believes in the Loch Ness monster, hejust believes that there is a very large aquatic creature which inhibits Loch Ness."5 and others beside Williams have followed in his footsteps: Following H. H. Price, it can be seen that there is a clear and distinct difference between 'believing-in' and believing-that'. There are some cases where belief-in something can be reduced to a belief-that something is the case, e.g. to believe-in King Arthur is to believe-that there was a king called Arthur. A belief-in which is reducible to a belief-that can be called a factual belief-in.16 Importantly, however, 'Johnny believes in Santa Claus' is not 'straight forwardly identical with' 'Johnny believes that Santa Claus exists,' even if we allow the claim that the former entails the latter, since the first also conveys the utterer's opinion that there is no Santa Claus. (Hence, in part, the strangeness of the Unicorn's offer to Alice: 'I'll believe in you if you'll believe in me.') I do not, in the existence sense, believe in the Prime Minister of Canada, but I certainly both know and believe that he exists. It would require a considerable bout of paranoia before I became convinced that I merely believed in his existence: GUIL: (Leaping up) What a shambles! We're just not getting anywhere. ROS: (Mournfully) Not even England. I don't believe in it anyway. GUIL: What? ROS: England. GUIL: Just a conspiracy of cartographers, you mean?17 'Believe in' in this sense gestures at existence while simultaneously tipping us the wink concerning non-existence. It is not 'straightforwardly identical' with belief-that. As I said, it is not clear whether or not Williams accepts these two senses of 'believes in'. Throughout most of his paper he writes as if he does, but in one passage he says, To say (correctly) that the belief-statement means a number of things is not to say (incorrectly) that it has a number of meanings. To mean a disjunction is not to have a disjunction of meanings. To take the latter course is to ignore Ockham's Razor. (402) This is both puzzling and interesting. Puzzling, because previous writers have not, I think, generally claimed that 'believes' has two meanings. Usually they distinguish the 'senses' or 'uses' of the term. No one suggests 15 H. H. Price, Belief (London: George Allen &amp; Unwin, i969), p. 432. 16 John M. Calvert, 'Indoctrination and belief', Philosophical Studies in Education, LXIX-LXXVI (I977 70. 17 Tom Stoppard, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead (London: Faber, I967), pp. 78-9.</page><page sequence="7">BELIEF-IN REVISITED 493 that 'believes' is used equivocally on its various occasions of use. The work of Wittgenstein from one side, and of Putnam from another, brought home to us how overworked a term 'meaning' was, and it has fallen into deserved desuetude, but that does not mean that we should overlook believe-in's feature of functioning in two distinctly different ways, nor should we be led to the conclusion that terms such as 'sound', with its multiple etymologies and, yes, meanings, are unequivocal. Though they may sound alike, the nautical 'Sound Howe Sound!' and the logician's 'Sound? How sound?' have quite different meanings. 'To mean a disjunction is not to have a disjunction of meanings' may indeed be true for speaker's meaning (though 'meaning a disjunction' has an odd ring to it). Consider a discussion concerning the outcome of a hockey game between the Montreal Canadiens and the Quebec Nordiques. A says, 'I am confident of the outcome.' A's remark presumably has a disjunction of meanings. Either it means that the Canadiens will win, or it means that the Nordiques will, but knowing nothing of A's predilections we are unable to tell which. Such a case is distinct, however, from B's unenlightening prediction, 'Either Montreal will win or Quebec will'. That, presumably, is a case of meaning a disjunction. (And there are other senses of meaning. B's remark may have meant, 'Hockey is boring, let's talk about something interesting like sea battles and future contingents.') But what about sentence meaning or word meaning? That is what is required here, and in this case the claim is much less clear. As in the case of ' sound',' I am waiting for the post' means one thing if I am sitting by a hole in the ground excusing myself to the overseer who wants to know why I am not getting on with the job of fence construction, quite another if I am anxiously awaiting the arrival of the day's mail. Does post 'mean a disjunc tion'? I don't quite know, since I'm not sure what it would be for a word, as opposed to a person, to 'mean a disjunction'. But we might well say of it that it means either __ or , which might, I suppose, be characterized as ' meaning a disjunction'. But then, it does have a disjunction of meanings."8 If we should not rush to accumulate meanings, we should not deny the possibility of such multiplicity, either. The general point, that we should not blithely assume that operators distribute over disjunctions is of course cor rect; on the other hand neither should we assume that no operators do. That is the puzzling part of the claim. The interesting part concerns the invocation of Ockham's razor. Usually principles of parsimony are invoked in theoretical discussions to cut down on the number of ontological kinds or types. Parsimony principles lead us to reject angels as the movers of planets if their orbits can be accounted for by less outre devices. They are not usually invoked to get us to cut down the number of angels per planet. In the present 1 I here follow Williams in using 'disjunction'. But if something has more than one meaning, doesn't it in fact have a conjunction of meanings?</page><page sequence="8">494 J. J. MACINTOSH case, we might well wish to invoke Ockham's razor to get rid of meanings altogether, but the only sense I can give to Williams's case is that he wants us not to have too many meanings, and this is not the usual kind of parsimony associated with Ockham's name. It would be interesting to know just what principle of parsimony he was invoking under the umbrella term 'Ockham's razor', and how, exactly, he thinks it applies. Finally, before leaving the dual aspect of 'believing-in', let us notice two minor linguistic points. The first is that in the past 'believe-in' often managed without the preposition 'in', either by way of substituting 'on' (the King James Version has many examples), or by omitting the preposition alto gether as when Berkeley has Crito ask, 'Shall we believe a God, and not pray to Him for future benefits, nor thank Him for the past? '19 The second concerns a further, distinct, but somewhat technical use of 'believes in', connected with both senses discussed here, but not easily assimilable to either. This is the use, common in philosophical discourse, where 'believe in' is used of the truth of sentences. Here is an example: Under what circumstances is an argument viciously circular? I submit that it is so under one circumstance only: a necessary condition of using it to gain knowledge of (orjustified belief in) its conclusion is that one already have knowledge of (orjustified belief in) its conclusion.20 Neither of these minor points affect the main issue. II. PERFORMATIVES A major mistake Williams finds me guilty of concerns the performative aspect of believes-in - an aspect he believes believes-in to lack. Let us see what is at issue here. Typically, our utterances are performatives.21 They may be explicit performatives, as when I say, I warn you that the ice is thin. or they may be implicit performatives, as when I say, in a situation where you are thinking of venturing out on the lake, The ice is thin. or even, The ice is dangerously thin. Moreover, one and the same utterance may function simultaneously in more than one performative mode. 'The ice is thin' may, for example, be an 19 A. A. Luce and T. E. Jessop (eds), The Works of George Berkeley Bishop of Cloyne 9 vols. (London: Thomas Nelson and Sons, I950), vol. 3, Alciphron, Dialogue V, ?2, p. I76. 20 James van Cleve, 'Reliability, Justification, and Induction', Midwest Studies in Philosophy, IX (1 984), 555-67, 558. 21 In 'Belief In' I used the term performative, as was then common, to refer to what are now more usually called illocutionary acts. Though this is now a fairly standard reading of performative, for a suggestion that it is infelicitous see J. 0. Urmson, 'Performative Utterances', in P. A. French, T. E. Uehling, Jr. and H. K. Wettstein (eds), Contemporary Perspectives in the Philosophy of Language (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, I979), pp. 260-7.</page><page sequence="9">BELIEF-IN REVISITED 495 assertion, a judgement, and a warning. There are even, as Austin pointed out, performatives which apparently cannot be explicit. The ways of insulting someone are many, but saying, 'I hereby insult you' is not one of them.22 These points are well known, but since they are relevant to the present case, they are worth recalling. I noted in 'Belief-In' that (i) 'Believe in' functions performatively: once uttered the speaker has commended (or what have you) subject to the usual qualifications about the infelicities to which performatives are heir. But (ii) it also reports an attitude, and it does not follow that, once the phrase is sincerely uttered, the speaker has that attitude.23 Williams, however, has a very narrow notion of the way in which our utterances can function performatively, and simply rides over this point. He writes, 'A sentence " I q)" is performative if and only if by saying " I (1", a speaker thereby V's.' (403) The difficulty with this unargued for claim is that it is simply false. When I say, 'I'd like the salt, please' I am (subject to the standard qualifications) thereby requesting something of you. I don't have to preface my sentence with the words 'I request...' in order for my utterance to have the status of a request. 'I beg your pardon' has a number of different performative functions depending on context, but begging is not one of them. Again, I can warn you by saying 'I know the ice is thin', but know is not a performative.24 It is also common for one to report a state while issuing a performative. This is one of the differences between 'I am sorry' and 'I apologize'. The first literally reports a state of the person, and is con ventionally used as an apology; the second makes no pretence of reporting a state: it is simply a performative, and though like other performatives it may be uttered insincerely, or in a situation where it is inappropriate, there is no question of its beingfalse. Learning the use of' I am sorry' some children fasten on the reporting aspect, and strongly resist using 'I am sorry' as a merely conventional way of apologizing; others fasten on the performative aspect and happily use it in situations where it is clear that sorrow is not present. As Searle and Vanderveken note, 'The successful performance of (and commitment to) an elementary illocutionary act is not a function of the truth value of its propositional content.'25 'Believe in' is relevantly similar to 'I am sorry', not to 'I apologize', but that does not mean that it lacks a performative function, any more than 'I am sorry' does. 22 J. L. Austin, How to Do Things with Words (Oxford: Clarendon Press, I962), p. 65. 23 MacIntosh, p- 399. 24 This is a bit swift, for sentences beginning 'I know...' do have, as Austin pointed out, the function of 'giving others my authority' for the claim in question (J. L. Austin, 'Other Minds', in Philosophical Papers (Oxford: Clarendon Press, I96I), pp. 44-84, 67), but it is clear that whatever the illocutionary force of to know is, it is not that of knowing, so the point remains. For further discussion see Zeno Vendler, 'Telling the Facts', in F. Kiefer and J. Searle (eds), Speech Act Theory and Pragmatics (Dordrecht: D. Reidel, I979), reprinted in P. A. French, T. E. Uehling, Jr and H. K. Wettstein (eds), Contemporary Perspectives in the Philosophy of Language (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, I979), pp. 220-32. 25 John R. Searle and Daniel Vanderveken, Foundations of Illocutionary Logic (Cambridge: University Press, I985), p. I44.</page><page sequence="10">496 J. J. MACINTOSH Despite his formula Williams seems aware that one can commend without saying 'I commend', for in his very next paragraph he says, Clearly I can say 'I believe in British Rail' without believing in it, and even if what I say is sincere and not mistaken, it is not in saying it that I believe in British Rail. Neither is it true that once the speaker has uttered 'I believe in X' he has com mended X. [footnote: Pace J. J. MacIntosh, ibid. p. 399] The speaker may be in sincere in what he says, but whereas a lying promise is still a promise, an insincere commendation is no commendation. (403) This suggests that, if the utterance is not insincere, then commendation has been achieved. And that, though incomplete, is right (despite Williams's earlier claim). As we have just seen, the actual position is this: believe in both reports an attitude and has a commending (or similar) aspect. The speaker may be sincere or insincere, as well as right or wrong, about the attitude, but is nonetheless committed (subject to the usual qualifications) to the com mendation. If I say to you, regarding a vacancy you wish to fill, 'James would be ideal for the job,' then I have thereby commended James to you, even if in my heart of hearts I think he would be totally ill-suited for the job, even if my commendation is the result of the basest of motives. Of course, if I wink largely at you while I am saying it, or otherwise make my insincerity patent, the commendatory act will misfire, but assuming that there is nothing amiss in the context, I will, in uttering 'James would be ideal for the job', have commended, no matter how far apart my utterance and my belief may be. The same point holds true for other verbs in this semantic area such as ' praise' or 'recommend'. Why Williams thinks otherwise is not made clear. Indeed, the explicit 'I commend' fits Williams's formula as well as any other performative and, given his reliance on that formula, his decision that commending is not performative in nature is even more puzzling. And of course, Williams notwithstanding, I do not have to prefix a commendatory utterance with the words 'I commend' in order to commend. Austin's somewhat rough test involved asking whether in saying something (as opposed to Williams's by saying somnething) the speaker thereby c'd. Ingeni ous commentators have discovered certain problems with this simple test, but it works in the majority of cases, and it is a test which clearly admits commending. Williams says 'an insincere commendation is no commendation', but offers no argument whatever for this surprising suggestion. On the first of May, I663, Pepys 'went to hear Mrs Turner's daughter ... play on the Harpsicon, but Lord, it was enough to make any man sick to hear her; yet was I forced to commend her highly.'26 Pepys clearly did not feel that, since he was insincere, it was impossible for him to commend Mrs Turner's daughter. Similarly, Shakespeare has Petruchio decide, 26 Robert Latham and William Matthews (eds), The Dairy of Samuel Pepys (i i vols., Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, I976), 4: I20.</page><page sequence="11">BELIEF-IN REVISITED 497 Say she be mute and will not speak a word; Then I'll commend her volubility, And say she uttereth piercing eloquence.27 The Dictionary also tells against Williams's claim. After giving the sense in which 'commend' means something like 'commit' ('Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit,' for example), it offers two current senses, in one of which commend is summed up as 'To present as worthy of favourable ac ceptance, regard, consideration, attention, or notice; to direct attention to, as worthy of notice or regard; to RECOMMEND: a. a thing ... b. a person.', while in the other we have 'To mention as worthy of acceptance or approval, to express approbation of, praise, extol.'28 But these are surely performative in nature. When the Spaniards, having captured Grenville, 'praised him to his face with their courtly foreign grace' they were, inter alia, issuing perform atives. In saying whatever they said they (thereby) praised him; of course by saying it they may simply have irritated him.29 Thus if, as seems to be the case, Williams grants that paradigmatic utterances using this sense of 'believe in' have a commending (or similar) aspect, I cannot see that his suggestion that it is 'clearly false' (403) that they are performative has any merit whatever. His reason for arguing in this way seems to be the following: While it is correct to say that where a belief in X is not simply a belief-that, then the believer values X, it is unhelpful. Explaining belief-in in terms of evaluation only leaves more to be explained, not less, unlike the above admittedly rough and ready analysis in terms of belief-that. Where 'A values X' does not simply mean that A believes that X is of value ... then it will be too much of an umbrella term taking in an indeterminate variety of problematic notions such as faith, trust and commen dation. (403) This overlooks two important points. The less important is that Williams has not in fact given an analysis of belief-in in terms of belief-that - not even an ' admittedly rough and ready' one. The more important one is that there is nothing wrong with umbrella terms, even if they take in 'an indeterminate variety of problematic notions such as faith, trust and commendation'. Why Williams thinks this is a drawback in a linguistic item he does not say. If believe-in does involve these other notions, then even if they are themselves difficult or unclear notions, it is not improper to point out the connection; still less should we pretend that it does not exist. Williams may find an account of belief-in which stresses its commendatory function 'unhelpful', but truth is more important than helpfulness. Williams, as his remark about 27 The Taming of the Shrew, JJ, i, I 75-7. 28 Oxford English Dictionary, commend 2, 3. 29 Technically, in the taxonomy of a writer such as John Searle, to praise is an expressive illocutionary act. Recommending for its part is akin to advising: an example of an English directive.

MACINTOSH the combustibility of nylon makes clear, is offering us a revisionary analysis: he would like one use of' believe in' to be simply equivalent to 'believe that': but it is not, and he offers no real reason to tempt us along this path with him. III. BELIEFS, BELIEVING, AND ENTAILMENT Most English count nouns allow us to count the items they sort with com parative ease. Artefact terms such as 'table' or 'train' or 'book' almost always allow easy counting, as do many natural kind terms such as 'lion' or 'molecule' or 'galaxy'. But there are exceptions, and the exceptions import antly include many of the nouns we employ when discussing our moral and mental lives. How many beliefs or thoughts or wonders or hopes or fears did you have between breakfast and lunch yesterday? - to raise such a question is to realize that it has no answer. Beliefs cannot be counted and can be only loosely quantified: I have many beliefs about the genus philosopher, many fewer about the genus phylloxera. But how many beliefs, exactly, do I have about philosophers? Clearly there is no right answer to such a question. It may often be useful to talk about beliefs, just as it may be useful to talk about skies or, in a different way, sunsets, but in none of these cases should we allow the non-literal use to invade our ontology. Beliefs, like most purported pieces of mental furniture (including that Lockean paradigm, ideas), are not in fact countable, and noticing that may save us from certain philosophical mis takes. Phenomenalism, for example, in both its Berkeleyan and its later guises, cannot get off the ground until this point is overlooked. An only slightly paradoxical way of putting the matter would be to say that there are no beliefs, not (without prejudice) for the eliminative material ists' reason that beliefs belong in the lumber room with the rest of the folk psychology paraphernalia, but because the term belief merely provides us with an often convenient way of discussing believing. As so often in philosophy, the verb is less likely to mislead than the noun. 'I believe that Vesuvius erupted in A.D. 79' is comparatively unproblematic, but we must not on that account acquiesce in the notion that 'Vesuvius erupted in A.D. 79' is, literally, one of my beliefs, as if there were a countable stack of mental entities, one of which is named or somehow referred to by the sentence 'Vesuvius erupted in A.D. 79.' Despite this, we do invoke the notion of 'beliefs' when we are discussing human action, and it is arguable that we also invoke 'beliefs' as brain (or 'mental') states which have both causal and semantic attributes. The object of the 'propositional attitude' is something in the hypothesized ' langauge of thought', and thus has both a semantic and a syntactic aspect, while the state which consists of the person's having dispositionally or episodically ('occur rently' in another idiom) such an attitude towards such a content, has causal powers. Thus it is, so one current theory goes, that there is such a 'frequent</page><page sequence="13">BELIEF-IN REVISITED 499 similarity between trains of thought and arguments'.30 About the details which explain this feature, however, there is a good deal of uncertainty and dispute. Williams's solution - that beliefs are entailed, and indeed necessitated, by other beliefs - has the virtue of novelty, but is fairly implausible. Whether and how the semantic attributes of belief states might be causally effective is discussed helpfully and at length by Gabriel Segal and Elliot Sober in 'The Causal Efficacy of Content'."3 Their carefully considered conclusion is that the current status of content theories is not settled enough to allow the causal efficacy question to be decided. For our purposes here we need merely note that whether the semantic properties are efficacious or inert (and perhaps epiphenomenal), no support will be lent in either case to the suggestion that, as a matter of logic, beliefs entail other beliefs. It is, admittedly, hard to know what generic term or terms to choose for the variables over which the en tailment relation ranges, but 'belief' is not really a candidate. Type sentences, token sentences, and propositions of one sort or another have all had their champions, but in this century beliefs simpliciter have not recom mended themselves. 'A believes that p' says of A that A is in a certain state. Such a state of belief may on occasion be adopted by A or, more usually, caused to arise in A, but it is not entailed, either by some prior belief state of A's or by anything else. It is a feature of human beings, which has fascinated philosophers from Descartes to Fodor, that in certain contexts, certain beliefs are well-nigh inescapable. You have no real control over the belief that you are now reading an English sentence - merely drawing the fact to your attention activates the belief. This is a truth about the world's structure as much as your inability to levitate is: it is not a truth of logic. We know that someone's accepting rpl and accepting, e.g. rp -- q1 in the same context of discussion typically does lead to a belief in Fql, but we also know (a) that it does not always do so, even in this and other logically straightforward cases, and (b) similarly simple setups often lead fallaciously to unreliable beliefs.32 What the mechanism may be in either case is far from clear. It is tempting to suggest that Williams is merely speaking loosely when he talks of beliefs entailing other beliefs, that he really means that, typically, one belief state somehow gives rise to another, that for example reasonable belief-in presupposes existence, and would be futile in the absence of such existence, but his claims throughout are couched, very strongly, in the entailment idiom. Moreover, this is no accident, for in his discussion of Malcolm's views (404) Williams distinguishes sharply between those things 30 Jerry Fodor, Psychosemantics (Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, I987), p. 13, Fodor's emphasis. 3 Philosophical Studies, LXIII (I99I), I-30. 32 Fallaciously, but often very systematically. See, e.g. R. Nisbett and T. Wilson, 'Telling More Than We Can Know: Verbal Reports on Mental Processes', Psychological Reviews, xxxiv. (I 977), and R. Nisbett and L. Ross, Human Inference: Strategies and Shortcomings of Social Judgment (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall, I980).</page><page sequence="14">500 J. J. MACINTOSH which are matters of psychology, and those which are matters of logic. Thus he may reasonably be taken to hold that, literally, beliefs entail beliefs. One difficulty, then, about accepting, as Williams does throughout 'Belief In and Belief in God', that beliefs entail beliefs is simply this: they don't. Of course when we state or otherwise consciously formulate a belief, no doubt we will, as rational agents, be committed if challenged to accepting some (but surely not all) of the infinite number of sentences the contained sentence entails. For example, if I believe that the cat is on the mat (normal cat, normal mat, normal on), then I might be held to be wilfully perverse if I did not accept that there was something on the mat. But it is by no means clear that I have to believe even that. And it is very clear that (for example) my belief that the cat is on the mat is quite independent of my belief (if such I have) that the cat is on the mat if and only if Seneca was born in Cordoba. What in general my beliefs commit me to in terms of the things I should further agree to is often, and perhaps usually, unclear. It is, indeed, a matter upon which judges must often rule.33 Applying this to belief-in, it is not true to say that my belief in my friend's competence entails a belief that my friend exists, though it is true that 'my friend is competent' entails 'my friend exists', and that no reasonable, emotionally uninvolved, adult could simultaneously hold both 'my friend is competent' and 'my friend does not exist', and the same holds true if we replace 'my friend' with 'God'. The qualifying 'emotionally uninvolved' is important here. In cases of self-deceit we do not so much lie to ourselves as systematically fail to take account of known or obvious truths, or we take account of an uncomfortable truth at one level but not at another. No doubt this sets up cognitive dissonance which, ultimately, may become untenable: but it may certainly persist for a time. Cases of religious (de)conversion often provide paradigm examples of the phenomenon in question: 'Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.' (This feature is, perhaps, connected with Paul's point that faith is a gift.) These existential implications rely on Kant's point that 'exists' is a second order predicate: it applies if and only if some first-order (non-negative, extensional) predicate applies. This assumes that we have a test for whether or not a predicate is negative, which is clearly a weakness, since we do not have such a test, and it assumes, further, that the notion of extensionality in common use is clearly delineated, which it is not. However the test does provide us with a somewhat unsophisticated but useful tool for discussing existence. It lets us see for example that 'Pegasus is now eating an apple' entails 'Pegasus exists', while the truth that Pegasus is not-now-eating-an apple does not. And even in its rough state it lets us see (again, an insight of 3 The 'reasonable man' rule in the law of torts provides an example here.

White, Grounds of Liability (Oxford: Clarendon Press, I985), chs. 6 and 7.</page><page sequence="15">BELIEF-IN REVISITED 50I Kant's) one flaw in Anselm's version of the ontological argument. As a second-order predicate, 'exists' cannot be added to a list of relevant first-order predicates: if they are already present, so is it.34 IV. BELIEF IN GOD Williams tells us initially, that 'a plausible view of belief in God is to equate it with belief in each of the attributes of God'. For any number of reasons (among them some offered by Williams), this is a most implausible view. Why Williams thinks it plausible he does not tell us. He does, however, go on to say, 'If a man believes in God, he must believe of God that He and His existence, are good. He must have a number of beliefs in the necessary attributes of God', and this is equally implausible. One reason for rejecting it out of hand is the possibility that God has infinite attributes - but the believer in God need not have an infinite number of other beliefs-in before being able to claim belief in God. And while such a believer might believe that any attribute of God's must be good, might, that is, believe a quantified claim about God's attributes, the believer cannot believe in such a quanti fication (yet another reason for doubting that believe-in statements are ' straight forwardly identical' with believe that statements). There are a number of other problems here, among them: (a) If mercifulness (say) is one of the 'necessary attributes of God', and A believes that God is merciful (and that that is a desirable thing), but does not believe that it is necessarily true that God is merciful (believes that God need not be merciful, that mercy may depart away), does A have a belief in God's necessary attribute of mercy? (b) Since believers may be genuinely puzzled as to which, if any, of the attributes they believe God to have, are held necessarily, and may be further puzzled as to what attributes God does have; must they have beliefs-in all these attributes, many of them no doubt unknown to us? Thinkers such as Maimonides who hold that no affirmative remark about the Deity can be truly meaningful to us may represent an extreme position in regard to religious language, but Maimonides believed himself to be a believer. It may well be that there are various attributes such that it is a necessary condition of believing in God that one not attribute them to God - believers must beware of worshipping the wrong God - but it does not follow that there are attributes some or all of which the believer must be right about. The believer may well agree with Chillingworth that 'he that believes the Scrip ture sincerely, and endeavours to believe it in the true sense, cannot possibly be an Heretique' for, Chillingworth suggests, requiring more would be 'to make God a Tyrant, and to say that he requires us certainly to attain that 3 I. Kant, Critique of Pure Reason, A598 = B626. This type of first-order predicate Kant called 'determining' predicates. He held, correctly, that 'exists' was not such a predicate.</page><page sequence="16">502 J. J. MACINTOSH end, for the attaining whereof we have no certain meanes'.3 Additionally, there are certainly some who would normally be counted as believers in God, who seem not clearly to fit Williams's criterion: [C. S.] Lewis was a Christian of a rather old-fashioned kind: he believed in the God of the Old Testament - in a jealous, vengeful, wrathful God, who would punish ruthlessly. There was not much of the spirit of the Sermon on the Mount here; and I remember his speaking with unmistakable satisfaction of the 'night of the long knives' that would follow immediately upon the entry of the Russians into Berlin - sentiments that sounded strange from the lips of a Christian.36 Again, people may disagree concerning the necessary attributes of God, and yet be all believers: The Augustinian theories of the divine ideas and of divine illumination passed into the Middle Ages. Thinkers such as Aquinas tried to state the theory of divine ideas in such a way as to free it from an anthropomorphism which would be incompatible with belief in the divine infinity and simplicity. In the fourteenth century, however, Ockham rejected it. Or, more accurately, he interpreted it in a manner which was equivalent to rejection.3 Yet Augustine, Aquinas, and Ockham were alike believers in God. It is by no means clear that 'If a man believes in God, he ... must have a number of beliefs in the necessary attributes of God.' Or at least, it is by no means clear if the number is to be greater than zero, and the beliefs are to be correct. In passing, we might note a further area where Williams (unnecessarily) overstates his case. He writes, 'To hold the Christian belief in God surely involves regarding Him and His existence as a good thing. A belief that did not involve this would have no Christian interest' (404). This surely ignores much that is of interest in the psychology of conversion. To believe in God's existence without having acquired the correct attitude toward God might well be the first step in a conversion process. For this reason writers such as Cudworth, Boyle and Glanville stressed the simple belief in something super natural as an important distinguishing mark between the rationally con vertible non-Christian and 'resolved Atheists'. Concerning the latter Boyle wrote, 'Tis not by Gods ordinary workes, but by his Extraordinary Power, that such men must be reclaimd to an acknowledgement of his &lt;Existence&gt;. For they yt would find ye Truth, especially in matters of Religion, must be diligent Inquirers after it, and may be strict Examiners of it, but must not be resolued Enemies to it. For to such, if to any, God is a Sun, that is not to be discover'd but by his owne Light.38 3 William Chillingworth, The Religion of Protestants (Oxford, I 638; reprinted Menston: Scholar Press, 1972), p. 92. 36 P.

Copleston continues in a footnote: 'Given the authority enjoyed by Augustine in the Middle Ages, it required a bold man to say simply " he was wrong" or " he was talking nonsense". Interpretation was a more prudent policy.' 38 Boyle Papers, vol. 2, f 64. Angle brackets enclose Boyle's inserted 'existence', replacing the man uscript's original 'essence'.</page><page sequence="17">BELIEF-IN REVISITED 503 A belief whose attitudinal side Williams thinks unChristian may nonetheless be of considerable 'Christian interest': many conversion stories start with some kind of belief in (some kind of) God, and end with the right kind of belief in (the right) God. In conclusion Williams writes, 'Hence we must accept [that] a belief in God entails a belief that God exists. And a belief-in that entails beliefs-that will be rational only if these beliefs-that are rational too' (406). As we have seen there are difficulties with this. Beliefs do not in fact entail beliefs, and though holding a particular belief may entail that one is committed to accepting (some) of the entailments of the belief content, there is no clear cut way of deciding in advance what these may be. Further, if one accepted that what was at issue was the entailment of belief contents by belief contents, Williams's point about rationality would be clearly inapplicable. Suppose you and I share a belief in A's competence, and that you have the further conjunctive belief that A exists and there is a prime couple between Io97 and Io98, while I for my part believe that A exists and there is not a prime couple in that number span. That A is competent will entail one of these believed conjunctions, but our inability to justify either rationally will not affect the rationality of our belief in A's competence. Finally, with the recent rise of Plantinga-esque fideism, the question of deciding upon the rationality of theological beliefs-that has become very much an open question. I agree with a suitably modified version of Williams's conclusion, but I am far from agreeing with the argumentative support he offers for it.39 Department of Philosophy, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada, T2T4X9 3 I have been helped in writing this paper by suggestions from K.
