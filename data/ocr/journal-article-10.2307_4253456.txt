<plain_text><page sequence="1">Flesh of the Gods: The Ritual Use of Hallu- cinogens. Edited by Peter T. Furst. 304 pp. illus. Praeger Publishers, New York, 1972. $10.00. Few themes have more fascination than those reflecting man's endless search for answers to the real as well as the imagined problems of life and death. The spectre of personal annihilation re- mained intolerable until man's invention of reli- gion promised him more hopeful alternatives. His ego rarely allowed him to accept death as a natural phenomenon, and elaborate mytho- logies, past and present, testify to his preoccupa- tion with the mysterium tremendum et fascinosum of his existence. Carlyle's plaintive cry still echoes the sentiments of vast millions: "But whence? 0 heaven, whither? Sense knows not, faith knows not, only that it is through mystery to mystery, from God and to God." Anthropomorphic gods are common, and man created his most powerful deities in his own image, endowing them with virtues and vices differing from his own principally in magnitude. In all societies religion has served to vindicate man s most extravagant hopes as well as to miti- gate his profoundest fears. Both in the Old World and the New, shamans devised mystical ceremonies for communicating with deities and served as sacred intermediaries for their fellow tribesmen who were not en- dowed with such esoteric knowledge. Early American civilizations, including the Aztec, Maya, Inca, and their predecessors, discovered hallucinogenic plants that were capable, upon ingestion or inhalation, of producing vivid other-worldly visions and of literally trans- 446 ECONOMIC BOTANY 27: 446-448.

The deeply impressive experi- ences of participants in shaman-conducted agapes fortified man's belief in the supernatural and probably also awakened hopes and inti- mations of immortality. Nine of the 10 essays in this compendium deal with some of the better known magical plants, their characteristics, distribution, physiological effects, sociological impact, chemical composi- tion, and, most particularly, their ceremonial use. Although Professor Weston La Barre's con- tribution to the book is placed last, his chapter on "Hallucinogens and the Shamanistic Origins of Religion" may very appropriately be read first because it offers an interpretation of the origin, evolution, and meaning of religious cults, whether these are associated with veneration of peyote, mushrooms, or other sacred plants. Here are a few excerpts from Prof. La Barre's illumi- nating text. "Among human institutions . . . religions of the supernatural perhaps represent the purest form of subjective wish, for in the supernatural we deny the natural world, and in religion we willingly ignore the mundane in our yearning for the idea. A religion is a kind of group dream-the subjective poetry in which, sup- porting one another's faith or need to believe, we strive desperately to believe .... Every religion, in historic fact, began in one man's "revela- tion"-his dream or fugue or ecstatic trance." For a memorable psychological and anthro- pological study of religion the reader is referred to La Barre's recent (1970) book The Ghost Dance. Almost all the chapters are based on pre- viously published works of the authors, and their presentation in book form is a useful device for acquainting a broader audience with the rapidly growing body of information on plant hallu- cinogens and the cults associated with them. Among the plants considered and their expo- sitors are teonanacatl (mostly Psilocybe spp.) the sacred mushrooms of Mexico, reviewed by R. Gordon Wasson; soma, recently identified by Wasson as Amanita muscaria, in a book giving massive evidence to support this interpretation; peyote (Lophophora williamsii) the Mexican vi- sion-producing cactus, presented by Peter T. Furst; San Pedro (Trichocereus pachanoi), another hallucinogenic cactus, one used by sha- mans in northern Peru, by Douglas Sharon, who, in the manner of Carlos Castaneda, became ap- prenticed to a curandero: ayahuasca (Banis- teriopsis caapi), a liana of the Malpighiaceae with a wide distribution throughout the Amazonian region, by Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff; mari- huana (Cannabis sativa), by William A. Em- boden, Jr.; tobacco (Nicotiana spp.) among the Warao Indians of Venezuela, by Johannes Wilbert; iboga (Tabernanthe iboga), an African psychotomimetic plant of the Apocynaceae, by James W. Fernandez; and, finally, in a chapter entitled "An Overview of Hallucinogens in the Western Hemisphere," by the distinguished eth- nobotanist Richard E. Schultes, a number of hallucinogen-producing plants are discussed and illustrated, including tobacco, ayahuasca, Datura spp., morning-glories (Ipomoea and Rivea of the Convolvulaceae), mushrooms (Stropha- riaceae), and parica (Virola spp.) and other myristicaceous snuffs. A formidable array of plant hallucinogens is reviewed, and there is included a bibliography of 3 36 titles. The unexpected and highly significant role that naturally occurring psychoactive sub- stances have played in establishing man's rapport with and belief in the supernatural is only begin- ning to be recognized.
