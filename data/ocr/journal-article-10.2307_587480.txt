<plain_text><page sequence="1">Conference of the British Sociological Association, I 955. V Public Opinion, Polls and Foreign Policy H ENRY DURANT x Y rHEN Parliament are discussing, for example, the length of the zA/ term of service for National Service men, are they discussing domestic s s matters or are they discussing foreign policy ? It is clear that the answer is " Both " and many such instances can be found. And yet, at any rate in the wntings of political theorists, a sharp distinction tends to be drawn between domestic and foreign policies. The explanation is partly historical; England had a " foreign policy " long before she had a " domestic policy". There has always existed some kind of state apparatus for handling relations with other countries with its own forrnal mles of procedure, with all the paraphernalia of representatives and Ambassadors. Yet one has to go back less than 300 years to find the " domestic " apparatus of the Central Government consisting of little more than H.M. Customs and Excise, whose funds the King raided at pleasure, and whose funds, moreover, arose largely from dealings with foreign parts. It was not at all clear, accordingly, that even H.M. Customs vas a " domestic " Ministry. All domestic measures were ad hoc, designed to deal with a parti- cular set of circumstances arising at the moment. Political theorists inevit- ably wrote about foreign policy, because little else existed as a policy and so could not be discussed coherently. Foreign policy has throughout tended to remain segregated, a separate subject for study, and any discussion of its general relationship to domestic policy is spasmodic and incidental only. It is not surprising, therefore, that there has been little discussion of foreign policy and public opinion. Foreign policy has tended to be the pre- serve of the well-to-do (a Foreign Ofiice official, who made an unorthodox entry into the Foreign Office dunng wartime, quoted with wry relish how he was greeted by a famous diplomat, " It's refreshing to meet a face that doesn't seem to have come out of Balliol"), a field for the skilful negotiator, I49</page><page sequence="2">I50 PUBLIC OPINION, POLLS AND FOREIGN POLICY full of secret diplomacy and expertise. Why should this plant, living in such a rarefied atmosphere, be discussed in relation to the vulgar happenings in the market place ? What has the decisions taken at the Court of St. James's to do with events at the hustings ? This failure to try to elucidate what relates foreign policy to public opinion, or even to the wider concept of democracy, becomes all the more explicable when it is recalled that nowhere in the British Constitution is the ultimate source of power defined. " Demo- cracy " and " public opinion " are orphan children, left to make their own way in the political jllngle, and they will be heard of only to the extent that they themselves succeed in insisting that they should be heard. The early studies of public opinion used the term in a pejorative sense [I] and it is necessary to remind ourselves of this fact to-day when public opinion has become a respectable subject for academic study. We have moved a long way since Sir Robert Peel wrote in I820, as Bryce comments, " with the air of a discoverer ", of " that great compound of folly, weakness, prejudice, wrong feeling, right feeling, obstinacy, and news- paper paragraphs, which is called public opinion".[2] But the birth-stains on public opinion must be borne in mind if the present situation is to be understood and it is to be comprehended why there should still be this gap. The etymology of public opinion is nowadays a part of the vocabulary of the trained social scientist, but with a few exceptions [3] there have been no case studies of the relations between public opinion and foreign policy and validated generalizations are few and far between. We must not over- look the extenuating consideration that a study of the relationship between public opinion and foreign policy demands an almost presumptuous omniscience on the part of the analyst. Information about foreign policy is hard to get: the language used is designed to shield rather than to disclose substantive issues and little is done to ease the path of an enquirer. The other half of the relation is equally elusive, although for a different reason. Public opinion is an amorphous creature and faced by it, the student is apt to quote Falstaff on Mistress Quickly, " A man knows not where to have her", and turn to other, more tractable subjects. There is lastly a moral reason which has had an important influence in preventing foreign policy and public opinion from being confronted with each other too often. Social science has largely owed its origins to reformers, anxious to improve the world, and still, to-day, it is full of " do-gooders ", to coin an Americanism. For such people there is something intrinsically bad about the concept of " power" and it may be suspected that foreign policy has to do with " power ". It is something, therefore, to be abolished rather than to be studied. This is particularly the attitude of those who look upon public opinion as a positive good and as a universal touchstone for action in all circumstances. These people, least of all, are likely to study " power " in order to understand it. Public opinion can be considered in two ways: firstly, as a theoretical concept belonging to the realm of political theory and which is, in general,</page><page sequence="3">HENRY DURANT I5I the intellectual foster-mother of the movements for liberal reforrn in the nine- teenth century. It was for instance mvoked by advocates of franchise-for-all in order to oppose the opinions of a small ruling-class or dlite. Secondly, public opinion can be considered to mean what public opinion pollers say it is, i.e. a conventional yardstick which imparts to one person an opinion more or less equal in weight to the opinions of other individual persons. Implicit in this arithmetical equalitarianism is the democratic premise that government is by, th, and for, the people. The fact that people act itTation- ally, lack information and seem to want intelligence may be cited as an indict- ment of this statistical concept of public opinion. Pollers of public opinion, however, do not infer that vox populi is a bluepnnt for the statesman, and in any case the indictment lies equally against universal franchise. The pollers' function, briefly, may be described in this way; if you agree with the demo- cratic premise of one man one vote, it logically follows that it is possible and helpful to collate and at the same time analyse a whole gamut of indindual * n opmlons. As a concept in political theory, it is interesting to note that while public opinion was largely regarded as another name for the " general will ", the latter was felt to apply only to political issues within the state. Foreign policy was felt to be outside the sphere of the " general will ". It is true that we can trace the impact of popular ideology on foreign policy from the time of the French Revolution, when " liberte, egalite, fraternited " were carned across Europe by Napoleon's arrnies. And it is also true that from Castle- reagh onwards, successive Foreign Secretaries invoked the disinterested indig- nation of the British middle-class on the policies of the reactionary govern- ments of Europe during the early half of the nineteenth century. But this was a practical attitude: it was a useful moral umbrella for the big stick. As a theoretical concept public opinion was assumed by liberal thinkers in the nineteenth century to be so good and so right that if only all policies could be made responsive to public opinion, there would hardly be a need for foreign policies: there would only be domestic policies since rule by the fiat of public opinion would automatically guarantee a harmony or con- vergence of the " general will " of each state. This assumption, or line of reasoning, reached its apogee when in I9I9 Woodrow Wilson proclaimed, in relation to the " cooling off " clause about any disputes brought before the League of Nations: " Whenever any trouble arises the light (of public opinion) shall shine on it for a year before anything is done, and my prediction is that it will not be necessary to do anything." Woodrow Wilson's thinking was also reflected by his policy-making. Euro- pean states, at the Peace Conference of I9I9, had their boundanes more or less redistnbuted according to the pnnciples of self-determination (a dis- guised " general will ") so that the existence and opinions of small publics were sanctified by the establishment of minority enclaves, e.g. Danzig. Diplo- macy was felt to be the product of an out-dated autocracy which had caused World War I. As Ponsonby once put it: " The spiders of intrigue which</page><page sequence="4">I52 PUBLIC OPINION, POLLS AND FOREIGN POLICY have woven undisturbed their tangled webs in secret have to be chased out of darkness into the open light of day." Even when the wheel has turned full circle and instead of a liberal demo- cracy there is a dictatorship, we find the dictator much concerned with publie opinion, particularly in relation to foreign affairs. Ciano often mentions in his diaries the preoccupation of Mussolini and his entourage witlo the import- ance of preparing publie opinion for coming events, such as the Ethiopian invasion, and for Italian intervention in the Spanish Civil War. But in all these discussions, examinations and manipulations of public opinion it is extraordinarily difficult to discover a realistic analysis of its characteristics. Public opinion is, it is clear, awkward to describe, elusive to define, difficult to measure, and impossible to see. One is reminded of Laski's rhetoncal and oft repeated question, " If I met the general will walking down the street how would I recognize it ? " But admitting all this, it nevertheless exists, and it certainlSJ can be felt, particularly svhen it shifts. James Russell Lowell once remarked that popular sentiment was like the pressure of the atmosphere, one could not see it, but " all the same, it is I6 lb. to the square inch ". This is a point we will return to later. If we look at the work and writings of opinion pollers, little theoretical clarification will be found. Louis Guttmann in numerous articles, and Paul Lazarsfeld, particularly in The A^nerican Soldier,:4] have attempted to supply some kind of theoretical analysis, complete with concepts, of the phenomenon that they spend their lives measuring. But in both cases their analysis tends to degenerate lnto mathematical symbols: the relations within the entity are expounded and even in some instances its relations to other con- cepts, but the nature of the entity itself remains undiscovered. So far as opinion pollers are concerned publie opinion is a statistical entity, and, harsh cntics can comment, so is a heap of gravel. More, however, can be said than this about their work and their measurements have thrown light on certain aspects of the public's thinking in relation to foreign affairs. It is clear that relatively fesv individuals have a logic of foreign policy so well organized and so inclusive as to permit one to predict any speciSc attitude. On the other hand, public thinking regarding foreign affairs is not completely without structure or consistency over time. Every poll in America has found over the past years a large majority of Americans opposed to the entry of the Peking Government into the United Nations. British polls, however, taken over the same period, have shos n on each occasion a large group) between 40 and 60 per cent, who favour the inclusion of Communist China. The attitudes of the two peoples have remained different and consistently so. It may, of course, be argued that these diHerences simply reflect the differences in the policies followed by the two Governments tossards Peking, with foreign policy leading public opinion, rather than vice versa. But against this can be quoted, for instance, the repeated Amencan polls which have shown that a large majority of the Amencan public regard U.S.A's</page><page sequence="5">HENRY DURANT I53 entry into the Korean war as " a mistake ". Such an attitude would not be found reflected in official circles. The way in which an individual person news foreign affairs depends upon his position in the social structure, his income, education, occupation, his party: and it is influenced by his age and historical expenences. This is a truism, because the same thing may be said about his views on domestic issues. But whereas in domestic issues the opinions of groups are often sharply opposed, in foreign affairs what is common to all of them is more outstanding than what differentiates them. Firstly, and we are discussing nations as well as social groups, peoples everywhere are prone to stereotype their own nationality in favourable terms. They view other nations in anthropomorphic terms, failing to draw a distinction between " Governments " and " peoples ". The survey made by UNESCO a few years ago [5] accentuated a pheno- menon that has frequently been remarked the narrow limits of the individual's horizon. The individual respondent is quick and definite in answers about conditions that affect him personally his job, his secunty, his location in the social structure. He is quicker to identify himself with any of his country- men than to identify himself with a corresponding class in another country. It is true of most peoples what a novelist once said of middle-class Parisians, that " they thought of the world as a sort of dish, the bottom being France, wth all the foreign lands and peoples grouped together around the narrow, slanting rim, so that stray objects and personalities slid down into their ken now and again".[6] As far as " friendliness " with other countnes is concerned, it appears that the individual, after deciding whether a nation threatens or reassures him, then fills in with a description of the people of that nation, colouring them in predominantly attractive or unattractive characteristics to suit his purposes. Those who analyse polls divide the public into three categories: (i) The unaware, the people who confess they have neither read nor heard of important issues in foreign policy. (ii) The aware, the people who have heard or read but have only rudi- mentary knowledge. (iii) The informed, the pec)ple who are not only aware of issues, but who also know their meaning and their implications. Using these definitions, public opinion analysts over a period of time have arrived at something like this so far as U.S.A. and Britain are concerned: one-third of the electorate is unaware of almost any given event in foreign affairs; one-third is aware but cannot be considered informed; and only one-third consistently shows knowledge. Men are more well-informed on foreign affairs than vvomen: women invariably have a higher proportion of " Don't knows ", varying in a recent comprehensive poll on foreign affairs from I7 per cent to 79 per cent. The mean was, approximately, 40 per cent. Conservatives tend to be more</page><page sequence="6">I54 PUBLIC OPINION, POLLS AND FOREIGN POLICY emphatic in their opinions partly a function of having higher incomes, travelling more, and hence more frequent access to foreign news-and to have enjoyed the kind of education which enables them to make wider judgments. Labour supporters always have a higher proportion of " Don't knows ". The ignorance and lack of interest of the public in foreign affairs are proverbial. Dr. Gallup showed that in America after four months of dis- cussion of the E.R.P. programme, one-half of the voters said they had not read or heard about it. In this country only a minority had heard of Marshall Aid after it had existed for a year. Even to-day in Bntain enquiries amongst voters will show that perhaps I in 3 does not know what NATO stands for. It is partly due to the complexity of international affairs: as Zimmern once said, " It needs a highly trained mind to read a newspaper." It is partly due to their remoteness. The entire loss of the Persian oil-Selds is not so painfully obvious to the British public as a series of electricity cuts resulting from a temporary overloading of the grid system. The popular Press, driven by the necessity of secunng maximum sales, finds that a sober analysis of overseas events lacks news value. Only a crisis makes the headlines. SIore- over, the people and the Press are generally more vocal in expressing opinions against than in declaring support for, and they never initiate anything in the sphere of foreign policy. And it is only in times of tension that the public seems to get vociferous about anything. In what ways can the opinions of the public be most usefully applied to the problems of foreign policy ? It is hardly useful to learn whether the public approves of general principles, though this is what the public finds it easiest to pronounce upon. For example, everyone is in favour of peace vis-a-sris war, but people tend to delude themselves into thinking that they can hae their cake and eat it. For example, Bassett comments on the fact that during the Sino-Japanese campaign in Manchuria people wanted not only " peace ", but assumed also that sanctions could be applied against Japan witlloUt war. The people had not thought out the consequences of their preferences, incidentally just as the government of the day had apparently not either. It is not very useful at the other extreme to find out whether the public approves of particular means. The public might be in favour of sending troops to Kenya and suppressing the Mau-WIau, but only the expert can decide on the most advantageous disposition of troops. Perhaps the citizer can most fruitfully apply his opinions to the middle ground. The citizen can at least say whether he is prepared to make the sacnfices svhich the government demands: blood, toil, tears and snTeat, to pay taxes for rearma- ment or to tolerate National Service. But the public, for technical reasons, cannot exercise direct control. Note the dictum of Jefferson, regarded as an outstanding democrat, that " the transaction of business with foreign nations is executive altogether ". " Peoples speaking to peoples" is apt to become a confusing babel, concen- trating on ideological likes and dislikes and ignoring the necessities of survisral.</page><page sequence="7">HENRY DURANT IeF M Moreover, negotiations cannot be camed on by a numerous assembly. Nor can the legislature play a very full part in formulating a foreign policy and getting it accepted by the executive. Due to the recuITence of international crlses of every kind there is an increasing need for speed of action which the legislature is unable, for technical reasons, to provide. And it is not very helpful to argue that the legislature can formulate the general terms of reference vnthin which the executive may take-action, for the terms will be so general as to be of little use in determining what the executive will do in a specific situation. Whereas a govemment is able, in the domestic sphere, to commit itself in advance to a particular course of action (as it does, or tnes to seem to do at every election), it lacks this freedom in foreign affairs because of the very nature of foreign policy itself. But as " Fallen Minister " remarked in The Observer,[7] " the vigilance of the public operates powerfully on the subconscious of members of the govemment ". And Ginsberg [8] points out that " The value of public opinion . . . lies not in its power of initiation but of control . . . though not always enlightened, it does nevertheless act as a check on the designs of those who wzeld power in society." Mannheim [g] made a similar point, in more elaborate fashion, and per- haps in a more optimistic mood: Liberal democratic society which first worked out the principle of public opinion immediately lost sight of the real meaning of secrecy in society.... The detri- mental consequences of publicity in an increasing number of spheres can best be observed in the fatal fact that since the \Vorld NVar, external politics in a certain sense have become increasingly public, and in these spheres waves of mass sentiment have had to be reckoned with where previously internal discussions in diplomatic circles would have sufficed. This is naturally no justification at all for the earlier secrecy and intrigue of international diplomacy. NVe must see, however, that we only fall from the frying pan of secret diplomacy into the fire of a foreign policy increasingly at the mercy of public whim and fancy. We can at least learn the elementary principles of a reasonable solution from the distortions of these two extremes. In a well articulated society public opinion is not an incalculable, occasional integration of moods, but the principle of public control creates for itself organs of criticism. These organs are so incorporated into society that they can, if necessary, count on complete secrecy. At the same time, however, they possess complementary institutions and regulations through which misuse of this secrecy- nepotism, graft, etc. zan be checked through the exercise of moral sanctions. Naturally the exact details of this planning for criticism cannot be worked out here. This verges on the edge of utopianism and if we turn to a more realistic analysis of to-day's situation what we find written is that the people has become " nothing but the amorphous residuum that lies outside the con- tending ' pressure groups ' of business large and small, of finance, of labour, of agriculture, of the organized professions, of the political bureaucracy itself, . . . nothing but the diagonal of the forces that constantly stnJggle for advantage ". [IO] The character of interest groups clearly vanes within the social stmcture of the country, but most countnes have evolved forms through which business</page><page sequence="8">I56 PUBLIC OPINION, POLLS AND FOREIGN POLICY and managerial elements, organized labour, the churches, farmers and peasants, racial or cultural minorities, veterans and regional organizations can giere expression. Also smaller but often very powerful groups are found, e.g. foreign trading and investment organizations, international transport and communication, international friendship and cultural societies, UNA's and pacifist movements. Interest or pressure groups can often exert a great influence on policy: e.g. to take recent instances from abroad, the China lobby in the U.S., and the coffee aristocracy under the liberal government of Guatemala, are good examples. As organized groups, these people carry far more weight and influence than they would have as single individuals. Pressure groups are not necessarily sinister and they often work in the open. Perhaps the best example of this is the Trades Union Congress which sends deputations to Ministers, including the Prime Minister, it submits memoranda, publishes " open " letters, holds meetings, conducts press cam- paigns. Among the committees of the T.U.C. General Council is one on inter- national affairs, a permanent body which may report on issues referred to it or report on issues on its own initiative. Generally speaking these issues are of two kinds: first, doctrinal issues, for example the pnvate manufacture of armaments, or the persecution of trades union movements abroad; and secondly, particular issues of government policy likely to affect workers' living standards, costs, wages and employrnent. From time to time the T.U.C. has urged government action in regard to Mussolini or Hitler or Franco. In July, I95I, for instance, Sir Vincent Tewson, the T.U.C. General Secretary, sent Mr. Morrison, then Foreign Secretary, a letter giving " an explicit reassur- ance of our resolute opposition to the Franco dictatorship". In May, I952, the T.U.C. General Council issued a statement that it viewed " with growing concern the development by the Government of South Africa of policies which are resulting in the violation of the basic democratic freedom of the people and which can only lead to the subjugation of the African and non-European populations into positions of perpetual subservience and to the creation of bitter racial hatreds'. It is unnecessary to develop the theme of pressure groups, interest groups, because the whole subject is being analysed exhaustively in another session of the conference.[II] It seems, however, to the present ter that these are the real links between " the public " and foreign policy. Clearly political parties are interest groups and they are not being excluded from this analysis. They, the parties, the pressure groups, the lobbies, are the means whereby influence is exerted directly on the foreign policy of the government. Public opinion, as such, is in most instances simply a governor which comes into operation only when certain limits of action have been exceeded. This is the picture in the main, but to prevent the last generalization from being too sweeping one must recall the National Peace Ballot of I935. Organized mainly by the League of Nations Union, in association with other bodies, the total number of voters recorded reached the impressive total</page><page sequence="9">HENRY DURANT 7 of more than Ili mfllions. This was a propoHion of 38 per cent for the whole country, even though the proportion in London was under 30 per cent. It is perhaps worth recording the questions and answers (rounded off to the nearest (loo: Q. I. Should Great Britain remain a member of the League of Nations ? Yes, II,090,400. No, 355,4.00.

Ordinarily, as we all know, the organization is lacking and the ISeld of foreign affars is taken over from the people by the gentlemen and the professionals. REFERENCES I. Le Bon, The Crowd.
