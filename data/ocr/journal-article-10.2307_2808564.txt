<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SENSORY BASIS OF BIRD NAVIGATION BY DONALD R. GRIFFIN F EW natural phenomena have excited more wonder, guesswork, and debate than the long distance flights of migratory birds. Many species travel thousands of miles from breeding grounds to winter range, often crossing hundreds of miles of open ocean. Some young birds apparently make their first migration without adults of the same species to guide them. The central problem is one of navigation: how does the bird know where to fly? Some receptor or receptors must be excited by an aspect of the bird's environment which is related to the direction of its goal. Visually perceived landmarks con- stitute one such aspect of the environment, but there are many migrations in which some other type of orientation must be involved. For in- stance, some birds cross large bodies of water in cloudy weather when no landmarks are visible, while in other species the young migrate before they have had an opportunity to learn anything about the route. It seems, at first glance, that those aspects of the environment which are func- tions of the geographical relationship between the bird and its goal are outside the sensitivity range of its receptors. Are unsuspected geographical cues available to birds, or is their sensory spectrum more extensive than we know? No completely satisfactory answer to this ques- tion can yet be given, for direct studies of migra- tion have seldom passed beyond the descriptive stage. Valikangas (1933) has shown that ducks raised in Finland from English eggs migrated south in their first autumn with Finnish birds and that several returned the next spring to their "foster homes" in Finland. This experiment indi- cates a lack of any inheritance committing the bird to a specific route. Thienemann (1930), Skovgaard (1929), and Schenk (1909) reared young storks in captivity and released them in the autumn after most wild storks had departed. Several of the young birds were recovered on or not far from the species' normal migration route. Rowan (1931) reported similar results with crows, although Drost (1939) found that when young sparrowhawks were treated in this way, they gen- erally remained near the point of release. These experiments confirm the ornithologists' impression that young birds of many species can make their first migratory flight without the guidance of ex- perienced adults. Rowan (1932, 1938a, 1938b), Schildmacher (1933, 1934), Wolfson (1941), and others have studied the effects of endocrine secretions on the time of migration They have learned much about the internal stimulus necessary to initiate migra- tion, but such studies have not thrown much light on the sensory processes by which birds guide themselves on long migratory flights. Most of our knowledge of the sensory basis of bird navigation has been obtained from homing experiments; for in these experiments it is possible to control, to some extent, the conditions under which the bird is to make its long distance flight. Consequently this review will be concerned almost entirely with such work. The term "homing" has been used to cover (1) return of birds shipped in captivity to a distant release point, and (2) a natural migratory flight, often hundreds of miles long, in which birds leave one region and then return to it the following season. Austin (1940) and Stoner (1941), for example, have used the term in the latter sense, while Thompson (1926) and others have made a sharp distinction between what might be called "natural homing" and the "artificial" homing experiments, such as those de- scribed below, in which birds are captured, shipped to a distance and released. Among the "artificial" homing experiments should be included the re- markable feats of the domestic and non-migratory racing pigeon. It seems reasonable to assume with WVarner (1931) that the same or similar means of navigation are used in both types of homing, and furthermore that if we knew how a bird finds its way home when shipped 1000 miles from its nest, we should be in a better position to explain annual migratory flights of similar extent. Many other animals have migrations comparable 15</page><page sequence="2">16 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY in length and difficulty to those of birds, and some have a pronounced homing ability. But it seems best to limit this discussion to the birds, where the phenomenon has reached its greatest development and where it has been most studied. Several review papers have discussed the homing of birds, one of the earliest being Claparede's "La facultM d'orientation lointaine," published in 1903. Watson and Lashley (1915), Warner (1931), and Schuiz (1931) have reviewed the literature; and there have been partial reviews by Mayr (1937), Alexander (1938), and Thompson (1936 and 1939). But several papers have appeared recently and certain theoretical problems can now be formu- mulated more clearly. Some homing ability has been found in almost all birds which have been tested; but different species vary widely in speed of return and in the proportion which return at all. In general, migra- tory species have greater powers of homing than sedentary birds with restricted individual ranges. In practically all homing experiments birds are taken from nests or mates, or at least from breeding areas; for they are much less likely to return to other regions, such as a winter feeding range (Hilprecht, 1935; Riippell and Schifferli, 1939; Odum, 1941; Gillespie, 1930; Sumner and Cobb, 1928). In order to provide a compact and comprehen- sive picture of the homing ability as we know it, the results of the more extensive homing experi- ments on record have been summarized in Table I. The distances are great circle "air lines," dis- regarding natural barriers which, in a few cases, probably necessitated long detours by the re- turning birds. Sometimes only a portion of the birds listed in a paper are included because the remainder were released in poor physical condi- tion or because the data were incomplete. A ques- tion mark indicates that the figure cannot be ascertained from the published record. The ex- perimental conditions were often not good enough to enable prompt recording of all birds which returned, so that the homing performances listed in the table, are minima. In any experiment it is possible that a larger proportion of the birds re- turned, and that some may have flown home faster than the records indicate. Table I is not a com- plete summary of the literature, although it con- tains data from more than 1686 transported individuals, exclusive of pigeons. However, to the best of the writer's knowledge, no experi- ments have been- omitted unless they involve extremely short distances, very few returns, small numbers of birds, or the publication of incomplete data as to speed and percentage of returns. There is considerable variability in speed and percentage of returns, both of which are important criteria of homing ability. With some birds, such as herring gulls, this is partly due to weather con- ditions (Griffin, 1943; Woodcock, 1940a, 1940b); but this explanation 'may be less applicable to birds which are less dependent upon updrafts. Another fact which should be mentioned is the very poor homing from short distances which has been noted with petrels (Griffin, 1940a), -her- ring gulls (Goethe, 1937; Griffin, 1943), terns (Watson and Lashley, 1915), swallows (Loos, 1907), and even with bats (Griffin, 1940b). This may be an important clue to the sensory basis of homing-it might, for instance, mean that there was a relatively constant time required for orienta- tion, an interval which is independent of the dis- tance-but to date there is no satisfactory ex- planation for the fact that several species seem to require little more time to return from 75 to 100 miles than from 10 or 15 miles. Claparede (1903) and Watson and Lashley (1915) list numerous theories to account for the sensory basis of navigation during such feats of homing as those enumerated in Table I. I shall not discuss those such as "telepathy" and "tropisms" which lack experimental support, which did not seem promising to these earlier reviewers, and which have not been seriously advanced since. The explanations which have received most at- tention are critically discussed below under three headings: thzeories involving (1) vision; (2) kinaes- thetic receptors; and (3) postulated magnetic or electrical receptors. In the final section, entitled Discussion and Speculations, an attempt is made to combine several theories, both old and new, into a composite working hypothesis of the sensory basis of homing and migration. THEORIES INVOLVING VISION The hypothesis that the nest or its immediate surroundings are perceived directly (Hachet- Souplet, 1909, 1911) can be ruled out by the dis- tances involved in most of the experiments listed in Table I. Watson and Lashley (1915) have pre- sented evidence that, even under the most favorable circumstances, birds' visual acuity would not per- mit perception of landmarks at more than 100</page><page sequence="3">BIRD NAVIGATION 17 TABLE 1 Homing abilities of various birds SPEED OF RETURRN DISTANCE TOTAL NO.

Furthermore, the altitudes at which birds ordinarily fly and the curvature of the earth's surface limit vision to 100 miles at best.

Thus refraction cannot be called upon to explain the phenomena of homing, although it is always possible to argue that wild migratory birds might have a more extensive visual spectrum than chicks or pigeons. Yet there are some types of homing which can be ascribed, without straining our credulity, to the use of visual cues. All birds wander for con- siderable distances from their nests or from terri- tory which they customarily occupy during the non-breeding seasons. A strong flier may well have become acquainted in this way with a wide area. For instance, Woodcock (1940a, 1942) has given evidence that herring gulls range far out to sea in their daily search for food, especially during thq breeding season. There is no reason to believe that other large birds may not have equally ex- tensive ranges. This area within which a bird may orient itself by means of known visual land- marks is conveniently defined as its "familiar territory." It is indeed difficult to account for the normal daily movements of birds without as- suming an ability to recognize ordinary landmarks and orient themselves thereby. This assumption is in harmony with the relative importance of vision as compared with other senses in the general behavior of birds and with the good pattern dis- crimination which Gundlach (1933) has shown in pigeons. Homing from within a bird's familiar territory thus presents no sensory problems com- parable to those raised by some of the flights out- lined in Table I (in particular the return of Watson and Lashley's terns and Lack and Lockley's shearwaters from release points which were prob- ably outside the range of the species). For this reason no attempt has been made to review here the numerous homing experiments on record in- volving short distances. Where no familiar topographical cues are avail- able, the bird might nevertheless find landmarks useful in the process of orientation. The sun, moon, and stars, or river systems and coastlines might, under some conditions, provide guidance even though they lie outside the bird's familiar territory. This type of visual cue is discussed in the final section of the present paper. Another theory based on vision assumes that when birds are taken outside of their familiar territory they do not fly directly home but make extensive exploratory flights in search of landmarks they have previously seen during migrations or spontaneous wanderings. In one type of explora- tion, which I shall call "radial scattering," each bird is assumed to fly in approximately a straight line in any direction wlhich may take its fancy. This theory seems to have been first advanced by Claparede (1903) who suggested that if one re- leased a large group of birds in unknown territory one might expect them to scatter in all directions like the spokes of a wheel. Only those which happened to head in the general direction of home would eventually enter familiar territory, orient themselves visually and continue directly to their nests (see Fig. 1-solid lines). Under these cir- cumstances one might expect that a rather small percentage of the birds would reach their nests, but that these few would return almrost as rapidly as though they had flown straight home. The percentage of returns would be proportional to the angle subtended at the release point by their familiar territory. (See Claparede (1903) and Roberts (1942) for detailed estimates of the per- centage returns to be expected.) In a second type of exploration it is assumed that the birds fly in a large spiral so that the dis- tance between the successive loops of the spiral is approximately twice the distance at which landmarks could be recognized. If this process were continued long enough, familiar territory would eventually be reached. This type of hypo- thetical behavior for a homing bird might be called "spiral exploration" (see Fig. 1-dotted line). It was first described by Hodge (1894), but it has received little attention in recent years. Where the bird is carried a considerable distance beyond familiar territory the total time required for a return flight should be much greater after spiral exploration than after the radial type, but eventually all the birds flying the spiral course might be expected to return, instead of only those which chanced to take the correct direction in radial scattering. If the bird explored by follow- ing the most efficient spiral course, the approxi- mate total distance can be expressed by the following equation: ir2 D =-p + D1 R where: R = distance between the loops of the spiral D = total distance flown DU = air line distance 'from release point to nearest familiar territory</page><page sequence="5">BIRD NAVIGATION 19 V, = distance from edge of familiar territory to home. (See Fig. 1 for graphic representation of these quantitites.) In very long homing flights the time of return should, if the bird is using spiral exploration, vary approximately as the square of the total distance. But it is important to note that this relationship holds only if D. is large relative to R and Df. Actually no bird is likely to follow so simple a path as either of those described above, and we might expect some sort of a mixture of the two- such as initial scattering for a few miles followed by spiraling or vice versa. Topography would no doubt influence the bird's spiraling, and it would not be necessary for it to survey every square mile of unknown territory. In fact, a third type of exploration, theoretically the most efficient of all, would be an extremely large spiral in which R (the distance between the loops) was approxi- mately equal to the diameter of the bird's familiar territory (Df). For the bird need not seek a point, as the simple theory of spiral exploration assumes, but rather a large area-the whole expanse of its familiar territory. If a bird could fly such a course, it could return much more rapidly than predicted by the above calculation. But the navigational problem of flying in these large spirals would be, in itself, a' difficult one for which to find a sensory basis. Birds often fly in small circles near the point of release, but the large scale spiraling required by this theory has never been observed. Perhaps the most credible theory of homing by exploration would involve a radial scattering upon which might be superimposed detours related to topography and some small scale circling or spiraling such as is often observed immediately after a bird's release. Many of the homing ex- periments on record have yielded results which are quite compatible with such a theory of ex- ploration. The first prerequisite of such compati- bility is either a low percentage of returns or an average homing speed far below the bird's ordinary FR (SOLID LINES) AND SP,AL EXPLORATION (DOTTED LINES) S * / LEAS I a ~ ~ i * a~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~~ FiG, 1.

Secondly, if birds are finding their way by exploration, they should home much faster from within their familiar territory than from points outside of it. A third test is to re- capture birds which have already returned from a release point outside of their familiar territory and then set them free again in the same region. If familiarity with visual landmarks is an important aid to homing, the birds shipped a second time to the same release point should return faster and in higher percentages. Finally, if it were possible to trace the actual route followed by homing birds, this would constitute a critical test of the explora- tion hypothesis. If birds consistently fly straight home from points, well outside of familiar territory, they cannot be merely exploring for known visual landmarks. There is a considerable body of experimental evidence in the literature which supports the ex- ploration hypothesis. For instance, Riviere (1923) states that he believes from long experience that racing pigeons home primarily by using visual landmarks. In discussing the mysterious faculties which various authors have proposed, he writes "Every pigeon racer will agree that were one to credit untrained pigeons with any such instinct, one would rapidly lose them.... Even with training only five pigeons out of a hundred can be got to negotiate successfully a distance of five hundred miles." Most other pigeon racers agree that vision plays a very important part in pigeons' homing ability (see Watson and Lashley, 1915). Rabaud (1928), Riviere (1929), Schneider (1905-06), and Gundlach (1932) have reported cases where pigeons were evidently scattering at random from a release point in strange territory. The clearest example is from France (Rabaud, 1928; also quoted by Warner, 1931): ". . . Out of 1500 pigeons released at 312 miles (at sea), 300 returned at the end of 48 hours; the others were found scattered everywhere, in England, Spain, Portugal, Algeria, Cape Verde, Egypt and in the Caucasus ... one conceives ... of birds wandering at hazard and finally encountering some landmark which puts them on their way." Other cases where pigeons may have been flying a spiral course are described by Hodge (1894), Dusolier (1903), and Anonymous (1873). Dusolier writes that releases of pigeons at great distances result in: "enormous losses, first returns at the end of 15 to 20 days ... beyond 625 miles the results which pigeons give one are very uncertain; the time required for return (when they do return) is not proportional to the distance but in general because of the difficulties of orientation it follows an enormously more rapid progression; 625 miles can with difficulty be covered in a day, for 940 miles 15 days are required, for 1250 a month is needed...." Gundlach (1932) also believes that an initial radial scattering is followed by "a course that is on the average reducible to an ever widening spiral (as long as the pigeon is in strange territory)." In Fig. 2 are plotted the percentage returns and the average speeds for the five most extensive series of homing experiments with wild birds which are on record. The total number of birds repre- sented in this figure is 996, and all points are averages for at least 10 individuals, except that there were only two terns in the 600-800 mile group from the experiments of Watson and Lashley. With all of these birds, (terns, gulls, petrels, and starlings) the data are consistent with the theory of radial scattering. The speed of return shows no clear trend except for an increase of speed up to 100 miles, whereas the percentage of returns decreases with increasing distance of shipment. The noddy and sooty terns shipped by Watson and Lashley (1915) to various distances from the Dry Tortugas, near Key West, Florida, were all released at sea or on the coast, outside the normal, range of the species. Schuiz (1931) and Gundlach (1932) have pointed out that these terns had ample time to follow coastlines or to do considerable aimless wandering. Those released at Galveston, Texas (855 miles), for instance, could have wan- dered along the coastline in either direction and eventually reached territory which they had visited before in the course of their migrations. Terns are rapid fliers and can cover three hundred miles per day (Griffin, 1943), so that only the very first returns need necessarily have flown home at all directly. These could have been usitig a modification of the radial type of explora- tion described above. Common terns (Griffin, 1943) returned from as far as 456 miles, but the percent returning dropped with distance (see Fig. 2), and the per- formance was consistently worse from unfamiliar territory than from points along the birds' normal migration route. Herring gulls (Goethe, 1937; and Griffin, 1943) also homed well from as far as 872 miles.

Gulls and terns were released on both sides of the narrow isthmus separating the Bay of Fundy from the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Both species rettirned somewhat faster and in greater numbers from the side of this isthmus, nearest to their home-the side on which the coastline would offer better guidance. On the whole, these data from terns and gulls suggest exploration for familiar landmarks. Petrels (Griffin, 1940a) have returned from dis- tances up to 470 miles at sea, but the percent re- turning decreased with distance, and the speeds were so low (average 28 miles per day) that the birds would have had ample time for exploration (see Fig. 2). The time of return seemed to vary approximately as a linear function of the distance; and this fact, plus the&amp;drop in per cent returning from the longer shipments, fits the predictions of the radial exploration hypothesis. Ruippell (1934, 1935, 1936, 1937, 1938) has con- ducted extensive homing experiments with starlings, swallows, and other species of small land birds which show less homing ability. Riippell used larger numbers of individual birds and a greater diversity of species-than any other worker in this field; and his papers mark the beginning of the recent trend toward large scale experiments with wild birds. Somewhat fewer of Ruppell's starlings returned from areas through which they did not migrate than from release points to the south of their nests. The average number of miles covered by Ruppell's starlings per day(about 30) is little more than a starling can fly per hour, so that they may have deviated considerably from the true course towards home. The relationship between speed, percent returns and distance of shipment for Ruppell's starlings is consistent with the theoiy of exploration by radial scattering (see Fig. 2). Riuppell also conducted homing experiments with swallows; and they can best be summarized in tabular form (Table 2). Some of the more distant release points (London, 563 miles; and Madrid, 1160 miles) were almost certainly outside the previous range of these indi- vidual swallows. Yet these birds can fly 60 m.p.h. for a short time at least, so that the distance covered per day would account for only three to five hours of flying time provided they had flown home in a straight line at their normal flying speed. In no case was the percentage of returns from a considerable distance anywhere near 100 per cent, ahtd at the 1100 mile points it had dropped to: 20 per cent. The speed of return was independent of distance. Both starlings and swallows may have returned faster or in greater numbers than were recorded, for observations at the nest were not con- tinuous, but it is not safe to assume that such un- recorded returns would alter the conclusions. If Ruippell's swallows were familiar with a band of territory extending southwest along their migra- tion route (see Neithammer, 1937), these returns could be explained by assuming radial or spiral exploration or a combination of the two. But a difficulty with this explanation lies in the fact that if they could recognize territory along their migration route they should home faster and in TABLE 2.

Yet only a part of Rtippell's data shows such an effect, and he has concluded that both starlings and swallows must have an undefined Riclztungssinn or sense of direction. Ruppell (1938) also attempted a homing experi- ment with starlings raised in captivity. The birds were captured as nestlings, and raised to maturity in cages. They then nested and raised their own young in captivity. During incubation several of the adult breeding birds were taken from their nests and eggs, and released at about 70 miles. Despite a careful watch no returns were seen in the vicinity of the "home" cages. The only part of Riippell's results which is clearly inconsistent with a theory of exploration by scattering is the recovery of three starlings en route quite close to the true course home (see below). Loos (1907) and Wodzicke and Wojtusiac (1934) have also reported homing experiments with</page><page sequence="9">BIRD NAVIGATION 23 swallows, but most of the distances were less than 100 miles; and the results were essentially similar to those described by Ruppell. Wodzicke, Puchalski, and Liche (1938) sent storks from Poland S.E. as far as Palestine. Their speed of return did not diminish with distance as predicted by the exploration hypothesis, but the birds may have been familiar with the route from previous migrations. The data have not been published in full. The homing experiments reported by Dircksen (1932), Goethe (1937), Lack and Lockley (1938), and the others listed in Table I did not involve enough individuals to test the quantitative speed- distance predictions of the exploration theory; but in all save one or two cases (see below) the birds returned at such low average speeds that they could have deviated considerably from a true course home. While the results of all the homing experiments described above can in general be considered con- sistent with the exploration theory, there are other instances where it seems definitely insufficient. For instance, the distance of shipment of racing pigeons is sometimes increased suddenly from 500 to 1000 miles, and the birds which return from such flights cannot have used visual landmarks during the first half of the return flight. Riviere (1923) reports that one pigeon returned 501 miles in one day (49 m.p.h.) although it had been trained over but 80 miles of the route. Oordt (1929) de- scribes cases in which pigeons which had pre- viously returned from 375 miles east of their home were released 300-375 miles to the south, and yet were able to home with the same speed. In almost all cases where racing pigeons are suddenly carried to greater distances than ever before, they are released in large flocks where the inexperienced birds may follow those which have flown the course before. It is not stated whether this was the case with most of the records cited above. However, Thauzies (1910) reports that 62 pigeons were released at 210 and 265 miles without any previous training at or near the release points. Practically all came home, within 5 hours to 4 days, the great majority returning during the day follow- ing their release. The exact extent of their previous training and familiar territory is not stated, but it would have to be large to explain these results on the basis of exploration. Gund- lach (1932) reports exactly the opposite phenome- non-when birds trained on a north-south course were carried 100 miles west (across a mountain range) they returned very slowly and several were lost. But in this case the mountains, rather than difficulties of orientation, may have been responsi- ble for the poor homing. Petrels (which are strictly marine birds) seem to have returned directly over 18 miles of land rather than follow a much longer salt-water route, although the evidence for this is scanty and unsatis- factory (Griffin, 1940a). Such an overland short- cut by petrels could scarcely be the result of ex- ploration. Also, there is the case of a shearwater, reported by Lack and Lockley (1938), which would have had little time for exploration while it was returning from Venice to Wales in 14 days (over 260 miles per day, assuming that it followed the water, or 68 miles per day if it flew across coun- try over the Alps, a most unlikely feat for a strictly marine bird like the shearwater). This record is all the more remarkable since the Mediterranean is probably outside the range of this sub-species of shearwater. Clearly the best way to appraise the importance of exploration would be to actually trace the route followed from release point to home. If the majority follow essentially a straight line or detour only for topographical reasons, then they cannot be merely exploring-they must have some specific sensory cue to the correct bearing of home. In most homing experiments the birds scatter in all directions from the release point and show little or no tendency to take the correct direction, at least until after they are out of sight. However, there are a few recoveries or observations en route which indicate the actual course followed by homing birds. Gibault (1930) reports that 39 pigeons were trained.only in the vicinity of their loft and then released at 118, 138, and 188 miles. The returns were rather few; 13 came back to the home loft at speeds ranging from 15 miles per hour to 18 miles per day. But of the 26 which did not return 6 were reported from other lofts which they visited in the course of their search for home. All of these six recoveries were within 450 of a straight course. Rtippell (1937) cites three cases in which his starlings were retaken en route, and none of them showed any important deviation from a straight course. One of these three starlings had been shipped 500 miles directly south and was within the winter range (familiar territory?) of birds breeding near its home (Neithammer, 1937).</page><page sequence="10">24 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY Another bird had been set free 200 miles E.S.E., probably outside of familiar territory, since the birds migrate S.W. in fall, but it may have returned by following the valley of the Elbe on which both home and release point were situated. The third starling, however, was shipped 251 miles N.E. and released in all probability in strange territory where no landmarks were available. In neither Gibault's nor Ruppell's experiments is there any indication that these results are due to a more intense search for recoveries along the true course than in any other direction. Eight herring gulls have been traced for five miles or more of their return route by observation from hilltops and from airplanes (Griffin, 1943). Five of these were released in central Massachu- setts, 100 miles or less from their home colony; and they may well have been able to find familiar territory rather quickly. The behavior of the first bird, released at Grafton, Mass., and followed for 37 miles, suggests random searching for familiar landmarks. This bird flew downwind for the better part of an hour, flying in circles with much zig-zagging until it came within sight of the ocean. From this point on it headed directly towards the salt water until it was lost to view near the shore- line. Two birds released at Orange, Mass., drifted downwind, which happened to be in exactly the direction of home. Two others flew due south from Orange, deviating 450 from the true course. Two gulls released a few miles south of Montreal, in unfamiliar territory, 290 miles from home, headed directly away fromn home for 5 to 7 miles or as 'far as they could be kept under observation. Finally, a bird released on Lake Erie stopped for at least three days at Toronto (on Lake Ontario) while returning to it's nest on the coast of Massa- chusetts. (This bird was observed by Mr. and Mrs. J. M. Spiers who knew nothing of the experiment at the time but later furnished a sufficiently ac- curate description of the paint marks on the bird that it could be identified with certainty.) Its deviation from a true course was 450, but the long delay at Toronto may indicate that it traveled fairly straight when it was actually moving. It is clear that many more return routes of indi- vidual birds must be traced by direct observation or by recoveries en route before this question can finally be settled. Exploration may play an im- portant part -in the homing of many birds, par- ticularly when speed or per cent returns are low; but it does not seem capable of accounting for all the recorded cases. THEORIES INVOLVING KINAESTHETIC RECEPTORS Kinaesthetic theories of the sensory basis of homing have been advanced by Exner (1893, 1905), Bonnier (1903), and Meise (1933). When carried away from the nest, even in a closed box, the bird is continually being stimulated by pres- sures and accelerations imparted to his body by the box. All these accelerations may arouse pro- prioceptive, kinaesthetic, and inner- ear labyrinth sensations. Theoretically a bird might be able to deduce from these sensations the general direc- tion in which he was carried, but it seems incredible that he could remember every twist and turn of a long journey. Furthermore, birds have been transported under anaesthesia or in continually rotated cages, and have returned as well as un- treated controls (Exner, 1893, 1895; Kluijver, 1935; Griffin, 1940a, 1943). However, these rotation and anaesthesia experiments have been done only in cases where the birds were released in territory with which they may have been familiar, and from which they could perhaps re- turn by means of visual landmarks or by exploration. Rotation or anaesthesia experiments have yet to be done under conditions where one could be certain that the birds did not orient themselves by exploration. Exner's pigeons and Ruppell's or Kluijver's starlings were all released less than 100 miles from their nests. Four rotated herring gulls released at 240 miles did not show any significant increase in homing time (GriAin, 1943); but their average homing speed was but a small fraction of their known velocity of flight, indicating that both experiments and controls may have been homing by exploration. The petrels which the writer (1940a) rotated during part of their trans- portation to sea may have located the coastline by such general landmarks as the direction of the rising sun, and found their particular island by means of known visual landmarks along the coast. Sobol (1930) and Huizinga (1935) have reported that pigeons whose semicircular canals have been injured or destroyed can still home as well as normal controls. However, the birds were shipped only 25 miles or less, so that both controls and experimentals may have been usinig visual landmarks. Thus the kinaesthetic theories cannot be said</page><page sequence="11">BIRD NAVIGATION 25 to be completely disproved, but the accuracy and complexity of kinaesthetic or labyrinth memory required are so extreme that the hypothesis cannot be seriously considered unless direct supporting evidence is produced in the future. THEORIES INVOLVING POSTULATED MAGNETIC AND ELECTRICAL RECEPTORS Various theories of orientation by means of a postulated magnetic sense have been much dis- cussed in the scientific literature on the homing instinct (1) Viguier, 1882; (2) Caustier, 1893; (3) Thauzies, 1898, 1904, 1910, 1913; (4) Maurain, 1926; (5) Casamajor, 1926, 1927; (6) Stressmann, 1935; (7) Daanje, 1936 and 1941. A simple mag- netic compass would not aid the bird without some cue as to the direction in which its home was located. Furthermore no sensitivity to a magnetic field has been demonstrated in any animal, and sensitivity to as weak a field as the earth's is made extremely unlikely by the fact that living tissues are not known to contain any of the very few ferrimagnetic substances (such as metallic iron, magnetic iron oxide or magnetite, nickle and cobalt) which alone are capable of exerting appreci- able mechanical forces in the earth's -magnetic field. The more complex theory Qf Viguier (1882) in- volving sensitivity to differences in dip and in- tensity of the earth's magnetic field requires an extremely low threshold to such fields. A further fundamental weakness in Viguier's theory is that the lines of equal dip (inclination) of the earth's field and the (isodynamic) lines of equal intensity (isodynamic lines) both run roughly parallel to the earth's equator, so that even if a bird were sensitive to both of them it would not have a grid of intersecting lines to guide it as Viguier suggests. The dip and intensity are the only known variables of the earth's magnetic field which could come into play (declination is the difference between the true and the magnetic north-a meaningless quantity, of course, unless the bird could take sights on the north star!). Nor do any birds move rapidly enough to in- duce, while flying through the earth's field, voltages known to be capable of stimulating any living tissue (see also Maurain, 1926). Attempts (un- published) to train 3 homing pigeons to respond to a magnetic field were entirely negative, although the field used was of considerably greater intensity than the earth's field. Even after as many as 570 trials there was no evidence of response to the magnetic field, although under the same condi- tions the birds could learn to respond to light in 20 to 70 trials and to a draft of air in about 50 trials. There would be a very slight tendency for the dipolar molecules throughout a bird's body to orient in the earth's magnetic field, and conceiv- ably some extraordinarily delicate chemical equilib- rium might be upset by changes in the direction of this tendency to orient. Furthermore, it is conceivable that there are particles in animal tissues which act as "magnetic ions," such as those described by Ehrenhaft and Banet (1-942). These possibilities are admittedly far-fetched, but failing other solutions of the problem of bird navigation, those interested should watch for de- velopments along such lines in the physical chem- istry of biological substances. There has recently been much rumor in popular publications about interference with the homing of pigeons and the migrations of wild birds by radio stations (Brown, 1938; Casamajor, 1927,; Darling, 1940; Aymar, 1935; and Maurain, 1926). The writer knows of no statistically significant data supporting such opinions, and it seems ap- propriate to neglect them until they are ade- quately tested. DISCUSSION AND SPECULATION After reviewing the experimental evidence de- rived from artificial homing experiments, it seems clear that many of the observed phenomena of homing are consistent with the assumption that birds merely explore until they find familiar vistial landmarks; but in other cases this hypothesis re- quires a good many extenuating explanations or appeals to coincidence. The principal evidence against exploration as the sole basis of homing is (1) that in some cases birds seem to return from totally strange, territory too rapidly to have devi- ated far from a straight line course and in too high percentages to be accounted for by radial scatter- ing; and (2) that a few homing birds have been recovered en route fairly close to the straight course home. Although birds deprived of kinaesthetic cues by rotation or anaesthesia during transpor- tation have homed as well as untreated controls, this does not necessarily disprove the kinaesthetic theory; for in all such experiments recorded to date, the birds may have found their way home by</page><page sequence="12">26 THE QUARTJgRLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY meaps of exploration and visual landmarks. The chief argument for the kinaesthetic theories as well as the magnetic and radio-electric theories is the failure of others to account for all the ob- served facts. Theories of homing are thus of two sorts, those postulating new and unknown senses, usually involving magnetism or electricity; and those as- suming that the birds have approximately the same sensory equipment as ourselves. The second type assumes that the bird merely makes better use of cues available to birds and men alike. The first group, including the magnetic theories, has received serious attention only because the second has seemed entirely inadequate. This abandon- ment of known senses may have been premature, however, for there are certain theoretical explana- tions of homing, other than those discussed above, which do not require that one postulate unknown receptors. They are based on the assumption that birds use combinations of sensations from known Teceptors. Although first suggested long ago, these theories are generally overlooked, and it seems worthwhile to restate them in the light of recent experimental data. An attempt will be made below to outline three general types of ex- planation which seem promising, and to suggest how each theory might be tested. Celestial landmarks Birds might know that the direction of sunrise and sunset were related to the geography of the area in which they were released, an idea suggested long ago by Romanes for insects, and subsequently substantiated by Wolf (1927). For instance, the gulls', terns, and petrels which I have shipped in- land and to sea, respectively, might know that the sun set towards shore and rose towards the open ocean. If so, and if they are capable of flying in approximately a straight line for long periods, they could return by this method towards the coastline, much of which is probably familiar territory. Aside from the use of inner ear receptors, a straight- line course might be maintained by means of Fyind direction, direction of wave movement, or of topography. There is some question as to how a bird could detect the direction of the wind while in flight. Aside from visual judgment of drift and the movement of waves and vegetation when the bird is flying near the ground, there may be gusts and irregularities in the wind which would be per- ceptable as accelerations imparted to its body. (See Williams, 1930, p. 383.) Of course a uniform flow would not be felt by a bird flying within it, for all his motion is relative to the air. Thus a Massachusetts herring gull released at Chicago might be influenced by the direction of sunrise to fly east overland from Lake Michigan, keeping to this direction by reference to the wind. On reaching Lake Erie it might follow this shore- line and that of Lake Ontario or other lakes and rivers to reinforce the sunrise or sunset cues until familiar territory was reached. Cloudy weather would of course make the use of the sun's direction quite impossible (and neither migration nor homing requires clear skies). But celestial landmarks might, in the course of the various homing experiments on record, have carried a large proportion of the birds to familiar territory. Releases at different times of the day, on cloudy days and on clear days, and relecs3s across an isthmus into an entirely unknown ocean might furnish critical tests of this theory. An accumulation of direct observations of return routes from the air would also eventually support or disprove this hypothesis. It is reported that pigeons home poorly on cloudy days, and in pigeon races the birds are al- most always released early in the morning. A pigeon racing club customarily ships all its birds in the same direction regardless of the length of the race. This procedure has proved empirically to produce the most rapid return flights with fewest losses, and it may do so partly because it is the best routine to teach birds that the course towards home bears a definite relationship to the position of the rising sun. Atmospheric conditions There is a possible relationship between birds and the weather conditions which, although it is still merely a matter for speculation, may prove to be of great importance. Birds might react to such phenomenon as prevailing winds and the char- acteristics of air masses. These are aspects of the environment bearing a certain relation to geog- raphy. This idea is not new (Toussenel, 1853; Cathelin, 1910; Drost, 1929; McCriary, 1934), but recent advances in meteorology enable one to advance concrete proposals capable of test. Consider, for example, the writer's homing ex- periments with herring gulls (1943). Except for very exceptional weather, the area of the experi- ments (northeastern United States) is always</page><page sequence="13">BIRD NAVIGATION 27 covered by one of four or five distinct air masses. These air masses, as recognized by meteorologists, differ in the region of their origin, in their tem- perature and humidity, and in the rate of change of these two elements with altitude. Temperature and possibly humidity could be perceived by the birds, and there is even a remote possibility that dust, pollen content, or other factors rmight enable them to distinguish such different air mlasses as "Polar continental" and "Tropical gulf." There is a certain regularity in the alterna- tion of warm and cold air masses in the north- eastern United States. They are separated by zones of rapid temperature change known as "fronts," and clouds of rather distinct types often occur along such fronts. These air masses and fronts almost always move in an easterly direction. In other words, the prevailing winds of this area are westerlies, the east winds being for the most part local or of short duration. At altitudes above 1000 feet the pr'evalence of westerlies is even more pronounced than at the ground. There is a further constancy to these common types of air mass movement. South and southwesterly winds commonly mean warm, moist air flowing from the south, while northwest and north winds are usually associated with an arrival of cold dry "Polar con- tinental" air. The first type is usually stable (poor soaring), while the second is likely to in- volve convection updrafts which facilitate the flight of soaring birds such as gulls. In addition to the wind direction, the direction of arrival of certain cloud types might afford cues to the direc- tion of movement of air masses. It does not seem unlikely that herring gulls living on the Atlantic coast of the United States might know that cold winds with strong convec- tion usually come from a direction perpendicular to the coastline (N.W. winds), and that a humid, stable air mass usually moves parallel to the coast- line or obliquely toward it (S.W. winds). If this should be the case, the birds would have a useful cue to the direction of their home even when re- leased far inland in totally strange surroundings. It is obvious that the same sort of relationship could easily occur in other areas, especially in the lower latitudes where one encounters trade winds of great constancy. Possible tests of this hypothesis lie in the study of dat4 from homing experiments under various weather conditions, perferably with direct ob- sprvation of the actual return route. For ex- ample, if a cold air mass is traveling in a totally abnormal direction (as sometimes happens) would birds be led astray? Ecological cues Another source of geographical cues for homing birds would be an ability to identify various large areas by their climate, appearance from the air, their topography, flora, or fauna. Birds might recognize the relationship of these areas to terri- tory around their home. When released inland they might tend always to fly downstream as soon as they found a watercourse. They might con- ceivably recognize areas of characteristic vegeta- tion such as (in the case of gulls from Massa- chusetts) evergreen forests of the Canadian zone, or hardwoods of the Upper Austral and Transition zones. They might have had previous experience with the relationship of such vegetation types to the ocean, to the direction of sunrise or sunset, or to the prevailing movements of characteristic air masses. Some of the gulls mentioned above might have previously flown inland, upwind, in a cold unstable air mass to the evergreen forests and lakes with a Canadian zone fauna and flora. All these elements are well within the range of a gull's perception. If suddenly released from a closed box in totally unfamiliar territory of the same ecological type, in a similar air mass, might the bird not return by soaring downwind just as it had previously done in the course of its natural wanderings? This type of orientation has little chance to operate when the birds are taken into totally strange environments, as when Atlantic coast herring gulls are released on the Great Lakes or Welsh shearwaters are set free at Venice or in the Swiss Alps. But there have been relatively few successful returns from such releases, and geo- graphical relationships may well be important clues for birds in homing from 100 to 300 miles release points, even if returns from very long dis- tances must be explained otherwise. One can reasonably assume without postulating unknown senses that birds with a pronounced homing ability can do at least some of the follow- ing: (1) fly in approximately a straight line for long distances (using wind direction, visual land- marks such as topography, sun or stars, and also perhaps their inner ear labyrinth); (2) orient themselves by visual memory of landmarks when they reach familiar territory; (3) know that inland</page><page sequence="14">28 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY from a familiar coastline may mean toward sunset or toward sunrise; (4) know that streams run toward the coastline; (5) know that certain vegetation types are found in definite directions from their homes; (6) realize that the prevailing winds, es- pecially above 1000-2000 feet may blow from land to ocean or vice yersa; and that cold dry air with good soaring usually comes from one direc- tion while moist, warm stable air comes from another. If none of these cues were available, the birds might explore for landmarks, using either of the two types of exploration described above. (The words "know" and "realize" are used here, without intending any anthropomorphic connota- tions,1 to mean that birds probably react to these relationships so as to orient themselves correctly in their flight home.) If these possible cues to the direction of the goal are considered individually each one can be proved inadequate for some cases. Con- versely, there are few if any homing experi- ments which cannot be explained by assuming the, operation of one of the processes described above. Pending the very desirable direct testing of these hypotheses, or the suggestion of others, their single or joint use by homing birds seems to be a reasonable working hypothesis. Any or all of the cues described in this section could equally Well be used during migration. For instance, the habits of the common tern in Eastern North America might be stated as an "instinct," in the meaning defined by Lashley (1938), to fly quartering downwind along the coastline in late summer during clear cool days with strong con- vection (Polar continental air mass with NW winds). This habit would also involve flying upwind on the humid overcast days with smooth air when southerly winds are prevalent. Topo- graphical features along the Atlantic coastline might also be important sensory cues to guide the migration. When the latitudes of the trade winds were reached, one would have to assume that the behavior pattern changed to one of flying cross wind. This hypothetical case is obviously a great over-simplification-but it should serve to illustrate'the fact that adequate sensory cues of the sort discussed, above are probably available to migrating birds. There has been considerable study of the cor- relations between the time of migratory flights and the prevailing weather conditions (Thompson, 1926); but little attention has been paid to the possibility that conditiohs within certain-air masses could afford cues to guide the direction of a bird's flight. Drost (1939) has already shown that winter movements (Zwischenziige) of birds along the coast of Germany were closely correlated with the type of air mass present. When warm air masses cov- ered the area the birds moved a short distance north-eastward (in the direction of their normal spring migration). Conversely, cold air masses produced large flights to the southwest. Mc- Creary (1934) has reported a case in which atypi- cal wind directions during May resulted in an al- tered migration route of several small land birds. Much more could probably be learned by addi- tional comparisons of available migration data with an adequate series of properly analyzed weather maps. Direct observation of homing and migrat- ing birds from the air is already possible, and it will probably be facilitated by post-war improve- ments in light airplanes and helicopters. It seems reasonable to expect rapid advances in the study of migration when such direct observations are cor- related with air mass meteorology and the present accumulation of ornithological records. Many will be skeptical that birds could make use of the geographical cues discussed above to per- form long and successful migrations without older birds to guide them. This is admittedly a puz- zling problem, especially in the case of young birds making their first migration unaided by adults, but one should consider that birds spend their life in the air, and that topography and atmospheric conditions are probably perceived with- the com- pelling simplicity of everyday experiences. The first migration of a young bird may be no more difficult to explain than the inherited ability of a bird (or spider) without previous experience to build an -intricate nest whose size and shape is characteristic of the species. SUMMARY 1) The literature on artificial homing experi- ments with wild birds and racing pigeons is criti- cally reviewed. All of the experiments involving long distances and reasonably large numbers of birds are summarized in Table I. This table shows species, distance of shipment, number of birds involved, percent returns, and average speed. 2) Several theoretical explanations of the sen- sory basis of homing are discussed together with the evidence pro and con.</page><page sequence="15">BIRD NAVIGATION 29 3) It is concluded that many, but not all, of the homing experiments on record could be explained by assuming that when released in unfamiliar ter- ritory the birds scatter at random and explore until they find familiar landmarks. 4) There is no direct evidence to support the kinaesthetic theories, which assume that the birds remember the direction in which they were trans- ported by means of sensations derived from the mechanical accelerations imparted to their bodies during transportation. In several experiments birds have been transported under anaesthesia or rotated en route with no resulting impairment of their h@ining ability. However, in all of these experiments the homing performance of both ex- perimentals and controls could have been achieved by exploration so that these experiments may not have been testing the kinaesthetic theory at all. 5) The various theories assuming sensitivity to the earth's magnetic field or to electric fields or to electromagnetic radiations are supported by little or no experimental evidence. The chief argument in their favor seems to be the lack of any other satisfactory explanation of the sensory basis of homing and migration. 6) In speculating about the methods birds might use to find their way home from unfamiliar terri- tory, three generally overlooked, types of cue seem worthy of attention: (a) Birds might know the relationship between geographical features such as river systems and coastlines near their home and the direction of sun- rise, of sunset, or conceivably of other celestial landmarks. (b) Typical air masses may be recognizable by birds, and the prevailing winds within them are often sufficiently constant to serve, in conjunction with topography, as a very useful cue to the direc- tion of a bird's home. (c) A homing bird may be aware of the relation- ship between the territory familiar to it and other ecological and topographical regions, such as river systems, coastlines, vegetation types, or faunal zones. This would permit such types of orienta- tion as a sea bird familiar with the coastline flying downstream to known coastal landmarks when released in unfamiliar inland territory. 7) The combined use of familiar landmarks, to- gether with simple geographical, meteorological, and ecological relationships such as those described above seems more reasonable as an explanation of migration and homing than the postulation of a new sense organ. This paper is part of a thesis submitted to the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, Harvard Uni- versity, in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, June, 1942.
