<plain_text><page sequence="1">Walter Br?cker: Die Geschichte der Philosophie vor Sokrates. Frankfurt: Klostermann 1965. 119 S. To write a comprehensible history of philosophy before Socrates in a mere 120 pages is a formidable undertaking. Br?cker's book consists of sixteen chapters varying in length from the two pages he spends on Anaxi menes to the twenty-three he devotes to Heraclitus, and it deals with the whole period from Tha?es to the Sophists. He includes a fair number of the extant fragments in translation and he comments on the more important textual problems in brief notes. Naturally, in a book of this length, it is impossible to cover the subject fully. B. explains in his preface that he deliberately omits much of what belongs rather to the history of science, preferring to concentrate attention on what he considers philosophically important in the Presocratics' thought. But to apply this distinction is, of course, less easy than it sounds. As is well known, the Presocratics themsel ves did not clearly distinguish between different types of philosophical and scientific inquiry, and while this does not prevent us from applying such distinctions to their work, we must always do so with caution. Thus B. may be justified in dismissing the bulk of Pythagorean work in music, for example, as irrelevant to his purposes, but it must be remembered that for the Pythagoreans themselves the study of music was not only part of science but had an ethical significance as well. Indeed if we reflect that one of the main themes that runs through Presocratic thought, the develop ment of the problem of change, is as much a part of natural science as it is of philosophy, it is just as well that B. does not, in practice, attempt to apply his distinction too strictly.</page><page sequence="2">650 G. E. R. Lloyd: Br?cker, Geschichte der Philosophie vor Sokrates B.'s account of the Presocratics is necessarily highly compressed, but he promises, in his preface, to throw new light on the ancient texts. It is certainly true that he expresses a number of theses that are largely or even entirely original, but it must be pointed out that several of these are open to grave doubts. To begin with, the reader may be surprised to find two separate chapters devoted to 'Xenophanes I5 and 'Xenophanes IP, the first before the chapter on Heraclitus, the second after that on Melissus. Having discussed the author of the anti-anthropomorphic religious poems collected in Diels-Kranz in the former chapter, B. returns, in the latter, to deal with the Xenophanes who is the subject of the account in pseudo Aristotle De Melisso, Xenophane, Gorgia, and he points out where the ideas attributed to Xenophanes in that work (e. g. the thesis that God is neither moved nor unmoved, 977 b 9f) are incompatible with those ex pressed in the extant fragments. Having distinguished a 'Xenophanes P from a 'Xenophanes IP, B. describes the latter as an eclectic who combined elements from the theology of Xenophanes I, the ontology of Parmenides and the dialectic of Zeno, although he goes on to say that if, in his old age, Xenophanes came under the influence of the Eleatic school, then 'Xeno phanes IP may be identical with 'Xenophanes P. But the assumption on which this whole argument rests is that the report in De MXG is trust worthy, and this is not conclusively proved (though it may be suggested) by the fact that the account of Melissus is quite accurate. If we reflect that (1) some of the theses in the De Xenophane clearly do correspond to the fragments of Xenophanes, and (2) there is no independent evidence that would suggest either that there were two Presocratic philosophers both called Xenophanes, or that the Xenophanes we know drastically modified his conception of God in at least one important respect towards the end of his life under the influence of Eleatic dialectic, then the hypothesis that we have in De MXG is merely a rather garbled account of what was in the poems of Xenophanes provides not only a simpler, but also a more plausi ble, explanation of the inconsistencies between De MXG and the rest of our evidence. B. also distinguishes chronologically between an early and a late Empedocles. In his chapter 'Empedocles I5 (before that on Parmenides) he deals with the 'Purifications5. Here he takes Fr 115 as the key fragment and maintains that only what agrees with the teaching of that fragment belongs to the 'Purifications5. This leads him to argue that Fr 128 and the doctrine of the Golden Age do not belong to the religious poem but to 'On Nature5. Moreover he believes that the differences between the poems are such that they must come from different periods in Empedocles' life. Again B.'s arguments seem inconclusive. Certainly the Golden Age and the wanderings of the fallen Saifjiovs? cannot be thought of as contempor aneous. But that is no reason to reject the usual view that the two stages followed one another in the same poem (and we have some indication of how Empedocles thought the transition between the two stages was brought about, when he refers to the abstention from blood sacrifice in</page><page sequence="3">G. E. R. Lloyd: Br?cker, Geschichte der Philosophie vor Sokrates 651 Fr 128, and to the pollution of blood in Fr 115). As for B.'s distinction between two different reasons given for vegetarianism (the danger of killing a relative, and the doctrine that all animals and plants are united under the rule of Love) these seem complementary, not contrasting, no tions. Whether the 'Purifications5 as a whole and the poem 'On Nature5 were written at quite different stages in Empedocles' life is a very open question. But B.'s suggestion, that the former represents a period before, the latter one after, Empedocles had come under the influence of Parme nides, seems hard to credit. It is notable that in Fr 115 (which B. holds definitely does belong to the 'Purifications5) earth, water, air and fire are clearly referred to in a group as the four main world-areas, and we must accordingly assume (on B.'s thesis) that Empedocles had already devel oped this doctrine before he had come into contact with Parmenides or had felt the need to counter his monism and denial of change. B. says what he has to say about early Pythagoreanism in his chapter 'Empedocles P. There is no chapter on Pythagoras himself and the Pytha goreans are not otherwise discussed until B.'s penultimate chapter, after he has already dealt with the Atomists. The relation between the different doctrines attributed to the 'Pythagoreans5 and the theories of other Preso cratic philosophers, particularly the Eleatics and the Atomists, is, of course, an extremely complex problem. Having noted that the authenticity of the fragments of Philolaus is disputed, and having dismissed those of Archytas as containing nothing of philosophical interest, B. concentrates, wisely, on setting out the principal evidence in Aristotle. He does, how ever, suggest two quite controversial theses in his comments on that evi dence, (1) that the Pythagorean auaTOL^ia is influenced by the philoso phy of Parmenides, not the other way about, and (2) that the Pythagorean doctrine that things are made of numbers may be a ?Fortbildung? (sic) of the theory of the Atomists. On (1) he believes that the Pythagoreans brought together in a single list two different types of Parmenidean oppos ites, oppositions between the world of being and the world of seeming as a whole, and oppositions within the world of seeming. Yet simply to assert that it is unthinkable that the reverse process took place (that is that Parmenides drew distinctions between oppositions that the Pythagoreans had tended to treat as similar) is hardly going to convince those scholars (and there may be a considerable body of them) who hold that some such view provides just as plausible a solution to the problem. And B. might also, perhaps, have noted how much both the Pythagoreans and Parme nides owe, in their doctrines of opposites, to much older popular beliefs. And on (2) one may remark that the arguments of Zeno are apparently directed against some form of 'unit-point-atom5 theory which must presumably have been proposed a good deal earlier than the developed atomism of Leucippus and Democritus. B.'s two longest chapters are rightly devoted to Heraclitus and Par menides, and in both he includes a high proportion of the extant original fragments. On Heraclitus B. follows in the main a line of interpretation</page><page sequence="4">652 G. E. R. Lloyd: Br?cker, Geschichte der Philosophie vor Sokrates similar to that which has been advocated most forcefully in recent years by G. S. Kirk. B. distrusts the testimony of Plato, and in his comment on the river statement, for example, he stresses that part of the point is that the river itself remains one and the same. Commenting on Heraclitus' doctrine of fire, however, B. suggests (what Kirk among others would deny) that even extinguished fire is still 'essentially5 fire, and here his position seems closer to the interpretation that for Heraclitus all things are constantly changing. On the doctrine of opposites as a whole, we are told that Heraclitus taught the unity of opposites and the idea that 'everything is its own contrary5. But what we need in order to understand what sense these paradoxical theses had for Heraclitus is, of course, a close and careful analysis of the actual examples Heraclitus uses, and especially of the different senses in which different types of opposites are said to be 'one5. And here, unfortunately, B. gives rather short measure. In his concluding remarks on Heraclitus, B. rightly observes that he was no metaphysician. But what one misses from B.'s discussion is a due recognit ion of Heraclitus' great originality and his influence on subsequent Greek philosophy. B.'s treatment of Parmenides is more successful. He includes almost the whole of the 'Way of Truth5 and takes the reader through the main difficul ties in the text with helpful notes. It is perhaps rather rash to speak as if Parmenides not only likened 'what is5 to a well-rounded ball, but actually identified it as such, and it seems positively misleading to equate this with the spherical physical universe, as B. does when he describes the ball's outer surface as the heavens. But in the main B.'s exposition is admirably clear and judicious and his remarks on the relationship between the 'Way of Truth5 and the 'Way of Seeming5 are particularly valuable. Without ascribing anachronistic philosophical distinctions to Parmenides himself, B. demonstrates very clearly where his significance from the point of view of western thought lies. Briefer comments must suffice on some of B.s other theses. Having pointed out that the dictum that everything is full of gods' is attributed to other writers besides Tha?es, B. is nevertheless unduly pessimistic when he concludes that whether or not Tha?es shared this belief, nothing can be inferred from it about his thought. He also dismisses too readily the evidence concerning the magnet having a soul as an isolated explanation of a strange natural phenomenon (and it is quite extraordinary that B. should then describe the phenomenon to be explained as the north-seeking property of the magnet as if the Greeks were aware of that). It is, of course, perfectly reasonable to emphasise that Aristotle's conjectures concerning the motives that may have led Tha?es to postulate water as the ?pyy) are merely conjectures. But when B. concludes that it was more likely to have been from geological considerations than from biological ones that Tha?es was led to this belief, his thesis savours too much of the dogmatic, and one should have thought no longer tenable, view of Burnet when he pronounced that ?in the days of Tha?es, the prevailing interest was not physiological, but meteorological, and it is from this point of view we must try to understand the theory ? (Early Greek Philosophy4, 48). Anaximander's opposites, too, are interpreted as applying primarily to the meteoro logical, not to the biological, sphere, and here B. takes over the conclusion of his Hermes, 1956, 382 ff, article where he argued that Heraclitus Fr 126 (x? ^u^p? &amp;?pEioii . . .) is a quotation from Anaximander and may even be the text of the beginning</page><page sequence="5">H. B. Gottschalk: Theophrast, De lapidibus, ed. Eichholz 653 of Anaximander Fr 1. But this interpretation must be considered at best not proven. Fr 80 suggests that Heraclitus knew and disagreed with Anaximander's notion of 8?xr?. But even though Fr 126 refers to two pairs of opposites and Fr 31, for example, to three substances, fire, sea and earth, there is no contradiction between the teaching of the two fragments, and since Fr 126 expresses a view of the interaction of opposites for which many parallels can be found in Heraclitus (e. g. Fr 88) there seems no good reason to believe that he was there quoting Anaximander. In conclusion this is a book which will stimulate scholars to reconsider many currently accepted beliefs about the Presocratic period. Enough of the original material is presented for the book to serve as an introduction to Presocratic philosophy. Yet the newcomer to the subject must be warned that many of the theses that the book advances are controversial, and it is accordingly particularly regrettable that B. should present them in a highly compressed treatment where it was evidently impracticable to support them with detailed discussion and argument.
