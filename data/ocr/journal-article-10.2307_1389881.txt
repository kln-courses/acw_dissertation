<plain_text><page sequence="1">FOURTH INTERNATIONAL BUDDHIST-CHRISTIAN CONFERENCE Reflections on the Fourth Buddhist-Christian Conference John Berthrong Boston University Buddhist-Christian dialogue now flourishes as never before as a global encoun- ter of two religious traditions. In many respects, the relationship between Bud- dhists and Christians serves as a model for what contemporary interfaith dia- logue can achieve in terms of the scope and sophistication of the other conversations.1 Contemporary Buddhist-Christian dialogue (hereafter BCD) can be divided into three main types of activities: the dialogue of life; the dia- logue of meaning; and the dialogue of the heart.2 Yet, as we shall see, there is always room for improvement and expansion. Part of the reason for the harmonious nature of the dialogue derives from the previous history of Buddhist-Christian interaction. History always plays a piv- otal role in dialogue even if it is sometimes a painful topic. For instance, dia- logue among Christians, Jews, and Muslims has to account for the centuries of conflict, distortion, and misunderstanding-not to mention mutual contempt, slaughter, and the Holocaust. While most Christians, Jews, and Muslims will deny that their religions intrinsically have anything to do with promoting these terrors, there is little doubt that religion in theory and practice lies at the root of much of this communal evil between those the Muslims call the People of the Book. At the other end of the spectrum, we can contemplate the relatively easy relationship among Christianity, Buddhism, and other East Asian traditions such as Confucianism, Taoism, and Shintoism.3 The first caveat about BCD is that it is usually initiated by academicians or contemplatives. This means that the participants and the audience are inevita- bly educated members of the middle class. While there is nothing fundamen- tally disturbing about this, there is a frequently voiced desire to find some way to enlarge the circle of conversation beyond those already convinced of the posi- tive nature of the interchange.4 This is especially the point when the conversa- tion moves from scholarly or spiritual interests to the question of social action. Along with the desire to expand the circle of conversation beyond the academic and contemplative world is the recognition that the participants need to dis- cover ways to invite new people to join the dialogue. BCD must escape becom- ing a comfortable club where the partners talk only to each other. Buddhist-Christian Studies 13. ? 1993 by University of Hawaii Press.

At the Third and Fourth International Buddhist-Christian Dialogues, there were more than a thousand participants from over sixteen countries. Most of the participants came from South, Southeast, and East Asia, Europe, and North America.5 The scope of BCD mirrors the global reach of both traditions. We can now find Buddhists in Boston, Los Angeles, Toronto, Basel, London, Paris, Rome, and Berlin as well as in Tokyo, Hong Kong, Taipei, Bangkok, and Columbo. Chris- tianity has also now become an international religion with churches spread around the world. An amusing sight in any large BCD is the puzzlement on the faces of a sin- cere questioner who asks an Asian participant about the Buddhist tradition, only to discover that the Asian is a Christian but that the North American of European descent just over there will be happy to answer the question from the Buddhist perspective. One thing that BCD proves is that stereotypes about the ethnic background of the two traditions are fading. In the North Atlantic world, the Buddhist Dharma is growing rapidly. For instance, the last Canadian national census indicated that Buddhists are the most rapidly developing reli- gious community in Canada. The rapid growth of the Dharma in North America is the result of two differ- ent trends. First, there is the steady increase in immigration from Asian Bud- dhist countries. This has clearly been the case for Canada and the United States since the 1960s, when discriminatory immigration laws were changed to allow Asians once again to immigrate in large numbers to North America (and to the United Kingdom and Europe as well). Second, it is becoming evident that Buddhism has a great appeal for many North Americans of European ethnic origins. Euro-Americans are being ordained in various Theravada and Maha- yana traditions and are also developing new forms of lay and nonmonastic lead- ership styles for the Buddhist community. Nowhere is this growth of BCD better illustrated than in the discussions and meditations at the Fourth International Buddhist-Christian Conference, held at Boston University, 30 July-3 August 1992. Both Buddhists and Christians professed to find the activities of dialogue rewarding and prove the point by continuing to meet and to discover new ways to enrich the process and the con- tent of dialogue. I will discuss the import of these developments in terms of the dialogues of meaning, spirituality, and joint social concerns as manifested at the Fourth International Buddhist-Christian Conference. Few interfaith dialogues have demonstrated the depth and consistency of intellectual engagement and spiritual exploration found in BCD. Part of this success comes from the forms of organization developed over the last decade to promote dialogue between Buddhists and Christians. Buddhist-Christian dia- logue even has its own academic journal, Buddhist-Christian Studies, pub- lished by the University of Hawaii Press, and the Newsletter of the Society for Buddhist-Christian Studies, published at Purdue University. Furthermore, an</page><page sequence="3">REFLECTIONS ON THE BOSTON CONFERENCE international Society for Buddhist-Christian Studies supports and promotes BCD wherever and whenever it can. These days there is nothing surprising about BCD holding major international conferences from time to time or about an international society being formed to oversee these activities. This has become the norm for Christian dialogue with Judaism, Islam, and Confucian- ism (albeit on a more modest scale for the latter). One of the distinctive organizational features of BCD over the last decade has been the creation of working groups within the Society for Buddhist-Chris- tian Studies. The inspiration for the working groups came from a joint initia- tive of Masao Abe and John Cobb, Jr. At the Second International Buddhist- Christian Conference, held in Hawaii in 1984, Abe and Cobb convened a group of twenty-four Buddhist and Christian scholars to discuss topics of mutual theological/religious concern.6 One key feature of the Cobb-Abe pro- posal was the stipulation that membership in the group committed each partic- ipant to meeting with the working group for five sessions, one held each year for five years. The specific aim of the group was to achieve a level of consistency in the conversations over the five-year period. The project proved so useful that it was agreed to add three more sessions in order to continue the dialogue into the 1990s.7 Another interesting aspect of the Cobb-Abe group was the decision on the type of person to be invited. Cobb and Abe decided that they would not seek out Christian specialists on Buddhism or Buddhists specializing in Christianity. Rather, they invited noted scholars and theologians from both traditions even if these people did not have any previous experience in Buddhist-Christian dia- logue. One of the outcomes of the dialogue process was anticipated to be a growing understanding of the issues involved. Further, Abe and Cobb believed that such a group might well ask some new questions about the dialogue pre- cisely because they were unencumbered by too much previous knowledge of each other. The experiment in continuing working groups has proved to be a great suc- cess. The Buddhist and Christian participants have gotten to know each other well; often the dialogue will go on between members of the working group out- side the formal deliberations. But what has become most important has been the deepened quality of the conversation over the years. Both sides have moved beyond the point of having to make basic introductions of their faith at each meeting. The working group members have learned enough about each other for more sophisticated topics to be assayed. Sometimes the working group will even return to topics discussed in previous years in order to clarify what was then said. Another benefit of the project has been a series of publications by the members about what they have learned from the dialogue. These publica- tions have introduced the topic of BCD to a large audience interested in theol- ogy if not interfaith dialogue. What, by way of sample, has been learned by the Theological Encounter Group? First, the Christians have learned a great deal about the ethical struc- 137</page><page sequence="4">JOHN BERTHRONG ture of the various Buddhist traditions. One of the common myths about Bud- dhism in the West is that it is a completely otherworldly tradition without any serious social ethics or concern for community life. This is a myth that has been dispelled by means of much discussion. The Christians have come to appreciate the fact that all Buddhist meditation and wisdom is built on the basis of right conduct. Without ethics there is no Dharma or Sangha. Second, the Buddhists have learned a great deal about the Christian under- standing of God. The Buddhists have learned that Christians do not worship a crude anthropomorphic deity, some kind of divine grandmother or grandfather in high heaven. The Buddhists have come to appreciate the modern Christian attempt to speak of the divine reality within modern cultures. They have also come to learn something of the Christian life of prayer and meditation and how this shapes Christian understandings of the divine reality. Along with this refreshed comprehension of Christian theological and spiritual practices, the Buddhists continue to be fascinated by Christian social service and social criti- cism. In fact, both traditions have learned that a religion that remains uncritical about its views of other religions is a harmful artifact in the modern world, where religion must play a role in reducing communal conflict. In terms of the broader dialogue presented at the Fourth International Con- ference, some other points merit careful consideration. I noticed a distinct blur- ring of confessional lines at this conference in a way unique to BCD. The long and the short of it is that Buddhists and Christians seem perfectly happy these days to borrow from each other whatever is found useful. Buddhists are fasci- nated by Christian social activism and sophisticated theological defenses of the- ism; Christians are moved by the depth of Buddhist spiritual practice and by the profundity of Buddhist religious psychology. One discovers Christian con- templatives eagerly making use of Tibetan meditation practice for their own purposes and Pure Land scholars pondering the Christian exposition of grace. In wild moments of interreligious harmony, some Buddhists and Christians see each other as both Buddhists and Christians. Such joyful mutual discovery immediately brings to mind the charge of syn- cretism.8 While the fear of syncretism was more pronounced in the previous Christian theological generation, a sense of trepidation concerning irresponsi- ble syncretism still lurks in the halls of any large dialogue meeting-at least from the Christian side. Will this enthusiasm for dialogue go too far? Will peo- ple lose their bearings in both traditions and end with nothing save some New Age stew? Many participants see this kind of mutual transformation as an inevi- table feature of human religious history. W. C. Smith has already argued that there is only one human religious history with all kinds of regional and tempo- ral distinctions. Smith demonstrates that, the more we learn about the religious history of humankind, the more we will discover its interconnections. Yet Smith does not blindly worship syncretism. Rather, he sees the continuation, transformation, and renewal of the great historic and cumulative faith tradi- tions of humankind extending into the foreseeable future.9 What is novel 138</page><page sequence="5">REFLECTIONS ON THE BOSTON CONFERENCE John Berthrong, Director of the Fourth International Buddhist- C Christian Conference held at ti Boston UniversityJuly 30-August 3, 1992 welcoming the delegates ;v at the opening of the conference.

For instance, Buddhist-Christian interaction in East Asia and North America and Europe is a relatively new phenomenon. An analysis of the range of topics at the Fourth International Buddhist-Chris- tian Conference demonstrates the global range and depth of BCD. The topics of the conference included social ethics in comparative perspective, art and wholeness in Buddhism and Christianity, women and the feminine in dialogue and healing, compassion and wisdom as healing agents, personal transforma- tion in mutual perspective, the need to move beyond anthropocentrism in environmental ethics, issues in interpersonal and communal healing, compara- tive Buddhist-Christian studies, spirituality and emptiness, resources for an environment ethics, foundations for dialogue, Buddhist and Christian perspec- tives on ecology, lay and monastic communities, and deconstruction and dia- logue. Along with these formal panels, there were also a series of ongoing working groups. These included the Korean Group, the Bibliography for Buddhist- Christian Dialogue Working Group, the Buddhist-Christian Theological Encounter Group (mentioned above), as well as groups dedicated to the study of Zen awakening and Christian contemplation, a Mahayana reading of the Gospel of Mark, ethics and sunyata, dialogue with Nishida's philosophy, and the Buddhist-Christian dialogue and ecology. And, if this were not enough,</page><page sequence="6">JOHN BERTHRONG there was also a series of plenary presentations on mutual transformations, Bud- dhist-Christian practice, ecology, Buddhist-Christian dialogue in Japan, faith, and community and diversity. 10 A number of issues were raised at the Fourth International Conference. First, ethical and environmental concerns were major new dialogue topics. One rea- son for this is that the conference organizers had decided that these were impor- tant topics and solicited contributions. The response to this call demonstrated that social ethics and environmental ethics are issues of mutual concern for Buddhists and Christians. The various issues of social and environmental ethics illustrated the growing realization that there are some areas of human concern that demand interreligious understanding. Any concerted attempt to deal with ecological degradation will need the cooperation of all humankind, and that will remain very difficult among religions until the traditions have come to understand the different perspectives on society and nature unique to each tra- dition. In this case, effective action will rely on mutual understanding. It was also interesting to note that the discussion about social and ethical cooperation has moved beyond academic conversation in some parts of the world. Speakers from Canada and Thailand talked about joint projects under way in their countries on immigration policy and ethical tourism. These cooper- ative projects demonstrate the ability to work together in situations of different majority and minority status. It was also noted that Buddhists and Christians are working on environmental ethics in different parts of the world. Second, the role of meditation and contemplative traditions continues to be a major factor in Buddhist-Christian dialogue. While spiritual disciplines and Robert C.

For instance, one of the unique features of all the four inter- national conferences has been special sessions arranged for meditation and prayer as an integral part of the program. No one is sure why this kind of mutual exploration of spiritual practice works so well in BCD, but it is the case that this is one of the frontiers of the relationship. Both Christians and Bud- dhists are eager to share the richness of their spiritual traditions; there is little fear that somehow this will lead to syncretism by those leading and taking part in the meditation and prayer sessions.1 What is evident in the practice sessions is the sense of mutual enrichment and spiritual growth. Perhaps this could hap- pen only between two religions with well-organized monastic traditions. Both the Buddhist and the Christian leaders of the prayer and meditation workshops have remarked on the intense spiritual hunger that they sense in both communities today. Another interesting facet of this work is that it encompasses both monastic and lay spirituality. Over the last two decades there has been an intense interchange between various Roman Catholic contempla- tive orders and Theravada, Mahayana, and now Vajrayana communities. In fact, one of the plenaries, lead by Sister Pia Gyger and Father Niklaus Brants- chen, SJ., told the story of the foundation of a new retreat in Bad Sh6n- brunn, Switzerland, dedicated to teaching both Christian and Zen forms of meditation. Third, there is a growing interest in the philosophic foundations of Christian and Buddhist dialogue. This is almost an inevitable outcome when many of the dialogue participants are professors. One of the things that has always been rec- ognized about dialogue between Buddhists and Christians is that the philo- sophic histories of the communities are radically different. For instance, Chris- tian philosophers have become fascinated with the theory of the emptiness/ sunyata of all reality as a basic model of Buddhist metaphysical analysis. Another area of attention is the study of the famous Japanese Kyoto School, a school of thought nurtured both by the Zen and Pure Land traditions in Japan and by interaction with German philosophy. An example of a specialized philosophic interchange is the exploration of the role of A. N. Whitehead's process philosophy as a basis for dialogue. For instance, there is always speculation as to whether and to what degree there is a fruitful analogy between the Buddhist notion of pratityasamutpada, interde- pendent origination, and the organic relationships of Whitehead's actual enti- ties. This specialized conversation about process thought and Buddhism always directs attention to the question of language and the translation of concepts from one tradition to another. Fourth, there is a consistent interest in the healing disciplines. In many ways, this focus is related to meditation and prayer as an even more specialized topic. While healing and health are often related to the meditation arts, this is not always the case. There are independent medical traditions that are integral parts of both religions. Healing and notions of health are also linked to the 141</page><page sequence="8">JOHN BERTHRONG notion of environment because Christianity and Buddhism teach the mending of all creation. One cannot be a healthy person in a sick world. And last, but not least, a truly healthy person is a person who sees reality as it is and acts accordingly-hence the connection of health issues with the reformation of worldviews and social ethics. Fifth, there is the question of mutual transformation and self-identity. I have already mentioned some of these issues in the discussion of the fear of syn- cretism. At least two of the plenary sessions addressed this issue. More and more it seems to be the case that people are expressing the transformative impact that BCD has had on their lives. While dialogue participants almost universally confess the fact that this impact is entirely positive, they also note that their lives and piety are different after the encounter. Many are exploring what it means to work and practice in two different faith traditions. It is inter- esting to note that those involved in meditation and prayer are taking the lead in this aspect of BCD. The heart often seems warmed before the head can understand just what is going on in the relationship. One of the constant criticisms of the dialogue movement is that it is almost entirely a Christian-initiated affair. While scholars and adherents of the other traditions are polite enough to accept the Christian invitation to dialogue, the burden of beginning the conversation falls to the Christian side. It is often said, I believe erroneously, that this is because modern Christians are so unsure of themselves that they must reach out to others for touching and healing. While there is truth to the claim that dialogue often begins at the invitation of the Christians, this is less and less the case for international BCD. But it has never been the entire truth of the matter. For instance, as I noted in the section on the philosophic issues in dialogue, the famous Kyoto School in Japan was created by Japanese philosophers grap- pling with the impact of European philosophy and religion. Prior to the rise of the ecumenically sponsored dialogue movement, some of Japan's most able Buddhist intellectuals were in serious dialogue with the Christian world. Japa- nese intellectual history has been transformed by this encounter. Members of the Kyoto School continue to take a leading role in international and Japanese dialogues. Even more recently, Chinese, Thai, Sri Lankan, and Tibetan Bud- dhist leaders are taking an active role in convening and supporting dialogues. Another area of real mutuality, also noted above, is in the area of meditation and prayer. As monks, nuns, and lay leaders note, anything but mutual humil- ity would make a mockery of the teachings of both traditions in terms of spirit- uality. Sharing is much more the order of the day. In fact, there is so much shar- ing going on between contemplatives that the hierarchies in Christian and Buddhist traditions are somewhat nervous about the coming and going across what were previously rigid borders of doctrine, faith, and practice. Finally, another area of mutual support is found in the growing field of envi- ronmental ethics. Here Buddhism and Christianity recognize that the global, if not cosmic, scope of the problems demands a mutual and respectful search of 142</page><page sequence="9">REFLECTIONS ON THE BOSTON CONFERENCE the answers to the ecological crisis. There is a growing recognition that the eco- logical crisis is ultimately a question of the value of creation and hence a pro- found religious question. It is a question that demands a total human revision- ing of socioethical values in order to undo the harm that has already been done to the earth, air, and water on which all human life depends. Further, there is a clear recognition that no one religious tradition has the total answer to the question of the environment. Any solution must be a dialogical plan consistent with the highest teachings of all religions. In conclusion, Buddhist-Christian dialogue is flourishing as never before around the globe. No report based on the activities of just one conference, even a major international event, can do justice to the diversity of modern Buddhist- Christian dialogue. Buddhists and Christians are seeking mutual enrichment as well as solutions to questions of economic and political justice for all people. Buddhists and Christians meditate and pray not only about the classic spiritual disciplines of their traditions and lineages but also about the environment. Soteriology has taken on truly cosmic ecumenical dimensions in Buddhist- Christian dialogue. Scholars and theologians debate the intellectual founda- tions of both traditions as well as the potential basis for intercultural communi- cation between different religions and peoples. For all these reasons, BCD can claim to be a model bilateral dialogue, one eager to share its collective insights with all other sentient beings.12 NOTES A short version of this report appears in the journal World Faiths Encounter no. 5 (July 1993), pp. 5-12. 1. While I will emphasize the organizational, theological, and historical reasons for the success of Buddhist-Christian dialogue in the modern period, I would be remiss if I did not mention the selfless service of a number of individuals. Although I believe that the dialogue has grown beyond merely being the project of a few committed individu- als, it is still true that it has been blessed with outstanding and creative leadership from both communities of faith. One can think of Masao Abe, John B. Cobb, Jr., David Chappell, Jan van Bragt, Roger Corless, Rubin Habito, Donald Mitchell, Paul Ingram, Taitetsu Unno, Seiichi Yagi, Rita Gross, Sulak Sivaraksa, and Fred Streng. 2. Although this is my terminology for the major forms of Buddhist-Christian dia- logue, I have tried to match it with some of the major statements on dialogue issued by responsible Christian bodies. For instance, the notion of a dialogue of life comes from the Christian Council of Asia. The idea of a dialogue of the heart arises from conversa- tions between Buddhist and Christian contemplatives in describing their dialogue work. And the dialogue of meaning characterizes the kinds of conversations held by academi- cians. Both the World Council of Churches and the Roman Catholic Church have issued a number of papers and guidelines over the last two decades that seek to define the atti- tude and role of dialogue as a part of the Christian life. In a major recent statement, the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Relations and the Congregation for the Evangeliation of Peoples defined dialogue thus: "Dialogue can be understood in different ways. First, at the purely human level, it means reciprocal communication, leading to a common goal or, at a deeper level, to interpersonal com- munion. Second, dialogue can be taken as an attitude of respect and friendship, which 143</page><page sequence="10">JOHN BERTHRONG permeates or should permeate all those activities constituting the evangelizing mission of the church. This can appropriately be called 'the spirit of dialogue.' Third, in the con- text of religious plurality, dialogue means 'all positive and constructive interreligious relations with individuals and communities of other faiths which are directed to mutual understanding and enrichment' . . . in obedience to truth and respect for freedom" (The Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue and the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, "Dialogue and Proclamation," Origins, vol. 21, no. 8 Uuly 1991], para. 9). 3. There are always exceptions to such claims. For instance, George Elison's Desus Destroyed: The Image of Christianity in Early Modem Japan (Cambridge: Harvard Uni- versity Press, 1973) demonstrates that, in the early encounter of Christianity with Japa- nese culture, the results were not simple or friendly. What has been called Japan's "Christian century" ended in disaster for the church and with the policy of exclusion of Christianity fromJapan until the Meiji Restoration. While it is easy to argue that the real basis for Tokugawa hostility toward Christianity was political or economic, there is still a real clash between the worldview of the early modern Christian missionaries and theJap- anese intellectual elite. Chung Chai-Sik (Boston University, in private conversation) has pointed out that the relationship between Buddhists and Christians in early modern Korea was not an easy one either. This continues to be the case as Christianity grows in size and power in that land. In terms of the modern engagement of Buddhism and Christianity in Japan, things have gone much better. See Notto Thelle, Buddhism and Christianity inJapan: From Conflict to Dialogue, 1854-1899 (Berkeley, California: Uni- versity of California Press, 1987). 4. This call is usually made for two reasons. First, there is the pragmatic and missional desire to see the circle of conversation expand beyond academic and religious profession- als. There is a steadfast belief that BCD is a good thing that should be shared with all Christians and Buddhists and that it will actually be beneficial to society when practiced. Second, at least among the Christians, there is a powerful theological movement, called liberation theology, that posits God's action through the "preferential option for the poor." If there are no powerless or marginalized people involved in BCD, then that dia- logue is not what it should be. Further, it has been pointed out that the great bulk of the world's poor are in the South as compared to the traditionally industrialized and Chris- tianized North. Hence, there is even a more pressing need for North and South to learn how to talk to each other if a more just social order is going to emerge after the collapse of the cold war. 5. One of the great frustrations encountered by the organizers of the Fourth Interna- tional Buddhist-Christian Conference was the refusal of the American government to grant visas to the participants from Africa. The Society for Buddhist-Christian Studies will work for the next four years to make sure that such blatant discrimination is elimi- nated before the fifth international conference. 6. The formal name of this group is the International Buddhist-Christian Theological Encounter Group. It is usually referred to as the Cobb-Abe group, reflecting the heri- tage of the two notable founders of the group. 7. Professor Hans Kiing, a member of the working group, has stated on a number of occasions that this is a unique kind of dialogical arrangement. It allows for a richness and continuity of discussion not found in any other kind of dialogue. While this is not the kind of statement subject to empirical verification, Kiing's conclusion does seem to be very much to the point. 8. Most Christians do not take kindly to the notion of syncretism. The reason for this is the strict theological demands of monotheism: you shall have no other gods before me. The real crux of the problem is the fear of idolatry rather than a fear of borrowing 144</page><page sequence="11">REFLECTIONS ON THE BOSTON CONFERENCE 145 some specific cultural form from another religious tradition. The true fear is that such borrowing will mean the worship of some mundane object rather than devotion to God. 9. Wilfred Cantwell Smith, Towards a World Theology: Faith and the Comparative History ofReligion (Philadelphia: The Westminster Press, 1981). 10. A number of these papers will continue to appear in this journal. 11. The meditation and prayer leaders have all been experienced members of various Buddhist or Christian lineages. What is so interesting is that monastics are in the fore- front of these joint spiritual projects, and no one suggests that they are not serious and knowledgeable practitioners of their respective faiths. They are often teachers and medi- tation masters within their own monastic communities. There is even a journal devoted to this topic: Monastic Interreligious Dialogue Bulletin, published by the North Ameri- can Board for East-West Dialogue, Abbey of Gethsemani, 3642 Monks Road, Trappist, KY 40051-6102. 12. There is now a growing, although small, Jewish-Buddhist dialogue. BCD is also the "parent" of the renewed Confucian-Christian dialogue. The founding of the mod- ern Confucian-Christian dialogue took place at the Second International Buddhist- Christian Conference in Hawaii in 1984. BCD is certainly a bilateral dialogue with an open hand for teaching and sharing.</page></plain_text>
