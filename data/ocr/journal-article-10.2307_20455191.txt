<plain_text><page sequence="1">Conflict and Ambiguity in Victorian Women's Writing: Eliza Lynn Linton and the Possibilities of Agnosticism Sarah J. Bilston Yale University Over the last few decades, many critics have argued that conservative Victorian women writers expressed covert ambivalence about the views on women and gender they explicitly espoused. The radicalism of this ambivalence was a virtual axiom of later twentieth-century feminist schol arship: tensions-between a narrator's perspective and that of her heroine, for example-were typically read as evidence of an effort to articulate sub merged anger at stifling patriarchal constraints. The structure of the novel in particular, it was argued, allowed women writers to appear to toe the party line while encoding anger and resistance in the text in ways that could be deciphered by any similarly frustrated and defiant woman reader. More recently, critics have shifted their account of the ambiguities in nov els by authors such as Eliza Lynn Linton and Charlotte Yonge: narrative tensions are treated not so much as evidence of conservatism or radicalism, antifeminism or feminism, but rather as a sign that the writers were "fun damentally conflicted."1 This phrase is, however, often effectively con flated with "subversive," as in Nicola Diane Thompson's interpretation of Linton's The Rebel of the Family as "confused and transgressive."' Ambivalence about contemporary mythologies of gender is still, it seems, taken by many modem critics as evidence of serious cultural transgressive ness, as if it was impossible for a "true" Victorian conservative to have doubts or qualms about gender-appropriate behavior and the separation of the spheres. Of course, if authors like Linton or Yonge were "merely" conservative, they might lose their appeal for feminist critics. The political utility of writers is, as Thompson hints, often at the heart of the reclamatory impulse: "While feminist criticism makes it possible in principle to recover forgotten women novelists, its ideological basis has limitations: what, for example, do you say about a conservative woman novelist like Charlotte Yonge once you've discovered her?" (p. 2). This approach supposes not only that Victorian conservatism and contemporary feminism are poles apart, but also that the former can have little place in a history "of our own," as it were the history of people like us. Thompson is at pains to 283</page><page sequence="2">stress that women writers should not be valued for their transgressions alone, that conflict and "rhetorical caginess" make for a rich reading expe rience,3 but her literary interpretations continue to be based on a one dimensional view of Victorian conservatism and thus an abiding faith in the subversiveness of (for example) Charlotte Yonge's associating "clever" with "woman" (p. 5).4 Thompson's appreciative account of fictions that "[subvert] the ostensibly conservative didactic message" (p. 6) continues to imagine radical and conservative approaches to gender as binary opposites rather than as positions along a political continuum. Celebrations of Victorian women's writing as a literary form of guerilla warfare suggest an enduring desire to rehabilitate authors into something as palatable to turn of-the-twenty-first-century radicals as possible. In this article I shall investigate the work of Eliza Lynn Linton, staunchest of self-proclaimed antifeminists, in detail.5 In particular, I hope to develop a new model for approaching conflicted and ambiguous atti tudes to women's personal and political desires, a model that does not sim ply collapse uncertainty and debate with radicalism but rather views them as important features of Victorian intellectual discourse. I want to move away from what I would call a psychological reading (a reading that essen tially concentrates on the burdens experienced by women authors and the ways in which they either subversively encoded or unevenly repressed underlying defiance) in favor of a primarily intellectual account (one that positions attitudes to women, gender, and sexuality in relation to a writer's broader political and ideological beliefs). My article will contend, indeed, that Linton's ambivalence about ideologies of domestic, angelic, sexless womanhood formed part of a broad, judicious, and open agnosticism.6 Linton contributed regularly to the philosophical, theological, and meta physical debates of her time: she was highly suspicious of organized reli gions, although she remained intrigued by the notion of an unfathomed "unknown" throughout her life. Her ensuing, evolving attitudes to spiritu alism and the occult were not so much subversive, however, as undecided, investigative, inquiring. While far from wholeheartedly endorsing mythologies of femininity or the tenets of Christianity and the claims of occultists, she was, fundamentally, not a radical; like many another Victorian, she was rather confounded by the passing of traditional faiths, doctrines, and beliefs. "Weird at All Four Corners of My Being"7 It is important to remember that Victorian agnosticism was not about sitting on the fence. Rejecting anthropomorphic notions of a God with a personality, many agnostics were nevertheless metaphysically idealistic, 284</page><page sequence="3">preoccupied by beliefs in the essential coherence and order of the natural world and the existence of a mysterious and awe-inspiring unknown. "[D]eliverance from the cruel superstitions which have overwhelmed brave men with abject terror," Linton argued, allowed agnostics to "look up to heaven above unabashed if questioning," recognizing "that we are men, surrounded by unfathomable mysteries.... that we are one with the nature we do not yet understand."8 Contemporary science was valued for the empirical evidence it appeared to provide of an underlying and immutable order: Charles Darwin's theories of evolution and natural selection sym bolized to agnostics like Linton the marvelous revelation of "life as a har monious whole."9 However, agnosticism was also suffused with anxieties, which typically centered around the fear that the unknown was profoundly unknowable (or as Linton put it "unfathomable"), inherently beyond human cognition.10 Like many of her peers, Linton therefore felt torn between questions "we cannot answer yet cannot stay" ("What [does] it all mean? In the wilderness we call life, who can strike the right road? In the darkness we call faith, who can come to the light?") and a life-long desire to investigate and attempt to grasp the possibilities of the enthralling unknown (The Autobiography of Christopher Kirkland, III, 66). For Linton, the occult seemed a particularly alluring means of charting and experiencing mysterious phenomena. During her early years as a writer in London, she was deeply curious about the possibilities of spiritualism and mesmerism:11 the 1850s were the heyday of the spiritualist movement in Britain, and many of her colleagues in the mid-Victorian literary world-including the Brownings, George Eliot, and Charles Dickens experimented with mesmerism.12 Linton's biographers note that she regu larly attended seances and consulted mediums at this time.13 George Somes Layard, her first biographer, includes letters and accounts from those who knew her in her early London days and who remembered her as, initially, an enthusiastic convert to the spiritualist cause ("absolutely credulous in spiritualistic matters," to be precise).'4 Her faith was, however, damaged by a series of "detections of imposture" (The Autobiography of Christopher Kirkland, II, 24): in particular, she claimed to have caught out the American spiritualist Daniel Douglas Home (Robert Browning's "Mr. Sludge, The Medium") during a seance arranged for her benefit.15 Linton subsequently portrayed herself in her fictional and nonfictional prose as a confirmed skeptic, and many of the short stories she published around this time expose the credulity of ill-educated, superstitious fools who believe in the existence of spirits and supematural forces. "The White Witch of Combe Andrew," for instance, is a tale about a foolish servant who pur chases a magic potion from her aunt, Dame Hagley, which turns out to be a deadly poison; "Galloping Dick" describes how two elderly, superstitious 285</page><page sequence="4">women are preyed upon by an unscrupulous servant who terrifies them with tales of a spectral galloping horseman in order to introduce a danger ous robber into the house."6 Although Linton represented herself as a skeptic for most of her life, she, in fact, ranged curiously along the spectrum of occultist faith and doubt. According to A. P. Sinnett, she interviewed a number of spiritual ists and theosophists about their beliefs and experiences in 1885. At one point, Sinnett claims, Linton ran out of the room, overwhelmed by fears of her susceptibility to occultist practices: "If I stay any longer I shall be mes merised."'7 As we shall see presently, her later fictions involve fairly sub stantial (and sympathetic) engagements with contemporary spiritualist and theosophical philosophies. It is worth noting first, however, that throughout Linton's fluctuations between belief in and skepticism about the occult, one interest remained constant: savage, violent, atavistic impulses receive regular expression in her work, whether centered around supematural or mortal beings. So, for example, although Witch Stories (1861) does not narrate tales of magic, it does detail the sickening tortures inflicted on those accused of witchcraft over the centuries.18 A story entitled "The Devil's Secretary," for instance, describes how a man's legs are crushed during torture until "the blood and marrow spouted out"; the torturers subsequently search him for the devil's mark, "pulling off every nail with a turkas, or smith's pincers, and then thrusting in needles up to their heads" (pp. 24-25). Perhaps Linton designed these horrid accounts to raise the consciousness-even the remorse-of the mesmeric community: such scenes had powerful contem porary resonances, since mesmerized individuals were often tortured in an attempt to prove or disprove the bona fides of their trance-like state.19 Yet the volume strangely celebrates the violence, displaying a positively Jacobean fascination with the limits of human suffering: the reviewer of the Athenaeum dismissed it as a "ghastly" book.20 Such criticism of Linton's work was not uncommon; George Saintsbury, reviewing With a Silken Thread (a collection of short stories published in 1880), expressed himself deeply disturbed by the brutal delight Linton seemed to take in "smirching her page with blood and cruelty." He describes a key scene in "The Last Tenants of Hangman's House" to support his point: The author relates with a kind of relish how a husband digs his nails, kept sharp for the purpose, into his wife's arm so that the blood flows from the four cuts. We do not say that these subjects are, in themselves inadmissible; we say that of no subject. But we do say that they are inadmissible when the effect produced is one of apparent gloating on the part of the writer.... 21 Linton's interest in the supematural and the occult can be seen as part of a wider fascination in what lay beyond, beneath the fabric of polite society. 286</page><page sequence="5">Linton regularly positioned herself as a bulwark of conservative morality; she was, however, deeply interested in elemental instincts, barbaric drives, and the urges that emerge when normative social and moral standards are pushed to one side. "The Fate of Madame Cabanel" "The Fate of Madame Cabanel," another short story incorporated into With a Silken Thread, makes this interest explicit. The tale is centrally con cerned with the nightmarish absence of "enlightened" Victorian social standards: it describes the turmoil that develops when a charge of vam pirism is brought against an innocent Englishwoman by a superstitious rural French community. Fanny Cabanel is a young and impoverished girl who marries a much older Frenchman; her eventual murder is engineered by her husband's housekeeper/mistress. Adele is intensely jealous of her English rival, and she manages to persuade local villagers that mysterious deaths in the small Breton community are caused by the pretty young wife. In particular, Adele focuses her neighbors' attention on Fanny's fair good looks (which seem alien to the dark French locals), suggesting that she is gaining her robust health by drinking blood. Hysteria soon develops when one night Fanny is seen kissing Adele's dying child who, unfortunately, has blood on his lips; this blood is transferred to Fanny's own mouth and is seen as crucial evidence of her vampirism. The wife is dragged by Adele and a local mob to a pit to be killed; by the time the crowd arrives with its bur den, however, Fanny has already expired (presumably through asphyxia tion). Monsieur Cabanel arrives in time to see his wife's dead body and is consumed with horror; Adele's plan at least has failed, for he renounces her. The story reveals a debt to a substantial corpus of writing (folkloric and sensationalist) about the appetites and practices of the undead. The con cem over Fanny's rich coloring, for example, suggests Linton's familiarity with James Malcolm Rymer's 1847 goreridden Varney, the Vampyre, or the Feast of Blood. In the later stages of Rymer's story, a local blacksmith informs the community that Clara Crofton, recently deceased, has become a dangerous flesh-eater: "'Here you are,' he said, 'look at the bloom upon her lips, why her cheeks are fresher and rosier than ever they were while she was alive, a vampyre my mates, this is a vampire. ."'22 In Linton's tale, the blacksmith becomes a gravedigger with a similarly authoritative position in the community and similar expertise in the ways and habits of vampires: "with those red lips of hers, her rose cheeks and her plump shoul ders, she looks like a vampire and as if she lived on blood," observes Martin Briolic. "Those red lips don't come by nothing ... they glisten with blood! I said so from the beginning."23 The blacksmith's desire to exorcise Fanny 287</page><page sequence="6">by burying her "with a stake thrust through her body" (p. 292) was entrenched in vampire lore by the nineteenth century, surfacing in texts as diverse as Leo Tolstoy's The Family of the Vourdalak, Rymer's Varmey, the Vampyre, Sheridan Le Fanu's "Carmilla," and, of course, Bram Stoker's Dracula at the end of the century. A number of articles on vampire lore were published in periodicals to which Linton contributed in the 1850s and '60s, and it seems plausible that she had read these pieces; both Edmund Ollier's "Vampyres" (Household Words) and J. Scoffern's "Vampyres" (St. James's Magazine) discuss the Greek alter ego of the vam pire, the "broucolaque" or "broucolac," and these names are used by Adele and the blacksmith to describe the young Fanny Cabanel.24 Linton's research lends a richly folkloric air to the tale, and yet "The Fate of Madame Cabanel" is not a "real" vampire story: the putative lamia is not a parasitic sensual predator but rather a misunderstood alien, a for eigner, an outcast, and a victim. Indeed, the text explicitly positions itself as yet another address to the credulous about the dangers of superstition (and also as a warning against sojourns in rural France, which Linton casts as a rampant medieval anachronism). Like so much of Linton's work, "The Fate of Madame Cabanel" explicitly suggests that supernatural beings are little more than the creation of ill-educated, hysterical minds. Yet the nar rative is not straightforwardly skeptical or atheistic about unexplained phenomena. The Pieuvrotines, the narrator suggests, were simple-minded enough to believe "implicitly all that Monsieur le Cure said to them, and many things which he did not say; and they took all the unknown, not as magnificent, but as diabolical" (p. 281).25 The second clause indicates sym pathy for those who do regard "the unknown" as "magnificent"-who do not thoughtlessly internalize the lessons of organized religion but instead adopt a reverent, unprejudiced approach to mysterious events. Later in the text, Fanny is prompted to soothe Adele's dying child by "a mysterious force and prevision of her own future motherhood" (p. 289), a passage that again endorses the existence of drives beyond human understanding. The tale's agenda is therefore agnostic in character: while resisting Christian conceptions of God and the devil, Linton's narrator accepts the existence of an unknown; indeed, she hints that mysterious powers direct unex plained phenomena. At the same time, human beings are clearly capable of causing utter chaos in "The Fate of Madame Cabanel," of subverting the possibility for order and purpose in the natural world. Superstition (broadly conceived to include major world religions) emerges as a pathetic and doomed effort to comprehend the vast possibilities the world presents. This nuanced agnostic approach to metaphysical questions reflects sug gestively on the tale's attitudes to female gender and sexuality. Anger at superstitious attitudes to the unknown merges into frustration with pre 288</page><page sequence="7">vailing mythologies of womanhood: the text develops an analogy between the world's unknown and the terra incognita of a woman's self, hinting at the possibilities of the latter while expressing extreme ambivalence about man-made icons of femininity. At first indeed, Linton's protagonist seems a version of Coventry Patmore's heroine: "young, pretty and fair as an angel," she possesses "mild blue eyes," a "placid unvarying smile," and an attitude of "unwearied sweetness" (pp. 282, 283). However, this paragon of English womanhood is revealed to be intensely vulnerable, virtually unable to operate in the dangerous world she inhabits. When the locals shout "broucolaque" in her face, she is "too phlegmatic to let herself be uncomfortable or troubled deeply"; when her husband asks whether she is trying to hurt him, she merely "[opens] her blue eyes wide" (pp. 288, 289). Fanny's docile, pedestrian character irritates the whole Breton community, but it "especially disgust[s] Adele" (p. 283)-and the housekeeper's frus trated, negative evaluation of the young wife blends into the narrator's own speculative position ("If one had to name the predominant charac teristic of Madame Cabanel it would be easiness of temper. You saw it in the round, soft, indolent lines of her face and figure; in her mild blue eyes and placid, unvarying smile," p. 283). For much of the story, Linton's nar rator-with Adele-reads passivity as indolence and compliance as insi pidity, working to destroy the angel in the house. Yet while the text is dismissive of domestic ideals of womanhood, it does not fully undermine or reject restrictive feminine archetypes. Adele can never become the narrator's alter ego: the tale may use the housekeeper to focus attention on Fanny Cabanel's deficiencies, but above all it censures those who willfully manipulate the superficial notions of the masses (as Linton conceives them). The cruel and calculating Adele is therefore depicted as monstrous, and Linton draws on many of her culture's most cliched tropes in her representation of this darker feminine side. Fanny's soft, round, womanly body and full red lips contrast sharply with Adele's feral, serpentine form: "Her black eyes were wild; her arched nostrils dilated; her lips, thin, sinuous, flexible, were pressed tight over her small square teeth" (p. 285). The figure of the monstrous female Other is hardly unusual in Victorian literature, although the shades of vampirism coloring the representation of Adele (the references to teeth and sinuous lips sug gest that she is the real lamia in the tale) add a suggestive twist. For Adele is not merely a dark mirror image, Wicked Queen to Fanny's Snow White; her predatory, penetrating gaze is clearly turned on the young wife's body.26 Indeed, her intense consciousness of Fanny's blood-red lips and voluptuous figure arguably shapes the text. As Adele moves to destroy the young wife, the narrator notes the sharp erotic pull, the libidinal motivation at the heart of the violent embrace: "Quick as thought Adele pinioned the strong 289</page><page sequence="8">white arms whose shape and beauty had so often maddened her with jeal ous pain . . ." (p. 290). Adele's resonance partly depends on the "deviance" of her erotic appetite, I would argue-on her passionate desire for Monsieur Cabanel, certainly, but also on her deep consciousness of and desire to control the body of Fanny Cabanel. The text partly controls its homoerotic possibili ties by killing the housekeeper: she ultimately leaps into the pit prepared for Fanny, thereby performing her own punishment as a vampire (although as a suicide she may become, in very truth, a revenant). In Linton's later narratives however, lesbian attraction itself merges into "mysterious force[s]"; investigations of women's desires and the possibilities of the occult are yoked closely together. As we shall see, Linton's attraction to what lay beyond the realms of polite social intercourse and Christian the ological debate increasingly drove an uneasy fascination with culturally uncharted territories of female experience. However, as I shall argue, the treatment of such experiences in Linton's work may be seen not simply as evidence of encoded, unconscious, or repressed lesbianism but more specif ically as a part of the author's ongoing inquiries into unfathomed urges and desires.27 "[Tihough I have never seen a medium who was not a patent trickster," she remarked in The Autobiography of Christopher Kirkland in 1885, "I believe that there is an uncatalogued and perhaps undeveloped human force" (II, 25). "The Rebel of the Family" and "The Autobiography of Christopher Kirkland" A number of critics have observed that The Rebel of the Family (1880), one of Linton's better-known texts, incorporates an obviously lesbian char acter, a women's rights activist named Bell Blount.28 Linton's startlingly frank portrait of Bell and her "little wife" (I, p. 76) Connie has obscured the text's engagement with other, importantly related themes, less mean ingful perhaps to readers today-the unsettling operation of occult forces in everyday social and familial contexts. The novel describes the struggles of three impecunious middle-class sisters, Thomasina, Perdita (the heroine of the narrative), and Eva Winstanley.29 Perdita is alienated from the rest of her family by her desire to support herself and be of some value to the world; she also believes in romantic love as the true basis for a marriage (and absolute wifely submission thereafter). Her mother and sisters, mean while, endorse the shabby-genteel policy of "keeping up appearances"; they preserve the aspect of an easy competence to attract eligible husbands and secure a life of self-indulgence. So far, so straightforward: these are the conventional themes of Victorian domestic fiction (namely, the effects of Mammon on the purity of a young girl).30 However, the youngest, fairest daughter of the family, lit 290</page><page sequence="9">tle Eva, is a more unusual creation, a sinister Jekyll-and-Hyde-type char acter lurking at the heart of a domestic realist narrative. In one descrip tion, this apparently charming ingenue turns into a lamia within the space of a sentence: "Her laugh was as musical as a bird's song; and when she threw back her head and opened her mouth she showed two full rows of the loveliest little sharp white teeth that can be imagined-very small, very even; but for all their beauty, teeth that somehow suggested the eat ing of flesh.""3 Eva is the docile Fanny Cabanel viewed through a different lens; Linton focuses the reader's attention on her (apparent) signifiers of feminine virtue-fair complexion, blue eyes, pretty face-and invites the reader to ponder what lies behind: [Eva's] wildflower face was so guileless, her blue eyes so ingenuous, her man ner so simple, her affectionateness so transparent! She was such a bewitching combination of clevemess and simplicity, of childish grace and womanly charm, of harmless little sensualities-how the red ripe lips closed over bon bons, and the white sharp little teeth buried themselves in the fleshy pulp of fruit!-and of naive innocence of evil, that no man with a man's heart in him could fail to be touched when she chose to stir him. (III, 229) As if the references to touching and stirring were not enough, Eva's con sumption of fruit activates an atavistic sense of her namesake's transgres sion, reinterpreted as lascivious delight in "flesh." The girl's appetites are carnal in the fullest sense of the word: "Eva laughed and showed all those small white teeth of hers; her red lips and white teeth so curiously sugges tive of the double action-kissing and eating" (I, 172-73). The shallow Mrs. Winstanley has encouraged her daughters to see courtship as a kind of hunt, with themselves-like the vampire-as both bait and consumers. However, Eva preys most successfully on men suscep tible to prevailing myths of femininity, and Linton satirizes the gullibility of such characters mercilessly: To [Sir James Keamey, one of Eva's suitors] women were lovely creatures to be painted in pictures and celebrated in poetry . . . gracefully reclining on shining silken couches, and drinking scented tea out of egg-shell china cups; while he, the adorer, sat on a low chair by their side, and poured out nine teenth century dithyrambics to their honour, all in prose and with due regard to decent drapery. (I, 248) In moments like this, Linton seems to adopt Eva's standpoint; if wealthy men like Kearney cannot see through their own facile preconceptions, they deserve everything they get. Yet, rather as in "The Fate of Madame Cabanel," the reader is offered a series of conflicting perspectives. Eva is sometimes aligned with the narrator's gaze and at other times is the focus of investigation; similarly, she is both the dangerous seducer of others and herself the object of seduction. Thus even as she leads the foolish Kearney 291</page><page sequence="10">to his fate, Eva becomes embroiled in an illicit affair with a dangerous, apparently aristocratic Frenchman named Bois-Duval. There is no ques tion who has the upper hand in this relationship: Bois-Duval mesmerizes Eva, flattering her and soothing her qualms about secret correspondences and midnight meetings between the unmarried ("Mesmerine," John Jones noted in 1861, "acts on some patients as a narcotic, it soothes-a quiet steals over the body . . .").&gt; Linton explicitly depicts Bois-Duval's gentle cajoling and subtle coaxing to surrender as the tactic of a vampiric beast: "It was the soothing fanning of the vampire-bat," she remarks, "but it meant the life's blood" (II, 124). Linton-anticipating Stoker-taps into the longstanding cultural asso ciation of continental mesmerists with vampires in her representation of the saturnine Bois-Duval.33 The practice of mesmerism had been anxiously coupled with vampirism since its introduction to Britain's shores in the 1830s, a correlation possibly founded upon the sadomasochistic dynamic at the heart of both exchanges. In mesmerism, the (usually male) practitioner exerts absolute control over the body of a swooning, incapable (and usu ally female) subject. Victorian commentators anxiously remarked the eroticism of the encounter, even the literal possibilities for illicit sexual congress on the mesmerist's couch: the mesmerist could steal the honor of his helpless subject while she lay in a trance, or perhaps she might pretend to be unconscious in order to experience the pleasures of intercourse with out guilt.34 Famous Victorian vampires-such as Varney, Carmilla, and Dracula-actualize these anxieties: the gaze becomes a critical weapon in the vampiric armory, phase one of a two-pronged attack (gaze, bite). Victims are invariably mesmerized into a consensual state of erotic surren der; for example, Rymer's Flora Bannerworth lingers dangerously in her bed, enthralled by the power of Varney's gaze: "her eyes are fascinated. The glance of a serpent could not have produced a greater effect upon her than did the fixed gaze of those awful, metallic-looking eyes."35 The hypnotic stare of the vampire allows it to take what it wants from the body of its swooning victim; the submissive victim tends subsequently-suspiciously perhaps-to recall the violation with a hazy, mingled sense of pleasure and pain. In The Rebel of the Family, illicit responses-the urge to forget cultural norms and surrender to incipient desires-are pervasively ascribed to the force of a mesmerizing gaze. Eva is an all-too-willing victim, suggesting per haps Linton's skepticism about the veracity of the mesmerized subject's state. Elsewhere, however, the novel reveals a very different approach to the power of the mesmerizer's stare. For Perdita, the text's protagonist, is also stalked by a dangerous, hypnotic, sensual predator-the lesbian women's rights activist Bell Blount. Bell has a habit of gently stroking 292</page><page sequence="11">Perdita's hand and a fondness for gazing "at her with such a strange expres sion....." Perdita is both ineluctably drawn to the "leading of [Bell's] soft, milk-white, caressing hand" (I, 66) and horrified by her feelings of attrac tion to the older woman and her feminist political cause: "[Bell] had a strong fascination for Perdita-a fascination which the girl was half afraid and half ashamed to confess to herself" (I, 283). Bell's hypnotic stare and slow hand movements are themselves strongly reminiscent of the mesmer izer's techniques (mesmerizers often sent their patients into a trance by making a series of hand passes over or on the subject's body). Indeed, the older woman's mesmerizing tactics are never clearer than when her effort to enthrall the young girl abruptly fails: while Bell is stroking the girl's hand and Perdita is gazing up at her mentor, suddenly "something in Mrs. Blount's face chilled and repelled her... ." An unmistakably trance-like state is broken: "A little shiver passed over her like the quivering of the leaves above her head. Her colour faded, her eyes drooped and involuntar ily she sighed" (I, 66). The use of mesmerism to facilitate lesbian eroticism intriguingly recalls Le Fanu's scandalous (and then recently published) "Carmilla" (1872). Le Fanu adds a twist to the cultural association of vampire with libidinous mesmerizer in this tale, for, unsettling the normative male-dominant to female-submissive correlations, the mesmerizer becomes a woman who desires, pursues, and erotically dominates another woman.36 Like Perdita, Le Fanu's heroine admits to oscillating feelings of "strange, tumultuous excitement" and "vague . . . fear and disgust" when the fascinating Carmilla is near: Sometimes ... my strange and beautiful companion would take my hand and hold it with a fond pressure, renewed again and again; blushing softly, gazing in my face with languid and buming eyes, and breathing so fast that her dress rose and fell with the tumultuous respiration. It was like the ardour of a lover; it embarrassed me; it was hateful and yet overpowering; and with gloating eyes she drew me to her, and her hot lips travelled along my cheek in kisses.37 Linton, with her interest in vampires and the supernatural, may well have read Le Fanu's story, which appeared alongside one of her own pieces in the short-lived periodical Dark Blue. Certainly, Carmilla seems to exert a shad owy influence over her novel,38 for Linton, like Le Fanu, aligns the preda tory mesmerizer with dangerous yet thrilling alternatives to prevailing sex ual and political norms: scenes of choice are unmistakably erotic and eroti cized. When Perdita agrees to meet Connie behind her mother's back, for example, Bell attempts a heated embrace: "Mrs. Blount's face flushed vividly. She startled and nearly scared Perdita by suddenly taking her in her arms and kissing her with strange warmth" (I, 74). Perdita, the reader notes, is only "nearly" scared by Bell, and the slight reference is indicative 293</page><page sequence="12">of Perdita's ambivalent yet inescapable feelings of attraction.39 Faced with Bell's powerful desire and relentless pursuit, not to mention the opportu nities she presents for a purposeful life and a wider sphere of action, the girl "felt bewildered and shocked, while at the same time she was fascinated and attracted" (I, 73). Although many critics have argued that the text is ambivalent about contemporary ideals and myths of femininity-that, in spite of its explicit support for marriage and a domestic feminine life, it registers significant support for Perdita's desire to support herself-no critic has positioned its uncertainties and compromises in relation to the text's broader agnosti cism.40 Yet the life Perdita glimpses through Bell is described as an "indis tinct glimpse into the vast Unknown" (I, 65), and the reader attuned to Linton's fascination with mysterious phenomena will surely recognize the heady blend of uncertainty and attraction instilled in this short phrase the sense of the unknown as terrifying but "magnificent."41 In the context of the novel, the phrase "indistinct glimpse into the vast Unknown" pro vides a moment in which the unfathomed clearly extends to include fem inism and lesbianism, and Linton's hesitant fascination with the meta physical unknown enlarges suggestively to her narrative's approach to such uncharted sexual and political female experiences.42 Perdita's oscillations between bewilderment and shock, fascination and attraction are dynami cally related to and indicative of the text's agnostic attitude towards Bell. Linton's later works often use a composite occultist-agnostic lexicon to describe strong attachments between women. Such terminology brings into play both the writer's sense of the magnificence of "mysterious force[s]" and her concerns about the overwhelming, vertiginous expanse of the unknown. In The Autobiography of Christopher Kirkland, both aspects operate in the author's masked account of her feelings for a young married woman named Adeline Dalrymple (Linton adopted the persona of "Christopher" to provide "a screen which takes off the sting of boldness and self-exposure") :3 I could have walked safely over a footwide ledge with a precipice on each side of me, but my head swam when Adeline Dalrymple laid her long white hand on my shoulder and I put my arm round her supple stayless waist; and I was faint and giddy before I had made a couple of tums round the room. What anguish it was to stop, and yet how impossible to go on! Why was I so weak? (I, 181) Linton suggests here that an unfathomed power ("Why was I so weak?") prompts the powerful responses to Adeline. Indeed, Adeline's gaze-like Bell's-is powerfully mesmerizing: gazing up into her beloved's face, Linton tells us "I was as if spiritually carried away into another sphere; and for the moment I was not human but immortal. It was a sensation beyond mere 294</page><page sequence="13">physical excitement; and it would have been appalling from its intensity, had I had enough consciousness left to examine or reflect" (I, 201). Despite references to Adeline's beautiful hands and waist, Linton increasingly works to locate her feelings for her beloved on a spiritual rather than a physical plane: she abstracts the episode from the realm of sentience and rationality, suggesting that this relationship is outside nor mal social intercourse and that the force of the attraction is beyond choice or decision. This becomes easier after Adeline and she have separated: I saw her in the stars and found her in the skies; I heard her in the voice of the waters and traced her outline in the misty foldings of the silent hills.... She was everywhere-everywhere; the one unchangeable circumstance traceable behind all different forms.... She held me and possessed me-as she had said she ever would. She stole between me and heaven, and when I prayed to God I thought of her. She was fire in my veins and ice in my heart.... (I, 217) Adeline is no longer a mere body. All-encompassing, all-encircling, she dissolves the boundary between self and other, spiritually fusing with and into Linton ("She held me and possessed me.... She was fire in my veins and ice in my heart").44 Biographers and critics have been astonished by the intense eroticism of these passages: Layard attempts to pass them off as a school-girl crush, while Anderson observes that they reveal "an authentic lesbian orienta tion."45 Neither makes much reference to the spiritualistic or agnostic frame of the encounters. Anderson notes only that Linton's attraction to Adeline was "infused with her persistent deep longings for mothering" and speculates that Linton "probably wistfully imagined secret communica tions and mystical bondings" with her dead mother.46 In other words, Anderson responds to the suggestive eroticism of the encounters by fore grounding stifled emotions, inarticulacy, and the promptings of the uncon scious. By contrast, I locate open intellectual engagement within the con flicts that characterize the text. Linton's spiritualist discourse is not simply an exercise in concealing the real (sexual) nature of her involvement with Adeline, I would argue: the relationship between the two women was key in the development of Linton's occultist agnosticism, first, because Adeline was herself flirting with new systems of belief ("She believed in the interfusion of souls . . .," 1, 197), and second, because communications with a distant God emphatically failed to compare with the erotic charge of the two women's intercourse.47 A brief kiss from Adeline, Linton reveals, exposed the natural order of the world in a way that organized reli gion never had: "Henceforth all things were transformed for me, and life meant a new existence as it had a new message.... Nature had a secret language which was revealed to me, and I understood the hidden meaning of things which hitherto had had no meaning at all" (I, 202-03).41 295</page><page sequence="14">Erotic passion not only takes on the character of the unknown, it also becomes a manifestation of its power; glimpses of its force provide a momentary sense of grand, transcendent, immutable order. At the same time, however, Linton's relation of the two keeps the erotic distant; she locates (and contains) physical passion in the realm of the unfathomable.49 Eroticism is felt rather than "known" in this text; this is not to say that the author is unconscious of its force but rather that she viewed it as something profoundly, ultimately, epistemologically unknowable. "The Second Youth of Theodora Desanges" Yet the "secret language" of Nature is not always associated with mean ing and order in Linton's work. The idealistic, optimistic charge of the agnostic's open-minded approach vanishes almost entirely in her extraor dinary final novel, which was published posthumously. The Second Youth of Theodora Desanges (1900) constitutes the writer's most sustained explo ration of "an uncatalogued and perhaps undeveloped human force"; in this text, however, the unknowableness of natural phenomena is a terrifying problem that only death can resolve. On the one hand, the novel contin ues to reveal Linton's anger at close-minded social, cultural, and scientific attitudes to "abnormal" human (specifically female) physical experiences and desires. The story of a woman who finds herself unexpectedly growing younger instead of older, The Second Youth of Theodora Desanges argues that materialist science and a broad range of contemporary social, cultural, and philosophical groups have failed to comprehend the full range of human phenomena, iniquitously branding as deviant all that falls outside their narrow scope of inquiry. At the same time, the protagonist's own inability to ascribe a cause to her unorthodox experience becomes a painful source of social and familial isolation. The inscrutability of the natural world is no longer a comforting sign of transcendent order in this novel. The narra tive's inability to interpret "nature's mysteries," to rise to the level of the "known," becomes a source of suicidal pessimism. The elderly narrator, Theodora Desanges, begins by describing an extra ordinary sequence of events. At seventy (near Linton's own age at the time of writing), she falls dangerously ill; as she recovers, she begins miracu lously to grow younger and more beautiful. Her adopted daughter Esther is horrified by the charismatic, youthful woman Theodora becomes;50 Esther's husband and son fall victim to her charms. This sets a pattern for the rest of the novel: women are disgusted and suspicious of Theodora's rejuvenated looks, while men fall foolishly at her feet. In spite of the atten tion and the opportunities that a new youth presents, Theodora becomes increasingly prey to ennui. Disillusioned with love, unconvinced by phil anthropy, and unsatisfied by religion, she turns to politics. Using her extra 296</page><page sequence="15">ordinary personal magnetism, she manipulates members of the government and comes to possess great political influence, altering Britain's foreign policy on several key issues. Unsurprisingly, however, London society fears her seemingly preternatural influence, particularly as friends and foes die suddenly and in unexplained circumstances. Widely characterized as a vampire, she ends the narrative friendless and waiting for death. The Second Youth of Theodora Desanges begins as a kind of anti-Shirley. Charlotte Bronte opened her 1849 novel by assuring the reader that the story would be a realistic account, "something unromantic as Monday morning": "If you think . .. that anything like a romance is preparing for you, reader, you never were more mistaken."51 Linton's narrator prepares her readers to expect a tale of wonder-a tale that may arouse doubt and disbelief: "The story I am about to tell may read to the sceptical as an impossible romance... ." Yet, she proceeds, in an age of marvels, who can draw the line between the ordinary and the extraordinary? With the spectroscope and the phonograph, the germinative force of formic acid, the liquefaction of air, the Rontgen rays, and the new telegraphy, how can we say that any marvel in molecular arrangement is impossible? We have not come to the dry land nor touched bottom yet.... We have not made it clear why decay should not be arrested, and death set infinitely farther off than at present, and until we have really exhausted the whole range of nat ural causes and necessary results-until we are really as gods, knowing not only good and evil, but sources and issues-until we have stripped the Tree of Knowledge bare to its last leaf, we cannot say that such and such an abnor mality is a lie and a figment.52 The final phrase is an intriguing statement in the wake of the sentenc ing of Oscar Wilde in 1895; it may seem surprising to find a fin-de-siecle conservative emphasizing the instability of concepts of normality when, as Sally Ledger has pointed out, the trial was followed by an intense phase of "moral rearguard action."53 Yet Theodora escapes such implications by sit uating her manifesto firmly in relation to contemporary metaphysical debates: her allusion to "natural causes and necessary results," for instance, references the doctrine of harmonious cause and effect developed by agnostics such as T. H. Huxley.54 In terms of Linton's own development, such passages suggest a swing towards occultism as presenting the most open-minded approach to the unexplained and the operations of nature. Indeed, Theodora's affinity with occult theosophy emerges in the slighting phrase "Until we are really as gods." Late-Victorian theosophists were par ticularly vocal challengers of what they saw as the arrogance of modern science, on the one hand, its claims to be able to explain and order the world, and, on the other hand, its neglect of all that fell outside its narrow scope of measurement.55 Linton, as we know, was well acquainted with the 297</page><page sequence="16">eminent theosopher A. P. Sinnett, author of Esoteric Buddhism (1881) and The Occult World (1883). Hints of Linton's conversations with Sinnett appear to inform her representation of Theodora.56 Like the thesophists, Linton's narrator disputes commonly drawn boundary lines between real and fantastic phenomena, stressing that narrow interpretations of reality blind us to what Sinnett called "a multitude of Nature's most interesting mysteries."57 Or, as Theodora puts it, "The mysteries of nature are so many, and the possibilities of that vis medicatrix, of which we know only the out side fringe, are so deep and wide, that it falls on the side of presumption to say this and that cannot possibly be-this and that are but travellers' tales" (p. 1).58 Yet the narrative cannot sustain theosophical or agnostic attempts at idealism (rather like agnostics, theosophists were convinced of the essen tial justice and coherence of the world; they also believed in the possibil ity of reincarnation).59 Faced with family rejection and the deaths of close friends, the narrator becomes deeply pessimistic in her account of a wretched, lonely, and futile existence, revealing an intense longing for release from suffering. Linton's only partial support of a movement like theosophy is perfectly consistent with her explicitly stated position as a resolute skeptic, of course. However, the text generates another reason for mistrust: at one point Theodora distances herself from "the spiritualists or theosophists, or by what name soever they call themselves" because such groups have joined the rest of society in accusing her of vampirism (p. 218). Drawing selectively from theosophical ideas about the inadequacies of science to explain human and natural phenomena, Theodora subse quently suggests that theosophy as a movement is unable to accept her par ticular brand of "abnormality." Isolated from her family from the beginning of the novel, she thus also becomes isolated from groups that might have been expected to show intellectual sympathy for her plight. For some time, erotic attachments serve as the only tie connecting Theodora to life. In the first half of the novel, she is uninterested in the men who flock around her. Gentlemen subsequently disappear from the narrative like lemmings from a cliff, blowing out their brains for love of her, slipping into idiotism, or simply "going to the bad." However, as life becomes monotonous, she discovers a reason for living through Lord Keswick, a powerful politician whom she manages to control. Lady Keswick is no match for the magnetic Theodora: I destroyed his old temple and built up the new, and overthrew the wife's hitherto predominant power. I did, as I believed, take out the old heart and put a new one into its place. It was not my influence. It had nothing to do with magnetism, personality, psychic force, what not. It was the implanting 298</page><page sequence="17">of sound principles which now took root and grew of themselves. So I believed, and was jubilant accordingly. (pp. 210-1 1) The "so I believed" is interesting, suggesting an ambivalence about the source of her influence-a hint that perhaps her ascendancy over Lady Keswick did have something to do with "magnetism, personality, psychic force." Elsewhere she uses occult terms more assertively to describe her control of Lord Keswick, casting her influence as a spirit that aggressively enters his body: "I took that inert mass of mental potentiality . . . and infused him with my own spirit," she gloats (p. 233). These are curious terms for Theodora to use, given her repeated efforts to deny all charges of vampirism; for indeed, the pleasures of the "spirit" described here resonate with the erotic pleasures of the vampire. Vampires do not only assert con trol over an Other by taking from that Other but also by entering him or her; they do not merely drain blood from their victims, they infuse them with their own character (eventually turning them into vampires them selves).60 Lord Keswick is similarly transformed by Theodora's "spirit": while initially he is "limp and mentally unbraced, in mind what a dram drinker is in nerves while waiting for his morning's draught," after inter course with her he becomes "vigorous and vitalised" (pp. 234, 35). At the heart of Theodora's assault on Lord Keswick's masculine identity is an attack on his sense of himself, one might say on his ego boundaries, and the interaction between vampire and victim provides the terms for a sug gestively similar process in which the difference between self and other is eroded, even dissolved. Indeed, the pleasure of the process for Theodora lies not only in the assertion of control over Keswick but also in the process of establishing her autonomy at the expense of his own. She is the master in their dynamically sadomasochistic liaison:61 "in accepting my direction he had abandoned his own initiative, and had become the docile servant of my will-seeming, indeed, to have made himself a mere instrument, on which I might play at my pleasure. He spoke as I dictated, voted as I decided, and ordered his social and domestic life by my advice" (p. 229). Excited by her tangible impact on man and politics alike, Theodora becomes as controlling as a Bell Blount or Bois-Duval, and her influence spreads like Dracula's spores. Soon salons of young men are under her control, synchronically imbibing her opinions and losing their auto nomy: "I bent them to my will," she crows, "and imbued them with my ideas" (p. 242). Thus eroticism brings new meaning to life, although Theodora strenu ously denies actual sexual congress with Lord Keswick in much the same way that she denies the operation of occult forces. The parity of the denials reaffirms their kinship; for, as in the works examined earlier, Linton's nar rative frames its discussion of women's desires-sexual and political-in 299</page><page sequence="18">metaphysical (rather than physical) language, bringing into play an essen tially intellectual discourse on human potential and the world's unbounded depths. "Abnormal" female behavior is presented in the context of theo sophical debates on science and nature; close-minded attitudes to the humanly unorthodox are described as either indicative of the broader fail ings of rationalist science or examples of rank superstition. Indeed, the final pages of the novel form a reprise of "The Fate of Madame Cabanel"; like the earlier text, The Second Youth of Theodora Desanges marshals national prejudices in its scornful treatments of com munity-wide hysteria. Theodora is viewed as a vampire by her local Italian community ("the belief in vampires still lingers even with educated people in Italy," p. 321), although such attitudes are not the exclusive preserve of "foreigners" in the text. Lord Keswick's second wife echoes Martin Briolic, the gravedigger, as she calls for Theodora's destruction: "If she is not killed she will murder others. She is a vampire and lives on human blood" (p. 321). Friendless and desperate, Theodora ultimately becomes a solitary, tormented wanderer on the face of the earth-literally one of the restless undead. Her body, no longer a site of pleasure, is a burden; the desire for the unknown is translated into the desire for the body's demise. "Farewell, then, to the known and exhausted," she remarks in the final lines of the novel: "welcome to the unknown and unfathomed!" (p. 335). Given the force of lesbian eroticism in much of Linton's work and the suggestive overlapping of vampirism and lesbianism in "The Fate of Madame Cabanel" and The Rebel of the Family, it is possible to read The Second Youth of Theodora Desanges as a plea for the understanding of lesbian desire. The charge of vampirism, one could argue, is code for the charge of lesbianism, and possibly feminism also; Linton's criticism of society's will ingness to characterize unorthodox female desires as abnormal presents a subversive, if disguised criticism of cultural attitudes to lesbian sexuality and the New Women's demands. Sue-Ellen Case has argued that vampires in nineteenth-century literature and culture are lesbian virtually by defin ition: "The double 'she,' in combination with the queer fanged creature, produces the vampire. The vampire is the queer in its lesbian mode."62 Such a reading of The Second Youth of Theodora Desanges would appear to me, however, to transform Linton's Byzantine approach to women's desires into something that looks suspiciously clean, straightforward, and twenty first-century in cast. Linton was not, this article has argued, a radical. Rather than treating the lacunae in Linton's work in essentially psychological terms (as evi dence of either unconscious or secret subversiveness), this essay has attempted to shift context and register alike, reading ambiguous treat ments of women and sexuality in the light of Linton's broader intellectual 300</page><page sequence="19">agnosticism. The author's approach to women and women's desires has emerged less as part of a determination to subvert or transform society's attitudes to "deviant" impulses and more as part of a deep-seated sense that such urges were powerful, even magnificent, yet unknowable. To risk an oversimplification, the suggestive conflicts and ambiguities that may appear to be evidence of unconscious (or covert) subversiveness emerge as part of Linton's agnostic fascination with the unknowable. Indeed, The Second Youth of Theodora Desanges emphasizes that Linton conceived a broad range of erotic urges in this way: magnetic attraction (to resituate the erotic in the writer's occultist framework) exists powerfully between men and women as well as between women and women in Linton's oeuvre. Linton's final novel also suggests, however, a pained, hopeless anger at the apparently unrelenting unknowableness of all such unfathomed forces. Conclusion Gillian Beer has argued against the critical tendency to fill textual gaps with our own meanings-to privilege our view of the world then locate it, magically, in the literature of the past. "We are not at work on a supine or docile text which we can colonise with our meaning or meanings," Beer contends. "Why do we so value gaps and contradiction? Is it because it allows us to exercise a kind of social control . . . ?"63 The conflicts and ambiguities in Linton's work-and in the works of numerous Victorian women writers-have regularly been used to argue for concealed or sub merged radicalism. I have suggested, by contrast, that Linton's conflicted attitudes to women and sexuality form part of a broader agnosticism-that her uncertainty about mythologies of gender is embedded within a broader uncertainty about Victorian efforts to explain and order uncharted natural and human phenomena. Indeed, I believe a closer examination of the influence of agnosticism on the intellectual landscape of the Victorian period may yield rich results. Attention to agnosticism facilitates a rethinking of the common view of Victorian women writers as secretly sub versive or repressed; and it fills the voids of ambiguity with ideas and intel lectual engagement. Yet the process of filling those gaps must involve close attention to the detailed concerns of the past-to an author's involvement in "controversies and desires which are not concerned with us" as well as those that are.64 Spiritualism, mesmerism, and theosophy may seem alien and obsolete to us now, but Linton investigated them with the same seri ousness she used to approach women's political demands and the unprompted urges of the female body. We may understand why the Victorian Linton chose not to discuss phys ical attraction between women fully and openly; it may be harder to grasp her support for the most restrictive views on women's suffrage, higher edu 301</page><page sequence="20">cation, and the New Woman. She moved, after all, in literary circles filled with people who held comparatively advanced ideas on women's roles; thus it seems hard to believe that her milieu simply forced her to celebrate women's occupation of the domestic sphere. Attention to the contradic tions characterizing Linton's broader intellectual position is once again instructive. Linton, in spite of her agnosticism and occultist leanings, was outwardly a staunch practicing Christian. She explains this apparent inconsistency in a letter to a friend: You call me 'mad' and all sorts of injurious things, because . . [I] do all that I can to strengthen the faith-and with the faith-the practising my igno rant servants in the Christian religion [sic]-concealing from them my own unbelief as a thing with which they have nothing to do-a thing which con cems my own self only. As a member of the community I feel bound to sup port so far openly the Established Church. All my intelligent friends here know the real truth, and some of them are in exactly the same state as myself-unbelievers in the mythology, but conformists outwards for the sake of the weaker brethren-and those who have children for the sake of the children.65 Linton can be positioned within a long tradition of thinkers who have pur sued the Platonic policy of the "noble lie" in the service of the greater social good. "Reason leads us to absolute agnosticism," she explains else where in the same letter, "but do you want your children to be without a guide to good living? ... Why throw open the doors to them to every kind of sinful excess by taking from them all the restraints of religion?"66 I sug gest that Linton extended this policy to matters of gender and sexuality that she was as bothered by "the mythology" of womanhood as she was by the mythology of Christianity, but that she feared the social chaos that might ensue from the full dismantling of contemporary gender relations. Linton believed that women, as a gender, needed to be chaste, innocent, moderate, and gentle so as to implant and cultivate decent virtues in their children and their husbands; her criticisms of women's entrance into the public sphere (through higher education, enfranchisement, or employ ment) invariably centered around fears of the social and national degener ation that would follow the loss of this wholesome moral check.67 Yet Linton recognized that an innocent (and thus socially responsible) woman was not and should not be culturally reduced to a vapid cipher, a mytho logical invention-an angel in the house. Agnosticism provided her with a highly suggestive mode of thinking about such questions: one that rejected the mythological; one that allowed for the existence of unsettling, unfathomable, natural forces; and one that centrally authorized the indi vidual to hold and adjudicate between ideas that conflicted-to quest rather than to resolve. "I do not claim to have ever drawn her away from 302</page><page sequence="21">[a] resolutely agnostic position in all [occult] matters," Sinnett told Layard, somewhat wistfully.68 The conflicts and ambiguities surrounding her treat ment of women and women's desires can, in a similar fashion, be seen less as indicative of submerged radicalism or covert subversiveness and more as part of an enduring belief that agnosticism was the most appropriate posi tion for a conscientious Victorian intellectual.

Thompson (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999), p. 3. Subsequent references will be cited parenthetically in the text. 2 Thompson, as I indicate in the body of the text, argues against the use of the radical/conservative binary in discussions of Victorian women's writing, and so far I am in accord. However, her critical readings of Victorian fictions proceed to dis cuss the ways in which writers subvert the "apparent [conservatism]" of their texts and to identify the "dialogic interplay of competing voices [that] can be glimpsed below the surface of the plot" (pp. 5,4). This article will contest the view of gen der dialogues as subterranean in texts by writers such as Linton, reading them instead as evidence of open intellectual engagement with issues that are found to be unresolveable. 3 Monica Cohen, "Maximizing Oliphant: Begging the Question and the Politics of Satire," in Victorian Woman Writers and the Woman Question, p. 101; qtd. by Thompson, p. 4. 4 Thompson refers to Yonge's 1865 novel, The Clever Woman of the Family. 5 Linton is chiefly remembered today for her article on "The Girl of the Period" and her attacks on the "Wild Women" (the 1890s' New Woman). See Eliza Lynn Linton, "The Girl of the Period," Saturday Review, 25 (1868), 339-40; "The Wild Women, No. I, 'As Politicians,'" "Partisans of the Wild Women," "The Wild Women as Social Insurgents," Nineteenth Century, 31 (1892), 79-88, 455-64, 596 605. 6 Helen Small first encouraged me to think about agnosticism as a model for Linton's approach to gender and sexuality. My thanks to her and to Kate Flint, Margaret Homans, Daniel Markovits, and three anonymous Tuha Studies reviewers for reading and commenting on this article. All mistakes and misreadings are, of course, my own.

Gladstone singled Linton out in an 1885 article censuring agnosticism; Linton wrote an essay in response to Gladstone's comments that was published alongside essays by Gladstone's other tar gets.

This was an epistemological claim that, as Lightman argues, owed much to traditions of Christian theological debate. Agnosticism is not a unified or cohesive system of thought; many defined them selves as agnostic in the nineteenth century and yet held highly individual approaches to science, nature, the unknown, the notion of a deity. Obviously, in this article, I am primarily concerned with Linton's position as she conceived it. 11 In 1845, aged twenty-three, Linton left the parental home and began to sup port herself as a writer. For further discussion on the doctrinal and philosophical relationships between agnosticism and psychical research in later nineteenth-cen tury England, see chapter 4 in Janet Oppenheim's The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850-1914 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985), pp. 111-58. 12 Linton knew all four of these writers. For further discussion on spiritualism and mesmerism in the nineteenth century, see Ruth Brandon, The Spiritualists: The Passion for the Occult in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries (London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1983); Fred Kaplan, Dickens and Mesmerism: The Hidden Springs of Fiction (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1975); Oppenheim, The Other World; Alex Owen, The Darkened Room: Women, Power, and Spiritualism in Late Nineteenth-Century England (London: Virago, 1989); Katherine H.

(London: Chatto and Windus, 1880). 17 Sinnett, qtd. in Layard, p. 176. According to Sinnett, Linton believed "that in her youth she had been susceptible in a high degree to mesmeric influence" (p. 176). 18 In Witch Stories (London: Chapman and Hall, 1861), p. iv, Linton explicitly draws parallels between belief in witches and the Victorian fascination with mes merism: 304</page><page sequence="23">Those who believe in direct and personal intercourse between the spirit world and man, will probably accept every account with the unquestioning belief of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries . . . those who have seen much of disease and that strange condition called "mesmerism," or "sensi tiveness," will allow the presence of absolute nervous derangement, mixed up with a vast amount of conscious deception, which the insane credulity and marvelous ignorance of the time rendered easy to practise. . . .

Scoffern, "Vampyres," The St. James's Magazine, 10 (1864), 30-38. 25 The first clause indicates a strong anti-Catholic prejudice, although Linton was also suspicious of Anglican Christianity. In addition, Linton's class prejudices are clearly in evidence in these passages. 26 Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar, of course, evolved this model as a means of understanding nineteenth-century women's representations of women in The Madwoman in the Attic: The Woman Writer and the Nineteenth-Century Literary Imagination (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1979). In "What Has Never Been: An Overview of Lesbian Feminist Literary Criticism," in Feminisms, ed. Robyn R. Warhol and Diane Price Herndl (New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1997), p. 78, Bonnie Zimmerman later pointed out that "the authors' tendency to inter pret all pairs of female characters as aspects of the self sometimes serves to mask a relationship that a lesbian reader might interpret as bonding or love between women." 27 Many critics have argued that Linton was a lesbian. I shall discuss the pre sentation of lesbian desire in Linton's work (and in Linton criticism) in more detail presently. 28 See, for example, Anderson, p. 165; Deborah T Meem, "Eliza Lynn Linton and the Rise of Lesbian Consciousness," Journal of the History of Sexuality, 7 (1997), 305</page><page sequence="24">548-52; Valerie Sanders, Eve's Renegades: Victorian Anti-Feminist Women Novelists (Basingstoke: Macmillan, 1996), p. 70. Meem reprises her argument in her Introduction to a recent edition of The Rebel of the Family (Peterborough, Ontario: Broadview, 2002), esp. pp. 11-14. 29 Critics have argued that Linton's representation of Perdita is semi-autobio graphical: see Anderson, pp. 30 and 163-67, in particular. 30 See, for example, Annie Edwardes's The Morals of May fair (1858); Holme Lee's Maud Talbot (1854) and Sylvan Holt's Daughter (1858); Mrs. Egerton's The Countess's Cross (1868); and Eliza L.

Jones believed in a mysterious substance called "mesmerine," which was necessary for health and healing. He defined it as "a chemical combination scientifically mixed by nature . . . when applied with an earnest will by passing the warm hand over ... it acts at once; and by stimulating the physical powers, enables [the person] to overcome an obstruc tion, and perform their functions naturally" (p. 123). 33 Thomas Wakley regarded the "invasion" of continental mesmeric practition ers in the 1830s as the introduction of the vampire to Britain: mesmerists were coming across the Channel looking for "fresh food" to feed their "libidinous propensities," he complained; see [Thomas Wakley], "The Virtues of Animal Magnetism," Lancet, 8 December 1838, qtd. in Winter, p. 21. Fears about the spread of alien, pestilential occult phenomena from (in particular) "the charismatic French to the susceptible English, and from men to women" were commonly expressed (Winter, p. 23). 34 For further discussion of these anxieties, see Winter, pp. 101-02. 35 Rymer, I, 3. Edmund Oilier subsequently described "the fixed and glassy stare of the phantom" as a key distinguishing feature in his pseudo-anthropological arti cle on broucolacs (p. 39). 36 Reviewers described "Carmilla" as "the most foolish and the most offensive of all [Le Fanu's] tales," in In a Glass Darkly. One, clearly disturbed by its lesbian eroti cism, described the story as an account of "unnatural yearning and passion"; see the review of "In a Glass Darkly," Saturday Review, 34 (1872), 223; "Novels of the Week," Athenaeum, 6 July 1872, p. 13. 37 Sheridan Le Fanu, "Carmilla," In A Glass Darkly (1872; rpt. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1993), p. 264. 38 "Carmilla" ran from December 1871 to March 1872; Linton published "My Cousin James" in the April edition. Both were collected in the magazine's third volume. Meem is certain that Linton "knew 'Carmilla'... and probably also Lesbia Brandon (Swinburne's unfinished novel)" (pp. 547-48). 39 Anderson quotes many of the same passages from The Rebel of the Family to argue that Perdita is disgusted by Bell's advances; she does not pick up on the qual ifying phrases ("nearly scared," "but at the same time") that I find so telling. See Anderson, p. 165. Meem's article, like my own, foregrounds Bell's attractions; Meem also recognizes that the relationship between Carmilla and Le Fanu's pro 306</page><page sequence="25">tagonist may have provided Linton with a model for Bell and Perdita's uneasy con nection. However, although Meem refers on several occasions to Bell's vampiric and magnetic qualities, she does not consider why Linton might have found an occultist discourse so suggestive in this and other novels centering on women's erotic relationships. See Meem, pp. 547-52. 40 See, for example, Thompson, p. 6, and Penny Boumelha, "Women and the New Fiction 1880-1900," in Edwardian and Georgian Fiction, 1880-1914, ed. Harold Bloom (New York: Chelsea House Press, 1990), pp. 83-108, esp. 93-95. Boumelha conceives The Rebel of the Family as centrally a novel of compromise?as "a para ble of the woman's voluntary subjection of herself to a standard of womanliness which, though it is perceived as personally restrictive and unjust, nevertheless con stitutes her only means of survival" (p. 95). 41 The full passage binds feminism, lesbianism, and occultism yet closer: "[Perdita] felt as if about to be initiated into those hidden mysteries wherein the springs of human history are to be found?as if about to be admitted into a secret sect working beneath the surface of society . . ." (I, 65-66). 42 Boumelha notes that the "relation of feminism to lesbianism also appears in other contemporary novels, such as James's The Bostonians and George Moore's A Drama in Muslin (both 1886)" (p. 94). 43 Qtd. in Anderson, p. 11. Linton openly admitted that the Autobiography of Christopher Kirkland was the story of her own life: when Rhoda Broughton wrote to inquire "where fiction ended and reality began," Linton replied that a few of the characters were "partly true, partly evolved" but that most "are real perons" (qtd. in Layard, pp. 246, 247). Anderson views Linton's use of the male persona in her auto biography as less a screen than "a mirror, which reflected her deep unconscious feelings of maleness" (p. 13)?particularly her attraction to other women. As will become clear later in this article, I believe that Linton was genuinely concerned about her own exposure?and women's exposure generally?to the harsh realities of the public sphere; therefore I am less dismissive of Linton's account. I also find the term "screen" suggestive: the "screen" Linton uses (the persona Christopher) imposes a distance between her physical and psychological experiences that repro duces the distance she describes more generally between body and consciousness. 44 Linton's description of Adeline borrows too from the discourse and imagery of the s?ance, "an arena in which power was vampirically transferred between medium and spirit." According to Sian Macfie, '"They Suck Us Dry': A Study of Late Nineteenth-Century Projections of Vampiric Women," in Subjectivity and Literature from The Romantics to the Present Day, ed. Philip Shaw and Peter Stockwell (London: Pinter, 1991), p. 65, "The seance was . . . the discursive space in which the 'egos' of living and dead would disturbingly fuse." 45 Layard, pp. 41-45, Anderson, p. 32. Layard was deeply troubled by the pas sages. They must be interpreted as a schoolgirl crush, he argues, otherwise "wrong causations of necessity suggest themselves.. . . The incident must as far as possible be cleared of its unnatural atmosphere. It is sufficiently bizarre without any eccen tric additions" (p. 41). Van Thai euphemistically references Linton's desire for Adeline as "an emotional event" in his index (p. 243). 46 Anderson, p. 32. 307</page><page sequence="26">47 "She was emphatically a transcendentalist, and in a certain sense a pantheist. To her the things of the spirit?the unseen world of the souls that had once been men, and of the angels who had neither been born nor had died?spiritual experi ences and realizations, and the all-pervading presence of God, were more real than those things we call time and space.... She was also in a sense a metempsychosist, and believed that we had all known each other in another life" (The Autobiography of Christopher Kirkland, I, 196-97, 198). 48 For further discussion of Victorian agnostics' fascination with natural order, see Lightman, esp. pp. 153-56. Van Thai notes that Bentley originally advised Linton to call The Autobiography of Christopher Kirkland "Confessions of an Agnostic" (p. 143). For discussion of critics' anger over the text's agnosticism, see Van Thai, pp. 143-45. 49 This strategy is essentially the one Linton employed with relation to God; like other Victorian agnostics she "disembodied" divine agency, viewing it as an abstract and essentially unknowable force. 50 Linton herself had a number of adopted "daughters" over the course of her life. For discussion on her relationship with Beatrice Hertz Hartley, apparently the orig inal of Esther Ardour, see Anderson, pp. 156-63 and 225. 51 Charlotte Bront?, Shirley (1849; rpt. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1981), p. 5. 52 Eliza Lynn Linton, The Second Youth of Theodora Desanges (London: Hutchinson, 1900), pp. 1-2. Subsequent references will be cited parenthetically in the text. Linton is also drawing on the genre of contemporary adventure fiction popularized by writers such as H. Rider Haggard. In She, Ayesha asks Holly: "why . . . should not life be lengthened for a while?. . . There is naught that is wonderful about the matter, couldst thou but understand. Life is wonderful, ay, but that it should be a little lengthened is not wonderful. Nature hath her animating spirit as well as man, who is Nature's child, and he who can find that spirit, and let it breathe upon him, shall live with her life"; see Haggard, She (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1991), p. 102. Indeed, in many ways The Second Youth of Theodora Desanges presents an interesting reworking of Haggard's text from Ayesha's per spective; the men who fall foolishly at Theodora's feet are openly derided in Linton's text, and Ayesha's briefly sketched fantasies of political domination are explored in considerable detail. Space, unfortunately, does not permit a full analy sis of the relationship between the two texts here, although it is worth noting that Linton and Haggard were good friends. See Layard, pp. 195, 230, and 365-66. 53 Sally Ledger, "The New Woman and the Crisis of Victorianism," in Cultural Politics at the Fin De Si?cle, ed. Ledger and Scott McCracken (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), p. 24. 54 For further discussion, see Lightman, esp. pp. 166-68. 55 For a detailed investigation of theosophy and its uneasy relationship to mod ern science, see Oppenheim, ch. 5, pp. 159-97. 56 The name "Theodora" suggests "lover of God" while hinting too at the pro tagonist's relationship to theosophy. "Desanges" meanwhile connotes both angels ("des anges") and blood ("sang"), reflecting Theodora's strange fusion of virtue with violence, the angelic with the possibility of the demonic. 308</page><page sequence="27">57A. P. Sinnett, Nature's Mysteries and How Theosophy Illuminates Them (London: Theosophical Publishing Society, 1913), qtd. in Oppenheim, p. 161. 58 If the text's anger at rational science marks a comparatively new development in Linton's oeuvre, its approach to the ill-educated is familiar. Theodora avoids the superstitious lower classes, she tells us, because "they would not have understood it had they been told. . . . they would have shrunk from me in dread as something supernatural..." (p. 81). As Linton put it several decades previously in "The Fate of Madame Cabanel," they would "[take] all the unknown not as magnificent, but as diabolical" (p. 281). 59 For further discussion, see Oppenheim, esp. pp. 168-70. For discussion on the breakdown of agnostic idealism around the turn of the twentieth century, see Lightman, pp. 179-82. 60 Nina Auerbach has recognized the force of this two-way process in Dracula: "Stoker's Undead do not drain vitality; they bestow it," she remarks, pointing out that Lucy becomes more vital and sensual after Dracula's embrace; see her Our Vampires, Ourselves (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1995), p. 96. 61 In "Master and Slave: The Fantasy of Erotic Domination," in Powers of Desire: The Politics of Sexuality, ed. Ann Snitow et. al. (New York: Monthly Review, 1983), p. 285, Jessica Benjamin's account of sadistic pleasures reflects suggestively on this passage: "Violence is a way of expressing or asserting control over an other, of estab lishing one's own autonomy and negating the other person's-It makes the other an object but retains possession of her or him." 62 Sue-Ellen Case, "Tracking the Vampire," Differences, 3 (1991), 9. Sian Macfie has similarly argued (from a more historicist vantage-point) that "vam pirism came to be associatively linked [in 1890s literature and culture] with the notion of a moral contagion and especially with the 'contamination' of lesbianism" (p. 60). Of all modern critics, Meem has argued most strongly for Linton's signifi cance as one who helped foster "the rise of lesbian consciousness." Meem's article is persuasive in many ways; Meem believes that Linton was "certainly conscious" that many of her characters are lesbian, and I am inclined to agree. At the same time, when explaining the "deeply conflicted nature of Linton's writing about women," Meem returns to a reading of Linton as covert/repressed: "only by tortured indirection can Linton own her desire [for women]" (pp. 538, 559). By fore grounding Linton's engagement with the occult and with contemporary religious debates, I do not intend to detract from the author's involvement and interest in "the growing lesbian presence in England during the last third of the nineteenth century" (p. 538); I hope rather to show the ways in which that interest was expressed, the mechanisms by which it was explored and articulated in her work. 63 Gillian Beer, "Representing Women: Re-Presenting the Past," in The Feminist Reader: Essays in Gender and the Politics of Literary Criticism, ed. Catherine Belsey and Jane Moore (Hampshire: Macmillan Education, 1989), pp. 68-69. 64 Beer, p. 68. 65 Linton writing "to one who shall be nameless," qtd. in Layard, p. 336, 334. 66 Layard, p. 335. 67 Linton developed this theme on numerous occasions. To give just one exam ple, in an 1886 article on women's suffrage and political action she argued: "It can do no kind of good to Imperial politics, and it will do infinite harm to individuals. 309</page><page sequence="28">. . . the character and tendencies of the [female] sex all round will be influenced to harm and loss. It will immensely increase that discontent with their natural func tions and assigned offices, which, as has been said, is their most salient modern characteristic." Presently, she adds: "It can never be too often repeated?publicity of life and action never has produced a race of virtuous and estimable women"; see her "The Future Supremacy of Women," National Review, 8 (1886), 6, 7. 68 Layard, p. 177. 310</page></plain_text>
