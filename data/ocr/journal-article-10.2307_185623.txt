<plain_text><page sequence="1">CAUSES AND EFFECTS WALTER FALES 1. Causal Relationships and Time. It is the objective of this paper to point out that discussions about cause and effect, and particularly those which bear upon their temporal relationship, are often blurred by failure to make use of the time- honored distinction between transeunt and immanent (also called "extrinsic" and "intrinsic") causes. Transeunt causes are in evidence whenever we discern two systems, S1 and S2, spatially separated (at least in the beginning of the proc- ess), but locked in interaction. In this perspective, cotemporaneous changes can be asserted both of S1 and S2. S1 has an effect on S2, and vice versa. Both effects take place simultaneously but are, as a rule, of different nature. Whether we read the causal relationship from Si, as the cause, to the changes of S2, as the effect, or the other way, from S2 to Si, depends on nothing more objective than the momentary direction of our interest. Immanent causes get into focus when- ever we compare the internal conditions Ci and C2 which characterize a system So at two different moments ti and t2. If ti is ear]ier than t2, there is a sense in which we can say that Ci is a cause, and C2 its effect. In ordinary speech the causes to which we refer are mostly transeunt causes. The notion of immanent causes hardly appeals to common sense but is often preferred by philosophers, and particularly by scientists, because it is a step toward greater integration. There is a general tendency first to replace transeunt causes by immanent causes, then to substitute functional equations for the efficacy of immanent causes, or else to attribute this efficacy to a general scheme which, rather than lying in the individual cause, works behind the network of causal relationships. It is often asserted that a cause precedes its effect. Unfortunately, it is not always added that this statement holds of immanent causes only. Indeed, it is amazing to observe how often philosophers switch from transeunt to immanent causes, either inadvertently or, at least, showing little insight into the implica- tions of such shifting. The issue is particularly important when the possibility of deriving the order of time from causal relationships is under discussion. (4) It is hard to believe in this possibility for those who keep the distinction between transeunt and immanent causes in mind. Immanent causes depend on a previous understanding of the relation "later-than," rather than establishing it. Trans- eunt causes and effects do not tell us much about the nature of time because of their simultaneity and interchangeability which will be demonstrated in the following examples. Our approach will be far from being novel, but its conse- quences are all too often neglected. 2. Transeunt Causes. We put a spoon in a glass of hot tea, and the spoon gets hot. We say that the hot tea (S1) is the cause, and that the change of tempera- ture in the spoon (S2) is the effect. But there is no action without a reaction. The tea warms the spoon, and the spoon cools the tea, and both effects take place at the same time. The one effect is more noticeable than the other. But if we 67</page><page sequence="2">68 WALTER FALES were interested in cooling the tea, one way of doing it would be to put ten spoons in it. We would then say that the spoons cause the tea to cool off. Another analysis is possible. We may consider the cold-spoon-in-hot-tea situa- tion as one system (S0), and we may compare the uneven distribution of tempera- ture (C1) within this system, at the moment t1 when the spoon is put in the tea, to the even distribution of temperature (C2) as prevailing a few seconds after- wards. In this analysis the emphasis is on the time interval between cause and effect, and the relation of the latter is asymmetrical. Now in ordinary conversa- tion we often cross the lines and say that the condition of the tea at t1 is the cause of the condition of the spoon at t2, and again, that the condition of the spoon at t1 is the cause of the condition of the tea at t2. For many practical pur- poses this simplification will do, but it is incorrect. The causes of the changes in S2 lie in S2 as much as in Si, and as far as they lie in S1, they do not lie in S1 at moment ti, but in all of the consecutive conditions which characterize the changes of Si from t1 to t2. When we speak about transeunt causes and effects, our orientation is so strongly affected by our purposes that it is often hard to see how partial we are in calling the one of two interacting systems the cause and the other the effect. Apart from the direction of our interests there is nothing in nature which gives dominance to one of the interacting systems over the other. We usually select the system we wish to have under control and call it the effect. The other system (or set of systems) we call the cause (or set of causes), and we hope that this analysis will give us the clue to the control we desire to exert. Take this example: We lift a weight (S2) with a certain speed up to a certain height. Our effort (S1) is the cause, the lifting is the effect. We probably have a reason for bringing the weight into a different position. But suppose that we do the lifting as an exer- cise in order to reduce. Do we not, in this case, use the weight as a means which causes us to make the effort necessary for reducing? We need the weight because there is no real effort without real resistance. In this situation the weight becomes the cause and the effort becomes the effect. The simultaneity of cause and effect is no problem in the preceding example. But when we throw a stone, is it not evident that the cause, the swinging of the stone, precedes the effect, which is the projection of the stone? On second thought, it will be admitted that the immediate and necessary effect of the swinging is not the projection of the stone but the momentum it has when we let go. It could happen that the stone no sooner starts on its way through the air when it meets an obstacle. There is really a succession of two events which must be distinguished. The first event, the swinging of the stone, involves the interaction of two systems, the muscles of our arm (S1) and the inertia of the stone (S2), resulting, as far as the stone is concerned, in its accelerated motion. The mo- mentum of this motion is proportional to the weight of the stone and to its speed. The stone provides the weight, we provide the speed. If the stone, being either too light or too heavy, is not "cooperative," it will be hard for us to give it considerable momentum. Effort of our muscles actualizes the potential energy which lies in the inertia of the stone, in a way which involves interdependence</page><page sequence="3">CAUSES AND EFFECTS 69 of two factors, and as a result the stone is brought into a condition which makes it ready to enter into a second event, the flying through the air (or whatever else may happen at this point). Before we consider this second event, a few words about the technique we just used. Any intervals which seem to occur between a transeunt cause and its effect will disappear when the event is broken down into a series of several events. For instance, when we pull the trigger of a gun, some six or more events, involv- ing the firing pin, the primer and other parts, follow one another in succession before the explosion of the charge drives the projectile out of the barrel. As long as the gun functions well, there is no practical reason why we should analyze the occurrence. But if anything goes wrong, we may have to consider each of its phases in its own rights. Every phase is a complete event in itself; it involves the interaction of two systems, and it lasts until it brings about a condition which releases the next interaction of two systems. Similar chain reactions are almost always discoverable when we loosely speak of causes and subsequent events. A detailed account of what actually happens will go far in dissolving any anthro- pomorphic illusions about causal relationships. Back to the stone. As it is projected through the air, the parabola it describes is the result of its momentum in interaction with the law of gravitation (leaving minor factors aside). We would, in this case, not be tempted to say that mo- mentum and gravitation are two systems, spatially different, related to each other as cause and effect. Rather we will say that there is only one system, the stone (SO), subject to the forces of its momentum and its gravity, and changing its location accordingly from moment to moment. Hence, this is an example which lends itself to an analysis into immanent causes and effects. Two more illustrations of transeunt causes. What about splitting wood with an ax? What has been said about the swinging of the stone applies to the swing- ing of the ax and takes care of the problem of simultaneity. But the interchange- ability of cause and effect, from the moment on when the ax touches the wood, may not be clear at once. Normally we consider the cutting edge (S1) as the cause and the cleaving wood (S2) as the effect. We probably need logs for our fireplace. But imagine this situation: Somebody swings the ax in order to kill you, and in defense you grasp a log and hold it in front of you. You are interested in absorbing the momentum of the ax before it harms you, and you use the wood as a means by which to bring about the desired effect on the ax. Indeed, the wood spends as much energy in bracing the ax, as the ax does in splitting the wood. The situation, admittedly, is unusual, but readers of philosophical papers are trained to doing.embarrassed colleagues the favor of straining their imagination when they struggle hard to bring home their point. Finally, let us consider the poisoning of a rat. It will be said that the rat must eat the poison before it dies, and that the effect is on the rat and not on the poison. Both the simultaneity and the interchangeability of cause and effect will once more be challenged. However, the act of poisoning does not take place until the poison, through the bloodstream (or whatever the case may be) has reached the organs where chemical interactions, working both ways, will occur, and if by</page><page sequence="4">70 WALTER FALES dying we mean the last heartbeat, we must not only consider what the poison does to the damaged organs but also what the latter do to the functions of the whole organism. In laboratories rats are often used for biological tests from which to learn something about the nature of certain substances. In such cases, the killing of the rat is incidental. We are, sometimes, not interested in what the substance does to the rat but in what the organism of the rat does to the sub- stance. The relationship of cause and effect can be read both ways, as in previous cases. 3. Immanent Causes. Let us now turn to immanent causes. It is evident that all causes whatever are immanent causes as seen in their relation to the universe as a whole (if, and as far as, there is sense in speaking of a universe). Moreover within the system of the universe there can be set apart any number of smaller systems which, while not impervious to external disturbances, may, within the compass of our specified interests, be considered as relatively closed and self- sustaining. Never stable, they carry the conditions of their changes in them. We have already referred to the cold-spoon-in-hot-tea situation as to a closed sys- tem. In a similar way, any interaction between two systems may be interpreted as internal processes of only one system. All descriptions which refer to transeunt causes can be translated into descriptions involving immanent causes. If the reverse were true also, if all descriptions in terms of immanent causes could be restated in terms of transeunt causes, Samuel Alexander would be right in say- ing: "The distinction (between transeunt and immanent causality) is clearly a relative one, and merely a matter of convenience in description." (1) However, the example of the projected stone has shown that field theories seem to require the language of immanent causes. The language of transeunt causes seems pos- sible only if physical processes are reducible to collisions of discrete particles. And yet, the question is still open, and recent developments in quantum me- chanics indicate the possibility of a surprising turn. When we see a distant star, it seems evident that the star, by emitting a series of photons, does something to certain electrons in our eye, whereas the eye does nothing to the star. But the differential equations by which our physicists express this event do not imply this interpretation. Einstein says that there is no lapse of time between the emission and the absorption of a photon from the standpoint of an observer (if there could be one) who travels with the photon. Of course, for us as ordinary observers the point-event is stretched out in time, and so are the causal relation- ships which occur in the collision between the photon and the electron. But the reciprocity of those relationships can perhaps be preserved as indeed it is in the theory of J. A. Wheeler and R. P. Feynman. According to this theory there is an interaction between the emitter (the star) and the absorber (the electron in the eye). Both send out advanced fields wvhich travel backward in time, and retarded fields which travel forward in time. The emission of the photon is actually caused by the advanced fields which emanate from the ab- sorber. (2) There are two systems in interaction, and whatever we have said about transeunt causes and effects in interacting systems applies to this case. If the theory can be confirmed, it will add to the probability of the thesis that</page><page sequence="5">CAUSES AND EFFECTS 71 the choice between transeunt and immanent causes is a matter of perspective. Also the idea of transeunt causes which travel backward in time will serve as a warning not to misunderstand the implications of differential equations in their reference to the direction of time. If the theory of Wheeler and Feynman turns out to be wrong, it is nevertheless reasonable to expect that the "traveling" of photons and electrons will ultimately be understood in terms of chain reactions between interacting systems. It might be added at this point that the idea of causes which seem to travel backward in time is no longer shocking to logicians. If it has been established that the occurrence of Si is a sufficient cause for the occurrence of S2, then there is a sense in which it may be said that the non-occurrence of S2 is a "sufficient cause" for the non-occurrence of S1. Accordingly, in the calculus of causal propo- sitions, as set up by Arthur W. Burks, the following is recognized as a theorem: " 'p causes q' implies that 'non-q causes non-p' ". (3) The time-factor is irrelevant. In ordinary language the anthropomorphic conno- tations which inevitably accompany the word "cause" are prohibitive of per- mitting the usage which Burks suggests. But from the standpoint of a scientist or logician there is nothing paradoxical or objectionable about it. If we look more deeply into the nature of immanent causes we shall discover a rather odd state of affairs. It is the function of immanent causes to explain the changes of a system. Now, -as we keep observing a system which perceptibly changes before our eyes we will be interested in the lawfulness of such change, but we will hardly be tempted to call some of the perceived occurrences causes, and others, which follow, effects. The articulation of causes and effects would easily be felt as an inorganic element in our intuitive grasp of a process which involves only one system; we do not call a child the cause of the man who de- velops from the childi If, however, we observe a system at a given time and later return to it and see the changes, we are apt to say that the system, as first ob- served, had in it the conditions which account for the changes. Our conception of causes and effects is greatly facilitated, if not, in fact, made possible by our skipping some of the iiitermediary stages which temporally lie between the one and the other. As we make our long-range provisions and understand nature in a broad way, it is convenient to summarize, or to short-circuit, those phases of on-going change which, from the standpoint of our momentary interest, seem trivial, and to bridge the distance by the assumption of cause-effect relation- ships. But what minute, painstaking analysis reveals is situations which, at any given moment, have a tendency to pass into new conditions. There is some- thing violent about considering the past as the cause and the future as the effect; there is often something arbitrary about selecting two moments of the time continuum and saying that the earlier moment is the cause and the latter mo- ment the effect. As long as there is that interval between the two moments the cause can only be an indirect cause. It will become a more direct cause when the interval is shortened. Unfortunately, as the interval approaches zero, the cause which could then be called an immediate cause vanishes. Mutatis mutan-</page><page sequence="6">72 WALTER FALES dis, the same consideration holds of transeunt causes when the chain of inter- actions between two systems is broken down to infinitesimal links. This is one of the paradoxes we have to put up with if we accept causes as legitimate imple- ments of our scientific equipment. Science has sometimes been defined as the systematic discovery of causes. The fact is, however, that science does away with causes. Russell and others have noticed how sparingly the term "cause" occurs in scientific books, even if we go back way beyond Mach. Take Newton as an example. In his Principia Mathematica he speaks of forces and powers which pull, resist, retain, drain off, and he does not seem to mind the residue of animistic beliefs which live on in such terms. But there are only two significant passages which have reference to causes. The first two rules of the third book warn us not to admit more causes than necessary for the explanation of natural things, and at the end of the book Newton says that he has not discovered the cause behind the power of gravita- tion. He expresses his aversion to hypotheses which are beyond the control of observation and experiment, and he intimates that the search for causes might be a metaphysical adventure. According to Newton, God is the Cause. He causes the force of gravity, or any other force we observe in nature, to function the way they do. But there is no scientific answer to the question (if it is an admit- table one): What causes a cause to cause? It was this metaphysical aura enveloping the term "cause" which made Hume skeptical against it. From the standpoint of this paper, it may be suggested that Hume's argument would have carried even further if he had linked causes to human interests rather than to habits of thinking. Kant was more definite in claiming the human mind, rather than nature, as the locus from which causes originate. But he went too far in elevating causality to the rank of a category without which rational thinking can not do. It is not the purpose of this paper to discredit the concept of causality if causality means nothing more than lawfulness. If, however, it means cause- effect relationships, the point has been made that the observer of nature, in using the terms "cause" and "effect" brings himself into the picture. 4. Causal Relationships on Higher Levels. Has the point really been made? The reader will have observed that most of our illustrations were taken from the realm of the physicist. The reason for this is simple. When tested on higher levels, and particularly in the field of inter-level relationships, a great deal of what has been said is no longer applicable. Let us illustrate. A famine which is a physical condition may cause a revolution which is a sociological event. It is certainly not the case that the famine, while acting as a cause, suffers a reaction and that the cause-effect relationship can be read both ways. The heterogeneity of our Si, the famine, and our S2, the revolution, frustrates analyses of the kind we have been able to carry through on the physical level. How can we account for this difficulty? Private experiences make it very plausible to us that an empty stomach causes restlessness and that restlessness fosters revolutionary tendencies. But when we try to account scientifically for the transitions from food shortage to hunger,</page><page sequence="7">CAUSES AND EFFECTS 73 from hunger to restlessness, from restlessness to a revolutionary spirit, and from the latter to action, we end up with nothing better than statistical evidence and transformation laws which leave a great deal unexplained. We can not fully demonstrate how processes which take place on one level can have heterogeneous effects on another level. More specifically, our theory breaks down when causes become motives. A cause becomes a motive in a being which (as a result of over-determination? but then, what is "overdetermination"?) is capable of arresting the efficacy of causes. B-ings of this kind develop an awareness of free will and of self. They add to the province of physical lawfulness novel features, processes which run parallel to one another rather than being immediately connected. Cause and effect are torn apart as if a cause could be neutralized or as if it could do its work over a distance, making it impossible for the effect to strike back. In the face of this predicament we must qualify our previous statement that science does away with causes. The fact is that science proceeds in two or three steps. The first step is that of finding the causes which account for certain effects. If those causes are transeunt causes, the second step may be the transition to immanent causes. The ultimate step is that of breaking down the intermediary stages between a cause and its effect until the cause-effect aspect gives way to a system of interactions. In physics and chemistry we hardly claim a full under- standing of a process until the last step has been completed. In psychology, sociology, history we must, as a rule, be contented with the first or second step. Most scholars who work in those fields find it methodically desirable to get as close as possible to the approach of the physicist. Take the psychologist Kurt Le-win as a representative example. He forms psychological concepts which allow for mathematical treatment if their "dimensions" are kept in mind. He introduces a field theory and establishes his fields as closed systems whose changes can be predicted through a vector analysis of their internal conditions. He eliminates the history of those systems and considers them as they are at a given moment, having absorbed their past. It is evident that in doing so he wants to get away from transeunt causes, first substituting immanent causes and then working toward a series of interactions. The finesse of this method excels anything ever done in a similar vein in the philosophy of history. But whatever the results achieved so far in the one or other field, complete success would depend upon a reduction of the different levels which is not yet in sight, if possible. 5. Conclusions. The following conclusions may be drawn: 1) On levels which allow for fairly exact measurements and predictions we have little use for the terms "cause" and "effect." But when we use them, we should be aware of the distinction between transeunt and immanent causes. 2) This distinction is particularly relevant when the relations between causal- ity and temporality are discussed. 3) When we speak of causes and effects on levels which involve motivation of living beings, the very necessity of our referring to causes and effects indicates that the processes we are talking about are not fully understood.
