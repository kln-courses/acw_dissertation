Does astronomical and geographical information of Plutarch’s De Facie describe a trip beyond the North Atlantic Ocean? Journal of Coastal Research, 34(3), 651–674. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. In Plutarch’s book On the Apparent Face in the Orb of the Moon, the interlocutors develop a dialogue about a trip to the ‘‘great continent’’ beyond the North Atlantic Ocean. By applying modern scientific data, the present reappraisal of the astronomical and geographical elements within this dialogue has produced a novel interpretation of the date and place of the meeting and a journey to the northern Atlantic Ocean. A described solar eclipse is dated to AD 75, making use of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)/Espenak/Meeus list, as well as historical information. The described peculiar, recurrent trips take place every 30 years (when the planet Saturn reaches the Taurus constellation) from the Mediterranean Sea to the Cronian Open Sea, which is identified with northern Atlantic Ocean coasts. It has been suggested that the last mission had returned homeland in April AD 56. The information provided concerns, distances between coastal sites and islands, duration of sea paths in days, and the reported setting and size between the destination place and its gulf with regards to Azov (in Crimea) and the Caspian Sea. Implications of sea currents and the coastal geomorphology of those lands are given. Following strictly the Gulf Stream current, as well as other known sea currents in the northern Atlantic Ocean, and introducing estimated speed for the ship, the geographical location of destination of the Greek settlers is proposedly identified with St. Lawrence Gulf and Newfoundland island. Other unnamed islands mentioned in this dialogue are identified with Norway’s islands, Azores, Iceland, Greenland, and Baffin islands. It has been shown that the journey is made with good knowledge of sea currents but by using bright stars and stellar configurations as astronomical nightscape markers that determine the exact orientation of the sailing toward the Iberian Peninsula and back to the eastern Mediterranean, making the current working hypothesis a plausible event.

In On the Apparent Face in the Orb of the Moon (Plutarch, At the end of the dialogue, the participants were invited to 1960), some close relatives of Plutarch discuss issues concerning listen to Sulla regarding a narration of an unnamed stranger, the Moon while walking. Also, a dialogue about a trip to the whom he met in Carthage, describing a mysterious journey to ‘‘great continent’’ beyond the North Atlantic Ocean has taken place after the six interlocutors have finished their walk and are the Isle of Cronus and an eschatological myth that the stranger sitting on pedestals (Plutarch, 1960, 937 D 2).

The ‘‘sun of the midnight’’ obviously refers to the longer daylight during summer solstice in the arctic region (Figure 11). The geographical zones where the sun sets at about 1 hour in the summer solstice (of 21–22 June) for AD 100 (NASA, 2017) was confirmed (Solar Topo, 2017). This zone covers the region of archipelago Vega off the Norwegian coasts, which contains 6500 islands, the larger being Vega (Figures 12 and 13). In particular, in the northern part of this zone lies the town Eiden of Vega Island at longitude 65831041.60 00 N and longitude 11850036.69 00 E.

In particular, Pytheas Massiliensis (fourth century BC) was a Greek geographer, astronomer, and explorer from the Greek colony of Massalia. He was the first Greek to visit and to describe the British Isles and the Atlantic coast of Europe. Though his principal work, On the Ocean, is lost, something is known of his ventures through the Greek historian Polybius (c. 200–c. 118 BC) (Encyclopædia Britannica, 2017). The descriptions of such trips beyond Gibraltar may seem extraordinary, but as Sarton (1993) quotes, Pytheas’s fate was comparable to that of Marco Polo in later times; some of the things that they told were so extraordinary, so contrary to common experience, that wise Figure 17. The going and returning sea route of the colonists in the Atlantic Ocean starting from the shores of Norway, reaching Newfoundland Island, and prudent men could not believe them and concluded that the and then crossing again the Atlantic Ocean, reaching Gibraltar. descriptions were fables. First millennium BC trips in the sense of sailing around have been reported by ancient Greek sources. For example, the (Lipke, 2012, p. 14–15; Morrison et al., 2000, p. 263–264; Lipke, periplus is a manuscript document that lists the ports and 1992; Shaw, 1993, p. 40; Taylor, 2012, p. 52; Tilley, 2012, p. 196). coastal landmarks (in order and with approximate intervening Estimates may also be inferred from two historical sources. distances) that the captain of a vessel could expect to find along One is by Xenophon (Anabasis 6.4.2), who mentions a long a shore (Kish, 1978).

In that sense, the periplus was a type of however, if the long day were interpreted as closer to 24 hours, log. The form of the periplus is at least as old as the earliest the speed estimate would be lower. The most frequently quoted Greek historian, the Ionian Hecataeus of Miletus c. 550 BC–c. account (Cotterell and Kamminga, 1992, p. 257; Pain, 2007) is 476 BC (Herodotus, 1932, VI.137). The works of Herodotus and from Thucydides’ History of the Peloponnesian War (Crawley, Thucydides contain passages that appear to have been based 2004). It describes how during the Mytilene revolt of 427 BC, on peripli (Shahar, 2004). two triremes were dispatched from Athens to Mytilene, a Regarding the accuracies of estimated velocities in the distance of 345 km (185 nautical miles), on successive days.

Experimental trials on a Trireme evaluate maximum stopping, taking turns sleeping, and encouraged by incentives and sustained speed of 14 knots (25 km/h) and 7.5 knots (14 km/ offered by Mytilenian representatives on board (Crawley, 2004, h), respectively (Cotterell and Kamminga, 1992, pp. 257–258). 3.49.3).

Returning to the possibility and capacity of crossing open seas along coasts and nearer lands, it is known that the crossing of the north Atlantic has been made by Vikings much later ca.

His aim was to view, but naive rejection and negation of any workable and delight and edify the reader, and he did not conceal his own elaborate treatment remain an option but overwhelmingly sympathies, which were especially evident in his warm admiration for the words and deeds of Spartan kings and most theoretically unfounded and naturally speculative. generals.
