<plain_text><page sequence="1">K. G. DENBIGH AND M. L. G. REDHEAD GIBBS' PARADOX AND NON-UNIFORM CONVERGENCE It is only when mixing two or more pure substances along a reversible path that the entropy of the mixing can be made physically manifest. It is not, in this case, a mere mathematical artifact. This mixing requires a process of successive stages. In any finite number of stages, the external manifestation of the entropy change, as a definite and measurable quantity of heat, is a fully continuous function of the relevant variables. It is only at an infinite and unattainable limit that a non-uniform convergence occurs. And this occurs when considered in terms of the number of stages together with a 'distinguishability parameter' appropriate to the particular device which is used to achieve reversibility. These considerations, which are of technological interest to chemical engi neers, resolve a paradox derived in chemical theory called Gibbs' Paradox. INTRODUCTION The object of the present paper is to show how questions of techno logical interest to chemical engineers, as for example the conditions under which a fractionating column could be operated reversibly, and hence with maximum efficiency, can also be applied to resolve a famous conceptual problem in thermodynamics, namely Gibbs' Paradox. "It has always been believed", wrote Schr?dinger (1948), "that Gibbs' Paradox embodied profound thought". That this is so is borne out by the extensive discussion of the Paradox in the literature. As yet there is little real agreement on how it should be resolved. Let us briefly recall what the Paradox is - and also what it is not. Let there be &lt;A" substances which are capable of forming with each other a thermodynamically 'ideal' mixture, whether gaseous, liquid or solid. When these substances mix with each other, rapidly or slowly as the case may be, and eventually form a homogeneous phase, the thermody namic theory shows that the entropy, at constant temperature and pressure, must have increased by the amount ..v (1) A5mix= -R S nMxi 1=1 where R is the gas constant, n? is the number of moles of the /th substance and x? is its mole fraction in the mixture: Synthese 81: 283-313, 1989. ? 1989 Kluwer Academic Publishers. Printed in the Netherlands.</page><page sequence="2">284 K. G. DENBIGH AND M. L. G. REDHEAD x? = n?/2j n?. /=i Now (1) is clearly a step function in regard to the number of substances which are mixed; any reduction of K reduces the magnitude of AS. This point does not bring out what is most peculiar about the equation, however. Consider the simple case where only two substances are mixed and let there be one mole of each of them. Then (1) reduces to (2) ASmix = 2R\n2. It follows that the entropy of mixing has the same value, 2R In 2, how ever alike are the two substances, but suddenly collapses to zero when they are the same. It is the absence of any 'warning' of the impending catastrophe, as the substances are made more and more similar, which is the truly paradoxical feature. Equation (1) was derived by Gibbs (1876) by a purely thermodynamic argument, applicable to perfect gases. It was later realised that (1) is applicable to any ideal mixture, where Ideality' is most simply defined in terms of the chemical potential. A homogeneous mixture, whether gaseous, liquid or solid, is ideal if the chemical potential of each compo nent is given, over the whole range of composition, by (3) fJLi(T,p,Xi) = ix%T,p) + RTXnXi where 7and/? are the temperature and pressure of the system. (A gas, or a gaseous mixture, is 'perfect' if ?i* can be expressed as il*? = fjt](T) + RTlnp which allows the derivation of the gas law, pV ? nRT, and other characteristics.) The derivation of (1) from (3) is given in many of the textbooks on chemical thermodynamics (e.g., Denbigh, 1981). An alternative method of derivation, but limited to the special case of perfect gases, was used by Planck (1927). This depended on the supposed existence of membranes capable of transmitting one gas only. Unfortunately, this supposition becomes unrealistic in the very situation we are concerned with in the Paradox - i.e., when the substances are regarded as becom ing more and more similar in their properties. In spite of certain reser vations expressed by Guggenheim (1957, pp. 24, 41, 58), relating to the conditions under which the chemical potential is well-defined, we shall regard the derivation of (1) via (3) as valid. Furthermore, the essential correctness of equation (1) is supported</page><page sequence="3">gibbs' paradox 285 by the fact that it can be obtained for gaseous mixtures by independent statistical mechanical methods - e.g., from the Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac statistics so long as the temperature is not so low that the gases cease to be perfect. This point need not be pursued since we regard the Paradox as being a thermodynamic result and capable of being resolved by thermodynamic methods. Nevertheless it should be added that the statistical theory has led to some confusion - i.e., to the tendency, still evident in certain textbooks, to conflate Gibbs' Paradox with the use of the factor N\, as adopted in the classical statistical theory, in order to obtain an additive entropy for any single gas. Of course this is not the Paradox as originally enunciated by Gibbs, for the latter is about the entropy of mixtures. Apropos of the Paradox itself one is led to ask the following questions: (1) Is the calculated entropy increase some sort of mathematical artefact or does it correspond to physical reality? (2) If the latter is the case, how does it happen that two such very similar substances as, say, ortho-and para-hydrogen, which differ only in their nuclear spins, have just as great an entropy of mixing as, say, hydrogen and carbon dioxide which differ greatly? (3) Why does the Paradox occur with entropy (and the closely related free energy) but not with other physical properties? The extensive literature1 has attempted to provide answers to questions (1) and (2) but has given rather little attention to (3), although we believe this to contain the nub of the matter. Typically it has been said (e.g., Mandl 1974) that the identity of a substance with itself is not something which can be approached gradu ally; either self-identity holds or it does not, and this, the adherents of this view claim, is the source of the discontinuity. This answer seems to us unsatisfying in so far as it does not explain why there is not at least a diminution of the entropy of mixing as the substances in question are made more similar. Closely related to this 'resolution' is the sugges tion (Grad 1961; Hobson 1971) that the Paradox arises simply because there is a discontinuous change in the state of human knowledge - i.e., concerning the number ^of substances which are mixed. Against this subjective view of the matter we shall point out that the entropy of mixing can be made physically manifest, under certain circumstances,</page><page sequence="4">286 K. G. DENBIGH AND M. L. G. REDHEAD as a measurable quantity of heat, or of mechanical work, and, as such, is fully objective. (The fact that tabulated values of Third Law entropies may be changed when it becomes known that previously unsuspected factors, such as nuclear spins, are present is no more an indication of subjectivity than would be a change of the declared values of other physical properties when more knowledge becomes available. It signi fies only that an error has been corrected, for it is always important to distinguish between the objective reality of some physical property, on the one hand, and the numerical value attributed to that property on the other.)2 Another 'resolution' to be found in the literature (Kubor 1965; Reif 1965) turns on the point that two substances cannot, in fact, be made only infinitesimally different because their constituent particles differ from each other by finite amounts of rest-mass, charge, and spin. But again, as above, this view of the matter does not explain why S does not diminish as the catastrophe is approached. In our opinion the best clue was provided by Gibbs himself (1876). Anticipating the outlook of the American pragmatists, he remarked that the issue concerns separability: when two samples of a gas are "of the same kind", he said, we are dealing with a situation where "the separation of the gases is entirely impossible". A mixture can, in fact, be shown to be a mixture only by separating its components, or by separating their manifestations. Similarly a substance can be said to be 'pure' only if it is found to be non-separable. These contentions are borne out by the history of the discovery of isotopes and provide the idea we shall follow up in the next section. But first about our third question - why the Paradox obtains with entropy but not with other properties of matter in bulk, such as volume, density, refractive index, etc. As has been said, this question has been largely overlooked, but it offers another important clue. It is arguable that all properties are, in a certain sense, dispositional. Any substance having a property implies a disposition to produce cer tain effects when the property is 'observed' (Popper 1959, pp. 424-25). But entropy is dispositional in a very special sense in thermodynamics. It becomes manifest only in terms of definite and measurable heat effects when a body changes its thermodynamic state along a reversible path. Apropos of equation (1) we wrote that the entropy 'must have increased' during the mixing. But this can only be demonstrated as a</page><page sequence="5">gibbs' paradox 287 physically real effect, and not just a theoretical mathematical artefact, by carrying out the mixing reversibly. This would be something very different from the kind of process occurring in a spontaneous mixing. Later on we shall enquire carefully how reversible mixing can be achieved, and this will lead us to question in what sense the entropy of mixing is a real effect. With the other properties of matter in bulk referred to above such reservations clearly do not apply. Another important introductory point is that mixing is a macroscopic phenomenon and, as such, should be capable of being discussed by use of purely thermodynamic arguments. Thus our general contention is that all three questions should be capable of being answered, and the Paradox resolved, through the resources of thermodynamics alone, and without reference to the atomic constitution of matter. This is what will be attempted below, but it may be said at this stage that we do not question either the correctness of equation (1), or the existence of a discontinuity in the theoretical value of AS1^. Our aims are rather to show: (a) as above, that the value of ASmix is not a direct 'observable' of the system, and (b) that what can, in fact, be observed and made manifest displays no discontinuity except at an infinite limit. 2. A DEMONSTRATION OF CONTINUITY In this section we put forward our proposal for the resolution of the Paradox. This will be followed in Section 3 by a concrete illustration which demonstrates the non-uniform convergence referred to in the title. For these purposes we need a postulate to the following effect: it is impossible to carry out a complete and reversible separation of a homogeneous mixture in a single stage. Nor indeed in any finite number of stages, as follows by applying the postulate to each successive in completely separated mixture. This postulate is in accordance with practical experience in chemistry where it is familiar that the attainment of, say, an appreciable enrich ment of isotopes, even when the requirement of reversibility is not imposed, requires a vast number of successive stages. Its justification on thermodynamic grounds is perhaps most perspicuous in the case of separations and accordingly we shall turn to mixings a little later. But first a few preliminary remarks are needed. By a complete separation we mean, of course, the obtaining of entirely</page><page sequence="6">288 K. G. DENBIGH AND M. L. G. REDHEAD pure components in amounts equal to the amounts which were present in the original mixture. By a staqe we mean any sub-process, within the complete separation process, during which the two partially separated portions of the original mixture continue to be in physical contact in such a way that transfer of components can occur. In principle this transfer can continue to take place until the two portions reach a state of equilibrium. One of the necessary conditions for equilibrium - and thus for reversibility of operation - is that for each transferable compo nent its chemical potential must differ not more than infinitesimally across the interface between the two portions. Separation requires the use of some device, which may be called a filter, capable of discriminating between the substances present in the mixture. Mention has already been made of Planck's use of the 'semi permeable membrane' which is supposed to be absolutely impermeable to all components of the mixture except one. Apart from this one component, the condition of equilibrium relating to the chemical poten tials is assumed to be suspended. That this is an idealization - and one which is also used in the theory of osmotic pressure - was clearly recognised by Planck. Indeed he denied the real existence of semi permeable membranes as a matter of principle (Planck 1927, pp. 210, 218, 238). This was on the ground that all types of molecules present in a system must be present, in finite numbers, in every part of that system. In particular they will be present within the body of the supposed 'semi-permeable' membrane, which will therefore allow for the transmission of those molecules, however slowly. Fortunately there exist certain methods of separation, and of mixing, where the condition of equality of chemical potentials at equilibrium can be applied to all components. This is important in the context of the Paradox since, as has been said, the paradoxical situation arises when the components are very similar, and where therefore Planck's idealization of separation by use of membranes would, by his own admission, become highly unrealistic. These alternative methods exist when the material in question can be present in the form of two distinct phases - e.g., as vapour and liquid, as a liquid and solid, or as two partially miscible liquids. Thermo dynamics allows that the two phases can be at equilibrium with each other whilst yet differing in composition. For example a liquid mixture of benzene and toluene in which the mole fraction of each component is 0.5 can be at equilibrium with a vapour phase in which the mole</page><page sequence="7">gibbs' paradox 289 fraction of benzene, which is the more volatile, is about 0.77 at 20?C. The vapour-liquid interface acts as a selective filter and this allows of the obtaining of fractions differing finitely in composition. But it does not allow of an entirely complete separation in a finite number of stages. That this is so in the case of an ideal mixture may be seen from the form of equation (3) where ?i,-?-^ as x,-h&gt;0. Since, as has been said, it is a necessary condition for reversibility that the chemical poten tials of any component differ only infinitesimally across an interface, equation (3) entails that, as any mole fraction approaches zero, so too must the degree of separation achieved in successive stages also ap proach zero. Thus the stages become more and more densely packed and the number of them required to attain complete separation becomes infinite. The same considerations apply to the reverse process of mixing when the requirement of reversibility is imposed. The mixing process, instead of being allowed to occur spontaneously, must then be controlled in such a way that the portions of fluid which are being mixed at any moment never depart more than infinitesimally from equilibrium with each other. Reversible mixings thus require the same sort of processes, acting in the reverse temporal sequence, as are used in separations, and similarly require an infinite number of stages if the mixing in question is that of initially entirely pure substances. (Indeed such a mixing can never get started, as follows from the foregoing remarks about the density of stages in the vicinity of X/ = 0!). It may also be noted that (4) ASmix=-ASsep between any two given states of the system. The postulate which has thus been advanced clearly puts an important limitation on reversible mixings or separations. It is something much more than a hypothesis for it has been shown to have a sound thermody namic basis, at least for that class of mixtures, namely the ideal mix tures, for which the entropy of mixing formula, equation (1), can be derived. Our proposal for resolving the Paradox will now have become appar ent. Equation (1) gives the entropy increase in a spontaneous irrevers ible mixing but, qua being irreversible, that entropy change is not physically manifest - i.e., as an observable and maximal amount of heat. Only reversible mixings or separations give rise to a definite</page><page sequence="8">290 K. G. DENBIGH AND M. L. G. REDHEAD external heat effect, but the attainment of reversibility requires an endless sequence of stages. Thus equation (1) is essentially the sum of those effects which can actually be observed and measured. In any fixed finite number of stages the external heat effect varies continuously with the degree of separation, or of mixing, which can be achieved reversi bly, and this is a function of the distinguishability of the components in relation to that property of theirs on which the particular process operates. In short there is complete continuity in regard to what is observable; the theoretical discontinuity would only become experimen tally manifest at the unattainable limit of an infinite number of stages. Let us substantiate this claim with an actual calculation. For purposes of simplicity we shall discuss the separation of an ideal mixture of only two substances, A and B, the mixture containing one mole of each of them. Suppose that after a sufficient number of stages (we do not specify at this point whether this number is finite or infinite), the material can be considered as existing as two fractions, a and ?, such that a is A-rich and ? is B-rich. Thus: Mixture of one mole of A and one mole of B [Fraction a : n% moles of A and n% moles of B [Fraction ? : n^ moles of A and n&amp; moles of B where the superscripts denote the fractions. From mass balance: (5) n% + n^ = V, H| + ni = l. It is not necessary to specify whether or not this partial separation has been achieved reversibly, because we are concerned for the moment only with the entropy changes within the system and these are fully determined by its initial and final states. These refer to constant temper ature and pressure. Also a and ? are taken as being in the same state of aggregation as was the original mixture. Furthermore, if either the a-fraction or the /3-fraction consists of sub-fractions, produced during the separation, these sub-fractions must be considered as having been mixed together, so that a and ? are homogeneous phases. Otherwise the following formulae would need to take on less simple forms. Let ASiep?) be the total entropy change of this partial separation of the original mixture. Let A5sep be the total entropy change in the infinite sequence of further separations required to complete the obtain</page><page sequence="9">GIBBS' PARADOX 291 ing of pure A and pure B. Having (hypothetically) obtained one mole each of these pure substances let them be allowed to mix spontaneously and irreversibly. This results in the recreation of the original mixture with entropy increase AS?S?"1, as given by equation (1). Since entropy is a function of state, it follows (as in equation (4)), that (6) ASi^ + AS'sep=-AS^. Now ASsep is equal, again because entropy is a function of state, to the negative of the sum AS^IX and A5&amp;ix where these two terms refer respectively to the entropies of spontaneous irreversible re-mixing of pure A and pure B to form the separate fractions a and ?. These terms are readily calculable from equation (1) and therefore it is useful to replace (6) by: It is to be understood, of course, that all of these terms refer to entropy changes undergone by the physico-chemical system in question, and not to any consequential entropy changes in the environment. The terms on the right hand side of (7) are readily worked out as: AS^ = 2R\n2 AS?ix = -R{n% In xA + ng In xg} ASL*= -R{n?A\nx?A + nglnxg}. Substituting these expressions in (7) we obtain the following for the desired entropy of partial separation: (8) ASi^?) = -2R In 2 - R{nA In xA + ng In x% + + nA\nxA + ng\nxg}. Consider two limiting cases of the circumstances which affect this expression: (a) No separation has been achieved so that the fractions a and ? have the same composition and xA = xA = \. The expression then gives ASs(^?) = 0, as was to be expected. (b) Almost complete separation has been achieved so that xA-+\ and xA-^&gt;0. Under these circumstances A5s("p?)-^ -2R In 2, as was also to be expected. Between these upper and lower bounds equation (8) shows that</page><page sequence="10">292 K. G. DENBIGH AND M. L. G. REDHEAD ASiep?) varies continuously according to the extent to which x% and xA differ - and this will depend on the degree of dissimilarity of the substances A and B in relation to the mode of operation of the 'filter'. For example it is relative volatility in the case of separation by distilla tion and it is relative diffusion rate in the case of passage through a membrane or barrier. And of course it will also depend on the number of stages required to achieve the partial separation. If it is now supposed that the foregoing separation - or the converse process of mixing - has been conducted under reversible conditions, it follows that its external manifestation, as an amount of heat, is also fully continuous when considered as a function of xA etc. (Under the same condition of reversibility the entropy change of the environment is, of course, equal in magnitude and opposite in sign to that given by equation (8).) Further simplification can be obtained by supposing that the process has been controlled in such a way that the fractions a and ? are equal in amount. It follows from equation (5) that nA = ni and n(A = nB Under these circumstances the number of variables on the right hand side of equation (8) can be reduced to one. A convenient choice for this variable is: (9) E=(n%- n%)/(n% + *?)=- (n% - ng)l(n?A + ??). E is evidently a measure of the amount of separation achieved. For example it is zero in the limiting case (a) above and it is unity at the other limit corresponding to the (unrealisable) case of complete separation. By substituting (9), together with the defining equations for the mole fractions, into (8) we obtain: (10) AS&lt;?*&gt; = -R{(\ + E) In (1 + E) + (1 - E) In (1 - ?)}. Thus E fully determines the value of the entropy of separation, or of mixing, and the entropy is a continuous function of E, for fixed amounts of the substances A and B. The 'catastrophe' only occurs in the case of an infinite number of stages, as will be shown in more detail in the next section. It is well-known that a similar effect obtains in the statis tical mechanics of phase change. Let Tis briefly summarise our argument so far. In order that the entropy change of equation (1) be made physically manifest the process must be carried out reversibly. This requires a process consisting of</page><page sequence="11">GIBBS' PARADOX 293 successive stages and in any finite number of them the entropy change is a continuous function of the relevant variables. In the next section we investigate how the variable E is related to the degree of similarity of the substances A and B, and the circum stances under which A5sep is a continuous function of that degree. At this point it should be added that an equation of a form similar to (10) was obtained by Lande (1955, 1965) for the case of a gas consisting of atoms of the same kind but differing in their momentary quantum states. Lande used a modification of Planck's derivation, as mentioned above, by assuming the existence of a device which transmits atoms in different states in amounts related to the 'fractional equality', P, of the states. The same equation was obtained by Klein (1959), on the basis of von Neumann's work (1955), and Land?'s parameter P was identified with the inner product of the wave functions of a pair of states. The Land?-Klein equation for the entropy of mixing, or of separation, of quantum states of atoms of the same species has thus quite a different significance from that of (10) above. 3. limiting behaviour: non-uniform convergence Below we give a concrete illustration in the form of a separation process by distillation at constant temperature. It will be shown how this can be conducted reversibly, thereby allowing the entropy change to become physically manifest, and it will also be shown how the discontinuity of Gibbs' Paradox makes a re-appearance at an appropriate infinite limit. Consider a binary liquid mixture of substances A and B and suppose this mixture to be ideal in the sense defined previously. Suppose also that the vapour phase in equilibrium with the liquid is a perfect gas mixture of the substances A and B. Under these circumstances Raoult's Law holds and the partial pressures, pA and pB, of A and B in the vapour phase are related to their mole fractions, x and (1 - x) respec tively, in the liquid phase by pA=p?x; Pb=Pb(?-x) where pZ and pg are the vapour pressures of pure A and B respectively at the constant temperature T. (We here neglect the normally very small variation of the vapour pressure with total pressure. See, for example, Denbigh 1981, footnote on p. 250). The total vapour pressure</page><page sequence="12">294 K. G. DENBIGH AND M. L. G. REDHEAD above the liquid phase is thus (11) p=p?x + p&amp;(l-x)=f(x). Let y and (1 - y) be the mole fractions of A and B respectively in the vapour phase. Then PA = yp\ PB = (l-y)p. Therefore (12) y/(l -y)= pA/pB = pXx/p?(l -x) = kxl(\ - x) where k=pX/pB- The total pressure as a function of y, instead of as a function of x, is then given by (13) p= *** g(y). y + k(\-y) The foregoing relationships are illustrated in Figure 1 where A is taken as the more volatile of the two components. Let us proceed to obtain for future use a relation connecting xn with y0, and a relation connecting yn with x0, where xn and yn are symmetrically disposed about the vertical centre line of the figure where x0 = 0.5 and y0 = 0.5. The horizontal tie lines such as DE, FG, etc. connect the liquid and vapour phases which are at equilibrium with each other, since it is a necessary condition of equilibrium that the two phases have equal pressure. Thus a vapour phase of composition y0 at point E is at equilibrium with a liquid of composition x{ at point D. Similarly a vapour at point G, having the same composition as the liquid at D, is at equilibrium with a liquid of composition x2 at point F. And so on. Using (12) we thus have: kxl/(l-xl)=y0/(l-y0) kx2l(\ - x2) = jci/(l - Xi) and therefore k2x2l(l-x2)=y{)l(l-y?). In general k"xn/(l-xn)=y0/(l-y0). This equation may be solved to give</page><page sequence="13">GIBBS PARADOX 295 x2 x0 = 0.5 ^, = 0.5 Mole fraction of substance A Fig. 1. Vapour pressure at 20?C of the approximately ideal mixture of benzene and toluene. The vapour pressures of the pure liquids are 74.7 and 22.3 mm Hg respectively. The curve p = g(y) has been drawn from equation (13) - i.e., as if the system obeyed Raoult's law exactly. The vapour pressure data is from Landolt-B?rnstein (1931), p. 1314. (14) xn = y0/[yo + k"(l-y())] (15) = 1/(1 + k") when y0 = 0.5. By similar reasoning (16) y? = k"x0/(l-x() + k"x{)) (17) = 1/(1 + k"")</page><page sequence="14">296 K. G. DENBIGH AND M. L. G. REDHEAD when Xo = 0.5. Comparing (15) and (17) it will be seen that (18) x?+y? = l. Notice that the foregoing equations, which are familiar in distillation theory, do not describe a reversible process. This is because the vertical lines, such as DG and KJ, do not connect phases which are in equili brium with each other. Nevertheless the equations are useful in so far as they connect points related to each other by the zig-zag in Figure 1. Let us proceed to inquire how a reversible distillation process can actually be carried out. Let us define the nth step in the separation process as a transition from two fractions of composition xn-i and yn-x to two fractions of composition xn and yn. Thus, after n steps, we have produced fractions denoted by an and ?n with compositions xn and yn, starting from an initial vapour of composition y0 = 1/2 (point E in Figure 1). If we start with two moles of vapour at E, then it is easy to show, using (18), that the fractions an and ?n each have one mole in total of A and B. We proceed to demonstrate how successive steps can be carried out reversibly, taking for illustration the case of the first step. Consider the part DEJH of the distillation process illustrated in Figure 1. We divide the pressure interval between y0 and yv on the vapour line into N equal divisions, where we will ultimately allow Af-^oo. We now relabel x() as xN+i =yi and y{ as yN+i as illustrated in Figure 2. The interval xY . . . xN+l is now divided into N divisions by the points x2 . . . xN and similarly the interval y{ . . . yN+i into N divisions by the points y2 . . . yN. The corresponding pressures are labelled p{ . . . pN+)L. The points on the liquid line with abscissae x{, x2 . . . xN+l are labelled Li . . . LN+i and the points on the vapour line with abscissae yu y2 . y/v+i are labelled V{ . . .VN+l. We now consider separate 'boxes' also labelled E{...LN+{ Vi . . . VN+i kept at the indicated pressures. So the vapour box Vr can contain vapour of composition yr and the liquid box Lr can contain liquid of composition xr. We now consider the following sequence of intermediate steps or 'sweeps' as we shall call them. We start with two moles of vapour of composition y{ (=1/2) at the pressure px in the box Vi. In order to achieve the first step of the separation process we proceed as follows: SWEEP 1. The vapour in Vi is raised in pressure to p2. The liquid</page><page sequence="15">GIBBS' PARADOX 297 =*= y ? Mole fraction of substance A Fig. 2. The portion DEJH of figure 1 on an enlarged scale and sub-divided into N equal pressure intervals. formed is collected in box L2, the remaining vapour is placed in V2. The vapour in V2 is now raised in pressure to p3, the liquid portion placed in L3, the vapour portion in V3. The process is continued until liquid is obtained in LN+l and vapour in VN+l. At this stage we are left with n^(L{) = n^(V{) = n^(V2) = n^l\V3) ... = n^(V?) = 0 and n(1)(L2), n(1&gt;(L3), . . .n(l\Ln+l), n^(Vn+l) all unequal to zero, where n(l)(Lr) is the number of moles in box Lr and n(i)(Vr) the number of moles in box Vr at the end of the first sweep. What we have done, in effect, is to sweep the vapour from V{ to VN+U but in the process depositing liquid in E2 . . . LN+l. All changes of pressure are made reversibly. SWEEP 2. We are now going to sweep along the liquid line so as to get as much of the contents of boxes L2 . . . LN+l into box L{ as we can, leaving L2 . . . LN+l empty, but in doing this we will get some vapour in boxes Vu V2. . . VN. Thus we begin with the liquid in L2 and lower the pressure to px. The vapour portion is placed in Vx and</page><page sequence="16">298 K. G. DENBIGH AND M. L. G. REDHEAD the liquid portion transferred to L[. Now we take the liquid in L3, lower the pressure to p2, and place the vapour portion in V2 and the liquid portion in L2. Now lower the pressure in L2 to p{ as before and transfer the vapour portion to V\ and the liquid portion to L2. Continu ing in this way we gradually sweep the contents of all the boxes L2. . .

The object is to get all the liquid into L{ and all the vapour into VN+l, which, by conservation of mass and starting, remember, with two moles of vapour of concentration yY = 1/2, requires, as we have stated, that we end up with one mole of liquid of composition x{ in E{ and one mole of vapour of composition Vyy+i in VN+i.

If q moles of vapour in box Vr has the pressure raised to pr+i then the number of moles of liquid contributed to L/ + 1 is (qlN)CL, and the number of moles of vapour transferred to Vr+l is q(l - CJN) where, in the limit of very large N, we can write the 'correction' function CL as CL (Ap,p) where/? =pr and Ap =pN+i -p\.

Similar considerations will show how the further steps, n = 2, 3 etc. in the separation process can be achieved in the limit of an infinite number of reversible stages. For example n = 2 corresponds to the completion of the part FGLK of Figure 1. We now want to compute AS^&gt;, the entropy change in affecting the first n steps in the separation. We cannot use the formula (10), directly, for two reasons: (1) The separation leaves us with one mole of liquid and one mole of vapour at each step, whereas (10) only applies when the separated fractions are in the same state of aggregation. (2) (10) assumes separation at constant pressure (as well as constant temperature) and this is clearly not the case with the variable pressure fractionation process we are considering. We proceed to derive the appropriate formula for A5^(A:), expressed now as a function of the distinguishability parameter k. For identical A and B it is certainly true that k=l, but it should be noted that k = 1 is not a sufficient condition for A and B to be identical in all respects. We shall return to this point later on. Consider the situation at the end of the nth step as illustrated in Figure 3. At the nth step of separation we are left with one mole of liquid at F and one mole of vapour at G (not related to letters on Figure 1). Project F, E, and G onto the horizontal line through /, i.e., representing the constant pressure pi. Let F', E', and G' be the projected points. Denote by S(x) the entropy of one mole at point x in the diagram relative to any arbitrary zero.

Further more, for k 3= 1, the physical range of the parameter we are interested in, the sequence converges for every value of k. The convergence is non-uniform,3 however, as we shall demonstrate by showing that lim ?S{"l{k) is not continuous at k = 1.

Furthermore, we do not assume LA = LB for k = 1. We are imagining a sequence of substances A, for example, becoming more and more like B in respect of vapour pressure, but not necessarily approximating B in other respects.

It is easy to show that the point of inflexion on the curve is at k = 1 + V2. The behaviour is somewhat more complicated than in the original version of the Paradox, due to the more complicated entropy formula involved, which allows for the effects of variable pressure and non uniform phase in the distillation process. In particular the fact that for</page><page sequence="24">306 K. G. DENBIGH AND M. L. G. REDHEAD k = 1 the entropy change is not zero but -(l/2r)(LA + LB) reflects the fact that the distillation process simply degenerates into liquefying one mole of the original two moles of vapour. It should be noticed that the fact that each step, as we have defined it, involves an infinite number of reversible stages does not introduce any additional complications of non-uniform convergence. We can always approximate the entropy change per step as closely as we like by a fixed finite number of reversible stages, if that fixed number is chosen sufficiently large (by 'fixed' we mean it does not depend on k). It may also be remarked that the non-uniform convergence really originates from the sequence {*?} as given by (15). For large n, k&gt;\ the sequence is approximated by the geometrical progression {(Ilk)'1}, which would arise from inserting the zig-zag in Figure 1 between the tangential approximations to the vertex at x = 0. Such a geometrical progression is of course not uniformly convergent in the neighbourhood of k=l. 4. CONCLUSION This completes our treatment of Gibbs' Paradox. Our two essential starting points were the special dispositional character of entropy and our postulate about the necessity of using an infinite number of succes sive stages if the entropy change is to be made physically manifest. We are not denying that important insights concerning the individual ity and distinguishability of atoms and molecules arise in the context of quantum statistical mechanics. This too throws light on Gibbs' Para dox when entropy is identified with some objective measure of the number of accessible quantum states. Our aim has been rather to show that the Paradox can be both formulated and resolved within the framework of classical thermodynamics. In conclusion we wish to express our indebtedness to Professor H. R. Post for the benefit of several very helpful discussions.

In the range Ap, the maximum value of CL occurs at one or other end-point of the range. The infinities at pi and pZ arise from omitting terms 0(1/N) in the Taylor expansion of the denominator of (A7), since the leading term clearly vanishes where the liquid and vapour lines intersect as they do at p=pi and p=pA.

Similarly Cv is illustrated for the first step in the benzene-toulene separation at 20?C in Figure 6. Just as for CL, the maximum value of Cv in the range Ap is attained at one or other of the end-points of this range. Finally Cmax = rnax (Cv, CL) in the range Ap, can easily be read off from the curves shown. Thus, for the example illustrated in Figure It may be noted that if we approximated the section EJ of the vapour line in Figure 1 by a straight line parallel to the liquid line, then Cv and CL would both be unity. The actual results we have exhibited are more complicated in so far as this condition is not met. NOTES The early part of this paper gives an improved version of a treatment of the Paradox due to K.
