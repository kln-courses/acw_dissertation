<plain_text><page sequence="1">298 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW he suddenly seems to notice that he is far from the Teubner number, and he corrects the position by giving a single line some such improbable connotation as Cas. 956-62. It does not, of course, matter very much, but it is a pity to see this high-handed treatment repeated in the present edition. Those who do not normally use Leo for the plays, but Lindsay or the small Teubner of Goetz and Schoell or the Bude of Ernout, will frequently find that the number in this book varies from that of their own texts. The second feature of Leo's presentation, and the only one where one might dare to question that great scholar's metrical judgement, is that, in spite of the accepted principle that there is regular coincidence of metrical form and content in Plautine verse, he has a sort of predilection for printing a monosyllable which naturally belongs later at the end of a line or colon. Lines where Q. has followed Leo in this practice are Cas. 955-62 (Q.; 956-62 Leo, 961-2 Lindsay, others), Pseud. 922 (921), 1255, 1320, Rud. 952 (952-3). And in still other cases he has gone further, advancing a monosyllable where Leo did not, e.g. Cas. 827, Epid. 166, Most. 875a (876). On the other hand, Cas. 212 (213) is presented in B as tace! MY. quid est? CL. em! MY. quis est? quem uides? CL. uir eccum it, with the exclamation 'st' (miswritten 'est') at the end of the previous line. A is not available here, but its presentation of the exactly similar Cas. 148-9 suggests that its colometry will have been the same as B's. This line looks very comfortable (with Schoell) as cr2 + ith, of which Q. finds eight examples in the cantica, and in that case 'st!' must be treated as extra metrum. Leo, who is followed by Q., produced a monstrous anapaestic tetrameter: CL. st, tdce! MY. quid est? CL. em! MY. quis est, quem uides? CL. uir, with eccum it starting the next line. (Q. notes below, 'de anapaestis non est cur dubites cf. Spengel Ref! 46 Jachmann Bern. 535'; but neither Spengel nor Jachmann supports these particular anapaests, and Spengel expressly excludes 'st!'.) Of course all these lines raise serious difficulties of scansion. But one wonders if Q. would have followed this expedient with monosyllables if it had not been for his respect for Leo. It was probably unavoidable that in such a complicated undertaking misprints occur from time to time, most of them easily correctable by the attentive reader. A defect in the description of Rud. 190 is repeated in the Metrorum conspectus at the end of the book. University College London M . M . WILLCOCK PROVOCATION W. FITZGERALD: Catullan Provocations: Lyric Poetry and the Drama of Position. (Classics and Contemporary Thought, 1.) Pp. ix + 310. Berkeley, Los Angeles, and London: University of California Press, 1995. ISBN: 0-520-20062-4. The title Catullan Provocations perfectly describes the project of this book. In his 'three layers of argument' (p. 1), F. attempts to refocus the kinds of questions usually brought to Catullus' poetry. In particular, he aims to resist the provocation offered by C.'s poetry to read in the ways which have informed most of the scholarship and much of the poetry and novelistic writing inspired by C.; that is, by reconstructing the author and building narratives around him. F.'s alternative approach is informed by a study of lyric poetry through the centuries (cf. his earlier book, Agonistic Poetry, on Pindar, Horace, Holderlin, and the English ode [California, 1987]) and an ? Oxford University Press, 1997</page><page sequence="2">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 299 awareness of the ideology of the Roman Republican elite combined with an openness to ideas from within and beyond classical scholarship. (It is perhaps no coincidence that F. teaches in a department of comparative literature.) The book is inspired (or provoked?) by Veyne's work on elegy (p. 7) and in sympathy with the ideas of Skinner, Richlin, Selden, and Janan; the freshness of its approach is epitomized in the apposite quotation and analysis of 'This is Just to Say' by William Carlos Williams (1985) on the opening and closing pages (pp. 2 and 239-40). The book, then, is a welcome antidote to presumptively scholarly approaches. Against that tendency, F. aims to rehabilitate C. in the role of the scurra (raconteur) alongside the poet canonized by the critics (p. 7). But above all he is concerned 'to shift the focus away from Catullus the individual altogether' and 'to describe the meeting of the lyric genre with Roman preoccupations and norms' (p. 236). This makes for exciting and provocative reading. The central focus of this book is 'aesthetic positionality' (p. 1). On the basis that the consumption of any artistic work 'involves a drama of position involving at least the producer and the consumer' (p. 4), F. develops Veyne's reintroduction of the audience of poetry (p. 8) into an exploration of 'the complex drama that is enabled by the way we relate through language as (real or potential) speakers' (p. 237) in C.'s lyric poetry. His attention to the Roman cultural context allows him to propose an alternative set of issues about the lyric form, where 'questions of performance, positionality, and power are more central than are those of subjectivity, authenticity, presence, voice, and anthropomorphism' (p. 5). Perhaps most exciting is the last chapter where the investments of modems, both scholars and writers of 'Catullan' poetry and novels, in C.'s canonicity are put under scrutiny, particularly the tendency among critics to understand 'Catullan provocation as an invitation to find higher reasons to take the poet's side' (p. 14; cf. 'the desire to endorse everything this poet says', p. 72). It is with this exciting final chapter that I start. The title of Chapter 9, 'Between Men', alluding to Eve Sedgwick's Between Men: English Literature and Male Homosocial Desire (New York, 1985), epitomizes much of the reaction by scholars and writers of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries to C.: it is a dialogue 'between men' which is covertly or overtly misogynistic. In modern readings and reactions to C., esp. the Lesbia poems, F. points out 'the dynamics of gender in the brotherhood of Catullus' readers' (p. 215, my emphasis) and the strange phenomenon whereby C. induces a 'confessional mode' (p. 212) in scholars, which embraces (and perhaps even legitimizes) 'alarming flights of misogyny' (p. 216) and, in the case of C. H. Sisson, Christian fellowship too (p. 230). Not that hostility towards Lesbia is confined to male critics. Benita Jaro's novel about C., The Key (1988), centred upon Poem 58, finds reconciliation between two men (Caelius and C.) through insult to Lesbia and female sexuality (not least through her stunning rendition of glubit as 'gluts her cunt') (see pp. 221-2). F. analyses how C. resists being pinned down by interpreters and by translators (p. 229), and in his Conclusion (pp. 236-40) argues that C.'s poems remain remote (pp. 239-40). There is no accident in F.'s choice of last words: 'the poems glisten, tempting and inaccessible'. Back to the beginning now. In Chapter 1, which initiates many central themes of the book, F. argues that the construction of the author C. by modern scholars is an attempt to control the disturbing 'promiscuous variety' of the poems (p. 19) by finding a centre of gravity for the collection (what F. calls 'a position within the Catullan collection', p. 16). This process (which often takes the form of construction of a narrative) F. sees as a parable of the interpreter's relation to the bewildering miscellany of the collection (p. 27). Against this approach, he argues that in their private world,</page><page sequence="3">300 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW away from the rigours of public life, Romans may have been more comfortable with 'chaotic variety' and less concerned with stability than modem scholars. Chapters 2-5 develop ideas about 'the positional drama activated by various kinds of Roman talk' (16). Thus F. finds a convergence of aesthetic and erotic terminology in which teasing can operate between poet and beloved and between poet and reader (Chapter 2, with discussion of Poems 3, 50, 1, 2, 15, 16, 5, and 7). Obscenity, especially in invective, raises many similar issues (Chapter 3, with discussion of Poems 21, 37, 74, 28, 80, 98, 58, 56, 97, 88, 33, and 23). Not to be missed is F.'s discussion of irrumation and his pause to examine scholarly invective (pp. 73-5 and see esp. n. 53 on Jocelyn on Richlin). In Chapter 4 (discussing Poems 86, 12, 13, 25, 43, 4, and 50 again), F. argues that urbanitas, the poetry of exclusion, is 'more like a game than a substance' (p. 113). In Chapter 5 F. suggests that C.'s misuse of the language of Roman aristocratic obligation in his elegiac Lesbia poems (inc. 109, 76, 75, 72, 85, 70, and 92) is emblematic of the poet's isolation and immobility. Chapters 6-8 confront potential weakness with the poet's strength. In Chapter 6 F. explores the paradox of Poem 64 constituted by the tension between secondariness or belatedness and the assertion of power which he appositely links with the ambivalence of Roman attitudes to Greek culture (humility and imperialism). The issue of gaze (of and at characters in the poem) is central here and F. introduces fruitful analogies from contemporary wall-painting and from cinema. What a shame that University of California Press did not include illustrations of the Boscotrecase panels discussed here (pp. 144ff.)! Chapter 7 explores another locus of tension: the three-way relationship (persona, woman, and another man) depicted in two rather different poems juxtaposed in the collection, 10 and 11. F. persuasively argues that failure by the persona emphasizes the transcendental position of the poet. Chapter 8 fittingly brings F.'s examination of C.'s poetry to a close by linking the poems on his brothers death (101 and 65-68) with issues of (poetic) communication and of C.'s cultural identity. F. is right to emphasize the complexities of a Transpadane writing Alexandrian poetry which at every turn displays its urbanitas, its Romanness. The subject of the book is matched by the quality of writing and production, although I did spot one wonderful typo: 'endlesslessly' (p. 233). This is a really refreshing book. By directing attention away from C. the individual and onto the poetry, F. focuses upon our reaction with the poetry and articulates C.'s provocations to consider what kind of practice poetry is.
