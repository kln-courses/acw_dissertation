<plain_text><page sequence="1">Life and Letters of Thomas Thellusson Carter, Warden of the House of Mercy, Clewer, etc. Edited by Ven. W. H. Hutchings, M.A. Longmans, Green &amp; Co., New York. By far the deepest and most endurable part of the Oxford Movement was the band of men who gave it birth and brought it up. What a superb old scholastic was Pusey ! What a surpas sing illustration of the hyper-ecclesiastical temperament was</page><page sequence="2">So? The Sewanee Review Newman ? What a serene and imperturbable poet was Keble ! And then the lesser luminaries, lesser in reputation, but often greater in works, Liddon and Bright and their contemporaries, and lastly he whose life and letters we have before us, T. T. Carter. Carter was born in 1808, and died in 1902, and his priesthood beginning in the same year as the Oxford Movement (1833), ex tended over three score years and ten, less one. Thus his labors coincided with that movement chronologically ; and more than chronologically, his efforts were spiritually and sympathetically devoted to the furthering of the so-called reawakening of Catho licity. It is self-evident, then, that the story of his career is of value to all interested in side-lights of that movement. We say side-lights, because his life was not in the midstream, but was devoted to organizing and supervising one of the many phases of church activity which it developed. To be explicit, his special ty was Penitential y work (which word is doubtless meaningless to many), and derivatively therefrom he became the Reviver of Sisterhoods in the English Church. From small beginnings in 1849, under his eminently sane and unselfish guidance, there grew a vast and valuable work, the proportions of which can be seen by the list of forty-seven diverse forms of charitable institutions given on pages 96-98. The Sisterhood of St. John the Baptist grew out of his house for penitents most naturally. Mr. Carter saw that "there are three ways of managing a body of penitents ? by the paid services of a matron and staff, by the oversight of ladies who gratutiously give their time and labors, and by sisters of mercy. Mr. Carter quickly saw . . . which was the best. We have had experience . . . and the two former failed, whilst the latter succeeded" (p. 84). And so evolved the sisterhood movement, which to-day makes itself felt in every part of England. This was his greatest achievement. In other la bors, too, he was abundant, though not, so far as Mr. Hutchings' book would persuade us, with equal facility or aptitude. For ex ample in the ninth chapter we are told that "his literacy activ ity .. . was most remarkable" (p. 280), and the writer in the next sentence admits that his style was involved and difficult ? a remark which is superfluous after the reader has already wept over the endless number of uninteresting letters which had</page><page sequence="3">Reviews 507 preceded Chapter Nine. He was hand in glove in all the lead ing (and following too) members of the ritualistic revival, and often we gain a valuable hint as to motives which underlay some of the doings of the chief actors. So much for his doings. As for what he was, according to this present life. He must have been much more of a man than the author, or editor as he styles himself, presents. Our candid opinion is that the book was written for the Sisters and Carter's personal friends, for it is brim full of things which are of no interest whatever to the average person ? for example that deliciously mediaeval medita tion "on Heaven" on pp. 135-138, with its apocalyptic parapher nalia and its anthropomorphic and "terrestomorphic" dilation, upon the ethereal Jerusalem. But we started to say somewhat of the man himself ? and have been wandering into things not ger mane. He was a great Christian, with great self-sacrificing zeal, who looked to the Lord for praise and not to man; and so it becomes us not to criticize him without adding words of reverent admira tion. The complete self-annihilation of the man, the penetration of his holy life makes us say with Arnold : Surely, somewhere, afar In the sounding labor-house vast Of being, is practised that strength Zealous, beneficent, firm. Truly the way in which we can apply the same epithets to antip odal persons is one of the most suggestive of all thoughts on the unfathomableness of Religion. Though Carter lacked scintilla tion, and though mediaeval in his imagination, we may be thank ful that he has lived. As to the biography qua biography we have already made it plain that it is not well done. It is hard to read, badly told, gives no connected vision of the life, and is altogether unworthy of T. T. Carter. Would that such a personality had been por trayed by one with a pen like Stopford Brooke or Morley ! Arthur R. Gray.</page></plain_text>
