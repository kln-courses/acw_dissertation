One of the newer advances in the progress of literary theory is, as I have heard, the ‘spatial turn’. is would seem to be a capacious topic, if one may say so, since spatial representation is a fundamental component of literature, especially of realist literature. For the purposes of his study of eodor Fontane’s prose works, Michael James White defines space as the world beyond the subject (p. ) and his procedure as asking ‘how space and literariness are linked, what the relationship between space and the literary text as a symbolic art form is, and how an analysis under the general heading of “space” leads to fresh insights into the individual text’ (pp. –). White distinguishes between focalization, the way space is perceived by characters or the narrator, and structure, the relationship of space to other images in the text. His painstaking readings and refined detail, accompanied throughout with arti- culate awareness of methodological considerations, cannot be summarized in this brief space; I will just touch upon some characteristic results. He begins with the first section of Die Wanderungen durch die Mark Brandenburg , ‘Die Grafscha Ruppin’, showing how the description of manor houses and interiors characterizes the Prussian military nobility as modest and unpretentious; ‘spatial representation serves a rhetorical purpose’ (p. ). e contrasting rooms at Crown Prince Fre- derick’s Rheinsberg retreat relate to contrasting elements in his character and their unification, while the subordinate place of Prince Henry is indicated by the layout of the building. In Vor dem Sturm spatial multiplicity reinforces the variety of atti- tudes towards the historical situation, the inner complexity of the characters, and the episodic rapidity of events. With Schach von Wuthenow and Graf Petöfy White turns to the spatial representation of awareness. e sequence of spaces illustrates Schach’s growing understanding of himself from a rather dim perceptivity to a more complex sense of complication and contradiction. e opposite is shown to be true of Graf Petöfy, where the spaces reflect Adam and Franziska’s dri into delusion. e symbolism of le and right corresponds to a contrast of the (French) west with the (Slavic) east. e de interpretation has the effect of elevating the aesthetic value of the sometimes slighted story. An aesthetic view of life is also implied in Irrungen Wirrungen and Unwie- derbringlich. One might think the former well suited to this enquiry with its significant spaces, such as Lene’s workplace, Hankels Ablage, or the cemetery, but White concentrates on the market garden and Botho’s ride to the cemetery. e issues concern subjectivity and imagination; Botho’s memories of the market garden ‘grant him access to values beyond those he encounters in his own life’ </page> <page sequence="2">  Reviews (p. ). Given the opportunities in the novel, this section strikes me as somewhat compressed. Unwiederbringlich exhibits contrasting landscapes in Germany and Denmark with similarities between them. Both Christine and Holk have proble- matic relationships to their surroundings; ‘the representation of space [. . .] clearly functions as a means of illustrating Holk’s psychology’ (p. ). White’s longest chapter is appropriately devoted to Fontane’s longest novel, Der Stechlin, which is built around a space. e interior spaces distinguish Stechlin and the Barbys from the other characters. Adelheid’s space, with its large furniture in a small room, indicates delusions of grandeur. e contemplative quiet and isolation of Stechlin are contrasted with the modern bustle of Berlin, but these spaces are not monolithic and contain layers of meaning. For example, the Stechlin manor house is a relatively new building, replacing an old castle. White rightly, I think, denies that the lake can be a symbol of revolution, but he has a little difficulty coping with its alleged responsiveness to current upheavals, and he several times stresses the choice of traditional continuity over the hectic modern as enacted by Woldemar’s move from Berlin to Stechlin. roughout the book there is much more that is illuminating and persuasive. Ultimately White is concerned not just with the analysis of spatiality but with claims of the ways spatial representation serves aesthetic effect and awareness. One question that can arise in contemporary literary study is whether the ab- struse theoretical superstructure is necessary to the results achieved. White actually adverts to the theoreticians of the ‘spatial turn’ rather sparingly. Instead, the meti- culously probing close readings, the pursuit of symbolism, sometimes a bit forced, the search for paradox and ambiguity, formulations such as ‘harmony, unity, multi- plicity, and paradox’ yielding ‘a timeless power’ (p. ), and the disclaimer of any ‘attempt to examine the text as a cultural artefact or as indicative of wider social practices’ (p. ) are reminiscent of the New Criticism of yore. Indeed, in White’s resources we encounter a number of very old friends: Cleanth Brooks, Brooks and Warren, I. A. Richards, René Wellek, Wellek and Warren, Wimsatt and Brooks. ere are also occasional allusions to the Russian formalism influential when I was a student. is seems to me somewhat unusual today, and while I think that it contributes to the strength of the interpretative achievement, one consideration troubles me a little. Congruent with the abstinence towards social and political context is White’s strong endorsement of Fontane’s principle of Verklärung , which he takes not as euphemistic avoidance of reality but as a kind of aesthetic surplus value, perceiving beauty in the real and raising realism to a poetic height and intensity, as though art could not be made out of distress and the awareness of injustice. e book is exceptionally well written, precise, compact, and lean. It has been well edited with very few faults. In one place a conflation of Karl Friedrich von dem Knesebeck with his great-grandfather might be confusing to the reader (p. ). Once in a while it might be more appropriate to render Schloß as ‘manor house’ rather than ‘castle’. e book appears to assume a prior familiarity with Fontane. It </page> <page sequence="3"> MLR, .,   is not exactly written for specialists, but it will be of most use to those who know Fontane’s texts well. However, there are many of these.

Aby Warburg (–), the art historian whose Kulturwissenschaliche Bib- liothek, founded in , later migrated to London as the Warburg Institute, is an important figure for the study of cultural memory. He was especially interested in how Pathosformeln, visual formulae expressing intense emotion, were adapted from their pagan origins during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. He increas- ingly saw art as helping to liberate humanity from primeval fears by transforming images, as when the ancient Saturnian demon is humanized as Dürer’sMelencolia, and as providing a symbolic dimension that saves us from confronting too directly the nakedly factual universe revealed by science. Memory, as E. H. Gombrich explains in Aby Warburg: An Intellectual Biography (nd edn (London: Phaidon, ), pp. –), thus has a dual role in preserving the mythic images into which early humanity projected their terrors while locating these images within our law-governed universe. But progress is not inevitable: the past holds out the lure of atavism, and primitive violence can always return. Christopher Johnson deals with an ambitious project in cultural memory which was unfinished at Warburg’s death. is was his Mnemosyne, consisting of sixty- three wooden boards to which Warburg attached photographs of images, in order to illustrate the changes undergone by images of the Greek gods and by ancient Pathosformeln. e panels no longer survive, but the  photographs that make up the third version of this Bilderatlas, as Warburg also called it, have been published in Volume /i of Warburg’sGesammelte Schrien, edited byMartinWarnke (Berlin: Akademie Verlag, ). ese juxtaposed images invite comparison with moder- nist montage and particularly with Walter Benjamin’s unfinished Passagen-Werk. Although Johnson’s dense, rich, oen digressive book defies summary, it is centrally concerned with Mnemosyne as a work of cultural memory based not on metonymy, like modernist montages, but on metaphor. Its implicit history of culture moves from primitive anthropomorphism to modern abstraction, but with no sense of triumphant progression, for Warburg deplored not only a relapse into primitive terror but also any advance into sterile abstraction. For him, metaphor served to create distance from experience and hence a Denkraum or intermediate space of reflection. He feared that in modern machine civilization such inventions as the telephone and the telegraph impoverished life by abolishing such distance. Warburg’s Denkräume recollect the past in the form of visual metaphors which preserve intense emotions with sensuous immediacy but also with reflective dis- tance. us the tragic scene in Dürer’s Death of Orpheus moves us without over- whelming us. Warburg identified his Pathosformeln with the ‘engrams’ or ‘mnemic </page> </plain_text>
