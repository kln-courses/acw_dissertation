<plain_text><page sequence="1">Gayana Jurkevich, Baruch College/City University of New York Archetypal Motifs of the Double in Unamuno's Abel Sanchez Throughout his lifetime Miguel de Una- muno was fascinated by doubling, self-duplica- tion, and fraternal rivalry. His notion that every man harbored within himself both Cain and Abel, or the active and the contemplative personalities, may be traced to the essays of En torno al casticismo (1895), in which a dual concept of history and national character was first introduced. Don Miguel frequently chose civil war as a metaphor to represent fraternal conflict, and in his first novel, Paz en laguerra (1897), he described the second Carlist War as a battle for economic supremacy between urban cainitas and rural abelitas, while the novel's two protagonists, Pachico Zabalbide and Ignacio Iturriondo, represented two highly different facets of the author's youthful personality. However, it is in the novel Abel Sdnchez (1917) and the play El otro (1926), where to the elementary problem of fraternal compet- ition, Unamuno adds the more complex dimen- sion of the problem of personality. In these works fraternal enmity metaphorizes the con- flict between the conscious ego and the uncon- scious contents of a rival shadow personality. 1 The battle between the light and dark sides of the human psyche, or as Unamuno was to call it, the problema de la personalidad, was of great personal interest to don Miguel, and it acquired an especially prominent place in the fiction he produced after the publication of Niebla (1914). This growing preoccupation with twins and personality splitting perhaps had its basis in the author's own inability to resolve his now famous internal dichotomies. Certainly the many works of literature in which Unamuno elects to study the effects of psychological dualism on the personality seems to reveal the author's attempt to fathom the dual tendencies of his own psyche. The coincidence of opposites Unamuno in- fers the human personality to be is nowhere expressed with such dramatic intensity as it is in Abel Sdnchez, a novel whose timeless qual- ities can possibly be attributed to the mytho- logical context in which the work evolves, and the familiar symbolism of its archetypal contents. That archetypal motifs appear fre- quently in the work of Unamuno should be of no surprise since as a Hellenist don Miguel had greater access than most to a wealth of mythological heritage still extant today in the Western canon. Abel Sanchez appears to rest on several layers of mythological tradition, each independently confirming Unamuno's as- sessment of the human personality as continu- ally susceptible to its innate divisiveness. This essay intends to examine three sources fre- quented by don Miguel: classical mythology, the Bible, and the Romantic view of the per- sonality, all of which seem to corroborate the novelist's psychologically oriented approach to the archetype of self-division. Otto Rank suggests that the idea of self- duplication was created as a defense mecha- nism against the threat of death, but the twin, or double, also appears in folklore as a re- minder of death's imminence (85-86).2 Twins have been regarded as anthropomorphic rep- resentations of personality cleavage, and as such have been the subject of superstition in the taboos of primitive cultures. The assump- tion that one twin was of divine origin while the other was of mortal descent is most likely modeled on the dual paternity of the Dioscuric gods, Castor and Pollux (Mauron 293).3 Throughout its history the shadow-image has aroused paranoid ideas of pursuit to which a common solution is eradication of the bother-</page><page sequence="2">346 HISPANIA 73 MAY 1990 some reflection (Rank 86). Unamuno's inter- est in doubling may well have been determined by the independent nature of his contempla- tive "other," constantly at odds with the ag- gressive public figure the novelist permitted to become his dominant self. In each of don Miguel's novels, plays or short stories that concerns personality duplication, one "twin" inevitably meets his or her death. This pattern is established in Paz en la guerra with the death of Ignacio Iturriondo, the first of many contemplative yo ex-futuros created, and an- nihilated, by don Miguel. In works such as Abel Sanchez and El otro, Unamuno divided between two fictional per- sonae what normally would be considered the complementary halves of one psyche. Only the elimination of one of the antagonists in- volved brings a temporary, if misleading solu- tion to the problem; misleading since the pur- sued often perishes within a short while of his pursuer. The conclusion Unamuno appears to draw from his fictional examination of dou- bling, is that the psyche functions completely only in the presence of a complement upon which it depends to provide its sought-for wholeness. While in literature competition between the ego and its rival shadow has had a long associ- ation with the metaphor of the hostile double, in psychology the same motif expresses the archetype of self-division (Neumann 95; Rank 12). It has been suggested that authors most attracted to this motif are also those most concerned with articulating "the universal theme of the Self's relation to itself' (Rank xiv), a topic which seems to have engaged Unamuno's curiosity with increasing fre- quency in the second half of his life. The double, or imagined pursuer, is habitu- ally portrayed as the protagonist's brother who personifies that part of the ego which becomes detached, and assumes an independ- ence threatening to the protagonist (Rank 20). Rank concludes that the double motif occurs most often in the work of those authors who themselves experienced male sibling rivalry (75). Considered in these terms, it can be argued that Unamuno's fascination with the theme of the hostile double may be explained first, as a reflection of his personal quest to forge a truce from among the plurality of his many selves, but more specifically, by the lack of empathy between himself and his younger brother Fdlix, who could never quite adjust to don Miguel's growing notoriety.4 The siblings Cosmas and Damian; Jacob and Esau; Abel and Cain have traditionally been paradigmatic of the split personality (Jacobi 40). Especially noteworthy is Unamu- no's use of these pairs in his work as meta- phorical expressions of psychological dualism. In the case of Abel Sdnchez, however, the Old Testament archetype of unlike brothers is only the tip of the mythological iceberg upon which the novel is constructed. In order to appre- ciate the palimpsest of mythological tradition upon which this novel rests, it is necessary to go beyond the familiar Cain and Abel story which appears as its first, and most recogniz- able layer. The double motif in its pristine state ap- pears to derive from the brothers Cosmas and Damian, two Persian physicians who suf- fered martyrdom for their conversion to Chris- tianity (Gull6n 166). Cosmas and Damian, the names Unamuno gave to the rival twins of his play El otro, are thought to be the Christian equivalents of the pagan, Dioscuric gods, Cas- tor and Pollux. A connection between the Dioscuri and Abel Sdnchez is further provided by the gods' sister, the infamous Helen of Troy. Married to Menelaus, she allowed her- self to be carried off by Paris, son of the King of Troy. This mythological abduction was in- strumental in causing, if not the oldest extant archetype of fraternal warfare, then certainly its most notorious and legendary exponent. It is therefore highly significant that Unamuno should have chosen the name "Helena" for the heroine of his modern adaptation of brotherly strife.5 The legendary triangle Paris-Helen-Menelaus is mirrored by the Unamunian triangle Abel-Helena-Joaquin, the latter-day Helen flanked by the hostile broth- ers Abel and Cain, each vying for her favors. As Abel studies the Bible for a new painting he plans to execute, Joaquin pointedly in- quires whether Helena could not also serve as a source of inspiration. Puzzled, as in the Biblical episode no woman plays a significant role, Abel queries: "CMi mujer? En esta tra- gedia no hubo mujer." Joaquin's reply that "en toda tragedia la hay, Abel" (2: 711), is most likely a reference to the similarity between the mythological war inspired by Helen of Troy between the Greeks and their Trojan kins- men, and the discord Helena has sown be- tween Abel and Joaquin, the "hermanos de crianza" of Unamuno's novel (2: 689).</page><page sequence="3">ARCHETYPAL MOTIFS OF THE DOUBLE IN UNAMUNO'S ABEL SANCHEZ 347 The Greek Helen displays a personality re- markably similar to Unamuno's beautiful and vain Helena who, like her predecessor, is as unaware as she is unconcerned by the pas- sions she stirs in men.6 The sphinx-like pava real that both Joaquin and Abel conclude her to be, is described by Unamuno as a quasi- divine being, "solemne y fria, henchida de desd6n, como una diosa ilevada por el destino" (2: 693). In point of fact, both the Homeric and Unamunian heroines seem to share a pas- sive acceptance of their destinies as profes- sional femmes fatales. It is quite likely that Unamuno had the Tro- jan Helen very much in mind when he drafted Abel Sdnchez. Contemporaneous with the novel is an essay, "Las coplas de Calainos" (May 21, 1917), in which Unamuno translates a passage of the Iliad that is reminiscent of his fictional heroine: "No hay que indignarse de que los troyanos y los aqueos de buenas perneras sufran tanto tiempo dolores por se- mejante mujer, par&amp;cese en su figura terrible- mente a las diosas inmortales" (3: 1008). Ho- mer's description of Helen of Troy resembles Unamuno's own of Helena as a god-like crea- ture whose portrait takes a provincial capital by storm, and who now strolls its avenues "como un inmortal viviente... No habia acaso nacido para eso?" (2: 695). In Abel Sanchez, however, the mythological brothers Castor and Pollux, are replaced by the more familiar, Old Testament rendition of the same archetype: the unlike brothers Abel and Cain. Fraternal enmity reappears as a Biblical theme in the New Testament dichot- omy Satan and Christ. Milton, whose epic poem plays an important role in Unamuno's novel, established this antagonistic, yet clearly dependent relationship in Satan's chal- lenge to Christ: "... in what degree or mean- ing thou art called / The Son of God, which bears no single sense; / The Son of God I also am or was / And if I was, I am; relation stands ..." (Paradise Regained 393). The same relationship between Christ and the Antichrist was also perceived by C. G. Jung for whom the pair symbolized a polarity of psychic characteristics in need of reconcilia- tion (9, ii: 81). It becomes evident, then, that Unamuno, in his reworking of the Cain and Abel legend, reproduces one of the most an- cient images contained in the collective uncon- scious of mankind. Don Miguel's Cain is a demonic and rebel- lious individual, while Abel, the Biblical tender of sheep, personifies innocence and the con- templative personality traits customarily as- sociated with the Lamb of God.7 The link be- tween Joaquin, Satan, and the sulfureous fumes of Hell is established when, in the first chapter of the novel, Abel insists that Joaquin curb his jealous anger by using the verb sul- furar on two occasions in the same confronta- tion (2: 695-96). This association is strength- ened at the end of the same chapter which concludes with an excerpt from Joaquin's diary in which he notes that "aquella noche naci al infierno de mi vida" (2: 607). From that moment on references to Joaquin's life as a living Hell, and to the demonic qualities of his personality, continue throughout the novel.' Rof Carballo, following Melanie Klein, sug- gests that the most envied of people are those who possess the gift of creativity. He pro- poses that Lucifer's crime was not that of pride as is commonly believed, but the envy of God's creative capabilities (4). It is quite possible that Unamuno may have inferred a similar connection between the envy which motivates Joaquin, and Monegro's resent- ment of Abel's artistic talent. Certainly Joa- quin's insistence throughout the diary that he, the medical doctor, is an "artista, un verda- dero poeta en su profesi6n, un clinico genial, creador, intuitivo" (2: 704), appears to con- firm the relationship Rof Carballo perceived between Satan's envy of God's creative power and the general, human tendency to envy those blessed with creative talent. The representation of Cain as Satan's ally reached its apogee in Romantic literary ico- nography which often portrayed both figures as unjustly doomed and excessively maligned creatures.9 The Romantics are also credited with anticipating certain theories of depth psychology, particularly those of C. G. Jung whose concept of the integration of opposites forms the cornerstone of the individuation pro- cess (Russell 173-74). According to Jung, the successfully individuated self is a coincidentia oppositorum, or synthesis of light and dark qualities (5: 368). The process of individuation itself consists in the recognition of the shadow personality, the identification of its contents, and, in the case of men, its reconciliation to consciousness through the mediating role of the female anima (Hannah 270). Anticipating Jung, the Romantics sub-</page><page sequence="4">348 HISPANIA 73 MAY 1990 scribed to the notion that true human struggle lay in the urge to integrate good and evil. True evil lodged in the opposition of psychic principles; true good in their reconciliation (Russell 186). For the Romantics the polarity Christ/Satan came to signify precisely this need for psychic integration. As did the Ro- mantics and Jung, Unamuno likewise articu- lated the light and dark aspects of the soul through the symbolic indivisibility of Christ and Satan. The "Puerta" segment ofEl Cristo de Veldzquez expresses this idea with unmis- takable clarity: iPobre Luzbel, estrella de la tarde, en sombra de tinieblas convertido, caido desde el cielo como un rayo! iDale, Sefior, tu mano, y se derrita su sombra en las tinieblas de tu Padre, y vuelva a ser lucero matutino! (6: 439-40) Because of his transgression, Lucifer, once the fabled morning star, is banished from Heaven to the shadows of Hell. In this pas- sage, however, Unamuno pleads with Christ for reconciliation between the unlike brothers ("Dale, Sefior, tu mano"), who as an inte- grated unit, once more will come to signify a felicitous restitution of opposites in the grace of God, the Father. Fin de siecle interest in doubling as a psy- chological phenomenon has been attributed to the neo-Romantic revival which occurred in late nineteenth-century Europe.'o These were the years in which both Unamuno and Jung reached adulthood, and given their es- sentially romantic, somewhat mystical na- tures, it is hardly surprising that they would have shared an interest in the double, one of the most popular motifs in Romantic litera- ture.11 As captivated as he was by the phenome- nology of psychological dualism, it is quite possible that Unamuno might have been at- tracted to Lord Byron's exegesis of the Cain/ Abel legend. Jeffrey Burton Russell suggests that the Romantic poet interpreted the Biblical fratricide as an attack made by Cain/Lucifer on his unintegrated, rival self, or the Abel/ Jehovah facet of his personality (186). Al- though he denied the influence of Byron's Cain: A Mystery (1821) on Abel Sdnchez (2: 685), Unamuno, like Byron, equated Cain with Satan, and his empathetic description of Cain as predestined to do evil, damned a priori by God to a fall he could not evade, is also typi- cally Byronic.12 Don Miguel's pity of Cain is revealed un- equivocally by Joaquin Monegro during the famous banquet speech commemorating Abel's painting. "iPobre Cain!," he exclaims, "Nuestro Abel Sainchez admira a Cain como Milton admiraba a Satin ... porque admirar es amar y amar es compadecer. Nuestro Abel ha sentido toda la miseria, toda la desgracia inmerecida del que mat6 al primer Abel..." (2: 716, emphasis added).3 Although in this instance Unamuno compares Milton's admira- tion of Satan's tragic majesty to Abel's admira- tion of Cain, Byron's psychological approach to the Cain/Abel myth could not have but stim- ulated a responsive chord in Unamuno. Not only is Byron's Cain read and discussed by the antagonists of Abel Sanchez, but Unamuno himself conveys an interpretation of the Old Testament fratricide that is analogous to Byron's view of the same rivalry as an embodi- ment of split personality. Unamuno may have found additional inspira- tion in Robert Louis Stevenson's novel The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, an annotated copy of which exists in the Una- muno library at Salamanca (Vald6s 234).14 Similar to the Romantic and Jungian views of the human personality as a coincidence of op- posites, Stevenson's short novel has been in- terpreted as the story of a divided psyche battling for integration (Hannah 38-71). As does Stevenson, Unamuno intuits that split personality occurs when an ego rejects its unconscious shadow by denying it access to participation in the adult self. Under these circumstances the shadow splinters away from the personality and assumes the rival exis- tence of an autonomous psychic entity (Jung 9, i: 279). Joaquin Monegro, however, pre- sents the more infrequent psychological case in which the positive qualities which normally comprise the ego are rejected, while the neg- ative qualities of the shadow personality are permitted to surface and to seize hold of the ego (Hannah 19; Jung 5: 66). In these rare cases the positive characteristics of the ego are repressed causing it to assume negative character traits (Jung 9, ii: 8). Although it is normal to discharge psychic incompatibilities by projecting them onto others, it is likewise possible to reject the positive values one feels are alien or inaccessi- ble to the self (Jung 6: 457). Those parts of his personality which Joaquin erroneously re- jects as non-existent, namely kindness, voca-</page><page sequence="5">ARCHETYPAL MOTIFS OF THE DOUBLE IN UNAMUNO'S ABEL SANCHEZ 349 tional success, and a need to love and be loved in return, are projected onto Abel, who is none other than the positive, but suppressed, half of Monegro's divided ego. Considerable moral effort is required to face the self-scrutiny necessary to initiate a process of psychic integration. Although Monegro is capable of recognizing and iden- tifying the characteristics of his demonio de la guarda, as Unamuno terms the shadow personality (2: 707), he chooses to beat the inner demon into quiescence rather than to reconcile with him through acceptance. Joa- quin's tragedy lies in being unable to overcome the psychological resistance he feels toward assimilating the self which hates Abel, and in his rejection of his wife, Antonia, as anima and partner whose role it is to mediate the shadow to consciousness. Monegro therefore goes through life an unwell man, unwell be- cause of his insistence on separation rather than relatedness, and his fear and hatred of himself. Hate and rejection of some aspects of the self, personified by the pursuing shadow- image or double, often culminate in "suicide by way of death intended for the irksome per- secutor" (Rank 33). Joaquin's role in Abel's "accidental" death is thus symbolic of a last attempt to remove that part of the psyche which had pursued and tormented him for many years. The act is, of course, futile since the slaying of one's double is an illusory sep- aration of the ego from the self. This charac- teristic elimination of the "other" is tan- tamount to suicide since the ego cannot attain wholeness without the presence of all of its components. 15 Rather than relieving Joaquin of the unwel- come pursuits of his shadow, Abel's death causes him to fall into deep melancholy: "[un] espeso bochorno de misterio pesaba sobre la casa" (2: 757). Within one year of Abel's pass- ing, Joaquin seems to will his own death: "*Para que [vivir]? ?Para ilegar a viejo? ... call6. No quiso o no pudo proseguir" (2: 759). Monegro's end becomes imminent when a cru- cial part of his psyche is definitively severed, and with it, the reason for his existence. The death of this shattered man is permeated by the same sense of finality that overwhelms the tragic lives of all the characters in Unamu- no's repertoire who fail to complete a process of individuation. As conceived by Jung, the harmony of indi- viduation can only be attained through com- promise. It consists of a metaphorical smooth- ing of the rough edges of ego and shadow so that each can adjust more successfully to the other's dimensions. While the archetype of individuation surfaces repeatedly in Unamu- no's prose fiction, the metaphysical com- promise it implies seems to have made it im- possible for him to entertain the viability of psychic totality on the practical level. In Una- muno's ontology the essence of being is thought of as an "esfuerzo por ser mis, por serlo todo: es el apetito de infinidad y de eternidad" (3: 367). While don Miguel's "fu- riosa hambre de ser" (3: 114) alludes to what Jung sees as the human striving toward psychic plenitude, what Unamuno proves to be seeking is not an existentially tenable co- existence with the "other," but an aggressive kind of self-expansion through the "ingestion" of the potential rival.'16 This notion first appears in Dr. Montarco's claim that "... no es el crecimiento y la mul- tiplicaci6n de los seres lo que les pide mis alimento ... sino que es una tendencia a ... sobrepasar de lo necesario. No es instinto de conservaci6n sino instinto de invasi6n; no tira- mos a mantenernos, sino a ser mis, a serlo todo" (1: 1131). Unamuno's insistence on being all things at all times, while conserving a discrete, personal identity within the "whole," placed tremendous limitations on the conciliatory frame of mind necessary for a successful integration of psychological oppo- sites to take place. However much Unamuno's desire "por ser mis, por serlo todo" is also thought to indicate a protean ego or ontological insecurity, I be- lieve this kind of intensity to be the product of a psyche which yearned to incorporate its congeries of selves into a coherent and indis- soluble totality. It is conceivable that Unamu- no's unflagging exploration of the split per- sonality reveals an intent to analyze his dual nature through the therapy of literary crea- tion. The solution don Miguel reaches in Abel Sanchez, however, does not take into account a successful resolution of inner dualism. Nevertheless, Unamuno appears to find an equivalent ofJung's spiritual coincidentia oppo- sitorum in the chiasmus, a rhetorical trope which he transposes from its normally stylistic context to one allowing for the structuring of a novel based on the principle of binomial con- ceptualization. Essentially the chiasmus, a</page><page sequence="6">350 HISPANIA 73 MAY 1990 rhetorical device Unamuno favored through- out his work, inverts word order between two parallel phrases or clauses to yield paradoxi- cal, yet complementary meanings."7 The structural premise of this trope permits Una- muno to unite not only antithetical words or symbols, but entire concepts, while simul- taneously ensuring that each conserves a "separate but equal" status within the param- eters of this tenuous union. Adopting the chiasmus to convey the inner dualism of his protagonists seems to be the only response possible on Unamuno's part to the integration of psychological polarities. I suggest that only through the chiasmus, that is through the intellect, is Unamuno able to approach the archetype of individuation which he normally found inadmissible on the existen- tial and ontological levels. Thus his stories of male, and not infrequently female doubling, are but pretexts for a quest to reconcile what don Miguel perceived as his own conflictive public and private, or passive and aggressive personalities. Abel Sdnchez presents a good illustration of this point. While Joaquin Monegro begins life as an ostensibly cynical doctor, and Abel Sainchez as an intuitive artist, their attributes are quickly reversed: Monegro develops into an intuitive medical artist, while Sainchez be- comes a scientific painter and covert cynic. It is Abel who immortalizes on his canvasses the patients whose lives Joaquin fails to pro- long through medical science: "El, el que con su arte resucita e inmortaliza a los que tfi dejas morir por tu torpeza..." (2: 706). This chiastic juxtaposition is rendered by the follow- ing diagram: Joaquin Science X Abel Art Another chiasmus is constructed around the title of the novel. Although it bears the words "Abel Sanchez," the book is actually about Joa- quin Monegro, the character meant to repre- sent the ego personality whose tortured life the novel intends to chronicle. Abel Sinchez will be remembered by posterity only because Joaquin recreates Abel in his diary: "... la mayor coyuntura que tienes de perpetuarte ... no son tus cuadros, sino es que yo acierte a pintarte con mi pluma tal y como lo eres" (2: 747). Joaquin has, in effect, ingested Abel, and Abel becomes a kind of parasite, staying alive through the nourishment of Monegro's written word. However, as Abel becomes the recipient of Joaquin's rejected ego, he acquires a fic- tional stature greater than that of Joaquin. Without Abel, Joaquin would not have suffered the torments which led him to begin his jour- nal, and without this journal, Monegro has no reason to exist as the exceptionally tormented fictional entity that he is, worthy of a reader's attention. Unamuno therefore reverses the ego/shadow relationship as described in the chiasmus below: Joaquin Ego x Abel Shadow By allowing his shadow to replace his ego, Joaquin relinquishes autonomy and permits his conscious life to be manipulated by a threateningly independent alter-ego. The novel therefore bears Abel's name since it is Abel who determines the course of events in Joaquin's life. ike the rhetorical chiasmus which hurls two pairs of unlike, but complementary verbal constructs against each other into a momentary union, the splintered facets of Joa- quin the poetic scientist, and Abel the scien- tific painter, are simultaneously attracted to, and repelled by each other, sundered by their uncompromising individuality. Although Joa- quin and Abel are essentially indivisible, neither is able to surrender his autonomy in the interests of harmonious co-existence.18 Thus they remain, like Unamuno's own per- sonality, an ego forever at variance with its shadow. SNOTES 'The function of the shadow archetype is to represent not only the rejected, negative side of the psyche to the ego, but also those qualities one dislikes most in others. These incompatibilities are normally projected out of the self onto someone who appears to embody the unwel- come character traits (Hannah 18). 2Unamuno's fascination with mirrors and self-duplica- tion may originate in this dual and ambiguous significance of the double. 3Although born of Leda, Castor was fathered by the mortal Tyndareus, while Pollux was the son of Zeus. After Castor's untimely death, Zeus permitted Pollux to join his mortal brother, placing both in the constellation Gemini, the zodiacal sign of duality. For this, and other</page><page sequence="7">ARCHETYPAL MOTIFS OF THE DOUBLE IN UNAMUNO'S ABEL SANCHEZ 351 sections of the essay relevant to the mythology of Castor and Pollux, see the New Larousse Encyclopedia ofMythol- ogy 188-91. 4Unamuno's biographer notes that "la verdad es que [los dos hermanos] estuvieron separados de por vida esa invisible muralla de incomprensi6n.... En la inspiraci6n de El otro y Abel Sdnchez hay que ver la sombra de esta situaci6n fraterna y el sentimiento cainita no como algo atribuido al otro, sino como un temor a ser 6l mismo un Cain en potencia" (Salcedo 340; cf. 213-14; 291. Also Claveria 104-05). 5Unamuno obviously intended the reader to make an association between Helen of Troy and his own heroine since he chose to spell her name "Helena" in lieu of the more familiar Spanish rendering- "Elena"- of the same name. 'According to Jung, Helen of Troy, endowed with "con- siderable powers of fascination and possession," is an example of the anima-type woman (9, i: 28). As opposed to the anima archetype, the anima-motivated female has little individual personality or feelings for others, although she is the recipient of all the stereo-typical "female" mythology men tend to project upon her. Much like Una- muno's Helena, the anima-motivated woman is uncon- scious of the divisive effect her presence has upon men, and she manipulates them without being aware of the consequences of her behavior (Ulanov 252). 7P. L. Landsberg suggests that Unamuno may himself have embodied the Christ/Satan dichotomy: "La lucha mis profunda desencadenada dentro de Unamuno no es acaso entre el intelecto y el sentimiento, sino entre Cristo y Lucifer" (60-61). 8Direct references linking Joaquin either to Hell or to Lucifer occur approximately thirty times in the course of this short novel, most notably in the form of oxymora referent to the hell-fire and ice of the underworld: "Senti como si el alma toda se me helase. Y el hielo me devoraba el coraz6n. Eran como llamas de hielo" (2: 702). 9For pertinent bibliography regarding the Romantic equation Cain/Lucifer, see Russell 174 and Claveria 108, note 29; 115, note 34. Jung observed that "Cain has a Luciferian nature because of his rebellious progressive- ness," and remarked that Cain and Abel were the Old Testament prefiguration of Satan and Christ (11: 173, note 19). 'OThis fascination with doubling is attributed to the Romantics' over-simplification of Johann Gottlieb Fichte's (1762-1814) ontology of the Ego and non-Ego, errone- ously interpreted as being a theory of split consciousness. It was from Fichte that the idea of light and dark aspects of the soul was derived, and it appears that popularizing the German philosopher's work may have been responsi- ble for the ever-increasing use of the double in nineteenth- century literature (Rank 82; Ziolkowski 176-79). "Regarding Unamuno's romantic spirit and his pre- dilection for Romantic literary genres, see Zubizarreta 234. Unamuno himself commented on his "enorme fondo romintico" in the essay "Principales influencias extranje- ras en mi obra" (9: 816). For Freud's allegation that Jung was excessively "mystical," see Stein 84. '2For specific information relevant to Unamuno's famil- iarity with Byron's Cain, see Claveria 106-10 and Earle 87. "Unamuno empathizes with the Devil once more in the sonnet "Satan" (6: 378). The last tercet of the poem reveals that Lucifer deserves pity since "es que la vida con insidias / nos rodeas, teniindola en asedio / mientras ser mortales nos envidias." As does Milton in Paradise Lost, Unamuno implies in this sonnet, as well as in Abel Sdnchez, that envy plays an important role in the character attributes of the Devil. "In the short story "Artemio Heautontimoroumenos" (March 1918), Unamuno refers to Stevenson's tale of Jekyll and Hyde as a "maravilloso relato ... que nadie que quiera saber algo de los abismos del alma humana debe ignorar" (2: 877). '"Feal Deibe interprets Joaquin's rapid demise as a consciously sought death, that is, a form of suicide (149); Round also sees in Abel's death a form of self-immolation for Joaquin (44). '6Pertinent to our discussion is Unamuno's essay "La nube de la guerra o la Helena de Euripides" (October 24, 1914), published as a reaction to World War I. Here Unamuno chooses the Trojan War as a paradigm for armed conflict, which he understands to be nothing less than the desire of one nation to ingest, or to impose itself upon the collective personality of another: "Y hay perso- nalidad colectiva, etnica, que sabe que no puede conser- varse intacta sino imponiendose. Hay veces en que el invadir es defenderse. Pero los otros no se resignan a ser invadidos, a perecer para que el invasor se conserve" (4: 1216). '1Paul R. Olson and Thomas Mermall (Works Cited) have studied the significance and function of the chiasmus as a stylistic preference in Unamuno's essays. To my knowledge, however, the present study is a first attempt to relate don Miguel's preference for the chiasmus to his personal psychological needs. 'sAlthough the following observation by Claveria re- fers to El otro, it is an apt summation of all Unamuno's tales of fraternal rivalry and the chiasmatic framework within which they develop: "... en la oposici6n de pares de ideas contrarias y de parejas de simbolos opuestos, que aqui aparecen mis intensamente que en cualquier otra de sus obras, los dos hermanos han acabado por hacerse uno mismo" (119).
