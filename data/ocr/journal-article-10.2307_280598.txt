<plain_text><page sequence="1">RITUAL CONTINUITY AND TRANSFORMATION IN MESOAMERICA: RECONSTRUCTING THE ANCIENT MAYA CUCH RITUAL Mary Pohl The use of ethnohistoric and ethnographic data in interpreting evidence for prehistoric ritual activity is highly controversial in Mesoamerican circles. This paper traces the long history of a Maya ceremony identified as the cuch rite. Although transformations in characters and symbols have occurred, continuity is also evi- dent. Application of the ethnohistorical approach has suggested that a large corpus of ancient art depicts fer- tility and accession ceremonies. The stag appears to have been a major agricultural supernatural in Maya religion. ARCHAEOLOGISTS HAVE SPENT a considerable number of years and a great deal of money excavating Maya ceremonial centers. Yet, we have had very little idea of what rituals were per- formed there. This study suggests that one major fiesta was the transfer of the cuch, the "burden" or "cargo." The cuch may have embodied the idea of fertility, agricultural prosperity, and the con- tinuity of life. The cuch ceremony may also have been associated with Maya rulership. It is possible to reconstruct the cuch ritual by grouping ancient paintings and sculptures that share specific characters and action, thereby isolating a corpus of art focusing on this theme (Kubler 1969). The ordering and interpretation of this material can be greatly aided by com- parison with descriptions of present-day ceremonies, along with ethnohistoric observations. The idea of using modern and historic data to elucidate the prehistoric past is not new. Con- siderable controversy nevertheless exists over the use of such a method. Kubler (1967, 1969, 1970) warns of the problem of disjunction: form and meaning may separate and rejoin in different combinations. Even where form and meaning appear to show continuity, they may mask profound cultural discontinuity. The paradigm for the "law of disjunction" is the well-documented Early Christian revitalization of themes borrowed from Classical antiquity as described by the art historian Panofsky (1960). This research attempts to trace the degree to which continuity and change have taken place in a single ceremony over time. No one will deny that a profound discontinuity in Maya culture oc- curred when the Spaniards arrived, particularly in the function of ceremonialism. Nonetheless, the data suggest that transformations in the cuch drama can be identified and that enough con- tinuity exists to make an ethnohistoric approach to the interpretation of this ancient Maya ceremony productive. THE MAYA DATA In the Maya area, information on Precolumbian beliefs comes from stelae, murals, vase paint- ing, and graffiti dating primarily to the Late Classic period.

While only a very few of these religious books have survived, they do provide extended treatment of ritual events. Observations on religion in the historic era are not so complete as the Central Mexican data. References to traditional rites are often scattered and cursory. The friars described Maya ritual in connection with their effort to root out idolatory (e.g., Tozzer 1941; Scholes and Roys 1938). They never intended to be ethnographers. They may have misinterpreted aspects of the ceremonies that they witnessed. The precise correlation of thllese historical perceptions with either the prehistoric or the modern Maya data is not always obvious. Descriptions of present-day Maya ceremonies are particularly rich and abundant (e.g., Vogt 1969, 1976; Bricker 1973; Gossen 1974; Girard 1962, 1966; Redfield and Villa 1962; Redfield 1941; Villa 1945; Tozzer 1907). For the Maya, the "known" consists primarily of recent ethno- graphic literature. THE MODERN MAYA CARGO RITUAL The cargo transfer ceremony is practiced all over the Maya area today. The most prominent element of the ceremony is the bullfight. The bullfight is always associated with one of the Chris- tian holidays. In the Maya Lowlands this fiesta is usually the annual celebration held on the name- day of the patron saint of the village (Redfield and Villa 1962; Villa 1945). In the Highlands of Chiapas at Zinacantan, the bullfight coincides with Christmas (Vogt 1969, 1976). Note that for the Maya, the central event is the bullfight, not the Christian holiday. The bullfight drama is actually composed of three principal events. The first is the tree or pole raising ceremony (Redfield 1936). In the Maya Lowlands (Redfield and Villa 1962; Villa 1945), a sacred yaxche (ceiba or silk cotton) tree is procured from the forest and "planted" in a sacred enclosure. At X-Cacal, Quintana Roo, a coati impersonator traditionally climbs into the tree and throws squash seeds into the air to show that the yoxche has flowered. Then, in the branches, the "coati" hangs yams and gourds to represent the fruit of the yaxche (Villa 1945:128). This is a sacred Tree of Abundance. The second event is the bullfight itself. This episode takes place in a sacred enclosure. Lassos and other bullfight paraphernalia may be paraded around the bull ring to consecrate it before the corrida. Then in Quintana Roo, the bull, played by a costumed man, prances around the ring while other actors try to lasso him (Redfield 1941:274-278). Tozzer (1907:163) reported that the bull impersonator is tied up to the pole in the corral. In Zinacantan, the bull is associated with evil winds. When the bull impersonator is not per- forming, his costume is hung up and "purified" with incense three times each day to keep the evil spirits away. During the bullfight, the musicians play "bad" music. When the bull has been "killed," the musicians switch to "good" tunes (Bricker 1973:44-45). The bullfight is a bawdy drama with marked sexual symbolism. Some of the activity refers specifically to the hope for a good harvest in the coming year. Turtle shell drums are beaten with corn cobs, for example. The musicians say that the use of the corn cob beaters will help produce more corn (Vogt 1977:238). In the Chorti community of Quetzaltepeque, eastern Guatemala, once the bull is caught, the priest ties him up with five sacred knots. As the bull is tied, the priest enters a petition for health and good fortune in the coming year (Girard 1966:260-263). The subjugation of the bull marks the symbolic closing of the Chorti year. No harvest ceremony can be celebrated unless the agricultural cycle has been formally concluded. The kernels of maize have been the home of the divine spirit since the seed was consecrated on the altar the previous year. Once the deE,anctification rite has been performed, the gods of maize and rain can return to the sky where they rest (Girard 1962:307-308). In Zinacantan, when the bull is "dead," a ceremonial meal is prepared in celebration. The male characters participating in the bullfight supervise the preparation saying, "People from all the hamlets are going to eat together once we have killed the Bull" (Bricker 1973:43-45). Wherever the Maya can afford such extravagance, the slaughter of real bulls is an integral 514 [Vol. 46, No. 3,1981</page><page sequence="3">ANCIENT MAYA CUCH RITUAL part of the drama. In Chamula (Gossen, personal communication 1978), for example, a spec- tacular three-bull sacrifice takes place eight days before the climax of the festival. This sacrifice is associated with four great communal feasts in which thousands of people are fed chili and beef broth symbolizing the blood of the bull. The third principal event in the bullfight drama is the cargo transfer itself. In the Lowlands the transfer of the cargo takes place during the Dance of the Pig's Head (Redfield and Villa 1962; Villa 1945). The pig's head is accompanied by a decorated pole, called a ramillete. The pole em- bodies the idea of the burden or cargo (cuch in Maya), responsibility for the next year's fiesta. In this dance, the cargo is transferred from one cargo holder to the next. The Dance of the Pig's Head thus ensures the continuity of ritual and promotes community welfare. This particular episode was considered a very solemn moment in which the whole subtribe was expected to par- ticipate at X-Cacal (Villa 1945:130-131). The modern ritual is clearly an agricultural fertility rite. In the Maya Highlands it includes the change of cargo holders and is today an integral part of the cargo system, or civil-religious hierarchy. Wasserstrom (1976, 1978) has produced archival evidence to suggest that the civil-religious hierarchy observed in municipios such as Zinacantan developed as late as the nineteenth century, though this system may have been a transformation of earlier organizations. The history of the political and economic organizations tied to Maya ritual is an issue which can be separated from the question of symbolism. In this article the objective is to define the ceremonial events which make up the ritual and to trace continuity and change in its symbolic content. CUCH RITUAL DEPICTED IN PREHISTORIC ART Research has demonstrated that a large number of pottery vessels, sections of the codices and even graffiti share characters and symbolism, though the activities they portray may differ. When grouped, scenes emerge which reveal a dramatic sequence. The ancient illustrations might be compared to a series of Christmas cards, each depicting a different episode from the story of the birth of Christ. However, the subjects of Maya paintings have been identified as a prehistoric ritual, rather than a mythic event. For this paper, a few of the paintings have been selected to illustrate the cuch or deer ritual. One Late Classic style polychrome vase, said to have come from San Agustin Acasaguastlan, mid- dle Motagua, Guatemala (Smith and Kidder 1943: Figure 43b), is particularly instructive (Figure 1). On it is depicted a scene in which all attention is focused on a curious "float" composed of two elements. First, a tree grows from the top of a shell, which has a human face. Behind, couched in vegetal motifs, is a bearded peccary head. The characteristic peccary snout makes the identifica- tion unmistakable. At the edges of the roll-out drawing, an underworld character, covered with black death spots and carrying a sacrificial axe, is dragging away a man associated with the deer by his headdress. This is the figure of the stag impersonator, who is seen with a stylized femur projecting from his forehead. Bones are insignia of sacrifice in Mesoamerican iconography (Caso 1958:22). The sacrifice of the deer impersonator may be depicted elsewhere. A Late Classic period vessel in the Dumbarton Oaks collection (Coe 1975: Number 16) shows the horrible torture of an in- dividual on a scaffold. A burning firebrand is being applied to the victim's anus. Taube (1979) has pointed out that the hair of the unfortunate victim is being held up in the shape of deer antlers. In the Madred Codex, page 14b (Villacorta and Villacorta 1930), a skeletal death figure is torching the hind end of a stag without antlers. This scene supports the animal identification of the victim in the Dumbarton Oaks vase. In front of the scaffold, a vulture impersonator and another actor dressed as a jaguar or puma wait with spears. In a graffito from Temple II at Tikal (Anders 1963:Figure 25), the vulture and cat have just hurled a spear into a sacrificial victim tied to a scaf- fold. These two illustrations probably represent the death of the deer man. The San Agustin vase appears to present a theme of transition. We can make this inference on the basis of interpretation of the symbolism of the shell which appears there. Eric Thompson maintained that the shell was a symbol of death; Closs (1977) suggested that it signified birth, and 515 Pohl]</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Figure 1. Late Classic period polychrome vessel from San Agustin Acasaguastlin, middle Motagua, Guatemala (from Smith and Kidder 1943). pointed to the association of the shell with Ix Chel, goddess of childbirth. One possible conclusion which might be drawn from such a disparity of views is that the shell combined the ideas of death and rebirth. In the San Agustin Acasaguastlan vase, the shell appears with a tree growing up out of its back and is hailed by the human figures represented there. This suggests rebirth or regeneration. The famous Calcehtok vessel (Figure 2) also features a stag character. Eric Thompson (1970:368) thought that this painting was an ancient representation of Sun hiding in Deer's skin, an episode from the traditional folktale about the troubled union of Sun and Moon. An alternative interpretation is that the Calcehtok scene is related to the San Agustin Acasaguastlan painting. To the left of the Calcehtok scene, a stag is having his antlers removed. Red spots at the base of the antlers probably represent blood. The blanket on his back carries crossed bone symbols signi- fying death. The two men flanking the stag carry spears of the kind used in ancient sacrifices. The Sacred Tree can be found to the right, here with the anthropomorphic features of a deity forming its base. The tree is embellished with water symbolism and its branches resembie water lilies. Above the deity's ear are fixed three dots, insignia of the frog or toad. Curled in the branch- es is a snake with a blue tail. Blue was the Maya symbol for both sacrifice and water. This deer ritual is treated on pages 39 through 49 of the Postclassic period Madrid Codex (Anders 1967). Male deer without antlers are repeatedly shown tied to ceiba trees (Figure 3). The Madrid Codex carries the action further. The spearing and dismemberment of bound deer are depicted in detail (Figure 4). Evidently both the stag impersonator and real deer were sacrificed in the course of this ritual. Figure 2. Late Classic period polychrome vessel from Calcehtok, Yucatan. Spots have been added to the bottom of the stag's antlers based on colored representations (from Morley 1946). 516 [Vol. 46, No. 3,1981</page><page sequence="5">ANCIENT MAYA CUCH RITUAL Figure 3. One of many hornless stags tied to ceiba trees depicted in the Postclassic period Madrid Codex (from Tozzer and Allen 1910). In the Madrid Codex, God L, the Underworld God, is closely associated with the ceremony. He car- ries a sacrificial spear and wears a deer-sku.ll headdress (Figure 5). Evidence for ritual activity in Maya art dating to the Late Classic and Postclassic periods can be compared with data on the cargo celebration as we know it at the present time. The sacred Tree of Abundance appears in both the an d in the modern ceremony. The water lily, snake, and toad symbols were ancient fertility motifs. They have their counterparts in present-day emphasis on the promotion of crops. The binding of the deer seems to correspond to the lasso motif prevalent today. The act of tying had great significance in traditional Mesoameri- can thought. Writing in sixteenth-century Central Mexico, both Sahaguin (in Edmonson 1971:MS 67-68) and Duran (1971:389) recorded the "tying of the years" at the end of the 52-year calen- drical cycle. To be sure human sacrifice is not practiced now. Yet some of the events in today's bullfight drama remind one of the death of the prehistoric deer impersonator. In Dzitas, Yucatan, buffoons representing coatis try to catch small boys. If they snare one, they rub gunpowder on his anus (Redfield 1941:294). This action is analogous to the firebrand torture depicted in the Dumbarton Oaks vase and in the Madrid Codex. In Zinacantan, the San Sebastian fiesta constitutes an extension of the bullfight or sacrifice motif. Men mounted on horseback use lances to strike at a jousting target strung between two poles (Vogt 1969:548). Bricker (1978) believes that this target represents a heart. In a subsequent episode, characters representing the concept of life and death or transition (Bricker, personal communication to J. Pohl 1979) "shoot" two Chamula boys with miniature bows and arrows (Vogt 1969:548-549). Correspondence between the ancient and modern ceremonies can be found in many common traits. The principal difference is that in the prehistoric version of the ritual, deer and peccary ap- pear while in the present-day drama, the European bull and pig are used. An argument for the substitution, based on historical evidence, follows. My thesis is that the ceremony depicted in prehistoric Maya art is an ancient version of the modern cargo rite. The prehistoric fiesta will be called the cuch ritual. The Maya word for cargo, cuch, will distinguish the ceremony from the present-day festival.

God L, the Underworld Deity, in the Madrid Codex. The associated glyphs represent the four world directions (from Villacorta and Villacorta 1930). this complex as a year renewal ritual. I now believe that year renewal was a separate though related subject of ritual activity. RITUAL IN THE HISTORIC PERIOD Although the ancient and modern ceremonies bear obvious resemblances to each other, the cuch ritual is not so easy to find in the ethnohistoric literature. Landa (Tozzer 1941:153-156) de- scribes a pole-raising rite in sixteenth-century Yucatan. The ceremony was held in the month of Zip. This drama must have been an extremely important ritual event since the whole of the previous month was spent in preparation for it. The priests, in full ceremonial regalia, assembled at the house of the lord. On fresh boughs, especially procured, they spread out their books (codices) and anointed them with virgin water to purify them: This having been done, the most learned of the priests opened a book and looked at the prognostics of that year, and he manifested them to those who were present. And he preached to them a little, recommending to them the remedies for their ills, and he assigned this festival for the following year to the priest or lord who was to celebrate it, and if he whom they had appointed for this died, his sons were obliged to celebrate it in place of the deceased [Tozzer 1941:154]. Next, at the beginning of the month of Zip, the sacred bundles were opened. The Chacs, ritual assistants, smeared the idols and stones inside with blue. The question of the sponsorship of the fiesta for the next year is repeated by Landa. This issue was evidently a matter of great concern. The actual pole-raising is described thus: On the next day the hunters came together in one of the houses of one of their number and brought their wives with them like the rest. The priests came and drove away the evil spirit as usual. After he had been driven out they placed in the middle the apparatus for the sacrifice, incense and new fire, and the blue bitumen. And the hunters devoutly invoked the gods of the chase, Acanum, Suhui Dzip, Tabai and others, and distributed the incense which they threw into the brazier. And while it was burning, each took an arrow Pohl] 519</page><page sequence="8">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY and the skull of a deer, which the Chacs anointed with the blue bitumen. And some danced, holding these thus anointed in their hands, while others pierced their ears and others their tongues, and passed through the holes seven rather wide blades of a kind of grass called ac. This done, the priest first, and then the of- ficers of. the festival, offered the gifts; and so dancing, the wine was poured out, and they got drunk until they were overcome. At once on the following day the fishermen celebrated the festival in the same way as the others, except that the things which they anointed were their fishing implements, and they did not pierce their ears, but they cut them round the edges, and they danced a dance called Chohom, and when all this was done, they blessed a tall and thick pole, and set it upright. When this festival was ended in the towns, the lords were accustomed to go to celebrate it with a larger number of people on the shore where they caught a large number of fish with rejoicings, for they carried a large supply of trammel nets, hooks and other instruments for fishing (Tozzer 1941:155-156). Landa presents this ceremony as a hunting and fishing rite. A closer examination of his account reveals, however, that the ritual performed in the sixteenth-century Yucatan differs only in certain details from the ceremony shown in the prehistoric paintings. A pole appears in place of the tree, for example. Further, Sahagiun (1951) and Duran (1971) tell us that in Central Mexico a pole was raised at the fiesta of Xocotl uetzi, which can be translated as "Fall of Fruits." The name suggests that the Mexican pole was originally a tree. The presence of the pole in Yucatan might be attributed to Mexican influence, which was strong in the Postclassic period. Meanwhile, Landa's description of the dancers carrying arrows and skulls anointed with blue reminds one of the figure of God L in the Madrid Colex (Figure 5). In addition, the fact that the fiesta was held in the month of Zip was probably significant. Modern Lowland Maya recognize the zip as protectors of deer (Villa 1945:103). The sacrifice of a deer impersonator was not performed for the Spaniards, who had made their distaste for such practices known. Plenty of blood was nonetheless provided through autosacri- fice. Landa tells us that one of the deities invoked in this ceremony was Tabai. Today in Yucatan, the tabai are known as awesome female creatures encountered in the forest. They can appear to the Maya as snakes wrapped in ceiba trees (Redfield and Villa 1962:122; Villa 1945:104). This image was encountered earlier in the ancient Calcehtok vessel (Figure 2). In the art of the Postclassic Mixtec codices and on earlier engravings from Monte Alban, Furst (1977) has identified a female tree deity which was regarded as the mother of royal lineages. Historical traditions recorded in The Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel provide evidence for the association of trees with lineages among the Maya (Roys 1967:63-66). In the Ritual of the Bacabs, the names of trees were often preceded by the feminine prefix ix or x, indicating that they were probably considered female (Roys 1965:xiii-xiv). The three-dotted toad symbol in the Calcehtok tree might indicate that it is female. Toads are depicted on robes worn by Classic period women (Morris 1980). Perhaps Landa's Tabai was originally a Maya tree goddess who was responsible for generation. Analogies with the prehistoric Calcehtok vessel suggested a connection with agricultural fertility, but the historical data indicate that the idea of generation of the nobility might also have been involved in the cuch rite. The Spaniards of course wanted all such pagan rites to cease. They conceived of the Conquest as both a Christianizing and a civilizing effort. They introduced their bullfight, a quasi-religious celebration, into the New World. The seventeenth-century historian Remesal recorded the initia- tion of Spanish customs like the bullfight, as well as the juego de caffas, also still practiced in Zinacantan during the fiesta of San Sebastian (Remesal 1964-1966; Wasserstrom, personal com- munication 1978). Since the natives were not expected to participate in Church affairs at a high level (Wasserstrom 1976), their participation in events like the bullfight was probably a source of satisfaction to the friars. In the course of his travels in the Maya area during the early nineteenth century, Stephens wit- nessed several bullfights (1841, I: 210-219, 255, 262-263, 298-300). These varied in character, and from Stephens's descriptions of nineteenth-century bullfights we can infer that there were two kinds. One was typically Spanish. The other was typically Indian. In Guatemala City, the first bullfight of the season was held on Christmas day in a huge amphi- 520 [Vol. 46, No. 3,1981</page><page sequence="9">ANCIENT MAYA CUCH RITUAL theater filled with thousands of people of all sorts. The event featured matadors, who tackled the bull in familiar Spanish fashion (Stephens 1841, 1:298-300). This bullfight was quite different from that performed at Jalacho, a settlement on the road from Merida to Campeche. There a live bull was tied to a post in the center of the Plaza de Toros. Stephens (1843:193) remarked that the process by which the bull was killed was much more fierce. The Jalacho rite was associated with the fiesta of Santiago, who was locally regarded as a worker of miracles. The ceremony included homage to the figure of the saint on horseback, which stood in the Church. This fiesta was celebrated only by Indians. According to Stephens (1843:189-192), the fair was not attended by merchants with foreign goods. THE SUBSTITUTION OF THE BULL FOR THE DEER When Cort6s crossed Pet6n, Guatemala, in 1525, his men came upon a savanna filled with deer. The animals were very tame, and the Spaniards were able to kill many. When the Spanish soldiers inquired about the strange behavior of the deer, the Indians explained that the animals were gods. The main Maya idol took the form of a deer. The Indians observed a taboo on hunting so the animals were not used to being pursued (Diaz del Castillo in Thompson 1977:12; L6pez de Cogolludo 1971, I:58). Prophecies were pervasive in Maya culture just before the Conquest. In the Popol Vuh, the sacred book of counsel which embodies Late Postclassic Quiche traditions, the deer was to be the lord of the next creation. The ancestral men of the Fourth (present) Creation prepare to die say- ing, "It is already the turn of our Lord Deer/Reflected in the Sky" (Edmonson 1971:MS 7123-7124). Bishop Landa reported that his informant Juan Cocom showed him: a book which had belonged to his grandfather, son of the Cocom whom they killed at Mayapfn. In it was painted a deer, and his grandfather had said to him that when great deer-for this is what they called cows-should enter this land, the cult of the gods would end, and this had come to pass because the Spaniards brought large cows (Tozzer 1941:44-46). The "great deer" did indeed arrive as predicted. The first manifestations of the deity actually came in the form of horses. On his trip through Peten, Cort6s's horse became lame, and he left it in the care of the Maya at Tayasal. The Indians revered the animal as a rain deity (L6pez de Cogolludo 1971, I:60). The reaction of the Maya to horses played a key role in the success of Montejo's first campaign to conquer Yucatan in 1528. According to the Spaniards, the Indians were not so much afraid of them as afraid of their horses. "Had it not been for the horses, which went about loose and neighed and served as sentinels, and because the Indians felt such terror of them . . . that they ran off, not a Christian in the land would have escaped death" (Oviedo in Chamberlain 1948:45). At Belma, which was probably Ecab near Cape Catoche, Montejo and the lords summoned the natives of the surrounding countryside to come "in peace ... to see what kind of people the Chris- tians were and to be shown the horses . .., for the fame of such animals flew through all the land and they were a source of great amazement" (Oviedo in Chamberlain 1948:47). Montejo took ad- vantage of the situation by organizing an equestrian spectacle. Some Indians "fell to the ground overcome" (Oviedo in Chamberlain 1948:47). When Fathers Orbita and Fuensalida visited the Itza at Tayasal in 1618, they found the natives worshipping a statue of Cort6s's horse. This was by now their principal idol (L6pez de Cogolludo 1971, 1:60). The fathers objected to this idolatry, but the horse cult appears to have spread. Horse bones, as well as cattle bones, have been found in Lowland Maya caves (Mercer 1975; Hatt 1953). These underground caverns were probably used for ritual. Deer bones and carvings of deer (Mercer 1975; Savage 1978) are also common there. These cave remains provide archaeo- logical documentation for the addition of the horse to the native pantheon and confirm its relation to the aboriginal deer deity. Pohl] 521</page><page sequence="10">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Horse worship evidently coexisted with Christian beliefs introduced by the Spanish clergy. The head of a horse carved from coral has been recovered in the excavation of the early colonial set- tlement at Tancah on the east coast of Yucatan. Archaeological work has revealed that a chapel had also been built there (Miller and Farriss 1979). In accepting new elements into their religion, the Maya did not necessarily feel obliged to give up their old beliefs. During the Inquisition of 1562, which Bishop Landa organized in Yucatan, this attitude was expressed. One Indian said, "we should receive what the padres say to us, but we ought not on that account to cease to perform our idolatries" (Scholes and Roys 1938:605). The Inquisition was touched off, according to L6pez de Cogolludo (1971, I:410-411), by the chance discovery of a deer sacrifice in a cave near Mani. Inquisition testimony (Scholes and Adams 1938, I1:58-63, 93-99) revealed that deer, pigs, dogs, and children were being sacrificed in the ancient manner at the foot of the cross in the cemeteries of churches and even inside the churches themselves. For the Maya, the cross was an alternative form of their sacred tree. Perhaps these sacrifices were related to the prehistoric cuch ritual identified above. Deer were said to have been offered to idols identified as Tabai and Aquehe. The latter might be construed as Ah Ceh, meaning "principal male deer" (Scholes and Roys 1938:608-609). The In- dians confessed that they had performed these rites for rain, for maize, and for the taking of many deer (Scholes and Adams 1938, I:25, 121). According to some Inquisition testimony, native religious leaders were advocating that their followers turn away from Christianity. Donald Thompson (1954) interpreted this evidence as in- dicative of widespread hostility towards the Spanish friars. Thompson attributed the combination of Christian and native elements in post-Conquest Maya religion to confusion resulting from the Spaniards' insistence on adherence to the new beliefs. Actually the ethnohistoric data on initial contact demonstrate that the Maya had at first been exceedingly receptive to what the Spaniards had to offer, from horses to crosses. Miller and Far- riss (1979) have pointed out that in the Lowlands, the forces of the friars were small. The Indians at Tancah could not have received regular attention from a Spanish priest, and yet, the Indians built a chapel. Archaeological excavation has shown that the natives had supported the fathers and built churcurches, just as the Franciscans had reported. The feelings of the native leaders which were to emerge at the time of the Inquisition might thus be attributed as much to jealousy as to hostility. The combination of Spanish and Maya elements in the new religion can be seen as a logical result of Precolumbian prophecies. The Inquisition of 1562 was brutal. Torture was used to extract testimony from the Indians, and the "guilty" wee severely punished. Since most of the evidence centere d worship of the deer and sacrifices of venison, the Inquisition must have taught the Indians to be more wary of practicing their traditional religion in a form which the Spaniards could recognize. In the Highlands, the friars had closer contact with their flocks. Yet they too were well aware of the way the Indians made use of Christian teachings for their own ends. In the seventeenth cen- tury, former Dominican Thomas Gage wrote: they yield unto the Popish religion, especially to the worshipping of saints' images, because they look upon them as much like unto their forefathers' idols, and secondly because they see some of them painted with beasts-Jerome with a lion, Anthony with an ass, and other wild beasts, Dominic with a dog, Beas with a hog, Mark with a bull and John with an eagle-they are more confirmed in their delusions, and think verily those saints were of their opinion, and that those beasts were their familiar saints . . . [Gage 1958:234]. Later, the eighteenth-century historian Ximenez issued the same complaint. He grumbled that the natives resisted what was "genuinely sacred" and revered the saints on horseback like San- tiago and San Martin, as well as those appearing like animals such as the evangelists (Ximenez 1929-1931, 111:261). Periodic attempts were made to eradicate these idolatries (MacLeod 1973:345). The Maya may have found that one solution to harassment from zealous Spanish friars was the bullfight. The evidence that the Maya bullfight is a transformation of an aboriginal deerfight is 522 [Vol. 46, No. 3,1981</page><page sequence="11">ANCIENT MAYA CUCH RITUAL largely circumstantial. The fact that the action sequence of the modern bullfight is very similar to a ceremony involving deer depicted in prehistoric art has already been demonstrated. The case for a direct connection between the two rituals is strengthened by the attitude of the present-day Maya towards the bullfight. In Santa Eulalia, a Jacaltec Maya town in the conservative Chuchumatan mountains, the Bull Dance is very "delicate." It must be referred to as kanal k'eq, "black dance." Anyone who calls it baile de toros will be put in jail (La Farge 1947:81). At Chan Kom, Yucatan, the traditional Maya religious leaders known as h-menob take part in ceremonies that are associated with the bullfight. The h-menob do not participate in those parts of the fiesta that celebrate the name-day of the patron saint where Catholic prayers are recited (Redfield and Villa 1962:75). The most dramatic suggestion that the bullfight is the Precolumbian deerfight can be found in the climax of the present-day cargo ceremony in Zinacantan. As the actors are preparing to dispatch the bull, they cut off his horns and replace them with deer antlers (Bricker, personal communication 1977). Today the bullfight is explicitly identified as a Maya ceremony, and the Indians display marked resistance to its association with national culture. The bullfight seems to have been tolerated by the Spaniards. Although the friars had com- plained that the Indians worshipped animals associated with the saints, including the bull, no record of their objections to the bullfight has yet been found. Evidently its superficial resemblance to the beloved Spanish custom made the ritual acceptable to these clergymen. Also local entre- preneurs were no doubt anxious to sell bulls to the natives for ceremonial feasts (Bricker, per- sonal communication 1978), and a ban on the ritual would probably have been unpopular. In the eyes of the Maya, the bull must have seemed the perfect star for their cuch drama. The animal's ferociousness suited the evil that the animal was supposed to represent. Its black color was appropriate to the fiesta. Both Spanish and Maya attitudes toward the bull and the bullfight have undoubtedly accounted for the perpetuation of this essentially prehistoric rite. It is difficult to accept the notion that prehistoric ceremonialism has survived. The present-day Maya are not simple farmers pursuing a Precolumbian way of life in isolated mountain and jungle refuges. All Maya have been inextricably drawn into the national economic market. Such has been the case since the Conquest, especially in the Highlands. In Zinacantan, for example (Wasserstrom 1976), men have traditionally spent considerable periods of time working away from the municipio. Their participation in ritual fiestas has often been impossible. Disease has taken its toll on the inhabitants as well. Highland Chiapas suffered substantial depopulation be- tween 1520 and 1920. Economic repression and the hostility of the Spaniards towards native culture eventually caused the Maya to turn to resistance. Nativism is strong among these Indians. Overt, military movements such as the early eighteenth-century "Tzeltal Revolt," which took place in the High- lands, and the War of the Castes, which erupted in the Lowlands in the mid-nineteenth century, are one form of rebellion which the Maya have undertaken. The Maya have also defied their op- pressors by quietly insisting on the perpetuation of aboriginal rituals, which have been elaborated upon with the unwitting aid of the Spaniards. The very fact that historic patterns of labor exploita- tion have forced the Maya to travel widely and to interact with kinsmen from other regions may have ensured that the ancient customs are not forgotten. The disjunctive situation itself has in the long run been responsible for the continuation of native religious beliefs. APPLICATION OF THE ETHNOHISTORICAL APPROACH This research suggests that although major changes in the political and economic context of Maya ritual have occurred, the content of the present-day cargo transfer ceremony featuring the bullfight is very much like a Precolumbian drama depicted in ancient paintings. Analysis of Pohl] 523</page><page sequence="12">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY clusters of traits has revealed that the ceremonies are similar enough to demonstrate the viability of the ethnohistorical approach for investigating prehistoric Maya religion. Information on this rite gathered in the modern and historic periods can be used to interpret the pictures of ancient ritual activity. The focus of the modern cargo ceremony is on rain, fertile crops, and economic pros- perity-themes which were expressed by Lowland Maya informants during the Inquisition of 1562. The prehistoric drama can, therefore, plausibly be interpreted as an agricultural rite. This hypothesis is supported by the water symbolism prevalent in the ancient pictures. The present-day cargo transfer ceremony is the most significant fiesta of the Maya ceremonial cycle. The drama marks the closing of the agricultural year. The historic data suggest that before the Spaniards destroyed the codices, these books were also used for prognosticating events in the coming year. The large number of Precolumbian scenes devoted to the cuch rite indicates that the ritual was also immensely important in prehistoric times. In the documents relating to the Inquisition of 1562, a deer deity, successful hunting, and offer- ings of venison were closely linked to the agricultural ceremonies. Consideration of the habits of the deer might reveal why this animal came to be identified with cultivation. White-tailed deer are scarce in mature rain forests. They are most abundant on the edges of fields and in second growth where plenty of browse is available. As agriculture spread throughout the tropical forest, the deer evidently became intimately associated with cultivation in the Maya mind. Thus, when Cortes left his horse in the hands of the Maya at Tayasal, they worshipped it as a Chac, a rain dei- ty, because they believed that the animal was the "great deer" which had been prophesied. Even today, a deer sacrifice is required for the traditional Lowland Maya chaa chac rain ceremony in northern Belize (Abrams, personal communication 1975). Archaeologists have assumed that ancient pictures of deer simply represented hunting scenes. The Spaniards placed a similar interpretation on the ceremonies which they witnessed in the historic period. The ethnohistorical approach has revealed that the Maya strongly identified hunting with agricultural ceremonies. Villa (1945:58) indicates that special, communal hunts (ppuh) have traditionally been organized to get the meat required for such rituals. The historic record suggests that the deer itself was a prominent supernatural in the Maya pan- theon, perhaps equal to the jaguar. In scenes of the prehistoric cuch ritual, the jaguar and his cohort the vulture spear the deer impersonator. A modern dance common in the Highlands con- sists of a confrontation between the deer and the jaguar (e.g., Mendelson 1958). The Maya evidently consider the deer and the jaguar well matched. As reconstructed here, the Maya cuch ritual was a fertility rite, but this fiesta, or a related one, may once have had other connotations as well. The drama may have been linked to the nobility and to accession ceremonies. The suggestion that Tabai was a female deity from which elite lineages were believed to have sprung has already been made. An examination of the corpus of Maya art depicting dynastic ceremonies, i.e., carved stelae and the Bonampak murals (Proskouriakoff 1960, 1963, 1964; Kubler 1969), indicates that the characters, paraphernalia and symbols from the cuch drama are present: the jaguar and vulture figures (Bonampak Room 2) (J. Pohl, personal communication 1970), spear sacrificers (associated with Tlaloc imagery on Tikal Stela 31), bound men (e.g., Palenque Tablet of the Slaves), the scaffold, which may double as a ladder (e.g., Piedras Negras Stela 6), and sacrifice, sometimes of numerous victims (e.g., Bonampak Room 2, Piedras Negras Stela 11). The deer is present too. At Palenque, the Tablet of the Slaves shows the new ruler (Schele 1978:66) flanked by a woman sitting on top of a white-tailed deer with immature antlers. In Room 2 at Bonampak (Rupper et al. 1955), one of the two central figures presiding over the captive scene wears a deer headdress. Schele (1979) thinks she has identified a bloodletting glyph associated with Maya accession ceremonies. Blood may have been shed in a ritual similar to the cuch rite. Precolumbian art suggests that spear or arrow sacrifices may have been characteristic of dynastic ceremonies in many parts of Mesoamerica (J. Pohl 1979). 524 [Vol. 46, No. 3,1981</page><page sequence="13">ANCIENT MAYA CUCH RITUAL The connection between the cuch ritual and accession may have rested in the symbolism of the "burden." Ancient Maya rulers may have manipulated the idea of responsibility for community welfare, which modern data suggests was embodied in the cuch. The Maya depicted their rituals in a disjointed fashion. A single scene on a polychrome vessel was evidently sufficient to commemorate the whole ceremony, just as our Christmas card em- bodies the whole of the Nativity Saga. Even in the codices, the sequence of pictures does not seem to have been intended as a guide to the action. Stags bound to ceibas appear after a lengthy dis- memberment episode in the Madrid Codex (Figure 4). The script of the cuch drama was well known to all ancient Maya. Archaeologists must use their knowledge of the festival in both the historic and modern eras to assemble a corpus of representations and to arrange them in the proper order. For example, sixteenth-century ac- counts indicate that ritual fishing parties took place and that fish were sacrificed along with deer. In the archaeological record, fish have often been found in caches and burials (M.E.D. Pohl 1976). An engraved bone from a high-status, Late Classic period burial at Tikal (Figure 6) shows Chacs, rain deities, engaged in fishing. Their hair is bound up in the style of sacrificial victims. They have bones in their noses. Their headdresses may represent stylized deer ears. This carving might depict the fishing episode in the cuch celebration as it has been described in the historic era. Even if the Tikal bone is not actually part of the cuch corpus, the symbolism is clearly linked to it. Modern Maya beliefs support this conclusion. The Chorti, for instance, believe that the fish is the offspring of the serpent, which is one form of the rain deity, and of the earth, represented by the crocodile. As such, the fish symbolizes the young maize god. These animals are associated with one another in prehistoric art. The animal metaphors are probably ancient (Girard 1966:83-85). The symbolic connection between these animals and fertility may again be rooted in the habits of the animals. Fish and crocodiles live in water, and snakes appear when it rains. The evidence for both prehistoric and modern Maya beliefs suggests that the Tikal carving can- not be viewed solely as a fishing expedition. The scene probably represents a ritual, collective fishing party promoting vegetation. * I I j ! {- o- a_ Figure 6. Ritual fishing scene engraved on bone from Burial 11l Figure 6.

Pohl] 525</page><page sequence="14">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY SUMMARY A Maya ritual involving the sacrifice of a deer, which is depicted in prehistoric art, has been shown to have survived into modern times. The present-day drama includes a bullfight in place of the ancient deerfight. This particular transformation may have appealed to the Maya because the Spaniards, thinking that the bullfight was a Spanish custom, did not persecute the Indians for per- forming it. More importantly, prophecies about the coming of the "great deer," prevalent in the Postclassic period, must have led the Maya to accept the bull. They may have considered the bull- fight an improvement over their aboriginal rite. Knowledge of this ceremony in the historic and especially in the modern eras can be used to identify a corpus of scenes depicting the prehistoric drama and to interpret the ancient drawings. The fiesta has been identified as a fertility ritual. Originally, the drama may also have been per- formed at accession ceremonies. By analogy with the modern rite, the central action in the ancient ceremony is thought to have been the transfer of the cuch, responsibility for the well-being of the community. The festival has been named the cuch ceremony. This analysis has suggested that the Maya were accustomed to casting their concerns about agriculture in animal metaphors. The stag may have been a major supernatural in the Maya pan- theon. Today the deer is associated with rain and crops from the southwestern United States to South America (Hulkrantz 1979). Tewa-speaking people of San Ildefonso pueblo in the American South- west raise a pole with a deer fastened to the top (Parsons in Redfield 1936). In rites for their crops, the Diaguita of northern Chile sacrifice deer heads penetrated by arrows. Among the Mun- duruc(u (Murphy 1958), rain mothers used to appear to shamans in the shape of black deer. My hypothesis is that the stag was at one time a significant ritual character throughout Meso- america. The Borgia Codex, thought to have come from Tlaxcala or Veracruz (Nicholson 1966), may be one piece of evidence. Pages 52 and 53 show the spear sacrifice of a male deer and a large, splayed stag analogous to scenes from the Madrid Codex (Figure 4). Two figures perform autosacrifice with bones resembling deer humeri. The blood appears to flow from the heads of the bones, providing nourishment to a sacred tree which sprouts corn cobs. Female skeletal imagery, representing the concept of rebirth according to Furst, appears at the base of the tree. The bullfight is, of course, very popular all over Mexico. The bull ceremony held at Mitla, Oaxa- ca (Parsons 1936), is very similar to that observed today by the Maya. Perhaps the phenomenon of the ritual replacement of the deer by the bull occurred in many places. Only a careful analysis of the history of these ceremonies will reveal whether my hypothesis is correct. Acknowledgments. Victoria Reifler Bricker's theory about the replacement of the deer by the bull in Maya ritual provided the starting point for this project. Bricker has provided many further insights in the course of its development. Betty Ann Brown, Paul Diener, Grant Jones, Cecelia Klein, George Kubler, Charles Lacombe, Tatiana Proskouriakoff, Jan Rus, Evon Z. Vogt, Rob Wasserstrom and two anonymous reviewers contributed comments and ideas. Some of them disagree with my position. I thank them all for their interest.
