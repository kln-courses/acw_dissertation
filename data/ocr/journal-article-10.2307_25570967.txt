<plain_text><page sequence="1">Printing the Dragon's Bite: Joyce's Poetic History of Thoth, Cadmus, and Gutenberg in Finnegans Wake Moshe Gold Fordham University Writers often invoke metaphors of children and parenting to describe their books, but James Joyce takes this cliche to an extreme. In Finnegans Wake, he creates mythological stories?or poetic histories as Giambattista Vico might say1?of agri culture, alphabets, printing, and parenting. Whereas Vico often pres ents poetic history in Homeric terms, Joyce had already worked with a Homeric model in Ulysses. Part of the project of Finnegans Wake, I argue, is to redo poetic history, with an emphasis on the development of printing and particularly the figures of Cadmus and Thoth. In effect, Joyce replaces Vico's oral model (based on Homer) with a print model (based on Cadmus, Thoth, and Johann Gutenberg) because the Wake actually maps out a history of Joyce's own work in progress. This emphasis on print (and its concomitant myths) differentiates the Wake from Vico's oral poetic history;2 moreover, it suggests that Joyce's project not only parallels Vico's but continues a process of revisionary history explored in Ulysses. The result, however, is neither a general history of print nor a miscellaneous collection of parenting metaphors. Rather, with great wit and hubris, Joyce wants readers to think of all the different histories of parenting, alphabetic genealogies, and print cultures as precursors leading to the production of one spe cific child: the actual printed book of Finnegans Wake. Indeed, in the Wake, individual letters and the process of printing are building blocks for Joyce's tour of cultural constructions. From the Bible's Babel to the "turrace of Babbel" (FW 199.31), all letters, words, phrases, and sentences are fabricated. Finnegans Wake is as much about its own alphabetic bricks as about the finished building. If the figure of Finnegan is a brick-layer, then Joyce is an alphabetic constructionist. Nothing is taken for granted in this building process, not even the production of the physical objects of Joyce's own writ ing?his books, paper, font, ink, glue. Joyce, in other words, turns to print history to build the book from his own raw material. Each print ed page of Finnegans Wake announces the matter of letters; it is even a 269</page><page sequence="2">family affair, from ALP's letter to the two sons (Shem the Penman and Shaun the postman) who turn individual letters of the alphabet into type and printed books to be carried to the entire world. Simply put, knowledge of Joyce's poetic history of the printing process is crucial to understanding Finnegans Wake. Both Joyceans and the larger critical community can, I argue, inter pret Finnegans Wake as a cultural document of the history of print that proposes a unique convergence of parenting and printing. Joyce conjoins bloody histories of writing, parenting, and husbandry to show us how myths of printing and mechanics of printing intersect one another in often damaging and uncontrollable ways. Specifically, through such neologisms as "vellatooth fust," "dragooned peoplades armed to their teeth," and "Gutenmorg . . . wordpress" (FW 303,03, 134.05-06, 20.07-09), Joyce invents a new poetic history of textual production and thereby parents his own offspring, the Wake. With such neologisms, Joyce connects Cadmus (who plants dragon-teeth) to the Egyptian mythic figure of Thoth (whom Joyce associates with the word "tooth") and Gutenberg (who prints, in the Wake, with alphabetic bits and types of teeth) to his own work in progress. In so doing, Joyce's text thereby makes us aware of the continuing cultural effects of Thoth's divine words, Cadmus's actions, and the offspring of sown teeth-letters and Gutenberg's "latterpress" (FW 356.21). In addition, the Wake enriches poetic histories of Draco (Cadmus)?such as Vico's?with printing and different kinds of bodily reproductions. Joyce even sows previous artists (like William Blake and John Milton) and their productions into the lines, furrows, and print of Finnegans Wake; like the dragon's teeth, the agricultural "alphabites" undergo metamorphoses (FW 263 fl). Throughout all the changes, however, Joyce's violent histories of alphabets, teeth ("bites"), and printing lead his readers to his own production of Finnegans Wake. Joyce turns the single figure of Cadmus into an immense semantic field. The mythological Cadmus brings in alphabetic characters from Phoenicia to Greece, kills a dragon, and plants its teeth in the ground. Parenting and husbandry merge when he tills the alphabetic dragon teeth, thereby growing warriors/five of whom help Cadmus found Thebes. To cultivate new stories of print cultures, Joyce updates the parenting and planting actions of Cadmus, merging them with the movements of print types in Gutenberg's printing presses and writing. In his own bizarre poetic history, Joyce has Cadmus till his famous dragon's teeth in the furrows (lines) of the Wake's earth (printed text). Joyce would have us believe that, by using alchemy, grown letters, and Gutenberg's movable type, the actual printing of the Wake gives birth to the Wake's letters. Moreover, as we read and help the Wake's alphabets grow, Joyce actually wants us?his read ers?to grow to use (though we will not grow used to) his alphabetic 270</page><page sequence="3">bits of husbandry: "furrowards, bagawards, like yoxen at the turn paht. ... we soon grow to use of an allforafoY" (FW 18.32-19.02, my italics). To understand Joyce's poetic history, that is, we must not only go "bagawards" (backwards) to mythologies of the plowed earth giv ing birth to alphabets, print, and bags of words, but we must also go ''furrowards" (forwards) to new printing revolutions that will take us beyond Gutenberg. It is not surprising that Marshall McLuhan refers to the Wake when he makes his claims about the spartoi (the dragon-teeth-men of Cadmus), the alphabet, and printing.3 In discussing "four mas sive myths of the Gutenberg transformation of society .,. Gargantua . . . Don Quixote, the Dunciad, and Finnegans Wake" (Gutenberg 147), McLuhan argues that [t]he Cadmus myth that the sowing of the dragon's teeth, or the letters of the alphabet, by King Cadmus, caused armed men to spring up is a concise and accurate oral myth. ... If there is any doubt whether the Cadmus myth uses "dragon's teeth" as an allusion to the technology of the hieroglyph, there need be none at all about [Francois] Rabelais's insistence on pantagruelion as the symbol and image of printing from movable types. (Gutenberg 147)4 Even without McLuhan's assertions about Rabelais's connection between "dragon's teeth" and "movable types," we can see howr Joyce forces us to ask about Cadmus's role both prior to and in print culture. That is, for Joyce's poetic history to work effectively, he must transform previous histories of Cadmus into an intertextual geneal ogy of dragons, teeth, and movable types, working within complex textual movements from hieroglyph to alphabet to printing in order to alter the history of Gutenberg's cultural reproductions, The Wake, thus, underscores the problem one encounters when attempting to interpret poetic histories: the inability to create or discover a com plete, exact genealogy The Cadmus myth, after all, has many literary ancestors and children. It is as if Joyce were saying that, once a poetic history starts growing, it is nearly impossible to stop its textual pro ductions: one printed text begets another. In 1725, Vico, in the New Science, tells his own poetic history of Cadmus, a Greek sower of teeth-warriors who was turned into Draco, a dragon. The following story from Vico prepares some of the ground, so to speak, for Joyce's agricultural and technological tilling and printing of Cadmus, his dragon-men (the interpretive spartoi), and cultural aggression: This whole divine and heroic history of the theological poets was only too unhappily described for us in the fable of Cadmus. For first he slays the great serpent (clears the earth of the great ancient forest). Then he ;\;'v::-;-;:27i--.;;</page><page sequence="4">sows the teeth (a fine metaphor for his plowing the first fields of the world with curved pieces of hard wood, which, before the use of iron was discovered, must have served as the teeth of the first plows, and teeth they continued to be called). He throws the heavy stone (the hard earth which the clients or famuli wished to plow for themselves). From the furrows armed men spring forth (in the heroic contest over the first agrarian law the heroes come forth from their estates to assert their lordship of them, and unite in arms against the plebs, and they fight not among themselves but with the clients that have revolted against them; the furrows signifying the orders in which they unite and thereby give form and stability to the first cities on the basis of arms, as is all set forth above). And Cadmus is changed into a serpent (signifying the origins of the authority of the aristocratic senates, for which the ancient Latins would have used the phrase Cadmus fundus factus est, and the Greeks said Cadmus was changed into Draco, the dragon that wrote the laws in blood), All of which is what we promised to make clear: that the fable of Cadmus contained several centuries of poetic history and is a grand example of the inarticulateness with which the still infant world labored to express itself, which is one of the seven great sources of the difficulty of the fables. So easy it was for Cadmus to leave a writ ten record of this history in the vulgar characters which he brought to the Greeks from Phoenicia! And Desiderius Erasmus, with a thousand absurdities unworthy of the learned man who was called the Christian Varro, will have it that [the fable] contains the story of the invention of letters by Cadmus. Thus the illustrious history of such a great benefit to the nations of the invention of letters, which must have made itself known far and wide, is concealed by Cadmus from the human race in Greece under the veil of this fable, which remained obscure down to the time of Erasmus, in order to keep hidden from the vulgar such a great invention of vulgar wisdom that from the vulgar these letters received the name of vulgar letters! (257-58) The poetic genealogies of Cadmus contain the death and resurrection, the vulgar wake of cultural bodies, and jurisprudence. Vico clearly associates sowing the serpent's teeth with plowing furrows, which, in turn, establishes stability for new civilizations and the laws of the land. The fact that Vico sees the overall meaning of Cadmus as "a grand example of the inarticulateness with which the still infant world labored to express itself" supports our reading of Finnegans Wake: what better way for Joyce to express the cultural constellation of parenting, violence, law, and the alphabets of his world than to disseminate his semantic field of Cadmus throughout the Wake's, so to speak, "inarticulate" discourse? For Joyce, Vico's understanding of Cadmus's furrows and civil law would only confirm the violence England inflicted on Ireland. Already in Ulysses, Joyce explicitly joins Cadmus and the dragon's teeth with the violence of Irish politics. In the midst of Dublin burn ing, "[i]t rains dragons' teeth Armed heroes spring upfromfunows"(U TIT :.'</page><page sequence="5">15.4680-81). Don Gifford and Robert J. Seidman's gloss on this pas sage explains the historical effect of the Cadmus myth on Irish poli tics, oratory, and jurisprudence: "Walter Hussey Burgh (1742-83), an Irish statesman and orator famous for his 'power of stirring the pas sions/ said in a speech in the Irish Parliament (1779): 'Talk not to me of peace. It is smothered war. England has sown her laws as dragon's teeth, and they have sprung up as armed men.'"5 For their inventive depictions of Cadmus, husbandry, and ser pents, both Vico and Joyce likely rely on ancient Greek tragedies. For example, in Euripides's The Bacchae, Dionysus proclaims, "Next I shall disclose the trials which await this man. You, Cadmus, shall be changed to a serpent, and your wife ... a serpent too/'6 Like the uroboros discourse of the Wake, the poetic history of Cadmus moves from the death of a dragon (Cadmus killing the creature), to the plant ing of dead body parts of a dragon (Cadmus planting the dragon's teeth), to the rebirth of the dragon in different forms (the spartoi), to the slaying of the dragon parts (the five spartoi perform fratricide), to the birth of Thebes, to the horrors of Cadmus's family genealogy, to the transformation of Cadmus himself into a dragon (Draco).7 Joyce's "dragooned peoplades armed to their teeth," with the help of Vico's historical cycles, move "in vicous cicles yet remews the same" (FW 134.05-06, 16-17). Just a brief genealogical survey helps us hear and see Joyce's "Agricultural" writing (FW 86.20-21). Dragons, and Cadmus's Draco in particular, become part of the famous phoenix rebirth structures sown in those "fatal midden" mounds of the Wake's letters (FW 110.25). Joyce; though, does not rely exclusively on classical texts since multiple poetic histories of Cadmus provide significant background knowledge for any reader of the Wake. When Milton describes the ser pent tempting Eve in Paradise Lost, for example, he states, "[P]leasing was his shape,/And lovely never since of Serpent kind/Lovelier, not those that in Illyria chang'd/Hermione and Cadmus."% More signifi cantly in Areopagitica, Milton explicitly connects the myth of Cadmus (Draco) to the dragon's teeth and printing texts: For books are not absolutely dead things, but do contain a potency of life in them to be as active as that soul was whose progeny they are; nay they do preserve as in a vial the purest efficacy and extraction of that living intellect that bred them. I know they are as lively and as vigor ously productive as those fabulous dragon's teeth; and being sown up and down, may chance to spring up armed men. (720, my italics)9 Here the Cadmus myth with its dragon teeth clearly merges with the birth of printed books and emphasizes the militant danger of those productions?all within the context of "being sown up and down" 273</page><page sequence="6">and killing a dragon to obtain its teeth. Printing as a form of parenting might be "vigorously productive," but it is also relentlessly violent. The direct identification of dragons with printing presses them selves becomes even more recognizable in William Blake's The Marriage of Heaven and Hell where hell is portrayed as a printing house: But first the notion that man has a body distinct from his soul is to be expunged; this I shall do by printing in the infernal method, by cor rosives, which in Hell' are salutary and medicinal, melting apparent surfaces away, and displaying the infinite which was hid. ... I was in a Printing house in hell &amp; saw the method in which knowledge is transmitted from generation to generation. In the first chamber was a Dragon Man, clearing away the rubbish from a cave's mouth; within, a number of Dragons were hollowing the cave. ... In the fifth chamber were Unnam'd forms, which cast the metals into the expanse. There they were receiv'd by Men who occupied the sixth chamber, and took the forms of books &amp; were arranged in libraries.10 These dragons not only help explain many references to Blake in the Wake, such as "[m]e seemeth a dragon man" (FW 15.34), but they also move the teeth from Milton and Cadmus into the realm of print. On page 563 of the Wake, Joyce alludes to Blake and, in so doing, makes his own mark on the page: making sharpshape his inscissors on some first choice sweets fished out of the muck_What a teething wretch! How his book of craven imagesl... And he has pipettishly bespilled himself from his foundingpen as illspent from inkinghorn. He is Jem job joy.... to be of the sir Blake tribes bleak. ... Are you not somewhat bulgar with your bowels? ... With pale bloke I write tintingface, .., Donatus his mark. . ., In the ink of his sweat he will find it yet. What Gipsy Devereux vowed to Lylian and why the elm and how the stone. (FW 563.02-21, my italics)11 The incisors, growing up from the teething furrows, have Biblical images engraved on them?like Blake's own plates. In addition, the creator's fountainpen is his "foundingpen," and the author here is James Joyce himself, "jem job joy," printing and writing from his inkpot (in German Tintenfass).ln the midst of these puns and allu sions, Joyce marks the printed text with grammar ("Donatus his mark," according to McHugh, includes a reference to "Donatus: Ars Grammatica"?562&gt;) and includes a printing tale of the origins of the first human father?Adam, who had to work by the sweat of his brow ("In the ink of his sweat he will find it yet"). All these marks are etched in the "bowels'7 of the author (Shem writes on his body using his own bodily excretions), but they are also the vulgar "vowels" of the alphabet from the bowels of the earth. The locus of Blake's "irvfer 274</page><page sequence="7">nal method" of printing by "corrosives" might even be, in the devil ish world of the Wake, one of the places where Shem learns how to print: "this double dye, brought to blood heat, gallic acid on iron ore, through the bowels of his misery . . . the first till last alshemist wrote over every square inch of the only foolscap available, his own body, till by its corrosive sublimation one continuous present tense integu ment slowly unfolded" (FW 185.32-186.01, my italics). Corporeal, bodily, teething, boweled printing corrodes the body of the creator, the creation, and the entire creative process?from foolscaps to etch ings, bitings, and pressmakers. In whatever "salutary" way Blake presents his "corrosives"?to etch his reliefs?Joyce provides other infernal dimensions to the divine gift (including relief from pressure in the bowels). For Joyce, printing books involves forgery, alchemical writing, and the tilling of competing cultures, flesh, and matter: He dug in and dug out by the skill of his tilth [skin of his teeth] for himself and all belonging to him and he sweated his crew beneath his auspice for the living and he urned his dread, that dragon volant,.,. Unfru-Chikda Uru-Wukru [Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker/HCE] and begad he did. . . . wake him and may again when the fiery bird disembers.. . , Have you whines for my wedding, did you bring bride and bedding, will you whoop for my deading is a? Wake? Usqueadbaughaml (FW 24,03-14, my italics except for "Usqueadbaugham") Printing the alphabet is not only a form of husbandry and parenting but is also a means of telling the history of insurrection and resur rection. By the sweat of his brow (biting and printing), by "the skin of his teeth" (Job 19:20?tilling and cultivating), and by the "dragon volant," that which we thought was dead?the Wake itself?just might rise again. In fact, with the phrase "dragon volant," the text suggests that alchemy is necessary for printing to raise the dead. Here HCE (the Wake's father-figure) embodies this magical process for the "alchemical term 'dragon volant,' the 'flying dragon/ refers either to mercury alone, or the union of philosophical sulphur and mercury."12 In the Wake, this dragon takes readers to the Philosopher's Stone, a substance that changes impure metals into pure gold. In addition to being known as a medicine, an elixir, a phoenix, and a ferment, the Philosopher's Stone was a "tincturing agent," according to Barbara DiBemard (3), Once we know, DiBernard notes, that '"[t]incture' was one of the most common names for the Stone" (46), we realize that Draco, the dragon, provides Joyce with teeth for printing and is part of the "sham" (forged and plagiarized) art that Shem the penman cre ates: "how very many piously forged palimpsests slipped in the first place by this morbid process from his pelagiarist pen? . . , [(]tincture . 275</page><page sequence="8">and gin!) Nibs never would have quilled a seriph to sheepskin" (FW 182.02-11, my italics).13 The Wake as an artwork is not only an alchemi cal Philosopher's Stone but also the teeth-stones of print technolo gies, which violently produce new artwork from old. The suffering inflicted on Job ("by the skill of his tilth") and the violence toward the dragon and its body/toward family members (the spartoi), and toward lands and cities echo with each new technological recension and production. Joyce's vision of Biblical graven images, however, includes an aspect of cowardice. The Wake is "his book of craven images," engraved images of grave characters and situations but also cowardly figures who add a truthful dimension to different printed histories. Elsewhere, the Wake even reminds us of a certain cowardice in the people Moses led in the exodus from Egypt: "over the surfers of the glebe whose sway craven minnions had caused to revile, as, too foul for hell, under boiling Mauses' burning brand" (FW 354.11-13, my roman emphases). However loyal Moses was to his people (or however boiling Moses was when he stood before the burning bush), however patriotic the users of Mauser Rifles were in the Easter Rising of 1916, there are still craven images and minions that remain part of history.14 For Joyce, one cannot write a history about Cadmus's effects on culture without addressing creation by destruction and destruction by cultivation. In his "daybook . . . allaphbed" (FW 18.17-18), Joyce fashions dif ferent versions of husbandry to fit his unique semantic field. Out of this field grows a culturally transforming production: Finnegans Wake. For instance, when one figure "hunt[s] down his family ances tors," the text retells the mythic tale of throwing "pebblets for luck over one sodden shoulder and dragooned peoplades armed to their teeth" (FW 134.03, 04-06, my italics). Not wanting to plant just one tooth, so to speak, and demonstrating how violence and cultural upheaval accompany tilled bones, pebbles, and letters, Joyce sows his textual alphabetic grounds with a variety of mythic figures. According to R. J. Schork, for example, the "dominant element [in the Wake's 'dragooned peoplades'] derives from the Jason-Medea tale. So that he could safely approach the shrine of the Golden Fleece, Medea instructed Jason to sow 'dragons' teeth'... on the open field. From them, she promised, would miraculously spring a fully armed population of siblings who would slaughter one another while he made off with his booty."15 Buried in the letters of the Wake are both Jason, who sows "the teeth'of a terrible serpent which give rise to a crop like in body to armed war riors,"16 and Cadmus, who, as we have seen, sows the dragon's "teeth in the furrows deep, at unmothered Pallas' bidding./Then earth sent up armed terror over its surface," as described by Euripides.17 Ovid also observes that "after opening up furrows with his deep-cutting plough, [Cadmus] scattered the teeth on the ground .. . [as] seeds to 276 :</page><page sequence="9">produce men."18 When analyzing different versions of sowing and parenting, we glimpse the historical effects these kinds of plantings produce: Cadmus and the five spartoi undertake the founding of a culture, Thebes. Joyce does not want us to distinguish Cadmus's parenting of the spartoi from either the cultivation of culture or the destructive effects that culture produces. It is no surprise then that earthly matter (autochthonous birth) has associated roots for the word "matrix" (from "mater"); in fact, the matrix is the name of one part of the printing press where letters are formed. Milton's people books, printing, and dragon-men are all born without a mother (or "mater"), just like Adam and the dragon's teeth.19 Printing gives birth without a human mother's body, or, as the Wake states the case, "as no man of woman born" (FW 79.08-09). Moreover, we can associate the lack of a mother with violence once we realize that this Wakean phrase echoes the scene of the bloody child apparition in Macbeth, with the prediction "for none of woman born /Shall harm Macbeth."20 These Shakespearean lines refer to Macduff, who "was from his mother's womb/Untimely ripp'd" (V. viii.15-16).21 The elision of human motherhood turns out to provide but one economy for Joyce's use of "matrix" in different contexts of produc tion. In episode 14 of Ulysses, for example, we encounter "the pre mature relentment of the amniotic fluid (as exemplified in the actual case) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix, artificial insemina tion by means of syringes, involution of the womb consequent upon the menopause" (LI 14.968-71). In an episode that mimes the geneal ogy (or birth) of English prose styles (types), this particular passage goes on to discuss rape and delivery The Wake's poetic history draws additional attention to the ways that cultivating teeth and parenting letters can lead to violent patriarchal cultures. Joyce's poetic history of Cadmus's "fathering" (growing teeth without a human mother) emphasizes the importance of the soil, let ters, and violence necessary for a culture's growth. The Latin cidter (ploughshare) and the Latin cultus (to till), for Joyce, are but parts (or "allforabit[s]") of the Phoenician and Hellenic genealogy of Cadmus, who is reputed, after all, to have brought the alphabet to Greece, A A, C. Moorhouse observes, "In Herodotus, letters are called Cadmeai or Phoenician: and Cadmus was a mythical Greek who was said t have lived in Phoenicia and to have brought the alphabet back to Greece."22 Robert Graves refers to "the Pelasgian alphabet, which Cadmus later brought back to Boeotia" and to "Nicostrate .,. [who] adapted the thirteen-consonant Pelasgian alphabet, which Cadmus had brought back from Egypt" (182, 137). And Thomas Bulfinch notes, "There is a tradition that Cadmus introduced into Greece the letters of the alphabet which were invented by the Phoenicians. This 277 ".;':</page><page sequence="10">is alluded to by Byron, where, addressing the modern Greeks, he says: 'You have the letter Cadmus gave,/Think you he meant them for a slave?'" (79)P Joyce indicates an interest in these myths in his 1907 essay "Ireland, Island of Saints and Sages," in which he asserts that the Irish "language is oriental in origin, and has been identified by many philologists with the ancient language of the Phoenicians . . . [who] established in Ireland a civilization that had decayed and almost disappeared before the first Greek historian took pen in hand" (CW 156). For the Wake, the early technologies of communication? tilling, civilizing, cultivation, and the taking of pen in hand?all pre figure the printing of teeth in the furrows of the Wake's "latterpress" languages (FW 356.21). The Wake's "dragooned peoplades armed to their teeth" are the people who grow from the dragon's teeth, but they are also interpreters (each is a dragoman /dragon-man), because they are the letters of the Wake's alphabet. Joyce lines up his "dra gooned peoplades" in the furrowed matrix of earth, in rows of letters on a vellum, in parts of printing presses, and in the teeth of mouths. In the Wake, the threat of violence not only accompanies printing, but, indeed, any "indenting" or "biting" during printing necessarily creates errors and "indentured" histories.24 The more we read the Wake, the more we realize that dents of all kinds?from teeth to con tracts?can even kill.25 As the Wake states, "[hjopsoloosely kidding you are totether with your cadenus and goat along nose how we shall complete that white paper. ... Be trouz and wholetrouz!" (FW 413.27 30, my italics). The legal oath of "[b]e trouz and wholetrouz" ("the truth, the whole truth") cannot be separated from the "[hjopsoloosely kidding" ("absolutely killing") words on the paper.26 For Joyce, a written or printed contract (indenture) has a history of killing ("kid ding") dents. Joyce's poetic history of the Cadmus myth and, what I will call at his point, dented printing helps explain much of the background toise throughout the Wake: just as in the seventh episode of Ulysses, here are printing machines working overtime in the Wake. The sound of the printing press, the teeth on vellum ("vellatooth"), the tree on stone, the Blakean "tintingface," and the question of "how we shall complete that white paper" bring us all the way to the early pages of the Wake and Gutenberg: "A bone, a pebble, a ramskin; chip them . . . and Gutenmorg with his cromagnom charter, tintingfast and great primer must once , ?. step rubrickredd out of the wordpress... . For that... is what papyr is meed of, made of, hides and hints and misses in prints.... the book of Doublends Jined" (FW 20.05-16, my italics).27 Here the echo of "tintingface" in "tintingfast" suggests that James Joyce, who learned so much about the dragon's printing teeth (and alchemical tincture) from Cadmus, Milton, and Blake, refigures him self as a new kind of Gutenberg?waking a new Gutenberg Galaxy ' 27? .' '</page><page sequence="11">(so to speak) with the publication of the Wake's "wordpress." As the Wake grows "furrowards, bagawards ... of an allforabit," backward bags of words and alphabetical bits from diverse cultures, past and present, we "learn from that ancient tongue to be middle old modern to the minute" (FW 18.32-19.02, 270.17-18, my italics). Even ancient hieroglyphs from "engined Egypsians" are violent bits of the Wake's odds and ends (FW 355.23). For example, when we read "those ars all bellical, the highpriest's hieroglyph of kettletom and oddsbones" (FW 122.07-08, my italics), we encounter hieroglyphics among a god of war (Ares), the Latin art of war ("ars bellica"), and God's bones. In fact, parts of the Wake's discourse come from the Rosetta Stone's divine (the Greek hieros) inscriptions in Egyptian hieroglyphic, Greek, and demotic scripts: "was I not rosetted on two Stellas of little egypt? had not I rockcut readers, hieros, gregos and democriticos?" (FW 551.30-31, my italics). To "read the strangewrote anaglyptics of those shemletters patent for His Christian's Em," we require pieces of the Wake's "explosition," explosions of, and explosive, expositions (FW 419.18-19,11, my italics). The figure of "Cadmus" appears explicitly in the Wake's left-hand column of episode Il.ii, next to the phrase "Should Spelling?" (FW 307.125,25). Recalling Cadmus's contribution of Phoenician letters to the genealogy of the Greek alphabet, this episode also marks contri butions of both Cadmus and Thoth to genealogies of printed alpha bets and to the Wife's own language. Four pages before the name of Cadmus first appears, however, Joyce's complex portmanteau style fashions a toothy penned, printed, oral, stolen manuscript: "Pose the pen, man, way me does. Way ole missa vellatooth fust show me how. Fourth power to her illpogue! Bould strokes for your life! Tip! This is Steal" (FW 303.02-05, my italics). Joyce disseminates "vellatooth fust" throughout Finnegans Wake, printing and sowing revisions of teeth, Cadmus, and the Egyptian god of writing, Thoth, to till and fertilize printing histories with alphabetic agriculture, technological changes, and cultural violence: "chanching letters . . . em in Iropadores . . , thruths ... smilabit.. .trying to undo with his teeth the knots made by his tongue ... how faust of all... with bag from Oxatown... the whole damning letter" (FW 288.01-13, my italics). In addition to recalling famous figures from history (as I discuss below), "faust" in German means "fist." These alphabets thus work by force and farce.28 In rewriting relationships between agriculture and printing and by cultivating the violence of alphabets, teeth, dragons, and print, Joyce traces various histories in which bodily resurrection and tex tual recension converge in the Wake's own book of the dead. What might appear as a dead ("finn") form of signification undergoes a phoenix-like transformation (a "wake"), and reemerges ("begins again") from the dung of the earth to build a new "ambiviolent" 279 " '</page><page sequence="12">culture: "the pharce [farce] ... a setdown secular phoenish [phoe nix/finish]. Bygmester Finnegan .. . piled buildung supra buildung" (FW 518.02, 4.16-27). In the Wake, part of the farce of development, growth, education, creation, and formation of culture?the German word Bildung contains all. of these meanings?is that culture (such as the city of Thebes or the alphabet or the printing press) is built with violence and spilt blood and ink from bodies, dung, and earth. To sow dragon's teeth is to plant seeds bathed in blood; the powder known by printers as "dragon's blood" aids the birthing of lettered progeny, alphabetic bits of "furrowards" and "bagawards" that, as Milton puts it, "being sown up and down, may chance to spring up armed men" (720).29 Earlier, in Joyce's Ulysses, we find that Molly Bloom has "more than once covered a sheet of paper with signs and hieroglyphics which she stated were Greek and Irish and Hebrew characters," and that Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom have a "common study.... [in the] increasing simplification traceable from the Egyptian epigraphic hieroglyphs to the Greek and Roman alphabets and the anticipa tion of modern stenography and telegraphic code in the cuneiform inscriptions (Semitic) and the virgular quinquecostate ogham writing (Celtic)" (U 17.676-78, 769-73, my italics for "traceable"). Finnegans Wake increases the complexity and ambivalence of such traces, as it makes us aware of the violence in changing forms of signification: "Language this allsfare for the loathe of Marses ambiviolent about it" (FW 518.02-03, my italics). In short, Joyce suggests that the cost of lan guage is warfare, ambivalence, and violence. Signifying codes (such as Morse code) may be used for the "love of Moses," but changing scripts and signs includes the god of war, Mars. All is not fair ("alls fare for the loathe") in love and war.30 In addition to tilling teeth to grow people, Joyce?like a farmer's harrow with its sharp teeth breaking the ground*?employs printing presses and print technology to cultivate genealogical histories "of eschatology our book of kills reaches for" (FW 482.33-34, my italics), a book "of kills" that is a deadly form of The Book ofKells?1 Like the five teeth-men (the sown spartoi) who fight and kill one another and join Cadmus to found Thebes, Joyce's printed histories battle each other and establish new and revised forms of culture that are "Mnted at in the eschatalogical chapters of Humphrey's Justesse of the Jaypees and hunted for by Theban recensors who sniff there's something behind the Bug of the Deaf (FW 134.34-36, my italics except for the titles). Here, the printed initials "h e c" help us identify the Wake's father figure, HCE. Indeed, the grouping of these three letters (such as in Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker and Here Comes Everybody) allows Joyce to have his hero appear in different guises and roles. Because the escha tological chapters of HCE deal with the ends of the Wake's patriarch 280 V.'.-. .</page><page sequence="13">("something behind"), the Wake's printing of paternity's ends actually opens the possibility of resurrection ("there's something behind the Book of the Dead"). In the same paragraph as the "dragooned peop lades" of Cadmus, Joyce suggests that there are hints in chapters of last things ("ftinted at in the eschatalogical chapters"): "The Justice of the Peace in Ireland,"32 the Theban censors, and the Thebari recension of the Egyptian Book of the Dead?3 Moreover, since "recensors" echoes the Latin recensere, meaning to review, Joyce's claim here is that any textual editing of dead letters transforms a culture's previous produc tion of the "book"; new technological recension hints at the death of a previous "book" and the publication of a resurrected, changing book?Finnegans Wake.u Joyce forms the textual grounds of his recensions and resurrec tions with alchemical mixtures of ordure and body parts like teeth that move to print: "A bone, a pebble, a ramskin ... and Gutenmorg . .. the wordpress,, . . So you need hardly spell me how every word will be bound over,... But look what you have in your handself! The movibles are scrawling in motions, marching" (FW 20.05-22). The "movibles" are, in part, the movable type of Gutenberg. When tilling mythic prints (and the father HCE)?"to cassay the earthcrust at all of feours, furrowards [furrows, forwards, for words, and so forth], bagawards, like yoxen at the turnpaht, Here say figurines billycoose arming and mounting. Mounting and arming bellicose figurines see here" (FW 18.31-34, my italics)?Joyce's figures create not only spar toi but also inventors, writers, and printers such as Cadmus, Thoth, Gutenberg, Johann Fust, an early German printer, and Joyce himself. Aware that the planting of teeth leads to forms of civilization (mili tary alphabetic, and Theban), we can also observe how Joyce's text often plays with the possible meanings of the Latin culter (plough share) and the Latin cultus (to till); indeed, language and culture come to signify forms of angry husbandry. In the same paragraph as the "dragooned peoplades armed to their teeth," HCE appears to be born from the earth: "freavengendered, chaosfoedted, earthborn; his father presumptively ploughed it deep on overtime and his mother as all evince must have travailled her fair share" (FW 137,14-16, my ital ics). The alphabetical letters that make up bits of the printed father, HCE, are themselves autochthonous,35 To emphasize the patriarchal anger in culture and agriculture, the Wake also presents an "Irish Agricultural" organization36 and a figure who pledges by the tilled word?"And I pledge you my agricultural word" (FW 86.20-21,405.11, my italics), In fact, "after all his autocratic writings,.. thee faroots hoi cullchaw [culture] md" (FW 303.18-21, my italics); the roots of HCE's cultural end return Joyce's poetic history to writing and the printing of what was once Written, Even when the Wake's washerwomen turn into tree 281</page><page sequence="14">and stone, a speaker exclaims, "My branches lofty are taking root. And my cold cher's [culture's/cultures] gone ashley" (FW 213,13-14). The cold chair of culture is partly the French chair or flesh; the Wake's scripted and printing stones are the flesh and words of cultures; and the thrown "pebblets for luck over one sodden shoulder and dra gooned peoplades armed to their teeth" are the printed characters of Finnegans Wake. "All the charictures in the drame!... vellatooth fust" (FW 302.31-303.03): all the characters in Joyce's drama-dream come from previous printed versions of "vellatooth fust." In Joyce's poetic history, printed characters and "vellatooth fust" not only enact a complex merger of "tooth" and Thoth but also dis close the Egyptian deity as one of the Wake's gods of print culture. According to Wallis E. A. Budge's Egyptian Hieroglyphic Dictionary, one of Thoth's titles is "'lord of sacred words/ i.e., of words writ ten in hieroglyphs";37 Joyce rewrites Thoth's mythic proportions by associating the god with printing presses and other (future) forms of expression and communication. To help us understand several of the Thoth and printing implications of cultural production and "vella tooth fust," it should be noted that Finnegans Wake constantly rewrites its author's previous texts. In A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, for example, Stephen Dedalus calls the Egyptian deity "Thoth, the god of writers, writing with a reed upon a tablet" (P 225), and in Ulysses Stephen recalls "Thoth, god of libraries, a birdgod, moonycrowned" (U 9.353). The latter incident takes place when Stephen is in the library revealing his own theories of Hamlet, William Shakespeare, and authorship. A library is not only a locus for manuscripts and printed texts, but it is also a place to "meet with the acquaintance of Mister Typus, Mistress Tope and all the little typtopies" (FW 20.12-13) and to find the dark book of the printed Wake. In the Wake, Joyce advises us that "you need hardly spell me how every word will be bound over to carry three score and ten toptypsical readings throughout the book of Doublends Jined" (20.13-16, my italics). The book may be bound and its ends joined, but its movable types perform Theban recensions ("Theban recensors") of firsts and lasts. When we read Finnegans Wake, "thauthor" (FW452.10)?the author and Thoth?has us listen to the printing of the Wake's own transmog rifying letters: "For we, we have taken our sheet upon her stones where we have hanged our hearts in her trees; and we list, as she bibs us, by the waters of babalong" (FW 103.09-11). As John Paul Riquelme states, Finnegans Wake's "letter is told by the 'elm that whimpers at the top ... [to] the stone that moans when stricken' (94.4-5) .... [the] sheet here ['our sheet upon her stones'] is laundry, but it is also a sheet of paper pressed on stone to print the leaves of the book" (11). The lan guage of printing leaves its cultural imprint, indentations, and marks 282</page><page sequence="15">on laundered sheets. Writing "with a reed upon a tablet" inflicts cultural imprints?teeth marks, so to speak?on the Wake's letters. As the text remarks, "may the treeth we tale of live in stoney" (FW 44.09, my italics); that is, perhaps a truth of the Wife's tales exists in the stony tablet of print ing presses. The mythic assemblage itself produces "[t]he proteiform graph itself [which] is a polyhedron of scripture. There was a time when naif alphabetters would have written it down the tracing of a purely deliquescent recidivist" (FW 107.08-1Q).38 Indeed, just three lines after the "alphabetters," we read about HCE as "the ftardily curiosing mtomophilust . . . with an eye for the goods trooth" (FW 107.12-16, my italics), the god's truth, the good truth; and "[c]loser inspection ... would reveal a multiplicity of personalities inflicted on the documents" (FW 107.23-25, my italics). Joyce wants us to encounter his dynamic of teeth, truth, printing, and letter whenever we observe an infliction of truth in printing. After all, when the Wake discusses "em in tropadores and doublecress ing twofold thruths . . . trying to undo with his teeth ... how faust. . . the whole damning letter" (FW 288.02-13, my italics), "em" refers to a unit of measure of matter in a type set,39 Moreover, in the same episode (Il.ii), the longest footnote (a scripted sign) in the text states, "For tough troth is stronger than fortuitous fiction" (FW 279,f44-45, my italics). In other words, the Wake's "troth" might be stranger (and "stronger") than fiction, but it is a "troth" that has a scribe. This, in turn, depicts Thoth with his reed and tablet: "Go in for scribenery with the satiety of arthurs , ... and inform to the old sniggering publicking press and its nation of sheepcopers about the whole plighty troth" (FW 229.07-09, my italics). Scribes write with, and societies of authors swear by, "the whole plighty troth," the whole bloody truth. With dizzying effects, the Wake presents us with a historical perfor mance of print culture. Joyce enacts the problems of "writings.,, thee faroots hoi cullchaw end" (FW 303.19-21, my italics)?the roots, the printed genealogies of culture?in the actions of writing and printing. When at least one of the children in ILii learns to hold the pen and write ("Pose the pen, man, way me does. Way ole missa vellatooth fust show me how"), Joyce creates a complicated reference to Thoth. We are witnessing the rewriting of Joyce's own Ulysses, in which, as McHugh notes, the "'[o]ld hag with the yellow teeth' [is] Queen Victoria" (303). The passage from Joyce's earlier text prints the royal teeth or "dents": "M. Drumont, famous journalist, Drumont, know what he called queen Victoria? Old hag with the yellow teeth. Vieille ogresse with the dents jaunes" {U 3.230-33). Gifford and Seidman tell us that Edouard Adolphe Drumont was "a French editor and journalist whose newspaper, La Libre Parole (Free Speech), was distinguished chiefly for the bitterness of its anti-Semitism" (55), In the Wake's .../.. 283</page><page sequence="16">rewriting of publishing/printing, the line from Drumont's paper becomes, comically, a form of "yellow" journalism.40 Moreover, the Wake's "missa vellatooth fust" marks its own yellow coloring and tex ture. "Fust" comes from "fusto," the word for "stick"; "fuster" means a piece of wood; "fustet" comes from "fuste," which is a stick or piece of wood; "fustian" means a cloth made of cotton and flax (but it also means bombastic language); and "fustic" actually refers to a yellow dye extracted from the wood of fustic trees!41 When we encounter the marks of "Thoth" in "vellatooth," we meet the posing of a pen, Shem the penman, and the figure who is first, or "fust," to show the speaker how to write: Thoth.42 Just seven lines before "Pose the pen," Joyce alludes to printing his own writing: "Two dies of one rafflement. Eche bennyache. Outstamp and distribute him at the expanse of his society. To be continued. Anon" (FW 302.27-30, my italics). These lines rewrite the young Joyce's 1901 essay "The Day of the Rabblement" (CW 68-72); there are two, each for one penny, but the phrase also suggests Joyce's book of verses Pomes Penyeach, pub lished by Shakespeare and Company in Paris in 1927. The printing references are even more conspicuous since "[o]utstamp" echoes the Italian "stampare: to print," as McHugh notes (302). The Wake's few words in this "vellatooth fust" context are exceed ingly rich with meaning. First of all, "fust," in the context of posing a pen and being the first to show the speaker how to write, names Fust, the early printer who has, fittingly for Joyce, a mixed genealogical his tory with another famous printer whose first name is Johann: Johann Gutenberg. The history of movable type associated with Gutenberg actually contains a fascinating narrative of two Johanns (for instance, Fust financed Gutenberg's early printing press); moreover, Fust him self was notoriously confused (due, in part, to his printed name) with the famous Johann Faust. Part of Gutenberg's own history is, in fact, quite relevant to the story of the two Johanns. According to Gifford and Seidman, "Johannes Gutenberg (1397-1468) was the German who received disputed credit for the invention of printing with mov able type. It is notable . . . that Gutenberg, the son of Gensfleisch, assumed his mother's name" (324). Such ancestral genealogies play right into Joyce's questioning of the proverbial wisdom about origins and ancestors. This mixing of names and associations, along with Joyce's history of problems with his own publishing, and the fact that Ulysses, as Hugh Kenner notes, "was set in type the Gutenberg way, by hand," adds to the force of "fust" in the Wake.43 Joyce's history of the force (and the firsts) of printing empowers Thoth's letter of the "vellatooth," forcing us further underground, into caves and mouths. Specifically, we have reentered Joyce's nuanced rewriting of the ancient Cadmus myth?a myth of ancestry, genealogy/fathering, and language. The stone and wood of Fust's "284 : ' '</page><page sequence="17">(and Gutenberg's) printing press, in the Wake, become the teeth that mark the sheets of "vella" or vellum. The words "bite" and "biting" are printing terms, and indentations on "vella" come from "dent"? one of the etymological (genealogical) "roots" for "tooth/teeth." "Bite" as both a verb and a noun refers to printing and etching; for example, Blake scholars often use the word "bite" to refer to one of the processes by which Blake created his printed/etched texts.44 Certain printing presses?those which printed sheets by means of tree (wood) and stone?actually had parts named "Head," "Cheek," "Rib," "Feet," "Girth," and so forth (see Figure 1), and books too are frequently said to have bodies.45 As with many of the tooth/tongue/ dragon references in the Wake, the notion of "teeth" becomes part of the "face" of a printing press, not to mention the multiple identities of Thoth. Moreover, the long list of possible etymological genealogies of "teeth/tooth" in the Oxford English Dictionary includes many spellings and sounds, such as "toth," "tothe," "tuth," "thothe," and "touth," that are remarkably similar to the numerous spellings and sounds of Thoth/Theuth listed in Budge's monumental works on Egyptian myths.46 In addition, the Egyptian Book of Opening the Mouth,47 as the title suggests, merges many of these issues with the different roles of Thoth as scribe and god of the word. For example, among the numer ous listings naming Thoth in the Egyptian Hieroglyphic Dictionary, Budge notes that Thoth is "'lord of sacred words,' i.e., of words writ ten in hieroglyphs" and "lord of the divine Word,"; also, Thoth is associated with "the ceremony of 'opening the mouth' of the deceased .., the successful 'opening the mouth' of those who are in heaven ., . the book or service of the 'opening the mouth'" (Dictionary 361, 886, 161).48 Thoth, the god of writing, becomes for Joyce a powerful agent able to open the mouth, to hear and see the teeth of the word, as well as the movable types of Gutenberg's and Fust's printing press.49 But what about the other five letters in "vellatooth"? "Vella" itself succinctly mixes orality (literally and culturally) with the written and the printed. "Vellum" is a kind of parchment from the skins of ani mals (often calves, lambs, or kids); "velum" is a screen or protection or a curtain or veil; and "velum" in anatomy refers to the soft palate of the mouth,50 "Vela," the plural form of "velum," leaves its mark on the Wake's "missa vellatooth" not only to suggest teeth (or dents) and parchment paper for printing but also "missa"?otherwise known as "mss," a commonplace abbreviation for "manuscripts." Finnegans Wake brings all of these meanings together when Joyce writes, "A bone, a pebble, zramskin ., . Gutenmorg .., the wordpress ... what papyr is meed of, made of, hides and hints and misses in prints ..,, Mister Typus, Mistress Tope and all the little typtopies" (my italics).51 The mechanical reproduction of words presses out entire types of family that are as movable as bits of bodies. In addition, with "every . ' : 285</page><page sequence="18">splurge on the vellum ... worth a billion a bite" (FW 179.30-35, my ital ics), a bit or bite of the Wake's alphabetically and agriculturally sown characters (spartoi) make their mark on Joyce's typeface: "furrowards, bagawards_Face at the eased! OI fay! Face at the waist! [east and west] Ho, you fie! Upwap and dump em, tface to n&lt; ace! . .. grow to use of an allforabit" (FW 18.32-19.02, my italics). The typeface actually calls attention to itself when the typed faces are "face to face." The manner in which Joyce produces poetic history from his typed alphabetical earth (instead of a mother's body) correlates with the manner in which the Wake prints on vellum. Elsewhere in the Wake, we find a narrator who has "gaddered togodder the odds docence of his vellumes, gresk, letton . . . and sat about his widerproof" (FW 155.26-29, my italics); echoing the odds and ends (bones) of "hiero glyph .., oddsbones," this figure gathers together the teachings of his volumes/vellums?the voices of Greek, Latin, and other languages.52 Orality and vellum?or speech and writing?reappear together in the Wake in "not one pronouncable teerm that blows in all the Valiums" and "a speechreading from his miniated vellum, alfi byrni gamman . . . Papyroy" (FW 478.11-12, 568.31-34, my italics). In the last refer ence, Joyce conjoins vellum with letters of the alphabet (alpha, beta, gamma, and the like) and papyrus. Even the early English printer William Caxton appears when, on the same page as "scribenery ... arthurs . . -. press .. . plighty troth," a figure is "reading off his flesh skin and writing with his quillbone . . . Caxton and Pollock, a most moraculous jeeremyhead sindbook for all the peoples" (FW 229.30 32). Here, printing and paternity miraculously conjoin, for among other figurations, the "moraculous" Jeremiad "sindbook" is none other than Finnegans Wake itself, and the printing discourse echoes the mythic brothers Castor and Pollux as well as slang terms for penis (quille and bone); in this sense, the word "lifewand" also refers to the male sex organ (FW 195.05). During the printing process/the figure reads "off his fleshskin," his foreskin, and writes with his penis. As we have seen, one of the "allforabit" discourses (or "vellumes") of the "engined Egypsians" is the Egyptian Book of the Dead, which prominently features the god Thoth. The Wake incorporates the "Book of Breathings" that is, according to McHugh, "a funeral ritual in the Egyptian Book of the Dead" (410), but it is also "the book of breedings" (FW 410.01-02). The printed text parents itself, its commentaries, its offspring, and its readings. Thus, in the middle of a section full of allusions to the Book of the Dead, we find the marks of Thoth, truth, Thebes, and the Theban recension embedded in the claim that "it is a veriest throth as the thieves' rescension" (FW 410.36-411.01, my italics). Echoing HCE's end chapters, "Mnted at in the ?schatological chapters . , .hunted for by Theban recensors . .. the Bug of the Deaf (FW 134.34-36, my italics for "h," "c/' and "e")?with the printed ital ics part of Joyce's text?here, on p. 410, a "veriest throth" Thoth joins 286</page><page sequence="19">Theban thieves to edit and scribe this very Book of the Dead. The bizarre style of Joyce's poetic history of recension makes things impossible to pin down with complete accuracy A tilled figure in the Wake moves in the cycles of presses, changing yet retaining an echo of previous representations. Whether we are trying to detect Cadmus, Thoth, Gutenberg, or Joyce, any such figure "moves in vicons cicles yet remews the same" (FW 134.16-17, my italics). Even previous forms of Finnegans Wake, which, during initial stages of writing, Joyce called "Work in Progress," enter these "vicous" cycles: Our wholemole millwheeling u/cociclometer . . , smeltingwrb expro gressive process, (for the farmer, his son and their homely codes, known as eggburst, eggblend, ^ggburial and /zatch-as-hatch can) receives elements ... of subsequent recombination so that the /zeroticisms, catas trophes and eccentricities transmitted by the ancient /egacy of the past, type by tope, letter from litter, word at ward, with sendence of Sundance ... as sure as herself pits hen to paper and there's scribings scrawled on eggs. (FW 614.27-615.10, my italics)53 The ancient question of etiology, "what came first, the chicken or the egg?" and modern engines of technology "recombine" to question the relationship between printing letters (HCE) and reproduction. The cycles of generation, from birth to death to rebirth, contain agricul tural codes. However, the "scribings" and printed histories of those cycles (Herodotus, the Greek historian/appears in "heroticisms") contain transfigurations, catastrophes, eccentricities, and worlds at war. Like the violence of the spartoi, Joyce's violent process of histori cal printing forces its teeth into cultural documents. Many of those cultural documents are deeply inscribed by the figure of Thoth. Even when Joyce has us listen to Thoth's record ings on a phonograph, he plays with indentations and bitings. When "just thinking like thauthor ... pricking up ears to my phono on the ground and picking up airs from th'othex over th'ether" (FW 452.10 13, my italics), "thauthor" might be referring to airwaves and radio technology; however, in order to make a recording on an old 78-rpm record, a needle must "bite" into the record's furrows. Without such infernal markings and engravings, there would be no sound. Within the Wake's complex histories of recension and printing, the text even prints in its "furrowards" a decree that we must remember the tales of writing and Thoth: "Tholedoth, treetrene! Zokrahsing, stone! Arty reminiscensitive" (FW 230.26-27), In Hebrew, the "Tholedoth/' the histories, the tales of "treetrene," must be "reminiscensitive" of the stone; indeed, "Zokrahsing" contains the Hebrew word Zokhar, to remember ("remembering"). However/the ''Tholedoth" are also "oled" tales told ("Tholed") and written by "Th,.. oth," Joyce under 287</page><page sequence="20">scores Thoth's genealogy by ending this "Tholedoth" paragraph with a description of the figure's hovel: "Ones propsperups treed, now sfohong baroque. And oil paint use a pumme if yell trace me there title to where was a hovel not a havel (the first rattle of his juniverse) with a trngtumtinglmg and a next, next and next... while itch ish shome" (FW 230.35-231.04, my italics).54 And just in case we do not see and hear all the "missa vellatooth" printings, the Wake continues with "[h]is mouthfull of ecstasy ... up through the errorooth of his wisdom" (FW 231.09-11, my italics). The root ("rooth") of proverbial wisdom comes from the wisdom tooth ("[t]ooth of his wisdom"), which is filled with "error" for the tooth/printings include mistakes along with the indentations and bitings. But we can also hear an echo of Stephen Dedalus saying in Ulysses, "A man of genius makes no mis takes. His errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery" (U 9.228-29).55 Indeed, just a few moments later, Stephen thinks of none other than "Thoth, god of libraries, a birdgod, moony crowned. And I heard the voice of that Egyptian highpriest. In painted chambers loaded with tilebooks" (IT 9.353-55).56 With partial knowledge of teeth, vellum, printing, Cadmus, and Thoth, we can better appreciate how the textual (and textile) weav ings?the shuttling to and fro in Finnegans Wake?transmogrify into type moving in printing presses (between wood and stone) and the very book (and leaves/pages) of the Wake. In the same paragraph that we learn about Shem's "alphybettyformed verbage/' we encounter "upset latten tintacks [syntax], unused mill and stumpling stones, twisted quills . . . unquestionable issue papers, seedy ejaculations, . . . spilt ink . .. tress clippings from right, lift and cintrum, worms of snot, toothsome pickings . . . borrowed plumes [pens], relaxable hand grips ... deoxodised carbons . ... gloss teeth for a tooth, war moans . . . upheavals distortions, inversions of all this chambermade music ... writing the mystery [history] of himsel in furniture" (FW 183.13, 183.20-184.10, my italics). The distortions and inversions of Joyce's history of textuality (including his own published Chamber Music) include using the stones of the earth to print characters who battle each other in the furrows of cultural upheaval. The Wake's alphabetical teeth echo the Greek boustrephedon; McHugh writes, "[TJurning like oxen in ploughing: writing with lines read left right, then right-left" (18). The words move in furrows, "furrowards, bagawards, like yoxen at the turnpaht. Here say figurines billycoose arming and mounting. Moimting and arming bellicose figurines see here." Unlike clean and calm movement, the Wake's ploughing of culture causes us to see and hear blood as spilled ink and printer's ink itself (with its dragon teeth) as shed blood. Bits of alphabets ("allforabit") are aggressive bites from sown teeth and moving types, such as "alphabz'tes" and "alphabeafer" (FW 553.02, my italics).57 Once ' '-' -288;-. ..;</page><page sequence="21">we perceive the power of Thoth and Cadmus in the Wake's printing stones and moving "alphabites," we can better understand why, in the language of the Wake, "[o]nly is order othered" (FW 613.13-14). For Joyce, writing and printing are never entirely abstract or ethe real ("picking up airs from th'other") but are cultivated from the cre ator's body. In the famous passage describing the alchemical process of writing, Shem uses his own body: "the first till last alshemist wrote over every square inch of the only foolscap available, his own body, till by its corrosive sublimation one ... integument slowly unfolded" (my italics). The word "till" means not only "until" but?in our con text of husbandry, teeth, parenting, and printing?it also means the printing press's "till" and tilling soiled furrows, for "when the call comes, he shall produce nichthemerically from his unheavenly body a no uncertain quantity of obscene matter not protected by copri right" (FW 185.28-30), The body's unheavenly productions till anc bite with corrosive sublimation, reproducing matter without a humai mother's body The paragraph immediately prior to this alchemica description refers us back to the Bible: "Lingua mea calamus scriba^ velociter scribentis" (FW 185.22) ("My tongue is the pen of a scribe writing swiftly [or, a ready scribe]") (Psalm 45:2). The writer's tongue may be Thoth's reed, but the mouth is only one place of writing, printing, and creation. By tilling, and by reproducing disruptive links among genealogical furrows of indented poets and bits of alphabets, Joyce's poetic history documents and performs the effects of Thoth, Cadmus, and Gutenberg on print culture in general and on Joyce's continually constructing offspring, Finnegans Wake.

Arrowsmith's translation, however, equates two different Greek words for "serpent." "Cadmus's" (Spaxuv) transliterates into "Draco's," whereas "Harmonia's" (60?os) is a different word meaning snake or serpent. 7 Vico's claim that "the Greeks said Cadmus was changed into Draco, the dragon that wrote the laws in blood" echoes in the Wake's phrase "orients by way of Sagittarius towards Draco on the Lour" (FW 343.01-02). Here/Draco is both the "Athenian lawgiver [and the] constellation [that] lies between the Dipper and Sagittarius," according to Roland McHugh, in Annotations to "Finnegans Wake," rev. ed. (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 1991), p. 343. Further references will be cited parenthetically in the text. 8 John Milton, Paradise Lost, Complete Poems and Major Prose, ed. Merritt Y.

Further Milton refer ences will be cited parenthetically in the text to this collection. 9 In the same paragraph, Milton goes on to say, "Many a good man lives a burden to the earth; but a good book is the precious lifeblood of a master spirit, embalmed and treasured up on purpose to a life beyond life" (p. 720). For the Milton works in Joyce's library, see Michael Patrick Gillespie, with Erik Bradford Stocker, James Joyce's Trieste Library: A Catalogue of Materials at the Hany Ransom Research Center (Austin: Univ. of Texas Press, 1986), pp. 166-67. See also Patrick Colm Hogan's Joyce, Milton, and the Theory of Influence (Gainesville: Univ. Press of Florida, 1995), for a detailed examination of Joyce and Milton. As Hogan puts it, "'Areopagitica' is one of the earliest defenses of a free press, and remains one of the most powerful. Joyce no doubt read this work and appreciated it?perhaps increasingly as with time he was repeat edly subjected to censorship himself" (p. 68). 10 William Blake, The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, intro. Sir Geoffrey Keynes (London: Oxford Univ, Press, 1975), p. xxii. The Printing House pas sage comes from Plates 14 and 15 in this work (also see pp. xxkxxii). In his 1912 essay "William Blake," Joyce asserts that "[a]rmed with this two-edged sword, the art of Michelangelo and the revelations of [Emanuel] Swedenborg, Blake killed the dragon of experience and natural wisdom, and, by minimiz ing space and time and denying the existence of memory and the senses, he tried to paint his works on the void of the divine bosom" (CW 222). As I discuss below, Blake figures prominently in the Wake as printer, artist, and creator. For information on Blake and printmaking, see Robert E. Essick's William Blake Printmaker (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1980), and Joseph Viscomi's Blake and the Idea of the Book (Princeton: Princeton Univ.

C Moorhouse, The Triumph of the Alphabet: A History of Writing (New York: Henry Schuman, 1953), p. 127. Herodotus goes so far as to claim that the "Phoenicians who came with Cadmus . ... introduced into Greece, after their settlement in the country, a number of accomplishments, of which the most important was writing, an art till then, I think, unknown to the Greeks" (p. 361). 23 See also the "Cadmus" entry in the eleventh edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica. 24 Readers of Joyce's Dubliners will recall that, in the short story "Grace," Mr. Kernan bites off part of his tongue. Joyce represents Kernan's speech by ' ." 291 :</page><page sequence="24">deleting parts of words on the printed page. 25 Joyce is well aware of the violence that dents/teeth can inflict. In fact, in terms of the letters of the alphabet themselves being linked with violence, if we keep in mind that the Hebrew letter "shin" can mean "teeth," we can "till" an additional semantic field from the following lines in the Wake: "?No, he had his teeth in the back of his head. -Did Box then try to shine his puss? -No but Cox did to shin the punman" (FW 517.16-18, my italics). The figure can not speak because he is in the process of biting the other figure's head! This violent biting recalls Ugolino digging his teeth into another sinner's head in Dante's Inferno, trans. Allan Mandelbaum (New York: Bantam Classic, 1982), Cantos 32 and 33, pp. 292-309. 26 The word "totether," as a reference to "Thoth," finds support in "thauthor . . . th'other over th'ether" (FW 452,10-13), In this "white paper" and Thoth context, "Cadmus" lurks in the spelling and sound of "cadenus." One of the echoes here is from Jonathan Swift. McHugh laconically notes, "Vanessa to Swift: 'those killing, killing words of yours'; Swift: Cadenus &amp; Vanessa (anagram for Decanus = Dean)" (p. 413). In A Tale of a Tub, Gulliver's Travels and Other Writings, ed. Louis A. Landa (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1960), p. 279, Swift also writes "that books [are] the children of the brain." Additionally, in Greek mythology, a "caduceus" is a herald's staff with two serpents twined around it (often carried by Hermes, a Greek counterpart for Thoth). In a sense, Cadmus and his wife Harmonia become part of the poetic history of the "cadenus"'s two serpents. In his Greek and Hellenic Culture in Joyce (Gainesville: Univ. Press of Florida, 1998), p. 3, Schork even includes Harmonia in the Wake's Cadmean alphabet: "Shaun requires his brother to 'harmonise your abecedeed responses' (FW 140.14). That request converts the name of Cadmus's wife, Harmonia, into a verb, the object of which is his greatest gift to the prehistoric Greeks, the alphabet." 27 See lohn Paul Riquelme's reading of these lines in his Teller and Tale in Joyce's Fiction: Oscillating Perspectives (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 1983), pp. 15-19. Further references will be cited parenthetically in the text. 28 Even Dante Alighieri, the creator of The Divine Comedy, comes under the Wake's serpentine and toothy farcical force: "the divine comic Denti Alliga tor" (FW. 440.06). 29 The Oxford English Dictionary, 1st ed? indicates that dragon's blood is a "bright red gum or resin, an exudation upon the fruit of a palm, Calamus Draco ...[:] 'That substance which the Apothecaries call Sanguis Draconis"' (a 1599 example), 30 Elsewhere the Wake asserts that the "war is in words and the wood is the world" (FW 98.34-35). The "wood" is the "world" since letters of the Irish alphabet refer to names of trees. 31 Finnegans Wake makes many allusions to The Book ofKells and the beauti ful Irish calligraphy within that text?see Atherton (pp. 19,62,63,64-67,104). Joyce and many Joyceans have compared the two works, As Joseph Campbell and Henry Morton Robinson write, in A Skeleton Key to "Finnegans Wake" (1944; New York: Penguin Books, 1986), p. 103, pages 119-23 of Finnegans Wake "parody the language of Sir Edward Sullivan's description and analysis of tine Book of Kelts ... a magnificently illuminated 6th or 9th century Irish Psalter, [which] was buried, like our letter [in the Wake], to protect it from, the invading Danes, and was dug up again, centuries later, very badly dam 292.</page><page sequence="25">aged." 32 According to McHugh (p. 134), this refers to Henry Humphreys's The Justice of the Peace for Ireland (Dublin: Hodges, Figgis, 1890). 33 Wallis E. A. Budge, trans., The Egyptian Book of the Dead (London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner, 1909), 34 In The Battle of the Books, Gulliver's Travels and Other Writings (p, 369), Swift also writes about battles in which books kill: "There came a vast body of dragoons, of different nations, under the leading of Harvey, their great aga, part armed with scythes, the weapons of death; part with lances and long knives, all steeped in poison; part shot bullets of a most malignant nature, and used white powder which infallibly killed without report." See notes 25 and 26 above. 35 If printed types, spartoi, and sons, in the Wake, are autochthonous, then Joyce needs to print "the sowns of his loins/' the sons that are "sown" in "plein language" (FW 333.28-29,27). Joyce's printed language not only plays with "plain" (open or clear) language but "plain" (level expanse) fields of land. The entire Wake prints furrows in the lines of its pages. 36 The phrase includes a reference to the Irish "Agricultural Organisatior Society founded by Sir Horace Plunkett," as noted by McHugh (p. 86). 37 Budge, Egyptian Hieroglyphic Dictionary (London: John Murray, 1920), p. 361. Further references will be cited parenthetically in the text as Dictionary, 38 The Wake's "proteiform graph" reinforces Joyce's history of printing Cadmus into the lines/furrows of the Wake, Joyce's discourse is the "graph plot" of all stories (FW 284.07). His "graph" is the "plot," the story, of the "plot" of land in which the "graph" dies; the story (plot) then, as we know, becomes graphically planted, grown, tilled, and parented. 39 "Em" is a term for "the body size of the type concerned. ... the em is not a particular measurement but varies with the body," according to Philip Gaskell, in A Neiv Introduction to Bibliography (New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1972), p. 45. 40 According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the term comes from th yellow ink used in printing the "Yellow Kid" cartoon series in the New Yc World newspaper. 41 See the Oxford English Dictionary for more histories of all these semant fields, The punning references to wood reinforce the Wake's moving an mechanical wood and stone printing presses. 42 In terms of the marginal comment next to "Pose the pen"?that is "ACCORDING TO COCKER" (FW 303r), McHugh notes a reference tc "Edward Cocker: Arithmetick (whence phrase 'according to Cocker')" (p. 303). In general, I add that Thoth is a mythic inventor of math as well as writing. Even Plato/in Phaedrus,The Dialogues of Plato, trans. Benjamin Jowett (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1953), 275c-d, has Socrates say, "Theuth .., . was the first to invent mathematics, geometry." In addition to the fact that this episode contains so many mathematical references, the paragraph prior to "vellatooth" includes "me elementator joyclid" (FW 302.12)?that is, Euclid's Elements of Geometry, Indeed, a mythic (reed-written) understanding of math ematics in the Wake may be more important than it might first appear, for when Joyce himself was considering having someone write an introduction to Tales Told of Shem andShaan (an early version of part of Finnegans Wake), he "proposed C K Ogden.., /[Joyce] wished also for Ogden to comment, as a mathematician, upon the structure of Finnegans Wake, which he insisted was ; 293</page><page sequence="26">mathematical" (JJII 614). 43 Hugh Kenner, "An Insane Assault on Chaos," New York Times Book Review (22 June 1980), 7. Although Kenner's phrase comes from this article, he also has a marvelous retelling of (Joycean) printing/publishing tales in "The Most Beautiful Book," ELH, 48 (Fall 1981), 596-605. For tales about Johann Fust, see Albert Kapr's Johann Gutenberg: The Man and His Invention, trans. Douglas Martin (Brookfield, Vt.: Scolar Press, 1996), especially chapter 7 entitled "The Work of the Books'" (pp. 153-87); Adrian Johns, The Nature of the Book: Print and Knowledge in the Making (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1998), espe cially chapter 5, "Faust and the Pirates" (pp. 324-79); and the articles on Fust, Gutenberg, and printing (as well as typography) in the eleventh edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica. In German, incidentally, the word Gutenberg echoes a different kind of stone: "good mountain." Joyce used Gutenberg in Ulysses in "Murtagh Gutenberg" (LI 12.191). 44 See Savage's definitions of "bite" (p. 52). See also the numerous listings under "bite" and "biting" in the Oxford English Dictionary. 45 See Margreta de Grazia's essay "Imprints: Shakespeare, Gutenberg and Descartes," Alternative Shakespeares, ed. Terence Hawkes (London: Routledge Publishers, 1996), pp. 63-94, for the anthropomorphic quality of typebodies. 46 See Danis Rose's Chapters of Coming Forth by Day (Colchester: A Wake Newsletter Press, 1982), for a plethora of connections between The Book of the Dead and Finnegans Wake. 47 Budge, trans., The Book of Opening the Mouth: The Egyptian Texts with English Translations, 2 vols. (London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner, 1909). 48 See Bishop for detailed information on the funeral rites (pp. 86-125). Also see Budge, Egyptian Hieroglyphic Dictionary (pp. 361, 886). 49 Much of Joyce's fascination with Marcel Jousse's theory of language as gesture Qousse's "le style oral rhthmique") thereby combines with Joyce's poetic history of teeth, Thoth, and printing; in particular, see Jousse's chapter on "Oral Style, A 'Living Press'" in his The Oral Style, trans. Edgard Sienaert and Richard Whitaker (New York: Garland Publishers, 1990), pp. 135-42. According to Jousse, Lorraine Weir notes, in "The Choreography of Gesture: Marcel Jousse and Finnegans Wake," JJQ, 14 (Spring 1977), 316-17, all "speech is a Taryngo-buccal gesture' a gesture involving the muscles of the throat and the cheeks (buccinator muscles). Eating and speaking involve the same set of muscles." The Wake conjoins mandibles, mastication, and the alphabet ("moistened his manducators"?FW 408.02) with mythic figures of print. See the Wake (pp. 107-08) for a discourse on mastication and the alphabet, and on p, 306, the act of chewing (see the Latin "manducabimus"?FW 306.12) is a part of the education of the Wake's children. Educators join mandibles ("manducators") to suggest that children chew their bits (bites) of alphabets of learning. In fact, according to Weir, one "Palestinian expression for the recitation of a Lesson is 'to eat the book/ ... The communicant at Mass thus literally eats the Word" (p. 317). For an analysis of Jousse and Joyce, see Weir, and for recent work on gesture and Jousse in Joyce, see Christy L; Burns, Gestural Politics: Stereotype and Parody in Joyce (New York: State Univ, of New York Press, 2000). Images of moving teeth indicate mouths, but in the Wake, they also suggest moving type and myth. 50 Velum is "the membranous septum extending backwards from the hard palate," according to the Oxford English Dictionary. 51 Although I am focusing on Thoth and printing markshere, I should note 294 ...'</page><page sequence="27">that the syntax, diction, usage, and tone of "[p]ose the pen, man, way me does. Way ole missa vellatooth fust show me how" suggest a kind of printing of language that attempts to capture in sight and orthography the sounds and cadences of different oral cultural vernaculars. In fact, even the gender of the signifier "missa" is not certain; though the next line uses the pronoun "her"? "Fourth power to her illpogue!"?-in the Wake's discourse, "missa" can pos sibly signify both "mister" and "miss." The sounds of Thoth in "tooth" and "missa" also echo in the Wake's "[a]nd say hoothoothoo, ithmuthisthyl His is house of laws" (FW 623.10-11, my italics)* which associate the sounds with the masculine pronoun "his." 52 In the Shelta language, "gresko [means] voice," as noted by McHugh (p. 155). 53 We have already seen the combination of eggs with printing, Thoth, faust, teeth, and letters: "chanching letters ... blending tschemes for em in tro padores and doublecressing twofold thruths and devising tingling tailwords .... smihbit eggways .,. trying to undo with his teeth the knots made by his tongue,... how faust of all... and filthily with bag from Oxatown ... in fine the whole damning letter" (FW 288,01-13, my italics). 54 See Riquelme's chapter "Twists of the Teller's Tale; Finnegans Wake" (pp. 1-47) for clear connections between the furniture of homes and printing presses and inkbpttles. 55 In the context of Odyssean wanderings, it is appropriate to note that "error," etymologically, comes from the Latin "errare," to wander, 56 In the Wake, the colors associated with the Egyptian Book of the Dead (in Stephen's thoughts) are now mixed with the colors Blake uses to form his cre ations. When the dead person comes to be judged before Osiris, Thoth weighs the person's heart and pronounces its merits (or lack thereof). 57 This passage partly explains the following footnote: "Huntler and Pumar's animal alphabites, the first in the world from aab to zoo" (FW 263, fl, my italics). The alphabet, from "A" to "Z" and from alpha ("aa") to omega ("oo"), includes "Huntley &amp; Palmers' alphabet biscuits" according to McHugh (p. 263). As we have seen, mythic creatures provide the "bites" for alphabetic nourishment. The "alphabeater"'s context clearly addresses planting alphabetic characters: "with fairskin book and ruling rod, vein of my vergin page, her chastener ever I did learn my little ana countrymouse in alphabeater cameltemper, from alderbirk to tannenyou, with myraw rattan atter dundrum" (FW 552.36-553*04, my italics). Here the Wake marks alpha, beta, gamma (the Hebrew third consonant, gimmel, also reads as the word for "camel"), and delta with trees such as birch and pine. Indeed, the Irish alphabet has eighteen letters and "runs from A (ailm: elm), B (beith: birch) to T (teithne: furze), [and] U (ur: heath)," as McHugh notes (p. 553), or, as Joyce himself writes to Harriet Shaw Weaver, "The Irish alphabet (ailm, beith, coll, dar etc) is all made up of the names of trees" (LettersI 225-26). The Wake's "alphabeater" trees are growing within violent semantic fields: "raw," rot ten ("rattan"), "temper," and "beater," Indeed, the portmanteau suggests a "beater" of "alpha," which often signifies HCB's wife ALE ...' 295</page><page sequence="28">Check??~~^^^^H ^^^^^^^^ / / H :&lt; - ^I9^^L. ^JBS^C I^K^i 2^w. ^pr Figure.1.
