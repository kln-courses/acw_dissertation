<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANTHROPOMORPHISMS IN ISAIAH 40-55 J. Kenneth Eakins Golden Gate Baptist Seminary Expressions attributing human form (anthropomorphisms) or human feelings (anthropopathisms) to God are widespread in the Old Testament. This is not surprising?indeed it is necessary. Any concept of God, any speech concerning God, is necessarily formulated within the framework of man 's own human experience. To speak of God as a person requires the use, to some degree, of anthro pomorphic language. And Scripture emphasizes the personality of God. "It is not the spiritual nature of God which is the foundation of Old Testament faith. It is his personhood?a personhood which is fully alive, and a life which is fully personal, and which is involuntarily thought of in terms of anthropomorphic language. "x Bevan said that it is impossible to eliminate anthropomorphisms and still retain any idea of God.2 This is certainly true if God is thought of as a personal being. The purpose of this article is to isolate and classify the examples of an thropomorphic terms found in Isaiah 40-55 and to discuss the significance of the prophet's choice of this category of expression. Throughout Isaiah 40-55, the majesty and uniqueness of God is stressed. Infinitely superior to idols and men, Yahweh is totally incomparable. To whom then will you compare me, that I should be like him? says the Holy One. (Isa 40:25, RSV) If any answer were needed to this question it would have to be an emphatic "no one. " It is with some surprise, therefore, that one finds in these chapters an abundance of anthropomorphic expressions. Indeed, this type of termin ology reaches a height in Second Isaiah. While, on the one hand, the prophet states clearly that God is incomparable, on the other hand he compares him repeatedly, in various ways, to man. /. Classification of Terms The anthropomorphic expressions found in Isaiah 40-55 can be divided, somewhat arbitrarily, into four main categories. Although some overlapping in thought occurs, a term will be included in one group only. There are times when it is difficult to decide exactly which expressions should be included. (A) References to Parts of the Human Body. The following parts of the body are used in speaking of the person of God: 1. Hand(s) 40:2; 41:20; 43:13; 45:11, 12; 48:13; 49:2, 22; 50:2, 11; 51:16, 17. In addition, one finds the related terms (40:12); Jilt (40:12); PO* (41:10; 48:13) and D*s!5 (49:16). 2. Arm(s) JIT (40:10, 11; 48:14; 51:5 (twice), 9; 52:10; 53:1. 3. Mouth ? 40:5; 45:23; 48:3; 55:11. 4. Eye(s) P* 43:4; 49:5; 52:8(7). 5. Face 3D 54:8. 6. Bosom P*n 40:11. In addition to these expressions, one reads of the breath 11 of Yahweh in Isaiah 40:7 and notes that God is a 3 in Isaiah 42:1. 47</page><page sequence="2">( ) References to Human Emotions. Some of the words included here are verbs, describing an activity of God, but there is a prominent emotional element underlying this activity. 1. Anger, fury, wrath ?JK 42:25; 48:9; HKJp 42:13; 47:6; 54:8,9; 51:17,20,22. 2. Delight 42:1. 3. Love IHK 43:4; 54:8, 10; 55:3. 4. Pity, Compassion, Mercy 49:10, 13; 54:7, 8, 10; 55:7. 5. Comfort 3 49:13; 51:3 (twice); 51:12; 52:9. (C) References to Human Activity. It is very difficult to select terms for this category. In a very real sense all of God's activity is expressed in anthro pomorphic language. He speaks, leads, works, feeds, carries, et cetera. In all this activity he grows neither faint nor weary (40:28) but he is burdened and wearied by the sins of his people (43:24). A few of the more striking an thropomorphic expressions include these: 1. Sits 10* 40:22. 2. Blows an 40:7; ?1*3 40:24. 3. Holds hand 41:13; 42:6; 45:1. 4. Cries out *1 42:13; &gt;? 42:14. 5. Shouts * 42:13. 6. Gasps and Pants ?| 42:14. (D) Similes and Metaphors. In a number of bold and striking ways the incomparable Yahweh is compared to man. These metaphors and similes, stateo or implied, are not technically anthropomorphisms perhaps, but they butiro strongly that category of language. ? Shepherd HJM 40:11. Also implied in 49:9-11 and possibly in 40:26. 2. King T^O 41:21; 43:15; 44:6. 3. Warrior 42:13; mDriVo r*K 42:13. He also possesses a quiver (49:2) and serves as a rear guard (52:12). 4. Husband 54:5. 5. Father 45:10(Seealso45:11; 50:1; 52:3). 6. Potter 1 * 45:9. 7. Merchant. Implied in 55:1-2. 8. Woman in travail iV* 42:14; 45:10(7). 9. Redeemer Viti 41:14; 43:14; 44:6; 44:24; 47:4; 48:17; 49:26; 54:5; 54:8. See also 43:1; 44:22; 44:23; 48:20; 50:2; 51:10; 52:3; 52:9. 11. The Significance of Anthropomorphic Language in Isaiah 40-55 The prophet who is responsible for these chapters did not use anthropo morphic language because of a primitive or crude concept of religion. The date of his work is about 550 B.C. and reveals a lofty, advanced concept of God and theology. His use of this terminology must be explained in other ways. Isaiah 40-55 is written in superb poetry. The author was a poetic craftsman of great skill. Poets of all ages and cultures have claimed and exercised a freedom of expression not usually permitted to writers of prose. Davidson attributed the prophet 's use of anthropomorphisms to his "highly imagina 48</page><page sequence="3">tive mind and the strength of his religious fervor. "3 According to Muilen burg, "the most revealing feature of the poet 's style is his use of imagery. The predilection of Oriental poetry for visualizing imagery is present to an unusual degree. "4 Although it is reasonable to believe that the poetic character of this work explains partially the marked use of anthropomorphism, there is another factor which is more important. It is to be sought in a consideration of the prophet's task and purpose. In order to generate and sustain realistic hope, Second Isaiah had to proclaim dual, almost paradoxical, truths. The prophet's message to the discouraged and distraught exiles needed to stress the omnipotence and transcendance of God. Yahweh, the prophet said, was not only superior to all deities, but was indeed the only deity that existed and was infinitely greater than all men. At the same time, the nearness and accessibility of God to the people needed emphasis. It was vital for the exiles to hear that God was within their reach. These chapters throb with expectation. Yahweh is near! The time of de liverance is at hand! God is about to intervene in history! With urgency the summons is issued to prepare a way for his approach. The whole section proclaims that God is near. Snaith has observed correctly that "the whole prophecy of Second Isaiah is directed to convincing captive Israel of the nearness of God who is about to rescue him."5 Now this is precisely what anthropomorphic language does. It portrays God as near and accessible. It stresses the reality of God and creates a mood of expectancy. It prevents man from thinking of God as one removed from the arena of human activity and need. Therefore, while Second Isaiah says clearly that Yahweh is near, it is through his use of anthropomorphic terminology that he most effectively communicates the reality of this nearness. The striking similes in chapter 42 illustrate this. Like a man of war, God cries out and shouts. The time of secret planning and stealth is past. The time of battle has arrived. Like a pregnant woman (how bold of the prophet!) the months of waiting are over and labor, which cannot cease, has ensued. The picture given suggests a woman during the late stage of labor?the birth of the child is at hand. Not only is God near in terms of time and space, he is near in terms of relationship. He is the husband and the father and, above all, he is the , the near kinsman. As such he is the one who pays the ransom (43:3) and who avenges Israel (41:14-16; 43:14; 47:1-15). Conclusions The climax of the prophet 's message is reached in chapter 55. With great skill, the concept that God is near and accessible to man has been developed with the use of anthropomorphic language. Now the prophet calls for a de cision, for a response to the invitation of God who stands nearby. Seek the Lord while He may be found, call upon Him while He is near. (Isa 55:6) But the tension which the prophet has held in creative balance throughout his work between the nearness of God and his transcendance is again seen as the prophet immediately reminds his listeners that the ways and thoughts of 49</page><page sequence="4">God are far above those of man (Isa 55:8-9). Only in a later age could this tension be resolved. As a Christian, the writer sees this as occurring in the Incarnation. Eichrodt has said, "the Christian faith has been able to accommodate the recognition of God's spiritual nature without prejudice to his immediacy in religion, because it has its focus in the person of Jesus, and thus possesses an assurance of the personhood of God which is proof against all misinterpretations. "6 This truth has been antici pated by the author of Isaiah 40-55 to the extent that he realized and pro claimed that the majesty and transcendance of God did not imply that he was far removed from the presence of man. In his thought, God was not only near, he was the near kinsman! NOTES 1W. Eichrodt, Theology of the Old Testament (Philadelphia: The Westminster Press, 1961), 1:211 .
