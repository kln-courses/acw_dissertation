<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES THE WANDERER 98: 'WEAL WUNDRUM HEAH WYRMLICUM FAH' IN one of the more recent notes on this line, Kathryn Hume observes that it presents a still unsolved problem: 'The patterning on this wall, "wyrm- licum fah", has always been a puzzle'.' Her suggestion, that the phrase may be no more than 'a vivid response to the effects of storm',2 is not particularly convincing, but it is further evidence that many critics have discerned beneath the striking phrase a precise imaginative concept which they cannot recreate and interpret satisfactorily. Most editors of the text offer a suggestion for the interpretation of the line. The note on the passage in Sweet's Anglo-Saxon Reader translates wyrmlicum fah as 'ornamented with serpent forms', but comments unhelpfully that 'the precise meaning is uncertain'.3 Dunning and Bliss, in the vocabulary notes preceding their text of the poem, give several forms they regard as analogous, and indicate that fah here means 'inlaid/ decorated/adorned/patterned', thus giving a translation 'decorated with serpentine patterns'.4 G. V. Smithers has argued, however, that fah (in most of the forms considered by Dunning and Bliss)5 means 'stained/ coloured/painted', and that wyrmfah6 and wyrmlicum fah have 'nothing directly to do with serpents', but refer to the magically-significant red colouring or painting of runes after they had been carved or engraven.7 The example from Beowulf of the rune-inscribed hilt of the sword from the monsters' dwelling fits Smithers's argument well, and the extended I K.

Toller (Oxford, I898), indicates that 'wyrm-' in 'wyrmfah' may have nothing to do with serpents, but may refer to the shell-fish from which a scarlet/red/ purple dye was obtained: cf. s.v. 'wurma', 'wurm-read', 'wyrm-basu'.</page><page sequence="2">meaning 'stained/marked' would appear to give best sense in atertanum fah andfyrmcelum fag.' In the case of bleobrygdum fag the meanings are inseparable: the different colours constitute a pattern on the breast of the phoenix.2 But in the case of wyrmlicum fah, where the element '-lic' indicates a shape or body, Smithers's suggestion is highly disputable. In lines 6-72 of The Wanderer,3 the elegiac themes are conveyed in terms of Anglo- Saxon society, and may be said to have a generally contemporaneous reference. But in lines 73-I IO there is a contemplation of the transience of societies and of the world itself, exemplified in several instances by the visible remains of the buildings of the past. Thus the wall of lines 75-7, returned to in lines 85-7 and 97-8, is 'eald enta geweorc' and 'wundrum heah'; it is not conceived of as contemporary Anglo-Saxon work at all. The mention of the 'dugup' which fell 'wlonc bi wealle' in lines 79-80 and the statement in lines 97-8 Stonde6 nu on laste leofre dugupe weal wundrum heah wyrmlicum fah exemplify the verbal and imaginative problems facing Anglo-Saxon poets dealing with historical societies in a traditional verse medium. The Roman buildings in The Ruin4 similarly become 'meodoheall monig' (23) inhabited by "~~~by ~beorn monig glaedmod ond goldbeorht gleoma gefratwed. (32-3) It is of course unlikely that runes would have been carved and painted on these walls of earlier buildings,5 and a meaning other than 'runes stained/ painted/coloured' must attach to 'wyrmlicum fah'. In their note on wyrmlic, Dunning and Bliss continue: It is perhaps pointless to discuss whether the patterns were carved or painted; we have no means of knowing what was in the poet's mind, and no certainty that he wished to provide antiquarian exactitude.6 I See notes 5 and 6, p. 431. 2 See note 5, p. 43I. 3 All line references are to The Wanderer in The Anglo-Saxon Poetic Records, iii (The Exeter Book), ed.

But such pigmentation would have weathered away quickly when not tended, so that it is improbable that the poet would have seen Roman painted in- scribed stones, and even more improbable that he should consider the inscription as runic. Cf. W. H. French, 'The Wanderer line 98', M.L.N. lxvii (I952), 526: 'The serpentining could scarcely have been interior painting, for if the elements had succeeded in demolish- ing three walls of a well-made building, they could certainly have accounted for its perishable decorations.' This is probably pressing modern rational realism too far upon poetic symbolism. 6 The Wanderer, ed. Dunning and Bliss, p. 74. 432 NOTES</page><page sequence="3">This non-interpretation is more of an avoidance of the issue than an argu- ment that the word had no precise meaning to the poet. R. F. Leslie gives line 98 careful consideration in the Notes to his edition.' He analyses the compound wyrmlic, unique in Anglo-Saxon poetry, into its elements of wyrm, which he says 'is likely to be the word for serpent', and lic, which according to Leslie is the word meaning 'body, form', and by analogy with the compounds eoforlic and swinlic he implies the deduction that wyrmlic means 'serpent shape', which is the translation given in his Glossary. J. C. Pope, in his Glossary, follows Leslie thus far in giving the form 'wyrmlica' meaning 'likeness of a serpent', and he suggests, as does Leslie, that the word probably alludes to 'serpentine ornamentation such as was practised by the Roman builders'.2 Before offering his own interpretation, Leslie canvasses two earlier suggestions. W. H. French surmised of the poet that in thinking of a decayed wooden hall, 'on the outer surface of the timbers, he saw in his imagination the channels and passages cut by engraver beetles and their larvae'.3 Leslie rejects this suggestion on the decisive grounds that the wall is stone. R. O. Bowen proposed that the phrase 'refers to the maggot pattern adornment of Neolithic and Bronze Age monoliths which occur throughout coastal Britain and Bretagne'.4 Leslie rejects this suggestion because the reference is to a wall not a monolith, and he argues that an Anglo-Saxon poet would refer to a monolith as 'stapol'.5 Leslie continues: The phrase would appropriately describe a serpentine motif, possibly in the form of a frieze, carved in relief, and the effect of light and shadow produced by the relief would account for the use offah, 'variegated'. Serpents and serpentine sea-beasts were favourite decorative motifs in Roman stone bas-reliefs and friezes, particularly in Western Europe.6 However, the references Leslie gives do not really support this conten- tion.7 Firstly, all the examples are of Gallo-Roman provenance, and the The Wanderer, ed. R. F. Leslie (Manchester, I966), pp. 86-7. 2 Seven Old English Poems, ed. J. C. Pope (New York, I966). 3 French, loc. cit. 4 R. 0. Bowen, Item 26, Explicator, xiii (I955). 5 Cf. Beowulf, ed. Klaeber, line 27I8: '5a stanbogan stapulum fteste'. However, an Anglo-Saxon would generally refer to a monolith simply as 'stan': cf. 'Degsanstan', The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle trans. G. N. Garmonsway (London, I972), p. 21; 'Ecgbrihtesstan', ibid., p. 77; 'IEgelno5sstane', Anglo-Saxon Charters, ed. A. J. Robertson (Cambridge, 1939), no. lxxviii; and the other stones which can be traced in charter boundaries and place-names, e.g. H. P. R. Finberg, The Early Charters of Wessex (Leicester, 1964), no. 398, II8-20: 'Et deinde ad occidentem confinium respicit in unum tumulum, in cujus summitate lapis infixus est, et ideo Stanborw dicitur.' 6 Ed. cit., pp. 86-7. 7 These references are to Emile Esperandieu, Recueil General des Bas-Reliefs, Statues et Bustes de la Gaule Romaine (Paris, 1907-55), i. 97; iii. 360; iv. 236, 247, 283, 285, 411; vi. 380, 420, 455; vii. 104. 28 NOTES 433</page><page sequence="4">serpentine motif is much less in evidence in Romano-British art.' Even the very common scroll motif, which is serpentine in abstract, never seems to amalgamate with writhing snakes in Romano-British art as it does in Anglo-Saxon art.2 Secondly, most of the examples are of serpentine sea-beasts on friezes, and they are hardly such a dominant decorative motif that a whole wall could be called 'wyrmlicum fah'. The only example where an abstract curvilinear serpentine motif stands alone is on a column.3 Finally, there is in any case little evidence that classical Roman, Gallo- Roman or Romano-British sculpture impressed the Anglo-Saxons, whose artistic models were Celtic, Byzantine, or Nordic, and it is probable that there was little sculpture extant on the ruined Romano-British sites in the later Anglo-Saxon period. Thus none of the suggestions examined gives a wholly satisfactory interpretation of the line; but it has been established that 'wyrmlicum fah' most probably indicates some kind of serpentine decoration of a wall, the remains of a building of an earlier society, visible and impressive to the Anglo-Saxons in England. The most striking serpentine shapes visible in pre-Anglo-Saxon remains in Britain are those produced by herring-bone masonry in Roman walls. The zig-zag patterns created by laying thin bricks or tiles along opposite diagonals on each alternate horizontal course resemble a series of snakes climbing the whole wall. The decorative motif is not on the wall, but more strikingly in the wall, part of its very fabric. H. M. and J. Taylor describe it thus: Herring-bone fabric. The laying of thin stones in diagonal courses is a con- venient method of producing a wall with courses of constant height even when the stones are of varying thickness; and, if the courses are laid alternately in opposite directions, an interesting decorative pattern is also produced.4 The Roman mason may not have had decoration as his primary intention, I There is no mention of snakes or serpent motifs as important in Roman art by J. M. C. Toynbee in The Art of the Romans (London, 1965) and Death and Burial in the Roman World (London, I97I). 2 There is some evidence that serpentine motifs were used in mosaic pavements in Roman Britain: cf. A. Rainey, Mosaics in Roman Britain (London, I973), p. 204, Index of motifs under 'serpents'. But the snakes usually form a minor part of the general composition, and are not a dominant or recurring motif: e.g. the pavement from Harkstow (Lincolnshire) illustrated in D. J. Smith, 'The Mosaic Pavements', The Roman Villa in Britain, ed. A. L. F. Rivet (London, x969), p. 96, which has four giants with legs in the form of serpents. However, a reporter for the Gentleman's Magazine described 'the form of a serpent very lively expressed in that kind of Mosaic work' on a pavement found in Southwark in I8I5 (Rainey, op. cit., p. I15). Of course, most of the Roman pavements would have been unknown to the later Anglo-Saxons. For the Anglo-Saxon serpent- scroll, cf. the Crofton cross: G. Baldwin Brown, The Arts in Early England (London, 1926-37), vi, Part 2, p. 249 and Plate LXXXVII. 3 Esperandieu, op. cit., iii. 360. 4 H. M. and J. Taylor, Anglo-Saxon Architecture (Cambridge, I965), i. 12-13. NOTES 434</page><page sequence="5">but have been forced into employing the technique while working in areas which lacked good building stone. However, it is the serpentine pattern produced which is still most obvious on Roman walls. Instances occur at Leicester, in the Jewry Wall;' Portchester;2 Richborough;3 Reculver;4 Rochester;5 Maidstone;6 and numerous other sites.7 It should be stressed that the technique was used by the Romans, since there has been some confusion on this point. H. M. and J. Taylor state: 'This herring-bone fabric was at one time regarded as a reliable criterion of Anglo-Saxon date; but Baldwin Brown claimed that it was an almost infallible indication to the contrary, and his view has been widely accepted for almost half a century. We believe that neither view is correct; and that herring-bone technique was used by Romans, Anglo-Saxons, Normans and later masons, so that this technique by itself gives no reliable evidence of date.8 Baldwin Brown is responsible for the confusion, since early in his volume on Anglo-Saxon architecture he declares that all herring-bone masonry is Norman repair-work, yet later he states that the Roman technique of herring-bone was imitated by the Carolingians, the Anglo-Saxons, and the Normans.9 It is clear that it is this later view which is correct. The imitation of Roman herring-bone masonry by the Anglo-Saxons indicates that the form and pattern produced were found striking and desirable for reproduction. Instances of Anglo-Saxon herring-bone masonry occur at Diddlebury (Shropshire);10 Burghwallis (Yorkshire);'" Elsted (Sussex);I2 Westhampnett (Sussex);13 Wigmore (Shropshire);14 York Minster;15 Deerhurst (Gloucestershire);16 Monkwearmouth (County of Durham);17 and at Stoke D'Abernon (Surrey), the Anglo-Saxon mason not only I K.

Taylor informs me by letter: 'I have seen a splendid example of diagonally laid stonework in the Roman wall towers of Cologne, but it is not quite herring-bone as I know it, namely thin stones laid diagonally. The Cologne example is much more a case of squared stone laid diagonally to give a decorative pattern'. 8 Anglo-Saxon Architecture, i. I2-13. 9 Baldwin Brown, The Arts in Early England, ii, 8, 243-6.

Herring-bone fabric also occurs within three yards of the Roman example on the Jewry Wall site in Leicester, in the west tower of the partly Anglo-Saxon church of St. Nicholas. Kathleen Kenyon observes that the Jewry Wall was itself incorporated in an early Saxon church, for two Saxon floors linked the two structures and the Jewry Wall and the church are of the same width.z There is, moreover, another technique and art-form known to the Anglo-Saxons in which the herring-bone pattern is closely associated with the form and image of a serpent: the pattern-welded sword. Baldwin Brown notes that the damascening on swords gives a serpentine pattern, but does not pursue the idea.3 However, H. R. Ellis Davidson has given both technical and artistic sides of the subject exhaustive treatment which puts the patterned sword-serpent association beyond any doubt.4 The idea occurs as early as Cassiodorus, who refers to swords presented by the king of the Warni as apparently 'grained with tiny snakes'.5 Dr. Ellis Davidson investigates thoroughly 'the continual association in poetry between swords and serpents',6 and describes how the characteristic herring-bone appearance is created by the art of the smith both ancient and modern;7 to her account it is impossible to add. It is probable that other war-equipment was similarly decorated: the helmet from the Benty Grange tumulus was covered with plates of horn laid diagonally to produce a herring-bone pattern.8 So there exists convincing independent evidence that herring-bone suggested serpents to the Anglo-Saxons. Thus, in 'weal wundrum heah, wyrmlicum fah', an Anglo-Saxon poet could have been giving a precise, clearly-visualized, well-phrased response to Roman herring-bone fabric walls, which other Anglo-Saxons obviously found striking and memorable.9 This in itself would be good poetry; but it may also have a further significance in the context of The Wanderer which will answer P. J. Frankis's question, implied in his statement that 'the reason for mentioning a decorative motif at all remains thoroughly obscure'.o1 It is clear from lines 79-80 and 97-8 of The Wanderer that the wall stands 'on laste leofre dugupe', the 'dugup' which fell beside it. Similarly in Genesis the 'sti6lic stantorr' of Babel stands 'on laste' of its Baldwin Brown, op. cit. ii. 480. 2 K. Kenyon, Excavations at Jewry Wall, p. 8. 3 Op. cit., iii. 214-15. 4 H. R.

Evidently the remains of the empty building are a reminder and mute memorial of its former inhabitants, and the serpentine herring-bone pattern on the wall also suggests a memorial of the dead. H. R. Ellis Davidson, discussing the serpent-dragon and the dead, states that 'the snake as a symbol of the world of the dead is as recurrent in the art of the north as in its literature'.2 Evidence for the same idea can be found in Anglo-Saxon literature and art. In Christ and Satan, Satan says that the hiss of serpents is heard in hell, and snakes dwell there: 'Har is nedran swag, wyrmas gewunade'.3 Dragons and vipers knot together: 'wyrma preat, dracan and naddran'.4 Serpents wind round naked men: 'hwilum nacode men winna6 ymb wyrmas'.5 In Judith, the 'gast' of the dead Holofernes is 'wyrmum bewunden' in the 'wyrmsele' of hell.6 Similarly, IElfric mentions dragons and serpents in the fire of hell.7 Dead bodies wound round with serpents in the underworld are shown in an illumination of the necromancer Mambres at the mouth of hell in the manuscript of The Wonders of the East.8 Serpent-forms are common, especially on grave-covers, in the Scandinavian-influenced sculpture of the British Isles.9 On one Manx cross, the serpents of hell surround Christ.10 I The Anglo-Saxon Poetic Records, i, ed.

The naked man wound round with serpents of this quota- tion has parallels in seventh-century Anglo-Saxon art. A gold bracteate from Riseley (Kent), showing a man between two serpent-like monsters, is figured by H. R. Ellis Davidson, Scandinavian Mythology (London, x969), pp. I25, and discussed by S. C. Hawkes, H. R. Ellis Davidson, and C. Hawkes, 'The Finglesham Man', Antiquity, xxxix (I965), pp. 17-32. An almost identical bracteate from Shrewton (Wilts.) is noticed by David M. Wilson and D. Gillian Hurst, 'Medieval Britain in 1968', Medieval Archaeology, 13 (I969), pp. 241. A similar motif, of 'a raised human figure with snakes enclosed within a double raised rope roundel', appears at least seven times on a band of decoration on a bucket from Loveden (Lincs.): see K. R. Fennell, 'The Loveden Man', Frihmittelalter- liche Studien, iii (i969), 2I -15. The 'man between snakes' motif is part of the larger class of 'man between beasts' motif, of which the best example is on the purse-lid from Sutton Hoo: see R. L. S. Bruce-Mitford, 'The Sutton Hoo Ship Burial', Proceedings of the Suffolk Institute of Archaeology, xxv (I949), 54 if. and Plate VIII. The 'man between beasts' motif may be conceptually related to the myth of the god/hero and his fight against the monsters of the underworld or land of the dead. 6 The Anglo-Saxon Poetic Records, iv, ed.

NOTES 437</page><page sequence="8">Thus the herring-bone pattern of the wall suggests serpent-shapes, which in turn suggest the remembrance of the dead who fell beside the wall; and it is round the images of the dead (the lord, the kinsmen, the 'dugup')I and the images of transience that the elegiac themes of The Wanderer revolve. The reason for mentioning the decorative pattern is one of those associations of the Anglo-Saxon poetic imagination which it is the business of the critic to attempt to reconstruct. Through this association, the clearly-visualized and strikingly-described Roman herring- bone patterned wall fits the thematic framework of The Wanderer.2 TONY MILLNS GEOFFREY WHITNEY'S 'TO RICHARD COTTON, ESQ.': AN EARLY ENGLISH COUNTRY-HOUSE POEM BEN JONSON'S 'To Penshurst' is customarily described as the first English country-house poem, descended directly from Martial's Epigram III 58, 'Baiana nostri villa . . . Faustini', and related both to Horace's Second Epode, 'Beatus ille . . .', and to Virgil's Georgics. But thirty years before its publication Geoffrey Whitney had included in A Choice of Emblemes (1586) two stanzas complimenting Richard Cotton, Esq., on his estate at Combermere. These stanzas are part of the emblem of the bees, and in a collection of 248, most of which are translations from Alciati and his Continental followers, this poem is one of the few that is entirely Whitney's. The block print of a swarm returning to its hive that accompanies the poem is Alciati's, borrowed from the I581 edition of his Emblemata.3 But while the Italian's emblem 'Principia Clementia' concerned the 'king' of the bees as the model of a beneficent ruler, Whitney chose as his motto 'Patria cuique chara':4 To each a native land is dear. Whitney's poem begins, appropriately, with the bees' homecoming: The bees at lengthe retourne into their hiue When they haue suck'd the sweete of FLORAS bloomes.... (1-2) The Wanderer, lines 7, 9-II, 22-3, 28, 31, 34-6, 41-4, 5I-5, 60-3, 78-84, 91-6, 97-100, io6-io. 2 I would like to thank Dr. H. R. Ellis Davidson, Dr. H. M. Taylor, Professor Peter Clemoes, Miss Joan Liversidge, and Dr. John Pickles for their assistance in the preparation of this article; naturally, it is not to be taken to represent their views on the subject. 3 At least one earlier edition of Alciati's emblems has a different print; the edition of 1551 seems to depict wasps, insects more in keeping with Alciati's 'Vesparum'. 4 Whitney's motto, like Alciati's, alludes to one of the anthropomorphic virtues which Zeus granted to the bees in gratitude for their sustaining him when he was hidden from Saturn in the Dictean cave (Georgics iv. I47 ff.). NOTES 438</page></plain_text>
