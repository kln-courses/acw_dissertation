<plain_text><page sequence="1">FISHES OF THE CENTRAL UNITED STATES. By Joseph R. Tomelleri and Mark E. Eberle. 1990. University Press of Kansas, Law- rence, Kansas 66045. 226 p., 163 color illustra- tions, $35.00 (hardcover), $17.95 (softcov- er).-Let me make clear at the outset, despite some negatives, I recommend this book for ad- dition to the library of any ichthyologist, nat- uralist, or layperson interested in the central United States. It is not a highly technical volume and not an authoritative reference for the pro- fessional. It is a highly readable compilation of information on many of the common fishes of the region, and the color illustrations alone make the book a bargain. It is the best available col- lection of well-executed color pictures of fishes of the region. The overall physical appearance of the book is of high quality: paper and print- ing are excellent, format is pleasing, price is reasonable. The centerpiece for the book is the collection of 163 color plates executed in color pencil by Tomelleri. In overview of those plates, I can best quote and agree with Frank Cross from his foreword to the book: "These are drawings in a classic style that portray anatomical detail faithfully but unobtrusively without sacrificing the essence of the organism as a whole." To- melleri is without doubt one of the best wildlife artists to tackle the subject of fishes, and the tale of his and Eberle's "vagabond" days trav- eling throughout the region to collect, sketch, and photograph fishes (which comes out in bits and pieces throughout the text) suggests a pe- riod of pure observation and study of his sub- jects in the tradition of wandering artist-natu- ralists of yesteryear. My overall impression of these drawings is that most capture faithfully the fine nuances of shape, color, and texture that just "look" right to me after years of han- dling most of these species in the midwest. Nu- merous other collections of photographs, line drawings, etc., that have been presented in oth- er volumes in recent decades do provide ana- tomical (key-character) details but often fail to capture the "essence" of the species per Dr. Cross's comment. Line drawings often err in overall shape, and color photographs in some books have focused so much on peak nuptial males that they provide the average person little feeling for the everyday appearance of the fish. Tomelleri's drawings provide a correct balance of color, without overwhelming the viewer, and his sense of proportions and shape are in most cases impeccable. In fair balance to these accolades, the draw- ings of a few species require critical comment. I realize that the appearance of a given species varies among drainages, but the following are my impressions based on specimens I have ob- served in the southern Great Plains. Dorosoma petenense appears in Plate 15 somewhat dull yel- low relative to the brighter yellow in Lake Tex- oma specimens. Our Carpiodes carpio are more silvery and less brassy than the individual de- picted. Most Aphredoderus in Oklahoma appear more purplish than the greenish tones used in Plate 93. Fundulus catenatus, at least in the southern Ozarks, seems more blue and less yel- low. In Plate 105, Morone saxatilis has a green- gray cast, whereas most specimens I handle have almost pure white background. Only one spe- cies seems to me misproportioned: the snout region of Erimyzon oblongus seems slightly "wrong," although I cannot be specific. Most drawings are superb. The gars feature perfec- tion of shape and texture, so realistic that the scales seem as though they should be rough to the touch. Subtle shape differences between No- comis asper and N. biguttatus are well captured. Notropis lutrensis is an excellent Great Plains high male, and most of the minnows depicted (but see below) are well done. The Moxostoma are all well rendered, with shape differences among species realistic and colors, e.g., the reds of M. carinatum, lifelike. The large catfishes are a par- ticularly pleasing series. In contrast to the overall excellence of the plates, the text is a mixture of strengths and weaknesses. The strongest criticism of the book</page><page sequence="2">268 COPEIA, 1991, NO. 1 as a whole, from the perspective of an ichthy- ologist, is its uneven coverage of taxonomic groups. There is a decided bias in favor of de- picting/describing virtually all gamefish, many introduced exotics, and numerous artificial hy- brids. There are only 17 species of minnows, two madtoms, and six darters included in the book. As a result, it should be highly interesting to anglers, but if you give it to a friend hoping to increase their awareness of our many small fishes, you will miss the boat. I am distressed at some of the authors' choices in describing some fishes, even though I realize that their intent was to provide interesting reading. In some cases the implied attitude (e.g., that some fishes are "ugly," "outcasts among fishes," or "repulsive looking") seems too anthropocentric. When I read the authors' statement that "The homely appearance of the stoneroller has not prevented it from becoming one of the most widespread and abundant minnows in the Midwest" to one individual, her reaction was, "What the hell is that supposed to mean?" I confess that I do not know either, but it somehow seems to not be the flavor that I would choose to pass to an interested layperson who might have a serious curiosity about how fishes work in their envi- ronments. One additional ethical problem aris- es in the text: on page 125 the authors advise use of madtoms as bait! We are all aware that this has been a practice of some anglers in the past, but it is illegal in most states (where seining "minnows" legally for bait does not include ic- talurids) and seems likely to encourage anglers to go out and kickset riffles to obtain madtoms. Our benthic fishes do not seem to need every heavy-booted angler in the central United States stomping through their riffle habitats on Friday afternoon! Again, I realize that the authors are attempting to introduce some color and flavor into the subject of fishes, but these animals are sufficiently interesting in their own right that I think questionable practices could have been left unmentioned. I found many of the species accounts highly readable and, particularly for those species with which I am less familiar, quite informative. I really enjoyed the readability and felt that many of the accounts would indeed capture the in- terest and imagination of laypersons. From a scholarly perspective, I thoroughly enjoyed the tidbits of poetry, quotations of early naturalists, and comments by philosophers that are used to introduce many sections of the book. However, there is no literature cited and none of the spe- cific statements about habits of fishes is docu- mented. This is in general no problem, because most facts the authors provide seem accurate, but in some cases I really wished that I could locate their source of information for my own use. For example, on page 63, there is mention of hybridization between chain and grass pick- erel and, on page 64, the indication that the two species will not coexist in the same body of water. I have taken pickerels in north Texas that were taxonomically confusing, and a ref- erence to the paper on these hybrids would be of value if I could locate it. Some of the species or group accounts have omissions or minor technical errors. For ex- ample, the nonparasitic lampreys and their in- teresting lifestyle are omitted. The layperson will get the impression that all lampreys are blood-suckers. Gars are described as "distant second cousins" to bowfins, implying a rather loose attitude toward formal taxonomy. To say that gars are "especially designed" for back- waters seems to beg use of more specific terms like "adapted" or "evolved." The authors in- dicate that gars benefit sport fish populations by eating mostly sick or weak individuals. I have often heard this suggested but am curious as to whether this actually has been demonstrated in the literature. Astyanax mexicanus does not to my knowledge occur in "several lakes in south- ern Oklahoma" and indeed is now extinct in the one lake (Texoma) where there was once an introduced population. On another techni- cal point (and one violated in much fisheries literature), two subspecies do not "hybridize" (see page 170, 172) but "intergrade." On a more positive note, most accounts of species are gen- erally accurate and often entertaining. Also, the authors do a good job of providing some of the flavor of trepidations of taxonomy in describing the difficulties in nomenclature of Micropterus salmoides. Laypersons reading this account may come away with a greater appreciation of "why names change so much." My numerous technical negatives aside, I found this on the whole to be a highly enjoyable book. This is not a technical book for the pro- fessional or senior graduate student needing documented detail. It is, however, an excellent addition to libraries as a general source of in- formation on most of the fishes that are includ- ed. The degree to which omissions (minnows, darters) or some of the anthropomorphic text detracts from overall quality of the book will be mostly a matter of personal taste.</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 269 WILLIAMJ.
