<plain_text><page sequence="1">IMAGES OF "GOD," IMAGES OF MAN, AND THE ORGANIZATION OF SOCIAL LIFE* CHARLES Y. GLOCK Department of Sociology University of California, Berkeley Since the world began, man has contrived a great variety of forms of social organiza- tion. There have been hunting and fishing societies, caste and feudal societies, capitalist and socialist societies, communal societies and communistic ones. Some forms of social organization have flowered briefly only to die. Others have survived over extensive pe- riods of time, sometimes in substantially their original form and other times in drastically modified form. No form of social organization of the past has proven immortal and no present form, it is suspected, will prove so either. The origin and evolution of forms of social organization has been given, in one way and another, a lot of attention by sociologists. It was a major theme in the now classic literature of sociology and almost every major figure of the past-Marx, Weber, Durk- heim, Pareto, Sombart, Comte-touched on it to a large degree. And, of course, questions pertaining to social organization are perhaps the major ones being addressed by contem- porary social theorists. But despite all of the work which has been done, we seem to be still missing at the conceptual level an agreed upon way to order forms of social organization, and at the theoretical level an agreed upon accounting of the conditions governing the life cycle of old and giving rise to new forms of social organization. Indeed, not only are we missing a satisfactory general theory but we experience considerable difficulty in gaining con- sensus around explanations of the origin of particular forms of social organization; wit- ness e.g. the continuing debate about the sources of Western capitalism. This paper has no pretensions of trying to provide any comprehensive answer to major outstanding questions about the birth and life cycle of social organizations. It is concerned, however, to advance a perspective from which such questions might be freshly addressed. At this juncture, the perspective is presented on highly speculative grounds. The intent is to see whether these speculations strike a sufficiently responsive chord to warrant further effort to build upon, to extend, and eventually to subject them to empirical test. *This is a revised and extended version of the author's Presidential Address to the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion, Boston, Massa- chusetts, October, 1969.

Constitutions cannot be drafted, forms of government invented, laws and rules of conduct promulgated, the nature of economy and polity decided unless there are ideas prevailing to guide how these things are to be done. Ideas are important not only to the invention of a form of social organization but to warranting it. No form of social organization can evolve unless it can be made acceptable to those who are obliged to live under it. Acceptance of a sort may be achieved by force and oppression. Those in power may simply impose their will whether those out of power accept it or not. But, to survive over the long rather than the short run, social organiza- tion requires the acquiescence of its constituents. There has to be some modicum of agree- ment that the form of social organization is just and reasonable. To be effective, the ideas which seek to warrant social organization, that is, hierarchical forms, have a mighty task to perform. Certainly, utopian societies have been postulated which would provide for total equality, and on rare occasions and for short periods of time small and isolated groups have managed to approach the utopian dream. But the forms of social organization which have prevailed are ones characterized by inequality rather than equality in the distribution of desirable role assignments and of the rewards which pertain to their performance. Indeed, in most instances, the most desirable roles and rewards are in very short supply and are effectively denied to the majority of popula- tions. Under these circumstances, material self interest is perhaps sufficient to warrant a form of social organization for those who are highly rewarded by it. Material self interest obviously cannot be expected to persuade the less rewarded, and especially those at the bottom of the social ladder, to conform and do so uncomplainingly. Here, clearly, some rationalization of their social fortunes or-better-misfortunes acceptable to them is clearly required if conformity without complaint is to be achieved.' Ideological rationalizations are probably never sufficient in and of themselves to pro- duce the conformity necessary to the survival of a specific social organization. Even in simple, isolated, and homogeneous societies, it is unlikely that the myths which justify the social order will be powerful enough all by themselves to ward off all dissent and deviant behavior. Rationalizations of social order are never completely successful. Consequently, other means have had to be employed to complement ideology as a means of social con- trol. Sanctions constitute one such means, compensations another. Sanctions may range from social pressures imposed by the group on its members to force and suppression imposed by those in power on those who would thwart their will. Sanctions, in effect, are constituted by the ways that societies adopt to reward conformity and punish dissent. Compensations are a means to derail dissent rather than to suppress it directly. Those in society who might otherwise be expected to be non-conformist be- 1. These remarks are not meant to imply that self interest is not an important element in main- taining social control. Indeed, the precise task of ideology is to convince everyone that it is in their self interest to conform. However, for the deprived the appeal to self interest is likely to be in a form other than material rewards.</page><page sequence="3">IMAGES OF "GOD" AND MAN 3 cause conformity affords them so little direct reward are offered alternative rewards which effectively contain deviant propensities. Religion, sports, drugs are among possible com- pensating mechanisms. Societies differ in the relative extent to which ideology, sanctions, and compensations are means of social control. The character of the mix will be a sign of how much social solidarity exists and of how stable a society can be expected to be. Social solidarity and stability can be expected to be high where the ideological rationalization of the social order is universally internalized and accepted and where there is high consensus that the way things are is the way things ought to be. In such a society, everyone would be satis- fied with his lot and uncomplainingly play the role which society has seen fit to assign him. When the ideology is not so powerful, compensating mechanisms are probably likely to be the first means employed to contain dissent. Where these are unsuccessful, the resort to sanctions and increasingly oppressive ones is likely to follow. All three types are exemplified in contemporary history. It is to be recognized, however, that even in the most oppressive police state, ideology will not be absent. Only those in power may be persuaded by it, but it can be expected that they will have internalized some justification of why it is proper that things are the way they are and bend some effort to persuade those who are being suppressed to accept the ideology and in turn, their suppression. Ideology, as has been frequently pointed out, is likely to be of greater importance during periods of social change than periods of relative social stability. At such times, those who favor the status quo and those who favor change will both be concerned to ex- plain why their position is right and to win adherents to their point of view by ideological argument. Periods of social stability, in contrast, are likely to be characterized by a weak status of ideology. Habit and custom are sufficient in a stable situation to maintain con- formity without reference to the ideology rationalizing them. In the absence of alterna- tives, simply the fact that this is the way things always are done is sufficient to sustain them. If, as is being suggested, ideas are important to the invention of new forms of social organization as they were once to the invention of old ones, and if ideas are also impor- tant to warranting the inventions, both as a means to their adoption and to their main- tenance following adoption, it becomes legitimate to ask where these ideas come from. What is the source of the conception of new forms of social organization and from whence come the ideas legitimating them? A distinction probably needs to be made be- tween conceptions which would entirely upturn an existing social order and those which would only modify it-between conceptions of revolution and reform. However, upturn- ing conceptions rarely stem from a single source or emerge fully all at once. Indeed, in contemporary society, social change which may seem classifiable only as a modification may be the harbinger of more radical and upturning change to come. This is a point to be illustrated later. For now, major attention will be focused on the innovation of clearly more radical and holistic forms of social organization. Briefly stated, the central proposition which I wish to advance is that the organization of social life is importantly related to prevailing imagery about "god" and imagery about</page><page sequence="4">4 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION man.2 Such imagery contributes to shaping the form of social organization and to ration- alizing it, and it becomes crucial to the maintenance of social solidarity and stability. Moreover, when prevailing ideas about "god" and the nature of man change, the form of social organization can also be expected to change, sometimes profoundly so. Indeed, a subsidiary theme and claim of the paper is that a change of profound proportions is cur- rently in progress. Fundamental questions of creation and purpose have confronted man throughout history. The existence of the world, the sun and stars, nature, man-his birth, life, and death-all constitute phenomena demanding some kind of explanation even in the most primitive societies. And in every society some effort at accounting has been made. In- evitably, the accounting has included a conception of transcendent forces controlling and constraining the affairs of the world of man. These images of "god" may take rather different forms. Sometimes the otherwordly force is depicted as divinity. This has been the common pattern in the West at least since the time of the ancient Egyptians where images of "god" have been cast in an anthropo- morphic mold. But divinity may not be central nor even present at all in otherworldly conceptions. They may take the form of eternal principles or laws of creation, sacred in the sense that they are seen as inviolate and as set in motion by an otherworldly force. Such conceptions are more frequently found in the East and are illustrated by the ancient Chinese belief in a natural harmony of order in the universe or in Hindu ideas of nirvana and the law of karma. We mean also to include as images of "god" conceptions which deny the supernatural as does Marxism, for example, and some interpretations of modern science. If economic determinism or the propositions of science concerning eternal regu- larities are believed in, they constitute forces transcendent of man with which man must contend. Imbued in every past image of "god" has been some explanation of the purpose of life and a setting forth of goals, consistent with this purpose, to which men ought aspire. Not only ends but means have been specified. Proper ways to believe and to behave have been set forth and in every overarching imagery, sanctions have been introduced to reward con- formity and punish deviance. In turn, ideas about "god's" intention and purpose for man always imply an image of what man is like. Images of man differ radically in what they include in their concepts of man. Universally, however, all have addressed themselves to the question of whether and under what conditions man can be held accountable for what he thinks and what he does. The philosophical controversy over whether man is wholly determined or possessed of free will has still to be resolved, if it is resolvable at all. Throughout history, however, some resolution of the controversy has been a practical matter in human affairs. The or- ganization of social life has required some common understanding of what man is like and particularly what can be reasonably expected of him. The need for a resolution is not recognized in a manifest way, of course. Practical 2. By prevailing is meant that imagery which at any given time and place informs the thinking of the masses of men, not imagery which may dominate in particular elites.</page><page sequence="5">IMAGES OF "GOD" AND MAN 5 men of affairs have not sat down to decide what image of man is to guide the formulation of public policy. Yet, some image of man is as universal an element of social life as is an image of "god." Until now, the image of man which has prevailed in all images of "god" is that man is neither totally free nor wholly determined. Man is conceived as possessing always at least a modicum of free will. In all images, however, there is also an element of deter- minism, sometimes larger, sometimes smaller. In all conceptions, certain conditions and limitations are imposed on human experi- ence. Some things are established as "god"-given and therefore beyond man's capacity to change. Whether men will it or not, the natural harmony of order in the universe, the law of karma, the will of Allah, economic determinism, or the regularities of science, will prevail. But within the framework of these eternal verities, some room is left for man to de- cide for himself. Thus, even in as fatalistic an imagery of "god" and man as is contained in Islam where man's very being and existence is conceived as fated by Allah, there is still an injunction on man to do Allah's will, and therefore an assumption that man is free to choose whether to do so or not. The importance of images of "god" and of man for social structure is that the former at least warrant and sanction the latter and are almost always the source of sanctions and compensating mechanisms. Images of "god" and man may also be instrumental in the invention of forms of social organization. Imagery warrants a social order by proclaiming it to be sacred, affording an explana- tion of its sacredness, and imposing an obligation on man, whatever his position in that social order, to think and to behave as, in effect, that social order dictates. The proclamation of a social order's sacredness may be explicit in the prevailing image of "god." In medieval Europe, for example, there was an extended period when the feudal organization of society was believed to have been ordained by God. The caste organiza- tion of ancient India was also conceived of as "god" inspired. The imagery of "god" in Marxist thought proclaims the communist organization of society as sacred. In some circles, more so perhaps in the past than the present, capitalism as a form of social organ- ization has been claimed to be "god's" intention for man. Proclamation alone, however, never appears sufficient to warrant sacredness. In all imagery, proclamation is reinforced by explanation; there is always some effort to account for the form of social organization, to indicate why it takes the form it does and why the inequality it produces is proper. Medieval feudal social structure, for example, was ac- counted for as being functional to the performance of required social roles. Caste in India was explained as the result of the operation of the law of karma. Inequality in America is the result of some people being willing to work harder than others; to do more with what "god" has bestowed on them. Explanation, in turn, leads to prescription. Given the sacredness of a form of social organization and "god's" reasons therefor, it follows inevitably that "god" intends man to conform. Medieval man, for example, was expected to be complacent about his lot and perform uncomplainingly the role assigned to him by virtue of his birth. There are simi- lar injunctions in Islam and in Hinduism. Under communism one is called upon to con-</page><page sequence="6">6 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION form so that a classless society can be achieved more quickly, and under capitalism con- formity is called for because it is the "best" way to get ahead. It is in prescription, of course, that the assumption of man's possession of free will is contained. To say what man ought to do is to imply that he may elect not to do so. In all imageries, there is the call upon man to make the "right" choice but also the recogni- tion that ideology alone may not be sufficient to the task. All imageries add sanctions- i.e., rewards and punishments-to the leverage of ideology. The sanctions contained in different imageries are not, of course, the same. Where the imagery contains a conception of an afterlife, as in Hinduism, Islam, and Christianity, then the system of sanctions tends to operate in that afterlife. Conceptions which postu- late no afterlife also impose sanctions, but in this world rather than the next. However, whichever form they take, sanctions-rewards for conforming behavior and punishment for deviance-are part of all imageries. Imageries also include a compensating mechanism of some kind, a means to derail dissent and to produce acceptance of their lot, particularly on the part of those who are most deprived by a social order. Promises of eternal rewards in another life constitute one mode of compensation. Where the imagery contains no conception of another life, as in Marxism, for example, those in this generation are encouraged to feel rewarded by the sacrifices they are making for the next. Like the philosophical debate over determinism and free will, the sociological con- troversy about the determinants of forms of social organization continues to rage. It has still to be settled whether changes in ideology are the sources of change in social organ- ization or whether an ideological rationale is the product of the need for social change. Are the idea of nirvana and the law of karma the precursors of the Indian caste system or were they invented as its rationalization? Was the Protestant Ethic a cause or result of the rise of capitalism? While controversy about which comes first remains, there is probably consensus by now that ideology and social structure are intimately related and that changes in one can- not occur without changes in the other. I intend by these observations to support this proposition but to extend it by specifying that the ideological change involves a revision in what "god" and man are understood to be like. I am also inclined to support Max Weber in his contention that a change in imagery may precede rather than follow a change in social structure. To demonstrate the viability and generalizability of these propositions would require the examination of the universe or at least a sample of the forms of social organization which man has contrived and about which there are available records. It would have to be established that these forms of social organization are indeed rooted in an ideology of "god" and man. Moreover, it would have to be demonstrated that the decline and disap- pearance of old and the rise of new forms of social organization have always been ac- companied by a decline in one imagery and the innovation of another. Such an enterprise clearly is too ambitious to be undertaken lightly or by any one person. Yet, it might warrant a collective effort if there were enough consensus about the potential of the basic propositions. In the present paper, I should like to make a case</page><page sequence="7">IMAGES OF "GOD" AND MAN 7 for this potential through applying the perspective to an examination of gross social change in the West. Since the middle ages, there have undoubtedly been a great variety of ways in which the meaning and purpose of the universe have been understood and in which "god" and man have been depicted. But much of this variety has characterized only small numbers of individuals and despite a possible potential for doing so, has never secured the wide base of public support to become the grounds for organizing or rationalizing a nation state. Indeed, of the great variety, it is suggested that only three sets of images of "god" and man and three basic forms of social organization have held sway in the West since medieval times. To the sets of images may now be added a fourth emerging set which promises to hold sway in the future but whose impact on existing social order until now has been to modify rather than to upturn it. Max Weber's classic work The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism and his comparative studies of religion, together with Emile Durkheim's The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life, are the sources and stimuli of many of the ideas being expressed in this paper.3 It was Weber's contrasting analysis of the beliefs and values underlying feudal and newly emerging capitalist society in the West and classic Chinese and Indian society in the East which first suggested the idea that images of "god" and of man are importantly related to social structure. Weber does not use this terminology, of course, but sometimes explicitly, and sometimes implicitly, he frequently addresses himself to the questions of what man postulates about the forces beyond this world and what these conceptions signify for man's social life on earth. Weber does this explicitly in his analysis of the ideology warranting medieval society. The feudal organization of society, he points out, is declared to be sacred by virtue of its having been ordained by "god." This is not a capricious act on "god's" part. On the con- trary, by ordaining that society shall be organized in a hierarchical way, that men shall be born to different stations in life, and that they shall perform uncomplainingly the role their stations dictate, "god" is behaving in an eminently reasonable way and in the inter- est of insuring that social life proceed in an orderly fashion. Social life requires, after all, government, industry, servitude, and isn't it appropriate that in his wisdom, "god" has seen fit to supply men in the quantity and with the qualifications to perform these dif- ferent tasks? The imagery, in addition to warranting the social order, imposes sanctions and affords compensations to reinforce the dicta to conform. There are to be rewards in heaven for those who conform, and while conforming may entail sacrifices in this life, there is also the hope of better things to come. Within the system, the assumption is made that man is possessed of free will and has some control over his destiny. His control, however, is effectively limited to his fate in the next world, not this one. The latter has been determined for man by "god," and is therefore beyond man's ability to change. 3.

Swain (London: George Allen and Unwin, Ltd., n.d.).</page><page sequence="8">8 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION Because man has free will, it becomes reasonable to impose responsibilities on him and to reward or punish him for how responsibly he behaves. In the medieval context, behaving responsibly meant accepting and acting in conformity to the social fate "god" had willed. In combination, then, medieval images of "god" and man warrant and sanction the hierarchical organization of feudal society and thereby provide a means to persuade men to accept the particular form of inequality which that society imposed. The inequality, it is especially to be noted, is in this instance an act of "god," not of man. The shift from a feudal to a capitalist form of social organization was accompanied, as Weber and others have documented, by a radical change in rationalizing ideology in- cluding a marked alteration in prevailing imagery about "god" and man. The effect of the structural changes from feudalism to capitalism was not to eliminate inequality but to radically alter its character. The new imagery of "god" and man warranted, explained, and sanctioned the new basis of inequality and provided compensations for those who were its victims. In the emerging ideology, while "god" continues to be personified, there is a marked shift in the control he is conceived to exercise over this world and specifically over the social structure. There is also a decided change in what "god" is seen to have determined for man and how much of man's destiny he grants man to decide for himself. It is no longer held, as it was in the medieval period, that any social order is explicitly ordained by "god." The theocracy which Calvin sought to establish in Geneva presum- ably followed from his interpretation of "god's" intentions. But the emerging secular capitalism was not considered to be the inspiration of "god," at least not directly. Its warrant was contained more in what came to be a new consensus about the nature of man. In the medieval period, man was conceived as exercising some control over his destiny in the next world, with his fate in this world being effectively sealed by "god's" ordina- tion. During the rise of capitalism, this imagery was reversed. Man's eternal salvation came to be thought of as predestined but, his fate in this world was effectively his to decide. "God" had created man in his image but had then left man free to carve out his own destiny here on earth. To be sure, there was an injunction for man to work for "god's" glory but this did not impose on man an obligation to accept his lot in life. In- deed, it came to be, in marked contrast to the medieval period, that man was enjoined to improve on rather than accept his social origins. Over time, as Weber has pointed out, the idea that "god" had predestined man's eter- nal fate came to be watered down. First, it came to be thought that there were signs by which man could know the fate "god" had assigned to him. Later, the idea gained wide acceptance, judging from its survival in contemporary times, that man could influence t'god" in his favor or against through his actions on this earth. The result was an image of man which conceived him as having the power to control his destiny in this world and to influence it in the next. Man as master of his fate became central to rationalizing the particular form of in- equality which capitalism created. There was an assumption to begin with that in "god's" eyes all men are created equal. Inequality then became a creation of man generated by the fact that men differ in how responsibly they exercise their freedom. Some men, as is</page><page sequence="9">IMAGES OF "GOD" AND MAN 9 evidenced by how well off they are in this life, are exercising their freedom wisely. Others, who fail to succeed, have no one to blame but themselves, since it was in their discretion to have opted otherwise. What came to be thought of as good and bad choices is highly important to the ra- tionalizing process, of course. Here, as Weber points out, hard work, diligence, thrift, prudence, and other puritan virtues constituted one set of signs that good choices were being made and the product of these virtues-material success-constituted effectively another sign. There is no firm evidence to say how powerful these ideas were in and of themselves in containing dissent. Contemporary data suggest, however, that the ideas have consider- able power still and provide presumptive evidence that their power was even greater earlier.4 But the ideas did not have to carry all of the weight, of course. There were for the deprived alternative compensations to material success in which to take comfort. While the explanation of inequality changed radically in the shift from feudal to capitalist society, compensating mechanisms did not, and one finds rather much the same compensations in one society as the next. This is most forcefully evident in religion. With its retention of an anthropomorphic "god," a belief in an afterlife, and the possibil- ities of eternal bliss in heaven, religion continued to be a comfort and solace to relieve the trials and tribulations of life. Aside from helping to account for inequality, prevailing assumptions about the nature of man provided a rationalization for and played a part in shaping major institutions of capitalist society. The organization of the economic order was highly consistent with an image of man as free and therefore responsible, as were the law and the legal system created to administer it. The image also afforded a rationalization of prevailing punish- ment practices. Since it is at the criminal's option that he commits a crime, it is right and just that society hold him responsible for his act and punish him for it. Man as master of his fate was also the image of man permeating social welfare prac- tices of capitalist societies. The poor, it was thought, are poor because they choose to be poor and having made their bed, they ought to be satisfied to lie in it. This attitude did not warrant the total neglect of the poor, but charity was an act of mercy rather than responsibility, and charitable giving was a sign of righteousness of the affluent rather than an acknowledgment of merit in the poor. Other institutions whose organization was highly consistent with this individualistic image of man were politics, education, medicine, the family; indeed in all spheres of life, man conceived as free but responsible became a pervasive influence in deciding institu- tional organization, role assignment, evaluation of performance, and the distribution of scarce rewards. Socialism as it emerged under that name in the 18th century afforded no immediate effective challenge to entrenched capitalism; such a challenge became real only with Karl 4. In a survey of the adult population of the United States conducted in 1966, for example, 67 percent of the white respondents agreed that "Negroes who want to work hard can get ahead as easily as anyone else."

With its emergence, however, socialism, by questioning some of capitalism's fundamental assumptions about "god" and man, began a process, still going on, of reducing the viability of capitalist-inspired forms of social or- ganization. Until Marx, socialism produced no highly articulate or agreed upon imagery of "god." Forms of Christian socialism coexisted with other forms which adopted an agnostic or outrightly atheistic position. Early socialist thinkers agreed, however, on an imagery of man which rejected two shibboleths of capitalist thought: one, that however created, man was equal in anybody's sight, and two, that man's destiny was largely his to decide. Socialist thought recognized "god" as the source of inequality, only now it was no longer so clear that this is as much the work of an anthropomorphic "god" as it is the result of historical and social forces to which man is subject. In medieval thought inequality in capacity was seen as justification for parallel in- equalities in the distribution of rewards. Under socialism there is no warrant for man's being rewarded or deprived for what "god" has done. The principle which ought to apply is "from each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs." That man is possessed of free will is implicitly assumed but his free will is not nearly so unbounded as it is under capitalism. Man cannot through his own efforts transcend the capacities with which he is endowed. He is free, however, to choose whether he de- velops these capacities. Early socialism articulated a model of social organization which was consistent with these assumptions about man. By the time of Marx, however, the occasion had not arisen to put the model to a test and Marxist thought very sharply modified its parameters and the imagery of "god" and man underlying them. Marx's attack on capitalism constituted more than a denial of the validity of capital- ism's assumptions about "god" and man, of course. These are seen primarily as epiphe- nomena used by those in power to suppress those out of power. Yet Marx found it nec- essary to invent his own epiphenomena both to inform and to warrant the form of social organization he advocated as an alternative. Marx's imagery of "god" is much closer to the Eastern model of eternal principle than it is to Western divinity. Marx rejected the idea of an anthropomorphic "god," of course, but he firmly believed that there are forces at work which are transcendent of man, which are purposeful and goal oriented, and to which man is called to be subject. These forces, while determined inevitably both in direction and ultimate point of culmination-a class- less society-are highly benevolent and directed to enabling man's highest potential. In Marx's view, therefore, they are "sacred" and being so, are owed man's allegience. Man, as in other conceptions, is conceived as free to choose for or against "god." However, until a classless society has been achieved, man's freedom of choice is limited. He can help to accelerate or impede progress towards a classless society. There is nothing man can do, however, to change the course of history: the ultimate achievement of a classless society is inevitable. Marx saw success as socially determined by relations to the means of production rather than by individual virtue. In this regard, Marx adopted essentially the earlier socialist view that men have no control over how they are created and therefore there is no justifi-</page><page sequence="11">IMAGES OF 'GOD" AND MAN 11 cation for inequality. Indeed, inequality constitutes an aberration of what is naturally in- tended for man, and therefore ought to be eliminated as it eventually will be in a class- less society. In sum, Marx's imagery establishes what the social order ought to be like and why, and outlines a means for its achievement. As in other conceptions, both man's possession of free will and his obligation to use it responsibly are acknowledged and acting respon- sibly is specified as doing "god's" will. Marxism differs from other conceptions, of course, both in ideas about the nature of "god" and "god's" intention for man. However, the ingredients are all consistent with the proposition that images of "god" and man are im- portantly related to social organization. In his analysis of capitalism, Marx was acutely aware of the role which compensa- tions and sanctions play in derailing and containing dissent. Such mechanisms would no longer be necessary once, under communism, a classless society has been achieved. Then there would be no longer occasion for revolutionary dissent. Marx recognized, however, that sanctions, if not compensations, would be required along the way and his predictions in this respect, of course, have been borne out. Contrary to his expectations, however, the revolution of the proletariat did not occur first in highly industrialized capitalist societies but in countries closer to the feudal model in their form of social organization. This has been accounted for as largely the result of capitalism in its advanced stages failing to produce the pronounced separation of classes that Marx predicted. The fact that communist theory conflicted so sharply with the rem- nants of capitalist imagery has also been thought a major factor. It may also be that com- munism has not won out because the viability of its imagery was already being challenged, particularly in the West, by an emerging new imagery. The new imagery has its roots in the new understanding of "god" and of man being contributed by modern science, including social science.5 Science's imagery of "god" is that there is no God, at least not as past imageries would have it. There are, to be sure, forces transcendent of man to which he is subject. Unlike past imageries, however, sci- ence makes no underlying assumptions or forthright claims that these forces have a pur- pose for man, or that they are benevolent, inscrutable, and beyond man's control. On the contrary, the foundation stones of science are that such forces are knowable, within still undetermined limits controllable, and innately benign. It is accepted by some scientists that there may be a purpose for man to be gained by the understanding science produces. There is no consensus as yet as to what this purpose might be or whether it will emerge at all. In its understanding of man, science is also grounded in a different set of assumptions than imageries of the past. Unlike old imageries, science does not accept as given that man is possessed of free will. The basic assumption governing scientific inquiry on man and his behavior is deterministic. What man is and how he behaves are decided for him, not by him. The deterministic posture of science is heuristic; it provides a point of departure for 5.

There is no expectation that it can ever be established whether man is wholly determined or not. Assuming so, however, is crucial to enabling and sustaining scientific inquiry. Acting on its deterministic assumptions, science has been able to demonstrate that man's being and behavior, if not wholly decided by heredity and environment, is highly circumscribed by them. What man is at birth is clearly decided for man, not by him. In turn, what he becomes and does during life is conditioned by what he is at birth and by how and in what context he is socialized. Science's understanding of how heredity and environment function to affect man is highly incomplete. There are vast areas unaccounted for and controversy about the modest claims science is now capable of making. Nevertheless, science has succeeded in demon- strating the partial validity of its deterministic assumptions. Since the determinism is not established as complete, science does not deny directly the claims implicit if not always explicit in old imageries that man is possessed of free will. What is made problematic are the additional claims of old imageries that there is an identifiable range of man's behavior over which he exercises control and for which, consequently, he can justifiably be held responsible. Scientists disagree about the possi- bility of gaining the knowledge someday to allow such distinctions to be made. For the moment and the foreseeable future, man can be exempted from responsibility for the things that science is able to establish are decided for him, not by him; for example, that he is not accountable because of insanity. For the rest, however, it will be ambiguous when responsibility may be reasonably imposed and when it may not. The possibility will always remain that aspects of human behavior now assumed to be man's free choice may be found out not to be after all. Unlike old imageries, science neither advances a new blueprint for the organization of social life nor does it affirm the validity of any existing form. Rather, by being agnos- tic about "god's" intentions for man and ambiguous about the extent of man's responsi- bility for himself, science denies effectively that there exists an ideological basis for social order, that is to say, a social order in which consensus about the reasonableness of social arrangements, rather than sanctions and compensations, is the primary source of social control. It is conceivable, although at this time it seems highly unlikely, that science will someday learn enough to identify a purpose for man and establish the extent of man's freedom. Until it does, what can be expected with increased diffusion and internalization of scientific perspectives is the erosion of old imageries and the social structures they support accompanied by an extended period of social disintegration as men, with different visions of what scientific understanding implies for social organization, struggle for power. The diffusion process will proceed more rapidly and its effects will be felt more quickly, it can be expected, in those societies which are the main producers of scientific knowledge and which offer the fewest obstacles to its dissemination; this means for this generation the nation-states of the West and most notably, the United States. Indeed, in the United States, the diffusion and internalization process has proceeded far enough to</page><page sequence="13">IMAGES OF "GOD" AND MAN 13 have produced already some dislocation of existing social arrangements and considerable ambiguity about what the future portends. It has been asserted, probably fairly, that science cannot establish the existence or the nonexistence of "god." The findings of science can and do test the credibility of particular conceptions of "god," however, and under scientific scrutiny, the imagery of "god" which has been dominant in American culture has not fared very well. Scientific explorations of space have made suspect the three-story depiction of the universe characteristic of the old imagery of "god." Scientific discoveries about regularities in nature have raised serious questions about the literalness of Biblical miracles. And, social scientific investigations of other religions have produced doubts about the claim that the Christian "god" is the only true "god." That "god" is dead is not a message which the majority of Americans have accepted as yet, but the process of erosion appears set on an inevitable course and "god," anthropo- morphically conceived as residing in heaven and exercising dominion over this world seems destined for residual status and perhaps for oblivion. In itself, the erosion of belief in an anthropomorphic "god" does not constitute a threat to the traditional organization of American society. By raising doubt and disbelief, science probably reduces the ability of the old image of "god" to be a compensating mechanism for derailing dissent. By now, however, imagery of "god" is no longer central to the ideological rationalization of inequality in America nor to warranting the validity of American institutions. Such warrants derive much more from traditional imagery about man than about "god," but that imagery is also threatened by science and in ways which are already proving a stimulus to social instability. Perhaps the most visible sign of the threat is the weakening in the power of the old imagery of man to rationalize inequality. It is no longer as clear as it once was that the poor are poor because they choose to be poor or that Blacks and other disadvantaged minorities could succeed as well as anyone else if only they would try. There is no agreed upon alternative to these old understandings. Just as scientists disagree about the relative role of different hereditary and environmental factors in producing poverty and inequality between races, so too there are alternative and frequently conflicting expla- nations being opted for in various publics. Cultural, social, psychological, genetic expla- nations compete alone and in combination in the marketplace of ideas. Nevertheless, binding those who are now committed to alternative explanations is the abandonment of the imagery that inequality is the result of differences in the way that individuals, left free by "god" to control their own destinies, choose to exercise that control. With the weakening and gradual abandonment of this imagery has come an increas- ing unwillingness on the part of the disadvantaged to accept their situations passively and an increasing guilt on the part of the more affluent that deprivations exist. These changes in attitude have stimulated and allowed a growing militancy on the part of the disprivileged. They have also produced a growing effort on the part of public and private agencies to alter the social arrangements that the old imagery helped to sustain. These efforts, among them the poverty program, desegregation, compensatory education, busing, legislation against discrimination in housing, employment, education, are all characterized by a rejection of the idea that individuals are largely responsible for their own fate.</page><page sequence="14">14 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION There is no clear, unified imagery advanced to replace the old, however, and conse- quently, no clear vision of what new social arrangements ought to be substituted for the past ones. There is a sense that if only man could be freed of constraining social condi- tions, then he would indeed be free to guide his own destiny. It remains ambiguous, however, as it does in science, exactly when and where conditioning ends and freedom begins. In all of the ameliorative activity just cited, this ambiguity is reflected in the lack of consensus among policy makers and between policy makers, their clients, and taxpayers as to how much help ought to be extended and at what point the disadvantaged ought to be expected to help themselves. In the absence of consensus, there is no possi- bility of formulating policy which will satisfy everyone and no hope for producing ideo- logical agreement about the justice of any social arrangement in which inequality or equality prevails. The diffusion of scientific imagery is also having an impact on the assignment of responsibility in American law. In a system of law informed by the imagery that man is in control of his own destiny, it was considered entirely reasonable and just that anyone who commits a crime be held responsible and accountable for his action. By being un- clear about how much control man does have over his actions and by denying effectively that there is a way to recognize when man is in control and when he is not, the new imagery substitutes ambiguity for the explicitness of the old. The ambiguity has not as yet been so widely recognized as to result in the abandonment of the traditional concept of responsibility in American law. Increasingly, however, in American courtrooms, judges and juries are experiencing difficulty in assigning responsibility to those who either acknowledge and/or have been found guilty of committing a crime. As with regard to inequality, there is disagreement as to who or what is responsible if the individual isn't. It's the fault of genes for some, and for others deficiencies in the socialization process or the immorality of social arrangements. Here laymen reflect the imprecision of science about what the determining agents are. For increasing numbers, however, the old expla- nation that it is the individual who is at fault no longer applies unequivocally. The drift toward the welfare state is another sign of the effects of the diffusion. That individuals become sick, disabled, grow old, and die was not attributable to individual deficiency, by and large, even under the old imagery. These were things decided for men, not by them. Nevertheless, under the old imagery, it remained a matter of individual responsibility that such contingencies be prepared for and taken care of, and in America's past, medicine, insurance, and even funeral arrangements were organized accordingly. The earlier innovation of social security, the recent adoption of Medicare, the growth of group practice in medicine, of group insurance, of funeral societies, and the increased pressure for socialized medicine reflect a substantial change from the old attitude, a change indicative of the growing public recognition that man's ability to be responsible for himself is not entirely his to decide. The shift in imagery is also an element, I would aver, in contemporary student unrest, in new forms of religious consciousness, in the increasing pluralism of American life, and indirectly in the public's response to the Vietnam war, the new interest in ecology, the women's liberation movement, and other manifestations of disenchantment with the way things are and have been. As might be expected, the explosion of a myth not only gen-</page><page sequence="15">IMAGES OF "GOD" AND MAN 15 erates the breakdown of social arrangements it supported directly, but creates a threat to the entire structure as well. It is not meant to imply by these observations that American society is in danger of imminent collapse. Not only hasn't the abandonment of the old imagery proceeded that far but old imageries, we are learning once again, are more readily given up than the fruit that they produced. Moreover, until there is more agreement than there is now about alternatives, any radical overturning of social arrangements is not likely to occur. Nevertheless, the situation is considerably more in flux than it was when the old imagery prevailed and as has been suggested earlier, it is likely to continue to be so until either science learns enough so that its imagery of "god" and man becomes explicit enough to allow a consensual basis for social order or, as seems more likely, enough support is generated for a particular vision to allow its implementation by imposition. The publi- cation of B. F. Skinner's Beyond Freedom and Dignity6 just as this article went to press is a sign that the competition has begun. 6. B. F.
