In a decision en- joining the city of Jackson from maintaining separate waiting rooms in train and bus stations, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit took judicial notice of the state's "steel-hard, inflexible, undeviating official policy of segregation . .., stated in its laws . . . , rooted in custom," and observed by the city.7 In 1962, black residents of Jackson brought an omnibus suit to desegregate the city's public facilities including its five swim- ming pools. In May 1962, nine days after the district court entered a declaratory judgment in plaintiffs' favor,8 Jackson's mayor Allen Thompson announced: "We will do all right this year at the swimming pools . . but if these agitators keep up their pressure, we would have five colored swimming pools because we are not going to have any intermingling."9 The mayor added that the city had legislative authority to sell the pools or close them down. One year later, the city's recreational facilities remained segre- gated.10 Mayor Thompson announced that "neither agitators nor President Kennedy will change the determination of Jackson to retain segregation."'x When a committee of black citizens re- 5 403 U.S. at 247 (White, J., dissenting).

THOMPSON 97 quested that the facilities be desegregated, Mayor Thompson responded that "in spite of the current agitation" he and the com- missioners were planning to build additional Negro parks, a Negro clubhouse, a Negro library, and other recreational facilities for Negroes.12 Pressures from the black community persisted, and in the spring of 1963 Mayor Thompson announced that the pools would not be opened on schedule "due to some minor water diffi- culty."13 Jackson did not reopen the swimming pools. The city canceled its lease on one pool owned by the YMCA and sold another to Jackson State College. The three pools owned by the city remain closed to this day.14 In 1965, the petitioners in Palmer v. Thompson, alleging that Jackson had closed its swimming pools solely to avoid integrating them, sued to compel the city to reopen the pools and operate them on a desegregated basis. Respondents conceded that the deci- sion to close the pools was precipitated by the 1962 desegregation ruling. They claimed, however, that it was not the prospect of desegregation as such, but attendant physical and economic haz- ards, that underlay the decision. Mayor Thompson submitted an affidavit that stated: "Realizing that the personal safety of all of the citizens of the City and the maintenance of law and order would prohibit the operation of swimming pools on an integrated basis, and realizing that the said pools could not be operated eco- nomically on an integrated basis, the City made the decision."15 For some years, the city had operated its pools at a deficit, boasting that its fees were "the lowest to be found anywhere in the country . . . in order to serve as many people as possible."16 The respondents offered no evidence supporting their predictions that the deficit would increase if the pools were desegregated. Nor did respondents provide any basis for the prediction that desegre- gation of the pools would lead to racial violence." 12 Id. at 250-51. 13 Id. at 251. 14 Id. at 252-53. 15 Id. at 253.

He asserted that the Court has never "held that a legislative act may violate equal protection solely because of the motivations of the men who voted for it,"21 distinguishing Griffin v. Prince Edward County School Board22 and Gomillion v. Lightfoot23 on the ground that "the focus in those cases was on the actual effect of the enactments" rather than on motivation.24 As authority for the impropriety of judicial review of legislative motivation, he cited Fletcher v. Peck,25 and he reiterated the con- cerns expressed in United States v. O'Brien:26 it is difficult to ascer- tain motivation-especially the "sole" or "dominant" motivation of a group of legislators; and it is futile to strike down a law that would be "valid as soon as the legislature . .. repassed it for differ- ent reasons.""'27 Mr. Justice Black found credible respondents' ex- planation for their decision to close the pool. And he concluded the discussion by asserting that no one was denied the equal pro- tection of the laws "when the city has closed the public pools to black and white alike."28 Chief Justice Burger and Mr. Justice Blackmun each wrote a short concurring opinion, expressing their common concern that, if petitioners prevailed, Jackson would "be 'locked in' with its pools for an indefinite time in the future, despite financial loss of whatever amount, just because at one time the pools of Jackson had been segregated."29 18 Palmer v.

THOMPSON 99 Mr. Justice White wrote the principal dissenting opinion, in which he proposed alternative grounds for reversal:30 The record indicated that the city had closed its pools solely because of offi- cial opposition to integration. This action would violate the Four- teenth Amendment even if the decision operated equally on blacks and whites. But the city's decision operated unequally, for it stig- matized black citizens by expressing the "official view that Negroes are so inferior that they are unfit to share with whites this particu- lar type of public facility."31 Moreover, even accepting respon- dents' stated reasons for closing the pools, any state action designed to avoid integration bears a heavy burden of justification that is not satisfied by "vague speculation" about possible adverse conse- quences.32 II. INTRODUCTION TO THE PROBLEM OF LEGISLATIVE MOTIVE Palmer v. Thompson is but the latest addition to one of the most muddled areas of our constitutional jurisprudence. The Court's opinion is typical of the current state of the art. First, Mr. Justice Black's assertion that Griffin v. County School Board and Gomillion v. Lightfoot turned solely on effect rather than on motivation is untenable. In Griffin, the Court invalidated the closing of a county school system and the payment of tuition grants to students attending private schools. The Court held (per Mr. Justice Black) :.3 [T]he record in the present case could not be clearer that Prince Edward's public schools were closed and private locked in forever?" Counsel responded: "If the question is, are they locked in forever because of racial problems which cause a rise in economic difficulties in operating the pool, my answer is that they would be locked in."

Mr. Justice Douglas dissented separately, relying chiefly on the Ninth Amendment. 31 Id. at 266. Mr. Justice White also suggested that an official policy of closing public facilities after they were ordered desegregated would deter Negroes from asserting their constitutional rights. Id. at 269.

Whatever non- racial grounds might support a State's allowing a county to abandon public schools, the object must be a constitutional one, and grounds of race and opposition to desegregation do not qualify as constitutional. In Gomillion, the Alabama legislature had altered the shape of the city of Tuskegee from a square to an "uncouth twenty-eight-sided figure,"34 with the effect of removing all but a handful of black voters (but not a single white voter) from the city limits. The Court sustained an action to set aside the change, finding these facts "tantamount for all practical purposes to a mathematical demon- stration, that the legislation is solely concerned with segregating white and colored voters by fencing Negro citizens out of town.""3 Although Mr. Justice Black made no mention of it, the Court has inquired into legislative motivation in areas other than equal protection. The Court's current standard of review under the Establishment Clause, for example, calls for an inquiry into "the purpose and the primary effect of the enactment. . ... If either is the advancement or inhibition of religion then the enactment ex- ceeds the scope of legislative power as circumscribed by the Con- stitution."36 As recently as 1968, the Court invalidated a state law forbidding the teaching of Darwinian theory in the public schools, solely on the ground that the law's purpose was "to blot out a particular theory because of its supposed conflict with the Biblical account."37 Second, Mr. Justice Black's reliance on Fletcher v. Peck was mis- placed. The Georgia legislature there rescinded an enormous land trative Motivation in Constitutional Law, 79 YALE L.J. 1205, 1295-96 (1970) (here- after cited as Ely). 34 364 U.S. at 340. 35 Id. at 341.

Arkansas, 393 U.S. 97 (1968). The Court has also inquired into motivation to determine whether a statute has punitive intent under the Bill of Attainder Clause, see United States v. Lovett, 328 U.S. 303 (1946), and the Due Process Clause, see Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. 144, 169-84 (1963).</page><page sequence="7">95] PALMER V. THOMPSON 101 grant made by an earlier session of the legislature, members of which had been bribed to vote for the grant. Fletcher was the bona fide purchaser of a parcel of this land from Peck. Alleging that the bribery nullified the grant, Fletcher sued Peck for breach of a covenant that all of the state's title in the premises had been conveyed to Peck. Chief Justice Marshall, after mentioning the problems that a judicial inquiry into political corruption would present if the issue were properly raised, held that it could not be raised "collaterally and incidentally" in a private action for breach of covenant. (The Court went on to hold that the state could not, in any case, impair the interests of bona fide purchasers by rescind- ing the grant.) Although the Chief Justice did not clearly state his reasons for refusing to inquire into the alleged corruption, they appear to be an amalgam of the general impropriety of the inquiry, Fletcher's lack of "standing" to raise the issue, and the absence of an in- dispensable party, the state.38 Whatever Fletcher held, however, it cannot be parlayed into a general pronouncement against judicial review of unconstitutional legislative motivation. First, of course, the constitutionality of the land grant was never in question. But more fundamentally, Fletcher dealt with a qualitatively different kind of "motivation" from that involved in Palmer, O'Brien, Griffin, and Gomillion. In Fletcher the question that the Court refused to ask was: what did the decisionmakers desire to achieve in terms of personal benefits (for example, lining their pockets) by the act of voting? The inquiry eschewed in Palmer and O'Brien bears closer resemblance to the traditional search for legislative purpose as an aid to statutory interpretation: what effects did the decisionmakers desire to achieve by the operation of their deci- sion?39 These inquiries differ functionally as well as formally, for the methods for proving corruption entail a judicial intrusion into the political processes that is largely absent in the latter inquiry.40 Finally, in Palmer, as in O'Brien, the Court failed to elucidate its functional arguments against judicial review of motivation, and failed entirely to consider the arguments that might favor such review. I will deal at length with these matters below, but some 38 See 6 Cranch at 130-31. 39 See Ely, at 1218; MacCallum, Legislative Intent, 75 YALE L.J. 754, 756-57 (1966). 40 See text infra, at notes 126-44.</page><page sequence="8">102 THE SUPREME COURT REVIEW [1971 of the basic questions can be noted here. Even if legislative motiva- tion is often difficult to ascertain,41 is the inquiry inevitably so problematic that it should never be undertaken? Why must the inquiry be complicated by searching-as Mr. Justice Black assumed one must search-for " 'sole' or 'dominant' motivation"?42 More- over, why is it "futile" to invalidate a law enacted for impermis- sible reasons just because it could be readopted for valid reasons?43 And, finally, what policies might support the invalidation of an otherwise permissible law enacted for illicit reasons? So far as I know, the Court has never squarely addressed the last question, the answer to which would seem a prerequisite for any coherent theory of judicial review of legislative motivation, and a precondi- tion to Palmer's flat assertion that "the closing of the Jackson swimming pools to all its citizens [does not] constitute ... a denial of 'the equal protection of the laws.' "44 Legal scholars have offered the courts virtually no assistance in handling the problem of judicial review of motivation. The academic tradition of superficial treatment of the subject was essen- tially broken a year ago with the publication of Professor John Ely's article, "Legislative and Administrative Motivation in Con- stitutional Law."45 Ely raised and sharpened many important issues that have long remained hidden, and he undertook a valuable examination of legislative motivation in a number of substantive areas of constitutional law.46 Useful and important as his article is, however, I believe that much of its analysis is incorrect and that it failed in its effort to formulate a coherent doctrine to govern judicial review of motivation. 41 403 U.S. at 224-25. 42 Ibid. 43 Ibid.; 391 U.S. at 384. 44 403 U.S. at 226. 45 Note 33 supra. 46 The extent to which a judicial determination of motivation is relevant to the outcome of a case depends on the substantive doctrine in the particular area of law involved. For example, if the courts become more willing to invalidate official acts because they have undesirable effects, see Michelman, On Protecting the Poor through the Fourteenth Amendment, 83 HARV. L. REv. 7 (1969)--if, for example, school segregation is held unlawful simply because it is educationally harmful, see, e.g., Fiss, The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Case-Its Significance for Northern School Desegregation, 38 U. CHI. L. REv. 697 (1971)-the role of judicial review of legisla- tive motivation will be diminished pro tanto. See Ely, at 1254-61, 1281-82. I do not propose to enter into debate over these substantive issues. There are, and there doubtless will remain, cases in which judicial review of legislative motivation can have a determinative role. My central concern is what that role should be.</page><page sequence="9">95] PALMER V. THOMPSON 103 III. SOME BASIC CONSTITUTIONAL CONCEPTS AND DOCTRINES Judicial review of motivation cannot be considered in isola- tion. The underlying concepts and policies are closely inter- dependent with those of constitutional review not concerned with legislative motive. A. THE ANATOMY OF A LAW OR DECISION 1. The paradigm case: the operative rule. The paradigm law has three components or attributes: (a) an operative rule, (b) objec- tives (or purposes), and (c) effects (or consequences or impact). The "operative47 rule" is the "law" itself: a generalized prescrip- tion that certain persons shall act, or that certain persons or objects shall be treated, in a certain manner under certain circumstances, for example: "All trucks must be equipped with exhaust emission control devices." An operative rule may be constitutionally "innocent," like the exhaust regulation, triggering only the demand for a rational justification;48 or it may be "suspect," for example, "No person of Japanese ancestry may remain in the following area," triggering the demand for an extraordinary justification;49 or it may simply be blatantly unconstitutional, for example, "Soldiers may, in time of peace, be quartered in houses without consent of the owners."50 Once the Court has determined that a particular suspect rule, for example, one commanding racial segregation in public schools, cannot be justified, the rule effectively becomes illicit. (I use "illicit" to refer to suspect rules that have been held unjustified as well as rules that are unconstitutional per se.)5' An operative rule may be overt, "No Chinese may operate laundries," or may be covert, as where the official charged with issuing permits to operate laundries grants them to Caucasians and denies them to Chinese, and no variable other than nationality ex- plains the pattern.52 47 I use the adjective "operative" to distinguish the kind of rule described in the text from, inter alia, rules of a different level of generality that guide or constrain the formulation of operative rules or criteria. 48 See text infra, at notes 62-69. 49 See text infra, at notes 71-84. 50 See note 70 infra. 51 1 employ the same usage with respect to suspect and unjustifiable motives. 52 See Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356 (1886).</page><page sequence="10">104 THE SUPREME COURT REVIEW [1971 An "operative rule" has one or more "objectives" or "purposes" -the state of affairs or effects that the decisionmaker53 seeks to establish or retain by promulgation of the rule.54 For example, the objective of the exhaust emission regulatiofi is to reduce exhaust emissions or, more generally, to reduce air pollution or, still more generally, to protect health or the environment.55 Every explicit or implicit distinction made by a law may have objectives. For example, the objective of limiting the exhaust regu- lation to trucks may be to impose the costs of emission control on those causing the most harm, on the assumption that trucks emit more, or more noxious, pollutants than automobiles, or on those best able to pay, on the assumption that those using trucks are better able to absorb the cost of an emission control device. Objectives may be constitutionally innocent (reducing air pol- lution), or suspect (segregating by race), or impermissible (dis- advantaging blacks or Catholics). To the extent that judicial review of legislative motivation is appropriate, characterizing an "objec- tive" in one of these ways has effects analogous to characterizing an "operative rule" in the same way.56" "Operative rules" produce "effects"-changes in the state of affairs. The effects may or may not be prescribed by a rule itself. For example, the migration of indigents into a state may be deterred 53 I use the term "decisionmaker" to refer to multimember governmental bodies- e.g., administrative agencies and legislatures-as well as to individual government officials. 54 An objective may also be described retrospectively, in terms of the mischief sought to be eliminated. Heydon's Case, 3 Co. Rep. 7a, 7b (1584). It is common, in the context of statutory construction, to talk of the law itself having an objective. This anthropomorphism is sometimes designed to buttress the assertion that the process of statutory construction is "not concerned with anything subjective," Frankfurter, Some Reflections on the Reading of Statutes, 47 COLUM. L. REV. 527, 539 (1947); see FULLER, THE MORALITY OF THE LAW 84-88 (1964), but it is sometimes merely a convenient ellipsis for the decisionmaker's purpose in adopting the rule. Only the latter use is apposite in the context of judicial review of legislative motiva- tion, where the court's ultimate concern is the decisionmaker's state of mind. 55 As the example in the text suggests, a rule's objectives can be described more or less immediately. The notion that a viable distinction can be drawn between "mo- tive" and "purpose," based on the immediacy of the objective inquired into, has properly been put to rest by several recent commentators. See Ely, at 1217-21; Note, Legislative Purpose and Federal Constitutional Adjudication, 83 HARV. L. REV. 1887-88, n.1 (1970). 56 See text infra, at notes 109-16.</page><page sequence="11">95] PALMER V. THOMPSON 105 by a law that provides, "No indigent may enter the state,""7 or by a law that establishes a one-year period of residency for welfare eligibility."5 Effects may or may not be objectives of the operative rule.59 For example, the welfare residence requirement might be enacted for the purpose of deterring the immigration of indigents, or to serve administrative ends.60 In some circumstances, the gov- ernment cannot allow certain effects to occur, even though the operative rule and its objectives are themselves innocent."1 2. Two nonparadigmatic cases: the operative criterion and the ad hoc decision. Not all governmental action is conducted pursuant to operative rules. The factors entering into a decision may be numerous and nonquantifiable, making the formulation of a rule impracticable or impossible. For example, a park commissioner, in deciding where to locate a playground, may consider the costs of land acquisition and development, the proximity of a site to existing recreational facilities, traffic hazards, and numerous other factors. He even may have a checklist of "operative criteria" that he considers in each case, and he may consistently weigh some fac- tors more heavily than others. But he has no formula-no rule- that, given each of the inputs, can generate a result. For my purposes here, a fixed set of operative criteria to which the decisionmaker systematically resorts is equivalent to a rule. Like a rule, a criterion may itself be, and may have objectives that are, innocent, suspect, or impermissible. Some governmental decisions are nonsystematic or ad hoc. These are not made according to any checklist or set of preexisting cri- teria, and the decisionmaker may give no thought to reconciling the action with past decisions or treating like cases alike in the future. For example, the park commissioner may not have devel- oped guidelines for playground location, either because he seldom makes such decisions or simply because he operates unsystematically. To characterize a decision as ad hoc does not mean that it is 57 See Edwards v. California, 314 U.S. 160 (1941). 58 See Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618 (1969). 59 This means that for purposes of judicial review of motivation a decisionmaker does not necessarily have as his objective all of the foreseen consequences of his decision. See PROSSER, LAW OF TORTS 31 (4th ed. 1971); A.L.I., RESTATEMENT (SEcoND) OF TORTS, ? 8A, comment b (1955). 60 See Shapiro v.

The commissioner may be able to provide good reasons for choosing site X rather than sites Y or Z. Indeed, he may give the same reasons as the commissioner who follows criteria. B. THE "RATIONAL RELATION" STANDARDS The Due Process clauses require that an operative rule bear a rational relation to a constitutionally permissible objective.62 This means that the rule must produce effects that advance, rather than retard or have no bearing on, the attainment of a permissible objective.63 Every governmental action imposes costs or confers benefits on some persons but not on others. The traditional equal protection standard requires that the differential treatment mandated by an operative rule bear a rational relation to a permissible objective.64 Adjudication under the traditional due process and equal pro- tection standards might seem to involve empirical questions. In practice it does not. The courts stand ready to assume any rea- sonably conceivable state of facts65 that relates the regulation to any reasonably conceivable permissible objective.66 The class of 62 See Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 U.S. 726, 733 (1963) (Harlan, J., concurring); Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U.S. 483 (1955); Nebbia v. New York, 291 U.S. 502 (1934). 63 But of. FREUND, ON UNDERSTANDING THE SUPREME COURT 88-89 (1949). Freund suggests that it is sufficient that reasonable legislators could believe that the rule would produce such effects. 64 "[T]he classification must be reasonable, not arbitrary, and must rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation, so that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike." Royster Guano Co. v. Virginia, 253 U.S. 412, 415 (1920). Despite the surface simi- larity of the due process and equal protection criteria, equal protection adjudication incorporates an element of subjectivity that is absent in adjudication under a Due Process Clause. For example, the chief equal protection vices are over- and under- inclusion, see Tussman &amp; tenBroek, The Equal Protection of the Laws, 37 CALIF. L. REV. 341 (1949), but a classification "does not offend the Constitution simply be- cause [it] 'is not made with mathematical nicety or because in practice it results in some inequality.' " Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471, 485 (1970). The degree of permissible departure from strict congruence cannot be determined by any formula, but depends ultimately on an exercise of judgment. 65 McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420, 426 (1961). 66 See, e.g., Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U.S. 603 (1960); Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U.S. 483 (1955); Kotch v. Board of River Pilot Commissioners, 330 U.S. 552 (1947); Daniel v. Family Security Life Ins. Co., 336 U.S. 220 (1949); Railway</page><page sequence="13">95] PALMER V. THOMPSON 107 impermissible objectives is small,"' and the class of permissible ones is as broad as "the general welfare." The decisionmaker has vir- tually plenary authority to choose which objectives to promote at the expense of which others, and to determine what costs shall be incurred to promote the objectives and on whom those costs shall be placed."8 With two possible exceptions,"6 every governmental decision must meet these minimal due process and equal protection stan- dards of rationality. To trigger judicial review a complainant need only demonstrate that the regulation operates to his disadvantage (due process) or to his comparative disadvantage (equal protec- tion). On this showing, the Court inquires whether the rule is rationally related to a plausible licit objective. The complainant wins or loses, depending on the answer. C. THE DEMAND FOR AN EXTRAORDINARY JUSTIFICATION The traditional due process and equal protection standards do not explain most constitutional doctrines developed under the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment. Some operative rules that are rationally related to legitimate objectives are simply forbidden by the Constitution.70 Others are Express Agency v. New York, 336 U.S. 106 (1949). This broad statement may have exceptions, see Ely, at 1225-26, but they are not germane to the approach to motivation developed here, cf. id. at 1227, n.75. 67 See text infra, at note 109. 68 Judgments allocating costs and benefits among the parties affected by a deci- sion may not usually be subject to analysis under the due process or the equal pro- tection rationality standards. See Ely, at 1246-49. Nonetheless, a decisionmaker's dis- tributive judgment may be so far afield from shared notions of fairness or appro- priate cost-benefit trade-offs that a court would invalidate the law, deeming it "ir- rational." Cf. BICKEL, note 2 supra, at 35-46; Butler v. Michigan, 352 U.S. 380 (1957). But "rationality" in this sense is value-dependent in a way that the minimal standard described in the text is not. 69 See text infra, at notes 183-204. 70 Whether a rule is forbidden or only "suspect" depends in large measure on the Court's methodology and on philosophical differences among the Justices. See, e.g., Note, Civil Disabilities and the First Amendment, 78 YALE L.J. 842 (1969) (comparing the "balancing" and "classificatory" approaches to First Amendment adjudication); LOCKHART, KAMISAR, &amp; CHOPER, CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 883-93 (3d ed. 1970) (excerpting materials on "balancing" vs. "absolutism"). Nonetheless, there are some laws that all Justices would agree are flatly forbidden by the Constitution -for example, a law establishing and financing a government-operated church.

For example, a law classifying persons on the basis of race is "suspect." Even though it is "enacted pursuant to a valid state.interest, [it] bears a heavy burden of justification . .. and will be upheld only if it is necessary, and not merely rationally related, to the accomplishment of a per- missible state policy."71 Laws that impose punishments or disabil- ities because of a person's political associations or the content of his speech trigger a similar demand.72 To satisfy the demand for an extraordinary justification, the law must be narrowly drawn73 to serve significant state interests,7" and there must not exist "less onerous" means of serving those interests.75 Review under these standards, of course, requires the court to reassess the legislative decision by balancing the benefits accruing to the government against the costs imposed on those adversely affected by the law.76 The extraordinary justification required in these and similar kinds of cases is not contingent upon a finding of illicit motivation,77 nor is it triggered by the adverse impact of the rule upon a racial or political minority: the criterion itself initiates the demand for an extraordinary justification. Motivation and impact, however, 71 McLaughlin v. Florida, 379 U.S. 184, 196 (1964). Although the Supreme Court has only once upheld a racial or ethnic classification, see Korematsu v. United States, 323 U.S. 214 (1944), the distinction between suspect and illicit criteria under the Equal Protection Clause is not entirely academic. Classifications based on alien- age and sex-if sex becomes a suspect basis for classification, compare Sail'er Inn, Inc. v. Kirby, 5 Cal.3d 1 (1971), with Goesaert v.

THOMPSON 109 play an important role in the Court's decision to hold certain criteria "suspect." For example, it is highly probable that a racial classification reflects prejudice on the decisionmaker's part. Largely for this reason, minorities perceive racial classifications as insulting or stigmatic. Such classifications also have an anti-educative effect of legitimizing prejudice.78 Moreover, the employment of racial classifications over the long run is likely to deprive members of the minority of their "fair share" of the benefits distributed by society, solely because of their race.79 These same considerations entail that a law which does not mandate racially disparate treatment may nonetheless trigger the demand for an extraordinary justification if race plays any opera- tive role. For example, courts have invalidated state laws providing that the governor shall assume control over any school that be- comes integrated,s8 that integrated schools shall or may be closed,81 and that tuition grants shall be made available to any student (black or white) who otherwise would be required to attend an integrated school.82 The cases assume that the state may structure the control of its schools as it deems fit, that it need not provide any public education at all,83 and that the grants themselves are 78 See Kaplan, Equal Justice in an Unequal World: Equality for the Negro-the Problem of Special Treatment, 61 Nw. U. L. REv. 363, 379-80 (1966). 79 Cf. United States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U.S. 144, 152, n.4 (1938); Michel- man, Property, Utility and Fairness: Comments on the Ethical Foundations of "Just Compensation" Law, 80 HARV. L. REv. 1165, 1218-22 (1967). The reasons for requiring an extraordinary justification for laws penalizing speech and association lie largely in the effect of such laws. Under our received political theory, deterring speech not only imposes direct costs on the speaker and his willing listener, but imposes external costs on society by depriving it of the full consider- ation of diverse viewpoints on different issues. See MILL, ON LIBERTY, ch. 2 (1859). To allow government to interfere with speech, moreover, endangers the precondi- tions of a democratic polity. so E.g., James v. Almond, 170 F. Supp. 331 (E.D. Va. 1959), appeal dismissed, 359 U.S. 1006 (1959). st E.g., Bush v. Orleans Parish School Bd., 187 F. Supp. 42 (E.D. La. 1960), aff'd, 365 U.S. 569 (1961). 82 Hawkins v. North Carolina State Bd. of Educ., Civ. No. 2067 (31 March 1966), 11 RACE REL. L. REP. 745 (1966). 83 Some of the cases and commentaries dealing with school closings focus on the comparison between the pupils in the district in which the schools are abandoned and pupils attending public schools in the remainder of the state, implying that this is the inequality that must be justified. See, e.g., Griffin v. County School Bd., 377 U.S. 218 (1964); Horowitz &amp; Neitring, Equal Protection Aspects of Inequalities in</page><page sequence="16">110 THE SUPREME COURT REVIEW [1971 constitutional.84 But when implementation of these practices is explicitly triggered by integration, they-and the triggering itself- give rise to the dangers that make racial classifications "suspect." D. THE ROLE OF "IMPACT" The "impact" of a law generally has had little or no constitu- tional significance independent of a suspect operative rule. For example, although rules classifying persons on the basis of poverty and race are suspect, the demand for an extraordinary justification is not triggered by the adoption of a fixed license fee or sales tax, which falls more heavily on the poor, nor by the enactment and enforcement of criminal laws that may disproportionately burden particular ethnic minorities. It would be both impracticable and undesirable to require decisionmakers to assure that all decisions have an equal effect on rich and poor alike and on all races.85 In some circumstances, however, impact alone may trigger the demand for an extraordinary justification. This is the suggestion of some of the "new" equal protection cases which hold that, in the absence of a suspect classification-or of any classification at all186-governmental action that adversely affects a "fundamental interest" is permissible only if it serves "compelling" state interests.87 Public Education and Public Assistance Programs from Place to Place within a State, 15 U.C.L.A. L. REV. 787 (1968). But the policies that support holding an integration-triggered school closing "suspect" do not depend on interdistrict dis- parities. The same result should obtain if, under such a statute, every school district in the state was integrated and therefore closed. See Ely, at 1295. 84 Whether and when tuition grants are unconstitutional simply because the state is supporting private segregated schools remain open questions. Compare, e.g., Griffin v. State Bd. of Educ., 239 F. Supp. 560 (E.D. Va. 1965), with Coffey v. State Educational Finance Commission, 296 F. Supp. 1389 (S.D. Miss. 1969), and Green v. Kennedy, 309 F. Supp. 1127 (D.D.C. 1970), appeal dismissed sub nom. Can- non v. Green, 398 U.S. 956 (1970). See Poindexter v. Louisiana Financial Assistance Comm'n, 296 F. Supp. 686 (E.D. La. 1968), aff'd, 393 U.S. 17 (1968); Lee v. Macon Bd. of Educ., 267 F. Supp. 458 (M.D. Ala. 1967), aff'd sub nomn. Wallace v.

REV. 157, 176-77 (1963). 86 For example, although no law forbids indigent criminal defendants from re- taining appellate counsel, the personal interest in freedom from the stigma of a conviction and the possibility of incarceration or fine compels the state to provide counsel to those who cannot afford it. See Douglas v. California, 372 U.S. 353 (1963). 87 See Shapiro v.

THOMPSON 111 IV. WHAT IS "MOTIVATION"? Distinction should be made between two inquiries: (a) What (if any) operative rule is the decisionmaker systematically employing? (b) Why did the decisionmaker make a particular decision? Both of these sometimes have been subsumed under the inquiry into "motivation,"88 and they do have some characteristics in common. They are analytically distinct, however, and I believe that the term "motivation" is most usefully reserved for the latter inquiry, which focuses on the process by which a rule was adopted rather than on the content of the rule itself. A. WHAT OPERATIVE RULE IS THE DECISIONMAKER SYSTEMATICALLY EMPLOYING? If a state college lists among its formal prerequisites for admis- sion the requirement that an applicant be white, this would demand an extraordinary justification, which probably could not be forth- coming. But the college might be more circumspect, and not pub- lish its rule. That the rule is made manifest only through sys- tematic application does not make it less "real"-or less harmfuls9 -than an overt regulation."9 Courts generally have been willing to inquire whether a deci- sionmaker systematically employs an illicit or suspect operative rule and to enjoin the decisionmaker from continuing to apply it."l Return of the "Natural-Law-Due-Process Formula," 16 U.C.L.A. REv. 716 (1969); Note, note 75 supra, at 1087-1132 (1969); CooNs, CLUNE, &amp; SUGARMAN, PRIVATE WEALTH AND PUBLIC EDUCATION, ch. 10 (1970). Impact may play a similar role in cases involving state burdens on interstate commerce, e.g., Bibb v. Navajo Freight Lines, Inc., 359 U.S. 520 (1959); Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona, 325 U.S. 761 (1945), and nonsubstantive burdens on the exercise of speech, e.g., Martin v. Struthers, 319 U.S. 141 (1943); Schneider v. State, 308 U.S. 147 (1939). 88 See, e.g., Ely, at 1257-61; BICKEL, note 2 supra, at 208-21; Note, note 75 supra, at 1091-1101. 89 See text supra, at notes 77-79. If the rule is so well concealed that neither the public nor the rejected applicant knows of its existence, the anti-educative and stigmatic harms are eliminated, but this seldom happens, or at least such concealment when successful prevents the question from being raised. 90 For this reason, a covert operative rule, once discovered, should trigger the same demand for a defense that would be triggered by an overt rule having the same content. Cf. Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356 (1886). But see Ely, at 1277 n.208, discussed in text infra, at notes 191-96. 91 Relief of this nature, without relief with respect to any particular alleged ap- plication of the rule, sometimes is sought in civil actions brought by the Government</page><page sequence="18">112 THE SUPREME COURT REVIEW [1971 In Yick Wo v. Hopkins,92 for example, the Supreme Court inferred from the San Francisco Board of Supervisors' pattern of granting and denying laundry permits that the board was systematically denying permits to Chinese applicants because of their nationality. Determinations of this sort are at the core of decisions finding unlawful patterns of discrimination in jury selection,93 employ- ment,94 voter registration,95 and pupil and teacher assignments.96 B. WHY DID THE DECISIONMAKER MAKE A PARTICULAR DECISION? In contrast to the inquiry just described, a court may be asked to determine how the decisionmaker arrived at this particular deci- sion. The decision in question may be one of specific applicability (for example, the state college's rejection of Smith's application), or it may consist of the adoption of a rule or criterion of general applicability (for example, the legislature's enactment of a law requiring one year's residence in the state for eligibility for welfare benefits). The decision may itself have been made either by refer- ence to a rule of general applicability or by an ad hoc process. 1. The rule-generated decision. To say that a decisionmaker sys- tematically follows an operative rule means that cases coming within the terms of the rule must be controlled by it." But this does and in private class actions. For example, most school desegregation actions do not request that the named plaintiffs be allowed to attend any particular school, but rather that the school system as a whole be desegregated. See also Turner v. Fouche, 396 U.S. 346 (1970) (affirmative action to end school board discrimina- tion); Note, Developments in the Law-Employment Discrimination and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 84 HARV. L. REV. 1109, 1242 (1971). 92 118 U.S. 356 (1886). The ordinance made it unlawful to maintain a laundry in a wooden building without a license. The Court assumed that the law was fair on its face, but concluded that it was being discriminatorily administered: all 200 Chinese applicants were refused licenses; the applications of all but one of 80-odd Caucasian applicants were granted. 93 See Finkelstein, The Application of Statistical Decision Theory to the Jury Discrimination Cases, 80 HARV. L. REV. 338 (1966), and cases discused in id. at 340-49. 94 See, e.g., Parham v. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., 433 F.2d 421 (8th Cir. 1970) (Title VII). 95 See, e.g., Turner v. Fouche, 396 U.S. 346 (1970); United States v. Duke, 332 F.2d 759 (Sth Cir. 1964). 96 See, e.g., Davis v. Pontiac School District, 443 F.2d 573 (6th Cir. 1971); Hob- son v. Hansen, 269 F.

Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 25-26 (1971). 97 Of course, the rule may have exceptions. But, as Professor Ronald Dworkin has suggested in another context, "then it is inaccurate and incomplete to state the</page><page sequence="19">95] PALMER V. THOMPSON 113 not entail that any particular decision that could have been gen- erated by the rule was generated by it: a rule is a sufficient, but often not a necessary, condition for a given result. If a state college adheres to the rule, "reject blacks," then the fact that Smith is black is a sufficient ground for rejecting his application. But the college may never have considered Jones's race (or even have known that he was black) before rejecting his application: Jones was taken out of the running because his grades or College Board scores were below the college's cut-off. All other things being equal, the fact that a decisionmaker is known to follow a rule lends support to the inference that a par- ticular decision consistent with the rule was generated by it. Courts have been willing to make this inference.98 In the face of such a rule, the courts sometimes have shifted to the decisionmaker the burden of proving that a particular decision-for example, the rejection of an applicant for admission to college or for a job- was not an instance of the application of an impermissible rule.99 2. The ad hoc (specific) decision. Particular decisions often are not made pursuant to rules. A state college may have no racial criteria and, indeed, may have many black students. But the dean of admissions had an unpleasant encounter with a black student just before he considered Carter's application for admission. Tem- porarily entertaining some racial animus, the dean rejected Car- ter's application because Carter was black. Courts sometimes have been willing to determine whether an ad hoc decision was based on the decisionmaker's consideration of an impermisible factor.100 But sometimes, as in Palmer v. Thomp- rule so simply, without enumerating the exceptions." Dworkin, The Model of Rules, 35 U. CHI. L. REV. 14, 25 (1967). The point made in the text applies to sys- tematically applied operative criteria as well-for example, to the college's giving positive weight to the fact that an applicant is white or black. 98 E.g., Meredith v. Fair, 305 F.2d 343 (5th Cir. 1962); Alabama v. United States, 304 F.2d 583 (5th Cir.), aff'd, 371 U.S. 37 (1962); Lucy v. Adams, 134 F. Supp. 235 (N.D.

The decision to adopt a rule of general applicability. Rules themselves are seldom, if ever, generated by higher-level (rule- generating) rules. Rather they are adopted through an ad hoc process in which the decisionmaker considers and weighs a large variety of factors.'01 Just as someone making an ad hoc decision of specific applicability (deciding whether to admit Carter to col- lege) can consider an impermissible factor (Carter's race), so too can a decisionmaker give weight to an impermissible factor in promulgating a general rule that is innocent on its face. For exam- ple, a state legislature may adopt a stringent voting literacy test for the purpose of excluding Negroes from the franchise.102 An inquiry to determine whether a decisionmaker considered constitutionally impermissible factors-or entertained constitu- tionally impermissible objectives-in adopting a rule of general applicability is the archetypal inquiry into "legislative motiva- tion."103 C. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TWO INQUIRIES The two inquiries just described differ in several respects, one of which is analytically significant.'04 The first inquiry aims at 101 Of course, a decisionmaker may systematically measure a proposed rule against certain general principles-justice, constitutionality, efficiency, and the like. But these are not sufficiently precise or complete to determine the content of a particu- lar rule. Many such principles are constraints rather than affirmative guidelines. 102 See cases cited in note 133 infra. 103 See, e.g., United States v. O'Brien, note 26 supra. 104 The main operational difference lies in the methods of proof. The method- ology for establishing that a decisionmaker is covertly employing an illicit operative rule or criterion has been basically that of statistical analysis. The court hypothe- sizes the illicit rule ("reject Blacks"), posits other factors (grades, test scores) that could conceivably explain the decisionmaker's pattern of conduct, and assesses the likelihood that one or another factor-or randomness-accounts for the decision- maker's behavior. In testing a hypothesized operative rule one usually can identify a relevant datum (an application for admission and the college's disposition of it) quite precisely, and enough events often have occurred to allow control for other possible explanatory variables. The determination that a particular decision was illicitly motivated-that it was generated by an illicit operative rule or that it was an ad hoc decision based on the consideration of illicit factors-typically depends on more intuitive and impression-</page><page sequence="21">95] PALMER V. THOMPSON 115 determining the content of a covert operative rule; and an imper- missible operative rule, whether it is overtly promulgated or con- cealed, is substantively, and hence permanently, invalid. The sec- ond inquiry focuses on the process by which the rule or decision was made; it asks what criteria or objectives the decisionmaker took into account. The court does not hold the decision substan- tively invalid-it does not hold that an applicant excluded from college because of his race is entitled to attend the college, or that a state may not employ a difficult literacy test. It requires only that the college not exclude an applicant because he is black,105 and that the state not adopt the literacy test in order to disfranchise blacks.1'6 A legislative decision held invalid because it was imper- missibly motivated may in theory be made again, in identical form, provided only that it is made for licit reasons.1 7 In general, the courts have reserved the characterization "mo- tivation" for the subject of the second inquiry-the inquiry to determine whether impermissible criteria or objectives played a role in the decisionmaking process when the same result might have been achieved by the consideration of legitimate criteria or justified in terms of legitimate objectives. And it is this that is the subject of this article. V. THE CASE FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW OF MOTIVATION To my knowledge, no court or commentator has articulated the case for judicial review of legislative and administrative motiva- tion.108 The reasons supporting such review have, perhaps, seemed so obvious as not to call for elaboration. In fact, the full argument is moderately complex. istic inferences. Statistical techniques generally are of less assistance in explaining the basis for a particular decision than in explaining the basis for a pattern of de- cisions. It often is not clear what events count as salient data for the inference, the sample is likely to be small, and the data are likely to consist of events so lacking in similarity as to preclude systematic analysis. Nonetheless, as I suggest below, see text infra, at notes 126-39, the determination of motivation often can be made with certi- tude sufficient to support a judgment invalidating the decision. 105 See, e.g., Lucy v. Adams, 134 F. Supp. 235 (N.D. Ala. 1955), aff'd, 228 F.2d 619 (5th Cir. 1955). 106 See generally text infra, at notes 107-14. 107 See generally text infra, at notes 145-57. 108 But cf. text infra, at note 215.</page><page sequence="22">116 THE SUPREME COURT REVIEW [1971 A. ILLICIT MOTIVATION The following four points set out what I believe to be the cen- tral argument for judicial invalidation of an illicitly motivated law. 1. Governments are constitutionally prohibited from pursuing certain objectives-for example, the disadvantaging of a racial group, the suppression of a religion, or the deterring of interstate migration.'09 2. The fact that a decisionmaker gives weight to an illicit ob- jective may determine the outcome of the decision. The decision- making process consists of weighing the foreseeable and desirable consequences of the proposed decision against its foreseeable costs. Considerations of distributive fairness play an important role. To the extent that the decisionmaker is illicitly motivated, he treats as a desirable consequence one to which the lawfully motivated deci- sionmaker would be indifferent or which he would view as undesirable. 3. Assuming that a person has no legitimate complaint against a particular decision merely because it affects him adversely, he does have a legitimate complaint if it would not have been adopted but for the decisionmaker's consideration of illicit objectives. If in fact the rule adopted is useful and fair, the adversely affected party might have no legitimate grievance, whatever considerations went into its adoption."o In our governmental system, however, only the 109 See, e.g., Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618, 627-31 (1969). These particular objectives are proscribed because their pursuit is detrimental to society at large, or because it is unjust to disadvantage persons for possessing certain attributes, or for both reasons. A decision made for the purpose of disadvantaging a particular racial, ethnic, or religious minority, moreover, inflicts a stigmatic injury distinct from the operative consequences of the law: the act of adoption is itself an official insult to the minority. The proposition in the text has operative consequences apart from judicial review of motivation. First, an illicit objective cannot be proffered in defense of a law sub- ject to the requirement of a rational or extraordinary justification. See id. Second, the decisionmaker himself is obligated not to take account of illicit objectives. See U.S. Const. Art. VI, ? 3; cf. MORGAN, CONGRESS AND THE CONSTITUTION (1966). In addition, Congress may enact legislation responsive to its own findings that state decisionmakers have acted out of impermissible motives. See, e.g., Oregon v. Mitch- ell, 400 U.S. 112 (1970); Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U.S. 641 (1966). 110 A member of a minority group does have a complaint against being subjected to the opprobrium emanating from even a "good" decision adopted for discrimina- tory reasons.</page><page sequence="23">95] PALMER V. THOMPSON 117 political decisionmaker-and not the judiciary111-has general au- thority to assess the utility and fairness of a decision. And, since the decisionmaker has (by hypothesis) assigned an incorrect value to a relevant factor, the party has been deprived of his only oppor- tunity for a full, proper assessment.112 4. If the decisionmaker gave weight to an illicit objective, the court should presume that his consideration of the objective deter- mined the outcome of the decision and should invalidate the deci- sion in the absence of clear proof to the contrary. Evidence suffi- cient to establish that the decisionmaker gave any weight to an illicit objective will also often establish that the decision would not have been made but for the pursuit of that objective.11" A com- plainant may, however, prove clearly and convincingly that the decisionmaker gave weight to an illicit objective and yet fail to establish with equal certainty that this affected the outcome of the decision. It is conceivable-though seldom likely-that the same 111 Where an extraordinary justification is required, text supra, at notes 70-84, the court undertakes a limited assessment of the law's utility and fairness. But, compared to the decisionmaker's authority, the scope of judicial review is very narrowly cir- cumscribed. The Equal Protection Clause does not, for example, embody all prin- ciples of fairness, whatever they may be and however they are to be determined. 112 This may seem to prove too much, for a person affected adversely by a de- cision has a grievance of sorts whenever the decisionmaker has not adequately con- sidered its pros and cons. Since this grievance generally is not judicially cognizable, why should it become cognizable merely because the decisionmaker allegedly pur- sued constitutionally illicit objectives? Although the decisionmaking process is sometimes constrained by formal pro- cedural requirements designed to maximize the decisionmaker's consideration of relevant factors, see, e.g., 1 DAVIS, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW TREATISE, ch. 6 (1958) (rule- making), it is doubtful whether one could formulate workable standards for exam- ining generally whether the decisionmaker really considered the matter adequately. It is doubtful in any case that the potential benefits from such review would out- weigh the burden on the judiciary and the costs of judicial intrusion into the de- cisionmaking process. The costs of judicial inquiry into constitutionally illicit motivation are likely to be smaller, and the benefits greater. By contrast to the open-ended question, "Has the decisionmaker adequately considered all points of view?" the inquiry into moti- vation is narrow: "Did the decisionmaker give weight to a particular illicit objec- tive?" The chief methods for conducting the latter inquiry do not require judicial scrutiny of the internal workings of the decisionmaking process. Furthermore, illicitly motivated decisions are more likely than ill-considered decisions in general to be systematically unjust and injurious to those "discrete and insular" minorities, United States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U.S. 144, 152-53, n.4 (1936), for whose protection certain objectives are constitutionally proscribed. 113 See text infra, at notes 126-39.</page><page sequence="24">118 THE SUPREME COURT REVIEW [1971 decision would have been made even in the absence of illicit mo- tivation. In this case, proof that the decisionmaker took account of an illicit objective rebuts whatever presumption of regularity otherwise attaches. For this reason, and because of the constitu- tional interests at stake, the court should place on the decision- maker a heavy burden of proving that his illicit objective was not determinative of the outcome."4 B. SUSPECT MOTIVATION A court may find that an operative rule innocent on its face was adopted with the objective of causing a result such that, had the operative rule in terms mandated that result, the rule would have been deemed constitutionally "suspect." For example, the court may find that an operative rule that does not classify by race has the purpose (and effect) of segregating by race. It would be inappropriate to hold that the motivation as such invalidated the rule, for even if the rule explicitly classified by race it would not automatically fall, but would only trigger the demand for an extraordinary justification. It would be equally inappropriate to treat the motivation as innocent. For the same considerations that render an explicit racial classification suspect- the probability of an underlying prejudicial motivation, the anti- educative effects, and the dangers of systematic injury to minor- ities15-apply as well to the decisionmaker's objective of classifying on the basis of race. The appropriate solution is to treat the objective itself as "sus- pect.""6 If an operative rule mandating segregation under the cir- cumstances could be justified by a compelling state interest, the decisionmaker's motivation is licit. If the operative rule could not be justified, the decisionmaker's motivation should invalidate the decision-for the same reasons that his consideration of an objec- tive that is illicit per se should invalidate it. 114 The closest analogy is the test for harmless constitutional error in criminal cases. See Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18 (1967). The fact that the decision- maker is known to have taken account of constitutionally illicit objectives, cf. 7 MOORE, FEDERAL PRACTICE, ? 61.07[3] (2d ed. 1970), together with the probability that the objectives were outcome-determinative, make the usual harmless error test, see, e.g., Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 61, irrelevant. 115 See text supra, at notes 78-79. 116 See Hunter v. Erickson, 393 U.S. 385, 393 (1969) (Harlan, J., concurring).

THE ARGUMENTS AGAINST JUDICIAL REVIEW Palmer's and O'Brien's objections to judicial review of mo- tivation concern the difficulty of ascertaining motivation and the futility of invalidating an otherwise permissible law. Professors Tussman and tenBroek have suggested a third objection: the dis- utility of invalidating what may otherwise be a perfectly good law."' And one also can find in some of the commentaries a fourth objection, based on the general impropriety of the inquiry. 18 A. ASCERTAINABILITY Mr. Justice Black asserted in Palmer that it is generally "ex- tremely difficult" to determine a decisionmaker's motivation and that it is especially difficult, or impossible, "to determine the 'sole' or 'dominant' motivation behind the choices of a group of legis- lators."119 I shall consider these propositions in reverse order. 1. " 'Sole' or 'dominant' motivation." A complainant who can prove that, but for the decisionmaker's desire to promote an illicit objective, the decision would not have been made, should clearly have won his case.12o But such rigorous proof is not essential. It should suffice to demonstrate that illicit motivation played a non- trivial part in the decisionmaking process, so that it might have affected the outcome.121 Whichever of these ways one poses the inquiry, it is inappropriate to ask which of several possible objec- tives was "sole" or "dominant" in the decisionmaker's mind:122 an illicit motive may have been "subordinate" and yet have determined the outcome of the decision.123 117 Tussman &amp; tenBroek, note 64 supra, at 360. Professor Ely suggests that the Court voices this objection in O'Brien, see note 158 infra, but if so, it does so only obliquely. 118 See text infra, at notes 161-68. 119 403 U.S. at 224-25. 120 See text supra, at note 113. 121 Ibid. 122 Compare Green Street Ass'n v. Daley, 373 F.2d 1 (7th Cir. 1967) (demanding proof of "sole" motivation), with Local 53 v. Vogler, 407 F.2d 1047, 1054 (5th Cir. 1969) (demanding, in a Title VII case, only that a union rule "arise at least in part from racial bases"). 123 Thus, it is incorrect to pose the question of motivation: did the decisionmaker make this decision to serve legitimate or to serve illicit purposes-e.g., did the su- perintendent adopt an ability grouping plan in order to promote educational achievement or to promote segregation? It is entirely possible that he had both ob- jectives in mind, but the rule should be invalidated if the illicit objective played any material role in the decision.</page><page sequence="26">120 THE SUPREME COURT REVIEW [1971 Nothing in the nature of a multimember decisionmaking body makes the search for sole or dominant motivation more appropriate than in the case of a single decisionmaker.124 Indeed, as the dis- cussion below suggests, the main techniques for determining moti- vation treat the multimember body as di unit no different from the single decisionmaker. 2. The general difficulty. It is often impossible to establish that a decisionmaker entertained an illicit or suspect objective. But this does not justify a blanket refusal to undertake the inquiry if a decisionmaker's motivation can sometimes be determined with ade- quate certainty. And the Supreme Court and lower courts have rested judgments on findings of improper motivation-on records supporting those findings beyond serious dispute.125 In view of the doubts that have been expressed over the possibility of ascertaining motivation, I shall identify some general recurrent bases for such findings. a) Circumstantial evidence. The chief method of ascertaining a decisionmaker's motivation involves the drawing of inferences from his conduct, viewed in the context of antecedent and con- 124 The observation of the preceding paragraph has, however, a corollary where the decisionmaker is a multimember body-for example, a legislature. If "legislative intent" is ever relevant for purposes of statutory construction, it is the intent of a majority of the legislators that counts. This has led Professor Ely to suggest that "the only motivations on the basis of which the Court would even consider . . . [invali- dating a law] or, indeed, a litigant would have the temerity to suggest that it do so- are those which can confidently be said to have been shared by a majority of the decisionmakers." Ely, at 1219-20, 1268. But the matter is not so simple. The relevant question, again, is whether considerations of illicit motivation affected the outcome of the decisionmaking process. Thus, in theory, it should suffice to show that the decisions of those members whose votes were necessary for enactment of the chal- lenged law were improperly motivated. (This should be qualified by the possibility that some legislators, who otherwise would support a measure for legitimate reasons, might vote against it because others were supporting it for avowedly illicit reasons.) The point is largely academic, however. Whether the relevant class is a majority of the legislators or only those legislators whose votes are necessary for the enactment, neither head-count usually is feasible-or necessary.

The process does not differ from that of inferring ultimate facts from basic facts in other areas of the law. It is grounded in an experiential, intuitive assessment of the likelihood that the decision was designed to further one or another objective. The content of the operative rule may itself provide strong evidence of improper motivation. In Gomillion v. Lightfoot,126 for example, the probability that a nonracially motivated delinea- tion of Tuskegee's boundaries would have the effect it did is so minimal that, even without knowledge of the racial attitudes prev- alent in Alabama,127 one could not but conclude that the law was designed to exclude Negroes from the city.128 Similarly, in United States v. Kahriger,129 Mr. Justice Frankfurter-no partisan of in- quiries into motivation-concluded from the "detailed scheme of administration [of the wagering tax laws] beyond the [govern- ment's] obvious fiscal needs," that "what was formally a means of raising revenue for the Federal Government was essentially an effort to check if not to stamp out professional gambling."130 Mr. Justice Frankfurter's analysis suggests that the merits-the desirability-of a law may constitute evidence of the motivation underlying it. The courts possess no general authority to invalidate a decision because it is "undesirable," and an allegation of illicit motivation does not enlarge their authority. A conscientious deci- sionmaker, however, considers the costs of a proposal, its con- duciveness to the ends sought to be attained, and the availability of 126 See text supra, at notes 34-35. 127 But it would be proper for a court to take judicial notice of these attitudes. Cf. N.A.A.C.P. v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 435-36 (1963); Johnson v. Branch, 364 F.2d 177, 182 (4th Cir. 1966). See generally 9 WIGMORE, EVIDENCE ?? 2580, 2583 (3d ed., 1940). 128 See also Grosjean v. American Press Co., 297 U.S. 233 (1936), where a tax levied on Louisiana newspapers with circulations over 20,000 happened to fall on all publishers opposed to the Long regime, but on only one friendly publisher. See Ely, at 1330-34. 129 345 U.S. 22 (1953). 130 Id. at 39 (dissenting opinion). The Court in Kahriger, as in other post-1937 decisions concerning the scope of national powers, e.g., United States v. Darby, 312 U.S. 100, 115 (1941), eschewed the inquiry into motivation not (or not so much) because of functional difficulties with the inquiry, but because what was formerly deemed to be an impermissible purpose, see, e.g., United States v. Constantine, 296 U.S. 287 (1935); Bailey v. Drexel Furniture Co., 259 U.S. 20 (1922), was now held legitimate. See Ely, at 1302-06.</page><page sequence="28">122 THE SUPREME COURT REVIEW [1971 alternatives less costly to the community as a whole or to a par- ticular segment of the community. That a decision obviously fails to reflect these considerations with respect to any legitimate objec- tive supports the inference that it was improperly motivated. For example, a court would not question a city's decision to locate a park at site X rather, than site Y, merely because X seemed extremely costly, unattractive, and inaccessible, while Y seemed ideal. But this information, taken together with the fact that site X is the proposed location for a private interracial housing devel- opment strongly opposed by the white community, supports the inference that X was chosen to thwart construction of the proj- ect.131 Similarly, the fact that a regulation, though minimally re- lated to the promotion of health or educational achievement, is poorly or dubiously suited to its supposed legitimate objectives, would lend support to other evidence of illicit motivation.132 The juxtaposition of a decision with some prior event or se- quence of events often bears on the inference of illicit motivation. The following chronological sequence, for example, is typical of a variety of cases: the decisionmaker enforces a discriminatory opera- tive rule; a court enjoins this practice; the decisionmaker then adopts a constitutionally "innocent" rule that effectively main- tains the status quo ante. For example, state voting officials are 131 Cf. Progress Dev. Corp. v. Mitchell, 286 F.2d 222 (7th Cir. 1961); Deerfield Park District v. Progress Dev. Corp., 22 Ill. 2d 132 (1961). Sometimes a court may be able to obtain more direct insight into the decision- making process. Courts normally do not inquire whether the decisionmaker con- sidered, let alone considered adequately, the likely benefits and costs of a decision. See notes 111-12 supra. In the example in the text, however, the inference of illicit motivation would be supported by evidence that the city conducted only a short and perfunctory study before locating the new park (especially if in the past it had made such decisions only after lengthy and careful inquiry). 132 See, e.g., Ho Ah Kow v. Nunan, 12 F. Cas. 252 (No. 6546) (C.C.D. Cal. 1879) (ordinance requiring prisoners in San Francisco jail to be closely shorn); AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE COMMITTEE, THE STATUS OF SCHOOL DESEGREGATION IN THE SOUTH 1970, 35-37 (testing and tracking); id. at 86-88 (teacher testing); Baker v.

REV. 296 (1970). Assessment of the utility of rules of this sort may thrust the court into unfamiliar substantive areas. But courts are required to make such determinations in other circumstances.

Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424 (1971); Cooper &amp; Sobol, Seniority and Testing under Fair Employment Laws: A General Approach to Objective Criteria of Hiring and Promotion, 82 HARV. L.

In considering the question, "Why did the decision- maker adopt this practice?" the court, however, may properly consider the subquestion, "Why did the decisionmaker adopt this practice at this time?" The sequence of events may thus support the inference that the decisionmaker's objective was to do covertly that which he was forbidden to do overtly.137 The strength of the inference will also be affected by the tenacity of the decision- maker's past commitment to the forbidden rule, the extent to which the innovation marks a departure from traditionally established practices,138 and the existence of other decisions that seem de- signed to serve the same illicit objective.139 b) Direct evidence of motivation.

On occasion, a decisionmaker will concede his actual objectives in a judicial proceeding.140 The utility of direct testimony, however, is seriously limited by the ease with which one can lie successfully about one's motives, by the costs of obtaining the testimony of the members of multimember decisionmaking bodies, and by legal doctrines that immunize legislators and high executive officials from having to account for their decisions.41' Of greater practical utility are statements made by decision- makers in the course of the decisionmaking process-statements of the sort often used in statutory interpretation. Where the decision- maker consists of a single person, such statements may be conclu- sive. But only a few members of a multimember body usually will have stated their objectives. Attribution of the statements of some members of the decisionmaking body to the others cannot properly be justified on a theory of adoption by silence or the fic- tion of delegated authority to speak.142 Nonetheless, often the un- contested avowals of illicit motivation by the sponsors of a measure are in fact typical of the views of many others who vote for the measure. Such statements thus lend some support to an inference of illicit motivation, and have properly been used for this purpose,143 though alone they would not provide a sufficient basis for invalida- tion.144 140oSee, e.g., Palmer v. Thompson, 403 U.S. at 253-54; text supra, at note 15; United States v. Morehouse Parish, Civil No. 14429 (W.D. La. 1969) (abandonment of coeducation designed to prevent white flight); Banks v.

The policies underlying judicial review of motivation, see text supra, at notes 107-16,</page><page sequence="31">95] PALMER V. THOMPSON 125 B. FUTILITY [T]here is an element of futility in a judicial attempt to in- validate a law because of the bad motives of its supporters. If the law is struck down for this reason, rather than because of its facial content or effect, it would presumably be valid as soon as the legislature or other relevant governing board repassed it for different reasons.145 If this means that the mere possibility of reenactment for proper purposes necessarily makes futile the invalidation of an illicitly motivated law, it misses the point of judicial review of motivation, which assumes that the law as such is constitutional and that only the process of its adoption-the decisionmaker's consideration of improper objectives-is constitutionally impermissible.146 Thus, in theory the decisionmaker remains free to readopt a motive-in- validated law at any time-provided that he does so solely for legitimate reasons. Judicial review of motivation is no more "futile" merely because reenactment is possible than appellate review is futile because an appellee may prevail again on remand after a trial court is reversed for giving weight to inadmissible evidence or misapplying the law. The "futility" argument, however, has two other, more substan- tial components. First, if courts engage in review of motivation, decisionmakers may take greater care to conceal their illicit objec- tives.147 The judicial practice will thus be self-defeating: once it is engaged in, decisionmakers will cease providing the data on which it depends. The empirical assumptions underlying this argument are not obviously correct. Determinations of motivation often do not depend on manipulable data such as legislative history.148 More- over, decisionmakers may not take cognizance of the practice of apply with no less force to decisions made by referendum; and opinion sampling and other social science techniques might sometimes establish that the electorate was seeking to promote illicit or suspect objectives. Whether such evidence should be received, and when it should be deemed adequate, present interesting questions for further exploration. 145 403 U.S. at 225. In United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367 (1968), the Court declined to invalidate a law "which could be reenacted in its exact form if the same or another legislator made a 'wiser' speech about it."

The second argument is that a particular decisionmaker whose law is once struck down because it was illicitly motivated will re- adopt the law, retaining his illicit motivation but taking care to conceal it. This has more force,"49 and it poses serious practical problems of formulating prospective relief. Since the law might be readopted for wholly licit reasons, a permanent injunction against its readoption could impose high costs on society without any countervailing justification in the policies supporting review of motivation.'"5 On the other hand, to treat readoption as an en- tirely new matter, ignoring the decisionmaker's past motivation, would be unrealistic and would subvert those policies. In general, the most satisfactory response to this dilemma will be to presume that the decisionmaker continues to entertain the motives that led to the original decision (and to its invalidation). In operational terms, the court should enjoin an administrative deci- sionmaker from making the same decision again unless he comes forward with persuasive evidence that this time it will be made only for legitimate reasons. Sometimes a material change of cir- cumstances,151 or the passage of time accompanied by a change of community attitudes,52" will be persuasive of the decisionmaker's good faith. In other circumstances the decisionmaker may be re- quired to demonstrate that the proposed decision is in fact desirable on the merits and that no practicable alternative is less burdensome to the class at whom the original decision was adversely aimed; and the court might require additionally that the decisionmaker take steps to protect that class.153 If the court invalidates a legisla- 149 If he did not previously take cognizance of, and respond to, the court's practice of reviewing motivation, he is likely to do so now: once burned, twice shy. 150 The imposition of such costs would give some force to the "disutility" argu- ment. See text infra, at note 158. 151 Cf. Note, Developments in the Law-Injunctions, 78 HARV. L. REV. 994, 1081-83 (1965). 152 Cf. McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420 (1961). 153 Suppose, for example, that, upon being required to desegregate, a school dis- trict adopts an ability grouping system; the system has the effect of segregating by race and is invalidated on the ground that segregation was its objective.

THOMPSON 127 tive enactment, it should similarly scrutinize reenactment of the identical or a similar law if it is challenged in a properly maintained action. This degree of judicial intrusion into the decisionmaking process is extraordinary. The decisionmaker's past behavior, however, usually justifies the court's strong suspicion of his motives154 and its concomitant scrutiny of the merits of a new decision and re- quirement of prophylactic measures. In some cases, the likelihood that a decision was readopted for legitimate reasons is so small that no inquiry into its merits is necessary.'55 The evaluation of many other decisions calls for little or no substantive expertise,156 and when expertise is required the court can often gain sufficient infor- mation from documentary evidence and expert testimony.'57 C. DISUTILITY The invalidation of an unconstitutional rule is desirable: as a matter of law the rule is bad. But "it is altogether possible for a law which is the expression of a bad motive to be a good law ..., [to make] a positive contribution to the public good."'15 As an argument against judicial review of motivation, this is misleading: it confuses the court's competence with that of the decisionmaker. It is beyond the court's normal authority to determine whether a law is "good."'-9 This is the central task delegated to the decision- note 132 supra, at 35-37. If the district wishes to readopt the plan-purportedly for educational reasons only-the court should require evidence that the particular plan is educationally sound, and should itself weigh the educational benefits against the probable harm to the black students. If the court approved readoption of the plan, it might properly require that the district employ procedural safeguards against discriminatory abuses of the system. 154 Indeed, the core "futility" argument is itself based on the assumption of the decisionmaker's continuing bad faith. 155 See, e.g., Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U.S. 339 (1960); Grosjean v. American Press Co., 297 U.S. 233 (1936), Bush v. Orleans Parish School Bd., 188 F. Supp. 916 (E.D. La. 1960), aff'd, 365 U.S. 569 (1961); id., 190 F.

But when the decisionmaker has treated an illicit objective as desirable-as a benefit rather than as a cost or a neutral factor- he has not properly evaluated the "goodness" of the decision. The argument for judicial review of motivation is that it is the court's task to assure, to the limited extent of forbidding the decisionmaker to weigh improper objectives, that the decisionmaker himself deter- mines that his decision is good. Suppose, for example, that a school board adopts an ability- grouping system that has the effect of segregating black and white pupils.'60 This system might have been adopted to promote educa- tional achievement, but the court finds that the board's objective was in fact to preserve segregation. Conceding, arguendo, that a child has no constitutional right to be assigned to classes with chil- dren of other races, he does have a right not to be segregated on the basis of race. It is no response that "reasonable men" might adopt the tracking system to serve legitimate objectives. The court is not authorized to make this educational decision. And the au- thorized decisionmaker, the school board, did not make the deci- sion on proper grounds. The board may not even have considered the utility of the scheme as a means of promoting educational achievement; and if the board did, it might not have found enough utility to justify the rule's adoption absent the added, impermis- sible, benefit of segregation. The proper allocation of decision- making competence requires that the board make this decision on proper grounds-or that it not be made at all. D. IMPROPRIETY The argument against judicial review of motivation on the ground of its impropriety has focused largely on inquiries into the motives of legislative bodies and high executive officials.161 By contrast, inquiry into the motivation of administrative officials is deemed permissible.'62 The argument has two components: first, the process of proving legislative motivation requires an undesirable intrusion into the political process; second, inquiry into motivation entails a lack of proper respect for a government's chief policy- making agencies. 160 See note 153 supra. 161 BICKEL, note 2 supra, at 208-21; Note, note 75 supra, at 1091-1101. 162 Ibid.</page><page sequence="35">95] PALMER V. THOMPSON 129 The first point assumes that the inquiry into legislative motiva- tion requires the "cross-examination of each individual legis- lator": 1&amp;3 It is simply unthinkable that members of legislative majorities should from time to time be subject to cross-examination in various courts over the country regarding their states of mind when they voted. That is ... [not] representative govern- ment .... [L]egislatures whose members were subject to call for testimony in this fashion would be hard put to it to find the time to legislate. This argument is persuasive that legislators should not be subject to subpoena to explain their reasons for voting for a measure.16e To the extent that proof of illicit motivation depends on such testi- mony, the case must fail. But proof of illicit motivation need not depend on such testimony.e65 The second point involves "considerations of regard for 'the station,' so strong when the Court reviews the work of the legisla- ture."166 "[A] finding of impure motive sufficient to void an act of a legislature impugns the essential integrity of a coordinate branch of government."167 This argument has some force. To declare a law unconstitu- tional on its merits is to hold that the decisionmaker made an error. But a finding of illicit motivation often is tantamount to an accusa- tion that the decisionmaker violated his constitutional oath of office.6"" Especially where the decisionmaker claims to have pur- 163 BICKEL, note 2 supra, at 215. 164 See also note 141 supra. 165 See text supra, at notes 126-39. I have seen no cases inquiring into legislative motivation in which a legislator was called to testify in the judicial proceeding. 166 BICKEL, note 2 supra, at 214. 167 Note, note 75 supra, at 1093. The Note suggests that the argument applies, though less strongly, to state legislatures, "which, unlike Congress, are not co-equal with the federal judiciary." Id. at 1093-94 n.101. The Note further argues against inquiry into legislative motivation on the ground that it "involves a court in the give-and-take of politics and may compel the court to pass judgment on the legiti- macy of political pressures and the responses to them." Id. at 1093-94. As an argu- ment against subpoenaing legislators to account for their votes, this has merit. But if the argument suggests that illicit objectives are immunized because they are re- sponsive to "political pressures," it is fundamentally at odds with the principle that constitutional interests cannot be subverted because of opposition to them. See, e.g., Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U.S. 294, 300 (1955). 168 U.S. Const, Art. VI, ?3. This should not be confused with the accusation of bribery or corruption involved in Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87 (1819), see text</page><page sequence="36">130 THE SUPREME COURT REVIEW [1971 sued only legitimate objectives, a judicial determination of illicit motivation carries an element of insult; it is an attack on the deci- sionmaker's honesty. These concerns apply to lower-echelon offi- cials as well as to legislators and high executive officials. Our con- stitutional traditions, however, accord greater respect to the in- tegrity of the higher agencies. Nevertheless, legislators sometimes do act out of illicit motiva- tions. And against the argument for nonintervention one must set the interests favoring judicial invalidation of an illicitly motivated legislative act-the injury and insult felt by those at whom it is aimed; the harm to the integrity of a system of government that pretends officially not to know what everyone knows is true. The critical commentators themselves have conceded the propriety of invalidation when the case is clear,'69 and the courts have so acted."17 Herein lies the proper reconciliation of these competing interests: the courts should not refuse to inquire into the motiva- tion of any governmental body, but they should not invalidate a decision on the ground that it was designed to serve illicit objec- tives unless that fact has been established by clear and convincing evidence.'71 VII. SUMMARY OF AN APPROACH TO UNCONSTITUTIONAL MOTIVATION I have arrived at the following position: A court should entertain an action challenging an otherwise constitutional deci- sion-whether made by a legislature or an executive or administra- tive official-on the ground that it was designed in part to serve an illicit or suspect objective. The complainant must establish by clear and convincing evidence that such an objective played an affirmative role in the decisionmaking process. He need not, how- supra, at notes 37-38, which, though not of constitutional magnitude, is probably regarded as considerably more damning. 169 See BICKEL, note 2 supra, at 210-11. 170 See, e.g., cases cited in note 125 supra. 171 Concededly the choice of this particular standard is arbitrary, but the "clear and convincing" standard seems properly to accommodate the competing interests involved. It would exceed the precision of the process to apply different standards to judicial review of administrative and legislative decisions unless one required proof beyond a reasonable doubt as to the latter. This seems too onerous a burden to place upon the complainant.</page><page sequence="37">95] PALMER V. THOMPSON 131 ever, establish that consideration of the objective was the sole, or dominant, or a "but-for" cause of the decision-only that its consideration may have affected the outcome of the process. If the objective is illicit, the decision should simply be invalidated. If the objective is suspect, the court should treat it essentially as it treats a suspect operative rule, and invalidate the decision unless the defendant comes forward with an extraordinary justifi- cation. The court should permit the decisionmaker to readopt the same decision only upon a showing that its readoption is designed to serve entirely legitimate objectives. VIII. PALMER V. THOMPSON REVISITED On the record in Palmer v. Thompson, the Court could have concluded that respondents closed Jackson's municipal swim- ming pools either (1) simply to avoid integration, or (2) to avert interracial violence and the loss of revenues that might result if the pools were operated on an integrated basis. The evidence heretofore outlined-the city's relentless opposi- tion to desegregation, contemporary public statements by the may- or of Jackson, and respondents' failure to provide any factual basis for their predictions of violence and economic loss-supports the inference that the first objective played a significant role in the decision to close the pools. A finding to this effect should have invalidated the decision without further inquiry: the avoidance of integration is a suspect objective, requiring an extraordinary justi- fication, and opposition to desegregation is no justification at all.172 If the Court was hesitant to find that respondents closed the Jack- son pools simply out of opposition to integration, there could be no doubt that the pools were closed for the second reason: re- spondents conceded this.'73 A court normally would not seriously consider a constitutional challenge to the abandonment of a mu- nicipal activity,'74 and if the court did require a rational justifica- tion, the demand would be satisfied by the possibility, however small, that continuation of the activity would encourage violence or deplete the municipal fisc. In Palmer, however, respondents' 172 See text supra, at note 33. 173 See text supra, at note 15. 174 Cf. Ely, at 1295-96. Ely would treat this as a "discretionary choice." See text infra, at notes 184-204.</page><page sequence="38">132 THE SUPREME COURT REVIEW [1971 only basis for this prediction was the imminent integration of the pools: however "neutral" respondents' ultimate objective, it was the prospect of integration that triggered the closing of the pools. Mr. Justice White noted this in his dissent.175 He found Palmer to be controlled by a series of cases holding that official specula- tions about violence cannot justify the continued maintenance of state-sponsored segregation."76 These decisions certainly are rele- vant to Palmer, and in one important respect they are directly in point: by whatever means racial integration is avoided, and what- ever reasons are proffered for avoiding it, there is a substantial likelihood that official racial prejudice played a determinative role."'77 Nonetheless, these cases arguably differ from Palmer in several respects: 1. The maintenance of segregated facilities is a continuous, open insult to the minority race, with concomitant anti-educative effects for the entire society. The closing of a facility to blacks and whites alike, when triggered by the prospect of integration, is also insulting and anti-educative, but it may be perceived as less notorious and continuous. 2. To allow the prospect of interracial violence as a defense for segregation encourages some white citizens to engage in violence and encourages sympathetic officials to promote or permit it: the segregationist has everything to gain and nothing to lose. Allowing the same defense for terminating the activity entirely may also have these effects, but the white community does have something to lose. (On the other hand, a policy of abandonment in response to integration may interpose "a major deterrent to seeking judicial or executive help in eliminating racial restrictions on the use of public facilities."'78 As Judge Wisdom stated in his dissent in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, "[T]he price of protest is high. Negroes ... now know that they risk losing even segregated pub- lic facilities if they dare to protest."'79) 3. Since separate facilities are rarely equal in fact, the exclusion 175 403 U.S. at 254. 176 See, e.g., Watson v. City of Memphis, 373 U.S. 526 (1963) (parks); Buchanan v.

Aaron, 358 U.S. 1 (1958) (schools). 177 See text supra, at notes 77-84. 178 403 U.S. at 269. 179 419 F.2d at 1236.</page><page sequence="39">95] PALMER V. THOMPSON 133 of Negroes from a white facility deprives them of benefits ac- corded whites. When the state abandons the facilities entirely, however, it provides no facilities to either race, and hence equal facilities to both. These comparisons may imply that the aggregate harm caused by maintaining segregation to avoid violence and loss of revenues is greater than the harm caused by closing a facility to avoid desegregation for the same reasons. But there is substantial harm in the latter case as well-enough to treat the closing of the pools as "suspect" and to demand more than a rational justification for the decision. In Palmer, this should have been conclusive. Whatever sensitive balancing of interests might have been required had re- spondents demonstrated a serious likelihood of violence and eco- nomic loss, they provided the Court with nothing but conclu- sory assertions. Had the Court reversed the judgment in Palmer, it would have been appropriate to order the city of Jackson to reopen at least the three pools it retained.1s? Of coure, the city might subsequently petition the court to allow it to close the pools again, either be- cause the predicted adverse consequences do materialize or because of some other salient change of circumstances. One cannot easily generalize about the proof that the court should require under all possible future conditions. If respondents claim, however, that operation of the pools has resulted in interracial violence, the court should modify the decree only if the conflicts are serious and cannot be handled adequately by respondents' good-faith efforts.181 If the claim is based on economic loss, the deficit should be substantial-as compared, for example, to that incurred before the pools were ordered desegregated. IX. CONCLUSION Judicial review of motivation is a troublesome enterprise. It poses difficulties concerning proof, appropriate relief, and re- 180 If necessary, the Court could properly have ordered respondents and others "to exercise the power that is theirs to levy taxes to raise funds adequate to reopen, operate and maintain [the facility] without racial discrimination."

Where a court can support a judgment invalidating a decision on grounds other than unconstitutional motivation, it usually should do so.182 The main burden of my thesis is simply that a blanket refusal to inquire into legislative and administrative motivation is not justified. There will remain cases in which nonmotivational grounds for decision are not available, in which unconstitutional motivation can be established with ade- quate certainty, and in which, therefore, the courts should be will- ing to invalidate a decision because the decisionmaker sought there- by to promote constitutionally impermissible objectives. X. THE ELY THEORY: A CRITICAL POSTSCRIPT The fact that an operative rule or criterion works to some- one's disadvantage is often sufficient to trigger the demand for a rational or an extraordinary justification.s83 The central thesis of Professor John Ely's article, "Legislative and Administrative Mo- tivation in Constitutional Law," is that this nonmotivational "dis- advantageous distinction" model, with its automatic demand for a "legitimate defense,"'84 does not apply where the decisionmaker has made either a "random" or a "discretionary" choice. He argues that judicial inquiry into motivation is appropriate only in those two situations.'s5 Proof of illicit motivation serves merely to trigger the demand for a legitimate defense that would not otherwise be required because the disadvantageous distinction model is inappli- cable. s86 182 See, e.g., notes 46 and 84 supra. The Court's desire to avoid explicit determina- tions of improper motivation has influenced the development of doctrine in a num- ber of other areas. See, e.g., N.A.A.C.P. v. Alabama, 377 U.S. 288 (1964) (inadequate state ground); Williams v. Georgia, 349 U.S. 375, 399 (1955) (Clark, J., dissenting) (same); Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U.S. 479 (1960) (freedom of association); Dean Milk Co. v. City of Madison, 340 U.S. 349 (1951) (interstate commerce). 183 See text supra, at notes 62-79. 184 Ely uses the phrase "legitimate defense" or "legitimately defensible difference" to refer to both a rational and an extraordinary justification. E.g., Ely, at 1223-24. But cf. text infra, at notes 191-96, 205. 185 Ely, at 1261-75, 1281-84. 186 Ibid.</page><page sequence="41">95] PALMER V. THOMPSON 135 A. THE TWO MOTIVATIONAL MODELS 1. Random choice. Governments sometimes choose persons at random for the imposition of burdens or conferring of benefits. The selection of jurors and of draftees under the national lottery are familiar examples. Nonrandom selection is made: jurors and recruits must meet certain physical and mental requirements perti- nent to their duties.'87 But choices from this pool are random. The commissioner happened to select Jones's but not Smith's name from the jury wheel; and to demand a rational distinction between Smith and Jones is to deny that the government may select jurors randomly. Ely argues that if, under the guise of making a random choice, a decisionmaker employs a nonrandom operative criterion, the cri- terion must meet the demand for a legitimate defense.'88 Certainly this is correct. Whether the court is asked to determine that the decisionmaker is systematically employing an illicit operative cri- terion (systematically excluding Negroes from the venire) or is asked to determine that he based a particular decision on an illicit criterion (excluding Smith because he is black),"89 judicial review is appropriate.'90 When Ely comes to the nature of the legitimate defense re- quired, however, he imposes an unjustified restriction on review under the "random choice" model.'l" Ely would hold that even when the covertly employed nonrandom criterion is illicit or sus- pect, it triggers only the demand for a rational justification.'92 As he explains elsewhere, "the concept of suspect classification should be reserved . . . for laws which on their face distinguish in terms of the 'suspect' characteristic."'93 Given the extreme leniency of the traditional equal protection standard, which tolerates a substantial 187 See Carter v. Jury Commission, 396 U.S. 320, 332-35 (1970); Ely, at 1232. 188 Ely, at 1261, 1269-79. 189 Ely does not distinguish between these two inquiries and subsumes both under the random choice model. 190 See text supra, at notes 89-99. 191 The same restriction is imposed on review under the "discretionary choice" model. See text infra, at note 205. 192 Ely, at 1269-71. An extraordinary justification would be required only if a "fundamental interest" were affected. See id. at 1269. 193 Id. at 1277 n.208. (Emphasis added.)</page><page sequence="42">136 THE SUPREME COURT REVIEW [1971 lack of congruence between the classifying trait and its objec- tive,194 this position has startling and undesirable consequences. It would not be "irrational," for example, for a government employer who otherwise chooses at random among a surplus of qualified job applicants to prefer white applicants if, say, in his experience blacks as a class have a higher absentee rate than whites.195 If this prefer- ence were promulgated as a regulation, it would be suspect; it would demand, and not receive an extraordinary justification.196 I can see no reason why the decisionmaker's covert use of the same criterion should be treated any differently. 2. Discretionary choice. Ely argues that some official decisions are not random, yet cannot meaningfully be subjected to review under the disadvantageous distinction model. These cases appear to fall into two general categories, having in common the absence of judicially manageable standards of review."97 First,198 an official may have authority to make nonrational choices concerning aesthetics, taste, or propriety. A court cannot determine whether a school board's prohibition of shorts but not blue jeans, or sneakers but not loafers, is "rationally related" to the promotion of taste or a "proper" school environment. Similarly, the aesthetic desirability of a particular site for a public park is not rationally assessable. At best, the court could substitute its own value preferences for those of the school board or park commis- sioner-something it is not ordinarily authorized to do.'99 Second,200 the decision may belong to a class of cases in which 194 See text supra, at notes 64-68; Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471 (1970); McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420 (1961); Tussman &amp; tenBroek, note 64 supra. at 368-72. 195 Cf. Fiss, A Theory of Fair Employment Laws, 38 U. CHI. L. REV. 235, 239, 257 (1971); cf. also Note, note 91 supra, at 1172-76 (treatment of statistically based sex discrimination under Title VII). 196 See text supra, at notes 78-79. The Equal Protection Clause protects against ethnic stereotypes even when they have some statistical validity. Cf. Fiss, note 195 supra, at 260-61. 197 1 do not think that Ely would reject a third category, encompassing cases where the decisionmaker is permitted to draw a quantitative line, the precise loca- tion of which is inevitably arbitrary-for example, a decision setting the time within which an appeal must be filed after judgment, or the minimum age for obtaining a driver's permit. Cf. Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U.S. 112, 294-95 (1970) (Stewart, J.). 198 See Ely, at 1239-43. 199 But cf. text infra, at note 219, and notes 219-20. 200 See Ely, at 1246-49.</page><page sequence="43">95] PALMER V. THOMPSON 137 "each choice will import its own goal, each goal will count as acceptable, and the requirement of a 'rational' choice-goal relation will be satisfied by the very making of the choice."201 Decisions allocating costs and benefits-for example, determining the inci- dence of subsidies and tax burdens-are paradigm examples:202 A subsidy usually can be related to the objective of promoting what- ever activity is subsidized-farming, music, golfing, or aircraft con- struction. "To purport to require of all [such] choices a rational relation to some acceptable goal," Ely argues, would be a "cha- rade": every politically imaginable decision relates to some plau- sible (sub)goal, and every choice "would duly be upheld on the ground that the government had carried its burden of rationally relating the choice to an acceptable goal."203 Such "[a]n infinitely expandable 'set' of subgoals, one to fit every choice the political branches will make, is more realistically and economically viewed as one umbrella goal, the promotion of the general welfare."204 Under Ely's theory, proof that a discretionary choice (for exam- ple, an aesthetic regulation or a subsidy) was illicitly motivated neither automatically invalidates the choice nor triggers the demand for an extraordinary justification. As in the random choice case, its only effect "is to trigger the demand for a legitimate defense in situations where it would not otherwise attach."205 Occasionally, an aesthetic rule (for example, a rule requiring students to wear shoes in school) can be related rationally to a legitimate objective (the promotion of health and safety), and thus survive this review; but otherwise an aesthetic choice is not rationally justifiable, and must fall. Usually, in an "umbrella" goal case (the subsidy), the only available "defense" is that the decision is related rationally to a discretionary "subgoal" (the promotion of the activity sub- sidized).206 "[T]he very reason the disadvantageous distinction 201 Id. at 1247. 202 Other such "discretionary choices" include decisions determining school cur- ricular offerings and what conduct to punish criminally. Id. at 1243-45. 203 Id. at 1247. 204 Id. at 1248. A decision in this area is essentially a value preference for one subgoal at the expense of others. Id. at 1240 n.110. 205 Id. at 1269. See id. at 1208, 1252-54, 1281-82, 1300 n.282. 206 Occasionally, Ely suggests, a legitimate defense is available. For example, al- though curriculum decisions usually can be related only to a "subgoal" such as "the development of the well-educated citizen," "the decision to exclude a certain</page><page sequence="44">138 THE SUPREME COURT REVIEW [1971 model is suspended ... -the fact that explanations of the subgoal level ... must be treated as nonrational in light of the amorphous nature of the ultimate acceptable goal-suggests with identical force that such explanations cannot be regarded as 'rational' for purposes of alternative justification either."207 Such decisions must therefore be invalidated. The following examples illustrate the operational consequences of Ely's thesis. If a complainant proves that a school district has prohibited the wearing of dashikis in order to disadvantage blacks, or that it has ceased sponsoring school social events in order to minimize contact between black and white pupils, those decisions must fall. These are discretionary choice cases. Proof of improper motivation triggers the demand for a legitimate defense. But deci- sions respecting taste and appropriate school activities are not "ra- tionally" defensible;208 so a legitimate defense cannot be forth- coming. On the other hand, it would be fruitless to prove that a recently desegregated Mississippi school district, located in an area where most whites but few Negroes can afford overcoats, has adopted a regulation requiring all students to wear overcoats in the winter in order to decimate the black school population;209 or to prove that a school district fired a teacher because of his race or political activities or associations; or to prove that the district has abandoned coeducation in order to reduce social contact between black boys and white girls. The first two decisions come within the disad- vantageous distinction model: they demand, and would receive, a rational justification quite apart from proof of illicit motivation.210 subject from the curriculum ... could rationally be justified on the ground that no teacher qualified to present it could be found." Id. at 1273. 207 Ibid. Ely characterizes these explanations as mere "subgoal rationalizations." Id. at 1272. 208 Id. at 1239-41, 1279, 1295-96. 209 This is Ely's example, id. at 1279, except that I have placed it in the one state that has no compulsory attendance laws. 210 The overcoat requirement "is legitimately defensible in terms of physical health." Id. at 1279. "Decisions to fire teachers . . . should be treated under the disadvantageous distinction model; a legitimate defense should be demanded simply because a choice has been made, and without a requirement of illicit motivation." Id. at 1294-95 n.268. The practical implications of the latter position are disastrous, especially, though not exclusively, in those southern states in which teachers do not have tenure and serve under one-year contracts. See, e.g., AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE</page><page sequence="45">95] PALMER V. THOMPSON 139 Since the only function of such proof would be to trigger that same demand, it is simply irrelevant. If the abandonment of coedu- cation is a discretionary choice,211 the district will nonetheless be able to justify the decision in terms of a "real" legitimate objec- tive.212 The basis for the different treatment of disadvantageous dis- tinction cases and discretionary choice cases is not self-evident. To understand how Ely arrives at it, one must first consider his basic argument for judicial review of motivation. B. THE NEED FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW OF MOTIVATION IN DISCRETIONARY CHOICE CASES Judicial review of motivation in discretionary choice cases "de- rives from the obvious need for some sort of review and the un- acceptability of the alternatives-a disproportionate impact model and the ordinary disadvantageous distinction model."213 Ely does not dwell at length on this need, but he develops the case for judicial review through the following example and argument: Suppose a legislature enacts a tax exemption for children, limited to the chil- dren of Caucasians. This must surely be unconstitutional,214 Ely claims, but only judicial review of motivation can explain why: A distinction which disadvantages some persons relative to others has obviously been drawn, and no legitimate defense of the distinction can be postulated, for the only goals to which it can be rationally related are constitutionally impermissible. COMMITTEE, note 132 supra, at 74-95. Ely's position does not represent the law in the courts. See, e.g., Johnson v. Branch, 364 F.2d 177 (4th Cir. 1966); Chambers v. Hendersonville Board of Education, 364 F.2d 189 (4th Cir. 1966). Given the vast number of subjective criteria by which teachers are evaluated, a school district will almost always be able to manufacture some plausible legitimate basis for not renew- ing a particular teacher's contract. (This makes me doubt whether, under Ely's own criteria, he has properly placed the decision under the disadvantageous distinction model. Cf. Ely, at 1244 n.124. See generally note 217 infra.) 211 Cf. Ely, at 1245, 1273-74. But cf. Kirstein v. University of Virginia, 309 F. Supp. 184 (E.D. Va. 1970). See generally note 217 infra. 212 For example, there is some evidence that "[i]n separate education fewer discipline problems ... arise because the tendency of boys to 'show-off' for girls does not exist." Comment, note 132 supra, at 325. Cf. Ely, at 1336-38 (implying that the maintenance of discipline or order is a legitimate objective). 213 Ely, at 1274. 214 Encouraging only Caucasians to propagate is suspect, and the state could produce no compelling interests sufficient to justify the classification.</page><page sequence="46">140 THE SUPREME COURT REVIEW [1971 But courts have recognized that it is senseless to hold decisions to encourage or discourage various sorts of activity by taxing or spending distinctions up to a requirement of rational con- nection with an acceptable goal and that, therefore, the dis- advantageous distinction model as a whole is useless in such contexts. The offensiveness of the classification must there- fore be taken account of by some mode of review other than an ab initio demand for a legitimate defense. By hypothesis the law on its face distinguishes in terms of race, and that undoubtedly would be all the Court would point to. But explicit racial terminology cannot be the sine qua non of unconstitutionality; a law granting the exemp- tion to "the children of ... [listing the names of all Caucasians and no one else]" would be just as obviously unconstitu- tional. Nor would the infirmity be cured by sprinkling into such a list the names of a few non-Caucasians. The law's susceptibil- ity to judicial review must therefore rest on either the fact that its impact is to treat white persons better than others, or the fact that it was enacted with the motivation of distinguish- ing on the basis of race. . The argument is, in brief, that measures like a tax exemption for only Caucasian children must be unconstitu- tional; disadvantageous distinction cannot sensibly trigger re- view in such situations; and a test conditioning judicial review upon impact per se would be inconsistent with the Court's resolution not to compel those designing tax codes, or draw- ing up dress codes or deciding whom to prosecute, to take into account and attempt to "balance" the races of the likely gainers and losers. I make no apology for the form of this argument. Starting from a clearly unconstitutional course of action-and I have trouble seeing the unconstitutionality of a tax exemption for only Caucasian children as a controversial assumption-and at- tempting to explain why it is unconstitutional in terms of a theory capable of acceptable and consistent application to other areas, is a perfectly sensible way of developing consti- tutional doctrine. But the victory of the motivational model in areas of discretionary choice, it must be said, is by default, in the sense that nothing said so far supports it except the unacceptability of the alternatives.215 215 Ely, at 1249-50, 1262. This is not a complete legal argument of the usual sort. Ely points out a potential dislocation in the law (the unacceptability of holding the "Caucasians only" rule constitutionally valid) and supports judicial review of moti- vation only because it removes the dislocation by producing the "needed" result (i.e., invalidation). But he concededly provides no intrinsic justification for the</page><page sequence="47">95] PALMER V. THOMPSON 141 As I read this argument, it does not merely reiterate the asser- tion-made with respect to the random choice model-that the courts should be willing to determine whether a decisionmaker is employing a covert operative criterion ("Caucasians only") and should subject the criterion, once it is found, to the demand for a legitimate defense. This is certainly correct, but it is trivial. Ely seems to be making the far more significant statement that the nonmotivational models of review cannot properly invalidate even an overt statutory enactment of the "Caucasians only" law: Since subsidies are in the class of "discretionary choices," the argument goes, the disadvantageous distinction cannot itself trigger review (and a racially disproportionate impact does not suffice to in- validate). This argument is incorrect for two independent reasons. Recall, first, Ely's basis for concluding that the disadvantageous distinction model is inapplicable to subsidies: every choice would be upheld as relating to some legitimate goal, so that review would be a meaningless gesture.216 But Ely's "Caucasians only" case is a coun- ter-example which demonstrates that it is not always futile-not inevitably a "charade"-to require that "discretionary choices" be rationally justified: every once in a while one will come across a discretionary choice that cannot be related rationally to any legiti- mate goal (or subgoal).217 review of motivation. Cf. text supra, at notes 107-14; WASSERSTROM, THE JUDICIAL DECISION 25-29 (1961), which contrasts the process by which a court intuitively arrives at its result in a case (essentially what Ely has provided in the quoted ex- cerpt) with the process of justifying the result. The form of Ely's case for judicial review of motivation best explains the restric- tions he places on the scope of such review. Ely, at 1269, 1274. Ely has created re- view of motivation to fill a particular need-the need for some review where effect does not invalidate and the disadvantageous distinction model is inapplicable. See Ely, at 1241, 1245, 1249. He therefore has limited review to the scope necessary to satisfy that need. But legal doctrines have a Frankensteinian aspect: they take on an existence of their own which is determined, not by the dislocation that engendered their creation, but by the intrinsic policies justifying their existence. Cf. BICKEL, note 2 supra, at 49-50 (discussing Professor Wechsler's "neutral principles"). Limit- ing the application of a legal doctrine to the need that engendered it is like limiting the use of a drug to the disease for whose cure it was discovered, when it cures other diseases as well; or-to use a more familiar analogy-like limiting a case "to its facts." 216 See text supra, at notes 200-04. 217 This calls into question the viability of the distinction between the disadvan- tageous distinction and discretionary choice models, at least where the challenged decision purports to serve a social or economic policy (as distinguished from an</page><page sequence="48">142 THE SUPREME COURT REVIEW [1971 Second, even if discretionary choices could never be evaluated by a "rationality" standard, this does not entail that they cannot meaningfully be subjected to the demand for an extraordinary justification, triggered by use of a suspect criterion, such as "Cau- casians only." A court presented with a suspect operative rule does not stop at, or necessarily even begin with, the determination that the rule is rational. Rather, the court inquires into the substantive merits-into the wisdom-of the decision, to determine whether the objectives served by the rule are so important, and are served so well, given available alternatives, as to outweigh the rule's potential harmful effects.218 This is true even with respect to nonrational, aesthetic choices. aesthetic end). Cf. also Ely, at 1309-10 and n.313. Because this distinction is not germane to the analysis of motivation developed in this article, I shall not take it up at any length. But it raises interesting and complex problems with implications be- yond the issue of motivation. Almost every politically conceivable decision would be upheld if it were reviewed under the rationality standard. But how do we know whether a decision would be upheld (a) because it is in fact rationally related to a legitimate purpose or (b) because it is a decision of the sort which inevitably will be upheld because it "import[s] its own acceptable goal," and which, therefore, should be placed in the category of "discretionary choices"? Id. at 1247. How in other words, can we tell whether the decisionmaker's proffered objective is a "real" objective, or merely a "subgoal rationalization"? See id. at 1272. Why, for example, are the promotion of safety, see Railway Express Agency v. New York, 336 U.S. 106 (1949), the protection of morals, see Goesaert v. Cleary, 335 U.S. 464 (1948), and the prevention of "commercialization" of a profession, see Williamson v. Lee Opti- cal Co., 348 U.S. 483 (1955), real objectives rather than mere subgoal rationalizations that are better viewed "as one umbrella goal, the promotion of the general welfare"? Ely, at 1248. Ely has done an important service in pointing out that some sort of a distinction exists. But, perhaps because he has defined his models ostensively and operationally rather than connotatively, and possibly because that is the only way they can be defined, further analysis is needed. 218 Almost immediately following the "Caucasians only" argument, Ely seems to make the same point that I have made in the text: "[A]n inability to evaluate the rationality of a criterion of choice imports no paralysis with regard to the Consti- tution's other limitations. If, therefore, the principle of selection employed by the decisionmakers can be identified, there is no reason why judges should refrain from measuring that principle, not in terms of rationality, but rather against the other commands of the Constitution. Political judgments concerning the promotion of the general welfare may not be amenable to rational evaluation by courts, but some such judgments-that the general welfare would be served by the separation of the races or by the conversion of everyone to Christianity-constitute constitutionally imper- missible criteria of choice." Ely, at 1262-63. But see id. at 1236-37, 1252-54, 1281-82, 1300 n.282. Why then is an inquiry into motivation necessary to invalidate a statute providing a tax exemption for Caucasian children? Surely, the Equal Protection Clause renders "the propagation of the white race" as impermissible an objective as the First Amendment renders "the conversion of everyone to Christianity."</page><page sequence="49">95] PALMER V. THOMPSON 143 For example, if a high school principal seats black and white pupils on different sides of the graduation stage, for purely visual aesthetic reasons, the court is not put to the choice of determining the "ra- tionality" of the decision or disputing his good intentions or ab- staining. Rather, the court would, most probably, hold that what- ever the aesthetic benefits gained, they cannot overcome the potential harm from purposive separation by race.219 Similarly, perhaps a fortiori, a court would properly subject Ely's suspect "Caucasians only" tax exemption to the demand for extraordinary justification, which it could not meet.220 C. THE LIMITED SCOPE OF REVIEW If the "Caucasians only" case is handled adequately by non- motivational modes of review, there nonetheless remain a variety of official decisions which should be and can only be invalidated by recourse to motivation. These include rationally justifiable deci- sions subject to the disadvantageous distinction model, as well as "discretionary choices."221 Under Ely's doctrine, however, review of motivation is only appropriate in the latter cases; and a rational justification will protect an illicitly motivated decision from invalidation. Why, however, should the Constitution be more solicitous of decisions that are subject to the disadvantageous distinction model and that meet the rationality requirement than of discretionary choices that are nonrational or are relatable only to an "umbrella" goal? Ely does not suggest that the harm to the complainant is any greater in one class of cases than the other. And if there is a noncircular answer,222 it lies in differences with respect to ascer- tainability, futility, and disutility-matters to which Ely devotes some consideration. 1. Ascertainability. The fact that a rule is rationally related to a 219 This is not to say that the court would necessarily strike down every racial classification based on an aesthetic judgment. Probably the court would permit the assignment of roles by race in a school play in which the race of particular char- acters was significant. Cf. Civil Rights Act of 1964, ? 703 (e). 220 The point made in the text is not limited to race cases. For example, although matters of municipal economy and convenience may be beyond judicial evaluation under a "rationality" standard, a court would properly weigh these factors in re- viewing a municipality's decision regulating the time, place, or duration of a large public assembly. See Blasi, note 181 supra, at 1489-92. 221 See text supra, at notes 206-10. 222 Cf. Ely, at 1274.</page><page sequence="50">144 THE SUPREME COURT REVIEW [1971 legitimate objective, Ely asserts, makes it virtually impossible to infer that it was designed to serve an illicit objective. By contrast, the inference of unconstitutional motivation "can sometimes be quite responsibly drawn" where the only available "justification" for the decision is in terms of a discretionary subgoal or an aesthetic preference.223 By way of illustration, Ely provides two examples of disadvantageous distinction cases-a school district's adoption of the "overcoat" rule, and a state's adoption of a voting literacy test. "It would in all likelihood be impossible responsibly to con- clude that a school principal's requirement of coats in winter was racially motivated," because the regulation is rationally re- lated to the promotion of health.224 Similarly, the literacy test could be invalidated only "on a record of a sort which will never exist or [by] a judge hell-bent on invalidation."225 These assertions do not seem obviously correct. Where the school district has not previously had health regulations of this sort, where the district has strenuously resisted desegregation and adopts the overcoat regulation soon after it is ordered to desegre- gate, and where the impact of the regulation is to exclude many black but few white children from the school system, it would seem quite responsible to conclude that the regulation was designed to have that impact. If it can be shown that the health benefits are marginal, the inference is, pro tanto, stronger.26 And where a state has long tolerated the registration of white illiterates, and adopts a literacy test only after a court orders it to cease discrimi- nating against black applicants, the inference of a racially dis- criminatory motivation seems equally proper.227 Of course, illicit motivation may often be difficult to prove with adequate certainty, and it may even be true (though it is not self-evident) that illicit motivation is more difficult to establish where a true rational justification is available than in other cases. But these are not reasons for refusing to act on a finding of im- proper motivation in those, albeit few, cases where it is adequately established.228 223 Id. at 1278-79. 224 Id. at 1279. 225 Id. at 1278. 226 See note 132 supra. 227 See cases cited note 133 supra. 228 "Of course, courts should 'eschew guesswork' in constitutional adjudication, as elsewhere.

If a rationally defensible law is invalidated on the ground that it was illicitly motivated, the decisionmaker can fabri- cate a legislative history for reenactment, purporting to demonstrate that this time he considered only legitimate objectives. "When, however, the only articulable alternative explanation for an un- constitutionally motivated choice is . . . a judgment of taste, the likelihood of a futile judicial order, though it cannot be discounted, is substantially lessened."229 Reenactment of a law previously voided because of the deci- sionmaker's motivation does pose the problem to which Ely al- ludes. But it is not apparent that it poses a greater problem for one class of cases than the other. Readoption of a once-invalidated (discretionary choice) decision terminating school-sponsored so- cial events, for example, is not inherently more, or less, suspicious than readoption of a once-voided (disadvantageous distinction) overcoat regulation. 3. Disutility Should proof of unconstitutional motivation be held either automatically to invalidate the choices it has produced, or to place on the state some burden of justification over and above the ordinary demand for a legitimately defensible difference, ... [the Court's] fear of the invalidation of laws which mea- sure up to the Constitution's usual test of legitimacy would be fulfilled. If, however, motivation is limited to the burden- triggering role implied by the considerations which support its cognizability, only those choices which are not supportable in terms of a legitimately defensible difference will fall. Proof of illegitimate motivation will function only to deny the gov- ernment a privilege of non-justification which, owing to the peculiar nature of the area of choice involved, it would other- wise be able to invoke.30o The first point is largely correct. Judicial review of motivation may invalidate a rule that meets all other, nonmotivational, con- stitutional standards of review; that is what it is designed to do. The second point is misleading. Proof of illicit motivation in dis- cretionary choice cases does not merely deny the government "a privilege of nonjustification." It prevents the government from of motivation is less than clear and not necessarily for a total rejection of its rele- vance."

If the quotation implies that discretionary choices are less worthy of judicial respect than decisions subject to the disadvantageous dis- tinction model, it is simply incorrect.231 231 Many allocative decisions, for example, are as vital to the well-being of a society, and affect the behavior of individuals and enterprises as much as regula- tory schemes that are subject to the disadvantageous distinction model. To approve a decision under the rationality standard, on the other hand, is to say nothing about its net utility or desirability. A regulation may impose great burdens on some persons with little benefits to others. But so long as it is positively (however weakly) related to a conceivable legitimate purpose (however trivial), it passes scrutiny.
