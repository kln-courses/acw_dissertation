<plain_text><page sequence="1">Prithwish Neogy On Stephen C. Pepper's "On the uses of symbolism in sculpture and painting" Professor Pepper's essay is primarily concerned with the problem of repre- sentation. Representation is symbolic. The symbol is perhaps a necessary substitute for the unwieldly world or its part, and as such, may be more or less viable in one or another conditioned circumstance. In art, however, representation is but one of the means to a complex of ends (a machine that makes the currently approved type of representation does not end art). Three fundamental questions are raised by Professor Pepper regarding what representation symbolizes: Is it the actual shapes and colors of a physical object out there? Is it a pattern of shapes and colors produced for our perception by the stimulation of an object out there? Is it a concept we have acquired by acculturation and projected upon a source of stimulation out there? If the answer is 'no' to the first and 'yes' to the other two questions, the concept of pure perception and the concept of pure conception may be equally inoperative. On the other hand, the first part of a sentence quoted from Gombrich may be acceptable as complete: "All art originates in the human mind in our reactions to the world rather than in the visible world itself. .. ." Professor Pepper is of the opinion that by means of "natural symbols" (natural to man alone) a true perception of nature may be had; that a realistic painter attempts to render his representation true to nature, corresponding as nearly as possible to a man's correct perception of it. But he goes on to say that cues of natural symbols are so numerous that the painter has to select among them. These limited aspects of perception are further limited by the medium he uses. After much skillful invention the work does not become an illusion of a perception of nature, remaining, as it does, a picture represent- ing nature. Yet the work is convincing for the spectator's perception as being realistic. Professor Pepper does not seem to think that in this case realism is an idea of which the means to achieve and to interpret are contextual. While making use of many modes of representation, and of symbols of various orders, art retains an otherness, a transcending identity. In India, the experience of art is treated in terms quite distinct from those used to explore the structure of symbols. Reality as manifest through in- scrutable maya, the divine art, is already symbolic of the idea in the supreme being. This appears to determine the modality of human understanding. Man, with his characteristic limitations, apprehends reality only as permitted by his perceptions and conceptions, necessarily combined.

With a work of art, the awareness of reality is further mediated and sym- bolized. Sri Sankuka in the ninth century noted that a painted horse is neither real nor false (being an image and a symbol). In practice, abstract concepts are presented in sensuous images. The expression yaddrstam tallikhitam, setting down the merely perceived (an intention, actually unachievable), is derogatory. Rather than likeness, representation is metaphorical and ideated correspondence. An icon may involve a multiple sequence of symbol-structures. The once self-sufficient geometric, zoomorphic, and anthropomorphic images accumulate as attributes and components to later comprehensive polymorphic mega- symbols. Traditionally, life is archetypal and stylized and therefore, in general, similar to the work of art. Live iconolatry is still practiced in India. One unexpected urban survival is the annual Ramalill celebrations on the outskirts of New Delhi, in the course of which it is not unusual to see parents, in devout obeisance to Rama, Sita, and Laksmana, impersonated by their own offspring. This conduct is not conceivable ordinarily. Symbolic connotation rather than signal denotation is the desired value. On the other hand, the icon is manifested or experienced within Cidam- baram, the mind-sky. The use of a work of art is in the metrical reconstitution of the self of the user. As quintessence of experience of a work of art, rasa or flavor is tasted by the competent as ecstasy informed with intellection, which is likened to the tasting of Brahman. While the conceivable referent of a symbol is but another symbol, the inscrutalibity of maya avoids the possibility of an infinite regression. Since mediation is inevitable whether in art or life, all meaning is structurally symbolic. But the painted horse, being neither real nor false, has its own kind of existence. A work of art that is imbued with rasa is to be experienced (tasted), and not merely to be considered as symbolically referential. When that which is necessarily symbolizing is recognized by the sympathetic rasika as art, the experience is inscrutable but altogether real; subjective but con- vincing. The only parallel is the deepest spiritual intimation envisoned in the culture.</page></plain_text>
