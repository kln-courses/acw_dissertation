Recent archaeological discoveries have gone far to prove the essential correctness of the Romans' own traditions concerning their earliest history. The constantly increasing mass of evidence from the early burials and the early monuments of Rome offers a new and valuable means of testing the traditional history represented in the first book of Livy. Evidence from the early burials of the Forum and Esquiline in the main corroborates the traditions of the founding and early development of the city. The burials discovered, however, must represent only a small fraction of the whole number of early tombs, and conclusions based upon their evidence are in certain cases somewhat hypothetical. Conclusions dealing with general racial facts are reasonably sure, but detailed inferences concerning the development of the early city drawn from records so incomplete are dangerously uncertain. The finding of a cemetery of cremation burials of the period following their disappearance from the Forum would throw much light on a number of questions, and the discovery of a burial ground on the Quirinal would perhaps greatly modify our hypotheses concerning the early city. But there is at present no indication that any such discoveries will ever be made, and, though conclusions must be tentative, it is useless to suspend all inferences from evidence which is now at hand in expectation of a record which will probably never be complete. I have therefore attempted to apply what evidence we have to certain problems involved in the earliest history of the city, necessarily omitting any hypotheses about early settlements on the Quirinal, the Caelian, and the Velia. It is perhaps unnecessary to remark that the accuracy of statements concerning individual burials of the Esquiline necropolis is vitiated to sonme extent by the incompleteness and inaccuracy of the records of the excavations. In certain instances I have accepted evidence from Pinza's description of individual burials, in every case omitting those which are clearly incomplete. At the same time I realize the large possibility of error in theories based upon records so inaccurate. Study of the evidence from the cemetery of the Forum is infinitely more satisfying, because of the careful excavations and accurate reports of the finds from the Sepulcretum.

IN the generations since the implicit acceptance of Livy's account of the early history of Rome was first overthrown by Niebuhr's sweeping criticism, an attitude of skep- ticism, more or less extreme, has prevailed among students of Roman history. The large legendary element in the traditions which Livy records as history has been sufficient until recently to discredit the whole of his account of the regal period and the early republic. The traditional account of the early city has been regarded by certain scholars as largely a mass of falsification invented to flatter the vanity of a later age. It has been claimed that the duration of the city's existence was extended by at least two centuries, by means of a series of duplications of later events and by much later interpolation; that the well-organized and flourishing city which tradition pictures as existing in the late sixth century under the Etruscan kings should be dated actually in the fourth century after the Gallic invasion. The first modern scholar to question the credibility of Livy's account was Niebuhr, whose work in the early 19th century marked the beginning of a new era in the study of Roman history. Niebuhr believed the traditional history of early Rome to be com- posed of a mass of legend based on mere oral tradition, with no sound basis in records preserved from early times. Placing no faith in the reliability of the sources, he attempted by his own interpretation to deduce the truth from the legends themselves. This unsound method of criticism, while it was often handled brilliantly by Niebuhr and was adopted to some extent by other scholars, I was superseded later by the more ac- curate work of Mommsen. Mommsen, instead of following Niebuhr's method of trying to divine the truth by interpretation of the legends, undertook a careful critical study of the sources of Roman history, in an attempt to determine which sources are most re- liable, what part of the traditional account is legend, and what part rests on trustworthy 1 The chief successor to Niebuhr's method was Schwegler. The work of Peter and of Ihne also shows strong influence of Niebuhr's views. Duruy follows Nie- buhr and Schwegler in his treatment of the early history.</page><page sequence="6">12 INEZ G. SCOTT documents which survived from an early period. He naturally discarded as pure legend a great part of the material included in Livy's early books, detailed traditions which obviously could have come from no source except stories passed on from generation to generation. Often, however, he saw in the traditional tales the legendary dress of the actual devel- opment of Roman institutions. In the legend of Tatius and Romulus he saw a myth- ical explanation of the development of the double consulship; in the legend of the union with the Sabines a reflection of the actual later conquest of the Sabines, the granting of citizenship to the Sabines, and the subsequent conquest of Italy by a people who com- bined Latin and Sabine stock; in the legend of the coming of Attus Clausus an explan- ation of the admission and assimilation of foreign names. Mommsen accepted the history of the constitutional development largely as it was represented in the Romans' own accounts, working back to the origins from the firm basis of later institutions. But he gave little credence to the traditional account of the circumstances of this development. He accepted, for example, the Servian constitution, but not the historical existence of the king, Servius; the fact of Rome's early attainment of hegemony over Latium, but none of the traditional circumstances attending this rise to power. This method of seeking the underlying fact embodied in the mass of tradition and legend represents Mommsen's atti- tude toward the credibility of early Roman history. Discarding the mass of detail which is clearly mere tradition, he accepted as authoritative such facts as would have been pre- served in official records and early documents. By careful criticism and comparison of available sources, he sought to arrive at the skeleton of fact preserved by the earliest docu- ments and handed down by the earliest annalists. Such sources as the Fasti and other documents, and the accounts of the early annalists, who were undoubtedly careful ob- servers of these official records, he believed to be a reliable basis for the chief facts of his- tory. 2 Though he admitted the presence of interpolations and errors in the Fasti them- selves, he aimed at a restoration of the true record by critical testing and comparison of the various Versions as we have them. While certain of Mommsen's conclusions must fall before the new evidence from actual remains of earliest Rome, evidence which was not available in his day, his method stands as one of sound logic and keen criticism. Since Mommsen's monumental History of Rome, the work of most far-reaching in- fluence is that of the Italian scholar, Ettore Pais, whose criticism of early Roman tradi- tion has been at once more destructive and less sound. Pais not only attacked that part of the early history which clearly rests on mere tradition, but by denying the survival of any records from an early date attempted to overthrow the whole framework of the traditional versions, and to prove that the history of all the regal period and of the first few centuries of the republic was almost entirely falsification. He attributed an equal 'See Hermes, xxi, 1886, 570 fif. 2 Rou'sche FQrschungen, especially the chapter on ((Fabius und Diodor, )) ii, 221 ff.</page><page sequence="7">EARLY ROMAN TRADITIONS 13 untrustworthiness to all the sources, and accused the earlier annalists of the same tend- ency to exaggeration and falsification which was so prevalent among the historical writ- ers of Sulla's time. He ascribed the earliest traditions to inventions from Greek sources, and much even of the later accounts to deliberate inventions of patriots, such as Fabius or Valerius, who wished to glorify their own ancestry. Rejecting the authority of all the sources indiscriminately, Pais followed to some extent the method of Niebuhr, and attempted to work out the truth by interpretation of the traditions themselves. He discarded even the skeleton of fact and chronology furnished by the Fasti and other official records; for he pointed out interpolations and errors in the lists of magistrates, on the strength of which he discredited the authority of the whole record. Since, as he believed, all official documents must have perished at the time of the Gallic invasion, the records purporting to be of the earlier period must have been deliberate falsifications or at any rate restorations from un- trustworthy family memoirs. Livy's own references to divergences among the lists of magistrates I proved conclusively, in Pais' opinion, that the Fasti themselves dated only from a comparatively late period. Even the Annales Maximi, which in any case could have been at first nothing more than a bare list of magistrates, important triumphs, prodigies, and weather reports, were themselves not early. The earliest prodigies recorded were of the third century; the first eclipse of which the Romans knew occurred in the time of En- nius. 2 The appearance of other specific dates for the first time in the third century, the Ludi Saeculares in 249 B. C., 3 the closing of the temple of Janus in 235 (Livy, i, 19, 3), Pais accepted as an indication of the date at which the Annales Maximi began to be kept. He would deny any authority, even to these scant records, on the ground that they must have been destroyed in the burning of the Regia (148 B. C.) and replaced by others, more detailed and expanded by much traditional material ' (cf. Livy, Vi, 1). Pais believed the Annales which later appeared in eighty books (SERV., Aen., i., 373; AUL. GELL., iv, 5) to have had very little connection with the early lists of prodigies and triumphs and weather reports. The burning of the Regia gave an excuse also for the re-inventing of records and laws, as well as lists of magistrates. Since records of all kinds had to be restored from memory and from private memoirs, there was much opportunity to invent records from earlier ages and to fill in the history of the earlier period from legendary material. By a series of duplications of events and names of magistrates, the whole history of Rome from the legendary founding was finally invented, and incorporated into the supposedly official records. Pais pointed out numerous duplications in the Fasti and in the account of events; in every case he discarded the earlier occurrence as a repetition of the later, 1 E. g. Livy, ii, 21. 2 Cf.

SCOFT assuming that it had been interpolated to fill out the records. Such repetitions he dis- covered all through the history of Rome, in the duplication of the story of two Tar- quins, in the repetition of the tradition concerning Curtius, recorded first for Romulus' time, then for 445 B. C., and once again in 362 B. C., in the double records of the building of certain temples, the temple of Saturn in Tarquin's time and again in the 4th century, the temple of Jupiter Stator in Romulus' time and again during the Samnite war. 2 The burning of Satricum with the miraculous preservation of the temple of Mater Matuta, which occurred in 376 B. C. (Livy, vi, 33, 4 f.), was recorded again in 346 B. C. (Livy, vii, 27, 8). The record of the two commercial treaties with Carthage Pais ascribed to a duplication of the later treaty made in the fourth century. Pais' attack on the reliability of all the sources exerted a great influence on subse- quent studies, and his attitude became for a time the prevailing view of early Roman history. A few scholars went even further in destructive criticism. While Pais had dated the codification of the XII Tables in the 5th century of the city, Lambert3 at- tempted to prove that the laws were not codified until more than a century later, when they were finally reduced to the form of the XII Tables, probably by Sextus Aelius in the 2nd century B. C. Lambert's belief was that the laws embodied in the tables were of unequal antiquity, a collection of ancient maxims along with numerous Greek impor- tations borrowed from the laws of Solon and used to fill in lacunae in the Roman code. The laws could not have been codified earlier, he argued, because in some cases 4 they represent customs of later times. Lambert's attack on the XII Tables was answered almost immediately by a number of scholars. 5 Archaism of language was adduced as a proof of the early codification of the laws, and a number of facts were brought forward to prove Lambert's dating unfounded. Such laws as the prohibition of marriage between plebeians and patricians, for instance, would never have been included in a code formulated long after the plebs had won recognition of almost equal rights. It was pointed out further that Sextus Aelius, whom Cicero mentions as a (( vetus interpres, &gt;) himself failed to understand certain words used in the tables, which had become obsolete even in his time. 6 The return to a more conservative view was continued in the next important critical work on Roman History, that of De Sanctis, who, though skeptical as to details, consid- ered such early documents as the Fasti and the books of the pontifices an essentially trust- worthy outline of fact and chronology. While the Annales published on the walls of the 1 VARRO, Ling. Lat., v, 148; Livy, vii, 6, 1-6; cf. PAIS, Storia di Roma, 1, i, 116 ff. 2 DIONYS., vi, 1, 4; Livy, x, 37, 15.

C., De Sanctis believed that there must have existed earlier records kept by the priests themselves, though not exhibited to the public. The eighty books of the Annales, while filled in with details from tradition and legend, must have been based on the old official pontifical records, and in essential facts worthy of credence. Although our versions of the Fasti show some divergence among themselves and some lacunae which were in certain cases filled in by later interpolation, De Sanctis pointed out the arbitrariness of claiming that the lists from the earlier centuries were wholly invented. A few names might have been inserted in the Fasti of earlier years from those of famous families of later times; but there could have been no motive for the interpolation of many names which occur in the Fasti of the 5th century, but which were unknown in the later period. ' While De Sanctis admitted the existence of many errors and of later interpolations of names, including cognomina, which gave rise to discrep- ancies in the different versions of the Fasti, he demonstrated the futility of discarding the valuable evidence furnished by the whole list because of the impossibility of restoring it as a complete record of the chronology of Roman history. He believed that the lists of magistrates must date from the fifth century, and that these and certain other documents must have escaped destruction at the time of the Gallic fire. The influence of Pais' work, however, may sometimes be traced in the methods of criticism which De Sanctis applied to the early legends. He occasionally made his own interpretations regardless of the evidence, and tried to discover the truth by his inferences from the traditions themselves. He treated the tales of the founding of Rome and of the connection with Alba Longa as mere legends patterned upon the Greek myths which attributed the founding of Italian cities to Greek heros. The tradition of an admixture of Sabine stock in the Roman race he explained as due merely to the proximity of Sabine territory and to the consequent similarities between the Sabines and the people of certain parts of the Roman territory. He considered the stories of the two quins a duplication of the same tradition, and their Etruscan origin as an etymological Tarmyth. The history of even the earliest centuries of the Republic, however, De Sanctis believed to be based ultimately on trustworthy records, which furnished a skeleton of fact and chronology and kept the detailed traditional account from wandering too far from the truth. Since the publication of De Sanctis' work, faith in the credibility of the main facts of Roman history has continued to increase. As is true of any tendency of belief that has once begun to gain prevalence, there now arises the new danger of a return to a too unquestioning conservatism. In a few instances modern historians have accepted the traditional account without sufficient effort to apply to it the criteria and the tests which it is now possible to use. A number of Italian scholars have been led by a nationalistic ' This is the opinion also of BELOCH, Rdmische Geschichte, 15 ff.</page><page sequence="10">16 INEZ G. SCOTT attitude toward ancient Rome to accept the traditional history with too little discrimination.' A similar criticism may be applied to the work of certain other writers of Roman his- tory. HEITLAND'S The Roman Republic includes the traditional account of the early period, with certain reservations as to the credibility of the entire story, but with no attempt to separate legend from fact. In the present day, when faith in the reliability of the sources of Roman history is increasing, and recent archaeological discoveries are combining to corroborate the tra- ditional picture of early Rome, it is essential not to be carried too far by the current tendency of criticism, nor to allow conservatism to degenerate into credulity. It becomes even more important, as evidence from archaeology increases, to apply the most careful criticism to the traditions which until recently have been subject to no tests from con- crete evidence. Archaeological discoveries, while they have corroborated much of the traditional picture of early Rome, have also furnished a new basis of fact by which to separate the truth from the mass of legend. It is now becoming more evident that what De Sanctis saw to be a necessary hypoth- esis is true, that Roman records did not all nor even largely perish in the Gallic fire. 2 The buildings where the records were kept are now known to have lasted into later Republican times, and there is no reason for believing that official records, lists of magis- trates, and certain other documents, which were accessible to the early annalists, did not date from an early period. The discrediting of even the early annalists on the ground that they could have had no documentary sources for the centuries before the Gallic in- vasion is now at an end. There is every indication that Fabius, Cato, and Piso, while they included some of the early traditions and detailed legends, depended for their main facts upon official records and documents which had been preserved from early times. From the slighting references to the lack of literary excellence in the writings of the early annalists we may judge that their accounts were in most cases rather bare state- ments of facts, interspersed probably with some detailed stories from popular tradition. Cicero refuses to consider them as writers of history, because they write nothing else than meagre lists of events : ((erat enim historia nihil aliud nisi annalium conjectio. . .. sine ullis ornamentis monumenta solum temporum, hominum, locorum, gestarumque rerum. 3 To what extent Livy, however, made use of the early annalists and of evidence from the documents themselves has been a subject of much discussion. He seems to have neglected to use documentary evidence even where it was accessible, and it is not 1 One illustration of this tendency is the Short History of Rome by FERRERO AND BARBAGALLO, in which inferences about early Rome, with regard to both events and chron- ology, are grounded in an acceptance of the Romans' own records of their history. BELOCH S recent Romische Geschichte represents a critical attitude which is on the whole conservative. 2 Cf.

Cic., De Orat., ii, 12 (52 f.); AUL. GELL., ii, 28, 6.</page><page sequence="11">EARLY ROMAN TRADITIONS 17 difficult to point out instances in which he himself failed to appreciate the value of the works of Fabius and his contemporaries, as compared with the fanciful accounts of later historical romancers such as Valerius Antias. In case of a divergence among his author- ities, he ordinarily accepted the version given by the majority of the sources, with no regard for their varying worth or antiquity. 2 Livy's early books consist in large part of legendary matter which could have come from no source except popular tradition. He represents the generally accepted tradition of his day, usually in a more or less conservative version. All through his account, however, are scattered references to certain definite events and facts, of the sort which must have been preserved in the official records which we know to have been kept. These refer- ences, -notices of wars and triumphs, of founding of colonies and of temples, of making of treaties and laws, - depend undoubtedly upon documents which survived from early times; and we have therefore at least a skeleton of fact which kept the mass of tradition from wandering too far from the true course of events. 3 Since this skeleton of fact in all probability rests ultimately upon authentic documentary sources, we may discard the claims of the skeptics that the beginnings of Rome's power were falsely dated centuries too early or are completely obscured in antiquity. At the same time, with the increase of faith in the authenticity of the sources, the correctness of the underlying facts of the traditional account of early Rome is being corroborated by constantly increasing evidence from archaeological finds. As the discov- eries of the last few decades are being organized and interpreted, it is becoming more evident that Livy's account has preserved, along with the large mass of legend, the fundamental facts of the actual history of early Rome. The discovery of early cemeteries in the Forum and on the Esquiline proved the existence of a community or several communities on the site of Rome at least as early as the traditional founding of the city. These early burial finds, organized and recorded by Lanciani, Boni, and Pinza, and studied and interpreted more recently by various scholars, 4 have made possible some definite knowledge of the earliest inhabitants of Rome and of the development of the early city. While the tradition of the founding of the city from Alba Longa was once variously explained as having originated in Greek legend, or in Rome's desire to inherit the position of Alba Longa among the cities of Latium, 5 a study of the burial remains of Latium I Livy occasionally follows the story which he finds ((apud veterrimos auctores)) (ii, 18, 5; cf. 8, 5; iv, 7, 10), or accepts the authority of ((Fabius, longe antiquissimus auctor)) (ii, 40, 10; i, 55, 8; ii, 32, 3 ; 58, 1). 2E.g., i, 44,2; 55, 7-9; iv, 23, 1-3;vi,42,6. It appears from certain instances that Livy knew the earliest annals only at second hand, through the works of the Sullan historians; see MOMMSEN, Rom. Forsch., ii, 289-90; 236 ff.; ROSENBERG, Rim. Gesch., 147 ff. 3See TENNEY FRANK, ((Roman Historiography before Caesar,)) in Amer. Hist.

SCOTT reveals a peculiar relationship between the earliest inhabitants of the Alban Hills and those of Rome. A careful comparison of the finds dates this primitive civilization at Rome slightly later than the earliest settlement of the Alban Hills, and it becomes prac- tically certain that Rome was first settled by people who came from the Alban Hills. While scholars once offered various explanations for the tradition of the early admixture of Sabine stock in the Roman race, attributing it to an anticipation of a later influx of Sabines, or merely to the proximity of the Latin and Sabine territory, ' the early burials attest the truth of the traditional claim of a double ancestry for the Roman people. A careful study of the burials of the Forum and the Esquiline furnishes a means of testing the conflicting traditional and modern beliefs concerning the development of the early city. Of the varying traditions of the growth of the city modern critics have supported different versions. Livy himself confused two accounts, first representing the Capitoline as the earliest hill to be united with the original Palatine settlement, yet else- where assuming that the city developed from the Palatine and Caelian and Esquiline, with the Quirinal not added until Servius' time. While scholars have ordinarily agreed that the Palatine was probably the site of the first settlement, 2 they have often repudiated the existence of the traditional (( Septimontium, )) or any federation of seven smaller hills earlier than the union with the Capitoline and Quirinal. De Sanctis 3 defined the second stage of the city's development as a union of the Palatine with the Capitoline, and believed the Esquiline, as its name indicates, to have been for some time outside the city. Wis- sowa, and more recently Beloch, ' have argued for the existence of the Septimontium, the former on the ground of the survival of the festival of the Septimontium and of references to the (( MONTANI " of the smaller hills, the latter on the ground of topographical probability. While the absence of burial finds from the Quirinal and Capitoline precludes any conjecture as to the relative date of the occupation of these hills, the swampy valley which separated them from the Palatine makes an early union between the Palatine and Capitoline highly improbable. Remains from the Esquiline and Forum, on the other hand, show that at an early period the inhabitants of the Palatine and Esquiline were living on terms of friendly intercourse and probably making some progress toward amalgamation. The Esquiline seems to have been not the latest but the earliest settlement united with the Palatine, while there could have been no real union with the Capitoline and Quirinal until the Forum ceased to be used as a cemetery and became the common ground and the thoroughfare connecting the different hills. Livy's confusion of the two accounts of the ' PAIS, op. cit., 1, 275; MOMMSEN, Hermes, xxi, 1886, 581 ; DE SANCTIS, op. cit., 1, 220-1. 2 PAIS, Ancient Legends; DE SANCTIS, op. cit., I, 185 ff.; BELOCH, Rom.

The most skeptical of the critics once attributed the real organization of the city, and at all events the building of the city wall, to the period after the Gallic fire. But various forms of archaeological evidence now combine to restore a picture of Rome in the late sixth century which agrees essentially with Livy's representation of the powerful and prosperous city of the Tarquins. Recent study of building materials and methods of early construction has furnished scientific criteria for the dating of early monuments. 2 Although criticism for a time succeeded in destroying faith in the early date of any of the remaining monuments, certain fragments of walls and foundations are now dated, on the basis of technique and material, in the period of the Etruscan kings. While the so-called Servian wall, which still exists in large fragments on the Esquiline and Aventine, dates from the 4th century, at least one fragment of a wall of earlier material and crude technique attests the existence of an earlier fortification, built probably as early as the 6th century. Pais explained the tradition of Tarquin's building of the Capitoline temple as an anticipation of its building by Camillus in the 4th century, but the criteria from building material and style date the extant foundations in the earliest period of Roman building. These and other fragments of foundations and of early architectural decoration join in corroborating the traditional representation of the Rome of the Etruscan kings. The city which Pais dated in the century following the Gallic invasion, a city larger than any of its neighbors, protected with strong fortifications and adorned with numerous temples, -among them a temple to Jupiter which surpassed in size and grandeur any building in Latium or in Etruria at that time, - is again taking its traditional place in the late 6th century, in the period of Etruscan domination. A certain part of the traditional account is pure legend, but the essential correctness of facts and of dating is now estab- lished by evidence from actual remains of the early civilization at Rome. The tra- ditions in which the Romans themselves believed have preserved in main outline the actual history of the early city, and while criticism may attack many of the details, in the face of the evidence now available it can no longer overthrow the whole framework of the traditional account. Our knowledge of the early inhabitants of Rome, Latium, and Italy is becoming con- 'The argument of BELOCH, op. cit., 204 f., who repudiates the hypothesis that the Quirinal could have developed first as an independent city, on the ground that no instance is known of two cities growing up within the distance of 100 meters from each other, does not apply to primitive communities such as the settle- ments of the Palatine and Quirinal must have been at so early a period. In all probability the settlements on all the hills were originally independent, and the date of their union depended upon considerations of topography. The union of the Capitoline and Quirinal with the settlement of the Palatine probably came later, because it was condi- tioned by the discovery of some means of draining the valley. 2 See FRANK, Roman Buildings of the Republic (Pap. and Mon. of Am.

SCOTT stantly more definite, with the ever increasing mass of archaeological evidence and with more accurate study and interpretation of the recent discoveries. This knowledge will undoubtedly continue to increase, as further discoveries throw new light on many of the still unsolved questions. In this brief monograph I shall attempt to present the various sources of archaeological evidence in their bearing upon the early history of Rome, and in their relation to the traditional account of the development of the city. A number of the frequently discussed problems now demand reconsideration in the light of our increased knowledge of actual remains from early times. Other sources of evidence have been dealt with again and again, and have furnished varying conclusions in the hands of various scholars. But today no conclusions can be accepted as sound unless they are tested by the available evidence from archaeological finds. Interpretations of these finds have until recently been too uncertain to furnish definite conclusions, and inferences must still be tentative and subject to revision with the appearance of further evidence. But it is perhaps not too early for an attempt to apply the best accepted interpretations of recent discoveries to some of the problems of early Roman tradition.</page><page sequence="15">CHAPTER I1. THE PEOPLE OF EARLY ROME. HE traditions preserved and handed down as an authentic history of early Rome offer a picturesque and detailed account of the founding and earliest development of the city, a great part of which is pure legend. But behind the legends of Romulus and Remus and their wolf foster-mother, of the rivalry of the brothers for the honor of founding and naming the new city, of the building and fortification of the city on the Palatine, and of the earliest struggles and conquests of the newly-founded Rome, there are a few fundamental racial facts which can be subjected to investigation and criticized in the light of concrete evidence. According to the Romans' own traditions, the Roman people were originally Albans, who in the 8th century B. C. had come from their home in the Alban Hills to found a new city on the Palatine. The strength and population of this new city were increased shortly after its original founding by union with the Sabines, whom the Romans admitted into the city on equal terms with themselves. The Sabines were settled on the Capitoline, not as, at a later date, the conquered Albans were given the Caelian and the Politorians the Aventine, but as equals with equal rights of voice in the state. The traditional version of the story has them accepted as friends and brothers because of their kinship with the wives whom the Romans had stolen, and their equality of standing was shown by the election of Numa, a Sabine, as the successor of Romulus. The Roman people of the early city were, according to the Romans' own belief, a combination of Latin and Sabine stock. The legends of the founding of Rome, until comparatively recently, rested only upon the authority of the traditions themselves. But with the finding on the Esquiline and in the Forum of burials left by the earliest inhabitants of Rome, there began a series of discoveries which have led to an extensive study of pre-historic Latium and have made possible some definite knowledge of early races and race relationships. ' 1 The most valuable recent contribution to the system- atization of the burial finds of all Italy is VON DUHN'S, Italische Grdberkunde. I shall in the main follow Von Duhn's conclusions, attempting to show their significance for certain problems of early Roman tradition.</page><page sequence="16">22 INEZ G. SCOTT The early cemeteries have preserved, in bare outlines of course, a record of the first settlement of the site of Rome; and the story furnished by the burials of the Sepulcretum offers a significant parallel to the Romans' own traditions concerning their early history. When the ancestors of the Roman people were still outside the borders of Italy in the north, the greater part of the peninsula was occupied by people of neolithic stock who had lived in Italy since time immemorial. While scant remains are left to bear witness of their tenure, there are isolated finds from various parts of the peninsula which show resemblances sufficient to prove that the neolithic civilization throughout Italy was fairly homogeneous. The neolithic period seems to have developed into the eneolithic without any invasion of a new race, though not without some influence of trade with other peoples.2 From the remains it is known that the neolithic folk were an inhuming people who buried their dead in trenches or in caves, placing the body usually in a contracted position. The flint implements and primitive pottery found in the graves give evidence of the civilization attained in that age, and serve to distinguish the neolithic people from the new races which occupied northern Italy during the bronze age. The civilization of the bronze age is well known from remains of the settlements of the lake-dwellers and of the terramare people of the Po valley. Traces of terramare influence have been found at such various points in Italy as to give rise to a theory of an invasion of terramare people even into the southern part of the peninsula. 3 While there are only rare indications of the actual presence in southern Italy of this cremating race, in a few uncertain cremation burials and in one terramare settlement at Taranto, types of pottery and bronzes characteristic of the terremare occur at widely separated sites. 4 South of the Po valley the civilization of the bronze age is distinct in many ways from that of the terremare. The people lived in huts instead of in pile-dwellings, they in all probability inhumed their dead, 5 and their pottery shows many characteristics foreign to that found at terramare sites. The pottery of these hut-dwellers represents a combination of terramare and old neolithic types. Their objects of bronze are those of the terramare folk, from whom they had probably learned the use of metal, but otherwise their remains show more resemblances to neolithic finds. They were evidently the descendants of the indigenous people of the stone age, somewhat changed, however, by the influence of the invaders. 6 This indigenous race seems to have been largely displaced or absorbed by the incoming peoples of the iron age, and to have left little mark on the succeeding civilization of Italy. It remained predominant in Liguria and 1 PEET, Stone and Bronze Ages in Italy, 118 ff. 2 Ibid., Chapter XII. 3 Ibid., Chapters XV and XVI; cf.

When the cremating Italic people of the iron age invaded central Italy, then, they found the country occupied by a race whose civilization was essentially that inherited from the neolithic age but overlaid with some influence from the bronze age peoples of northern Italy. l The invaders, generally known as Villanovans, who were related to if not the descendants of the terramare folk 2 who had for a long period occupied the region farther north, took possession of the country south as far as Latium, to a great extent displacing the indigenous people whom they encountered. The advance of the Villanovans can be traced by burials found at numerous sites in the Po valley, Umbria, Etruria, and Latium. In the Po valley they continued to hold undisputed sway; in Umbria, Etruria, and Latium they were later partially and at some sites totally displaced by an inhuming people. To this cremating Italic stock belong the earliest inhabitants of the Alban Hills. The cremation burials of the Alban Hills show certain general similarities to the early cremation remains of northern Italy, and a kinship with remains of the cremating people of Tolfa, Allumiere, and of southern Etruria. The forms of pottery from Alban burials are largely the same as those of Allumiere, Corneto, and other Etruscan sites, but at the same time sufficiently more advanced to indicate that the race had occupied the country farther north for a long period before a branch came down into Latium. 3 The earliest cremation burials of southern Etruria represent a slightly earlier stage of the civilization,4 a period when the graves were less carefully made, simply shafts sunk in the earth usually without the lining of stones and without the dolium - or ((dolio, )) to use the current Italian form - to contain the pottery. Both sites are characterized by a hut urn civili- zation, and by urns of similar form and technique; but even the earliest of the Alban graves fall within the hut urn period, while the Corneto burials represent also a time before the appearance of this peculiar ossuary. By the time of the Alban burials the 1 While we know of this people chiefly from remains in Picenum and Liguria, a few finds prove their presence in the Po valley and in central Italy, in Latium and the Faliscan territory. See PEET, op. cit., Chapters XV and XVI; VON DUHN, op. cit., 1, 30 if.; cf. L. A. HOLLAND, The Faliscans, 7 ff. 2 Alban burials show some survivals of pottery from the earlier cremation civilization, Villanova urns, cups with double handles ((( ansa bifora )), wavy-bladed knives and bronze razors of half-moon shape. See RANDALL- MACIVER, Villanovans and Early Etruscans, 81, pl. V, 6, 8, 9; pl. 1I, 16, 17. MODESTOV, Introduction 'a I'Histoire Romaine, 235, believes the earliest people of the Alban Hills to be descendants of the terramare people; cf. also PIGORINI, Bull. Pal., xxix, 1903, 189-211; RANDALL- MACIVER, op. cit., 91 ff. 3Finds from Allumiere (Bull. Pal., xxxvi, 1910, pl. VI-X) show some of the forms characteristic of Alban burials, the ((askos, )) three-legged plate, cups of the same general type as the Latial cups; also an extensive use of the zig-zag incised decoration. But the vases are all much more crudely made and obviously earlier than the same forms as they occur in Alban graves. See Bull. Comm., xxviii, 1900, pls. x-xii; cf.

A few are lined with stones, and there are examples of the use of a stone dolium; see N. S., 1881, pl. V, 3, 4; 1907, 47, fig. 3; 53, fig. 7; cf.

SCOTT Villanova urn was no longer used as an ossuary but still appears as an accessory vase, sometimes showing slight variations in shape. I This same race of cremating Italic people occupied also other points of Latium during approximately the same period when they were settled in the Alban Hills. Von Duhn dates the occupation of the Alban Hills by the cremating people from approximately 1000 to 700 B. C., 2 and there are related burial remains of this same period from various sites in Latium and the vicinity, from Falerii, Narce, Velletri, Satricum, Caracupa. Common elements in all the cremation necropolises of Latium, and the occurrence of the same material in the cremation burials of southern Etruria, support the belief that a race of cremating Italians came down from the north to Etruria and at a somewhat later period crossed the Tiber and occupied a great part of Latium. Thus far the story is clear. A harder problem is to determine the degrees of rela- tionship and the relative chronology within Latium itself. Smaller differences of time are almost imperceptible in a primitive civilization, where workmanship and forms of pottery advance very slowly, and conservatism keeps the older forms along with the newer. A close examination of the finds shows a marked kinship between the early settlements of the Alban Hills and Rome, a kinship which proves almost beyond a doubt that the same race occupied both sites. The finds indicate, too, that the Roman settlement is of a somewhat later period than the Alban, and it becomes likely that, as tradition asserts, Rome was founded by settlers from Alba Longa. The civilization which grew up on the shores of the Alban Lake was centered in a number of settlements, 4 much as separate settlements first occupied the various hills of Rome. As the same situation prevailed at other sites as well, at Narce, Allumiere, and perhaps at Bisenzio and Veii, 5 it may be assumed that such was the ordinary and natural manner of occupation of a territory. Whether the separate communities later joined to form a city, as at Rome and Veii, is not certain in the case of the Alban settle- ments. 6 Near the Alban Lake there are three groups of necropolises ; 7one near Grot- taferrata, which includes the early Villa Cavalletti group and the Boschetto grave; the second near Marino, the Monte Crescenzo group of exclusively cremation burials, which includes some of the earliest material; the third near Castel Gandolfo, and further to the southwest the later necropolises of inhumation burials. 1 In Allumiere the Villanova urn is the regular os- suary (Bull. Pal., xxxvi, 1910, pls. vii-ix); in Corneto it is usual (see N. S., 1907, 228 ft., and VON DUHN, op. cit., 1, 317 fi.). In Alban burials it occurs only as an accessory vase (Bull. Comm., xxviii, 1900, pl. xii, 12 Mon. Ant., xv, pl. xix, 1). 2 See VON DUHN, op. cit., 1, 392-3. 3 See VON DUHN, op. cit., 1, part iii, Faliskerland, Latium. 4See VON DUHN, op. cit., 1, 392 f. ; also ANTONIELLI, ((Appunti di Paletnologia Laziale,)) in Bull.

Pal., xxxvi, 1910, 122. 6 Bryan suggests, op. cit., 154, because of the presence of some later material at Monte Crescenzo, that there may have been a union of different settlements there. VON DUHN, op. cit., I, 393.</page><page sequence="19">EARLY ROMAN TRADITIONS 25 The usual type of Alban burial is either a simple ((pozzo,)) or shaft, in which is set a ((dolio)) containing the pottery, or a shaft lined with blocks of basalt and covered with a large stone. I A very few of the earliest graves are simply shafts in the earth with neither dolio nor lining of stones, as the Boschetto grave near Grottaferrata, prob- ably the earliest of the Alban burials. 2 In the Sepulcretum of the Forum, as in the Alban Hills, the most usual type of burial is the dolio grave; the dolio occurs in eleven out of the fifteen cremation burials, while of the remaining graves two (Q and R) are shafts lined with stones and one (PP) is a burial destroyed by a later fossa, of which all that remains is a hut urn in a fossa grave. Thus the more advanced form occurs even more consistently in the Forum than in the Alban necropolis. At best only tentative infer- ences can be based upon such a relatively small number of graves from a necropolis which once probably extended the full length of the Forum. 3 But if the section discovered is a representative part of the whole, as it is reasonable to suppose, we may conclude that the earliest period of Alban burials is not represented in Rome; the Forum graves are contem- poraneous, in the form of the grave at least, with the more advanced of the Alban graves. The contents of the graves throw much light upon the question of relationship. The hut urn burials of the Alban Hills are unique among the burials of Latium, in the effort apparently made to give the dead an abode similar to that which he had had in life. While the people of southern Etruria were turning their attention to the ornamen- tation of the vases which they buried with the dead, the artisans of Alba were making as burial furniture miniature representations of the things needed in a dwelling. The hut urn itself was a miniature of the round or elliptical huts of the villages of Latium. 4 The 1 VON DUHN, op. cit., 1, 396; Ann. Inst., xliii, 1871, tav. U. 2 Bull. Comm., xxviii, 1900, 363; VON DUHN, op. cit., I, 397. Another such grave is reported in N. S., 1902, 138, fig. 3. 3 See VON DUHN, op. cit., 1, 414-17. Von Duhn believes the Sepulcretum to have extended the whole length of the Forum from the Velia to the slope of the Capitoline. The graves came very close to the foundations of the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina, with no ap- parent break which would indicate the end of the cemetery. A number of early vases were found in a block of travertine beneath the equestrian statue of Domitian, evidently discovered by the builders of the statue and preserved and replaced (HULSEN-CARTER, Roman Forum2, 143 f.; Rdm. Mitt., xx, 1905, 71-73). This find suggests that the original necropolis extended at least as far as this Part of the Forum. At the W. end, also, near the Volcanal, traces of fosse and pozzi have been observed (FRANK, op. cit., 59). ' This is proved by the discovery of foundations of dwellings, round or elliptical, at Satricum, one of the related sites. See DELLA SETA, Museo di Villa Giulia, 1, 235 ff. BRYAN, op. cit., 162-3, advances the theory that the hut urns originated in Latium and only later reached southern Etruria. They occur earliest in Latium and from all probabilities seem to have been an invention of that region. The necropolis of Corneto shows hut urns of an advanced type, and elsewhere hut urns are usually later than the earliest examples in the Alban Hills. The ossuaries with hut urn covers, which perhaps mark the first step in the evolution of the urn, are more frequent in the Alban burials than anywhere else, and even here they occur only in the earliest period (see BRYAN'S chronological table, p. 170). There is one example from Bisenzio -and one from the Sepulcretum in Rome (N. S., 1902, 102, Grave A), fourteen from the Alban Hills and Grottaferrata (see BRYAN'S, List 11, pp. 193-196). The preliminary stage, therefore, seems represented practically only in the Alban Hills. The developed hut urn was passed on from Alba to Rome, brought to Rome probably with the original settlers from Alba. Only later does it occur in southern Etruria and elsewhere in Latium. There is only one other example from Latium, a hut urn from Velletri which is of somewhat later date (see BRYAN, List 1; N. S., 1893, 200, fig. 2; 210). ,4</page><page sequence="20">26 INEZ G. SCOTT numerous vases with rectangular bases known as ocalefattoi)) may have represented minia- ture stoves; 1 other objects of uncertain use suggest the form of candelabra 2 and might have been part of the furnishing of the tiny dwelling. Small oblong vases common in Alban graves might be either incense holders or miniature lamps. 3 The personal needs of the departed also received attention: with the other burial furnishings were sometimes placed miniature knives, and somewhat later miniature swords and shields and lances; in a few later burials, probably of women, there were terra-cotta spinning whorls. The weap- ons are relatively rare even in the more advanced graves, 4 but a few examples are cited by Pigorini (Bull. Pal., ix, 1883, 98 ff.). A short sword and a shield too small for use (pl. vi, 3) must have had some ritual significance. It may be, though it cannot be asserted positively, that the early Albans even placed in the grave a miniature representation of the dead. The crude figurines found some- times in the urn and sometimes between the urn and the dolio wall may have repre- sented the owner of the miniature dwelling. A number are masculine,5 one of inde- terminate sex 6 was found in what was probably a woman's grave ; but as it is not al- ways known whether the sex agrees with that of the dead there can be only a conjecture as to thelr slgnlficance. This distinctive form of burial characteristic of the early Albans appears in the Sepulcretum consistently enough to establish a closer relationship between Rome and the Alban Hills than exists between these and other sites in Latium. The hut urn common in Alban burials occurs elsewhere in Latium only in Rome and in one instance at Vel- letri. Though other characteristic objects are found occasionally elsewhere in Latium, they occur much more consistently in the Forum than at any other site. The rather elaborate effort to provide the dead with representations of his home and the things he had needed in life has, however, comparatively few survivals even in the Forum graves. The idea which prompted the Alban form of burial has apparently gone, leaving only some characteristic pottery forms to show that it had existed. The figurines and the miniature weapons do not occur at all, but there are occasional examples of the other typical Alban objects, a ((calefattoio ) in Grave Y, little boat-shaped lamps in Graves Q, N, and A. A few cups of an old Alban form 7 are so small that they must have been made as miniatures. It seems that the Alban burial custom has partially disappeared, but that a few of the ritual objects linger on as survivals. 1 VON DUHN, op. cit., I, 404; Bull. Comm., xxvi, 1898, 120; Mont.

The hut urns themselves are very similar to Alban examples. One Forum grave (A) has a pitcher-shaped ossuary with a hut urn cover, a combination which occurs frequently in the Alban Hills.' The reticulate jars characteristic of Alban bu- rials 2 occur frequently in the Foruin graves. 3 Of the little three-leggend tables common in Alban graves there is one example in Forum Grave C; ' cups with lip turned inward and decorated with obugne") occur both in Alban and Forum graves; Villanova urns with slight variations from the regular form and the cups with high crescent handles are com- mon to both sites. 5 The double-handled cup occurs in both Alban and Forum burials, and there are other incidental similarities in individual vases of less typical forms. 6 Some of the forms which have been cited as showing relationship between the Alban Hills and Rome occur occasionally at other sites in Latium and in southern Etruria, I but only between Alban and Roman burials do the simnilarities occur with any consistency. The cremation burials of Rome without doubt belonged to the same civilization as those of the Alban Hills, though to the same civilization at a slightly later stage of development. The same conclusions result from a comparison of the types of fibulae characteristic of Roman and Alban burials. In Alban graves the typical forms are the simple bow fibula, which is common elsewhere as well, and the twisted fibula vith a spiral disc at the clasp; the more advanced types are entirely lacking. 8 In the Forum these same forms occur only in the earliest of the graves (the simple bow fibula in Grave T, the spiral form in Graves U, Y, and S), 9 although the whole period of the cremation graves seems to have 1 See also BRYAN, op. cit., List II. 2 Bull. Comm., xxviii, 1900, pl. X, 6 (reproduced in P1. I A); XII, 13, etc. These jars occur very rarely north of the Tiber. Examples from Bisenzio, Von Duhn believes (op. cit., 336), show trade connections with Latium. An example from Vetulonia (FALCHI, Vetulonia, pl. XVII, 25) is quite different and unquestionably of later make. The reticulate jars common in Marsilian fossa graves (MINTO, Marsiliana, 286) are of a different type, much more carefully finished than examples in Latium. 3 Two in Grave A, N.

N. S., 1902, 154, fig. 34. 6 The dolio of Grave DD is like one from an Alban burial (N. S., 1911, 167, fig. 10; cf. Mlon. Ant., xv, pl. XIX, 16). Similarly the dolio of N (N. S., 1905, 171, fig. 43) is like one from the Alban Hills shown in Bull. Comm., xxviii, 1900, pl. XII, 21. ' Mon. Ant., xv, 434, lists characteristically Alban objects found at other sites. Their occurrence, however, is sporadic and insignificant compared with the consistent occurrence of the same forms in Roman and Alban burials. A little three-legged table was found in the hut urn burial at Velletri, along with other primitive pottery (Mon. Ant., xv, 342-3); Von Duhn (op. cit., 409 f.) considers its presence a sign of some influx from the Alban Hills. A ((calefattoio)) was found at Ardea (Mon. Ant., xv, pl. XXII, 12), of somewhat different type from those occurring in the Alban Hills and Rome. Still different types occur at Falerii and in Faliscan territory (see L. A. HOLLAND, Faliscans; MONTELIUS, 310, 6, 11; 322, 5); and at Veii (Cat. of Vases in Brit. Mus., I, part 2, Introd., XXVI, and 216 df.). A little lamp occurs in a hut urn burial at Bisenzio (VON DUHN, op. cit., I, 403, 422; cf. in general Ann. Inst., Ivii, 1885, 52). 8 See VON DUHN, op. cit., 405. 9 These same graves had other very early material: Y, a ((calefattoio)) and two reticulate jars, T and S reti- culate jars.</page><page sequence="22">28 INEZ G. SCOTT been too early for the appearance of later fibulae characteristic of the inhumation period. In cremation graves of the Forum no advanced forms of fibulae occur to prove them later than the Alban burials, but the gradual disappearance of the earlier forms is in itself significant. The graves which have the finer pottery, Q, R, and GG, have no fibulae at all; Y, which has the one (( calefattoio, ) has also one of the spiral fibulae. Later material, such as painted ware, amber and paste beads, ornaments of precious metal or even of bronze, is of very rare occurrence in both Alban and Forum burials. In the Alban necropolis one grave yielded a gold spiral along with several bronze spirals, amber beads, and a number of spinning whorls; another a bulla and rings of bronze; 2 another a single armlet of bronze.3 The Forum graves likewise yielded a very small number of later objects. Grave Q had fragments of a bronze ring and two amber beads, Grave V fragments of a bronze ring, Grave GG two amulets or pendants of bronze, a small amount of amber, fragments which may have been part of a necklace, and a gold spiral. 4 The same grave contained a hut urn with painted meander pattern, a form of urn decoration paralleled in one example from the Alban Hills. s It will be noticed that in cremation burials of both Alba and Rome there is a remarkable scarcity of ornaments of any kind, even of bronze. In both Alban and Forum graves there is a noticeable absence of metal; iron occurs in none of the graves, and bronze only rarely in the few fibulae, the miniature arms and knives at Alba, and an occasional ring or spiral. The total absence of bronze weapons is probably significant of the life of a peaceful agricultural people, although the presence of miniature weapons proves that they were known. It becomes evident from a study of the Alban and Roman cremation burials that we are dealing with the same civilization, one which prevailed at both places at approxi- mately the sarme period. That the Alban Hills were occupied somewhat earlier than the first settlement of Rome is shown by the occurrence there of occasional graves more crudely made than any at Rome, and by the presence of a burial custom, - that of furnishing the dead with a miniature dwelling and all its equipment, - of which there are only a few pottery forms still surviving in the burials of the Forum. While there occur no advanced forms of fibula which could prove that the Forum. cremation burials extended into a later period than the Alban, the growing rarity of the old forms points to a slight advance in time. There are, then, a number of indications, none of them conclusive in- dividually but significant as cumulative evidence, that the early settlement on the site of 1N. S., 1902, 154, figs. 38-41. 2 N. S., 1902, 192. 3 Mon. Ant., xv, 351, pl. XX, 28. There are apparently a very few cremation burials of a later period; three at San Rocco near Marino have fibulae ((a navicella, ") one with elongated foot (N. S., 1908, 356-7), forms which did not exist at Alba at the period of most of the cremation burials. One of these same graves contained a weapon of iron and a vase of fine clay with a fine cream finish, like one from an Esquiline burial which contained other later material (Mon. Ant., xv, 79, tomb XIX). One more burial, an ossuary within a fossa, is reported as yielding imported vases (Bull. Comm., xxviii, 1900, 207). These must be merely survivals.

Mus., I, part II, H 1.</page><page sequence="23">EARLY ROMAN TRADITIONS 29 Rome, unquestionably by the same race which occupied the Alban Hills, was made at a somewhat later date by people from the Alban settlement. The evidence is more significant because it corroborates the Roman tradition that Romulus came from Alba Longa and founded an Alban city on the site of Rome. While there is no positive proof from the burial remains that the original settlement to which the cremation burials belonged was, as tradition asserts, on the Palatine instead of on any other of the hills, ' it is true that the Forum valley would be the natural place for the people of a community on the Palatine to choose as a burial ground, a place outside the settlement, as was customary, and yet just beneath the slopes of their hill village. 2 While the date of the cremation civilization at Rome cannot be determined with ac- curacy, the approximate period is not inconsistent with the traditional date of the found- ing of Rome. The cremation burials are in general earlier than the inhumation graves which finally displaced them in the Sepulcretum. But the inhumation civilization too had developed at Rome for a considerable period before the first infiltration of foreign influence, which became evident in the 8th and early 7th centuries in new pottery forms, imported pottery, amber and paste ornaments. The cremation civilization, then, must have flour- ished at least as early as the middle of the 8th century; indeed it is probable that the cremating people first occupied the site considerably earlier.3 In actual fact, therefore, the traditional ((founding of Rome)) in the 8th century does not date the beginning of a city on a site unoccupied before, but does record correctly the time when a number of early communities were growing up on some of the seven hills of Rome. In the traditional account of the development of the newly founded Rome the first great increase in the city was the admixture of the Sabine element, -according to the traditional version the admission of the Sabine people into the state as friends and equals as a result of a compromise which averted a war. However the Sabine people came into Rome, - and the circumstances as we have them are of course purely legendary, - the tradition has preserved the essential fact, that a foreign element which is probably Sabine appears in Rome very early in the history of its development. The arrival of a different race from the original Alban settlers is proved by the change of burial rite in the Sepulcretum from cremation to inhumation, and by the almost ex- clusive prevalence of inhumation burials on the Esquiline and Quirinal. That the new race came later and had not lived side by side with the cremating people since the first occupation of the site is an almost necessary conclusion from the arrangement of the Forum graves. The inhumation graves are consistently at a higher level than the crema- tion burials, and, further, a number of the inhumation or ((fossa ) graves have cut into 'See Chapter I1. 2 See VON DUHN, op. cit., 1, 414-5. 3 VON DUHN, op. cit., I, 392-3, dates the cremation civilisation of the Alban Hills approximately between 1000 and 700 B.

The pozzo graves were perhaps so poorly marked that later graves might easily cut into the earlier, although the cremating people did not abandon the burial ground until long after the arrival of the inhuming race. As far as the contents of the graves are concerned, there is no proof that the earliest of the fossa graves might not be contemporaneous with the early cremation burials. Eight of the twenty-seven fossa graves yield no material which dates them later than the very earliest period; four of the burials have no metal at all2 and none but very primitive hand-made pottery; four have only primitive pottery and early forms of fibulae. Three spiral fib- ulae come from Graves B, P, and KK; 3 a simple bow fibula from KK. ' The pottery of these early inhumation burials is largely the same as that of the cremation graves of the Alban Hills and Rome, crude hand-made flat cups of the Alban form, 5 cups with high double handles ((( ansa bifora )) common in Alban burials, 6 Villanova urns of modi- fied form, and jars decorated with knobs or ((bugne. )' The double-handled cups de- corated with zig-zag lines or oblique striations occur, still very crude as compared with the later examples of the same forms frequent in later inhumation burials. 8 The occur- rence of certain of the same forms of pottery in both cremation and inhumation burials may signify that the two peoples had occupied the site side by side for a period sufficient to allow some mutual borrowing; or it may show simply the survival among both peoples of old forms which had been common since an earlier age before the two races were separate, - an inheritance from a common ancestry. In the case of the two peoples who buried their dead in the Forum probably both conjectures are partially correct. Such forms as the double-handled cup and the cup with high lunate handle9 are so common in Italy in both cremation and inhumation burials that they are clearly old forms which 1 Two inhumation burials also are truncated by later fosse; J and HH are cut by I and II (N.

XIII, 15; 1907, 242, fig. 47, etc.). Bull. Pal., xxiii, 1897, 78-9 cites occurrences of this form from various sites in Italy. It is a type handed down from the bronze age folk of northern Italy and inherited by both races. The cup with lunate handle appears in both cremation and inhumation graves at various sites in northern and central Italy (Bull. Pal., xv, 1889, 65-77; 122, 193; xvi, 54). It occurs occasionally in Rome both in the Forum and on the Esquiline (N. S., 1902, 102 ff.; Mon. Ant., xv, pl. IV, 5, 7, 14 ; V, 6, 10, 18).</page><page sequence="25">EARLY ROMAN TRADITIONS 31 both peoples had inherited from an earlier age. It is likely on the other hand that the two races used the Forum as a burial ground simultaneously long enough to allow some mingling of forms. For the earliest fossa graves are unquestionably of an earlier period than the cremation graves which contained amber and fragments of gold. Yet even the very earliest fossa graves must be later than the first cremation burials, for two of the earliest, B and PP, truncate still earlier pozzo graves. Whether there was an actual inter- mingling of the two races during the time when they lived side by side and used the same cemetery cannot be determined witlh any great certainty, since elements in common may indicate either an intermingling of the races or merely the mutual borrowing naturally resulting from proximity. One inhumation grave, PP, contained an ossuary and ashes along with its own pottery. While this occurrence of an ossuary in a fossa grave might possibly imply the mingling of the two rites in the same family, it is more probable that when the fossa happened to destroy an earlier pozzo the urn was simply left in the grave out of respect for the earlier burial. The whole inhumation period is represented in Rome by twenty-seven graves of the Forum, between one and two hundred tombs and ((groups)) of tombs 2 on the Esquiline, and a few graves on the Quirinal. There is no appreciable separation in time between the Esquiline and Forum burials, although the Esquiline burials continue into a later period, while the Forum graves show no material later than the seventh century. 3 As we have seen, some of the old forms prevalent in the cremation and earliest inhumation burials linger on even into the later inhumation period when foreign importations be- come frequent. 4 Such forms as the double-handled cup, the pots adorned with ((bugne, and the modified Villanova urn occur all through the inhumation period, though in more developed and finer forms and with increasing rarity. 5 Certain forms of pottery characteristic of the Alban and Roman cremation civilization fail to appear altogether in the inhumation burials. The ((calefattoi)) are absent, the little three-legged plates, the boat-shaped lamps, 6 the flat vases with horizontal handles have hone out of use. The characteristic reticulate jars have practically ceased to appear.7 In the Esquiline burials, as in the Forum fossa graves, there still occur a few of the prim- itive forms of fibulae. From all the inhumation burials there are fifteen of the simple 1 A number of vase forms of both peoples are apparently developments from forms found at terramare sites or in neolithic necropolises; see Bull. Comm,., xxviii, 1900, 192. 2 These are described by PINZA in Mon. Ant., xv, nos. I-CLXIV. The ((groups)) include several burials in one locality, the contents of which were not kept separate. 3 The latest material, the proto-Corinthian pottery, is dated early in the seventh century; see H. L. LORIMER, ((The Fabrics called Proto-Corinthian,)) J. H. S., xxxii, 1912, 326 ff. 4See Mon. Ant., xv, pl. VIII, 7, 8, 14, 17; Bull. Comm., xxviii, 1900, pl.

SCOTT bow form, but of these all but one have the bow slightly enlarged and are less primitive than those of the cremation burials. 1 These early forms are rare, however, in comparison with the later fibulae, and they become more rare as the burials are later. The general character of the inhumation finds shows clearly that a different civilization had appeared in Rome, which though beginning at some time during the cremation period, belonged largely to a later time. During the greater part of this later period foreign importations were beginning to appear in Rome. Some new elements appearing in the inhumation burials are, however, apparently independent of foreign influence. One marked change from the old burial equipment is the appearance for the first time of weapons, spear points and swords of both bronze and iron. Their frequency in inhumation graves of the Esquiline is the more striking because of the complete absence of arms of all sorts in the cremation graves. The appearance of weapons in great frequency for the first time with the inhuming people who seem to have displaced the other stock completely at some points, as at Alba, Falerii, in Umbria, and to some extent at Rome, suggests a conjecture as to the circumstances of the change of race. Possibly the new people invaded and occupied the territory by force of arms, with their weapons easily superior to the unwarlike race whom they found already settled in the country. The total absence of weapons in both Alban and Roman cremation graves may very well reflect their unwarlike character and peaceful interests, although the occasional presence of miniature weapons in Alban graves proves that the cremating people were not ignorant of weapons. It seems quite possible that a more warlike element was added to the character of the Roman race by the admixture of the inhuming stock. But the situation shown by the total absence of weapons in the earliest inhumation burials and the same rarity of metal as in the cremation graves, does not attest a sudden hostile invasion which overwhelmed the earlier people and left the new race in possession of the site. An inference from the early traditions themselves may perhaps point to the true course of events. Livy tells of the constanit struggles of the newly-founded Roman community against one after another hostile advance of the Sabines, 2 even after a branch of the Sabine people had been incorporated into the community. It is both possible and natural that the new race came into the plain of Latium in wave after wave, at first in fewer numbers, settling peaceably among the people who already occupied the various sites; then at a somewhat later time, pushed on perhaps by the 1 Grave XLII has the simplest fibula and is apparently an early grave. Others which have fibulae of simple type but with slightly enlarged bow are XV, XIX, XXII, XXIII, XXV, XXXIV, XXXVII, LXIII, LXV, XCVI, XCVIII, CIII. These ordinarily occur together with pottery of slightly advanced period. 2 For evidence of Sabine penetration into neighboring territories at about this period see L. R. TAYLOR, Local Cults in Etruria (Pap. and Mon. of Am. Acad. in Rome, 11, 1923), 49 if.; L. A. HOLLAND, Faliscans, 54-5, points out Sabine influences in pottery forms of the Faliscan territory and of Rome.

Such a theory would account for the disappearance of cremation burials from the Sepulcretum long before it ceased to be used as a burial ground. It is rather probable that at first the inhuming people occupied the site in fewer numbers, settled perhaps on the Esquiline, and to some extent mingled peaceably with the earlier stock; and that later a real invasion occurred, as a result of which the inhuming people were for a time the predominant race. A few signs of progress in the material possessions of the inhuming people are not dependent, unless indirectly, on the introduction of foreign importation. Types of fibulae in inhumation tombs show a gradual advance rather than any sudden change due to influence from outside. The simple fibula appears with slightly enlarged bow, and seems to remain for some time in this transitional stage between the old simple bow form and the elaborate forms with large hollow arc and elongated foot. New elements are added gradually; first the bow is somewhat enlarged but accompanied by no other ornament, later the fibula appears with rings on the pin or on the bow itself. The same form developed later into a fibula with amber discs on the bow and with other variations imitated from imported Etruscan forms, but for a long time the fibulae show only the natural development from the simplest form occurring in the earliest burials. The old forms of pottery, with some slight variations, appear in the inhumation period in vases of finer workmanship. There are developed forms of the old double- handled cup, I there are numerous vases clearly dependent on the old Villanova urn, 2 and well-made vases of the old form ornamented with ((bugnette.)) 3 These more finely made vases, which perpetuate old types, occur in great abundance before imported pottery appears to any great extent. But it is also true that new methods and better technique, due to imitation of foreign pottery, may have resulted in improved local wares even while the foreign vases themselves were still too rare to appear in burials.4 Certain it is that the improvement in technique was a continued process, and that the most developed examples of old types of pottery are contemporaneous with the local imitations of Greek vases. Some time later than their first appearance and after some period, apparently, of independent development, the inhumation burials begin to show marked influence of foreign trade. This period of foreign importation is characterized both by the presence 'Mon. Ant., xv, pl. V, 4; VI, 7. 2Mon. Ant., xv, pl. VI, 15; V, 17; IV, 3, 15. 3 Mon. Ant., xv, pl. VI, 3, 4, 6, 15. 4 At Veii, for example, the earlier tombs of the E- truscan period, both camera tombs and trench graves with loculi, show numerous vases of fine workmanship which perpetuate old types, while later these old forms become increasingly rare (N. S., 1919, 7). The old wavy-bladed knives and other native objects occur occasionally in Etruscan tombs (RANDALL-MACIVER, op. cit., pls. V, VI, VIII, IV; Bull. Comm., xxviii, 1900, 192; VON DUHN, op. cit., 583). 5</page><page sequence="28">34 INEZ G. SCOTT of imported ware in the graves and by imitation of Greek forms in native impasto and in bucchero. Methods of making pottery have improved, probably by the stimulus of new forms and materials as well as by the coming of artists from Etruria and elsewhere. The vases are wheel-turned and often decorated with painted lines or elaborate incised patterns of fine workmanship. Variations of the kantharos, the kylix, the pyxis, and the skyphos occur frequently in native clay purified and well baked, or in bucchero. ' There are fibulae of elaborate types similar to those of Etruscan tombs, the forms ((a navicella") and ((a sanguisuga,)) sometimes with elongated foot and ornamented with rings or perforated amber discs on the bow. The fibulae of precious metals so common in Etruria fail to appear, but fibulae disappear altogether from Roman burials at about the time when the next advance would be the appearance of elaborate fibulae of gold and silver. 2 Amber and paste beads and other ornaments of ivory, amber, or precious metals appear during the period of foreign importation, while ornaments even of bronze become much more frequent than before. The foreign influence which introduced this new wealth of orna- ment and the great advance in technique of pottery was due in all probability to the Etruscans. Similarities to the pottery and ornament of Etruscan tombs are sufficient to show the origin of the new innovations, and to indicate further that Greek wares first came into Latium by way of Etruria, where they were always much more common. 3 Questions have been raised as to the identity of the inhuming stock which during the same period occupied numerous sites in Latium as well as Rome. The inhumation burials of Latium show that various tribes of the same race, in the same stage of civiliz- ation, occupied various sites throughout this whole region. The inhumation finds of Rome have close parallels, in pottery, ornament, weapons, and other objects, with the inhumation finds from other sites, from the Alban Hills, Falerii, Capena, Lavinium, Caracupa, and Satricum." The inhuming civilization of the period seems to have been fairly homoge- neous throughout Latium and in Faliscan territory, as well as related to that of the inhuming peoples who during the same time had spread through much of the central part of the peninsula and southward into Campania and Samnium. s In answer to the ' Mon.

It is significant that in Tomb XCIV, which has armor much like that of the Tomb of the Warrior at Corneto, there is a total absence of fibulae, in strange contrast to the wealth of fibulae from the Etruscan tomb. Other more advanced tombs, XIII, XIV, L, LXXVIII, LXXIX, also lack fibulae entirely. 3 There is some evidence of trade with Cumae as early as the 6th century; see FELL, Etruria and Rome, 34, 39; cf. Mon. Ant., xxii, 382 ff. 4 The inhumation finds from various sites of Latium, while they show many local differences, show also a gen- eral homogeneity of civilization. There are numerous specific parallels: Alban finds (Bull. Comm., xxviii, 1900, pl. XIII) show forms and technique very similar to Esquiline finds (M4orn. Ant., xv, pls. VIII-X); from Lavin- ium (Mon. Ant., xiii, 165) there are aarule)) like those of Esquiline tombs (Bull. Comm., iii, 1875, pls. VI-VIII, 2-4), along with other material of the same character as that of Roman graves of the period. Bronze amulets like those found on the Esquiline (Mon. Ant., xv, 86, fig. 38) come from Caracupa, Conca, and Falerii (N. S., 1909, 254, fig. 14; 255, n. 1). 5 See VON DUHN, op. cit., 1, part ii.</page><page sequence="29">EARLY ROMAN TRADITIONS 35 question of the identity of this race, one proposed hypothesis is that the inhumation burials of the most primitive period belonged to the descendants of the neolithic people, while those of the more advanced period belonged to the Etruscans themselves. There is unquestionably abundant evidence of Etruscan influence in the civilization of Latium at this time, and this inhuming people, if not Etruscans, were at least dominated to a great extent by Etruscan culture. To see the likeness between the finds of the period in Latium and the remains of Etruscan civilization, one has only to look at the inven- tories of the Etruscan tombs. The fibulae of graves in Latium are simpler forms of the same shape as those from Vetulonia and Corneto. 2 The Greek pottery and the Greek forms in bucchero and native clay reflect everywhere the dependence of the inhum- ation civilization of Latium on the Etruscan. Frequently the vases of Latium are imitations in pottery of Etruscan metal vases. ' The short dagger-like swords which ap- pear at various places in Latium are of a form similar to those of Etruscan tombs. 5 While the likenesses to Etruscan remains are marked, the burials of Latium still contrast sharply with the rich Etruscan tombs, most of all in their comparative poverty in metal and in their general simplicity of funeral equipment. The fact that numerous types of vases, ornaments, and other objects common in Etruscan burials never occur at all in finds in Latium indicates that the inhuming people were a non-Etruscan race whose civilization shows marks of close trade connections with Etruria, rather than that they were Etruscans themselves. In inhumation burials of Latium there is no more than a mere shadow of the wealth and display of the tombs which can be assigned to the Etruscans. There are further indications that the inhuming people of Latium were not Etruscans but another people under the influence of trade with Etruria or under Etruscan domination. The inhumation period begins too early and in too primitive a stage of civilization to allow the assumption that all the inhumation burials are Etruscan. Not only in Rome but in Falerii and Veii the earliest of the fossa graves are apparently contemporaneous, if not with the oldest of the cremation burials, at least with those of an early period. These must be of a time before the Etruscans entered Italy; 6 for there is a long period See RANDALL-MACIVER, op. cit., 39-40, 73 ff. 2 See RANDALL-MACIVER, op. cit., pl. 23, 128. 3 N.

The early inhumation and cremation tombs of Etruscan sites are clearly ante- cedent to these.</page><page sequence="30">36 INEZ G. SCOTT of development between these primitive burials and those which show any of the foreign importations which would naturally appear with a race coming from the east by sea, as the Etruscans are believed to have come. The solution proposed by Randall-Maclver is that the earliest graves belonged to the descendants of the old neolithic stock with which the cremating people had intermingled, and that only the more advanced of the inhu- mation burials are Etruscan. There is, however, no sharp break in the character of the inhumation remains, such as would inevitably occur with the appearance of a new race whose civilization was in total contrast with that of the simple inhuming people who first settled in Rome. At Vetulonia, one of the few sites where the earliest stage of Etruscan civilization in Italy can be observed, l the change of race is marked by a sharp break in culture, by the sudden appearance of rich tomb furnishings and of gold and silver ornament. At other sites also the coming of the Etruscans brings a marked change. 2 At Veii, while a transitional stage can be observed in one district, where the archaic camere and fosse still show old Italic types in vases of advanced technique, even the earliest of the Etruscan tombs have rich burial furnishings and are accompanied by a corresponding increase in wealth of burial in the fossa and pozzo graves of the period. 3 The inhumation burials in Rome show a gradual advance from a primitive state of civ- ilization to a culture which was thoroughly Etruscanized. The elements of new civiliz- ation appear gradually, at first in very small innovations and in slightly increased wealth of burial. At no point is there a break in the continuity of the inhuming civilization which could indicate the appearance of a different race. The Etruscans were a foreign people who brought from the eastern Mediterranean a new culture, certain elements of which they made common in central Italy by winning a temporary sway over a great part of Umbria, Latium, and Campania. While they imposed their rule, and to some extent their civiliz- ation, upon the native inhabitants of the country, even in Etruria they must always have remained in the minority so far as numbers were concerned. The fact that almost all the sites occupied by the Etruscans how both cremation and inhumation burials of a longs period before the appearance of any foreign influence indicates that the bulk of the popu- lation even in the great centers of Etruscan power was an Italic people under the domi- nation of the foreign invaders. There is a continuity of development shown in the inhumation burials of Rome which precludes the possibility of their belonging to different races, the earlier to a people of neolithic stock and the later to the Etruscans. To the same race which left the earliest of the inhumation burials belong also the numerous tombs of slightly advanced period 1 See RANDALL-MACIVER, op. cit., 103 ff. 2 See N. S., 1898, 389; Brizio notes a distinction not only archaeologically but topographically between the tombs of the Etruscans and those of the earlier Italic people. 3 N. S., 1919, 5. 4 At Veii and at Falerii there were both cremation and inhumation necropolises, at Vetulonia, Corneto, and elsewhere there were cremation necropolises of a period before the Etruscans came.</page><page sequence="31">EARLY ROMAN TRADITIONS 37 which contain bronze spears and native pottery of well-baked impasto and simpler forms of bronze ornament, as well as those which show much native material along with some foreign ware. There are two theories concerninlg the origin of this inhuming iron age folk of cen- tral Italy. The theory of Randall-Maclver, ' which is made untenable by linguistic evidence as well as by the character of the burials themselves, is that they were an in- digenous race, descendants of the neolithic people who once inhabited the whole of the peninsula. It is known that the neolithic age developed into the eneolithic with no change of race, and remains of the iron age in Picene and Ligurian territory illustrate the con- tinuous development, with some outside influence but with no invasion of a new race, fronm neolithic times. 2 Randall-Maclver believes the earliest inhuming people of Latium were of this indigenous stock, a non-Indo-European people unrelated to the cremating Italic race. Their rite of inhumation, foreign, it is true, to the Italic race, he regards as an inheritance from their neolithic ancestors, strengthened perhaps by contact with the Etruscans. The second theory is that of Von Duhn, which, though it may itself be subject to modifications as further evidence is disclosed, better accounts for a number of facts which the other hypothesis fails to explain. Von Duhn's theory is that the inhumation burials belonged to a second branch of the Indo-European Italic race, which came into Italy from the north at some time later than the arrival of the cremating Italians, spread down through the mountain region of central Italy and into Campania and Samnium, and to some extent, especially in districts near the Tiber, displaced the earlier cremating tribes which had settled Etruria and Latium. The remains left by inhuming people over this wide area show certain common elements and a general similarity which claims for them a common racial origin. The question of the identity of this people can in any case be no more than the question of which was the predominating element, Italic or neolithic. For in the remains of all the primitive peoples appear forms of pottery and other objects which show bor- rowing and absorption of elements from neighboring civilizations. Eneolithic remains of southern Italy show some material characteristic of the bronze age civilization of the north ; the Picenes and Ligurians, of neolithic stock, possessed certain forms of pottery and bronzes characteristic of the terremare; 3 and the terramare people and the related cremating folk of the iron age show some absorption of neolithic elements. 4~ The inhum- ming people of central Italy likewise show some relationship both with the cremating 1 This theory is held by RANDALL-MACIVER (op. cit., 39, 77 ff.), and by PIGANIOL, Essai sur les Origines de Rome, 1917. 2 See Bull.

SCOTT Italic races of the bronze and iron ages and with the neolithic Picenes. Double rela- tionships are even more to be expected in case of a people occupying a position geograph- ically between the Italic and Picene races. To whichever stock they are more closely related, some borrowing from both is inevitable. Survival of neolithic forms in the pottery of the iron age can offer no argument for the neolithic origin of the inhuming people, because such survival is no more marked in the remains of the inhuming than in those of the cremating race. 1 It indicates nothing more than a certain amount of assimilation of neolithic culture by races which in occupying Italy must have partially absorbed, partially displaced, the indigenous people whom they encountered. Much more striking than their preservation of neolithic elements is the close simil- arity of the earliest inhumation graves to the burials of the cremating Italic race. The burials of the inhuming people who first appeared in Rome, for example, show certain marked resemblances to the earlier cremation tombs. The difference of identity is proved by the difference of burial rite and by the absence of the peculiar pottery which charac- terized the cremation burials of Rome and the Alban Hills. But except for the hut urn itself, the miniature representations of furnishings of a dwelling, and the peculiarly Latin reticulate jars, the pottery of the earliest cremation tombs is almost indistinguish- able from that of the most primitive fossa graves. The new people were apparently poorer in pottery, and at first contributed no new forms of their own. But what vases they possessed were of the same types and the same technique as the ordinary accessory vases of the cremation burials. The biconical urn, the simple dciottole)) and cups with lip turned in, and the double-handled cup are all common to both races. The same types of decoration, the simple zig-zag, the obugnette, )) the ((wolf's tooth)) incised ornament, char- acterize the pottery of both pozzo and fossa graves. The same is true of the fibulae. In the Sepulcretum the two most primitive fibulae, the simple bow and the spiral forms, are the only types known to the earliest arrivals of both races, and they occur only in the earliest of the burials of both rites. The same close relation with the old cre- mation civilization is to be observed in the inhuming people who settled in the Faliscan territory. The first to arrive brought little that was new, but by their coming seemed rather to strengthen the connections with early cremation sites. Several objects usually 1 The decoration with ((bugnette)) characteristic of the pottery of both races of the iron age seems to have been a feature of neolithic pottery as well (Bull. Pal., xxxiii, 1907, 115-6, pl. XI, 3). Convex cups with flat bottom and straight lip are old neolithic forms which are common in terramare finds, and survive to some extent in the iron age (Bull.

Jars with cylindrical neck and large convex body, of the same general form as the Villanova urn, appear in neolithic finds as well as in iron age finds of Etruria and Latium (Bull. Pal., xxxiii, 1907, 208-9; xxxiv, 1908, 37 i.; PEET, op. cit., 95, 98; cf. N. S., 1914, 33; 1918, 12 ff., fig. 2). The handles ((a nastro)) common in the iron age seem to have originated among the neolithic people (Bull. Pal., xxxiii, 1907, 122; cf. N. S., 1902, 171 ff., 176-8). Certain elements of decoration and technique survived from the neolithic age. Decoration with bands of relief common in pottery of both inhumation and cremation burials of Rome is a feature of stone age pottery from the Vibrata valley and other sites (Bull.

I General similarity of finds places the inhuming people in close relationship with the Italic cremating stock, and at the same time certain marked differences of burial furnish- ings argue against their being of the same origin as the Picenes and other descendants of the nieolithic race. The fact that Picene influence appears occasionally in the inhum- ation burials of central Italy is of little significance, since elements of the terramare civ- ilization frequently occur in Picene burials, and survivals and borrowings of neolithic ma- terial appear in all the burials of the iron age. 2 The differences between the Picenes and the inhuming people of central and western Italy are much more marked than the similarities. 3 Picene burials of the iron age are distinguished by their consistent preser- vation of neolithic objects. Even in graves of an advanced period stone implements, ornaments of shell, and other objects common in neolithic times continue to appear,4 while the inhumation burials of central Italy very rarely yield neolithic material. 5 The character of the pottery is different, in forms of handles and shapes of vases, and even more in type of decoration. 6 In types and technique of pottery the inhuming people of Latium are clearly to be associated with the cremating Italic race and not with the in- huming people east of the Apennines. Were they of the same origin as the Picenes and Ligurians, descendants of the neolithic stock, it would be difficult to account for the marked differences which distinguish their burial remains from those of the Picenes, as well as for their close relationship in many respects with the cremating people. ' See L. A. HOLLAND, Faliscans, 49, n. 16, 50. The wheel hairpins characteristic of the terremare (Mon. Ant., iv, 373, pl. XII, 15) occur in fossa graves of the Faliscan territory, and in one fossa grave in Rome (Mon. Ant., xv, 208, pl. XVI, 33). Braziers of somewhat the same type as are invariably associated with cremation burial in Latium (Cat. of Vases in Brit. Mus., 1, part 2, Introd. XXVI, 216 f.) and the vases with lunate handles inherited from the bronze age occur chiefly in fossa graves in the Faliscan territory. 2 Picene influence is especially marked in Samnium and at other sites geographically close to Picene territory (see VON DUHN, op. cit., 1, 557 ff.; N. S., 1902,242, 521 ff.). Inhumation burials of Capena and Terni show some in- fluence of Picene civilization, and the vases with crested handles common at various sites in the Faliscan territory have close parallels in finds from east of the Appennines (see L. A. HOLLAND, op. cit., 54). These resemblances to Picene burials are, however, due probably to borrowing and not to any common racial origin, since they appear chiefly in graves of the later period, while the earliest coming of the inhuming people into this same region seemed rather to strengthen the relationship with the cremation civilization. 3 The form of burial common in the Picene country, the crouched position inherited from neolithic times, is perhaps in itself a significant distinction; but cf. PEET, op. cit., 186 f., 192-3; VON DUHN, op. cit., I, 36. 4 Bull. Pal., xiv, 1888, 44-6, pls. IV, V; VON DUHN, op. cit., 34; Bull.

IX, 60; xv, 189-192, fig. 80, i). 6 The flattened handles, the acanaletti)) and tongue handles, and the beaked and crested forms which asso- ciate the Picene and Vibrata pottery with that of the stone age (see Bull. Pal., xxxiii, 1907, plates; PEET, op. cit., 387 ff.) do not appeal in burials of central Italy. The decoration of the primitive pottery of botlh races of central Italy consists usually of bands of incised decoration around the rim of the vase, incised zig-zags, a succession of hatched triangles, or a simple band of relief. The pottery from the Vibrata valley is decorated much more solidly, in series of bands, in vertical patterns, vertical or horizontal lines of marks covering almost the whole surface of the vase, or bands of lozenges covering the whole surface (Bull. Pal., xxxiii, 1907, plates).</page><page sequence="34">40 INEZ G. SCOTT Further, if the inhuming people were an indigenous race which had occupied the territory since the stone age, it would be difficult to account for the fact that at all sites of western Italy where the cremating and inhuming people both settled the latter seem always to be the later arrivals. The earliest burials of the Faliscan territory, of Veii, of Vetulonia, as well as of Rome and other sites of Latium, are in every case cremation graves. In some instances the iuihunation rite is contemporaneous with a very early period of cremation, but in no case are there fossa graves which can be dated earlier than the first appearance of the cremating people. 1 It is known from a few scattered finds that this territory was inhabited by a neolithic people, 2 and if these earliest inhabi- tants were the ancestors of the inhuming people of the iron age it seems inevitable that in some instances, at least, they would appear as the first occupants of a site instead of always the later invaders. The invariable precedence of cremation all through Etruria and Latium demands a theory of two successive invasions, and we mlust believe that the inhuming people who settled in western Italy came down from the inland hill country at some time after the arrival of the cremating folk. The theory which best accounts for the character of the earliest inhumation civilization, for its differences from the Picene finds and its many elements in common with the cre- mation civilization of Latium and Etruria, is that the inhuming people were a branch of the Italic race, who appeared in Italy at a slightly later date than the cremating branch of the same race, and at many sites partially or totally displaced the cremating stock. When and how they came to adopt inhumation burial is as yet an unsolved problem. Only long contact with an inhuming race could conceivably account for a complete change of burial rite, and then probably the change could only occur by considerable intermingling of the inhuming stock. As to whether such contact occurred before the second branch of the Italic race entered Italy, or whether a separate branch of the race, which occupied the hill country of central Italy, absorbed large elements of the old neolithic stock and became finally an inhuming people, we have at present no evidence on which to base an hypothesis. There is no evidence in burial finds of the spread of an inhuming civ- ilization from northern Italy, though in the case of the cremating people the advance of the invasion is clearly marked. Inhumation burials of the iron age appear at no point north of the Tiber basin, and for all evidence to the contrary the custom of inhumation burial may have been developed within central Italy.3~ Wherever and whenever the change of burial rite took place, the resulting race remained largely Italic in thle char- ' See VON DUHN, op. cit.; N. S., 1919, 5; RANDALL- MACIVER, op. cit., 155-7; L. A. HOLLAND, Faliscans, 60-61. 2 VON DUHN, op. cit., 24-35; L. A. HOLLAND, op. cit., 13. ' There are, on the other hand, some indications of the existence of inhumation burial among the earliest lake-dwellers of Switzerland, and it may be that the diver- gence in burial rite had developed before the Italic races reached Italy. In any case, the rite of inhumation would be strengthened by contact witlh the inhumino neolithic peoples. See PEET, op. cit., 504-5.</page><page sequence="35">EARLY ROMAN TRADITIONS 41 acter of its civilization, and whatever elements of the indigenous stock were intermin- gled were largely absorbed and assimilated by the predominating Italic cultuire. Besides their close relationship in material culture to the cremating race, there is evi- dence that the inhuming people of central Italy spoke an Italic language related to that of the cremating ancestors of the Latins. Our chief evidence concerning the language spoken by these people is of course of later date. For the crenmating people of the iron age appear in historic times as the Latin peoples of Latium and southern Etruria, the inhuming race as the Umbro-Sabellian peoples who continued to occupy the country settled by their inhuming ancestors, the hill country of central Italy, Samnium, and Campania. The Latin and Umbro-Sabellian dialects spoken in Italy in historical times were parallel branches developed from a common Italic language. If, then, the inhuming ancestors of the Umbro-Sabellian peoples were neolithic in origin instead of Italic, it would be neces- sary to suppose that they adopted their language from their Latin neighbors. But it is a priori unlikely that one race should impose its language upon another by mere proximity, or even by intermingling unless the dorminant race were heavily in the majority. Further, it is impossible that the Umbro-Sabellian branch of the Italic language is an offshoot from the Latin, - even from the pre-Latin spoken by the earliest Latin peoples in Italy,- instead of a parallel development from a common parent tongue. A number of peculiar developments which distinguish the Latin from the Umbro-Sabellian branch of the language arose after the Latins had entered Italy, and would therefore have been too late to affect a language borrowed from the Latin at a very early stage. But a few differences known to have arisen before the Italic invasion of Italy are sufficient to prove that the Latin and Umbro-Sabellian branches of the race had separated while they were still in central Europe. The Latin and Umbro-Sabellian treatment of Indo-European labio-velar sounds shows a difference in development whhich must have arisen before the Italic language was brought into Italy. For the difference is parallel to that between the different branches of the Celtic language. The Latin qu or c for Indo-European ku and v or gu for gu corresponds to the old Irish c for ku, while the Umbro-Sabellian p for ku and b for gu corresponds to the Celtic p for k. ' The Greek treatnment of these sounds agrees with the Umbro-Sabellian and Celtic. This divergence between Latin and Umbro-Sabellian, since it is shared witlh other branches of the same race and is not a peculiarity of Italic languages, must have originated before the Italic race had come down into Italy. To take another instance, the i ending of the nominative plural of the second declension in Latin is a divergence from the proper s ending, taken over into the declension of nouns by analogy with the nominative plural ending of the v)ronoun; the Umbro-Sabellian branch, on the other hand, keeps the older Indo-European 1 BRUGMANN, Vergleichende Grammatik, Vol. 1, ? ? 417, 419, 435 ff. 6</page><page sequence="36">42 INEZ G. SCOTT form with the s ending. Since Latin shares this peculiarity with Celtic, Greek, and Balto-Slavonic, the change must have occurred while the ancestors of the Latins were still in central Europe, and the Umbro-Sabellian branch even then must have been sepa- rated from the Latin. So early a separation into two branches precludes the possibility that the Umbro-Sabellian dialects were offshoots from a language brought into Italy by the cremating Italic race and adopted from them by an inhuming non-Indo-European people. Whether the ancestors of the Umbro-Sabellian race practiced inhumation burial before they entered Italy or adopted it later by contact and intermingling with the indigenous people of the country where they settled, they came into Italy as a separate branch of a great Italic invasion, bringing with them a language related to but already distinct from that spoken by the cremating Italians from whom the Latins eventually sprung. To this inhuming branch of the Italic people belonged the Sabines, and to the Sabines, according to tradition, is to be attributed the inhuming element in the early population of Rome. The difficulty of proving that the inhuming stock in Rome was Sabine and not some other branch of the same race lies in the fact that there have been almost no burial finds from Sabine territory. The probability a priori is that of the different branches of the inhum- ing race it would be the Sabines who came into Rome, because of their position in the Sabine Hills overlooking the Roman Campagna, - a point of vantage whence the plain of Latium would be as attractive as it was to the people of the Alban Hills. The few finds from Sabine territory, none of which are as early as the early inhumation period in Latium, are generally similar to inhumation finds from Rome. In all instances there was observed an unusual frequency of bronze and iron weapons, and, in some cases, of simple bronze ornaments. The pottery from Sabine burials shows certain significant similarities to that of the Faliscan territory, where an inhuming people who were perhaps Sabines complettly submerged the earlier cremating stock. The crested handle appearing on vases from the oak-coffin burials, and from other graves in Faliscan territory, seems to have come from the Sabines; 2 a type of inipasto plate common in Faliscan burials occurs also in Sabine finds; and impasto vases decorated with a sort of hollow relief (((con figure incavate )), found in Faliscan territory but very rarely elsewhere, occur in three out of five graves at Poggio Sommavilla in the Sabine country. Paribeni considers this peculiar type of decoration a native development, a more elaborate form of incised decoration which might easily have originated among the Italic people independently of any foreign influence.3 While no direct proof establishes the inhuming people of Rome as Sabines, there are certain significant relationships between Roman burials and inhumation remains from other places where there are various evidences of Sabine influence. Curiously enough, it is 1 PERSICHETTI, Viaggio sulla Via Salaria, 202 ff.; VON DUHN, op. cit., I, 457. 2 See L. A. HOLLAND, Faliscans, 54-5; N. S., 1896, 476-89; 1902, 326 if.; cf. N.

This group consists of the six burials in which hollowed oak-trunks are employed as sarcophagi. The oak- trunk sarcophagi, which never appear in the more primitive burials, evidently represent a later development of custom among the inhuming people.' The use of sarcophagi of wood seems to have become a wide-spread custom among the inhuming Italic people, as it occurs in later burials in Campania and Samnium, in Volscian and Sabine territory, and in Umbria. The prevalence of the custom in various parts of the territory where inhum- ation burials have been found is one of the many indications of the racial homogeneity of the inhuming people who occupied all of central Italy, Campania, and Samnium. 2 The peculiar Roman form of the custom, the burial in a hollowed oak-trunk, appears only in a limited area near Sabine territory, in places where other evidence strengthens the topographical probability that the burials are Sabine. The oak-trunk sarcophagi are known only in Rome, at Gabii, Veii, and at a few sites in Faliscan territory, I all within a fairly small radius, at some distance inland, in the lowlands overlooked by the Sabine Hills. In Rome itself the oak-coffin burial occurs in six graves of the Forum and in two on the Quirinal which contained sarcophagi of terra-cotta in the form of hollowed tree-trunk. The two latter burials belong by their contents to the same series and approximately to the same period as those in the Forum. The careful imitation of the oak-trunk with its knots and stumps of branches is an indication that the peculiar sar- cophagi represent a special burial custom and not merely an early makeshift for a manufac- tured sarcophagus of wood. The oak-coffin burials are the latest and richest graves in the Forum. ' They have only the advanced forms of fibulae, ((a navicella)) and ((a sangui- suga,)) often with elongated foot; they all yield amber and glass paste, sometimes in great abundance. They have only pottery of an advanced stage, fine bucchero imitations of Greek forms, amphorae with incised spiral decoration of the sort found at Veii in the Etruscan period and in the 7th century Bocchoris grave at Corneto. s Two of the burials, G and AA, contained proto-Corinthian pottery, the presence of which dates the graves in the 1 The oak-coffin burials were made evidently by the same people as the ordinary inhumation burials; they are similar in content to other burials of the period, only richer and somewhat more advanced than any others of the Forum. 2 See VON DUHN, op. cit., 491, 592, 597, 601, 609, 624; N.

The oak-trunk burials outside Rome are of the same advanced period and show a close relationship with the Roman examples. 2 There were the same tall two-handled pitchers which occurred in Grave D of the Forum; ' kantharoi of the type found in Grave AA; 4amphorae with incised double spirals, known as ((Nicosthenes)) vases, of the same sort- which occur in graves AA, K, and 1. 5 While the oak-coffin burials are none of them actually in Sabine territory, there are indications of Sabine influence in the places where they occur. Gabii, though geograph- ically in Latium, is very close to the Sabine country and would be likely to show Sabine influence. The Faliscan territory very early fell under the Etruscan power, but there remains some evidence of the earlier presence of Sabines in this region. The ancient fairs in the Lucus Feroiiae 6 were shared by Faliscans, Sabines, and Latins, probably by Etruscans as well. Livy (i, 30, 5) speaks of a quarrel between Latins and Sabines in their trading at the Lucus Feroniae, and Dionysius (iii, 32, 1) mentions the fairs in Fal- iscan territory participated in by Latins, Sabines, and neighboring peoples. The god- dess herself was believed to be Sabine (Varro, L. L., v, 74), and may well have been so.7 In any case her shrine was a gathering-place for the Sabines and Latins. Further, the name Hirpi (an Umbro-Sabellic word for lupi), given to the devotees of Apollo Soranus on Mt. Soracte, perhaps supplies evidence of the presence of some Sabine element in this region. 8 In this whole region, as at Rome, there seems to have been an original Latinic stock of cremating people who gave the basis of the language and civilization, then an ad- mixture of Sabine, and later a foreign culture super-imposed upon the native civilization by the influx of a foreign people, the Etruscans. Practically the same successive stages appear at Veii, although here the invading Etruscans took more complete possession. The earliest burials at Veii belong to the incincration civilization that occupied much of southern Etruria, closely related, as we have seen, to the cremation civilization of Latium. At some time during the incineration period fossa graves begin to appear, showing material contemporaneous, as was the case at Rome, with that of the more advanced cremation burials. Cremation graves largely disappear during the period of strongest foreign influence, as at Rome, but again become prevalent in the 6th and 5th centuries. 10 At the time of the Etruscans' greatest power camera tombs are the usual form at Veii, and the prevalence of the Etruscan custom exerts an influence on the two types of burial ' See J. H. S., xxxii, 1912, 342-3. 2 See L. A. HOLLAND, Faliscans, 64 ff. 3 N. S., 1903, 163; cf. the burial at Gabii, Bull. Comm., xxxi, 1903, 352 ff., pl. XI, 1, 5. Another example comes from Esquiline Grave CX, and two from the Alban Hills, Bull. Comm., xxviii, 1900, pl. XIII, 28, pp. 208-9. 4 N. S., 1911, 157 ff.; cf. Bull. Comm., xxxi, 1903, 352 if., pl.

By the 6th century even the incineration burials are ((loculi) or niches in camera tombs, while the fossa graves, at first ordinary trenches, become much larger and contain wood sarcophagi and loculi. These large fossa graves are probably Italic graves showing Etruscan influence, not burials of the Etruscans themselves; for the earlier simple fosse prove the presence of the inhumring Italic people before the arrival of the Etruscans, and there is the same gradual advance in the richness of the burial equipment as was observed in the inhumation burials of Rome. The character of the fossa graves themselves makes it likely that they are native burials. The funeral equip- ment often shows remarkable similarities to that from Faliscan territory and Narce. The Veii finds 1 are in general sirmilar to those of Caere, Tarquinii, and Vulci, but show more local ware, a scarcity of imported material, and a lack of the more advanced and richer objects. In this lack of richer material they resemble the finds of Capena and Faliscan territory, where the native element was always strong; they are like them also in the use of sarcophagi of wood and in the occurrence of ((loculi) tombs. This all seems to point to the conclusion, suggested by Colini (N. S., 1919, 5 ff.), that Veii did not become a wholly Etruscan city as did some others, btut received Etruscan rule and Etruscan culture while still remainling largely Italic in population. The use of oak-trunk sarcophagi in Rome and at other sites may be assumed to indicate Sabine influence, in spite of the absence of actual Sabine finds which would offer certain proof. Though they happen to occur at places where there was also Etruscan influence, at Veii, Falerii, and at Rome, they were almost certainly a Sabellian not an Etruscan developmient. This fact is established with reasonable certainty by the dis- appearance of the burial custom in Etruria, in the Faliscan territory, and in Rome, wlile it continues in somewhat varied form for centuries among Umbro-Sabellian peoples. The probable inference established by the burial remains, that the inhuming race of Rome were Sabines, is strengthened by other evidence. The position of the Sabines all through historical times as neighbors and then as citizens of Rome is not without its significance. The Sabines were subjugated by M'. Curius Dentattis in 290 B. C., when they were given the (( civitas sine suffragio. )) In 268 B. C. they received the full citi- zenship, and finally in 240 B. C. they were established as the Tribus Quirina. 2 The Romans seem to have felt themselves especially connected with the Sabines, probably partly because of the tradition of the union of Latin and Sabine in the early population of Rome. But we have scattered bits of evidence that they were aware of Sabine elements in their ancestry and in their civilization. Some of the ancient Roman families had traditions of Sabine origin. We know this to be true of the Claudii, whose progenitor, ' N. S., 1919, 3-12. No distinction is made between different types of burial; Etruscan tombs and the fossa graves are both included. 2 FLORUS, i, 10, Bellum Sabinum; cf. FRANK, Klio, xi, 1911, 368-73.</page><page sequence="40">46 INEZ G. SCOTT Attus Clausus, was alleged to have come to Rome during the Sabine wars in the time of the kings; ' and we know from Suetonius 2 that the Claudii were buried ((sub Capitolio. &gt;) This story is possibly a myth to explain their use of what was known to be a Sabine rite, but the fact remains that the consistent practice of inhumation burial in certain old Roman families is most easily explained as the survival in a family of a rite originally practiced.' Along with the tradition that the second Roman king was a Sabine from the Sabine town of Cures, there is an account that Numa wished his body to be buried in a sarcophagus of stone instead of burned according to the usual custom. 4 Though this story might possibly have arisen merely from the Romans' knowledge of the Sabine custom, so consistent a tradition has corroborative value of some significance. 5 The presence in Rome of Sabine families, Sabine names, 6 and Sabine rites may be due to some extent to borrowing from a neighboring people at a time much later than the earliest period. In a few cases, however, elements of the Sabine dialect have been taken into the Latin, and these, in order to have found their place as a real part of the Latin language, must have come in at a time before the language was firmly formed. Some Sabine words, - and their presence is attested by numerous glosses and ancient references to Sabine words in use in Latin, -might have been borrowed at almost any period. But a Sabine sound change which in a whole group of words has displaced the natural Latin one indicates rather an early admixture of a Sabine element in the Latin language. Unfortunately there is little actual evidence concerning the language of the Sabines, perhaps for the reason that while the Oscan and Umbrian dialects continued in use until later times, the Sabine was absorbed into Latin at an early date. For Varro and Festus, who speak of the ((lingua Osca,)) never speak of the (lingua Sabina)) but only of the (( Sabini. )) 7 Some dialectic peculiarities must have remained, as is shown by a remark of Quintilian (I, 5, 56) "taceo de Tuscis et Sabinis et Praenestinis quoque, nam ut eorum sermone utentem Vectium Lucilius insectatur, quemadmodum Pollio deprehendit in Livio Pa- tavinitatem. )) Such a reference implies, however, no more than a slight dialectical quality, if the Sabine dialect was comparable to Livy's ((Patavinitas. ) It is known that the Sabines and the Volscians are to be placed linguistically between the Latin and Umbro- Sabellian peoples, showing some characteristics of both languages. 8 The Faliscan, Aequian, Marsian, Hernican, and the language of the Sabines of the Tiber and Digentia 1 Livy, ii, 16, 4. 2 Tiberius, i. 3 The Cornelii too always kept the rite of inhumation burial until the time of Sulla, according to PLINY, N.

Juppiter Lucetius, and, in the neighborhood of Rome, Juno Curitis and Feronia. In most cases, however, the reality of the Sabine connection is a matter of question. See WISSOWA, Rel. u.

The Volscian shows the distinctive mark of the Umbro-Sabellian language in its treatment of labio-velar sounds, since it has p corresponding to Latin qu or c, and b corresponding to Latin v. It is not certain whether in this characteristic the Sabine belongs with the Latin or with the Umbro-Sabellian group.2 A large group of Latin words shows the dialectic instead of the true Latin treatment of labio-velars, and must be due, if not to Sabine influence, then to borrowing from other dialects. These words may have come from the Sabines, but our knowledge of the dialect is not sufficient to allow us to class them with any certainty among evidences of the Sabine element in Latin. Instances of the action of linguistic laws of the Umbro-Sabellian language occur frequently in Latin. Of these dialectic characteristics a few are known, from the scant knowledge we have, to be of Sabine origin; and since the Sabine is much more closely related to the Umbro-Sabellian group than are the Latin dialects, it is reasonable to assume that even some of the dialectical characteristics not specifically attested as Sabine may have come from the same source. 3 The Sabine elements in Latin may be due to either of two causes or to a combi- nation of both, - either to an early mingling of Sabine stock with the Latin and conse- quently a very early introduction of Sabine words and of Sabine treatment of certain sounds, or to later borrowing resulting from contact and conquest. In some cases non-Latin words which the ancients themselves knew to have been borrowed from their neighbors came into use temporarily or permanently. 4 In a few instances whole groups of words, containing sounds which received different treatment in the different dialects, appear in Latin with the Sabine treatment. Any of these might of course be due to individual cases of borrowing at a later date. Yet when the same non-Latin treatment of the same sound occurs again and again and holds a place in the language parallel with the true Latin development, it is tempting to believe that in the forming of the Latin there was active some force representative of Sabine sound laws, working parallel with the Latin laws of language. Words showing a Sabine sound change are sometimes doublets of others which have the proper Latin sounds, sometimes they have entirely displaced the true Latin forms. The most commonly cited instance of a Sabine sound development which has displaced a Latin one is the Sabine weakening of original inter-vocalic d to I, which occurs frequently in Latin. 5 1 See CONWAY, OP. cit., 1, p. 287. 2 CONWAY, op. cit., 1, p. 287; cf.

A number of Latin words show a Sabine development of initial f from Indo- European ^h or gh, instead of the h required by Latin sound laws. The Sabine f from gh or gh is shown in a number of Sabine equivalents for familiar Latin words beginning with h. VARRO, L.

Other dialectic peculiarities appearing in large groups of Latin words, which are known to be characteristic of the Umbro-Sabellian branch of the Italic language, 2 may also have been Sabine and may have come into Latin with the early admixture of Sabine stock. But only in the instances cited are the non-Latin characteristics known with certainty to have been of Sabine origin. Because of our slight knowledge of the early Sabines, of their burials, their religion, and their language, we have in any one field little basis for determining the extent of Sabine influence on Roman civilization. But while the evidence from no source is by itself conclusive, the cumulative proof from various fields which admit of investigation argues for the correctness of the tradition that represents the Roman race as a combi- nation of Latin and Sabine peoples. The burial remains of the Sepulcretum prove that an early community was established at the site of Rome, perhaps first on the Palatine, by a people who had previously settled the Alban Hills; and that this occupation of the site began considerably earlier than the traditional date of the founding of the city. As the next step, according to tradition and to evidence from burial remains as well, a Sabine people came in and settled on one of the other hills, mingling with the earlier people, as it seems amicably, and for a time sharing the same cemetery with them. Later the proportion of the new element in the population greatly increased, and the Sabines apparently gained the ascendancy for a time. Possibly the Roman tradition of the election of Numa, a Sabine king, represents a time when the Sabines were the more important element. The disappearance of cremation burials from the Sepulcretum cannot, however, signify the total disappearance of the cremating people. Cremation burial gave way entirely to the rite of inhumation in the Sepulcretum, and was apparently always rare among the early people of the Esquiline. But it is impossible that the cremating people disappeared from Rome during the time of the greatest prevalence of inhumation burial, for cremation later regained its popularity and in historical times became the rite almost exclusively practiced. Possibly when the overlordship of the Etruscans in the sixth century checked the influx of the Sabines, the cremating Latin element in the population of Rome began to regain its old ascendancy. The final return of the cremation rite of burial proves that the Sabines must always have only shared Rome with the Latins, never displaced them, and that the Roman people was, as tradition claims, a real mingling of Latin and Sabine. I ERNOUT, op. cit., cites also furfur, futilis, florus, exfuti, as examples of the same peculiarity. 2 Other dialectic peculiarities, known to be Umbro- Sabellic, which may or may not have been Sabine also, are the dialectic f instead of Latin b or d for the Indo- European bh and dh (as in bufo, forfex, mufrius, rufus, tufer, vafer, etc.); intervocalic s instead of Latin r (as in adasia, amasius, asinus, caesaries, fusus, etc.); i instead of Latin e (as in vitulus, milium, tilia, etc.). See JURET, op. cit., 359-60.</page><page sequence="45">CHAPTER III. THE EARLY DEVELOPMENT OF THE CITY. IN the essential facts the remains of the earliest habitation on the site of Rome support the traditional account of the origins of the city. The literary sources all agree as to the chief facts, - the founding of Rome by settlers from Alba Longa, the early admixture of Sabine stock, - and the evidence from early burials is in accord with the traditions stripped of their literary dress. The more detailed problem of following out the gradual development of the city involves more serious difficulties and yields to less satisfactory solution. The difficulties are two-fold, arising partly from the fact that such remains as burials yield clearer evidence concerning general racial relationships than concerning the more detailed connections between different districts in one locality, and partly from the fact that the traditions themselves are more confused and contradictory as they are more detailed. The legends of the founding of the city all place the original settlement on the Palat- ine, a site which would doubtless have been one of the most attractive to an incoming people, protected as it was on three sides by rather precipitous slopes and by a swampy valley, with only an isthmus of high ground connecting it with the Esquiline. The Lupercal and the Ficus Ruminalis, which give the setting of the legend of Romulus and the founding of the city, were on the slopes of the Palatine. Servius ' locates the Ficus Ruminalis by mentioning the Lupercal, and Dionysius places the cave of the Lupercal near the build- ings of the Palatine on the way leading to the circus, 2 close by the sacellum where stands the statue of the wolf and the twins. In another comment Servius connects the Lupercal with the legend of the twins : ((gelida monstrat sub rupe lupercal)) he explains as follows - (sub monte Palatino est quaedam spelunca.... alii quod illic lupa Remum et Romulum nutrierit. )) 3 There was also a tradition connecting the procession of the luperci 1 SERVIus, Aeneid, viii, 90: ((ficus Ruminalis, ad quam eiecti sunt Remus et Romulus, quae fuit ubi nunc est Lupercal in circo. ) 2 DIONYSIUS, i, 79,8; cf. VELLEIUS, i, 15, 3: ((Cassius cen- sor a Lupercali in Palatium versus theatrum facere instituit. )) 3 SERVIUS, Aen., viii, 343.</page><page sequence="46">52 INEZ C. SCOTT with Romulus and Remus. According to Ovid (Fasti, ii, 375ff.) the two companies of the luperci, the Fabii and Quinctii, were originally the bands led by the twin brothers; and Dionysius (i, 80) represents Remus as captured by Numitor's men while he was leading a procession. There is a scene represented on a mirror from Bolsena, a work of the 3rd century, 1 which supports this association: the wolf and twins appear beside a tree, and standing beside the wolf are a man (Faustulus) and a woman and a youth clad in a goatskin, the usual dress of the luperci. If Graffunder's 2 interpretation is correct, this connects the Romulus legend with the Palatine at a date much earlier than the age when the homes of important citizens on that hill gave a motive for representing it as the seat of the beginnings of Roman power. Literary references to the Ficus Ruminalis are somewhat contradictory. Varro (L. L., v, 54) places it on the Palatine: ((Germalum a germanis Romulo et Remo, quod ad Ficum Ruminalem, et ii ibi inventi, quo aqua hiberna Tiberis eos detulerat in alveolo expo- sitos. &gt;) Livy (i, 4, 5) speaks of it as still existing on the slopes of the Palatine: (( ubi nunc Ficus Ruminalis est.)) Again (x, 23, 12) he mentions the statue of the wolf and the twins set up by the Ogulnii in 296 B. C. near the Ficus Ruminalis, the same statue which Dionysius (i, 79, 8) describes as Xc&amp;i6 rcxcztipca =aitrc 'a praCt o., located on the Palatine on the way leading to the circus. 3 Ovid (Fasti, ii, 412ff.) also places this near the Lupercal. There was, however, another sacred fig-tree in the Comitium, which Pliny (N. H., xv, 77) calls the Ficus Ruminalis, though Dionysius (iii, 71, 5) and Festus (1 69M., 168L.) refer to the same tree without connecting it at all with the Ficus Ruminalis and the legend of the twins. There was a statue near the Comitium erected by Tar- quinius Priscus in honor of the augur Attus Naevius, and the sacred fig-tree beside the statue 4 was cherished as a symbol of divine favor toward the city, its decay being con- sidered an indication of divine wrath. It is evidently this tree, originally connected with a haruspex, which Pliny (N. H., xv, 77) and Tacitus (Ann., xiii, 58) call the Ficus Ruminalis and associate with the Romulus legend. Pliny, however, recognizes the fact that the original fig-tree was near the Lupercal, and makes this only a memorial of the true ficus: colitur ficus arbor in foro ipso ac comitio Romae nata, sacra fulguribus ibi conditis magisque ob memoriam eius, quae.... ruminalis appellata, quoniam sub ea inventa est lupa infantibus praebens rumim.... tan quam in comitium sponte transisset Atto Navio augurante. Both Tacitus and Pliny refer to the belief in the importance of the tree as a sign of the gods' favor. 1 ROSCHER, Lex., I, p. 1465. 2 PAULY-WISSOWA, 2te Reihe, I, Rom, pp. 1082-3. 3 This was not the statue which Cicero mentions as on the Capitoline, which was struck by lightning in 65 B. C. (CICERO, Cat., Ill, 19; de Divin., I, 19 f.; II, 45-7. CASS. Dio, xxxvii, 9, 1). See PETERSEN, in Klio, viii, 1908, 440 f., and ix, 1909, 29 ff. The statue on the Palatine was probably later than the Capitoline wolf, which is a semiarchaic Etruscan work, as early perhaps as the 5th century B. C. The placing of a statue on the Capitoline is no argument against the legend's being originally connected with the Palatine, because the Capitoline, the center of the later city, was the appropriate place for a memorial of the legendary founder of Rome. 4 Festus calls the tree the ((ficus Navia,)) while Dio- nysius calls it merely t i )i'Xq. ))</page><page sequence="47">EARLY ROMAN TRADITIONS 53 They have obviously merely confused the cherished fig-tree of the Forum with that of the familiar legend. The hut of Romulus too was in all probability on the Palatine, though here again the ancient references are contradictory. Seneca and Vitruvius mention a hut preserved on the Capitoline I as a reminder of the fashions of olden times. 2 On the other hand, Dionysius (i, 79) specifically states that one of the huts of wood and reed still existed in his day on the side of the Palatine overlooking the circus. Dio (xlviii, 43, 4) locates the hut near the temple of Magna Mater at this corner of the hill, and Solinus (i, 17-18) quoting Varro, names the ( tugurium Faustuhi)) near the steps of Cacus as one boundary of ((Roma quadrata.)) It is possible that there were two huts preserved, 3 as there were two statues of the wolf and the twins, one on the Palatine on the actual site and one as a memorial on the Capitoline, the center and citadel of the later city. It is significant for the relatively early dating of the Palatine community that the Curiae Veteres had their meeting place on this hill, 4 while the later Curia was in the Forum. Here again, as in the case of the ficus, the statue of the wolf and twins, and the hut of Romulus, the original monument is associated with the Palatine, and later also with the Capitoline or Forum. This parallelism is quite explicable on the assumption that the ancient monuments were cherished first on their original sites in the earliest center of habitation, and later as memorials at the central point of the fully developed city. The legend of Cacus, localized on the same part of the hill as the Lupercal and the Ficus Ruminalis, is another evidence of the relative antiquity of the habitation of the Palatine. While almost nothing is known of either the rites connected with Cacus or their origin, it is certain that the legend is among the earliest. 5 We have in the legends and monuments associated with the Palatine, - the legend of Romulus, the Ficus Rumi- nalis, the Lupercal, the legend of Cacus, the Curiae Veteres, 6 all connected with the very earliest period of Rome's existence and some so early that they were little understood by the Romans themselves, - a significant argument that this hill was the site of the earliest of the several settlements. 1 As in the case of the statue of the wolf and twins, the Capitoline was an appropriate place for a memorial, quite apart from the question of the original location of the house of Romulus. 2 SENECA, Controv., ii, 1, 5: (colit etiamnunc in Capi- tolio casam victor omnium gentium populus.)) Cf. VITRU- vius, ii, 1, 5. 3 PLUTARCH, Romulus, xx, 4, perhaps implies that there were two huts. He states that Tatius and Romulus ruled separately for awhile; Tatius dwelt where the temple of Moneta stood in later times, and Romulus near the descent from the Palatine to the circus (according to the usual interpretation of the corrupt passage). 4 See JORDAN-HJLSEN, Top., i, 3, p. 44, n. 28.

WARDE- FOWLER, Roman Festivals, 197, suggests that the legend may have come from Sicily in the 8th century or earlier. 6 It is worth noting that also the mundus, the supposed center of the city, existed both on the Palatine and in the Comitium. FESTUS (258 M., 310, 312L.), places it (Quadrata Roma) on the Palatine ante templum Apollinis. PLUTARCH, Rom., I 1.</page><page sequence="48">54 INEZ G. SCOTT The original city founded by Romulus was sometimes called ((Roma Quadrata, )) a term appropriate enough for describing a settlement occupying the approximately rectan- gular Palatine Hill. The term was confused in ancient times, and references to Roma Quadrata seem to refer sometimes to the early city of the Palatine, 1 sometimes to the mundus, which was located by different authorities on the Palatine and in the Comitium. 2 Though there was unquestionably a legend extant in late republican and imperial times which called the city of Romulus Roma Quadrata, singular omissions of the name in a number of cases suggest that it was not the familiar designation of the early city. Dionysius (i, 88, 2; ii, 65, 3) calls the settlement of Romulus rs:p oWV0, and describes it as a fortified city; Plutarch (Romulus, 9, 4) refers to cv x.vvrv 'Pv Kouyxpr` YV built and fortified by Romulus. Tacitus (Ann., xii, 24) outlines the boundaries of the city of the Palatine in describing the earliest pomerium, but gives it no specific name. Ovid too (Trist., iii, 1, 31) gives the Palatine as the original site of the city without calling it Roma Quadrata. The chief authority before imperial times is Varro (quoted by SOLINUS, i, 17), who uses the name Roma Quadrata, but at the same time describes its boundaries in such a way that he must have been either confusing it with the mundus near the area of Apollo or was mistaken about the extent of the settlement, limiting it to only a part of the hill. 3 A line in Ennius, 4 " quis est erat (qui se sperat) Romae regnare quadratae, )) contains the earliest mention of the name. This passage is explained by Festus as referring to the mundus, a pit near the area of Apollo, but there is no certainty that Ennius himself was referring to the mundus, whatever the term ((Roma quadrata)) meant to Festus. In fact, the most natural interpretation of the line is to assume Roma Quadrata to be the city, whether the name is to be taken as a formal designation or merely a description of a city built on a hill that was roughly rectangular. It has been pointed out that the name Roma Quadrata was applicable to the mundus at a time when the circular stone facing of the pit had been concealed by a square parapet which later marked the opening.5 This would not have been true, however, in Ennius' time, though it may account for Festus' interpretation of Ennius' use of the term. Whether Roma Quadrata was a familiar designation of the Palatine city or only a description of its form, there is a consistent tradition that Romulus founded and fortified a city on the Palatine, which was the nucleus of the later city of the seven hills. As authority for the tradition we have, besides writers of imperial times (Dionysius, Tacitus, Plutarch), the quotation from Varro, and probably the line of Ennius misinterpreted by Festus. 1 For discussions of the interpretation of ((Roma Quadrata,)) cf.

Since the pomerium was probably an Etruscan institution, 2 it is in any case an anachronism to describe a pomerium of the Palatine city. The belief that the earliest pomerium ran round the foot of the Palatine, based partly perhaps on the procession of the Luperci, simply reflects the tradi- tion that the original city was on this hill. 3 The question of the existence of the Septimontium as a stage in the city's develop- ment has been so frequently dealt with that the available literary evidence is well known. A number of ancient references to Rome as a Septimontium evidently designate the seven Servian hills, 4 as is natural, since it was common to describe the Rome of classical times as a city of seven hills. A comment of Servius shows that a confusion existed even in an- cient times as to whether the Septimontium included the Servian hills or only the seven smaller hills. 5 The evidence for the earlier Septimontium is a quotation from Antis- tius Labeo, cited by Festus (348M., 476L.) which names the seven smaller hills; there is also a similar list given by Paulus (341M., 459L.), who may be dependent on Labeo. In both cases eight are named instead of seven: the Palatine, Velia, Fagutal, Subura, Cermalus, Oppius, Caelius, and Cispius. Wissowa accounts for this discrepancy by the theory that Caelius is added to locate the Subura, then on the Caelian instead of in the valley between the Oppius and Cispius. 6 Festus elsewhere (340 M., 458 L., a frag- mentary passage) names the same hills as included in the festival of the Septimontium. One of the principal arguments for the reality of this earlier Septimontium, besides the statement of the tradition by Labeo, is the existence of other references to the ((montani)) of the smaller hills, and specifically to the omontanih of the Oppius, of the Palatine and the Cermalus. 7 There is no satisfactory explanation of such references except to assume 1 As is suggested by Frank, A. J. A., xxii, 1918, 176. See the following chapter. 2Livy, i, 44, 3-5; VARRO, L. L., v, 143. 8 The tradition of the three gates of the city of Rom- ulus (VARRO, L. L., v, 164 f.) is an additional argument for the location of the original city on the Palatine. The fact that the names of the gates of the Palatine survived in Roman tradition is an indication that the settlement of the Palatine was a more important factor than the other communities at the time of the union into a city. 4 VARRO, L.L., v, 41-44; vi, 24; TIBULLUS, ii, v, 55; SERV., Aen., vi, 783; VERG., Georgics, ii, 535; GELLIUS, xiii, 14. 5 SERVIUS, Aen., vi, 783; grandis est inde dubitatio..., et alii dicunt breves septem colliculos a Romulo inclusos qu. tamen aliis nominibus appellabantur. LYDUS, De Mens., iv, 155, gives two lists, which show no real variation. While he does not know the names of the smaller hills, he recognizes that there was a parallel tradition of seven different hills, one representing an earlier stage in the development of the city. 6 WissowA, Gesammelte Abhandlungen, 1904, 241 ff. (summarized in Cl. Ph., i, 69 ff.). His hypothesis of the earlier location of the Subura rests on two arguments: that the location on the Caelian would account for the confusion between the ((Subura)) and ((Succusa,)) and that the Subura in the valley would be a very curious com- ponent of the group of (eseven hills.)) 7 MOMMSEN, Staatsr., 111, 114-5.

Graffunder, in his argument that Labeo probably invented the group of seven smaller hills because a Sep- timontium of the seven Servian hills seemed to him to imply too large a city for so early a period, offers no explanation of the various allusions to the smaller hills. 2 Wissowa makes it clear that the Septimontium described by Labeo has a definite place in the Roman traditions as an intermediate stage of the city's development. The third stage in the development of the city is usually called the City of the Four Regions, and is believed to be outlined by the chapels of the Argei. 3 The name, which refers to the four regions established by Servius Tullius, is somewhat inaccurate, for the third stage was not the Servian city but a pre-Etruscan city which included the Quirinal and Viminal and Capitoline in addition to the hills of the Septimontium. The evidence for a city of this extent before the period of the Etruscan kings rests chiefly upon the ((Calendar of Numa. )) 4 As is generally believed, the early calendar of festivals lists only Italic rites and festivals, conspicuously omitting all rites which are known to have been introduced from Etruria or Greece, or even from other Italic cities. Such a formal codification of religious rites demands the existence, at a time before the Etruscan period, of a city in some real sense of the word. The Calendar of Numa constitutes a strong argument against any view which ignores the development of a purely Latin civ- ilisation on the site of Rome for a considerable period before the introduction of foreign influence from Etruria. Not only does the existence of the calendar imply some degree of advancement in organization, but the details it furnishes enable us to outline the bound- aries of the city which made it. The list includes festivals of the Palatine, Velabrum, Forum, Circus valley, Capitoline, Caelian, and Quirinal. ' The city of the ((Four Re- gions)) is therefore a stage between the Septimontium and the city of Servius, including much more territory than the former but apparently somewhat less than the latter. 6 Since the four regions are connected with Servius and the early calendar with Numa, the more appropriate name for this intervening stage would be the ((City of Numa.) The tradition which makes the Palatine settlement the original nucleus of the city has been doubted 7 for the reason that a number of early rites would seem to place the Quirinal earliest of all instead of among the latest hills to be included in the city. From what we know of the manner in which Rome and other sites were settled, this difficulty becomes explicable. It is quite probable that, as the Palatine existed as a separate com- 1 See PAULY-WISSOWA, Rom. 2 The fact that the festival of the Septimontium does not occur in the early calendar offers no difficulty. It does not occur in any calendar for the reason that, as Varro states (L.

Both maintained their independence long enough for early rites and legends to gain a firm hold. The first connections established were quite naturally between the Palatine and the Esquiline, for while the swamp of the Forum valley proved a barrier isolating the Quirinal, there was a connecting link between the Palatine and the settle- ments on the Oppius and Cispius. When the Quirinal was finally united with this group, the Capitoline apparently became common ground and hence the site of the shrines common to the newly united peoples. But the old cults and legends connected with both hills survived from the time when the two were separate. This theory would account for the existence of a ((Capitolium vetus)) on the Quirinal, - an anachronism as such, since the name would have been transferred from the later ocapitolium, ))- which probably represents a cult of the time when the Quirinal was independent of the Septimontium. I It might also account for certain traces pointing to a dual origin of the city: the tradition that Romulus and the Latins held the Palatine and Caelian while the Sabines under Tatius held the Quirinal and Capitoline; 2 the existence of Salii for both the Palatine and the Quirinal; and the two colleges of luperci, the second of which may have been con- nected with the Quirinal. 3 I have outlined in some detail the traditional version of the development of the early city. While it is none too consistent, the best evidence points out four stages in the city's growth: the Palatine city founded by Romulus; the Septimontium, which included only the Palatine, Esquiline, and Caelian; the city of the Four Regions (or, more accu- rately, the city of Numa); and the city of Servius Tullius. To test this traditional account there is available a certain amount of archaeological evidence. The location and dating of the early burials throws some light on the advance from isolated hill-settlements to a unified city, though the evidence afforded is fragmentary at best. If we had at our disposal the record furnished by all the necropolises of the earliest settlements, it might be possible to build up, independently of tradition, the process of the city's develop- ment. But conclusions must be drawn from what was probably only a small portion of the necropolis of the Forum valley, and from a limited number of graves on the Esquiline, which are often recorded in so confused a fashion that it seems dangerous to base any detailed theory upon their evidence. There is almost no evidence from early burials on the Quirinal; the few tombs found are of a date later than the earliest period, some contemporaneous with the latest group of Forum graves, some still later. Con- cerning the date of the earliest habitation of this hill, therefore, and the earliest relations 'See p. 104, footnote 5. 2 DIONYSIUS, 1i, 50. 3 See MOMMSEN, History of Rome, 1, 67. 8</page><page sequence="52">58 INEZ G. SCOTT between this and the other hill-communities, we can only conjecture. The few graves found on the Quirinal are in accord with the tradition that it was occupied by the Sabines. None but inhumation burials occur, and of these two contained terra-cotta sarcophagi in the form of oak-trunks, and in funerary accessories were similar to the oak-coffin tombs in the Forum, which, as has been pointed out, were probably Sabine. 2 The evidence concerning the early settlement of the Quirinal is too slight to be in any way positive, and conclusions based on the early burials must concern only the people of the Esquiline and those who interred their dead in the Forum, probably the inhabitants of the Palatine. Even concerning the Esquiline and the Palatine settlements the evidence is too fragmentary to tell the story independently. But in the attempt to piece out the truth from varying and conflicting traditions it will be profitable to inquire how far the version best attested by tradition is consistent with the archaeological facts. The Sepulcretum of the Forum, east of the temple of Antoninus and Faustina, contains forty graves, of which 15 are cremation, the rest inhumation burials. There is no determi- nable boundary of this cemetery, for many graves were undoubtedly destroyed by the foun- dations of the temple. It is probable that the necropolis originally extended over the full length of the Forum valley. 3 A number of early vases found and preserved by the builders of the equestrian statue of Domitian undoubtedly belonged to an early grave, 4 and the legendary tomb of Romulus near the Comitium suggests that the cemetery once extended to the western end of the Forum, where in fact, near the Volcanal, tomb cuttings have been observed. The necropolis of the Esquiline comprises 164 tombs and o(groups)) of burials. 5 The graves are of various dates, from the earliest period of habitation of the Esquiline down to the 4th and 3rd centuries. As is natural, the earliest are nearer to the spurs of the Oppius and Cispius 6 where the earliest communities must have been, the latest farther out on the slope of the hill, near the Piazza Vittorio Emanuele. The earliest inhabitants interred their dead, according to their custom, just outside the settlement, and as the community included more territory the burial ground was pushed farther out on the hill. This arrangement of the graves of the earlier and later periods is, however, not quite invariable, and more advanced types occasionally occur in localities where primitive graves are the rule. 7 1 Since the settlement on the Quirinal was apparently made by the inhuming people, the race which settled this hill in all probability arrived later than the cremating people who used the Forum as their cemetery. For in Rome, as elsewhere in Latium and Etruria and Umbria, the cremating people came first, and were later partially or totally displaced by the inhuming race. 2 See the preceding chapter, pp. 42 ff. : See VON DUHN, Ital.

Pinza's o groups)) include several burials in one locality, the contents of which were not kept separate. 6 In general the earliest graves are Tombs I-L, found under the modern Via Giovanni Lanza, near the spurs of the Oppius and Cispius.

VI. 7 E. g., Tombs LXI and Lll in this locality are late burials; VI, X, and XXI are later than the most primi- tive period.</page><page sequence="53">EARLY ROMAN TRADITIONS 59 So far as can be determined from records which are often inaccurate and vague, the Esquiline tombs are in large majority inhumation burials. In many cases the reports do not state whether the burial unearthed was inhumation or cremation, and it may be that some of those indefinitely reported were of the latter type. A great number, however, are known to be inhumation burials, and in all probability the majority of those rather indefinitely reported are of this rite. There are only four certain cremation graves on the Esquiline, and while these are primitive, they all contain material dating them later than the very earliest period. 2 Further, though some of the burials vaguely reported may have been cremation tombs, the most primitive of those on the Esquiline are in almost every case known to be fossa graves. Of the nine containing the most consistently early material four are definitely known to be fosse, three are referred to in the earlier records as ((casse, ") and two as ((arche, 5) both terms used elsewhere to describe fossa graves. 3 It is evident, therefore, if we may judge from the number of tombs available, that the earliest settlement on the Esquiline was made by an inhuming people. The few cremation burials, none of them of the earliest period, must represent the time when the two races were mingling. As has been stated, the Sepulcretum of the Forum was used by both cremating and inhuming people. The inhumation tombs yield the same forms of pottery, the same types of fibulae and other personal ornaments, as those of the Esquiline. A few inhuma- tion graves in the Forum are apparently earlier than any on the Esquiline, 4 but similar in character to the most primitive of these. The latest group in the Forum, the six oak-coffin graves, show richer and more advanced material than the majority of Esquiline tombs. But they contain practically no material not found also on the Esquiline, and show no essential difference in character except in the matter of the sarcophagus itself. The similarity between the inhumation burials of the Forum and Esquiline is great enough to warrant assigning them to the same people, - whether actually to the same individual 1 The earlier report of Marzusi (see footnotes in Mon. Ant., xv) frequently refers to the graves as oarche)) or ocasse,)) terms which he regularly uses in cases where we know them to have been fossa tombs; e. g., Tomb LXV, in which inhumed bones were found, was described by Marzusi as auna delle solite arche; )) Tomb XV, of which Pinza does not state the form of burial, Marzusi describes among the class of ((arche funebri, rozzamente formate con pezzi squadrati di tufo,)) the ordinary type of inhumation burial. See also below, footnote n. 3. Gatti, in Bull. Comm., 1887, 278, states that in 1884 about 60 graves were found on the Oppius, all lined with blocks of tufa (volticelle di cappellaccio) and containing remains of inhumed bodies. 2 The tombs are Pinza's numbers XI, XLVIII, LVIII, and CXII. XI contained fibulae with rings, glass beads, and an armlet; the vases, however, were of crude technique. XLVIII contained a fibula with rings; the dolio was hand- made, but the ossuary was fine and perhaps wheel-turned. LVIII had a fibula with rings, and a well-made urn of the modified Villanova type. CXII contained a hut urn decorated with incised lines; the only pottery was a double-handled cup (ansa bifora) with high lunate projec- tion on the handle, a type usually found in tombs not of the earliest period. 3 The nine tombs are VII, IX, XVII, XXVIII, XLII, LIII, LXIV, LXVII, LXXX. VII and IX are referred to as (( arche, )) a term which is used elsewhere, e. g., in the case of Tomb LXV, where the description indicates a fossa grave. XVII, XXVIII and XLII are referred to as casse, and in case of XVII the description shows that it was a fossa tomb. LIII and LXXX are definitely described as inhumation burials; LXIV and LXVII are uncertain. 4 See below, pp. 80 f.</page><page sequence="54">60 INEZ G. SCOTT community cannot be determined, nor is the question of any great consequence. There were communities of inhuming people, at first undoubtedly separate and independent, on the two spurs of the Esquiline, in all probability on the Quirinal, and perhaps on the saddle as well. This race is distinguished from the cremating people whose earliest graves appear only in the Forum, not only by the different form of burial but also by certain differences in funerary furnishings. The differences consist partly in the occurrence in fossa graves of objects which never appear in the cremation burials, such as advanced forms of fibulae, painted and imported pottery, weapons of bronze and iron; partly, in the exclusive occurrence in the cremation burials of certain peculiar objects, the ((calefattoi, little lamps, miniature cups, and reticulate jars, which the cremating people possessed in common with their ancestors of the Alban Hills. The almost exclusive prevalence of inhumation among the earliest burials on the Esquiline proves that this hill was first settled by the inhuming race. But in the problem of locating the people who practiced cremation burial in the Forum we can deal only with probabilities. Situated in the valley between the Esquiline and Palatine, the ceme- tery might have belonged to a community on either hill. But as the inhuming people were evidently settled on the Esquiline, it is a most natural assumption, even apart from the claims of tradition, that the cremation burials belonged to the people of the Palatine. The Sepulcretum is a logical location for the cemetery of the Palatine settlement, outside in the valley just at the foot of the hill. On this side too was a more gentle slope than from the other direction, where the cliff was abrupt. The finding of one fossa grave at the southwest corner of the Palatine is of little significance, as it was not of the earliest period, and must have belonged in any case to the time when there was mingling between the different communities. Some fragments of crude pottery found in the earth in this same vicinity 2 indicate only that there was a very early settlement on this hill. A few fragments of coarse clay decorated with the crudest sort of incised swastika show that there were people dwelling there in the time when the Sepulcretum was first used. Though we must admit the absence of conclusive independent proof that the cremating people were settled on the Palatine, the burial finds are consistent with and support the tradition that the cremating people who came from the Alban Hills occupied the Palatine rather than any of the other hills. 3 That the Albans who buried their dead in the Forum were the first to arrive on the site is claimed by tradition and attested by archaeological evidence.4' Of the 19 I See below, p. 87. 2N. S., 1907, 197 ff. 3 It is also true that of all the hills the Palatine must have been the most easily defended, because of its more precipitous slopes; it would therefore be the site most attractive to the first comers. 4 Burial remains throughout northern and central Italy indicate that the cremating people came into Italy first, and were later partially or wholly displaced by the inhuming people who arrived somewhat later. See VON DUHN, op. cit., 1, Part iv, Die Bestattenden (( Italiker. ))</page><page sequence="55">EARLY ROMAN TRADITIONS 61 or 20 Esquiline tombs which contain pottery of the most primitive sort, all but 10 or 11 contain also objects which date them definitely in a more advanced period than the earliest group of cremation burials of the Forum. I Where the tombs contain only pot- tery of types such as the (( ansa bifora )) cup, Villanova urn, and others which continue to appear from the earliest period down to much later times, advance in period can only be detected by slight advances in technique, such as smoother finish, better quality of clay, more even firing. In the earliest pottery of the Forum cremation burials the clay is coarse and unevenly baked, the surface rough and uneven. In all but a few cases the con- tents of the earliest Esquiline tombs are slightly more advanced. There are about ten graves which show no material unknown in the earliest period of Forum burials. Of these, Tomb VII contained two vases of the modified Villanova form common in the earliest graves, both of which are, however, decorated with an elaborate pattern of incised lines. This elaborate decoration, as well as the somewhat firmer outline, sets them slightly later than the very earliest Forum interments. 2 Tomb IX contained a crude pitcher or ((orcio)) (Mon. Ant., xv, pl. V, 16) and double-handled vases, one of which (Bull. Comm., xxvi, 1898, pl. VIII, 3) appears to be of slightly more advanced technique than the earliest pottery, very similar to a vase in Tomb XVII (Mon. Ant., xv, pl. VI, 13) which was perhaps wheel-turned. Tomb XXVIII yielded a crude amphora (op. cit., pl. VI, 10) and two double-handled vases, one of which was of the type with horn-like projections on the handle. These, while primitive in form, were both made of well-baked clay. Tomb XLII contained a simple bow fibula, of the primitive form found in two of the earliest cremation burials of the Forum. But a Villanova urn with elaborate incised decoration, a terra-cotta spinning whorl, and a bronze ring date it later than the Forum graves containing such fibulae. Tomb LXVII contained, besides some crude ((impasto)) vases, two reticulate jars of the type common in early cremation graves of the Forum. These, however, were made of well-baked clay, and were probably somewhat later than the similar jars occurring in the Forum. The crude double-handled vase and impasto amphora found in Tomb LXIV might have belonged to the most primitive period, as there is no indication of advanced date. From Tomb LXXX there are reported a pitcher, or ((orcio ingubbiato,)) and four fibulae which are not described. As there is no other instance of the occurrence in a single tomb of as many as four early fibulae, the probability is that they are of a more advanced type. I have listed the tombs which appear to be the earliest, with the exception of a few too incompletely reported to be used as proof. If we may trust the evidence, which is somewhat vitiated by lack of scientific excavation and accurate reports, we must conclude that inhumation on the Esquiline began at a somewhat later date than the incineration 1 See below, p. 62. 2 The type is shown in Bull. Comm., xxvi, 1898, pl. VII, 10. This type of urn with elaborate incised pattern occurs in more advanced tombs on the Esquiline, e. g. LXVIII and XLVI. It never occurs in Forum burials of the earliest period.</page><page sequence="56">62 INEZ G. SCOTT burials of the Forum. The same is true of the inhumation graves of the Forum, though there the difference in date between the cremation burials and the earliest fossa tombs is harder to detect. So far as their contents are concerned, the most primitive inhumation burials of the Forum might be as early as any of the cremation burials. Eight fossa graves contained only the crudest of pottery; four of these, JJ, EE, HH, and 00, contained no metal at all, while four, B, P, KK, and PP, contained no metal except fibulae of the simple bow or spiral form. These eight tombs are more primitive than any in the Esquiline necropolis, and apparently belong to the same stage of culture as the earliest cremation burials. There are indirect indications, however, that the use of the inhum- ation rite in the Forum began slightly later than the date of the earliest of the cremation tombs. Among the forty burials in the Forum, there are seven instances of tombs cutting into and partially destroying earlier graves. With the exception of the inhumation tomb J, which is cut by the late burial II, the destroyed tombs are all cremation burials, and they are destroyed always by inhumation tombs. Even one of the very earliest fossa graves, B, cuts into the cremation burial X. In another of the earliest fosse, PP, along with the accessories of the inhumation burial there was an ossuary containing the remains of a cremated body. The probable explanation of this occurrence of the two forms of burial in a single tomb is that the fossa completely destroyed an earlier cremation burial, and the ossuary, spared because of respect for the destroyed tomb, was left in the newly made grave. The respective depth of the inhumation and incineration burials also indicates that the latter are of a somewhat more advanced period. Ordinarily the early cremation burials are at a lower level than the fossa graves, while the fosse are practically never lower than the cremation graves. I The only early fossa which goes down to a lower level than that of the cremation graves is Tomb B, which is slightly deeper than the nearby cremation tombs X, U, and A. But this fossa must have been made exceptionally deep, for it is indubitably of a later date than the cremation burial X, which it partially destroys. 2 1 I am here not considering the late group of oak- coffin burials, which are the deepest in the Forum. In the case of these the level obviously cannot be significant of date; they must for some reason have been made deeper than the ordinary fosse. 2 The average level of the bottom of an incineration tomb in the Forum is about 10 m. above sea level. The reports in the Notizie quote the levels as much as 50 or 60 cm. higher, but the measurement is given from the level of the hole filled in with tufa blocks, not from the bottom level of the dolio itself, the whole height of which is below the blocks. See sectional diagrams, N. S., 1906, pp. 257, 259, 275, as compared with the levels cited in the text concerning Tombs U, V, X, and S. S-10.60 m. cited in N.

The evident inference from the arrangement and from the level of burials in the Forum is that the inhumation tombs began to appear only after the Forum had been used for some time by the cremating people. The main facts of the first settlement of the site of Rome are essentially as the traditions claim: the Albans, who settled on the Palatine, were the first to arrive on the site, but were soon followed by the new inhuming race which occupied the Esquiline and probably other hills as well. The more detailed accounts of the successive stages of the development of the city are less consistent. The Sabines, who were first received into the state, are traditionally placed on the Quirinal, and traditions of Sabine connection hung particularly about that hill. 2 But the generally accepted account of the growth of the city makes the Septimontium the second stage, and attributes the addition of the Quirinal to the third stage, the period of the (( Four Regions. )) Livy represents Servius Tullius as having added the Quirinal and enlarged the Esquiline, part of which had belonged to the earlier city. This confusion in the traditions with regard to the place occupied by the Sabines is perhaps to be explained by supposing that the new people as they came in, probably in successive waves of a general race movement, settled on several hills, the Quirinal, Oppius, Cispius, and the Velia; but that the communities on the Esquiline were the first to be federated with the settlement of the Palatine, while the Quirinal continued its separate existence for a longer time. The formation of the hills makes this the likely process of growth, as the saddle furnishes a natural connecting link between the Esquiline and the Palatine, while the Quirinal was more or less cut off from the Palatine by the swampy valley of the Forum. The fragmentary testimony of the burials accords with this succession of stages in the city's growth, although such evidence becomes more unreliable as the more detailed information is demanded of it. The Forum graves furnish a significant argument for the existence of the Septimontium, or something approximating it, as a real stage in the city's development. The fact that the Sepulcretum was used for a time simultaneously by the two peoples implies some sort of relationship between the various communities to which the burials belonged, either actual mingling of the races, or at least a peaceful and friendly existence side by side. 3 Further, the use of the Forum as a cemetery, the 1 Levels of the earliest fossa graves are as follows: Level of B, 10.14 m. (or 10.02 m. according to N. S., 1906); level of P, 10.24 m.; level of PP, 10.80 m.; level of 00, 11.00 m.; level of HH, 11.75 m.; level of KK, 11.12 m. Of the more advanced inhumation burials, L is 10.68 m. above sea-level, 0 is 10.95 m. II (which cuts GG) is 1 1.35 m. The late cremation burial GG is cited (N. S., 191 1, 169) as 12.26 m. to 1 1.82 m. 2 For example, the supposed Sabine origin of Semo Sancus (See WISSOWA, Rel. u. K. d. Ram.2, p. 130) and of Quirinus (VARRO, L. L., v, 74; DION., ii, 48, 50). 3 It has been suggested (see above, pp. 32 f.) as an explanation of the disappearance of cremation burials from the Forum that there may have been some hostile usurpation of the site by the inhuming people. That hypothesis would in any case only apply to the later</page><page sequence="58">64 INEZ G. SCOTT natural place for the burial-ground so long as the federated communities did not sur- round the valley and need the Forum as a thoroughfare, shows that there were at first no connections across the valley with the settlement of the Quirinal and its southern neighbor, the Capitoline. For the cemetery must have been abandoned as soon as the Forum became the common ground between the different parts of a city instead of a swamp isolating one community from another. The burials in the Forum, therefore, represent a period during which the people of the Esquiline and the Palatine were united in some sort of federation, and were yet in no real sense connected with the community on the Quirinal. Various bits of evidence indicate, further, that there was some mingling between the communities of the Esquiline and Palatine during this period, and therefore some real progress toward amalgamation. Apart from the fact that the Forum cemetery was used simultaneously by both races, I the occurrence of a few cremation tombs on the Esquil- ine indicates some mingling between the two peoples. Since these cremation tombs belong invariably to a somewhat later period than the earliest burials of either the Forum or Esquiline, they are best explained as belonging to the time when the isolation of the several settlements was breaking down. The one fossa grave on the Palatine, which is not of the earliest period, may represent the same stage in the process of unification. Close association, if not actual mingling, between the communities of the Esquiline and Palatine, may be inferred also from the occasional occurrence in Esquiline fossa graves of objects characteristic of the incineration burials of Rome and the Alban Hills. Of these charac- teristic objects one of the most common in the Forum cremation burials is the little boat-shaped vase, apparently a lamp. 2 Three such lamps were found on the Esquiline, all in Tomb I, a burial of somewhat more advanced period than the Forum graves in which the lamps occurred.' The reticulate jars characteristic of cremation burials of both Rome and the Alban Hills 4 also occur occasionally on the Esquiline. These too period of inhumation burials, when a later influx of the new stock apparently overwhelmed the cremating people for a time. The earliest inhuming people to arrive on the site of Rome apparently settled peaceably beside the community of cremating people. 1 The disappearance of cremation burials from the Forum, even if due to a general usurpation by a later wave of the inhuming race, is no proof against a previous, and an eventual, mingling of the two races. It is certain that the cremating stock did not die out (as it seems to have done at some other sites), because the cremation rite regained the ascendancy later. During the latest period of burials in the Forum the cremating people must have buried their dead elsewhere,-where and for what reason, we can only conjecture. 2 Such little lamps are found in burials of the Alban Hills and Rome, and also in Sabine territory, and occa- sionally in Southern Etruria; see VON DUHN, op. cit., 1, 403 and 422; Ann. Ist., Ivii, 1885, 52, cites them among the objects showing relation between Southern Etruria and the Alban Hills. 3 The pottery of Tomb I was all hand-made, though of well-baked clay, but a bronze ring and a fibula with elongated foot date this grave later than the Forum burials containing such lamps. 4 See VON DUHN, op. cit., 1, p. 407. This type of jar is not common elsewhere except at Marsiliana; see MINTO, Marsiliana, p. 286. There, however, the common reticulate jars are of a more advanced form than any examples from Latium. Examples from Bisenzio (N. S., 1894, 132) are considered by VON DUHN (i, p. 336) an indication of overland trade with Latium. One from a fossa grave in Vetulonia (MONTELIUS, pl. 195, 12) is of quite a different type.</page><page sequence="59">EARLY ROMAN TRADITIONS 65 were usually found in tombs somewhat more advanced than the corresponding ones in the Forum. In one case, Tomb LXVII (Mon. Ant., xv, fig. 54), the grave containing the reticulate jars had no other accessories at all. The jars themselves, however, were made of well-baked clay, and may therefore be of a later date than those in the Forum, which are usually unevenly baked and coarse. In the four other Esquiline tombs in which reticulate jars occur there was in each case something to date the burials later than the earliest period. In Tomb XXIV there were fibulae with rings and enlarged bow, and a bronze spear-head, while the reticulate jar itself was wheel-turned. Tomb XXXIII contained, besides a reticulate jar of well-baked clay, a bronze spear-head and an amphora which appeared to be wheel-turned. In Tomb XVIII there were only crude hand-made vases and two early spiral fibulae, but an iron spear-head proves the burial to be of later date. In XCII the reticulate jar was found alongwith a primitive serpentine fibula, a fibula of the late form known as ((a navicella, )) and a cup that was perhaps wheel-turned. The boat-shaped lamps and reticulate jars which occur in the earliest period of the Forum burials, and which, as we know, were brought with the cremating people from their home in the Alban Hills, were apparently not known to the earliest inhabitants of the Esquiline. Their occurrence in more advanced Esquiline graves suggests that the types were adopted from the cremating people. The Esquiline burials containing these objects, almost all of which are of the period when wheel-turned vases, iron weapons, and advanced types of fibulae were beginning to appear, must represent the time when the neighboring com- munities of the Esquiline and Palatine were living on terms of friendly intercourse if they were not actually mingling. The early types of fibulae found in the Sepulcretum frequently occur in Esquiline tombs of slightly advanced period. It is dangerous to draw inferences from these, as fibulae of both the bow and spiral types are found elsewhere, in inhumation as well as cremation burials. ' But the fact remains that the most primitive fibulae, like the reti- culate jars and boat-shaped lamps which were apparently borrowed from the cremating people, occur in none of the most primitive Esquiline burials, 2 but appear in tombs of a later date. The spiral type of fibula (which occurs in the Forum in the earliest cre- mation tombs, S, U, Y, and in the earliest fosse, KK, P, and B) is found in six Esquiline tombs, all of which have distinctly later material: XII yielded an iron dagger, amber, and glass, XVIII fragments of iron and several bronze ornaments, XXVII bronze rings and a flat circle of bronze, XXIX an iron knife and a wheel-turned vase, XLIX an iron spear-head and a painted vase, and XCII a late fibula and a cup that was perhaps 1 They were apparently an inheritance from an earlier age before the races had separated, or perhaps were adopted by both races from the indigenous people whom they encountered in Italy. See VON DUHN, op. cit., 1, 128-9, 135, 193, 445, 543. 2 Of the most primitive Esquiline graves (see p. 59, note 3), only one, XLII, contained a primitive bow fibula of the type which occurs in the earliest burials of the Forum. 9</page><page sequence="60">66 INEZ G. SCOTT wheel-turned. One simple bow fibula of the type which occurs in the early Forum burials, in the cremation grave T and the early fosse KK and PP, was found in Tomb XLII along with several early vases, a modified Villanova urn with elaborate incised pattern, and a bronze ring. This is the earliest Esquiline tomb in which a fibula was found, and yet it is not of the very earliest period. With the exception of this one instance the simple bow fibulae found in Esquiline tombs have the bow slightly enlarged,' and usually occur in tombs containing iron knives, wheel-turned vases, amber and glass- paste beads, or some other material which dates them later than the early period of Esqui- line burials. Both of the primitive types of fibula common among the cremating people of the Forum, brought with them from their earlier home in the Alban Hills, were apparently adopted from them, first by the inhuming people who shared the Forum cemetery, and at a later time by the people who lived slightly farther away on the Esquiline. The fact that objects characteristic of the Forum cremation burials, both fibulae and certain types of vases, occur on the Esquiline almost invariably in more advanced burials, admits of but one interpretation. The tombs containing these objects must be of the time when the communities of the Esquiline and Palatine were in the process of uniting, the period represented in the traditions as the stage of the Septimontium. There is this basis in archeological proof, then, for the existence of the Septimontium: there was a period in the development of the city during which the people of the Esquiline and Palatine and probably the saddle were living on amicable terms or actually mingling, while the Quirinal, though probably inhabited, was isolated from these settlements. The date at which this isolation ceased is undoubtedly set by the cessation of burials in the Forum, which made the Forum usable as a thoroughfare between the parts of the city of the ((Four Regions. )) The Calendar of Numa proves the existence of a city corresponding approximately to the city of (( Four Regions )) at some time earlier than the organization under the Etruscan Servius Tullius. This organization took place during the latter part of the sixth century. We should therefore expect that a considerable period of time inter- vened between the latest burials in the Forum and the coming of the Etruscans about the middle of the sixth century. Again the evidence from the burials is in accord with the history as worked out from the traditions, and agrees with the traditional dating. The latest tomb in the Forum is the oak-coffin burial G, which is dated by a proto-Corinthian lekythos decorated with a band of running dogs. 2 The introduction of proto-Corinthian ware into Italy is placed shortly after 680 B. C., and this advanced type of vase probably belonged to the later years of the seventh century.3~ The burials of the Forum had 1 VON DUHN, op. cit., I, 475, lists from Esquiline graves 15 simple bow fibulae which had no rings or other indication of later date. Of these, however, all but two have the bow slightly enlarged, and occur in more advanced burials. 2 N. S., 1903, 388, fg. 17. 3 J. H.

There is then a period of more than half a century which represents the time of the city of ((Four Regions)) or the o(city of Numa,)) or by whatever name we choose to describe the city at a date after the Quirinal had been united with the other hills but before the beginning of what is known as the Etruscan period. While the early burials show the existence of the traditional four stages in the city's development, they do not disclose to what extent Rome was at each stage a city in the later sense of the word, and to what extent merely a group of settlements maintaining some sort of intercourse with one another. Tradition represents the community of the Palatine founded by Romulus as a city defended by some sort of fortification and provided with three gates which gave access from the river and from the Forum. Dionysius (ii, 65, 3) refers to cn5 tccpa'6ovo Xoiv,CV 'P6peb, jv izivc (Romulus) sLycsv, and again in i, 88, 2 mentions ((":o :Cyos. There are no remains of any fortification earlier than the sixth century wall which enclosed the Servian city, and it is most unlikely that this early fortification was a stone wall such as Servius built. From other sites, however, we have some evidence concerning the more primitive method of defense. While in no case are there primitive defenses as early as the traditional date of a separate fortification of the Palatine, we do know that these defenses represent the stage of fortification earlier and more primitive than the walls of isodomic masonry which they in some cases pre- ceded. At a number of sites in Faliscan territory there are remains of primitive forti- fications. 2 The method of constructing the defense was to scarp the slope of the hill where the line was most irregular, and to build up the edge of the hill with an (( agger, )) a parapet of rocks and earth. In some cases the rocks are carefully laid and fitted together to make a firm defense, but they are never cut into blocks. 3 Ordinarily the sides of the hills were scarped to make approach difficult, except at two or three points where the gates were placed. At Monte Sant'Angelo 4 there were gates at the north and south, at Monterado there were gates at the east, north, and south. At Ardea there were found traces of a gate at the place where the approach had been left unprotected by escarpment. If the hill did not fall away and furnish protection by steep slopes, as at Ardea, where the hill is joined at one side to a broad plateau, the agger or parapet was protected in front by an artificial ditch. 6 It is some such defense that we must suppose to have beeh the original fortification of the Palatine city. It is true that in no case can we with any certainty assign an early 1 See VON DUHN, op. cit., I, 467; also BRYAN, Italic Hut Urns, 42 ff. 2 Mon. Ant., iv, 44 ff., lists sites in Faliscan territory where there are remains of fortifications. Other such fortifications existed at Marzabotto, (HELBIG, Die Ital. in der Poebene, 45), and at Cesi in Umbria (N. S., 1884, 149-50), where they were later replaced by polygonal walls. 3 Mon.

SCOTT date to these remains of primitive fortifications; there is no means of dating, except that in some cases they were later replaced by walls of isodomic construction, which are probably nowhere earlier than the seventh century. Crude pottery found at Monte Sant'Angelo, I where the parapet of rocks was later replaced by a stone wall, proves that there was an early settlement on the site. But at what period the primitive agger was built it is impossible to say. At Rome the first wall enclosing the whole city was built, according to tradition, in the late sixth century by Servius Tullius. As will be shown later, the traditions con- cerning the wall of Servius are essentially correct; for while the so-called a Servian wall)) dates from the fourth century, there was probably a stone wall on approximately the same line as early as the end of the sixth century. It is quite possible that Servius' wall of stone was preceded by the same sort of primitive defense which preceded stone fortifications elsewhere. As has often been suggested, the tradition of the amurus terreus Carinarum!) (VARRO, L. L., v, 48) may reflect a time when the defenses of the Palatine and the other hill communities were merely crude aggeres of earth and stones. (eMurus terreus)) would aptly describe the parapet which outlined the scarped edges of the hill at Monte Sant'Angelo, or the agger which cuts the plateau of Ardea. As there were gates to protect the approaches at Ardea and at other sites, so the tradition of the three gates of the Palatine city may imply no better fortification than an agger of rocks and earth. Such primitive fortifications, which may have existed on the Palatine and on other hills as well, probably furnished sufficient defense until the time of the unified city, when the boundaries no longer coincided with the slopes of the hills, and the whole city was fortified by the Servian wall and agger. If the Septimontium existed as a city and had any sort of fortification, there must have been an artificial ditch to protect the parapet where it left the slopes of the hills, as there was at Ardea where the hill joined the plateau. But it seems more probable that the Septimontium was a federation of a group of hill settlements rather than a fortified city, 2 and that the first wall to enclose a group of hills was that constructed by Servius Tullius. 1 Mon. Ant., iv, 49. ' The hypothesis of the federated settlements satis- factorily accounts for the persistence of the traditions concerning the ((montani)) of the smaller hills of the Septi- montium. Further, the fact that the names of the Palatine gates survived in tradition suggests that the defenses of the separate communities did not give place at an early period to another crude fortification enclosing the hills of the Septimontium.</page><page sequence="63">CHAPTER IV. ETRUSCAN ROME. THE SERVIAN WALL. IN the traditions of the early city there is a noticeable break between the period of the first four kings, who were Latin or Sabine, and that of the last three rulers, who were Etruscans. The Romans themselves admitted that for a time Etruscan princes, with comparatively few supporters, rose to sovereignty over the native popu- lation of the city. There is abundant evidence of an Etruscan occupation of Rome, though more evidence of a marked influence exerted upon the early Italic culture than of the actual presence of Etruscan population. 1 This evidence is sufficient to have given rise to a belief that the Etruscans were the real founders of Rome. There is now com- 1 During the reigns of the Etruscan kings there must have been an appreciable number of Etruscans in Rome, though they were never more than a small minority. The Etruscans seem to have pursued the same course in other cities, e. g. in Falerii and Veii, except that there they continued to hold the chief power and to impress their civilization upon the native population. Burial remains there show that the bulk of the population was Italic, though dominated by Etruscan civilization. (See L. R. TAYLOR, Local Cults of Etruria, pp. 7-8; L. A. HOLLAND, Faliscans). Curiously enough, in Rome itself there have been found almost no tombs which can with any reason be called Etruscan. A very few tombs, CLXX just inside the wall, and CXXV and CXXVI outside the wall on the Esquiline, are of the ( camera ) form common among the Etruscans and apparently entirely foreign to the Italic races. These, while they may be originally of the time when the Etruscans occupied Rome, also contained pottery of the 4th or 3rd century. We must assume, therefore, that the Etruscan families which built the tombs lived on in Rome after the age when the Etruscan rulers were expelled, unless perhaps a few of the inhuming people of Rome adopted the Etruscan burial custom, which differed from their own only in the matter of display. Of the few chamber tombs in Rome, CLXX contained almost no datable material; some Etrusco-Campanian ware was found in the earth blocking the entrance. CXXV contained a number of proto-Corinthian vases and a bucchero kantharos, as well as Etrusco-Campanian ware. CXXVI contained one proto-Corinthian balsamario, and otherwise chiefly Etrusco-Campanian ware. XCIV, in- side the wall, contained a full set of armor of the sort found in Etruscan camera tombs. It is probable that the armor came from Etruria, though the presence of some impasto vases, among them a Latial ansa bifora, probably indicates that the deceased was Italic and not Etruscan. In 1922 Dall'Osso discovered a number of chamber tombs, undoubtedly Etruscan, on Monte Mario, in the district known as Colle di Sant'Agata. The tombs and the foundations of earlier rectangular huts found beneath them were illustrated by DALL'OSSO in Nuova Antologia, Dec. 16, 1923, and Apr. 16, 1924, and by LEOPOLD in Mededeelingen van het Nederlandsch Historisch Institut te Rome, ii, 1922, 38-65. In the tombs were found a few vases of proto-Corinthian ware, some ((palaeo- Etruscan)) black clay ware, and an amphora of yellow clay. The contents, though scanty, are sufficient to date the burials in the sixth and seventh centuries. The tombs were unquestionably made by Etruscans living in Rome during the reign of Etruscan princes. See also J. COLIN, in Rev. Arch., ser. V, xvii, 1923, 297-302.</page><page sequence="64">70 INEZ G. SCOTT pelling proof of a considerable development of an Italic civilization on the site of Rome before there was any appreciable foreign influence. Italic settlements had been founded on the various hills at least two centuries before the traditional date of the coming of the Etruscan Tarquin, and by the sixth century these settlements had been unified into a city or at least into a well-organized federation. There is every reason to believe, however, that Rome was first formally organized as a civil and military state and first forti- fied under the leadership of an Etruscan overlord, and that the construction of the most important early buildings was undertaken under Etruscan direction and with the help of builders and artists from Etruria. It is probable that foreign importations of pot- tery and ornament, and Greek influence upon native arts, first came to Rome through Etru- ria, I and that the Etruscans were Rome's teachers in things material and artistic as well as in matters of ritual. The presence in later Roman ritual of much that is Etruscan undoubtedly points to an early period when the city was dominated, culturally at least, by them. The same inference is to be drawn from the great number of old Roman names which can be traced to an Etruscan origin. 2 The commercial treaty concluded between Rome and Carthage in 509 B. C., 3 recorded in Polybius, iii, 22, 4ff., seems rather to reflect the pretensions of a city where the Etruscans had held sway than of a purely Italic city. 4 The Etruscans are known to have had dealings with the Carthaginians and to have concluded treaties with them. 5 Moreover the later treaty of the 4th century (Polybius, iii, 24), which shows a distinct decline in prestige in Latium and a corresponding loss of interest in trade, is quite explicable if we assume that Rome's original claims to a protectorate over Latium were made by an ambitious Etruscan prince. Apart from the inferences to be drawn from the general situation in Latium at the end of the 6th century, the accounts concerning the individual Etruscan rulers show a consistency with the facts which points to their correctness. Tradition makes Tarquin the son of the Greek Demaratus, who had been driven from his native Corinth by political difficulties and had come to settle in Tarquinii, bringing with him the artists Eucheir, Diopes, and Eugrammos (PLINY, N. H., xxxv, 152). His coming from Corinth with Greek artists not only coincides correctly with the time of the appearance of Greek prod- ucts and strong Greek influence in Etruscan art, but also with facts of Greek History. For Herodotus (v, 92) in his account of the tyranny of Cypselus and his son Periander gives authority for the departure of many prominent citizens from Corinth at the time when Demaratus must have come to Tarquinii. 6 1 Etruscan remains show Greek influence everywhere, and what Greek importations appear in Rome are usually still more common in Etruria. 2 See SCHULZE, Zur Geschichte Lateinischer Eigennamen. 8 See FRANK, Economic History, pp. 30 ff. and note 26. 4 See ADAMS, Commerce of Early Latium, Chapter VI, p. 70, and FRANK, loc. cit. 5 ARISTOTLE, Pol., iii, 9, 2180 a; PINDAR, Pyth., I (72), 140; PAULY-WISSOWA, X, p. 2226, Karthago; MELTZER, Geschichte der Karthager, 1, 168 ff. 6 Liv., I, 34,2; CICERO, de Rep., ii, 20, 35. Further, the traditional date of the Etruscan domination in Rome</page><page sequence="65">EARLY ROMAN TRADITIONS 71 The most specific and the most important evidence for the rule of the Etruscan Tarquins in Rome is furnished by a wall-painting in a tomb at Volci discovered in 1857. ' The name of one of the figures in the painting, Gneve Tarau: RumaZ (or Gnaeus Tarquinius of Rome), is an authoritative and completely independent corroboration of the Roman tradition of a king Tarquin. The painting apparently represents an episode in Etruscan tradition, the freeing of Caele Vipinas (Lat. Caeles Vibenna in Varro, Tacitus, and Festus Caelius Vivenna in Claudius) by Macstrna (Lat. Mastarna), and a conflict between four pairs of combatants. Four of the warriors are apparently from Volci, since only their names are given, without corresponding geographical names, and the four others are Etruscans, among them Gneve Tarqu: RumaZ. The important part of the scene is obviously the freeing of Caile Vipinas by his friend Macstrna, while the slaying of Gneve TarZu and his allies is apparently only incidental to the rescue. The significance for Roman tradition lies not only in the occurrence of the name of Tarquin of Rome, but in the curious coincidence of the names Macstrna and Vipinas with those of an obscure legend discovered by the emperor Claudius. That legend2 claimed the identity of Servius Tullius with an Etruscan Mastarna, the companion of Caeles Vibenna, also an Etru- scan. If there has been no contamination between the Etruscan and Roman traditions the tomb painting is a signif- icant piece of independent evidence for the authenticity of the Tarquins' rule in Rome, and the interpretation of the scene is important for the history of the late regal period. Since we know that Volci must have come into conflict with the Romans for some time before her final fall in 280 I D3 D v D4 D2 E Dsf?f '11 A A1 L 8 D, * A Fig. 1. B. C., I the dating of the tomb painting must determine the probability of the independ- ence of the Etruscan tradition. The Volci tomb has been most adequately described and discussed by Korte in Jahrbuch des Archalologischen Instituts, xii, 1897, pp. 57-80. 4 The tomb consists, as will be seen from Korte's plan (Fig. 1), of a deep vestibule (A), a central room with an alcove (B and B'), three main burial chambers (D2, C, and Ds), and four accessory chambers which open off the two side passages (Di, D3, D4, D6). coincides with the period of greatest power of the Etruscans in Italy. During the sixth century they greatly extended their power in Campania as well as in Etruria and Latium. In 524 B. C. they made an attack on Cumae (DIONYSIUS, vii, 3), and in the course of the century held many of the Campanian cities (PAULY-WISSOWA, VI, 751-2, Etrusker). The date at which they were expelled from Rome coincides with the beginning of their decline elsewhere. In 474 B. C. they met ,a naval defeat at the hands of the Greeks (C. I. G., no. 16, Olympia, Ergebnisse, V, n. 249; PINDAR, Pyth., 1, 72 (140)), and their power continued to wane until in 423 B. C. they lost Capua to the Samnites (Livy, iv, 37). 1 Discovered by Alexandre Fransois, first reported in Bull. Ist., 1857, 97 if. and 113 ff. 2 DESSAU, I. L.

Others from the drawings of NOEL DES VERGERS</page><page sequence="66">72 INEZ G. SCOTT A wall (E) was built at some later date to block off the three chambers at the right. There were paintings on the walls of the central room, the end chamber C, and on the entrance walls outside the main chamber at the right (D5). These last were the figures of a man and a woman: at the left (VI) a man named Vel. Saties, dressed in a richly embroidered tunic; at the right (VII), very badly preserved, a woman named 8anyvil: Verati: hels. atrs. These probably represent the man and his wife who were buried in this chamber (Ds), - the man, undoubtedly, who had the paintings made. On walls III, IV, and V are the three parts of the scene from Etruscan legend in which Mastarna, Vibenna and Tarquin appear. These will be described in detail later in connection with the interpretation of the scene; it is sufficient at present to note that they are obviously of the same date as the other paintings of the tomb. On the other walls of the central chamber are various mythological scenes: on wall VIII Sisyphus and Amphiaraus (Sisce, Amyare) 1 on wall IX Ajax and Cassandra (Aivas, Casntra) 2 on wall X Phoenix ((Fuinis); 3 on wall XI Nestor (Nestur); 4 on wall XII the conflict of Eteocles and Polynices (QEv?I E ucle, Pulunice). 5 The most elaborate of the mythological scenes is that on walls I and II, just opposite the scene from Etruscan legend. This pictures the sacrifice of captured Trojans at the funeral of Patroclus. 6 In the center are Achilles (Axle) and (Telamonian) Ajax (name fragmentary) sacrificing the Trojan youths (Truials), - Achilles in the act of slaying one while Ajax leads forth a second. Behind Achilles and the Trojan stand the goddess of destiny, Van9, 7 and Charon (Charu) with a hammer in his hand; to the left of Van( is the shade of Patroclus, (HinOial: Patrucles). At the extreme left stands Agamemnon (Acmenrun) clad in a mantle, and at the right Oilean Ajax (Aivas: Vilatas), in armor but without a helmet. The scenes of the Volci tomb represent an advanced era in Etruscan painting, the period when all traces of the archaic had gone and the art had reached its full develop- ment. There is full freedom of the figures, varied pose, and there even are traces of chiaroscuro, the modelling indicated in an imperfect way by crosslines in the shaded parts.

The lekythos, which shows the same imperfect use of chiaroscuro, has been dated in the late 5th century. 3 Brunn and Helbig in their classification of Etruscan paintings assigned a later date to paintings of this class. 4 Though admitting that only a rudimentary use of chiaroscuro was revealed, they claimed that this was deliberate on the part of the artist, and due to the location of the paintings in a tomb, where the dim light would not give chiaroscuro its full effect. There seems no justification, as K6rte argues, 5 for supposing that an Etruscan artist of the 3rd century would imitate methods of Greek painting which had long since gone out of use. While Brunn and Helbig place in the third century the whole group to which the Volci painting belongs, 6 more recent scholars almost unani- mously assign them to an earlier period. Korte first proposed to date them fairly early in the fourth century, 7 and he is supported by more recent determination of the periods of Etruscan tomb painting. Weege 8 places the Tomba dell'Orco in the 4th century; Poulsen's classification 9 puts the Tomba Golini and the first chamber of the Tomba dell'Orco in the late 5th century, the scene of the underworld in the same tomb in the transition between the 5th and 4th, the scene of Odysseus and Polyphemus in the 4th century. 10 Further evidence from the tomb itself corroborates the dating of the paintings rather early in the 4th century. The tomb was evidently used for generations, as there were 30 or 40 burials in all, with a wide difference in date between the earliest and latest objects found. The earliest was an Attic vase, a red-figured amphora of the severe style; the latest a Rhodian vase of the 3rd or 2nd century. I" The probable period of the use of the tomb is therefore from the late 5th century to the 3rd or 2nd century. Obviously the chambers D2, C, and D5 were the first constructed, since the remaining four open from the passage-ways to D2 and D5. Chamber C is the only one adorned with paintings, and for this reason, as well as because of its position at the end of the atrium, it was ' Mon.

WEEGE, p. 108). These reveal the later ideas of the underworld; in the Volci painting, on the contrary, there is no terror of Vane and Charon. 1 See K6RTE, op. cit., 63. The amphora was one of those pictured in NOEL DES VERGERS, Etrurie et les gtrus- ques, Vol. III, Pls. XXXII-XXXVIL. I (</page><page sequence="68">74 INEZ G. SCOTT probably the first in which burials were made. D2 and D5, the main side chambers, must have been used next. The portraits of Vel: Saties and his wife ?anyvil, undoubtedly painted at the same time as the scenes in the central room, are on the entrance walls of D5. The paintings, therefore, are contemporaneous with the second or third burials in the tomb. A long period must have elapsed between the time of the paintings and the final closing of the tomb in the 3rd or 2nd century; not only were four more chambers built, but at some later date a wall (E) was constructed to cut off the three chambers at the right, and burials were placed all round the walls of the atrium. The second or third burial would probably have occurred therefore at some time during the 4th century, the date deduced from the study of the paintings themselves. This dating of the paintings is significant for our judgment of the Volci tradition concerning Mastarna and Vibenna, because it precludes the possibility of contamination from Roman sources. Volci succumbed to Roman power in 280 B. C., I and must have come into conflict with Rome at some time earlier. But it is most improbable that in the early part of the 4th century there was sufficient contact between the two cities to allow any contamination of their traditions. The occurrence in the Volcentian representation of the heroes Vibenna, Mastarna, and Tarquin of Rome, must therefore have been inde- pendent of the Roman stories involving these names. We must now consider in more detail the painting itself and the significance of its correspondence with Roman legends. The historical scene is inferior in composition to the mythological scene opposite, probably because in the latter case the composition was more or less traditional, while in the former the artist had no models. The scene consists of five pairs of figures, at the left Mastarna (Macstrna) cutting the rope which binds the hands of Caeles Vibenna (Caile Vipinas), and on the main wall and round the corner on wall V, four successive pairs of combatants. 2 The rescue is obviously the purpose of the conflict and therefore the important scene, though it is placed at the extreme left, with the figure of Vibenna himself round the corner on wall III. Mastarna, who is bearded and nude, cuts the rope with his own sword, while he has hanging from his shoulder his empty sheath, and another sheathed sword evidently for his comrade, Vibenna. To the right of Mastarna an unbearded man in short tunic, LarO. UlOes, stabs Laris PapaOnas: Velznay (from Volsinii?), whom he holds by the hair. The latter is unbearded and nude, his mantle just falling from his shoulders. The next pair are Pesna Arcmsnas: Svetimax and Rasce, who is stabbing his victim in the throat. The former is unbearded and partially wrapped in his mantle, the latter bearded and nude, his empty sheath 1 Fasti Triumphales, C. I. L., 1, p. 457. Among the eight cities of Etruria who promised to send aid to the Romans (in 205 B. C.), mentioned in Liv., xxviii, 45, 14-18, there is no mention of Volci; it had probably been de- stroyed or had sunk to insignificance. 2 GARRUCCI, Tavole Fotografiche, III and IV; Mon.

In the next group, the last on wall IV, the victim, Veni&amp; Cau[le]s (?): plsay7s, is grasped by the hair from behind and stabbed in the breast by Aule Vipinas (Aulus Vibenna) who is bearded and nude, his sheath under his left arm. Ven0i Caules (?) himself is armed with corselet and greaves, and like his fellow victims has no sword.

In the main the interpretation of the scene is clear: Caile Vipinas is being freed from his captors by his brother Aule, Macstrna, and their three companions, who have succeeded in surprising and slaying the captors of Caile. Caile and his five friends are undoubtedly Volcientes, as they have the accompanying place names which invariably accompany the names of the victims. 3 Certain of the names occurring in the painting are known also in Roman tradition. Caile and Aule Vipinas have their counterparts in the Caeles and Aulus Vibenna of Roman legend. Caeles Vibenna appears as the eponymous hero connected with the Caelian Hill, a Tuscan leader who came to Rome to assist Romulus or, according to another version Tarquinius Priscus: ((C(a)elius mons a C(a)ele Vibenna, Tusco duce nobili, qui cum sua manu dicitur Romulo venisse auxilio contra Tati[n]um regem)) (VARRO, L. L., v, 46). That Caeles Vibenna had a brother Aulus is attested by the occurrence on a vase of the name ((Aules V[i]pinas") (FABRETTI, 2579), and by a statement from Fabius Pictor (ARNOBIUS, Adv. Nat., vi, 7; Hist. Rom. Rel., ed. PETER, 2 I, 23f., Q. FABIUS PICTOR, 12) that an Aulus from Volci was slain by the servants of his brother: (( regnatoris in populi Capitolio qui est hominum qui ignoret Oli esse sepulchrum Vulcentani?.... cur manu servuli vita fuerit spoliatus et lumine,.... )). He is also mentioned with this brother Caeles in a passage in Festus (p. 355M., 486L.), if we may accept the restoration of Garrucci, 5 which is the most satisfactory: 1 The drawing of NOEL DES VERGERS has for this name -nOi Cal - Pisn -. The ending y is what we should expect, as this occurs in the case of all the other victims; it is apparently the ending for a name of a town to denote ((place from which.)) 2 MiUNZER, Rhein. Mus., liii, 1898, 614 ff., claims that this is not related to the rest of the painting. His arguments are based, however, on slight differences that are only incidental, as for example, the fact that there is no actual killing in this scene, and the fact that both men have Roman names. 3 Rumax and Velznaz at least can be identified with names of cities, Rome and Volsinii (PAIS, St. Cr., 1, 513): KORTE, op. cit., 72, interprets Velznax as Volci, but Volsinii is more probable, as the victorious combatants who have no accompanying place names must be Volci- entes. Svetimay might be Sutrium, or perhaps Sappinates near Volsinii (Liv., v, 31, 5), as Pais suggests (I, 513). 4 Cf. also DION., ii, 37; according to TACITUS, Ann., iv, 65, Caeles Vibenna came to assist Tarquinius Priscus: (sedem eam acceperat a Tarquinio Prisco, seu quis alius regum dedit, nam scriptores in eo dissentiunt. )) 5 GARRUCCI, Diss. Arch., 11, 62. PAIS (1, 510, n. 1) restores the passage differently. He leaves out Aulus, making the brothers (( Caeles et Vibenna, )) and in the last line reads Gmaxime adduxisse, eum coluerint. )) Garrucci's restoration is the more satisfactory; cf. DE SANCTIS, Klio, ii, 1902, 98; MULLER, Etrusker, p. 1 11; GARDT- HAUSEN, Mastarna, p. 40.</page><page sequence="70">76 INEZ G.

The restoration is based upon the epitome of Paulus, which supplies the reference to Porsena: (( Tuscus vicus Romae est dictus, quod ibi habitaverunt Tusci, qui recedente ab obsi- dione Porsena remanserunt. )) Mueller reads ((Caeles et Vibenna,)) omitting the ((Aulus,)) but the independent occurrence of the name (( Caeles Vibenna)) is sufficient to discredit the reading which makes Caeles and Vibenna two separate persons. Further; Fabius' remark concerning Aulus of Volci and his brother, as well as the occurrence of the two names in the Volci painting and in a scene on an Etruscan mirror, I argues for the correction to ((Caeles et A. Vibenna.)) The remarkable coincidence between traditions known to the Romans and the Volci legend appears in the old account unearthed by the antiquarian researches of Claudius. This story agrees in the main with that represented by the Volci painting, except that here Mastarna is not instrumental in bringing about the death of Tarquin. According to Claudius' version of the tradition, which, as he said, came from Etruscan sources, Servius Tullius was the Roman name adopted by the Etruscan Mastarna, a companion of Caeles Vibenna, who brought the remains of Caeles' army from Etruria after the death of the latter. After having taken possession of the Caelian Hill, which he named for his former leader, he changed his name to Servius Tullius, and by his services finally at- tained to royal power : ((Servius Tullius, si nostros / sequimur, captiva natus Ocresia, si Tuscos, Caeli quondam Vi-/vennae sodalis fidelissimus omnisque eius casus comes post-lquam varia fortuna exactus cum omnibus reliquis Caeliani / exercitus Etruria excessit, montem Caelium occupavit, et a duce suo / Caelio ita appellitatus [sic] mutatoque nomine, nam Tusce Mastarna / ei nomen erat, ita appellatus est ut dixi, et regnum summa cum rei / p(ublicae) utilitate op- tinuit. , 2 The agreement between this tradition and that represented by the tomb paint- ing is striking, but more with regard to situation and participants than to actual events. The same characters appear, and in practically the same relationships. In both Mas- tarna is an Etruscan noble, a friend and follower of Caeles Vibenna. While in the Roman version there is no indication that he was concerned in the death of Tarquinius, it is ' Etruskische Spiegel, V, 166 ff. and pl. 127, discussed by PETERSEN, Jahrbuch, xiv, 1899, 43 ff. The same passage from Festus, if we follow Garrucci's restoration, offers confirmation of the friendship between Vibenna and Mastarna which is attested by the Volci painting, though here the three Etruscans are not enemies but friends of Tarquin. 2 BoISSIER, Inscr. de Lyon, p. 136; C. I. L., XIII. 1668.</page><page sequence="71">EARLY ROMAN TRADITIONS 77 granted that he succeeded Tarquin in the possession of sovereign power after the latter had met his death - according to all Roman tradition - by violence. The Volcentian incident might be an earlier chapter of the same story with no implications as to the sequel; the Roman tradition a later chapter with no reference to previous events. The painting records an episode from the history of Volci, the rescue of a Volcentian hero by his brother and friend Mastarna, and, as a means to the rescue, a victorious attack upon the captors. There is no indication that the death of Tarquin of Rome is par- ticularly important, nor that it will lead to any singular consequences for any of the vic- tors. Mastarna himself, the chief actor, is wholly absorbed in freeing his friend. The sequel, Mastarna's succession to the royal power held by Tarquinilus of Rome, is either not known or not important to the painter who records the Volcentian tradition. The emphasis is on the freeing of Vibenna, who with his brother Aulus must have been a well-known Etruscan hero, since the two appear again in a scene on a mirror. The version presented by Claudius, on the other hand, deals with the same characters in a later stage of the same story, but in connection with events which did not come at all within the scope of the Volci tradition. It records Mastarna's subsequent career in Rome and is inconsistent with the other account only in the matter of time; for if Mastarna's exploit of freeing his comrade resulted in the death of Vibenna's captor, Tarquin, the ensuing state of affairs suggests an immediate succession to the sovereign power. The train of events is logical, however, and the discrepancy shows no more than the usual inconsistency of tradition as regards details. The succession of events pieced out from the two versions is, moreover, in the main consistent with the generally accepted Roman account. There is some support in this for the suggestion contained in the Etruscan version (in both the Volci painting and in Claudius' legend) that the overthrower of Tarquin succeeded him as ruler. In Roman tradition, though Servius appears as the friend and not the adversary of Tarquin, he is nevertheless not the lawful successor. He is an Etruscan 2 of obscure birth who has made himself so indispensable to the city that he is able to assume the royal power in place of the legal heirs. There is reason enough for Caeles' continuance in Roman tradition, though his sub- sequently more important companion completely disappeared from the familiar body of legends. The explanation lies in Caeles' connection with the name of the Caelian Hill, while Mastarna 's name was entirely swallowed up in his later incarnation as the famous Servius Tullius. It is not, unlikely, moreover, that the Etruscan Mastarna might have changed his name to the Roman "&lt;Servius Tullius; ) for, as Korte points out (op. cit., 75), ' See GRENIER, The Roman Spirit, Ch. III, for a discussion of the parallel traditions. 2 POMP. TROGUS, xxxviii, 6, 7, gives his origin fromn an Etruscan slave: (("serVos Vernasque Tuscorum )); Livy, ;, 39, 1, 3, does not specifically state that he was Etruscan by birth, though he was born and brought up in the household of the Etruscan Tarquin.</page><page sequence="72">78 INEZ G. SCOTT the Etruscan Tarquin of Rome appears in the Volci painting with a Roman praenomen, Gnaeus, in an Etruscan transliteration Cneve. I It has been argued 2 that the Tarquins who ruled in Rome were themselves not Etruscan, and that the Etruscan usurpation of power came with Servius Tullius. The praenomen, whether we accept Gnaeus or Lucius, is Roman, and the connection with Tarquinii has been cast aside as merely an etymological myth. 3 Korte further claims that the nomen is not connected with the name TarZnas occurring at Caere and Tar- quinii. It is true that the Etruscanized form which appears in the Volci painting is Taryu (or Tarzunies) instead of TarZnas, and that in the TarZnas tomb at Caere a Latinized form (( Tarcna)) occurs. 4 On the other hand, the form (( Tarquin(os))) occurs once in the same tomb, and on a cippus outside appears the related form (( Tarquitius. )) 5 Another variation, Tarnas, occurs in Volsinii and in Volci. 6 Whether or not Tarquinius is exactly the Romanized form of TarZnas, it is unquestionably a closely related form. TarZnas, Tarnas, and Tarzu (or Tarzunies) must be variations of the same name, as are Tarquinius and Tarquitius. If the Tarquins of Rome did not belong to the TarZnas family at Caere, and it is by no means certain that they did not, they are not for that reason proved to be non-Etruscan; the name is still Etruscan, and closely related to if not identical with TarZnas. The name Tanaquil also is not Latin, but occurs occasionally in Etruria. 7 The fact that the Tarquins of Rome carried on wars with the cities of Etruria is no valid argument against their Etruscan origin, 8 for it is quite possible, from what is known of the relations among Etruscan cities, that one Etruscan prince should have dis- placed another in defiance of any right of succession, and that both should have carried on campaigns against Etruscan cities. While there is evidence at an early period of alliances of certain cities, 9 there seems to have been no general federation until a later 1 It is not attested as an Etruscan name; SCHULZE, op. cit., 263, lists it among those borrowed by the Etruscans from their neighbors. It occurs in the form Cnei in an inscription from Arezzo (FABRETTI, C. I. I., 469), where it unquestionably belongs to a non-Etruscan. MiULLER, Etrusker, 474, identifies the name with that of a Cn. Aufidius Orestes, cos. in 71 B. C. Cneve occurs occa- sionally as a family name (FABRETTI, Gloss. Ital., p. 879), and as a praenomen (FABRETTI, C. I. I., 1660-1; Cneve Larcna: Gnaevius Larcanius). The name is, as a matter of fact, not authentic, accord- ing to Roman tradition, as the name of either of the Tar- quins. It is however, a Roman name, ascribed by the Etruscan tradition to the Tarquin of Rome who appears with Etruscan companions. 2 DE SANCTIS, Storia dei Romani, 1, 371-2; cf.

Ist., 1847, 55 ff. ; CORSSEN, Etr., II, 572. This form occurs twice on the walls of the tomb, once on a cippus outside: FABR., 2363, 2388, 2391. 5 Tarquin(os) occurs once in the tomb, (Fabr. 2356); Tarquitius (Fabr. 2390 : ...... rquiti C. f.). 6 At Volsinii, GAMURRINI, App. al C.

XIII, 6; also FABR., 2327 ter B. 8 This argument, if valid, would hold for Servius Tullius as well, and would deny all Etruscan domination in Rome. There are records of Servius' campaigns against the Etruscans as well as Tarquin's: Liv., 1, 42, 2 f.; DION., iv, 27; Fasti Triumphales, C. I. L., I, P. 453. 9 DIONYSIUS, iii, 51, 14, records an alliance of Clusium, Arretium, Rusellae, Vetulonia and Volaterrae, for the purpose of aiding the L.atins against Tarquinius Priscus.</page><page sequence="73">EARLY ROMAN TRADITIONS 79 time. There is, for instance, a record of the sending of supplies by the cities of northern Etruria to further Rome in her struggle with Veii. 2 It is worth noting, too, that in the Volci painting the names of the enemies of the Volcentian heroes are also Etruscan; VenOi and Pesna are attested elsewhere as Etruscan names, Velznaz is probably Volsinii, SvetimaZ is possibly Sutrium. 3 In every way there seems to have been little unity among the different parts of Etruria,4 and it is quite within the limits of probability that an Etruscan from Volci should have come to Rome and displaced the reigning Etruscan princes who had themselves come from Tarquinii. It is significant that in the Volci painting the companions of Tarquin are Etruscans, and all from different places in Etruria. For Roman tradition represents Tarquin as gathering about him workmen and artists from all parts of Etruria to carry out his schemes for improving the city; and he would in all probability have had a certain number of Etruscan military aids as well. The Etruscan overlords who everywhere took possession of cities which were in population fundamentally Italic, as Falerii and Veii always were, must have used to a greater extent the same methods which the Etruscan kings employed at Rome: they must have maintained, with the support of comparatively few Etruscan followers, a political sovereignty over a larger population of native people. As they were superior in culture, the resulting civilization in places where the ruling people kept their hold was largely Etruscan in character, while even in Rome there remained numerous traces of the impression made by an Etruscan dominance of comparatively short duration. The methods attributed to Tarquin are exactly those which the Etruscans ap- parently used elsewhere, and it is much more probable that he was an Etruscan prince who had gained the sovereignty in Rome than that he was, as Korte suggests, a Roman counterpart of a Greek tyrant, who held his power by the aid of mercenaries from Etruria. The tradition of his Etruscan origin is so well borne out by all the circumstances told of his policies and his undertakings, and by the attested facts and the date of the appear- ance of Etruscan influence in Rome, that it is hardly reasonable to discard it on the grounds of his waging wars against Etruscan cities or the inability to identify his name with the Tarznas of Etruscan inscriptions. The Volci tomb-painting as a piece of independent evidence goes far to establish the historicity of a number of names well-known in Roman tradition. While it deals only with an incident which does not come into Roman tradition at all, this very lack of a consistent agreement gives it value as an independent Etruscan tradition corroborating the Roman. This lack of identity with the version of the tradition of Mastarna as presented 1 Cf. L. R. TAYLOR, Local Cults of Etruria, 14.

SCOTT by Claudius lessens the possibility of any contamination from the Volci tradition, as the early date of the painting precluded contamination in the other direction. The less actual correspondence there is, the less likely it is that Claudius on the basis of the Volci tradition invented the claim of identity between Mastarna and Servius Tullius. De Sanctis' argument (Klio, ii, 1902, 100-101) that Claudius' version is his own misinter- pretation of the Volci legend lacks basis in any definite agreement of events between the two. If Claudius had invented the identity from the Volci story, there would almost certainly be some mention of Mastarna's connection with the death of Tarquin. His account of Mastarna not only mentions no connection, l but allows some time to elapse between Mastarna's coming to Rome and his succession to the royal power. If we assume that the story of Mastarna as presented by Claudius is independent of the Volci painting, the discrepancy is natural enough, and merely shows the usual inconsistency of tradition. But it is unnatural to a deliberately invented story, too unnatural to allow the claim that Claudius' version is an invention based on the Volci tradition. 2 While the minor discrepancies practically establish the independence of the two traditions, they in no way destroy the value of the painting as evidence for the historical existence of the Etruscan leaders named Vibenna and of the Tarquins, and for the truth of the traditional account of the latter's displacement by another Etruscan usurper. We could ask for no clearer proof of the authenticity of the tradition, which has ordinarily been accepted as a general statement of the situation, but often cast aside as wholly unreliable in details. The inscriptional evidence of the Volci tomb-painting seems to present the Tarquins as historical figures and not as mere legendary heroes. Whatever the reasons for accepting or rejecting the existence of the earlier kings, in dealing with the Etruscan rulers we are on ground that is much more definitely historical. Along with the one bit of in- scriptional evidence which attests the historical reality of the Tarquins as rulers of Rome, several sources combine to declare the essential truth of the traditional picture of the city under the Etruscan rulers. Livy's account of the Tarquins and their activities is corroborated by what can be deduced from the earliest Roman monuments, and a few important remains from the period give evidence of the great ambitions which tradition ascribes to the Tarquins and Servius Tullius. Extensive remains of foundations and architectural decoration testif to the remarkable number of buildings constructed during the period. Less satisfying in abundance but no less significanlt is the evidence for the fortification of the city undertaken and executed by Servius Tullius. Servius was the 1 This of course might be deliberate, because a rep- resentation of Servius Tullius as the overthrower of Tarquin was not in keeping with the Roman ideas of Servius and his reign. 2 The only possible grounds for Claudius' claim of the identity of Servius Tullius with Mastarna must have been either an Etruscan tradition vouching specif- ically for the identity of the two, or a tradition that the Etruscan Mastarna became king in Rome.</page><page sequence="75">EARLY ROMAN TRADITIONS 81 first, according to all accounts, to undertake any extensive work for defending the city. There were, it is true, traditions of a fortification of the Palatine by Romulus and of the amurus terreus carinarum, ,, 2 which implied the existence of defences of some sort at a date earlier than the union of the separate communities. The phrase amurus terreus") itself, however, suggests the primitive nature of whatever fortifications there may have been at that early date. The Servian wall, completed near the end of the 6th century, was undoubtedly the first wall in any real sense of the term. Livy records the traditional belief concerning the extent of the city enclosed by the wall of Servius, while we owe to Dionysius the description of the wall and the agger supporting it. According to Livy, i, 43, 13, Servius in his organisation of the city estab- lished four regions, which included the older part of the city (the Septimontium), and in addition a larger portion of the Esquiline, the Quirinal, and the Viminal. He extended the pomerium to enclose the newly added districts, and surrounded the four regions and the Capitoline with a wall. ((Quadrifariam enim urbe divisa regionibus collibusque qui habitabantur ); and (i, 44, 3): (( ad eam multitudinem urbs quoque amplificanda visa est. addit duos colles, Quirinalem Viminalemque; inde deinceps auget Esquilias.... aggere et fossis et muro circumdat urbem; ita pomerium profert..) For the greater part of the distance the wall could follow the natural line of the hills, I but where it crossed the plateau between the Quirinal and Esquiline it was strengthened by an agger of earth and a moat. According to Dionysius' description the agger supporting the wall was 7 stades long and 50 feet broad, the moat was 100 feet wide and more than 30 feet deep (Dion., ix, 68, 3 f.): Tcicpos rcs rap &amp;pa6p wrat rpo aidrou rri&amp;a's g cLXotcZraY ps&amp;gov c(CTV TOXV xN &amp;aosirv uuT rptaxovt&amp;qrouv.

From all evidence the original enceinte did not include the Aventine, which was so distinctly separate from the other hills that its inclusion would have been inadvisable from the point of view of defense. The Aventine was not in any of the four regions, and, though LivY (i, 33, 1-2) mentions the people of Politorium as settled on this hill, it was never considered as part of the city. Not until imperial times was it included within the pomerium. 4 Except that it excluded the Aventine, the wall of the 6th cen- tury might (so far as ancient references are concerned) have followed almost exactly the line of the later so-called Servian wall of which large sections can still be traced. 1 DION., II, 65, 3. 2 VARRO, L. L., v, 48. 3 DION., iX, 68; Cic., de Rep., ii, 6 (1 1): cuius (scil. urbis) is est tractus ductusque muri cum Romuli, tum etiam reliquorum regum sapienfia definitus ex omni parte arduis praeruptisque montibus, ut unus aditus, qui esset inter Esquilinum Quirinalemque montem, maximo aggere obiecto fossa cingeretur vastissima. 4 Temples to foreign divinities were allowed on the Aventine but not in the city itself; they were thus outside the religious boundaries of the city. The Aventine was finally included within the pomerium by the Emperor Claudius. (MESSALA, ap. AUL. GELL., xiii, 14). I1</page><page sequence="76">82 INEZ G. SCOTT Until quite recently the existence of a city wall as early as the 6th century was a matter of dispute. Arguments against such a wall as Servius is said to have built were based on the finding of 4th century burials within the line of the wall, ' upon the known fact that in 390 B. C. the Gauls took possession of the city with remarkable ease, -too easily, it was claimed, to allow the belief that Rome was a fortified city, and most of all upon a generally prevailing opinion that the traditional tales of the power of early Rome were much exaggerated and in any case anachronistic. That skepticism is being continually undermined by further knowledge of the actual conditions in Latium in the 6th century. Fragmentary but significant remains 2 prove the latter part of the 6th century to have been a period of remarkable progress, during which a comparatively high degree of Etruscan culture flourished at Rome and at other sites in Latium. The fact that other cities of that time in Etruria and even in Latium were provided with fortifications increases the probability of a 6th century city wall at Rome. The custom of building encircling walls was prevalent in Etruscan cities. Tarquinii and Veii and other Etruscan towns were strongly fortified, and it is most unlikely that Rome would have remained unwalled during her long struggle with Veii. Rome's fortunes in the war with Veii and her final success almost necessitate assuming that she was not far behind her powerful enemy with regard to defences. Rome's colony, Signia, was provided with a wall apparently from its founding in 495 B. C. (Livy, ii, 21, 7), and it becomes inconceivable that Rome herself should have been unfortified. It might be maintained that the fortifications previous to the Gallic fire were of the primitive sort which existed at Ardea and at several sites in the Faliscan territory, merely a parapet of earth and stones to strengthen the defense afforded by the slopes of the hills. 3 It is generally agreed, however, that stone construction was known in Rome as early as the end of the 6th century, and it is unlikely that the Romans would have been content with such a primitive method of defense at a time when they were using isodomic masonry in other structures. It is now generally recognized that the earliest Roman monuments, those assigned to the period before the Gallic fire, show traces of a quite different type of construction than that common in the monuments of the fourth century and later. 4 The material, apparently the only stone in use before the 4th century, is the flaky gray tufa known as cappellaccio, which was quarried in Rome itself and therefore easily accessible. The blocks ordinarily measure from 27 to 30 cm. in height, about half the height of the blocks of harder tufa common in later buildings. This type of construction is one of the criteria for dating monuments in the period before the Gallic fire, though the same stone, still 1 See PINZA, Mon. Ant., xv, 746 ff. and B. C., xl, 1912, 85. 2 See Chapter V. 3 Ch. III, pp. 66 Wf. 4 See FRANK, Roman Buildings of the Republic, 6, 18.</page><page sequence="77">EARLY ROMAN TRADITIONS 83 cut in small blocks probably because of its flakiness, also occurs in certain monuments where the workmanship indicates a later date. 1 While large portions of the so-called Servian wall are constructed of the yellowish tufa which came into use in the 4th century, there are certain fragments of the wall in which the earlier material is used. These deserve particular attention. A small bit of wall at the northwest corner of the Palatine is generally believed to have belonged to the enceinte of the 6th century. 2 It is of crude construction, the blocks badly joined and uneven, with no use of anathyrosis. While it is well up on the slope of the Palatine and might of course have belonged to a special fortification of that hill, it is also in the correct line for a wall enclosing the Servian city. For the wall of Servius must have run from the Tiber across the valley of the Velabrum to the southwest corner of the Palatine, and then followed the southern slope of the hill until it crossed the slight valley between the Palatine and the Caelian. The fragment still existing at the corner of the Palatine would have been just at the point where the wall turned from the valley of the Velabrum to follow the slope of the hill. There is a record of the finding of another fragment which may have belonged to this 6th century wall connecting the Palatine with the Tiber. About 40 meters south of Santa Maria in Cosmedin, Lanciani 3 discovered an arch constructed apparently of cap- pellaccio, and between this and the corner of the hill massive fragments of a wall of the same stone. As the arch was blocked up by masonry of reticulate work of late republican or early imperial times, it could not have been the Porta Trigemina, 4 which was still in use at a later period. 5 But it might very well have been a gate in the earlier wall. 6 There would then be an explanation for its having been abandoned at an early period, for with the inclusion of the Aventine within the fortifications this section of the old wall ceased to be part of the enceinte. It seems probable, therefore, though the arch and wall discovered in the Velabrum have now disappeared, that these fragments, as well as that still remaining at the corner of the Palatine, attest the existence of an earlier fortification which excluded the Aventine. The most extensive remains of walls constructed of the small blocks of cappellaccio are in the Via delle Finanze 7 on the Quirinal and in the Piazza dei Cinquecento 8 on the Viminal. The portion in the Via delle Finanze was part of the outside wall which followed the northwest slope of the Quirinal; that in the Piazza dei Cinquecento belonged to the 1 Ibid., p. 18. 2 Ibid., pp. 92-3, fig. 13.

Both these fragments are of cappellaccio, the material used in the earliest period, and have been assigned to. the original building of the wall. But the technique of construction places them almost certainly in a more advanced age. The blocks are well cut and closely fitted together, with marked use of anathyrosis, and there is a slight battering back of the courses, which gives a better surface. Anathyrosis was known as early as the 6th century, as is proved by its use in the early cistern on the Pal- atine. I But though it was employed in constructing a cistern, where close fitting was the essential feature, there are no traces of its use elsewhere in early buildings. The corner of the Capitoline podium, 2 which is very crudely constructed, cannot be used as evidence for the workmanship of the period, because all that remains was probably underground. 3 The few courses still preserved in the west wall of the podium of the temple of Castor, ' are unevenly cut and badly joined, with no trace of anathyrosis. The same is true of the fragment of the city wall at the corner of the Palatine, where apparently the outer face is preserved. 5 Anathyrosis was commonly used in the 4th century, however, as in the 4th century walls on the Palatine, and in walls of that period at Ostia. 6 An explanation of this use, in the 4th century, of the stone which had then been largely discarded for a stronger tufa has been suggested by Frank (Roman Buildings of the Re- public, 118). The more easily obtainable stone, quarried in Rome itself, was considered strong enough for the inner retaining wall of the agger, while the Grotta Oscura tufa, brought from several miles up the river, was used for the outer protecting wall. The section in the Via delle Finanze was part of the outer wall, but in an unimportant place, where the slope of the hill made it comparatively unexposed to attack. Some distance within the line of the section in the Via delle Finanze there were found a few traces of another cappellaccio wall, a little higher up on the slope of the hill. 7 This may have been the earlier line of the wall, though nothing definite can be argued from a few small fragments which have now wholly disappeared. It is possible, certainly, that the 4th century wall varied slightly from the earlier line of fortifications, and that these few fragments represent what is left of the 6th century wall on the Quirinal. Since the existing cappellaccio portions on the Quirinal and Viminal in their present state probably do not date from the original building of the 6th century, we must seek ' See FRANK, Roman Buildings, 101. 2 See Ch. V, p. 99. 3 JORDAN, I, ii, p. 69, calculated the height of the podium as approximately 5 meters (see ch. V, p. 103). The parallel wall which supported the first row of col- umns from the east rises between four and five meters above the top of the exposed southeast corner. What remains of the corner therefore must have been practi- cally all below the ground level. 4 See FRANK, Memoirs of the American Academy in Rome, v, 1925, 82. 5 There is no unevenness of the surface, which would otherwise necessarily appear, because of the ((header and stretcher)) method of laying the blocks. 6 FRANK, Roman Buildings of the Republic, 117. 7 N.

Though we have no certain early remains in this region to locate the wall, ' the probability is that the 6th century city extended practically to the line of the later wall, with perhaps cer- tain minor variations, as an instance of which may be taken the parallel stretches at the Via delle Finanze. It is certain that the wall followed the slopes of the Palatine and the Caelian at the south and southeast, and that the enceinte included at least the spurs of the Esquiline, the Viminal, the Quirinal, and the Capitoline. 2 If it included no more than this, it might have as a possible boundary the line defined by the chapels of the Argei, which has often been claimed as the boundary of the four Servian regions. 3 If this claim is correct, the 6th century city, besides excluding the Aventine, must have included an appreciably smaller territory on the Quirinal, Viminal, and Esquiline than did Rome of the 4th century. It is at least worth while to examine the evidence, both traditional and archaeological, in search of any support for the hypothesis that the city fortified by Servius lay within the line of the chapels. It is unnecessary to quote the passage from Varro which has ordinarily been interpreted as fixing the limits of the four regions of Servius. 4 The boundaries so outlined include all the hills except the Aventine, but exclude much of the plateau of the Esquiline and the northern end of the Quirinal enclosed within the later wall. If in reality the chapels fix the boundary of the four regions, it is almost necessary to believe that the early wall followed the same line. For the obvious interpretation of the passage in L;vy (i, 439 13 ; 44, 3-4) concerning the organization of the city is that Servius divided the city into four regions, built a wall enclosing these four regions and the Capitoline, 5 and extended the pomerium to the limits of the city thus established. Any description of the extent of the four regions, therefore, must describe also the line of the 6th century wall. But the sole literary evidence for accepting the line of the chapels as the boundary of the four regions rests on an uncertain interpretation of the passage from Varro. He mentions the four Servian regions, names and describes them, and then proceeds to locate the sacella Argeorum of each region. There is nothing to indicate that the procession from chapel to chapel marked the line of the pomerium or the boundary of the Servian regions; indeed, Varro makes no mention of the procession at all, or of anything concerning boundaries. He names the chapels of each region merely to show the general location of the territory included in the different regions of the old city. The so-called boundary of the four regions rests on an assumption which is quite unjustified by the text, and we have no 1 Except of course at the southern part of the city, where we know the line to have differed from the later enceinte in excluding the Aventine. 2 This territory was all included in the city in the preceding period, as is shown by the Calendar of Numa.

SCOTT evidence from ancient literature that the limits of the regions of Servius may not have coincided at most points with the fourth century wall. As will be shown presently, the second source of evidence also fails to prove any difference in extent between the city fortified by Servius and that enclosed in the wall of the later period. Again the early necropolis furnishes evidence, though in the present case purely negative, concerning the growth of the early city. In a somewhat general way the early burials in the Forum and on the hills of Rome reflect the process of growth from scattered settlements to a unified city. The cessation of interments in the Forum fixes the date at which Rome was becoming a city instead of a group of isolated communities, and the Romans were beginning to use as a common market-place the valley which had been the burial ground of the Palatine and Esquiline settlements. On the Esquiline the varying dates of the burials in different localities approxi- mately reflect the advance of the city's boundaries. The earliest graves are more often nearer the spurs of the hill, where the earliest communities undoubtedly were. The largest group of early tombs is in the Via Giovanni Lanza, I well inside the limits of the later city. Farther out on the plateau the graves are more often of later date, containing imported objects, metal, amber, glass, and painted pottery, such as were common in the latest group in the Forum. The burials of the 4th century and later, those containing Etrusco-Campanian ware2 and those protected by slabs of ((peperino,)) are usually outside the limits of the city, in the region of the Piazza Vittorio Eman- uele. The location of the burials of the successive periods, therefore, approximately establishes the advance of the city's boundaries, agreeing in the main with the traditions concerning the development of the city. That this is true is due to the practice, which existed from earliest times, of burying the dead outside the inhabited region, ordinarily in some place not far from the limits of the community. This custom we find observed at almost all the sites of primitive Italic villages, 3 and in the first written code of laws burial within the city is distinctly forbidden: (( Hominem mortuum in urbe neve sepelito neve urito )), BRUNS, Fontes Iuris, 6 p. 35, Table X, 1). The law may have been first introduced along with the Etruscan institution of the pomerium, which fixed a formal boundary for the city. But though the custom may have become a law only after the establishment of a religious and legal boundary line, burial outside the inhabited region was a widespread primitive practice, common to both the Italic peoples and the Etruscans. Because of the known custom regarding burials, the occurrence of a few 4th century tombs within the limits of the Servian city has been used as an argument against the exis- 1 Pinza's numbers I-L, in Mon.

The fossa grave at the southwest corner of the Palatine, once thought to be of the 4th century, is probably much earlier. 2 The block of tufa covering the tomb was undoubtedly placed there at a later date, when the grave was dis- turbed in the process of building the wall which partially covers it. Since the contents were disturbed and replaced, the one Etrusco-Campanian vase is no indication of the original date of the burial. There was little else in the tomb by which it might have been dated, but, according to Vaglieri's report, 3 in the earth filling the fossa were fragments of pottery of a period earlier than the seventh century. There is no further evidence of burials on the Palatine, and it is likely that the necropolis which Vaglieri believed that he had found never existed. Other fragments of pottery discovered in the same locality l were in no case found in tombs, and merely prove the existence of an early settlement on the Palatine. The one fossa grave, though earlier than the fourth century, must have been a special burial, for this section of the Palatine was certainly the earliest inhabited district of that hill if not of all Rome. Other late burials offer greater difficulties in the way of determining the extent of the early city. There are five as late as the 4th century on the Esquiline within the line of the wall. The most notable is the fossa tomb LXI (see Pinza's plan, reproduced in our pl. VI) in the Via Giovanni Lanza, very near to the spurs of the Esquiline and in the same locality as the earliest group of Esquiline burials. The grave contained a cup of Etrusco-Campanian ware, probably of the type published in Bull. Com., xl, 1912, p. 81, fig. 24, and common in the 4th and 3rd centuries. Tomb LII, somewhat farther out than the one just mentioned but still among the group of earliest burials, may perhaps be listed with those of later date. It contained a small sarcophagus of opeperino, )" with no burial accessories except a terra-cotta spinning- whorl. 5 If Pinza is correct in calling the material opeperino,)) the tomb is undoubtedly late. 6 But in early reports there is a very general confusion between peperino and cappellaccio, sometimes betrayed by the description of opeperino&gt; as a flaky gray tufa, which we easily recognize as the earlier stone. In the present case the earlier report (M. 1082) describes the sarcophagus as a ocassa tufacea rettangolare, )) and the pho- 1 See PINZA, in Mon. Ant., xv, 746 ff.; Bull. Comm., xl, 1912, 84 ff.; cf.

Prof. Frank believes the grave to be outside the line of the 6th century cappellaccio wall, and therefore outside the limits of the earliest community. 3 N. S., 1907, 190. 4N. S., 1907, 197 ff. 5Mon.

Some tombs reported as containing sarcophagi of ((peperino, )) though the stone may have been really cappellaccio, were proved late by the presence of Etrusco-Campanian ware, e. g., CXXXVI, CXL, CXLI, CXLV, and perhaps CXLIV. In the case of those which contained no material of later date, e. g., CXXXI, CXLIII, CXLVIII, CLX-CLXII, we may suppose that the sarcophagi were of cappellaccio and probably of the 6th century or earlier. The stone prevailingly used in the early period was cappellaccio, for all other structures as well as for tombs; peperino was not known until a much later period.</page><page sequence="82">88 INEZ G. SCOTT tograph (Mon. Ant., xv, fig. 51) shows it to be roughly cut and of a surface that closely resembles cappellaccio, quite different from the later ocasse) of opietra gabina)" which contained remains of charred bones (as in Tombs CXIX-CXX). We know, however, of no example of so small a sarcophagus (80 cm. X 40 cm. X 22 cm.) in any of the ear- lier burials. There is no indication in the report of the finding of ashes in the ((cassa,) but the small size of the sarcophagus seems to place Tomb LII with the late group of cremation burials in which rectangular urns were employed. In the case of three fossa graves in the Via Merulana (CXXVI 1- IX), which are at some distance within the line of the wall, the mention of (( casse di peperino )) need not necessarily be considered as an indication of late date. While the report of the contents is probably not complete, there was nothing to indicate a date later than the building of the 6th century wall. 1 The only other late burials within the boundaries of the 4th century city are in the Piazza Magnanapoli, just within the line of the wall joining the Quirinal to the Capito- line. The much-discussed camera tomb CLXX is so close to the line that its entrance was blocked up by the 4th century wall. Among the contents are reported two vases of Etrusco-Campanian ware ((( a vernice nero )) and three terra-cotta arule ornamented with relief. Since the vases seem to have been found in the earth blocking the entrance in- stead of in the tomb itself, they cannot testify to the original date. It is difficult to date the appearance of the ((camera)) type of tomb in Rome because so few exam- ples have been discovered. Two which were found on the Esquiline outside the wall (CXXV and CXXVI) both contained material of the 4th and 3rd centuries, in one case also some earlier vases of proto-Corinthian and black-figured ware. Camera tombs dis- covered on Monte Mario were of the 6th century, 2 and these too may have been built as early as the 6th century and continued in use until a later period. The original date of the camera tomb of the Piazza Magnanapoli must apparently remain uncertain, but there is no proof that it may not have been built before the construction of the wall. In the same region, still higher on the slope and farther inside the line of the wall, were found three tombs which are probably of late date. Pinza reports the finding of at least one sarcophagus of anenfro )) or ((peperino, but in the earlier records the material is vaguely described as (( pietra simile alla gabina )) (Bull. Comm., iv, 1876, 123), and as (( nenfro )) (N. S., 1876, 185). The contents, however, date the burials probably as late as the 4th century: there were found a pin of bone, some fragments of laminated gold, one of which 1 Tomb CXXXVII contained an impasto vase, frag- ments of bronze, a necklace, and a spinning-whorl; CXXXVIII-IX contained two fibulae and fragments of pottery. The report is probably not complete. A tomb found at the angle between the Via dello Statuto and the Via Merulana may perhaps belong in the group of late burials within the line of the wall. The lining of the tomb was made of squared blocks of tufa, arranged in a sort of false vault. See Bull. Comm., xl, 1912, 38-9, fig. 14. 2 See p. 69, footnote 1 of this chapter.</page><page sequence="83">EARLY ROMAN TRADITIONS 89 was fashioned in the form of a leaf, and a balsamario of alabaster. In one of the tombs, although outside the sarcophagus itself, was found a late black-figured Attic amphora. ' Probably none of the four tombs in the Piazza Magnanapoli are earlier than the original building of the wall. Von Duhn supposes that these burials belonged to a group of tombs placed just outside the gate of the 4th century wall. 2 Graffunder suggests that they may not have been within the line of the earlier wall, which was perhaps higher on the slope. 3 But if Pinza's location of the tombs is correct (see plan reproduced in pl. V, fig. 5) it is difficult to see how any wall which enclosed the Quirinal and the Capitoline could have excluded the burials in front of the church of S.ta Caterina. To include both hills the line must have been practically that of the later wall which blocked the entrance of Tomb CLXX, and must in any case have enclosed the three which are still higher on the slope. It is impossible to draw a line for the 6th century wall which will not include some burials of a later date than the building of the wall itself. Literary evidence demands the inclusion in the 6th century city of all the later hills except the Aventine, and Varro's location of the chapels of the Argei, including only the spurs of the Esquiline and the southern part of the Quirinal, gives the smallest possible extent of the city. As has been stated, there is no reason for supposing that the chapels marked the boundary line of the Servian regions, and Roman tradition offers no proof that the city of Servius was appre- ciably smaller (except for the exclusion of the Aventine) than the 4th century city. If, however, we could draw a line for the earlier wall which would include the required territory and yet exclude all the late burials, there would be a motive even in the absence of any traditional authority for assuming a smaller boundary. But to accept for the moment the supposed ((four region )) line, the narrowest possible limits which satisfy all requirements, its boundary still encloses the latest of the graves, Tomb LXI, probably also Tomb LII, and almost certainly the three tombs in front of S.ta Caterina, if not also the camera tomb CLXX. None of the late burials within the wall, except perhaps the one camera tomb, could lie outside any possible line of an earlier city wall. The location of these offers no argument for assuming the wall of Servius to have followed a line different from that of the wall built after the Gallic fire. As no possible line can be drawn which would exclude all the late burials, we must deny the existence of a wall in the 6th century, or admit that there were some intramural burials. The second alternative is the more reasonable: not only are the general probabilities strongly in favor of the existence of fortifications earlier than the fourth century, but we have specific authority for the admission of some burials within the city. In spite of the prohibition in the twelve tables, there are a number of ancient references to 'Mon. Ant., xv, Tombs CLXXI-III, fig. 105. 2 VON DUHN, op. cit., 1, 486 f. 3Klio, xi, 1911, 119. 12</page><page sequence="84">90 INEZ G. SCOTT exceptional interments within the city. Cicero (De Leg., ii, 58) mentions the right of burial within the city as a special honor granted to a few most famous citizens: ((Quid, qui post XII in urbe sepulti sunt clari viri?.... )) Plutarch (Publicola, 23, 3) states that Publicola was honored with the privilege of burial near the Velia for himself and all his family, and according to Suetonius (Tiberius, I), the graves of the Claudii were at the foot of the Capitoline. There is also a statement of Servius that the Vestals were buried within the city (Aeneid, xi, 206) : (( imperatores et virgines Vestae quia legibus non tenentur, in civitate habent sepulchra.)) A further remark of Servius (Aen., vi, 152; cf. v, 64), while not cor- rect as to the general custom, implies that interments within the city were more frequent than has been assumed: ((apud maiores omnes in domibus suis sepeliebantur.)) The fact that the law against intramural burials was renewed in the consulship of C. Duellius I shows that there had been some violation of it, apart from the special exceptions made legally. 2 With so much evidence for exceptions and infringements of the law it is unnecessary to doubt the existence of a wall in the 6th century because of a few late burials within the boundaries of the city. The few certain cases of 4th century burials, which in the last analysis are only Tombs LXI, LII, and the few graves near S.ta Cate- rina, are not too many to be dismissed as legally made exceptions or violations of the law. A few tombs and some fragments of pottery directly beneath the ((Servian") wall give a terminus post quem for the original building of a wall. None of the objects found there are later than the 6th century. At the northernmost point of the enceinte there were three fossa graves directly under the wall, two of which (CLXV and CLXVI) con- tained sarcophagi of terra-cotta moulded in the form of the hollow oak-trunk sarcophagi occurring in the Forum. While these may be slightly later than the crude oak sarcophagi of the Forum, their contents are very similar to those of the latest Forum burials. 3 They must be dated, therefore, in the same period, considerably earlier than 600 B. C., and long before the first building of the wall. Under and just inside the wall in the Via delle Finanze were found various fragments of crude pottery decorated with incised patterns, some in a single tomb and some scattered in the earth. 4 Only one grave was actually found, though others may of course have been destroyed in the construction of the wall. The one object of later date was a small bucchero vase of a type common in 4th century burials, but this probably did not come from the tomb. It is significant that just here there were fragments of a cap pellaccio wall some distance within the line of the later wall. But at no point of the enceinte, except possibly here where there are further 1 SERvius, Aen., XI, 206: ((quod postea Duellio consule senatus prohibuit et lege cavit, ne quis in urbe sepeliretur.)) A K. Duilius was consul in 336 B. C. (FASTI, C. I. L., 1, p. 513). 2 Bull. Ist., 1830, 72 reports an intramural tomb at Tarquinii, and DENNIS, Cities and Cemeteries of Etruria, I, 428 (ed. 1878) states that he has observed some instances of intramural burial at Caere. 3 Cf.

' I have so far cited only negative evidence in favor of the belief that the 6th century wall included practically the same territory on the Esquiline and Quirinal as the later so-called Servian wall. There is no evidence, either literary or archaeological, that the city of Servius, though it excluded the Aventine, was otherwise smaller than the city of the 4th century. There is, moreover, a certain amount of indirect evidence in favor of the larger extent. It is sufficiently clear that after the expulsion of the Etruscans Rome declined considerably from the position of importance which she had held among the towns of Latium at the end of the 6th century. 2 This decrease in power is reflected in the Roman legends themselves, in the stories of Lars Porsenna and his successes against the city, 3 and later, in the seeming lack of resistance to the invasion of the Gauls. It is also apparent in the partial decline in foreign trade during the 5th and 4th centuries, 4 shown by the almost total absence of imported material in entombments of this period. A perusal of Rome's two commercial treaties recorded by Polybius, one concluded just at the end of the Etruscan domination in 509 B. C. and the other more than a century later, distinctly shows a decline in power. In the light of the change in Rome's own fortunes between the 6th and the 4th centuries, it is more likely that a great increase in the size of the city should have been made during the reign of an ambitious Etruscan king than at a time when the Roman state, both frightened and weakened by the destruction inflicted by the Gauls, set to work to restore the fortifications of the city. From all available evidence, therefore, it seems probable that the fortifications built after the Gallic invasion followed essentially the same line as the earlier wall. The one great change was at the southeast, where the wall was extended to enclose the Aventine instead of turning to follow the slope of the Palatine and cross the Velabrum to the Tiber. 1 Bull. Ist., 1875, 132, 231-2, describes some vases found under the wall near the Villa Caserta (near the Castra Praetoria). These objects are described as crude vases of Latial types, and some of obuccaro,)) some of Greek (( Chalcidian )) ware (also called (( Italo-Grei))) which were probably proto-Corinthian. There was nothing which would set the terminus post quem later than the 6th century. See also Bull. Comm., vi, 1878, 64 ff. 2 See pp. 69 f. of this chapter. 3 Certain ancient references imply a real conquest by the Gauls; e. g., PLINY, N. H., xxxiv, 139: ((in foedere quod expulsis regibus populo Romano dedit Porsina, nomi- natim comprehensum invenimus ne ferro nisi in agri cultu uteretur. )) 4 Rome, in common with the rest of Latium, appar- ently lost touch with foreign trade during the 5th and 4th centuries. In contrast with the close relation in 7th century finds between Southern Etruria and Latium, imported ware of the 5th century which appears in great abundance in Etruria and Faliscan territory is almost entirely lacking in Latium. The few finds which furnish our only evidence of things in use at Rome in the 5th and 4th centuries fail to show traces of foreign importation. It is difficult to give a reason for the sharp break between Latium and Etruria during this period. At Rome the explanation might lie in the withdrawal of the Etruscan power and the subsequent struggles with Italic peoples. Whether there was a general retrenching of Etruscan power which resulted in the decline of Etruscan influence in all of Latium, we cannot say. See Bull. Comm., xl, 1912, 24; Boll. Art., iii, 1909, 190; N. S., 1896, 99 ff.; ADAMS, Commerce of Early Latium, 57-8.</page><page sequence="86">92 INEZ G. SCOTT The line may have changed slightly at various points, though the only evidence of such a change occurs at one point on the west slope of the Quirinal, where fragmentary remains perhaps mark the earlier site. While the cappellaccio walls on the Quirinal and at the station are built with a technique too advanced to be attributed to the 6th century, it is possible that they were constructed of material left from the earlier wall. The old wall, which was without doubt partially ruined, ' may have furnished material for the new wall in places where the strength of the stone was not an essential matter. For the inner retaining wall of the agger the strength of the construction was unimportant, and at the west side of the Quirinal the slope of the hill and the distance from a gate made this section sufficiently unexposed to attack to warrant the re-using of what old material happened to be left. The wall here was apparently a patchwork of cappellaccio and of the later Grotta Oscura tufa. The cappellaccio wall was preserved, before the cutting of the modern street through the middle of it, for a distance of about 35 meters. 2 At the southern end it joined a wall of Grotta Oscura tufa, part of which is still preserved in the garden of the Ministry of National Economy. In the line of the wall along the slope of the hill farther to the south there were other cappellaccio remains found between the Barberini gardens and the church of Santa Susanna. Though these are now destroyed, the reports of the excavations 3 describe them as very similar to the wall still preserved in the Via delle Finanze. The battering of the courses is mentioned, and the material, while called ((peperino, )) is described as flaky gray tufa, unmistakably cappellaccio. Lanciani suggests that new yellow tufa was substituted where the old wall was destroyed, and joined to the portions of the old wall which still remained intact. Though he is wrong in assuming that the well-built cappellaccio walls in their present form were parts of the earlier structure, it is possible that the material of the partially ruined old wall was re-used as far as the supply of unbroken blocks lasted, and then new material brought to fill in the remaining space. A diagram 4 which shows the joining of the Grotta Oscura section with the cappellaccio portion at the Via delle Finanze indicates the process of construction. There the larger Grotta Oscura blocks cut into the cappellaccio courses in such a way that they must have been fitted into the cappellaccio courses already laid. Such would have been the method of construction in case the old material was used up first and new stone employed to fill in the remaining space. Perhaps the relatively small size of the cap pellaccio blocks in the walls of both the Via delle Finanze and the Piazza dei Cinquecento may be explained by the fact that they were re-used blocks, refinished to make neat joinings possible, and built into well-constructed walls. In both these walls the blocks vary from 23 to 27 cm. in height, averaging 25 cm., 1 The easy victory of the Gauls suggests that there was no defense at the walls. See GRAFFUNDER, Klio, xi, 1911, 105. 2 Bull. Comm., xxxvii, 1909, 119-12 1. 3 Bull. Comm., xl, 1912, 70-71. 4Bull.

Whether the cappellaccio walls of the Quirinal and Viminal were built of material from the earlier fortifications, or whether they were constructed of cappellaccio merely because this stone was readily accessible and easily worked, cannot be known with any certainty. In either case, however, all the available evidence favors the hypothesis that the pomerium and the wall of Servius included essentially the same portions of the Quirinal, Viminal, and Esquiline as did the so-called Servian wall of the 4th century. If we are correct in supposing the boundaries to have changed very little at the time of the 4th century rebuilding of the walls, Rome under the later kings was in point of size as preeminent among the cities of Latium as her boastful traditions claim in other respects. An estimate made by Dionysius gives the extent of Rome at the time of Ser- vius Tullius as approximately equal to that of Athens. 2 Athens was 60 stadia in circum- ference (slightly more than 6 miles), and the circumference of the (( Servian )) wall is about a mile less. 3 Dionysius may have been estimating the extent of the whole city including the Aventine, all of which was in his day believed to have been enclosed by the wall of Servius. But the inclusion of the Aventine makes not more than one-half mile difference in the circumference. Dionysius elsewhere describes Veii as of about the same extent as Athens; and Veii cannot have been to a noticeable degree larger than Rome. 4 Yet from all ancient refe- rences to the glory and power of Veii we might expect that city to have been much larger than the Rome of Servius Tullius. Dionysius 5 and Livy speak of it as the most powerful and the most wealthy city of Etruria, and according to Livy, v, 24, many of the Romans considered it a better site than Rome itself. With the exception of Veii, no city of that period in either Latium or Etruria was greater in extent than Servian Rome. Caere was enclosed within a wall about 6 km. (3-3/4 miles) in circuit. 6 The powerful city of Tarquinii, the limits of which may be determined by the outline of the hills and by a few remains of walls, was about 5 miles in circumference, 7 practically the same size as Rome. Vetulonia was probably slightly ' FRANK, Roman Buildings of the Republic, 5. 2 DION., iv, 13. 3 PLATNER, Topography, 48, gives the circumference of Athens as 43 stadia, 5-3/8 Roman miles, approximately the circumference of Rome. THUCYDIDES, ii, 13, 7, however, gives 43 stadia as the circumference of the wall which was guarded, while the scholiast adds that the unguarded distance, between the Long Walls and the Phaleric walls, was 17 stadia. The whole circumference is in that case 60 stadia, considerably more than that of Rome. According to the measure of 625 Roman feet or 606 English feet (DAREMBERG-SAGLIO), 60 stadia = 6.88 miles; or, according to the smaller measure of 600 Greek feet, 6.6 miles. The comparison is only approximate, as is shown by the fact that Dionysius compares both Rome and Veii to Athens, though the two former cities differed more than a mile in circumference. 4 DION., ii, 54, 3; DENNIS, op. cit. (ed. 1878), I, 15, estimates the circumference of Veii at about 7 miles. 5 DION., ii, 54, 3; Livy, ii, 50, 2; iv, 58, 10; v, 20, 1; 22, 8. 6 PAULY-WISSOWA, 111, 1282, Caere. I DENNIS, op. cit.

In point of size, therefore, Rome at the end of the 6th century surpassed any city of Latium and equalled any city in Etruria except her powerful enemy, Veii. Only Veii was larger, and all others except Tarquinii, Volaterrae, and Vetulonia were much smaller. It may be that at the first establishment of the Servian regions by no means all the space enclosed within the walls was thickly inhabited, but that most of the population lived on the hills as in the earlier period, while in the valleys were still some uninhabited districts. 8 But certain it is that the Romans under the rule of the Etruscan kings were able to maintain a strongly fortified city, larger than any of the wealthy and powerful cities of Etruria, with the single exception of Veii. The comparison illustrates a fact which is becoming more apparent as we know more of the early city, that the traditional accounts of Rome's glory in the early days are less anachronistic than was once believed, and that Rome of the later regal period held a preeminent position in Latium and was a factor to be reckoned with even by the powerful Etruscan cities. 1 Ibid., II, 265. 2 Ibid., II, 149; plan opp. p. 144. 3 Ibid., I, 438, plan. 4 Ibid., II, 121 ; plan on p. 122.

THE MONUMENTS OF ETRUSCAN ROME. O the last Etruscan king, Tarquin the Proud, tradition ascribes a number of am- bitious plans for the growth and improvement of the city. Tarquinius Superbus was believed to have undertaken the task of draining the Forum by means of the great cloaca, to have constructed the seats of the circus between the Palatine and Aventine, and to have established the chief cult of the state religion, that of the Capitoline Triad, in a temple of unprecedented size and magnificence. Though little remains of these early monuments, there is evidence sufficient to justify to a great extent the traditional account of the achieve- ments of the Etruscan rulers. While the remains of the Cloaca Maxima are all of a period later than the original building by Tarquin, I the existence of a number of buildings in the Forum at the end of the 6th century presupposes some system of drainage. 2 About the earliest construction of the circus nothing is known. But concerning the undertaking to which the traditions ascribe the greatest importance, the building of the Capitoline temple, there is much to be learned from actual remains. The temple of the Capitoline was probably the first in Rome that would accord with the later definition of a temple. It is true that tradition mentions several divinities whose shrines had to be moved to make way for the new temple begun by Tarquinius Priscus. There were the shrines of Jupiter Feretrius dedicated by Romulus, 3 of Fides, 4 of Iuv- entus, 5 and of Terminus, 6 the only one of the old deities who refused to give way, and who was therefore worshipped along with Jupiter in the new edifice. There is mention 1 FRANK, Roman Buildings of the Republic, 19. 2 The sites of the Forum connected with the earliest traditions are all on higher ground; the sacred enclos- ures of Janus and Jupiter Stator, the prison, the Comitium, and even the Regia would not have been in the way of the stream which probably dictated the line of the first stone cloaca. But very early, at any rate before the build- ing of the temple of Castor in almost the lowest part of the Forum, there must have been some other means of drainage than an artificially deepened channel crossing the Forum and carrying the water down through the Velabrum. 3 Livy, i, 10, 6; iv, 20, 3, 5; DIONYSIUS, ii, 34, 4. 4 Livy, i, 21, 4; DION., ii, 75, 3; CICERO, De Off., iii, 104; De Nat.

SCOTT also of the temple of Janus at the foot of the Argiletum, ' and of that of Jupiter Stator vowed by Romulus. 2 But in the case of none of these have we any record of the actual building of a temple, nor, in the case of the shrines on the Capitoline, of the destruction of any buildings to clear the area. This lack of any mention of actual buildings is in sharp contrast with the abundance of details recorded concerning the erection of the Capitoline temple itself. The accounts mention the excavations for the temple, 3 the laying of the foundations, 4 the summoning of artisans from Etruria 5 to carry out the plans of Tarquin, the tyranny of forcing the plebs to labor at the erection of the building. 6 Such omission of details in the earlier tradition might simply indicate scantiness of the records, but in conjunction with evidence from the old rites themselves it more probably means that the idea of a temple as a material ((home)) for a divinity was for the Romans a foreign one which came in with religious influence from Etruria. The old Italic deities were quite imper- sonal, little more than forces of nature to be propitiated; and it is natural that along with the more anthropomorphic conception of the gods which they received through the in- fluence of the Etruscans, the Romans should also have adopted the custom of building temples in which to place the images of the gods. A tradition existed as to the time before the Romans had begun to represent their gods by images. St. Augustine cites Varro as authority for the statement that for 170 years after the foundation of the city the Romans worshipped the gods without asimulacra. ' It has been pointed out that according to the traditional dating, 170 years from the founding of the city bring us exactly to the date when Tarquinius Priscus began the building of the Capitoline temple. 8 There is no statement, it is true, with regard to the existence of temples before that time, but the making of an image of a god and the erection of a building in which to worship that image are such closely allied expressions of an anthropomorphic conception of deity that it is difficult not to associate the two and assume that they were simultaneous. It is significant that even later, when the early Jupiter Feretrius was given a temple in the Capitoline area, that temple contained no simulacrum but only a stone believed to be a thunderbolt. 9 In other words, there existed no traditional representation of Jupiter Feretrius, a divinity of the time before the gods were given human form. Tradition assigns the building of the Capitoline temple chiefly to the last Tarquin, though Tarquinius Priscus had vowed a temple to Jupiter during the Sabine war, and began work for the foundations. 10 But that the work had not progressed far before Tarquin's 1 Livy, i, 19, 2; PLUTARCH, Numa, 20, 1 f. 2 Livy, i, 12, 6. 3 Livy, i, 55, 5-6. 4 Livy, i, 38, 7. 5 Livy, i, 56, 1. 6 Livy, i, 56, 1-2. 7 De Civitate Dei, iv, 31, cf. 21 ff.; WARDE FOWLER, Roman Festivals, p. 234. 8 GIGLIOLI, N.

Tarquinius Superbus too is credited with conceiving a plan for a magnificent temple on the Capitoline, and with laying the foundations for this great structure I.... cum velut posito bello fundamentis templi iaciendis (variant faciendis) aliisque urbanis operibus intentum se esse simularet. The temple was not finally dedicated until after the expulsion of the kings,- according to the best tradition, in 509 B. C., the first year of the Republic. 2 The details which the tradition has preserved concerning the building of the temple are worth noting. In the first place we have Livy's remark (i, 53, 3) about Tarquin 's ambitious plan: (concepit animo eam amplitudinem Iovis templi, quae digna deum homi- numque rege, quae Romano imperio, quae ipsius etiam loci maiestate esset))h; all of which, if it were the only evidence, might be merely an expression of the author's own admiration of the city's glory projected into the time which he is describing. But other details which tradition has preserved also point to the importance attached to the building of this temple. State funds were used to defray the enormous expense of so great a structure, workmen and artists were summoned from Etruria to carry out the ambitious builder's plans, the plebs of Rome were drafted as laborers. 3 Further, we have Livy's statement that the spoils from Pometia which had been expected to suffice for the whole building were scarcely enough for the foundations. 4 Several references to the temple and its decoration indicate the same importance attached to its construction. The artist Vulca of Veii was called to Rome to make the cult image, 5 and the artists of Veii, who were famous throughout Etruria at that time for their skill in making terra-cotta figures, were entrusted with the making of the quadriga which was to adorn the summit of the pediment. 6 Not only from the character of the various references but from the very number of the details which have been recorded, we might expect the Capitoline temple built by Tarquin to have been a magnificent structure, preeminent in its day for size and grandeur. 7 But it is only recently that there has been available evidence from archaeological discoveries, which proves that the ancient traditions concerning the temple were not far from correct. In addition to general references to the size and magnificence of the temple we have more definite descriptions and measurements. Dionysius describes it as built on a high rectangular platform measuring about 200 feet on a side, its length scarcely fifteen feet greater than its width. At the front, which faced east of south, there were three rows of 1 Livy, i, 53, 5. 2 For the date 509 we have as evidence Livy, li, 8, 6-8; vii, 3, 8; POLYBIUS, iiI, 22, 1; PLUTARCH, Poplicola, 14; TACITUS, Hist., iii, 72; VALERIUS MAXIMUS, V, 10, 1. 3Livy, i, 56, 1-2. 4 PLIVY, .

SCOTT columns, at the sides one row, and apparently none at the back. The small difference between length and width (5m. according to Paribeni) agrees within 5m. in a distance of 60m. with the proportions which Vitruvius prescribes for a Tuscan temple; according to Vitruvius' measurements the length and width should be in the proportion of 6 :5. Of the three cellae which Vitruvius considers usual in Tuscan temples, the middle cella occupies 4/10 of the whole width, leaving 3/10 for each of the subordinate cellae or alae: one assumes that these proportions are reckoned from the axis of the wall. The two rows of columns across the front are arranged so that they are in line with the cella walls, with the result that the distance between the two center columns is 1/10 greater than the other intercolumnar distances. Of the whole length of the temple, one half is occu- pied by the cellae, the other half by the two front rows of columns. 2 Dionysius' measurements are very close to those of Vitruvius, 3 except that the latter has described a tripartite temple in its simplest form, while the Capitoline temple had an added row of columns on the front and sides. Though there is no mention of a greater intercolumnar distance at the center, as is prescribed for the Tuscan type of temple, the representations of the Capitoline temple on the coins show such an arrangement of columns. Further, since Vitruvius mentions the Capitoline among his three examples of Tuscan temples in Rome at his time, s it is likely that his description of the type is at least partially based on that temple. Though the simplest form of Tuscan temple as described by Vitruvius must be tetrastyle, the row of columns at each side of the Capitoline temple necessitates the assump- tion that it was hexastyle. It is shown as a Doric hexastyle temple on coins of Petillius Capitolinus, 6 as Corinthian hexastyle on coins of Vespasian 7 and Titus. 8 The evi- dence from coins, however, is npt consistent: the earliest representation of the temple, which must represent the old structure before the restoration of Catulus, 9 shows it as Doric tetrastyle. This variation is, however, no evidence for any enlarging of the temple in the rebuilding of Catulus, since several coins of Domitian 10 as well as the relief in the 1 DION., iv, 61, 3 f.: InooOn 6' xwl ,i76o; p'jYgW flEflnX&amp;S 6'TeTAo0Q TnV nep(o6ov, 6taxoowt)v ao&amp;wv &amp;'y- gam T v n-vQEv EXcov F""'X( FGT'V *? 67 TL TO waAUaCTTOV EVweOt Tl;v aTiS Vir8Q0eo TOi frXovg naiaeT ronaro;, ovo 'Aa)v nrVTExata6Exa roOCov....

The reason for the inaccuracy is merely the limitation of space which would make it difficult to show any details of orna- mentation if the scale were so greatly reduced. So far as can be determined from the remains of the Capitoline temple, the ancient descriptions are remarkably accurate with regard to the dimensions. In 1865 2 there were discovered beneath the Caffarelli palace (now a part of the Conservatori Museum) remains of the great substructure of the temple, built of the flaky gray tufa used in the ear- liest buildings in Rome. Of this rectangle, for such it proved to be, there were found at that time only the southwest corner and walls extending a very short distance along the south and a somewhat greater distance along the west. While other scattered remains were not sufficient to determine the actual size of the platform, there was near the east side a well-preserved piece of wall parallel to the outside line of the temple, which extended from the south enclosing wall northward for a distance of about twenty-three meters. This must have been the wall which supported the row of columns second from the east, and the distance between it and the later discovered east wall of the temple gave the approx- imate intercolumniation (see pl. IV, fig. 3). Calculations made by Schupmann in 1876, 3 based on the intercolumniation determined by the position of this parallel wall and upon the information that the temple was hexastyle, fixed the whole width at 51 meters. 4 More recent excavations, which have added to the accuracy of our knowledge of the dimensions, have proved the proportions to be even closer to the ancient descriptions than was indicated by the calculations of Schupmann. The report of the discoveries and the more accurate measurements are given in the Notizie degli Scavi for 1921. s The south- east angle of the substructure, seen in 1876 and rediscovered in 1919, is the best pre- served ; it consists of 19 courses of cappellaccio blocks measuring approximately 32 cm. high. The wall here is of a total height of 6.20 m., extending down through the layer of creta into the living tufa below. Parts of the side walls were known at the time of the earlier reports, but only in recent excavations were as many as three angles accurately located. The partially preserved northeast angle was found near the steps which approach the Caffarelli Palace, and of the southwest angle there were sufficient traces to establish the width of the structure with reasonable certainty. The rectangle thus established by the finding of three of the angles is approximately 55 by 60 in., 6 or almost exactly the dimensions given by Dionysius. If we assume that 1 Ann.

SCOTT Dionysius himself measured the temple, using the Attic foot of .308 m., his measure in meters would be 59.29 by 63.91.1 If, however, he were quoting the dimensions accord- ing to the Roman foot of .296 m., as is quite possible, his dimensions in meters would be 61.42 by 56.98; these measurements, made from the podium with its facing, may be regarded as accurately corresponding to the present dimensions of the unfaced substructure. The difference between the length and width is almost exactly that quoted by Dionysius, which would be 4.44 meters, (calculated from the Roman foot of .296 m.). Schupmann's calculation of the intercolumnar distances was slightly inaccurate, and the resulting calculation of the whole width of the temple was four meters less than the actual width of 55 m. The distance from the east side of the remaining southeast angle to the parallel wall (including the thickness of the two walls) is 14.30 m.; 2 the thickness of the parallel wall 4 m. The thickness of the outside wall cannot now be determined, but at the angle it is visible for a thickness of about 5 m., and the measurements given in the report of 1876, of 5.60 m., are probably correct. If the columns were set exactly in the center of the walls, the intercolumniation from center to center is 14.30 - 2- 2.80 or 9.50 m. The center intercolumniation of the Tuscan temple, - and the repre- sentations of the Capitoline temple on coins show that it followed the Tuscan type in this respect, - is 1/10 of the width greater than the others. In the case of a Tuscan temple which has an added row of columns around three sides, this would probably mean 1/10 the width of the three cellae which compose the temple proper. The difference between the center intercolumniation and the ordinary intercolumniation of 9.50 m. should therefore be roughly 1/10X\(3X9.50-r 4) or 3.25 m. The whole width of the hexastyle temple, then, is about 5 X 9.50 + 5.60 + 3.25 = 56.35 m.; the width as measured from the two corners is 55 m. 3 So broad an intercolumniation as 9.50 m. (and between the two center columns 12.75 m.) is possible only if the architrave is of wood. The early Capitoline temple was of course built in the period when temples were entirely of wood, and decorated with terra-cotta revetments. But ancient references show that even in later times, when temples 1 N. S., 1921, 40. Paribeni arrives at these dimensions by solving the following equations: 1 p - 2d, and 4 L = 1 + d. ((( I )) is the small side, (( L)) the larger, ((p)) the perimeter, (( d &gt;) the difference between (( L)) and (( 1))). 2 This measurement was tested by determining the distance between the two walls at other points as well. There was recently uncovered, some meters below the modern level in the cortile of the Caffarelli Palace, a piece of the outside east wall of the substructure. The distance between this and the parallel wall, now preserved in the wall of the Conservatori, measured 14.30 m. (including as before the thickness of both walls). The measure from another piece of the wall in the same cortile was a few centimeters more, but the difference was insignificant in measurements that could be only approximate. 3 Schupmann's measurements gave the intercolum- niation as 9.20 m. He also failed to consider any greater intercolumnar space at the center. DURM, op. cit., Vol. ii, 105, has reconstructed the Capitoline temple according to the measurements of Schupmann, following the proportions prescribed by Vitruvius for the superstructure, except that he has made no allowance for the greater intercolumniation at the center.'</page><page sequence="95">EARLY ROMAN TRADITIONS 101 were ordinarily of stone, the Capitoline temple still had an architrave of wood. Vitruvius mentions this as a feature of the ((Tuscan temple,)) of which he cites the Capitoline as an example, and Tacitus 2 remarks that the temple was more easily burned because of the wooden beams. The columns which supported even the wooden architrave must have been huge, though there is naturally no evidence to determine the diameter of the early columns, made probably of wood faced with terra-cotta. 3 There was discovered, how- ever, a fragment of a marble column which must have belonged to one of the later restorations, fom the flutings of which Schupmann (in Jordan's article, Annali Ist., 1876, p. 151) conjectured the whole diameter as at least two meters. The thickness of the columns of the early temple may well have been approximately the same. The form of the early columns may be conjectured, in the absence of any specific evidence, from what is known from other sources. At Satricum there was found a col- umn base from the early temple, 4 a round base of tufa (1 6 cm. high by 75 cm. in diameter, on a plinth 25 cm. high and 81 by 84 cm. in diameter). Remains of columns from Alba Fucens also had the round base, and showed a decided decrease in diameter at the top. The diameter of a column 7.48 m. high was 89 cm. at the bottom and 67 cm. at the top. 5 There are besides a number of ancient representations of Etruscan columns, always without fluting, much narrowed at the top, usually with the round base. 6 The columns of the Capitoline temple would undoubtedly have been of this type, probably covered with a terra cotta shell. Fragments of such a column shell from the temple of Apollo at Falerii 7 show that terra cotta facing was used for columns at a somewhat later period, and it is quite possible that it was common earlier as well. 8 Dionysius' description of the Capitoline temple mentions one further detail, the high podium: 9 ?CC0 ? xpat o5 ufr Arj This detail too, as Jordan has pointed out, is corroborated by evidence from the excavations. The cappellaccio walls of the substruc- ture extend down through the layer of creta and into the solid tufa below; 10 while the wall parallel to the east enclosing wall is preserved above the layer of creta to what is apparently the full height of the podium.

SCOTT laccio courses must mark the level of the pavement, the level above which the later cella walls were erected on the old substructure. This line of brick work is about five meters above the creta; and if, as is probable, the top of this stratum of creta fixed the ancient ground level, the height of the podium is established at approximately five meters. Evidence from other sites of early temples shows that this was not an unreasonably high podium for a temple of such dimensions. Early temples in middle Italy, in both Etruria and Latium, were built on a stone platform, with an approach apparently from the front. 2 Smaller temples are known to have had podia between one and two meters high: 3 the small square temple at Marzabotto, 9.10 by 9.20 m., had a podium 1.14 m. high; another temple at Marzabotto, 17.25 by 21.40 m., was built on a podium 1.60 m. high ;4 the podium of the early temple of Castor, 19 by about 24 m., was slightly less than 3 m. high. 5 It is natural enough that a temple so much larger should have had a podium proportionately higher; if a temple as small as 9.10 by 9.20 m. had a podium measuring 1.14 m., 5 m. is a probable height for the podium of the Capitoline temple of 55 by 60 m. Since the podium was constructed of friable, uneven cappellaccio blocks, there must have been some sort of facing which would have given it an appearance in keeping with the rest of the decoration of the temple. The podium of the small temple at Marzabotto, almost the only example in which the facing is preserved, has a facing of tufa blocks carefully cut to make a decorative stylobate. 6 In the case of the Capito- line temple there might have been some such facing, or more probably, in view of the poor quality of the tufa in use at the period, a facing of stucco. It is established by the excavations on the Capitoline that the remaining substructure supported a temple very close to the type of Tuscan temple described by Vitruvius, and unquestionably the same temple which Dionysius described. It remains to establish, how- ever, that this substructure was the one built during the time of the Tarquins and not a later building. It is likely indeed that Dionysius was actually giving the dimensions of the temple of his own day, which was believed to be of the same size and proportions as the old temple built by the kings. But there is evidence that the temple of Dionysius' time, which had been built by Catulus, was constructed on exactly the same plan as the temple which had been destroyed in 83 B. C. after an uninterrupted existence of 425 years. Tacitus 7 states that the new temple of Catulus was built on the same founda- tions, ((iisdem vestigiis,") as the previous structure; Dionysius (IV, 61, 4) uses a similar expression, "-( not 69ot sXiot5. ) It is true, as Jordan points out, 8 that neither "&lt; vestigia &gt;) 1 JORDAN, Top., 1, ii, 69. 2 Cf. plans of temple A at Marzabotto, GOZZADINI, Di un'antica Necropoli a Marzabotto (part 1, tav. 2, no. 4); of temple at Orvieto, in Dedalo, vi, 1925-6, 162.

Both statements may be interpreted to mean either actually ((the same foundations,)) or merely ((on the same site,)) with no implications as to whether the rebuilding involved any enlarging of the temple. A further piece of evidence, however, points to the former interpretation. Gellius quotes a statement of Varro that Catulus proposed to lower the level of the Capitoline area in order to increase the number of steps of the approach to the temple, to give the effect of greater height. ' Since the 4favissae)) or sacred pits of the area made this plan impossible, he apparently entirely abandoned the attempt to add height to the temple. There is no mention of increasing the height of the podium from the top, either because religious conservatism prevented any change in the temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, or more likely because there were still standing some remains of the old cella walls which made the change of level impossible. 2 If the former hypothesis is true, the same conservatism which, as Tacitus' remark shows, was especially observed in the case of the te'mple of Capitoline Jove, would probably have demanded an exact adherence to the old plan. If on the other hand there were some remains of walls still standing which were not to be destroyed for religious or practical reasons, it is obvious that in erecting the new temple Catulus not only adhered to the same plan but used the old substructures of the earlier temple. The latter hypothesis seems the most probable explanation of the attempt to heighten the podium by lowering the area instead of by raising the floor level of the cellae, for if there were no objection to the idea of adding height to the low broad Tuscan temple, it is difficult to see any ritual distinction between the two methods. Catulus' proposed method was probably dictated merely by practicability. At the rebuilding under Vespasian the haruspices again forbade any change of the temple plan, though they apparently al- lowed increasing the height of the structure: (( ab eo contracti haruspices monuere, ut reli- quiae prioris delubri in paludes aveherentur, templum isdem vestigiis sisteretur: nolle deos mutari veterem formam.... altitudo aedibus adiecta : id solum religio adnuere et prioris templi magnifi- centiae defuisse credebatur. )) 3 The temple of Vespasian's time was changed from the low broad Tuscan type to the Corinthian style then considered more appropriate to the glory of Rome. But still the old conservatism, probably more tenacious in matters concerning the most august of Roman cults, demanded adherence to the same plan. 4 The nature 1 GELLIUS, ii, 10. The rebuilding by Catulus begun in or after 78 B. C. was the first rebuilding of the old Capitoline temple, therefore the first change from the early type of temple. While the new structure was of stone and discarded the terra-cotta decoration, it pre- served the Doric Tuscan style. Cf. the coin of Volteius; PLINY, N. H., xxxv, 157 implies that fictile decorations were replaced by more precious materials. 2 Provided there were such remains, religious conser- vatism would probably have forbidden their destruction.

The temple of Castor, for instance, originally</page><page sequence="98">104 INEZ G. SCOTT of the comments of both Dionysius and Tacitus practically denies any enlargement of the temple at the various rebuildings; they both state that later temples surpassed the first only in magnificence of material. 1 Ancient references clearly indicate that the restoration by Catulus and later under Vespasian adhered exactly to the form of the republican temple, which, as far as the Romans knew, had existed uninterruptedly since its first building in the late sixth century. The Roman records we should expect to be trustworthy concerning the Capitoline temple, for it is inconceivable that there should have been any extensive rebuilding of so important an edifice without some mention of it in the records. Not only ancient tradition but also archaeological standards of dating 2 argue that the cappellaccio walls still in situ on the Capitoline belonged to the temple dedicated in 509 B. C. The material is the sort of friable tufa used in the earliest buildings in Rome and largely abandoned after the discovery of the more durable tufa which occurs regularly in the structures of the fourth century. The buildings constructed of cappellaccio are almost exclusively those known to be early, of the period before the Gallic invasion, - the Regia, the temples of Castor and of Saturn, the cisterns on the Palatine, some fragments of the city wall. 3 Besides the use of cappellaccio as building material the crudeness of the work- manship is a further indication of the very early date of the substructure on the Capi- toline. The blocks are laid without mortar and very badly joined, with no use of ana- thyrosis to give a smoother surface. 4 Evidence both literary and archeological, therefore, points to the late sixth century as the date of the cappellaccio substructure of the Capi- toline temple. Tradition has pictured the building, under an Etruscan king and by workmen and artists called from Etruria, of a temple to a triad of divinities first established as a triad by the Etruscans. 5 The remains of the substructure prove the temple to have been 19 by 24 meters (see FRANK, Memoirs of the American Academy in Rome, v, 1925, 82-84) was enlarged to 30 by 50 meters at the time of the Augustan restoration. The Capitoline temple on the other hand was an immense structure even for the later period. 1 TACITUS, Hist., iii, 72 ; DIONYSIUS, iv, 61, 4. 2 FRANK, Roman Buildings of the Republic, Introduction. 3 FRANK, Roman Buildings of the Republic, p. 18, lists the monuments according to their dates and the material used. There is evidence for the use of cappellaccio at a later date in places where its friability was of no conse- quence, for instance in the retaining wall of the agger. There are two instances of its use in the inside wall of the agger, where, as there was no necessity for a wall of great strength, the poor quality of the tufa was not a great disadvantage. In both pieces of wall the fine joining and the battering of the courses point to a date later than the 6th century. (See above, Chapter IV). 4 FRANK, op. cit., 101 and 117. While anathyrosis was evidently known as early as the sixth century, since it is used in structures such as the cisterns on the Palatine, in which close joining was indispensable, it is very un- common in the earliest buildings. 5 Servius attributes the introduction of the Capitoline triad to Etruscan influence, Aen., i, 422. The existence of a Capitolium Vetus on the Quirinal has been considered a proof that the Capitoline triad was established in Rome earlier than the Etruscan period, and Varro states posi- tively that there was a temple to Jupiter, Juno, and Min- erva on the Quirinal, which was older than that on the Capitoline. (L. L., v, 158; cf. TERTULL., Ad Nat., 11, 12). That the Capitolium Vetus of pre-Etruscan Rome was not associated with a cult of Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva is made almost certain by the absence of both Juno and Minerva from the earliest calendar of festivals to native Roman deities. But whether the name ((Ca- pitolium)) survived because of an old cult of Jupiter as the chief god of the early Quirinal settlement, or because as in the later Capitolium the cult included three deities worshipped as a triad, it is difficult to say. References</page><page sequence="99">EARLY ROMAN TRADITIONS 105 of the Tuscan type, a type which the Romans must have known from other sources be- sides the ((Tuscan temples )) in Rome itself. There is perhaps further support for the Etrus- can character of the early temple in the existence of the 4favissae)) or sacred pits in the Capitoline area. Little is known of the favissae, about which the Romans themselves seem to have been much in doubt. I According to GELLIUS, ii, 10, Servius Sulpicius, on finding the words ((favissae Capitolinae)) in the censorial books, was obliged to consult Varro to discover the meaning of the reference no longer intelligible. Varro explains the meaning of the term, after remarking that the existence of the favissae in the Capitoline area pre- vented Catulus from heightening the podium by lowering the level of the area. He states them to be (( cellas quasdam et cisternas, quae in area sub terra essent, ubi reponi solerent signa vetera, quae ex eo templo collapsa essent et alia quaedam religiosa e donis consecratis. )) Varro's in Martial (v, 22, 3 ff.; vii, 73) which seem to designate the Capitolium Vetus mention only ((antiquum)) or ((ve- terem)) Jovem. Warde Fowler believes the old Gapi- tolium to have been merely an ancient shrine to Jupiter, who was worshipped on other hills as Jupiter Fagutalis, Feretrius, Viminius (Roman Festivals, 228 f.). Because the name was later so indissolubly associated with the idea of a triad it is tempting to believe, with WIssowA (Rel. u. K. der Ram.2, 40-41) that in the old cult of the Quirinal Jupiter was worshipped as the center of a triad, associated not with Juno and Minerva, who were originally non-Roman, but perhaps with Mars and Quirinus. Certain similarities in cult seem to associate Jupiter with Mars and Quirinus; these were the three gods who had ((salli,)) whose ((flamines)) were considered as of the highest rank, (FEST., 185 M., 198 L.: maximus videtur Rex, dein Dialis, post hunc Martialis, quarto loco Quirinalis), and to whom (( spolia opima)) were dedicated (FEST., 189 M., 204 L.; PLUTARCH, Marcellus, viii, 5). There is no indication, however, that the three were ever united in a triad and worshipped together. Festus gives different reasons for the high rank of the flamines of each, and the spolia were dedicated to the three gods separately and in separate places. It seems more probable that the Capitolium Vetus was merely a survival of the central cult of the Quirinal city before the union with the settlements of the other hills, and that it was so named because of its early impor- tant position and not because it united the worship of three gods into one cult as did the later Capitolium. Its survival may be an indication of a long period during which the Quirinal city maintained its separate existence. There is no reason, in evidence now available, for denying the tradition which makes the Capitoline Triad an innovation introduced by the Etruscans. The two gods associated with Jupiter in the triad are not native Roman deities, but came first with outside influence. It is true that they are also not originally Etruscan, but the Etruscans in so many instances adopted and developed native Italic gods (cf. L. R. TAYLOR, Cults of Etruria, especially p. 250) that it is not surprising if even new Italic divinities appear in Rome first with the Etruscans. There is no evidence in early Italic religion of the exis- tence of a ((triad,)) in the sense of an association of three gods worshipped in the same cult. The germs of a triad may have been present in Italic religion, in the association of Jupiter, Mars, and Quirinus at Rome, of Jupiter, Mars, and Vofionus mentioned in the Iguvine Tables. In the Italic but non-Latin cults of Iguvium Jupiter, Mars and Vofionus are all given the title of Grabovius (cf. also Cerfus Martius, Praestola Cerfia, and Tursa Cerfia). As in Rome, however, these gods seem to have been worshipped separately, Jupiter ((ante portam Trebulanam, ))Mars(( ante portam Tesenacam,)) and Vofionus ((ante portam Veiam) (BREFAL, Tables Eugubines, VI, A 22, B 1, B 19), and there is no indication of relationship except the common title. The Italic religion, so far as our evidence goes now, had no otriads)) in the later Roman sense of the word, though in this as in other instances the Etruscans may have developed an idea which they found already existing among the native people. We may in either case follow the Romans in regarding the great Triad which Tarquin established in the new temple on the Capitoline as an Etruscan innovation. The tripartite form of temple, the earliest example of which in either Latium or Etruria is the Capitoline temple of Rome, must have been introduced, or invented, at the establishment of the Triad. Since tri-partite temples occur elsewhere, in Egypt (See USENER, Rh. Mus., Iviii, 1903, 30 if.), and in Greece (PAUSANIUS, x, 5, 1-2, mentions a shrine in Phocis to Zeus, Athena, and Hera), their appearance in Rome may be an instance not of purely Etruscan influence but of the introduction of eastern influence and ideas by agency of the Etruscans.

SCOTT effort to explain the meaning of the term which he had mentioned incidentally, and Sul- picius' obvious ignorance of the existence of the favissae, indicate clearly that they were uncommon and generally unknown. Gellius' mention of only ((favissae Capitolinae, &gt;&gt; and Varro's use of ((ex eo templo )) instead of merely ((ex templo, )) suggest that favissae were not common in Roman temples. ' Varro's etymology of the word from flavisae, 2 a word equivalent to the Greek 0^fiw"Up'b'u seems a fanciful etymology based on a confusion of the meaning of the word; for if his own explanation of the term is correct, the favissae of the Capitoline area were quite different from the store-room for treasure, which is known to have existed in the temple itself. 3 The word ((favissae")) is evidently foreign, as the suffix -isa, -issa has no parallel in early Latin. 4 Since it is a suffix common in Etruscan, 5 the word as well as the pits themselves may have been introduced from Etruria at the time of the building of the Capitoline temple. If such were the case, it is quite clear how a later writer could be comparatively unfamiliar with both the word and its meaning. The custom of making such pits may never have been adopted by the Roman builders, though the name was preserved to designate those already existing. That favissae 6 were usual in Etruscan temples has support from excavations on sites where Etruscan civili- zation prevailed. Sacred pits containing old votive offerings and objects that were pro- bably sacred have been found for instance at Falerii, near the temple of Juno Curitis, 7 possibly also in the temple of Apollo, 8 near the early temple at Satricum, 9 under the church of S. Alessandro at Fiesole. W At Fiesole there were found three pits which Del Rosso believes to be the favissae of an ancient temple. They contained various objects, statuettes, lamps, and pottery, which would accord with the definition of favissae as places for storing sacred objects which had gone out of use. The favissae of the Capitoline 1 The so-called favissa of the temple of Vesta (Rom. Mitt., 1902, p. 86, fig. 20) hardly answers Varro's de- scription of the use of favissae, and there is no evidence of its having been designated by that term. The pit is a trapezoidal cavity in the podium of the temple, 5 m. deep and more than 2 m. long, lined with opus incertum and at the top with brick-work. If it was, as seems probable, a repository for the ashes of the sacred fire it must have been a necessary feature of the temple, in everyday use in connection with the rites. If this pit had been commonly known as a Javissa it is difficult to understand Sulpicius' lack of familiarity with the word. 2 GELLIUS, loc. cit. 3 Cf. PLINY, N. H., XXXIII, 14, nec ignoro co o pondo auri perisse Pompeio III cos. e Capitolini Jovis solio a Camillo ibi condita. Cf. JORDAN, Ann. Ist., xlviii, 1876, 167 ff. 4 See JORDAN, Ann.

The cult itself was Italic, and existed probably long before the temple was built; among the sacred objects were found bronze and stone spearheads. The temple, however, was certainly Etruscan. 8 N.

I In 1878 however, there was discovered under the church of S. M. della Vittoria on the Quirinal a collection of objects, chiefly pottery, which may have been the contents of a favissa of an early temple. Most of the pottery is of a period earlier than the sixth century, though the favissa continued in use until the fourth century. The temple to which it belonged therefore must have been of the period when the Etruscans were building tem- ples in Rome, and we should expect it to be provided with favissae. As far as is known there was no temple on this site in later times. 2 There is no proof that favissae may not have existed in Rome at a later period, but the Romans' unfamiliarity with them is an indication that they were never customary, while their subsequent disappearance from the Roman's vocabulary suggests that they were built and named by the Etruscans who were the builders at Rome during the late sixth century. Our information concerning the superstructure of the early Capitoline temple de- pends largely upon references to it in ancient writings. The details furnished by such sources corroborate other pieces of evidence that the temple destroyed in 83 B. C. may well have been of as early a date as 509. As has been stated, the Capitoline temple is cited as an illustration of the Tuscan type, which Vitruvius 3 described as clumsy- roofed, low and broad (barycephalae, humiles, latae), ' with intercolumniations so great that the columns could not bear the weight of a stone architrave. Of the other two examples of Tuscan temples, named by Vitruvius, one is the Temple of Ceres, dedi- cated in 491 B. C. 5 and therefore of the same period of building as the Capitoline temple; the other is Pompey's temple of Hercules near the Circus Maximus. Why at so late a date Pompey deliberately chose a style of building then regarded as archaic 6 is difficult 1 See JORDAN, Ann. Ist., xliii, 1871, 172. The pits found down on the slope of the hill, very deep below the ancient level, are probably outside the area altogether. There were found two opozzih between the temple of Vesta and the Regia which may possibly correspond to the definition of favissae. One of these (Bull. Com., xxvii, 1899, 145-6), made of small tufa blocks, was lined with ((intonaco)) and intended to be impermeable to moisture. It contained fragments of vases, 80 stili of bone, and fragments of the stone facing which had formed the mouth of the (( pozzo, )) on one of which was cut the word REGIA. The whole description suggests a cistern or well rather than a favissa of the temple. Another such pozzo (N. S., 1899, 128), lined with tufa and provided with steps for descent, contained bones of animals, lamps and coins of the Republican period, a terra-cotta slab and an antefix with figures in relief, and fragments of Etrusco- Campanian pottery. 2 Bull. Com., vi, 1878, 64-92. Another such stips votiva was found on the Quirinal near S. Vitale: Ann. Ist., lii, 1880, 158 ff.; Bull. Ist., 1880, 137-8. This also contains material largely of the early period, so that it must have belonged to a temple of the Etruscan period which no longer existed in later Republican times. 3 VITRUVIUS, II1, 3, 5. 4 This term might refer to the broad eaves known to have been a feature of the Italic temple; cf. Rizzo, Bull. Comm., xxxviii, 1910, fig. 1, p. 287. 5 While no archaeological remains prove the temple of Ceres to be of so early a date, there is little doubt that the literary evidence is correct. The tradition that the paintings in the temple of Ceres were by the Greek painters Damophilus and Gorgasus coincides significantly with the known fact that Ionic Greek influence was very strong in Etruria and Latium at about this period. Cf. the Ionic character of terra-cotta friezes of somewhat earlier date; also, the Ionic influence in statues from Veii of this period. 6 Cf. Catulus' attempt to change the low broad appearance of the Capitoline temple, in order to bring the temple closer to what was then the prevailing type. GELL., ii, 10.</page><page sequence="102">108 INEZ G. SCOTT to say, unless it was because of the great antiquity of the worship of Hercules and his connection with that section of the city from the very earliest times. Actual archeological evidence concerning the superstructure of the temple is almost entirely lacking. A few fragments of architectural terra-cotta decoration which may have belonged to the early temple are very scant testimony in comparison with rich finds of terra- cottas from other sites. This absence of evidence may be explained by the reference of Tacitus to the carrying away of the rubbish from the destroyed temple before the work of restoration was begun: (4haruspices monuere, ut reliquiae prioris delubri in paludes aveherentur.)) I Fortunately, remains of terra-cotta revetments from sites of other early temples have furnished sufficient evidence for fairly accurate reconstruction of the type of temple existing in Latium in the 6th and 5th centuries. Study of the fragments has established criteria of dating, 2 while various ancient representations of temples have made it possible to re- produce the whole decoration of the early Etrusco-Italic temple. 3 The few early f rag- ments from the Capitoline temple are sufficient to show that this was of the same type which can be restored from ancient representations and fragments of decoration found at various sites. Further, the few details recorded in ancient literature concerning the style and decoration of the Capitoline temple are in accord with what we know of early temples in Latium. Ancient allusions describe the ornamentation of the fastigium of the temple as a fictile quadriga4 made by the order of Tarquin, and after Tarquin's expulsion finally given up by the people of Veii only when a portent had intimidated them. The legend of the making of the quadriga for the ornamentation of the fastigium is important because it supplies one detail of the decoration, and even more important for the record of the circumstances of its manufacture. The making of the quadriga was entrusted to the artists of Veii, at that time famous for their skill in the moulding of terra-cotta. This incident preserved in the legend harmonises significantly with the discovery at Veii of several fine archaic statues which prove that at Veii during the late 6th and early 5th centuries there existed a school of artists who deserved the fame which the legend attributes to them. 5 While the con- nection of the quadriga of the Capitoline pediment with Veii is a priori an argument for the correctness of the dating, there are no corroborating examples from other sites to 1 TAC., Hist., iv, 53. While Tacitus refers to the rebuilding under Vespasian, the same method of clearing the site may have been used before the earlier restoration. 2 E.

' At the end of the sixth century the most common forms of akroteria were either representations in relief of scenes of combat, between Greek warriors or between Amazons and Greeks, or figures of griffins, sphinxes, horses either whole or in part. 2 From Caere come two early acroteria representing deities in mythological scenes, Eos carrying off Cephalus, and Athena with Heracles; 3 and from Orvieto one in the form of a three-headed daemon. 4 There is no exact parallel from any period to fix the date of a quadriga as a common akroterial figure, but there is no evidence inconsistent with the early dating of the quadriga made at Veii. Accounts vary concerning the identity of the deity represented in the chariot, some naming Summanus, some Jupiter. Cicero relates an incident in which there figured ((Summanus in fastigio Jovis Optimi Maximi, qui tum erat fictilis,)) 5 but according to Livy the Ogulnii in 298 B. C. set up on the Capitoline temple ((Jovem in culmine cum qua- driga ,, 6 Whether in later times Jupiter took the place of an earlier fictile Summanus is not clear. But early Italic customs with regard to ornamentation of temples make it more likely that the figure represented was the minor divinity Summanus than that it was Jupiter Capitolinus himself. Not until the fourth and third centuries was it usual to represent the gods in the exterior decoration of temples, and even then the major divi- nities appear very rarely. 7 Artemis Persica is a common type for antefixes in the late fourth and early third centuries, occasionally there occur heads of divinities, Achelouis, Minerva, Bacchus, Diana, 8 and at the temple of Mercury (?) at Falerii the central akro- terion was a full figure of Mercury (?). I In the earlier period the representation of any divinity in the exterior decoration of a temple was much more rare; numerous antefixes of the ((Juno Sospita)) type, "c however, show that such representation was not unknown in the period of building to which the Capitoline temple belongs. The recently discovered proof of the excellence of the art of Veii in the late sixth century further corroborates the tradition that the artist Vulca was summoned from that city to make the cult image. The image was of terra-cotta, a figure clad in a (( toga pal- 1 The only remaining fragments of an akroterion representing a quadriga are from the temple of Apollo at Falerii of the fourth century. But this example is not a significant parallel, as it probably belonged to some mythical scene such as the rape of Proserpine or that of the Leucippides by the Dioscuri. It is of the period when mythical scenes were common forms of decoration. DELLA SETA, op. cit., 1, 194. Cf. his discussion of the third period of decoration, 144 ff. 2 E.

The type was common in the early fifth century, i. e., the ((archaic period)) according to Della Seta's classification; the Capitoline temple would have been one of the earlier temples of this period, somewhat earlier perhaps than any known examples of the Juno Sospita antefixes. The Summanus of the fastigium of the Capitoline temple must have been practically the earliest of the representations of divinities in architectural decoration.</page><page sequence="104">110 INEZ G. SCOTT mata )) or (( toga picta )) and holding in his hand a thunderbolt, 1 or, according to other accounts, a sceptre. Numerous references to the pomp of a military triumph mention that the toga palmata and the painted face of the triumphing general are in imitation of the simulacrum of Capitoline Jove. 2 It is not known whether the early cult statue was a standing figure or seated. That later after the restoration of Catulus the image was seated is apparent from a mention of Caligula's setting his daughter on the knees of the statue of Jove. 3 But Jordan interprets a line in Ovid, ((Juppiter angusta vix totus stabat in aede ,94 as meaning not that the earlier temple was smaller, but that it seemed small for a standing figure of the god. While the more natural interpretation of the phrase ((angusta aede)) is that the earlier temple was small compared with the great temple of Ovid's day, such an interpretation is too flatly in contradiction to the Romans' own belief that the temple destroyed in 83 B. C. had existed since 509. As the use of the phrase "vix totus stabath) also suggests a standing figure, Jordan's may be the correct interpre- tation. If such is the case we might picture the cult image of the early temple in the style perhaps of the Apollo from Veii: 5 it would have been a standing archaic figure clad in a toga, with the flesh painted dark red, as was customary in statues of terra-cotta. The style of the early temple of Capitoline Jove must necessarily remain largely a matter for conjecture. But since all the known details of the temple which the Romans believed to have been built by the Tarquins are in accord with what facts we know from other sources concerning early temples, we have a significant indication of the correctness of the tradition. It has been suggested 6 that the Romans' own belief in the antiquity of the simulacrum of Jove, for example, and of the paintings in the temple of Ceres, is worthy of consideration. For the Romans of Augustus' day, well acquainted with the Greek works of art of the best period, would easily have distinguished between an archaic original and the terra-cotta work of the later period, permeated as it was with influence of fifth and fourth century Greek art. 7 There was likely an archaism of style, less familiar to the Romans, which justified in their eyes the recognition of certain works as very ancient. ' OVID., Fasti, i, 201-2, describes the early cult statue as holding the thunderbolt, ((inque Jovis dextra fictile fulmen erat")); SERVIUS, Ecl., x, 27, mentions the sceptre. 2 PLINY, N. H., xxxiii, 11 1-1 12 ; SERVIUS, loc. cit. The reason for the painted face was that the early cult statue was of terra-cotta, and the flesh, according to the archaic custom (which lasted into later times), was painted deep red. Cf. tomb paintings, the Apollo from Veii, and Apollo of Falerii in the Villa Giulia. 3 JOSEPHUS, Arch., xix, 2 (11). ' Fasti, i, 201. 5 The Apollo of Veii is itself of course not a cult image but a part of a group. There remain very few fragments of simulacra, for the reason probably, as Della Seta suggests, op. cit., 1, 161, that the cult image would be cherished the more for its antiquity instead of being discarded and renewed like architectural decoration. A few fragments are sufficient to show that cult statues were terra-cotta figures; from Satricum there is a finely made male head, perhaps part of the statue of Jove (DELLA SETA, I, 161), and fragments of a statue perhaps of Mi- nerva; parts of a female figure from the greater temple ((di Vignale)) of Falerii (DELLA SETA, 1, 180, no. 7297), feet of a male figure from Ardea (DELLA SETA, 1, 212, no. 3797); of a later period, parts of a seated statue of Jove from Signia (DELLA SETA, 1, 221, nos. 19403-5). 6 GIGLIOLI, N.

The two early fragments ' are a large tile painted with a meander border in red and black, and a fragment of a palmette with the front fashioned in relief and painted in red and black, the back painted in the same design without the relief. 2 Both these fragments may well have belonged to a temple built in the late sixth century. From the temple at Satricum of the ((archaic!) period there are numerous fragments of tile painted with various ornamental designs, flame design, series of circles, strigilations, palmettes, braid pattern. 3 The fragment of palmette decoration seems from its shape and the finishing of the lower edge to have been a part of the grill-work cornice, the top-most band of decoration. This use of a row of palmettes at the top of the cornice was a feature of the revetments from the earliest period down to much later times. From the VI-V century temple at Satricum, 4 from the early temple of Mercury at Falerii, 5 and from the early temple at Signia, 6 there are fragments of such cornices surmounted by a row of rather low broad palmettes. From the IV century temple of Apollo 7 at Falerii there is a cornice more elaborate but with the row of palmettes on the same position as in the ear- lier examples. The same design on a still more elaborate cornice comes from the II cen- tury temple at Signia, 8 the palmettes slightly taller and more slender, but not more so than would be demanded in a cornice much higher than those of the early temples. Since the design apparently furnishes no criterion of dating, the only tests are the quality of clay and the workmanship, which in this case point to the late sixth century as a prob- bable date. 9 Unfortunately neither of the fragments from the Capitoline temple is of a sort that helps determine the size of the building they adorned. The tile is .65 m. wide, painted on the under side with a meander .29 m. wide. It is not appreciably larger than tiles of much smaller temples, but apparently there is not a variation in the sizes of terra-cotta revet- ments proportionate to the dimensions of the various buildings from which they come. 10 1 The third fragment from the same site is of a later period, a female figure of rather small proportions which may have been an antefix (Bull. Comm., xxiv, 1896, pl. XII-XIII ; J. R. S., iv, 1914, 183). Such a fragment of a later period need not indicate any general restoration of the temple, as terra-cotta revetments had to be gradu- ally renewed. 2 Published in Bull. Comm., xxiv, 1896, pl. XII-XIII. 3 DELLA SETA, op. cit., I, 273, nos. 10151 d., dates these in the ((archaic period,)) but thinks that some of them may be still earlier, of the (( Ionic period.)) 4 DELLA SETA, op. cit., I, 255, nos. 10126 f. 5 Ibid., 1, 169, no. 12431. 6 Ibid., I, 218, nos. 16774 ff.; 18908 ff. 7 Ibid., 1, 198, no. 3746. 8 Ibid., 1, 220, nos. 19075 ff. 9 E. DOUGLAS VAN BUREN, J. R. S., iv, 1914, 183. The painted decoration of the palmette (Bull. Comm., xxiv, 1896, pl. XI I-XI II) is very well preserved. The painting is similar to that of palmettes from a second century cornice at Signia, petals alternately red and black, and three bands at base of red, white, and black. While the coloring of the earlier examples has largely disappeared, it was probably very similar. 10 The same is true of the revetments forming the entablature. The height of the terra-cotta facing of the beams, for instance, differs very little for temples as different in size as the temple of Juno Curitis at Falerii</page><page sequence="106">112 INEZ G. SCOTT Of the few remaining tiles of which the full width is preserved, those from the temple of Apollo at Falerii, a temple 17 m. wide, are .60 m. wide and .79 long I ; from the tiny temple at Alatri, only 7 or 8 m. wide, a tile measures .40 m. 2 A tile of extraor- dinary size, .80 m. wide and 1.17 long, 3 was found at Marzabotto, where the largest of the temples was 21 m. long and perhaps almost as wide. 4 Though they can offer no independent evidence concerning the size of the early temple, the fragments from the Capitoline could very well have adorned a temple measuring 55 by 60 m.; they are not inconsistent with the other indications that the temple dedicated in 509 was built upon the cappellaccio substructure still existing on the Capitoline. While few early temples have been sufficiently preserved to allow the restoration of the plan, it is clear from cases in which the dimensions can be determined that a temple of 55 by 60 m. was entirely unprecedented in size at the time when the Capito- line temple was built, and unusually large even for later times. 5 And yet it is impos- sible, from the material and the workmanship, to date the cappellaccio platform on the Capitoline later than the earliest period of Roman building. Further, the one remaining parallel wall, the position of which clearly falls in with the plan of a great hexastyle temple, precludes any possibility that this platform might have been the original temple area, on which was built an edifice of much smaller dimensions. 6 The existence of so huge a temple in Rome at the close of the sixth century can have but one interpretation with regard to the history of the city: under the Etruscan kings Rome must have occupied a place of importance in Latium, and must have been, as tradition alleges, a well-organized city of considerable wealth and population. Evidence for this fact comes from other early buildings besides the Capitoline temple, though in no other case do the remains of early foundations permit accurate restoration. and that of Apollo, or even the tiny temple at Alatri. Of the temple of Juno, 43 m. wide, the facing is 60 cm. high; of the temple at Signia, 40 by 25 m., it is 60 cm.; of the temple of Apollo at Falerii, only 17 m. wide, it is 60 cm.; of the temple at Alatri, 7 or 8 m. wide, the facing 'is about 50 cm. There is the same similarity in sizes of antefixes, akroteria, and other elements of the decoration of these temples.

Originally it must have extended from the front wall at the south to the front wall of the solid platform which supported the cellae, part of which is still visible in the new wing of the Conservatori Museum.</page><page sequence="107">EARLY ROMAN TRADITIONS 113 Fragments of terra-cotta decoration show that there were early structures on the sites where tradition places the earliest buildings of the time of the first kings. E. Douglas Van Buren' has pointed out the significance of the finding of early fragments of architectural terra-cotta decoration on the site of the Regia, at the Comitium, and on the Palatine near the hut of Romulus and the Scalae Caci, a district connected with the earliest legend. It is significant that on these sites, all of them associated with traditions of the earliest period, there have been found fragments of architectural decoration which must have adorned buildings con- structed in the sixth century, earlier than the temple of the Tarquins which was completed at the very end of the century. A study of early architectural decoration has furnished cri- teria for fairly exact dating; and it is known that by the time of the building of the temple of the Capitoline the Italic temple had arrived at the second stage of its development. In the sixth century the facing of the beams consisted of a band of fluted decoration at the top, a band of figurative relief, and a simple band at the base of the frieze. 2 This type has been designated as (( Ionic)) because the band of relief usually shows strong influence of Ionic art. The second period, to which a temple completed in 509 B. C. must have belonged, began in the latter part of the sixth century and continued into the fifth. In this period, which Della Seta calls ((archaic)) as opposed to Ionic, the band of relief has disap- peared, and its place is taken by some design such as the meander or braid pattern. 3 There is therefore a criterion for accurate dating of buildings of the sixth and early fifth centuries. Fragments found on the Palatine and elsewhere in Rome were of friezes of the Ionic period, and prove the existence of a number of buildings in Rome, on the Palatine and in the Comitium and on the site of the Regia, at a date earlier than the building of the Capitoline temple. ' From the Palatine, chiefly from the early cistern between the house of Livia and the temple of Magna Mater, come fragments of a number of different types of friezes common in architectural decoration of the sixth century. Though in some cases the fragments are not sufficient to restore the type of frieze, they can be identified by better preserved examples of the same types from other sites of Etruria and Latium. These friezes, representing armed riders with horses, armed warriors mounting chariots, chariots drawn by winged 1 J. R. S., iv, 1914, 183 ff. 2 DELLA SETA, op. cit., 1, 129; 159-60; Bull. Comm., xxxviii, 1910, 317-18. E. DOUGLAS VAN BUREN, op. cit., 57 if., also dates these in the sixth century, a very few as late as the fifth. 3 DELLA SETA, op. cit., I, 142; J. R. S., iv, 1914, 183 ff. 4 As has been pointed out, some work of draining the Forum must have preceded the construction of any buildings, yet the first form of the Cloaca Maxima is ascribed apparently correctly to the Etruscan period. The construction of the cloaca, of stone, in all probability not previous to the Etruscan period, may not have been the first attempt at making the Forum usable as a meeting- ground. In fact, the Forum had undoubtedly been so used since the disappearance of burials from the Sepul- cretum at least a century earlier. It must have been drained first by an open stream, perhaps artificially deepened, which carried the water down through the Velabrum to the river. The sites of the Comitium, the ((templa)) of Janus and Jupiter Stator, and even the Regia, are none of them at the lowest level of the Forum, where the channel for drainage would have been made.

SCOTT horses, chariot races, banquet scenes, ' have been found on the Palatine and elsewhere in Rome, as well as at other sites, - Caere, Velitrae, Praeneste, Veii. This type of deco- ration, which apparently originated in Asia Minor and was thence introduced into Italy perhaps by way of Crete, 2 was commonly used in Latium on temples of the sixth century. The friezes are largely Greek incharacter, but a few non-Greek elements appearing in fragments from sites in both Latium and Etruria indicate that the style of decoration was introduced into Latium by the more Hellenized Etruscans. The meander decoration and scale pattern, the armor of the warriors, the herald appearing on the friezes from Velitrae and Rome, are all Greek in origin. 3 But there are some non-Greek elements which point to Etruscan workmanship, or concession to Etruscan taste on the part of artisans who were either Greeks or Etruscans working from Greek models. The chariot represented on the earliest of these friezes, which consists of a platform with a solid parapet, and has wheels of 6 or 8 spokes (instead of the 4 spokes usual in representations of Greek chariots), Nachod 4 considers the original Etruscan type of chariot. The fragments from the Palatine all show this type, with the exception of one fragment of slightly later date. 5 Another concession to Etruscan taste 6 is perhaps the representation of the triga on friezes from Velitrae and from the Esquiline and Palatine. 7 Winged horses, 8 which appear on friezes from the Palatine and Esquiline as well as from Velitrae and Praeneste, are more common in Italic art than in Greek. Mrs. Van Buren points out other elements in these friezes which probably show Etruscan influence, - details of dress, the short chiton worn by the charioteer instead of the Greek charioteer's robe, the augur's curved rod, the whip which takes the place of the goad common in Greek art. 9 Beside these types of relief, a fragment from the cistern on the Palatine is of a type repre- senting a banquet scene, other instances of which come from Velitrae and Caere. 10 From the same part of the Palatine comes an antefix in the form of a bearded head of a satyr, similar to others found at Satricum, Signia, Falerii and Velitrae, and probably belonging to the 1 See classification in E.

' There are also other fragments from the revetments of an early structure on the Palatine, which cannot be identified as belonging to any particular element of decoration; a fragment of a horse's leg, which Mrs. Van Buren suggests as a part of the ornamentation of a pediment, a fragment of a fluted cornice, a bit of wing that must have belonged to an akroterion. 2 It is evident that a group of buildings existed on the Palatine as early as the sixth century; and though the identity of these cannot now be determined, it is to be noted that tradition places here the Casa Romuli, and the fifth sacrarium of the Argei, an early shrine about the origin of which the Romans them- selves seem to have been none too sure. In the Forum, early fragments have been found only on the sites connected with the earliest history of Rome. From the comitium there are several fragments of reliefs, one of which, found near the Lapis Niger, Mrs. Van Buren considers somewhat earlier than the friezes from Velitrae. 3 From the same site come a piece of a Gorgon's head, beardless, of a type belonging to the fifth century, ' and a head of an antefix of a type common in the fifth century. 5 From the Regia there are only a fragment of an antefix and a tile decorated with a various-colored meander toprove the existence of an early building ornamented with terra-cotta revetments. 6 From the Esquiline there are a number of early fragments, besides the friezes which have been mentioned. 7 In the Conservatori Museum are two fine frag- ments, the beautifully made torso of a wounded warrior, of the late sixth or early fifth century, and a satyr's head of the same period. 8 While our knowledge of Roman buildings and topo- graphy at so early a period does not make it possible to conjecture to what structures all these various fragments belonged, their existence points toward the correctness of the tradition which represents Rome as having reached a fairly advanced stage of development in the late sixth and early fifth centuries. The tendency of criticism has been to accuse Roman tra- dition of exaggerating the importance of the city at so early a date, of picturing Rome as a well-organized city of strong fortifications and great temples at a time when in reality it was merely a loose federation of hill communities. The traditional account of the extensive building of temples in Rome at the end of the sixth and in the early fifth century implies the existence of a rich and prosperous city.

Of these and other buildings which must have existed at the same period, 2 there remain, besides bits of foundation, a few scattered fragments of terra-cotta decoration, sufficient only to prove the existence in Rome in the late sixth century of buildings of the same type as those known to have existed elsewhere in Latium at the same period. But with the fragments from other sites where successive centuries of building did not obliterate the traces of the earliest period ', we are able to piece out the whole picture, a picture of an Etruscanized civilization at various sites in Latium, of much the same sort as that which tradition attributes to Rome during the last half of the sixth century. The number of temples and other buildings existing in Rome by the beginning of the fifth century, the number dedicated in close succession in the first decades of that century, the enormous size of the temple of the Capitoline, all point to the conclusion that the Etrus- canized civilization that had spread throughout Latium at that period had its most important center in Rome. 1 The temples were dedicated respectively in 497, 493, and 484 B.
