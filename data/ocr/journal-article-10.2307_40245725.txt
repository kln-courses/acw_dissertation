Austin: University of Texas Press, 1964. xiv + 213 pp. The moribund state of classical studies, along with the alleged death of the bourgeoisie and the Nietzschean and Existentialist death of God, have constituted facile themes for monotonous laments by men of the twentieth century. Let us here leave the third of those threadbare clichés at peace: God may be dead, but the ancient gods, sung by Schiller and Hoelderlin, certainly have never been as alive as they have for the last two hundred years. Each of them, like Keats's young Apollo, is . . . liker still to one who should take leave Of pale immortal death, and with a pang As hot as death's is chill, with fierce convulse Dies into life. ("Hyperion," III, 127-130) The bourgeoisie has never been more lusty, and it has almost annexed the former working classes, socially and intellectually. As to classical learning, it may draw somewhat fewer specialists to philology and epigraphy and inflict less torture of Greek and Latin grammar upon lethargic or stubborn teen-agers. But we live today in a great age of archeology; of reinterpretation of antiquity with the help of anthro- pology, history, sociology; of vivid translations of ancient writers. Just as the theater gained immeasurably from relinquishing huge areas of its former over-extended realm to the big and the little screen and painting gained from abandoning the realistic copy of life to photography, our insight into the world of Hellas, of the Latins, of Byzance, and of the prolonged decline and fall of Roman power has been sharpened and deepened when ancient languages came to be elected as fields of study by those who had more originality and more courage than the average pupils. Greek in particular has become a favorite subject in college with the heretics and the rebels: with only a little push from university extension services and more inspiring lecturers, it could well become an ideal subject to be taken up by middle-aged women eager for a challenge and weary of reading paperbacks on their sexual inadaptation or on how to bear, raise, feed, and inhibit children. Horace is perhaps translated less often today by superannuated magistrates than he used to be; Caesar and Polybius are quoted less often in the memoirs of retired army officers; but Plato and Aristotle are more truly familiar today to former students of philosophy and politics than they ever were when all college youth struggled against their prose in the original. Reinterpretations of Œdipus Rex, Ajax, Antigone, and the Oresteia and dissertations on the essence of tragedy have become a more thriving industry among scholars and publishers even than theses on Boswell, Melville, and Henry James or commentaries on "Sailing to Byzantium." This elegant and varied volume consists of seven essays on the survival of the classics among recent or now living writers of Greece (Kazantzakis), Germany (Rilke), Ireland (Joyce), America (Pound), France (Giraudoux, modern novelists), and England (T. S. Eliot). The pervading, almost obsessive presence of Hellenic myths among us naturally absorbs most of the authors' attention, whether they are treated ironically and with facile effects or parody or taken gravely as sources of 175</page><page sequence="2">176 + COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES imagery or of ambiguity in modern fiction. But one of the writers, J. P. Sullivan, of Texas, well known for his contributions to one of the liveliest and best-written maga- zines in the English speaking world, Arion, has contributed a perceptive analysis of Ezra Pound's rendering of Propertius. Pound has probably deserved his title of "II miglior fabbro" through his deft translations of Latin and Provençal bards rather than through his perverse Cantos. Unlike some haughty professors of classics, who delight in pointing out mistakes in the verse translations by gifted amateurs, J. P. Sullivan knows how to interpret those as humor or as poetical recreations of the original text. Frederic Will's brief survey of the longest epic ever inspired by the Ulysses theme, that of Kazantzakis, in 33,333 lines, is suggestive and worthy of the versatile American scholar who is also a gifted poet and has lately composed a fine piece of verse on Ulysses, the most modern of the Greek heroes, who in our time has fascinated Voronca, Audisio, Fondane, Giono, and probably many others through Joyce. Ralph Freedman's dense and deeply thought chapter on "Gods, Heroes and Rilke" stands as a model for comparative studies, bringing in Rodin, Baudelaire, and Valéry as well as the Greeks. Another adopted Texan, David Hayman, ingeniously unravels the Daedalian imagery in Joyce's first novel. The lucid simplicity of such a piece, written by a scholar who might have been lured into the pursuit of endless complexities through his double allegiance to Mallarmé and to Joyce, is certainly praiseworthy. The weaving of garlands of flowerets around ancient myths by Giraudoux has been analyzed many a time. Melvin J. Friedman is aware of all the articles on the subject. Giraudoux, who hated pedantry and coquettishly endeavored to conceal his Normalien spirit, has become, along with Camus, snowed under learned com- mentaries. Melvin Friedman carries his vast scholarship with ease and does justice to Giraudoux's best play, his Amphitryon, whimsically and misleadingly called the thirty-eighth comedy on the subject. As always Voltairian Giraudoux, a half brother to Voltaire when Voltaire was a poet and to other light society poets of the eighteenth century, turned his treatment of the theme to an attack against the very notion of the divine; men and especially women are such wiser and saner Epicureans than the gods. Léon Roudiez seized upon a curious and original aspect of two reputedly "new novels," Robbe-Grillet's Les Gommes and Butor's L'Emploi du Temps. The first, although the work of an anti-humanist and of a foe of all anthropomorphism, plays ingeniously around the myth of Œdipus, although it can hardly be contended that the novel gains much depth by those skillful ambiguities. The presence of Ariadne and Phaedra, of the Cretan minotaur, and of labyrinthine ways is far more obvious in Butor's novel - indeed heavily underlined by the earnest, heavy-handed novelist. The novel is that of a well-read philosophical mind, doggedly unafraid of wearying his readers through his hero's vacillations: he is no impetuous Theseus. The longest essay in the volume, too profuse of quotations and references to pre- vious scholars, slow-moving, but scrupulous and just, is that of David De Laura, also from Austin, on the role played by the classics in T. S. Eliot's Christian humanism. Eliot never ceased advocating resting our culture and even our modern literary innovations on the ancient writers, as providing maturity as well as reverence for traditions. "England is a 'Latin' country," he decreed. The Latins, indeed, seem to have been more familiar than the Greeks to him. Few attempts at redoing the Oresteia have proved as unHellenic and unpoetical as The Family Reunion; and if The Cocktail Party does owe something to Alcestis, the comparison is to the ad- vantage of Euripides, "the Greek Baudelaire," as Claudel called him. Eliot seems to have missed altogether the elements of light grace, of sensuous playfulness, of nimble</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS + 177 imagination, which are among the eternal charms of Greek literature. As David De Laura shows, Eliot looked in the ancients, and chiefly in Virgil, for what might have anticipated Christianity and what could be reconciled with it. Simone Weil, in a fervent but misguided essay, made a similar attempt. To Eliot the present human condition is utter gloom; our culture is ailing; liberalism has endangered it; it is vain to hope to spread it democratically without diluting it to the vanishing point. Our sole hope for salvation lies in a Christian society; and the sole hope for the survival of the classics lies in "the revival and expansion of monastic orders." But pontifical, mournful Eliot never expressed anything very illuminating on any ancient writer, or even on Dante in his well known but unoriginal essay on him. The alliance which he and other conservatives stubbornly insist on establishing between the Greek heritage and the Judaeo-Christian one in our civilization is hardly more than a threadbare cliché. It has become a sanctimonious commonplace of our lecturers to treat Sophocles as if he had been the teacher of a pious, almost Christian message and to treat Pindar and Virgil as if they deserved our admiration chiefly for having uttered a few gnomic platitudes (they did much else and much better) to which a Christian professor of morality might subscribe. Paul Mazon was closer to the truth when he declared: "There never was a less religious poem than the Iliad. The Iliad does not have the prop of a 'faith,' as do most great national epics. It reflects, rather, all human uncertainties." So do most other Greek writers. And Lucretius, after all, cannot be counted out of our Hereditas. A pleasant presentation of the volume and ingenious hints on its significance are modestly and artistically offered in the preface by Frederic Will. All the essays are written with care, lucidity, and charm. Henri Peyre Yale University</page></plain_text>
