Milson Atrip especially to spend to the if a zoo you spring is and a terrific afternoon, the class way to spend a spring afternoon, especially if you and the class get there for feeding time in the lion house. But a modern zoo can offer children much more. It is an excellent environment in which to observe and explore the world of animals. Students can learn how physical characteristics, behavior, adaptation, habitat, diet, and locomotion all play important roles in animals' survival. 24 February 1984 Science and Children</page><page sequence="2">A woolly monkey (left) uses its prehensile tail to steady itself as it chatters aggressively at visitors to the zoo. Camels' adaptations to their life in the desert include calluses on their chests , elbows , and heels, as well as the ones visible on the knees of the mother dromedary camel (below). Other exam- ples of adaptation are the nostrils that can be closed to keep sand from blowing in and the hump that assists camels in going several days without water. Why All That Snarling? Consider animal behavior. Ask students to observe the big cats - lions, tigers, leopards, and so on. Do these creatures exhibit a solitary or a social lifestyle? Which animals do seem to group to- gether? The primate area is an excel- lent place to observe group behavior. Ask students to watch carefully for examples of passive behavior, such as marking territorial boundaries with urine and feces, scratching trees, as- suming submissive body postures, and performing grooming activities. Aggres- sive behavior patterns such as scream- ing, baring and clacking the teeth, smacking the lips, and staring are fre- quently directed at the human beings watching. Students may want to dis- cuss the aggressive and passive behav- ior they've seen in family pets or among human beings themselves. Is any of their own behavior similar to that of the primates? Does this mean the pri- mates feel or think the same way hu- mans do? (This is a good time to bring up the subject of anthropomorphism.) Form Follows Function Many animals have special equip- ment, or adaptations, that allow them to survive in their environment. Of the three types of adaptation - behavioral, physiological, and structural - the last is the easiest to observe at the zoo. Structural adaptations include the mod- ified forelimbs of birds, elephants' large ears, and giraffe's long legs. Camels can provide your students with an excellent example of structural adaptation. In order to survive in the deserts where they live, camels have evolved eyelashes and noses that keep out the blowing sand; calluses on their legs and chest to protect them when they kneel or lie on the hot sand; and large feet with a cushiony pad that allows them to walk on the sand's sur- face without sinking in. Plains animals also exhibit some in- teresting adaptations. Gazelles have dark patches under their eyes to reduce the solar glare that might prevent them from spotting predators. An ostrich's long and powerful legs, long neck, and big eyes all help to keep danger at a distance. Appropriate Environments Animals' native environments, their habitats , are receiving more attention from those who design and build zoos, so chances are your students will be able to tell a lot about where the ani- mals they are watching came from. Fish and other sea creatures live in minia- February 1984 Science and Children 25 li</page><page sequence="3">The koala bear's limbs are well adapted to ih life in the trees. For example , its toes have long, sharp nails to help in climbing . Here, a koala grasps leaves from a eucalyptus tree, which is its sole source of food. (Students are not going to find koalas in any American zoo. Can they explain why?) M t ï- i ■g « I ture aquatic ecosystems that represent particular spots in the ocean, while in a recreated subtropical rain forest, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals share space just as they would in the wild. Not all zoos are so well built, but enclosures for cats will have tree limbs for the cats to climb on and shady [daces to lie down and catnap in, enclo- sures for mountain and canyon animals will have shelves and step arrangements to simulate mountain-climbing terrain, and so forth. Some zoos have been able to reconstruct desert, grassland, and arctic niches to make animals feel mòre at home. Ask students to observe the habitats of animals with similar physi- cal characteristics. Are the habitats simi- lar? Why might this be so? Moving Along Animals use many different locomotion techniques to move from one place to another. Some fly while others swim or crawl Some primates are equipped with prehensile tails for grasping tree limbs and balancing their weight as they swing through the forest's upper story. And some can swing their arms in almost a complete circle, a talent that also makes it easy for them to move from tree to tree. Some plains animals walk on their toes, or have tiny cloven hooves, while others tramp around flat-footed. How do seals and sea lions move? Snakes? Ask students to describe as many different methods of move- ment as they can distinguish among the zoo animals. What special adapta- tions and behavior are involved, and why do students think these evolution- ary changes occurred? You Are What You Eat? The type of food animals eat is another interesting topic. Check feeding times with zoo staff prior to your visit so you can see as many animals during feeding time as possible. What are they eating, plants or animals? An animal that eats mainly plants is called a herbivore and is usually the prey of another animal. Predators are, of course, meat-eaters or carnivores. (Omnivores eat both plants and animals.) Ask students to try to identify whether an animal is a carni- vore or an herbivore. Do they see any physical characteristics that members 26 February 1984 Science and Children</page><page sequence="4">of each group share? What part of the body is most likely to exhibit character- istics that have to do with diet? Stu- dents will notice that herbivores do not have the sharp canine teeth of the car- nivore, nor do they have the cats' claws for holding and slashing their prey. Less obvious may be the difference in vision: herbivores usually have monocular vision. That is, their eyes are on the sides of their head (as with a horse). This allows them to see nearly all the way around them, but they cannot focus well on objects right in front of them. Herbivores also characteristically have hooves. The binocular vision that cats and other carnivores enjoy enables them to keep a close eye on potential victims they are stalking. And their streamlined, muscular bodies are well suited to win the chase that will follow. An Aid to Observation I have found it useful to provide stu- dents with work sheets on which they record certain information and any observations they make while at the zoo. We discuss the aspects of animal study I have just described before the actual field trip, emphasizing the use of correct terminology and the value of recording as many eyewitness observa- tions as possible. (See chart at right.) If you are unable to plan a trip to the zoo, there are several alternatives. You might suggest that students visit the zoo with their parents or friends and complete the work sheets as a group activity. In some cases, the zoo's educa- tional director or other staff member may bring a few animals into the class- room and answer students' questions about diet, habitat, and behavior. There are many good films, videotapes, and slide shows - as well as books and magazines - that students can view and read in order to complete their work sheets. After the work sheets are finished we hold classroom discussions that reinforce what students have learned about animals. The discussions also encourage them to keep improving their observational skills, the refinement of that natural curiosity which is the cor- nerstone of scientific investigation.
