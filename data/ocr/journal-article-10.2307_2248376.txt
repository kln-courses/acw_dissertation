[President's address to the American Philosophical Association, 1902. Philosophers have been largely occupied with the history of their science, and have neglected personal intercourse and co-operation. Knowledge of the history of philosophy is essential, but the history is intelligible only when read in the light of present-day problems; and personal meetings tend to bring historical studies into closer and more intimate relation to one's own philosophical standpoint. Co-operation means fruitful work and sanity of outlook, as well as encouragement to the individual. Overtly and consciously, the purpose of a philosophical association should be to promote and en- courage original investigation and research. It will thus help to remove two common reproaches made against philosophy: that its representa- tives are lacking in scholarly devotion to their subject, and that it is barren of practical result. As for the relation of philosophy to natural science, "philosophy has to humanise its facts, to look at them from the standpoint of complete and self-conscious human experience ".] W. A. Hammond. 'The Significance of the Creative Reason in Aris- totle's Philosophy.' [Aristotle's theory must be derived from his general epistemology, from the mneaning which he gives to ' form' and ' matter,' from the development of the Socratic-Sophistic controversy regarding conceptual and perceptual knowledge, and from special passages of the De Anima and the Analytics. His position mediates between the ultra-sensualism of the Sophists and the ultra-rationalism of Plato: the gulf between subject and object is bridged by the immanence of rational forms in empirical reality.] W. M. Urban. 'The Relation of the Individual to the Social Value-series.'-ii. [The introduction of the concept of complementary values into modern value theories promises to extend the range of quantitative conceptions to the ex- planation of purely inner personal values. But (1) the principle adopted by the economist-moralists to account for the phenomena of per- sonal sanction, anid for the absolute moment in the personal series, is not quantitative but Eesthetic and qualitative; (2) the ideal personal values that arise in the working out of the qualitative law of the in- dividual series have the absolute moment only in the Eesthetic isolation of the personality; they are more or less indifferent from the standpoint of the social series; and (3) the indefinite development of these personal values is so far independent of the social values and their mutations, is so much a function of the personality, that it may be realised irrespec- tively of the phenomenal content derived from the sphere of social values. How, then, do the moments differ out of which the value- function arises in the two spheres ? In the different role played in the two cases by the negative factor. "The difference between internal and external oppositions lies in the fact that, while in the external oppositions</page><page sequence="2">PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. 129 of social forces . . both moments in the opposition are in reality positives, and from the abstract quantitative point of view, either of them may be looked upon as positive or negative, in internal opposition . . . the positive is always an organised system of volitional tendencies, in opposition to which the negative is . . . a group of scattered particulars."] H.

'Prof. Fullerton's Doctrine of Space.' [The Berkeleyan doctrine does not recognise or admit a real space such as Fullerton sets up over against perceptual space; the division is made only to escape absurdities in the Berkeleyan view. Nor are the two varieties of space necessary or permissible in any con- sistent theory. Kaint meant by space the form, or law, of intuiting, as well as the product, or intuited space. It is the former element of which Kant thinks when he says that space is represented as an infinite given quantity. He may be wrong in using the term representation: but what he says must be interpreted in the light of his general standpoint, and not as if it were the teaching of a realist.] Reviews of Books.

Vol. ix., No. 3. J. Dewey. ' Interpreta- tion of Savage Mind.' [Comparison as currently employed is defective in three ways. It is used indiscriminately and arbitrarily; the haphazard selection yields only static facts; and the results reached, even if accu- rate, are loose aggregates of unrelated traits, not a coherent scheme of mind. We must look at the savage positively, not negativelyb as a system of lacks and absences of capability. And we may best classify by occu- pation. Take, e.g., the hunting life of the Australians. Here "want, effort, skill and satisfaction stand in the closest relations to one another; . . . immediacy of interest, attention and deed is the essential trait of the nomad hunter. . . . The hunting life is of necessity Qne of great emo- tional interest, and of adequate demand for acquiring and using highly specialised skills of sense, movement, ingenuity, strategy and comnbat." This mental pattern is carried over into all the relations of life, and becomes emotionally an assimilating medium: witness art, religious observances, practices in death and sickness, marriage customs. It is upon such a ground-pattern, then, that further genetic psychology must build.] G. S. Fullerton. ' The Atomic Self.' [The plain man is usually ready to maintain (1) that the mind exists within the body; (2) that it acts upon matter, and is acted on by matter; (3) that it is a substance with attributes; and (4) that it is non-extended and imnmaterial. The first three propositions look on mind after the analogy of a material atom; this view of mind is a semi-materialistic survival of ancient materialism. The fourth proposition, which makes the plain man's belief inconsistent, embodies the scholastic revolt against materialism. If stress is laid upon this fourth proposition the positive content furnished by the first three appears to be blotted out.] S. de Sanctis and U. Neyroz.

To the subjective consciousness there is, as a rule, no such difference; and where a differ- ence is felt, it can be satisfactorily accounted for by regard to the circum- stances under which the introspective testimony is apt to be right or wrong. Hence posthypnotic experiments strengthen the position of the determinist.] Psychological Literature. New Books. Notes. AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY. Vo1. xiii., No. 1. H. C. Stevens. 'Studies from the Psychological Laboratory of the University of Michigan. V. The Relation of the Fluctuations of Judgments in theEstimation of Time Intervals toVasomotor Waves.' [The vasomotor wave coincides, in at least 50 per cent. of the author's experiments, with fluctuation in the judgment of a time interval. For intervals above 3-7 sec. the strain of respiration may be employed as an aid to estimation. The method of single reproduc- tion tends to lower the indifference point. Intervals below 040 to 0 70 sec. (the limit differs with individuals and methods) are overestimated; intervals from this point to 2 40 sec. underestimnated; intervals from 3 70 to 7 24 sec. again overestimated. Weber's Law does not hold for the time sense. Temporal judgments in general are mediate, dependilng on organic processes, of which change in blood volume is one of the more important. Vasomotor change plays a predominant part in time up to 2 sec.; respiration strain comes in with longer intervals. These are, of course, not the only factors involved in interval estimation.] C. H. Sears. ' A Contribution to the Psychology of Rhythm.' [An experimnental study of the time values given by competent performers to the notes of several simple musical selections. Two successive executions of the same selec- tion (with short pause or without break) show a considerable temporal variation. In general, the second performance is the slower. The varia- tions of the measures are not constant ; and the relative length of the tones is also variable. In some cases there is marked lengthening of accented notes. There is a slight tenidenicy to make the second note of a triplet longer than the first, and a marked tendency to make the last longer than either of the others. Intervals occur between successive notes on the same degree and on different degrees of the staff. Overlaps are common and of varying length. Playing in parts does not ensure greater accuracy than playing the air alone. Meumann's view that the musician is aided by a motor appreciation in his rendering of the frac- tional parts of intervals is probably right; but his conjecture that, in playing with both hands, the one hand helps the other in giving the cor- rect relative length to time intervals is not borne out.] H. B. Woolston. ' Religious Emotion.' [The religious emotions atie dependent on certain constitutional and organic factors. They vary pretty constantly with certain meteorological conditions and with bodily rhythms. They are increased by the use of physical stimuli. Exaggerated religious emotion is connected with certain diseased nervous states. As to their office in the religious life, they have no value at all, " except as the inward reson- ance shows ready response of the nature to a certain sort of influence, and except as the excitation leads to a large and worthy effort ". In general, " religious emotion arouses the expansive manifestations of love, to which it is very much akin. And thus it leads to unselfish activity." Religion is also of va,lue in enforcing morality, and thus forming a strong social bond.] S. S. Colvin. 'The Psycholog,ical Necessity of Religion.' [Religion may be defined as the feeling of absolute dependence. It can never be transcended or eliminated, (1) because intelligence is not perfect, nor knowledge absolute; (2) because life is not and can never be satis-</page><page sequence="4">PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. 131 factory in itself.] R. MacDougall. 'Rhythm, Time and Number.' [The sensory rhythmisation of successive durations introduces always specific errors of estimation; it is only when the succession of intervals is not part of a rhythmical sequence that accurate comparison of their time values becomes possible. Moreover, every motor accompaniment of a series of regularly recurrent sensations tends to interfere with the proper estimation of the time valuies of their intervals, by becoming automatic. Nevertheless, it is on rhythmical processes, in the last analysis, that not only fsthetic apprehension, but also the sense of time itself depends. Contradiction appears, and the capacity of correct discrimnina- tion is destroyed, only when the intervals to be compared are bounded by dynamically unlike units. The estimation of time is based upon the phenomena of general attentive adjustment common to all the senses alike. The process of rhythmical integration is also involved in the numerical apprehension of serial irnpressions beyolnd very simple grouips. ' The limits of our capacity for estimating temporally extended periods or numerical series are to be looked for in the physiological laws which condition motor discharges on the one side, and make it possible or im- possible for us to imitate the objective series by a system of organic strains; and, on the other hand, in the limits placed upon our discrirnina- tion of refined experiences of strain due to perception-reflexes taking place in somne part of the bodily organism."] A.

'L'id'e moderne de la nature (difft6renciation, heredite, concurrence.') [Under these names describes the theories (1) of Milne Edwards that, 'as Darwin concludes,' 'the degree of superiority of an organised being is to be estimated according to the mnore or less perfect localisation and differentiation of its organs and their special adaptation to different functions'; (2) of Lamarck that the modifications in an organ, due to the parent's use or disuse of it, may be inherited; (3) of Darwin. Darwin explains the two facts which Edwards merely points out, narlely, the existence of a variety (a) of species, (b) of organs; and he points out a fact which Lamarck had neglected, namely, that the offspring of the same parents are born with differences which en- able some to survive better than others in the samne surroundings. The aceount of 'Natural Selection' is very clear and just and M. Bougle points out that the theory is purely 'mechanical' in spite of Darwin's 'anthropomorphic' language; but, in classing it as a completionl of the mechanical explanation begun in (1) and (2), he neglects the fact that (1) contains no explanation at all, either mechanical or ' finalistic,' and that the only fact, of which (2) fails to give a mechanical explanation, namely the individuals power of adaptation to its environment, is also not explained by Darwin. M. Bougl6's object is to prepare for discus- sing the relation of this 'mechanical conception of Nature' to Ethics; but the fact that under his 'theory of differentiation' he fails to dis- ting,uish the ethical judgment, 'differentiation is a sign of superiority,' from the historical fact that differentiation has increased is only one instance of many confusions which his remarks on this subject betray.] G. Cantecor. 'La morale ancienne et la morale moderne.' [A recent 'study' of M. Brochard's holds that the ancients did not use the notions of 'moral law,' 'duty,' etc., so prevalent in modern Ethics; that hence these notions are 'factitious' and of 'theological origin'. M. Cantecor will submit that they are 'necessary anid true,' and will explain why, in spite of this, the ancients did not recognise them, and that their connexion with theology and metaphysics is due to misunderstanding. I. To believe in a moral law is only to believe 'that there is an authority, for man, distinct from his desires'; and this notion is logically implied in that of ' good,' since ' the good' means ' what we ought to will'. rThe Greeks, having begun by -an appeal to 'reason' against 'external autho- rity,' naturally did not see (sic) that reason itself is an ' external authority' in relation to our 'individual nature' and our will: moreover, as was</page><page sequence="7">134 PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. natural, they only tried to 'define the ideal,' without asking the ' critical' question, 'How does there come to be an ideal at all?' This true philosophical method, which consists in investigating 'form' before its objects, was at first applied, even by the moderns, to 'theoretical' questions only: Shaftesbury and Hutcheson began that application of it to morality which was successfully carried out by Kant. II. Kant's real meaning (confusedly expressed and much misunderstood) is that to act on universal principles is to act reasonably: hence his moral law is ' a datum or act of reason,' not the action of a ' mysterious (theological) and arbitrary authority': he proves it, too, by showing that it alone ' makes possible' the admitted fact that we judge things to be good and evil. It is an 'authority' merely because 'reason' cannot deny that what is ' reasonable' should be done. A very poor article.] J. Wilbois. 'L'esprit positif.' [Continued from March number. II., Facts. (1) Mill's four rules of induction only apply to facts of the kind observed by ' common sense,' i.e., definite given individuals; hence they are too 'infallible' (!): he and Comte did not understand the nature of the 'facts' with which modern physics deals. (2) The success of this science depends upon ex- actness of measurement, and, in proportion as our instruments are more exact, we have both (a) to make our experiments under extremely com- plicated conditions, and (b) to 'correct' our numerical results; but we cannot define either the conditions or the method of correction, which we actually choose, and our choice is only one of infinite possible alterna- tives: hence a 'scientific fact' is both 'indeterminate' and 'created by us'. Our choice is (and ought to be) guided by (3) the beauty of an experiment or formula ('analogy' and 'simplicity' are only ambiguous expressions for certain forms of beauty); and by (4) 'the sense of pro- gress' or ' of principles' = the desire to generalise a law, which is itself 'never universal or infinitely precise,' but is felt as a 'tendency'. (5) Of Comte's ' three stages,' the first two are marked by ' a refusal to act upon nature': the ' positive stage' (exemplified by nineteenth century phvsics) contains in itself more 'variety' than the other two put together; 'the positive spirit in physics ' may be ' defined ' as ' a spirit of invention wbich seizes, in a fact, the evolution of a principle, which is itself a means of possessing and unifying the given under a mathematical form'. (6) Both the 'Idealism of Liberty' and 'Mechanical Realismn' are mistaken, the former because 'matter has certain habits,' the latter because its habits may change from time to time. Matter is (a) a mere ' potentiality,' its 'determinism' at any one time being the result of our ancestors' 'liberty, but (b) it has a 'final cause,' which is 'the activity of the man of science,' and the final cause of this, again, is ' virtue'. Thus ' scientific induction' is ' a durable act of the human race': it consists in 'ob- taining the intuition of matter,' which can only be done by escaping from 'the illusion of space and time' and '\replacing ourselves in pure duration'. (7) Summary.] Enseignement. Questions Pratiques. Supplement. L'ANNE'E PHILOSOPHIQUE (lime annee), 1900. Redact. general, F. Pillon. Bibliotheque de philos. contemp. Paris: Felix Alcan. Pp. 1-131, Articles; pp. 133-314, Reviews. This number of M. Pillon's magazine contains four articles of a general nature: one by M. Brochard on 'The Myths in 2Plato's Philosophy,' another by M. Hamelin on 'One of the Sources of Spinozism,' a third by M. Dauriac, 'An Essay on the Categories,' and the fourth by M. Pillon on ' Bayle's Criticism of Car- tesianism'. M. Brochard, in a short paper, points out that the myth is not alien to the spirit of Plato's philosophy, does not lessen its dialectical value, but is merely a garb which it can conveniently assume to clothe</page><page sequence="8">PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. 135 its ideas. The second article contains a mere suggestion that Spinoza must have been influenced very largely by Aristotle, in virtue of the fact that Hebrew philosophy, as represented, e.g., by Maimonides, was de- rived mainly from Aristotle through the Syrian and Arabian teachers and writers. Some striking parallels between Spinoza and Aristotle are mentioned to give cogency to this contention. M. Dauriac's essay is somewhat rambling and inconclusive. He dismisses the universal validity of the categories, insists on their " contingency," and then seems to bring back most or all that he has taken away from them by explaining that they "participate " in " necessity ". The last article is a continuation of a series on the same subject which has appeared in preceding numbers of the magazine. It is a very thorough analysis of some of Descartes fundamental conceptions, and a cautious review of Bayle's criticism. Amongst other points, one of considerable interest may be mentioned. Bayle's interpretation of substance varies through- out his criticism of Descartes, the truth being that he had in view two quite distinct conceptions of substance and did not see his way out of the difficulties presented by both. One was derived from scholastic Aristotelianism, the other from the new philosophy initiated by Des- cartes. According to the former substance is a kind of neutrum which can appear with different or even any attributes, and may hence be stripped of all,-which makes any distinction between spiritual and material substance ultimately valueless. According to the latter it is held that attributes cannot be separated realite from substances at all, that they are the essence of substance, that extension, e.g., and matter are one and the same thing, and that thus there may be different sub- stances, but no remainder which is equally something or nothing. That this distinction has a very important bearing not merely on questions of nominalism and realism but also on most metaphysical questions need hardly be pointed out. ZEITSCHRIFT FUR PSYCHOLOGIE UND PHYSIOLOGIE DER SINNESORGANE. Bd. xxviii., Heft 3 und 4. T. Lipps. ' Einige psychologische Streitpunkte.' [Three criticisms of Ebbinghaus. (1) Ebbinghaus's theory of fusion leads, if taken literally, to the absurdity that fusion is grounded in an enhancement of qualitative distinctness or independence. An examina- tion of Stumpf, Wundt and Ebbinghaus leads to the conclusion that the true basis of fusion lies in the congruent rhythms of the (unconscious) psychical processes which underlie sensation. (2) There is no such thing as a ' sensation' of motion, or of tension or weight. Innervation sensa- tions are to be replaced, not by ' muscle' sensations, but by certain ego- experiences, effort feelings, Strebungsgefilhle. The point is sustained by appeal to pathology. (3) The relation of similarity is nothing sensa- tional, not a general characteristic of sensation, but an apperceptive experience; a predicate of two or more contents, e.g., of the two colours, red and violet, "wenn ich sie zusammennehme ". It is not given, as attribute of the colours, wvhen these themselves are given.] E. Wiersma. ' Untersuchungen iiber die sogennanten Aufmerksamkeitsschwankungen.' -ii. [(1) Practice in mental work at a definite time of day appears to influence capacity of perception; if this is the case, then the time of greater mental achievement may be shifted, despite an original dis- position. The large differences of perceptual capacity at different times of day make it necessarv to experiment always at the same hour, if one is seeking to estimate mental achievement. (2) Capacity of perception is seriously reduced by mental and physical exertion. (3) The taking of 10 grammes of absolute alcohol reduces capacity of perception; fatigue soon makes its appearance. (4) The taking of 3 gramme; of bromide of</page><page sequence="9">136 PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. sodium-i increases perceptual capacity, not only on the day itself but for the following day as well. The effect may be due to the removal of excitatory influences.] E. Kalischer. ' Analyse der aesthetischen Con- templation: Plastik und Malerei.' [By 'aesthetic contemplation ' is nmeant the mental process which may be termed specifically 'esthetic. The mental attitude in contemplation is a psychological anomaly: there is intensive concentration of attention, while yet the normal range of consciousness (Eftge des Bewusstseins) is transcended. Attention is focussed upon sensory impressions which, as part-contents of highly complex ideas, possess so great a power of reproduction that a minimnum of sense datum releases a maximum of intellectual process. There is thus a peculiar relation established between the elements of conscious- ness and the complexes whose parts they are: between rnental force or power and mental process or occurrence. All our mental force is collected in our concentration upon the sensory impressions ; but what the senses receive is minimal in comparison with the range and number of ideas which the imzlpressions arouse, and which develop as if under muechanical stimulus, without the active participation of the psyche. The author seeks to explain the anomnaly by drawing a parallel between the condi- tions governing certainty and regularity of reproduction and those governing artistic contemplation. The reproduced ideas (1) appear only in indirect vision and (2) possess concrete universality. The theory which most nearly approaches the author's, in spite of its radically different formulation, is that worked out by K. Lange in his Die bewusste Selbsttaeuschung als Kern des aesthetischen Genusses, 18P95.] A. Fontana. 'Ueber die Wirkung des Eucain-B auf die Geschmack- sorgane.'

It has various ad- vantages over cocaine, if it is not altogether as effective. For all but bitter tastes, its operation must be controlled before experimentation, owing to individual differences.] A. Bernstein. 'Bemerkung zu der Arbeit von Dr. E.

A universally valid aesthetics is an ideal, to be approximated at best in the fundamental chapters of an A3sthetics, in no wise attainable in the portions that deal with the several Eesthetic departments. But in spite of this double linlitation, one may not speak of a genetic ' method ' or ' foundation ' in aesthetics.

Such a working-over implies, of course, constant reference to ,objects of nature and of art, of all times and places; but genetic argu- ments play a very small part indeed in it. Some aid is rendered, further, by the changes of meaning in words. Darwinistic questions are entirely out of place; they are to be raised only in the genetic portion of, aesthetics.] E. Storch. 'Ueber das rNumliche Sehen.' [Monocular vision tells us nothing of the true magnitude, distance or form of an object. These determinations, when correctly made, depend on the co-excitation of spatial experiences otherwise obtained (principally from the sense of touch). Binocular vision improves upon monocular only in the fact that it gives us (within certain limits) sensory data regarding the relative distance (relative before and behind) of the parts of the seen object. It, too, requires the support and refinement of extrinsic space experience. It, follows that a visual form which, in consequence of such experience, is always or usually apprehended as a symbol of a deter- minate real form, will bring this real form to consciousness even when attendant circumstances demand a different spatial interpretation. If the meaning put upon the visual form be not in accord with reality, we have what is called an 'optical illusion' before us. The author works out his theory, following Filehne, by reference to the best-known op- tical illusions.] Besprechung. [J. Cohn on Ostwald's Vorlesungen i,ber Naturphilosophie.] Literaturbericht.

Hence all psychical facts are determined by their bodily concomitants. The simultaneity of conditions and conditioned holds for all unambiguous determination. This theory of parallelism is not to be taken as having metaphysical implications.] Emil Bullaty. ' Das Bewusstseinsproblem.'

[An Exposition of the Philosophy of F. Evellin, mainly in the form of a series of extracts from his writings.

To this distinction there corresponds an ultimaate division of philosophical points of view.] KANTSTUDIEN. Bd. vi., Heft 4. A. Gallinger. 'Zum Streit uiber das Grundproblem der Ethik in der neueren philosophischen Lit- teratur.' [(1) Defends Kant's Categorical Imperative, in the form 'Act so that you can always will the maxim of your will as a universal law,' against objections, and tries to show (2) that every ethical inquiry must presuppose some supreme criterion of moral action, and (3) that a consistent application of any other criterion than Kant's Law leads to conflict with actual moral judgments. To show (3) we have mainly a long critique of Paulsen and a short one of Gizycki, and to show (2) mainly critiques of Simmel and Stern: (1) also includes short critiques of Windelband, Jodl and Brentano. The author shows conclusively that these writers have neglected most important distinctions; but he seems himself blind to others equally important, and is grossly unfair in some of his objections to Paulsen. His defence of Kant's formula is highly- ingenious and novel (based, he says, on Lipps): he assumes that 'can will' refers to a psychological fact, namely, that we all always will the same universal rules of action, and that 'under like circumstances' refers only to those among the actual circumstances which we take into account; by which two definitions (which Kant certainly never intended) he makes, it plausible that all normal moral judgments could be deduced from his formula: but he seems quite unconscious, that by thus restricting the meaning of the Imperative and by making it a mere criterion, he destroys its relevancy to two other problems which Kant certainly intended to solve, (1) the definition of what 'right' means (2) the proof that obedi--</page><page sequence="12">PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. 139 ence to the Imperative is not only consistent with moral common sense but necessarily right. Again he fails to see that, even if his formula expresses a correct analysis of the psychical event, which we call ' a moral choice,' we mean, by so calling it, not only that it is of this nature, but also that it is ' right' in another and more ultimate sense, in which its rightness does depend on its results.] R. Reininger. 'Das Causal- problem bei Hume und Kant.' [Quite worthless: the writer has utterly failed to distinguish the various questions which he pretends to answer. He sees both clearly and truly only (a) that both Hume and Kant thought all causal judgments synthetic; (b) that Hume tried to explain why we believe that one thing will follow another, and (G) denied the possibility of proving the existence of necessary connexion (in some sense) between any two events; finally (d) that Kant does not deny Hume's explana- tion (b), but tries to prove, what Hume declares indemnonstrable (c), by the 'metaphysical hypothesis' that 'our understanding gives laws to nature'. On these data H. Reininger seems not unnaturally to conclude, that Hume's theory is true in all essentials, and that Kant, instead of refuting him, has only made a brilliant suggestion in answer of an insolu- able problem which Hume did not attack. Everything else is either vague or untrue or both. E.g., he tells us Hume and Kant are agreed that ' the basis of special causal judgments is experience,' without a hint that, whereas Kant means by it ' experience is necessary to teach us what is necessarily connected with what; but it does teach us truly,' Hume means the following tangle of contradictions ' experience causes us to believe that two things are necessarily connected; but there is no reason to believe that any two things are so; and even if the two things in ques- tion were so, experience does not cause us to beheve that they are so, since it only causes the expectation of the one to be necessarily connected with the perception of the other.'] Recensionen, etc.</page></plain_text>
