St. John's University Collegeville, MN 56321 The place where sovereignty resides has been a perennially significant issue in political theory.1 When a nation is fighting for survival against an invading army, it is critical to know who makes the decisions that all must follow. In a monarchically organized community, the king is the decision maker. If this king were to be taken into exile and could no longer function as a king - as was the case with Jehoiachin of Judah in 597 b.c. - then the community of exiles who recognize him as their legitimate king would have to reorganize or be destroyed.2 In 591 b.c., the prophet Ezekiel reported that Yhwh had sworn that he himself would gather the exiles from the nations and be king Qemlôk) over them (Ezek 20:33).3 After the destruction of Jerusalem in 587 b.c., Ezekiel encouraged the exiles in Babylon with these words of Yhwh: "I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will 1 Bertrand de Jouvenal, Sovereignty : An Inquiry into the Political Good (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1959) 21; F.

Duguid ( Ezekiel and the Leaders of Israel [VTSup56; Leiden: Brill, 1994] 24) notes that nowhere in the Book of Ezekiel is Zedekiah (597-587 b.c.), Jehoiachin' s successor as king of Jerusalem, entitled melek. 3 This single occurrence of the root mlk used as a verb in Ezekiel is strategically located at the conclusion of Ezekiel's history of Israel's idolatrous ways (Ezek 20:5-31) and introduces Yhwh's promise that he will gather them from the nations, bring them to judgment in the wilderness, and reign over them as king (Ezek 20:33-38). On Yhwh as the divine sovereign ruler in Ezekiel, see Franz Sedlmeier, Studien zu Komposition und Theologie von Ezechiel 20 (SBB 21; Stuttgart: Katholisches Bibelwerk, 1990) 348-49; Walther Eichrodt, Ezekiel: A Commentary (OTL; Philadelphia: Westmin- ster, 1970) 24. 361</page><page sequence="2">362 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 66, 2004 make them lie down" (Ezek 34:15). Even though Ezekiel referred to Yhwh' s raising up a Davidic prince {nāšV, 34:24) as shepherd, he emphasized that it was Yhwh who would exercise sovereign care over the people of Israel as their shep- herd.4 A key issue for the prophet Ezekiel was how to convince the exiles that Yhwh functioned as king over them even though his earthly representative, Jehoiachin, no longer held power. The common royal theology of the ancient Near East was based on the convic- tion that the configuration of power in the earthly realm reflected the configuration of power in the heavenly realm. This traditional model of royal authority mapped out the relations between the divine and human realms as follows: the king of the gods first chose an earthly king to rule over a particular people or territory and then both supported this earthly king and held him accountable.5 This traditional model of royal authority is pervasive in the texts of biblical Israel (e.g., 1 Sam 9: 15- 10:1; 10:17-25; Pss 78:70-72; 89:20-38) and in the royal inscriptions of ancient Mesopotamia (e.g., the inscriptions of Samsuiluna [1749-1712 b.c.; RIME 4, E4.3.7.5, lines 1-24] and of Marduk-apla-iddina II [721-710, 703 b.c.; RIMB 2, B.6.21.1, lines 8-15].6 With the deportations of Judahites to Babylon in 597 and 587, it appeared that the deity of Nebuchadnezzar II, Marduk, ruled over Judah and its people, rather than Yhwh. The Judahite exiles reflected poorly upon the reputation and power of Yhwh (Ezek 36:22-23; cf. 20:9, 14, 22). Ezekiel proclaimed that the earthly realities of his time did not accurately mirror the configuration of power in the heavenly realm, where Yhwh was king. He claimed that Yhwh would rule directly over the exiles (20:33; 34:15), which would reduce (37:24-25) or elimi- nate (34:24; 45:7-9; 46:4-8, 10, 12-18) the rule of an earthly king in the restored Israel. He urged the exiles to recognize that Yhwh ruled not only over the kings of Babylon (17:12; 24:2; 26:7; 29:18, 19; 30:24, 25; 32:11), Tyre (28:12), and Egypt (29:2, 3; 30:21, 22; 3 1 :2) but also over the forces of life and death (37: 1-14).7 4 Duguid ( Ezekiel and the Leaders of Israel, 25-26) argues that the two instances where melek designates the Davidic ruler in Ezek 37:22, 24 are countered immediately in 37:25 by a reference to the Davidic ruler as nāšV. The future Davidic ruler in the restoration will not be like the rulers of the past, for Yhwh is envisioned as having a more direct role in the governance of the people. 5 Dale Launderville, Piety and Politics: The Dynamics of Royal Authority in Homeric Greece, Biblical Israel, and Old Babylonian Mesopotamia (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2003) 1-6. 6 RIME = Douglas Frayne, Old Babylonian Period, 2003-1595 BC (Royal Inscriptions of Mesopotamia: Early Periods 4; Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1990); RIMB = Grant Frame, Rulers of Babylonia: From the Second Dynasty of I sin to the End of Assyrian Domination, 1157-612 BC (Royal Inscriptions of Mesopotamia: Babylonian Periods 2; Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1995). 7 Lawrence Boadt, "The Dramatic Structure of Ezekiel 37,1-14," in Palabra, Prodigio, Poesía: In Memoriam P.

The concrete, tangible symbol of Yhwh's sovereignty before 587 B.c. was the cherubim throne in the Jerusalem temple (1 Kgs 8:7). In Ezekiel's inaugural vision, this cherubim throne was transformed into the mental model of a complex throne-chariot with four composite humanoid creatures as throne bearers whose movement extended beyond sacred space.8 Ezekiel spiritualized political power not only by accenting its invisible dimension but also by showing how the human perception of such power demanded greater interiorization, for it required a new heart and spirit to recognize Yhwh's power and to avoid distorting it into idolatrous forms (Ezek 11:19; 36:25-27).9 A primary aspect of this process of spiritualization in the Book of Ezekiel is the manner in which the complex imagery of the throne-chariot and of the action of the spirit in Ezekiel 1 coalesces to create a sense of the incomprehen- sible, yet accessible presence of Yhwh.10 This visionary movement by Ezekiel beyond images bears similarities to the intellectual movement in pre-Socratic philosophy in archaic Greece (700-480 b.c.) that turned aside from the use of the statues and rituals in the religion of the Greek polis toward the use of abstract concepts for understanding cosmic order. To shed further light on Ezekiel' s efforts to interiorize the exiles' understanding of Yhwh's sovereign power, I will com- pare Ezekiel' s ways of speaking about a reality beyond appearances with those of Anaximander. Even though the prophet Ezekiel and the philosopher Anaxi- mander worked in different cultures, each in his own distinctive approach created a mental model of invisible reality that called into question polytheistic cultic systems for explaining order in the world. I. Ezekiel' s Inaugural Vision: A Glimpse into the Transcendent Character of Yhwh's Sovereignty At the beginning of his ministry, Ezekiel received an overwhelming vision by the river Chebar that helped him reimagine how Yhwh would exercise sov- ereignty among the exiles. Yhwh enthroned on the cherubim was a central image in the Judahite tradition portraying Yhwh as king; but the description of the Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1983) 57-58; Walther Zimmerli, Ezekiel: A commentary on the Book of the Prophet Ezekiel, vol. 1 (trans.

One might characterize the enthronement on the cherubim, accordingly, as both anthropomorphic and aniconic.11 The visions of Yhwh as an enthroned king in Exod 24:9-11; Isa 6:1; and 1 Kgs 22:19 do not venture a description of Yhwh' s being except to suggest that he was a royal figure on a throne. In Ezek 1:26-28, the visionary dares to describe the divine being seated on what appeared to be ( dëmût ) a sapphire-like (kěmaťěh ^eben sappîr) throne above the platform. Ezekiel blurs the outlines of the enthroned Yhwh by speaking of this figure as "a likeness like the appearance of a human" (dëmût kemar^ēh 3 ādām , 1:26b), as if his picture were out of focus. Then he describes the electric, fiery appearance of this figure: "I saw what looked like electrum, like fire enclosing all around, from what appeared to be his loins upward; and from what appeared to be his loins downward, I saw what looked like fire; and brightness surrounded him" (Ezek 1:27). Ezekiel uses kemar^eh seven times (1:13, 14, 26, 27, 28) and dëmût ten times (1:5, 10, 13, 16, 22, 26, 28) in Ezekiel 1 to highlight his para- doxical task of trying to represent the unrepresentable glory of his divine vision (marmot 3 elõhím , 1 : l).12 For Ezekiel, it was imperative to communicate that Yhwh was not absent from his throne; he had not been forced to abdicate, as the destruc- tion of the temple in Jerusalem would have indicated to the typical ancient Near Eastern observer.13 Ezekiel undergirds his picture of Yhwh as sovereign by first sketching out the complex throne-chariot on which Yhwh rides through the heavens. At the beginning of the prophet's vision, a great storm cloud came from the north with flashing fire and brightness. This powerful, moving cloud, composed of wind, fire, and brightness, traditionally served as a conveyance for a thunderstorm deity in the ancient Near East (cf. Pss 18:11; 68:5). Ezekiel elaborates on the components of this cloud by describing the "likeness" (dëmût) of four living creatures that were on each side of this cloud: "their appearance (mar^ehen) was something like (dëmût) that of a human" (1:5). Ezekiel initially seems to give these creatures the 11 Ibid., 25. 12 dëmût ("likeness, appearance, form") assumes a more abstract meaning in exilic texts (H. D. Preuss, " dāmāh ; dëmût h," TDOT, 3. 250-60, here 257). Of the fifteen instances of the masculine mar^eh in Ezekiel 1, seven are qualified by kë-. Also in the strategic verse Ezek 1:26b, the enthroned Yhwh is described as "a likeness (dëmût) like the appearance (këmar^eh) of a human." With these terms, Ezekiel emphasizes the limitations of the linguistic description and artistic representation of the visionary reality of Yhwh and his throne-chariot (pace Margaret Odell, "Ezekiel Saw What He Said He Saw: Genres, Forms, and the Vision of Ezekiel 1," in The Changing Face of Form Criticism for the Twenty-First Century [ed.

Sweeney and Ehud Ben Zvi; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2003] 162-76, here 169-74). 13 John Strong, "God's Kabod: The Presence of Yahweh in the Book of Ezekiel," in The Book of Ezekiel: Theological and Anthropological Perspectives (ed.

Each had four faces, of a human, a lion, an ox, and an eagle; each had four wings, with human hands under its wings; each had extended or straight legs with the soles of its feet shaped like those of calves and glittering like burnished bronze (1:6-8, 10-11). As Ezekiel observed these four creatures, two of their wings were extended to touch those of the other creatures and two covered their bodies (1:9, 11; cf. Isa 6:2). 14 The four faces of each creature looked straight ahead without turning to one side or the other (1:9, 12). These composite creatures had important characteristics for serving and defending the divine throne: intelligence, fierceness, strength, fertility, and swift- ness.15 As faces that could look only straight ahead, how would the four comple- ment one another? Were they simply pieced together as static components of a statue?16 Ezekiel solves the riddle of giving life and movement to these statue-like creatures by having the spirit direct them: "wherever the spirit (hãrúah) would go, they would go, not turning aside in their movement" (1:12).17 As composite creatures with human and animal characteristics, they symbolized beings that moved between the divine realm and the human realm;18 however, no one of these creatures directed the movement of the throne-chariot. Even though they had a human appearance, human intelligence did not govern the throne-chariot. The spirit {hãruah), which can be etymologically associated with the storm wind ( ruah separa, 1:4) within the thunderhead, provided a more pervasive, elusive, and spiritual form of guidance to the throne-chariot than any of the four faces could offer. None of these creatures could rebel, for they would have been immobilized without the spirit. Here, Ezekiel seems to prepare a counterpoint to his later description of the king of Tyre, who had come to regard himself as a god and had thereby defaulted in his role as cherub (i.e., guardian of the divine sovereignty) and had destroyed himself through his hubris (Ezek 28: 16-19). 19 The four composite creatures are more complex than the single cherub in Eden in Ezek 14 Mettinger ( Dethronement of Sabaoth, 36) states that the extended wings of the cherubim communicated the paradox of static movement. Othmar Keel (, Jahwe-Visionen und Siegelkunst : Eine neue Deutung der Majestätsschilderungen in Jes 6, Ez 1 und 10 und Sach 4 [SBS 84/85; Stuttgart: Katholisches Bibelwerk, 1977] 271) speculates that the four creatures, each with four wings, may symbolize the four cosmic winds. 15 Daniel I.

Each one, left to itself apart from the guidance of the spirit, would be immobilized by the countervailing forces of the four faces. The personal agency of these semidivine creatures would thus be ineffective without the infusion of the spirit.20 Ezekiel then contrasts, even to the point of contradiction, the coordinated movement of these complex creatures of the throne-chariot with their fiery, lightning- like motions.21 The appearance of the creatures was something like flaming coals, burning like torches; it was moving back-and-forth among the creatures. The fire was brilliant; and from the fire, lightning was going forth. The living creatures were darting22 back and forth like lightning.23 (1:13-14) When the creatures moved their wings, it sounded like thunder (1:24); Ezekiel thus highlights their divine power and dynamism. They had among them the power of the thunderstorm.24 In a second look at this throne-chariot (wa'ere* . . . wěhinněh, 1:15), Ezekiel describes the four wheels that stood next to the creatures, one for each of them.25 The structure within each wheel gave it the appearance of a wheel within a wheel.26 The tall rims of these wheels, which reached down from the cloud to the ground, were filled with eyes. The wheels could move in any direction, but the movement of each one followed that of the creature next to it, for "the spirit of the creatures27 was in the wheels" (1 :20). The wheels gave the throne-bearing vehicle the appear- ance of a chariot and so accented the mobility of Yhwh' s throne.28 The four complex creatures with the wheels beside them formed the base of the throne- chariot, upon which a crystalline slab (1:22) was placed, which, in turn, carried what looked like Yhwh's sapphire throne (1:26). Ezekiel indicates that he had seen the parts of this chariot in visions (1:1,4, 15), but he qualifies his descriptions as approximations. Through the genre of the vision report, Ezekiel introduces a dreamlike context for the bold anthropomor- phism of his description of Yhwh. He also signals the nonliteral character of his 20 Eichrodt, Ezekiel, 57. 21 Greenberg, Ezekiel 1-20, 48, 58. 22 Read rãs. 23 Read habbãrãq with Vg., Tg., Sym. 24 Keel, Jahwe-Visionen und Siegelkunst, 143. 25 Since galgai ("wheel") can refer to a cloud (e.g., Ps 77:19), Mettinger {Dethronement of Sabaoth, 105) argues on the grounds of the imagery of the theophanic tradition that 1:15-21 was not added by an editor.

II. Directed by Yhwh' s Spirit: The Workings of Political Power Recontextualized Ezekiel' s emphasis on the symbolic character of Yhwh' s throne makes Yhwh' s royal rule over Israel, in the prophet's description, less visible and direct in its historical manifestations than would be expected in the rule of the king of the gods over a typical ancient Near Eastern kingdom. Ezekiel had to alter radically the people's understanding of the link between the power of the Davidic ruler and the power of Yhwh as sovereign in the heavenly sphere. He retains the royal model of rule where personal agency and cosmic power are joined in ordering the world, but he frees this divine royal rule from its ties to an earthly king or dynasty. This alteration was not simply a return to the premonarchic times of tribal Israel (see 1 Samuel 8); Ezekiel claims that Israel's problems with idolatry and its incapacity to understand the workings of Yhwh' s divine power even predated the exodus from Egypt (Ezek 20:5-8). The exiles could not forge an appropriate relationship with Yhwh simply by resuscitating an old theocratic model; they had to have Yhwh draw them out from the nations and judge them in the wilderness - divine actions resembling those of the exodus but even more radical (Ezek 20:33-38).30 If the repatriates were to resist assimilation into the surrounding nations, they could not expect simply to be restored to the Judean hill country to live a tribal way of life with a low level of institutionalization (see Ezek 20:32).31 Yhwh's future actions of gathering and judging would be an important step toward interior- izing the exiles' relationship with him as their ruler. Ezekiel' s visionary experience gave him a new standpoint from which to understand the interplay between heavenly and earthly royal rule in the ancient Near East. When Israel adopted the institution of kingship, it did so in the midst 29 Allen, Ezekiel 1-19, 35-36. In addition, the fact that Ezekiel is using the verbal medium rather than a material medium to communicate his image of Yhwh and the throne-bearing creatures moves his description another degree away from pretending to describe what Yhwh looks like (see J. P. Vernant, "The Birth of Images," in idem, Mortals and Immortals: Collected Essays [Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1991] 164-85, here 168).

The memory of this debate in Israel's tradition legiti- mated the prophet's questioning of the king's claims that his policies and deci- sions were sanctioned by God.32 However, the exilic community probably had less capacity to absorb polarization and fragmentation than had the earlier, monarchic- ally governed community. As a visionary who had consumed a scroll from Yhwh and presumably had written many of his prophetic messages prior to their delivery,33 Ezekiel was able to introduce the exiles to a more interiorized way of under- standing their relationship to Yhwh and a more spiritualized understanding of their bonds with one another as Yhwh' s people (see Ezek 34:11-31; 36:22-32). Ezekiel's call (1:1-3:15) was like a rite of passage.34 He was overcome by the vision of Yhwh enthroned above the four living creatures (1:28) and was revived by "spirit" ( ruah , 2:2) so that he might listen to Yhwh' s commission. The scroll that he consumed gave him a message from Yhwh that he was to speak (2:8-3:3).35 As the creatures on the throne-chariot had their movements directed by the spirit (1:20), so also was Ezekiel to be directed by the word of Yhwh.36 But whereas the composite creatures on the throne-chariot were portrayed as having no freedom, Ezekiel still had to choose to obey Yhwh' s commands, as is shown by Yhwh' s admonition that the unfaithful Israelites would perish if their prophet, as watchman, failed to deliver the divine word to them by way of warning (3:16-21). The powerful visitations of the spirit thatEzekiel experienced made him a person who knew clearly Yhwh' s challenging commands for a people in the midst of a crisis (3:14). These challenging, transforming personal experi- ences moved Ezekiel to a new location from which to articulate his vision of Yhwh' s sovereign rule. Those who would understand his message would have to walk into his world and allow their experiences to be shaped by Yhwh' s spirit and this new vision.37 32 Frank Criisemann, Der Widerstand gegen das Königtum: Die antiköniglichen Texte des Alten Testamentes und der Kampf um den frühen israelitischen Staat (WMANT 49; Neukirchen-Vluyn: Neukirchener Verlag, 1978) 13-15; Baruch Halpern, "The Uneasy Compromise: Israel Between League and Monarchy," in Traditions in Transformation: Turning Points in Biblical Faith (Festschrift for Frank Moore Cross; ed.

Co-opted Cultic Statues: Blocks to the Transcendent The new world envisioned by Ezekiel demanded the removal of idols ( gillu - lîm) and the purgation of defilements (tumšot, 36:25). Ezekiel railed against the idolatry he observed in Jerusalem: the image that provoked jealousy (8:3), the secret worship of animal images and idols (8: 10-12), and the worship of Tammuz (8:14) and of the sun (8:16). These departures from exclusive devotion to Yhwh reflected the people's failure to trust in Yhwh' s sovereign rule.38 For Ezekiel, the sin of idolatry lay in putting someone or something "before Yhwh" (Ezek 20:5-8; cf. Exod 20:3; Deut 5:7), thus compromising the integrity of the covenant relation- ship.39 The fabrication and worship of images occurred within both polytheistic and monotheistic systems as a means of identifying important issues in life and seeking help from the divine sphere. Figurines have been recovered from the sites of various cultures from the Neolithic Age to the present era.40 There is, it seems, something natural about humans identifying a primary concern and appealing for assistance to an anthropomorphic analogue of the divine.41 In the sphere of the Greek family, this practice of making statues and using them to appeal to the gods seems to have maintained a symbolic character: the statues pointed beyond themselves to an invisible reality and tended not to become ends in themselves.42 Worshipers in a home would sacrifice and pay homage to a household god, believing that this would bring engagement with the divine, sometimes in a more dramatic, epiphanic way.43 In the Greek world of the eighth century B.c. to the seventh, the religion of the polis began to emerge, characterized by the construction of temples and the 38 On Ezekiel' s adherence to the principle of worship of Yhwh alone, see Andrew Mein, Ezekiel and the Ethics of Exile (Oxford Theological Monographs; Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001) 101-2, 108-9. 39 Eichrodt, Ezekiel, 27-29. 40 Lynn Meskell, "Twin Peaks: The Archaeologies of Çatalhõyuk," in Ancient Goddesses: The Myths and the Evidence (ed.

Statuary in Greece developed rapidly from rather roughly carved figures for private devotion in the Geometric Age (900-700 B.c.) to the strikingly beautiful marble and bronze sculptures of the Archaic (700-480 b.c.) and Classical (480-323 b.c.) Ages.45 The Greeks saw these statues as representing the gods because of their enduring beauty and grace; the statue came to be seen more as an image, a representation, of the god than as a symbol of the divine presence.46 The immortals represented by the statues did not diminish with age; their glory was not ephemeral as human glory was, though humans might, at certain unique moments in their lives, embody divine characteristics. The Archaic Greeks thought of humans as theomorphic by design, but the heights of excellence were only rarely attained. This theomorphic view of humans paved the way for the creation of statuary that would celebrate the excellence of the athlete, the beauty of the young woman, and the strength of a warrior.47 The rapid construction of temples in Greece in the seventh and sixth centuries b.c. and the temple's displacement of the altar as the focal point of the Greek sanctuary signaled the growing importance of monumentality in the religion of the polis.48 The city-states, inspired by the monuments of Egypt, competed with one another in the construction of imposing temples and gigantic statues. This was the time of an emerging Panhellenic consciousness, and cities wanted to testify to the quality and power of their own communities by the construction of beautiful, inspiring religious and civic spaces.49 The various Greek gods, bearing traditions 44 Catherine Morgan, Athletes and Oracles : The Transformation of Olympia and Delphi in the Eight Century B.C.

The religion of the polis in Archaic Greece was run by the city assembly and not by a hereditary priesthood. When the activity of building temples and creating cultic statues developed through ideas and practices borrowed from the cities of the ancient Near East, the Greek city began to shape pantheons that systematized the people's access to the divine.51 Previously, the symbolic function of figurines and statues within the household and private cults was to facilitate encounters with an invisible spiritual world beyond the visible world; but this symbolic function was in danger of being eclipsed by the system of the polis, in which individual deities were meaningful only insofar as they worked in divine concert to cover the whole range of primary concerns of the polis.52 A cultic statue could point to a deeper spiritual reality, indeed, but only to one that was contextualized and interpreted by the religious system of the polis, which tended to harness the individual deities to the civic agenda. Ezekiel' s predecessors, especially Elijah (1 Kings 18-19), Hosea (Hosea 8), and Jeremiah (Jeremiah 22-23), were attuned to the dangers of the state system, with its propensity to incorporate Yhwh into its structure. Nicholson has argued that the term běrít, "covenant," gained prominence within the Israelite tradition as a theological concept emphasizing the uniqueness of Israel's relationship with Yhwh and aimed at preventing that relationship from being absorbed into a state system similar to others in the ancient Near East.53 This effort to preserve the integrity of the relationship with Yhwh seems to be the rationale for the prohibition of images of Yhwh, which was only implicit in Exod 20:4-5 but became explicit in Deut 4: 12-20.54 If the pantheon or religious system of the state could localize the presence of Yhwh and define his power and 50 Alan Peatfield, "After the 'Big Bang' - What?

Thus, Ezekiel' s throne vision was critical for guiding the prophet and the exiles to understand how Yhwh' s sovereign power governed their lives even after the Davidic king and the Jerusalem temple were lost to them.55 IV. Cracks in the Sacred Canopy: The Wisdom of the Aniconic Ethos Yhwh' s punishment of idolatrous Israel created a serious problem of commu- nication between faithful Israelites and their God. According to Ezek 36:19-21, Yhwh acknowledged that his holy name had been profaned among the nations by reason of his exile of idolatrous Israel. To counter false impressions, Yhwh planned to reveal his holiness (bëhiqqâdësî, 36:23) through the exiles by returning them to their land (36:23-29; cf. 20:9, 14, 22). Yhwh planned to place his spirit within the exiles just as he had placed his spirit in Ezekiel at the time of his call.56 Ezekiel' s vision of Yhwh' s throne-chariot knocked him off his feet (1:28) and left him stunned and motionless for seven days (3:15). The size and power of what Ezekiel saw captured his attention and reoriented his life. The composite, semidivine creatures, which would be identified as cherubim in Ezek 10:20, were not lifeless, immobile statues; rather, their movement and dynamism were inte- grated by a phenomenon analogous to the natural and luminous power of the storm cloud: they were directed by the spirit. The term ruah ("breath, wind, spirit") was particularly appropriate for describing an invisible, pervasive power that could merge with the bodies of the creatures to vivify them. Thus, as Ezekiel tried to describe the workings of Yhwh' s sovereign power, he chose a term that could not only shape the vision of the exiles but also characterize the transforma- tion that they were called to undergo. The paradox of the exile - a punishment aimed at purging idolatry and pollu- tion from the land that resulted in a profanation and diminishment of Yhwh' s name - revealed serious cracks in Israel's sacred canopy.57 Yhwh' s restoration of Israel to its land was intended not to repair the cracks in a sacred canopy shared 55 Odell, "You Are What You Eat," 239-40; Tikva Frymer-Kensky, "Pollution, Purification, and Purgation in Biblical Israel," in The Word of the Lord Shall Go Forth: Essays in Honor of David Noel Freedman in Celebration of His Sixtieth Birthday (ed.

This new the- ology reduced the importance of the king and his territory as manifestations of Yhwh' s care for the Israelites. Ezekiel spoke of the restoration of a Davidic ruler in qualified terms (34:23-24; 37:24; 43:7-9; 45:7-9, 17).58 The type of sacred canopy that Ezekiel dismissed was a theological system that had silenced the metaphors and symbols of the divine and so had insulated the community from the divine epiphany. Obedient worship of Yhwh would have led to the Israelites' participa- tion in Yhwh' s realm (20:11), and the purgation of the exile prepared the way for their sanctification (36:23-29). This sanctification of the exiles was one more impor- tant step in unfolding the holiness of Yhwh' s being, which Ezekiel had initially glimpsed in his throne-chariot vision. In the rapidly changing Greek world of the eighth to seventh centuries b.c., increased travel and commerce carried with it a greater exchange of information and knowledge among the peoples of the Mediterranean basin.59 Those who spoke Greek found themselves sharing a culture with peoples of many other cities of the eastern Mediterranean, but the pantheons of the various cities did not always cohere. The works of Homer and Hesiod tried to promote a synthesis within the dizzying array of stories and beliefs about the gods.60 As the polis religion of the individual cities developed, this move toward synthesis was part of the cities' efforts to create a religious system or sacred canopy to keep them on good terms with all the gods.61 The diversity of beliefs and the questionable morality of the gods featured in these myths and traditions led to skepticism about their anthropomorphic representation of the powers of the invisible realm.62 The pre-Socratic philosophers in Ephesus and Miletus, on the eastern coast of the Aegean, began to ask what elements formed the basis of life and the cosmos.63 Thaïes argued that water was the substance from which all else coalesced.64 58 On links between Ezek 36:16-38; 37:1-14; and 37:15-28 according to the theme "life from death," see Christoph Barth, "Ezekiel 37 als Einheit," in Beiträge zur Alttestamentlichen Theologie: Festschrift für Walther Zimmerli zum 70.

This movement toward abstraction can be seen as a movement away from anthro- pomorphizing the invisible realm, a move bearing similarities to the aniconic ethos in ancient Israel.68 Ezekiel' s description of the throne-chariot made the point that order in the world arises from Yhwh's sovereign governance. Ezekiel did not use linear, rational argument to make his case for how history and nature are ordered; rather, he used images and symbols that he stretched beyond the limits of their particu- larity to make an abstract point about the workings of power in the heavenly sphere. For example, the four-faced creatures of the throne-chariot displayed their particular excellences of swiftness, intelligence, strength, and fierceness; but by this-worldly standards the four creatures were compatible as one unit only in the form of an immobile statue. By a form of analogical thinking, the observer must abstract from the particular characteristics of these creatures and conclude that they could function only at level higher than that of earthly reality.69 Anaximander theorized on the basis of geometrical models to explain how the moving parts of the cosmic organism stay in balance. He imagined that the world had the form of a cylinder, and so explained motion and equilibrium within 65 G. E. R.

They promoted the wisdom of the aniconic ethos. V. Sanctification by Yhwh: The Power to Regenerate the Exiles The spirit that suffuses the creatures and wheels of the throne-chariot, the spirit that lifts up Ezekiel and sets him on his feet in his commissioning, and the spirit that Yhwh promised to place within the exiles, was the invisible reality that brought order and dynamism into the world described in the Book of Ezekiel. This animating, guiding, and empowering spirit is explicitly identified in Ezek 36:27; 37:1, 14 as the spirit of Yhwh.73 In the vision reported in 37:1-14, Ezekiel is brought by Yhwh' s spirit into a valley filled with human bones.74 Yhwh com- mands Ezekiel to prophesy to the bones so that breath will enter into them and sinews and flesh will come upon them (vv. 4-6). After the flesh and sinews come back upon the bones, perhaps echoing the story in Genesis of Adam being formed from clay,75 the reestablished exiles still lack breath; so Yhwh commands Ezekiel to prophesy once again to the breath, to the four winds (v. 9), indicating the uni- versal reach of Yhwh' s sovereign word.76 When he does so, the bones come to life, just as the clay figure in Eden was vivified by the breath of Yhwh (Gen 2:7).77 This vision communicates the promise that the word and spirit of Yhwh that has 70 Kahn, Anaximander and the Origins of Greek Cosmology, 81; Martin L.

Their experience of dying through deportation and rising through recep- tion of the word and spirit of Yhwh will put them on new ground, showing them that Yhwh is sovereign over heaven and earth. Israel's restoration will go beyond a new exodus; it will be a new creation.78 VI. Conclusion Ezekiel emphasizes that his anthropomorphic royal imagery for Yhwh is not literal and that his portrayal of the creatures of the throne-chariot stretches the limits of the analogical. His qualification of this visionary scene as a feeble reflection of the divine reality is communicated most strongly by the striking imagery of the throne-chariot. The complexity of the imagery for the creatures creates a picture that moves the viewer to see beyond the representation of observ- able reality to the invisible realm, and thereby to engage in a form of abstraction. The otherworldly character of the four creatures constituting the throne-chariot stands in the foreground of the picture of the enthroned Yhwh and helps to communicate a vision of Yhwh' s sovereign power both at work within the visible world and incommensurate with it. This visionary sqene draws upon images of weather, animals, and mechanical elements within the range of the experience and knowledge of Ezekiel' s audience, but the combination of these images defies the limits of earthly reality. The tension between the static figures and their lightning- like movements indicates that Yhwh' s power and glory operate at a higher level. The capacity to see this vision as reported by Ezekiel required not only that the exiles open their eyes but also that they be recreated by Yhwh' s spirit. Human efforts to represent the divine can devolve into efforts to control the divine. Statuary can be so artistically beautiful as to claim to embody the divine, whereupon the symbolic character of the statue is reduced and it becomes an image, subtly trying to control the divine and domesticate it within the ideology of the community. The epiphany of the god will then have been replaced by the beauty of the cultic statue. The efforts of the pre-Socratic philosophers to find a more abstract, less anthropomorphic explanation for order in the world was prob- ably triggered in some measure by their dissatisfaction with the explanation offered by the religion of the polis. Ezekiel 's throne vision sketches an elaborate, dynamic picture of the throne- chariot that blurs the outlines of the figures described and speaks of the transcendent, sovereign power of Yhwh. As the divine king enthroned on this mobile chariot, Yhwh can exercise royal rule over the exiles without an earthly king and in a territory apart from Judah and Jerusalem. The exiles' capacity to perceive the by Elijah and Elisha (1 Kgs 17:17-24; 2 Kgs 4:18-37; 13:20-21) may be echoed here. 78 Hals, Ezekiel , 271; Fox, "Rhetoric of Ezekiel's Vision of the Valley of the Bones," 10, 15.</page><page sequence="17">EZEKIEL' S VISION 377 otherworldly throne-chariot as a symbol of Yhwh's sovereign power will depend on their reception of the spirit.
