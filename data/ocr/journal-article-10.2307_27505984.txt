<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of Religion and Health, Vol. 27, No. 4, Winter 1988 Editorial Some Contemporary Illusions In 1928 the Viennese psychologist Sigmund Freud published a brief study that was destined to bring him both praise and condemnation from many different sources. It was called "The Future of an Illusion," and it dealt with the probable fate of the kind of religion that was based on belief in an anthro pomorphic god whose function was that of a loving, protective, but highly judgmental father. Freud's studies of childhood experience led him to believe that we gain our ideas of god in early experiences with the authority of parents, especially the father. The process of growing up, he noted, is one in which we win liberation from the dominant parental image, see both the be nign and the restrictive aspects of that image, and emerge at length into a maturer self-consciousness and an ability to take responsibility for our own destiny in a complicated world. On the one hand, Freud was condemned by hosts of believers who saw him as the enemy of faith and morality. On the other hand, he was hailed as the liberator from superstition and the apostle of reason and scientific thinking. In the perspective of 60 years, Freud might be interested to see what goes on today. While it is true that many, as he predicted, have emerged from the na?ve anthropomorphic faith of the past, the fundamentalist faiths were never more vehement and articulate than they are today. The illusion of God the father, the chief, the king, the warrior, the absolute authority, was never stronger. Not only is the illusion present in Christian circles, both Catholic and Protestant, but it is tearing the worlds of Judaism and Islam apart too. God, it seems, has been pronounced dead innumerable times but refuses to die, and keeps reappearing in both traditional forms and new disguises with new prophets and preachers to proclaim the final and exclusive truth. At the same time, the scientists, the apostles of reason, the humanists who once thought they were done with God forever, now speak of a larger truth, a more mysterious reality, a deeper reverence than they imagined a half century ago. They speak of the reach of the human mind, but they also stand in awe at the size and complexity of the cosmos it struggles to comprehend. They admit the need for humility before the realization of how little we know. It seems there were two kinds of illusions connected with religion. One is that God, the Man Upstairs, the Father, the Ruler, will take care of things if 261 ? 1988 Institutes of Religion and Health</page><page sequence="2">262 Journal of Religion and Health we only believe. The other is that having been released from the tyranny of faith in god, reason and science constitute the all-sufficient answer to the perplexities, tragedies, and opportunities of the human condition. But the difference between the two kinds of illusions is very important. The illusions of orthodoxy, dogmatism, and absolute faith are of a rigid sort. They can accept no equivocation, no questioning, no compromise. The illusions of sci ence and reason, on the other hand, have a certain flexibility. They become illusions only when they claim finality. They know only the method, the path. Hence, they can accept modifications and compromises in the light of new discoveries, new experience, and new lines of reasoning. The future is open, and the returns on human judgments of right and wrong, the field of ethical values, are not all in. We know the general direction, from ignorance to truth, from division to unity and understanding, from hate and competi tion to love and mutual cooperation. It is like having a compass so that you know which way to go without knowing for sure which road is smoothest, most convenient, or most scenic. Hence, on many points there is room for variety, and freedom of choice is an essential of the whole process. It seems that, like many ancient enemies, revealed religion and positivistic science have arrived at a kind of truce. They do not belligerently assail each other's basic assumptions, because in a practical sense each makes abundant use of the resources of the other. Hard scientists are often educated in col leges and universities under conservative Christian or Jewish auspices. Many a born-again Christian who wants to succeed in the modern world has learned that he must be familiar with the methods and assumptions of science. Where would our evangelists be without the wonders of modern communication systems? How could they function without TV, public opinion polls, and means of rapid transportation? It seems that at the practical level there is no conflict between science and religion. Applied science brings them together. In our own experience we have found that the relinquishment of the illu sion of God the Father was not so much a loss as an expansion of conscious ness into a larger world. There was, indeed, something warm, friendly, and safe about the feeling of the family with Father at the head and in control of things. But there was also something very satisfying and exhilarating about moving out of that cocoon and into a larger, more varied scheme of things. One did not wholly lose the sense of security of the old faith. Rather, one began to see that it stood for a much wider, more universal kind of faith. As the classic idea of the family was the symbol of the old faith, so one looks for other concepts to describe the new. The best one we can think of is Carl Jung's idea of the collective unconscious. Here is a great reservoir of human longings and fears, intuitions and hopes, the gathered experience of the whole human family and its journey through the centuries. In memory, reflections, dreams, and meditation one can dip into this rich resource of wisdom and experience and make parts of it one's own. One can feel at times</page><page sequence="3">Harry C. Meserve 263 "the backing of the dead," the awareness of being in the main stream of human search and discovery. Best of all, one can check out one's own fears, impulses, desires, and hopes and find that one is not alone, that we share with countless others in many times and places the experiences that make life sometimes tragic, sometimes comic, often meaningful, and, rarely, even sublime. We do not outgrow the old images. Rather, the process of living helps us to fill them with deeper meaning. The future of the religion illusion of which Freud wrote was not to be lost and swallowed up in science, but to be understood and experienced in univer sal human terms. For the science of which Freud spoke had its illusions too. It was highly materialistic. It confined itself to what could be apprehended by the senses, measured, pictured, described in literal terms. If you could not prove it in these terms, it could not be so. A classic illustration of this view is the famous story about Dr. Johnson. He and his friend Boswell were dis cussing the radical idealism of Bishop Berkeley, who held that all the mate rial world was but a shadow, a dim reflection of the real world of eternal ideas. It was a kind of pure Platonism, purer than Plato himself. Johnson and Boswell were walking as they discussed the matter, and Johnson suddenly kicked a boulder beside the path. "I refute Berkeley thus," he said. But we have come much further, in science as in religion. The solid rock Johnson kicked we now know, or so the scientists tell us, for we have never seen it, is made up of atoms that are themselves made up of nuclei which contain sub atomic particles, protons and electrons, all in orderly and incredibly rapid motion. The solid rock is thus dense energy, and the essence of being is ac tivity, motion, power, not dead stuff. All of this science can prove to us by physics, mathematics, and highly sophisticated methods of observation and recording. We have not seen it with our eyes any more than we have seen God or an angel. What science has done is demonstrate the infinity of possi ble knowledge on the other side of crude materialism. Like religion, science has outgrown its early illusions and revealed a much larger universe beyond them. Scientists today approach their fields with openness and even a kind of reverence. Even more important, scientists are emerging onto the larger fields of ethical values and the application of science to peaceful purposes. Many have decided that it makes a tremendous difference what use is made socially and politically of the enormous power science has placed in human hands. Two examples of illusions that need to be outgrown may be cited. One is the pathetic belief in the efficacy of violence, either as a protection or as a means of enforcing cooperation or obedience on others. We have come, it seems, to some points of ultimate decision in planning for the use of violence in international affairs. The tide has begun to turn away from the mere piling up of destructive weapons as a deterrent to aggression and toward an authentic effort to reduce the threat the mere existence of these weapons has created. Scientific groups have had a lot to do with this change. The Interna</page><page sequence="4">264 Journal of Religion and Health tional Physicians for Social Responsibility have insistently reminded the governments and peoples of the world that there is literally nothing medical science can do to deal with the physical human consequences of the use of nuclear weapons. The only cure is prevention. The Union of Concerned Scien tists has made a strong contribution in its efforts to bring about the end of the Star Wars program, which in the name of defense promises to carry the arms race into the exploration and control of outer space. If ever there was a project that must be controlled and directed under international supervision for the benefit of all the world's peoples, the exploration of outer space is one such. If we can leave behind the illusion that peace and human survival can be built on a balance of terror in an environment of international competi tion and conflict, we should be able to learn and gain some skill in the new sciences of negotiation and peace-making. But to do so we need a whole new language and a new psychology based on the teaching and practice of mutual understanding among diverse persons and groups. For generations our way of thinking and acting, not only in military mat ters but in social and political and economic matters, has assumed the cen tral activity of conflict. We fight wars against poverty, disease, people in other races or other religious communities. We seek to win out over our opponents in arguments, elections, economic struggles, even in church mem bership or social groups. The hymns of the traditional church bristle with warlike talk: "Fight the good fight," "Onward Christian Soldiers," "Rise up, O men of God." The process of warring against one another has become a part of our psychological, moral, and spiritual landscape all the way from primary school athletics to international organization and diplomacy. We even ask which side "won" a peace conference. How do we turn peace into a verb, so that we can "peace" with one another with the same intensity that we now "war" with one another? How do we break out of the illusion that human relations must always be competitive? It is encouraging that Professor Roger Fisher of Harvard and some of his colleagues are actually at work in developing a science of negotiation which can be studied, learned, and practiced in a wide variety of human relations. In a book called Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreements Without Giving In, Fisher and his colleague William Ury offer a series of simple suggestions in how to reach understanding and agreement on difficult problems that seri ously divide persons and groups. There are, Fisher and Ury say, two kinds of reasoning. One is called "eristic," based on the Greek word eris, strife. For examples one could cite the talk at almost any debate. The combatants are not striving for agreement. Each hopes to triumph over and beat down the reasoning of the other. But there is another kind of reasoning. Socrates called it "maieutic," which means to open dialogue and to help draw the reasoners out. It is suggestive that maieusis is the Greek word for "midwife." If we engage in dialogue not to win but to gain mutual understanding, that is a goal where both sides can win. Socrates was a master at this kind of discus</page><page sequence="5">Harry C. Meserve 265 sion, where the goal is to achieve clarity of meaning and mutual understand ing. As an example of what Fisher and Ury mean, here are some points that underlie the practice of principled negotiation. Each person must focus on interests, not positions. What are the common goals that both sides or all sides seek? Let each side try to discover or invent options where there will be mutual gains. Separate people from the problem. Do not be led into denunciations of individuals or of past group behavior. Establish objective criteria that all can agree on. Avoid the final yes-no answers. Remember the logical "law of the excluded middle." There are always a number of possible middle ways between the extremes on either side. These points are at first sight simple and obvious. Following them, learn ing to think and speak as they suggest, involves revolutionary changes in our thinking on many points dear to our habitual prejudices. We now come to a third illusion which, we believe, is ready to be outgrown. Ever since we can remember, and we go back to the First World War, the community of Americans has been agitated and torn apart by the spectre of communism. The tension has been much more than a passing political con troversy. It has divided communities, governments, churches, educational institutions, and even families with fear and bitter dissension. It has driven otherwise rational and sensible people into many kinds of foolish and irra tional behavior. Yet communism as an economic force has not won the loy alty of workers and peasants in the Third World, although nationalism has often been a factor in their behavior. In our own country communism has never been able to muster more than a few thousand votes, and that was back in the depths of the Great Depression of the 1930s. Nor do the Soviet Union and the United States have any bitterly contested border areas. Their confrontations have been in Third World areas or in diplomatic circles. What it comes down to is that communism has been an illusory monolithic force, an ideological label for all the fears and hatreds that possess the minds of the dogmatic and the thoughtless. Communism has been our devil on whose machinations all manner of evil can be blamed. But the fact is that com munism has not been working well even in its mother country, the Soviet Union. Freedom and responsibility with all their problems are a much better way of solving the basic human problems all nations confront: food, shelter, work, education, self-government, and peace. The fear of communism has for too many years been permitted to frustrate rational efforts to meet real human needs. If we could throw off our fears and meet the Soviets on the assumption that we are all human and must face the same human problems as co-passengers on spaceship Earth, we could release the profound human hunger for bread and demand for peace. The future of this illusion would be a new realistic appraisal of our world-wide need for cooperation and peace. Perhaps it is too early to say, but we sense a change from the fierce ideo logical warfare of earlier decades of this century. Because human needs and</page><page sequence="6">266 Journal of Religion and Health hopes are universal, we may be moving toward a world consciousness that will help us to leave our outgrown conflicts behind. The British historian E.P. Thompson states this awareness in memorable words from his address at the European Nuclear Disarmament Conference in Coventry, England, in the summer of 1987: What we are working for is not some unprecedented change in human nature, some impractical Utopian future. The world that we seek is already here. It needs only the courage to throw off the shadows of the past, to show itself to believe in its own existence. The ideologues offer to us a present that is already dead, and that is dragging out a posthumous existence on the life-support sys tem of militarism. Human consciousness has changed. . . . This has enlarged the limits of the politically possible. Everywhere, and on both sides, people know that a profound change is about to come. It is our business to disclose the present as it really is. We emerge from our illusions not as people robbed of security and faith, but as those born into new and broader loyalties and maturity of mind and heart. Harry C. Meserve</page></plain_text>
