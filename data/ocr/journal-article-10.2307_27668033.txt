<plain_text><page sequence="1">Aby Warburg's (1866-1929) Dots and Lines. Mapping the Diffusion of Astrological Motifs in Art History Dorothea McEwan The Warburg Institute, University of London Abstract: The art theorist and intellectual historian Aby Warburg made it his life's goal to research the "Wanderstra?en der Kultur," conceived as the pathways of the mind. As "image historian" he traced the metamorphoses of ideas as translated into art, literature, and music over time and space, to probe what it meant to orient oneself in space. The Mnemosyne Atlas, a compilation of photographs to chart the development of particular symbols and images, is one such well-known tool of orientation. Less widely known is his quest, presented here, to understand astrological motifs and their shifting place in an evolving intellectual world view. Introduction The question "What does it mean to orient oneself in space?"?this is the rough translation of "Was bedeutet es, sich im Raum zu orientieren?"? was posed by Aby Warburg on the morning of the day on which he died, 26 October 1929, adding, "my speech as incoming Rector of Hamburg University would have been called something like this."1 While paraphrasing Kant's "What does it mean to orient oneself in thought?"2 Warburg's question formulated his quest for orienta tion. The immediate prompt was Ernst Cassirer's inaugural lecture as Rector of Hamburg University on 7 November 1929 on "Forms and Change of Forms in the Philosophical Concept of Truth." In it the philosopher Cassirer touched on Leopold von Ranke 's task, as an historian, to make visible the "universe of ideas."3 Warburg used the term "orientation" frequently in his research into "die Wanderstra?en der Kultur,"4 the highways of culture, the pathways of the mind or intellect, and more precisely into the "Bilderwanderung," the journey of images, literal and metaphorical.5 Thus, despite his own insistence on being an "image or picture historian"6 and not an "art historian," he used the label "historian" loosely, certainly not in a Rankean sense of constructing linear history or histories, but in the sense of excavating those thought processes that led people to a spatial grasp of orientation in the cosmos, not unlike a geological map, which shows strata, rock formations, faultlines, and routes of subterranean water courses that exist yet are invisible to the eye. A short note on Aby Warburg: Aby Warburg, 1866-1929, founder of the Kulturwissenschaftliche Bibliothek Warburg in Hamburg, abbreviated to KBW or jokingly referred to as "Keimzelle bedeutender Werke" or "K?nnte besser werden,"7 which was transferred to London in 1933 and incorporated as The</page><page sequence="2">244 German Studies Review 29/2 (2006) Warburg Institute into the University of London in 1944, embodies the scholar, intellectual, visionary who went beyond narrow confines of academic life in general and German academic institutions in particular. Trained as an art historian, he transcended the purely formal tradition of attributing works of art to masters or schools. He tried to understand the trans mission of thought, the transmission and metamorphoses of images; he called his endeavor the research into the "Wanderstra?en des Geistes,"8 paths traced or taken by the mind, meandering bye-ways of the mind, from classical antiquity to Renaissance Europe and beyond to contemporary art. In his correspondence with Franz Boll, the great scholar of classical philology, Warburg stressed that the academic summer courses in 1913, precursors of the fully fledged Hamburg University which was only established in 1919, needed to offer lectures on linguistics and the exchange of intellectual thought "on the significance of the world view of classical antiquity for the culture of the present time."9 Warburg went further, he was interested in the myriad ways of expressing fascination: visual, aural, and emotional or put differently in images, language, music, and religions. He studied the "paths taken by the mind," the staging posts in the development of scientific thought, tracing the history of disciplines changing color: how numerology turned into mathematics, how alchemy gave birth to chemistry, how invocations and incantations evolved into a corpus of religious texts and songs, stories and literature; how astrology, through scientific observations of the celestial sphere became astronomy. Particularly the triad of art, literature, and religion embodies for him the corpus of culture, that which needs to be tended and nurtured so that it can be harvested, enjoyed, and handed on. Warburg's quest for orientation will be discussed in three sections: 1. Warburg's understanding of the role of astrology; 2. his explanation of this role with the help of similes like Wanderstra?en, the rotating observation tower and the Mnemosyne Atlas project; and 3. Warburg's tool of the Wanderkarte. 1. Warburg's Understanding of Astrology The research by the professor of classics at Heidelberg University, Franz Boll, into the belief in astrology in classical antiquity, published as Sphaera in 1903 but commented on by Warburg only in 1908, was an eye-opener for Warburg. Some 20 years later he would explain that Boll's Sphaera was the first collection in word and image to document "the critique of pure un-reason," a "phenom enological collection for a history and psychology of intellectual orientation."10 It guided Warburg in one direction of research, the survival of pagan antiquity in an altogether different worldview, that of a Christianized Europe. How was it possible that something which had been termed superstitious by the Church could surface in a Christian country? To wit, the so-called Sphaera Barb?rica, the astrological frescoes in the Salonenof the Palazzo della Ragione in Padua or in the Palazzo Schifanoja in Ferrara.12 The Christian message had been unable to extinguish the influences of astrology, where pagan gods were believed to exert</page><page sequence="3">Dorothea McEwan 245 astral powers, as seen in tarot cards, and of magic, where people took recourse to divination by a host of practices, using anything from everyday objects to purpose cut gemstones. Warburg followed Boll in looking at astrology as representing an important development on the road to human enlightenment; it was a store of understanding, albeit a rudimentary perception, an "Erkenntnisrudiment";13 as such it was a fertile field of expression with which Warburg documented the survival of a hidden classical heritage. When researching images of human passions, "Urleidenschaften," he looked at the formulae which had been created in classical antiquity; and furthermore, he followed their journeys and metamorphoses as he became convinced that they allowed one to draw certain conclusions about the nature and contents of the memory of humankind.14 A short sketch of Warburg's preoccupation with images of planetary gods makes us realize that this topic accompanied Warburg throughout his life. He spoke on "The World of the Gods of Antiquity and the Early Renaissance in the South and the North" in a lecture in Hamburg in 190815, stressing the evidence of the survival of the ancient gods in different guises, allegories, interpretations of classical authors like Ovid. Further, he showed in his lecture on "Church and Court Art at Landshut" in Bavaria in 190916 the pervasive presence of images of planets: they decorated a fireplace in the Castle of Landshut, Southern Germany, an example of one more station on the peregrinations of images of the gods of antiquity and their wanderlust. A lecture in Hamburg in 1911, "The Journeys of the Sphaera Barb?rica''11 threw light on another stage of their journeys, preserved in the frescoes in the Sphaera Barb?rica in Salone, Padua, for which there is a panoply of tables, schemata, and charts in Warburg's working papers, showing origins and derivations such as a genealogical tree (fig. I, see next page) and for the first time a geographical map of the Mediterranean and the Middle East (fig. 2) showing the journey of images with lines sketched in color.18 The best known of these lectures was "Italian Art and International Astrology in the Palazzo Schifanoia, Ferrara"19 delivered at the Tenth International Art Historical Congress in Rome in 1912. It marked Warburg's undisputed leadership in this area of research, with his interpretation of the frescoes in Palazzo Schifanoja, in particular the Decans, the gods ruling 10-day periods. (The term derives from the division of the signs of the zodiac into three parts of 10 degrees each.) Warburg called them the "missing links" between image and symbol20 and in troduced his listeners to a new view of astrology, documenting the centuries-old peregrinations of images of the planets from the Mediterranean to the Middle East, Mesopotamia, Egypt and from there to Spain. By documenting the route an astrological image took, he could present answers concerning the influence of classical antiquity on the artistic culture of Europe. In 1910, Warburg had met the young Viennese art historian, Fritz Saxl, who shared Warburg's enthusiasm for the history of astrology as well as for Rembrandt. In a telling aside many years later Saxl remembered a conversation where Warburg had put it bluntly to Saxl that if he wanted to work for Warburg he would have</page><page sequence="4">246 German Studies Review 29/2 (2006) ^illiiS'll....... mr.)

Saxl proudly reported to Warburg that he had discovered that King Maximilian owned a splendid copy o? Picatrix?1 Warburg was excited as, now that he had further proof, it would be possible to establish one more route along which ideas traveled, from the Arabs to Maximilian. To publish Picatrix was therefore an important task, as it presented a source for the understanding of early modern occultism.23 And indeed, the publication o? Picatrix24 was a project which would occupy Warburg and his staff for many years to come. Warburg was not interested in researching Babylonian astrology as such, but in the "practical purpose of cosmological oracular technique,"25 as exemplified by the lectures "Classical Star Images in Renaissance Art" at Hamburg University in 1913 (fig. 3) and "Pagan-antique Prophecy in Words and Images in the Age of Luther" in Hamburg in 1917.26 The influence of Babylonian astrology could be charted by the "Wanderung," the journey of oriental astrology. The ongoing belief in astrology27 had to be interpreted as one that provided continuity in discontinuity, old beliefs in chang ing times. To understand the processes whereby it adapted to and was adopted by the new circumstances encountered would be a contribution to understanding its modern reemergence.28 Warburg was therefore also interested in it in the sense that it presented a block to enlightenment and the "good European" had to fight this block:29 he engaged with gusto in the unmasking of astrology as fraud, particularly in times of upheaval and war. Thus, Warburg found it a paradigmatic example in his research into the processes of social memory. Looking at the images of the gods of classical antiquity and their survival and /or resurfacing in a Christian milieu occupied Warburg throughout his life, from his student days in the 1880s (fig. 4) to his correspondence with Father Joseph Fischer, the author of the cartographic work on Ptolemy,30 in 1902 and to his final years when the topic had fanned out to embrace an investigation into the thought processes of image making and the metamorphosis of memorizing or memory, which Warburg presented in a con densed form in his Picture Atlas or Mnemosyne Atlas towards the end of his life. 2 .The High Roads, the Mnemosyne Atlas and the Rotating ObservationTower Astrological and cosmological images were the vehicles traveling on Warburg's "high roads" or "Wanderstra?en." As much as he was keen on the index in a book, which was like a compass needle pointing to a particular passage?and planned, indeed, to write the "index of indexless books," because "the lack of indices impedes the way to the hearts of books,"31 he was keen on a visual research tool, charts, to show the origins of ideas and images and their journeys over vast territories and timescales.The language and method used by Warburg were those of cartography.</page><page sequence="7">Dorothea McEwan 249 Il!3:fIMn?^fn^it :*&gt;?L?l? ?ill ti||ft||ii?ip fo1i???laff?l!?!lilil?ii?ll?i :ri*!i:w:*!!;" ""':" ?JHfHfHlWi HI llllll:nill,.''." iM#f?fg|?j?j!

If one finds oneself in a labyrinth, one does not understand its layout, one cannot orient oneself. But seen from above, from a bird's eye view, paths, links, contours, bridges over obstacles become visible and may be grasped intellectually. The term "Wanderstra?e" is not easily rendered into English. It obviously goes beyond its primary meaning, that of a walking route. It occurred in other disciplines that mapped developments and distributions, such as the so-called Linguistic Atlas research,32 the Atlas of Plants, a classification scheme following the naturalist Linn?,33 the Picture Atlas of Art History^ or in the ethnological study by Adolf Bastian, The World in its Reflections in the Changing Thought of the Peoples,ls which was accompanied by an illustrated volume that Gombrich called an "ethnological picture book in the form of an Atlas."36 The linear investiga tion into the origins and spread of particular languages or plants or paintings, tracing their distinct dialects, offshoots, variations and new forms, had a long established counterpart in the history of art, where tracing the development of style was an important component of the discipline.37 A "Wanderstra?e" in Warburg's understanding provided a path, a course for all that and more; it was an artery along which ideas coursed, semi hidden, but vital for the health of the organism. But ideas were not only carried in a physical sense from landmark to landmark by traveling scholars, merchants, pilgrims and beggars. In uncharted territories or on the high seas it was only natural that travelers were guided by the stars and, by extension, by a belief in the guiding properties of the stars. In order to understand the network of arteries, in order to orient oneself, a vantage point was necessary, from which to see the roads, the traffic, the movement of intellectual activity. Warburg's library was such an "observation post," as he termed it in the famous letter to the classicist Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff in 1924.38 In another letter he spoke of his library as "the revolving observation tower, from which the intellectual past of the Orient and the Occident can be viewed."39 Another time he called it the "Lynceus Tower," an observation post from which one could view far away developments, like the Argonaut Lynceus, who was famous for his sharp eye and penetrating gaze backwards into the past.40 Warburg even saw in his library an observation tower from which "the entire trade route of culture and symbols between Asia and America could be viewed."41 A pertinent Hamburg tradition with its Colonial Academy and shipping tradition was invoked when he declared the Kulturwissenschaftliche Bibliothek Warburg to be "a tower observing the trade routes of cultural exchange,"42 scanning "our field of vision."43Therefore the project of the Picture or Mnemosyne Atlas, "the great map of the movement of civilizations, or rather of ideas"44was made pos sible only because Warburg's library presented such a nodal or vantage point. Saxl was as excited about the Atlas project as Warburg, because it would be in his view "a revelation for German minds," the most important publication on the early Renaissance since J. Burckhardt. He saw it not as a "corpus," the definitive</page><page sequence="10">252 German Studies Review 29/2 (2006) treatment of a topic, but a selection which pointed in the direction that research should take. It was therefore necessary to do research in every library in France and Italy so that the routes along which the images traveled became clear.45 Observation and memory had created pictures and stories and these were to be arranged in a way that their diffusion and direction would become visible. However, to tie down these peregrinations proved difficult. Warburg, in the first instance, put up mobile walls in the KBW on which he arranged photo graphs grouped according to topics. He pinned them up on the cloth-covered mobile walls so that they could easily be taken down again and rearranged anew. Warburg could choose his examples from his vast collections of several thousand photographs and could use them as auto cues when explaining the journeys of images to library users, standing in front of the illustrations arranged to fit a particular lecture topic. This ever shifting arrangement was not conducive to producing a definitive version, a publication, and had to remain fragmentary.46 3. "Wanderkarte" I have explained the importance of astrology to Warburg, I have introduced you to the terminology used by Warburg, the high roads or Wanderwege, the rotating observation tower and the Mnemosyne Atlas. It is now time that we look at the method Warburg employed to put these all together by employing the tool of the " Wanderkarte." A map presents a bird's eye view. It makes it easy to grasp large chunks of information. For Warburg maps were heuristic tools, or finding aids, for his research, in particular for his interest in the network of roads of ideas. He was a mapmaker, and selective like all mapmakers. His selection had a purpose, to show the diffusion of ideas. He realized that he needed specialist tools to organize the material, to codify meaning. The method for providing the synoptic tool with which to make visible the high roads or arteries and the work on the rotating observation towers filled with images was what he called the Wanderkarte, the map of images. It would be a psychogeographical tool to chart human inventiveness as well as memory. It would show what has remained hidden or what we would see "as if a sort of autonomous fate had blown the works of Arat andTeukros hither and thither."47 He referred to the Greek poet and astronomer Aratus whose books describing constellations were called Aratea in Cicero's translation and illustrated in Carolingian times; Teukros or Teucer the Babylonian was the Egyptian astronomer and astrologer (fig. 5). Back in 1913, for the summer course with Franz Boll and Carl Bezold on "Classical Star Images in Renaissance Art," Warburg had used a map that his wife Mary had drawn, probably between 1908 and 1911 (fig. 2). It was an outline map specifically drawn to chart the routes of the images with astrological information. Warburg then inserted dots and lines to make visible the diffusion and direction, supposed or real, of the images of these constellations traveling through time and space.48 By the summer of 1926, immersed in his Atlas and Wanderstra?en</page><page sequence="11">? &lt;-n</page><page sequence="12">254 German Studies Review 29/2 (2006) and exhibition research, he needed a more professionally produced map or maps. In the first instance, he contacted the economic historian Heinrich Sievek ing: could he help him find printed maps of trade routes, in particular sea routes from Flanders to Italy, and if not, could he draw them, so that Warburg could use them for his lectures?49 Sieveking replied in the negative.50 At the same time Warburg wrote to Max Georg Schmidt, the mapmaker, whose new edition of a history of world trade, Geschichte des Welthandels,51 was supposed to be printed by the publishers Joachim Perthes in the next few months.52 There was even talk of "buying" back the map from Perthes publishers if they did not publish quickly enough and to instruct another publisher with the task. However, Schmidt could not revoke his contract as Perthes promised to go to print quickly. Schmidt was commissioned specifically to provide large maps or wall charts for two purposes: first, for an exhibition project called "Bild und Zahl als Werkzeuge menschlicher Orientierung" or "Image and Number as tools of human orienta tion,"53 to be mounted in the new German Museum of Technology in Munich.54 Warburg was in consultation and negotiations with the director, Oskar von Miller, for providing exhibition material for a history of astrology to give the proper introduction to an exhibition on the history of astronomy. This project, however, fell through, even though detailed plans had already been drawn up, and so Warburg, sure of its didactic importance, approached the Hamburg city authorities and was able to convince them to mount such an exhibition in the projected planetarium in Hamburg.55 To chart the history of astrology Warburg needed maps indicating particular places of learning and commerce, where old and new ideas collided. He saw this exhibition project as his contribution to the education of the young, to introduce them to enlightenment, not a treasure house filled with curiosities.56 Secondly, Warburg also needed maps for a projected expanded edition of his Luther article, to show the route of astrological images. Schmidt was sent eight photographs with mapped outlines of countries and was requested to mark in trade routes.57 Apart from the particulars of the outlines of the Mediterranean basin and Europe, as drawn by Mary Warburg some 15 years earlier, Warburg and Saxl needed to be clear about what developments they wanted to show. A number of letters between Saxl and Warburg followed, in which routes were discussed. Was "our Aratea" coming from Rome and going to Ireland or did it originate in Alexandria or in Gallia?58 Schmidt was instructed that the finished product should not look like a geographical map, but be more schematic; what was important to see was the overall direction of trade routes, caravan routes, sea routes.59 Max Georg Schmidt produced one map, thinking that entries for trade routes of all periods could be accommodated on one map only.60 He sent it to Saxl who was in London in 1928 cataloguing the large holdings of astrological and mythological manuscripts in the library of the British Museum and elsewhere. When Saxl received the map he immediately saw what was wrong with it: To fix</page><page sequence="13">Dorothea McEwan 255 and chart a diachronic movement presented considerable difficulties and to do so on one map sheet only was simply confusing.61 Saxl decided to use the map by Mary Warburg and ordered multiple copies from Germany. He then proceeded to make entries on three maps, one for each period. He entered dates, names of towns, of people, and most importantly lines indicating the direction of diffusion of thought. With these entries he could finish Warburg's "favorite child," as he called the Wanderkarte.The task, he found, was not so difficult for the road network from the twelfth century onwards, with the onset of the reception of images from classical antiquity, but was very different for the images in antiquity itself. He therefore requested the help of Wilhelm Gundel, a classicist and eminent scholar on the history of astrology, to chart the route astrology took from East to West, starting with Plato, and then the route back from Alexandria and Rome, which he called "Hellenized antiquity," to the Orient and its further spread into Gaul.62 The first of those deals with an impossibly long time span, from 500 BC to 500 AD. Gundel, enthusiastic about the commission, went to work with a vengeance. He entered in purple ink places and events, such as the origin of astrology, predictions of eclipses, appearances of comets and meteor showers, just as he would the horoscopes of individuals, discussing "Chaldaei" not in the sense of a people but as a collective noun for stargazers, liver oracles, end of world prophecies, star and moon movements, calendars, mysteries; he mentioned the names of priests, scholars and travelers in antiquity, but did not want to enter them all on a map charting intellectual development as it would go too far and be confusing?names of people with their places of birth attached do not necessarily mean that these places were important for their astrological studies.63 The Western European countries have relatively few handwritten additions, the Eastern Mediterranean countries, Greece, Egypt, modern Turkey, Arab countries, Iran, and Afghanistan have very many handwritten additions.64 It is all but unusable, and, crucially, it does not show any lines denoting diffusion or direction. The historical information superimposed on a geographical map makes the information on the map crowded and nigh on unintelligible. Just three examples will suffice to demonstrate that this "map" did not work: he made an entry for Heliopolis, south of Alexandria, "here studies Solon, Pythagoras, Plato, Sadoxus, cf. [Hermann] Kees, Sechnuphis (Plato's teacher), by P.W." ["hier studiert Solon, Pythagoras, Plato, Sadoxus, cf. [Hermann] Kees, Sechnuphis (Plato's teacher) bei P.W."]; an arrow pointing to Bordeaux and explaining "Ausonius 4. Jd p." [Ausonius Decimus Magnus, Latin poet and teacher, 310P-394], and additional information for Palermo "Scribonius 1 Jd. a weissagte dem Tiberias sein Schicksal, starb 42 v.Chr." ["the astrologer Scribonius prophesied for Tiberius an illustrious career"]. Saxl revised this map in blue, with much fewer entries, but lines of diffusion of thought, it presents a good overview of "The most important trade routes to the times of Alexander the Great" [broken lines] and "The most important trade routes to the time of the Roman Empire" [continuous lines].</page><page sequence="14">256 German Studies Review 29/2 (2006) The other two maps are captioned: "The most important trade routes from the sixth to the twelfth centuries" and "The most important trade routes from the twelfth to the fifteenth centuries" (fig. 6). While Gundel was busy filling his map with far too many entries, Schmidt mailed his map in three copies again to Saxl in London in August 1928, and Saxl acknowledged them, but then mislaid them. He was "utterly desperate,"65 but did not inform Warburg right away. When Saxl did inform Warburg that he could not find the route maps?a major drama?he softened the blow by suggesting that Schmidt should be asked to draw them again, and to take a more differentiated timeframe into account.66 However, when Saxl returned to London in March 1929, he found them there.67 To Warburg, research into memory, the overall need to find one's bearing, to understand one's world, to find one's guiding light, was connected with providing tools, be they the constant urgent appeals for the establishment of university institutes, such as a Department of Archaeology in Hamburg University, or be they books, photographs and maps in his library. People in the North lacked the compass and the direction as they had no knowledge of Mediterranean culture; the KBW as the "observation tower with the most subtle set of instruments" was the place from which to conduct such research and a vehicle for enlighten ment. He cited as a good example the importance of the reconciliation of Pope Pius XI and King Victor Emanuel III in Italy in 1929: it could not possibly be understood in Hamburg, because it did not know anything of Catholicism. He was convinced that his method and instruments were right. They had global character and application as exemplified by a "brilliant discovery" which Saxl had made and which would attract the greatest admiration.68 The "discovery" was the floor mosaic in Beth Alpha, Palestine. The room in which the mosaic of astrological images was found was a late Hellenistic Jewish cult room. It was a rare example of the Jewish faith, otherwise strictly given to non-visual, non-literal representations, but using astrological images. Scholarship today is still divided on how to interpret this.69 The Wanderkarten were exhibited in the Planetarium exhibition in 1930 and the Mary Warburg map was incorporated into plate A of the Mnemosyne Atlas. It shows three pictures: (fig. 7) the representation of the sky populated by zoomor phic and anthropomorphic images of stars of 1684, the Wanderkarte and a hand drawn Tornabuoni-Medici genealogy. The pictures are captioned "Orientation," "Exchange" and "Social Integration." The first picture is the map of mythological images of stars in the night sky, the second is the route map of images, the third the family tree of an important family which traced its origins from the fifteenth century back to classical antiquity. In this way a single research topic, family research, exemplified its link to the general research topic of orientation.70 Thus, research into visual memory, mapping the movement of memory, turned into a multimedia project: it comprised the creation of charts outlining the journey of images, superimposed onto geographical maps, the arrangements</page><page sequence="15">I I ^1</page><page sequence="16">258 German Studies Review 29/2 (2006) x , x UA&gt;L..^ Figure 7: Phte A, Mnemosyne Atlas. 1930 (WIA, IE. 108.8. l).Transcription p. 263.</page><page sequence="17">Dorothea McEwan 259 of photographs on mobile walls and a projected publication in book form. War burg, with the help of dots and lines, tried to supply the guiding principles and orientation in the maze of our intellectual heritage, a way beyond the rudiment of perception called astrology, pointing to a life no longer governed by fear. He found it important to show people that from a vantage point even higher than a tower they could see spread out below them the network of roads and understand connections. He commissioned a German airmail stamp from the graphic artist Otto Heinrich Strohmeyer and supplied both sketches and caption. At long last air travel would provide the overview method, the internationality of airspace was like a map in outline. It was the synoptic medium with which to see the land and sea spread out below the onlookers and from which they would perceive the "Wanderstra?en," the routes linking people. Strohmeyer's design was not executed as a stamp, but as a linocut called "Idea Vincit," which exemplified to Warburg that the soaring aeroplane of ideas will win through and will overcome fear.71 Warburg valued it so much that he presented it to dozens of friends, family members, and politicians, and took it with him to Italy where he hung it up in his hotel rooms, perhaps as a personal reminder that it is possible to conquer fear. The "routes of culture" presented a web or net, in which one nodal point was Hamburg and Warburg's library. It would have delighted him if it would have been seen and used as hypertext in a worldwide web of information and symbols.

The study builds on Warburg's interpretation of the cycle, and includes (in appendix) a transla tion of Warburg's 1912 essay "Italienische Kunst und internationale Astrologie im Palazzo Schifanoia zu Ferrara and a translation of Elsbeth Jaffa's study of the decans, published in the appendix of Aby Warburg, Gesammelte Schriften (1932): Aby Warburg, The Renewal of Pagan Antiquity, David Britt, trans.
