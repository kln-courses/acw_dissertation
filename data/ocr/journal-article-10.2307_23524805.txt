<plain_text><page sequence="1">STRUCTURAL CORRESPONDENCE OF RELIGIOUS CONSCIOUSNESS AND PHILOSOPHY Walter Rehfeld Sao Paulo The universality of religious phenomena has been largely recognized. But notwithstanding its worldwide occurrence, religious experience has been treated as if it happened by chance. It has rarely been under stood why this important area of human feeling and speculation is a necessary consequence of essential structures of human mental life and why, to a certain degree, any human experience must have its religious aspects. I shall try to show how religious phenomena necessa rily result from certain structural peculiarities of human mental activity. This attempt will not only clarify the place which religion assumes within human cultural activity in general, but will also help us understand the deep structural correspondence of religious consciousness and other forms of cultural creativity — of religious experience and philoso phy for example — even though the latter pretends to be radically irreligious and negative in relation to the truths which religion pretends to have achieved. My basic point of departure is the phenomenological study of human consciousness, which shows that the human mental act is clearly intentional, and is always directed towards an object, as Franz Brentano stated as early as 1874 and as Husserl reaffirmed later.1 "In our perception something is perceived, in our imagination some thing imagined, in love somebody is loved, in hate someone hated, in desire something desired", and, of course, in knowledge something learned. The common feature to be understood from these examples is, that any conscious activity splits reality into reality of the object and reality of the proper conscious act, subjective reality. In this way, the intentionality of human consciousness causes incessant polarization of reality into subjectivity and objectivity, polarity which is made perma nent by human speech and thought. As a result, a self-identical subject is 1. Edmund Husserl, "Logische Untersuchungen5', 2nd vol., Max Niemeyer, Halle 1913, pp. 366-367.

These apparently innocent features we have pointed out, are of the gravest consequences to human life. Caused by the intentionality of the conscious act, the division of reality into self-consciousness and experien ced objects creates a bottomless chasm between the individual and his world. Self-consciousness is constantly opposed by an objective sphere, alien and bewildering to the vital interests of the conscious "I", and the "World" is experienced as radically insensible to our endeavours. Consequently, this dichotomy of self-consciousness and world leads the former to profound existential isolation, which provokes innumerable oppressive experiences: fear of the world and an even greater dread of death; continuous worry about self-preservation — Heidegger calls it "Sorge",2 misgiving because of an inscrutable destiny which, at any moment, threatens to destroy our projects or even our very lives. This sentiment of existential loneliness is an authentic sensation of "perdition". It constitutes the fundamental experience of religious anxiety. Obviously, this experience of "perdition" must stir up profound concern to overcome such an oppressive situation and to find some means of escape from the existential loneliness of an "I", drawn out of its context by the dichotomizing effect of intentionality, inherent to its own acts. Just as "perdition" of self-consciousness proved to result from a universal structural property of the human conscious act — its polarizing effect — so escape from this deeply disturbing, depressive and painful condition to which mankind is subject owing to the constitution of its own mental activity, so escape or "redemption" will not be properly understood until we discover its roots within the essential structure of human consciousness. Surely, every polarity needs a dimension of reference. The North Pole and the South Pole cannot be conceived without reference to the ter restrial globe and its axis, which provides the poles with their common dimension. Similarly the poles of self-consciousness and of a sphere of objects, created by the polarizing effect of the intentionality of the conscious act itself must relate to a common dimension of reference, within which the poles are situated. This dimension necessarily transcends self-consciousness as well as its objective world, containing and uniting both. 2. Martin Heidegger, "Sein und Zeit", Max Nicmeyer, Tuebingen, 1953, chapter 6.</page><page sequence="3">RELIGIOUS CONSCIOUSNESS AND PHILOSOPHY 103 Kant found this dimension of reference in the "transcendental unity of the various in our apperceptions",3 a transcendental medium for all our apperceptions, subjective or objective. Be it our empirical experience or our reasoning, aesthetic or scientific intuition, articulation of personal ity or cultural pattern, all manifestations of consciousness show signs of the same unity. Whatever the position is, we adopt towards kantian "transcendentalism", universal experience gives ever recurring evidence of the "transcendental unity of the various in our apperceptions". We may explain it, as Kant did, by the supposition that all our appercep tions take place within a "transcendental ego", where they are necessarily related; we may, as believers, impute it to the unity of Divine Creation; we may find it, as Marx and Sartre, in the concept of human "praxis" as the fundamental totality for the human sciences; or we may recognize it in Einstein's "curved four-dimensional continuum": In all cases we are faced with a reality which shows form, structure and relationship inherent to a totality, containing self-consciousness as well as its objective world. The dimension of reference comprehends and unites the poles. It constitutes a reality, deeper and more fundamental than the realities of subjectivity and of objectivity, a "Third Reality" transcending sub jective consciousness as well as its objective world, containing and uniting both. A constantly recurring intuition of this "Third Reality" as superior to the "World" and to the "1", origin and indispensable condi tion for both, leads religious consciousness the way to "redemption" from the dichotomization of reality into an "I" and a "World". It establishes a superior context for human life and bestows upon it the meaning for which it strives. There is no human experience, which has not been referred, in one way or another, to a "Third Reality", that it might unite again, what experience has parted. Man's various relationships with nature and social reality and even his attitudes towards his own Self are, in Polytheism, ascribed to the rule of many "specialized" gods, or, in Monotheism to the innumerable aspects of One Universal God, Ruler of the entire universe. In the beginning, the natural anthropomorphism of a mentality, little refined by conceptional abstraction, allowed "Third Reality" to be 3. The "Principle of the Transcendental Unity of the Various in our Apperceptions" belongs to a "Transcendental Consciousness", where the various is necessarily con nected. Conf.

But fear of profanation of divinity, of putting "Third Reality' on the same level with the polarized realities, motivated progressive elimination of personal and worldly characteristics, driving the god-concept to an ever more radical ineffability. The whole redemptive power of "Third Reality" depends, in fact on its basic otherness and its absolute superiority to Man and World. But "Third Reality" needs not, necessarily, be understood as onto logical Being. It can be recognized, also, in the universal meaning of Becoming, where superior principles direct human activity and its objects, the thinker and the reality he is trying to understand. The meaning of becoming transcends any historically concrete condition, is beyond the polarity of subjectivity and objectivity and projects itself in an image of complete and perfect future reality. There are religions where such final conditions are aspired to without recourse to divine help. For Buddhism, for instance, in its first and authentic form, "Nirvana" is the state of total destruction of subjec tivity as well as of the objective world in the minds of those who have reached the highest stage of perfection, where all suffering ceases. "Nirvana", as an absolute "ought-to-be" is precisely the complete elimination of the dichotomy of self-consciousness and the surrounding world with all the characteristics of a "Third Reality", not as Being, but as the ultimate aim of all human aspirations. Seeking "Redemption" in an absolute "ought-to-be", in the "right way" and not in ontological being, not in Divinity, Buddhism can correctly be termed as "atheistic religion". Just as there is "atheistic religion", which does not recur to a "Third Reality" as ontological being, there is "acosmistic religion" which attributes existence only to "Third Reality", whereas the dichoto mized realities, the "I" and the "World" are denied as delusions that have to be overcome by the devout on his way to "redemption", which is achieved by the followers of "Vedanta" at the moment he convinces himself that "Tat Svam Asi", that "That is you": "Brahma", universal and all-comprehensive Godhead is identical with the "Atma", the inner most human "self." We shall now ask how the structures of religious experience, as described above, namely "perdition", "redemption" and "Third Reality", appear in philosophic thought. 4. Comp.

Doubting these suppositions is the greatest of ventures and just this was the scope of "methodic doubt", as practiced by Descartes, when he showed the courage of doubting things generally considerd undoubtable.5 By indicating the insufficiencies necessarily inherent in "Common Sense" thinking, philosophic criticism produces, in the mind of the philo sopher, the recognition of "cognitive perdition" of man. While the barriers of "Common Sense" reasoning are not overcome, man, notwithstanding all his efforts, has no possibilities of correctiy understanding his own "Self5' and the "World" in which he lives. This philosophical awareness of "cognitive perdition" of the human being explains the strong tendencies towards scepticism, found in all periods of history of philosophy, as well as in certain stages of intellectual development of many philosophers. But philosophy is not content with its role of making man con scious of his "cognitive perdition". It also pledges itself to prove that there are possibilities of curing our thought from this state of gnoseolo gical scepticism, by showing a way of "redemption" from "perdition" of human thinking within the limits of "Common Sense". The specificity of the sciences makes any relationship of subjective experience with the objective and impersonal objects of scientific investigation extremely difficult. Only philosophic thinking is totalizing and, therefore, suited to overcome the problems of "subject-object dichotomy". Philosophy aims at a unifying, rationally and methodically worked out view, which must take into account self-consciousness as well as consciousness of the world. In other words, philosophy looks for a totality, which integrating subjective consciousness and consciousness of objects, can execute for human knowledge the functions of a "Third Reality", as just described in the dynamics of religious consciousness. We proceed to give some very brief hints, how, in some modern philosophies, "perdition", "redemptionand "Third Reality" occur, in a purely cognitive sense, leaving out specifically religious philosophies, where this would mean proving the obvious. 5. Rene Descartes, "Meditations", lere Meditation.</page><page sequence="6">106 WALTER REHFELD The two phenomenologies of Pierce and Husserl6 start from the recognition of the insufficiency of human thought and speech within the realm of "Common Sense", looking for safer grounds for scientific reason ing. These are found by Husserl in "transcendental subjectivity" in a way which methodically disregards all empirical reality of the "Common Sense" view, be that reality, subjective or objective. By this method, called "transcendental bracketing" ("Epoche"), the structures of an inner intentionality are revealed as aprioristic schemes of "transcen dental subjectivity", which is the "Third" and only "Reality". To save language from its "perdition" is, similarly, the purpose of Heidegger's philosophy. Unlike the champions of logical analysis, he identifies "perdition" of human language with its excessive formalization, which transforms the subjective and the objective elements into fixed divisions of reality. The task of the philosopher consists of regaining the "origins" untouched by the process of decadent formalization. In this way, self-consciousness and the world will be substituted by their true context within the totality of Being, authentic "Third Reality". Truth is not a correct proposition, but the unveiling of Being to an existence (the "Desein"), which is essentially an opening.7 Directly opposed to the systems of Husserl and Heidegger are the results reached by Russell, Wittgenstein and Carnap.8 The vehicle for truth is the logically correct proposition with right connotation. Thus, logical analysis becomes an instrument of "redemption" from the inevit able pitfalls, hidden in language and thought of "Common Sense". 6. Charles Sanders Pierce, "Collected Papers", ed.

Wittgenstein even speaks of a "logical form" common to the proposition and the objective counterparts of knowledge. Besides logical reconstruction of scientific language, the argument of Bertrand Russell, applying to philosophical problems the results of recent scientific research, particularly of nuclear physics and of the Theory of Relativity, leads to radical immaterialization of the universe and points to a "neutral monism'י. The only "reality" that can be admitted, according to Russell, is the neutral "event", which is neither subjective nor objective and constitutes a genuine "Third Realitythe only admissible real ground for self-consciousness and the objective world. Just as Russell with his "logical analysis", so Rudolf Carnap tries to purify scientific language applying to it the criteria of "logical syntax". This can be done irrespective of whether our propositions contain facts of physics or facts of psychology. By the "Thesis of Physicalism"9 which sustains the essential reducibility of any psychological fact to a corres ponding fact within the realm of physics, the perfect unity of science is safeguarded as well as the perfect homogeneity of reality, which is ultimately physical in spite of psychical and social appearances and qualified, in this way, to assume the unifying and totalizing functions of "Third Reality". The same effect of "redemption" of "Common Sense" reasoning from its polarization into self-consciousness and awareness of the world can be seen ensuing from the concept of "pure experience", proposed in the famous article by William James: "Does Consciousness Exist?"10 The self and the object are, according to the theory of "Radical Empiricism", only different functions of the same fundamental reality, called "pure experience", which, again, constitutes an authentic "Third Reality All these philosophies, as different as they are, show, nevertheless, certain common structures: 9. The 'Thesis of Physicalism" maintains that the physical language is a universal language of science; that is to say, that every language of any subdomain of science can be equipollently translated into physical language. From this it follows that science is a unitary system, within which there are no fundamentally diverse objects domains and, consequently, no gulf, for example, between natural and psychological sciences.

When the Greek genius, in pre-Socratic philosophy, found a method of dealing with being, rationally and methodically, the genius of Israel, on the other side of the Mediterranean, searched for the absolute "ought-to be". To the prophets of the Old Testament, reality, be it human, social or even natural, was important as far as it satisfied moral demand. Universalized and rendered absolute this "ought-to-be" presents itself as the Will of a universal and omnipotent God. It becomes the criterion for the interpretation of human evolution in the first historiography of mankind. For, in fact, history is not only a registration of fact according to chronological order as done by Herodot, usually held as the father of scientific historiography; but history is equally the interpretation of facts, according to certain criteria that transform mere succession into historical process. We have seen that, although not identical with being, historical transformation, when based on eternal determinants, constitutes an authentic "Third Reality", projected on the screen of future being as the "Messianic Era", when conflicts between the "I" and the "World", between the individual and society, will be overcome once and for all. Jewish religious consciousness is based, therefore, on two foundations, on two different conceptions of "Third Reality", which, although quite different from one another, are profoundly related: A "Third Reality" as Living Existence, as God Creator, the origin of all subjective and objective reality, to Whose Unity and Uniqueness all created conscious ness can resort to, when stricken in existential conflict and contradiction, God that "saw everything He had made, and, behold, it was very good" (Gen. I, 31), Whose work no one could dare to criticise and change; and</page><page sequence="9">RELIGIOUS CONCIOUSNESS AND PHILOSOPHY 109 another "Third Reality" which is not universal being at all, but universal becoming, universal transformation, according to the demands of an eternal "ought-to-be", in whose name the prophets of Israel let nothing escape from a most radical criticism, no man, no society, not even nature, which, in messianic days, will be totally transformed. Biblical thinkers generalized their observations on the necessity of moral change, creating the totalizing concept of the "Will of God", determining all transformation, just as pre-Socratic philosophers general ized about universal being, to be sought behind the infinite variety of facts which constitute eternal and unchanging nature. But it should be remembered that in Judaism, besides the "Will of God", which promises universal "redemption" by universal transformation, there is a vision of God as Supreme Being, in Whose unchanging Unity and Uniqueness all dichotomy of "Self-consciousness" and awareness of the "World" necessarily disappears and Who bestows meaning and "redemption" on all that "is" by offering, to the human being, its social existence and to his world, as unalterable facts of His Creation, the supreme, eternal and unchanging context, within which are all dichotomy and conflict be tween "Self" and his objective environment must disappear. We admit today, that in many cultures, monotheistic conceptions preceded the polytheistic stage of religious development and that the clear-cut couise of the positivistic "Law of the Three Stages" is subject to profound doubt.11 We know that in many "primitive" societies a supreme Godhead is believed to guarantee moral order.12 The originality of the biblical view, therefore, should not be sought in the concept of God as Guarantor of moral order, shared by many other religions, but in the concept of the "Will of God" as the Guarantor of moral evolution. There is no existing moral order, no social or political institution, no human being, who can be judged perfect and resist the 11. Andrew Lang, "The Making of Religion", 1898 and Father Wilhelm Schmidt, "Der Ursprung der Gottesidee" (1912-1955), based on rich ethnographic evidence of the occurrence of the idea of a supreme Godhead in many illiterate societies, render unsustainable the views of Auguste Comte, the anthropologists L.H. Morgan and E.B. Tylor, as well as of the evolutionist philosopher H. Spencer that monotheism, has devel oped out of polytheism in a universal evolutionary process. On the other hand, history of religion certainly shows tendencies of progress from polytheism to mono theism. 12.

Universal moral imperfection requires universal moral evolution, following the eternal deteiminants which constitute the "Will of God". The finding of the twofold foundation of biblical religious conscious ness is a first result of the application to Judaism of our method of structural analysis of religious consciousness, an application still incipient and imperfect. It nevertheless discloses entirely different aspects and should prove of great fruitfulness, when better developed and more consistently applied.</page></plain_text>
