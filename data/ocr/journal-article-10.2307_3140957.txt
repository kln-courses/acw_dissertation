<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE BIBLICAL WORLD VOLUME XXIV AUGUST, I904 NUMBER 2 THE IMMANENT PRESENCE AND INFLUENCE OF GOD. THE universe can and must be interpreted in terms of personality. This underlies all theology. And it is in this region that within the last few years we seem to have been gaining most valu- HE RUE DEA able data. As much as anything it has led to the new conception of God. The ancient world, and for the most part the modern religious world, still thinks of God in terms of king or mechanician. In such a view God is not merely transcendent; he is actually located and spatially distinct from the world. Such a view constantly passes over either into deism or a materialism which attributes to matter the capacity of doing things deemed impossible for a distant deity whose very existence is with difficulty judged necessary. To the modern religious thinker God is immanent. Undismayed by the fear of pantheism, he sees in the forces of the uni- verse the expression, not of a machine, but of a living soul. The mathematician and astronomer, whenever they generalize phenomena into a mathematically exact law, are to his mind bearing testimony to the rationality of the universe itself. The argument for design in its original form may cease to appeal to him, but in its place he finds new data which not only imply, but actually demonstrate, the exist- ence of reason everywhere. If in our education these considerations were seriously advanced, and the young mind taught to realize that it is not necessary to argue FINDING GOD from the universe to God, but to see God in the universe, IN HIS it would inevitably come under the controlling concept UNIVERSE of theism. It is one thing to prove to a young man or woman that there is somewhere a God controlling the universe, and 83</page><page sequence="2">COLUMNS IN THE GREAT HYPOSTYLE HALL OF THE TEMPLE OF AMON AT KARNAK.</page><page sequence="3">THE BIBLICAL WTORLD quite another to show him how reason is everywhere present in the universe. Unless we mistake, it is the latter that is more easily done and when done will be possessed of splendid pedagogical value. The crying need of all our educational as well as of our religious work today is a new conviction concerning God. The apperception of too many people lacks the thought of God. For years our religious teachers have discussed matters of conduct or refined problems in theology, assuming that the belief in God was either an intuition or something so deeply grounded as not to require treatment. It is inevitable, therefore, that any sharp, intelligent conviction concerning God should disappear, to be replaced by an anthropomorphic concep- tion of his moral qualities, such as that of fatherhood, or by mere rhetorical impressionism. From the point of view of theology, the first step that religious education must take is to furnish the children with a rational, even though a simplified, theistic conception. The moral imperative is rationally to be based upon the existence of this immanent God. It is one thing to assume that a given statute THE WILL OF for conduct was formulated by the Deity, and quite GOD IN another to show that a given course of conduct is THE NATURAL contrary to the reason and love exhibited by this ORDER immanent God in nature. In the one case you have an extra-rational morality. In the other, right is seen to be a con- scious adjustment of the individual to his situation, with a determina- tion on his part to be one with the teleological process in which he dis- covers himself involved. In dealing with children it is of course necessary to treat such matters concretely, but it is a great mistake to assume that there should be two conceptions of the theistic basis of morality, the one for children and the other for adults. Nothing can be more dangerous for the moral life than a conviction that it is sub- ject to arbitrary or unintelligible commands. It is a serious mistake to hold that the orderly processes of life, whether social or cosmic, are any less divine than the exceptional. While the present age would not deny the possibility of the miracle properly defined, it finds its strongest theistic arguments in those things which occur in sufficient numbers to be classified. It is at this point that morality really appears and should be so taught to the young. The will of God is to be seen in natural and 84</page><page sequence="4">EDITORIAL sociological law. Moral sanctions are to be formulated from this increasingly understood divine purpose. We want our children grounded in the belief that such sanctions are based, not uponan extra-natural divine will, but upon an immanent divine will. What is more, we want them taught that the wisdom of conforming to this will is not a matter of arbitrary decision by parent or teacher, but is solidly grounded in the eternal wisdom of the God of things as they are. The historical Jesus embodies the principles which should obtain in all morality. This is not to say that everyone should live just as JESUS Jesus lived. By the very necessity of the case he was EXEMPLIFIES conditioned by his age, as we all are conditioned by our THE IDEAL age. He was a Jew of the first century, and not an MORAL LIFE Italian of the thirteenth, or a German of the sixteenth, or an Anglo-Saxon of the twentieth century. It would be an exceed- ingly artificial morality which would insist that his life should be copied. It is not to be copied; it is to be followed. The principles which he embodied in his surroundings are those which we should embody in ours. At this point we are not discussing the matter of Christian as opposed to Jewish Christology, or of orthodox as opposed to radical theology. The authority of the life and teaching of Jesus does not lie in a metaphysical definition of his personality, but in its agreement with the known will of God. The unalterable conviction is pro- duced by it in every thoughtful mind that the divine mind and will, if ever they were to be expressed in the human individuality, would adopt the same course of conduct as that followed by Jesus. It is difficult to see why the life of Jesus thus interpreted should not be utilized as a basis for religious and moral training. The process THE of historical criticism, while it may have weakened con- EDUCATIONAL fidence in certain details of the gospel story, has cer- VALUE tainly tended to increase our confidence in the his- OF JESUS toricity of Jesus himself. Waiving in the interest of harmony all christological questions, we find in his teaching material which is something other than that furnished by the poet. In his life the highest ideals and the noblest self-sacrifices are reinforced by the record of his actual conduct.</page></plain_text>
