<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Nature of Scientific Knowledge as Related to Liberal Education JOSEPH J. SCHWAB* in a previous paper1 concerning the nature of scien tific knowledge and its bearing upon the teaching of science, the author dealt principally with practical as pects of the problem. That paper had two aims. One was to describe a method of group study and group planning adequate to the problem of constructing a course in science in a program of liberal education. The second was to describe the three-year program which emerged from such study and planning. In these descriptions several theoretical considera tions were employed as premises. The principal of these had to do with diversity of view concerning the nature and method of science. It was said that there was diversity of view concerning science as a whole, since science could be examined from several points of view, each of which emphasized different factors. It was further said that science was itself heterogeneous with respect to the patterns of inquiry employed, cer tain patterns characterizing some fields of research, while others dominated in other fields. The present paper discusses this theoretical point in itself in order to offer some evidence for the exist ence of this diversity, to give some examples of the diversities, and, in relation to educational practice, to suggest some ways of coping with them in a program of liberal study in science. The first of the paper's * Professor of Natural Sciences in the College, Uni versity of Chicago. four sections attempts to show that the apparent gen eral agreement concerning the nature of science holds for descriptions pitched at a very high level of gen erality but disintegrates or has little or no validity when the problem of the nature of science is approached in terms of concrete specimens of research in the various fields of science. The second section describes three types or sources of diversity about and in science, diver sities of interpretation of the nature of science, and di versities in science itself, which are significant for plan ning in education. The third section provides a tentative taxonomy of the varieties of scientific knowledge, that is, of the most significant type of diversity in science. The fourth section treats some of the educational implica tions stemming from differences of interpretation of the nature of scientific knowledge and from significant diversities within science itself. I. AGREEMENT AND DISAGREEMENT CONCERNING SCIENCE What science is and, therefore, how to teach it are our problems. Yet, in one sense, there is no problem. We all know what science is. There is no difficulty in distinguishing its subject matter, as may be the case with the humanities. Its subject matter comprises all natural phenomena which can be made to yield general truths when subjected to the method of science. There is no controversy over the ends and methods of science, as is often the case in research within the field of the social studies. The end of science is the establishment of general laws or truths, and it achieves its end within the limits suggested by Dewey's descriptive phrase, 245 1 "The Science Programs in the College of the Uni versity of Chicago: The Three-Year Program: Its Foundations," in Science in General Education, ed. Earl J. McGrath (Dubuque, Iowa: Wm. C. Brown &amp; Co., 1948).</page><page sequence="2">246 The Journal of General Education "warranted assertibility," Its method is to establish the warranted assertibility of general propositions (which contain terms and relations not immediately derived from data) by referring them for verification to "stub born and irreducible facts." This is a method which, though it may vary in detail from science to science or problem to problem, is called the "inductive method." Described at this level of generality, not only is the nature of science well understood and agreed upon, it is also an adequate basis for many programs of study. Wherever a program is concerned only or mainly with the conclusions of science, and with them only for prac tical purposes, this general view suffices. This would hold for survey courses oriented to student "needs," where "need" is conceived only in terms of workaday applications to the technological devices of the modern home and office. It would hold also for engineering programs with a similarly restricted technological em phasis. Here the teacher may teach and the student learn the conclusions of science apart from the data and their interpretation which support conclusions, con fident that the conclusions so taught and learned have all the validity which the method of science can im part. They can be sure that this validity is, on the whole, limited only by the incompleteness of data and the incomplete formulation of the problem to which the conclusions of science are always subject when withdrawn from the unending process of inquiry which produces useful conclusions but also continuously en larges and modifies them. When, however, the consideration of science goes beyond the general to a consideration of particular sci ences as embodied in concrete examples of scientific in quiry (as it will when the objectives of a program of study go beyond the imparting of scientific conclusions for merely practical purposes), unanimity and simple certainty about the nature of science are displaced by differences of view. These differences arise when sci entists and students of science are confronted by prob lems of method, end, and subject matter visible in con crete examples of scientific inquiry, though not notice able from the distant and general view. For instance, F. K. Richtmyer and E. H. Kennard, two highly respected physicists, have this to say of Newton's Principia?in the 1942 edition of their In troduction to Modem Physics: In this treatise the famous three laws of motion are assumed as axioms. Their greatest merit lay in the fact that they contain just enough to constitute a complete basis for the science of mechanics and no more. The laws can be expressed with a slightly greater clarity in modern terminology and we now realize that in part they express definitions rather than experimental facts, but it is com monly felt that no more convenient basis for mechanics has been proposed.2 On the other hand, R. B. Lindsay and H. Margenau, also highly respected physicists, have this to say in the 1944 printing of their Foundations of Physics: Granted our ignorance of force, . . . [Newton's first] law becomes a pious statement calling attention to a pos sible state of motion which may sometimes be realized in nature and sometimes not. . . . All this is very much tinged with anthropomorphism, and inasmuch as science tries to get as far away from anthropomorphic ideas as possible, is of doubtful value for mechanics. . . .s It is incumbent on us to provide some connected theo retical basis with which to replace the Newtonian laws and which will lead to the results which Newton and his successors have sought to draw from these laws.4 Clearly, these authors differ in their conception 01 what constitutes good science, and therefore they find in the record of Newton's research quite different characteristics to which they attach primary impor tance. Richtmyer and Kennard's emphasis on "con venience" and Lindsay and Margenau's subsequent emphasis on an operationalist definition of an accept able "connected theoretical basis" suggest the basis for their diversity of view concerning the proper criteria for judging the soundness of Newton's contribution to physics. What is suggested by these quotations?that scien tists differ widely in their views concerning the nature of science?is borne out if one looks to other fields and areas of science. One sees it in the contrast between the esteem in which the theory of relativity was held in Ernst Mach's later days by many physicists and this statement of his: "I can accept the theory of relativity as little as I can accept the existence of atoms and other such dogma." One sees it in situations where the criticism of a biological study as teleological is un answerable, and the epithet "preformistic" is a sign of departure from orthodoxy. Sherrington testifies to this diversity of view by the fact that he finds it necessary to inveigh against the extremists on his own side in his 2 (3d ed.; New York: McGraw-Hill Book Co., 1942), p. 28. 3 (New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1944), p. 87. 4 Ibid., p. 91.</page><page sequence="3">The Nature of Scientific Knowledge as Related to Liberal Education 247 plea for a physicochemical approach to problems in embryology: When we are told that the modern chemist and physicist cannot get on without the hypothesis that matter explains everything, a position is reached akin to that of initiation into a faith. A rigid attitude of mind is taken as an orienta tion necessary for progress in knowledge. Is there any thing different between that and the efficacy of the spiritu al exercises of St. Ignatius as introductory to mystic con victions expected to follow? What either expedient may possibly gain in intensity of insight is surely at dispropor tionately greater cost to breadth of judgment.5 As one moves closer and closer to concrete cases of scientific inquiry and further from sweeping and general views of the subject, the diversity of position among scientists becomes ever more real and signifi cant in actually determining the direction of research and more necessary for understanding and relating re searches to one another. The diversity becomes more significant because the positions involved deal spe cifically with questions of what kinds of data are to be preferred, what kinds of explanation or knowledge are to be sought, and what kinds of problems are to be con sidered most fruitful for attack in the subject matter in question. The opposition between physicochemical ex planation and explanation in terms of function of parts relative to a whole (as seen in Sherrington's remarks), far from being the only conflict in biology, is only the container for more, and more specific, differences of approach. Even within the group which champions the physicochemical approach, there is a division. In D'Arcy Thompson's Growth and Form we find, for ex ical explanation as the preferred kind of scientific ex ample, this defense of the physical as against the chem ical explanation as the preferred kind of scientific ex planation: In short, it would seem evident that except in relation to a dynamical investigation, the mere study of cell struc ture has little value of its own. That a given cell, an ovum for instance, contains this or that visible substance or struc ture, germinal vesicle or germinal spot, . . . chromosomes or centrosomes, obviously gives no explanation of the activities of the cell. And in all such hypotheses . . . which attribute specific properties to micellae, chromosomes, idioplasts, ids, or other constituent particles of protoplasm or of the ceil, we are apt to fall into the error of attributing to matter what is due to energy and is manifested in force : or, more strictly speaking, of attributing to material particles individually what is due to the energy of their collocation. If we speak ... of... a substance . . . which hands on to the new generation the characteristics of the old, we can only justify our mode of speech by the assumption that that particular portion of matter is the essential vehicle of a particular charge or distribution of energy, in which is involved the capability of producing motion or of doing "work." . . . The things which we see in the cell are less important than the actions which we recognize in the cell_6 If we now turn from those scientists, who by the nature of their work give only occasional attention to the nature of science, to men with a special interest in methodology, the wide diversity of view becomes ex plosively clear. J. S. Mill and William Whewell are in direct conflict concerning the nature of induction it self.7 Einstein and Henri Poincar? are polar in respect to one of the most critical aspects of method in the physical sciences?the relation of mathematical knowl edge to the physical world.8 Francis Bacon, Augustus DeMorgan, and Morris Cohen with Ernest Nagel rep resent three distinct positions concerning the propriety and place of hypothesis in scientific inquiry.9 Descartes can question the very use to which sense-data are to be put.10 Newton, in his aphoristic "hypotheses non fingo," inveighs against the use of mechanical models for explanation and asserts the superiority of conceptual quantities as the appropriate form of scientific knowl edge. Diversity of view concerning the nature of science is then an inescapable fact. And this inescapable fact implies one immediate caveat to architects of liberal programs in the natural sciences. The caveat is that no one doctrine concerning the nature of science can be exclusively employed as a principle of organization and interpretation or taught by the architect in the pro 5 Charles Sherrington, Man on His Nature (New York : Macmilian Co., 1941), p. 136. 6 (New York: Macmillan Co, 1945), pp. 287-89. 7 J.

To employ only one doctrine as a principle will give rise to a biased view of the nature of science, and to teach a single doctrine could be to the student only misleading or confusing or both, be cause no single doctrine is more than a partial state ment?partial in the sense of incomplete and partial in the sense of being based upon a given set of epistemic or metaphysical presuppositions. We shall discuss in a later paragraph a constructive proposal with which to replace the all too common doc trinaire treatment of scientific method. Our present problem, however, is to return to the inescapable fact of diversity of view concerning science and to note certain causes of this diversity which are themselves important considerations in planning and teaching a defensible liberal program of science. II. SOURCES AND KINDS OF DIVERSITY ABOUT AND IN SCIENCE The causes of diversity significant to a liberal pro gram in science are of three kinds. The first of these is found in philosophy. The second is found in science and concerns the reflexive effect of doctrines about sci ence upon the practices of science. The third is also found in science and concerns the variety of problems and subject matters which science investigates. Concerning the cause of diversity which is philo sophical in origin, one must consider philosophy for a moment as a branch of scholarly inquiry. It has prob lems of its own which it investigates much as science does. The problems are various: they may be ethical or deal with aspects of the state and society; they may treat difficulties arising out of considerations concern ing the nature of knowledge; or they may be involved in a theory concerning the nature of reality. For many of these problems, one aspect or another of scientific in quiry is relevant as a source of data. But, as the prob lem attacked by the philosopher varies, so does the as pect of science which is his source of relevant data, and the particular relevant aspect is incorporated into the solution to the philosopher's problem. It is appropriate there, and the conclusions embodying it, if valid when measured by the canons of philosophic method, are also valid if taken as applying only to the problem which the philosopher sought to solve. Difficulty arises when we interpret the philosopher's solution to his particular problem as being a solution to the general problem of the nature of scientific inquiry. So misin terpreted, the philosophic statement cannot appear otherwise than as incomplete and biased in favor of its own epistemic or metaphysical presuppositions; for it is then being misapplied to a problem more extensive and more complex than the one it was intended to comprise. It can be made to throw light on some as pect of scientific inquiry and thus give us the benefits of scholarly study of the nature of science, but only if we are, first, careful to note the problem to which it ad dresses itself and, second, willing to apply the disci plines which enable us to see the particular aspect of science to which the problem is relevant and upon which the solution throws light. David Hume offers a clear example. Misread as a treatise on the nature of science, he can be readily in terpreted, and often has been, as showing the unten able character of causal relations as the object of scientific investigation. He is variously alleged to have sounded the death-knell of "cause," to have exhibited its viciously metaphvsical nature, and to have shown that there can be no such thing as scientific evidence for asserting one class of thing or event to be the cause of another. If he is so misread, one is forced to wonder how biology, and especially physiology, could have been so stubborn as to have gone serenely on investi gating causes, reporting them, and basing a reasonably successful system of medical practice upon them. One answer is that Hume's document is not a treatise on science and does not condemn causation as an object of investigation. A glance at his title reveals that his work is a Treatise of Human Nature, in short, a treatise in psy chology. In the light of that fact, a re-examination of his remarks on cause reveals that his principal terms are those of psychology: idea, impression, perception, as sociation, habit, observation, and experience. His problem, in so far as causes were concerned, was not whether the causal relation was a meaningful object of investiga tion but how it was to be investigated and how the re sults of investigation were to be interpreted. His con clusion, therefore, is not that knowledge of cause is untenable but only that it is probable rather than cer tain, that belief in a given causal relation is founded upon the repeated observation and experience of con tiguity and antecedence-consequence between in stances of the "cause" and instances of the "effect," and not upon detection of the act of causing itself. In</page><page sequence="5">The Nature of Scientific Knowledge as Related to Liberal Education 249 short, he describes precisely how science investigates causal relations and the sense in which the products of such investigation are worthy of confidence. He con demns only a particular misunderstanding of the evi dential and existential status of the relation we call "causation."11 Here, then, is an example of the way in which vir tual or demi-philosophies of science tend to develop during the train of interpretations which usually inter venes between an original philosophical statement and classroom presentation. It points to the unsoundness or incompleteness which characterizes single doctrines of science and the teaching of a single, summary doc trine of science; it emphasizes the need for careful treatment of such doctrines. It suggests the need for presentation of several views of science in such a way that each doctrine will point to inadequacies or errors of others; for, although the example here given is one of Overinterpretation of a doctrine, such doctrines, even thoroughly interpreted, are neither complete nor per fect theories concerning the nature of scientific knowl edge. If, then, any given doctrine is either sweepingly general or, if specific, then also incomplete, to use one such doctrine is clearly to lay one's self open to the charge of falsehood or special pleading. The second educationally significant cause of di versity is to be found not in philosophy but in science. It is, as suggested earlier, real variation in the pattern of scientific inquiry stemming from the reflexive effect of doctrines about science upon the practices of re search scientists. From time to time certain "philoso phies of science" or philosophic documents which can be read as treatises on science appeal to the practicing scientist, and his conduct of scientific investigation is modified to a greater or lesser degree by the doctrine that he has read and approved. This will often be true for significant segments of an entire field of science for a considerable time. Thus, despite the fact that, in one sense, methodological studies take scientific investiga tion as their data, it is also true that scientific investiga tion often stems from conclusions of methodology tak en by the scientific investigator as guiding principles. Some of the same alternative epistemic and meta physical presuppositions which initiate different doc trines about science, therefore, are also found initi?t ing different researches in science itself. (It is of inter est to note that this two-way relation between doo trines about science and scientific inquiry is the same. two-way relation which holds between published dis coveries about human behavior in general and the ef fects of knowing about these discoveries upon the be havior of the very organisms which they describe?the two-way relation which makes the problem of scien tific knowledge in the social sciences so difficult.) Examples of this influence of doctrine on practice in science are numerous and almost commonplace. The language and emphases of operationalism appear in the scientific literature of physics soon after the populari zation of the doctrine as a philosophic point of view. The theological orientation of Newton's investigation of astronomy is no more obvious than the commitment of many twentieth-century physicists to the positivist doctrine of Ernst Mach. When we speak of the effects of new philosophic conceptions of knowledge and of investigation upon a Galileo, we are speaking of a kind of influence which continues to function. Espousal of a simple mechanistic position by zoologists and psycholo gists in the years just before and after the first World War is no less a reflection of "usage . . . akin to initia tion into a faith," than is Goldstein's contemporary insistence on a holistic approach in biology or than what is suggested by a recent meeting of biologists frankly titled "Symposium on Teleological Mecha nisms." Not only was Newton influenced by a doc trine; his work also became an influential doctrine* The years following the success of his Principia are characterized not only by the enormously successful effort to found other theories in physics and chemistry upon mechanics but also by a number of less significant biological researches which attempted to reduce a great deal of biology to fluid and solid statics and dynamics. In our own time the physiological and medical journals exhibit quite clearly a reaffirmation and new emphasis on a somewhat similar conception of physiological ex planation following the successful extraction in useful quantity of heavy hydrogen and other isotopes. "Trac er" techniques quickened biological research along these lines; the increase in this kind of research was fol lowed by emphasis upon the doctrine of physicochemi cal explanation as distinguished from organ physiology and explanation in terms of the relations of organs and organ systems to the organism as a whole. And the 11 David Hume, A Treatise of Human Nature, Book I, Part 3.</page><page sequence="6">250 The Journal of General Education combination of these examples and precepts can be seen to have influenced biom?dical research not only in the frequency of publication of this kind of research but also in the assignment of grants-in-aid by foundations and the policies of new institutes, subdepartments, and special projects in the biom?dical divisions of univer sities and governmental research agencies. A third kind of diversity significant for the planning of a liberal program in the sciences was earlier said to be that diversity which is concerned with the variety of subject matters and problems which science investi gates. It would be tempting to say, for the sake of dis tinguishing sharply this and other diversities, that the third category stems from the subject matters and prob lems of the sciences. Such a characterization is plausi ble; even a casual contrast of representative researches in physics and biology, for example, exhibits a high de gree of differentiation, if not a sharp demarcation, be tween the two in respect to the kind of investigation which is brought to bear upon their respective subject matters and the kind of knowledge of the subject mat ter which is sought. The attempt to determine co variant quantities and numerical constants is the com monplace of physics, for example, and rare in biology. On the other hand, the attempt to discover classes of events which are absolutely or usually invariant in their temporal sequence ("causes") is a commonplace of biology and rare in physics. The notion that this third category of diversity stems from consideration of the subject matter and problems is plausible, then. It is very difficult, however, to establish by evidence. It is much more likely that, of the whole body of di versities of method which can be seen in science, some have undoubtedly been suggested to scientists in their struggle to comprehend their chosen subject matters, and others, whatever their origin, have come to be at tached by scientists more to one subject matter than to another because of their peculiar appropriateness there. It would be best, therefore, to characterize this body of diversities as those which show definite corre lations with one or another subject matter or with one or another kind of problem. It should be emphasized that what is meant by "cor relation" is not mere statistical frequency of associa tion and disjunction, although this would be part of the story. What would distinguish this category of di versities from the others named is that here one finds associated with a given subject matter or kind of prob lem a kind of investigation, some properties of which have discernible relations to properties of the subject matter. A high degree of variability is said to char acterize a sample of any biological phenomenon, by contrast, for example, with the uniformity of samples in chemistry. Such a high degree of variability in biol ogy would constitute a special recalcitrance of such a subject matter to investigation aimed at formulating equations which express a fixed relation between quan titative variables. On the other hand, the concept of organism, with all that it implies concerning complexity and organization, is far more meaningfully applied to living systems than to nonliving systems. Such a con cept implies the notion of a battery of "functions" which analyze the whole activity of the organism into part-activities. These part-activities, in turn, suggest an analysis of the structure of the organism into parts and extended research aimed at assigning structures to functions and also aimed at mutual correction and refinement of the original analyses. These steps de scribe a pattern of research, a "method" which is pe culiarly suited to a particular kind of subject matter. A further example of appropriateness of method to subject matter can be seen in the way that physical subject matters have been amenable in a high degree to a method for systematizing variability. The method con sists in inventing and precisely defining certain "ideal" bodies, whose defined properties are such that varia bility in measurements of some property of real bodies can be referred to the "ideal" body and can be codified and measured with considerable precision as measured deviation from the "ideal." One of the most obvious examples of codification in terms of an "ideal" is seen in the classical treatment of the impact and rebound of bodies. Data on comparative relative velocities of balls before and after impact sug gested that equating momentum before impact to mo mentum after impact and relative velocity before im pact to relative velocity after impact constituted cen tral tendencies which expressed the behavior of bodies in impact, but with extreme variability from one kind of body to another. It was Newton who reduced this vari ability enormously by inventing the notion of "perfect elasticity" and by so defining it that deviations from expected velocities could be expressed by a number which can be considered a measure of the deviation of</page><page sequence="7">The Nature of Scientific Knowledge as Related to Liberal Education 251 real balls from "perfect elasticity" (the coefficient of restitution). The "ideal gas" for the purposes of kinetic molecu lar theory is another case in point. So also was the "freely falling body" during the many years between Galileo's development of the conception and the pro duction of vacuum pumps adequate to the task of cre ating nearly perfect vacuums. Taken together, these cases exemplify the method of "idealization" which has been so fruitfully applied to the broad subject matter of the physical sciences and less so in the physiological aspects of biology. Taken separately, the same instances exemplify the diversity from problem to problem within a subject matter. Thus the coefficient of restitution is appropriate to one prob lem (or narrow subject matter) and the freely falling body to another. Here, because we have moved away from diversities about science as a whole, through divisions of the sci ences, almost to the level of particular researches, the diversity in pattern of research which can be seen is enormous. It is so large that one must legitimately raise the question whether any practicable account of it can be taken, even in specialized programs of education, much less in liberal programs which have broader re sponsibilities. The answer, it seems to me, is twofold. On the one hand, it is quite impossible to "cover" di versity at the level of particular problems, in the sense that survey courses try to "cover" a subject matter. On the other hand, the role of particular invented terms and conceptions in particular conclusions of science is both universal and decisive. Since liberal programs in science have as one aim to impart an understanding of the nature of conclusive formulations in science, illus tration of the part that conceptions and terms play in these conclusions is desirable. Moreover, since liberal programs as well as others in science intend that con clusions learned for their own sake (rather than as ex amples of conclusive formulations) be understood as fully as possible, it follows that the conclusions which are taught should be taught with full cognizance of the meanings and roles of the particular terms involved in them. Thus two tasks can be performed at once. And the economy visible here is multiplied many times if, as will be suggested in detail latter, the whole business of teaching the nature of scientific knowledge be per formed inductively. For such a purpose the teaching materials would be sets of examples of scientific in quiry; each such example would serve simultaneously to impart subject-matter content and to illustrate as pects of the nature of scientific knowledge at many dif ferent levels?from the most specific level at which the paper falls (e.g., inferring causal connections in physi ology from ablation and replacement experiments) through the level of the subscience (e.g., physiology) and the level of the broad special science (biology) to the level of science-as-a-whole. One example will suffice to show the decisive role which terms and conceptions play in both the investi gation of phenomena and the understanding of the con clusions so derived. A few years ago, one interest of biologists in the be havior of lower animals took the form of testing their tropistic response to various stimuli. A tropism meant, among other things, a turning or moving in response to an environmental stimulus. The movement, if it oc curred at all, could be either toward or away from the stimulus, such movements being called "positive" and "negative" tropisms, respectively. An investigation of tropistic response to light of a certain species was at tempted by the usual method of so placing an aquarium containing the animals that light entered it from only one end, the other end being, in consequence, relatively dim. Other environmental factors were presumably equally distributed throughout the length of the aquari um. One responsible investigator performed such an ex periment and reported finding the population of the aquarium bunched very near its light end. He conclud ed, therefore, that the species in question was positive ly phototropic. Another responsible investigator re ported a similar experiment upon the same species in which he found the animals clustered near the dim end of the aquarium. Hence he concluded that the species was negatively phototropic. Attempts to explain the apparent contradiction in terms of interfering environ mental factors and in terms of differences between the two populations of experimental animals failed. Eventually the difficulty was resolved by an exami nation and subsequent rejection of the term "tropism" for this particular purpose. Examination of the meaning of the term clarified its all-or-none characteristic. That is, "tropism" could be answered to in only three ways: it could be positive or negative or not at all. Ignoring</page><page sequence="8">252 The Journal of General Education the zero state, since the experimental results did not require it, it became clear that the simple alternative of positive or negative response implied a similar pair of alternative stimuli, which in this case were lightness and darkness. The terms admitted any degree of un discriminated lightness above some threshold, provided that a sufficient contrast of relative darkness were also available. The absolute intensity of light was not speci fied or suggested by the term "tropism." Discarding it, a third investigator examined the situation in the light of the notion that organisms moved not toward or away from a given stimulus but toward an "optimum intensity" of the stimulus. He was able, operating with this term, to demonstrate that the animals of the first and second investigations were at substantially the same absolute light intensity. Their movement toward the "optimum intensity" had been disguised as "con trary" movements by the interpretation which the term "tropism" had pressed upon the data. Results which appeared contradictory when viewed in terms of "tropism" became consistent and informative when viewed in terms of "optimal intensity." Thus one's choice of terms is seen to emphasize cer tain facts in a situation at the price of obscuring others. One's choice of terms determines what appears rele vant or irrelevant to a study; they indicate, literally point to, the area or aspect of phenomena from which data are to be drawn. It is this general function of terms which needs to be understood if the student is to have an informed understanding of the nature of scientific conclusions. It is identification of the particular terms involved in particular conclusions, and some apprecia tion of what phenomena are not indicated and which are emphasized by the chosen terms, that constitute an adequate understanding of the specific conclusions as valid statements applying to the physical world. To know the existence and effect of terms, moreover, is to grasp the fact that science grows not only by increased precision and discovery of new phenomena but also by redefinition and replacement of terms, so as to illumi nate larger aspects of phenomena or to relate aspects of phenomena previously disjoined. It should be noted that the "tropism" case cited as example is not to be taken as evidence for the universal superiority of "quantitative" over "nonquantitative" forms of knowledge. The tropism concept has been a fruitful source of knowledge and, indeed, has empha sized some aspects of animal behavior obscured by the notion of "optimum intensity." The point is not the superiority of one kind of term over another but the universal and decisive role which is played by terms in scientific knowledge. III. A PREFATORY CODIFICATION OF VARIETIES OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE Presentation of a taxonomy of scientific inquiries would, under any circumstance, be an act of presump tion. Where the taxonomy is for a special purpose, careful statement of limitations in validity are all the more demanded. The tentative schematism to be suggested here does not pretend to be philosophically complete. It is in tended only as a partial aid to the solution of a prob lem in the planning and teaching of a liberal program in the sciences. The problem is whether, in a liberal pro gram, to treat scientific inquiry as consisting of one method or of many. The problem arises because liberal programs are committed to teaching students to under stand the conclusions of science and to understand the nature of scientific knowledge. The problem, then, is whether the nature of scientific knowledge is under stood as far as is useful or necessary for the purposes of liberal education if it is understood only as a single set of general terms. Such sets of terms do exist, and sev eral of them can be defended as applicable to all scien tific inquiry, as suggested earlier in this paper. Science, for instance, is inductive, and what is not inductive is not science. Since induction implies the movement from particulars to more general statements, one can also say that scientific knowledge is a synthesis and inter action of facts and ideas. In these, as in other general descriptions, however, the result is to make the term "science" highly ambiguous, since much humanistic study (e.g., history, philosophy, or art criticism) also moves from particular to general and involves synthe sis of facts and ideas. Hence, even if liberal under standing means only the ability to distinguish science from other kinds of knowledge or inquiry, such uni form and general terms are hardly adequate. Even if general descriptions of science permitted classification of an investigation as scientific rather than historical or other, they would still be inadequate for the purposes of liberal education. Liberal education aims at understanding. For the purposes of understand</page><page sequence="9">The Nature of Scientific Knowledge as Related to Liberal Education 253 ing something, to put it in a class has only a preliminary ?though peculiarly important?function, and this im portant preliminary function is not served by classify ing an investigation as simply scientific. To identify an inquiry as scientific rather than historical has only the same preliminary function as the identification of a pathological state as diabetes or of a book as a novel? namely, to guide one's further actions in respect to the thing classified. In the case of a literary genre we are guided in our reading and appreciation. In the case of a disease we are guided in the treatment aimed at cure or amelioration. In the case of an inquiry aimed at knowledge we are guided to comprehension and evalu ation. Comprehension and evaluation of a scientific in vestigation involves knowing the kind of data em ployed in an investigation. It means knowing the rela tion of the abstracted data to the whole body of phe nomena from which they were drawn. It means know ing the kind of induction employed, that is, the kind of involvement of data with ideas which is used by the in vestigator to convert the particularity of his data into the general character of a scientific conclusion. Since there are several kinds of induction and since there are different kinds of ideas appropriate to different kinds of facts and related each to each in different ways, merely to identify the presence of induction or of in teraction of facts and ideas is not a sufficient guide to comprehension and evaluation. One must know enough of the various kinds to grasp the particular interaction before one. One must know enough of the problems in volved in the verification of each kind of induction or synthesis to estimate the adequacy of the case in ques tion. In brief, operative understanding?knowledge capable of use?concerning inquiry must, like opera tive understanding anywhere, involve both the general and the less general, the concrete as well as the most* abstract. It is this need for generality and generic concreteness which points to the usefulness of a tentative taxonomy, for, if inoperative generality is one extreme, equally in effective chaos is the other. In the one case, one merges all scientific inquiries into an indistinguishable mass. In the other, one equally oversimplifies the pedagogic problem by insisting on the individual difference of every inquiry from every other, on the unique stand ing of every investigation. Both are true. There is something common to all scientific inquiries. There is something unique to every one. These are obvious truths concerning any class and its members, and they are not the points at issue. The point is to find a peda gogically practicable mean between these two peda gogically inoperative extremes?one which will func tion in the student's mind as an aid to the analysis and evaluation of the particular scientific investigation be fore him. It is to this practical purpose that our tentative taxonomy is addressed and not to the theoretical pur pose of an exhaustive treatment of the problem. It is subject, therefore, to the restrictions and modifications applicable to any practical proposal. He who uses it must adapt it by contraction or expansion to the exigen cies of his particular use?exigencies created by his faculty, students, and circumstances. Furthermore, it is not proposed as something to be presented to students to learn, for this could lead only to more detailed place ment of things in categories. It is intended instead as a prefatory guide to the curriculum-planner in his choice of materials and subject matters and as an aid in the analyses of scientific researches which he and his stu dents do. So much for the restricted purpose of a prefatory taxonomy. It also has three serious limitations in sub ject matter, of which the author is aware. Two of these stem from the fact that the scheme is not planned to dis tinguish the main subject-matter divisions of science from one another but treats science as a whole. One consequence of this is that the scheme must inevitably exhibit errors or omissions arising from the author's relative ignorance of those major subject matters in which his training is least. This can be remedied only by time and the criticisms and emendations of others. A second consequence is that, by being directed to sci ence as a whole, matters special to one or another sub ject-matter division are lost. This should be remedied by supplementation. The author has such a supplemen tary schematism of method in biology in process of de velopment. Others in the physical sciences are desir able. A third limitation is that the ]taxonomy presented here treats science only in terms of kind of conclusion, kind of data, and mode of verification. Epistemological and metaphysical considerations are minimized; that is, interpretations and evaluations of scientific as against other modes of knowing are not represented, nor is there any attempt at prescriptive statements about sei</page><page sequence="10">254 The Journal of General Education ence based on epistemological or metaphysical doc trines. A compendium or schematism of interpretative and evaluative views of science is, then, another future agendum. The prefatory taxonomy here presented has been constructed on the basis of three principles. The first principle defines the universe which the taxonomy comprises. The second defines what is meant by a pedagogically significant difference in method. The third principle orders the different methods so dis tinguished. The universe treated by the taxonomy excludes methods which are only possible, hypothetical, or rare. It includes only such methods as correspond to a num ber of recognized and accepted researches in one or several fields of science. The distinguishing definition is as follows: If a pat tern of inquiry is characterized by aiming toward a kind of formulation of its conclusions which can be dis tinguished in form from other inquiries; and if that kind of conclusion requires a kind of data which can be dis tinguished from the data of other inquiries; and if for validation of the conclusion the data are related to the conclusion in a way distinguishable from the relations in other inquiries, then one has a pedagogically significant kind of scientific inquiry. In short, a "method" is de serving of separate consideration if the kind of knowl edge that it aims at is linked to a kind of data and a mode of validation which differ from the kinds of knowledge, data, and mode of verification character istic of other methods. The looseness of this definition would be inexcusable in a theoretical treatment. Its practical justification lies in whatever usefulness the re sults of its employment may have. The third principle orders the distinguished methods according to their complexity and partly according to their incorporation into subsequent methods. Thus the first method is simplest in respect to the ordering among facts which it achieves, and its results are likely to be used as data or principles by methods subsequently de scribed. Taxonomic science.?The most ubiquitous of the kinds of scientific knowledge is taxonomic knowledge. Its ubiquity can be seen in the fact that some kind of classi ficatory schematism lies at the foundation of all the sciences and in the fact that the method is a conspicuous and active feature of modern zoology, botany, medical syndromy, and, to a lesser extent, geology and chem istry. Taxonomy aims to establish a classificatory schema tism as its form of scientific knowledge. Its first, raw data are all the members of the objectively delimited universe to which it addresses itself and all the prop erties of these members which can be discerned. Its method, in theoretic ideal, consists of determining (by "induction") the one or several "essential" properties from among the indefinite number presented by the members of the universe. These essential properties then define a set of classes among which each member of the universe will find a place and only one place. Verification, again in theoretic ideal, consists of demonstrating that the schematism in question does possess the properties of exclusive and exhaustive place ment of the members of the universe. Unfortunately, the conditions for this theoretical ideal either do not exist or are not now acceptable to scientists. The result is that, for each item character istic of the method listed above, there is a "practical" substitute. Conspicuous among the absent or rejected conditions is the notion of "essential" property or prop erties. Some philosophers have warned against the no tion, and many scientists have heeded them. The result is that the notion of "real" species with their "essen tial" features is practically never defended in practice. Instead, properties are chosen and classes established on the basis of these properties, in terms of an intended role or purpose of the schematism in some subsequent body of research aimed at other and more complex kinds of knowledge. Thus in zoology the primary tax onomy of animals is based on properties chosen for their capacity to relate their possessors according to evolu tionary sequence and proximity of a common ancestral group. Thus "blood relationship" defines "real" group ings, and homologous structures (common embryogeny and presumptive common phylogeny) replace essential structures and properties. The result of this inextrica ble involvement of animal taxonomy with evolution is that researches with other interests require other tax onomies which cut across the primary, phylogenetic taxonomy. Ecological studies, for instance, require their own, based upon the environmental niches occupied by organisms or based upon the place of each organism in a web of predator-prey relationships. A similar shift can be seen in the case of the physical</page><page sequence="11">The Nature of Scientific Knowledge as Related to Liberal Education 255 sciences. Early physicists, concerned primarily with dynamics and statics, distinguished "primary" and "secondary" properties (e.g., size, shape, mass, and motion, as against taste, color, odor, texture, etc.) on metaphysical or epistemological grounds. Mechanics retained this same division of properties, but the pri mary properties are now seen as those appropriate to the problems which mechanics treats. As the chemical branch of physical science solved many of its problems and turned to others, more and more of the previously "secondary" properties were admitted to the "pri mary" rank and became involved in chemical taxonomy (e.g., color, taste, solubility, etc.) .12 A second missing condition for an ideal taxonomy is that of an objectively delimited universe. The universes with which each taxonomist deals are bounded, but the boundaries are set by moving, rather than by fixed, cri teria; for, in the last analysis, the universe within which a taxonomy is sought is itself a large class among a number of large classes. These large classes are the products of a taxonomy, usually historical rather than individual in origin, stemming from divisions of the sci ences, specializations of techniques, and the existence of a number of separated theories and consequent groupings of unsolved problems. Thus even the tax onomy of animals differs in some marked respects from plant taxonomy. In practice the universe within which a taxonomic solution is to be found is given to the researcher by the tradition which defines his field of specialization, by the theories which are current and effective, and by the problems which these theories pose. Then, as some of the problems are solved, the theories are revised to com prise the new solutions; the revised theories suggest new dimensions to the taxonomists and propose new problems; the new dimensions and the new problems loosen the boundaries of the universe treated by the taxonomist and admit new members to it. Often the new members of the universe find a place in a hetero geneous or "wastebasket" class developed for them; but eventually they are assimilated thoroughly into the taxonomic system by such revision of the whole sys tem as will allow a place for them appropriate to the theories which introduced them and adequate to the 12 It is interesting to note, however, that mass (weight) and atomic number still play special roles in the periodic table of chemical elements. new problems which these new theories pose. The ma jor shifts in disease taxonomy (syndromy) illustrate the effective relationship between taxonomic and other activities in a science. Hippocratic disease taxonomy is centered around symptom-clusters, prognosis, and amenableness to certain treatments, with physical and personality typing and climatological factors taking a lesser place and material causative agents a role lesser still. With the growth of physiology and pathology and the advent of the germ theory of disease, the taxonomic schematism of disease underwent extensive revision, reflecting the new status given to causes and the con sequent reduced emphasis on other properties of dis ease. At the present time psychosomatic theories are introducing another and similar alteration in medical taxonomy. Physical and personality typing is given greater emphasis; specific physiological and parasitic causes are subordinated to other kinds of causes, and the symptoms themselves are read differently and given new significances. The consequences to the tax onomy are the collapsing of some previously separated disease conditions into one, the separation of former single diseases into two or more, and the identification of new ones. This phase of medicine is, of course, only beginning, and its fate and the extent of the change that it may bring about in disease syndromy are not to be pre dicted. Nevertheless, it illustrates the process of change in taxonomic science and the relations of such change to establish theories and currently given problems. As a consequence of shifting boundaries and criteria, which move with the growth of knowledge, the third property of an "ideal" taxonomy is also lost?the prop erty of exhaustive and exclusive classification of the membership of the universe. These properties are only approached, not reached. Borderline or ambiguous in stances are commonplace, and a few unclassifiables are tolerated. From the point of view of research, then, a practical taxonomic schematism is verified to the extent that its results are effective tools for the problems in which the classified universe is involved and the degree to which the properties of exhaustiveness and exclusiveness are reached within the system. Analogically, for the purposes of liberal study, a given taxonomic system is understood when it is seen as one of several alternatives: when the properties on which it is based are seen in their relevance to repre</page><page sequence="12">256 The Journal of General Education sentative examples of the theories and problems of the field which uses the taxonomy; when the lesser rele vance of other properties to these theories and prob lems are noted; when the classes created by the chosen properties are seen effectively participating in other kinds of researches in the field; and, finally, when some of the doubtful areas of the taxonomy are seen and some of the reasons for their doubtful status under stood. Perhaps nowhere is there such violent contrast be tween common practice in general survey courses and what might be in a liberal program than in respect to taxonomy, especially animal taxonomy. A classifica tion of the invertebrates and vertebrates is usually given with no sign of analysis or criticism, often followed by some single highly arbitrary phylogenetic "tree," prof fered with no more than a vague and general caveat, which then drops out of the student's sight and mind. The student is given access to the properties chosen for criteria and to the classes which they create, but the very existence of alternative properties is usually ig nored and, along with them, the sound and good reasons for the use of the properties chosen. Measurement science.?By "measurement science" I mean a simple, quickly describable pattern of inquiry at the roots of physics and chemistry and presently taking hold in biology. This pattern of inquiry has as its aim the measurement and consequent co-relating of changes in two or more varying, and presumably objective, quantities. The relation of degree of immersion of bodies to their specific gravity in hydrostatics is a fa miliar example. The relation of light intensity to dis tance from source is another. So also is the relation of vibration frequency to length in pendulums and stretched strings, and the behavior of freely falling bodies. This is the kind of science whose fruits are most commonly the referent of the term "scientific law." Here the data required are obviously precise meas urements; and verification is partly synonymous with precision and partly the problem of guaranteeing the absence of any effective variable except the ones meas ured. There are, however, two possible complicating features. One of these complications is the notion of "ideal body" referred to above. Although in some cases what is reported as the fruit of measurement science is some Statistical central tendency of actual measurements, such as mean or mode, it is often true that what is re ported is some "ideal case" toward which actual meas urements can be interpreted as tending. The inverse square law of light intensity, for example, though based on measurements of light from real sources, is itself a report of the behavior of light from a "point" source, which is, by definition, an approachable but not attain able ideal. The notion of such ideal bodies and an under standing of the particular "ideals" involved in a given equation are necessary for a liberal understanding of the fruits of measurement science. The second complication in measurement science arises from the abstractness or unreality of a statement of relations between two or three variables which are studied apart from the N other variables which may normally affect the measured ones. Such abstracted treatment is, of course, an entirely valid mode of in quiry. It is universally a part of science. But its exist ence and possible effect in each given instance should be a part of the liberal understanding of conclusions based upon it. The problem of abstraction will be treated more fully under causal science. Causal science.?The term "cause" has become so generic that it is practically useless for a taxonomy of scientific inquiry. At one time or another it has been used as the name for the product of every kind of re search. Currently it means about the same thing as ex planation and description taken together and undis tinguished. (Hence the commonplace textbook preface statement that "Science is the search for causes" is per fectly true because it merely says what the etymology of the word "science" says, namely, that "science" is the search for knowledge.) "Cause" is made to mean any knowledge whatever about a class of things or events which relates that class to some other class. Con sider, for example, the discovery and report that all members of the class constituted of hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, nitric acid, etc., are made of some vari able factor and a hydrogen ion. When it is interpreted primitively, one has simply identified the constituent material of each member of the class and noted that one such constituent, hydrogen, is common to all members. When interpreted in respect to the class, its material constituent is found to be hydrogen. This invariant con stituent material can then be called the "cause" of acid ity. Thus the "cause" of a class of things can mean sim</page><page sequence="13">The Nature of Scientific Knowledge as Related to Liberal Education 257 ply the material substratum coexistent with a given bundle of other properties. On the other hand, the properties which originally define the class are usually records of the interaction of members of the class with members of other classes. Thus acidity originally meant a sour taste, color changes in certain plant dyes, and combining with bases to form salts. These are events, motions, or changes over a temporal span, and one can ask the question, "What class of events invariably, in our experience, precedes this class of events, e.g., color change in the plant dye, etc.?" The answer to this question is then often called the "cause" of the color change, of the sen sation of sourness, or of the formation of salts. Here "cause" means invariable antecedent event. Yet the color change of the dye, the sour sensation, and the salt formation are the defining properties of acids. Taken together they are acidity. Hence the discovery of the event or events antecedent to these defining events is as much the discovery of the "cause" of acidity as is dis covery of the common material substratum of the things which possess the defining properties. A third sense of "cause" is seen in researches aimed at determining a limiting stable state to a series of events arranged in their causal (in the sense described above) sequence. In such researches one first arranges the classes of events in their causal order as defined, then attempts to determine a stable limiting case in terms of which the preceding series of changes can be understood. The preceding changes or events are in terpreted as tendencies, as steps or stages toward the limiting case, and in this sense the limiting case can be called the "cause" of the preceding events. In this sense "cause" means a concluding or climactic stage in a proc ess. Active research along these lines is rare at the pres ent time, but the products of past research of this kind are constantly in use. A descriptive embryology, for in stance, which failed to relate the changes during em bryogeny to the adult state of the organism would be enormously limited in its value to both practice (medi cine) and theory (experimental embryology). A fourth sense of cause arises when one attempts to combine all three of the kinds of causes into a single, unified scheme. When we see that a class of things made of a given material substrate participates only in certain classes of events (i.e., can have only certain ef fects) and fits only into a certain place in a series, many of us are constrained to act as if this concatenation, too, is not without significance, that there must be a reason (i.e., a "cause") why things made of this kind of matter behave in this way and have this place in a series. There thus arises the notion of a cause of causes, an essential cause. Sometimes the unity thus sought is found by identifying one of the three first-order causes as the es sential one. The place of the class in its series and the ef fects that its members have on members of other classes are understood as derived from the material substrate; or its material substrate and its effects are understood as deriving from its place in its series; and so on. In other instances, however, a distinct quartum quid is sought as the unifying factor. The theory of atomic structure can be seen to play this role. The events in which a given chemical compound can participate, the elements which constitute it, and the place of these ele ments in the Periodic Table are all explainable in terms of the number and arrangement of particles which con stitute the atoms of the elements comprised in com pounds. It is easy to see that the quartum quid in the case of atomic theory?and in many other cases, too?is not a distinct fourth. The particles of the atom are obviously a material sub-substrate of the original compounds. The absence in much research of a distinct fourth kind of cause can be interpreted as part of the rejection of the concept of "essence" mentioned under taxonomic sci ence. Rather than seek a fourth kind of cause, most con temporary scientists prefer that its role of unifying other causes be realized by pressing one of the other three farther back: one seeks the material element of elements; attempts to place two or more series into a series of series; links antecedent-subsequent chains into larger and more complex webs. What disposition are we to make of this congeries in a taxonomy of patterns of inquiry? In view of the confusion and ambiguity introduced by calling these several patterns of inquiry "causal," it would be helpful if we could distribute all of them into other parts of the scheme. To a great extent this can be done without vio lence to truth and with a net gain in pedagogic useful ness. Most researches aimed at discovery of material substrates are understandable for the purpose of liberal education as contributors to taxonomies, as one part of the problem of establishing useful categories and of placing members therein. Some part of antecedent-sub</page><page sequence="14">258 The Journal of General Education sequent research can also be interpreted intelligibly in the same way. Another part of it is reducible to re searches aimed at correlating quantitative variables. In similar fashion a large part of researches aimed at estab lishing limiting cases to steps and stages are interpr?t able in taxonomic terms, with the addition of the notion of hierarchical relation among the members of the class along with the notion of simple inclusion. Finally, al most all cases of research aimed at second-order causes (causes of causes) fall under the heading of analogical or as-if science, yet to be described. However, when every defensible disposition of "causal" cases to other categories is made and every de fensible translation into other terms of the notions in volved in cause is achieved, there is a residuum. Some researches will fit into other categories only by Pro crustean cutting and omitting. There is, in short, a kind of problem which requires a category other than tax onomy, quantitative correlation, and analogical rela tion. Moreover, this kind of problem shares sufficiently in the notions of cause outlined here to justify its being so named. This causal science is found wherever some system of mutually interacting and mutually determined parts acts as a concerted whole. Such systems are seen in their most complicated and eminent degree in the subject matters of physiology and sociology. In the one science the organism is such a system; in the other, society.13 The defining features (interaction, mutual determina tion, and concerted action) are clearly seen in both cases. In the case of society, interaction is seen in the extent to which the actions of each member of a com 13 By linking the biological organism and society as two examples here, there is no intention of spinning a loose analogy whereby what is found true of biological organisms is also alleged of societies. Before such an analogy can be taken seriously, it would have to be shown that the relations of parts to the whole in each are sub stantially the same in three respects: (1) the extent to which each part's existence and activity are made possible by and subordinated to the whole; (2) in respect to the kinds of activities which are subordinated; (3) in respect to the nature of the relations which bind the parts to con stitute the whole. These similarities have not been demon strated and, as far as this author can see, do not exist. Society is a different kind of system, an "organism" in a sense as different from a biological organism as is, say, the "organism" of an organic molecule with its respective radicals occupying their places in its structure and playing their respective 4'roles" in the pharmacological effects of the molecule. munity affect what others do. Mutual determination is seen in the extent to which it is true that the individual is a vicious abstraction?that is, the extent to which the traits and characteristics, the attitudes, abilities, and personality, of each "individual" are determined by his community and his part in it both as child and as adult. Concerted action is seen wherever communities act in relation to one another or in relation to a circumstantial problem. In the case of the biological organism the same de fining functions hold. The interaction of parts is the commonplace of physiological regulation, of mainte nance of the internal environment. Mutual determina tion during development is the prime subject matter of embryology. Concerted action is, of course, the very sense of the term "organism." Restricting ourselves, now, only to physiology, the problem of understanding such a subject matter as the organism is posed by the fact that the whole organism is far too complex to be understood in its unanalyzed unity. On the other hand, analysis for the sake of ex perimentation and understanding leaves us only with ab stract knowledge of parts and pieces, radically altered by the very isolation which is required for experimenta tion. There is the further problem of somehow recon structing knowledge of the whole from our merely com pendious knowledge of the parts. A start is made by the simple methods of ablation and addition. One simply removes a part or doubles a part of the organism and notes the differences between the nonnormal experimental organism and the normal. The variants of this primitive pattern are codified in J. S. Mill's "Four Methods of Experimental Inquiry."14 These four methods?the Method of Difference, of Agreement, of Residues, and of Concomitant Variation ?are the basis of a major part of the oversimplified and uninterpreted "scientific method" of elementary physi ology textbook prefaces. The prototype of this uninterpreted version of Mill is given by the question, "What organ or other part of the organism performs function X?" or by the converse, "What is the function of organ (or other part) X?" Says the Method of Difference: Consider the organs or parts A, B, C, D, F, among which previous knowledge gives us reason to think is the part which performs func 14 Mill, op. cit., Book III, chaps, vii and viii.</page><page sequence="15">The Nature of Scientific Knowledge as Related to Liberal Education 259 tion X. By surgery, chemistry, or pathology remove or inhibit the action of organ A. Note whether function X has or has not disappeared. Repeat with each organ and each combination of organs. The results then tell us, says the oversimplified version of Mill, the sufficient and necessary cause or causes of function X. In the re verse experiment, the role of organ X in the intact or ganism is said to be given by the observed functional de ficiencies in an organism lacking organ X. Such an interpretation of the method of physiology would give us a catalogue of organs, each with its sepa rate functions. This would be sound knowledge, were the animal or plant body assumed to be a compendium of objectively separable functions and anatomical parts. An organism, however, is a system whose parts and functions mutually determine one another and act in concert. Says Haldane: When we speak of the "function" of an organ and re gard this function as what it does to restore the internal environment we are thinking in terms of a misleading con ception of what an organ is and what an organism is : for we are thinking of only one side of its activities to the exclusion of others which are just as important. To put this into philosophical language we are thinking abstractly, or regarding only a part of the reality we are dealing with. We can speak more correctly of a function of a part of a machine: for this does nothing else than fulfill its function provided the machine is assumed to be perfect and stable. In a living organ however we are dealing with something of which the functions, if we speak of functions, are end less, since the activities are endless, constantly seeming to grow in number as we investigate further.15 Haldane could have said (and later does say) the same thing concerning anatomy as he here says of physiology: anatomizing (whether gross, microscopic, or chemical) yields parts which, if we can speak of parts, are abstractions. They are so far abstract rather than real "parts" that each "part" which is separated by anatomy and used for the purpose of research con cerning functions can fruitfully be coupled with an other "part" to constitute a larger and more compli cated "part" or be further analyzed into smaller "parts," all of which, when employed in the Mill meth ods, yield more knowledge which must be built into the knowledge previously sought and found in terms of other degrees and ways of anatomizing. These constitute two factors, then, which must be taken into account when interpreting the results of ablation and addition experimentation: the functions are abstractions, and knowledge framed in terms of them must be understood as restricted and qualified by the mode of abstraction. Parts or separated structures are also abstractions, and functions ascribed to them must be taken as meaningful only as related to researches which employ more minutely analyzed parts and more complexly related parts. These two factors are related to the notions of concerted action and interaction found in the definition of organism. The third note of the definition?mutual determina tion?points to a third factor in terms of which iso lated researches must be interpreted and related to other inquiries. There is sufficient evidence of "regula tion" in even the most complex of organisms to make it highly improbable that an organism minus a part pre sents a functioning minus precisely the "normal" func tion of the part removed. There is too much known of "double insurance," compensation, and adjustment in the organism to assume that in any case of ablation some aspects of the normal role of the organ removed have not been compensated for?"taken over"?by what is left. Conversely, one cannot be sure but that some nor mal roles of organs anatomically intact have not been altered by the removal of another part. Thus the symp toms of diabetes following removal of the pancreas are far less acute if the pituitary gland is also re moved. The limitations here cited do not, of course, affect the validity of researches of this kind but only their oversimplified interpretation. In the progress of in quiry the anatomical identification of the adrenal glands is followed by their removal in physiological research. The complex of functions thereby discovered points toward further anatomical analysis of the adrenals and discovery of two anatomically separable parts, the cortex and the medulla. Separate querying of the func tions of these parts leads to still finer analysis into more minute realms of histology and thence to chemical and physical "parts" and "functions." Thus more and more numerous, accurate, and detailed statements of func tions are derived. However, this progress opens the need for more in quiry in the contrary direction. As our knowledge of parts and functions becomes more numerous, detailed, and precise, the problem of infractions and /wterrela 15 John Scott Haldane, Organism and Environment (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1917), pp. 84-85.</page><page sequence="16">260 The Journal of General Education rions of these parts and functions becomes more press ing. The more parts we know more about, the more onerous and difficult is the problem of understanding their interconnections and thus constituting from our knowledge of the parts the knowledge of the whole which is our aim. "Causal" research, then, upon a subject matter which is a complex of interacting and mutually deter mined parts constitutes a kind of science with its own problems of procedure and interpretation, differing widely from other patterns of inquiry. For a liberal understanding of the results of such researches, the student must be aware of the problems posed by the organism as a subject matter. He must be prepared to discover, in the records of such research, answers to the questions of what kinds of "parts" are being treated, what analysis of "functions" is being employed, how these "parts" and "functions" are related to the parts and functions of other related researches, and how, if at all, the researcher in question relates his discovered functions and parts to one another to constitute larger units more nearly approaching the unity of the organism as a whole. Relational (analogical) science.?By "relational sci ence" I mean those patterns of inquiry which are most fully understood as aiming toward knowledge which at tempts to "explain" or "account for" matters previous ly known by inventing co-related quantities which do not have one-to-one literal correlates among the phe nomena to be accounted for, or by inventing mechanisms not directly accessible to observation but so conceived and applied to the phenomena to be explained that it can be said that certain things behave as if these mechanisms existed. This pattern of inquiry may also be called "analogi cal," since it may be described as applying relations seen among one group of phenomena to another and thereby establishing a new relation among the two bodies of phenomena?the relation of analogy. The core of the method may be described in three steps. It consists, first, of the "borrowing" of sets or systems of relations dissociated from the relata among which they were found. The second step consists of finding those aspects of the phenomena under consideration which can be fitted as relata to the borrowed system of rela tions. The third step consists of elaborating the rela tions or adding or substituting others so as to assimilate more and more of the aspects of the phenomena under consideration into the system of relations. Description in these terms throws an interesting light on a much-discussed point of scientific knowledge ?the respective advantages of mathematical as against "model" explanations. Examined in the terms used here, this question reduces to a matter of two different sources from which relations may be "borrowed." In the case of "model" explanations, they are borrowed from other systems of physical things. In the case of mathematical explanations the borrowed relational sys tem is a pure one, connecting no relata whatever until employed by the physicist or other relational scientist. Certain advantages and disadvantages of each source are immediately obvious. Because mathematical sys tems of relations are free of physical relata, they are in definitely flexible and various. They may take any form that the inventiveness of the mathematical genius can provide. As such, they constitute a source of novel and complicated systems of relations whose production is not limited by the progress of physical science. On the other hand, to employ the knowledge of pre vious physical science (the term "physical" is here be ing used in contradistinction to the purely relational) is to tap still another source of relational systems of probably equal value. Systems borrowed from real re lata have, however, one peculiarity in their use: the scientist who borrows them is usually never quite com pletely able to dissociate the relations themselves from the relata which they originally contained. The result is that he is both stimulated and restricted by the ghosts of these relata. He is stimulated in the sense that the ghost relata suggest ways of applying his borrowed re lations to new phenomena. He is also stimulated or as sisted by the ghost relata, in that they themselves func tion as connections or relations to still other phenomena with other relations on which the scientist may draw for needed additions or complications of his system. They act as restrictions in so far as they may blind the scientist to flexible uses of his relational system through restricting his examination of new phenomena to as pects suggested by the ghost relata but which are not necessary restrictions in the use of the relations. Thus many students of modern atomic theory have difficulty freeing themselves from the habit of trying to translate the mathematical relations which describe atomic struc</page><page sequence="17">The Nature of Scientific Knowledge as Related to Liberal Education 261 ture into relations familiar in our experience of grosser bodies. As representative of this kind of scientific knowl edge, an interpretation of the Mendelian gene theory of heredity illustrates certain aspects of it which will be useful to our conclusions concerning science education. According to this interpretation, one emphasizes, first, the absence of one-to-one relations between the data and the terms of the theory. One notes that the immedi ate subjects of observation?the data?are simply the numbers of individuals in successive generations which resemble one parent, the other, or neither. These num bers are converted into ratios, and generalizations are then made concerning the ratio of offspring of given types to be expected from parents of specified types. So far, one has the kind of knowledge second in our list? the co-relating of variable and presumably objective quantities. It concerns hereditary characters, visible as pects of the organisms studied. Mendel now turns to a discussion of quite another subject?hereditary factors, unobserved, unmeasured, taken as the causal precursors of the hereditary char acters and assigned such frequencies and behaviors dur ing germ-cell production and fertilization as would ac count for the ratios and combination series of char acters. At this point two different interpretations are pos sible. On the one hand, one can take the position that the "factors" of heredity and their postulated behavior constitute a physically stated model of the expansion of a binomial to the second power and of the combinations which are the products of two or more squared bi nomials. According to this interpretation, further re search would consist largely of investigation of more varied and more complex breeding situations, with con sequent complication of the algebra of particles which describes the results obtained. From such a point of view the hereditary factor has only a conventional status; it is a simple, clear, and economical way of talk ing and thinking about the relative numbers and com binations of hereditary characters. On the other hand, Mendel's discussion of heredi tary factors may be taken as a hypothesis concerning real, physical things?a hypothesis to be verified by an actual, visual search designed to reveal such particles, if they exist, and to make way for a direct investigation of their properties. According to this interpretation, the failure of such a search, after an appropriate interval, would require that the notion of such particles, how ever convenient for descriptive and predictive purposes, be dropped in favor of some other which would again be subject to direct, sensory discovery for validation. (In historical fact, both these interpretations were enter tained and both kinds of research pursued success fully.) Under the convenient, or conventional, conception, however, use of the notions, whether the particles were found to have physical existence or not, would continue to be proper as long as the notions were convenient and economical devices of description. Moreover, revision of the properties assigned to the particles could take place at each discovery of new aspects of breeding phe nomena without reference to possible real properties of real particles. Conversely, if it should prove desirable to bring knowledge of breeding behavior into relation with knowledge of some other phenomena and if the new combination proved refractory to subsumption un der the particle theory, the theory could be dropped forthwith in favor of some other which would serve the new and larger purpose. From this contrast the nature of the data for such a mode of inquiry and what it requires for verification be come clearer. The data appropriate for such an investi gation are any data whatever which can be related to one another by being related to the borrowed model or system of mathematical relations. There is an important corollary to this conclusion, suggesting a balancing dis advantage to the breadth and freedom of investigation which characterizes this kind of scientific knowledge: Since any data which can be subsumed under the given model or system are appropriate, then any which cannot be so subsumed are inappropriate. This apparently empty negative assumes significance if one asks what might happen were a given model or system to prove extraordinarily successful. Should such a system or model be especially clear, precise, and economical in its subsumption of a given large body of data but be in capable of bringing that body of data into relation with some other, it is a question whether the previously suc cessful model would willingly be dropped in favor of one which, though it subsumed both bodies of data, did so clumsily and uneconomically by contrast with the first. In such a situation previous success might tend to prevent the co-relation of phenomena which might prof</page><page sequence="18">262 The Journal of General Education itably be related. Whether this extreme of conserva tism occurred or not, it is clear that the data which would be sought by scientists in possession of a success ful system or model would be those suggested by the model and its previously subsumed data. In short, one is forced to note that not only do data in part determine theory but that, conversely, theory tends to a similar degree to determine what data are sought and co-related to each other. Theory certifies the relevance of data as much as data certify the validity of theory. What constitutes verification of this mode of knowl edge also becomes clear. It consists, in the first place, of the precision and completeness with which the sys tem in question subsumes the data for which it was chosen. In the second place, the curiously aesthetic cri teria of simplicity, economy, austerity, and elegance apply. And, in the third place, the capacity of the sys tem to assimilate new data?that is, to exhibit relevance and connection among phenomena previously unrelated in our knowledge?takes a high place. Here, then, are four modes of scientific investiga tion, four species of inquiry, distinguished in terms of the form of knowledge which they seek, the data that they require, and the canons of validity that they em ploy. The differences among them are such that the conclusions arrived at by each can be well understood and evaluated only if one has operative, effective knowledge of their mode of validation and of the diffi culties of interpretation, limitations, and qualifications which stem from the data sought, the formulations aimed at, and the relation of these data to the formulated conclusions. Without this knowledge, the conclusions so achieved by science are only half-appreciated or more than half-misunderstood. With this knowledge, on the other hand, the student is prepared to evaluate and comprehend the fruits of science. And by coming to such knowledge through informed discussion of the records of such inquiries, by an inductively aimed anal ysis of scientific works, the student comes to knowl edge both of nature and of scientific inquiry; he learns to appreciate both the subject matters of science and science as a subject matter. The study of "method" and the study of "content" rather than divorced, to the im poverishment of each, are thoroughly wedded, to the enrichment of both. Scientific knowledge thus gained is least likely to be parrot-knowledge, for the student knows each conclusion in terms of the evidence which established it, the competitions with alternative formu lations through which it has won its way, and the revi sions which it has undergone in the continuing process of inquiry. Knowledge about science thus gained could not be parrot-knowledge, for there will have been no speeches or prefaces about science to copy. Instead, the knowledge will be operational?gained, practiced, and perfected by operations of analysis, comparison, con trast, and criticism practiced upon varied examples of scientific inquiry. Before we go on to a summary discussion of the edu cational implications of this diversity of science, one generic feature of the four species here described should be pointed out. This feature is related to the notion of the cumulative character of scientific inquiry, the idea of an ongoing process of inquiry which always assimi lates the past into the present and prepares present knowledge for assimilation into knowledge of the fu ture. This cumulative character of science is often pointed out in general terms. Here in the four species described we see its origin and nature. In taxonomic sci ence the need for a taxonomic system arises from the pressure of unsolved problems of many kinds. The schematism constructed successfully in the light of these needs solves many of the problems which gave rise to it. In this sense the taxonomy is seen to assimi late the past knowledge which generated the problems which, in turn, gave rise to the taxonomic system. But, in turn, the knowledge realized in the solutions stem ming from the taxonomic scheme give rise to new prob lems, usually involving new data. A solution of these new problems requires a new taxonomy, and the cycle repeats itself again and again. The same tentative character is seen in the other species of inquiry; each conclusion of science not only solves one problem but creates another; each kernel of scientific knowledge contains the germ of its own revi sion by pointing toward matters hitherto unknown and unrelated to one another. In causal knowledge of or ganisms each bit of anatomical knowledge gained through hypotheses stemming from physiology or pathology points back to needed revisions in the parent physiology or pathology. Conversely, physiological knowledge gained through an inquiry which began with a given anatomical analysis points to revision or en largement of its anatomical parent. In analogical sei</page><page sequence="19">The Nature of Scientific Knowledge as Related to Liberal Education 263 ence the understanding of a body of phenomena gained by setting them in a chosen system of relations points to new phenomena not previously subsumed. The as similation of new phenomena into the old requires re vision, emendation, or even substitution of new systems of relations, and so on. It is this ongoing, unclosed char acter of science which creates the crucial problem of liberal understanding of scientific conclusions. And it is grasp of the specific origins of each kind of ongoing tentativeness which is the starting place for a solution to this problem of liberal understanding. IV. SOME EDUCATIONAL IMPLICATIONS We have tried to describe three kinds of diversity in and about science: (1) diversity of doctrines concern ing the nature of science; (2) broad diversities in sci ence, stemming from espousal by scientists of different doctrines of method; (3) specific diversities in patterns of inquiry related to differences of subject matters and problems in the several sciences. From all or parts of each of these come problems to face the architect of a liberal program in the sciences. We shall first state the problems, then proffer a sys tematic solution to the group of them. The fact of diversity itself poses the problem; for to ignore it in an educational program creates in our graduates evils and inadequacies some of which are of deep seriousness and are obvious and visible in our stu dents' behavior. One brute fact is that the natural world is a complicated affair, and no scientist worthy of the name pretends that the world in all its complications is successfully ensnared in even today's successful science. A second brute fact is that science is complicated; sci entists who have engaged in research can view only with impatience the claim of any single system of logic, any one theory of history, any broad, sweeping philo sophic view, that it describes and explains the problems which the scientist faces in his effort to wrest knowl edge from the world. He may find the effort to explain his activities an interesting and fruitful one; he can no more accept one of several competitive views of his ac tivities as definitive than he can accept one of two com peting theories in science as definitive. If, in the face of this, we teach the conclusions of science as simple and definitive solutions to its prob lems and, similarly, teach our personal choice of con clusions about science, we set in motion a train of evils. In the first place, we block progress toward one of the most widely held, if impossible, goals of liberal science training: to provide the student with an adequate pic ture of the world. To give a simple picture of a com plicated world is not to give the scientist's picture of that world. By so doing we make the picture not only inadequate (which it will always be) but false. In the second place, by giving a simple picture of science we give the students a conception of the nature and magni tude of an intellectual problem shockingly different from a sound conception. What can we expect from this falsification, repeated ad nauseam throughout their train ing, except men who will find only frustration when they meet problems in all their magnitude and compli cation, or who will blindly simplify and vulgarize them until they fit the measure that we have taught. The three kinds of diversity sharpen and specify these problems. Ignorance of diverse doctrines about science not only will be a contribution to the generic evil of oversimplification but, specifically, will generate academic chauvinism and intellectual intolerance. We have all seen these in two forms, not only in our stu dents but in ourselves. One form which they take is the elevation of science above other scholarly disciplines, largely by elevating science to a level of definitive truth that it cannot rightfully claim and by denigrating the social studies and humanities to the level of sophis tical refutations and defenses of opinions or to preoccu pation with the unimportant. The effective and positive contrary to this state of mind is not respectful but unin formed ignorance. It is rather an informed understand ing of the several disciplines by which man solves his problems and creates his worlds. It is to this under standing that an examination of diverse views about science makes one of its most direct contributions; for it is here that the similarities and the differences among man's several paths to truth emerge most clearly. It is only here that one can see the complex pattern of rela tions which bind the questions that men ask to the facul ties that they have for answering them and to the world in which the raw stuff of answers lies. It is only here in the same sense that it is only in physics that one learns about falling bodies. Knowledge of both falling bodies and the processes of human inquiry can be acquired otherwise. But they cannot otherwise be acquired sys tematically and with economy. The second form of intellectual intolerance is the</page><page sequence="20">264 The Journal of General Education corruption of discussion into debate: the transformation of a process of mutual aiming toward better approxima tion to truth into polemical defense and attack. Discus sion starts with the clear admission by all participants that one's own conclusions are based only on an incom plete view of the problem in hand. Discussion assumes that other participants may have seen more, or at least have seen other, facets of the problem. Discussion as sumes, moreover, that differences in view (quite literal ly differences in view) can be understood and related to one another in such a manner that inferences from the larger and more encompassing whole can be made and understood and can replace the narrower and less com plete views with which discussion began. Such discus sion is a habit as well as a body of skills. It must begin with such experience as makes emphatic the complex ity of problems and the incompleteness of answers. It must continue with such experiences repeated again and again. And it must go on to mastery of the skills by which the different facets of different kinds of problems are recognized, fitted to one another, and employed as basis for better, but still tentative, conclusions. This means, first, that where diversities exist within the sub ject matters of liberal education that fact itself should not be obscured. Second, the mere fact of diversity must be supplemented by substantial samples of it. Finally, the diversities themselves must be treated, not merely exhibited. Na?ve relativism which replaces a dogma with diversity of dogma is no net gain. One must go on to instruction and exercise in the disciplines of com parison, contrast, choice, and synthesis appropriate to the field in which the diversity occurs. These state ments are applicable to the fields of science itself, as well as to the field which treats science as its subject matter. In the latter case examples of interpretations of science?including the historical, philosophical, and methodological?would be read, discussed, and ana lyzed. They would be so analyzed in terms of the cri teria appropriate to historical, philosohpical, or meth odological problems and treatments. In the former case instruction and exercise would treat examples of scientific investigation. It would edu cate, encourage, and exercise the student in applying ap propriate canons of comprehension and evaluation to such examples of scientific inquiry. It is here that the vareties of scientific inquiry again become relevant; for from these come the notions of data and evidence and relation of conclusion to evidence which determine what comprehending and critical queries are appropri ate to the scientific investigation in question. However, the act of critical analysis must begin with a decision as to the particular pattern of inquiry with which one is dealing; for this will determine what questions to put to the scientific paper and what kinds of answers one can expect. Since this is so, it follows that categories and kinds of investigation?scientific or otherwise? must be learned as operative judgments, not as mere schema named and described but not employed. The existence of varieties of scientific investigation also sharpens the need for sound knowledge of science itself. Even where the conclusions of science are to be understood only in relation to the physical world which they order and describe, and not as examples of the fruits of inquiry, they cannot be understood alone. Their meaning resides in the data that they subsume and the manner of subsumption. lb say that a dog is a mammal; that A causes B; that F = MA; that atoms have such-and-such arrangements of particles or fields are enormously ambiguous statements taken alone. They are ambiguous not only because of the uncertain meaning of such technical nouns as "mammal," "force," "field," and "electron" but also because of a similar ambiguity in the meaning of such apparently common words as "is" in the sense of classificatory in clusion, "cause," the notion of transitive relation in the sign for "equals," and the notion of "is" in the sense of having a nature or structure. Thus the varieties of sci entific investigation pose the problem of adequate in struction in science, even when and if the aim of in struction is limited to the conclusions of science them selves. The pedagogic problems can be summarized as fol lows: how diversity in science and diversity about sci ence can be treated in a fraction of a college career, es pecially in view of the hierarchies of diversity which exist?that is, in view of the fact that scientific re searches exhibit not only a few broad differences based on doctrinal grounds but also, within these broad dif ferences, more specific differences related to species of problems and subject matters; and, within the species, still more particular but important differences involv ing particular terms and conceptions employed upon particular problems. lb this summary problem a summary solution can</page><page sequence="21">The Nature of Scientific Knowledge as Related to Liberal Education 265 be proposed. The broad doctrinal differences in science, the specific differences, and the particular differences do not require independent exemplifications. Moreover, the exemplification of all need not be done independent ly of subject-matter mastery; for any good scientific paper is all of these at once. It is the bearer of a portion of the knowledge in its field. It "illustrates itself" as an example of scientific investigation. It illustrates the species of which it is a member and the genus to which its species belongs. (Moreover, it is a datum to the his torian, philosopher, and methodologist, a point we will consider next.) Since it is all these, a knowledge of the paper can become a contribution to the student's knowl edge of each of these not only in turn but to some extent simultaneously. All that is required is that instruction teach the student to ask the question of a given paper which directs his attention to each of these aspects of the paper. There will be questions directed to the com prehension of the conclusions of the paper: What was the problem that the author set out to solve? What are the terms in which he seeks his conclusion? What, for him, were the data appropriate to such a problem? What difficulties did he encounter in gathering such data? How did he overcome them? In what ways did he treat the data in order to move from them to conclusions? What larger aspects of the phenomena treated were ex cluded by the formulation of the problem? What, then, is the area or sense in which the conclusions are valid? These questions and the seeking for answers to them in a scientific paper would be aimed primarily at mastery of the paper's conclusions, at understanding the subject matter of science. The paper would not be treated naively as a perfectly transparent and plane-parallel window looking out onto an immediately knowable world. But neither, on the other hand, would such ques tions treat it as a datum of history or philosophy. Now, however, on subsequent papers, couple each such question as those above with questions calling for comparison and contrast: How does A's notion of the problem differ from B's? What shifts in terms or their meanings can be noted? What difference in treatment of the data can be noted as stemming from differences in formulation of the prob lem or of terms? By seeking the answers to such questions as these, the student will add to his informed and qualified under standing of conclusions a growing understanding of the magnitude of problems in science, the strengths and weaknesses of scientific ways of solving them, and the varieties of ways of solving them. He will, moreover, be teaching himself to ask such questions of papers that he will later read and even, perhaps to prefer, for read ing, materials worth such questioning. Finally, he will be teaching himself to read and understand. He will be liberating himself to some extent from the need for a living teacher. And this last is the sign and sense of a liberal education. The first part, then, of a systematic solution to the problems posed here is that liberal programs in science consist of (or contain) original records of scientific re search, series of papers containing the knowledge of whatever subject matters seem appropriate and treated analytically and critically in the ways and for the ends suggested above. One will certainly sacrifice thereby the alleged "coverage" claimed by survey courses, but it can be questioned whether the loss is real, since it is questionable whether the "coverage" seen in arrays of lecture topics and syllabus tables of contents is ever "coverage" by the student; he may "cover" but he rarely "contains." What one gains by this sacrifice can be minds aware of what a problem is and what a solution is; men and women committed and habituated to thoughtfulness and flexibility of mind within the limits of their powers and to the extent that time and energy and informed dedication are devoted by teach ers to helping them become so. The second and last part of the systematic solution here proposed is that doctrines about science be avoided in the science program proper and appear in a separate and later course devoted to them. This is for two rea sons with a common base. The common base is that we do not want merely to substitute a conspectus of dog mas for a single dogma but to make the treatment of di verse doctrines about science serve not only the pur pose of informing the student of the complexities of sci ence, philosophy, and history but also as the occasion again for the learning and exercise of analytic and criti cal skills. This base supports two reasons for placing doctrines and interpretations of science in a separate and later course. The first of these is that philosophical and historical doctrines concerning science are, by analogy to science, theories concerning the significances of sci entific activities. As such, their data are the records of</page><page sequence="22">266 The Journal of General Education scientific activities, the journals and monographs of science. It would be unscientific indeed to treat any theory apart from its data, and no less so for historical and philosophical theories. Thus the later and separate course in the nature of scientific (and perhaps other) knowledge would fall back upon the earlier substantive courses as data and, at the same time, would serve to integrate and relate the earlier courses to one another. The second reason for placing doctrines about sci ence in a separate and later course is a practical one. The doctrines, as has been said, are the products of his torical or philosophical disciplines. Their criticism and analysis depend, then, on methods and criteria appro priate to these disciplines and differing from those ap propriate to scientific works. Such materials require men trained to teach them. Ideally, the faculty of a lib eral program can be expected to possess diciplines be yond the ones learned in their profession, but practically they will come to possess them only by participation in courses which require and evoke them and which are manned in the first instance by teachers who have them already. This suggests a program established by phi losophers and historians from whom the scientists can learn, just as it would be wise for the science part of the program to be established by scientists from whom the historians and philosophers would learn. Such an ad ministrative procedure has an advantage beyond ade quate staffing. It would create a situation in which? in respect to one subject, at least?each staff member would be undergoing the same liberal training intended for the students. And liberal training is infectious.</page></plain_text>
