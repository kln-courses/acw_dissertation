Also of note are the Anatolian features of the very unusual Red Slip Wheelmade goblets; Hennessy (Stephania, 46) was probably the first to isolate this ware, and to suggest the direction from which it may have come. Unusual is the very large number of bull rhyta (at least thirteen). Though they are familiar enough in other LC cemeteries, they have never before been found in such numbers in individual tombs. Unlike Morphou and Ayia Irini, there are no Aegean imports of LM/LH I/II date. The earliest is the piriform jar ('three-handled amphora' is a term to avoid) T 2B: 123, which should be LH IIIA1, rather than LH IIIA2 as suggested. Apart from the conical rhyton fragment T 2B:213c the Mycenaean vases are the types most frequently found in Cyprus. The suggested identification of the storage stirrup jar T 2A: 193 as Late Minoan III may be correct; fabric description would have been useful - the piece is a candidate for clay analysis. Courtois does justice to the most interesting single object, the boat model T 2B:249 + 377, which takes its place with the very similar, long neglected models from Maroni, now in London, whose importance was first appreciated by R. S. Merrillees, Cypriot B.A. Potteryfound in Egypt (Lund, 1968). Jane Johnson, Maroni de Chypre (G6teborg, 1980) compares the funerary use of boat-models in Cyprus with the boat-bearer on the Hagia Triadha sacrophagos, without pressing the point. It is particularly to be regretted these tombs were found disturbed, for their use coincided with the MCIII-LCI transition, which saw the evolution of 'new' pottery classes from antecedent categories some of whose origins go back to the beginning of the Bronze Age, and witnessed the rapid growth of overseas exchanges and the introduction of new wares to Cyprus. All this is mirrored in the material, but the robbing has denied close knowledge of what went with what. But, unless robbing has distorted the relative proportions of Wares represented, it is significant that so little Black-on-Red ware occurs, that there are no standard White Shaved ware juglets, and that there is no Tell el Yahudiyeh ware at all. Regional variation in Bronze Age Cyprus is well established; this aspect of the LC period is highly complex, for though many features exist to distinguish widely separated sites from each other, they also have much in common. The Kazaphani material reinforces this most powerfully. Ino Nikolaou and her associates are most warmly to be congratulated on ensuring that the Kazaphani finds will stand as a worthy memorial to a man who loved his homeland and served it well.

Oxford University Press 1990</page><page sequence="2">416 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW of Antiquities, Cyprus. Veronica Tatton-Brown, who is editor of the volume, is a well-known scholar of Archaic and Classical Cyprus, as well as being Assistant Keeper responsible for the Cypriot collection, and architect of its splendid new display. In his brief Preface the Keeper, Mr B. F. Cook, acknowledges the help this publication has received from the A. G. Leventis Foundation. Students of the Cypriot Iron Age, sensu stricto, will not find a great deal of direct concern to them in these fourteen papers (there would have been fifteen, but one contributor was unable to submit a text), for, apart from J. N. Coldstream's very valuable 'Early Greek Visitors to Cyprus' (with which should be taken his paper in RDAC 1988 (2)) the upper limit of discussion is the eighth century, most papers are concerned with Archaic and Classical Cyprus, and five contributions discuss Imperial Roman topics. It is no doubt a sign of changing times that there were no Swedish contributors, and no paper considered Cypriot ceramic problems. It is symptomatic of the greatly increased academic interest in the archaeology and history of Cyprus that this should be so; Dr Karageorghis' career has a great deal to do with this overdue change of climate. In order of appearance, the papers which seem of greatest interest to Cypriot archaeologists include F. G. Maier's 'Palaces of Cypriot Kings', in which he continues his offensive against sloppy interpretation of archaeological evidence already deployed effectively in his 'Kinyras and Agapenor' in Cyprus Between the Orient and the Occident (1986) and his JHS 105 (1985) paper 'Factoids in Ancient History'. Palatial buildings have been excavated in whole (Vouni) or part (Palaepaphos); there may be others at Soloi and Idalion, but little is known of them. The chief inspiration for Vouni and Palaepaphos seems Achaemenid; this says something of the style of government in these Cypriot city kingdoms. A fine paper is M. Yon and A. Caubet 'Ateliers de Figurines a Kition', an elegant study of classes of small Archaic terracotta statuettes found in Larnaka (Kition) or attributable to it. The old Iron Age series, chiefly of goddess figures with raised arms, was replaced in the sixth century by a diverse series that reflects the development of Phoenician culture in Kition. Of special interest are the numerous figures of dea tyria gravida type, very rare elsewhere. Local variation in cult practice seems hinted at by the marked difference in terracotta assemblages from one major site to another; at Kition, for instance, there are no figures illustrating daily life comparable with types familiar at Amathus and Salamis. S. Phoenicia (the area from Sidon to the plain of Akko) may well have influenced these trends at Kition. In 'The Cypriot contribution to Archaic Greek glyptic', Sir John Boardman looks again at the relative abundance of Cypriot associations among the 36 % of Archaic Greek gems details of whose find place survive with a view to determining whether some, or any of the groups were cut in Cyprus. It is still likely that the Group of the Cyprus Lions was made on the island; other groups (e.g., the Semon Master) were very popular there, but there is no intrinsic need for them to have been made there. The subject, clearly, is a difficult one. Since the 1968 publication by G. Schmidt of Samos VII Kyprische Bildwerke aus dem Heraion von Samos numerous new finds of Cypriot material have been made. Some of these are described by H. Kyrieleis. The material comes from two wells abandoned and sealed by c. 590 B.c. - invaluable terminus post quem non. There are few surprises, but several handsome pieces were found, including the animal bearer T3906 that forms this volume's frontispiece. The point is nicely made that the same mould was probably used for the faces of the female head T3833 and the male head T3834, with very different hair-styles. Attribution to Cyprus is less confident in the</page><page sequence="3">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 417 case of one or two limestone figures, particularly a calf-bearer with painted details on the face, including moustache. Naukratis is a possibility. 'A rural cult place in the Soloi area' by M. Loulloupis gives the summary account of a 1969 rescue of what may have been a cave-sanctuary deposit of Late Archaic - Classical date - vases, thymiateria, multiple lamps and bull statuettes, all plain, were well represented. There is a faint echo here of the Cave of the Nymph at Kafizin, near Nicosia, though that site's rich epigraphic harvest was evidently totally missing at Soloi. As well as being the acknowledged doyen of Cypriot epigraphers, 0. Masson is the leading authority on the documentation of nineteenth century collecting and excavating in Cyprus. His paper describes his eventual success in tracing any correspondence at all emanating from the brothers Luigi and Alessandro di Cesnola. He has found a useful archive of correspondence between Luigi and H. Hitchcock, now in Dartmouth College, New Jersey, and in London, between Luigi and Samuel Birch, Keeper of the Oriental Department in the British Museum. The British Museum also has letters from Alessandro. Though no great surprises have appeared, certain notorious Cesnola-isms (e.g., the Kourion 'treasure') become slightly less incomprehensible. Of particular value are notes on the discovery of the New York Amathus sarcophagos (Myres 1365) and proof that the marble anthropomorphic sarcophagos Myres 1366 is also from Amathus. V. Tatton-Brown's 'Varia' publishes a newly acquired iron dirk (E. Macnamara Gift) which may come from Cyprus, and could be of mid-eleventh century date (though, if so, it is of remarkable technical sophistication, according to J. Lang's scientific examination). Bronze objects found at Kourion in 1895 have now been restored to form a lamp stand incorporating the statuette of a draped woman. This may date c. 480 B.c. and have come from S. Italy. This, for Cyprus, is unique, though E. Gjerstad stated M. Ohnefalsch-Richter had found something similar at Marion. Dr Tatton-Brown's efforts to trace this piece in Berlin were unsuccessful. The well- known Cesnola grave relief from Tremitusha, now in the B.M., may be Roman rather than Hellenistic. It was repaired soon after it was found; recent conservation shows that the gabled top need not belong. Romanists will be helped by L. Carradice's 'Coinage of Roman Cyprus', which traces the succession of bronze issues (silver was minted only briefly under the Flavians, during a hiatus in the production of Syrian tetradrachms) until their end by or before A.D. 230. 'Roman sculpture in Cyprus' by R. Senff seeks to explain the dearth of limestone sculpture from local workshops (he sees nothing particularly Cypriot about the bronze and marble work recovered from such sites as Salamis and Paphos). By the period of Roman rule the old sanctuaries seem to have been wholly abandoned and, with their passing, also went the need for large numbers of relatively inexpensive but still monumental sculptures. The summary by R. S. Merrillees is characteristically urbane and diplomatic, serving to remind us of some of the aspects of Iron Age Cyprus not otherwise encountered in the colloquium papers. Following what has become fairly general practice, each paper is accompanied by an edited transcript of the discussion it stimulated. The book is handsomely produced, its dust-jacket enriched with a photograph of the Geryon terracotta group in the B.M. from Perga. The illustrations - photographs and drawings - are appended to each paper, with a rather cavalier attitude to relative scales; only Yon and Caubet's are carefully laid out and scaled. The text is free of misprints. H. W. CATLING</page></plain_text>
