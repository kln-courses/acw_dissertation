<plain_text><page sequence="1">Musings on the Fall of T eotihuacan It is, perhaps, unfair to take John Carlson to task for his article, "Rise and Fall of the City of the Gods" (November/December 1993), be- cause he has done nothing especial- ly egregious by following his col- leagues in sensationalizing an an- cient culture and people. The article, like so many current publi- cations, makes positive statements out of supposition and speculation. Two illustrations and their expla- nations are exemplary. On page 67 is a photograph of an anthropomor- phic being with jaguar paws for feet and hands standing next to a back- rack filled with goods that suggest a lowland, tropical origin. The cap- tion reads, "A Cacaxtla warrior, dressed as a well-known Maya trad- er god, bears a merchant pack laden with Lowland Maya products such as quetzal feathers, cacao beans, rubber, and copal incense." On what basis is the figure identi- fied as a "Cacaxtla warrior," and how is it known that this supposed warrior is dressed up in the costume of a "well-known (?) Maya trader god"? Why is he said to be bearing the pack when, in fact, he stands next to it? On the next page (68) a photograph shows two archaeolo- gists (unidentified) cleaning what looks to be a bench or a step cov- ered with paintings of emaciated or skeletal figures in lively postures. Its caption reads, "Portraits of emaciat- ed captives are painted on the steps of Cacaxtla's Templo Rojo. Be- tween the legs of one is an image of a burning five-stepped pyramid... symbolizing one of the places con- quered by Cacaxda." For what rea- sons are these images identified as "portraits," and why, since they are not bound in any way, are they fur- ther described as "captives"? My students believe information that gets published is true. They be- lieve if the caption says "captive," even though there is no visible evi- dence to suggest captivity, that the author knows something they do not know. But the truth is that there are no factual reasons to suggest the anthropomorphic figure standing next to a back-rack is a warrior dressed as a Maya god, or that dancing skeletal figures on the floor of a temple are captives. These are guesses, assumptions, imaginative "readings" of works of art that may or may not have anything to do with the original intentions of the artists and their patrons. While there is little doubt that the ancient Mesoamericans prac- ticed human sacrifice and engaged in bloody wars, I worry that our re- cent interpretations of their world reflect too closely our own fascina- tion with violence. Ancient bloody wars and cruel sacrifices have re- ceived enormous press coverage in publications and on television with scholars pointing to imagery carved and painted in the complex and so- phisticated styles of ancient Meso- america as if it were an archive of historical documents. If the High Renaissance of Italy were as opaque to us today as an- cient Mesoamerica is, and, say, the name Michelangelo had never sur- faced in the historical record, how would scholars interpret the Last Judgment painted in the Sistine Chapel? If they used the logic that prevails today in ancient Meso- american studies, we would be told it depicted a warrior in the guise of a deity presiding over a battle for territory and sacrificial victims. How is it we dare contrive such simple readings for such great and complex works of art? Flora S. Clancy Associate Professor History of Art University of New Mexico Albuquerque, NM John Carlson responds on page 64 10 Archaeology</page><page sequence="2">Continued from page 10 John Carlson responds My article was a responsible refereed pop- ularization based on considerable pub- lished scholarship by a number of individ- uals . There are detailed arguments avail- able , in print, for the perspectives offered. A good summary was published in As- tronomies and Cultures,, edited by Clive Ruggles and Nicholas Saunders (Mi- wot, CO: University Press of Colorado, 1993; chapter eight). The Archaeolo- gy article was edited down from a length- ier text that included more detail, but no article in a popular format is designed to swamp the general reader with technical, nitty gritty arguments. ARCHAEOLOGY and other popular scientific journals sel- dom include scholarly citations in the text. There was a section of suggested "Further Reading " on page 94. One case in point. The "Cacaxtla war- rior " pictured on page 67 is most likely the portrait of a specific individual whose calendrical name glyph, displayed in front of his face in the Mesoamerican 260-day almanac, is "4 Dog." Portraiture of named individuals is the rule in the Ca- caxtla murals rather than the exception. He is the "god impersonator " of the Clas- sic Maya God L (a teoixiptla in the Nahuatl language, very much as a kachina is for the Pueblo cultures of the South- west). This character is wearing the full costume of the Maya God L in his mer- chant guise, complete with Maya "god markings " on his legs and forearms. This is the only example of such a monumental figure with god markings known outside the Maya region. All of God Us diagnos- tics are present: the Roman nose; scroll eye; jaguar skin on the lower jaw; jaguar attributes such as an ear ornament, boots, gloves, and kilt; the characteristic tied fore- lock, and a variant of his "Moan bird " headdress in the form of a "coolie hat " attached to. the top of his cacaxtli mer- chants' pacJframe. That God L is often depicted as a merchant has been discussed by such scholars as Michael Coe, Nicholas Hellmuth, Karl Taube, and oth- ers, as well as myself, and I would be happy to provide the references. As for her statement: "My students be- lieve information that gets published is true, " my philosophy of education is quite different. I explicitly instruct my students to question and evaluate critically every- thing in the professional scholarly litera- ture, not to mention in popular articles. Why single out my article? Do Professor Clancy's writings contain the truth? In any case, her statement appears to demean the critical faculties of her students, some- thing they do not deserve. Mesoamerican practices of warfare and human sacrifice were real and far more widespread than recently thought. The old view of peaceful, theocratic societies was always a bit far-fetched, don't you think? Now our present scholarship is finding proof that they were really more like our- selves, in this respect, than the New World "noble savage " Utopians suggested by the previous generation of scholars.</page></plain_text>
