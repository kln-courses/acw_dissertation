Eben Saleh King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia LEARNING FROM THE HOPI: SPATIAL ORGANIZATION AT CHACO CANYON Anne Marshall In Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, stand a dozen large, multiroom, multistory stone masonry pueblos. The Chacoan great houses, built from A.D. 920 — 1130 by the Anasazi, are strikingly distinct from other Anasazi buildings both in scale and in form. Since their discovery in 1849 by army officer James Simpson, these remarkable buildings have been excavated and studied extensively. This study examines the oral traditions and settlement patterns of historic Anasazi to analyze the physical organization of the great houses of their ancestors who lived in Chaco Canyon. Although the Anasazi left no written record, their beliefs have been handed down through an oral tradition and the cycles of ceremonial worship by their descendants that continue today at Zuni, Taos, and the Hopi mesas. Modern Pueblo people worship the sun as their father, the creator, and the earth as a living entity, their mother, who provides sustenance. Mountains, buttes and rock formations are considered sacred features of Mother Earth. Ceremonial worship</page><page sequence="2">is precisely timed by the solstices and equinoxes. Scholars such as Anna Sofaer have shown that architectural features at Chaco Canyon, such as the Sun Dagger site on top of Fajada Butte, were constructed to mark solstices. A systematic investigation of the citing of twelve Chacoan great houses has yielded three criteria: nearness to water, connection to existing great houses, and relationship to the earth. In a desert such as Chaco Canyon, nearness to water was essential for agricultural sites and desirable for all sites. Connection from one great house to another includes adjacency, connection through a gap, visual connection, and north-south alignment. The great houses Tsin Kletsin, Pueblo Alto, and Casa Rinconada are all in north-south alignment with the San Juan mountains to the north. This can be explained by examining the Hopi beliefs that the four cardinal directions are of great importance, and that the world is divided into four quadrants; placing buildings so as to reinforce the direction north was to reinforce the order of the world. In a recent article, Dennis Dostater proposes a more extensive pattern of axial alignments between great houses and sacred natural sites. Great houses were sometimes located adjacent to unusual rock formations or at a point from which sacred mountains were visible. The three mesa-top great houses, Tsin Kletsin, Pueblo Alto and Peñasco Blanco, all have spectacular views to sacred mountains. Great house Casa Chiquita was built adjacent to rock formations with anthropomorphic characteristics. These rocks are reminiscent of Snake Rock at the Hopi Village of Walpi, around which ceremonial dances are still performed. Pueblo Bonito was built beneath precariously balanced Threatening Rock which did, in fact, fall and crush part of the pueblo in 1941. The choice to build beneath an awe-inspiring, but obviously dangerous overhang must have been deliberate. Only a strong spiritual belief would be reason enough to incur such danger. Given that Chaco Canyon was a desert that barely supported life, why was it the location of so many significant, large, geometrical pueblos? An interpretation of Chaco Canyon as a spiritual pilgrimage site answers this question. It explains the striking size and form of the architecture and the archeological evidence of the incomplete habitation of the sites. The choice to build in a marginal desert is explained by the Hopi belief that "chosen people" were driven away from a land that was too easy and pleasant, lest they fall into evil ways. The Anasazi chose to build in a challenging environment so as to maintain their spirituality.</page></plain_text>
