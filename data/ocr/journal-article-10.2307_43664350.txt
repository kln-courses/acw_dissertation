This way aims to transcend the two types of ecstatic-unitive and orthodox-oriented Sufism known in the Islamic tradition respectively as the mysticism of "intoxication" (sukr) and that of "sobriety" (sahw), offers a solution to resolve the rift between these two types , and goes beyond major Sufi binary concepts such as jamāl-jalāl ("beauty"-"majesty") and wahdat al-wujüd-wahdat al-shuhūd ("unity of being"-Kunity of witnessing '). In particular , the article analyses a major cornerstone of Mir Dard's Comprehensive Way , namely the theory of "Divine Muhammadan Knowledge y" which comprehends all elements of reasony tradition and intuition &gt; similar to the synthetic attempts of the Iranian philosopher Mullā Sadrã (d . 1640) in his Transcendental Theosophy , and paves the way for his path of intra-religious synthesis . &lt;o&gt; The Muhammadan Way or the Tariqah Muhammadiyyah is a particular Sharī'ah-based trend inside Islamic mysticism (Sufism), which primarily concentrates on the Prophet Muhammad and his tradition (, Sunnah ), as well as his incorporeal presence and guidance, and the achievement of union with his ontological reality as the goal of mystical perfection. This trend has * This paper is based on Soraya Khodamoradi, "Sufi Reform in Eighteenth Century India: Case Study of Khwajah Mir Dard of Delhi (1721-1785)* (PhD diss., University of Erfurt, 2014).

He grounded his specific formulation on the principles that his father and spiritual master, Muhammad Nāsir 'Andalīb (d. 1758), illustrated in the form of stories and parables in his voluminous masterpiece Nãlah-i *Ř Andalīb .3 1 The Muhammadan Way is a broad theory that traverses beyond Sufism and constructs the doctrinal foundation of not only several Sufi currents but also anti-Sufi trends which refer to the principles of this theory from different perspectives.

Juxtaposing the book with authoritative classics of Sufism in his time, i.e., 'Awarif al-Ma fańf of Abu Hafs 'Umar al-Suhrawardl (d. 1234) and al-Futūhāt al-Makkiyyah and Fusus al- Hikam of Ibn ài-* Arabi, Mir Dard asserts that "I have read neither the ! Awarif nor the Futūhāt or Fusus' the Nālah-i ' Andalīb became my special litany" (Mir Dard, Risālah-i Dard-i Dil , in Chahār Risālah (Bhopal: Matba'-i Shāh JahānI, 1892), 188, dard no. 216).

The first type is represented in the history of Sufism by such figures as Bãyazld al-Bistāmī (d.c. 875), al-Hallāj (d. 922), Rüml (d. 1273), and- at least as far as his reception in India is concerned- Ibn al-' Arabi (d. 1240), while the second type is represented by Sufis such as Hārith al-Muhāsibl (d. 837), al-Junayd (d. 910), and al-Ghazālī (d. lili).5 Within the Indian context, the Sufi reformism which commenced in the late sixteenth century under the influence of the Islamic scholar and Naqshbandl Sufi Ahmad Sirhindl (d. 1624) manifested itself as a trend characterized by a revival of sober, orthodox-oriented Sufism vis-à-vis the unitive, ecstatic-oriented one. Mir Dard made his contribution to this process of Sufi reform with a different approach, striving to go beyond both of these types of Sufism and the twin concepts related to them, i.e., beyond both intoxication and sobriety, or in his words, Sirhindl and Ibn al-' Arab!.6 He does so through his theory of intra-religious synthesis, Tarïqah Jami'ah, which is the efflorescence of balance ( i'tidāl) between ecstatic-unitive Sufism, on the one side, and sober Sufism, on the other. Mir Dard's transcendental mysticism, which he formulated as the Tarïqah Muhammadiyyah Jami'ah, consists of a multi-dimensional mystical Muhammadan system, which deserves to be considered as representative of a highly developed stage in the formative process of the idea of the Muhammadan "Way. The very concept of the Tarïqah Muhammadiyyah in the context of Sufism was surely formed, and already associated with a variety of 4 For a typology of sukr and sahw in Sufism, see Jawid A. Mojaddedi, "Getting Drunk with Abu Yazid or Staying Sober with Junayd: The Creation of Popular Typology of Sufism," Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies 66 (2003), 1-13. Mojaddedi aids in accessing the different approaches of early Sufi scholars such as al-Qushayri, al-Makkl and al-Kalābadhl concerning these two notions. 5 Similar to other Islamic esoteric (bat ini) trends like Isma'lliyyah, Ikhwãn al-Safā and Hurufiyyah, Sufism has generally been considered as the representative of tashbth, compared to other orthodox-oriented religiosities inside Islam like that of philosophers, 'ulama' and theologians, who have often been regarded as the representatives of tanzih. Nevertheless, there has always been a tension between those Sufis who were close to Shaii'ah and those who felt more freedom in crossing the strict boundaries of Islamic orthodoxy. For an account of this tension and also the contribution of Sufis in making Sufism and Shari'ah compatible, see Frederick De Jong and Bernd Radtke, eds., Islamic Mysticism Contested: Thirteen Centuries of Controversies and Polemics (Leiden: Brill, 1999). 6 Mir Dard, 'Ilm al-Kitāb (Delhi: Matba' al-Ansāri, 1890), 612-3.</page><page sequence="4">ļjQ SORA Y A KHODAMORADI different meanings, long before Mir Dard and his father.7 It was developed from the earlier thought of such Sufis as Ahmad 'Imād al-Dln al-WāsitI (d. 1311), a Shādhilī Sufi and student of Ibn Taymiyyah (d. 1328), evolving into later, innovative mystical systems such as Tariqah Jāmi'ah in question which has its roots in the reformism of the Naqshbandiyyah and, more specifically, Mujaddidiyyah trends. Al-Wāsitī, who was called by Ibn Taymiyyah "the Junayd of his age,"' resigned his own affiliation with the Shādhilī tariqah in preference for the Tariqah Muhammadiyyah. 9 He understood the latter as a mystical path based on attaching oneself to the rühäniyyah ("incorporeal presence") of the Prophet Muhammad instead of attachment to a shaykh .10 Such attachment meant eliminating the need for the mediumship of a Sufi master along the path toward mystical perfection, and instead relying on creating a direct relationship with the Prophet in order to attain mystical perfection. Another personality who employed the concept of the Tariqah Muhammadiyyah in the sense of the school of the Muhammadan Sunnah (madhhab al-sunnak al-Muhammadiyyah) was the Shādhilī-Jazūlī Abū Muhammad al-Ghazwānī (d. 1529). He propounded a system that combined the idea of the shaykh's annihilation in the Muhammadan essence (dhãt) with his active involvement in society." This idea of annihilation in the Prophet was disseminated among Muslims, in part, through the works of 'Abd al- Karīm al-JIlI, especially his famous al-Insān al-Kāmil ("the perfect man") which was itself influenced by the idea of haqtqah Muhammadiyyah ("Muhammadan 7 For the historical development of the concept of Tariqah Muhammadiyyah, I have benefited from Wright, On the Path of the Prophet, 1-12 and 39-44: and Sedgwick.

It was on this shift that Sufi wayfaring (sulūk) based its change in emphasis and approach from preparation for union with God to union with the Prophet instead.13 Aside from the notion of absorption in the Prophet's reality, the concept of the Tariqah Muhammadiyyah incorporated other aspects and elements in itself through the course of time. The Ottoman scholar and prominent opponent of the Khalwatiyyah Sufi order, Muhammad b. 'All al-Birgawī (d. 1573), for instance, argued that the Muhammadan Way was the only legitimate tariqah and that the entirety of the Muslim community should belong to it. He dedicated a book entitled al-Tariqah al-Muhammadiyyah wa 7- Sirah al-Ahmadiyyah to explain such necessity and reject what he viewed as a prevalence of excesses plaguing the Sufism of his time.14 This doctrine was later echoed by several other Sufis including Mîr Dard who used the term Tariqah Muhammadiyyah Khātimah ("the Final Muhammadan Way") and regarded all denominations inside Islam as being merely branches of his own Comprehensive Way.15 Additionally, the concept of the Tariqah Muhammadiyyah 12 For the Prophetology of al-Jlll, see 'Abd al-Karlm al-Jllī, al-Insān al-Kāmil ft Ma'rifat al- Awakhir wa ' l-Awa'il (Cairo: n.p., 1970); and his "Qãba Qawsayn wa Multaqã 'l-Nämüsayn," reproduced by Nabhānī in Jawahir al-Bihār (Beirut: Dar al-Kutub al-'Ilmiyyah, 1998), 4: 261-264. For Ibn al-'Arabl's standpoint regarding the Prophet, see chapter 27 of his Fusüs al- Hikam&gt; ed. A. 'Aflfl (Beirut: Där al-Kutub al-4 Arabi, 1946), "The Seal of the Unique Wisdom in the Word of Muhammad," and his al-Futūhāt al-Makkiyyah, ed. Uthmān Yahyä (Cairo: al-Hay'at al- Misriyyah al-'Āmmah li 'l-Kitāb, 1972), 2: 88 and 107 and 3: 141-143. 13 Of Ibn al-4 Arabi theories, both "unity of being" and the "perfect man," the former having been spread by followers such as Sadr al-Dln al-Qunawï and the latter having been disseminated mainly by 'Abd al-Karim al-Jlll, have prevailed simultaneously in Islamic society since the thirteenth century. Despite their frequent interaction, each has had its own particular influence. The Muhammadiyyah trend- like some other trends such as Mahdawiyyah- based its theory on what was first theorized by al-Jlll as the "perfect man" according to his visions of the Prophet. The innovative additions made by al-Jlll to Ibn al-'Arabl's idea of Muhammadan Reality influenced practical Sufism, and his version of the "perfect man" was a starting point for reformists who put forth the discourse of Prophetocentrism in Sufism from the sixteenth century onwards, but most notably in the eighteenth century. This subject has been further elaborated upon in the author's doctoral dissertation. 14 Wright, On the Path of the Prophet , 39-44; Sedgwick, Saints and Sons , 33. 15 Mir Dard, ' Ilm al-Kitāb, 161. In Mir Dard's explanation, even the Shi'ite denomination receives a special positive place in the Comprehensive Way (ibid., 255-8). Mir Dard wrote, "I tried to deal with the subject of ahl-i bayt ["People of the House," who include, in the Shi'ite context, the Shi'ite Imams] to make the Sunnites also respect them and love them. . . .

This began to be based, however, on having received a vision of the Prophet. In this way, union with the essence of the Prophet in a waking vision was credited with the function of endowing upon the recipient of such a vision the authority to perform ijtihād. 'Abd al-' Aziz al-Dabbāgh (d. 1719), an important originator of Tariqah Muhammadiyyah, emphasized in the same century that a saint who attains direct contact with the Prophet's essence in a waking vision16 has the authority to interpret Sharī'ah and perform ijtihād in all schools of jurisprudence.17 His renowned book on Muhammadiyyah teachings, al-Ibriz, included his ideas on mystical-based ijtihād and became an important text for several Sufi orders such as the Shãdhiliyyah, Khalwatiyyah, Naqshbandiyyah, Uwaysiyyah and Tijaniyyah orders and has frequently been considered the third most crucial Sufi text by most contemporary Moroccan, Egyptian and Syrian Sufis, after the Hikam of Ibn 'Ata' Allah al-Sakandarl (d. 1294) and Ihyã' 'Ulūm al-Din of al-Ghazālī. Again, Mir Dard later claimed the authority to perform ijtihād and issue fatwâ, as in the case regarding samā ' in which he asserted that he did not use his authority to issue any fatwã and preferred to remain silent regarding that ritual.18 Although the concept of the Muhammadan Way took on various elements and dimensions over the course of several centuries, it was in the eighteenth century, the period of its popularization in India, that this concept was elevated to a comprehensive system. Eighteenth century India witnessed (qurb-i imāmah). . . . My aim in this action is to quell the fire of prejudice among both Shi'ites and Sunnites and invite them to the path of balance (i i'itidāl )" (ibid., 256). 16 The idea and practice of experiencing a waking vision of the Prophet in general is an important element of Tariqah Muhammadiyyah. To see the Prophet is the outcome of trying to follow him in words and deeds and to utter the tasliyah and repeat it at every moment in public and in private so that the tasliyah overwhelms the heart of man. Then, according to Muhammadan Sufis, vision of the Prophet takes hold of the heart and the wayfarer sees the Prophet's form before his/her inner eye. The wayfarer becomes able to see visions of the Prophet in their dreams, then while dozing off, and finally while he or she is awake (see Ahmad b. al-Mubārak al-Lamatī, al-Ibrīz min Kalām Sayyidi 'Abd al- 'Aziz, ed. Muhammad 'Adnān al- Shammā' (Damascus: al-Matba'ah al-'Ilmiyyah, 1984), 1: 280). 17 According to al-Dabbāgh in al-Ibrïz , certitude (yaqïn ) and illumination occur only if the mystic is bestowed with the vision of the Prophet while in waking state (ibid., 1: 400; al-Lamatī, al-Ibrìz (Damascus: al-Matba'ah al-łIlmiyyah, 1986), 2: 277). After this mystical state, he becomes omniscient and is permanently protected from error (ma'sūm) (ibid., 1: 110; 2: 301). His knowledge is far superior to that of all others, especially to that of the fuqaha' and he is the infallible resource for interpreting Sharī'ah (ibid., 2: 97). 18 Mir Dard, Risalah-i Nālah-i Dard in Chahār Risālah (Bhopal: Matba'-i Shah Jahānī, 1892), 7, nälah no. 37.</page><page sequence="7">TARÌQAH MUHAMMAD/YYAH AS TARÌQAH JĀM l' AH the disintegration of the Mughal Empire into smaller entities, the struggles of Marathas, Jats and Sikhs with Muslims, and the occasional invasions of the Afghans and the Persians.19 In response to such social-political circumstances, the religious leaders of the imperial capital of Delhi, generally affiliated with or influenced by the Naqshbandiyyah Sufi order, tried to set a synthetic and unified standard of religious belief and practice. Such efforts were in fact an urgent response to the lack of stability in the heartland of the empire, though a degree of stability had been created in some of the new regional systems of that time. In this context, Sufis such as Mir Dard and his contemporaries Mazhar Jãn-i Jānāņ (d. 1781) and Shāh Wall Allah of Delhi (d. 1762) blamed moral and religious decadence as having been the basis for the social and political degeneration of their time.20 With a new Muhammadan approach, they therefore endeavoured to give desperate Muslims a strong impetus to turn back to the "golden age" of the Prophet. Their reformist movement was replete with longing for the early Islamic utopia in which the Prophet created the best nation ( khayr ummah ), a nation which, despite its former glory and power, was almost unable to counteract the invasions waged against Muslims by local rival groups and later by European powers. The ideal of Indian Muslims in that time was the time when Muhammad led Muslims from victory to victory, hence they attempted to look back to him in the hope that their community might flourish again.21 In the time when Delhi wai struck with unceasing attacks, famines, and political instability, Mir Dard believed that the only possible way for saving the people was through his and his father's Muhammadan Path. This path encompassed almost all of the previous elements of Tarlqah Muhammadiyyah while adapting to the social climate of the time, and formed a discourse which 19 For more detail on the desperate situation of Muslims in eighteenth century India and especially Delhi, see in particular: P.

Metcalf discusses the situation of eighteenth century India in the first chapter and analyzes various responses of Indian Muslims to the political instability of their time. One of such responses, according to her, comes from the religious leaders of Delhi, who, due to lacking local bases like that of the wealthy shrines, endeavoured to reassert the old balanced relationship between themselves and the political leaders. Above all, the religious leaders wanted to guard the intellectual heritage of the faith, even without the protection of the court. This impulse was obvious in the synthetic works of Shāh Wall Allah (ibid., 24-29). 21 Annemarie Schimmel, And Muhammad is His Messenger: The Veneration of the Prophet in Islamic Piety (North Carolina: The University of North Carolina Press, 1985), 225.</page><page sequence="8">274 SORAYA KHODAMORADI exerted considerable transformation in Sufism. Nevertheless, neither Muhammad Nāsir 'Andalīb, nor his son, Mir Dard, ever acknowledged, in any of their works, the influence of previous Muhammadan Sufis on the development of their thought, the former having claimed to have received the principles of his way from a vision of the Prophet's grandson, Hasan b. 'All.22 According to Mïr Dard, his father's Tariqah Muhammadiyyah is a unique path that not only all preceding Sufi orders but also the plethora of different schools of earlier Islamic thought had played a preparatory role for the appearance of it.23 He asserts that the position of all denominations of Islam in relation to the Muhammadan Way is similar to that of the pre-Islamic Abrahamie religions whose adherents are called, the People of the Book (ahi al-kitāb) in relation to Islam, as their religions led up to the revelation of the final religion of Islam. 24 The multiplicity of the dimensions of the Muhammadan Way in Mir Dard is shown by several meaningful adjectives attributed to the term Tariqah Muhammadiyyah in his oeuvre. These include, among others, the previously mentioned two adjectives of jami'ah and khātimah , as well as khālisah ("pure"), khāssah ("particular"), wathiqah ("trustworthy"), kāmilah ("perfect") and 'aliyah ("high and transcendental"), each of which highlights a specific aspect of his version of the Muhammadan Way.25 The growth and expansion of the idea of the Tariqah Muhammadiyyah throughout the Islamic world in general and the Indian Subcontinent from the sixteenth century onwards in particular was primarily the result of the 22 Mir Dard, 'Ilm al-Kitāb, 85. Mïr Dard tells that his father had a mystical vision of Imam Hasan, the grandson of the Prophet. In this vision, 'Andalīb "remained silent for seven days and nights, turning away from the world of humanity, neglecting basic human needs such as eating and drinking and the like, and remained isolated in his cell." When 'Andalīb returned to a normal state, Mir Dard asked him about his experiences and he answered that, "all of us are children, lost in the sea of identity and drowned in one ocean. Our name is the name of Muhammad, and our sign is the sign of Muhammad, our love is the love of Muhammad, and our claim is the claim of Muhammad. ... It is exactly the path of Muhammad, and we have not added anything to it. Our conduct is the conduct of the Prophet, and our way, the Muhammadan Way" (ibid.). 23 Ibid., 116. 24 The term ahi al-kitāb is used to designate non-Muslim adherents to faiths which have a revealed scripture. According to the Qiir'änic text, "Today I have perfected your religion for you, and I have completed My blessing upon you, and I have approved Islam for your religion" (Qur'an 5: 3), Muslims believe that God finally sent Muhammad, the seal of the Prophets, to convey the divine message to the whole world, summarizing and finalizing the divine revelation. 25 Mïr Dard, 'Ilm al-Kitāb , 63-8, 83-8, and 161. Though all of these descriptions for the Tariqah Muhammadiyyah are important for Mir Dard and 'Andalīb, their way has generally been called Muhammadiyyah Khālisah by scholars of eighteenth century Indian Sufism.</page><page sequence="9">JARÌQAH MUHAMMADIYYAH AS TARÌQAH JĀMI'AH 375 confrontation and interaction between the two trends of ecstatic-unitive versus sober Sufism. Such a confrontation within Sufism was the result of, among other factors, the severe criticism leveled on Sufism from outside by Islamic orthodoxy, originating in the doctrines of such orthodox figures as Ibn Taymiyyah. 26 This polarization is connected to a group of significant interdependent binary concepts including the notions of jamãl-jalãl ("beauty"-"majesty"), tashbīb-tanzīh ("immanence"-"transcendence"), sukr- sahw ("intoxication"-"sobriety"), fana'-baqa' ("annihilation"-"subsistence"), and wahdat al-wujūd-wahdat al-shubūd ("unity of being"-"unity of witnessing"), whose first and second parts represent ecstatic-unitive Sufism and sober Sufism respectively. The first elements of these pairs have caused much conflict and controversy between Sufis and the representatives of orthodox Islam, while the second elements were more compatible with the orthodox views of the 'ulama', or religious scholars specializing in Islamic law (Shari'ah). The first elements refer to man's nearness to God, their mutual relationship based on love, and humankind's annihilation in God, all of which are closer, according to Sufis, to the esoteric meaning of the Qur'ân and haditb. Quite differently, the second concepts place emphasis on the inaccessibility of God's essence, his distance from creatures including man, and the relationship between humankind and God in the sense of servant ( 'abd) and Lord (Rabb), which are more harmonious with the literal understanding of the Islamic holy scriptures. In the encounter between these two trends and their spiritual ideals in the frame of twin concepts, Sufi reformers and scholars made an endeavour to re-think and re-formulate the theories and practices of the dominant Sufism of their time, which were viewed as having overemphasized the ecstatic- unitive aspect of Sufism, thereby putting forward their own suggestions for change in the form of the mystical Muhammadan trend. Establishing its pillar based on the idea of the "perfect man" being identical with the Prophet Muhammad the Muhammadan trend took the shape of an extreme reform to such an extent that later reformists such as Mir Dard disdained the epithet of Sufi and would have never called themselves Sufis or their path the path of Sufism (tasawwuf). Instead, he used Muhammad* for Sufi and Muhammadiyyab 26 The role of Ibn Taymiyyah in the early formation of the idea of Tarïqah Muhammadiyyab is quite important, and the interaction between the ideas of Ibn al-' Arab! and Ibn Taymiyyah constructed the background for the formation of the Muhammadan Way. Ibn Taymiyyah believed that the only authoritative mediator between God and humankind is the Qur'ân and Sunnah, as interpreted by the 'ulama' as "the heirs of the Prophet." Sufism was both criticized and influenced by Ibn Taymiyyah and his ideas and critiques caused Sufi self-criticism. Fazlur Rahman regards Ibn Taymiyyah and his student Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah (d. 1350) as the first "neo-Sufis" (Fazlur Rahman, Islam, 195).</page><page sequence="10">376 SORA YA KHODAMORADI for tasawwuf. 17 In order to explain Mīr Darďs Tarìqah Muhammadiyyah Jāmi'ah in relation to the interaction of these two poles and analyze his viewpoint in this regard, it seems helpful to briefly survey the confrontation of these conceptions in Islamic tradition. Among the above twin concepts, an important pair that originated directly from the Qur'än and hadith is that of the divine names of beauty ( jamāl) and majesty (jalāl). God's name of beauty evokes attractive, motherly, warm, embracing, intimate, and gentle divine attributes and is connected to such divine names/attributes as the Merciful (Rahmān/Rabīm ), the Compassionate (. Hannān ), the Loving (Muhibb/Wadüd) , the Forgiving (Ghafūr), and the Near ( Qarib ). Just as beauty is one of the foremost qualities in a beloved human, God the Beautiful is worthy of being approached with love and not merely with awe and sober formality.28 It is this quality of jamāl with which ecstatic-unitive Sufis have been inspired, especially in lyric poetry which employs such symbols as the "face" ( rukh ) in referring to the revelation of divine jamāl. Ecstatic-unitive Sufis have argued that one who is beautiful can only be aware of that beauty if the beauty is known and appreciated by someone else. God's beauty needs a mirror to be reflected in, and the whole of creation, particularly humankind, is that mirror through which God becomes aware of his foremost essence and beauty.29 The jamāli names and attributes also refer to God's nearness to his creatures and the point that he never leaves them on their own. The natural human response to a god who is conceived in these terms is to feel close to him and to love him. The divine name of jalāl, on the contrary, indicates God's power, superiority and distance. It includes such names/ attributes as the Withholder {Māni), the Seizer ( Qãbid ), the Omnipotent ( Qahhãr ), the Death-giver (Mum.it), and the Avenger (Muntaqim), the Highest Çâlï), the Transcendent ( Muta'ali/Munazzah ), and the Distant (Bald). God is portrayed in these attributes as a powerful deity who is completely distinct from and far above 27 Mïr Dard never calls himself Sufi or his path Sufism, and throughout his works the expressions of Muhammadī and Muhammadiyyah are used self-referentially for himself, his followers and his path. In Risālah-i Nālah-i Dard, he calls himself one of the most humble of pure Muhammadans and his father chief and prince of the Muhammadans (Mïr Dard, Risālah-i Nālah-i Dard , 2, 4).

In the Persian and Urdu literature, one of the symbols employed to refer to these names is the tress (zulf), the black veil that conceals the face (divine Reality) from others and makes it inaccessible for them. This group of names presents the proper relationship between humankind and God as one of awe and formality born out of respect, an image which is emphasized by Islamic orthodoxy outside Sufism as well. Sober Sufis inspired by jalālī names and attributes try to traverse the mystical states in which the border between God and man is seemingly removed in order to achieve other states in which the Sufi becomes conscious of his distinction from Deity. Instead of developing innovative methods for achieving spiritual states and stages similar to those sought by ecstatic-unitive Sufis, sober Sufis referring to these names attempt to remain inside the bounds of Islamic orthodoxy, invoking quotations from the Qur'an and hadith, whose outward interpretation is closer to their viewpoint. Another important set of twin concepts connected to God's essence and attributes and His relationship with man is that of divine immanence {tashbih) and transcendence (tanzïh). The concept of tashbih , which means affirming similarity, indicating the assertion that God is analogous and comparable with His creation. It is associated with the divine name of jamāl and is more harmonious with, and is emphasized by, ecstatic-unitive Sufism.30 Tashbih highlights that both God's manifestation within the cosmos along with scriptural references derived from the Qur'an itself reveal certain divine attributes such as knowledge, desire, mercy, generosity, and providence, attributes which are also found in creatures. In a more mystical version, this perspective places emphasis not only on God's similarity but also on his unity, the highest degree of similarity with creation, and maintains that God's oneness is such that his one Reality embraces all creatures. Hence, the world, as viewed from this angle, is merely illusion and is not inherently real, being nothing but the one Real manifesting himself.31 Contrary to this perspective, orthodox-oriented Sufis, who articulate their creeds in the frame of a 30 One of the major issues discussed in Islamic theology (kalani) is the question of divine attributes. The debate has mainly been upon anthropomorphic attributes of God and the different methods of interpreting them. Contrary to Mu'tazilites who believe in the metaphorical sense of the anthropomorphic Qur'anic references such as God's "face" and "hands," traditionalists such as Ash'arites affirm a literal sense for them and state that the exact nature of them could not be known. For the debate on tashbih and tanzïh in Islamic theology in general, see M. Abdel Haleem, "Early Kalām," in History of Islamic Philosophy , ed. S. H. Nasr and O. Leaman (London: Routledge, 1996), 71-88. 31 For tashbih and tanzïh in Sufi context, see Toshihiko Izutsu, A Comparative Study of the Key Philosophical Concepts in Sufism and Taoism (Tokyo: Keio Inst, of Cultural and Linguistic Studies, 1966), 39-60; and William C.

Therefore, tanzlh is an assertion of God's essential and absolute incomparability with any created thing and his being above all creaturely attributes, and that the Absolute per se is an unknowable thing which rejects all human effort to approach it and frustrates all human understanding in any form whatsoever.33 The perspective of tanzlh was accepted in Islamic history as the orthodox viewpoint concerning the relationship between God and creation and highlighted the duality between, and the incomparability of, man with the Divine. Such transcendence means that, for advocates of tanzlh, even the most perfect mystics cannot attain pure unity with God. Another pair of concepts in the frame of which two main trends of orthodox-oriented and ecstatic-unitive Sufism have articulated their different approaches is that of sukr and sabw. In Abū Nasr al-Sarrāj's (d. 988) Kitāb al- Luma', the earliest of extant Sufi manuals, these terms have been pointed out as similar to the states of "absence" (ghaybah) and "presence" ( hudūr).M The overpowering sense of the beloved in the state of sukr affects the mystic to such an extent that he no longer recognizes, and goes beyond, such dichotomies as right and wrong or pain and pleasure.35 The well-known Sufi writer 'Abd al-Karïm al-Qushayrī (d. 1072) expounds that while the sober one protects himself by his own independent actions, the drunk is protected by means other than his own deliberate efforts, i.e., by God.36 Al-Kalābādhī directed his efforts, about half a century earlier than al-Qushayrl, to demonstrate that the sobriety which follows drunkenness is a superior and loftier state than the drunkenness which involves a greater degree of proximity to God. Al-Qushayrl, however, concentrates more on drunkenness, to reassure that it is a perfectly legitimate and safe experience for Sufis. The ecstatic-unitive Sufis like the abovementioned al-Bistāmī believed in the superiority of sukr over sahw and maintained that sobriety involves the fixity 32 Qur'ân 42: 11. 33 Izutsu, A Comparative Study, 41. 34 Abū Nasr 'Abd Allah b.

Sober Sufis like al-Junayd believe that intoxication should be passed over because it involves the disturbance of one's normal state and loss of one's self- control.38 For al-Kalābādhī sobriety consists of one's ability to discriminate (tamytz) between pleasant and painful things.39 He distinguishes between two types of sobriety and emphasizes that to him, only that type of sobriety which follows the state of drunkenness is superior to sukr.40 The binary concepts of annihilation or extinction (fanā) and subsistence (baqã) are other significant notions in the confrontation between ecstatic- unitive and sober Sufism. In the formative period of Sufism, especially from the ninth century onward, a group of Sufis following the ecstatic-unitive mysticism of such figures as al-Bistāmī and al-Hallāj began describing the goal of the mystical quest as being the passing away and annihilation of the mystic's self.41 They associated the concept of fanā ' with such notions as congregation (jam) and affirmation (i ithbāt ), which confronted separation (tafriq) and negation (nafy).Ą1 From that time onward, considering annihilation the method and zenith of mystical perfection became one of the pillars of the ecstatic-unitive trend in Sufism, presented especially in Sufi poetry. For the adherents of this type of Sufism, fanā 9 is the annihilation of everything 37 'Alī b. 'Uthmān al-Hujwīrī, Kashf al-Mahjüb , ed. V. A. Zhukovski (Tehran: Amīr Kablr, 1957), 230. 38 Ibid., 231. The author's discussion of siikr and sahw is provided in a chapter ot the book on the alleged twelve "Sufi Groups" of his time, ten of which he considered acceptable. He associated drunkenness and sobriety with two groups of Tayfüriyyah (followers of al-Bistāmī) and Junaydiyyah (followers of al-Junayd) respectively, and in this way, characterized these two groups by expounding the central doctrine which he attributed to them. 39 Al-Kalabadhl, Kitab al-Ta'arruf 117. 40 In contrast to al-Kalābādhī, his predecessor al-Sarrāj concentrated more on discussing drunkenness rather than sobriety, and his aim was to argue the superiority of sukr. Similarly, al- Hujwïrî (d. 1077), the author of the first Sufi manual in Persian, advocated a reconciliation between two sides of sukr and sahw , though mentioning that his teacher was a follower of al- Tunayd who regarded mystical drunkenness as the playground of children (al-Hujwīrī, Kashf al- Mahjūb , 233). 41 Alexander Knysh, Islamic Mysticism: A Short History (Leiden: Brill, 2000), 309. 42 The notions of jam' and tafriq belong to the discourse of unity among early Suhsm. I hey refer to the idea that things have their origin in God and they must finally return, after their dispersion {tafriq) , to live again in Him (jam). The concepts of nafy and ithbāt , negation and affirmation, refer to the structure of Muslim's basic profession of faith ( shahādah ), "There is no god but God," in which the first half ("there is no god") is a negation and the second half ("but God") is an affirmation. Hence, negation refers to tanzīh and affirmation to tashbih.</page><page sequence="14">3go SORA YA KHODAMORADI dependent in nature, whether in the form of attribute, action, or essence, into the divine essence.43 In addition to fanā' fi Allah ("annihilation in God"), other forms of fanā' have also been mentioned by Sufis, like fanā' fi 'l-shaykh ("annihilation in the shaykh") and fanā' fi 'l-rasūl ("annihilation in the Prophet"), the latter of which has been significantly addressed by Muhammadan Sufis. Many non-sober Sufis like Tāj al-Dīn Ushnuvī (d. ca. 1213) pronounced that the state of fanā' "is the farthest stage along the sulūk, and the ultimate desideratum of the seekers (taliban), for beyond this station there is no wayfaring."44 Conversely, orthodox-oriented Sufis emphasize that fana' is a state of unconsciousness, from which man should return and regain his consciousness with a new divine identity in the state of baqa', as it appears in the Qur'an, "All that dwells upon the earth is perishing, yet still abides the Face of thy Lord, majestic, splendid."45 By introducing the concept of baqa', proponents of baqã' try to show that the ecstatic identification of the human self with God is merely a transient state that passes away, contrary to baqã' which is a more advanced experience permitting the simultaneous experience of God and the world. Sufi theorists since al-Junayd have described baqa' as man's continual existence in God, after acquiring divine attributes, an existence which, in turn, is portrayed as the mystic's renewed consciousness of the plurality of the created world that coexists with his perception of unity. In the state of baqã', the mystic shares his new experience with other Muslims and it is often presented as being similar, or even equivalent to, prophetic consciousness. According to orthodox-oriented Sufism, the ordinary ecstatic mystic is tempted to remain entranced by the unitive vision and rapture that characterize the experience of fanā' and thus to abandon any effort to change this world, whereas the Prophet, as a paradigmatic mystic, lived with both God and the world, seeking to reform the world by preaching divinely inspired moral truth.46 As in the case of fanā', different types and degrees have 43 Several Sufis have distinguished between three degrees or levels of acts, attributes and essence regarding both notions of fanā' and baqa'. According to Ibn al-' Arabi, in the first level, the action of the Sufi is united with the divine action {fanā' in act) and acquires its order, harmony and durability ( baqa ' of act). In the second level, unity and permanency is situated at the level of qualities and attributes, and human virtues are raised to the level of the divine attributes and acquire their perfection, dignity and durability. In the third level, the most perfect form of Sufi fanā' and baqa', the essence of the human is raised to the height of the divine essence in its unity, sublimity and universality, and man is totally absorbed by the divine.

Although Ibn al-4 Arabi, the founder of the doctrine of wahdat al-wujūd*s paid attention and spoke about both parts of all of the aforementioned twin concepts,49 the idea of wahdat al-wujud was interpreted by many later Sufis in terms of the first sides of each of these pairs, those being jamāl , tashbīh&gt; sukr and fanã' In the Indian Subcontinent, especially due to the presence of non-Islamic pantheistic traditions and the great potentiality for the development of sukrl and unitive Sufism,50 this doctrine was used as the major theoretical foundation of the prevalent ecstatic- unitive Sufi currents mainly in the sense of hamah ūst ("all is He"), so that those currents have been frequently considered to be, " wujüdi " Sufism by their opponents who used the appellation as a polemic device.51 In wujüdi Sufism, the fundamental Islamic creed "There is no god but God" is interpreted as "There is no existence except Allah," hence everything is considered to be of 47 Among different kinds and degrees of baqā' non-Muhammadan Sufis speak about the degree of baqã * bi Allah , while Sufis belonging to the Muhammadan trend highlight baqã' bi al-rasül. In general, baqã* is a key concept for the Muhammadiyyah way, and some scholars believe that the starting point for the Tariqah Muhammadiyyah was Sirhindi's conclusion that the return to reality (baqã) after having been lost in God (fanā) should be the mystics' ultimate goal (see Gerdien Jonker, "The Evolution of the Naqshbandi-Mujaddidi Sulaymançis in Germany," in Sufism in the West , ed. Jamal Malik and John Hinnells (London/New York: Routledge, 2006), 83). 48 Although Ibn al-' Arabi is correctly considered to have been the founder of the theory of umty of being, the term wahdat al-wujud is not mentioned in his own writings. The only case of employing the term by Ibn al-'Arabī is in his Awrãd al-Usbīf : "I ask of You, by the mystery with which You unite the complementary contraries, that You bring together for me all that is disunited of my being, in such a union that I may contemplate and witness the Oneness of Your Being" (Ibn al-'Arabi, The Seven Days of the Heart : Prayers for the Nights and Days of the Week , trans. Pablo Beneito and Stephen Hirtenstein (Oxford: Anqa Publishing, 2008), 57). 49 Chittick, The Sufi Path of Knowledge , 23-6. 50 In India, sukrī Sufism developed into a synthesis between Islamic mysticism and Hindu traditions such as Vedanta. Dārā Shikõh (d. 1659), the son of the Mogul emperor Shāh Jahãn, was one of those who sought to reconcile Sufism with Vedanta philosophy in his Majma' al- Bahrayn. For synthetic efforts between Sufism and Indian religions, see Aziz Ahmad, Studies in Islamic Culture in the Indian Environment (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1964), chapter IV entitled "Sufism and Hindu Mysticism." 51 In a paper presented to the 32nd Deutscher Orientalistentag (Münster, Sep. 2013) entitled "Sufi Reform: A Reaction to the Shared Tradition Based on Hama Ust,** I argued that it was principally the idea of hamah ūst and not wahdat al-wujud that was criticized by Indian Sufi reformists of the sixteenth century onwards.</page><page sequence="16">jg2 SORA YA KHODAMORADI the same essence. To believe in this ontological unity was not only theoretical, rather from a practical standpoint, it required the establishment of a mystical path designed to lead the aspirant to a consciousness of such unity. In reaction to this doctrine employed by ecstatic-unitive Sufis, the theory of wahdat al- sbuhūd was proposed by Ahmad Sirhindï, a prominent representative of sober Sufism in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century. This theory had actually been propounded before Sirhindï by 'Alā' al-Dawlah al-Simnānī (d. 1336), who criticized Ibn al-'Arabf s idea of wahdat al-wujud and postulated his own doctrine of wahdat al-shuhūd.52 Yet it was Sirhindï who advanced the theory in a systematic way, propagating and teaching it among Muslims as the basis for a mystical way. According to him, all Muslims, including Sufis, must realize that "Everything is from Him" rather than "Everything is He," and that God and his creation are entirely separate entities. He emphasized that the unitive experiences of the mystic do not necessarily reflect the real state of affairs in the universe and that a strict distinction must be recognized between God and creation.53 Encompassing and stressing the second elements of the abovementioned pairs related to divine name of jalāl, the concept of wahdat al- shuhñd forms the foundation on which orthodox-oriented Sufism has explained its creeds since the sixteenth century. With regard to the history of Sufism, the first generations of Sufis in the seventh and the first half of the eighth century experienced God principally in His jalālī names. In this period, the relationship between God and man in Sufi life was based on the orthodox imagery of religiosity, i.e., to maintain respectful distance between the forceful Lord and his humble servant. The puritan Sufis of this period were mostly experiencing fear {khawj) and awe ( haybah ) in their relationship with God, the result of which was a prevalence of pure asceticism and self-mortification. 54 Such an inclination toward asceticism and isolation took hold during the Umayyad Caliphate (661-750), partly in reaction to the Umayyad's luxurious lifestyle which was, to many Muslims, not in accordance with Muhammad's simple lifestyle. In Iraq, the center of anti-Umayyad movements of that time, along with such groups as 52 Al-Simnānf s criticism of wahdat al-wujud is elaborated in his correspondence with 'Abd al- Razzaq al-Kāshānl, one of the most famous proponents of Ibn al-'Arabī's thought.

Many of them completely renounced worldly affairs, spending their daily lives entirely engaged in prayer and ascetic practices, and even living in total solitude in deserts or mountains. These individuals and pious men and women were commonly referred to as nussāk ("devout men"), zubhād ("world renouncers"/"ascetics") and {ubbãd ("worshippers"). This trend spread from Basrah and Kūfah to all parts of the Islamic world, notably to Khurāsān in northeast Persia, which had once been a flourishing center of Buddhism. From the middle of the eighth century onward, however, new voices were heard from these ascetic circles. One observes the emergence of concepts like divine immanence to creatures, man's unity with God, and a relationship of love between man and God. The notion of love was highlighted and developed, in particular, by Rābi'ah al-ťAdawiyyah from Basrah (d. 801), who presented herself as a genuine mystic inspired by a passionate love of God and conscious of experiencing a unitive life with God.57 Her emphasis on love 55 Khawârij is a general term describing Muslims who, while initially supporting the authority of the fourth Islamic caliph 'All b. Abi Tālib, later rejected his leadership. They first emerged in the late seventh century and developed extreme doctrines that further set them apart from both mainstream Sunni and Shi'ite Muslims. The Kharijites were particularly notable for adopting a radical approach to excommunication (takfir). Mawall is a term used to address non- Arab Muslims which gained prominence during the Umayyad Caliphate, as many non- Arabs such as Persians, Turks and Kurds converted to Islam. Shu'ùbiyyah is also a cultural and political movement which began in the eighth century among the non-Arab people in the Arabian Caliphate. The movement rejected the Arabs claims to dominance in the cultural and sometimes political life of Islamic territories. For more details on these groups, see W.

Such figures as Rābi'ah and her Khurāsānī contemporary, Shaqlq al-Balkhl (d. 810), who regarded ascetic virtues as inferior to mystical experiences such as love,58 gradually affected the character of ascetic Sufism and transformed it from asceticism into a mysticism of love for and unity with God with new mystical practices related to this new outlook. The ninth century was a significant period in the history of Sufism in which the two standpoints of sobriety and ecstasy-union inside Sufism can be clearly distinguished. Both of these trends, as two different ways of achieving the ideals of mystical life, were emerging and interacting during this era, and their communication resulted in the formation of the discourses of sukr-sahw and fanä'-baqä ' On the one hand, following the already established idea and practice of asceticism and the fearing of God,59 notions of sahw and baqã' were focused by strata of Sufis like the famous Baghdadi Sufi, al-Junayd. On the other hand, the recently flourishing ideas of ecstasy and union were emphasized by other Sufis such as al-Bistāmī.60 While the early asceticism based on jalālī names of God and his tanżih had a joyless and negative attitude towards the world, the new ecstatic-unitive Sufism, which was based on divine jamālī names and God's tashbih , was born in its lap as an "ardent fervor rejoicing in hardship and delighting in ecstatic experience".61 This later led to movements such as the Malamatiyyah62 which was criticized by many sober still remains a main source on Rābi'ah.

According to them, the mystical wayfarer (sãlik) should neither consider his/her religious practices important nor pay attention to what other people think about him/her, so that he/she can avoid any kind of hypocrisy. They practiced reproaching the self and attracting the blame of others, openly expressing their own evils in front of others.

'AH Sufi s such as al-Qushayrl.63 Both orthodox-oriented and ecstatic-unitive Sufism entered into the stage of discipline and theosophy in the ninth century. This development especially took place at Baghdad and the intellectual circles connected to it, which in that time was an important center of Sufism as it had also become the central hub for literature, theology, law and philosophy. An example from the sober side is the Sufi, jurist and theologian Hārith al- Muhāsibī, whose books, especially his masterpiece al-Rťayah li Huqüq Allah, later influenced al-Ghazālī, who shared his speculation in forming Islamic mystical theosophy. Also, the abovementioned al-Junayd, who was portrayed later in Sufi tradition as the greatest exponent of sober Sufism, was himself, well-qualified to issue legal opinions on various judicial issues, and established his mystical school based on the Qur'anic principles of divine uniqueness and absolute transcendence. He was careful not to present the relationships between man and God in terms of a union of two essences (ittihād),M and his expositions on al-Bistāmī's ecstatic utterances (shatabāt) clearly show his preference for the state of sobriety over mystical intoxication.65 On the other side, ecstatic-unitive Sufis also shared their contributions through the Islamic mystical theosophy of the ninth century. An example here is al-Muhāsibī's contemporary, Dhū 'l-Nūn the Egyptian (d. 861), who is generally credited with having introduced the idea of gnosis (ma'rifah) into Sufism. Dhū 'l-Nūn is considered as one of those Sufis who introduced Neo- Platonism to Sufism, his works, particularly his poems and prayers, being marked by distinctly pantheistic tendencies.66 In his poetry, Dhū 'l-Nūn uses the passionate language of the devoted lover, as Rābi'ah of Basrah had done before him, and so helped to establish a tradition that was thereafter characteristic of ecstatic-unitive Sufi literature. 67 Another example of the 63 In a brief preface to his Risālah , al-Qushayrï emphasized the requirement to rescue Sufism from the bad reputation caused by the excessive antinomianism of the Malamatiyyah. He asserted that Sufi doctrine in no way conflicts with orthodox theology. Also al-Sulaml wrote a short treatise about the Malamatiyyah, and criticized them because they justified not only total neglect of the religious prescriptions of Islam, but also the commission of the most outrageous sins as testified to by their disregard for human opinion and judgment (see Muhammad b. al- Husayn al-Sulaml, Risālat al-Malamatiyyah (Paris: Arlea, 1991)). 64 Marijan Mole, Les mystiques musulmans (Paris: Presses Universitaires de France, 1965), 67. 65 Al-Tūsī, The Kitãb alLuma' 370-373. 66 For instance, Dhū 'l-Nūn prays, "O God, I do not listen to the voices of the animals or trees rustling in the wind, to the splashing of waters or the bird's song, to the wind's whistling or the rumble of thunder, but I sense in all of them an evidence to your Unity (wahdaniyyah)" (Arberry, Sufism , 52-4). 67 On Dhu'1-Nūn and literature about him, see 'Attar, Muslim Saints and Mystics , 87-99; and Annemarie Schimmel, Mystical Dimensions of Islam (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1975), 42-6.</page><page sequence="20">3g£ SORAYA KHODAMORADI ecstatic-unitive Sufis of that time having pantheistic ideas is al-Bistāmī, who was the first of the intoxicated Sufis with high mystical fervor who spoke of finding God within his own soul. His ecstatic utterances such as his well- known saying "Glory to me! How great is my majesty!" were again and again criticized by representatives of Islamic orthodoxy.68 He was also the first to take the Prophet's Ascension ( mi'rāj ) as a theme for expressing his own mystical experience, an attitude later followed by others.69 Though this period witnessed the apparent distinction between orthodox-oriented and ecstatic- unitive trends in Sufism, there were also certain Sufis in this era who endeavoured to reconcile these two sides, such as Ahmad b. īsā al-Kharrãz (d.c. 899). From the tenth to twelfth century both trends of sobriety and ecstasy- union continued their contributions to Sufism and influenced Muslims through their doctrines and practices. In Persia, Abū Ishãq Kāzirūnī (d. 1033), the famous Sufi of his time whose biography has been written in Firdaws al- Murshidiyyah was very devoted to following Sharl'ah while practicing Sufism and was also in conflict with the Zoroastrians of Persia.70 In his emphasis on Sharl'ah, he preceded one of the most influential representatives of sober Sufism, al-Ghazālī, who completed the task of the earlier orthodox-oriented Sufis. In his numerous works especially Ihyã' 'Ulūm ai-Din ( Revival of the Religious Sciences), he effectively attempted to reconcile and assimilate Sufism with orthodox Sunni theology and Islamic law. On the side of ecstatic-unitive Sufism, the younger brother of al-Ghazālī, Ahmad al-Ghazālī (d.c. 1126) was not as strict as his brother regarding Sharl'ah, and based his Sufism more on the cornerstone of love and developed a love-based mystical metaphysic. The mystical doctrines of Ahmad al-Ghazālī were followed especially by his prominent disciple 'Ayn al-Qudāh al-Hamadānī (d. 1131), who was imprisoned and ultimately executed due to his alleged heretical ideas, another figure who reaffirmed the continuity of the conflict between ecstatic-unitive Sufism and orthodox Islam. Also, another Khurāsānī Sufi 'Abd Allāh Ansārī 68 For bold sayings of al-Bistāmī and reaction of 'ulama' to them, see al-TusI, The Kitāb al-Luma', 380-95. " In explaining his experience of mi'rāj, al-Bistāmī says, "Once God raised me up, seated me before Him, and said to me, 'O Abū Yazïd, My creation loves to see you.' I said, 'Adorn me in Your unity, dress me in your selfhood, and raise me up to your Oneness, so that when your creation looks at me they will say, "We have seen You" and Thou will be That, and I will not be there'" (ibid., 382). 70 See Bruce B.

In the thirteenth century, the continuation of the chain of ecstatic Sufi-poets in the figure of the distinguished Sufi, Jalāl al-Dīn Rūmi and also the rise of the "greatest master" (al-shaykh al-akbar) Ibn al-ť Arabi brought about another step forward for ecstatic-unitive Sufism and increased its hegemony over the orthodox-oriented Sufi trend. In particular, the doctrine of unity of being as elaborated by Ibn al-' Arab! was employed as a strong theoretical ground for the mysticism of unity and ecstasy. Due to the warm reception of this doctrine by Sufis and many other Muslims and the immense influence of his ideas on Islamic intellectual circles, ecstatic-unitive Sufism spread more and more among Muslims and it became the dominant trend in Sufism in the subsequent centuries. This trend of Sufism popularized more than before such practices as listening to sacred music and dancing (samā)P performing miracle-like acts such as karãmah and crediting them with the same value as a miracle performed by the Prophet,74 venerating saints and considering sainthood (wilayah) as superior to prophethood (nubuwwah), and advocating religious tolerance and inclusivism, none of which were easily acceptable to Islamic orthodoxy. In the context of India, the first strong presence of Sufism in the Subcontinent occurred in the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries, and several Sufi orders were introduced to the Subcontinent from the thirteenth to fifteenth centuries, the most important among them being the Chishtiyyah, Suhrawardiyyah, Firdawsiyyah, Qâdiriyyah and Shattâriyyah. However, the only order which would spread out almost all over India during those 71 Ansārī composed his munājāts or orisons in Persian in a mixture of rhyming prose and verse, which is often considered as the prototype of later devotional literature in Persian Sufism. Interestingly, while being a strict sober Sufi, his munājāts influenced many Persian Sufi-poets belonging to the ecstatic-unitive trend. 72 Arberry, Sufism , 73. 73 Samā ' is one of the critical topics in Sufi reform, which has been discussed by Muhammadan Sufi reformists in their own way and approach. Mir Dard, contrary to his Mujaddidl contemporaries and predecessors and according to his Comprehensive Way, did not oppose samā ' or condemn its practice, and he even wrote with reverence toward music in his treatise, Hurmat-i Ghinā. 74 Karãmah is a term referring to extraordinary deeds performed by Sufi saints, whom Sufis regard as the inheritors of the Prophets. These wonders are done with the intervention of divine power and through knowledge of the unseen (ghayb ), the characteristics similar to the features of prophetic miracle (mujizah).</page><page sequence="22">jgg SORAYA KHODAMORADI centuries was the Chishtiyyah, which was first introduced to India by Mu'ïn al-Dīn Chishtī (d. 1236) /5 This order, together with the Shattãriyyah whose founder 'Abd Allah of Shattãr (d. 1406) is often compared with al-Hallāj, belonged to the ecstatic-unitive Sufism and were influential actors in popularizing this trend of Sufism in India. The Chishtiyyah played a pivotal role in opening the doors for Muslim interaction with non-Muslims and the establishment of a shared tradition based on the ideology of hamah ūst, resulted in domination of ecstasy-oriented Sufism and the elements of jamāl, tashbīh, sukr,fanā' and wahdat al-wujūd. Speaking the language of the common people, Chishtī saints gave impetus to linguistic and cultural assimilation. In particular, their non-dogmatic attitude towards Islamic rituals and ceremonies as well as their propounding of new interpretations to these rituals paved the way for such assimilation. They considered the highest degree of prayer equivalent to the removal of distress among those living in hardship, an attitude that allowed diverse types of people from varied religious backgrounds and beliefs to visit their hospices. The Chishtis not only showed tolerance towards followers of religions other than Islam, but they themselves, also began exploring and interacting with the non-Islamic teachings of native Indians. Among the most important leaders of the Chishtiyyah, Nasīr al-Dīn Chirāgh (d. 1356) followed the special breathing techniques of the Hindus, while Nizām al-Dīn Awliyã' (d. 1325) adopted yogic practices, and Farīd al- Dīn Ganjshakar (d.c. 1266) practiced austerity like a Sanyâsî. Other important figures of this Sufi order such as Hamīd al-Dīn Nāgorī (d. 1276) and Qutb al- Dīn Bahktiyãr Kāķī (d. 1235) also further contributed in fortifying a Muslim- Hindu shared tradition.76 This resulted in the Subcontinent being the scene of a powerful domination of ecstatic-unitive Sufism over an orthodox-oriented one throughout those centuries. In the sixteenth century, however, the signs of a resurgence of sober, Sharī'ah-based Sufism became evident, especially after Khawajah Bāqī bi Allah (d. 1603), in the same century, introduced to the region the Naqshbandiyyah tarlqab , an order which would eventually spread across the entire Subcontinent. In reaction to the prevalence of a Sufism of ecstasy and unity, in the late sixteenth century, the sober reformists endeavoured to purify Sufism, bringing it closer to orthodox Islam, and liberating Indian society from what they viewed as its negative ethical and social consequences. This started in the form of reemphasizing the role of Muhammad in Sufism and a return to Muhammadan orthodoxy. The first 75 See K. A. Nizami, "Tariķa," in Encyclopaedia of Islam, ed. P. J.

As the most significant representative of the sober trend of Sufism after al-Ghazalī, he targeted the theoretical base of the prevalent Sufism of his time, that being Ibn al-'Arabī's doctrine of wahdat al- wujüd. He tried to establish a different kind of Sufism, in the line of his orthodox Sufi predecessors, through proposing an alternative doctrine for Ibn al-'Arabī's unity of being, i.e., the theory of wahdat alshuhūd . His attempt formed the first stage of Sufi reform causing a deep rift within Sufism from the sixteenth century onwards which divided Sufism into the two trends of wujüdi and shuhūdī. This division depicted the confrontation of two trends of orthodox-oriented and ecstatic-unitive Sufism much more clearly than its depiction during the earlier history of Sufism, and it became more and more visible in the following centuries.77 In the eighteenth century, both of these trends inside Sufism were significantly represented in India. On one side, ecstatic-unitive Sufism continued its presence and influence through its channels, especially the Chishtiyyah Sufi order. 78 Despite the centuries-long activities of the representatives of orthodox-oriented Sufism, the doctrine of wahdat al-wujüd in the sense of hamah ūst and ecstatic practices such as samā' had retained popularity, and Sufism with a preference for jamālī divine names, tashblh , sukr and fanā * was still active and vibrant. A number of customs -connected with 77 Besides the notion of wahdah , controversy over samā' was one of the main manifestations of divergence among Muslims in eighteenth-century India. According to Jamal Malik, "The rivalry usually focused on the question of listening to music (samā). Thus samā ' became an issue of Muslim identity which split society apart, as can be traced in the compendiums of mystics and scholars alike" (Jamal Malik, Islam in South Asia: A Short History (Leiden: Brill, 2008), 105). 78 See Umar, Islam in Northern India , 2. The Chishtiyyah Sufi order has always kept its strong emphasis on ecstasy-oriented Sufism with methods like samā' which is one of the most significant practices of this type of Sufism in India. Due to engagement with Chishtī Sufis in samā' Indian Muslims did not experience a total rejection of samā' either theoretically or practically, and in reaction to the challenge of the Mujaddidiyyah, their emphasis on samā ' and its importance found new advocates (Carl W. Ernst and Bruce B. Lawrence, Sufi Martyrs of Love: The Chishti Sufism in South Asia and Beyond (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2002), 45). However, there have been voices promoting a revival of the Chishtiyyah, calling for adaptations in response to reformist approaches of the eighteenth century. Shāh Kalīm Allāh Jahānābādī (d. 1729) and his significant disciple Nizām al-Dln Awrangãbãdl (d. 1730), for example, have been considered the leaders of a Chishti "renaissance" that reconstructed the ethical principles of the early Chishtls (ibid., 28). Even Shāh Kalím Allāh incited Aurangābādl to perform murãqabah (contemplation assemblies), a popular Naqshbandl practice, and cautioned him against indulgence in sama( (see Metcalf, Islamic Revival in British India , 26-27; Saiyid Athar Abbas Rizvi, A History of Sufism in India: From Sixteenth Century to Modern Century (New Delhi: Munshiram Manoharlal, 1992), 69).</page><page sequence="24">■J9Q SORA YA KHODAMORADI the non-sober trend of Sufism such as visiting the graves (dargāhs) of mystic- saints, excessive veneration of saints, having faith in amulets and charms, and in some cases even the use of drugs were practiced in the Subcontinent, and their consequences influenced the Muslim community in that century.79 In his 'Ilm al-Kitāb, Mir Dard described a group of Shaykhs and Sufis of his time with these words: Some Sufis claim to be real ( asl ), but adopt a posture similar to the heretics and unbelievers. They wear a girdle ( zunnār )80 on their necks and bear sectarian mark on their foreheads, they shave their beards, moustaches and eye-brows and call it cleanliness {safa'). They tie rosaries on their legs and wander naked. They consider such acts to be the climax of freedom ( āzādī ) and liberation from restraints (bē qaydt). They are not reluctant to utter words of blasphemy.... Despite such foolish and useless actions, they view themselves as unfettered unitarians.... Owing to their idle and silly talk, they affect people most of whom are ignorant.81 On the other side, reforming orthodox-oriented Sufism had already been strengthened in the eighteenth century by the endeavours of Sirhindī's successors, called Mujaddidis due to Sirhindī's moniker of mujaddid-i alfi thānī ("reviver of the second (Islamic) millennium"), who continued to preach and propagate sober Sufism. Like several other eminent saints and founders of important tarîqabs, Sirhindl had deputed his distinguished disciples such as Badi' al-Dīn Sahāranpūrī and Tāhir Badakhshi to serve as missionaries not only in different provinces and towns such as Agra, Jaunpur, Patna, Bengal, Bahlolpur and Lahore but also further afield to Qandahar, Kabul and Transoxania in order to preach his message and reform the Muslims' way of life which had been influenced by ecstatic-unitive Sufism.82 The movement he established resulted in a considerable and long-lasting influence on Indian Muslims, and it gave, as Aziz Ahmad states, "to Indian Islam the rigid and conservative stamp it bears today."83 In the eighteenth century, Mazhar Jān-i 79 Umar, Islam in Northern India , 48. 80 In Islamic context, the term zunnar refers to a thread that the Christians were required to wear in order to be distinguished from Muslims. 81 Mir Dard, !

Most of Naqshbandl suborders today, such as the Mujaddidl, Khalidī, Saifl, Tāhiri, Qãsiml and Haqqãnl branches, trace their spiritual lineage back to Sirhindl.</page><page sequence="25">TARÌQAH MUŅAMMADIYYAH AS TARÌQAH JĀMI'AH 39 j Jānāņ, who was killed by a Shi'ite zealot, continued this mission from within the framework of his sub-order, the Shamsiyyah Mujaddidiyyah in Delhi. Despite significant differences between his and Sirhindl's approaches regarding religious pluralism and what the Muslim attitudes should be toward other religions such as Hinduism, Mazhar continued to represent the reformist sober Sufism of the Mujaddidiyyah based on strict adherence to Sharl'ah and the Sunnah of the Prophet. His disciple, Shāh Ghulām 'All (d. 1824) imparted religious education to his disciples in a different style, giving lessons on the Qur'an, the canonic collection of Prophetic haditk entitled Sahlh al-Bukhārī, and Sirhindī's collected letters Maktūbāt-i Imām-i Rabbani. In addition, the significant hadith scholar and Sufi of the eighteenth century, Shāh Wall Allah of Delhi, who attempted to unite the different trends inside Islam, remained an orthodox Sufi whose preference for jalālī divine names, tanzīk, sahw and baqã' over the other parts of the aforementioned binary concepts is obvious in his oeuvre. Famous Mujaddidl's such as Mazhar and Shāh Wall Allah, despite their individual particularities, shared in propounding solutions for the problematic dichotomy of wujüdí-ecstaúc and sbuhūdī-sober Sufism,84 as did Mir Dard. Nevertheless, the Mujaddidls' efforts in general resulted in propagation of Sunni fanaticism against Shi'ites,85 reproaching representatives of non-sober Sufi traditions and showing an intolerant treatment of Hindus.86 84 Ashraf Jahānglr Simnānī is seemingly the first Sufi who tried to demonstrate that the conflict between the two seemingly opposite doctrines of wahdat al-wujüd of Ibn al-'Arabl and wahdat al-shuhüd of Simnānī and its proponents in India such as Sirhindï and Gaisū Darāz was somehow merely a verbal controversy. Later on, Shāh Wall Allah also attempted to reconcile the two doctrines. In his books like Lamahāt and Sata'āt he calls the differences between the two theories, "verbal controversies," which have come about because of the ambiguity of language, and emphasizes that wahdat al-wujüd is merely a less-advanced stage in spiritual wayfaring (see Shah Waliullah, Sufism and the Islamic Tradition: The Lamahat and Sata' at of Shah Waliullah , trans. G. N. Jalbani (London: Octagon, 1980)). 85 Umar, Islam in Northern India , 16. Dabistān-i Madhāhib , an anonymous book authored in the seventeenth century which describes the life under Mughal rule in India and existing religious communities there, devotes one section to the arguments and counter-arguments between Sunnites and Shi'ites at Akbar's court (Muhsin Fani, Dabistãn-i Madhāhib (Lucknow: Munshi Newal Kishore, 1877), 312-29). Sirhindl had many bitter comments to offer concerning the Shi'ites, and he advised others like Shaykh Farīd Murtadā Khān Bukhārī not to allow Shi'ites in his company (see Sirhindl, Maktūbāt-i Imām-i Rabbani , 1: 71-2 (no. 54)). In addition to writing a tract entitled Radd-i Rawafid in which he repudiated the beliefs of the Shi'ites, in his letters he berated them with harsh language (see, for instance, ibid., 1: 28-9 (no. 15); 1: 71-2 (no. 54); 1: 102 (no. 80); and 1: 310-37 (no. 267)). 86 One of the influences of orthodox-oriented Sufism in India was rethinking the juristic approach to the status of Hindus in Islamic law. They dealt with such questions as: Whether Hindus are to be regarded as dhimml (protected non-Muslim) or kāfir (infidel), whether the Muslim law- with its uneven applications together with certain clear protections in relation to dhimmis- could be practically applied in a country with a large and stable non-Muslim</page><page sequence="26">292 SORA YA KHODAMORADI Their Sufi exclusivism articulated itself in specific socio-political situations even in much more severe anti-Hindu and anti-Shi'ite attitudes. It was in the context of this split between the two types of ecstatic-unitive and orthodox-oriented Sufism that Mïr Dard constructed his Tariqah Muhammadiyyah Jāmi'ah in the form of an intra-religious and intra-Sufism synthesis. It was a solution to resolve the rift between the two trends within Sufism through proposing a way of balance and comprehensiveness that incorporates elements from both sides of the dual concepts mentioned above, especially those of wujûd. and shuhūdF The synthetic attempts of Mir Dard and his father could, therefore, be considered the second phase, after its first phase was opened by Sirhindl, of Sufi reform in the frame of the Tariqah Muhammadiyyah which shifted the approach from rejecting ecstatic-unitive Sufism (as seen in the first phase) to its reconciliation with an orthodox- oriented one. Mir Dard and Muhammad Nãsir 'Andallb were, in fact, aware of the disadvantages of the first attempts of Muhammadan reformists such as ignoring, and even in some cases rejecting, certain pillars of Sufism like the theory and experience of unity with God and practices like samā', and strove to discover a balance between the Sufism of sobriety and that of ecstasy and union. According to Mir Dard's elaboration, in the historical period ending with Ibn al-'Arabl's time, the concept of "God's being distinct from creation" ( ghayriyyat-i haqq ) was so firmly entrenched in the hearts of people that there remained less space for the association and direct relationship between God and man. Then, Ibn al-' Arab! sought to broach the problem of separation by emphasizing the unity of all creatures and human beings with God. However, through the course of time his efforts resulted in the development of heretical ideas and practices, so much so, that even unitive Sufis succumbed to megalomania, thinking of themselves as if they were the Creator. By the time of Sirhindl the followers of wahdat al-wujūd became simply prisoners of imitation (taqlïd) and idle talk {cļāī). This demanded a fresh remedy, which was nothing other than Sirhindl's proposal of wahdat al-shuhūd. Mir Dard population, and, how one can fit Hindus into the Muslim jurist's understanding of a religious community. 87 Similar to Mïr Dard, Shāh Wall Allah tried to resolve the controversy between wahdat al- wujud and wahdat al-shuhūd in several works. His arguments in acknowledging the legitimacy of the wujudi position while confirming the shuhūdī position, shared also by Mazhar Jān-i Jānāņ, altered the previously dominant view of their Sufi order. According to him, the whole universe is pervaded by an existence that is both immanent and transcendent, yet the original existence of God is beyond both aspects of immanence and transcendence (Metcalf, Islamic Revival in British India , 40).

Hermansen (Leiden: Brill, 1996), 173-210.</page><page sequence="27">JARÌQAH MUHAMMADIYYAH AS TARIQAH J ĀMI' AH 393 continues that during the days of Muhammad Nāsir 'Andalīb the ideas of wabdat al-wujūd and wabdat al-sbubūd were widely propagated and penetrated the life and faith of the common people of the Muslim community, so that "the followers of each of the doctrines interpreted these notions respectively from their own perspectives and so fell further and further apart, dividing, in turn, the entire community. It was under these circumstances that God sent Muhammad Nāsir 'Andalīb with the mission to invite the people to the Tariqah Muhammadiyyah." 88 As 'Andalīb himself emphasized earlier, this tariqah "is particular (khāssah) due to its comprehensiveness, and, in fact, its central quality lies in its comprehensiveness." 89 For Mîr Dard, granting preference to each side of the above binary concepts is characteristic of a specific era in Islamic history on account of the special conditions and contexts. But "in his time", he asserted, "another reality has manifested itself, that of the Tariqah Muhammadiyyah Khālisah " which is, in Mīr Dard's point of view, the most perfect (akmat) manifestation of what was revealed to the Prophet as "absolute unity" beyond the dichotomy of wujudi and shuhūdi perspectives.90 One of the cornerstones on which Mīr Dard constructed and formulated his Comprehensive Way was the theory of "Divine Muhammadan Knowledge" (al-'ilm al-ilahi Í-Muhammadt), the knowledge that transcends beyond ecstatic-unitive and orthodox-oriented Sufism through going beyond not only the Sufism of both sides but also Islamic philosophy and theology. Combining these elements and their methods, Mīr Dard puts forth Divine Muhammadan Knowledge as a knowledge comprehending all elements of reason (¡ ma'qül ), tradition (manqui) and intuition (&lt; kashj ),91 which is similar to the synthetic attempts of the great philosopher of Safavid Iran, Mullā Sadrā (d. 1640) in his Transcendental Theosophy (al-Hikmah al-Muta'aliyah).92 For Mīr Dard, though orthodo x-shuhudi and ecstatic-unitive wujudi trends of 88 Mīr Dard, 'Ilm al-Kitāb, 613.

He combined Avicenna's thought with Shihāb al- Din al-Suhrawardi's illuminationist philosophy, Ibn al-'Arabi's Sufi metaphysics, the theological principles of the Ash'ari school and Shi'ism. He was a member of the philosophical school of Shirāz and Isfahan, which was transported to India in the sixteenth century through significant figures such as Mīr Fath Allāh Shīrāzī (d. 1589), and Mir Ghiyath al-Dīn Mansūr Dashtakī (d. 1542), an emigrant to the court of Akbar (see Sajjad Rizvi, "Mir Damad in India: Islamic Philosophical Traditions and the Problem of Creation," Journal of the American Oriental Society 131 (2011), 9-11).</page><page sequence="28">394 SORAYA KHODAMORADI Sufism have their own deficiencies, both are required components of the mystical experience and religious life of a Muhammadan wayfarer, and, along with elements of reason and tradition, they constitute Divine Muhammadan Knowledge. In defining the status of Divine Muhammadan Knowledge among other types of Islamic sciences up to his time, Mïr Dard analyzed different forms of Islamic thought, criticizing each of them in turn. Similar to al-Ghazālī, he criticized philosophers (bukamā) for constantly being engaged in suspicion, standing merely on their reason (' aql ), and having no faith in the spiritual affairs ( mu ' āmalāt ) of Prophets and Saints, which are beyond the perception of both the senses and reason. Yet contrary to al-Ghazālī, Mïr Dard is not as harsh with philosophers and their methodology and specific type of knowledge. He welcomes philosophy (hikmab)- in the sense of the knowledge of the reality of things as they are and as much as human potential possesses the capacity to comprehend- and regards it as a component of Muhammadan perfections ( kamãlãt-i Muhammadiyyah ) and an element of Divine Muhammadan Knowledge, in the event that it is accompanied by the light of faith and the Prophetic Sunnah. He calls the owners of hikmah the gleaners of the harvest of Muhammadan knowledge.93 In juxtaposing al-'ilm al-ilāhī 7- Muhammadï with the knowledge of apologetic theologians, Mïr Dard asserts that the former differs from the latter due to the existence of the possibility of error in the latter. Believing in the saying that the " mujtahid [one who performs ijtihãd] makes mistakes and hits,"94 he states that the theologians define their knowledge as the knowledge of proving religious beliefs through arguments, be those beliefs right or wrong, in order to remove doubt from the minds of their listeners. However, what this group does is to invent unknown problems (masā'il-i majhūlah) thereby creating many unnecessary arguments. Mir Dard also criticizes Islamic scholars, or 'ulama', whom he describes as those who only consider the superficial and exterior things and never apply their intellect, and those whose light of the exterior eye (chashm-i zāhir) has darkened their rationality.95 Accordingly, he maintains that the 'ulama' are enslaved in words ( alfaz ), while philosophers and theologians are enslaved in meanings (ma'āriī). Yet both words and meanings are types of relative 93 Mïr Dard, Ilm al-Kitab , 6. 94 According to Sunni schools of law, Allah rewards a mujtahid twice, in case his jurisprudential opinion is right, and rewards him once, if his jurisprudential opinion is wrong.

Mîr Dard asserted that this knowledge is distinguished from the alleged knowledge of Sufis prevailing in his time as tasawwuf which he regarded as mere infidelity ( ilhād) and an absurd phenomena to which nonsense idle talk ( turrahāt-i muhmalab) had been added. Criticizing wahdat al-wujüd in its pantheistic version of hamah ūst, he maintained that it is an expression in a drunken state by those who are in the state of being overwhelmed ( maghlūb-hālān ) at the beginning of their mystical path. This expression is uttered due to a deficiency of knowledge, and results in damaging many lay people.97 Mir Dard, nevertheless, views faithful people among the Sufis positively, calling them mutasawwifin and the people of certitude (iqãn) and divides these into two groups. The first group of these mutasawwifin includes those who experience mystical states and raptures (mawâjïd), perform Sufi practices and meditation, and connect themselves with Sufi orders, but have nothing to do with the knowledge and "actualization of truth in the self" (tahqlq). Mir Dard does not reject this group and considers them to be those who can be included inside the boundaries of Muhammadiyyah. However, since they have no true knowledge, they do not possess any rank in the Divine Muhammadan Knowledge. In contrast to this sort of wujudi Sufi who possesses insufficient knowledge, Mïr Dard points to the followers of wahdat al-shubūd as those who enjoy a kind of knowledge to which lay people and majority of wayfarers have no access. He defines wahdat al-sbuhūd as the state of abundance of yearning (kathrat-i shawq ) and being overwhelmed by rapture (jadhbah) without understanding or attaining the knowledge that is beneficial for the majority of wayfarers. The knowledge proffered by shubūdi Sufis is a kind of exalted knowledge which is only accessible to special elite ( khawass ). Thus, in his thought, wahdat al-wujud has the capacity to benefit lay people and wahdat al-shubūd is more suitable for the spiritually elite but the proposal of Divine Muhammadan Knowledge is useful for all people, be they elite or lay. In another place, while categorizing the different types of divine knowledge ( 'ilm-i ladunrit), he considers both wahdat al-wujud and wahdat al-shuhūd to be parts of the knowledge of sainthood ( wilayah ), which is achieved through the books and treatises of Sufis without aspiration or intuition and merely through imitation. Mir Dard defines the % Mir Dard, 'Ilm al-Kitab, 8. 97 Ibid., 6-7.</page><page sequence="30">396 SORA YA KHODAMORADI knowledge of wilãyah in the form of wahdat al-shuhūd as a knowledge which maintains an opinion as to the separation between the degrees of Divinity (uluhiyyah) and servanthood Çubûdiyyah), while defining it in the form of wahdat al-wujiid as a knowledge that maintains an opinion to the unity of Divinity and servanthood that sometimes results in an antinomian abandonment of the rules of Shari'ah eventually developing into atheism ķandaqah wa ilhād ).98 This knowledge of sainthood, which comprises both wujüdi- except what leads to atheism- and shuhūdī knowledge, is itself a part of Divine Muhammadan Knowledge." The second group among mutasawwifin are those who in fact own truth and subtlety (ahl-i tadqtq ), are nearer tô the core of truth than philosophers and theologians, and whose achievements are higher than theirs. The way of these people is, in Mir Dard's viewpoint, the way of illuminationists (ishrāqiyyūn)m and most of their affairs are in accordance with that school. Among this group are some representatives of wujüdi and ecstatic-unitive Sufism while others are representatives of the shuhūdī and orthodox-oriented trend. Even the knowledge of this group, Mïr Dard argues, is not the real one because it is also an additional knowledge ( ; ilm-i idãfi ) in which Sufis prescribe their own expressions and put everything into the mold of their special way of thinking and interpretation based on specific rules.101 Asserting that the truth has been lost due to the extensive array of different forms of expression and languages of a variety of groups including Sufis, he described Divine Muhammadan Knowledge as the knowledge whose language is derived from the Qur'an and hadith and which expresses things and subjects as they really are. Such Muhammadan knowledge is a substitute for all other forms of Sufi 98 Ibid., 82. In the treatise Sham'-i Mahfil, Mir Dard stated that the meaning which is erroneously given to the word tawhtd by some people leads to heresy and fruitless controversy (see Mir Dard, Risālah-i Sham'-i Mahfil, 283, nūr no. 206). " Nāsir 'Andalīb invited Muslims to assemble under the umbrella of Tawhid-i Muhammadi and declared that the doctrines of wahdat al-wujiid and wahdat al-shuhūd are not two opposite doctrines (see Mir Dard, 'Ilm al-Kitāb, 613; and 'Andalīb, Nālah-i 'Andatib, 898). 100 Here, Mir Dard was likely referring to the school of mystical philosophy in Islam which was founded in the twelfth century by Shihāb al-DIn al-Suhrawardi. The basic premise of al- Suhrawardi's teachings was that knowledge is available to man not through logical reasoning alone but also, and above all, through illumination resulting from the purification of one's inner being. The doctrine of ishraq is not based on the refutation of logic, but advocates transcending its categories through an illuminationist knowledge based on immediacy and presence. Suhrawardi refers to the latter as the "knowledge by presence" ( al-'ilm al-hudim) in contrast to conceptual knowledge (al-'ilm al-husūlt) (see M. Ha'iri Yazdi, The Principles of Epistemology irt Islamic Philosophy: Knowledge by Presence (Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, 1992); and W. M. Thackston, trans., The Mystical and Visionary Treatises of Suhrawardi (London, Octagon: 1982)). 101 Mir Dard, 'Ilm al-Kitāb , 6.</page><page sequence="31">TARÌQAH MUHAMMADIYYAH AS TARÌQAH J ĀMI 'AH yyj knowledge and converses only by means of employing the words assigned by the Prophet (alfāz-i maužū'ah-i mustafavī). Nevertheless, if the Muhammadans use different languages such as that of conventional Sufis, their intention remains, both exteriorly and interiorly, to follow the Prophet and merely to reveal the secrets of the Prophetic tradition, which has been ignored by veiled people who pay attention only to external things. Thus, in expressing al-'ilm al-ilãbi 'l-Mubammadi, the Muhammadan wayfarer may employ the methods of philosophers as well as the language and expressions of Sufis, which are inferior to the language and expressions of the Prophet. Mir Dard considers, therefore, the Prophetic language to be the basic language of the Tartqah Jāmi'ab, which is the only language to declare the real intention of the Qur'ân and hadīth through mystical intuition, and throughout this process the Prophet is always the witness and guide to Muhammadan wayfarers.102 The true Muhammadans are, in Mir Dard' s viewpoint, the perfect saints of intuition in whom the truth has become actualized {'uraß'-i muhaqqiqïn ) and their sayings can be proved by both reason and the Prophetic tradition. Thus, their philosophy is divine, their knowledge is infinite, and both tradition and reason has surrendered to their knowledge. 103 Divine Muhammadan Knowledge is the end of mystical wayfaring that is attainable by those who are at the same time the owners of perfect intellect ('uqul-i kāmilah ) and high souls ( nufūs-i 'ãliyah), the most faithful believers and the most perfect mystics {awliya'-i tāmm al-'irfān). Therefore, in the knowledge of these people there is no contradiction or inconsistency between mysticism, philosophy and tradition. Nevertheless, being aware of the deficiencies of the variety of Islamic sciences, the Muhammadans, who externally and internally follow no one save for the Prophet, imitate neither philosophers nor theologians, neither the 'ulama' nor Sufis in acquiring their knowledge, and they acquire their all-inclusive knowledge directly from Muhammad. Mir Dard calls them Muhammadiyyah Khālisah since their Muhammadan Way is pure from any kind of deficiency: "their truth is free from imitation, their knowledge includes no suspicions ( maznūn ) contrary to that of the philosophers, their objects of intuition include no illusion ( mawhûm ) as 102 Ibid., 3 and 6. For Mir Dard's usage of the language of Muhammadiyyah Khālisah, see ibid., 56, 107-9 and 333. Mïr Dard believes that most of the Sufis who cherished faith in the doctrine of wahdat aíwujüd relied on both their own intuitional and intellectual faculties, and followed the Prophet in a weak manner. They selected and interpreted verses from the Qur'ân and hadīth according to their own inclinations and leanings, while they were not interested in the Shari'ah, and adherence to it was not essentially a part of their faith. Consequently, Mïr Dard continued, they considered as lawful whatever they felt and thought to be reasonable (ibid., 609). 105 Ibid., 8.</page><page sequence="32">393 SORA YA KHODAMORADI opposed to that of the Sufis, and the reality they obtain is pure of any falseness."104 In this manner, Mir Dard formulated Muhammad Nāsir 'Andalīb's Tarìqah Muhammadiyyah in the frame of Tarîqah Jāmi'ah in an attempt to settle the tension within Sufism between jamālī and jalālī approaches, in order to encompass both ecstatic-unitive and orthodox-oriented Sufism in a unique transcendental path. His synthetic intra-Sufism endeavour aimed to reconcile the adherents of both sides- be they elite or laypersons- after a long debate and deep rift between them, especially after the beginning of the MujaddidI reformist movement in the late sixteenth century. His methodology sought to retain the advantages of both sides while rejecting their disadvantages and deficiencies. On the one hand, as a Muhammadan reformist, he criticized those aspects of ecstatic-unitive Sufism which, according to him, would lead to harmful consequences in Muslim society, such as overemphasis on the authority of shaykhs and violating Sharl'ah principles. Simultaneously, he criticized orthodox-oriented Sufism for having defects such as antagonism against other Islamic denominations and other religions as well as disregarding or rejecting certain important and beneficial aspects of the Sufi tradition. On the other hand, Mir Dard accepted elements from both wujüdi and shuhiidt mystical trends, considering them two branches of his Comprehensive Way, and regarding their knowledge as part of his Divine Muhammadan Knowledge. Additionally, in his intra-Islamic synthetic endeavour, he attempted to embrace, in an all-inclusive fashion, the advantages of all Islamic sciences while denouncing their imperfections. He tried to introduce a way of comprehensiveness, balance and transcendence, which goes beyond and surpasses all dichotomies and binaries which bring about diversity, separation and imperfection. These features as summarized in the concept of Tarîqah Jāmi'ah can be considered the major characteristics of his Muhammadan Way, and hence, should be taken into account in understanding his mystical system. This absolute comprehensiveness (jam 'iyyat-i tāmmah) is the manifestation of the divine and the mirror of Muhammadan comprehensiveness. The owner of 104 Ibid., 6-7. Mír Dard juxtaposed Muhammadiyyah Khālisah with Muhammadiyyah Mumtazijah ("impure Muhammadan"), which includes not only philosophers, Sufis and theologians but also the followers of all alleged seventy-two denominations of Islam, according to the famous hadith indicating the division of the Islamic Ummah into seventy-three sects (among several variants of this Prophetic saying, see, for instance, Abu Däwüd Sulaymãn b. al-Ash'ath al-Sajistânï, Sunan, Kitāb al-Sunnah, Bāb Sharh al-Sunnah). Mïr Dard believed that various confessions in Islam have obtained Muhammadiyyah rank and, therefore, are to be considered faithful. However, they have mixed the copper of egoism (artãniyyah) with the pure gold of Muhammadiyyah and changed their direction from the pure Muhammadan Way.</page><page sequence="33">TARÌQAH MUHAMMADIYYAH AS TARÌQAH JĀMI'AH 399 jam'iyyat-i tāmmah encompasses all dual stages and states of jamāl-jalāl , sukr- sahwy fanä'-baqä ' tashbīh-tanzīh, haqîqah-sharï 'ah [truth-Sharī'ah], farą- jam' [separation-congregation], 1 ilm - ' amai [knowledge-practice], kashf-burhan [intuition-reason], faql-i ma'ash-'aql-i ma'ād [worldly reason-otherworldly reason], uns-wahshah [intimacy-fear], suhbah- 'uzlah [companionship-seclusion].... The interior of such a person is completely full of the light of the presence of perfect union (hadrat-i jam' al- jam), while his exterior is gallantly adorned with the state of separation following union (farq-i ba'd al- jam)}05 Similar to his famous Naqshbandî contemporary Shāh Wall Allah, Mir Dard contributed to the process of Sufi reform in the eighteenth century, and several of his own statements as well as accounts about him in tadbkirah literature imply that he gained some popularity in his time. However, Mir Dard' s proposed Muhammadan Way had seemingly been the subject of doubt and rejection among different strata of the Muslim community in his time, and he himself attested to having had an unsteady reputation among the Naqshbandls. Several passages in his works refer to this situation, for example when he compares his age to that of the Prophet Noah, when, according to the Qur'an, Noah beseeched his people night and day but his supplications were left unanswered.106 Mir Dard laments in 'Ilm al-Kitāb, It has hardly been 1100 years since the Prophet's migration to Medina, and already there is little acquaintance with the pure Muhammadi way in the hearts of the community. Upon hearing the name, people are doubtful and ask 'What kind of path is this?' as if pure Muhammadis have created a new path out of thin air.107 In his laying out the categories of doubters and deniers of his message, he includes the representatives of the ubiquitous "mullahs of the husk" (mullā-i qishr ), Mujaddidis, and even some of his own disciples. Objections against him appear to be centered on, aside from his conception of the master, the idea of his Tariqah Muhammadiyyah superseding and abrogating all other paths. Numerous statements in both the introduction and throughout his masterpiece show that he may have fielded accusations of cultish behaviour and of elevating the spiritual guide ('Andallb and himself) to a quasi-divine status.108 These objections and accusations can partly explain why Mir Dard's 105 Mir Dard, 'Ilm al- Kit ab, 164. 106 Qur'än 71:5. 107 Mir Dard, ' Ilm al-Kitab , 89.

Notwithstanding considering his way as an abrogative tarlqah and criticizing all other Sufi and non-Sufi schools as deficient, Mir Dard emphasizes that he never excommunicates ( takfìr ) those turning their face to the ka'bah for prayer, even should they be, in most of their affairs, vain innovators ( ahi al-bid'ah). To him all manners of Islamic denominations were accepted, yet they were impure and mixed trends that suffered from deficiencies originating in their deviation from the true way of the Prophet. This true way was for him nothing other than his Muhammadan Way, which he regarded as the restoration of Islam and Muhammad more than a millennium after the Prophet's death. Yet, he asserted that since the death of the Prophet there had always been true saints and denominations deserving of being called pure Muhammadan. 109 Such endeavouring, by Mir Dard, to incorporate into his way some saints and tañqahs that came before both him and his father, must have been at least partly due to the criticism against rejecting imitation found in his way. Indian Muslims must have considered advocates of 'Andallb's way as being among those that refused to imitate old Sufi masters including their own forefathers like Bahā' al-Dīn Naqshband and Sirhindi. Mir Dard's own assertions show that while he regarded following the Sufi forefathers as being analogous to following the Prophet Ibrahim and his nation for Muslims, even his Naqshband! and MujaddidI associates were highly doubtful of his Muhammadan Way and assumed that he saw their masters as the subject of hidden shirk.110 Besides Naqshbandiyyah, Mir Dard's abrogative tarlqah did not exclude Shi'ism, to the extent that the Shi'ite principle of the Imamate became one of the pillars of his ideology. Such openness to Shi'ism must also be another reason for the cold reception of Mir Dard among not only Sunni Naqshbandls and Mujaddidis but also other groups within the Sunni community, which constituted the majority of Indian Muslims. Mir Dard's attempt at the absorption of Shi'ites and their ideas coincided with the ignition of sectarian strife between Shi'ites and Sunnis in India. He considered his tarlqah neither Sunni nor Shi'ite but a comprehensive way encompassing both, as it encompasses all other types of Muslim groups. He invited Shi'ites to join his way, while they were rejected by Mujaddidis, and he reanalyzed the relationship between Imams and the Prophet's Companions in order to join the two major Islamic denominations together. Mir Dard coxisidered both Imams and the Prophet's Companions as branches 109 Mir Dard, 'Ilm al-Kitāb, 88, 75 and 259. 110 Ibid., 88-89 andllO.</page><page sequence="35">TARIQAH MUHAMMADIYYAH &gt;4S JARÌQAH JĀMI'AH ąq ļ of the same tree of the Prophet, no matter whether transplanted (Companions) or the real offspring (Imams), and appreciated resorting to both as resorting to the way of the Prophet. He asked Muslims to be concerned only with the good fruits and results as well as pleasant shadows and beauty that both types of branches supplied for Muslims rather than concentrating on their differences.111 Besides the idea of abrogation in Mir Dard's Muhammadan Way and its openness towards Shi'ism, another significant factor in the lack of extensive popularity for his way was the presence of prominent Naqshbandî figures in North India in his time and his reluctance toward the institutional expansion of his tariqah. Two renowned figures, viz. the multifaceted Shāh Wall Allah and the popular Naqshbandl saint Mazhar Jān-i Jānāņ were living in the eighteenth century in the same territory where Mir Dard was teaching his ideology,112 and it cast a shadow on Mir Dard's influence not only in his own time but also in the subsequent centuries. In the absence of due historical information it is difficult to determine whether Mir Dard sent any delegates out to proselytize, and thereby propagate his thought, similar to what Mazhar successfully did. The writings of both Mir Dard and 'Andallb show that they were more theoreticians of Sufism rather than masters focusing on practical mysticism in the frame of a particular Sufi order. There is no evidence whether 'Andallb had established a khãnqãh and he does not seem to have done much in the way of forming a silsilah, although Mir Dard mentions his initiation to the Tariqah Muhammadiyyah by his father, and both father and son seemingly initiated both men and women as disciples. It appears that Mir Dard's way remained confined to the very limited circles of his disciples, most of whom being his family members and relatives. After Mir Dard's death, his younger brother Khawãjah Muhammad Mir Athar, who must have been born after 1740, continued to propagate the principles of the Muhammadan Way through his literary works. Yet after a chain of three successors after Mir Athar, the Tariqah Muhammadiyyah found almost no role to play as a quasi- silsilah and Mir Dard's Comprehensive Way, which advocated an experience 111 Ibid., 83, 84 and 255-57. In the introduction to his masterwork, 'Andallb mentions the reasons which led him to create the book, including the high level of curiosity among the younger generation over the truth concerning the different sects of Shi'ite and Sunnite Islam ('Andalib, Nālah-i 'Andatib, 1: 3). 112 For more information about Shāh Wall Allah and Jān-i Jānāņ and their role in the religious dynamic of eighteenth century India, see the introduction of Marcia K.
