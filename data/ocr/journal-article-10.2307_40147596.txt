<plain_text><page sequence="1">Manuel Puig: Beyond Identity By ROBERTO ECHAVARREN When Manuel Puigs early nov- els were pub- lished in the late sixties, they shook the literary consciousness of the time. He was the first novelist writing in Spanish who consistently utilized popular culture and the products of the show-business indus- try in order to articulate his fictions. This particular slant of the newer novel was the most serious blow to Jorge Luis Borges's notion of literary decorum. Bor- ges's fiction consists of a web of allusions to other books, to a universal ever-living library, a solitary adventure in reading and researching and rewriting. Even when Borges wrote on film in the thirties, he never integrated it into his literature. Neither did he incorporate other aspects of contemporary popular culture. Occasionally he resorted to fossilized and nostalgic dregs of gaucho and compadrito codes of honor and behavior inherited from nineteenth-centu- ry rural and semiurban areas of Argentina. Puig's books function as a counterpoint to Borges's patrician attitude. They betray a lower-middle-class ravenous appetite for commercially packaged prod- ucts such as the "talkies," the films made in Holly- wood throughout the thirties and forties, which were designed for wide distribution. Those films' treat- ment of subject matter was conditioned by commer- cial criteria and limited by censorship laws, yet, due to the talent at work in their production (directors, designers, actors, technicians), some of them never- theless became vehicles of exalting experiences. Puig's strength is based on his loyalty to his instincts, the authenticity of his response to those early forma- tive stimuli; and his fiction's appeal depends on his ability to appropriate the seeds of change in those films in order to counteract, precisely, the waning but still powerful, still oppressive sensibilities and codes of behavior that Borges had nostalgically, if perversely, evoked. The enemy, which must be pa- tiently dismantled through Puig's novels, is, grosso modo, a code of bitter courage and old machismo. In Puig's fiction the male figure is both revered and demystified. Men cannot be dismissed or eliminated. They menace the autarchy of females, a feminine sense of taste and manners. In his first novel, Be- trayed by Rita Hayworth, and even more so in his second one, Heartbreak Tango, women are still con- spiratorial and collide with one another. In his third novel, The Buenos Aires Affair, however, the male character is clearly exploitative, authoritarian, un- predictable, and sadistic. He is the unequivocal source of women's suffering. The female characters become the victims of an unbalanced and violent male person who seeks to hide his own homosexual tendencies and eventual impotence. In Kiss of the Spider Woman, Puig's fourth novel, the straight male character Valentin incarnates a new, redeemed ver- sion of the heroic ideal: the guerrilla fighter. He finds himself, furthermore, in the same prison cell with his counterpart, the effeminate homosexual Molina. They are both trapped, condemned, pinned down to a sheer margin by the powers that be. The cell is an allegory, a reduced model, so to speak, of a general political condition, but it is also, within the verisimi- lar description of the novel, a piece of everyday reality. In it the prisoners are bound to meet on the same level. The novel proposes a dialectical exchange between an older notion of political revolution - the guerrilla fighter's attempt to take over the central agencies of government - and a new revolutionary strategy that came to fruition in the sixties: a change of mores, a concern for minorities' rights, women's and gay liberation, a striving to share power rather than to appropriate it. Kiss of the Spider Woman is Puig's most radical stance. Even so, the homosexual character Molina is an old-fashioned pervert who believes in an exclusive effeminate and submissive role for the gay person. It must be stressed, though, that the novel manages to rise above and beyond the frame of mind of Molina and his generation. Kiss, albeit obliquely, through footnotes, and almost in opposition to the novel's homosexual character, introduces and develops the ideals and new strategies of the sixties. This novel remains nevertheless at the threshold of two eras. It does not take into account the hippie styles which, counter to the traditional commercial designers' fash- ion trends, drastically altered the way a man was supposed to look. It does not acknowledge the rele- vance of music - rock in particular - as a vehicle that helped develop new attitudes and ways of life. It does not deal with the - by then - budding psychedelic drug culture. Still, it is, within a Latin American context, a primer for a new period. After a brief and rather pathetic attempt at writing avant-garde poetry, Borges gave up and became in- stead a neoclassical poet. Puig also ignored the avant- garde. His last novel, Tropical Night Falling, con- tains a single reference to serious poetry. The piece quoted is a pre-avant-garde poem dating from the turn of the century, "La marcha triunfal," by the Nicaraguan Ruben Dario at his most bombastic and, yes, most popular. Puig's lower-middle-class charac- ters have never read a poem written after World War I. This fact brings us to Puig and the "scene of writing." When his filmscripts modeled after Holly- wood patterns proved unsalable, he was advised by</page><page sequence="2">582 WORLD LITERATURE TODAY someone to write from his own experience. He fol- lowed that advice. The result was not a filmscript but his magnificent first novel, Betrayed by Rita Hay- worth. In that work he re-created the idiolects of a few people living in a small Argentine town. Perhaps due to his early training as a scriptwriter, all his novels present abundant examples of effective dia- logue. Two of them, Kiss of the Spider Woman and Eternal Curse on the Reader of These Pages, are built almost exclusively through dialogue. Puig has always shied away from the stance of the omniscient author. He tends to let the characters in his novels express themselves with their own words. His fiction is veri- similar, nonintrusive, transparent. He is a sober nov- elist. The literary factor becomes little more than the collating of a protocol, the very sequence and articu- lation, the editing, in fact, of various types of "non- literary" discourse (a letter, a telephone conversa- tion, a page in a diary, et cetera). Puig is a shrewd, resourceful, proficient writer. He is also, as Ricardo Piglia observed, the first profes- sional novelist of Argentina. He is furthest away from such novelists of intoxication as the Uruguayan Juan Carlos Onetti. In Onetti's case fiction is the oppor- tunity for visionary practice, poetic incantation, dreamed-of action, not directly connected with "reality" but rather made real by a breathing, invent- ing body and/or mind. His title Let the Wind Speak, a quotation from Ezra Pound, indicates a tone, a plu- ri vocal quality, rather than a referent. Plotting, for Onetti, is a primary field of experience, an alter- natively grotesque and erotic fantasy explored through words, although its composites appropriate fragments of codes, attitudes, and strategies observed in social intercourse. Puig's fiction, on the other hand, stands apart from a certain line of Latin American novelists such as the abovementioned Onetti, Guimaraes Rosa, Jose Lezama Lima, Juan Rulfo, or Severo Sarduy. For Puig, a line of conflict, a "betrayal" for example, is rehearsed again and again from the various layers of a changing pattern - film after film. Across and beyond the stages of life experience and realizations, films are variants, the opposite, the negative, of encounters that take place in one's life. They count as entertain- ment and inspiration. Movies also function as ver- sions of one's own conflicts. They hover over the characters' conflicts and translate them. Thus there develops a dual mode of understanding people and things: Puig's characters confront not only one another. A son, for example, confronts not only his motherly counterpart but also a mother and a film star, a mother not only her ordinary self but also a star, or a star who can be the opposite of the mother under this or that aspect. A distancing effect allows for a wider measure of interpretation and of becom- ing. It makes it easier to deal with a real-life situa- tion - or to come out of it. Films open up multiple versions of drama, a breathing space. They open up a space for estranging the emotions. The screen swells and makes life big- ger. It "purifies" or, rather, diversifies the emotions. Films are a space where Puig's characters endlessly disappear, or, to paraphrase Michel Foucault (in Vordre du discours), a caesura which fragments the moment and disperses the subject into a plurality of possible positions and functions. The screen is a silver bridge between the character's actual circum- stances and a more spontaneous, autonomous, freer body of experience. This brings the author and reader back to their own bodies, beside and beyond the grip of morals and patterns of behavior that would otherwise prevail. Just changing the focus of the narration from one character's point of view to another's does not do the trick. Characters' seeing and thinking about films permeate Puig's fiction with a new set, with a cluster of stories which crisscross rather than parallel the stuff of the characters' circumstances. His characters exist on two levels. This overlapping, this allegorical noncoinciding with themselves, makes them alive, keeps them from remaining just one-dimensional fig- ures out of a single story. They walk out of the book, become something other than their own selves. Film situations are actual possibilities. It is possible for the characters in Puig's novels to appropriate partially other modes of existence. They do not become char- acters in a film; they appropriate fragments of a code of representation in order to dissolve into something else: the air of a time and place, the aura of a period, a historical body that has developed out of the best of two worlds. The author and the reader are the care- takers, the places where this happens. Puig's achievement is to have become his own contemporary. He has done so by unexpectedly turn- ing the tables on what was considered until then good literature. Rather than competing with Borges's es- thetics or those of anyone else, he invented his own formula, a formula which effected, through the layered and alternate introduction of surrogate film stories into the main plot situation, a critical distance, a comparative, broader view of his culture and the prevailing mores, and a liberating epiphany for his own characters and the reader. Puig is the virtuoso of imitating nonliterary forms. He re-creates the colloquial and idiosyncratic expres- sions of specific social contexts, interested in the idiolect of his characters as a means of articulating conflicts related mainly to sex and age. In his first two novels {Betrayed by Rita Hayworth and Heartbreak Tango) those conflicts belong in the past, although this past still shapes the habits and traits of the present, whereas the third (The Buenos Aires Affair) questions currently prevailing attitudes and patterns of behavior. Psychoanalysis here becomes the instru- ment for analyzing a discourse on sexuality and love. In this parody of a detective novel the solution to the mystery (murder, suicide, or accident) does not de- pend on the police but on the reader's interpretation of certain psychoanalytic "clues" interspersed</page><page sequence="3">ECHAVARREN 583 throughout the story. The fourth novel, Kiss of the Spider Woman, is another turn of the screw. The setting is Argentina in 1974, and the story touches the wound of the conflicts of the moment. A revolu- tionary incarcerated for subversive activities and a homosexual condemned for corrupting minors share a cell in a Buenos Aires prison. This meeting of two very different proscripts confers to the novel a singu- lar virulence. The narrative structure is deceptively simple. The unity of place (the cell) and the sustained dialogue make it resemble a play (which, as is well known, it later became). However, the verisimilar, rooted type of situation does not limit itself to a prosaic or literal content. If the child To to in Be- trayed by Rita Hayworth "talks film" with his moth- er, here the homosexual Molina becomes a storyteller of film plots. He does not have a discourse of his own; he has, so to speak, no actual discourse. He talks about found objects, ready-mades, preprocessed ma- terials. He is subtly obvious, like a chameleon. Despite his socially devaluated effeminacy, little by little, and almost inadvertently, he "indoctrinates" the revolutionary Valentin, who by contrast mistrusts every aspect of bourgeois culture. Valentin is inter- ested in art only as document or portrait of a political conflict. He keeps a distance, does not want to be- come involved with artistic depiction as such. He wants to possess a discourse, make it purely his own, uncontaminated by misleading half-truths. A libera- tor, an agent of urban terrorism, he possesses an esthetic that is a version (not the most sophisticated) of social realism. Urban terrorism and homosexuality have not ap- peared, to my knowledge, side by side in any other Hispanic novel. Kiss of the Spider Woman deals with those two "burning" questions which polarized the efforts of governmental censorship. The characters' problems and desires are introduced through the vicarious theme of film, which goes on and on spin- ning an equivocal but telling labyrinth of concerns. A great deal of the dialogue is constructed like a folding screen: the characters talk not about themselves but about other stories. This indirect narrative articulates a cluster of implications in which subjectivity and desire are ciphered. A counterpoint is established between, on the one hand, the prisoners' situation, "dead" to society, objects of criminal law, and on the other a conversational matter, a subject - film - that allows them to express, to make present, a version of themselves which denounces and surpasses the pris- on walls. Such a distinction, such a tension - between a place without interest (the jail) and interest without a place (film) - was already at work in Puig's previous novels. Molina, in contrast to the characters of Severo Sarduy, for example, is believable, a lower-middle- class queer from Buenos Aires or some other Latin American city. The film talk opens up a supplemen- tary dimension, another scene through which life can go on for a little while, as if prison itself was not yet a full reality. The opposition (place without interest, interest without place) ciphers a mode of experience. It puts Puig's work at the far end from that of an F. Scott Fitzgerald, whose protagonists situate their dreams in the exact place they inhabit. Puig's charac- ters have been excluded beforehand from the scenes that populate their imagination. In Fitzgerald several characters' grandeur (the "great" Gatsby) and their sublime efforts to be happy depend on their not knowing, or at least not wanting to know, that they have been excluded beforehand and that it is already too late for any of their efforts to succeed. On just the second page of Kiss of the Spider Woman the obser- vation "Don't bother with erotic descriptions, you know it's no good at this moment"1 alludes to a separation between an eventual pleasure and the necessities of the moment, the circumstances of im- prisonment, "the regime of truth and power" that has enclosed Valentin and Molina. Through cohabitation the characters take down, little by little, the barriers between their prefer- ences, attitudes, and positions. To the left-wing mili- tant, a masculine, "normal" man, the homosexual's camp mentality, his effeminacy, and his seeming indifference to political discussion and revolutionary ideas are repugnant. The vicarious theme of the cinema, however, is a bridge between them, and also between the characters and those readers who might also be movie fans. The products they consume are what brings them together. Valentin, the guerrilla fighter, does not entirely acknowledge this. His re- jection of bourgeois culture tends to be global, whereas Molina incorporates its products in a micro- scopic, particularized way. He only evokes frag- ments, and he evokes in order to modify and to adapt them to present needs. Claude Levi-Strauss, on the very first page of The Savage Mind, compares the narrator of myths to a bricoleur: "The materials of the bricoleur are ele- ments which can be defined by two criteria: they have had a use, as words in a piece of discourse which mythical thought 'detaches' in the same way as a bricoleur, in the course of repairing them, detaches the cogwheels of an old alarm clock; and they can be used again either for the same purpose or for a different one if they are at all diverted from their previous function."2 It is legitimate to equate the use of film material by Molina to bricolage. His mar- ginalized and clandestine sexual preferences prohibit him from having a discourse at once actual and public: he must submit in precise ways to the mean- ings and assumptions of a mainstream tradition. He fabricates his myths from bits and pieces of previous readings in an already given universe of culture. The material is conditioned by the commercialism or any sort of propaganda that presided over its production; but the homosexual subtly alters its resonance to suit his own present needs, and he lingers also in the fetishistic nonsense of those fragments. In this re- spect, the absurdity or incredibility of film plots and</page><page sequence="4">584 WORLD LITERATURE TODAY situations is closer to him than are the actual circum- stances of his life in prison. Even though Valentin's attitude toward films is seemingly the opposite of Molina's, he ends up dreaming about them, because they spell out for him too the dramas of his life. Without intending to, he becomes also a bricoleur of the movies that Molina narrates. Through them, problems he thought he had overcome reappear. Levi- Strauss points out the revealing character of the bricolage narrative. Bricolage speaks not only with things but also by means of things, revealing, through its choices between limited possibilities, the character and life of its author. There are moments in Kiss of the Spider Woman when one finds oblique indications of the relationship between Molina's emo- tional life and the films he narrates. In the middle of a story about a possible love affair between an illustra- tor and a maid, she (the maid) makes a remark about one of the illustrator's drawings, a remark that changes her condition from that of a servant to that of a companion; the illustrator passes from indifference toward her to an appreciation of her qualities and falls in love with her. Instead of remembering and repeat- ing her remark, Molina "forgets" it, and through the crack left open by his failed attempt to remember, the reader realizes that a transfer of affection is at play. Molina tries to find out the magical remark, because he also wants to come up with an appropriate remark of his own which might alter his relationship with Valentin. An idea of the little maid about the drawing placed on the music stand, the surprise of the maimed young man. Why, in this moment, does the youngster realize that the little maid has a refined soul? Why is it that some- times someone says something and conquers the other person forever? What was it the little maid said about the drawing? How did she make him aware that she was something more than an ugly maid? How would I like to remember these words? What was it that she said? I can't remember anything about this scene. The illustrator-maid relationship remains mysterious and suspended upon the unresolved relationship be- tween Valentin and Molina. The latter's forgetfulness touches upon the knot or peripeteia, when circum- stances are inverted and rejection becomes accep- tance. Valentin, for his part, suspects that Molina is a mere repository, a memory bank of trivial films: "The empty head, the glass skull, filled with stamps of saints and whores. Someone throws the glass skull against the filthy wall. The glass skull breaks and the stamps fall all over the floor." Molina himself ignores what his stories convey or anticipate, uncertain about their possible implications: "The night nurse is a sleepwalker. Is she asleep or awake? The night shift is long. She is alone and does not know whom to ask for help." His anxiety is articulated through simulated plots which seem to contain an answer to his own dilemmas. The films do in fact prepare it, but only the change of the patterns of interaction with Valen- tin determines the effective outcome of his adven- ture. In a Mexican film Molina evokes, the heroine, a singer, prostitutes herself in order to support her sick lover. Instead of a glass skull this time, a close-up of a glass appears. The drunk lover, his eyes clouded and watery, sees the absent woman he loves come out of it. In his fantasy they both sing alternately the lyrics of a bolero. Molina too prostitutes himself for love; he promises to report on Valentin to the prison authori- ties in order to obtain some extra food, which he shares with the guerrilla. Valentin, without knowing of this arrangement, accepts Molina's love and thanks him. After Valentin makes love to him, Molina says: "I believe that since I was a child I haven't been so happy. Not since Mama bought me a toy or some- thing." Valentin counters: 'Tell me if you remember some toy you liked a lot, the one you liked most, of the ones your mother bought you." Molina replies: "A very blond doll with braids that opened and closed her eyes, in a Tirol dress." Now the coitus fulfills what the gift had announced. Molina finds himself in a feminine position. That is not all, however. Not only does Molina, through the erotic encounter, obtain what he had apparently desired; rather than becoming identical to a woman, rather than achieving a feminine identity, he in fact ceases to have any specific identity what- soever. The most intense moments of the narrated films dissolve the image in its own grain, dissolve the gaze on the screen in a shower of atoms. There is a full moon over the city of Paris. The house garden seems made of silver. The black trees stand out against the gray sky, not blue, because the movie is in black and white. . . . Then, the camera shows her face in a close-up, in some divine grays of a perfect shadow, with a tear that keeps falling. On escaping the eye, the tear doesn't shine much, but upon sliding down her high cheekbones, it shines like a string of diamonds. And the camera again focuses on the silver garden. This opaque/brilliant surface of reflection, restricted by the cinematic medium to the severity of black and white, figures the actual "kiss of the spider woman": the satiny kiss of the screen. Desire encounters a plane or membrane (which, according to Lautrea- mont, also separates the author from the reader), a shining blind border of significant elision. Leni, the woman singer of the Nazi film that Molina narrates, has a singular gaze: "It makes me afraid every time I remember this song she sings, because when she sings it, it's as though she is looking straight into nothingness." Leni's eyes are holes through which a momentary lack of representa- tion is filtered. They are similar to the eyes of a young man with whom Molina was in love: "He has such clear eyes, green, between brown and green, very big, that seem to eat up his face." The eyes that "eat up the face," that devour any given shape, are blind</page><page sequence="5">ECHAVARREN 585 eyes, turned inward into nothingness, opening anoth- er hole. Through this hole the subject can cross. It can turn itself inside out in the culminating moment of the peripeteia. When Molina is made love to by Valentin, he asks if he might touch a mole that Valentin has above his eyebrow. After coitus Molina says, "Now, without wanting to, I brought my hand to my eyebroW in search of the mole." Valentin remarks, "What mole? I have a mole, not you." Molina adds, "Yes, I know, but I brought my hand to my eyebrow to touch the mole I don't have." The mole, as much as the full moon over the city of Paris, marks a realm of invisibility, a blind spot, for lack or excess of brilliance. It invests the peripeteia with a new meaning: not so much the performance of a role as a momentary escape from speculated images, a dissolution of identifying positions. The metaphors of the subject - in the case of Molina the various film stars he admires or the cinematographic roles with which he identifies - vanish. The peripeteia, in this case the coitus between Molina and Valentin, re- moves consistency to whatever image represents the subject, whether it be at the level of reality or at the level of fantasy. It takes the subject to its vanishing point, a fading or death. "Each time you have come to my bed," says Molina afterward, "I don't want to wake up again after I fall asleep. . . . But it's not something that just goes through my head, truly the only thing I ask for is to die." Beyond its representa- tions, its metaphors, the subject, through coitus, evaporates: "I feel a warm glow in my chest, Valen- tin. This is the most beautiful thing. And my empty, no, stupid head, is filled with a light warm vapor. I am filled through and through with this." Coitus confronts Molina with a truth of his desire. He does not merely become yet another image, the woman of his dreams. He does not merely respond to the vocation of a role, but ends up vaporized. If desire has no true representation, then the truth of desire is a lack of representation. For Jacques Lacan, the speaking subject's status is incomplete- ness, division. It is obliterated in the real to be represented, in discourse, by a signifier for another signifier. The peripeteia, rather than consecrating that particular signifier, undoes momentarily all masking. The whole set of feminine signifiers that represent Molina to himself and to others, that reflect him as an other, in an other, dissolve through coitus, so that he can emerge again on the side of the real as an unmasked, faceless body of bliss. In The Buenos Aires Affair Gladys, the female protagonist, was raped and lost an eye during the assault. This lost eye, this blind point, is the exclama- tion mark of executed desire. In this sense eroticism can be seen, at intense moments of resolution, as a violent erasure of any vision or identity or nature, and also as the key to freedom, to a qualitative change, to a resurrected state. Fear and erotic excite- ment go hand in hand for Molina: "When a man embraces you . . . the kick comes from being a little afraid." Freedom is a transitional stage, a wavering and a circumventing, a two-way road between era- sure and fetish. Not a river of no return. If accom- plishment of bliss is contingent upon a loss of identi- ty, from the abyss of nonrepresentation something reemerges, a punctured gaze, a tear rolling down a cheek and passing from opacity to brilliance until it "shines like a diamond" or becomes "the silhouette of a divine, tall, perfect, but very thin, woman . . . wrapped in a silver lame dress that fits her like a sheath." That dress is a topic repeated in Valentin's dream: "The appearance of a very strange woman, with a long shining dress that fits her like a sheath." Diastole and systole, breathing, blinking, oscillating between difference and indifference, focus and fad- ing. From this hole something else appears, however, not only the "old" anthropomorphic roles but also animal ones, the appropriation of fragments of ge- staltic or dynamic codes: a panther woman behind the bars of her cage or running away; a spider woman caught in her own web ("The web grew from her very body, out of her waist and hips"). Beyond and in addition to the magic of the film stars, there is the magic of animal drives and becomings. These becom- ings are real, as experienced (by Molina), although the results (the animals into which one would be turned) are not real. Animals, everything, can appear through the hole in the screen. The screen is a territory, a dimension, an element, a loom which is frontal yet askance, a breadth or width, a bodily import seen yet not entire- ly visible. I don't know how to explain it to you, my love, but the sheet seems to me ... to be in reality the very soft and warm skin of a woman, and you can't see anything else in this place other than this skin that goes as far as the eye can see, only the skin of a woman lying down. I am like a grain of sand in the palm of her hand. She floats above the sea and raises her hand and, yes, from here I can see: this island is a woman.
