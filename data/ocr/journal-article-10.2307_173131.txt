<plain_text><page sequence="1">In scholarly 'writings as well as in the popular press, a reader often finds himself presented with such phrases as "China's aggressive behavior," "Rhodesia's intransi- gence," and "narcissistic France." A familiar international relations text (Lerehe and Said, 1963) offers "a discussion of the individual political actor (the state) and its foreign policy." Such anthropomorphic verbiage not only preserves the HegelJan concept of the monolithic Volksgeist, but also avoids many difficult yet crucial ques- tions of the origins, motivations, and respon- sibility of national action. This paper takes a reductionist approach to the study of national decision-making: it will focus on the individual decision- maker. Although he questions the utility of this approach, Sidney Verba (1959) has written: "It is a truism that all action within the international system can be reduced to the actions of individuals." It is not alleged that the study of individual behavior can provide a complete understanding of national behavior. However mediated by groups, economics, or other considerations, an under- standing of individual behavior remains crucial to any adequate explanation of national or political behavior. The decision-makers with whom I shall be concerned are all those who have any influence on .the international system. From the Almond viewpoint, these would range from individuals with only the vaguest opinions to cabinet ministers and chief execu- fives. By "psychopathology" I shall mean the study of and the existence of mental illness and aberration.2 With regard to "political participation" I shall be concerned with differences in levels of identification and involvement in (Dahl) relationships that involve, to a significant extent, power rule or authority. By using levels of par- tieipation I avoid the somewhat artificial distinction bet~eeeen leaders and followers; furthermore, ordinal relationships yield a more elegant analysis than do dichotomies. Finally, the notion of rationality, which is my fundamental concern, will serve to link psychopathology and decision-making with participation. I will seek to come 1:o an understanding of some of the apparent contradictions between Lane's and Lasswell's conceptions of political man. For many helpful suggestions and criticisms of this paper I am indebted to David W. Minar, Thomas Milburn, and Richard C. Snyder, and especially grateful to Lee Anderson and Michael Shapiro. 2 "Psychopathology" should not be confused with "psychopathy" or, as more recent usage prefers, "sociopathy." The latter two terms refer to behavior which is predominantly amoral or antisocial. Psychopathology, decision-making, and polkical invol /ement BRENT M. RUTHERFORD Department of Political Science, Northwestern Universit[t</page><page sequence="2">388 BRENT M. RUTHERFORD The Unity of Utility Problem Perhaps the most often used proposition of decision-making theory posits that indi- viduals are rational, and that rationality oc- curs when individuals make decisions which maximize their expected utility. This theory is represented by the formula: EUx= (Uaxra) + (UbXPb) + . . . + (Un X Pn), where: EU1 is the expected utility of action 1; Ua, Ub,..., Un are the subjective util- ities of the possible outcomes (a, b, ... n) of action 1; Pa, Pb,..., Pn are the subjective prob- abilities of each of the possible out- comes (a, b,... n) occurring as a result of action 1. Given this equation, a rational decision is made when the individual maximizes his utility: he wfil choose option 1 over option 2 when EU1 ~ EU2. Parchen (1965), reviewing several theo- retical works concerned with the limits of rationality in the maximization hypothesis, finds some writers (G. Snyder, 1960; Singer, 1963; M. Deutsch, 1961) who suggest limitations on the utility concept. Especially in conditions of threat, anxiety, crisis, and high tension, irrationality may arise from a failure to estimate relevant factors correctly, or from a failure to act appropriately on the basis of correct estimates. Such irrationality, it is suggested, may produce such behaviors as anxiety, stereotypes, self-esteem defense maneuvers, and social conformity pressures. Parchen goes on to review empirical investi- gations (Brim et al., 1962; Scodel, Ratoosh, and Minas, 1954; French and Raven, 1959) which describe various laboratory testing situations where subjects do not make their choices in the manner suggested by the maximization hypothesis. Especially re- markable is the fact that the subjects be- haved "irrationally" under conditions which were much less stressful than situations of "threat, anxiety, crisis, and high tension." The proposition would appear to be that, regardless of situational conditions, some decision-makers do not always seek to maxi- mize utility. If the maximization-of-utility hypothesis is to be of even heuristicvalue in the study of political decision-making, it must cope with the problem of the unity of utility. The given model does provide a meaningful framework for understanding why Benjamin Franklin decided, on arriving in Philadelphia, to spend his last ten coppers on bread rather than &amp;lairs. But suppose Franklin had been a public road commissioner charged with building a road from locus X to locus Y. The cheapest and most aesthetic route lies on a straight line from X to Y. Franklin owns a plot of land between X and Y, but off the shortest route, of which he would like to divest himself. Problem: given the maximization hypothesis, which option maxi- mizes utility? In a situation where an in- dividual is acting in a role for the political unit, his utility may not always coincide with the utility of the collectivity. Or, given a different context, a diplomat who has a need to displace aggression onto Asians may not be the person to negotiate a peace treaty with representatives of an Asian na- tion. The diplomat's personal utility is maxi- mized by aggressive ideation, while the objective political utility is maximized by pacific behavior. The problem of the unity of utility was anticipated by Harold D. Lasswell in his pioneering work, Psychopathology and Poli- tics ( 1930; second edition, used here, 1960), although he used different terminology. Having studied a number of politicians who CONFLICT RESOLUTION VOLUME X NUMBER4</page><page sequence="3">PSYCHOPATHOLOGY AND POLITICAL INVOLVEMENT 389 had become mentally ill, Lasswell concluded that the political actormwhether administra- tor, agitator, or theorist--connected his private motives and frustrations with public acts. He offered the general equation: p)d)r=V where' p -- private motives d = displacement onto public ob- jects r - rationalization in terms of public interest P = the political man ) = "transformed into" Following this formula, Lasswell con- cludes (1960, p. 262) that "the distinctive mark of the homo politicus is the rationaliza- tion of the displacement in .terms of public interests." His early work in this field pro- vided for a study of functional politics which would emphasize the elements of the politi- cal decision rather than the description of the legal and structural nature of the politi- cal office per se. Furthermore, the study of psychopathology and political participation focused attention on whole personality pat- terns and clusters of behavioral tendencies rather than on abstracted and isolated leader- ship traits. By bringing psychoanalytic con- siderations to political science, he opened the way for a systematic concern with the irrational in politics. (Here, it should be noted, I have shifted the definition of irra- tionality away from the maximization-of- utility scheme. In the new context it means the persistent inability to learn from experi- ence, to the point where the individual shifts his conception of himself and his environ- ment markedly away from some objective degree of normaIcy.) Criticism of Lasswell's formulation has clustered into two charges. First, the ex- ternal validity of the study is questioned because factors which were found to operate in the case of mentally ill politicians may not be generalizable to those who are not mentally ill (McConaughy, 1950). Implicit in this criticism is the assumption that the mentally ill are clearly distinguishable from the mentally well. Second, the validity of Lassweirs claim that political man displaces personal frustrations onto public objects has been questioned. This reasoning (Lane, 1959, p. 123) runs thus: ff an individual suffers from intrapsychic conflict, so much energy will be consumed by the struggle within the person that no surplus will re- main to cope with conflict in the political arena. Interpersonal relations and ego striv- ings will thus suffer to a great extent. Those experiencing intrapsychic conflict, then, would be expected to withdraw from politi- cal participation rather than project upon political objects. We would have this prop- osition: the higher the level of political participation, the greater the psychic energy need, the less the intrapsychic conflict, and, hence, the more rational the participant. Psychopathology and the Dictator The task of separating political outputs into those stemming from system needs and those stemming from decision-makers' psy- chic personality needs is very difficult. In some cases, however, the distinction may be easier to make. We do find persons in whom substantial projection and irrationality are combined with a high level of political participation; and ff such a description is valid for these persons, it tends .to support Lasswell rather than his critics. Robert C. Tucker, in an article following from his work on The Soviet Mind and The Great Purge Trials, concludes that the para- noid personality is the mark of the totalitar- ian dictator. He says (1965, p. 566) that the available evidence on Hitler and Stalin indicates that "in both instances we have to</page><page sequence="4">BRENT M. RUTHERFORD 390 do with individuals whose personalities would be classified somewhere on the con- tinuum of psychiatric conditions designated as paranoid, and in both instances the needs of the paranoidal personality were a power- ful motivating factor in dictatorial decision- making." Defining a rational decision as one which is consonant with system needs, Tucker examines divergence from this kind of rationality in the Stalin era of Russian history. During 193.6-1938 Stalin sought to cement his position in the Soviet state and Communist party by the plethora of ter- roristic activities known as the Great Purge. For example, the army alone lost three of its five marshals, 13 of its 15 commanders, 62 of its 80 corps commanders, and 110 of its 195 divisional commanders (Harcane, 1959, p. 618). This purge was in no sense a product of ,the system needs of the Soviet state, but rather a result of the private deh- sions of Stalin. His personal view of reality and history was conspiratorial in the in- ternal, external, and ideological spheres. Tucker finds these conspiratorial delusions manifested not only in the purge trials but also in Stalin's Short Course on party history and in the extreme psychological warfare (especially the germ warfare motif) of the post-World War II period. In Lasswellian terms, Stalin's private motives and dehsions of conspiracy were displaced upon public objects the Communist party, internal rela- tions, and foreign relationsmand ration- alized in terms of the public interest, the well-being and security of Russia. It is also difficult to view Hifier's doctrine of an international Jewish conspiracy and the resulting genocide of millions as a sys- tem need. Historical anti-Semitism was, of course, persistent, and Hitler was able to recruit individuals whose dehsions were consonant with his own and to persuade others of the rectitude of such delusions. Nevertheless, Hitler himself remained the central driving force behind the German pogrom. And the primary system need in the Nazi war effort--i.e., system survivalm was certainly not aided by the diversion of resources to the extermination of the Jewish people. G. M. Gilbert, a clinical psychologist at the Nuremberg trials, was able to study materials relevant to Hitler's behavior as well as to examine his lieutenants. He con- cludes (1950, pp. 33-35 and 300--301) that Hitler's fear of a world-wide Jewish con- spiracy was a nearly classic description of a paranoid delusional system. The case history is complete with the aggressive in- transigence and the postures of self-right- eousness and national-righteouness taken by Hitler. Gilbert comes near to paraphrasing Lasswell when he concludes that Hitler "... learned to displace his psychological aggres- sions, to project his feelings of inferiority onto the most popular scapegoat of the time, and to structuralize his political attitudes on these defense mechanisms." The extent to which the private needs of some political leaders can become trans- formed into the raison d'4tre of states can be roughly indicated by comparing national behaviors before and after the elimination of the leader. The death of Stalin would seem to account for most of the change within the Soviet system after 1953. Such a comparison is not possible in the German case, for Nazi Germany did not survive Hitler. One cannot validly draw conclusions for a general theory of decision-making ration- ality from a study of Hitler or Stalin (or Mussolinia). Yet such studies show that some individuals with striking psychopath- ological manifestations do possess enough s Mussolini's decision to commit Italy to the invasion of Ethiopia is examined from the view- point of psychological motivation by Kirk- patrick (1964).

Their participation also seems to have been marked by persistent displacement and pro- jection of private ideations upon public objects. Psychopathology and Democratic Participation If there is plausible psychopathology in some noted totalitarian leaders, what can be said about the emergence of aberrant personalities in nontotalitarian situations? This question has not been treated in a systematic or provisionally complete manner. Some recent works (Tucker, 1965; Verba, 1961; Kaplan, 1965; Lasswell, 1954) do suggest elements of an answer. Tucker calls it "the theory of organizational rejection of aberrant personalities from leadership posi- tions." The structure of the argument runs thus: (1) Modem society is increasingly dominated and controlled by bureaucratic organizations of which national government is the archetype. (2) The pressures of role conformity in .the structural social situations inherent in such organizations tend to minimize the influence of individual per- sonality factors. Actors within the bureauc- racy are constrained by "colleagues, deci- sion-making processes, and role expections" (Kaplan, 1965, p. 359). It is emphasized that leaders with "well-integrated" person- alities and ,those with "relatively few in- ternal conflicts" will be selected by bureau- eratic organizations, while "anxiety-ridden persons" will be selected out in the leader- ship recruitment process, Tucker accepts this formulation as com- patible with the emergence of totalitarian leaders. Hitler and Stalin are not seen as arising from established bureaucracies; rather, they seized control of "fighting organizations." Personality characteristics which may block an individual from bureau- cratic leadership may serve as functional requisites for the leadership of fighting organizations. It is interesting that a style of politics embodying characteristics basically con- gruent with those of Hitler and Stalin has been identified in political "fighting move- ments" in the United States. Hofstadter (1965) has seen a paranoid style of politics persisting in movements of suspicious dis- content. Paranoid rhetoric has been an enduring factor in American politics--wit- ness such early movements as the anti- Masonic, anti-Catholic, and nativist. Many abolitionists saw the antebellum United States enmeshed in a slaveholders' con- spiracy, just as later Greenback and Populist writers saw menacing plots of international bankers. Such a trend may continue today in the extremes of the right and the left, as well as in both sides of the racial con- troversy: the Black Muslims and the White Citizens' Councils are probably more politi- caUy similar than dissimilar in view and style. If these movements are paranoid in rhetoric or manner, then certainly any ex- planation of leaders' origins cannot assert that paranoid politics is solely a phenomenon of totalitarian societies. The possibility that aberrant personalities will be filtered out of positions of leadership in democratic bureaucracies, as suggested by the theory of organizational rejection, may be a specious issue. Governmental bureaucracies are rarely led by, and policy is rarely declared by, individuals incipient in the organization. Rather, such posts are filled by election or appointment, in either case circumventing the supposed ffitering function of the organization itself. If the position is filled by election, the political party may be considered prone to adopt characteristics of the "fighting organization"</page><page sequence="6">392 BRENT M. RUTHERFORD --indeed, it /s one at periodic intervals (election campaigns). It is surprising that the topic of pathology among political participants, of such general interest to disciplines concerned with policy- making, has received so little investigation or even speculation. Some diagnoses of historical leaders have been attempted.4 The difficulty is, of course, that these diag- noses must rely on data which the clinicJan would regard as less than optimal. Even Rogow's (1963) recent study of an overt in- cident of aberration---the case of James Forrestal---was necessarily a reconstruction after the fact. McConaughy (1950) tested South Carolina legislators and found that they scored a mean of 32.8 on the neurotic tendency scale of the Bernreuter Personality Inventory. Because the population norm is given as 50.0, he concludes that his results throw doubt on the hypothesis that "politi- cians go into politics because of feelings of insufficiency or inferiority." There are, however, several problems with this study. Only eighteen of 170 legislators were tested, and we are not told how the eighteen were chosen. The scaling result may only indicate that the legislators had accomplished a successful tension-reducing displacement of "feelings of insufficiency or inferiority." Finally, the validity of the scale itself has been questioned.~ It seems evident that the existence of psychopathology in participants at different levels of activity in democratic situations remains an open question. Psychopathology in the Population As all societies rest on tacit assumptions, perhaps the most widely held assumption in any society is, ultimately, that of its own sanity. Some individuals do suffer more or less from forms of mental illness, but there is little doubt as to the general level of societal mental health. When a person be- comes mentally ill society views it as a strictly individual incident and a rather surprising exception, i.e., deviation. Such persons, whatever the frequency of their maladies, are thought to pose no threat to the assumption of societal sanity. If it is important to inquire about the degree of psychopathology at different levels of political participation, it is also important to inquire about the degree of psychopathology in the population from which the participants come. If filtering does occur--whether by organizational se- lection, self-selection (the anxiety hy- pothesis), or selection by a perceptive elec- torate-at what rate must it occur? The rate of rejection of aberrant personalities need not be high ff psychopathology is rare in the population. But ff psychopathology is widespread, the efficacy of selection pro- cedures (if .they exist at all) must come in- creasingly into question. Almost every text concerned with ab- normal psychology (cf. Wolff, 1950, pp. 3- 14 and 432--44; Coleman, 1956, p. 421) emphasizes that the mentally ill cannot be clearly distinguished from the mentally well. The difference is not a cleft but a gradual slope. Behaviors of different individuals range in imperceptible gradations from nor- mal to abnormal. Sigmund Freud was greatly interested in the existence of neu- rotic tendencies in individuals who function well in society. In The Psychopathology o[ 4 Some examples: Nebuchadnezzar is found to have suffered from lycanthropy, a disorder in which he thought himself to be a wolf or a wild beast; Saul, king of Israel, suffered from manic-depressive episodes (Coleman, 1956, p. 20). Cromwell is diagnosed as exhibiting para- noid delusions; Gandhi, as an obsessive-compul- sive; and Napoleon, as a hypomaniac (Blumel, 1950, pp. 65-97). 5 Wesman (1952) has found the Bernreuter especially vulnerable to "lying good."

Fortunately there is more on this subject than Freud's impressions of the several hun- dred patients with whom he was familiar. The Midtown Manhattan Study (Srole et al., 1962) by the Cornell Medical School was designed to determine the actual pre- valence of mental disturbance in society, that is, nontreated psychopathology. Using the techniques of what could best be termed social psychiatry, the investigators drew a probability sample of 1,666 Man- hattan residents and interviewed them ex- tensively. Only 18.5 percent of the re- spondents were found to be free of mea- surable psychopathologictendencies. (When diagnoses differed, the healthier rank Was used.) Of the remainder, none was insti- tutionalized and only 5.4 percent were receiving professional care. This study is probably representative of urban popula- tions, but the rate of psychological im- pairment found in Manhattan is not, ap- parently, peculiar to urban centers. The Sterling County Study (Leighton, 1956) of psychiatric disorder and sociocultural en- vironment has sought to discover and treat mental illness in a rural county in Nova Scotia. This study found measurable pa- thology in 84.5 percent of its nonurban pop- ulation. Two studies of school children (cited in Christiansen, 1956) in Scandinavia have reached similar conclusions: H. Wall estimates that neurotic conflict is measur- able in 86 percent of a normal sample in Copenhagen; G. Jonssen concluded that of 220 boys in Stockholm only 21 percent could be classified as being without any nervous symptoms or behavior problems. Despite the diversity of populations, methodologies, definitions, and criteria, and despite the independence of the studies themselves, these findings are in remarkable agreement: about 85 percent of the popu- lation can be considered to have manifest degrees of psychopathology. Two contrast- ing hypotheses can then be considered: (1) If political participants are selected ran- domly from their populations, about 85 per- cent may be expected to exhibit psychopa- thology. (2) If political participants are selected with mental health as a criterion, organizational rejection must filter out the majority of aspirants. It is unfortunate that the Midtown study did not include an assessment of political activity. If it had, the viability of the two hypotheses could be determined. However, organizational activity of the respondents did receive attention, and there are good grounds for relating this to political partici- pation. In his recent review of the literature, Milbrath (1965, p. 17) found more than twenty surveys which supported the prop- osition that "persons who are active in com- munity affairs are much more likely than those not active to participate in politics." Almond and Verba (1963, pp. 300-22), in their study of social and political culture in the United States, Great Britain, Ger- many, Italy, and Mexico, found that where levels of political participation are higher, the level of social and organizational ac- tivity is much higher also. While correspondence between political participation and activity in social organiza- tions is not exact, comparison is useful. In an elaboration of the Midtown study, an indication of mental health risk (R) was de- rived from diagnostic evaluations of the re- spondents.6 If people with tendencies to- ward psychopathology (higher R level) o Langner and Michael, 1963.

RUTHERFORD types of projective techniques, question- naires, inventories, and analytic interviews to all levels of political participants. This was an early plea of Lassweirs (1929), but few political scientists have considered psy- ohopathology even relevant to the study of politics. Only McConaughy has approached the problem among democratic political par- ticipants and his study, as noted above, was limited to eighteen South Carolina legisla- tors. Political participants are not amenable to the assessment of their mental health. In- deed, Dean Rusk (1960) would deny that such an approach is a legitimate method or could produce significantly relevant results. Despite the work of Lasswell and Nathan Leites (1948), Richard Snyder (1962, p. 122) has lamented that "the state of re- search and theory on personality and de- cision role in the field of foreign policy is primitive indeed .... " The next best strategy would be to study individuals whose psychopathologies are al- ready known and who are free to partici- pate in political situations. The first condi- tion could always have been met in psy- chiatric hospitals. Only very recently, how- ever, has meaningful participation been available to psychiatric patients. This has taken place with the introduction of milieu therapy (Artiss, 1962; Cumming and Cum- ming, 1962; Jones, 1954), which attempts to minimize the differences between the hospital environment and the social environ- ment ~to which the patient will return. It is hoped that lessening the gulf will smooth the transition in both directions. Milieu therapy contrasts markedly with the author- itarian approach that formerly dominated hospital administrations.* In the latter type withdraw rather than participate, the ex- pectation is that the mental health risk (R) would decrease as organizational member- ship increases. Table 1 shows that this is confirmed only for the low and middle socioeconomic groups; in the high group the differences in R are trivial and the rela- tionship is not linear. It is from the high socioeconomie group, of course, that most political participants are recruited. The Research From the studies cited thus far, some pertinent questions emerge regarding the possibility of rational decisions on political problems. To what degree may political decision-makers separate their political roles from their personal motivations and person- alities? If some 85 percent of the population endure measurable psychopathology, does the recruitment of political actives involve any "selecting out"? If the totalitarian leader can be typified as a paranoid personality, may democratic leaders too be assigned to a diagnostic classification? And if these questions are important, how would the social scientist proceed to investigate them? In the best of all possible research worlds, the researcher interested in psychology and politics would be invited to administer all 7 The milieu program described in this paper is that operative at Elgin State Hospital, Elgin, Illinois.

Underlying milieu therapy is the principle that each person should be given the oppor- tnnity to express himself in his own manner and style, limited only by the rules that guide society in general. Central to the milieu program is the ward government, which follows from an- other milieu principle---that the patients should maintain initiative and self-deter- mination even in possible conflict with staff and administrators. Each milieu council, which consists of the patients of the ward meeting in their political capacities, has a freely elected chairman and secretary. Meet- ings are held at least once a week, and patients may or may not be required to attend. Although staff members may be present, the meeting and officers are free from staff control or sanction and, in fact, frequently challenge the authority, wisdom, and professional training of the staff. The functions of the councils are usually broad and cover such areas as dispensing funds allotted to the ward, requesting special monies for special projects, organizing and planning social events, making ward regula- tions, invoking and dispensing sanctions for patients breaking ward regulations, andrain some instancesmadvising for the discharge of patients. In effect, then, the ward council is a direct democracy exercising an authori- tative allocation of values: a system which may justifiably be termed political. The research reported below is a study of political participation in ward council government within a psychiatric hospital, and this necessarily limits the generalizability of the findings. That deficiency is balanced, however, by the accuracy of the available diagnoses and data, far exceeding what could be elicited through interviews alone, and by the economy with which these data are obtained. The institutional setting assures the stability of variables which other- wise could only be assumed to be stable or randomly distributed. Method After several visits to the hospital to ob- serve council meetings in progress, and after a pretest in the women's wards, the research proceeded in four stages. (1) Male milieu wards were identified from all those at the hospital. A 16 percent random sample was drawn from each of the twelve milieu wards to determine the diag- nostic typologies characteristic of the milieu population. These were easily obtained from patient files. Where there was any ambiguity, a staff psychologists reviewed the entire file and rendered his conclusions. (2) The participants in each ward were interviewed. Both a quota and a random sample were drawn. The council chairman and secretary were included in each ward. Four other residents--about an 8.5 percent sample--in each ward were randomly selected for interviewing. The content of the interview schedule was dictated by the scope of the research. Level of political participation, interest in political participation, and interest in political ques- tions prior to hospitalization were ascer- tained.

RUTHERFORD and the index of political efficacy (Campbell et al., 1954) were obtained. Since political activity is a function of social position as well as of personal factors, information was elicited which would enable the researcher to estimate respondents' socioeconomic status by Hollingshead's two-factor index of social position. Finally, in an effort to control for ~e distortion which might be expected to prevail in a psychiatric setting, information was elicited which could be checked by other means (e.g., patients' fries). At the end of each interview each re- spondent completed a questionnaire consist- ing of three scales. Because of the expecta- tion of paranoia, the paranoid (Pa) scale of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality In- ventory was administered. Concern about distortion led to the inclusion of a validity scale from the MMPI. The lie (L) scale consists of a group of items that will make the respondent appear in a favorable light but are unlikely to be truthfully answered in the socially acceptable direction (e.g., "I do not always tell the truth," and "Once in a while I laugh at dirty jokes"). Better to understand the results of the Bernreuter Personality Inventory with the South Caro- lina legislators, the third part of the ques- tionnaire consisted of 25 items from that inventory which are most discriminating in a total of 125 items measuring neurotic tendency.? (3) The files of the respondents were then examined. Checks were made for dis- tortion, and a staff psychologist sharpened some vague diagnoses. (4) The final stage in the field research was devoted to assessing the level of ward council participation and the level of mental health of each respondent. Judges were selected from those staff personnel who regularly attended council meetings and were acquainted with the respondents. Three independent rankings of participation were obtained for each ward. One ranking was obtained from one of the three attendants who are with the respondents eight hours a day, six days a week. Another ranking was obtained from the professional staff, either the social worker or the occupational or recreational therapist. The third ranking came from another staff member in either of these two categories. The agreement among judges was high, with a median rank order correlation of .914. The mental health rank- ing was done by the staff psychologist or psychiatrist assigned to each ward. Each respondent was thus ranked in comparison with the other five respondents from his ward on both participation level and mental health level. Results The twelve male milieu wards had about 50 residents each. Ninety-three men were sampled to assess diagnostic typologies char- acteristic of the ward population. In the interviewing stage, two persons refused to be interviewed; two terminated before com- pletion; and three were not responsive to the questions. These seven persons were re- placed in the sample. A total of six respon- dents from each of the 12 wards yielded 72 completed interviews: 12 with council chair- men, 12 with secretaries, and 48 with other ward members. The members of the councils were more heterogeneous than homogeneous. One re- spondent had never registered to vote; an- other had been a school board member.

The mean age was 37.44 years, but the standard deviation of 15.20 years suggests diversity. The median number of years spent at the hospital was 2.4, but the range was from two days to 37 years. Regarding distortion, a thorough com- parison of information obtained from respon- dents and that obtained from hospital files, which is compiled from sources other than the patient, revealed only trivial differences. A comparison of the results of the MMPI lie scale with norms established for that scale indicates that the Elgin respondents were as veracious as the general population (~- 4.57, s = 2.97) at the 52 percentile. The expectation is that distortion is not signffi- canfly different in the Elgin study from that encountered in other survey research situa- tions. Another problem in the present study is the degree to which participation in council meetings may be compared to participation in other settings. If there is any agreement among the scholars interested in political participation, it is on the importance of socioeconomic status. Milbrath (1965, pp. 113-20) cites more than 35 research works which support the proposition that higher status persons are more likely to participate in politics than lower status persons. The relationship between socioeconomic status and political campaign activity persists with a tau beta correlation of .25 between the two variables. It has also been found that a sense of political efficacy is perhaps the best single predictor of all personal factors which explain participation. Milbrath (1965, pp. 56-57) cites research work in five dif- ferent nations which suggests a tau beta correlation of .27 between participation and sense of political efficacy. If participation patterns among Elgin respondents are similar to those prevailing elsewhere, efficacy and participation should be significantly cor- related with campaign activity. Table 2 indicates the percentages of Elgin respondents who mentioned ever participat- ing in a political compaign, and these are cross tabulated with socioeconomic status,</page><page sequence="12">398 BRENT M. RUTHERFORD level of personal efficacy, and the ranked level of participation in council meetings. We see that campaign participation is sig- nificantly associated with the variables which predict political participation in other situations in national samples. Al- though correlational levels are somewhat higher, t~ere is no apparent deviance among Elgin respondents in the salient factors of participation. Furthermore, the table shows that respondents who had been political participants before coming to Elgin con- tinued to be high participants in the ward council meetings. Factors relevant to political participation would therefore seem to be salient in council participation too. We may therefore consider council participation to be fundamentally comparable to participation in other settings. What light can the Elgin study shed on the theory of organizational rejection of aberrant personalities and on Robert Lane's hypothesis that individuals with personality disturbances would tend to withdraw frorn social situations, including political con- frontations? Of the 72 persons in the Elgin sample, only 26 had not been members of a club, organization, or other institutionalized group. Thirteen respondents were members of a single organization; 20 belonged to two organizations; five reported membership in three; four belonged to four; and four acknowledged membership in five or more organizations. When we recall that state hospital populations involve an overrepre- sentation of lower levels of socioeconomic status, the fact that 64 percent of our sample reported having belonged to at least one organization is remarkable. Besides activity in organizations, the level of political interest is a key factor in the motivation to participate politically. Re- spondents were asked: "Would you say that you are highly, moderately, slightly, or not TABLE 3 PERCENTAGE OF POPULATION AND ELGIN RESPONDENTS AT D~FElmNT LEVELS OF EXPRESSED POLITICAL INTEREST POPULATION ELGIN MILIEU SAMPLE* SAMPLE N Percent N Percent High interest 459 27.2 20 27.8 Moderate interest 697 37.2 21 29.2 Slight interest 367 21.8 15 20.8 No interest 230 13.6 16 22.2 Total cases 1683 100.0 72 100.0 Xe -- 3.10 .30 &lt; p &lt; .50, *Source: Campbell et al.

This same query has been asked in national samples (e,g., Campbell et al., 1960, p. 104), and Table 3 compares these results with those from the Elgin sample. The national sample was asked this question during a presidential campaign, so it is especially notable that the level of interest is not higher. Furthermore, the Lane hypothesis suggests that the level of interest among the mentally ill should be markedly lower than that in the general population. A chi-square goodness of fit test shows, how- ever, that the distribution of Elgin patients is not significantly different from that of the national sample. We are thus led to the tentative conclusion that there is little dif- ference in political interest between individ- uals in society and individuals with severe mental illness. Interest in political questions, as an at- titudinal component, is carried over into overt behavior. The Elgin respondents were asked if they had been registered to vote and, if so, how often they had voted. Of the 52 registered respondents, 26 reported vot- ing in "nearly all elections"; 11 said they had voted in "only major elections"; 12 voted only in presidential elections; and only three, although registered, had never voted.

PSYCHOPATHOLOGY AND POLITICAL INVOLVEMENT 399 Thus the transfer from expressed interest to activity appears consonant with expecta- tions. As important as political interest and vot- ing are in a democratic society, they are activities rather low on any decision-making spectrum. The differing levels of the spec- trum have been summarized by Milbrath in Political Participation (1965, pp. 16-22) and are shown in Table 4 along with the percentage of the population which has been found to be active at each level, and the figures for the Elgin sample. Although the population percentages are based on male and female respondents and the Elgin sample is male only, Milbrath (1965, p. 130) reviews works which indicate that sex differences are minimal or mixed in the more modern nations and among the higher status groups. The rankings are a hierarchy because they express the intermediate steps between voting and holding public office, and because they express a hierarchy of costs to the participant. Requirements in- eluding time, personal commitment, and energy increase as one moves from each level to the next higher level. It is because of the energy component that, by Lane's hypothesis, persons suffering from intra- psychic disturbance would tend to withdraw rather than participate. Yet Table 4 indi- cates little difference in distribution between the population and the Elgin sample. Trying to proselytize another voter, exhibiting but- tons or automobile stickers, and especially attendance at political rallies seem some- what more popular among Elgin respon- dents than among the general population. The comparison suggests that, particularly at lower and medium levels of political par- ticipation, individuals with severe mental illness take part as frequently as the general population. The Elgin respondents show no tendency to engage in extremist or fighting-group politics. In response to the question, "Do you generally think of yourself as a Republi- can, Democrat, or what?" fifty-two patients identified with one of the two major parties; nineteen leaned toward one or the other party but preferred independence; only one person insisted that he was a member of the International Workers of the World and would always remain such. The Elgin re-</page><page sequence="14">BRENT M. RUTHERFORD 400 spondents appear to be thoroughly involved in all levels of participation in the main- stream of American democratic politics. If the Elgin people seem to be no differ- ent from others in their levels of participa- tion, how does ward council participation relate to mental health? Taking all the councils together, we find a significant rela- tionship (tau beta correlation .294) between judged participation rank and clinical judg- ment of mental health rank. The magnitude of the correlation is interesting in that men- tal health is probably the greatest single status component which the Elgin respon- dents possess. The therapeutic environment stresses that the primary goal is mental health; the celebrity is the former patient who returns on visiting day. While a high degree of mental health is certainly no barrier to participation, neither is mental health any substantial prerequisite for par- ticipation. It should be noted here that the Bernreuter scale used in other re- search to conclude that legislators had superior mental health failed, in the Elgin study, to show any significant relation- ship between respondent scores and the clinicJan's ranking of mental health.TM Furthermore, high L scorers tend to "lie good"; high Bernreuter scorers supposedly show worse mental health. A correlation of -.497 (p &lt; .01, t -- 22.02) was found between the lie score and the Bern- reuter scale. This would seem to in- dicate that those who wish to put themselves in a good light, to "lie good," are able to manipulate their scores on the Bernreuter to appear more "good" or healthy. Scores on the Bernreuter are a better indication of how the respondent wishes to appear than of his objective degree of mental health. In partial summary, then, the Elgin study seems to indicate that mental health is not a requisite for participation. If the totalitarian leader can be typified as a paranoid personality, do leaders in democratic contexts tend to be of the same diagnostic type? Table 5 compares the milieu council leaders with the milieu pop- ulation sample in terms of diagnostic type. A discussion of the characteristics of these types is beyond the scope of this paper.n However, the typologies are ordered accord- ing to Melanie Klein's (1955.) theory about the positions of various types of psychopa- thology. We see that the distribution for the council leaders (chairmen and secretaries) is markedly different from that of the milieu population from which they were selected.12 Manic-depressive and schizophrenic-para- noid types are overrepresented among the leaders. Blumel (1950) noted that the American politicians he treated in the 1930s were frequently manic-depressives. Still more interesting, however, is the prevalence of individuals on the paranoid continuum in the council leadership. Although only 12 percent of the milieu patient population are paranoiac, fully 46 percent of the leaders are; this is an overrepresentation of nearly ~0 Following is the analysis of variance re- lating the shortened Bernreuter N-1 scale and the clinically-judged mental health rank for the Elgin sample: Source of DF ss MS F n The nomenclature used here follows the variance American Psychiatric Association's (1952) sug- Health rank 5 18,941 3,788.2 1.0.699 gestions.

The Paranoid as a Political Type In this section the characteristics of para- noia and their nexus with decision-making and participation will be discussed? In the official classification of the American Psychiatric Association (1956), paranoid reactions are defined as disorders which ex- hibit persistent delusions, usually perse- cutory or grandiose, without the presence of hallucinations. Intelligence is well-pre- served; behavior and emotional response are consistent with the patient's ideas. Under paranoid reactions, two subgroups are dis- tinguished: paranoia and paranoid states. Paranoia is characterized by an intricate and internally logical system of persecutory and/ or grandiose delusion. The system is more or less isolated and does not interfere with the remainder of the personality. Paranoid states are not as elaborate as in paranoia and not as fragmented and bizarre as in schizo- phrenia. There is no personality deteriora- tion, as there is among paranoid schizo- phrenes. The paranoid does not conform to the popular conception of mental illness--loss of contact with reality, loss of control of ele- mentary impulses, and regressive behavior and attitudes. Hallucinations, false sensory perceptions without actual external stimulus, are not an element of paranoia, but delu- sions are. A delusion is a belief which is ~a The stability of this relationship is shown by a partial replication completed a year and a half later. It was assumed that the ratio of diag- nostic types in the patient population had not changed; only the leaders were studied. Al- though only three of the original leaders re- mained :in office, the circulation of leaders did not affect the marked overrepresentation of paranoid schizophrenics. Thirty-six percent of the new leadership group were of this diagnos- tic type--fewer than originally, but more than three times the expected frequency. x4 This is drawn largely from Norman Came- ron's (1959) discussion of "Paranoid Conditions and Paranoia," in The American Handbook of Psychiatry.</page><page sequence="16">BRENT M. RUTHERFORD 402 without consensual validation in the individ- ual's social group. The paranoid maintains his intelligence, personality, and logical powers. The dynamics of paranoia are fairly well agreed upon: projection and aggression, yet with great sensitivity to social norms. Pro- jeerion is the basic mechanism in all types of paranoid reaction; there is a minimum of accepted guilt, anxiety, and awareness of conflict. The organization of the personality is continually strengthened, but at the cost of rigidity. The paranoid personality often gives the impression of self-sufficiency, su- periority, and certainty. No powers of argu- ment or reasoning can convince the para- noid of the error of his beliefs. If these impressions of paranoia are cor- rect, they are consonant :with conditions which have been considered present or req- . uisite in political participation. Lasswell's notion that displacement and projection are characteristic of homo politicus could serve as a description of the primary defense mechanism of paranoia. Senses of ego strength,~ self-confidence, competence, and effectiveness which have been found as cor- relates of political participation (Milbrath, 1965, pp, 76-77) are also descriptive of the paranoid personality. The Lane hypothesis that "well-inte- grated" personalities with "relatively few in- ternal conflicts" will participate more fre- quently, while "anxiety-ridden persons" will not seek leadership roles, is not contradicted by the prevalence of paranoid participants. The paranoid personality projects and dis- places guilt and anxiety; it is integrated to such an extent that societal consensus and perceptual validation are not required in order to sustain a belief. Then both the Lane hypothesis and the Lasswell hypothesis are probably correct, except that Lane seems to assume that anxiety is the only manifestation of psyehopathology. The distinction of per- sonaity types for political participation should be, not between the mentally ill and the mentally well, but rather between in- ternalizers and externalizers. The political world is a fertile area for the externalization of anxiety and intrapsyehie conflict and, as such, tends to attract individuals with a need to find objects for projection and dis- placement. The remarkable stability and integration of the paranoid delusional belief system were the objects of an ingenious study by Rokeach (1964), in which three schizo- phrenic paranoids, each believing himself to be the one true Christ, were confronted with the existence of the other two. Theft para- noid systems were repeatedly challenged by continued contact with one another, by con- trived communications from individuals im- portant to the subjects, and by other strat- egies. Despite these efforts, and despite transitory strategic retreats by the subjects from their delusions, the self-identification and the beliefs of the three Christs remained substantially unchanged. In addition to this characteristic of an un, shakable belief system, another characteris- tic,--paranoid suspicion---has been viewed by Hoffer (1951; second edition, used here, 1962, p. 114) as functional to mass move- ments. The ill will and spying which he finds rife in these movements seem actually to integrate the followers. "The surprising thing is that this pathological mistrust with- in the ranks leads not to dissension but to strict conformity .... Strict orthodoxy is as much the result of mutual suspicion as of ardent faith." I do not intend to suggest here that high political participants are psychotic para- noids; rather, I suggest that substantial ele- ments of paranoid behavior and belief may be prevalent among higher level partici- CONFLICT RESOLUTION VOLUME X NUMBER 4</page><page sequence="17">PSYCHOPATHOLOGY AND POLITICAL INVOLVEMENT 403 pants. A political environment may be es- pecially propitious for particular paranoid behaviors in individuals not otherwise to be characterized as paranoid in type. Higher participants may tend toward paranoid methods of dealing with their political world. Different degrees of psychopathology are often visualized as a continuum extending from the normal through character disorder and psychoneurosis to psychosis. These dif- ferent categories involve fundamental dif- ferences, and yet a basically similar defense mechanism may be seen operating through- out the continuum. For example, the limited use of projection by normal persons stands next to the predominant use of it by persons with a maladaptive character disorder; this use of projection may turn into xenophobia as a psychoneurotic phobie reaction, and into paranoia as a psychotic reaction. Langner and Michael ( 1963, pp. 412-13) estimated from the Midtown study the prob- able neurotic and psychotic reactions at dif- ferent levels of stress. The two resulting graphs present an interesting picture (see Figure 1). The high socioeconomic status group seems to avoid psychotic adaptation no matter how high their stress scores, yet they are much more prone to neurotic adap- tation, for the same stress scores, than the lower socioeconomic status group. Given equal stress scores and the assumption that these "psychic hammer blows" occur with equal magnitude and frequency in each socioeconomic level, the group from which most political participants are recruited has a very high probability of neurotic adapta- tion. Individuals at these higher socioeco- nomic levels choose, or probably learn, to bend under stress rather than run the risk of breaking. :When an individual has not been success- ful in goal achievement and tension reduc- tion, i.e., when he has received a psychic hammer blow, he may adopt several adap- tive or realadaptive behaviors. The selection of these behaviors (Krech and Crutchfield, 1948) is based on the learning and internali- zation of these methods early in life, and is largely unconscious. When adaptive behav- iors cannot be implemented--as is fre- quently true in the political world--mal- adaptive behaviors may be the resort. Thus an integrated picture emerges of the upper socioeconomic person' he participates po- litically to a high degree, but he also has a high degree of psychic malleability, using mechanisms which frequently include ra- tionalization, aggression, and projection to contend with his environment. It would appear that any explanation of national decision-making must--ff it is to describe the real world--distinguish be- tween the decision-maker's subjective utility and the objective utility of the collectivity. Lasswell's description of political man as an externalizer who rationalizes and displaces his personal motivation onto public objects is supported. Conclusion and Implications Certain cautions must be expressed about the Elgin findings. The sample sizes were exploratory rather than definitive, The re- search was conducted at a single state hos- pital and the characteristics of milieu ther- apy, the patient population, and preferences for a possible diagnostic style can only be controlled by research at other institutions. In no event can the findings of a study of a psychotic population be considered prefer- able to accurate and thorough research on nonhospitalized individuals. Finally, we simply do not know the extent of impair- ment of judgment in subjects whom the community psychiatry studies describe as</page><page sequence="18">404 BRENT M.

This paper began by contrasting two de- cision models, the maximization-of-utility model and the Lasswell displacement model. It was suggested that the first of these as- sumed a unity of utility between the deci- sion-maker and the organization. The Lass- well notion that personality needs---even ab- normal ones--were merged with political CONFLICT RESOLUTION VOLUIVLEX NUMBER4</page><page sequence="19">PSYCHOPATHOLOGY AND POLITICAL INVOLVEMENT 405 outputs was compared with the theory that organizations reject aberrant personalities. Some evidence was noted that the totali- tarian dictator is frequently of a paranoid personality type and, as such, is seen to ra- tionalize private motives in terms of public interest. In addition, a paranoid style of poli- tics seems to be a continuing part of the political scene in the United States, sug- gesting that paranoid politics is not unique to totalitarian contexts. From the Elgin study the conclusion was drawn that even psychotic persons are not markedly different from others in the patterns of political par- ticipation, nor are they especially prone to participate in extremist or "fighting-group" politics. Paranoiac individuals tended to be selected as leaders of proximate democratic groups more often than other diagnostic types. It has been argued here that the more paranoid a decision-maker is, the less ten- able is the assumption of the unity of utility. The Elgin findings support Lasswell's for- mulation of political man as a displacer and externalizer. The generalizability of the Elgin findings is suggested by the fact that several com- munity psychiatry studies have revealed widespread psychopathology, and the social class which furnishes the greatest propor- tion of political participants is also the group with the highest degree of psychic malle- ability. Future research along the lines indicated by the Elgin study would include identifica- tion of paranoid personality types among nonhospitalized individuals, and investiga- tion of the degree to which paranoia may be socially functional rather than incapacitating to the individual. Beyond the immediate concerns of par- ticipation and decision-making, other impli- cations may be noted. Since the paranoid personality is especially sensitive to detri- mental communications about himself, struc' tures of political communication are relevant for further study. The paranoid person seeks to control the flow of such communications, and he may be restive about any surveil- lance centered on himself and his communi- cations. Organizational concern with secrecy may thus be relevant. Paranoia may be an important mediating variable in the study of decision-makers' perceptions and misper- ceptions of public opinion. If modern society is characterized by great division of labor, then a general distri- bution of trust is needed as each individual's ability to care for his own needs decreases. The absence of widespread paranoia might be viewed as a requisite for developing societies. In advanced societies, on the other hand, as responsibility for decisions becomes more difficult to assess, societal paranoia may be both a correlate of development and an obstacle to continued advance. Finally, ff decision-makers tend to possess paranoid personality systems, with attendant belief rigidity and suspicion, their ability to adopt creative and innovative perspectives may be curtailed. The ability of their organi- zations to enter into trustful relations with other organizations may likewise be cur- tailed. The peculiar rhetoric of disarmament is a possible case in point.
