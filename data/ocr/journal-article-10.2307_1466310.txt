<plain_text><page sequence="1">AJ'i RESPONSES AND REJOINDERS Science and a Personal Conception of God: A Critical Response to Gordon D. Kaufman "TRADITIONAL BELIEVERS," as I shall use the phrase, hold that God is personal and is the creator of the world. God is such that God can have knowledge and awareness, perform actions, enter into a loving relation- ship with humans, respond to prayer, and be morally good; God is also believed to be responsible for the world's existence. The idea of a personal God seems to be very important for traditional believers because for them worship and religious life in general are understood in terms of a personal relationship with God. Some of them, nevertheless, have a fairly naive or crude picture of God. God is assumed to be a "big person" or a kind of superhuman being. They have an anthropomorphic conception of God. Others, and certainly a great number of theologians and philosophers working within this religious tradition, have a view that is more nuanced. According to them, even if we cannot adequately describe God with human concepts, it is nevertheless the case that the propositions "God is personal" and "God is love" are closer to the truth than the propositions "God is impersonal" and "God is hate" or the propositions "God is nei- ther personal nor impersonal" and "God is neither love nor hate." They are aware of the analogical nature of religious language, but they never- theless hold onto a personal conception of God and reject the other two possibilities, namely, an impersonal conception of God or a beyond personal/ impersonal conception of God. Perhaps we could say that traditional be- lievers hold that God is not a person but God is more like a person than anything else, for God has (they believe) entered into a loving and caring relationship with human beings.

Gordon D. Kaufman thinks that earlier people were rational in understanding God in such a way or at least that it "was not implausible" for them to do so, but he claims that this is no longer the case because such a conception is incompatible with a central scientific view of the world (410-411). KAUFMAN'S ARGUMENT Kaufman maintains that "as far as we know, personal agential beings did not exist, and could not have existed, before billions of years of cosmic evolution of a very specific sort and then further billions of years of bio- logical evolution also of a very specific sort had transpired" (410). "How, then," he asks, "can we today think of a person-like creator-God as exist- ing before and apart from any such evolutionary developments?" (410). The answer is that it seems to Kaufman "increasingly impossible" (what- ever that means) to make sense of such an idea of God as "creator of the heavens and the earth" (410). He maintains that among theologians, and others involved in the current religion-science dialogue "who otherwise seek to take modern evolutionary biology and cosmology seriously, there is a failure to come to terms directly with [this] problem" (411 nl). He takes the well-known scientist and theologian John Polkinghorne as an example of someone who makes this mistake. Polkinghorne wants to take science seriously, but he assumes that one can hold a personal concep- tion of God and at the same time accept the results of contemporary sci- ence. Kaufman claims that Polkinghorne is mistaken on this point. Why? Because Polkinghorne fails to consider "a central scientific understand- ing," namely, that complex features of the world such as conscious intention, purpo- sive action, deliberate creation of artifacts, loving attitudes and behav- iors, and the like-all attributed to God from the "big bang" onward in the anthropomorphic model in terms of which his notion of God is con- structed-can come into being only after billions of years of complex cos- mic, biological, and historical development have provided the necessary conditions for their emergence to occur. (411 nl, emphasis added) Kaufman's argument seems, thus, to be as follows: 1. Traditional believers hold that God is personal (that is, God has in- tentions and can act, create, love, and the like). 2. But science has shown us that human beings (that is, creatures who have intentions and can act, create, love, and the like) came into exis- tence after billions of years of cosmic and biological evolution.</page><page sequence="3">Stenmark: Responses and Rejoinders 177 3. Moreover, science has also shown that personal beings of any sort could only come into existence after billions of years of cosmic and biological evolution. Therefore, traditional believers should no longer hold that God is personal. What we need to assess is whether the premises of Kaufman's argument are true or likely to be true and whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises. It is self-evident that premise 1 is true given my definition of tradi- tional believers. If we turn to the second premise of the argument, it is clear that Polkinghorne accepts it, and other traditional believers should also do so. But a difficulty is, of course, that the conclusion does not follow merely from premises 1 and 2 because 2 only says something about humans, and we need scientific information that also applies to a personal concep- tion of God. So I suggest that premise 3 (see again the long quotation above) expresses what Kaufman takes to be "a central scientific understanding," besides the content of premise 2, about which he and Polkinghorne agree. If science put restrictions on what kind of personal beings can possibly come into existence, then this information seems to have some bearing on an understanding of God as personal. The problem we face in assessing this argument is, however, that Kauf- man merely tells us that science has shown that personal beings of any sort could only come into existence after billions of years of cosmic and bio- logical evolution. He does not explain why this is so; nor does he specify the scientists who hold this view. This would have been extremely help- ful because it is, after all, something that a scientist of Polkinghorne's cre- dentials has failed to notice. Hence, the issue is about whether science has shown us that personal beings can come into existence only after billions of years of cosmic and biological evolution. There are good reasons to doubt this. Science is typi- cally understood to be able to discover contingent truths, that is, the states of affairs that obtain as matters of fact but which could have been differ- ent. Scientists have as a matter of fact discovered that there exists a planet we call Neptune, that metal expands when heated, and that Darwin was right and Lamarck was wrong. But it did not necessarily have to be this way. It could have been the case that there is no planet Neptune and that metals do not expand when heated. It is logically possible that only eight planets move in an ellipse around our sun and that metals expand when exposed to water. It would be a different world from the one we inhabit, but it is a possible world. In this world scientists could also have discov- ered that Lamarck was right and Darwin was wrong. A necessary truth, on the other hand, is a state of affairs that obtains and could not have been</page><page sequence="4">178 Journal of the American Academy of Religion otherwise. Examples of necessary truths are that no one is taller than him- or herself and that all bachelors are unmarried men. The trouble with premise 3, however, is that it seems to presuppose that science gives us necessary truths, for it tells us that it is only possible that personal beings can come into existence after billions of years of cosmic and biological evolution. On this reading, Kaufman assumes a very controver- sial idea indeed, and it is little wonder that Polkinghorne has failed to take it into account. But things seem instead to be that if, for instance, the natural laws had turned out radically different than they did, then it would have been quite possible that it would not have had to take billions of years of cosmic and biological evolution before personal beings turned up. Perhaps they might have come into existence after a week. They might also have looked quite different from Homo sapiens, but they could still, of course, have been personal beings. Nothing in science contradicts these kinds of possibilities. Things are, however, still more problematic than this, for even if Kauf- man is right in asserting that science has shown that personal beings of any sort may only come into existence after billions of years of cosmic and bio- logical evolution, this still does not imply that traditional believers should no longer hold that God is personal. The argument, even if we grant that its premises are true, does not entail the conclusion or even make it probable. The reason is that the argument tells us about what conditions must be sat- isfied for something to come into being with the properties that are neces- sary for being personal. But, of course, traditional believers do not believe that God came into existence. Rather, they believe that God has always existed. They believe that God is eternal. This is understood either to mean that God is everlasting or to means that God does not in any way exist in time but, rather, outside of it. Either way, traditional believers, in contrast, perhaps, to process theists, do not hold that God has come into being, and this makes God different from God's creation. So even if it is true (which it probably is not) that science tells us that personal beings of any sort could only come into existence after billions of years of cosmic and biological evolution, this is not relevant when it comes to evaluating the personal con- ception of God held by traditional believers because God's existence, ex hypothesi, is taken not to be of that kind. But couldn't Kaufman reply that his point is really that we can no longer meaningfully think about or make sense of a God who is believed not to have come into being because of what the sciences have discovered about the origin of personal beings who come into existence? After all, he asks rhetorically, as we have seen: "What could we possibly be imagining when we attempt to think of God as an all-powerful personal reality exist- ing somehow before and independent of what we today call 'the uni- verse'?" (410, first emphasis added).</page><page sequence="5">Stenmark: Responses and Rejoinders 179 The difficulty is that Kaufman clearly maintains that it is something in the development of science that undermines the idea of an eternal and per- sonal God. But what is this new piece of information that science has dis- covered? It cannot simply be that we and all other living things are- in contrast to God-contingent beings, for that is something people have known or believed for ages. I suggest that it is premise 2 and that Kaufman mistakenly believes it also to be premise 3. But my point is that even if 3 were true, the conclusion that traditional believers should no longer hold that God is personal (because God is believed by them to be eternal) would still not follow. Kaufman could, of course, introduce positivism here, claiming that we can only meaningfully talk about what is scientifically verifiable or falsi- fiable. The idea would then be that because scientists have only discovered personal beings who emerge out of a process of cosmic and biological evo- lution and it makes no sense to talk about anything that the sciences cannot discover (verify or falsify), the personal conception of God lacks cognitive meaning and, therefore, traditional believers should no longer believe that God is personal. But I take it that Kaufman does not want to embrace posi- tivism. It follows that this is hardly the path he wants to follow. In my view, the most reasonable interpretation of Kaufman is that he thinks that the idea that personal beings of any sort could only come into existence after billions of years of cosmic and biological evolution is part of the body of scientific knowledge. But because this is not the case, his argument fails. DOES KAUFMAN ACCEPT SCIENTISM? There is, however, another possible way in which we could interpret Kaufman's argument. Maybe his argument is not really about the limits set by science for possible states of affairs but, rather, about the limits set by science for our knowledge and what we are rationally entitled to be- lieve. It would then be about epistemology and not really about metaphys- ics. Recall that Kaufman writes that "as far as we know, personal agential beings did not exist, and could not have existed, before billions of years of cosmic evolution of a very specific sort and then further billions of years of biological evolution also of a very specific sort had transpired" (410, first emphasis added). Perhaps we have the key to his argument in the phrase "as far as we know." What Kaufman writes here is, of course, not quite right, for traditional believers think that they know that a personal God exists or at any rate think that they are rationally entitled to believe this. So let us, therefore, interpret "as far as we know" as "as far as scien- tists know" and do this also because the argument is, after all, about the relevance of science for a particular conception of God.</page><page sequence="6">180 Journal of the American Academy of Religion Kaufman's argument, then, would in this version contain at least the following premises: 4. Traditional believers hold that God is personal. 5. But as far as scientists know, personal beings did not exist before bil- lions of years of cosmic and biological evolution. There is reason to believe that Polkinghorne accepts both of these pre- mises, and so should traditional believers. But the problem is that the conclusion that "traditional believers should no longer hold that God is personal" does not follow from merely these two premises. Something more is needed. After all, traditional believers do not claim that they base their belief in a personal God on what scientists have (or have not) dis- covered, and they would not even, I guess, be surprised if that is some- thing that science cannot discover anything about at all. As far as I can see, only if Kaufman assumes the truth of scientism, or something akin to it, can he validly derive his conclusion. That is to say, we must accept premises 4 and 5 and add the following: 6. The only reality we can know anything about is the one science has access to. Only then does the conclusion that traditional believers should no longer hold that God is personal seem to follow. Or perhaps that is not quite right. It does not really follow from the premises that it is impossible that a personal God exists. It merely follows that even if such a God exists, we can never know it because our knowl- edge is limited to what can be known through the sciences. Thus, what follows is not that traditional believers cannot believe that God is personal; rather, they cannot any longer claim (if they were aware of this argument) that they know that God is personal. This would clearly make a difference for some traditional believers. Note, though, that at least some of them do not claim that they know that God is personal but, rather, merely maintain that it is rational for them to believe so.' Religion for them is about faith and not about knowledge. However, if we set that aside, then what Kaufman needs to demon- strate is that the claim that the "only reality we can know anything about is the one that science has access to" belongs to the stock of scientific knowledge-or that science implies scientism. But here he runs into deep 1 For a discussion about the differences among rationality, knowledge, and truth, see Stenmark 1995: 216-225.</page><page sequence="7">Stenmark: Responses and Rejoinders 181 problems. The difficulty is that the scientistic belief that we can only know what science can tell us seems to be something that science cannot tell us. How can one set up a scientific experiment to demonstrate the truth of that claim? What methods, for instance, in chemistry, biology, or physics are suitable for such a task? Well, hardly those methods that make it pos- sible for scientists to discover and explain electrons, protons, genes, sur- vival mechanisms, and natural selection. Furthermore, it is not difficult because the content of this belief is too small, too distant, or too far in the past for science to determine its truth-value. Rather, it is difficult because beliefs of this sort are not subject to scientific inquiry. We cannot come to know premise 6 by appeal to science alone. Rather, premise 6 is a view on the theory of knowledge and is, therefore, a piece of philosophy and not a piece of science. But if it is a piece of philosophy, then we cannot know it to be true because we would then have extrascientific knowledge. Thus, the claim undermines itself. This is a very serious problem for the defenders of scientism, for if premise 6 is self-refuting, then it is not even possible for it to be true.2 I cannot be certain that any of these interpretations do justice to Kauf- man's view because he is not as clear as one would like on this point. Nevertheless, the overall conclusion must be that Kaufman has not given traditional believers any good scientific reason for abandoning a personal conception of God.
