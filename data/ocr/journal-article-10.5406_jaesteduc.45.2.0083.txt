<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Darwin and Wagner: Evolution  and Aesthetic Appreciation EDVIN ØSTERGAARD Introduction Two of the most influential works of the Western nineteenth century were  completed in 1859: Charles Darwin’s The Origin of Species and Richard   Wagner’s opera Tristan and Isolde. Although created within very differ- ent cultural traditions, these works show some striking similarities: both  brought about a critical, long-lasting debate and caused conflicting reac- tions after their publications, and both had fundamental and compelling  impact on their disciplines. The perspective discussed in this paper, how- ever, is that both works address the notion of evolutionary thought. In 2009  we could have thus celebrated a double anniversary: it was 150 years since  the manifestation of the evolutionary idea in such different disciplines as  music and biology.  In this article I focus on the following questions: (1) How is the idea of  evolution expressed in The Origin of Species and Tristan and Isolde? (2) What  are common essences of that which Darwin referred to as “descent with  modifications” and Wagner to as “becoming” (“das Werden”)? (3) What ed- ucational potential exists for exploring and understanding evolution when  comparing its historical emergences in biology and music? Using a phenom- enological approach, my aim is to survey, describe, and compare significant  parallels between the two works rather than explaining the connections in  terms of causality (which anyway would be impossible). When approaching  the Darwin-Wagner kinship, my main presupposition is that their works  can be regarded as imprints or manifestations of common ideas and essenc- es expressed in such different disciplines as music and biology.1 I am aware  of the fact that focusing on merely the evolutionary dimension of these two  works necessarily will exclude other significant aspects. I  deliberately avoid  Edvin Østergaard (1959) is a composer, lecturer, and associate professor in science  education. His music has been performed in several European countries, in Canada,  and in the United States. His research focuses on the relation between art and science  from a learning perspective. In 2008/2009 he held a position as visiting scholar at  Harvard University (Graduate School of Education).

Rather, I expand the comparison of the two works to considerations of how  teachers can facilitate students’ meaningful learning of evolution and which  joint role art and science might play. My Interest in the Idea of Evolution I first came upon the curious connection between the Origin and Tristan in  the middle of the 1980s. During my five years of studying life sciences, I  had been especially interested in the descriptions of living nature. What is  genuine living? How can one explain what makes an organism a whole,  more than a mere sum of its composite parts? And how do organisms  change over time? In spite of the definition of biology as the study of life,  I couldn’t quite recognize the living itself: it seemed to vanish in schemes,  physiological models, and chemical compound-based explanations. I had  some vague idea of the living being somewhere “in between” the molecules,  cells, and organs—something that kept it all together, but that itself was in- tangible. During these years of learning science, the history of science was  hardly touched upon, and I had very few chances to reflect on the fact that  this knowledge at one point in history actually had been new. On my own I  gained insight into Darwin’s remarkable life and revolutionary theory. The  fascinating story of the emergence of the 1859 publication of Origin, inevita- bly connected to Darwin’s biography, was not only history reading; it was  the story of the becoming of an idea and its reluctant acceptance by society.  During my years of studying music, I met a totally different attitude   toward the importance of history. Here, music history had a self-evident  role in the curriculum; it was regarded as a necessity for understanding the  nature of music, musical performance, and (in my case) musical compo- sition. This view on history taught me to regard development of musical  thought and practice as a stream of continuous change. Later I fully realized  that this consciousness is especially important for the composer if his/her  aim is to contribute something new to the already vast field of music. In  my music history class, we eventually came to the great works of the Eu- ropean romantic period, and here Richard Wagner’s music, and especially  Tristan, was of profound significance. I remember very well noticing that  1859 seemed to be an outstanding year in music history, just as I knew it was  in the history of biology. But was it a mere coincidence that both Tristan and  Origin were completed in the same year? Might there be more significant  connections between the two works? As my final project in music history, I  chose to investigate the 1859 crossing of the two disciplines of biology and  music, expressed in Origin and Tristan. With benevolent support from my  professor in music history, I was able to finish the project in time.2 JAE 45.2 text.indd   84 4/14/11   2:18 PM </page> <page sequence="3"> Darwin, Wagner, and Evolution  85  Writing the 1988 essay was an initiation to a now more than twenty-year  interest in the coherency of Origin and Tristan. Since then, I have been ac- companied by a curiosity regarding how art and science essentially express  the same idea. A shared idea might sometimes be difficult to recognize be- cause of discipline borders and obvious differences in form and language.  In the 2009 recurrence to Tristan and Origin, I am diving deeper into their  common features. In my current practice as an educator of preservice sci- ence teachers, I have great interest in finding ways to cross the art-science  borders and to explore their common grounds for learning and teaching. Existing Research on the Darwin-Wagner Kinship There are only a few scholars who have noticed the parallels between   Wagner and Darwin. This question—why is there a lack of mutual acknowl- edgment, both from music and science?—is in itself interesting; I will dis- cuss it more thoroughly in the last section of this paper. A few authors are  touching on this kinship without making it a main issue. Giuseppe Sermon- ti, for example, points to the resemblance in that both Darwin and Wagner  are dealing with the “whirlpools of becoming.”3 His juxtaposition does not,  however, comprise an elaboration on how the idea of evolution is expressed  biologically and musically.  One of the first attempts to make such a connection is Jacques Barzun’s  Darwin, Marx, Wagner: Critique of a Heritage from 1941. Here, Darwin’s  theory of evolution is compared with Marx’s social theory and Wagner’s  music and aesthetic view. What they have in common, Barzun argues, is  that all represent a worldview essential for the emergence of fascism and  communism. Thus, they embody a triangle of evil, being responsible for  “the cold world” and the dominance of a materialistic ideology. Barzun’s  attempt to connect Darwin and Wagner essentially comes down to his claim  that Wagner too “had seemingly made final the separation between man  and his soul.”4  Barzun interprets the notion of evolution in Wagner’s aes- thetic as “the progress of culture ultimately requiring the union of the arts  in a popular synthesis of sociological import.”5 This attempt to connect a  particular interpretation of Darwinism to Wagner seems to be politically  biased. The conclusions are drawn without making a clear distinction be- tween Wagner’s own aesthetic foundation and the (mis)interpretations of  this after Wagner’s death. It seems obvious that Barzun’s comparison does  not do justice to the evolutionary character, neither of Darwin’s conception  of nature nor of  Wagner’s conception of drama and music.  Gar Allen more convincingly elaborates on the evolutionary character  expressed in Darwin and Wagner’s work. He too discusses the confluence  between Marx, Darwin, and Wagner, but he enters the 1859 publishing of A  Critique of Political Economy, The Origin of Species, and Tristan and Isolde from  a cultural historical perspective. Allen criticizes Barzun’s comparison for its  JAE 45.2 text.indd   85 4/14/11   2:18 PM </page> <page sequence="4"> 86  Østergaard reductionism: in Darwin’s case, nature is reduced to a “constant  struggle,  battle, carnage and death”; in Wagner’s case, art is reduced to “nothing  more than the forcing of the artist’s will onto mesmerized listeners, an as- sault on sensibility, the domination of the one over the many, and thus lay- ing the psychological foundation for fascism.”6 Instead, Allen points to their  remarkably similar evolutionary view of the world. With special reference to  the Der Ring des Nibelungen, Allen shows that evolutionary traits are found  in Wagner’s drama. In this paper I extend this comparison by carefully ex- amining these evolutionary traits in the music itself. For my own discussion  of parallels between Tristan and Origin, Allen’s claim of the dialectics as a  driving force in both Darwin’s theory and Wagner’s music is most stimu- lating: “Those interactions include, most fundamentally, a dialectical com- ponent, that is, the interaction of contrasting, opposing, or contradictory  processes (forces). The contradictions lie fundamentally within the system,  but also encompass those between the system and its external conditions or  environment.”7 I will return to the notion of dialectics in the discussion fol- lowing the survey of Origin and Tristan. Evolution in The Origin of Species The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favoured  Races in the Struggle for Life was published in London on November 24, 1859.  The reactions were immediate: the first edition of 1,250 copies was sold out  the first day; the book was reprinted several times; and by the time of Dar- win’s death in 1882, six editions had been published. In England alone the  book sold as many as 16,000 copies in the first thirteen years, at that time an  enormously high number. The work was written as “an eminently readable  book for the general public, not as a technical monograph for scientists,”8  a fact that might be one of the main reasons for its popularity. The debate  started immediately, involving not only naturalists and theologians but also  philosophers and the engaged public. The news about the book and its con- troversial conclusions soon spread to other countries. In Germany Origin  was available by early 1860, translated by the pathologist Heinrich Bronn.  The same year the book was published in the United States, the first French  translation came in 1862 (although it had been reviewed in French scien- tific journals a year before), and the first Russian translation came two years  later. What made this into such a debatable book, and why was Darwin’s  scientific argument so provokingly new? The creation of Origin Darwin was not the first to formulate an idea of change in the living world  in terms of new species emerging. A development in nature from simpler  to more complex forms had been claimed already by the Greek nature phi- losophers. Also among naturalists and geologists in the late eighteenth  JAE 45.2 text.indd   86 4/14/11   2:18 PM </page> <page sequence="5"> Darwin, Wagner, and Evolution  87 and early nineteenth century, there was a growing conception of nature in  terms of the emergence of new life forms. But what scientific explanation  could account for the diversity of forms and species found in nature and  their changes over time (evidently shown in fossil findings)? The attempts  to formulate unifying laws for the manifold expressions of nature were built  on findings brought about by prominent geologists like James Hutton and  Charles  Lyell. They showed that Earth is millions of years old and that the  processes that formed the Earth in the past must be the same processes that  operate in the present. In Principles of Geology Lyell claimed that Earth’s sur- face and geological features have been shaped over long periods of time  and that past events might be explained by examining today’s observable  processes. Lyell was the one who made Darwin aware of the significance  of geological phenomena, and in Origin Darwin repeatedly draws on find- ings of fossils to support his theory. On the “affinities of extinct species,”  for example, he writes: “On the theory of descent, the full meaning of the  fact of fossil remains from closely consecutive formations, though ranked as  distinct species, being closely related, is obvious.”9  When seeking an answer to the question of the mystery of the origin of  life, Darwin built on previous theories, especially those of his grandfather  Erasmus Darwin and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, the French naturalist. These  two naturalists had independently proposed theories stating that plants and  animals were not directly controlled by a divine creator but spontaneously  generated out of inorganic matter.10 In 1809, Darwin’s year of birth, La- marck published a theory where he proposed that organisms acquire certain  characteristics during their lifetime that are passed on to one’s offspring.  In Lamarck’s view all organisms are continually acquiring features that  help them adapt to the environment more successfully. Certain animals,  for instance, stretch their necks to reach leaves high in trees. This would  strengthen and gradually lengthen their necks and over a long period of  time originate what we today know as the giraffe. The notion of inheritance  of acquired characteristics, however, soon proved to be inadequate:  Lamarck  (like  Darwin) had no understanding of how traits are inherited and did not  know that an organism’s behavior was not directly affecting its inheritable  characteristics Lamarck was, however, an influential early proponent of the  concept of biological evolution and was among the first to formulate a the- ory of evolution that took into account that organisms adapt to their envi- ronments. His theory had a stimulating effect on Darwin’s own struggle to  formulate a plausible explanation for the evolution of living organisms.  Darwin made his legendary voyage around the world as a naturalist  with the HMS Beagle from 1831 to 1836. Whenever the ship came to a harbor,  Darwin went ashore to collect plant and animal specimens. While organiz- ing his ever-growing collection, he also read scientific works and made ex- tensive notes about the observations he made. He combined Charles Lyell’s  principles of geological processes with his own observations of the varieties  JAE 45.2 text.indd   87 4/14/11   2:18 PM </page> <page sequence="6"> 88  Østergaard of living and fossil species, hereby asking himself: If the Earth could change  over time, might not life as well change? He began to ponder the notion of  small modifications leading to large effects, a thought that fundamentally  contributed to the development of his theory.11 Immediately after returning  to England, he began systematically reviewing his enormously large collec- tion of findings. He had the sketch for a theory ready by 1838, partly written  out in 1844, but waited with the publication until he could be absolutely  sure that his conclusions were scientifically evident. After having received a  short essay from Alfred Russel Wallace, a fellow naturalist who had “arrived  at almost exactly the same general conclusions that I have on the origin of  species,”12 Darwin felt more or less forced to publish his work. After the  double presentation of his and Wallace’s work before the Linnean Society in  June 1858, Darwin used thirteen months to produce a tightly argued book. The idea of evolution in Origin In Origin Darwin’s two main points are that there has been a gradual   evolution of living species and what the mechanism in this evolution is.  Despite the title of his work, Darwin actually talks very little about from  where the species have originated. The essentially new argument in Origin  is the principle by which new species in nature emerged: “I have called this  principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term  of Natural Selection, in order to mark its relation to man’s power of selec- tion.”13 Darwin relates the notion of natural selection directly to artificial  selection, typically found in breeding and selection of plants and animals,  such has been practiced in agriculture for thousands of years. “The key is  man’s power of accumulative selection: nature gives successive variation;  man adds them up in certain directions useful to him.”14 Darwin realized  that the combination of high birth rates and a shortage of life’s basic needs  inevitably would lead to a competition of resources: “Owing to this struggle  for life, any variation, however slight and from whatever cause proceeding  . . . will tend to the preservation of that individual, and will generally be in- herited by its offspring.”15 The notion of “survival of the fittest”—probably  the one most of us associate to the Darwinian theory—does not appear in  the Origin before the fifth edition of the book. This iconic expression, origi- nally coined by Herbert Spencer, suggests that the fittest organisms are those  able to adapt successfully to new surroundings. By repeatedly comparing  artificial to natural selection, Darwin display the difference in purposeful- ness: Whereas artificial selection is goal-oriented, a selection for intentional  improvement, natural selection is not, in spite of the fact that it leads to im- provements for the species. The somewhat ambiguous notion of evolution  lacking a goal, but at the same time leading to improvements, I will elabo- rate more on later (when discussing students’ learning of evolution).  Although Darwin’s theory commonly is known as the theory of   evolution, Darwin does not use the term “evolution” in Origin. There is,  JAE 45.2 text.indd   88 4/14/11   2:18 PM </page> <page sequence="7"> Darwin, Wagner, and Evolution  89 however, one exception: in the very last sentence of the concluding chapter  of the book, where Darwin describes the “forms most beautiful” that “have  been, and are being, evolved.”16 Instead, Darwin uses words like “change”  and expressions like “mutation of specific forms” and “process of modifica- tion.” His expression closest to what we today know as the theory of evo- lution is probably “descent with modification through natural selection.”17   Darwin’s avoidance of the term “evolution” might be due to its connota- tions in the nineteenth century’s scientific debate: The term had originally  been applied to embryonic growth, and it took on its modern meaning in  the mid-nineteenth century through a deliberate extension into all areas of  development.18  Darwin was not able to explain the origin of variation within a  population,  a premise his whole theory is built upon. The scientific explanation for this  was provided through the works of Gregor Mendel, first published in 1865  but rediscovered at the beginning of the twentieth century. This led to the  establishment of genetics, the study of inheritance. Today the idea of ge- netic variation and sudden appearances of new individuals in a population  through mutation is regarded as an essential supplement to the theory of  natural selection. Still, Darwin’s idea of evolution challenged fundamental  scientific and religious beliefs at the time of its publication and in the years  to follow. The questions following this—where do we come from? where  do we go? is there a purpose in Nature, in our lives?—transcend the nar- row boarders of biology or science. Regardless of the many controversies  and debatable questions it engendered, The Origin of Species represents the  scientific breakthrough of a theory of nature as an immense changing flow  of forms—life as a continuous transformation. Becoming in Tristan and Isolde Richard Wagner completed the full score of Tristan and Isolde on August 6,  1859, in Lucerne, Switzerland. However, due to the immense demands the  score put on both musicians and singers, it took nearly six years before the  entire opera was performed. As a full opera, Tristan had its first perform- ance on June 10, 1865, in Munich. Since then the opera has been regarded  as a milestone in Western music; it is acknowledged as the culmination of  German romanticism and at the same time the turning point of the develop- ment of tonal music, inevitably leading to atonality. In what ways was this  work regarded as radically new, and how is evolutionary thought expressed  in it? The origin of Tristan Originally Wagner had intended Tristan and Isolde to be a simple work, an  opera that could easily be performed in the smaller province theaters. Com- pared with “the immense undertaking of the Nibelungen,” when planning  JAE 45.2 text.indd   89 4/14/11   2:18 PM </page> <page sequence="8"> 90  Østergaard Tristan he “had in mind a practicable work” with “a few good singers.”19  Wagner had broken off working with the opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelun- gen; at the time of Tristan’s first performance, only Das Rheingold and Die  Walküre had been completed. For several years Wagner had thought of writ- ing an opera based on the Celtic love story, and in August 1857 he stopped  in the middle of the second act of Siegfried to start on Tristan. By September  he had finished the Tristan poem, and the composing of the opera itself took  place in the period from 1857 to 1859.  In order to understand the huge impact Tristan and Isolde has had on  both the aesthetic debate and musical expression since its first performance,  some major influences should be highlighted. Wagner often referred to the  music of Ludwig van Beethoven as a source of inspiration. In his later works  Beethoven pointed out a modern expression that clearly is perpetuated in  both Wagner’s thoughts on the new drama and in his musical style. In the  last movement of Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony, completed in 1824, the hu- man voice for the first time is introduced in an instrumental form. The entire  movement is an attempt to explore the possibilities of the musical material  presented in the previous movements. After (unsuccessfully) having reca- pitulated the thematic material, the human voice—first as solo voices, then  as a whole choir—is introduced. For Wagner this represented the inevitable  need to transcend the pure instrumental musical form and merge vocal and  instrumental expression into one. This fusion is exhaustively examined in  Wagner’s Opera and Drama (from 1851). Also in Beethoven’s demanding late  string quartets we find anticipations of Wagner’s music. Große Fuge in B- flat major (Opus 133) is a single-movement composition for string quartet,  originally planned as a finale of Opus 130 (1825). Due to its complexity and  suspended character, Beethoven was unable to fit it into the standard form  of a quartet movement. Suspension of harmonic resolution would, as I soon  will come to, become a core feature of Tristan.  A strong and supportive advocate of Wagner and his music was Franz  Liszt. In an extensive letter correspondence during many years, Wagner de- scribed and discussed his artistic ideas and the possibilities of having his  operas performed. Liszt was kept updated on the progress on composing  Tristan, and he was among the first to congratulate Wagner as it was com- pleted.20 In the period of Wagner’s exile from Germany due to his treason- able role in the 1849 uprising in Dresden, Liszt was, together with the con- ductor and pianist Hans von Bülow, Wagner’s most faithful benefactor. In  1850 Liszt produced Lohengrin in Weimar, and this was the last premier of  one of Wagner’s operas until Tristan was put on stage in 1865. Although very  different in musical expression, Wagner explicitly acknowledged Liszt’s in- fluence on his music, especially when it came to harmony.21  Taking these influences into account, Tristan also owes its reputation  as the crucial contributor to the resolution of tonal harmony to Arnold   Schönberg. In a historical perspective Tristan anticipates the twelve-tone  JAE 45.2 text.indd   90 4/14/11   2:18 PM </page> <page sequence="9"> Darwin, Wagner, and Evolution  91 harmonic,  dodecaphony, developed at the beginning of the twentieth   century. Schönberg was the first to formulate dodecaphony; the suite for  piano Fünf Klavierstücke from 1923 is his first completely twelve-tone work.  The close relationship between Wagner and Schönberg was a recurring ob- servation already at Schönberg’s own time. Thomas Mann, for instance,  notes that Wagner “in Tristan already stands with one foot in atonality.”22  The bold harmonic and melodic traits found in Wagner’s Tristan are fully  developed in Schönberg’s music. It should be added, however, that Schön- berg’s groundbreaking works have contributed decisively to the position  Wagner’s music, and especially Tristan, has today. Evolutionary traits in the drama While working as a conductor in Dresden in the 1840s, Wagner had come  across the Celtic love story of Tristan and Isolde. From a complicated and  detailed story, Wagner developed the libretto for his opera, giving it a very  simple structure. The setting is the Celtic world of the early Middle Ages, the  number of characters few: Tristan and his servant Kurwenal; King Marke,  Tristan’s uncle, and his squire Melot; and Princess Isolde and her maid  Brangäne. Act 1 starts as Tristan is returning from Ireland with the Princess,  who is to become the queen to King Marke. Isolde recognizes Tristan as hav- ing killed the man she was to marry. In this encounter Tristan was mortally  wounded and he sought Isolde’s healing power. About to take revenge,  Tristan looked up and gazed into her eyes. At that moment they fell in love,  although each concealed this love from the other. Now Tristan is bringing  Isolde for his uncle, King Marke. Still in love with Tristan, Isolde declares  that, before reaching land, they will be united in death. Both Tristan and  Isolde drink the potion, believing it to be a death potion, without knowing  that Brangäne has substituted it with a love potion. In act 2 King Marke and  his men have left for a night’s hunt, and Isolde and Tristan meet, cursing  the light of day and welcoming the night. Brangäne, keeping watch from a  tower, warns that the night is passing. As daylight begins, King Marke and  his men surprise them. Melot rushes at Tristan who lowers his guard and re- ceives a savage wound before falling back into the arms of Kurwenal. In the  final act 3, Tristan has been taken to his castle in Brittany by Kurwenal, who  has sent for Isolde to heal Tristan once more. As Kurwenal sees Isolde’s ship  approaching, Tristan excitedly tears off his bandages, for Isolde has come  to heal him. Laying in her arms, Tristan breaths his last word—“Isolde.” A  second ship arrives with King Marke, assuring that he has come, too late, to  unite the lovers. Isolde, now roused once more, sees only her Tristan, trans- figured and smiling as, together, they are united in death.  The outer structure of the opera is astonishingly simple: In the opening  act Isolde is the main character whereas Tristan is the center of the third act.  The second act, taking place in the darkness of the night, belongs to Tristan  and Isolde. The complexity of the drama is to be found on an inner level.  JAE 45.2 text.indd   91 4/14/11   2:18 PM </page> <page sequence="10"> 92  Østergaard The two lovers’ relationship is driven by a never-ending tension between  polarities—day and night, light and darkness, life and death, love potion  and death potion. Their love, as impossible as it is, can only be brought out  in the protection of night, far away from the daylight realities. Here, we  find the romantic artist’s affection for the night: “The night is home and  kingdom of all romanticism.”23 In the famous love duet in act 2 Tristan and  Isolde praise the night and ask to be released from this world: O fall, sweet night, upon us both, Though night of love; give us oblivion, Make us forget that we are living. Ah, take us to thy breast! From the world free us!24  Another polarity in the drama is the tension between loyalty and be- trayal. Tristan finds himself in a position where he in all cases will have to  appear as a traitor: If he is loyal to his king and uncle, he must leave Isolde  and thus betray his love for her. If he, however, remains true to his love for  Isolde, he simultaneously betrays King Marke. These tension-creating ele- ments give the drama its characteristic dramatic advance, elements that cor- respond to the suspended tension so prominent in the harmonic language  and in the form of the opera.  A further characteristic of Wagner’s opera is the blending of all accessible  artistic elements: text with music, instrumental sound with vocal parts, and  scenography with the core idea of the drama. In the new drama, Wagner ar- gued, all elements must merge to create a “complete and living body, when  it consists of all the members whose mutual conditionings and supplements  make up its whole”: The ideal is the human body; “[the drama] has only  this in common with its human prototype,—that it is living, and draws its  life from inner life-needs.”25 The intention of creating a Gesamtkunstwerk by  melting all elements into the drama also had consequences for the staging.  In his own Festspielhaus in Bayreuth, Wagner was the first to demand that  the lights be dimmed during the performances. His theater was the first to  make use of the sunken orchestra pit, which at Bayreuth entirely conceals  the orchestra from the audience. The ideal was the perfect blending of in- strumental and vocal sound. The idea of becoming in Wagner’s writings Richard Wagner extensively described both his notion of the new drama and  the process of composing Tristan. In the first part of Opera and Drama, Wagner  makes an extended attack on contemporary opera. He criticizes  especially  Italian and French operas, which he finds characterized by “ready-made”  JAE 45.2 text.indd   92 4/14/11   2:18 PM </page> <page sequence="11"> Darwin, Wagner, and Evolution  93 melodies: “These [contemporary opera-composers] apprehended Melody as  something lying outside of the realm of their art-production, as something  ready-made; Melody, in whose organic generation they had taken absolutely  no part.”26 This formation of “ready-made” melodic material Wagner oppos- es to melodies developing in “an organic manner.” The prototype for such an  “organic generation” Wagner finds in Beethoven: “With Beethoven, on the  contrary, we perceive the natural thrust of Life, to breed the Melody from out  music’s inner Organism.”27 Wagner’s repeated references to organic growth  clearly show that he is deeply influenced by the concept of organicism and  the mechanism-organism debate of the mid-nineteenth century: Mechanistic  explanations of organic processes by reducing them to the molecular level  were opposed to organicism, the notion of the whole being more than its parts.  Wagner’s notion of “organic generation” of music is in line with the claims of  biological organicism that an organism “can exhibit higher-order functions  even though the operation of each part is governed solely by physical law.”28  The “organic generation” of music is not merely a feature of the drama itself;  in order to grasp its essence, one must take part in its generation. Wagner does  not refer to development as evolution, an expression we have seen Darwin  also avoids, but rather as a becoming: A ready-made melody—so we have seen—remained unintelligible to  us, because open to arbitrary interpretations; a ready-made Situation  must remain just as unintelligible, even as Nature herself remained  unintelligible to us so long as we looked on her as something made— whereas she is intelligible enough, now that we know her as the Be- ing, i.e. the forever Becom-ing: a Being (ein Seiendes) whose Becoming  is ever present to us.29 Here, nature is a metaphor for the new drama: Nature is, Wagner claims,  ever-changing, and this essential feature remains hidden to us as long as  we regard her merely as an object, something finished. Interesting enough,  Wagner does not substitute the notion of Being with Becoming, the first be- ing the static, the latter the ever-changing new. Rather, nature—and so also  the new drama—shows her Janus face by revealing herself as both Being and  Becoming; “a Being whose Becoming is ever present to us.” The task of the  opera is to enable its audience to experience the process of change by taking  “an active share” in the generation of the drama: “Plastic art can display  only the Finished, i.e. the Motionless; wherefore it can never make of the be- holder a confident witness to the becoming of a thing. . . . The Drama, alone,  is the artwork that so addresses itself in space and time to our eye and ear,  that we can take an active share in its becoming, and therefore can grasp the  Become as a necessity.”30 Because the opera is a form in both space and time,  the composer is compelled to investigate “the Become as a necessity.” This is  exactly what Wagner does in Tristan, his most radical artistic manifestation  of the ideas formulated in Opera and Drama. JAE 45.2 text.indd   93 4/14/11   2:18 PM </page> <page sequence="12"> 94  Østergaard The idea of becoming in the music The genuine new in Tristan is above all its interweaving of dramatic,   harmonic, melodic, rhythmical, and formal elements. It is with this whole  in mind that I now take a closer look at the musical elements and how these  elements contribute to the opera’s evolutionary character.  In Tristan the pending, unfinished harmony is prominent. Wagner intends  to avoid progressions with too obvious harmonic effects. He introduces this  already in the very first chord of the opera, the so-called “Tristan-chord”:  Figure 1. The Tristan-chord in the second bar of the Prelude to Tristan and Isolde, and  the unresolved dominant-seventh chord to which it progresses (bar 3).  The first melodic line ends on a dissonant seventh chord that is resolved in  the following bar, not to a consonance that one would expect within a tonal  context but to another dissonant chord (which also remains unresolved). The  consequent avoidance of resolving dissonances creates a feeling of ongo- ingness and unfinishedness—and incertitude. “The ear is made insecure,  without another certainty being offered in return,” as Heinrich Poos notes.31  In the opera, harmonic suspension is realized through several means: many  modulations, ambiguous chord resolutions, and harmonic functions; other  chord resolutions than expected (deceptive and incomplete cadences); and  an extended use of chromatic melodic lines. Approaching a cadence is more  often than not blocked by a quick and unprepared switch to a sharply con- trasting key. The harmonic resolution is thus continuously postponed, in- voking a hanging, suspended feel. The harmony is continuously challeng- ing tonal harmony’s most distinct feature—the final returning to the tonal  center, the tonic.  Also the melodies have the quality of being unfinished and in progress.  They are by no means “ready-made”; they continuously take part in an “or- ganic generation.” In the melodic lines, Wagner creates an ever-changing,  nonstatic motion based on a set of recurring leitmotivs: short, melodic themes  connected to a character, a place, or an emotion in the musical drama. Al- ready in the first bars of the Prelude (see Fig. 1) we find two of the central  leitmotifs in Tristan, both consisting of only four notes: the “suffering  motif”  starts on A and ends on D sharp, and the chromatic “longing motif” starts  JAE 45.2 text.indd   94 4/14/11   2:18 PM </page> <page sequence="13"> Darwin, Wagner, and Evolution  95 on G sharp and ends on B. The leitmotifs constantly shift in register and  instrumentation, relative to the importance of the particular leitmotif’s as- sociation with the drama action at that particular point. Through the trans- formative use of leitmotifs, Wagner wants to tie the very fabric of music  itself to concrete entities, that is, to people, objects, or events. Leitmotifs  are “ musical moments of feeling,” themes that themselves evolve as the  drama develops.32 The melodies are often marked by highly chromatic  features. In act 1, scene 2, Isolde sings a chromatic ascending line start- ing with “O my loved one! O my lost one!” This line consists of four of  the “longing motifs,” starting on a D and proceeding through all twelve  notes of the octave. The following thirteenth tone, an E flat, is the end  of the chromatic line and at the same time the beginning of the “death  motif,” sung on “Head unto death devoted!” This is but one of numerous  examples of how melodic lines, leitmotifs, and text are woven together in  the dramatic development.  Regarding formal characteristics, Wagner claims (in Opera and Drama) that  the new drama must possess the unity of the symphony with its web of  transformed and modulated themes. The drama should thus not consist of  a chain of separate arias, recitatives, and ensemble parts. The dramatic ten- sion must not be interrupted by virtuous solo parts or other disturbing ele- ments. Even though Tristan has many solo parts, they are not in effect soli,  at least not compared to the ones found in Italian and French opera. The  ongoing generation of melodies and the suspended harmony postpones the  drama’s end in terms of the full cadence that establishes tonality. This is first  to be found in the “Transfiguration,” the very last scene of the opera. The  development from the beginning of the Prelude to this end represents, as  Wagner proclaims in Opera and Drama, “a growing from below upwards.”33  Whereas the Prelude (seemingly) starts in A minor, the ending of the opera  is (clearly) in B major: after nearly five hours the tonality has “grown up- wards” merely a major second, from A to B. The whole Prelude is an exten- sion of the idea embodied in its first chords, centered on the Tristan-chord.34  In spite of the independent character of the Prelude, having been performed  before act 1 was completed (it had actually two performances even before  Wagner finished the opera), the whole opera is one large dramatic develop- ment evolving out of the seeds planted in the Prelude. This is in contrast to  operas of Wagner’s contemporaries, who normally wrote the prelude after  the opera itself, displaying its highlights. Links between Origin and Tristan These accounts for Origin and Tristan are by no means complete; they  merely serve the purpose of a comparative analysis of their evolutionary   characteristics. In this section I will describe and discuss overlappings of  JAE 45.2 text.indd   95 4/14/11   2:18 PM </page> <page sequence="14"> 96  Østergaard the two works and show that the characters of the two works become more  distinct when compared to each other. Do the biographies of Darwin and Wagner overlap? When studying the curious parallels between these two works, one  obvious  question emerges: Are there any biographical connections between  Darwin’s  struggle to formulate a theory of evolution and Wagner’s artistic works? So  far I have not found proof that Darwin ever referred to Wagner, to  Wagner’s  music, or to the discussion of musical aesthetics taking place in continental  Europe at that time. Darwin did make some remarks on art; these are, how- ever, peripheral compared to his scientific work. Wagner, on the other hand,  made several remarks about Darwin’s theory and publications. The first is  from February 10, 1873, notated in his wife Cosima’s diaries: “In the evening  we began Darwin’s Origin of Species, and R. observed that between Schopen- hauer and Darwin the same thing happened as between Kant and Laplace:  the idea came from Schopenhauer and Darwin developed it, perhaps even  without having known Schopenhauer, just as Laplace certainly did not know  Kant.”35 This entry shows that Wagner was engaged in discussions of his  time, encompassing fields other than art and music. Wagner’s comment on  the connection between Darwin and Schopenhauer is interesting for several  reasons. First, Wagner here points to a common idea as the connecting link  between different expressions (Kant and Laplace, Schopenhauer and Dar- win). The relation between idea and expression is an approach to describ- ing commonalities between forms of cultural manifestations—philosophical,  artistic, and scientific, which I will return to later in this section. Secondly,  Wagner indicates that the ideas of Arthur Schopenhauer are expressed in  Darwin, “perhaps even without having known Schopenhauer.” This state- ment confirms the large impact Schopenhauer had on Wagner’s thought. He  became acquainted with Schopenhauer’s The World as Will and Representa- tion in 1854, and it made a lasting impact on him. In a letter to Franz Liszt  (from December 16, 1854) he writes that he has been occupied with Scho- penhauer, “who has come to me as a heavenly present in my loneliness.”36  Schopenhauer claims that the will is a universal principle that pervades all  existence in its various forms; the most extensive will among living beings  is “the will-to-life, or the continuance of the species.”37 This will is particu- larly manifested in the tragedy of unfulfilled desire, a theme we recognize  as the very driving force in Tristan. In Schopenhauer’s basically negative  philosophy, desire can never be satisfied, and therefore desire is the deepest  source of human suffering. Schopenhauer points to the tragedy as the art  form that provides a genuine copy of the will. He cites the musical drama  as exemplary of the conception of tragedy, a fact that must have had a great  influence on Wagner’s thoughts of the new drama and of Tristan.38 Music  (especially with a clear developmental structure) is, according to Schopen- hauer, able to represent the transformative power of will. This process must  JAE 45.2 text.indd   96 4/14/11   2:18 PM </page> <page sequence="15"> Darwin, Wagner, and Evolution  97 lead from  unconsciousness to full consciousness.39 It is on this basis that we  can understand  Wagner’s second comment on Darwin and Schopenhauer  (from August 7, 1881): “The newspaper contains an article, ‘Kant and Dar- win’, and R. points out how much superior Schopenhauer’s interpretation  of instinct is to that of Darwin.”40 Wagner recognizes a connection between  Schopenhauer’s philosophy and Darwin’s theory of evolution, however,  without elaborating on their kinship and without explicitly relating his own  aesthetic view to Darwin. It is nevertheless interesting for this excursion  into Tristan and Origin that Wagner here in reality provides a clue for how to  search for a common ground.41  Darwin and Wagner lived extremely different personal lives, working  within academic and artistic fields having very little contact with each other.  This fact is not necessarily an argument against finding conjunctions be- tween their works. On the contrary, finding no direct connections but find- ing evidently common features in their work supports the argument that  one and the same idea can be expressed independently in two different ex- pressions. This commonality might occur, paraphrasing Wagner, even with- out their creators having known about each other. Shift of worldview What is the essence of the idea of evolution that is formulated scientifically  by Darwin and theoretically and artistically by Wagner? I will argue that  both Origin and Tristan articulate the shift from one worldview to another:  from change as a repetitive circular movement to development as a cyclic- like process. Let us look closer at how this shift is expressed differently in  the two works. The harmony in Tristan is clearly embedded in a tonal tradi- tion characterized by harmonic development around the tonic center, but it  constantly exceeds its borders. A typical Viennese classic and early romantic  sonata movement would start and end in one specific key. The apparent de- velopment in the sonata form is harmonically speaking an exploration into  neighboring keys, a development that, however, always returns to the tonic  key. The tonic represents a firm basis around which the music takes place.  In Tristan the form is more like a spiral: the melodic-harmonic flow displays  the same expanding and contracting gestures typical found in tonal music,  but in the moment where the tonic center is approached, it is avoided and a  new round starts, different from the previous. Also the drama itself moves  in cycles; this is especially prominent in act 3.42 Change, as circles of various  sizes and durations, is replaced with a spiral-like, perpetual development,  akin to Wagner’s idea of becoming.  The predominant view of change in nature preceding Origin was that of  a God-created world in “static” movement: the observable changes—those  of day and night, summer and winter, life and death—had existed in the  present form since the creation of Earth. Due to an inherent order, the move- ment always returned to its point of departure, like the  metamorphosis of  JAE 45.2 text.indd   97 4/14/11   2:18 PM </page> <page sequence="16"> 98  Østergaard a plant from seed, via leaf formation and flower setting, to new seed. In  Origin Darwin does not deny the cycling character of development, but one  cycle is not identical to the preceding and the following cycles. The differ- ences, even though slight and nearly unnoticeable, will over a long period  of time bring forth substantial change. Because the modifications are so  small, development in the evolutionary sense has been overlooked. Proof  of this descent with modifications Darwin found in the fossil remains and  emerging knowledge from geology. What is constituted in Origin is a situa- tion of progress that basically is open on both ends: whereas the static-circular  worldview vouches for stability and predictability, the dynamic cyclic view  displays an incomprehensible beginning and a dim, unpredictable end. The  spiral-like model is a state of constant movement, replacing a notion of na- ture as fixed, ever-moving, and never-changing. The spiral has, if not an ex- plicit goal, then certainly a movement forwards, if not a specific origin, then  clearly away from the previous, the past.  This emerging view of nature in constant development necessarily raises  the questions of purpose and direction. Thomas Kuhn notes that the most  provoking element in Darwin’s theory was the lack of a goal-directed pro-  cess: “The Origin recognized no goal set either by God or nature.”43  Darwin’s  main focus was on the laws that govern descent with modification, the  struggle for existence and natural selection, not (at least not in Origin) from  where and to where the evolution takes place. The notion of such laws gov- erning the development is of course not directly transferable to Tristan. What  we sense in the opera, however, is a state of continuous becoming, created  by radically expanding the harmonic vocabulary and executing a chromatic  vagueness so fluently. The drama awakes a sense of uncertainty and un- predictability that in its very nature is akin to that of an open development.  But in this state of “Being whose Becoming is ever present to us”44 there is a  goal toward which the drama irrevocably moves: the uniting of Tristan and  Isolde in death. The stages of this development are explicit in the “motion of  Tristan and Isolde’s coming to consciousness of their love at the end of act  1 to Isolde welcoming unconsciousness in the “Transfiguration” the end of  the opera,”45 a development that in fact is the opposite to the one Schopen- hauer describes in The Will. Also, musically the opera has a clear direction  toward an end, the final resolving of the suspended disharmony to a sus- tained B major harmony. Here, we obviously find a fundamental difference  between Origin and Tristan.  Origin implied a fulfilment of the Copernican turn and the loss of a  fixed point from where the rest of the universe can be regarded. It is on  this basis we must understand the immense reactions following its pub- lication. In a similar manner Wagner’s daring opera implied an attack on  the superiority of tonality and the tonic establishing stability. This might  be what Friedrich Nietzsche, the German philosopher and Wagner critic,  JAE 45.2 text.indd   98 4/14/11   2:18 PM </page> <page sequence="17"> Darwin, Wagner, and Evolution  99 sensed when  referring to Tristan as a work of “dangerous fascination.” In his   autobiography, Ecce Homo, he writes: “But to this day I am still seeking for  a work which would be a match to Tristan in dangerous fascination, and  possess the same gruesome and dulcet quality of infinity; I seek among all  the arts in vain.”46 What is so radically new in Tristan, what made it possess  a “gruesome and dulcet quality of infinity”? Is it its quality of seemingly  never-finished and ongoing process? Is it its pessimistic Schopenhauerian  notion of unfulfilled desire as the deepest source of suffering and the ne- cessity to transcend the external world, “the victory of night over day”?47  Thomas Mann notes that Tristan is without doubt the “highest and most  dangerous amongst Wagner’s works.”48 Wagner himself also must have  sensed this: even though he had intended Tristan to be a practicable work,  he knew that he had embodied “the most daring and most exotic concep- tion” in all his writing.49 He was stunned by its radical expression. After  having conducted the Prelude for the first time in January 1860, more than  two years after the whole opera had been completed, Wagner exclaimed:  “The little Prelude was so inscrutably new to the musicians that I at once  had to lead my players from note to note as if we were exploring for pre- cious stones in a mine.”50  The idea of development as a smooth, seamless flow over time we find  expressed by both Wagner and Darwin. In Origin Darwin repeatedly returns  to the idea that the evolution is gradual and continuous, without sudden  leaps: “On the theory of natural selection we can clearly understand the full  meaning of that old canon in natural history, ‘Natura non facit saltum.’ This  canon, if we look only to the present inhabitants of the world, is not strictly  correct, but if we include all those of past times, it must by my theory be  strictly true.”51 Since nature does not perform sudden leaps, development  must have occurred as a long chain of slight modifications, over time even- tually resulting in the emergence of new species. Wagner expresses some- thing of the same idea in Opera and Drama when describing the drama’s  organically growing melodies. On October 29, 1859, two and a half months  after having finished Tristan and less than a month before Origin is pub- lished in London, he writes: “I should now like to call my most delicate and  profound art the art of transition, for the whole fabric of my art is made up of  such transitions: all that is abrupt and sudden is now repugnant to me.”52  Tristan is truly an artwork of transition with its long interwoven text-music  textures, avoiding rapid changes and separate segments, in a continuous  and developmental growth.53 Wagner defines “organic growth” as “a grow- ing from below upwards, an advance from lower to higher forms of organ- ism.”54 The drama itself must be in growth, beginning with the fixation of  the lowest point, “from which we are to start that upward journey.”55 Meta- phorical notions of the “upward journey” we also find in Origin. When writ- ing “for each new species is formed by having had some advantage in the  JAE 45.2 text.indd   99 4/14/11   2:18 PM </page> <page sequence="18"> 100  Østergaard struggle for life over other and preceding forms,” Darwin argues that recent  forms are more “highly developed” than ancient forms.56  Origin and Tristan both express a worldview of changing process; they  both embody a crucial stage in the “transfer of interest from the perma- nent to the changing.”57 Both works enduringly changed their respective  fields and disciplines but also Wagner’s and Darwin’s personal reputa- tions. As the premiere of Tristan and Isolde in 1865 was a major turning  point in Wagner’s career as an artist, the 1859 publication of The Origin of  Species was for Darwin as a scientist. When referring to the crisis of tonal  music in the mid-1800s, Tristan is at its core. And whereas biology after  Origin fundamentally is being understood in the light of evolution, Tristan  paved the way for the public’s appreciation of the tonal abandonment that  rose in his aftermath. Different manifestations of shared ideas The immense importance of Origin and Tristan can of course not solely be   interpreted on the basis of the works themselves and their history of recep- tion; they are also articulations of the particular time and culture in which  they occurred. The common theme of evolution is expressed in the two  works in spite of large professional and personal differences between an  English distinguished naturalist and family man and a German controver- sial composer. The evolutionary idea is embedded in the culture of the mid- nineteenth century with its emerging ideas of progress and development.  Peter Bowler argues that at this time progress was a common theme uniting  the debates in history, archaeology, anthropology, geology, and biological ev- olution. Evolution became an important theme “because it brought together  parallel changes in attitudes towards human history, human origins and the  development of life on earth.”58 Central in this debate was Darwin’s Origin  and its challenging of the church’s hegemony over creation and man’s place  in nature. The Darwinian theory in its original form can, however, hardly be  characterized as a revolution. It was a particularly precise articulation of an  already-existing worldview characterized by the idea of progress.59 It was  first by the emergence of Mendelian genetics that the transition to modern  Darwinism was completed.  When comparing Darwin’s Origin to Marx’s Critique of Political  Economy  (also published in 1859 and later incorporated into chapters 1, 2, and 3 of  Capital), Gar Allen argues that both works deal with change in processes as  developmental. Change, both in the organic and the social world, “comes  about through a series of processes occurring both internal and external  to the system being studied (a natural population or organisms or a soci- ety).”60 In this sense history is more complex than simple chronology, a  sequence of subsequent events, or an unfolding of a plan (divine or sci- entific laws). Here, we find a commonality between Darwin and Wagner  JAE 45.2 text.indd   100 4/14/11   2:18 PM </page> <page sequence="19"> Darwin, Wagner, and Evolution  101 (and Marx) as they appear to reason from a “dialectically materialist,” as  opposed to a “mechanistic materialist,” tradition: “While the philosophy of  mechanistic (or mechanical) materialism sees all processes as composed of  discrete, atomized parts each functioning independently, dialectical materi- alism is a philosophy that emphasizes interaction of parts within complex  systems.”61 The dialectic process is marked by interactions of contrasting,  opposing forces. The contradictions lie both within the system and between  the system and its external conditions or environment.62 Contradictions in  a biological population would be, for example, the struggle for survival in  an environment with the tendency to outrun its food supply—that is, the  contradiction between heredity and adaptation to changing environment.  This polarity forms the very basis on which the whole theory of natural se- lection rests. As I pointed out in the Wagner section, the contradictory forces  in Tristan constitute the tension-creating relationship between loyalty and  betrayal, light and darkness, and life and death. These are forces within the  drama itself, driving the drama to its inevitable end. The development of the  drama is cyclic; it resembles the cycles of cultural development “formed by  the swings from one side to the other” between contradictory forces “for  which both are essential.”63  Wagner’s concept of becoming and Darwin’s descent with modification  can be compared by linking them to a common view of the world: the Zeit- geist, “which develops and carries with it the ideas of individual thinkers,”64  and, I may add, the ideas shared by scientists as well as artists. The notion  of ideas being transformed into actual expression is in line with Aristotle’s  distinction between in potentia, that which is in a state of not-yet concep- tual knowledge or artistic expression, and in actu, that which is expressed  and has received an actual gestalt. The offspring of Wagner’s and Darwin’s  works is the potentiality of shared ideas and attitudes at the time around  1859. Both the idea level and expression level are dynamic and mutually  dependent upon each other. The notions of becoming and descent with  modification, for example, are but two transformations of the Zeitgeist of  the progressive spirit of the mid-nineteenth century. On the other hand, the  very same notions have decidedly contributed to our current understanding  of the spirit of that time. Learning Evolution and Aesthetic Appreciation At the start of this Darwin-Wagner exploration, I had two educational ques- tions: Why should history have a much more predominant position in music  education than in science education? And how can the notion of evolution  be taught and learned by joint efforts of art (music) and science (biology)?  In this last section I will examine educational lessons to be learned from  comparing Origin and Tristan. JAE 45.2 text.indd   101 4/14/11   2:18 PM </page> <page sequence="20"> 102  Østergaard Students learning evolution A major concern for current science education is that many students in   science lessons find themselves faced with an abstract and purely cogni- tive world, separated from their everyday life experiences.65 One challenge  is that knowledge in science is increasingly being detached from its origin  and history.66 Several studies conclude that students have difficulties learn- ing evolution. Students cannot, for example, distinguish between biologi- cal and cultural evolution,67 and students tend to lean toward the idea that  acquired traits are inherited (Lamarckianism).68 In a study of reasoning  about evolution among tenth- and twelfth-grade students, Tamir and Zo- har found recurring use of anthropomorphic and teleological explanations.  When directly asked why they use such expressions, the students replied  that it made it “easier to understand,” that the theory was “more conve-  nient to communicate using these expressions,” and that they were aware  “that this does not prove the mechanistic explanation.”69 In his study of the  role of metaphor in Darwin’s Origin, Niklas Pramling suggests that there are  two reasons why the theory of evolution is difficult to learn: (1) the meta- phorical nature of the formulations of the theory in Origin could result in  certain incorrect ways of reasoning; and (2) it requires an understanding of  a time span that is incredibly difficult to grasp and thus best can be under- stood as a spatial and visual metaphor. Pramling suggests that when teach- ing evolutionary theory, “Darwin’s metaphors should be marked out and  made explicit as metaphors and their role in how he conceptualized and  communicated his theory should become part of the curriculum.”70 In this  perspective, students’ use of anthropomorphic metaphors to make meaning  out of Darwin is not a misunderstanding of unambiguous knowledge con- tent; these metaphors are mirrors of metaphors formulated in Origin itself.  For example, Darwin introduces natural selection as a metaphor of artificial  (goal-oriented) selection. Students, when recognizing purposefulness in na- ture, are (to a certain extent) in line with Darwin’s own initial approach to  explaining evolution.  In Origin Darwin provides an explanation for the phenomenon of   evolution. However, his book is more than an account of the mechanism of  natural selection; it is an invitation to experience the grandeur of Nature. He  thoroughly describes how the descent has led, and is constantly leading, to  forms that have “come to a high stage of perfection.”71 What we witness are  laws of nature in which “endless forms most beautiful and most wonder- ful have been, and are being, evolved.”72 In a poetical, empathic manner  he writes: “I can see no limit to this power [nature selecting variations], in  slowly and beautifully adapting each form to the most complex relations of  life.”73 Aesthetic descriptions like these clearly complement the pure scien- tific explanations provided in the book. When reading Origin “we find our- selves in a world of wonders, a world worth loving; we become  participants  JAE 45.2 text.indd   102 4/14/11   2:18 PM </page> <page sequence="21"> Darwin, Wagner, and Evolution  103 and observers in a life larger than us, and more meaningful.”74 When  reading  Origin we sense that beauty and magnificence is a part of the theory of evo- lution, not something merely added in order to make it more readable. To  support students’ creating a sense of meaning is a task for science teachers.  One way science educators can facilitate students’ understanding of evolu- tion is by more explicitly highlighting this aspect of Origin: that Darwin em- bedded his theory of evolution in an affectionate  appreciation of Nature. As  George Levine argues, “the project of establishing the theory of evolution by  natural selection was not so much the affirmation of a mindless and godless  world, as the revelation that we walk in the midst of wonders; it was an act  of loving engagement with the natural world that allows and fosters, even  without gods and traditional forms of consolation, enchantment.”75  Now, we know that Darwin’s whole fabric was one long argument  against the idea of imposed purpose or a prior intelligent causal force to  plan and predetermine the living nature. Any argument for viewing the  world less “mindless and godless” might therefore easily be thrown into the  unpleasant category of creationism and intelligent design. My point here is  an educational one: If we are teaching our students exclusively the mecha- nism of evolution, this implies a reduction of the aesthetic view of Nature  inherent in the theory in its original form. The view of nature as “a world of  wonders” is part of Darwin’s theory, and it is thus not necessary to impose  an (extra-scientific) meaning onto the theory. It is a contradiction if we as sci- ence educators on the one hand impart a reductionist interpretation of the  phenomenon of evolution whereas we, on the other hand, lament students’  view on school science as abstract and detached from their daily lives. It  is understandable—from an educational point of view also desirable—that  students seek ways to connect themselves to what is taught. Students’ intui- tive uttering of anthropomorphic and teleological expressions might very  well be used in making the theory “easier to understand” because they  are aware of what is presented in class is “the mechanistic explanation.”76  Students might very well spontaneously reach for such expressions with- out having taken up a position between science and creationism. Instead  of teaching the theory of evolution as one large ready-made explanation, it  could be more fruitful to further examine what students intuitively perceive  when reading Origin and trying to make meaning of its scientific and aes- thetic dimensions. Art, science, and aesthetic appreciation This double case study of Origin and Tristan raises the educational ques- tion of how to gain a deeper understanding of the nature of evolution by  equating biology (science) and music (art). First, I do not think that Wag- ner’s Tristan (or any other of his music, for that matter) can be used to learn  the mechanisms of natural selection, the struggle for existence, and other  JAE 45.2 text.indd   103 4/14/11   2:18 PM </page> <page sequence="22"> 104  Østergaard  concepts from evolutionary biology. This would be to reduce music (and  art) to a mere means in the service of acquiring scientific knowledge. And I  do not believe that Darwin’s Origin can be used to illustrate bold harmonic  progressions in music. Rather, this coalescence reveals some implications for  how aesthetic appreciation might be incorporated in teaching evolution and  how the characters of artistic and scientific inquiry might become clearer.  In Origin Darwin displays an aesthetic appreciation of nature that does  not contradict but rather complements the scientific explanations. In music,  and art in general, a sense for its aesthetic expression is crucial—yes, the  ability of aesthetic experiencing is at its very core. Listening to Tristan and  appreciating it as a work of art are more a matter of sensitivity than accu- mulated knowledge. Thus, the opera as an aesthetic experience cannot be  replaced by any amount of knowledge about its evolutionary dimensions.77  While comparing Wagner’s opera to Darwin’s theory of evolution, the aes- thetic characteristics of Origin became clearer to me. I sensed Darwin’s in- tention to embed his whole theory in a fascination of nature in movement. In  Origin there is a sustained love and affection for the wonders of becoming  in nature. This does not imply, however, that one can appreciate nature as  if it were art. As Sheila Lintott argues, nature and an artwork have different  features, and “by appreciating nature as art we either fail to appreciate na- ture at all or we appreciate it in an inappropriate, usually feeble manner.”78  Her conclusion, to appreciate nature as nature, is valid also when it comes to  art—music should be appreciated as music. My main point here, however,  is that the act of appreciation, practiced when listening to music, can help to  experience the aesthetic dimensions of nature, dimensions often disguised  by a mere instrumental interpretation of Darwin. The act of nature apprecia- tion is an invitation to see beyond the mechanisms of evolution, at the same  time avoiding reducing nature to an object to be enjoyed as a work of art  (neglecting the unique properties of nature). In teaching Darwinian evolu- tion, teachers may encourage students to draw on their experiences from  music and art in order to understand how Darwin in Origin merges aesthet- ics and science.  Why does the history of science seem to have a less prominent position  in science education compared to music education? Is it because science  knowledge is regarded as “objective,” free from personal touch, liberated  from the fact that some individuals at certain points actually formulated  this knowledge for the first time? In his study of Darwinian evolution in  religious education, Tonie L. Stolberg argues that learning Darwinism is  an opportunity for students “to gain an appreciation for the similarities  and differences between the way science and religions make sense of our  experiences.”79 The same argument can be used when viewing similari- ties and differences between science and art: that an historical exploration  of the reciprocity of Origin and Tristan—in forms different, but in essence  JAE 45.2 text.indd   104 4/14/11   2:18 PM </page> <page sequence="23"> Darwin, Wagner, and Evolution  105  related—can help students understand how a scientist and an artist respond  to cultural and personal influences. Students can be encouraged to compare  and contrast the scientist’s and the artist’s approach to creating meaningful   understandings of the world. This might clarify the nature of scientific in- quiry as complementary—and not opposed—to forms of art exploration.  The role of history in music and art education is connected to the   consciousness of continuity: the works have been created by individuals  who have transformed (new or shared) ideas into aesthetic expressions. The  intention of teaching history is to present and reflect on artistic creation as  both results of social and cultural conditions and at the same time crucial  agents for history’s further development. This understanding of the role of  history is not less important for teaching science. If Pramling’s conclusion  is correct, that knowledge in science is increasingly being detached from its  origin and history, then a more explicit focus on the evolution of scientific  thought is one way of mending this gap. Darwin’s theory is an excellent  theme for such an exploration because it itself is about change, progress, and  emergence of the new. Emphasizing the history of science might also stimu- late students’ critical thinking of science’s apparent objectivity. It can help  students develop a reflective understanding of science as being in constant  progress and that some of what we hold to be true today was provokingly  new 150 years ago. One way of introducing Darwinian theory in science  teaching is by putting it on stage;80 another is to let students compare Dar- win’s original text with the many interpretations and further developments  of the theory. A third possibility is, in both science and music education, to  focus more explicitly on parallels between the histories of science and mu- sic. This implies highlighting how common ideas are expressed contextu- ally and historically in forms specific for science and art.  This comparative study has intended to bridge the gap between the   so-called two cultures, a gap that according to C. P. Snow might be bridged  “by rethinking our education.”81 A rethinking of art and science in educa- tion might take place in (at least) two different manners: either through the  blending of traditionally separated art and science disciplines to form new  ones, or through an increased mutual acknowledgment of the differences  between the domains of art and science. Stephen J. Gould argues that the  true unification of science and humanities recognizes and acknowledges  their essential differences as great ways of knowing; a unification based on  “equal regard that respect[s] the inherent differences, acknowledge[s] the  comparable but distinct worthiness, . . . and seeks to emphasize and nur- ture the numerous regions of actual overlap and common concern.”82 It is in  this sense of art-science rethinking that the comparison of Tristan and Origin  is fruitful. Instead of evening out the differences between an opera and a  work of science, their characters have become more distinct. Origin is more  than a scientific theory based on logic and rational argumentation; it is an  JAE 45.2 text.indd   105 4/14/11   2:18 PM </page> <page sequence="24"> 106  Østergaard  aesthetic account of the wonders and beauty of nature. Tristan is more than a  subjective piece of art; it clearly reflects dimensions of evolution akin to sci- entific explanations of the phenomenon. The Darwin-Wagner conjunction is  an  excellent example of how two individuals, working quite independently,  express a similar idea. Even though art and science are marked by contrast- ing, often conflicting and seemingly noncommunicative cultures, in the case  of Tristan and Origin these differences are more stimulating than disturbing.  This conclusion might be utilized in both music and science education.

I also used this comparative method in my 2005 Einstein project. Here, I describe  essential themes of which Einstein’s physics is a physical-mathematical expres- sion. These themes I subsequently reformulate into musical language and form,  further using the comparison between physics and music as a source of reflec- tion on the kinship of science and art.
