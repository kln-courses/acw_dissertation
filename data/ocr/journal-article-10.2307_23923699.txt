This beautifully designed and richly illustrated book about the fifth-century synagogue in the lower city of Sepphoris addresses two groups of questions and thus will attract different groups of readers. First, it is a full archeological report, impatiently awaited by many since the spectacular discovery of the synagogue in 1993; second, it aims at an iconographical analysis and comprehensive interpreta tion of the mosaic floor against the background of late antique Jewish culture. Weiss goes far beyond the limits of archeological methodology and offers an inter disciplinary approach that takes account of art historical research and late antique Jewish sources in reading the contents of the mosaic. Most of the chapters are given to a precise, clear, and admirably illustrated description of the stratigraphie results, the architecture, the numismatic finds, the mosaics, and the inscriptions. Some of this material, as the chapter on the small finds, was written by collaborators. On grounds of numismatic finds beneath the floor and stylistic considerations, the structure is dated to the early fifth century. Regarding both architecture and decoration, the synagogue of Sepphoris stands out among other late antique synagogues: the long and narrow proportions of the nave; the fact that there is only one, extremely narrow aisle and one row of col umns; the lack of any remains of a Torah shrine—an absence typical for early syna gogues, but unusual for the Byzantine period; and orientation to the west instead of to the south-facing Jerusalem. Some of these peculiarities were caused by the exist ing urban layout in which the synagogue was built. Although the general layout and the theme of the nave mosaic recall that of numerous other Palestinian synagogues, presenting a depiction of the temple implements, a zodiac, and biblical represen tations, it is also marked by several idiosyncrasies. The zodiac signs are accom Studies in Iconography 27 - 2006 201</page><page sequence="2">panied by personifications of the months; in the center we find the sun and the quadriga, but the conventional figure of Helios is missing. Both the temple theme and the biblical episodes are more elaborate than elsewhere. The shrine surrounded by the temple implements is not a merger between a synagogue shrine and the ark of the covenant as in other synagogues but is, clearly and unambiguously, the façade of a temple with Greco-Roman characteristics. Using a traditional iconographie approach, Weiss discusses at length the po tential pictorial sources of the mosaic (chapter 3, section D). He concludes this sec tion by saying that it has no real artistic relatives, and that it is based rather on the biblical text and rabbinic traditions. He, therefore, goes on to consult rabbinic texts in an attempt to read the pavement's imagery and to reach a comprehensive, secure understanding of the originally intended program. Talmudic texts, for example, pro vide a link between the Binding of Isaac and the Hospitality of Abraham. Both are understood as a symbol of God's promise to Abraham. The zodiac, in a bold and in teresting interpretation, is read as an allegory of God's power. This, Weiss convinc ingly argues, would account for the lack of the anthropomorphic figure of Helios as it is found in other synagogues. Weiss's ambitious approach, however, suffers from some methodological draw backs. Over the last twenty years, art historians have grappled with the dilemma of the applicability of texts to the interpretation of visual art. Weiss, an archeologist who may not be aware of these considerations, has a different dilemma: although some of the details in the mosaic correspond to the textual evidence and can easily be read against its background, others clearly do not. Notwithstanding the several lacunae in his analysis, he concludes that the iconography clearly and unambigu ously reflects the rabbinic worldview. His discussion is aimed largely at confirming his interpretation of the mosaic as a program of "promise and redemption," a direction already taken by Weiss himself together with Ehud Netzer in a small catalogue that accompanied the mosaic on its international tour between 1996 and 1999.1 Despite the wealth of rabbinic text material, our knowledge of late antique Judaism and our methodological framework towards its understanding are far from watertight. The documentation of Jewish culture and thought of the late antique period is primarily rabbinic, and although it is very rich, it does not cover everything. Of other facets of Jewish life we have significantly less evidence. Any interpretative approach based on rabbinic sources thus will suffer necessarily from lacunae, Weiss's analysis not excluded. For some elements, the rabbinic sources are helpful; for others, as the author himself is quite aware, they can offer only little understand ing. For some motifs the rabbinic sources seem to reflect specifically fourth- or fifth-century Palestinian rabbinic thought; for others the origin is more remote in 202 Book Reviews</page><page sequence="3">time. Thus the hope of fully comprehending a pictorial program remains an illusion. Regarding Weiss's use of source material as supporting evidence of his main theses, one might wish for somewhat more differentiation as to changing cultural back grounds or different time frames. Although cited abundantly, the rabbinic sources do little to explain the numerous striking idiosyncrasies of the Sepphoris mosaic as compared to other floors. It is not the lacunae as such, however, or the ambition to reach an entire compre hension of the program that leaves this reviewer with a certain discomfort; rather it is the claim of exclusiveness that characterizes Weiss's interpretation. A few other scholars, for example, have suggested readings of the mosaic or parts of it that con sider the immediate context of fifth-century Sepphoris, focusing on the peculiarities of this floor in comparison to others. Not all these suggestions are discussed in Weiss's book;2 others, such as Joseph Yahalom's careful reading considering the pos sible involvement of a priestly class in the Sepphoris temple imagery,3 are all too easily dismissed. The reason for this dismissal is the same problem of lacunae in the documentation that Weiss's approach itself suffers from occasionally. Moreover, the possibility that an image could be conceived, read, and received at several levels is never acknowledged. The promise-redemption theory does not entirely exclude the possibility that under certain circumstances an image can be understood from different points of view. An involvement of priestly ideology does not entirely contradict the promise-redemption theory. The rabbinic worldview is not such a clearly definable notion distinct from any other possible worldview, as Weiss seems to imply. As if to secure his own interpretation more firmly, Weiss rejects vehemently alternative interpretations, claiming that none is sufficiently supported by textual or historical evidence. The proper context for reading the promise-redemption pro gram is, in his view, the late antique Jewish-Christian controversy. Here too Weiss is aware of the lacunae of the textual and historical evidence: as far as we know, Christians did not settle in Sepphoris or elsewhere in the Galilee before the late fifth century. No Jewish sources from this period are known to react polemically to Christian biblical exegesis. But there are more lacunae: the two biblical scenes that serve as important pieces of evidence in Weiss's discussion are preserved very fragmentarily, and most of the iconographical details are lost. The images can be identified only with dif ficulty. From the Jewish point of view, for example, the Hospitality of Abraham is a story about the annunciation of Isaac's birth. The Christian understanding of the story is based on concepts of Jesus's incarnation and the Trinity, as is made quite clear in Christian visual renderings of the meeting at Mamre. Nothing in the small Sepphoris fragment, however, suggests a polemical message referring to such per Studies in Iconography 27 - 2006 203</page><page sequence="4">ceptions. Despite its poor condition, we can guess that the image focused on Isaac, God's promise of progeny and redemption, and the announced birth of the patriarch. It is, however, difficult to follow Weiss's claim that the panel yielded an explicit polemical message against the Christian reading and reacting to it. There is nothing there that tells us that the Sepphoris community was aware of the particular Christian aspects of the imagery, conveying the message of Incarnation and the Trinity, and that the mosaic was meant to establish a polemical dispute. This does not mean that the Sepphoris community lived as an isolated cultural entity unaware of the rivalry and debate that were in the air wherever Jews and Christians lived more closely together, and wherever Christian theologians voiced their claims. But general aware ness does not necessarily imply understanding of the particulars of Christian typo logical readings of specific biblical stories, especially not in a Galilean community remote from the centers of Christian theology. Despite these reservations, there can be no doubt that the book is an important contribution to our understanding of the material and visual culture of late antique Judaism in the land of Israel. Meticulously and carefully documented in the descrip tive part, and stimulating and bold in interpretation, it will open up many paths for future discussion.
