<plain_text><page sequence="1">CRITICISM OF THOMAS HARDY'S NOVELS: A SELECTED CHECKLIST B. J. ALEXANDER This checklist is intended to supplement part of the bibli? ography of Hardy published by Maurice Beebe, Bonnie Culotta, and Erin Marcus in 1960 in Modern Fiction Studies. Although originally intended to cover only the period from 1960-70, it does contain references to work done in 1971 and the first half of 1972. Because of its convenience for scholars, the Beebe format has been retained here: Part I lists general scholarship dealing with the novels; Part II presents (A) the place of the novel in the Wessex edition, (B) editions with introductions, afterwords, or notes, (C) specific page numbers from the general studies of Part I, and (D) special studies not previously cited. Since availability has been considered as well as impor? tance, such work as unpublished dissertations and most foreign criticism has been arbitrarily excluded. The titles of the major books are capitalized. Works by one scholar are listed chronologically rather than alphabetically. I. GENERAL Abercrombie, Lascelles. THOMAS HARDY: A CRITICAL STUDY.
