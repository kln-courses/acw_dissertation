Earth Education, Interbeing, and Deep Ecology TOM ANDERSON Α Ν Ν 11 Ν A SUOMINEN GUYAS Florida State University We believe that the current environmental crisis can be addressed by changing our relationship with the Earth that sustains us. This entails a reorientation of the idea of self to include an understanding that one is integrally and relationally part of everyone and everything else. Grounded on the ideologies of deep ecology and interbeing, we propose an Earth Education paradigm for art education and learning in the arts. In this article, we describe the crisis of environmental degradation and its root causes that have estranged people from the natural world. We suggest changes that may result in reconnection and address the potential role of art education in effecting these changes.

Arguably, the biggest current issue before humankind is environmental degrada tion (Hanh, 2008; Kahn, 2010; Louv, 2008; Speth, 2008). The current rapid worldwide environ mental decline has been caused primarily by people (Gore, 2006; Speth, 2008), and so is a sociocultural issue as much as an environmen tal one. Many (Jackson, 1994; Kahn, 2010; Naess, 2008; Speth, 2008) have argued that the existing environmental problems are a manifestation of our competitive and consumerist society, which frames the natural world primarily as resources to be exploited. This attitude has been said to result in a corresponding separation of people Global Warming and Consumer Culture from each other and from other species, as well Most scientists have said that Earth's current as from the Earth that sustains us (Hanh, 2008). imbalance is connected to human activity To address this problem, we argue for a para- (Gibson, 2009).

Employing an environmentalist Earth Education perspec tive, in this article, we describe the problem of environmental degradation, define deep ecology and the paradigm of interbeing as a praxis-based philosophy for developing a sense of place, and suggest principles to guide the implementation of deep ecology and interbeing in art education theory and practice.

ENDNOTE une or the reviewers ot this paper rightly claimed that the poor and disenfranchised may be the first to suffer from a reduced material standard of living if the principles of deep ecology are embraced and that such an issue is one, potentially, of social (in)justice and, therefore, is political in nature. While we do not have the space to address this issue here, we agree that this is a problem and envision that it is exactly this kind of issue that will give substance to theory and practice in Earth Education. * Studies in Art Education / Volume 53, No. 3 245</page></plain_text>
