<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ted Hughes's Metaphysical Poems Wodwo by Ted Hughes . Faber and Faber, 25/-. More and more people are speaking of Ted Hughes as the out- standing living English poet, but I don't think any very clear reasons for thinking this have yet been given and consequently it isn't clear whether he is supposed to be only the best of a bad lot or really good by any standards, challenging comparison with some of the most famous English poets of the past. A main and good reason for the excitement is probably the fact, which I think must be difficult not to recognise, that Hughes has done some small things with the bold ease and perfection and the absolute inability to be trivial of a largely gifted writer. By small things I mean both details within poems and relatively small and unambitious whole poems. Everybody recognises the truth in some of his lines while none of us supposes he himself could have produced the lines - could have had the courage to see so vividly. "Full Moon and Little Frieda", from the new volume Wodwo , does admittedly stand out among Hughes's shorter poems and shouldn't be thought of as simply a small thing, but I'd like to open this review with it because there are still strong sceptics about Hughes's gifts and I believe this poem is irresistible: A cool small evening shrunk to a dog bark and the clank of a bucket - And you listening. A spider's web, tense for the dew's touch. A pail lifted, still and brimming - mirror To tempt a first star to a tremor. Cows are going home in the lane there, looping the hedges with their warm wreaths of breath - A dark river of blood, many boulders, Balancing unspilled milk. "Moon! " you cry suddenly, "Moon! Moon! " 395</page><page sequence="2">396 CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY The moon has stepped back like an artist gazing amazed at a work That points at him amazed. The sceptics sometimes speak of Hughes as unoriginal, leaning above all on Lawrence, and sometimes as a violent, inwardly anarchic poet, all too much to the taste of Mr. Alvarez. This poem will surely support neither notion. A more general and more posi- tive way in which the best poems in Wodwo should overcome such misconceptions (and thus increase appreciation of the best poems in the two earlier volumes) is by making it clearer that Hughes's fundamental subject-matter is much the same throughout his poetry and that it is metaphysical. "Full Moon and Little Frieda", the beauty of it, wouldn't exist if there wasn't a metaphysical apprehension at its heart, in the delicately balanced relationship between the familiar and domestic country life and the larger life of the sky, at falling dusk. And in this special quality, although the poem is light, may not Hughes genuinely challenge comparison with the famous dead? There are certainly Keatsian qualities be- yond Hughes, but was such a profound beauty, sensuous and spiritual at once, always just beyond Keats? Hughes himself seems now to understand and distinguish his essential subject-matter better and to be more confident of it. Of the essence here seems to be his gift for a telling, light and clean, sometimes humorous and sometimes not quite humorous, abrupt- ness and brevity of statement. While he has always tried to make use of such baldness, I don't think he has previously used it so much or so well. The first and title poem of the first volume, The Hawk in the Rain (1957), contained the striking line - His wings hold all creation in a weightless quiet - but at this date this fancy couldn't be put down without the would-be supporting but in fact ruinously encumbering weight of some strong Hopkinsian stuff about the poet who is the hawk's antithesis ("Bloodily grabbed dazed last-moment counting/ Morsel in the earth's mouth"). In Lupercal (i960) the famous - I think over-famous - "Hawk Roosting" gives the same metaphysical fancy more confidently, in Now I hold Creation in my foot Or fly up, and revolve it all slowly</page><page sequence="3">TED HUGHES'S METAPHYSICAL POEMS 397 and at the end in Nothing has changed since I began. My eye has permitted no change. I am going to keep things like this. But the full free humour that these last lines in particular ought to have is still a little locked in by the poem's forced stress on a more commonplace idea, that of the hawk's ferocity ("My manners are tearing off heads"); and as a result it's difficult to read the last lines without beginning to clench one's teeth in quite solemn menace, even though to do so is not only to destroy a good effect but to be ridiculous. The poem holds itself too solemnly for the spiritual perception to be able to breathe. This, in contrast, is how the last poem in the sequence "Skylarks" from Wodwo begins and ends: Like those flailing flames That lift from the fling of a bonfire Claws dangling full of what they feed on The larks carry their tongues to the last atom Battering and battering their last sparks out at the limit - So it's a relief, a cool breeze When they've had enough, when they're burned out And the sun's sucked them empty And the earth gives them the O.K. And they relax, drifting with changed notes and - But before they plunge into the earth They flare and glide off low over grass, then up To land on a wall-top, crest up, Weightless, Paid-up, Alert, Conscience perfect. Here, among other things, the didactic stress on inhumanity has gone. And the now completely uninhibited anthropomorphism makes the recognition of the birds' own other and non-human</page><page sequence="4">398 CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY centres of life not the less but the more complete. The baldness helps to create some final apprehension of the skylarks' intense self- sufficiency of being. The fancy is not an overtly metaphysical one here, but for that we can turn from birds to insects, and the passage from "Skylarks" should help readers who don't already know "Gnat- Psalm" to see the wit and the subtle, lingering justice in its final startling conceit (addressed to the gnats) : Your dancing Your dancing Rolls my staring skull slowly away into outer space. The baldness isn't humorous or witty in all or even most of the good poems. Rather than being of the essence the humour is a kind of accidental bonus sometimes flowering at the top of the vivid imagination and relish. It is the strong kind of humour which can enter and leave without being noticed and about the presence of which a reader can sometimes be unsure. It isn't present by the poet's will. But it's natural to stress this humour when Hughes's general reputation hardly encourages one to think him capable of it and when the earlier poems did do just a little to justify that reputation. Actually Wodwo should help us to see both more humour and more possibilities of humour in earlier poems. "Macaw and Little Miss", for example, in The Hawk in the Rain, may begin to seem nearly a very good poem, spoilt by a hard if gallant and sympathique didactic intention. In Lupercal "To Paint a Water Lily" seems to me now a better poem. But in both the earlier volumes there are better poems than "Hawk Roosting" which, even if some of them do stand pleasantly on the brink of being so, are nevertheless not humorous - "The Thought-Fox" and "Wind" in The Hawk , for example, and "Pike", "November", "The Bull Moses" and "Sunstroke" in Lupercal. And some of the fancies in the new volume are grim or bleak (''The Wind Flashes the Grass" and "Pibroch"), while the first section of the volume closes with some not completely unsuccessful attempts at statements more powerfully grim. The metaphysical apprehension that most often recurs in the poems, in ever new and differing ways, is - crudely - that each different centre of life is the spatial and temporal centre of all life, of the universe. In his attractively enthusiastic review of Wodwo in The Listener Mr. Graham Martin rightly protested against any tendency to regard Hughes "as a sort of Zoo Laureate",</page><page sequence="5">TED HUGHES'S METAPHYSICAL POEMS 399 but he seemed to me to be snatching too hastily for an alternative account and to mislead when he wrote that "the animals aren't there for their own sake, but as metaphors for a particular human vision, embodying either a sometimes active, sometimes baffled pri- mary energy, or an unthinking predatory violence, awful in both senses, whose human application should need no spelling out." On the contrary, I suggest, the whole point is to see each animal for its own sake. And any reader who really manages to see such an obvious human application when he reads one of the poems in question has defeated the poet and is being another example of that "Egg-Head" who, in The Hawk in the Rain , "with circum- venting sleights/Of stupefaction" shuts out the world's knocking With a welcome.1 But necessarily the interest present in the animal poems isn't an interest only in animals and it is just as much present in quite other poems. In The Hawk in the Rain we are challenged to take in something essential both about "The Casualty" - In a scene Melting in the August noon, the burned man Bulks closer greater flesh and blood than their own, As suddenly the heart's beat shakes his body and the eye Widens childishly. and about a new-born baby - who lies long, long and frowningly Unconscious under the shock of its own quick. And something similar is done with "Acrobats" and a sleeping tramp ("November") in Lupercal, with marooned men ("The Rescue") and even "Public Bar T.V." and "Her Husband" in *1 like the sentiment of "Egg-Head" without thinking the poem one of Hughes's good ones. It doesn't seem to be one of those early poems in which he is already writing his own language either altogether or predominantly. "The Casualty" is one of them and something of the distinction that I'm making here can be seen in the quotation from it that follows immediately in the text: in "Bulks closer greater flesh and blood" Hughes was surely falling off just for that moment into a conventionally poetical language.</page><page sequence="6">400 CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY Wodwo. There are also inanimate subjects - rocks, pools, mountains, the sea, a harebell, trees, thistles. The fresh perception of the other, strange being and of its power and centrality stirs the perceiver out of his own conventional everyday self and, quietly and un- consciously, into a fuller possession of his own power and centrality. This he has in a peaceful inner balance with that other centre of existence, in separateness and distance, when he has completed his essential recognition of it. Constantly in Hughes's best poetry there is that activity of imaginative realisation that is also, without deliberate intention, an activity of fresh self-realisation. In a number of the poems, like "The Casualty", the perceivers are themselves an important part of the subject-matter and in others, like "Wind" and "Sunstroke", they are actually the protagonists, very much participating and suffering in the situations described. Four of Hughes's prose stories (which I'm very glad to see collected with the poems and one other story in Wodwo - there is also a radio play which I could gladly have done without) are like these latter poems. The assault on the protagonists of the violent or otherwise disconcerting experiences is given faithfully and vividly, sometimes remarkably so, but only in order to carry them and us out of the ordinary selves which most of the time we comfortably inhabit and into a deeper, quieter and truer life. The physical violence which is in a good many, but by no means all, of Hughes's poems is thus not gratuitous or sensa- tional. Even when it has been difficult or impossible to tolerate, as it has occasionally been in the past, it has only been the slightly mismanaged expression of a large and generous man's zest and relish, like the braggadocio of histrionic speech and poetical hyper- bole that also mars earlier poems. And otherwise it is necessary, serving that purpose beyond itself. It is also true that on occasion in the past Hughes has spoilt the rendering of that activity of imaginative realisation by moralising its significance, its "human application", into something smaller and more commonplace. I've already given some examples of this, and there are many more. In this respect "The Rescue", in Wodwo , is an improvement on the good early poem, "The Casualty". The poet simply gives the shock of incomprehension and then recogni- tion with which the rescuers see the extreme condition of the speechless marooned men and he does not muffle its profound suggestion by adding any such observation about the rescuers' secret complacency as he does add in "The Casualty". In such cases</page><page sequence="7">TED HUGHES'S METAPHYSICAL POEMS 4OI it was usually by adding to a poem that Hughes spoilt it (seriously or not): in other words, the poem's real inspiration was perfectly sound. "Acrobats" may be one stanza too long, "The Casualty" roughly one; "Thrushes", whose high reputation rela- tively to other poems in Lupercal is in my opinion undeserved, has only three stanzas in all but is two too long. The language about our ordinary and our truer selves is, I know, not far from describing the effect of almost any good work of art - if it describes anything. But the shape of this common movement of the imagination does stand out unusually clearly in much of Hughes's work. It is also sometimes his express interest and as early as "The Thought-Fox". This shape is often what gives to a good poem of Hughes's its satisfyingly strong form; or, rather, this shape is the poem's strong form. The movement of the imagination towards making one of those essential recognitions may be a sinuous one and may differ in detail in every case but it is a single movement; and w*hen it has been accomplished, and enacted in the poem, there can be no more to say. Hence that use of baldness. It's most obviously by this strong and significant shaping that Hughes's animal poems distinguish themselves from Law- rence's. None of Lawrence's jottings in verse ends to such decisively poetic effect as does "Full -Moon and Little Frieda" or "Skylarks" or "Gnat-Psalm" or, from Lupercal , "Pike" : The still splashes on the dark pond, Owls hushing the floating woods Frail on my ear against the dream Darkness beneath night's darkness had freed, That rose slowly towards me, watching. But does Hughes bring off large and ambitious poems as well as small ones? I realise that I haven't yet confronted this question that I raised incidentally at the beginning of this review, except by suggesting that the smaller things aren't simply small. On the whole, the most ambitious poems in Wodwo are the poems that I can make least of. And in this respect I find this collection dis- appointing - and also baffling. Of the failure, if failure it is, I can give only a negative and therefore not very confident account. In the poems called "Gog" and "Out", for instance, the writing seems relatively laboured, the images and conceits lacking in inevitability, the impulsion of a strong shaping inspiration absent or at any rate not clear. It may be that the subject of 'realisation', with its atten-</page><page sequence="8">402 CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY dant metaphysical interest, is at the moment Hughes's only subject and is handled by him successfully only in and through the presenr tation of actual cases of realisation. It may be true that most of the good poems have to be short and that of the poems not giving actual cases of realisation only very short ones can succeed. In The Hawk in the Rain the second part of "Two Phases" and in Wodwo "Vegetarian" and "Theology" are thoroughly (and beauti- fully) the epigrams which many of Hughes's good poems have something of the air of being. But, not feeling inward with what I don't like in Wodwo , I can only hypothesise about it in this way. I can't even see what the reasoning could have been behind Hughes's decision to include certain poems in Wodwo and not others: "Shells" and "The Lake", printed in The London Magazine but not collected here, are both poems which this reader for one believes he will want to keep. On the other hand, Wodwo should not only increase appreciation of the good things in the other two volumes - and for myself it has also increased the number of those good things - but also confirm some impressions as to what was wrong in them. After Wodwo Hughes will surely be able to improve some earlier poems by revision and improve by omitting others the general impression that will be made by this section of his future Collected Poems. He is now in his late thirties. The fact that there are seven years between Lupercal and Wodwo and that the most successful poems in the latter don't make a large collection and may all tend towards being epigrams or serious-humorous fancies perhaps makes his future as a poet look a little less hopeful than it might otherwise do. An admirer also has to admit to the more sceptical that, although Lawrence didn't write poems as good as Hughes's best and clearly has a very different tone and temper of mind, Hughes's essential subject-matter is very like subject-matter of Lawrence's. But it is also, of course, Hughes's strength that he should be indebted to Lawrence, as to Wordsworth, - that he shouldn't be the ephemeral violent writer of the age of psychoanalysis, the con- centration camps and the H-bomb but a traditional, classical poet, who has studied the great writers of those calm, genteel ages of the French Revolution and the First World War.1 J.
