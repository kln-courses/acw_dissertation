<plain_text><page sequence="1">Kirrilly Thompson Narratives of Tradition The Invention of Mounted Bullfighting as "the Newest but Also the Oldest" In this article I consider the bottom-up, narrative process through which traditions are invented, using rejoneo (mounted bullfighting) as a case study. I explore the construc- tion of rejoneo as "the newest but also the oldest" form of bullfighting. To understand this apparent contradiction, I synthesize "narratives of tradition" with Eric Hobsbawm and Terence Ranger's (1995 [1983]) "invented tradition." In doing so, I consider rejo- neo through multiple and overlapping narratives structured into historical "chapters" with common narrative elements of heroes, villains, tragic downfalls, and triumphant comebacks. These narratives are contextualized in periods of intense social, political, and economic transformation in Spain over the past three centuries. This article com- bines a review of the lay and expert understandings of the history of the Spanish bull- fight with ethnographic fieldwork undertaken with mounted bullfighters in Andalusia from 2000 and 2001. It redresses a significant lack of attention to the mounted bullfight in relation to the footed bullfight, thereby contributing to a more comprehensive litera- ture of bullfighting in Spain. Moreover, this article provides a model for understanding that one of the ways traditions are invented is through narratives of tradition, contex- tualized by the wider social, political, and economic forces emphasized by the invented traditions approach. While I was researching mounted bullfighting (rejoneo / corrida de rejones) in Andalusia (southern Spain), it became clear that mounted bullfights were less frequent than footed bullfights and less featured in bullfighting maga- Social Science History 34:4 (Winter 2010) DOI 10.1215/01455532-2010-014 © 2010 by Social Science History Association</page><page sequence="2">524 Social Science History zines and on Web sites. Indeed, the lack of academic literature on mounted bullfighting relative to footed bullfighting was a critical factor in my deci- sion to carry out ethnographic research in Spain. During an interview with a rejoneador (mounted bullfighter), I asked how rejoneo fit in the bullfighting world at large. He responded by saying that "rejoneo is the newest but also the oldest" form of bullfighting. This statement lends itself to Eric Hobsbawm and Terence Ranger's (1995 [1983]) concept of invented traditions. That is, this rejoneador was con- structing an uninterrupted link between present and past practice. Draw- ing from the well-supported argument that all traditions are by definition invented (Handler and Linnekin 1984; Herzfeld 1991), I explore how groups and individuals invent traditions through "narratives of tradition." I consider accounts of the history of rejoneo as narratives of tradition to identify some of the ways individuals and groups invent traditions. This approach emphasizes that narratives of tradition can be multifarious and competing, acknowledges that they intersect with other narratives, and understands that they are essen- tially never-ending stories. In this article, I recount the history of mounted bullfighting according to the two dominant and intertwined versions of its origins that circulate in academic and popular literature as well as in the comments of bullfighting aficionados. These involve the history of footed bullfighting through a shared and mutually constitutive moment around 1700. Courtly lancing of bulls from horseback was frequently practiced until the eighteenth century, when it suffered a blow in popularity at the hands of a disinterested French king who assumed the Spanish throne. Footed bullfighting is understood to have risen from its ashes through those who had previously assisted their masters from the ground. Below, I situate this pivotal historic moment in a context of intense sociopolitical and cultural transformation in Spain. This involves an exploration of the significance of class, civil relations, and landownership. At the same time, I outline the inconsistencies or glossed multiplicities in the dominant histories of mounted and footed bullfighting. Ethnographically, the "thick description" (Geertz 1973) of the histo- ries of mounted and footed bullfighting presented in this article redresses a neglect of rejoneo in the literature in relation to footed bullfighting. Theo- retically, it provides a case study to explore how traditions are invented through narrative elements. First, I illustrate how the mounted bullfight can be understood as an "invented tradition." Second, I explore the narrative</page><page sequence="3">Mounted Bullfighting 525 process through which individuals and groups invent traditions from the "bottom up." This involves a consideration of narrative elements, such as beginnings, chapters, plot, pivotal moments, villains, and heroes. This narra- tological approach acknowledges multiple story lines, storytellers, and agen- das that together provide a more comprehensive understanding of how tra- ditions are invented from the "bottom up" as well as from the top down. In doing so, I account for the ernie perception of rejoneo as "the newest but also the oldest." This article is based on 15 months of ethnographic fieldwork undertaken in Andalusia from 2000 to 2001 as rejoneo moved into the twenty-first cen- tury. From a field base in Jerez de la Frontera and stays in El Rocio, Almonte, and Granada, I watched rejoneadores train, had conversations and formal interviews with them, attended footed and mounted bullfights, and was for- tunate to travel with one rejoneador and his assistants to numerous corridas. This last privilege afforded me access "behind the scenes" and behind the barrera (barrier), where I could gain intimate access to the rejoneo event and other rejoneadores. I documented these experiences with field notes; kept a field journal; and collected and studied photos, videos, newspaper articles, and bullfighting and equestrian books and magazines. While I participated in the role of researcher, fan, amateur photographer, assistant, equestrienne, audience member, and friend, my focus was on the rejoneadores, or the per- formers. This research and this article represent an ongoing fascination with anthrozoology, human-horse relations, and performance. Invented Tradition The concept of tradition has "traditionally" been used to refer to the cultural artifacts, behaviors, attitudes, and beliefs that characterize a social group in the present due to an uninterrupted transmission across past generations. That is, tradition has been seen as a form of enduring and uninterrupted cultural identity and capital. As a result, traditions are of interest to social scientists and historians alike.1 They have provided an entrée to sociocultural identity from both synchronie and diachronic approaches. Since the publication of Hobsbawm and Ranger's (1995 [1983]: 2) land- mark Invention of Tradition, the idea of tradition as a "natural" and uninter- rupted chain of historical continuity akin to the transmission of genetic material has been scrutinized and problematized. Attention has been given to</page><page sequence="4">526 Social Science History how the concept of tradition constructs or fabricates a relationship between the past and the present and to what ends (e.g., ideological or political). Hobsbawm challenged the taken-for-grantedness of tradition by regarding it as a process and elucidating a typology of traditions. In particular, he pre- sented tradition as an invention. Accordingly, "'invented tradition' is taken to mean a set of practices, normally governed by overtly or tacitly accepted rules and of a ritual or symbolic nature, which seek to inculcate certain values and norms of behaviour by repetition, which automatically implies continuity with the past" (Hobsbawm 1995b [1983]: 1). These ties, or the past itself, may not exist per se.2 Prefacing the concept of tradition with the term invention empha- sizes the facticity and strategy of many claims of continuity with the past (ibid.: 2). The invention of tradition serves ideological purposes, distinguish- ing one group and its claims of authentic identity from another. Following this, the claim that something is traditional has often been used politically to establish claims of authenticity by virtue of repeated and uninterrupted historical practice. This has been undertaken more or less intentionally. As Nicholas Thomas (1992: 227) notes, "Tradition is not just a burden that must be carried, but also a thing that can be acted upon or deployed to diverse ends." This somewhat suspicious approach to tradition is based on hierar- chical binaries, such as real/invented, authentic/unauthentic, unchanged/ re-created, continuous/interrupted, old/new, true/false, legitimate/ille- gitimate, inherited/constructed, self-conscious/unself-conscious, and folk/ modern. These binaries have the effect of silencing or disregarding some voices or "storytellers" in favor of more "credible" or "nonfictional" ones. The binary approach to tradition inherent in invented tradition was criti- cized most notably by Richard Handler and Jocelyn Linnekin (1984: 287), who argued that tradition is neither "genuine" nor "spurious" but, by defini- tion, an invention. That is, the process by which something becomes under- stood as a tradition is sui generis, one of interpretation or cultural construc- tion: "To refer to the past, to take account of or interpret it, implies that one is located in the present, that one is distanced or apart from the object recon- structed. . . . We must [therefore] understand tradition as a symbolic process that both presupposes past symbolisms and creatively reinterprets them." From this perspective, distinguishing one type of tradition from another, or seeking to define which elements of a tradition are more or less invented than others, is misguided.</page><page sequence="5">Mounted Bullfighting 527 Although Handler and Linnekin effectively mooted the debate around invented tradition by positing that tradition is by definition a cultural inven- tion, the idea of invented tradition formed the basis for much sociohistori- cal and anthropological research in the late twentieth century. The politi- cal implications of invented traditions were identified in various spheres and scrutinized for their particular agendas.3 The widespread application of invented tradition to sociohistorical explorations has led to nuanced con- ceptual developments that are largely semantic, including the "reinvention" (Cuevas and Schaeffer 2006), "inversion" (Thomas 1992), and "revival" (Forte 2000) of tradition. As a result, invented tradition is considered "by now a rather tired, but still much used, concept in cultural history writing" (Koshar 2004: 129). Barbara A. Misztal (2003: 56) categorizes Hobsbawm and Ranger's invented-traditions approach as a "presentisi memory approach" character- ized by its study of "the institutionalization of 'remembrance' within national ritual and educational systems. Such investigations show how nationalist movements create a master commemorative narrative that highlights their members' common past and legitimizes their aspiration for a shared identity." In this article, I am interested in a more bottom-up approach to invented tradition that focuses on how individuals understand, invent, and transmit traditions through narrative. In doing so, I examine how two dominant nar- ratives of tradition of mounted bullfighting center on three key periods or "chapters."4 I propose that a focus on narratives of tradition emphasizes the existence of multiple, overlapping, mutually informing, and contradictory narratives that can be valued on equal terms and understood through their unique and dynamic sociocultural and politicohistorical contexts. The idea of narrative has been discussed alongside that of invented tra- dition by authors like Robert C. Ulin (1995) and, more recently, Donncha Kavanagh et al. (2008: 273). The latter use the framework of historical nar- ratives to consider the relationships among Irish working-class culture, local dances, and the Riverdance phenomenon. They find that these relation- ships are "deeply immersed in ... historical narratives about national iden- tity." Likewise, Ulin (1995: 526) illustrates the process of the "invention of winegrowing discourse and knowledge" that constructs a link between cur- rent and past winegrowing practices in the southwest of France. Ulin (ibid.) touches on ideas of narrative that imply power differentials and positions, such as storyteller and audience, concluding that "not all discourses of an</page><page sequence="6">528 Social Science History imagined and relativized past have an equal chance of being advanced and recognized as authoritative." At this point it is necessary to be reminded that narratives should be considered in their social and cultural contexts. As Ulin (ibid.: 520) remarks about the invention of tradition, "social constraints such as class and gender limit not only what is invented but also who does the inventing." These com- ments echo critiques of Clifford Geertz's (1973: 5) canonical description of the relationship between individuals and culture, where he asserts that "man is an animal suspended in webs of significance he himself has spun." Geertz saw those webs as a metaphor for culture and considered that they were spun with meaning to which research should be directed.5 However, as others have pointed out, "few do the actual spinning while the majority is simply caught" (Haukelid 2008: 415). Likewise, narratives of tradition are told by particular people, in particular positions, and for particular purposes. Not everyone gets caught in those narratives. Some ignore them, others distrust them, and others still attribute their own spin. Moreover, some webs pull on threads from others. For example, the narrative of tradition of rejoneo is inseparable from its counterpart, the footed bullfight. The story of the former is hardly, if ever, told without reference to the latter. They intersect at the beginning of the eighteenth century, when the "disappearance" of mounted bullfighting is linked to the "appearance" of footed bullfighting. As such, rejoneo is based on a grand narrative arising from the intersection of two specific narratives. Interestingly, the horse is a constant character in the various narratives of mounted bullfighting. Analyses of its social construction and transforma- tion in different "chapters" provide one specific means of understanding the invention oí rejoneo tradition (e.g., Thompson 2007a). The act of recalling the past needs to make sense in an ongoing present. "Hence, memory, as the knowing ordering or the narrative organization of the past, observes rules and conventions of narrative. For example, successful narratives about the past must have a beginning and an end, an interesting storyline and impressive heroes" (Misztal 2003: 10). Likewise, the narratives of footed and mounted bullfighting have plots, chapters, villains, and heroes. These story lines are "adapted for the stage" during bullfights. In the case of mounted bullfighting, the heroes might be seen as villains from "Old Spain" with enduring upper-class symbolism, or they might be seen as heroes of a new order where participation in "elite" activities is not restricted by socio-</page><page sequence="7">Mounted Bullfighting 529 economic class status. The case study of mounted bullfighting in Spain provides an ethnographic example of how traditions are invented through narratives and relate to periods of intense social, cultural, and political trans- formation such as that which characterizes Spain. Rejoneo: Mounted Bullfighting Before I use mounted bullfighting as a case study to illustrate how tradi- tions are invented through narratives, it is necessary to provide an overview of mounted bullfighting and its sociohistorical construction. This is impor- tant for two reasons: first, because footed bullfighting has received the lion's share of popular and academic attention, and second, because it is necessary to understand how the sociohistorical construction of mounted bullfighting articulates class and draws from twin narratives that intersect one another and the history of footed bullfighting. Rejoneo is the act of bullfighting from horseback. It is practiced in Mexico, Portugal, France, Colombia, and California (based on the Portu- guese "bloodless" version). In Spain, mounted bullfighting is associated with a southern, Andalusian identity. This is primarily for aesthetic reasons, as mounted bullfighters use clothing, saddlery, and types of horses that reflect those of the vaqueros or "cowboys" who manage fighting bulls from horse- back on vast bull-breeding ranches in Andalusia. The Andalusian construc- tion of rejoneo also derives from the success and dominance of rejoneadores from the south, such as the Peralta brothers (Seville Province) and three gen- erations of the Domecq family (Cádiz Province).6 Following from the term corrida, referring to the bullfight in general, rejoneo is also known as a corrida de rejones, distinguishing it from the footed bullfight, the corrida de toros. Riders are known generically as rejoneadores, and women mounted bullfight- ers are called rejoneadoras. A rejoneador combines his or her skills as a horse rider with those of a torero (bullfighter) to maneuver his or her horse close enough to the bull to spear it with an array of barbs called rejones and banderillas. Each corrida starts with the paseíllo (a procession of performers).7 The rejoneadores then perform an equestrian display based on various alta escuela* (high school) movements and sometimes circo (circus) tricks, such as sitting the horses on their rumps or making them bow. This equestrian display, peculiar to the corrida de rejones, contributes to the perception of rejoneo as an espectáculo</page><page sequence="8">530 Social Science History (spectacle), in contrast to the corrida on foot. This is fueled by the domi- nant belief among aficionados that footed bullfighting is the most authentic, "serious," and risky form of bullfighting. This view is reinforced by a higher contingent of women and families in the audience of mounted bullfight- ing, owing to the widespread belief that it is easier for a woman to become a mounted bullfighter than a footed bullfighter. As with the corrida de toros, the corrida de rejones comprises three tercios ("thirds": acts, phases, or stages).9 In general, each successive tercio is char- acterized by a shorter rejon and a specific horse selected and purpose-trained for that phase. As the corrida progresses and the rejones shorten, the horses come closer to the bull. The third tercio ends with the death of the bull and is in fact known as the tercio de muerte {tercio of death). The rejoneador takes part in every tercio of the corrida de rejones. The history of bullfighting in Spain positions rejoneo in a rise-fall-return or "great comeback" plot often articulated through the binaries of footed/ mounted bullfighting and lower/upper class. This historical model posits that lancing bulls from horseback was the original form of bullfighting; that it was practiced by the upper class with footed servants who used their jackets to distract bulls from their mounted lords; that its practice peaked in the seventeenth century before declining from 1700, when Felipe V ascended the Spanish throne; and that "modern" or footed bullfighting emerged from the lower classes through the footed servants to the earlier lancers. These "chapters" in the history of mounted bullfighting are articulated in two dominant narratives linking current mounted bullfighting to the past. One of these situates the origins of contemporary mounted bullfighting in mounted lancing in the courts of seventeenth-century nobles, while the other situates those origins in the Andalusian countryside during the eighteenth and nine- teenth centuries. A composite grand narrative effortlessly combines both of these dominant narratives into one, resulting in an understanding of rejoneo as "the newest but also the oldest." The modern or footed bullfight is commonly interpreted as a triumph of lower class over upper class, where the picador is considered a replacement for the "previous" mounted lancer, leading some to regard the picador as a representative of the upper class (e.g., Douglass 1984; Arratia 1988; Mac- Clancy 1996). Lancing bulls from horseback is thought to have disappeared from the plaza (bullring) for 200 years until it reappeared in the 1920s, with the aesthetics of an Andalusian cowboy instead of a lancing noble. Thus, the</page><page sequence="9">Mounted Bullfighting 531 history of rejoneo is frequently defined through a rise in practice that peaked in the seventeenth century, a fall beginning in the eighteenth century, and then another "rise" in the early twentieth century that has been variously articulated as a return, rebirth, rehabilitation, revival, or resuscitation. Rejo- neo in its current form, based on the three phases that typify "modern bull- fighting," has appeared in formal bullfights since the 1920s, immediately prior to the Spanish civil war. As noted above, the history of rejoneo is typically discussed in the lit- erature as a background to the development of the footed bullfight, which has attracted substantially more attention (e.g., Mitchell 1991; Marvin 1994; Douglass 1997; Pink 1997). The dominance of research on the footed bull- fight has the potential to present a partial understanding of bullfighting in Spain, especially where mounted bullfighting is considered the purview of the upper classes. In addition, there has been some blurring of the picador and the rejoneador (the main equestrian figures of the footed and mounted bullfight, respectively), especially in terms of the class associations noted above (see, e.g., Douglass 1984; Arratia 1988; MacClancy 1996). To redress these inconsistencies, this article provides a detailed overview of the social history of rejoneo . The Seventeenth Century: The Century of Rejoneo Lancing bulls from horseback in Spain is considered to have peaked in the seventeenth century. This period is commonly referred to as the siglo del rejo- neo (century oí rejoneo) and bullfighting at that time as the corrida caballeresca (the knightly or chivalric corrida). "In these early days bullfighting on horse- back was only for gentlemen" (Blake 1991: 48). Indeed, the Spanish word caballero, "knight," also refers both to a horse rider and to a gentleman, two figures who embody essential qualities of chivalry.10 Lancing bulls from horseback was primarily an elitist activity. Bulls were lanced from horseback for military training but also as entertainment, espe- cially at royal celebrations.11 As Joaquín de la Puente (1997: 112) describes, "Since time immemorial, mounted knights have lanced bulls in Spain, thus regaling the plebeyan [sic] spectators with the image of their unattainable nobility."12 As such, mounted bullfighting is historically associated with the Spanish upper classes: nobles and royals.</page><page sequence="10">532 Social Science History The peak of the corrida caballeresca in the seventeenth century was fol- lowed by a steep decline in popularity and practice, lasting two centuries (at least as a formal event/spectacle). I now discuss some of the reasons for this decline, how mounted bullfighting continued to develop away from the plaza, and the conditions surrounding the invention of the mounted bullfight in the early twentieth century. In so doing, I trace a narrative of mounted bullfight- ing based on three discrete chapters. However, I also isolate two main narra- tives on which the grand narrative is based and which intersect one another as well as footed bullfighting. Moreover, I challenge the discreteness with which those three chapters are commonly presented, thereby offering alter- native interpretations. The following historical overview details the chapters that comprise the narratives of rejoneo tradition. The Eighteenth Century: The Decline of Mounted Lancing and the Formalization of Modern Footed Bullfighting The decline in the practice of the corridas caballerescas coincides with the end of the Hapsburg reign. Carlos II died in 1700 without leaving an heir to the Spanish throne. Rule passed to the Duke of Anjou, a grandson of Louis IV, who became Felipe V and began Bourbon rule in Spain. Felipe V found the celebrations that involved killing bulls distasteful, and those members of the aristocracy who wished to keep favor at court withdrew from the plaza (Marvin 1994: 58-59). He is therefore held accountable for the abandonment of the corridas caballerescas (see, e.g., Douglass 1984: 245; Shubert 1999: 7).13 Two other interrelated factors also contributed to the decline of mounted bullfighting from the eighteenth century: riding style and class. Before Felipe V ascended the Spanish throne, the longer lance had been replaced by the shorter rejon to complement finer and more agile breeds of horses, such as the Barb, Arab, and Pura Raza Española ("Pure Spanish Race," an indige- nous Spanish horse). The style of riding most suited to placing the rejon and riding these agile horses was a la jineta, which enabled the rider to maintain balance while carrying out spins, stops, and turns at speed.14 Philip V pre- ferred the contrasting riding style of a la brida (Marvin 1994: 59), which was more suited to forward charges en masse and made the practice of rejoneo more difficult and risky.15 A compounding factor to the downfall of the corrida caballeresca relates</page><page sequence="11">Mounted Bullfighting 533 to class. The upper class was losing its monopoly over the plaza before Felipe V took the throne: "Although exact and detailed information is lack- ing, it seems certain that from the end of the sixteenth century or early years of the seventeenth onwards important changes occurred in the fiestas tauri- nas associated with the nobility, which were to transform the nature of the events" (ibid.: 57). Namely, paid footed bullfighters from the general public appropriated the plaza and the role of bullfighter. This is often referred to as the invasión del plebeyismo (invasion of commoners) or the invasión del ruedo por el pueblo (invasion of the ring by the people) (see, e.g., Abarquero Durango 1984: 87). Hence Felipe V's role in the downfall of mounted bullfighting in the eighteenth century needs to be contextualized within broader trends in riding style and a milieu of social transformation surrounding the bullfight. Regardless of who or what was responsible for the decline of mounted lancing of bulls in Spanish plazas, the practice did not cease overnight. Don Diego Torres de Villaroel of Salamanca drafted the rules of rejoneo in 1726 (ibid.), almost three decades into Felipe V's reign. Rejoneo was "abolished" in 1775, after it had begun to disappear around 1770 (ibid.: 119). It is there- fore likely that rejoneo was practiced for an additional half century after Felipe V came to the throne. In fact, lancing bulls from horseback never ceased entirely, thanks to its role in aristocratic celebrations. These ambiguities suggest that footed bullfighting and mounted bull- fighting were not mutually exclusive, nor was the latter a replacement for the former. In association with the concurrence of the two forms of bullfighting, there are significant geographic and regional differences. For example: "Not only did 'plebeians' or 'lackeys' have a role in the aristocratic bullfight, but in Northern Spain professionals who fought on foot existed by the seven- teenth century. . . . Rather than an offshoot of the aristocratic spectacle, the modern bullfight was the product of two long-standing, parallel develop- ments with different geographical centers" (Shubert 1999: 9). Thus, not only are footed and mounted lancing historically inclusive, but the footed bull- fight was more strongly associated with northern Spain, while mounted bull- fighting was more particular to Andalusia, southern Spain. Indeed, rejoneo is still synonymous with an Andalusian identity. An Andalusian equestrian aes- thetic referred to as doma vaquera (cowboy riding) is central to the invention of rejoneo. In addition to the abandonment of mounted lancing, the eighteenth cen- tury is synonymous with the birth of the "modern bullfight," characterized</page><page sequence="12">534 Social Science History by footed bullfighting and its organization into three distinct tercios}** It is formally attributed to one man (or "hero"), Francisco Romero (ibid.: 54), but is generally considered to have been initiated by the footed assistants to the mounted lancers, who did not cease their involvement with the bullfight when it was abandoned by the caballeros en plaza. These footmen were skilled at luring the bull away from a rider in danger, leading to the theory that the modern bullfighter's cape originated from the footed assistants' practice of shaking their jackets to distract the bull (Williams 2000: 146). However, while footed bullfighting was formalized in the space of the plaza, Andalu- sians were also accustomed to facing bulls from foot in the contexts of local "bull games" and traditions (Mitchell 1991: 50-51).17 The idea of the modern footed bullfight being developed in the eigh- teenth century to supersede the "previous" practice of lancing bulls from horseback in the plaza has contributed to the construction of mounted bull- fighting as upper-class and footed bullfighting as lower-class. While horse riding is frequently perceived as a pursuit of the leisured classes, the class distinction between mounted and footed bullfighting is not due to the involvement of the horse in the former, especially as both forms of bullfight- ing include a mounted figure. In the footed bullfight, this is the mounted picador in the first tercio, who prepares the bull for the torero (bullfighter on foot) by severing the muscles that the bull uses to lift its head. The crowd's dislike of the picador (Arratia 1988: 288) has been explained by theorizing the picador as a vestige of the upper-class lancer (Douglass 1984: 245). This theory is facilitated by a unilinear model of the bullfight, which presupposes an evolution of the picador from the mounted lancer (or at the very least con- siders the picador a replacement mounted figure).18 However, as I describe in detail elsewhere (Thompson forthcoming), the picador and the rejoneador participate in the bullfight in different ways, with contrasting roles, aesthet- ics, human-horse relations, and interpretations. The picador appears in the first tercio of the footed bullfight to assist the footed bullfighter by using the horse basically as a target, while the mounted bullfighter features throughout all three tercios in partnership with skilled horses akin to equine bullfighters. While both forms of bullfighting involve a horse (and a mounted figure), that is where the similarities end. The decline of rejoneo in the eighteenth century is a key chapter in its narrative as the oldest and newest form of bullfighting in Spain. From a uni- linear perspective, mounted lancing predates footed bullfighting, which in</page><page sequence="13">Mounted Bullfighting 535 turn is postdated by rejoneo. In the "lancing chapter," rejoneo suffers at the hands of a disinterested monarch. The totality of this disappearance has been questioned above. However, without its construction as no less than a tragic blow, the triumphant return of mounted bullfighting in the twentieth cen- tury could not be such a powerful and meaningful comeback or narrative device (for rejoneadores and their fans). The critical aesthetics behind this successful comeback are credited to the two centuries during which mounted lancing was all but absent from the public plaza. Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries: A Strategic Country Retreat for Mounted Lancing Mounted lancers in the eighteenth century may have been down, but they were not out. Their participation in the bullfight is considered to have been transformed through a geographic shift from the plaza to the countryside (or from center stage to backstage). During this transformation, elites retained control over the bullfight through landownership: According to a census taken in '191 - aX the very end of the "revolution- ary" inception of the modern corrida - the Spanish nobility owned 15 cities, 267 towns, 400 game preserves, 430 despoblados, or uninhabited regions, 612 farms, 671 villages, and 2,286 hamlets. The three percent of Spaniards who occupied the top of the social pyramid possessed some- thing like 97 percent of the Iberian Peninsula. There was, therefore, no "collapse" of the aristocracy in eighteenth-century Spain, certainly not in the all-important economic terrain. (Mitchell 1991: 85) Landownership was significant in relation to the type and number of live- stock it could sustain, such as bulls. As such, the nobility owned the means of bullfight production. Following Pedro Romero de Solís (1983), Mitchell (1991: 86) suggests that the abandonment of bullfighting by the upper class was a "kind of strategic retreat." This was facilitated by landownership but made meaningful through the particular human-animal relations with bulls and horses that it facilitated: Those sectors of the nobility whose status and power were based on their control of the rural land mass (and the rural masses on the land) would remain partial to equestrian and taurine traditions, bide their time, and</page><page sequence="14">536 Social Science History eventually secure for themselves a crucial role in the newly plebeianized corrida de toros. Though no longer the protagonists of the bullfight, the agrarian-based nobility would reassert themselves in three ways: (1) by constructing and managing the new public buildings known as bullrings; (2) by using their influence to promote and protect the first great bull- fighters; and, above all, (3) by breeding the kind of bull that the new bullfighters and their fans required for spectacles, (ibid.) Mitchell's third point highlights the intersection of human-animal rela- tions, identity, and class. For example, bull ownership played a distinctive role in the status and prestige of the upper class by enabling its control of the bloodlines of the toro bravo (the bull selectively bred for the corrida) at a time when bull studs were more important than bullfighters (ibid.: 89). In this sense, the aristocracy participated in the modern corrida by animal proxy. Similarly, bulls were subject to the same patterns of selection used to ensure that land remained in privileged families (namely, strategic marriages and consanguinity) and that bloodlines retained their nobility (ibid.: 88).19 Thus the ideology of a closed class-based system of human reproduction was applied to the selective breeding of toros bravos. In this way, the Span- ish nobility left its anthropomorphic mark on the bull.20 This constitutes an example of human-animal boundary crossing contextualized through, and cocreative of, class. Whereas Timothy Mitchell (ibid.: 86) considers the transformation of the nobility from bull lancers to breeders a "strategic retreat," José María de Cossío (2000, 2: 60, 62) describes rejoneo as taking rural "refuge," espe- cially in the lower Guadalquivir area of Andalusia. As Ann Hyland (1998: 193) notes, "Cattle raised in Seville and Cádiz provinces were longhorned and unruly, and the only way they could be managed was from horseback."21 This requirement contributed to the development of an equestrian discipline of riding referred to as doma vaquera and an aesthetic described as campero Andaluz or estilo campero (both meaning Andalusian country style). Some rejoneadores identify the strategic retreat of rejoneo in the eigh- teenth century as the origin of mounted bullfighting, thereby compart- mentalizing courtly lancing from mounted bullfighting and bracketing that chapter from the narrative of invented rejoneo tradition. As one rejonea- dor explained in an interview: "Rejoneo has its roots in the land, the vaquera aspect of sorting out bulls and cows whilst escaping them with the horse. The bull charges and you run; if the bull stops, you stop and then you start</page><page sequence="15">Mounted Bullfighting 537 again, again the bull charges and you run again. This practice was gradually adopted in the plazas?" This particular rejoneador constructed the origins of rejoneo in the practice of doma vaquera in the countryside, not the courts of nobles. Another rejoneador shared with me this view that rejoneo arose from the Andalusian countryside: Rejoneo emerges from working with the toro bravo in the field. When the bull moved the man had to defend himself or find skills whilst riding the horse to be able to win the fight [pelea] with the bull out there in the country, to pen the bull, take it to the estate, or if the bull escaped, they had to go out on horseback and look for it. The bull defended itself, began to charge and they had to be on horseback because the work in the field was carried out on horseback and there was no other way. . . . Rejo- neo originated right there because the bull defended itself out in the field and the man on horseback had to catch it and take it to the homestead while it kept on charging. That's where rejoneo began. When the bull charged, the man defended himself from horseback by turning around it, to the left and the right. He began to fight [pelear] with the bull until he and his horse could move it wherever they wanted. The montura vaquera (cowboy saddlery), mosquero (fly veil brow band made of leather or horsehair arranged into ornate tassels), garrocha (long pole used to direct livestock), jaca (a working horse with short tail, mane, and forelock and usually castrated), movimientos (movements; quick turns and stops with little to no trot), and traje corto (short suit or country suit)22 constitute the aesthetic of the Andalusian vaquero, whose work is bound intimately with the toro bravo and the Andalusian countryside. Both the rejoneador and the vaquero use these skills and aesthetics as they maneuver their horses peril- ously close to the bull while avoiding injury. This is the aesthetic characteriz- ing rejoneóos formalization in the plaza in the 1920s, which contrasts with the aesthetics of the corrida caballeresca. In this sense, rejoneo is the newest form of bullfighting. Drawing from a narrative of courtly lancing, however, rejoneo is the oldest. This can be under- stood through the multiple narratives of tradition that underpin the socio- historical construction of rejoneo. In this regard, the history oí rejoneo could be shelved as a "choose your own adventure," where the roles of author and reader are collapsed and where pivotal moments, chapters, and characters are sorted into common, purpose-serving plots.</page><page sequence="16">538 Social Science History I have so far discussed some rapid transformations to bullfighting prior to the twentieth century, including changes to the Spanish throne, fashions in riding style, the involvement of different classes in the bullfight by more or less visible means (such as in public plazas or private ranches), different human-animal relations, and selective breeding of bulls. These changes dis- tinguish the lancing chapter in the narrative of rejoneo tradition from the chapter detailing its strategic retreat in the Andalusian countryside. These chapters characterize (and are characterized by) the archetypal themes of sta- bility, challenge, defeat, strategy, and adaptation (thereby setting the scene for a "comeback"). Together, they form the narratives of tradition that con- struct the "abandonment" of the corridas caballerescas and the "invention" of the modern footed bullfight (which can also be considered an invented tra- dition with selective amnesia of prior footed bullfighting practices). I now turn to a consideration of the formalization of mounted bullfighting in the early twentieth century in the framework of the modern bullfight with three tercios. This is essentially the chapter of contemporary rejoneo, perceived by some as a revival of mounted lancing (namely, fans of the footed bullfight as well as Douglass 1984; Arratia 1988; MacClancy 1996) and by others as a ver- sion of doma vaquera (namely, fans of the mounted bullfight as well as de Cos- sio 2000, 2: 62). This chapter is crucial to the narrative of rejoneo tradition as the oldest and the newest. The Twentieth Century: The Golden Age of Rejoneo The formalization of lancing from horseback in the plaza in the early twen- tieth century as rejoneo is credited to Antonio Cañero Baena. He was born in the Andalusian province of Córdoba and followed his father to become both a lieutenant colonel in the Spanish military and a professor of equitation.23 Cañero rode in the estilo campero described above. He performed as a bull- fighter from foot from 1912 to 1917 (Jiménez Benítez 1994: 90) but in 1923 started fighting bulls from horseback "to rehabilitate the bullfight where the horse features in all three phases" (Abarquero Durango 1984: 93). Accord- ing to R. Abarquero Durango (ibid.: 106-7), Cañero was offended by the picador's use of the horse as a soporte ortopedico (orthopedic support), where the horse is little more than a stationary target for the charging bull. In this sense, the invention of rejoneo is a transformation and invention of the horse</page><page sequence="17">Mounted Bullfighting 539 Figure 1 Vaqueros in El Rocío, Huelva Province, in Andalusia, wearing the traje del campo and using the montura vaquera: a distinctly Andalusian aesthetic. Note the garrochas they carry to assist with herding. in the Spanish bullfight that highlights two contrasting discourses around the role of the horse in the footed and mounted bullfights. Cañero retired from the plaza in 1936, when civil war erupted and he was required to fight in the national army (Elrejoneo.com 2001-2010a).24 His formal (re)introduction of rejoneo in the early twentieth century marks what is understood as the sigio de oro or the "golden age" of rejoneo (more lit- erally the "golden century"). The most emphasized aspect of Cañero's (re) introduction of mounted bullfighting is his use of the clothing, saddlery, and riding style readily identifiable as Andalusian. Moreover, he introduced the type of horse that was synonymous with that identity and that contrasted the aesthetics of the picador's horse in the footed bullfight. When Cañero started facing bulls from horseback, he did so with the identity of a vaquero Andaluz (Andalusian cowboy) (see figures 1-2). This aesthetic incorporating horse, rider, and saddlery was crucial to the invention of rejoneo in that it created an association with a distinct Andalusian vaquero identity. "The cowboy saddle and the short suit, the boots and the chaps advised that this was more about the exploits of the pastures than of courtly exercises. The garrochas that he</page><page sequence="18">540 Social Science History Figure 2 The rider on the left illustrates the Andalusian aesthetic of mounted bull- fighting, which contrasts with the Portuguese style, illustrated by the rider on the right. held to drove bulls had the style of the estate more than the refinement of the picadero [riding school]" (de Cossío 2000, 2: 60). The aesthetics of contemporary rejoneo convey an identity more famil- iar to Andalusians than that of the nobles of the seventeenth century. While associations with the courts of nobles provide historical prestige for rejoneo and rejoneadores as the original form of bullfighting, links to the countryside support an Andalusian regional identity tied to the agricultural sector. Cañero's translation of an estilo campero in the plaza was understood as a fresh breath of country air (a literal resuscitation). The bulls during his time were considered larger and more "wild" than those of today and did not have their horns "tipped" (as they are for contemporary corridas de rejones).25 Cañero rode his horses in a "rough and ready" manner and became famous for jumping a mare called Tordilla (the grayish one)26 over dying bulls (Abar- quero Durango 1984: 79, 121), "which proved nothing, technically, but had its effect" in producing a "vogue" in rejoneo (Fifield 1978: 107). This "trick" can still be seen in corridas de rejones today.27 By translating a particular Andalusian and rural equestrian aesthetic into the plaza. Cañero developed a style of mounted bullfighting that was</page><page sequence="19">Mounted Bullfighting 541 distinctly toreo a caballo Andaluz (mounted bullfighting Andalusian style). His version of rejoneo was essentially a performance of the country. In con- trast to Garry Marvin's (2000: 108) analysis of English foxhunting as a "rural performative event" in a rural environment, rejoneo can be interpreted as a performance of the rural in urban and periurban areas.28 If contemporary rejoneo had to be reduced to a binary opposition, that of an urban-rural dis- tinction would be more appropriate than one of upper and lower class. Cañero's rural Andalusian aesthetic aided a broader public acceptance of rejoneo. As Hobsbawm (1995a [1983]: 263) notes, "conscious invention succeeded mainly in proportion to its success in broadcasting on a wave- length to which the public was ready to tune in." In rejoneo this wavelength was aesthetic. While, for many, rejoneadores symbolize the privileged classes due to the required financial commitment together with the involvement of some famous elite rejoneo dynasties, the clothing of rejoneadores nevertheless broadcasts a familiar Andalusian identity. This is illustrated by the polysemy of the rejoneadoras hat, as Julian A. Pitt-Rivers (1971 [1954]: 69) observed last century and which applied at the time of my own fieldwork: The sombrero de ala ancha, or wide-brimmed hat, is an article both of fes- tive and also working-dress. It bears a particular association with ganado (livestock) and is always worn with the short jacket and tight trousers of cattle herdsmen. But [footed] bullfighters wear it in this way for charity fights out of season. ... it is worn by many farmers also, though agricul- tural labourers tend to wear berets or soft hats instead. The landowner also wears it if he goes into the country, particularly if he goes on horse- back ... on festive occasions by poor people as part of their smart dress, and it is also worn by the sophisticated at fairs and bullfights. The costume worn by rejoneadores, of which the sombrero de ala ancha is par- ticularly symbolic, broadcasts a recognizable, "knowable," and "doable" aes- thetic of Andalusian identity.29 The vaquero aesthetics of rejoneo create a particular style or tone for the chapter of rejoneo* s (reappearance. As noted above in relation to the polysemy of the rejoneador^ hat, this style is likely to be interpreted as a symbol of the Andalusian countryside and regional iden- tity. In terms of class, it may be interpreted as symbolic of the working class or more privileged landowners. As such, a narrative framework allows for multiple story lines in, as well as multiple readings of, mounted bullfighting. Hobsbawm (1995b [1983]: 4) observes that the process of inventing tra-</page><page sequence="20">542 Social Science History dition is "most clearly exemplified where a 'tradition' is deliberately invented and constructed by a single initiator." That Cañero is credited with the appearance of rejoneo in the plazas of the twentieth century suggests that rejoneo is an invented tradition in Hobsbawm's terms (a reverse process can be identified in the link between Felipe V and the "fall" of the corrida caballe- resca tradition).30 The importance of a single initiator to the invented tra- dition theory can also be considered through narrative terminology as the "hero" (or a villain in relation to Felipe V) in the narrative of rejoneo tradi- tion or at least the main character. In the present example, Cañero becomes the heroic figure in the chapter of the (re)appearance of rejoneo. His hero- ism derives in part from rejoneo being at that time in contrast to the "every- day life" of footed bullfighting (see Featherstone 1992). At the same time, Cañero "saved" the "horse" from a role in the footed bullfight as an expend- able target and invented a role for the horse as a skilled aesthetic athlete that attracted a fan base akin to that of the rider.31 He created a forum in which riders could demonstrate their vaquero, equestrian, and bullfighting skills as well as display the talents of their horses. For these acts of heroism, Cañero is embraced as the father of rejoneo. Identifying common narrative elements such as the "hero" emphasizes the narrative process through which traditions are invented and the multiple story lines and interpretations available to storytellers, retellers, and audi- ences. For instance, Felipe V is the villain in the story line of mounted lanc- ing falling from grace, but he might also be perceived as an accidental hero in the aesthetic (re)construction of contemporary rejoneo by precipitating rejo- neo's strategic country retreat. Without that retreat, the aesthetics of rejo- neo would probably resemble the Portuguese caveleiro (rider), who wears an ornate feathered, ribboned, and velveted costume dating back to European salons of the eighteenth century, when mounted bullfighting continued in Portugal, unaffected by the preferences of Spain's Bourbon monarchy (see figure 2). Simultaneously, for aficionados of the footed bullfight, Felipe V is a hero who freed the lower classes from assisting their mounted lords so that they could develop an autonomous form of footed bullfighting, refined by another hero, Romero. Each story line or narrative therefore constructs and empha- sizes heroes, villains, and characters for different ideological purposes. My research found that rejoneadores and their aficionados were most likely to con- struct the origins of rejoneo in the vaquero work required of southern bull</page><page sequence="21">Mounted Bullfighting 543 ranches, thus downplaying upper-class associations. Aficionados of footed bullfighting, however, were more likely to emphasize the noble origins of rejoneo in courtly pursuits, thereby exaggerating class distinctions between mounted and footed bullfighting. These different narratives are not mutually exclusive. For example, literature commonly credits Cañero with the inven- tion of rejoneo while linking the origins of rejoneo to the elitist nobles of the seventeenth century. This is another manifestation of rejoneo as the oldest and the newest form of bullfighting. In the narratives of tradition of rejoneo, the hero Cañero is joined by other characters, each of whom plays a role in the development of the story line and demonstrates heroic acts in his own way. After the Spanish civil war, the equestrian movements in rejoneo were refined by the Jerezano Alvaro Domecq y Diez. Domecq y Diez started his career in 1934 at the suggestion of a priest to raise money for charity. He retired from officiai bullfighting in 1950 and was mayor of Jerez from 1952 until 1957, when he created the pres- tigious bull-breeding ranch Torrestrella. Domecq y Diez undoubtedly con- tributed to the upper-class stereotype of rejoneo; he represented the landed gentry, held a political position, and was frequently referred to by the hon- orific Don?1 His son "Alvarito" (little Alvaro) and his son-in-law were a rejo- neadores, as are three of his grandsons. Domecq y Diez invented the popular quiebro (a fake-right-go-left move to place a banderilla) and added more clas- sical dressage and alta escuela movements to the corrida de rejones. Domecq y Diez shares military ties with Cañero through being an army pilot. John Corbin (1999: 17) notes a possible connection between rejoneadores or, more specifically, the perception of rejoneadores and the Spanish civil war through an association between "class and militarism": "The aristocratic and military origins of rejoneo are consonant with the dominance of the Spanish officer corps by families of wealth and aristocratic connections. Many of the right-wing officers who organized and led the military conspiracy against the Republic were of this class, though, it should be said, not Franco himself." Domecq y Diez converted rejoneo "into an authentic bullfighting ballet, imi- tating the suertes [passes] of footed bullfighting wherever possible" (Domecq Romero et al. 1991: n.p.). He is renowned for his elegance and effortlessness as a rider and is credited with refining Cañero's style, something that con- tinued throughout the sigio de oro.33 The two contrasting stylistic approaches to mounted bullfighting can be summarized with the categories of valiente (valiant) and artista (artistic) that fans of the mounted bullfight use to distin-</page><page sequence="22">544 Social Science History guish types of bullfighters. Domecq y Diez's artista style might be seen as an attempt by the landed gentry to assert symbolically a more upper-class con- struction of mounted bullfighting over Cañero's working-class valiente style. This struggle of style is ongoing. Both rejoneadores valientes and artistas can be identified in bullrings today. The "authenticity" of Domecq y Diez's bullfighting ballet relates to how he appropriated features of the footed bullfight. For example, he used his horse as a torero uses a cape.34 He also shared with footed toreros the tripar- tite mantra that governs their interaction with the bull (and provides cate- gories for qualitative evaluation of a bullfighter): parar, templar, mandar (stop the bull, regulate its movements, and command it). While the order of these three elements is debated, they have been described as follows in the form of a monologue from the torero to the bull: "Stop there, come here and then wait over there for me to give you another rejón" (as Abarquero Durango [1984: 98] describes "Don" Alvaro's approach). It is along these lines that rejoneo aficionados distinguish between the verb rejonear as the act of using a rejon and the more prestigious torear a caballo or toreo ecuestre (specifically "mounted bullfighting," where the term for bullfighting, torear, is specific to the footed version).35 For example: Bullfighting [el toreo] from horseback is based on bullfighting from foot. That has always been the objective. . . . Facing the bull de frente (front- on) is to stop, center the bull and once it's fixed in this position, and the bull centered and fixed on you, you go straight toward it. It is not just about positioning yourself front-on, you have to be moving for- wards towards the bull. When you get close enough that the bull starts to charge, then you give it a pass with the muleta [using the horse as a cape], but always face-to-face and with the horse's chest in front of the bull, {rejoneador to author)36 This comment demonstrates how rejoneadores draw from the more esteemed and "authentic" tradition of footed bullfighting. It is an example of the inter- section (or interception) of ideology and philosophies in the narratives of footed and mounted bullfighting traditions. Contemporary rejoneadores look to the philosophy of the modern footed bullfight to claim the status of a "legitimate" form of bullfighting and to a period of courtly lancing preceding the eighteenth century to claim prestige</page><page sequence="23">Mounted Bullfighting 545 as the original form of bullfighting. This suggests that rejoneo is an invented tradition in Hobsbawm's terms. That is, rejoneo, as manifest in the plazas of Andalusia fairly recently, in the 1920s, is constructed as the oldest bull- fighting tradition because of a "manufactured" sense of historical continuity from courtly lancing that peaked at the end of the seventeenth century. A consideration of the role of narratives in the invention of rejoneo provides an understanding of the process through which traditions are invented through narratives. From that point of departure, rejoneo is simultaneously old and new. Its invention occurs from a bottom-up process of narratives that are told, retold, and reinterpreted by rejoneadores, their fans, and fans of the footed bullfight. As I discuss below in relation to the sociohistorical context of the formalization of rejoneo in the twentieth century, these narratives are influenced by the characteristically top-down political and economic forces that concern Hobsbawm and Ranger (1995 [1983]). The narratives of rejoneo tradition center on the following chapters: mounted lancing by nobles, which peaked in the seventeenth century; the fall of this practice in the eighteenth century, alongside the "creation" of modern footed bullfighting and the management of brave bulls from horse- back on vast ranches; and the (re)appearance of mounted lancing as rejoneo in the early twentieth century. These chapters are arranged to support two dominant narrative beginnings: one in the courts of nobles and the other in the vast bull ranches of Andalusia. Another could be written beginning with Cañero. An important side plot is the "creation" of footed bullfight- ing, which is considered to have risen from mounted bullfighting's ashes (despite a history of footed bullfighting in northern Spain noted by Adrian Shubert [1999: 9]). Narratives of the history of rejoneo tradition weave a story line freely, dynamically, and opportunistically across all of these chapters to emphasize that rejoneo offers the best of both worlds; it is "the newest but also the oldest." However, these chapters and story lines are not arbitrary. They are embedded in broader social, cultural, political, and economic changes in Spain. I now turn to a discussion of these sociopolitical developments, including changes to the constitution of the nobility and class conflict. These relate particularly to Andalusia, and many have specific relevance to Jerez de la Frontera in Cádiz Province, which is home to the Domecq and Bohórquez dynasties of rejoneadores (among others). This account suggests that where</page><page sequence="24">546 Social Science History traditions are invented through narratives, they are influenced by broader structural and material dynamics. This is the point of synthesis between the bottom-up narratives of tradition and the top-down invention of tradition. Sociohistorical Context of Narratives of Rejoneo Tradition The narratives of tradition that underpin contemporary social constructions of rejoneo are threaded through diverse social, cultural, and political milieus and intense transformations. Mounted lancing occurred at a time of elite stronghold; rejoneo^ downfall occurred during a transition from a Spanish king to a French-born one; footed bullfighting strengthened during Franco's regime; the formal appearance of rejoneo m plazas in the 1920s coincided with the end of a period of growth in nobility; and the continued development of rejoneo was supported by economic changes, which made its practice more broadly accessible and affordable. Other significant social transformations characterizing the early twenti- eth century include women's rights, increasing disposable incomes, urbani- zation, and Europeanization. These are the conditions that converged and coincided with the "invention" of rejoneo. In this section, I focus on class and landownership to continue the discussion of class constructions of rejoneo and to critically examine the stereotype of rejoneo as an elitist activity. The sociohistorical context of the invention of rejoneo relates to dynamics that Hobsbawm (1995a [1983]) identifies across Europe around the turn of the twentieth century as the broader context for the mass production of tradi- tions at that time. This illustrates the interplay of top-down forces with indi- vidual narrative constructions. During the Spanish Restoration (1875-1931), there was an expansion of the nobility: "200 titles, including 20 Dukes and 30 grandees, were created and 300 were rehabilitated. ... By 1930 there were some 1,900 titled people in the country" (Shubert 1990: 65). This expansion (a kind of "invention" of class) occurred alongside a transformation in the nature or constitution of nobility through the convergence of old and new forms (ibid.: 66). Through- out these developments, landownership remained central to class status: The nobility remained an important part of the landowning elite in lib- eral Spain but it alone did not make up that elite. The nobles were joined</page><page sequence="25">Mounted Bullfighting 547 by a new group of large landowners who emerged from the disentail- ment process and which by the early part of the twentieth century had surpassed them and come to form a distinctive agrarian elite. Even in the south, the bastion of both the nobility and the large estate, people with- out title came to own the bulk of the land and through marriage strate- gies control large areas, (ibid.: 69) Latifundism prevailed in Andalusia, with a notable stronghold in Cádiz Province: "By the middle of the nineteenth century, 58 percent of its total land area was in holdings greater than 625 acres; in some districts, as much as 96 percent of the land was in large estates. The trend toward increased consolidation of land seems to have continued throughout the late nine- teenth and early twentieth centuries" (Kaplan 1975: 49). The extent of lati- fundism in Jerez de la Frontera resulted in class conflict. "By the middle of the nineteenth century, two-thirds of the arable and pastoral land in Jerez was owned by fewer than 200 people who had an average holding of about 250 hectares" (ibid.). The gap between the rich and the poor was stark, and Andalusian anarchism is attributed to the numerous landless day laborers (ibid.). These conditions resulted in class tensions and resentment toward the landed gentry.37 Rejoneo was thus formalized during a period of rapid class transforma- tion, unrest, and a looming civil war. It continued to be formalized during Francisco Franco's dictatorship and was an established form of bullfighting at the time of Spain's transition to democracy. Hobsbawm (1995b [1983]: 4-5) notes a correlation between the invention of traditions and the weak- ening of the social infrastructure that underpinned their historical reference point. For example, the "thirty or forty years before the first world war" was a particularly active period for the invention of traditions across Europe (Hobsbawm 1995a [1983]: 263). This period relates to changes in political and social structures immediately preceding World War I where distinctions between the middle and upper classes were blurred, resulting in a need for "new devices to ensure or express social cohesion and identity and to struc- ture social relations" (ibid.). John Hooper (1995: 359) identifies an analo- gous process at a national level concerning bullfighting in general when he acknowledges: "One theory is that the popularity of bullfighting in recent years is attributable to precisely those forces which it had been thought would bring about its disappearance - that it is a reaction to the breakneck pace of</page><page sequence="26">548 Social Science History modernization, an unconscious attempt to cling to symbols of identity at a time when the country's leaders are urging the Spanish into an increas- ingly homogenous Europe." Thus arises the possibility that rejoneo repre- sents a means of symbolic power or capital for the "transformed" elite. It is in this sense that rejoneo is a performance of class, drawing from a narrative that begins with mounted lancing prior to the eighteenth century. However, drawing from a narrative that begins in the countryside, where employees rode horses to manage herds of wild bulls, rejoneo is not exclusively a perfor- mance by the upper class. Hobsbawm (1995a [1983]: 306) notes that the invention of sport tradi- tions around the turn of the twentieth century maintained "class lines" in three ways: "by maintaining aristocratic or middle-class control of the gov- erning institutions, by social exclusiveness or, more commonly, by the scar- city of the necessary capital equipment." As noted above, Mitchell (1991: 85) suggests that the aristocracy controlled the eighteenth- and nineteenth- century corrida through its role in bull breeding (i.e., during the aforemen- tioned "strategic retreat"). A similar process of distinction can be seen in contemporary rejoneo. The rejoneador Fermín Bohórquez Domecq, for example, regularly fights bulls that his family stud has bred. From this perspective, the invention of rejoneo could be understood as a vehicle for the landed gentry to express social cohesion and symbolic power. There is certainly an inherent exclusivity in rejoneo attached to horse-related expenses (in time and money) and the lack of formal training opportunities for rejoneadores without a family history of involvement. However, as I dis- cuss below, my research with rejoneadores who struggle financially and have no family ties to rejoneo suggests that rejoneo is a performance of class rather than a performance by members of the upper class. The narratives of rejoneo construct "far" historical ties to royalty, elites, and ruling classes and/or "near" historical ties to Andalusian stock breed- ers or vaqueros. As described above, rejoneadores dress in the traje corto asso- ciated with feria (fairs, in this case stock fairs) and with the stock owners' senior employees, or mayorales, who watch over herds of fighting bulls. Their aesthetic presentation is accessible to many Andalusians, but their role as rejoneadores is beyond the economic means of the majority of the popula- tion.38 This highlights a tension between what might be a performance of privilege and a culture that has been noted to value egalitarianism (Corbin and Corbin 1987: 8; see also Tax Freeman 1987). Hobsbawm's exploration of</page><page sequence="27">Mounted Bullfighting 549 the processes of invented traditions is useful here. He discusses how some invented traditions based on inequality could be "smuggled in" to a society that values egalitarianism by formal symbolic assent to a social organization which was de facto unequal. . . . More commonly they might foster the corporate sense of superiority of élites - particularly when these had to be recruited from those who did not already possess it by birth or ascription - rather than by inculcating a sense of obedience in inferiors. Some were encouraged to feel more equal than others. This might be done by assimilating élites to pre-bourgeois ruling groups or authorities. . . . Alternatively, perhaps, the esprit de corps, self-confidence and leadership of élites could be devel- oped by more esoteric "traditions" marking the cohesiveness of a senior official mandarinate. (Hobsbawm 1995b [1983]: 10) These comments question whether the Andalusian aesthetics that accompa- nied rejoneóos formalization in the twentieth-century disguise or transform its association with the landed gentry (thereby making it more broadly acces- sible to participating riders and their fans) or whether rejoneo provides indi- viduals with a means to acquire (more) class, or for a class to gain (more) members. The narrative of rejoneo constructs a flow of these doma vaquera aesthetics from equestrian cowboy culture in the Andalusian countryside to the plaza via Cañero. If the practice of maneuvering horses around bulls was maintained during two centuries of what has been referred to as a "strate- gic retreat" (for the landed gentry), could the (re)appearance of rejoneo in the 1920s be understood as a strategic comeback (for the transformed elite)? My fieldwork with some of "the new breed" of rejoneadores in Andalu- sia at the onset of the twenty-first century questions the construction of rejo- neo as strictly elitist. The involvement of financially struggling, self-taught, first-generation rejoneadores is largely due to changes in Spain's economic situation. As David D. Gilmore (1996: 56) noted a decade ago, "Extremes of wealth and poverty are today diminishing with Spain's post-Franco economic boom." The effect of these socioeconomic circumstances on participation in the equestrian sector was explained to me by a doma vaquera judge and com- petitor: "Horse activities were not undertaken by as many people before 1972 as they are now. The Spanish economic boom meant that people could buy horses. The number of horse owners steadily increased now that there are more professional riders, training centers and riding schools" (ethnographic</page><page sequence="28">550 Social Science History interview). Spanish economic growth in the 1960s and 1980s is considered to have made horse ownership more affordable to those without a family his- tory of equestrian involvement, let alone bull breeding or rejoneo. The effects contributed to an ongoing class-based reconfiguration of the participants in rejoneo. The rejoneador Andy Cartagena is one example: "Rejoneo used to be a sub world, a small family business. That is, until Andy Cartagena unleashed a boom with his youth and ability, shaking up the veterans and commanding the attention of the critics! He filled plazas that had never been filled since the '70s. At last, the press had to take notice and give rejoneo adequate media coverage" (de Cossío 2000, 2: 110; my translation).39 Rejoneo remains a costly activity but is becoming affordable to a broader participant base (ibid.).40 As a particular example of increasing involvement in equestrianism, rejoneo is ever more in the realm of possibility for some members of its audience. It attracts interest from those who aspire to be rejoneadores or appreciate first- hand the equestrian skills involved. In effect, individuals can "buy in" to the status that Hobsbawm (1995b [1983]: 9-10) argues is reintroduced by invented traditions. The involvement of rejoneadores from a variety of social, geographic, and economic backgrounds challenges upper-class associations and elitist constructions. For example, rejoneo may still be dominated by riders with associations or direct relations to the landed gentry of the south, but rejo- neadores from the north, such as Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza, are stealing some Andalusian thunder. Moreover, rejoneo has become more accessible to other classes largely through economic changes to the Spanish economy. As a result, there are ongoing changes to the construction and perception of class in rejoneo. Again, this suggests that rejoneo is more a performance ofxhz material and symbolic identifiers of a stereotypical Andalusian upper class than a performance by the upper class (at least when it is constructed as an upper-class activity rather than a working-class activity). Class is one significant dimension to the sociohistorical context of rejo- neo's formalization in the plaza from the early twentieth century as a dis- tinct activity from (but narratively associated with) lancing by nobles and the management of bulls from horseback in the Andalusian countryside. While intense social and political transformations occurred in Spain along- side the invention of rejoneo, class was as central to those changes as it is to the narrative traditions of rejoneo. This highlights the intimacy between nar- rative development by individuals and groups and broader social and politi-</page><page sequence="29">Mounted Bullfighting 551 cal forces. This combined top-down and bottom-up perspective to invented traditions reveals the multiple, layered, competing, and strategic intersec- tions between key moments in bullfighting history and rejoneo. The idea of narratives of tradition acknowledges that while some rejoneadores have direct associations with the upper class or landed gentry, rejoneo is not exclusive to representatives of that class. Moreover, attending to the narratives of tradi- tion that characterize the process of rejoneo invention explains how it is both old and new. The result is a more comprehensive understanding of contem- porary rejoneo, its broader historical context, and its interrelationship with narratives of the footed bullfighting tradition in Spain. Conclusion When Ramón Barga Bensusan (2000: 128) suggests replacing the picador in the first phase of the footed bullfight with a rejoneador, he suggests that it might be a "return to bullfighting's origins." But a return to what, where, or whom? As I have discussed above, those origins are conceived as being in the leisured pursuits of the courts of nobles as well as the doma vaquera practices of the agricultural realm. De Cossío (2000, 2: 62) describes rejoneóos history in a way that encapsulates its pluralistic status: "Mounted bullfighting returned with the same characteristics with which it had developed in the vast surround- ings of the marshes, where it was born" (emphasis added). By suggesting that rejoneo was born in the marshlands of the lower Guadalquivir region in Anda- lusia but had previously appeared in the plaza, de Cossío reifies the construc- tion of rejoneo as "the newest but also the oldest" form of bullfighting. In this article, I have suggested that this articulation can be understood by consider- ing the history of rejoneo through a framework of narratives of tradition. This framework recognizes the existence of two dominant narratives of rejoneo tra- dition and the nature of their entwinement by distinguishing key "chapters" characterized by archetypal genres, heroes, and villains. The two dominant narratives of mounted bullfighting tradition present alternative origins to current practice. One posits that current mounted bull- fighting harks back to mounted lancing in private courts by elites, the other that it derives from the management of bulls in the Andalusian countryside by the rural elite and their agrarian workers. Often these two narratives are woven into one dynamic metanarrative: the invention of rejoneo tradition as "the newest but also the oldest."</page><page sequence="30">552 Social Science History While rejoneo attracts the prestige of being the "original" form of bull- fighting, the elitist connotations of courtly lancing are glossed in favor of a more familiar and inalienable Andalusian aesthetic. How different moments and aesthetics are incorporated into the narratives of the historical develop- ment of rejoneo can be understood by identifying pivotal moments or chap- ters in the narratives that are selectively erased or emphasized to tell particu- lar stories for specific ends. The story of rejoneo as the oldest and therefore original form of bullfighting is told against a backdrop of courtly lancing peaking in the seventeenth century. This is the story line that constructs rejo- neo as a vestige of the disenfranchised rural elite, most often told by aficio- nados of the footed bullfight. The story of rejoneo as the newest form of bull- fighting, but one firmly established in the bullfighting world, is told against a backdrop of stock work on vast bull ranches in Andalusia. This is the story line of rejoneo bustling with the excitement of innovations, new players, and an expanding audience (as noted above in relation to Cartagena and Hermoso de Mendoza), mostly told by rejoneadores and their fans. Rejoneo has been constructed through narratives of tradition in such a way that it can enjoy the best of both worlds and be enjoyed by the best of both worlds (where "both" refers to the upper/lower socioeconomic classes as well as urban/rural). These reference points can be understood as mul- tiple narratives of rejoneo tradition that contribute to the invention of rejoneo as the oldest and the newest bullfighting tradition. Rejoneo is invented every day by rejoneadores, experts, laypeople, fans, and opponents. This invention takes place through the narratives created, sustained, and challenged by indi- viduals in the context of the broader social forces and postindustrial state forces emphasized by Hobsbawm and Ranger (1995 [1983]). Rejoneo in the future may be something more than the oldest and the newest form of bullfighting. The narratives that characterize its invention will almost certainly be anchored around the horse and may similarly refer- ence selectively and simultaneously from the chapters of mounted lancing, a strategic retreat, and a triumphant return. These future chapters will be characterized by new aesthetic developments, heroes, villains, and stories of tragedy and triumph. This is because narratives of tradition undergo con- stant construction, deconstruction, and reconstruction through enacted, spoken, and written narratives, of which this article is but one example.</page><page sequence="31">Mounted Bullfighting 553 Notes I am indebted to all those who generously participated in the research that inspired and facilitated this article. In particular, I am grateful to Mike Wilmore, Rod Lucas, Garry Marvin, and Adrian Franklin for comments on earlier versions of this article and to Danielle Every for her comments on a later version. I would like to thank the three anony- mous reviewers and the journal's editor, Douglas Anderton, for their comments, which resulted in significant refinement of the ideas in this article, as well as Drew Dawson for his engagement with this material during revisions and his attunement to narrative. Thanks also to Fiona Dennis for her editorial assistance. Early forays into the historical data included in this article were presented to the Discipline of Anthropology at the Uni- versity of Adelaide in 2004, and I am grateful for the feedback provided by colleagues on that occasion. The fieldwork on which this article is based was funded by an Australian Postgraduate Award, the Discipline of Anthropology at the University of Adelaide, the School of Social Sciences at the University of Adelaide, a Mutual Community Travel Grant, and the Walter and Dorothy Duncan Trust. 1 Indeed, the benefits of anthropological and historical collaborations were espoused by Sydel Silverman (1979) before invented tradition became a fashionable approach to sociohistorical investigations. 2 For example, Hugh Trevor-Roper (1995 [1983]) argues that Scottish traditional dress is an invented tradition designed to enhance Scottish identity. Other authors have used the concept of invented tradition to explain the creation of the meaning of an activity as traditional rather than the activity itself. David Cannadine (1995 [1983]), for instance, discusses the use of carriages by the British monarchy to illustrate that carriage use did not change over time but that public perception changed to view carriage use as a royal tradition. How the invention of tradition is based on an invented past, or at least a selective memory of past events, has inspired a consider- ation of the invention of modernity (Urla 1993). 3 For example, invented tradition has been used to analyze commodity production where the concept leverages greater profit in the global marketplace. This is clearly demonstrated by Robert C. Ulin (1995) in relation to the production of "authen- tic" and therefore more valuable wines. In addition, the invention of tradition has been incorporated into debates about the authenticity of performances, artifacts, and events under the rubric of cultural tourism. In some cases, minority groups reinvent "premodern" traditions to enable financial empowerment in a "postmodern" cli- mate (Tilley 1997), while in others invented tradition is used to justify the oppression of minority groups, such as in the case of South African apartheid (Spiegel 1989). In these instances, invented traditions have been interpreted as driven not only by commodity production but also by the construction of regional and national identity, especially withstanding globalization (Forte 2000). This ethnographic and theoreti- cal variety of discussions of invented tradition and agency is a reminder that some groups self-construct while others are essentially victims of others' construction. 4 Similarly, Stan Royal Mumford (1989) explores two increasingly intertwining his-</page><page sequence="32">554 Social Science History torical narratives in the Nepal Himalayas. Neighboring each other, the Gurungs and Tibetans in the Gyasumdo region tell différent stories of their histories based on a shared plot sequence of three periods. Whereas Mumford discusses historical narra- tives as traditions, I consider how traditions are invented through narratives. 5 The influence of this way of articulating the relationship among society, culture, and human being is identifiable in Bruce Kapferer's (2007: 80) recent comments that a human is a "being that has reinvented itself as a cultural and social being, as such constrained to circumstances of its own making and directed towards horizons of action and experience constituted through these constructions ." 6 This Andalusian dominance is no longer the case, most notable in the success and popularity of Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza from the north of Spain. 7 Paseíllo is the diminutive of el paseo, from the verb pasear, for a walk or a stroll. 8 Alta escuela is the Spanish translation of haute école, a French term for high school training that is commonly used in equestrian discourse to refer to the advanced clas- sical training of horses involving various "airs above ground" (see Helmberger 1994; Tucker 2005). This is the level of training for which the Spanish Riding School in Vienna is renowned. 9 For a detailed description of the footed bullfight, see Marvin 1994: esp. chap. 1. 10 Literally, caballero means "one who horses" or "horse person," which constitutes a theriomorphic blurring of the human-horse boundary. 11 The earliest accepted record of this comes from the Poem of Cid (Poema del Cid), where the hero is said to have "fought a bull at the marriage of the king's daughter around 1040" (Shubert 1999: 7). A century later the practice still formed part of nuptial celebrations when in 1124, "at the wedding of Don Velasco Muñoz and Doña Sancha Díaz, both Christian and Moorish nobility alternated in lancing bulls from horseback." When Juan II was betrothed to Maria of Aragon in 1418, and later, at their wedding in 1420, "there were jousts and tournaments and bullfights" (Barber and Barker 1989: 97). Indeed, it was for this reason that Felipe III built the Plaza Mayor in Madrid, which Felipe IV later made a cultural center for mounted bull- fighting and other social events. Spanish royalty who engaged in the practice of lanc- ing bulls from horseback include Kings Carlos I (1517-56), Felipe III (1598-1621), and Felipe IV (1621-65) (Abarquero Durango 1984: 86; Nieto Manjon 2001: 18). The courts of Juan I and II (1406-54) and of Enrique II (1369-79) and IV (1454- 74) of Castile drafted rules for fighting bulls from horseback (Abarquero Durango 1984: 86). 12 Alphonso Lingis (2000) links the personal adornment and display of knights with animal mating displays, as both are intended to lure female favor. 13 Felipe V's dislike for the corrida caballeresca may derive from a historical misfortune to the French royal family. "On 30 June 1559, Henri II of France took part in a tour- nament at Paris to celebrate his daughter's wedding to Philip of Spain" (Dent 1974: 134; see also Barber and Barker 1989: 135). He was killed (see Martin 2001; Ruehl 2005). 14 Jineta is considered a Spanish style of riding (Bennett 1998: 115) with Andalusian</page><page sequence="33">Mounted Bullfighting 555 origins (Loch 1986: 32-33, 1990: 41-42; Llamas Perdigó 1997: 52). It is bound to an essentially Andalusian cowboy-style equestrian identity. The jineta style of riding positions the rider's legs underneath his or her body, with a bend in the knee and the hip that absorbs the horse's movement. The intricacies of jineta as a style of mili- tary riding on the Iberian Peninsula are described by Paulo Gavião Gonzaga (2004: 181-91). For a discussion of this style in the Spanish bullfight and how it affects the human-horse relationship, see Thompson 2007a, forthcoming. 15 The brida style of riding is typified by the medieval knight and characterized by the rider's legs thrust forward along the horse's shoulder to brace against lancing charges made in straight lines. This riding position is associated with riders in north- ern Spain and the use of the long lance from the backs of "large, heavy, sluggish, unsupple horses" (Llamas Perdigó 1997: 52). It would have been a feat of balance and coordination for a rider to remain mounted on an agile, light-framed horse that could stop, start, and turn swiftly while riding a la brida. Elsewhere (Thompson forthcoming) I compare the effect of this position on the horse-rider relationship in a comparison of the picador and rejoneador human-animal-object networks. 16 It was also the era in which the toro bravo (Spanish fighting bull) is considered to have reached its "full genetic potential" for the qualities required by the corrida (Abarquero Durango 1984: 90, 97, 107). 17 Many of these are practiced today. See Douglass 1997 for a comprehensive account of local and regional bullfighting traditions throughout Spain. 18 There is an "intermediary" mounted figure in the history of Spanish bullfighting known as the varilarguero. The varilarguero is a less acknowledged mounted figure involved in the footed bullfight around the eighteenth century. Unlike the con- temporary picador, the varilarguero led the formal procession at the beginning of the corrida: "These new recruits arrived on horseback, but instead of rejones they wielded a much longer spear known as a garrocha or vara larga- % tool much like the one they employed in herding bulls in the fields" (Mitchell 1991: 53). The vari- larguero approached the bull very differently from those riders who took part in the corridas caballerescas. "Instead of galloping past the bull like the aristocrats, the so-called varilargueros reined in their mounts, held their ground, and drove the tips of their spears into the bull's withers as he charged" (ibid.: 53). The role and skills of today's picador more closely resemble those of the varilarguero than of the rejoneador. 19 Timothy Mitchell (1991: 88), following Gil Calvo (1989), suggests that "what Span- ish aristocrats did for bulls has an exact parallel in what British aristocrats did with their stallions, that is, developing a purebred species through artificial methods of selection based on their own class ideology." In fact, while the hundreds of brave bull ranches currently in operation in Spain are based on five foundation bloodlines (ibid.: 89), "every modern thoroughbred can trace its ancestry back to one of the three founding sires" (Cassidy 2003: 15). 20 This selective breeding is the fundamental irony behind the construction of the Spanish toro bravo as untamed or wild. 21 Bulls are kept as free from physical human interference as possible and are main-</page><page sequence="34">556 Social Science History tained on expansive ranches. Horses are therefore required to cover long distances and hard terrain to check on them. The horse is essential in encierros (penning bulls), acoso y derribo (knocking over bulls; often to stun calves to allow the rider to check them or administer medical aid), and tentaderos (where young bulls or cows are tested for the bullfight). Furthermore, prior to animal transportation, horses were required to safely herd fighting bulls from ranches through towns to the bull pens of the plaza. 22 The traje corto is also known as the traje del campo (country suit). It consists of a wide- brimmed hat, a short collarless jacket usually accompanied by a vest, a crisp white shirt, high-waisted midcalf-length pants that match the jacket and have white cuffs, boots, and leather zahones (apron-style full-length chaps that attach high at the waist with plaited leather cords). 23 For a more thorough biographical overview than this article allows, see García Pérez 1927 and Laguna Menor 2000. 24 Alternatively, Abarquero Durango (1984: 93) claims that Cañero retired on medical advice. 25 Horns can be "tipped" by shaving or padding the ends. 26 Tordilla, from the word torda to describe a gray (white) horse, most likely refers to a mixture of darker hairs with a gray base that forms a "whitish" color similar to a dapple gray or roan, although these have their own specific terms in Spanish equine vocabulary (rodado and roano, respectively). 27 A rejoneador recalled an incident to me in which he also jumped over a bull: Last year I jumped over a bull with a horse. I had placed a banderilla, the bull stopped . . . and I jumped over it; just jumped! But it is difficult, it has to be well calculated; the crowd liked it a lot, but I think it was circus-like. It wasn't very significant to me. After I jumped over the bull I got off the horse and it didn't mean anything. Well, I jumped a bull and I'm still here. Now, if the horse had jumped and I had really liked it. ... Well, that's how rejoneo evolves." This rejoneador was known for being (and was self-defined as) artista (artistic) in style. Jumping a bull is more associated with the valiente (valiant) style. 28 In addition to this geographic aspect of rejoneo as a performance, it can also be understood as a performance of equestrian expertise, the attainment of a "centau- rian" rider-horse relationship (Thompson forthcoming), the fluidity of the human- animal boundary (Thompson 2007b), and the limits of risk and danger. 29 Likewise, Linda Birke (2007: 234) distinguishes between Western and English equestrian aesthetics through a reference to hats when she notes that "the top hat, not the Stetson, better characterizes the world of English horses." ó'j As mentioned above, the history ot tooted, or modern, ouiinghting also involves a founding father figure, Romero. 31 While Cañero demonstrated an alternative role for the horse in the bullfight, the picador's horse continues to be used as a target for the bull, albeit with protective padding mandated since the late 1920s.</page><page sequence="35">Mounted Bullfighting 557 32 See Gilmore 1980: 66-67 for a more detailed discussion of the "don" title than this article allows. 33 In 1945 Domecq y Diez was joined by Angel Peralta Pineda, whose father was a farmer in the marismas (marshlands) of the lower Guadalquivir region (Puebla del Rio, Seville Province). Peralta also made many revolutionary changes to rejoneo that are still in place today. He softened Cañero's brutish style by modifying the saddle, shortening the shank length of curb on the horse's bit (thus reducing leverage), reversing the direction of the spurs away so they pointed downward, and reducing the points on their rowels. Peralta developed many of the instruments in current use, such as the banderillas cortas (short banderillas), the rosa (small banderilla or spike fashioned to look like a rose), and the rejón de muerte (rejón of death). Stylistically, he developed the corbeta (a way of placing the rosa), rode sin bridas (without reins, also known as sin manos or without hands), and introduced the banderillas a dos manos (placing two banderillas at once) (Abarquero Durango 1984: 107). Together with his brother Rafael, Angel also developed the form of riding por colleras (in pairs) to kill one bull (Elrejoneo.com 2001-2010b). Moreover, he improved medical services to riders and acted as a surgeon to his own horses (Abarquero Durango 1984: 107). 34 This semantically rich concept objectifies the horse while "replacing" the cape object for a dynamic and organic animal subject. This can be understood through an actor-network theory approach that presumes the assemblage of human/rider, ani- mal/horse (and bull), and technology/ tool that generates a transformed (sense of) being (Thompson 2007b, forthcoming). 35 The philosophical and aesthetic constructions of these two approaches to mounted bullfighting distinguish a mounted torero from a rejoneador. The former is a torero who interacts with the bull as if on foot, but from horseback, while the latter has a weaker philosophical and stylistic link to footed bullfighting. The differences in terminology highlight the various discourses through which rejoneadores and others refer to the approaches to mounted bullfighting. However, the phrasing of rejoneo more literally as mounted bullfighting (toreo a caballo or toreo ecuestre) requires the use of terms deriving from the verb torear, which is most associated with the footed bullfight. Therefore to avoid confusion and to honor rejoneo as a distinct and not a subsidiary form of corrida, I use rejoneo (not toreo a caballo) to refer to the act of mounted bullfighting and rejoneador (not torero a caballo) to distinguish the mounted bullfighter from the footed bullfighter. 36 That said, an aesthetic feature of rejoneo that distinguishes it clearly from footed bullfighting is the enticement of bulls with the horse's quarters (buttocks) while the rider looks over his or her shoulder at the bull. 37 The themes of social injustice in Jerez de la Frontera became the subject for Vicente Blasco Ibáñez's novel La bodega (1919; later the 1930 film directed by Benito Perojo), believed to be based on the Domecq family that delivered a rejoneo dynasty (Jiménez García 1998a, 1998b). 38 In an interesting parallel, the bullfighter on foot is typically understood as a repre-</page><page sequence="36">558 Social Science History sentative of the lower classes, whose clothing ensures that he or she is demarcated as especially different for having achieved social status through bullfighting (Marvin 1994: 106-9, 148). 39 Cartagena (Andrés Céspedes Gonzales) made his public debut in 1996 in Nîmes, France, at the age of 16. He is one of many rejoneadores who have become famous, commanded media attention, and raised the profile of rejoneo. 40 At the same time that rejoneo is becoming more financially accessible to riders, it is more cost-effective for event organizers. At the end of the 1980s organizers found that staging a corrida de rejones had a greater return than footed bullfighting, because the bulls are often cheaper and rejoneadores and their cuadrillas (teams of assistants) are paid less (de Cossío 2000, 2: 110).
