<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ATOMS WITHIN Us, by Ernest Bor- ek, Columbia University Press, New York, 1961, 272 pages, 5 illustrations, $5.00. This very interesting and well-written book is notably free of errors, both of fact and typography. There are discussions on some of the important topics lying in the fields of biology and biochemistry. Some are: enzymes, vitamins, sugars, am- ino acids, blood, genes, and isotopes as related to studies in biology. The great- er part of the discussions concern the his- tory back of our present day knowledge. This serves excellently to illustrate the scientific method in action, although it restricts the space available for a presen- tation of modern knowledge; the reader is often left with the wish that the au- thor would go further in this area. The book is written for the intelligent layman and for students in other fields who might wish to know more about these topics, although even the advanced work- er in biology might benefit from certain sections of the book. In places the dis- cussions are perhaps a little involved for the non-scientist; but as a whole, the book achieves its aim. Dr. Borek is to be congratulated on the fact that, as a chemist, he does not include a single structural formula in the entire book. To resist the temptation to use this language of chemistry must have required great will power, yet the book is probably bet- ter for its purpose without the formid- able aggregation of symbols and bonds which have little meaning to one not well initiated into mysteries of modern chem- istry. The title of the book is somewhat mis- leading since a discuission of atoms is not included in most of the chapters. Perhaps we could reason that all of the activities of the body have their ultimate basis in atoms and thus justify the name used in the title. Dr. Borek's liberal use of statements with an anthropomorphic slant is certain to bring criticism from many conserva- tive biologists. As an example, on one page (p. 131) we find the following: "The blood contains powerful neutral- izing mechanisms ready to pounce on the acids cast off by the cells." "This is the truck on which oxygen and carbon dioxide are shuttled back and forth." "- liberating oxygen to the gasping tissue cells." "Unfortunately, hemoglobin is not very discriminating as it forms its chemical alliances."</page><page sequence="2">146 Bios Probably the gem of them all, however, is found on the next page: "_ when in old age they falter at their tasks they are liquidated. There are special cells in the blood vessels of the spleen and liver which unceremonious- ly devour the aging red cells. These cannibalistic phagocytes (eating cells) are constantly trapping and dismember- ing the more sluggishly moving red cells. The iron is salvaged from the wreckage, but the pigment, heme, is piped into the gall bladder, ." Certainly such a presentation may stim- ulate interest among the non-scientists and the author may justify its use on the theory that you cannot have readers if you do not have interest. Probably no reader would get the impression that red cells are literally torn limb from limb. Books of this nature are more difficult to write than those by a scientist for a scientist. We need such books badly, however, to bridge the gap between the advanced research going on in the lab- oratories and the understanding of the general public. If the scientists them- selves do not write them, they are at- tempted by the non-scientists with the at- tendant evils of misinformation, distor- tion, and errors which so frequently oc- cur. Dr. Borek is to be congratulated on his successful effort in this regard. A. M. Winchester Stetson University</page></plain_text>
