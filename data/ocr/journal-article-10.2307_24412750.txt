<plain_text><page sequence="1">Renaissance Studies Vol. 14 No. 1 Titian 's London Allegory and the three beasts of his selva oscura SiMONA Cohen There is no documentary evidence regarding Titian's so-called Allegory of Prudence in the National Gallery, London (henceforth Allegory) (Figs 1 and 2), and the interpretation set forth by Panofsky in 1955 has remained almost uncontested until now.1 This study will examine the theory that what appears to be an exceptional theme actually derives from long and well documented literary and artistic traditions. It will be suggested, however, that Titian's visual formulation of this theme is so unique that it had no direct predecessors or followers. Finally, an attempt will be made to explain why, and under what circumstances, this painting was created. The interpretation of the London Allegory set forth here will illustrate Titian's use of animals as disguised symbols. The artist's repeated use of animal themes in seemingly incongruous associations was shown in a previous article to derive from literary and artistic traditions of animal iconography combined with the exegetic methods applied in religious and mythological allegory.2 The underlying moralistic orientation of animal metaphors was often utilized to reinforce veiled levels of meaning in his imagery. AN ALLEGORY OF PRUDENCE? According to Panofsky's theory, Titian created an allegory of Prudence by combining two previously unrelated iconographie traditions. The first tradition, represented by a tricephalous image, conveys the concept of Prudence by means of three human heads which represent in turn past experience, present perspicuity, and future foresight. Below the human heads is another tricephalous image comprising three animal heads - a wolf, a lion, and a dog. These are identified with the Alexandrian god Serapis, 1 E.

National Gallery, London who was popularized in the Renaissance in Egyptianizing and pseudo hieroglyphic literature. The well-known interpretation devised by Macrobius in his Saturnalia established a parallel moral and temporal significance, which tied the anthropomorphic and theriomorphic triads as well as the inscribed maxim into an allegory of Time and Prudence.3 Panofsky revealed that the mediators of this theme, those who had adopted the Serapian creature in the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance, transformed it into the three-headed serpent/dragon of Apollo, which, like Titian's therio morphic triad, combined the heads of a dog, a wolf, and a lion. Unlike Titian, however, they attached these heads to the coils of a serpent. Apollo as a sun god also dominated the three modes of time, which Panofsky perceived as analogous to those of Prudence.4 3 Macrobius, Saturnalia, I, 20, 13ff., trans. P. V.

Fig. 2 Titian, Allegory, X-ray Panofsky recognized that 'this very superimposition, never resorted to by any other artist, presents a problem'.5 He concluded, nevertheless, that Titian had painted himself as the old man on the left and that the other two figures were portraits of his son Orazio and his younger relative Marco Vecellio, both of whom assisted in his workshop and were heirs to his professional and financial legacy. The painting of the three generations in an allegory of Prudence was described as 'a moving human document of his old age' that expressed his concerns for the future. Is it possible that this hypothetical reconstruction has obscured significant 5 Ibid. 165.</page><page sequence="4">Titian's London Allegory 49 iconographie associations? Before new evidence is presented, it would be useful to point out some of the weaker links in the former reconstruction. Panofsky explicated the synthesis between human and animal heads in the following way: On the strength of this exegesis [i.e. Macrobius] posterity took it for granted that the three animal heads of the Alexandrian monster expressed the same idea as do the human heads of different age which we encountered in such western representations of Prudence as that of the Rossellinesque relief in the Victoria and Albert Museum or the Siena pavement, the tripartition of time into past, present and future[and] we can easily foresee the possibility of either replacing or combining the one with the other, all the more so as Time and Prudence were linked in iconographie tradition by the common denominator of the serpent.6 In other words, the shared connotation of the three modes of time was sufficient reason for combining human and animal heads in one emblem atic image. If we examine this assumption in the broader context of late medieval and Renaissance iconography, it appears highly problematic. Hybrid images, combining human and animal parts had a deeply rooted negative connotation in Western art. Such composite creatures included the devil, demons, monsters, personifications of vices as well as mythological creations, like the centaur, minotaur, and satyr, which represented bestial instincts as opposed to, and in conflict with, human virtues.7 The late fifteenth- and sixteenth-century tolerance for bizarre hybrid images, primarily in emblematic art, was reserved for concepts of an esoteric or metaphysical nature.8 Although it exhibits some emblematic characteristics, we will see that Titian's painting does not fall into the category of emblematic hybrid imagery. Contrary to the Serapian and Apolline creatures, which create a fusion between the three animal heads and a monstrous animal body, Titian's three humans actually have human bodies which are depicted down to the chest area. These figures are furthermore separated from the animal triad by spatial referents; the animals placed in front are partially blocking our view of them. Furthermore, the serpentine element which is supposedly the 'common denominator' and does figure in most medieval and Renaissance versions of the Serapian or Apollonian creature is lacking in Titian's Allegory. The Latin inscription in the upper part of the painting reads: 'ex praeter 6 Ibid. 154-5. 7 On monsters, see G. Lascault, Le monstre dans l'art occidental (Paris, 1973); R. Wittkower, 'Marvels of the East: a study in the history of monsters', and 'Marco Polo and the pictorial tradition of the marvels of the East', in Allegory and the Migration of Symbols (London, 1977), 44-74, 76-92; P.

This has been construed as the caption to each of the tricephalous images. But the idea of repeating one and the same message by means of two parallel images and a motto seems unnecessarily redundant. The direct relationship between Titian's imagery and emblematic lit erature, such as the Hypnerotomachia Polifili (1499) and Pierio Valeriano's Hieroglyphica (1556),9 which have been cited as sources, is not as evident as has been suggested. The Hypnerotomachia describes an eclectic and indis criminate conglomeration of symbolic objects which are largely divorced from their original contexts. The 'simulachro dagli Aegyptii di Serapi', showing the three animal heads, is entwined by a serpent/dragon and posted on a standard. It is not interpreted as an allegory of Prudence, and is nowhere combined with the three human heads.10 Valeriano, on the other hand, following Macrobius and Petrarch,11 made Serapis a sun god who is symbolized by the serpent which entwines the image of the tricephalous animal, thus signifying that he dominates Time and Prudence - the forgotten past, the actual present, and the hope of the future. The illustration that accompanies this text shows heads of a dog, a lion, and a wolf attached to a human body dressed in armour. Valeriano explains the cosmological significance of this 'simulacra di Serapi', who has 'per capo il gran mondo celeste' and manifests in his limbs 'tutta la grandezza del mondo'.12 There is no analogy in Titian's painting to the solar or cosmic interpretation. Neither Serapis, nor his serpent, nor the bizarre figure illustrating Valeriano's text had any influence on Titian. The idea that the three heads are family portraits, identifiable as Orazio, Marco, and Titian himself, is entirely conjectural. There are no extant por traits of Orazio or Marco for comparison. Other attempts to identify these heads as prominent men have been, in my opinion, equally unconvincing.13 Although, hypothetically, the heads could be portraits, and there is no reason to doubt that they were painted from models, it is highly probable that they were conceived as ideal types. The dark and bearded man in the center typifies the Cinquecento Venetian ideal of Virilità, and his likeness can be found in many paintings by Titian and Veronese.14 The youth with his fair complexion, curly golden locks, and lavish clothes conforms with literary 9 F.

Prado, Madrid personifications of Gioventu (youth) and Luxuria (voluptuousness).15 He also appears as Adonis in the various versions of Titian's Venus and Adonis.™ The same two types were juxtaposed by Veronese in his Allegory of Infidelity (c. 1565, National Gallery, London), painted about the same time as Titian's Allegory, where a voluptuous nude women is trying to manoeuvre between a well-dressed, golden-haired youth, on one side, and a dark and virile warrior type, on the other. The profile of the elderly man calls for a more complex analysis, which will be undertaken below. Let it suffice to state here that the head of the old man 15 Ripa, Iconologia, 184, subsequently wrote under Gioventu: 'un giovine altiero, vestito di varii colori, con ghirlanda di semplici fiori, da una parte vi sara un cane da caccia, e dall'altra un cavallo ben guarnito, , e con la destra stia in atto di sparger danari' and adds 'La varietà dei colori significa la fréquente mutatione de i pensieri, e proponimenti giovenili'. The Passione d'Amore (p. 378) is capable of turning men into beasts; among those mentioned is the dog and sensuality is described as a young boy with gold-coloured hair. 16 See especially the versions of the so-called Farnese type in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York and the National Gallery of Art, Washington, both attributed to c. 1560-5, which would be shortly before the Allegory's completion.</page><page sequence="7">52 Simona Cohen ^ ^ i Fig. 4 Veronese, Marriage at Carta. Louvre, Paris was painted long after the other two and represents a different stylistic phase in Titian's career. The surviving self-portraits by Titian, especially the profile in the Prado (Fig. 3), which is generally cited for comparison with the Allegory, have a penetrating, human quality and a mellowness conveyed by soft, gradated tones and sensitive chiaroscuro. Conversely, the head of the old man in the London Allegory is reduced to a caricature, with angular scowling features that are executed by rough and rapid brush strokes. Even the flaming red cap in the Allegory, which contrasts with Titian's usual black one, further emphasizes the highly expressive as opposed to the subdued character. The other heads in the painting are executed in quite a different manner. The assignation here of a later date for the head of the old man and the assumption that it is Titian's self-portrait find support in another painting. The portrait of Titian in Veronese's Marriage at Cana (Fig. 4), dated 1563, which should be more or less contemporary with the London Allegory, bears great resemblance to the old man and even repeats the red cap." 17 The identification of Titian as the contrabass player in Veronese's Marriage at Cana was made by Marco Boschini, Le rieche minere della pittura veneziana (Venice, 1674) and repeated by A. M. Zanetti, Delia pittura veneziana (Venice, 1771).

Wildenstein Collection, Musée Marmottan, Paris PRECEDENTS IN RENAISSANCE ART The human and animal triads obviously represent two analogous themes or, to borrow the Oxford English Dictionary definition, there is 'a resemblance of form or function between organs essentially different'. The fact that the analogy is composed of three parallel elements exemplifies a mode of cognitive organization - tripartite structuring - that is typical, or archetypal, of Western thought and visual expression. Medieval culture was especially prone to numerical categories as a mode of abstraction, and the numerous applications of the symbolic triad are well known.18 The human-beast analogy, organized as a tripartite image, is so basic a formula that no sophisticated extrapolations of pseudo-hieroglyphic or cryptic, emblematic texts are necessary to make sense of it.19 18 Among the important writings on tripartite structuring and triadic images in Indo-European cultures in general, see the writings of George Dumézil, listed and reviewed in C. S. Littleton, The New Comparative Mythology; An Anthropological Assessment of the Theories of George Dumézil (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1966) and J. Gonda, Triads in the Veda (1976). For its expression in medieval literature and art, see R. Pettazzoni, 'The pagan origins of the three-headed representation of the Christian Trinity', Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, 9 (1946), 135-51; and E. Wind, 'Pagan vestiges of the Trinity', in Wind, Pagan Mysteries, 241-55. Tripartite structuring has been noted in regard to the classification of sins by M. W. Bloomfield, The Seven Deadly Sins (East Lansing, MI, 1967), 149ff., 373, and R. Newhauser, The Treatise of the Vices and Virtues in Latin and the Vernacular (Turnhout, 1993), 91. A. Katzenellenbogen, Allegories of the Virtues and Vices in Medieval Art (Toronto, 1989), 43, n. 3, noted an illumination of the three-headed Sanctitas, who achieved perfection in a threefold way. 19 An example of this approach is found in D. Arasse, 'Titian et son Allegorie de la Prudence: un peintre et ses motifs', in D. Rosand (ed.), Interpretazioni Veneziane (Venice, 1984), 291-310.</page><page sequence="9">54 Simona Cohen ... _ mm , Fig. 6 Sassetta, St Francis in Glory. Berenson Collection, Florence. Reproduced by permission of the President and Fellows of Harvard College Let us begin with the visual evidence. In Venice, during the early quattro cento, the miniaturist Cristoforo Cortese executed an illumination of St Francis in Glory showing the saint as he tramples three personified vices, which are antithetic to Chastity, Obedience, and Poverty, the three person ified virtues above (Fig. 5).20 Two out of the three vices support animals on their shoulders. The left figure supports the boar - the traditional attribute of Gula (Gluttony) or Luxuria (Lust or Lechery). The lady on the right holding money bags carries a wolf with his head twisted back, identifying her as Avaritia (Greed).21 The central figure in armour, who has fallen on his head, is Superbia (Pride). The virtues are not associated with animals. 20 Regarding Cortese and his St Francis in Glory, see S. Cohen, 'Cristoforo Cortese Reconsidered', in Arte Veneta, 39 (1985), 22-31; and G. Canova, 'Miniatura e pittura in eta tardogotica', in La Pittura nel Veneto: II Quattrocento (Milan, 1989), 193-222, esp. 200-1. 21 The wolf was believed to have no joint in his neck and was therefore unable to twist it. This was interpreted in bestiaries as a symbol of the stiff-necked or stubborn sinner.</page><page sequence="10">Titian's London Allegory 55 Fig. 7 Agnolo Bronzino, Justice Liberating Innocence, tapestry. Palazzo Pitti, Florence A related version of this theme was executed just a few years later by the Sienese painter Sassetta for the central panel of the Borgo San Sepolcro altarpiece (Fig. 6).22 The female figure on the left, resting on a boar and regarding herself in the mirror, is once again Luxuria. In the centre lies an armed warrior who has fallen on the lion of Superbia, and on the left a nun grasps her money bag in a press which is supported by the familiar wolf of Avaritia.

Berenson, Sassetta (Paris, 1948), figs 28-30. 23 This iconography may be related to St Bonaventura^ Speculum animae (thirteenth century), where he</page><page sequence="11">56 Simona Cohen triad still associated with vices reappeared in a different context during Titian's time. Agnolo Bronzino, borrowing from a design by Francesco Salviati, repeated the animal theme in his cartoon for the Justice Liberating Innocence tapestry, executed in 1545 for Duke Cosimo I (Fig. 7).24 The wolf, the lion, and the dog (who replaces the boar), accompanied by a hissing serpent, are the vices that threaten Innocence. Here Justice rather than St Francis, accompanied by Father Time revealing Truth, is triumphing over the vices. Cortese and Sassetta had conveyed the idea of man's spiritual victory over his own vices; Bronzino's vices are external forces threatening the integrity of Florence, while Cosimo as Justice is the deus ex machinal Addi tional sources were adopted and reinterpreted in Bronzino's transformation of the animal theme; most important among these was the famous imagery from Dante which must be considered in relation to Titian's Allegory. THE BEASTS OF DANTE'S INFERNO Symbolic associations between the image of three threatening beasts and concepts of moral transgression were popularized by Dante's allegorical trilogy, if not before. The Divina Commedia opens with the famous passage: 'Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita / mi ritrovai per una selva oscura / che la diritta via era smarrita'.26 Dante, lost in a dark forest, finds his escape barred by three beasts which appear in succession. The first, 'una lonza leggiera e presta molto / che di pel maculato era coperta', is interpreted as a leopard or an ounce, symbol of Luxuria. The second, a lion 'con la testa alta, e con rabiosa fame / si che parea che l'aer ne temesse', is the image of Superbia. The third is the she-wolf of Avaritia, 'ed una lupa, che di tutte brame / sembrava carca con la sua magrezza / e molte genti fe'gia viver grame'.27 A trecento commentary written shortly after Dante's death called these the most common vices.28 They are the same three encountered in the St Francis paintings and in Titian's Allegory. Luxuria could be represented by describes Luxuria, Superbia, and Avaritia as the main branches of the tree of vices from which other capital sins emerge. 24 See Salviati's Uffizi design inj. Cox-Rearick, Bronzino's Chapel ofEleonora in the Palazzo Vecchio (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1993), fig. 102 and ref. 161. 25 For a different interpretation of the three animals in Bronzino's tapestry designs, see J. Cox-Rearick, Dynasty and Destiny in Medici Art (Princeton, 1984), 286. 26 The following translations were made by J. A. Carlyle, La Divina Commedia (London, 1938): 'In the middle of the journey of our life I came to myself in a dark wood where the straight way was lost' (Inferno I, 1-3). 27 'A Leopard, light and very nimble, which was covered with spotted hair' (Inferno i, 32-3). 'He [the lion] seemed coming upon me with head erect, and furious hunger; so that the air seemed to have fear thereat' (i, 46-8). 'And a she-wolf, that looked full of all cravings in her leanness; and has ere now made many live in sorrow' (i, 49-51). On the leopard's spots as a sign of sin, and these animal symbols in general, see Ripa, Iconologia, 294-5, under Libidine; R. T. Holbrook, Dante and the Animal Kingdom (New York, 1966), 86-126 and Bloomfield, Seven Deadly Sins, 200. The spotted shirt of the young man in Titian's painting may be a reference to the spots of the leopard. 28 L'Ottimo Commento della Divina Commedia, testo inedito d'un contemporaneo di Dante citato dagli Accademici della Crusca (Pisa, 1827).</page><page sequence="12">Titian's London Allegory 57 a spotted leopard, a dog, a peacock, or even a scorpion, and buperbia by a lion or a horse whose rider has fallen, while Avaritia was consistently asso ciated with the wolf. The animals might change but the same three vices were repeated. The obstacles described by Dante, which correspond to the division of sins in the Inferno, are not external but those within, and have been interpreted by medieval and modern commentators as irrational spiritual obstacles to purgatory and redemption.29 The images, imbued with mythical conno tations, belonged to the literary and visual tradition which preceded Titian's recapitulation of the theme. THE MIRROR OF HUMAN MORALS In the Middle Ages and Renaissance it was often said that man becomes a beast when he has lost his reason.30 Ecclesiastics argued that lower animals were created to serve as objects of contemplation for moral instruction. In other words, they embodied qualities in which man could perceive the reflection of his own sins. The subject of animals exemplifying human traits has been thoroughly discussed in the literature and only those precedents explicitly pertaining to the human-beast analogy will concern us here. The common denominator of such analogies, whether they are in the Bible, in Greek or Roman natural histories, in medieval bestiaries or encyclopaedias, in patristic exegesis, in popular beast fables, or in Renaissance allegorical literature, is the moralistic intent.31 The passage in the Book of Jeremiah which inspired Dante's beast allegory had been the theme of medieval commentaries long before. It reads as follows: Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay him, and a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over their cities; every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces, because their transgressions are many, and their backslidings are increased.32 29 P. Piehler, The Visionary Landscape; A Study in Medieval Allegory (London, 1971), ch. 7, writes of the animal symbols as 'certain not fully identified forces of his subconscious mind'. If this sounds anachronistically Freudian, cf. notes 30 and 33 below. 30 For example, Walter Hilton, in his Scale of Perfection (late fourteenth century) n, ch. 14, 275ff., typically stated that men by sin turn themselves into the likeness of beasts. The proud man becomes a lion, envious and angry men become hounds, the covetous become wolves, and so on. In the late fifteenth century Pico della Mirandola, in his Oration on the Dignity of Man, wrote of the 'unreasoning drives of the many sided brute, the passionate violence and anger of the lion within us'. In his Heptaplus, he stated: 'Between the rational part. . . and all that is corporeal in us . . . there is an intermediate sensual part which we share with the brutes.' Irrational drives, he said, are common to man and beasts and 'often drive us to a brutish life' (Pico della Mirandola, On the Dignity of Man, On Being and the One, Heptaplus, trans. D. Carmichael (Indianapolis, 1965), 117-25. 31 See Bloomfield, Seven Deadly Sins; F. D. Klingender, Animals in Art and Thought to the End of the Middle Ages (Cambridge, MA, 1971); B.

He described 'the lustful pigs, the deceitful foxes, the gossiping dogs, the surly lions, the wrathful boars,the greedy wolves, the sluggerdly asses', concluding that 'all of these dwell among temporal goods just as, on the other hand, the occupation of the just is in heaven'.34 Another commentator on Jeremiah's prophesy, Hugo a Sancto Caro (Hue de Saint Chers, thirteenth century), explicitly established the analogy between the three vices and the Three Ages of Man by making Sensuality, Pride, and Greed (i.e. the leopard, the lion, and the wolf) characteristics of youth, middle age, and old age.35 All the elements of Titian's Allegory are already associated there. The allusion to the Three Ages of Man was probably implicit in Dante's beast allegory as well. Holbrook suggested that it was not by chance that Dante met the leopard (or ounce) before the lion and the wolf 'for the Divina Commedia condenses the vicissitudes of life into a few days and thus the three beasts seem to follow one another as youth is followed by manhood and manhood by old age'.36 Except for the substitution of the dog for the ounce, Titian retained the same sequence of animals/sins and Ages of Man. A cross-section of the animal images presented in the literary and visual representations thus far discussed illustrates the continuity of this triadic formula throughout the centuries (Table 1). The fact that several animals were interchangeable as symbols of Luxuria is characteristic of the literature, 33 Migne, P.L. 193, col. 197. The whole passage reads: 'By the name beast is meant the irrational mind, as it is declared through Moses: If a beast set foot on the mountain, he will be stoned to death. For the mountain is properly the loftiness of contemplation and the beast the irrational mind' (trans. Piehler, Visionary Landscape, 114). 34 Commentum Bemardi Silvestris super sex libros Eneidos Vergilii, Guilelmus Reidel (Gryphiswaldae, 1924), 62. (trans. Piehler, Visionary Landscape, 115).

Thus the lion could be Pride as well as Wrath; the dog could be Lust, Vanity, Fraud, or Envy; the wolf could be Greed, Violence, Incontinence, or Hypocrisy (and therefore symbol of heretics), and so on.37 Among the many Renaissance sources that perpetuated these symbolic associations was the Hieroglyphica of Valeriano, which was cited by Panofsky and others for its presentation of the Serapian creature, without reference to the many passages in which the same animals are related to the traditional categories of human sins.38 Valeriano does not connect the latter passages with the tricephalous image, but he constantly makes the human-animal/sin analogy, referring, for example, to men who are transformed into evil wolves and to those, with the head of a boar or an ass, representing Ignorance.39 Ripa's Iconologia and other emblematic compendia of the late sixteenth century provide ample proof that the medieval animal symbols were still mirroring human morals in Western iconography. The theme also received renewed impetus in moral philosophy, political theory, and literary allegory throughout the Renaissance.40 ELEMENTS OF THE VISUAL TRADITION Sassetta, in his St Francis in Glory (c. 1437-44) portrays personifications of vices superincumbent on their animal symbols (Fig. 6). Titian's human heads are similarly superimposed on the heads of animals. Both are related to the human-animal analogy which found visual expression in the Middle Ages. The moralistic allegorical literature of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries abounds in pictorial descriptions of vices riding their symbolic animals in procession, or confronting a pilgrim on a spiritual journey, or occasionally combating mounted virtues in the tradition of the Psycho machia, to illustrate the battlefield of man's soul.41 There was also the theme of vices on symbolic chariots, where visual images closely followed the literary sources. These images of the mounted vices were diffused primarily by manuscript illuminations, tapestries, and prints. The illumination by Cortese is an interesting reversal of the image, where the personification carries the animal instead of vice versa (Fig. 5). One would naturally wonder where Titian got the idea of depicting 37 See Bloomfield, Seven Deadly Sins, Appendix, 245-9, and Rowland, Animals with Human Faces, on the wolf, 161-7; the lion, 118-23; and the dog, 58-66; with references to medieval and Renaissance literary 38 Hieroglyphica (1556); see chapters on the lion (book I), the dog (book V) and the wolf (book XI), as well as extensive reviews of other animal symbols. 39 Ibid., books IX and XII. 40 For example, Machiavelli: 'uno principe necessitato sapere bene usare la bestia, debbe di quelle pigliare la golpe e il leone' ('Since a ruler, then, must know how to act like a beast, he should imitate both the fox and the lion, for the lion is liable to be trapped, whereas the fox cannot wards off wolves') (The Prince, trans.

Author's photograph bodiless animal heads to express this theme. He did not have to go far. Two fourteenth-century capitals of the Palazzo Ducale, Venice were similarly carved, each portraying a traditional series of vices by nine large heads of animals devouring their prey. The dog, the lion, and the wolf are identified by Latin inscriptions on one of the capitals and are clearly recognizable (Fig. 8). Personified vices on another capital are represented in full figure with the usual attributes.42 The fact that this iconography persisted in Renaissance Venice is demon strated, for example, by an engraving attributed to c. 1470-80, in which seven identical female personifications of the vices are differentiated solely by means of the animal heads that decorate their shields.43 There we find the dog-head associated with Invidia and the wolf-head with Ira, while the full figured lion belongs to Regina Superbia. In 1521 Cesare Cesariano was still using the motif of animal heads to portray sins and vices. His annotated edition of Vitruvius, published at Como, contains an 'autobiographical woodcut' which shows the artist himself among a multitude of bodiless heads, most of them animal, symbolizing the transgressions that are obstacles to his redemption.44 Another element of Titian's Allegory, the association of the Ages of Man 42 This example is not exceptional. A twelfth-century illustration of the chariot of Avaritia from the Hortus Deliciarum shows vices in the form of animal heads superimposed on human busts. Among these are the heads of the dog and the wolf; see Katzenellenbogen, Allegories of Virtues and Vices, pl. XXXVI. 43 See A. M. Hind, Early Italian Engraving (Nendeln, 1970), i, 250-1 and iv, pi. 397. 44 The woodcut is reproduced in M.

Parallels between stereotyped stages of life and the animals which represented them in a satiric vein are often found in Renaissance engravings. The combinations are not always consistent, primarily because the number of ages varies, and due to the fact that the Ages of Man were also related to humours, planets, the zodiac, and so on, which were already linked to their own animal symbols. Consequently, the dog, usually assigned to Youth, could be linked to a later stage of life because of its association with Melancholy.45 The lion, on the other hand, was always an attribute of mid-life, which is characterized by virility and military prowess as well as Superbia and Ira. The rapacious wolf comes later because, according to sources, Avaritia is common to advanced age.46 There are many precedents for the specific parallels used by Titian. TITIAN AND MORAL ALLEGORY: THE PROBLEM DEFINED Titian's visual allegory deals with Christian conceptions of sin in relation to the stages of human existence and to the dimension of time. The basic thematic components - sin, stages of life, and temporality - are interwoven into a visual complex that has yet to be explained in the context of what we know about Titian and Venetian culture of the 1560s. The inscription, which has often been conceived as a caption to the picture, presents an additional problem. Perhaps the first key to the many enigmas of this painting lies in the head of the old man. It has already been noted that its style and technique are different to those of the other two heads. The two younger heads were executed in a more harmonious technique, with smooth areas of colour and softly gradated shadows. This is the style found in many of the commissioned portraits by Titian which were executed between 1540 and 1545. Around 1545 he became freer in his portrait technique, replacing the earlier rigidity of well-defined colour areas and subdued plastic modelling with increased chiaroscuro and luminosity. In addition, the Flemish-type portrait inscrip tions placed above the head of the subject, or occasionally to one side, which may be compared to the Prudentia inscription here, are most common in Titian's work of the 1540s and rarely appear afterwards. It has also been noted that those heads conform with ideal types. The head of the old man, by comparison, is executed in rough, fragment ary brush strokes that give the impression of a spontaneous and unfinished sketch. The angularity and harshness of the features, accentuated by the more spontaneous technique, creates a sense of disjunction, further em reflection in his drawings', in H. C. Smyth (ed.), Michelangelo Drawings (Hanover and London, 1992), 236, fig-9 45 For examples of the Renaissance age/animal analogy in prints, see R. Van Marie, Iconographie de l'art profane (New York, 1971), n, 153-66, figs 188 and 189. For the dog as a representation of Youth, see fig. 183. Regarding the association of temperaments and animals, see R. Klibansky, E. Panofsky, and F. Saxl, Saturn and Melancholy (New York, 1964). 46 See e.g. Ripa, Iconologia, 32.</page><page sequence="17">62 Simona Cohen phasized by the fact that the elder head is not aligned with the other two. In 1966, during the restoration of the painting, X-rays revealed that Titian had painted the elderly head we see today over an earlier version, and in doing so had slightly altered its position (Fig. 2). The animals, which are executed in the same style as the elderly head, did not exist in the earlier version and were added at the same time. Their style, especially the somber chromatic effects built up of multicoloured brush-strokes, is typical of Titian's later years and can be compared to works like the Apollo and Marsyas and the Pie ta. From this evidence, we can tentatively conclude the following. The painting was begun in the 1540s when Titian was in his early to mid-fifties, but the head of the elder executed at that time was subsequently covered over, and the elderly head of the final version as well as the animals were painted more than twenty years later, when Titian was in his seventies. The modification of the old man's head, after so many years, can logically be explained if we assume it to be a self-portrait; but we have more than a hypothesis. In Veronese's Marriage at Cana we probably see Titian in his seventies - an old man with rigid, angular, and sunken features that clearly resemble those painted by Titian in the Allegory (Fig. 4). At the same time one can recognize the parallels with his earlier self-portrait (Fig. 3), which also has the same moustache, beard, and cap, and presents the identical viewpoint. It is here suggested that the original version of the painting contained three human heads representing the Three Ages of Man, with the the inscrip tion elucidating its moralizing message in accordance with contemporary traditions. Two major elements of the final version were missing at that time - the self-portrait of the artist and the beasts. Consequently, it must be assumed that, in the final version, these two elements were interconnected in a new conception that fundamentally altered the original pictorial statement. When Titian harshly sketched his own features as the image of Avaritia, it must have been an act of self-accusation and remorse. Perhaps this partially explains why we can compare his shrivelled likeness to the unbiased im pressions of another artist rather than to the complacent self-portraits of Berlin and Madrid. Why should Titian depict himself in a moralizing allegory which proclaims that man is a sinner? Can the final version of this painting be reconciled with what we know of Titian the man and the artist? The image of Titian which has been educed primarily from his correspondence is one of a pragmatic man, concerned mainly with monetary recompense and the economic security of himself and his family. We know that Titian was largely dependent in literary matters on Pietro Aretino, who was his friend, publicist, manager, and intellectual adviser, all wrapped in one. But we haven't a shred of evidence from contemporary sources regarding his religious beliefs, philosophy, ideas about art, or personal interests. In the following pages I will nevertheless attempt a hypothetical reconstruction of Titian as a man who found himself confronting issues of sin and penitence in his old age.</page><page sequence="18">Titian's London Allegory 63 TITIAN, SENSUALITY, AND SIN The theme of human carnality was implicit in Titian's art, primarily in his interpretations of secular and mythological themes. These paintings ex pressed an unreserved passion for the physical beauties and pleasures of life. His canvases abound in expressions of full-blooded sensuality, lust, and violence. There is a fundamental lack of consensus in modern scholarship regarding iconological implications in these works. Some perceive the various versions of Venus and, a Musician or those of the Danaë, for example, as philosophical or moralizing allegories; others reject the learned alleg orical interpretations and are convinced that the eroticism of Titian's art should be taken at face value.47 A considerable number of mythologies also contain scenes of the hunt, where savagery and violence and analogous allu sions to lechery and sexual aggression derive a semblance of respectability from their association with a classical source. Nevertheless, the imagery itself contains evidence of the fact that Titian was consciously dealing in his art with manifestations of amorality. Titian adapted the image of the dog, as symbol, to religious, secular, and mythological contexts in such disguised forms that it may easily be dismissed as an element of genre irrelevant to the theme. The function of the dog as a symbol of persecution, castigation, or treachery is familiar in Christian religious art, and its increased popularity in sixteenth-century Venice was probably due to Flemish influence.48 Titian allied the dog to Judas as a symbol of treachery in versions of the Last Supper, as Tintoretto would after him.49 A similar meaning applies to the hound, symbol of Christ's tormentors, in the Ecce Homo painted for the Flemish merchant Van Haanen (1543) and the the hunting dog which incon spicuously enters the scene of the Martyrdom of St Lawrence in the Escorial (1568).50 The same idea was adapted by Titian to the late version of Diana and Actaeon (c. 1570-5), where the image of a man with the head of a stag attacked by hunting dogs is iconographically related to the persecution of virtue.51 The motif of a stag attacked by hunting dogs is assigned to the back ground of Titian's mythological scenes, like that of the Pardo Venus,52 where 47 Regarding the spirituality of Titian and the moralizing aspects of his mythological works, see A. Gentili, Da Tiziano a Tiziano. Mito e allegoria nella cultura veneziana del Cinquecento (Milan, 1988), esp. 149-246 and 'Tiziano e il non finito', Venezia Cinquecento, n/4 (1992), 93-127, esp. 125-6. For an opposing view, see e.g. C. Hope, 'Problems of interpretation in Titian's erotic paintings', in Tiziano e Venezia (Vicenza, 1980), 111-24 and other articles in the same volume listed under the title 'La Donna, l'Amore e Tiziano', 41-135. 48 For a thorough study of this theme, see J. Marrow, 'Circumdederunt me canes multi: Christ's tormentors in northern European art of the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance', Art Bulletin, 59 (1977), 167-81. 49 For example, The Last Supper (before 1544), Galleria Nazionale delle Marche, Urbino, and the later version (1555-64) in the Escorial, Nuevos Museos. 50 See F. Polignano, 'I ritratti dei volti e i registri dei fatti. L'Ecce Homo di Tiziano per Giovanni d'Anna', Venezia Cinquecento, n/4 (1992), 7-54. Significantly, the dog and the horse, the latter symbolizing unbridled passion, are lacking in the earlier version of the Martyrdom of St Lawrence in the Gesuiti. 51 The stag or hart represented Christ, as in the legends of St Eustachius or St Hubert. The stag attacked by a dog often represented virtue pursued by evil. See M. Bath, The Image of the Stag (Baden-Baden, 1992), 215-33. For the use of the stag in Titian's painting, see Cohen, 'Animals in the paintings of Titian', 197-202. 52 Regarding the chronology and theme of this painting, see Gentili, Da Tiziano a Tiziano, 149-61.</page><page sequence="19">64 Simona Cohen it is placed behind the satyr accosting a voluptuous nude. Here the hunting dog is associated with violent passion and lust but, as a counterpart of the satyr, he may also retain the connotation of treachery. Beginning with the Venus ofUrbino (1538), Titian executed a series of vol uptuous, reclining nudes; each one with a tiny dog at her feet.53 A comparison of this particular iconography with other examples of the same miniature canine species in Titian's paintings shows that he consistendy used this motif as a symbol of eroticism.54 In several of his mythological paintings the hunting dog and the toy dog both appear, each assuming a different function. In the Edinburgh Diana and Actaeon (1556-9) hunting dogs are the logical attributes of Actaeon, but Diana's toy dog seems out of place in the mythic landscape.55 In combining a violent hunting scene with one of sexual assault, he was juxtaposing two manifestations of bestiality, using two symbolic canine species. Among the other symbolic animals used by Titian in disguised forms, we find, for example, the horse as symbol of unbridled passion in his youthful Sacred and Profane Love (Rome) and the goat and leopard fleece of Luxuria in the Nymph and Shepherd (Vienna) of his later years. Deer and rabbits are often found in pairs in the shadows of his erotic paintings. In the Flaying of Marsyas (Kromënz) of his last years, the reintroduction of two different canine species is curious and yet has received little attention.56 It is significant that Giulio Romano's sketch of the subject, which influenced Titian's version, did not include the dogs. The small dog in the very centre, who licks the blood of the martyred satyr at his feet, and the bloodthirsty hunting dog to the right of the scene symbolize the horrible chastisement. In medieval Passion literature it is said that Christ's tormenters are evil dogs that stand with their sinful feet in his blood.57 Whether or not one accepts the identification of Midas as Titian's self-portrait, the intensity of his inter pretation suggests a strong personal identification with its message. Many years earlier, in 1548, the theme of four condemned sinners had been commissioned from Titian by Mary of Hungary during his stay in Augsburg. Probably under the influence of Michelangelo's sinners of the Last Judgement, which he had seen two years earlier in Rome, Titian depicted the eternal punishment of Tityus, Sisyphus, Tantalus, and Ixion in Tartarus.58 53 This includes the Danae of 1553-4, Venus and Cupid with an Organist (1545-48), Venus and Dog with an Organist (c. 1550), all in the Prado. 54 Cf. Diana and Acteon (1556-59) and the Diana and Callisto (c. 1566), both of Edinburgh. Cf. Flemish examples, such as Memling's Vanitas (Strasbourg), where a nude temptress is accompanied by two different canine species which parallel those of Titian's erotic works. 55 In the version of the story by Nonnus, in Dionysiaca v, a copy of which existed in Venice, Acteon's actions are described as 'the wild daring of a lovesick man'. Driven by passion like a wild beast, he is transformed into one. The dog represents the erotic leitmotif. See M. Tanner, 'Chance and coincidence in Titian's Diana and Actaeori", Art Bulletin, 56 (1974), 535-50. 56 See J.

By magnifying the figures to monumental proportions and creating daring, close-up perspectives, Titian, in his fifties, had already given powerful expression to his own involvement with the theme. TITIAN AND THE CATHOLIC REFORMATION Transformations discernible in the works of Titian's last decade can be linked to his artistic decline and the anxieties of impending death. His ultima maniera has also been treated as an immanent stage in his aesthetic evolution. Without minimizing the importance of these factors, I suggest that Titian was also reacting to the religious upheavals in his immediate environment, upheavals that affected every aspect of Venetian culture and to which no one was immune. The meaning of Titian's Allegory cannot be fully understood without viewing it in this context. Titian's mature career coincided with the events of the Catholic Refor mation, the Council of Trent, and the establishment of the Inquisition. In the early years of the sixteenth century there had been religious stirrings in Venice and issues of spiritual renewal were being discussed by adherents of reform. Many Venetian aristocrats had studied at the University of Padua, where Erasmian ideas were popular. Most of Erasmus's writings were published by Venetian printers, notably by Aldus Manutius and Gregorius de Gregoriis.59 These provided inspiration for preachers and served as the basis for teaching in Venetian schools and elsewhere. It has been emphasized that Venice, partially due to her borders with German lands and her position as a mercantile city, was not only exposed but was actively receptive - 'possibly more than any other city on the peninsula - to Reformation ideas'.60 With the rise of aristocratic power and despotic rule throughout Italy, Venice was considered the bastion of republican freedom, with a reputation for social and cultural diversity and tolerance. It became a haven for men who believed that only there was it possible to realize religious reform. After the sack of Rome, in 1527, some prominent churchmen found refuge in Venice, and the city became a meeting place for 'spiritual' reformers, on the one hand, and upholders of orthodox Catholicism, on the other.61 By the 1540s, however, heretical ideas of reform in Venice had spread to such an extent that Paul III and members of the curia initiated repressive measures. In 1544 the pope sent Monsignor Giovanni délia Casa as nuncio to Venice to represent the Holy Office of the Inquisition there. He initiated a series of arrests, trials, executions, public spectacles of abjuration, and See S. Seidel Menchi, Erasmo in Italia. 1520-1580 (Turin, 1987), esp. 33-6. 60 See J.

In 1547 Doge Francesco Dona appointed patrician magistrates to co-operate with the inquisitors in heresy trials.62 This breach of the Venetian policy of tolerance and liberty was justified by the necessity to combat threats to Venetian stability posed by dissenting heterodox elements. The Venetian printing press, which had been the vehicle for liberal human ism for the past seventy years, and more recently diffused the new vernacular literature as well as that of religious reform, was now used by orthodox Catholic polemicists.63 Delia Casa had begun burning confiscated books in the San Marco square and near the Rialto in 1548. A year later he published his Index of prohibited books.64 The pulpit was a powerful means of diffusing reform ideas, affecting popular culture and popular devotion both in the early years and later, during the worst inquisitorial oppressions. The most influential preacher in Italy in the 1530s was Bernardino Ochino of Siena, whose nine sermons presented in Venice in 1539 had a profound affect not only on the general public but also on intellectuals, like Pietro Bembo, Vittoria Colonna, and Pietro Aretino.65 Aretino came to hear Ochino at Santi Apostoli, wrote of him in great admiration, and subsequently corresponded with the preacher.66 Ochino, after having left the /rati minori osservanti for the Capuchin order, had become their general and held the highest position in the Franciscan reform. He preached a primitive form of Franciscan observance based on extreme poverty, simplicity, austerity, and penitence. In 1541 fifteen of his sermons were printed in Venice, including those heard by Aretino and perhaps Titian, whose religious and professional associations with the Franciscans are well known. We have first-hand evidence regarding the powerful influence of Ochino's sermons on Titian's direct circle, especially on Aretino.67 We will see that several of the leitmotifs used, by Ochino in his sermons can also be found in the completed form of Titian's Allegory, painted about twenty years later. His influence may have been direct or mediated by Aretino, but it is also possible that the ideas had become relevant to Titian much later as he grew older and penitent. In his first sermon in Venice (1539) Ochino had spoken of 'homo animale', saying 'un uomo carnale e come una bestia, non capisce quelle cose che sono de Dio'.68 He called for penitence that begins with introspection - a recognition of one's own sins: 'Noi vogliamo reformar questo uomo carnale, 62 See Martin, Venice's Hidden Enemies, ch. 2, 51-70. 63 See P. F.

In expressions such as 'specchiarsi' and 'occhio vivo del spirito' he used the image of the mirror to express the knowledge of one's sins and defects. In an earlier sermon presented at Lucca (1538) Ochino had several times referred to sins with the tripartite temporal distinction of 'i peccati nostri passati, presenti e futuri'.70 According to Ochino, 'specchiarsi' signified the self-recrimination necessary for spiritual renewal and salvation. It seems to me that all these elements are reflected in Titian's Allegory. Man in the image of a beast (i.e. the self-portrait/beast analogy) is the sinner who contemplates his past, present, and future trans gressions, as if they were reflected in a mirror. Matteo da Bascio was another Capuchin preacher whose call for radical spiritual renewal had lasting effect in Venice, even after his death there in 1552. As an itinerant preacher, whose raging voice was heard in the streets, piazze, and markets of the city, Matteo revived the fundamental themes of Franciscan moral and penitential teaching. Numerous contemporary sources describe his zealous invectives against sinners. He imitated medieval preach ing by using simple and crude language and direct emotional effects. He would instil in his audience the terrors of hell by repeating over and over 'all'inferno i peccatori, all'inferno chi tiene la robba d'altri, al inferno li bestemmiatori, all'inferno i carnali vitiosi' and so on.71 One passage of his invectives says that those who think they can emend their sins when they are old and frail, when they are no longer capable of sinning, they will go to hell.72 When Titian painted his Allegory, Matteo da Bascio had been dead for over ten years, but his message was still very much alive. From the mid-1560s, when Titian was in his seventies, the tribunal increased its activity more than ever. In 1565 about eighty people were denounced as heretics in Venice. In 1566 when the notorious Dominican inquisitor Michele Ghislieri became Pope Pius V, he sent Giovanni Antonio Facchinetti as his nuncio to eradicate heresy in Venice. Facchinetti instigated degrading spectacles of public penance and public punishment. Many Ven etians reacted by going underground. In 1551 a large network of Anabaptists had been exposed in northern Italy, including Venice and Padua. Additional evidence from the 1560s indicates that Nicodemism and Anabaptism were not exceptional phenonema in Venice.73 A Padre Fra Bernardino da Siena dell'Ordine de' Fra Capuccini (1541).

There is no written documentation regarding Titian's convic tions or personal interest in reformatory movements, but it can be shown that Titian was right in the midst of the controversies and upheavals during the last forty years of his life and that the people with whom he was intimately associated were actively involved. The idea that reform conceptions were expressed in some of Titian's paintings is not new, but the assumption that there are related artistic expressions of his own soul-searching process has yet to be explored. In 1534 Titian's close friend Aretino began writing a series of religious works.'4 We have already noted his subsequent admiration for Ochino. By 1543 Aretino stopped writing sacred works out of fear of the Inquisition, but a new edition of those he had published earlier was put out by the Aldine press in 1551. It has been suggested that religious sentiments found in these writings had direct expression in Titian's paintings, especially in the Ecce Homo of 1543 where, according to one theory, there are portraits of Ochino, Aretino, and Alfonso d'Avalos.75 For the last forty-six years of his life Titian's most important patrons were the Habsburgs. Charles V was the secular leader of the battle against Protestantism. After meeting him for the first time in 1530, Titian was at the court in Augsburg in 1547 to paint the equestrian portrait, as the emperor celebrated his victory over the Protestant League. Between 1551 and 1554 the emperor commissioned Titian to paint the Trinity (Prado). The theory that this painting was conceived in response to anti-trinitarianism appears convincing.76 The Trinity demonstrates Counter-Reformation iconography dictated by Charles V. If Titian included his self-portrait behind the Habsburg portraits, as it would appear from the copy engraved by Cornelius Cort (1566-7), then we can presume he was motivated to express his own personal religious sentiments. We know that the Trinity was among the few paintings that Charles took with him when he retired in 1556 to the monastery at Yuste, and that he contemplated the painting in his last hours as El Juicio Final (The Last Judgement). It does comply with the traditions of Last Judgement iconography, at least with the upper half where the elect are depicted before Christ and the Virgin. It appears from this painting that Titian, who was already in his sixties, was thinking of his own redemption. THE THEME OF PENITENCE IN TITIAN'S LATE WORKS Among the main issues taken up by reformers and preachers, even during the post-tridentine period, was the confession of sins and penitence. Paint ings explicitly or implicitly dealing with these themes are among the most personal and original works of Titian's late years. Among the explicit 75 Polignano, 'I ritratti dei void e i registri dei fatti'. 76 See C. S. Harbison, 'Counter-Reformation iconography in Titian's Gloria", Art Bulletin, 49 (1967), 244-6.</page><page sequence="24">Titian's London Allegory 69 themes of penitence are the St Mary Magdalen (lost), the St Jerome (Madrid and the Escorial), and the Pietà (Venice) for his own tomb, which also includes the penitent figure of St Jerome, that of the artist himself, and the pelican which symbolized the 'pentimento de' peccati'." Scenes of mortal punishment include those of martyrs, like the St Lawrence completed in 1567 (Escorial) and the later St Sebastian (St Petersburg) and Crowning with Thorns (Munich), as well as a few mythological episodes, like the Apollo and Marsyas. The latter, which was one of his last works and had no replicas, has often been recognized as a very personal declaration by the artist. The Nymph and Shepherd (Vienna), with its stylistic affinities to the Apollo and Marsyas, was among the late autograph paintings left in the artist's studio after his death. There is a clearly retrospective quality in the theme of the shepherd with his flute and his amorous companion, which recalls the Arcadian works of his youth and especially the Three Ages of Man of c. 1515 (Edinburgh), where the same tree stump appears to the right of the com position. After sixty years Titian again took up the theme of an amorous couple, not with the classical detachment of his youth, but with the anxieties of old age. The goat who devours the last branch and the leopard pelt (cf. the flayed Marsyas), both attributes of Luxuria, together with the tree stump of Death, transform what was once a praise of life into a lamentation of its loss. INITIUM POENITENTIAE COGNITIO PECCATI Although the inscription explicated the theme of the original painting as an allegory of Prudence, its function in the completed version is not clear. Could Titian have left the inscription to imply that man, by virtue of prudence, could overcome his bestial nature? Perhaps the virtuous temporal motto was now meant to be be perceived in ironic juxtaposition to Ochino's 'i peccati nostri passati, presenti e futuri', a leitmotif that aptly describes the three animal heads with their parallel between sins and Ages of Man. Alternatively, we might examine the theory that some unknown restorer uncovered the inscription after it had been painted over by Titian in his final version.78 We can be sure only that after twenty odd years Titian, no longer interested in his earlier theme and impelled by his inexhaustible capacity for renewed perception, saw in the tripartite composition the nucleus of a new visual idea. The painting was transformed into a unique personal expression of the failing artist and, hypothetically, the penitent sinner who at the end of his life found himself in a selva oscura and feared that he had lost the path to Purgatorio.
