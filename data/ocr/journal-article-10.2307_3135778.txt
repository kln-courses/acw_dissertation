<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF SACRED LITERATURE HOW TO INTERPRET OLD TESTAMENT PROPHECY BY I. G. MATTHEWS STUDY II--Continued THE DESTRUCTION OF THE NATIONS PREDICTED I. THE CONDEMNATION OF NATIONAL EVILS Fifth day.-? 26. Amos 6:3-6; Isa. 5:8. Wealth was wrongly used. Read and note that luxury and gluttony existed side by side with poverty and want. Some in their desire for landed estates had not only bought up the houses of their poorer countrymen but had acquired possession of the village commons, so that the poor man lost many of the ancient privileges. In a community where wealth is rapidly increasing there are always some who, with the newly acquired wealth, will abuse themselves or disregard the rights of others, or do both. These prophets have a fine standard of personal and of community ethics. Can we injure any member of a community without affecting the life of the whole ? Can any group or class in society order its life without consideration of all other groups ? Has a man the right to spend his money in any way he may please ? What was the principle on which these prophets condemned the life of their day ? Were they thinking in terms of sociology or of brotherhood ? Sixth day.-? 27. Hos. 4:12-13; Jer. 7:29-31; Ezek. 8:Io-I7. Idolatry and divination were very prevalent. The worship of their Canaanitish neighbors in the early days of their settlement, of the city of Tyre in the early days of the monarchy, and later still of their Assyrian overlords very strongly influenced the religious thought of all classes of Israelites. Many evils, not the least of which was sorcery, came in together with this foreign worship. The leaders from the begin- ning believed that Jehovah was a jealous God who was unwilling to share the hom- age of his people with any other. Note the excesses to which the people had gone. What scorn and irony these men heap on false worship. Have we any idolatry and divination today ? Seventh day.-? 28. Isa. 30:I-5; 3I:1-3. Military alliances were considered more important than faith in Jehovah. At the time when Judah, not without reason, feared an invasion by the great Assyrian army, the leaders sought a mili- tary alliance with Egypt. From the national standpoint this seemed good policy. Read and see how Isaiah clearly saw that Egypt was a "broken reed" on which the small nations could not rely, and he believed that if Judah kept herself free from national intrigues, developed her own life, and had living faith in Jehovah, he 87</page><page sequence="2">88 THE BIBLICAL WORLD would defend her from her enemies. The power of God was greater than that of the most feared enemy. How far could this principle be put into general practice ? II. THE CONDEMNATION OF THE UPPER CLASSES Eighth day.-? 29. Mic. 3:5-7; Jer. 2:8; 5:31; 6:18. Prophet and priest alike were denounced as false. The function of the prophet in the early days was to arouse the national spirit in time of national need. In those days loyalty to Jehovah in the wars of conquest was the chief demand. The eighth- century prophets were convinced that righteousness was the test of loyalty. Not so those who followed in the way of the earlier school. They could not conceive that Jehovah could possibly forsake his people, or that they would not triumph. They believed that the great promises of Jehovah were racially conditioned; the great. prophets believed these promises to have been morally conditioned. Hence the division in the ranks of prophecy. Those whom we today recognize as the true prophets freely called their neighbors false. The priest likewise, because his judgments were not always right and because he thought that sacrifice and religion were synonymous terms, was condemned as a false leader. In the days of conflict when Micaiah and the prophets are opposed to one another (see ? 15 preceding study), how could the com- mon people determine which was the false and which the true ? Have all men moral discernment so that they may distinguish between the false and the true ? May some of these so-called false leaders have been conscientious in their utter- ances ? If "progressive revelation" is true, would the messages of one century be altogether adequate for the following century in the Old Testament times ? Ninth day.-? 30. Mic. 3:9-II; 7:3, 4; Isa. 1:23; 3:12. The rulers and princes were incompetent and dishonest. The picture painted in these extracts is a very black one indeed but no worse than the actual situation. The rule was oriental, and the universality of graft and all types of dishonesty is well known. That the prophets should free themselves from the custom and the system of their day is proof patent of their inspiration. Tenth day.-? 31. Amos 4:1-3; Isa. 3:16-26. The women were frivolous and dissolute. They do not escape the condemnation of these prophets. Read and note that the picture shown is one of utter corruption. When the women of a nation are given over to excess and profligacy, then indeed "the whole head is sick and the whole heart faint." Eleventh day.-? 32. Jer. 24-Io. The poor people when they had oppor- tunity were worse than their lords. After the princes had been carried into captivity in 597 B.C., those who remained behind, mostly poor people, had unusual opportunities. Many of them became leaders in the land. But they seem to have been both incompetent and unjust. Not only were they not better than those who had been carried away, but they were worse. They were the basket of bad figs, so bad that they could not be eaten, says our prophet. All classes from the top to the bottom were corrupt. All were "laden with iniquity, a seed of evil doers, children that deal corruptly. They had forsaken Jehovah and had despised the Holy One of Israel." There were no words too strong to characterize their condition, and no suffering could be too great as punish- ment for their sin. Hence the nation must go into captivity.</page><page sequence="3">AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF SACRED LITERATURE 89 III. THE DESTRUCTION OF ISRAEL AND JUDAH INEVITABLE Because of their moral convictions the prophets were convinced of the cer- tainty of national ruin. The means ordained to bring about this destruction were not always the same. The neighboring nation that at the time possessed the greatest military forces and had the most pronounced world-ambitions was usually, in the hand of God, considered to be the instrument for this accomplish- ment. The Assyrian or the Scythian, the Egyptian or the Babylonian, the one on the horizon at the time usually filled the vision of the seer and made definite his message of destruction. But while the instrument changed the certainty remained. The details of the punishment might not be clear, but the fundamental moral law that the guilty nation must be punished was axiomatic. This certainty became the commonplace of the pre-exilic prophets. A few illustrations out of the many may be carefully studied. Twelfth day.-? 33. Amos 3, 2, II:I15; 5:2, 3, 16-20, 27. The unnamed adversary from beyond Dan and beyond Damascus was no doubt well known to all who heard Amos. The great Assyrian nation was clearly on the horizon. Only a decade before this, Assyria had made, in 773 B.C., a victorious expedition against Damascus. Its army actually did come to Palestine and conquer parts of the country or exact tribute in 738, 734, 722, 7II, and 701 B.C. How complete does the prophet say that the destruction is going to be ? Thirteenth day.-? 34. Amos 8:7-Io0. Note the intensity af Amos' picture. So intense is the terror that nature is represented as in deepest sympathy with bereft Israel. Is this picture of the sun putting on mourning and the earth staggering and reeling under the great calamity to be understood literally or poetically ? Is language ever an adequate medium to express great ideas ? Must not a writer always bring every symbol under tribute to do justice to his thought? Is it any wonder then that this coming tragedy to Israel was expressed in cosmic significance ? Must we be careful about always reading the prophets literally ? Fourteenth day.-? 35. Hos. 2:9-13; 4:3. Hosea prophesied about 740 B.C., perhaps some twenty years later than Amos. However, moral conditions were unchanged, and his picture of destruction is essentially the same as that of the earlier prophet. Compare it with that of Amos, and while the language and much of the imagery differ, showing originality, note that in content it is a duplicate. The punishment that Amos believed to be so imminent that he spoke of it as already accomplished (Amos 5:2) has not yet arrived. Fifteenth day.-? 36. Hos. 7:16; 8:13; 9:6. A pro-Egyptian party existed in Israel at this time. The prophet was indignant that the nation should put its trust in the strength of Egypt rather than in Jehovah, its God. He was sure that it was going to suffer for this. He saw no more appropriate penalty for this sin than that the Israelites should be conquered and taken captive by Egypt herself. But we find later that they suffered from Egypt only in so far as she was not able to help them in their hour of need. Sixteenth day.-? 37. Hos. 9:17; Io:6, 7; II:5, 6. In the first verse the destination of the captives is very general among the nations. In the other two passages the vision seems clearer. They are not going to go to Egypt. Assyria is their destination. How can we account for this difference between the passages</page><page sequence="4">90 THE BIBLICAL WORLD for the fifteenth and the sixteenth days? Would difference in time help to solve the question ? Did Hosea see more clearly the details of the days ahead in the sixteenth study than in the earlier one ? If so, what would that indicate as to prediction ? Was he as much interested in the details as in the moral principle ? Do these variations invalidate his ethical message ? Assyria must have been at the time of the writing of this on the move westward. The conclusion here is very accurate. Was it not very likely to have been based on the knowledge of the historic facts ? Could predictions as accurate be made of the termination of the present great world-war ? Seventeenth day.-? 38. Isa. 7:I10-25. This passage belongs to 734 B.C. Tribute had been paid to the Assyrian in 738 B.c. But Israel and Judah had scarcely suffered. The doom had in no way been adequate to the transgression, and the condemnation is as lurid as ever. Judah, however, is now of special interest, for the prophet is a native of Jerusalem. There is no doubt in his mind the Assyrian is the avenger of Jehovah. In fact, the enemy must at this time have been almost to the gate of Damascus. Compare the picture here with that of Amos and Hosea respectively. Note the poetic imagery and the originality. Eighteenth day.-? 39. Isa. 5:26-30; 10: 5, 6, 28-32. The Assyrian army, the "rod" of the anger of Jehovah, is on the march. General characteristics are found in the first section to be studied. In the last section we find the road the army might have taken in the land of Palestine. Isaiah is painting a picture. The Assyrians are coming. He does not know yet by what route, but only that they will soon be near. Nineteenth day.-? 40. Mic. 3: 12; Isa. 37: 21-35. The utter destruction of Jerusalem is the climax of the message of Micah. No conditions are indi- cated in his drastic utterance. The city is the cesspool of iniquity to his mind, and its complete overthrow alone will meet the demands of a moral God. The study in Isaiah comes from a historical section which may not in its present form have come from the pen of the prophet. There is no doubt, however, that it contains the historical fact. It is quite possible that Isaiah in the hour of the extremity of Jerusalem believed that Jehovah would defend his heritage. The message of Isaiah and the deliverance of the city would come from a time shortly after that of Micah. How can two messages to the same people at almost if not quite the same time be so diametrically opposite ? Would it seem that those who preserved and canonized the writings of the prophets had any theory of inspira- tion that made it necessary for all details to be in agreement ? Twentieth day.-?41. Jer. 5:15-19; 6:22-26. This study comes from about 626 B.C. Since the time of Isaiah when the North Kingdom was conquered and many of the people carried away captive, the South had continued its inde- pendence. A great religious reaction against Jehovah worship took place in the time of Manasseh. The normal conditions had in nowise improved, and religious rites that were abhorrent to the true prophets were introduced. Hence the rebellious and apostate nation must fall. During the early days of Jeremiah the Scythian hordes (see an encyclopedia) were overrunning Mesopotamia and threat- ening the land of Palestine, and they became the terror even of the Egyptians. These sections show clearly that Jeremiah expected that Judah was going to be punished for her sins by these people. The way they ravished the country</page><page sequence="5">AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF SACRED LITERATURE 91 (5:I7), their battle array (6:23), the dismay they caused (6:24-25), their far- distant home, and their language (5: I5)-all these find their most adequate background in the feared Scythian attacks. Furthermore at this time Babylon as a fighting force was scarcely on the Palestinian horizon. History, however, is quite clear that these people wrought no serious damage to Judah. Twenty-first day.-? 42. Jer. 9:10-2i; 15:1-4. It is difficult to date these passages with assurance. They are probably earlier than 604 B.C. They thus are twenty years later than the preceding study. The Scythians are no longer a menace, for they have retired back to the North, leaving only a few traces of their inroads on the South. But coming calamity is no less certain to the prophet now than hitherto. Armies may fade away without fulfilling their supposed task, but moral principles are ever operative. Note that the curse is coming because of the sins of Manasseh. In how far are people punished for the sins of their ancestors ? Twenty-second day.-? 43. Jer. 20:3-6; 25: 8-Io. These passages belong to 597 and 604 B.C. respectively. Nebuchadrezzar was the king on the Babylonian throne. This was by this time the great world-power of the North. Assyria had fallen, and her western outposts had gone into the hand of her successor. The armies of Nebuchadrezzar had already defeated those of Egypt at Carchemish. Babylonia was therefore the overlord of Palestine. The result of intrigues, of which Jeremiah no doubt was aware, would inevitably bring the Babylonian armies to the West to reduce them to subjection. Undoubtedly the moral degener- acy and religious apostasy of the nation were to Jeremiah adequate cause for the coming disaster. The army of Nebuchadrezzar which came in 597 B.C. re- duced the country to vassalage and deported Io,ooo of the chief people of the land. IV. FOREIGN NATIONS LIKEWISE MUST SUFFER FOR THEIR SINS While Israel occupied a place of special privilege and responsibility in the thought of the prophets, yet the principles of morality are of universal application. The nations that received chief condemnation were, as was natural, those that lay in closest proximity to Israel. They and their guilt were better known than others. The vision of the prophet, however, at times sweeps the known world and brings within its scope even those who were on the farthest boundaries. The sins for which they are condemned are essentially the same as those laid up against Israel. The condemnation, as in the case of Israel, constantly varies. A few passages will indicate the interest and the spirit of these predictions. Twenty-third day.-? 44. Amos 1:3-2:3. This passage from the first writing prophet (760 B.C.) is now quite familiar to the student. Note the nations that are cursed. They are close on the borders of the Holy Land. The prophet is quite familiar with their evils. What punishment is to be visited on each nation ? The terms are very general. They stand for those evils that most frequently swept those nations. The sword, fire, famine, pestilence, were all well known and frequent visitors. The definite details of the visitations, the when or the how, are not suggested. But as sin is there it must be punished. Twenty-fourth day.-? 45. Ezek. 35: '-15. Jacob and Edom had an age- long feud (Gen. 27:41). Almost every prophet visits his wrath upon the Edomites. Amos in 760 B.c., Isaiah in 720 B.c., Jeremiah in 597 B.c., Obadiah in 586 B.c. or later, Ezekiel in the preceding passage in 585 B.c., Malachi in 450 B.C. or later, and</page><page sequence="6">92 THE BIBLICAL WORLD other prophetic writings that seem to belong to the second century B.c., all utter their judgment that Edom is in the immediate future going to suffer very great disaster. In the foregoing study she is to be a perpetual desolation, and her cities shall never be inhabited. Yet century after century passed, and as late as the time of Christ, we find Edom occupying important territory in the south of Judah herself. Her history is somewhat obscure. Sometime before 400 B.c. she did suffer at the hands of the Nabataeans, who, pushing in from the desert, drove her from Petra, her capital. In 164 B.c. and again in Io9 B.C. she was defeated by the leaders of the Jewish forces, but this was only temporary. Twenty-fifth day.-? 46. Isa. 20: i-6. The historical situation is very defi- nite. From contemporary annals we know that it was in 711 B.c. that Sargon besieged and took Ashdod. We also know the local politics of the day. Judah and some of the small neighboring nations had formed an alliance with Egypt for the purpose of holding the Assyrian at bay. Isaiah, consistent with his general attitude, declared, as we have read, that this alliance with Egypt, though it seems that at this time there was a new and apparently very strong dynasty on the Egyp- tian throne, would be of no avail. History, however, knows of no Assyrian inva- sion of Egypt for a full generation after this time. All the evidence goes to prove that verse 4 was not literally fulfilled. Yet Isaiah's message was not in vain. Egypt may not have suffered in the way the prophet thought she would, but she did not save Israel from the punishment Jehovah had ordained for his people. Twenty-sixth day.-? 47. Jer. 46:13-26. This message comes from the time of the reign of Nebuchadrezzar (604-561 B.c.), probably about the year 586 B.c. The destruction described is not only thoroughgoing and certain, but it is immediate. The people are to be carried into captivity, and the chief cities of Egypt are to be burned, so that there may be no inhabitant dwelling in them. It was no wonder that the writer conceived Egypt to be the destination of the armies of Babylonia. On the one hand this was the only power that challenged the world-supremacy of the ambitious military nation of the East; on the other the sins of Egypt were surely worthy of the severest punishment. But the words seem again to have run before the literal facts. It is true that it would be some- what hasty to argue, from the silence of all the documents of this period, that there was no invasion. But that there was any invasion which brought to Egypt and her cities the disaster spoken of in this section is utterly out of the question. Twenty-seventh day.-? 48. Ezek. 29:I1-4; 30: 13-19. These selections belong to about the same time as the previous study. Note that they are even more drastic in their portrayal of Egyptian overthrow. As the prophecy is against a definite ruler of the house of Egypt, no doubt the hand of the destroyer is the same as that indicated in Jeremiah. Ezekiel also expects Nebuchadrezzar to conquer the land of the Nile. Notice the strange statement in 29:II, 12. The land is to be desolate without inhabitants for forty years, and then the Egyptians are going to be gathered back from the various countries where they were scattered. That this occurred is unthinkable. That there should be "no more a prince from the land of Egypt" scarcely corresponds to history. It is true that Egypt had passed the zenith of her glory, and that from now on her powers and hopes were fast dwindling. But her end lay centuries ahead. Locate on a map the cities named in the second section.</page><page sequence="7">AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF SACRED LITERATURE 93 Twenty-eighth day.-? 49. Isa. i9: 18-25. Cumulative evidence indicates that though this passage is found in the Book of Isaiah it was not written by the great eighth-century prophet. In fact, it may be the very latest utterance in the Old Testament that touches Egypt. Note the difference of tone between this and the foregoing. Apparently Jehovah is known in Egypt through some of his people who are residents there, and through them Egyptians are to be won to the true worship. Sum up the features of ritual that are mentioned here. Account for the changed attitude toward Egypt. Why does the writer place Israel third ? Make a comparison of the spirit dominating this and the other passages on Egypt that have been studied. Twenty-ninth day.-? 50. Ezek. 26:1-21. Ezekiel wrote this, as we see from the first verse, in 586 B.C. We know that about this time Nebuchadrezzar began his famous siege of Tyre. Notice how definite and how detailed the writer is. The picture is complete. Gather up the various statements that declare that Tyre is to fall. How irrevocable is her fate. The army of the great king cannot be gainsaid. Her sins are worthy of no less evil than that so graphically portrayed. Thirtieth day.--? 51. Ezek. 29:17-21. This was written in the twenty- seventh year of the captivity, that is, in 570 B.C. It is the latest paragraph in the book. It seems to be a codicil, as the next latest date is 572 B.C. Very naturally it is attached to chapter 29, as it in part refers to Egypt. Read it very carefully and then compare it with the previous study. The history of the intervening sixteen years is well known. For thirteen years Nebuchadrezzar had laid siege to Tyre. But owing to her access to the sea he had been unable to reduce her. Three years before this paragraph was penned he had withdrawn his armies and the siege had been raised. If we read Ezekiel's message of 586 B.C. literally and think of it as the writing of history in advance of events, then he surely suffers eclipse by the facts. But Ezekiel did not seem to worry about this. Had he considered his earlier message fundamentally wrong, could he not at this time have eliminated it ? Did he regard his own words as Scripture ? Did he know anything about a doctrine of verbal inerrancy? What must be our principle of interpretation to meet the facts ? Summary.-The prophets very clearly saw the iniquity of their own and other nations. They were obsessed by the certainty that punishment must fall on the guilty. The coming doom always seemed immediate to them. Though they use the historical movements of their own day to illuminate and to enforce their mes- sages, they do not pretend to write history beforehand. Were we to make this claim for them the evidence, as we have seen, would sadly reflect on the accuracy of many of their statements. But such was not their purpose, and so to interpret them would be unfair. Such would have been a very insignificant task that might well be left to wizards who "peep and mutter." Their effort was far worthier. It was to cleanse the life of the people from the prevailing corruption, to quicken the moral conscience of the nation, to inculcate faith in Jehovah, and to render Israel a people worthy of the favor of God. Beyond that they have achieved the enviable position of being the most passionate, the clearest-sighted, and the most vital preachers of ethical and religious truth of all pre-Christian teachers.</page><page sequence="8">94 THE BIBLICAL WORLD QUESTIONS FOR REVIEW i.

STUDY III PREDICTION AND FULFILMENT I. PREDICTIONS RELATING TO INDIVIDUALS The pre-exilic prophets addressed themselves chiefly to the nation or nations. Group consciousness always precedes consciousness of the individual. So, only slowly, did the message to the individual become prominent in the Old Testament. The prophets came into contact with various kings, who were representative of the nation and warned them and often explicitly predicted their doom. Fre- quently they found themselves in direct conflict with influential leaders and rebuked them in no uncertain way. The personal temper of the prophet is often much in evidence. Irony, righteous indignation, scorn, and blazing anger are seen in these personal interviews. The wrath of heaven is invoked against these shortsighted leaders. Often the denunciations are in very general terms; some- times very picturesque and apparently very definite. Often because of scanty records we hear nothing more about the victim and hence can say nothing about the detailed fulfilment. At other times we can follow in detail the course of the culprit. In the following study we shall attempt to discover whether the same general principles hold in relation to predictions against individuals. First day.-? 52. Amos 7:10-17. Amaziah the priest is cursed by Amos the prophet. This is the only reference we have to this priest. Amos had made a drastic attack on the sacrifices and offerings, and had scored the national leaders</page><page sequence="9">AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF SACRED LITERATURE 95 on account of their self-indulgence and depravity. Read 5:21-23 and 6:1-5. The priest reported to the king, and then ordered Amos to go back to his own country. The reply of the prophet is personal and full of passion. Note the four curses of vs. 17. They are such as commonly followed in the trail of the conqueror of those days. They were not new nor strange to those people. This was written about 760 B.c. The northern nation was conquered in 722 B.c., but suffered then the woes of war very lightly. Later, in 7I iB.c., after a revolt, they were punished much more severely. While it is not beyond the range of possibility that some or even all of these curses fell on the family of the priest in one or the other of these conquests, we have no definite information. It might be questioned if, after forty years, the family would have remained intact so that this could have been carried out literally. However, this would be scarcely a necessary demand of interpretation. The captivity came, the people did suffer, and those who remained of the priestly descendants scarcely escaped the general calamity. Second day.-? 53a. Isa. 22:15-25. Shebna is to be deposed and exiled. The reason for the attitude of Isaiah is not far to seek. Shebna held the important office of governor of the palace and has manifested an aggressive arrogance. He is building his private sepulcher in a very prominent place and is surrounding himself with a gorgeous retinue. Read vss. i6, i8. Further, as his name indicates he is a foreigner, probably a Syrian. Small and backward peoples have frequently found it necessary to call in from their more advanced neighbors experts in finance and organization. When such servants of state assume airs they are never likely to be popular with home talent. It is quite possible that Isaiah had another grievance. At this time there was in Jerusalem a very strong pro-Egyptian party that was conscientiously opposed by Isaiah. This foreigner may have allied himself with this party and thus been working against what the prophet believed to be the only safe policy for his people. The history in Kings helps us here. Read II Kings i8: I8, 26, 37, and note that at the time of the invasion of Sennacherib, 701 B.c., Shebna is a royal secretary and no longer the governor of the palace. Our study in Isaiah was probably written sometime before 701 B.c. It would seem that the post of secretary was not so important as that of governor. Such a removal would come to the proud upstart as a very great indignity. We may surely look on it as adequately meeting the spirit of the indignation of the prophet. Would such an utterance on the part of a man who was very influential in high circles in the city help to bring about its own fulfilment ? Third day.-? 53b. Re-read Isa. 22: 20-23. Eliakim is to be promoted. The promise of Shebna's high office is given to Eliakim, a good Hebrew, presumably a friend of the prophet. The great importance of the office is indicated in vss. 21, 22. The fact that Eliakim did occupy this position of authority, and that appar- ently shortly after the prediction, is seen in the history recorded in II Kings I8:26, 37. Verses 24, 25 indicate the condition of a later time. Verse 24 may be history. All the relatives of Eliakim had become attached to him and his office, thereby becoming petty grafters on the state. Favoritism toward relatives was quite the usual thing in oriental countries. The office-bearer has again become a disappointment, and as a result of his unfaithfulness the prophet asserts his downfall. It is the old story. The prophet's sense of downright justice demands</page><page sequence="10">96 THE BIBLICAL WORLD that the man who has been derelict to his duty should be removed from his position of trust. Faithlessness on the part of man will be met by retribution on the part of God. We have no light on the later history of Eliakim. We cannot doubt that the great moral law was effective in his case, as always. Fourth day.-? 54. Isa. 38:1-8. Hezekiah's life is prolonged. While this is incorporated in the Book of Isaiah there are indications that the present literary form came from a time considerably after the events described. That is, at the time of its writing in this form it was a memory rather than a prediction. Two things are here combined, the returning health of Hezekiah and the deliverance of the city. We know the city was delivered and that the king lived and reigned for about fifteen years longer. Here we see one phase of the prophetic conception of prediction. The sick king is in imminent danger of death. He prays and weeps. God hears his petition and grants him a lease of fifteen more years. God was the sovereign ruler of His people, but he was not indifferent to their wants, their needs, their conduct. The prayers of a righteous man availeth much. Fifth day.-? 55. Jer. 20:1-6. Pashhur the priest is cursed. Pashhur was a name of ill omen to Jeremiah. Apparently another man of the same name was influential in landing the prophet in the dungeon (Jer. 38:1-6). The episode between the priest and Jeremiah is very vivid, very human. No love was lost on either side. It was rather undignified to find the priest slapping the face of the prophet, and putting him to the torture of a night in the stocks. But if Jeremiah controlled himself the better he was none the less passionate. The night in the stocks did not cool his temper. Upon being liberated he renamed and roundly cursed his persecutor. When we consider that the Hebrews regarded names with great superstitition, believing that they indicated and might even influence character, this grotesque name meaning "terror on every side" was no laughing matter. Did it become popular? If so, what chagrin must have been the constant experience of this temple official? But Jeremiah does not stop with the renaming of his adversary. He insists as vigorously as before in the certainty of captivity and adds the personal note, that Pashhur and his family will be carried out with the others. This was perhaps uttered about 597 B.c. We know that the same year and again in 586 B.c. captives were carried away to Babylon. The detailed fate of Pashhur, so far as we know, no historian deemed of sufficient importance to record. Sixth day.-? 56. Jer. 22:1-12; Ezek. 19:2-4. Jehoahaz is to die in a foreign land. Read the story of how Jehoahaz or Shallum, the king, referred to by both the foregoing prophecies, was crowned king by the people, after his father Josiah was killed in battle by Pharaoh-necho of Egypt in 608 B.C. (II Kings 23:28-33). The Egyptian ruler at once sent a force to Jerusalem, took Jehoahaz captive, set up his older brother as king and finally carried the deposed monarch to Egypt. Compare the statements of both prophets cited above. Ezekiel simply states the historic fact through the medium of striking imagery. Jeremiah goes farther and predicts that he will not return. Considered in conjunction with the general trend of this prophet's teaching, this may be taken as indicating that the ruin of the nation is going to be so complete that there will be no place, no people, no condition in the land of his fathers that would render his return attract- ive. To die and be buried in a strange land was to these people a great calamity, Gen. 46: 29-31.</page><page sequence="11">AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF SACRED LITERATURE 97 Seventh day.-? 57. Jer. 22:13-19. Jehoiakim must suffer the penalty of his misrule. In these days (608-597 B.C.), the kingdom was fast disintegrating. As is frequent in such cases, the people gave themselves up to all kinds of license. In this the king was the leader. He heavily taxed the people, lived in palatial splendor, and violently attacked the prophets. Read in the selection for the day Jeremiah's picture of his arrogance, oppression, and unfaithfulness. The prophetic anger blazes forth. If the universe is morally conditioned such a king must meet with dire punishment. The untimely end and the desecrated grave were looked on by the Hebrews as the climax of disgrace and disaster. Nothing less than this is adequate punishment for such a leader. He will have no funeral lament, no adequate and dignified sepulture. "Buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast beyond the gates of Jerusalem" is the climax of Jeremiah's scornful contempt for the man who had burnt his first roll. Read the story in Jer., chap. 36. His end came in 597 B.C., when Nebuchadrezzar took the city. II Kings 23:36-24:6 states that he slept with his fathers, which would seem to indicate that he was buried in the royal sepulcher. II Chron. 36:6 tells us that the Babylonian king bound him in fetters to carry him to Babylon. In the face of these three state- ments no certainty can exist as to all the details of his death and burial. The words of Jeremiah, however, were no doubt fully vindicated, if not in the letter then in the spirit. Eighth day.-? 58. Jer. 22:24-30. Jehoiakin will never return to Palestine. This king, not Jehoiakim but his son Jehoiakin (Coniah), ruled only three months (597 B.C.). While he could not have achieved much one way or another in the life of his nation he seems to have made a very bad impression on Jeremiah. Read Jer. 22: 24-30. He is so unworthy that not only will his return to Palestine be out of the question, but none of his posterity will ever occupy the throne of David. The sequal to the first part of this prediction is found in his continued captivity in Babylonia, II Kings 25:27-30. Its realization was in the letter as well as in the spirit. Ninth day.-?59. Jer. 34:I-4; 24:8-o10; Ezek. 12:12, I3; 21:25-27. Zedekiah must go captive to Babylon. He was the last king of Judah (597-586 B.C.). Though crowned as a vassal of Babylon, the strong group of pro-Egyptian leaders in the city had swept this weak, vacillating monarch into anti-Babylonian alliances. Final rebellion on the part of Jerusalem in 587 B.C. brought the army of Nebuchadrezzar swiftly against the city. Both prophets saw nothing but ruin. Not only did the military strength of Babylon declare it, but the moral condition, covenant breaking, and rebellion-Ezek. 27:19-assured it. Read the words of the prophets in the passages assigned. Tenth day.-? 60. Jer. 38:17-23. Zedekiah may save himself and the city. Read the interview which took place a short time, perhaps a very few days, before the fall of the city. Note the conditions. Do they not imply that adequate evidence of true repentance is the only condition on which there can be any clemency ? Only such capitulation could possibly have saved the king and the city. Jeremiah seems to find no difficulty between this and the foregoing study. May his messages, though couched in the form of predictions, be fundamentally strong appeals for right action and right living ? Eleventh day.-~? 6i. II Kings 25:1-7. Zedekiah's actual punishment. In July, 586, the city wall was breached, Zedekiah fled, was captured, carried to</page><page sequence="12">98 THE BIBLICAL WORLD Riblah, witnessed there the death of his sons and had his eyes put out, and then was carried to Babylon. Prediction was fulfilled in a very drastic way. Compare Ezek. I2:I2, 13, with the punishment received. In verse 12 the king is repre- sented as drawing his mantle over his face for the purpose of disguise. Verse 13 adds, "yet shall he not see it." Old Testament students differ in interpretation. Some find it to be a late insertion, echoing the actual history. Others deem it to be a prophetic intuition of the coming blindness, which was a not unusual barbarity visited on captives. Twelfth day.-? 62. Jer. 44:29-30. Pharaoh Hophra will be dethroned. Pharaoh Hophra ruled from 588 to 569 B.c. He was constantly in the midst of intrigues, and like so many Egyptian monarchs was finally deposed by one of his officers. He was strangled a few years later. Read the prophetic utterance concerning him in 44:29, 30. It is generally recognized that this section of this book came from a later time than that of Jeremiah. Yet it doubtless echoes a statement of this prophet. Jeremiah was an ardent opponent of any alliance with Egypt. He was indignant with the pro-Egyptian party and no doubt with Egypt when, on the occasion of Nebuchadrezzar's raising the siege of Jerusalem to meet the approaching Egyptian army, the masters in the city pressed their recently liberated slaves back into service, Jer. 34:8-i I. Thirteenth day.-? 63. Jer. 28:1-17. Hananiah will die within a year. Read this interesting story in which we are introduced to the leader of a group who were stimulating rebellion against Babylon. Hananiah publicly declares that within two years there will be complete restoration, vss. 3, 4. Jeremiah sees no such happy end. Such would be contrary to the deepest convictions of more than thirty years of public ministry and would nullify his moral judgments. Yet he is not hasty. He asserts a fundamental principle, vss. 9-II, and departs. Later, shall we say after pondering deeply on the situation, after much meditation and prayer, he is assured that the conditions are not ripe for peace and that those who would stop the nation short of true penitence must surely suffer the penalty of false leadership. Hananiah must die within a year, vss. 13-17. It is noteworthy that the requirements of the law for such cases demanded this. Read Deut. 13:5. Fourteenth day.-? 64. Jer. 29:21. False prophets in Babylon are to suffer. Zedekiah, Ahab, and Shemiah were in captivity in Babylon and sought to keep alive the national spirit in Jerusalem by writing letters to their fellow-countrymen there predicting the speedy overthrow of their captor. Only a partial view of the situation could justify such a conclusion on their part. It was true that the Babylonian empire was of recent date and that there were foes without and disturbances within. But there was organizing ability and splendid vitality in the new empire. Thus the saner conclusion was that the empire would not only survive the attacks of her enemies, but would naturally punish foes without and rebels within. Upon Shemiah judgment is pronounced by the prophet in the most general terms. In the case of the other two it is couched in a very usual form of suffering inflicted on the guilty. History gives us no further record. Fifteenth day.-? 65. Jer. 39:1 5-18. Ebed-melech is going to be delivered. This dark-skinned slave was to Jeremiah an angel of light. In contrast to Jewish officialdom his human fellow-feeling is brought out vividly in his rescue of Jeremiah. Read the story in Jer. 38:1-13. Such an act, which was an indication of the</page><page sequence="13">AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF SACRED LITERATURE 99 character of the man, cannot go unrequited. We are not informed of the fulfil- ment of this promise, but it is quite within the range of possibility that Jeremiah who stood in such favor with the Babylonians may have assisted in the realization of his own words. Sixteenth day.-? 66. Isa. 4I:25-27; 44:24-45:13. Cyrus will liberate the captives. In all the foregoing studies the prophets have spoken to, or of, the men of their own day. There is now very general agreement that chapters 40 and following of this book do not belong to the same Isaiah who wrote the earlier chapters. The whole scene has changed and the writer of these chapters is clearly living in the days of the Babylonian captivity. He is a great unnamed herald who definitely predicted the collapse of Babylon and the conquest of Cyrus at a time shortly preceding the actual facts. The value of the message is not lost because we do not know the name of the author. The prediction came as a living message to those who in their own days could be certain of its accuracy. No doubt the prophet knew the great international movements of his own day. Cyrus had been on the world-horizon since 549 B.c. Rapidly he had conquered Media, Persia, Northern Mesopotamia, and Lydia, and then in 538 B.c. he directed his attention to Babylon. Read the prophet's assurance of the outcome in the selections chosen. History tells us that Babylon readily capitulated. The prophet's message, written we know not how long before the actual overthrow, pointed out to these captives the hand of God manifested specially for their sakes. The fulfilment of their hopes is chronicled in Ezra i:1-4. Seventeenth day.-Group and re-read selections in ?? 53b, 54, 74. Find the theme of general agreement in all. What is the relation of the prophet to each man? What is the character of each man? These were not cold academic discussions, but were warnings and promises flashing with just anger; vital, throbbing with moral and spiritual personal conviction. Eighteenth day.-Group and re-read selections in ?? 52, 53a, 55, 62. Then consider the same questions regarding them as on the seventeenth day. Nineteenth day.-Group and re-read selections in ?? 56-59. Raise the same questions as on the preceding days. Were these kings taken as representatives of the nation, who not only shared the guilt of the nation but must suffer punish- ment with the nation ? Twentieth day.-Group and re-read selections in ?? 62, 63. How did the prophets stand in relation to the law of the land ? Do they naturally run serious risks by their utterances ? Twenty-first day.-Group and re-read selections in ?? 53b, 60. How far did the fulfilment of the prophet's blessing or the obviation of his course lie in the hand of the individual receiving it ? II. THE PROPHETS' CONCEPTION OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF PREDICTION Further light may be gained on the general principles underlying prediction, if we can find out what view these men themselves held in regard to this phase of their message. Were they engrossed in the literal fulfilment of the details, or did they think of their messages in the large ? When they spoke of the things that must come to pass in respect to any nation or any individual, were they</page><page sequence="14">100 THE BIBLICAL WORLD revealing the policy of God for the future, or were they declaring the mind of God toward human conduct ? Did they think of themselves as soothsayers, or as the exponents of moral truths that were of universal application ? Material to answer these questions is very abundant. Twenty-second day.-? 67. Jer. 18: i-io. Prediction is always conditional. Note the method God uses to teach His servant a great lesson. Very humble processes suggested new truth. In the workshop of the potter Jeremiah is taught the methods of the divine. Is it not quite clear from this study that no curse, no blessing, no prediction, made by a prophet is considered absolutely final ? All such are contingent on character. An excellent illustration of this is found in the story and experience of Jonah. Read the stories contained in this book and note that in each case a change of attitude on the part of the people concerned brought a change of purpose on the part of God. Twenty-third day.-? 68. Jer. 26: i2, 13. The chief end of prediction is to bring repentance. The tone of the word of Jeremiah is very well known. His prediction of coming ruin may be indicated in a single verse, "I will make Jerusalem heaps, a dwelling-place of jackals; and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without inhabitant," 9: iI. This study indicates that the fundamental purpose of all the messages of this prophet was to lead the nation to amend its ways and its doings and to obey the voice of Jehovah their God. It is easy to understand how the lurid proclamation of the coming wrath of God, in terms that were most definite and local, would work on the minds of many who would be untouched by less drastic utterances. The fact that all the efforts of these men, all phases of their preaching and prediction were bent toward the purification of the moral and religious life of their people, places them in the very forefront of leadership the world over. Twenty-fourth day.--?69. Ezek. I2: 21-28. Prediction is unfailing and immediate. Ezekiel seems to be very confident that the predicted ruin is on the immediate horizon. So thought many of the prophets at many different times. That the disaster could be long delayed when the cup of iniquity was full to over- flowing they could not conceive. They were confident of the unfailing retribution of a moral God. They were not always aware of the contingencies in the case. Compare this study with the study for the twenty-second day. How are we going to relate the one to the other ? Does the one state a general principle, while the other contains only a partial illustration of the principle ? Must we not bring the individual illustration under the general principle ? We know from history that Jerusalem fell in about five years after the words of Ezekiel. Can we, however, conceive that conditions might have arisen which would have prevented this disaster, as for instance in the case of Jonah and his prediction ? If such had happened would the message of Ezekiel still have had value? If so, what is the fundamental value of prediction ? Twenty-fifth day.-- 70. Deut. 13:1-5. Religion and morals are funda- mental in prediction. This book, which was the basis of the great reformation under Josiah in 621 B.C. (read the story in II Kings, chaps. 22, 23) was very influ- ential during the last days of the monarch. Read Deut. 13:1-5 and note that the power of wonder-working and predicting the future, even on the part of a man who is not a good man, is not questioned. It is actually assumed, but the test</page><page sequence="15">AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF SACRED LITERATURE 101 of the true prophet is not to be found in this type of activity. What are the tests that Deuteronomy puts forward ? Note how adequate these safeguards are for true religion. They are not artificial or superficial distinctions; they go to the very heart of the moral and the religious life, and they furnish us a working basis for the present day, provided that we interpret them in the light of scientific facts which were not known to the prophet. Twenty-sixth day.-? 71. Jer. 28:7-8; Mic. 3:8. The test of the prophet. The prophet in the past has always declared a coming disaster. Such, says Jeremiah (28:7-9), is sign enough of the validity of a prophet's message. But the prophet who prophesieth peace is in a different class. Only when his word comes to pass is it certain that he was sent of Jehovah. Read Mic. 3:8 in which he has admirably epitomized the pre-exilic prophet's estimate of his mission. They were all mighty men for the purpose of declaring to Jacob his transgression and to Israel his sin. This clearly distinguished them from the flattering court prophets. Twenty-seventh day.-? 72. Deut. 18: 20-22. The test of the false prophet. It is not easy to interpret these verses. They are surely an incomplete statement of the case. If we take verse 22 as the statement of a general principle, then what shall we do with Jonah and Jeremiah and Ezekiel and others who cannot stand this test ? But it cannot be the statement of a universal principle, for it overlooks the fact that all prediction is conditional. On the other hand, it does not recognize the conception that false prophets may predict accurately. To what situation then does it apply ? In part, at least, it is directed against those who "speak in the name of other gods," vs. 20. Read the characterization of the true prophet in verses 15-19. In the light of this may not verses 20-22 refer to those false prophets who, like Hananiah, predicted the welfare of their country without any regard to her morals ? All the evidence at our disposal indicates that to be the case and there is therefore no contradiction in spirit between this and the study of the preceding day. This passage assumes that the message of those men who preached coming ruin for a sinful people was its own vindication, and it demands that the message of those men who, neglectful of moral conditions, preached "peace, peace " should not be accepted as the word of Jehovah until it was accred- ited by history. Twenty-eighth day.-? 73. Lam. 2:17; Isa. 52:9; 54:7, 8. Prophetic con- ception of fulfilment. Lamentations seems to have been written during or immediately after the siege of Jerusalem in 586 B.c. and this section of Isaiah still later. Both writers find in this overthrow the adequate fulfilment of the word of Jehovah through former prophets. Twenty-ninth day.-? 74. Isa. 46:11. Precisely the same idea is dwelt on here. "Remember the former things of old, .... declaring the end from the beginning, .... My counsel shall stand." Thirtieth day.-? 75. Zech. 7:8-14. This was written in 518 B.C. In it is seen the same attitude as in the last two sections. The former prophets have been fulfilled. The captivity was to Zechariah and the author of Isa., chaps. 40-55, the complete vindication of the claim that they spoke the word of Jehovah. Summary.-It is instructive to note that there was no laboring over the minutiae of the correspondence between the predictions and the fulfilment. Fire,</page><page sequence="16">102 THE BIBLICAL WORLD sword, pestilence, destruction by the Scythians, captivity under the Assyrians, under the Egyptians, under the Babylonians, Jerusalem a heap of ruins, the land a desolate wilderness-such were the words of the predictions. Were they ful- filled ? From a superficial standpoint, no. From the standpoint of the prophets of the sixth century B.C., who thought of the essential message, all were more than adequately fulfilled. To their minds all the illustrative detail, the impressive imagery, the poetic expression of their countrymen, had been amply justified by the overflowing scourge of the Babylonian captivity. The detail might or might not be realized, but the fundamental fact never failed. The Word never returned void. Nineveh might not fall, but the principle of the punishment of the wicked was not annulled. Hezekiah might not die, but all life was in the hands of the Maker. Jehoiakim might be carried as a captive to Babylon, or his dead body might like carrion be cast outside the city, but in either case he suffered the just penalty for his sin, and the law of God was satisfied. Thus we do well to regard the material details in which each prophet clothed his message as of purely local interest and quite secondary, but the moral truths therein embodied, the "Word of our God," which "endureth for ever."

STUDY IV THE MESSIANIC HOPE As the Hebrew people passed through the various phases of their experience, prosperity, ruin, captivity, return, etc., their religious ideas underwent correspond- ing changes. The prophets were always able to meet the needs of the situation with that message which was most adequate. They called to repentance, com- forted in the hour of sorrow, or inspired for the task at hand. But in the broadest sense what is termed the "messianic hope" gathers up all the noblest ideals of the leaders of Israel. The purely national hopes are as definitely included in it as are the religious. This hope, as we follow it through the centuries of Israel's history, naturally branches out in a number of avenues. Different writers expressed the same idea by different images and in a different language. But further, with changing times the very content of the hope changed. Through the generations the ideas gradually became clearer and more definite. They began with the national and ended with the community. They opened with the material and deepened into the spiritual. They started with the provincial and broadened into the universal. To follow this movement will require very careful study. Much of the literature of the Old Testament gathers around this theme. To review all the material that bears on the subject is not possible. To arrange all in a strictly chronological series is, to say the least, difficult. Many of the prophetic voices are undated. Some give but the faintest clue to the time of their origin. Prophetic ideas often overlap. Early prophets must sometimes have expressed hopes and ideals that were far beyond their own day and generation. Late prophets not infrequently harked back to and repeated the messages of those long dead and gone. Notwithstanding the difficulty, the effort will be made to group together and study, in what seems to be the best historical background, those messages that have kindred linguistic features and common religious content. Because of limited space it will rarely be possible to indicate the data that suggest or compel the order of the passages in the following studies. Any good commentary will give satisfactory information. In some cases the content alone has governed the grouping. I. THE EARLY COVENANT For a view of the earliest national hope we must go to the Pentateuch. "The Law," since the late days of the Old Testament times, has been a very general name for the first five books of the Bible. We must, however, note that large sections of these books are not legal but are prophetic. Most of Genesis, much of Exodus, a few chapters in Numbers, and nearly all of Deuteronomy have the spirit of prophecy. Much of these prophetic writings is earlier than the great eighth- century prophets. The ideals which are presented no doubt go back to still more ancient days, back, perhaps, in germ at least, to the beginning of the nation. Thus they express the earliest hopes of this people and lay the foundation for the later</page><page sequence="18">104 THE BIBLICAL WORLD superstructure of the writing prophets. The earliest form that this hope takes is that of the Abrahamic covenant. First day.-? 76. Gen. 12: 1-3. Abram is directed to leave his homeland. Read the brief poem which, in structure and thought, is separated from that which precedes and from that which follows. In the broad sense of the word it is mes- sianic. It enshrines an Israelitish ideal that no doubt was very ancient. In some form or other it must have gone back to the patriarchal days and have played an important part in the early national life. The promise is twofold: the descendants of the patriarch are to become a great nation and are to be greatly blessed. The climax of this idea is found in the last part of the third verse. "And by thee shall all the nations of the earth bless themselves," is the most accurate translation. See also 22:18; 26:4. That is, the prosperity of Israel is to be such that other nations will wish for themselves the same good fortune. The other part of the promise is found in a single phrase but is very significant. It is, "be thou a blessing." It is very interesting to find in the early promise to these people the definite sense of national responsibility. This sense of service, which breaks out time and time again, indicates the great seriousness of their religious leaders and makes a very definite contribution to the messianic ideal. Second day.-Gen. 15:1I-5, i8. Abram is to possess Canaan. This promise is more definite than that in the foregoing study. In all, we find in the Book of Genesis the covenant with Abram repeated in eight different places, as follows: Gen. 12:2, 3, 7; 13:14, 15; 15:4, 5, 18; 17:1-22; 21:I2; 22:I6-18. Must we think of these as eight different conversations between God and Abram ? We would not question the fatherly solicitude of God for his people. But may it not be that we have here numerous repetitions, in very anthropomorphic form, which indicate the strength of the tradition that there was an early covenant with the founder of the nation ? Such repetition would then indicate a number of inde- pendent witnesses, all adding their testimony to the great central fact. Note that the promise here is for material and national prosperity. Compare it with the above-mentioned study. The promised seed is an important addition. Should not an illustrious nation have a unique origin ? The nation that is going to be the religious teacher of mankind must needs have an ancestry that has been in fellow- ship with the Divine. Third day.-? 77. Exod. 3:16-18. Moses is to lead the Israelites out of Egypt. Moses in a very real sense was the founder of the Hebrew nation. Under him the various tribal groups were bound together in allegiance to Jehovah as their God. The experience of those days colored all their after life. This deliverance became to them their perpetual symbol of deliverance. It was their assurance of their own destiny. It created new visions and stimulated old hopes. On this, the birthday of the nation, no doubt the religious element was most prominent. Notice, however, that the promise is one that meets the definite and immediate need of their present situation. It is deliverance from foreign oppression to national freedom. It is couched wholly in the language of material possession. They are to possess a land flowing with milk and honey. That is, one that was adequate to meet their needs as a people who had herds and flocks. It was one with good pasture lands and attractive to wild bees, as was Palestine. While none of the more spiritual ideals are definitely expressed, we do not under the circumstances expect any. The promise was the most suitable for the situation.</page><page sequence="19">AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF SACRED LITERATURE 105 II. THE EARLY NATIONAL HOPES Fourth day.-Num. 23:7-Io. Balaam blesses Israel. This is the first of four short poems which have a common theme and fit into a common background. Indications that lie on the surface show that the singer was acquainted with historical facts in the reigns of Saul and David. In song he celebrates an expe- rience of the days of the desert. Balak, king of Moab, feared the oncoming tide of Israelites whose reputation had gone before them. Balaam seems to have been a well-known professional prophet. The Moabite king, like most primitive people, believed in the power of cursing or blessing. He thought, by calling in the services of this prophet, to stay the tide of battle. Balaam appears in a very favorable light. Where was his home (22:5; 23:7) ? Why do these two statements not agree ? Can it be that they come from two different sources and have thus preserved two different traditions, one of which has failed to preserve the fact accurately ? Enumerate the blessings mentioned in this poem. Compare the content with those that have been previously studied. The meaning of "a people that dwelleth alone" is not quite certain. It may either refer to their national security and prosperity or to their religious separatism. The latter was certainly a constant quantity in the minds of Hebrew writers. Read Exod. i9:5. Balaam was an honest man who could not be bribed. Why did he bless Israel? Could there be any historical reason ? Would knowledge of past victories or present numbers influence him ? What lesson do we learn when we find God using a pagan, if we may use that name, to declare His will ? Fifth day.-? 78. Num. 23:19-24. Balaam gives his blessing a second time. The king of Moab persists in his effort and brings Balaam to the top of Pisgah, where he may get another view of Israel. All the religious accompaniments for enchantment are provided. But the new vision brings no change to the word of the prophet. What can be the meaning of "no iniquity in Jacob," "no perverse- ness in Israel"? Was the nation morally and religiously blameless? Was it better now than in the time of Amos ? Is it possible that the prophet had not the same clear conception of right and wrong that later men had ? When we look at the whole poem we find the ideal is quite military, verse 24. In the days of the early wars the people were called on to serve loyally in the struggles of the nation. Read the great song in Judges 5 indicating that. Military valor was the earliest type of virtue, and this laid the foundation for the more spiritual graces. In the earliest days Jehovah was regarded as the God of hosts or armies. Sixth day.-Num. 24:3-9. Balaam again blesses Israel. This poem gives a confident picture of the future glory of the kingdom. It seems to have an agri- cultural background and to have some knowledge of the early history of the monarchy. It breathes, however, the military ideal. This we must not altogether despise. Apart from military strength there could have been no nation, and apart from the nation it is not easy to see how there could have been vigorous religious life. Even in these early ideals God is looked to as the leader and the deliverer. III. LATER PRE-EXILIC NATIONAL HOPES Seventh day.-? 79. Deut. I7:14-20. Restrictions are placed on kingship. That Deuteronomy, in whole or in part, was the "book of the law," discovered in 621 B.C., which became the basis of the reform of King Josiah, is now universally recognized. Read the story in II Kings 22, 23. Any good commentary on</page><page sequence="20">106 THE BIBLICAL WORLD Deuteronomy will give ample evidence of this fact. The book, written long enough before 621 B.C. to have been lost, contains regulations that went back to the early days of Israel, or indeed back to the very time of Moses. But its present literary form and some of its leading ideas came from a period after the settlement in Canaan and even after the establishment of the monarchy. To read Deuter- onomy, knowing that much of the history of the nation lay in the past, and that the city of Jerusalem had assumed a place of first importance in the religious life of the people, is to find a new and fascinating light in many of its pages. Read Deut. 17:14-20 and note that certain limitations are placed on the kingship. The pomp and the show of kings like Solomon was not tolerable for people so liberty-loving as the Hebrews. The introduction into the royal harem of many women, perhaps foreign women in particular, who would lead away from the pure worship, was most iniquitous in the eyes of the common people. The positive regulation that the king should be a diligent student of the lawbook is one that if followed would insure the perpetuation of the religious ideals of the time. This is a spirit quite different from anything we have yet studied. The nation seems here to be face to face with new experiences and with new difficulties, and, if we may judge from this study, they had God-given leaders who met the needs of the hour with the finest idealism. Eighth day.-? 8o. Deut. 26:16-19; 29:10-13. The national hope is re- expressed. Both passages indicate the two sides of the covenant. The hope of the nation is as confident here as in any of the previous studies. Is it in any way changed ? Can we see any progress in idealism ? Here it is no longer merely victory over the foes, swallowing up the adversary, rending and tearing him, but Israel is the peculiar people of God, a holy people. They are indeed high above all the nations, but now it is in character, "in praise, in name, in honor." It would seem that only slowly did the high purposes of God for his people become clear to their leaders. On the basis of their victories were raised their hopes of a great future, but out of the ashes of their defeats came the purification of their hopes. Ninth day.-? 8i. Deut. 28:1-6. Obedience brings reward. The moral outlook here is akin to that of the eighth-century prophets. It is character that counts. Military exploits no longer hold the foreground of attention. The nation will be great only in proportion to conduct. Even her prosperity is conditioned by obedience. Does it not seem necessary in the kindergarten stage of the race experience and also in the childhood of the individual to teach through the physical and the material sides of life? At certain stages do not material rewards have a stronger appeal than any other? Are such incentives the noblest? Is not the doing of right for its own sake nobler than doing it for material reward ? Again it seems that the lower is but a preparation for the higher. Tenth day.-Deut. 28:7-14. Promise of material reward is continued. Note the various factors in the reward in both studies. These were no doubt the very things that had the chief appeal to the minds of most of the nation in those days. How far would we be justified in looking for the same rewards today? Do dif- ferent times demand a change of ideals? Can we think that these promises made to those who were obedient are of universal application? Is the righteous man necessarily the wealthy man? Does goodness shield a man from accident, bereavement, or plague ? What is the teaching of Jesus in this respect? Read Luke 13:4.</page><page sequence="21">AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF SACRED LITERATURE 107 Eleventh day.-? 82. Deut. 33: 26-29. Israel is greatly exalted. Read the whole poem and note that while the poet looks on the days of Moses and the settlement of Palestine as a thing in the past the general tone of the poem suggests a comparatively early date for its composition. The singer is conscious that the people are greatly favored by Jehovah. One of the patent signs of his favor was the very heavy dews that insured the fertility of the soil even in times of drought. It was the "dew of heaven." Protection against and victory over the enemies was the other great fact that elicited his song of praise. That Israel is a peculiarly privileged nation, destined for an exalted place among the nations, is the persistent consciousness of all these studies. Always do they recognize the good hand of God in their prosperity and usually they proclaim their service and homage to Him. Twelfth day.-? 83. Isaiah 7: i-i6. Israel will be delivered from Syria and Ephraim. In 734 B.c., at a time when Syria and Ephraim had united against Judah, Ahaz, the king of Judah, was in great fear as to the consequences. Isaiah did all he could to quiet him but without apparent success. Finally the prophet in the name of Jehovah challenges the king to ask for a sign which may be taken as proof of the power of God to save his people. Ahaz, who apparently by this time had made overtures to the Assyrians for assistance against his enemies, refuses to put God to the test. Isaiah then offers the king a sign, part of which is in verses 7-16 of this study. A young woman, one that in some way was definitely desig- nated, is with child, and before her child is old enough to know good from evil, perhaps four or five years old, Syria and Ephraim will be overthrown. That is, inside of five years the enemies of Judah will no longer be a menace to them. We know that in two years Syria fell and Ephraim fell some eleven years later. Thirteenth day.-? 84. Isa. 1:24-26. Judges and counselors are to be restored. The prophet looked out upon a corrupt life in which the upper classes were the leaders and for which they were responsible. Read the passage assigned. Jehovah, who is the guardian of the city, will thoroughly cleanse it. In order that it may not again become apostate the rulers of the present type must be displaced by judges and counselors who belonged to the simpler regime of the earlier days. Thus the reform on one side is fundamentally political. It is a resurgence of the old spirit of democracy for which the people so often stood. Would it not seem in this passage that Isaiah conceived that with a simpler organization and with men at the head of affairs who were from the ranks of the common people Jerusalem might thus become the city of righteousness, the faithful town? Compare this with the study for the seventh day. Fourteenth day.-? 85. Isa. 10: 5-27. Assyria will be driven back. In the days of Isaiah the Assyrian danger was greatest in 701 B.c. The Assyrian army was the most powerful in the world of that day. Judah had only a handful of people. They had no equipment with which to stand against this conquering army. Read the message of Isaiah in io: 5-27. Notwithstanding apparently insurmountable obstacles the prophet has faith in God that Jerusalem will be delivered. We might say blind, stubborn faith, for the signs of the times were all against it. At no time perhaps was there a more unfaltering faith in the midst of more despairing circumstances than at the present. But this faith in the future</page><page sequence="22">108 THE BIBLICAL WORLD of the nation was unquenchable. It was the faith that made these men immortal. No army could overthrow it, no temporary reverses could chill their confidence, no dark and desolate centuries could still their songs of hope. IV. THE EXILIC HOPE In the eighth and seventh centuries, as we will recall from former studies, defeat and captivity at the hands of Assyria loomed on the national horizon. Hence the messages of the prophets were largely calls to repentance and words of condemnation. Northern Israel fell in 722 B.C., and Judah in 597 B.c. and 586 B.C. The year 538 B.C., when Persia conquered Babylon, marked the beginning of a new era. Privileges of repatriation were granted the Jewish captives. Some at once availed themselves of the opportunity. Others returned in smaller or larger groups at various intervals stretching over a period of centuries. Many, however, seem to have been satisfied with their condition in Babylon and to have found it to their interest to remain there. As the appalling tragedy of defeat and captivity became a certainty, the voice of prophecy took up the note of restoration. In the darkest hours of disaster, before and during the captivity, the ancient confidence in the national destiny was revived. Before the exile we hear the beginning of the song. During the cap- tivity there seems to have been a chorus of splendid voices to whose tones the suffering added only mellowness and sweetness. It will be well for us to carefully watch, not only the poetic beauty of many of the studies, but also the definite progress of thought differing greatly in detail from earlier ideals. All the passages that follow were written with the full con- sciousness of the exile, either as a certainty in the immediate future or as a present experience. Fifteenth day.-? 86. Hos. 2: 16, 17; 14, 15, I8. Restoration is promised. Read 2:16, 17 and note that Israel will repent in the future and will turn to Jehovah. True religion, in which the name of Baal, and of course the false religion connected therewith, will have no place, will be instituted. This is a very lofty conception. In the other verses, 14, 15, I8, we have a quite different outlook. Israel apparently has suffered for her sins and needs comfort. To a people sup- posedly repentant Jehovah has only words of tenderness. The promise is here put in a most inviting form. Vineyards are to be restored. The wild animals will no longer terrify or molest, and security is to be granted from invading armies. Sixteenth day.-? 87. Hos. 2:19-23. This is in thought immediately con- nected with verse 18. Jehovah is going to regenerate the land and thus give to his people a superabundance of grain and wine and oil. Poverty-stricken toilers in the time of their distress perhaps knew no loftier language nor greater good than that set forth in these verses. While material prosperity is here looked on as the happy consummation of all their hopes, we must not overlook the fact that the fundamental thing here as in all other places is their relation to God and their loyalty to him, "Thou art my people," and the answer, "Thou art my God." Seventeenth day.-? 88. Hos. 14:4-7; i i:9- i. Return is certain. The poetic imagery of the first section is very beautiful. The dew, the lily, the olive tree, the vine, and the odor of Lebanon were the symbols of fertility and beauty with which all in Israel were well acquainted. The future strength and beauty of</page><page sequence="23">AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF SACRED LITERATURE 109 the nation is couched in the most significant language. In the second section, ii:9-II, the thought is somewhat interrupted, but the main idea is the return of the people to their own land. Eighteenth day.-? 89. Mic. 4:6-8. Restoration is to be permanent. Picture the exiles in Babylon and read this passage. The writer, though he indulges in no lofty flight of imagination, looks forward with very clear vision to the time when the afflicted will be gathered back to Palestine. No ruler of the house of David seems to be in the foreground. Jehovah himself will reign in Mount Zion. There will be no future dispersal, but all the glory of early days will be restored. We cannot doubt that this perennial confidence of Israel's prophets originated in their deep-seated conviction that God would bring about his rule of righteousness in the earth. But often as here we are com- pelled by the facts to admit that the verbal expression of that conviction never has and never can be fulfilled. An attempt to prove that the remnant became a strong nation or that the rule of God in Jerusalem was permanent would be a failure. Nineteenth day.-? 9go. Jer. 23: 1-4; 16: 14, 15. The first section evidently belongs to the time of the fall of Jerusalem and the dispersion of the people. Compare it with yesterday's study. Both look for the return of a remnant. Jeremiah, however, looks for rulers over the people, but men who are quite dif- ferent from those of his own time. Compare the shepherds or leaders of verses i and 4. No fear, no dismay, and nothing lacking is the good fortune that awaits the remnant, here, as above. Twentieth day.-? 91. Jer. 24: 1-7; Ezek. 11: 14-17. This is an interesting study in sociology. Compare both sections carefully. The passage in Jeremiah was written in 597 B.C., that from Ezekiel in 591 B.C. One is not indebted to the other but their viewpoints are the same. The good figs of Jeremiah's vision are the princes and chief men of the country who were carried captive in 597 B.C. (II Kings 24:15, 16). These men had been roundly rated by every prophet up to and including Jeremiah, and had been blamed for all the coming disaster. Now they alone are worthy of praise. The bad grapes are those who were left in the land in 597 B.C., and who before this time had been the poor and the oppressed whose cause every prophet had vigorously espoused. The underlings of for- mer days, who have now become the office-bearers, are worse than were their predecessors. Read the passage from Ezekiel and note that they boast that Jehovah has punished the princes and has given the land to themselves as a possession. But both prophets expressly state that it is the exiles, those who have suffered and profited thereby, who are to receive favor from God. Compare this with the study for the thirteenth day. Twenty-first day.-? 92. Jer. 30:i-9. Both the people of northern Israel and of Judah are to be restored to their own land. The prophet does not seem to be conscious of any national movements which may be used in the providence of God to effect this desired end. Jehovah himself will accomplish it. It will be a day of great fear and trembling. Some strange supernatural thing must happen before the people are liberated. They shall forever be free men, their worship shall be pure, and the dynasty of David in which was enshrined the ideals of justice and equality would be established. The ideal is a very noble one.</page><page sequence="24">110 THE BIBLICAL WORLD Twenty-second day.-? 93. Amos 9: i1-15. Country and cities, apparently of both Israel and Judah, lie in ruins. But the captivity will come to an end, the people will return, and the new nation will be more prosperous than in the days of yore. Her boundaries will be wider than in her palmiest days. The seasons will be changed so that it will be perpetual spring and summer. The joy of harvest is the dominant note of the song. With the promise of their return also goes that of perpetual residence in their homeland. Twenty-third day.-? 94. Hos. i:io, i1. Both nations are to return from captivity and to be a united people under one ruler. They are to be as innumerable as the sands of the sea and their fame as the sons of the living God is to be wide- spread. While this lacks the poetry and the color of many of the prophetic visions it is perhaps more thoroughly religious. Twenty-fourth day.-? 95. Ezek. 37:21-23; 34:22-31. The coming return and union of the two nations is asserted in both passages. One king, "even my servant David," is going to wisely and tenderly care for them. Wild beasts are to cease. Fruits and grains are to be abundant. They shall never again be carried away, shall never be molested by the wild animals, shall never suffer famine, and shall never in any way be ashamed in the midst of the nations. Twenty-fifth day.-? 96. Isa. 9: 2-6. A great song bursts from the lips of the man of God in this period of great distress. The tenses used are all perfects, but the Hebrew language has what is called a prophetic perfect tense used to express absolute certainty. The deliverance is couched in imagery which is at once picturesque and vivid. A light, a harvest song, the revelry after victory when the spoil is divided and the war weapons are burnt, are the pictures that pass before us in the poem. No doubt these were very literal hopes. Twenty-sixth day.-? 97. Isa. xx:6-9. This is the conclusion of a wonderful conception the early part of which we shall take up in a later study. The writer looks forward to the establishment of complete harmony between all the animal life of creation, man included. Quite frequently we meet the same idea, but in no other place has it been expressed so adequately or so beautifully. Com- mentators of past days frequently spiritualized it and thought that nations or individuals of different types were spoken of under the guise of animals. But this was scarcely the thought of the prophet. He and others who used the same or kindred phraseology thought that in the golden age to come all nature would be transformed. The conception of universal fellowship with Jehovah, as it is expressed in verse 9, is the most delightful part of the picture. Twenty-seventh day.-? 98. Isa. 40: 1-4, 9-11. The exile is at an end and return is immediate. This and the two following studies belong to 540 B.C. or thereabouts. All the section, Isaiah xl-lvi, is written with the return from exile in the immediate future. The prophet tells the nation that her warfare, or her time of service, is completed and her iniquity is pardoned. The way for the home- going is to be made easy and the herald of the expected liberation is to shout aloud, for Jehovah is coming to perform his mighty act. Notice the tenderness of the closing verse. It is the picture of the shepherd leading the flock and ministering to each one according to need. How comforting must such a picture have been for the weary exiles as they looked forward to the long, rough caravan route to their loved homeland.</page><page sequence="25">AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF SACRED LITERATURE 111 Twenty-eighth day.-? 99. Isa. 49:8-21. The returning exiles will be innu- merable. From north and south and west they come joyously. Sinim, of verse 12, is perhaps Syene near the first cataract of the Nile, and hence stands for Egypt. Here the amazing thing is the multitude, who throng back to Palestine until the land is too small for the population. Twenty-ninth day.-? Ioo. Isa. 52:1, 2, 7-12. Jerusalem is to be a holy city. The waste places of Jerusalem are to be restored. The people who are still in captivity are called on to prepare for their journey. There is no need for unseemly haste, for Jehovah himself is leading and protecting. Never again will the uncir- cumcised or the unclean enter the city. What rare words of hope! How they must have been as joy bells to the ears of the captives! How idealistic they are! We cannot afford to loose the fine spirit and the transcendant optimism, because of the fact that, though the days of the exile were at an end, in the course of a few years the actual condition of Jerusalem was far from ideal. We do find that cleansing, purifying power of which the prophets dreamed, working, not limited to Judaistic environment, but out in the larger world. We find it achieving the longed-for goal, not suddenly with the close of the Babylonian captivity, but gradually through the long centuries of struggle which seem necessary for the perfection of human character. Thirtieth day.-? ioI. Isa. 35:1-1o0. A highway will be ready for the returning exiles. This delightful poem is self-interpreting. The dangers lying between the place where Jehovah's redeemed ones are and Jerusalem will all be removed. There is no need for the weak to be fearful, as no fool, no lion, no ravenous beast, will be found by the highway. All is joy and gladness. Summary.-We have now completed a series of studies, which have the idea of the Kingdom as the center Most of these, if not all, belong to the days before 538 B.c. They show not only the peculiarities of different writers so far as style is concerned, but also those differences that indicate different environment and different ages. Most of them gather around the idea of the return. Many of them were written when liberation was in the immediate future. To all the future is most hopeful; to some it is transcendantly glorious. An innumerable multitude, liberated, possessing a regenerated land, in the midst of universal peace, no fear, no enemy, and the promise that possession is absolutely permanent-this is the splendid vision that is woven into their poetry. But when we glance at the history of the nation from 538 B.c. on, we find only a very meager realization of these dreams. A few responded to the edict of liberation, but most remained behind. The caravan highway was the same old, rough, hard road that it had always been. The seasons did not roll together, the wild beasts did not become tame, the land did not throng with happy multitudes. Palestine and the life and the religion were little if any better than in the early days. As for the permanent abode of those who were restored, the future proved no kinder to them than the past. Were their hopes therefore misplaced ? We could not agree to that; for we find, for three centuries more, the descendants of these prophets still singing. It is true the notes change, as we shall see in the next study, but their faith is still unshaken. The God in whom they trusted has not cast them off; but their</page><page sequence="26">112 THE BIBLICAL WORLD expressions, their forms of speech, have fallen by the wayside, in the forward march to those ideals that are ethical and spiritual rather than material and national.
