<plain_text><page sequence="1">PADMA KAIMAL THE PROBLEM OF PORTRAITURE IN SOUTH INDIA, CIRCA 870-970 A.D.' Portraiture has only recently begun to receive serious attention within the history of South Asian art, most scholars having assumed that this genre did not exist on the subcontinent until outsiders - Mughals and then Europeans - introduced it to India in the sixteenth century. Ananda K. Coomaraswamy and other early historians of Indian art had dismissed the possibility of indigenous Indic portraiture, maintaining that Indian art represented individuals through "symbols of general ideas" instead of through portraiture.' T.G. Aravamuthan proposed a number of pre-Mughal carved and painted images as portraits, but other specialists regarded all early Indic arts as insufficiently representing the physical idiosyncrasies that distinguish individuals and that distinguish portraits from representations of the divine. When such idiosyncrasies do appear, the argument went, their inconsistencies seem to detract from their success as portraits: "'portraits' of different rulers look very much alike... [and] portraits of the same person look completely different from each other."3 Assuming portraiture to be a celebration of individualism, Coomaraswamy argued that the genre could not exist in India because Hindu thought "justifies no cult of ego-expression...

Rowland too rejects Indian images as portraits because they lack sufficient individuation, but one should note that the image he uses to illustrate this point (a large-scale drawing from the collection of New York's Metropolitan Museum that is usually identified as Krishna and that he titles "Portrait of a Prince") is not inscribed as a portrait, nor does Rowland cite his evidence for interpreting it as one: Rowland, Art in East and West, 34-35.

Desai and Denise Patry Leidy, Faces of Asia: Portraits from the Permanent Collection (Boston: Museum of Fine Arts, 1989). Desai and Leidy modify the hypothesis on the conceptual origins of Indic portraiture, suggesting that Akbar's personal interests and Timurid culture were responsible for introducing the genre to the subcontinent, with European influence becoming a serious factor under Jahdngir: 22zz, 127. 59</page><page sequence="2">thus in accordance with the truth."4 In his assessment, Hindu art focused on the "essential and original" in preference to "derivative and accidental" phenomena such as the chance configurations of a particular person's physical features.5 Vincent Smith and John Rosenfield suggested variously that Hindu or Buddhist philosophies discouraged portraiture.6 Rowland too perceived in Indian art "a point of view in which reference to the particular has no place."'7 Sanskrit treatises on art do not, for that matter, have a separate term for portraiture,8 and Tamil inscriptions identifying the subjects of adjacent carved portraits use no term at all to distinguish the representations from their subjects: their language implies that portraits simply are the person they represent. And yet many passages in pre-Mughal Indic literature testify to the existence and evocative power of portraits, and a number of early Indic sculptures are clearly labeled as representations of con- temporary people. My purpose in this essay is to argue that portraiture was indigenous to India and to explain the terms under which this could be so. I begin by examining problematic assumptions inherent in earlier denials of Indic portraiture, and by offering criteria drawn from semiotic theory for classifying images as portraits. I review early Indic literary and sculptural traces that demonstrate compellingly the early practice of portrait-making.9 I then study at length some of the most convincing examples of indigenous Indic portraiture, twelve reliefs (figs. I-9) carved around the tenth century - the so-called Early C61a period - in the Kaveri region of Tamil Natu in southern India (fig. Io). I analyze each of these portrait reliefs for its component parts and for its role in the larger architectural context of the temple. In the portraits' specific locations, I read something of the dynamics of viewers' encounters with these portraits. I further explore viewer reception by com- 4 Ananda K.

Contrary to James Burgess [Report on the Buddhist Cave Temples and Their Inscriptions, Archaeological Survey of Western India, vol. 4 (reprint ed., Varanasi: Indological Book House, 1964), 9, fig. 9], the inscription beside a broken image at Kondane reads "made by Balaka, the pupil of Kanha," a reference to the cave's authorship or to the sculptor of this figure, not the figure's subject. See Vidhya Dehejia, Early Buddhist Rock Temples: A Chronology (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1972), 155, fig. 33, and Table 9. The elaborate headdress and the symmetry between this figure and other attendant figures further suggest that this figure is an attendant Yaksa rather than a portrait.

Through these comparisons I distinguish between sculptural style, which I find in similarities between the two genres, and the peculiar demands of portraiture, which I see in their salient differences. These portraits are small and their presence on the temple wall has a subtle impact on viewers' experiences of these monuments. Indeed most of the portraits mentioned in this essay are minor images within their original architectural contexts. I would argue that their significance is none- theless substantial in that it signals the presence, in scholarship that has shaped the field of South Asian art history, of misunderstandings and perhaps oversimplifications of Indic understandings of the self. In reexamining the likeliest examples of early, indigenous Indic portraiture, I mean to re- move them from those interpretive frames and to relocate them in contexts that derive more closely from their original circumstances. DEFINING PORTRAITURE The assumption that portraiture could not be indigenous to India first appears within the debate over Britain's colonial domination of India. For writers like Vincent Smith, an absence of recognizable portraiture could be evidence of India's inability to confront life's realities, and thus further vin- dication of Britain's efforts to negotiate India's political realities for her.Io Coomaraswamy argued in the opposite direction, celebrating aversion to portraiture as a reflection of Indian artisans' commit- ment to representing enduring principles. In a kind of artistic nationalism, he framed that goal as a search for higher truths and set this spiritual virtue in moral opposition to post-medieval European artists' close observations of surfaces, which he denigrated as shallow, ephemeral and meaningless.' Disdain of Indian culture and admiration alike thus predisposed scholars not to expect portraiture in South Asia and therefore to minimize indications that portraits were made and valued there. At the heart of this resistance to seeing portraits in India has been the deeply and, until recently, widely held perception that portraits are mirrors, reflecting objectively the subject's precise appear- ance at a given moment."In this view, which is by no means restricted to writings on Indian art, the subject's specificity emerges most convincingly through the peculiarities of the model, peculiarities especially of physiognomy, though also of personality as conveyed through such devices as distinctive gesture and telling glance.3 The etymology of the word "portrait" encourages English-speakers to IO On Smith's denigrations of Indian culture through art history, see Partha Mitter, Much Maligned Monsters: History of European Reactions to Indian Art (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1977), 267-68. I Coomaraswamy, "Ideal Portraiture." In this article, Coomaraswamy argues that Asian (and early Christian) artists aimed at "ideal" or truthful representation by seeking to capture the essential, non-visible, non-material spirit of the subject, rather than the superficial accidents of appearance, 74-82. Coomaraswamy's agenda of cultural nationalism also emerged as a theme in papers given by Sonya Y. M. Rhie, Jeremy Caslin and Allan Antliff at the panel entitled "Coomaraswamy Reconsidered" at the Annual Meeting of the College Art Association, San Antonio, 1995. i2 On the persistence of that temptation to focus on whom a portrait represents, at the expense of exploring the artifice of the image, see Richard Brilliant, Portraiture (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1991), 7, 23, 30; and "On Portraits," Zeitschrift fiir Aesthetik und allgemeine Kunstwissenschaft 15-16 (1970-71), 11-26. 13 See for example Vittorio Lanternari, "Portraiture among Primitive Peoples," in the Encyclopaedia of World Art, vol. II, 471-72; E. M. Benson, Problems of Portraiture (Washington D.C.: The American Federation of Arts, 1937), 3; and James D. Breckenridge, Likeness: A Conceptual History of Ancient Portraiture (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1968). Breckenridge imposes upon ancient images a definition influenced by anachronistic ideals such as freedom from idealization (71), evocation of individual personality as opposed to group identification (45, 167), and a commemorative function distinct from future-oriented functions such as magic (14). 6I</page><page sequence="4">expect truth and reality from portraiture. The term derives from the verb pritrahere which in classical Latin meant "bring to light, reveal, make known,"'4 and by the second millennium meant "re- produce" or "copy."' Knowing that portraits represent actual people who once experienced material existence on this earth, viewers may expect to learn from portraits what these people really looked like, what personalities they had, what they thought about the temples their portraits adorn and about the gods housed within. Addressing the viewer with the face, glance, or entire body, portraits appear to invite us into a direct communication, an almost magical kind of contact, transcending even vast distances between their subjects and their viewers.I6 Such an invitation also implies that the experience of viewing a portrait will be social, and in that way especially charged and genuine. One might dismiss expectations of objective mirroring and physical idiosyncrasy as irrelevant on the grounds that they reflect standards set by critics from outside South Asia. A failure to meet those expectations could be attributed to their being "external" to the goals of Indic artists, meaning in Edward Said's sense of the term that critics who hold them are profoundly separated from the portraits they try to judge, and are imposing upon those portraits the irrelevant expectations of other cultures." But portraiture studies in the last decades reveal that South Asia was not unique in producing portraits that could disappoint expectations of portraits to reflect their subjects object- ively. In many times and places, the act of making portraits has not been a process of simple mimesis. Richard Brilliant cites portraits from all over Europe that were verifiably molded to suit pre- conceptions about the subject's personality or to incorporate aspects of the artist's physiognomy into the portrait of another. 1Andrew Stewart advises that portraits of Hellenistic rulers "be approached as concretely historical constructs."I9 Others have shown that portraits in twentieth-century America, Renaissance Italy, Ming China, and other parts of Asia derive just as heavily from processes of invention and transference.2 It is risky to expect objective mirroring in any portrait. Despite the truth they may seem to promise, portraits are just as deliberately constructed as any other kind of visual art. The portrait functions as one precisely because it is not the person, because the two are so utterly different from each other in composition and nature. In semiotic terms, the sign (in this case the portrait) is always different from and distant from what it signifies (the person represented). The process of associating a sign with the signified involves certain arbitrary associations or inventions. Art must re-present the subject in order to transform it into that other entity, the art object. Artists, patrons, and frequently the subjects themselves invent and manipulate signs in portraits, and entire communities of viewers 14 See Cassell's New Latin Dictionary, ed. D. Simpson (New York: Funk and Wagnalls, 1959), 484. 5 Tullio de Mauro, "Portraiture," in the Encyclopaedia of World Art, 469. 16 Steiner describes the portrait as "functioning in an almost magical fashion so as to render that subject present." Wendy Steiner, "Postmodernist Portraits," ArtJournal 46.3 (1987), 173.

Portraits from various times and places have emphasized the subject's spirit," inner essence or personality,23 psychological vital- ity,24 emotions typical of the subject,25 typical movements and gestures,26 intellect, professional activity,27 social identity,28 family role,9 magical efficacy,30 or biology.3I Even in portraits that give strongly the impression of an individual of specific and unusual appearance, the distance between the idiosyncratic features of the portrait and the features of the named subject have often been vast and deliberate. That is, even physiognomic individuation has been an aspect of the portrait-sign that Asian, European and American artists have altered and invented. Distinguishing or idiosyncratic physical features in portraits from Hellenistic Rome to Qing China are frequently products of the artists' invention and carry meanings very distant from mimesis.32 2I Gombrich provided an early formulation of this in describing all portrayal as "the faithful construction of a relational model." E. H. Gombrich, Art and Illusion: A Study in the Psychology of Pictorial Representation (Princeton: Princeton University Press 1969), 90o. Eco maintained that an object and its sign share no properties, and that any link perceived between the two is entirely manufactured by culture. Umberto Eco, A Theory of Semiotics (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1976, 1979), 191-95, 204. Brilliant observed that Plato argued the same point at length, through Socrates in Cratylus, as it applies to portraiture specifically: Richard Brilliant, "The Limitations of Likeness," ArtJournal 64.3 (1987), 171-72. Steiner emphasized the impact of viewing conventions on the process of reading portraits specifically: Wendy Steiner, "The Semiotics of Genre: Portraiture in Literature and Painting," Semiotica 21, nos. I/2 (1977). 22 Vinograd attributes the "vivid and individuated pictorial presence" of many Chinese portraits to their function as effigies that harbored the subject's spirit: Boundaries of the Self, lo. 23 Brilliant believes Western portraiture requires insight into character: Portraiture, 13. 24 See Brilliant, Portraiture, 71-72 25 European and American portraiture has demonstrated a reluctance to represent emotion, perceiving it as transitory and therefore inconsequential to the "unchanging, essential self"that the portrait must capture (Brilliant, Portraiture, 112). On a very different perspective in India, see Owen Lynch, "The Social Construction of Emotions in India," in Divine Passions: The Social Construction of Emotion in India, ed. Owen M. Lynch (Berkeley: University of California, 1990), 3-34. 6Again in opposition to Brilliant's observations of Western portraiture in which "few portraits at any time ... show anyone smiling or talking or moving" (Portraiture, IO), the nature of a person's movement can, in India, characterize the person profoundly. See Frederique Apffel Marglin, "Refining the Body: Transformative Emotion in Ritual Dance," in Divine Passions: The Social Construction of Emotion in India, ed. Owen M. Lynch (Berkeley: University of California, 1990), 212-36. Also, Spiro argues that in Chinese portraiture of the Six Dynasties period, "Body behavior... - not the face, not the eyes - defined the man and offered the pictorial key to his character": Audrey Spiro, Contemplating the Ancients: Aesthetic and Social Issues in Early Chinese Portraiture (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1990), 172. 27 See Brilliant on the portraits of Erasmus by Durer and Holbein: Portraiture, 72-74.

Goswamy, "Essence and Appearance,"I97. 30 In maintaining that associations with magic, religion and ritual do not disqualify work as portraits, I differ with James Breckenridge who attempts to dismiss such images as primitive precursors to "true portraiture." See Breckenridge, Likeness, 7, 14 and ch. 2. Brilliant points out contemporary examples in which fetishism operates powerfully in people's response to portraiture: Brilliant, Portraiture, g19, 24. Vinograd notes the important ritual function of some types of Chinese portraiture: Vinograd, Boundaries of the Self, 2. In his disqualification of such images, Breckenridge seems intent on purging portraiture of its strong involvement with the lived world. Steiner notes that discomfort with portraiture's indexical aspect has frequently marked academic study of the genre: "The Semiotics of a Genre," III. 3 Ancestral portraits in Chinese shrines imitate the inner as well as the outer body, enclosing silk viscera and seeds in compartments within the statue. Keith G. Stevens, "Portrait and Ancestral Images on Chinese Altars," Arts ofAsia 19 (1989), 136. 32 Apparently individuated physiognomies have functioned as non-mimetic signs all over the world for many centuries. See John Rosenfield, "Studies in Japanese Portraiture: The Statue of Gien at Okadera," Ohio University Review 5 (1965); John Rosenfield, "Studies in Japanese Portraiture: The Statue of Vimalakirti at Hokke-ji," Ars Orientalis 6 (1966); B. Frischer, The Sculpted Word: Epicureanism and Philosophical Recruitment in Ancient Greece (Berkeley: University of California, 1982); and Kesner, "Likeness of No One." 63</page><page sequence="6">If objective mirroring and physiognomic peculiarities are not reliable markers of portraiture, what might be? Semiotics identifies one aspect that applies to all portraits and that distinguishes them from other categories of the visual arts. Wendy Steiner points out that a portrait must function on two levels: as an art object, an aesthetic form enclosed in its own frame of reference; and unlike other art objects, as an index, directing the viewer's awareness outward beyond the work of art itself to evoke a particular subject's presence. In this indexical function the portrait is "gesturing toward the extra-artistic actuality of the subject."33 The portrait must signify first and foremost as an index. It makes us aware of its subject as an actual person, and exists by virtue of the necessary connection between itself and that person; i.e., it would not be a sign were that person not in existence.34 The truthfulness and social contact that portraits promise are embedded in what these images invari- ably are: direct references to people who existed outside the art object. Portraits depend upon con- crete reference to the world of experience. In determining whether an image is a portrait, then, that image's intended function becomes especially important to assess. Intent does figure as a prominent requirement in modern definitions of portraiture.35 A notoriously difficult undertaking, the assessment of intent can be especially complex across cultures, given the variety of options cultures have demonstrated in defining individuality and the signs appropriate to portraiture. A portrait's function may be unrecognizable to a viewer familiar with different cultural codes,36 and without the viewer's recognition of a portrait's indexical refer- ence, the image ceases to function as a portrait.37 An intriguing tension results between the portrait's referential function and the inevitable disjunction operating between a sign and what it signifies. Indexicality feeds expectations of truth. In order to succeed as indices, portraits must evoke the actual person they signify. The idea of mimesis becomes especially seductive. Artists may strive to create the strong impression that the image imitates the model precisely, and viewers may long to believe it. More than in other genres, then, links between the sign and the signified must be firmly established, but the inherent distance between the sign and the signified remains. For Indian examples of this, see B. N. Goswamy, "Essence and Appearance:" in later painting for the Rajput courts, unique- looking physiognomy was deployed as a laksana of low social status. On the idea of individuation as a laksana, see Desai and Leidy, Faces of Asia, 24. One peculiar physiognomy is used as a laksagna for an entire group in portraits of the Kota court of Maharao Ram Singh, where the king's features have been imposed on images of the other courtiers. See Joachim Bautze, "Portraitmalerei unter Maharao Ram Singh von Kota," Artibus Asiae 49, nos. 3/4 (1988-89), 316-5o. 33 Steiner, "Postmodernist Portraits," 173. 34 Steiner, "Semiotics of a Genre," 112. 35 Brilliant, Portraiture, 8; Richard Delbriick, Antike Portr'ts (Bonn: Marcus und Weber, 1912), vii; Breckenridge, 7; and Spiro, 9. Pollitt defines a portrait as "an intentional representation of a person containing a sufficient number of specific features to make the representation recognizable to others." J. J. Pollitt, Art in the Hellenistic Age (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, I986), 59. 36An important essay that strives to incorporate a wide variety of interior sources into the reading of portraits is Robert T. Soppelsa's "Western Art Historical Methodology and African Art," ArtJournal 47, no. 2 (1988), 147-53. The portrait function of the mma would not have been visible to Soppelsa, but he cites the testimony of people within the culture producing mma who insist that the mma captured the physical uniqueness of the subjects' selves. 37 In discussing Indian literary references to portraiture, Desai notes that the salient characteristic of portraits is their ability to "function in a suggestive way for the viewer... The viewer is essential in activating the role of an image as a portrait." Desai and Leidy, Faces of Asia, 20. Steiner's paradigm ("Semiotics of A Genre") implies that this is true for all portraits, literary and visual, Indian and otherwise. 64</page><page sequence="7">Inscriptions and pictorial labels can resolve this difficulty, making explicit the portraits' reference to specific subjects. Such labels can forge the much-needed link between a sign and its subject, an image and what it indexes. For Steiner, too, portraiture requires some form of title in order to associate with its subjects across spatial and temporal distance.38 Brilliant and Vinograd even maintain that an inscription is sufficient on its own to qualify an image as a portrait. 39 Although I see the representation of human subjects as a requirement of portraiture, I would agree that clearly la- belled portraits need not actually picture that subject anthropomorphically. The genre can include non-figural evocations of specific individuals such as Charles Demuth's encapsulation of William Carlos Williams through visual emblems evocative of the poet's language.4? Francis Picabia's non- figural "Portrait of Marie Laurencin" from I9I7 also qualifies, in these terms, as a portrait since the purpose of these sketches of machine parts and of the inscriptions upon the image is to evoke a particular, named woman.41 Labels take on this significance not because written evidence matters more than visual,42 but because of the prominent even constitutive role of indexicality in portraiture. Such labels could conceivably be pictorial rather than verbal, as long as they declared the intent of an image to function as an index. Labels are of course not always available, but when they are they constitute evidence we ignore at our peril.43 Some may object that as semiotics is not an indigenously Indic way of knowing, it is likely to distort further the reading of Indian portraits. For that matter, the very discipline of art history was initially predicated on principles external to the systems that shaped Indian art, and is therefore "external" to these Indian objects. I acknowledge that the analysis of portraiture through art historical method is inextricably associated with ways of formulating knowledge that are alien to tenth-century Tamil Nadu, and I am aware that one hazard of exterior perspectives is that they may yield less insight into the putative subject than they reveal about me. Obtaining an interior perspective on ancient Indian objects is of course no simple task, given the vast temporal and geographic spaces that place them beyond my direct experience. And yet if we were all to throw up our hands at these challenges, we would leave a number of Indian art objects encased in the ill-fitting terms fashioned for them by previous scholarship, and we would guarantee that the messages these objects were created to communicate never reach us. I prefer to venture toward closer readings of these figures, through the best tools available so far. And semiotics, its European and linguistic origins notwithstanding, has been instrumental both in exposing biases inherent in basic paradigms of art history and in providing a more flexible language for describing phenomena across cultures. Indexicality is an appealing device for defining portraiture because it derives not from specific portraits with their specific cultural baggage, but from the basic mechanics of the images. Indexicality can therefore be meaningful across cultures. 38 Steiner, "Semiotics of a Genre," 113. 39 Vinograd, Boundaries, 35; Brilliant, Portraiture, 5o. Brilliant even warns that, in the absence of names, it is dangerous to assume portraiture at all, 54-55. 40 See Edward A. Aiken, "'I Saw the Figure 5 in Gold': Charles Demuth's Emblematic Portrait of William Carlos Williams," Art Journal 46, no. 3 (1987), 178-84. 4' Brilliant uses this example to classify such non-anthropomorphic images as portraits: Portraiture, fig. 75 and 155-56. 42 Note Williams' objection to the privileging of written over visual evidence: Joanna Williams, "Criticizing and Evaluating the Visual Arts in India,"Journal of Asian Studies 47, no. I (1988), 3, n. I. 43 Breckenridge, for example, disregards inscriptions that identify Greek and Levantine images as portraits: Likeness, 27, 37, 82-84, 88, 99. 65</page><page sequence="8">From this perspective, I define the portrait as a visual image44 composed of a collage of elements selected to capture something of the essential nature of specific human subjects who lived within the span of historical time. In order to function as a portrait, an image need not adhere to any particulars of the subject's original appearance but it must somehow successfully articulate within its own culture its role as an index to that person's extra-artistic reality. The specific devices employed to articulate that role and the aspects of the subject considered worthy of representation can vary enormously. The breadth of my definition derives from the inherent function common to all por- traits, and not by the way from the necessity of accommodating Indian art as some unusual case. The Kave-ri-region portraits exhibit sufficient physical idiosyncrasies and expressions of the inner self to satisfy the most parochial definitions of portraiture. Requiring that the portrait subject had a historical existence sets portraiture apart from images of non-historical beings such as the gods, personifications of cities, principles or natural forces. The specificity of a portrait's reference sets portraits apart from visual stereotypes for entire classes of humanity such as "the old man," ".the foreigner," ".the beggar."45 I have excluded both classes of images from the present discussion. I have also excluded caricature, a distinct subset of portraiture in which the body is deliberately distorted toward comic ends and for which specificity and historicity of reference are requirements.46 In limiting portraiture to the depiction of human subjects, I exclude portrayals of pets, vehicles, homes, and flora unless these clearly index a human subject. I adhere, then, to the narrower of two common uses of the term, and to the sense adopted in recent portrait studies.47 The Oxford English Dictionary, on the other hand, dismisses this usage as obsolete, preferring a broader interpretation that embraces all forms of representation including figurative uses such as "something that repres- ents, typifies, or resembles something else," "a verbal description," "delineation of(any) object."48 In the same vein, Clark Hulse argues that exclusion of non-human subjects is arbitrary and that the restricted definition instantly produces a set of doubts, qualifications, and marginal cases. How direct must the referential link be between portrait and portrayed?... What aspect of "self," "being," or "identity" forms a reliable foundation either for likeness or for a licensed departure from likeness?...49 Portraiture of people may not be a neatly bounded genre, but I am reluctant to discard the human connotations of "portrait" simply because the genre's boundaries are not firmly mapped. To expand portrait" to mean nothing more precise than "representation" would deprive us of the best term available for comparing the many works of art that depict actual people and their variant con- structions of the individual human self. I prefer to take Hulse's questions as avenues rather than obstacles to a definition of this genre, by replacing a search for absolute standards with relative 44 Although I also recognize literature as a medium for portraiture. See for example Steiner, "The Semiotics of Genre," 111-19; and David M. Lubin, Act of Portrayal: Sargent, James and Eakins (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1985). 45 Spiro also makes the individuality of the subject central to her definition of portraiture, Contemplating the Ancients, 7-8. 46 On caricature, see Ernst Gombrich, Caricature (Harmondsworth, England: Penguin Books Ltd., I94), 10o-15; Judith Wechsler, "The Issue of Caricature," Artfournal 43, no. 4 (1983), 317-18; Brilliant, Portraiture, 69-70. 47 This is the primary definition in The Compact Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary (New York: Oxford University Press, 1971), vol. 2, 1146; in Brilliant, Portraiture, 8-9; and for Desai and Leidy, Faces of Asia, 5. 48 Oxford English Dictionary, vol. 2, 1146-47- 49 Clark Hulse, review of Portraiture, by Richard Brilliant, in Art Bulletin 75, no. 2 (1993), 327- 66</page><page sequence="9">assessments. Instead of asking how much a portrait must resemble its subject,5o I ask which devices it employs to represent the individual, and what information each device seems designed to transmit. Instead of wondering whether Indian images contain enough objective truth to qualify as portraits, I prefer to ask what constructions they embody. LITERARY EVIDENCE OF EARLY INDIC PORTRAITURE Inscribed labels beside the Ka-veri-region portraits clearly indicate these were originally intended to index specific people who lived during the ninth and tenth centuries. These sculpted reliefs also display physical idiosyncrasies and, as their gestures suggest, emotion and personality. Nor are these stray exceptions to some widely held aversion to portraiture in ancient India. Several scholars have read an ancient prohibition against portraiture in the following passage from the gukranztisara of Sukr-carya, a book of rules for making images: The images of gods yield happiness to men, and lead to heaven; but those of men lead away from heaven and yield grief... The images of gods, even if deformed, are for the good of men. But the images of men, even if well formed, are never for human good.5 This passage does not, however, single out portraiture for prohibition but inveighs against all human representation, presumably including mythological scenes and other narratives. And as Coomaraswamy himself points out, this very act of denunciation implies that such images were often made.52 Other literary references indicate that portraiture was encouraged in India before the ninth century and that numerous portraits were perceived by their contemporaries as successfully evoking the individual they claimed to represent. The Tamil epic Cilappatikadram by Ilafiko Atika! mentions the consecration in Kerala of a stone image representing the story's heroine, Kannaki.53 A much later Jaina text (1361) from North India, the Prabandhacintdmani, describes a number of kings erecting statues of themselves, their ancestors and their courtiers.54 Virginia Saunders remarks upon the frequency with which portraits (drawn, sketched or painted) appear in Sanskrit plays: "Sakuntala" and "M-lavika-gnimitra" by Kalidasa; "Ratnavali" and "Nagananda" by Harsa; "Malatim-adhava" and 50 Such a spectrum of degrees of likeness is implied in Hallett's approach to classical Greek renderings of satyrs: C.

The perceived likeness in the painted image is strong enough to subvert the disguise.56 The same painted panel includes a portrait of that queen's husband, which his second wife praises as "a good likeness."57 These fictive images capture the distinctive essence of individuals for their fictive viewers. Characters within the play recognize the portraits' subjects instantly and confidently, and their acts of recognition are critical to the movement of each plot. Indeed some of these storytellers extend the indexical dimension of portraits to magical proportions. Portraits stand in for their subjects: they introduce lovers, they trigger recognition of the beloved, or they keep lovers present for each other during separation. In the twelfth-century Naisadhacarita, Damayanti has an artist depict her with Nala in an unsuccessful attempt to satisfy her longing for him.58 When such portraits fail to substitute fully for their subject, characters express surprised disappointment.59 In the Citralaksana of Nagnajit, a text from the fifth or sixth century, the virtuous king Nagnajit brings a brahmin boy back from death by drawing the boy's portrait.6o In the Visnudharmottarapurdna, a fourth- or fifth- century text on painting, the sage Narayana draws a female form with mango juice and the drawing metamorphoses into the exquisite apsaras, Urvasi.I This drawing is admittedly not a portrait in the strictest sense because the drawing precedes the living model whereas portraits derive from pre- existing subjects, but this story shares with the Citralaksana the sense that only a thin line separates living people from their portraits. These stories present portrait-making in a favorable light. Brahma hails Nagnajit's drawing as the beginning of the art of painting (citra), and parallels are deliberately made between the act of in- fusing life into a picture and Brahma's own acts of creation.62 The Visnudharmottarapurdana states that Visnu invented painting "for the good of the people."'63 55 Virginia Saunders, "Portrait Painting as a Dramatic Device in Sanskrit Plays,"Journal of the American Oriental Society 39 (1919), 299-302.

In "Malavika-gnimitra," K-lid-sa hints at the use of individuated features when the king perceives something in Malavika's representation that differentiates it from the other images in a group portrait. Other treatises approach artistic representation as a matter of classification. The Visnudharmottarapurdina analyzes subjects as examples of type, and enumerates the signs (lakIsanas) appropriate to each type. These signs include proportion and demeanor as well as particular icono- graphic marks.64 B. N. Goswamy makes the important point that viewers could derive the sense that they were recognizing individuals from laksanas, which he defines as conventional signs indicative of generalized traits such as professional status or social rank.65 The Sadanga ("Six Limbs of Painting") praises "likeness" (sddrjya) of inner feeling rather than of outer form, likeness that does not rely on precise replication of surface peculiarities.66 Coomaraswamy saw in this attention to laksanas, to classification by type, and to depiction through natural simile, an impulse working against the representational specificity reported in plays. He postulated two separate traditions of individual representation: one reflected by the treatises in which the subject is idealized, categorized, and not readily recognizable; another embodied in the Sanskrit plays in which the portrait imitated the peculiar physical details of the model.67 I question whether the practice of classifying portrait subjects by type was perceived as contrary to the evocation of a specific individual. Such a perception would seem to imply that a person's social relationships were framed as peripheral to the individual self. Coomaraswamy notes a passage in the Vikramacdaritra histories in which viewers perceive that a portrait captured the queen's personal appearance (svarupam) and simultaneously represented her as the very beautiful "padmini type" of woman.68 The success of that portrait seems to derive from its capacity to conflate classifying features she shared with others and features that were her very own (sva). The spatial and temporal separation between artist and subject during the execution of most images would have encouraged artists to integrate their perceptions and their preconceptions. As Goswamy explains through an anecdote about a Nurpur painter, Indian artists worked primarily from memory;"69 that process encourages the mind's familiar categories to emerge and shape representation. A passage in the "Pratima Nataka," a play attributed to Bhasa and ascribed to various dates be- tween the first century B.C. and the ninth century A.D.,70 illustrates a specific ancient use for 64 See Shah's translation, ch. 5, Io8-Io, adhyaya 37-38. 65 Goswamy, "Essence and Appearance," I97. 66 See Abanindranath Tagore, Some Notes on Indian Artistic Anatomy and gaadanga or the Six Limbs ofPainting (Calcutta: Indian Society of Oriental Art, 1968), "Sadaaiga,"Iz-I4. The gadanga is a section of Vatsydyana's second-century Kdmasutra. Goswamy translates sadrSya as "resemblance": "Essence and Appearance," 196. Clay Lancaster describes it as a "conformity between objects and their portrayal" that need not originate in a precise replication of surface details: Clay Lancaster, "Keys to the understanding of Indian and Chinese painting: The 'Six Limbs' of Yasodhara and the 'Six Principles' of Hsieh Ho," TheJournal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism II, no. 2 (I952), 95-Io4- 67 See Coomaraswamy, "Ideal Portraiture," 74; and Molitor, Portraits in sechs Firstenstaaten Rajasthans, 15-16. 68Coomaraswamy, "Theory of Art in Asia," The Transformation of Nature in Art (Cambridge, Mass., I935; reprint ed., New York: Dover Publications, 1956), 32-33. 69 The painter produced a telling likeness after only the most fleeting glimpses of his subject.

In this passage, Bharata returns to Ayodhy- unaware that in his absence his father Daiaratha has died from grief. Before entering the city, Bharata visits an unfamiliar shrine and sees four statues. Learning from the shrine's keeper that these represent his great-great-grandfather, great-grandfather, grandfather and father, and that only the deceased may be so represented, Bharata realizes the sad truth. Others have read in this passage confirmation that ancient Indic portraits did not capture enough precise information about individuals even to permit a son to recognize his father's image.7I I perceive Bharata's inability to recognize immediately his father's portrait and his readiness to see the four sculptures as divine images as deriving instead from the very different expectations he brings to the encounter, expectations that he is entering a temple to some deity. What he actually sees tempts him to identify the sculptures as portraits, as his remarks demonstrate: What exquisite carving in these sculptures! How lifelike they are. Though these statues represent deities they look just like men. Is this a glorification of the four deities? Nay, be they what they may, they delight my heart.72 The keeper of the shrine observes that the sculptures look like Bharata: Who is this that has gone into the gallery? ...He strongly resembles the statues.73 Possibly he is noticing a family resemblance captured in the portraits. Possibly the keeper is re- sponding to laksanas embodying the royal bearing that the living prince shared with his forefathers images. Vishaka Desai points out that resemblances among such portraits would have been central to their function as portraits. Royal authority depended on popular perceptions of continuity: the king must perpetuate the glory of his ancestors. Any sculptural resemblance between Bharata and his ancestors could function as a deliberate sign of Bharata's greatness.74 Whether these resemblances were a matter of physiognomy, laksanas, or some combination of the two, the reactions of Bharata and the keeper suggest that those ancestral sculptures successfully bridged the distance between the living world and representation, and thus served as portraits for their initial audience. SCULPTURAL EVIDENCE OF EARLY INDIC PORTRAITURE The visual evidence of early Indic portraiture is primarily sculptural; though many portraits were surely painted, few have survived in that fragile medium. These visual traces bear out the literary indications of portraiture's popularity and its use of both individuating features and laksanas. They do not bear out Coomaraswamy's deduction that portraiture was delegated to amateur artisans as it was judged to have had "a merely personal and temporary value, not an ultimate spiritual signi- 71 See Coomaraswamy, Foreword to Portrait Sculpture, x-xi; and "Ideal Portraiture," 7. Molitor follows this reading, understanding Da'aratha's portrait to be idealized and thus "not like any man who really lived": Molitor, 13. Goswamy reads it more subtly, seeing in it a tradition of rendering individuals through the codified features (lakfanas) associated with the group to which that individual belonged rather than through the observation of unique physical details. Da'aratha's portrait may thus have fulfilled viewer expectations of a royal image, but not matched Bharata's specific associations with his father.

Indic sculptural remains (fig. IO) sketch an intriguingly coherent indigenous tradition of portraiture from at least the fifth century A.D. The objects that have so far come to light com- memorate three situations repeatedly in various combinations: family affiliation, pious generosity and heroism. FAMILY AFFILIATION The importance of family affiliation is manifest in traces of portrait sculptures in an otherwise un- decorated cave at Nanaghdt, excavated in the first century B.C. Nothing survives of these except the feet of three figures, but inscribed above the shadows of these and of four other large figures against the cave's rear wall are the names of the Satava-hana queen Nayanika who commissioned these portraits, her husband, father, father-in-law, and three Satavdhana princes.76 Inscriptions on the side walls of the cave describe sacrifices performed by queen Nayanik5's father-in-law and by Nayanikai herself after the deaths of her husband and father-in-law, implying that one purpose of this cave and its portraits was to mark this family's acts of pious generosity. The inscriptions also mention the martial heroism of Nayanika's husband. The Nanaghat cave recalls the portrait shrine of the "Pratima Nataka" in its use of familial relationships to frame the presentation of royalty. In both shrines, portrait sculptures of at least three successive generations of ancestors illustrate the con- tinuity of a royal lineage. Ndnagh-t's lack of divine imagery also recalls the portrait gallery in which Bharata could find "no external sign, neither weapon nor banner" of the deity it honored.77 These similarities suggest that we need not look as far as Western Asia to explain the presence of por- traiture at N-nagh-t.78 Nor does this tradition appear to have been short-lived. At Mor-, stone portraits of five generations of heroes were worshipped in a shrine during the second century A.D.79 A millennium later, in rII2, a Calukya general had carved and inscribed portraits of five pairs of his ancestors in the temple he sponsored at Itagi.80 In Mamallapuram, the seventh-century Adivaraha temple houses 75 Ananda K.

Foremost among these is Visnu who stands at the cave's center in his man-boar form, Varaha, rescuing the earth goddess, Prthvi.8 Otherwise this cave articulates a royal lineage of past, and possibly deceased, kings much like the shrine in the "Pratima Nataka." As at Nanaghat, these por- traits are over life-size, they are carved in deep relief against the inner walls of a cave temple, and they are identified by inscriptions incised above them. The portrait of the senior king in the Adivaraha sits on a lion-legged throne against the north wall, one hand resting on his leg and one raised in cin-mudrd which may signify lecturing (fig. 11).83 Facing him from across the cave, Mahendravarman seems to step and gesture eastward toward the shrine interior (fig. 12).84 Mahendravarman's prominent eyes and slight smile animate his face, and Simhavisnuvarman's lower lip is especially distended, but their sleek, athletic bodies exhibit no other distinctive physical marks. Two female figures, unidentified in the inscriptions, accompany each portrait and act most likely as laksanas, personifications of the kings' erotic and familial aspects.85 8' On these inscriptions and identification of the portrait subject, see R. B. H. Krishna Sastri, Two Statues of Pallava Kings and Five Pallava Inscriptions in a Rock-Temple at Mahabalipuram, Memoirs of the Archaeological Survey of India 26 (Calcutta: Government of India, 1926), 3-4; T.

Attempts to identify these as other similarly-named Pallavas require either that the monument was excavated during the very short reign of Mahendravarman II; or that it was excavated by Mahendravarman III whose reign follows that of Parame!vara I; or that the seated figure represents Narasimha I, the son of Mahendravarman I. Sitting in the presence of the standing father would be unusual. Cf. K. R. Srinivasan, "The Pallavas of Kifici: Phase I," in The Encyclopaedia of Indian Temple Architecture, vol.

The temple must precede the reign of Parame-vara I (reigned 672-700), the probable sponsor of an imprecatory inscription on the cave's floor.

The temple's leonine and complex columns indicate a later date than the reign of Mahendravarman, whose inscribed temples contain simpler, blocky columns. The Adivaraha's columns are, on the other hand, quite similar to those of the Dharmardja Ratha, on which one of Narasimhavarman's titles (Mdmalla) is carved. See K. R. Srinivasan, The Dharmaraja Ratha and Its Sculptures, Mahdbalipuram (New Delhi: Abhinav Publications, 1975), 85-90. 82Rabe proposes that the Varha figure was meant to evoke the patron himself: Michael D. Rabe, "The Mamallapuram PrafSasti: A Panegyric in Figures," Artibus Asiae 62, nos. 3/4 (1997), 228. 83 Banerjea and Lockwood interpret this gesture to indicate lecturing: Banerjea, The Development of Hindu Iconography; and Michael Lockwood, "Pallava Somaskanda," 2o. Rabe differs from this reading, identifying this mudrd as ahuya, which he interprets as "'inviting' to confer boons": "The Mimallapuram Prafasti," 233. 84 Mahendravarman's right hand encircles the wrist of the woman beside him as if to lead her toward the shrine. His free hand points toward Varaha in suci mudrd, an unusual gesture among images of this period, and perhaps an indication that he too is not adoring Varaha. Patdka mudrd is more commonly adopted by figures gesturing toward a deity, with the heel of the hand placed near the head. 85 On the erotic aspect of the kingship, see Ronald Inden,"Ritual, Authority and Cyclic Time in Hindu Kingship," in Kingship and Authority in South Asia, ed.

The portraits underline Pallavamalla's continuity with these forbears by depicting Pallavamalla in this narrative sequence, and in the same costumes and postures as earlier Pallava kings. The consistent individu- ation of Pallavamalla's body does set him apart from his predecessors (fig. 16), but if his short legs, thick thighs and waist, full cheeks and long eyes were at all mimetic, their presence in this genealogical sequence could have framed this particular individual as a fully qualified member of the Pallava dynasty by conveying simultaneously Pallavamalla's specific identity and his membership in the category of Pallava kings. HEROISM As reliefs in a narrative sequence, the Vaikuntha Perum5! portraits share more with memorial stones than they do with Nanaghat and the "Pratima Nataka." Memorial stones are stelae of various formats from many parts of India, erected from the first century until well into the second millennium A.D., to honor heroic deaths, most commonly the death of a warrior on the battlefield, or the self- immolation of a widow.90 Inscribed upon many of these stones are the names of the deceased, de- scriptions of the death, and pictorial representations of both. With this combination of features, memorial stones are likely indigenous sources for Indian portraiture, as Aravamuthan has 86On the patronage of this monument, see C.

A date well into Pallavamalla's reign is implied by the illustration in the historical narrative reliefs of battles fought some years after his accession. 87 The inscription accompanying the first scenes of Pallavamalla's accession describes him as "descended in this way from the originator Brahma" (ivvakaye brahmadnati-aka).

This sequence corresponds to the verbal genealogy in the KTaakkudi and Pattatta-!mafigalam grants of the Pallava kings.

See Mahalingam, Kd~cipuram in Early South Indian History, 144-49; and Burton Stein, "All the Kings' Mana: Perspectives on Kingship in Medieval South India," in All the Kings' Mana: Papers on Medieval South Indian History (Madras: New Era Publications, 1984), 38. 90 These free-standing stelae are termed variously cadyd-stambhas ("memorial pillars") in Andhra, virakkal ("hero stones") and satikkal ("satZ stones") in Tamil Nadu, and pdliya in Rajasthan. H. Sarkar puts the first stone at 89 A.D. in Gujarat: "The Ca-ya-stambhas from Na-garjunakonda," Memorial Stones: A Study of the Origins, Significance, and Variety, eds. S. Settar, Gunther D. Sontheimer, I.A.H. Series: no. 2, South Asian Studies: no. XI/II (Dharwad: Institute of Indian Art History, and New Delhi: South Asia Institute, 1982), 199. D. R. Patil suggests that cayd-stambhas dedicated to Buddhist monks who died naturally were the earliest form of memorial stone: "The Origin of Memorial Stones," Memorial Stones, 58. 73</page><page sequence="16">suggested.9' One of the earliest memorial stones is a memorial pillar (cdyd-stamba) dated 273 A.D. from Na-garjunakonda representing the Iksvaku king Santam-la in a series of portraits that characterize him through his familial relationships and his death in battle (fig. 17).92'In the lowest of the stele's four registers Santamula appears to receive tribute; in the next he is in battle mounted on an elephant; in the third register he is enthroned among men and women, perhaps in his court on earth; in the top register the king appears to be in heaven, seated with hieratic frontality and flanked by two women (his heavenly reward?).93 Corpulence and a distinctly square face help to establish one figure in each register as the central figure of the composition and thus as the beloved patriarch named in the inscription. Many later hero stones continued to employ sequential narrative (fig. 18) to depict warriors' battlefield heroics and their reward in heaven among lovely women.94 Their texts and imagery often focus more explicitly on the hero's death than Santamula's stone does. Inscribed upon a hero stone from Kil-Muttugur in Tamil Nadu (fig. 19) is the following Tamil passage: Prosperity! In the twenty-ninth year of king Parakesarivarman who conquered Madurai [i.e., A.D. 936 ] when cattle were lifted at Mukkuttur by the Permunadigal, Vadunavaran Varadan tandan having recovered [them] fell.95 Hero stones are usually to be found in the border regions where cattle raids and skirmishes took place, far from large religious monuments and urban centers.96 The Vaikuntha Perumal reliefs too have neatly boxed and stacked compositions, and their figures are less than half life-size. The scenes characterize a series of prominent men through their actions, and the actions portrayed include battles and holding court.

Crowning the relief composition is an image of a stupa. As are often found in sculpture carved under Iksv-aku patronage, the compositions are densely packed with several overlapping layers, and figures tend toward rubbery torsions and hyperextensions, elongated limbs, jutting elbows and hips. Figural style on memorial stones varies greatly from one region to the next, frequently reflecting the sculptural style found on other monuments in the locality. Apparently workshops responsible for stuipa slabs were also commissioned to carve memorial stones. See for example the sharp architectural orthogonals and elongated figures of the Iks vaku style found in the cdyd-stambha for Vammabhata from N-gdrjunakonda (H. Sarkar, "The Cdyi-stambha of N-garjunakonda,"Memorial Stones, fig. I); and the dense compositions and elegant carving, typical of sculpture at the Kailasanatha temple in Ellora, found in Rastrak-ta hero stones (S. Rajasekhara, "Rastrakata Hero-Stones: A Study," Memorial Stones, figs. 2-9). 94 For Tamil hero stones, see K. V. Soundara Rajan, "Origin and Spread of Memorial Stones in Tamil-Nadu," and S. Settar, "Memorial Stones in South India," Memorial Stones, 59-76 and I83-97. An example is also illustrated in Susan L. Huntington and John C. Huntington, Art of Ancient India (New York: Weatherhill, 1985), 340, fig. 15.27. 95 El 4, #22zzB and plate facing 178, as cited in Aravamuthan, Portrait Sculptures, 78. This and a similar stone from the same place are now housed at the Madras Museum. Aravamuthan cites the inscription on the second stone as El 4, #5zD and plate facing 360. 96 Most hero stones have been found in remote hilly areas: K. V. Soundara Rajan, "Origin and Spread of Memorial Stones in Tamil- Nadu," Memorial Stones, 6o, 71. They are more common in the northern and western sections of Tamil Nadu than in the central and southern sections: S. Settar, "Memorial Stones in South India," Memorial Stones, I85. Their remote locations, their valorization of battle, and their perceptions of the afterlife link hero stones, which were erected with greatest frequency between the sixth and twelfth centuries, to the tradition of hero worship evident as early as the Mahdbhdrata in the north and Sangam literature in the south (2nd-3rd centuries A.D.): Pierre Filliozat, "The After-Death Destiny of the Hero according to the Mahabharata," and K. V. Soundara Rajan, "Origin and Spread of Memorial Stones in Tamil-Nadu," both in Memorial Stones, 7, 62. These texts describe the practice of erecting stones to men who died in heroic demonstrations of protection and loyalty, they specify that hero stones should be placed along forest paths for travellers to worship, and that the company of women in the afterlife will be among the rewards of heroism: see S. Settar and M. M. Kalaburgi, "The Hero Cult: A Study of Kannada Literature from 9th to I3th Century," Memorial Stones, I7-36. 74</page><page sequence="17">kuntha Perumal shares so much of the visual tradition of memorial stones may indicate Pallava- malla's origins in remote sections of southern India where hero stones were common.97 The Vaikuntha Perumal reliefs are, certainly, modified to suit a royal agenda, its panels illustrating a broader range of activities including royal initiation ceremonies (fig. I5, lower right), a marriage, the donation of a temple. Sati stones are sites for the expression of a female idiom for heroic piety, and they too may commemorate that honored death through portraiture and narrative. Most translate the widow or her action into nonfigural representation (fig. 2o) - handprints (symbolic of action taken?), the sun and moon, pillars or cenotaphs (to commemorate death?), mounted warriors (her heroism?), or lingas (piety?). Some show satis in figural terms, even with their husbands.98 One particularly explicit example, a sixth-century piece from the Deccan, presents a voluptuous female reclining on her side amid leaping flames and observers who watch attentively or flee in alarm. A fragmentary inscription running above the flames appears to have named the sati and her husband and to have described the cause of her sacrifice.99 PIOUS GENEROSITY Each of the preceding portraits seems predicated to some degree on the great personal virtue of the represented individuals. Virtue in the form of spiritual devotion and pious generosity is the dom- inant attitude apparent in a number of other portraits in which donors surrender some aspect of themselves to the divine, along with a monetary gift or token such as flowers or fruit. In character- izing their subjects through feelings of devotion, these portraits echo a perception Owen Lynch has noted elsewhere in Indic culture, the sense that emotion lies at the very core of the self.I' In expressing those emotions through body gestures, they echo Frederique Marglin's finding that people may be characterized through the nature of their movements.IoI The strongest examples of such portraits are the inscribed Ka-ve-ri-area reliefs discussed below. Uninscribed figures with what I would call a "donor's demeanor" also occur at a number of sites throughout India from as early as the first century B.C., suggesting that this manner of com- memorating sacred gifts was an ancient and widespread Indic tradition. At Bharhut (fig. 2I),I"2 97 Pallavamalla's homeland has been understood as a "distant part of the Pallava country" by R. B. H.

The faces and bodies of the early figures do not all display strong physical idiosyncrasies, but most of the Kaverl-area portraits do. Inscribed figures of two eighteenth-century temple benefactors at Cidam- baram indicate that this mode of portraiture persisted in the south long after Mughals and Europeans had introduced their own forms of portraiture to other parts of the subcontinent.Io5 Donor figures bear no marks of royal status, but royalty did employ portraiture to mark their pious donations at a number of monuments. Some of these portraits present a deferential demeanor, as do the inscribed portraits of Rajaraja I Cola and his queen Lokamaha-devi on the Sivayoganatha temple at Tiruvilal-r (fig. 23).ln6 Both of these figures stand respectfully in the divine presence of a liigapitha, and the king wears no royal regalia or weapons. Others are more assertive. Pallavamalla's portraits at the Vaikuntha Peruma! address the viewer instead of an object of worship; instead of an offering, his hand may hold the scepter of authority (danda) or cin-mudrd, a gesture common for kings and teachers.Io7 Peculiar physical marks distinguish these portraits of Rajaraja and Pallavamalla. If such features were to any extent mimetic and served thereby to clarify the source of pious gifts, as a contemporary poem indicates the Vaikuntha Perumal! portraits successfully did,o08 these portraits could have enhanced these donors' royal authority. Both of these kings pursued policy that shifted the style of kingship away from the ideal of king as charismatic warrior hero and toward a perception of the king small donations from many, non-royal individuals: Vidya Dehejia, "Collective and Popular Bases of Early Buddhist Patronage: Sacred Monuments, IOO B.C. - A.D. 250," in The Powers of Art: Patronage in Indian Culture, ed. Barbara Stoler Miller (New York: Oxford University Press, 1992), 35-45. 103 Coomaraswamy proposes this as an "effigy of a donor portrait": Foreword to Portrait Sculptures, xii. Burgess illustrates the image without interpreting its function: Burgess, Buddhist Stupas, IO8-O9 and pl. LV, fig. 2. '04 Though larger than earlier donor figures, these are nevertheless smaller than the colossal Buddha images to which they offer worship. All kneel in the presence of the divine, turning their faces, bodies and gestures toward the object of worship in supplication. At Aurangabad, four figures place their hands in anjali mudrd. One holds out a garland toward the Buddha. The Ajant-a donor proffers a cup. Pia Brancaccio presents a careful and convincing reading of these Aurangabad figures as aristocratic donors, possibly the Asmaka or another group previously subordinate to the Vakataka but gaining in independence with the dissolution of that dynasty: "I1 Complesso Rupestre di Aurangabad," Dottorato di Ricerca in Archeologia Rapporti tra Oriente ed Occidente, VII Ciclo, Istituto Universitario Orientale - Napoli, 61-82. Aravamuthan and Burgess had earlier suggested the AjantF and Aurangabad figures as donor portraits: Aravamuthan, Portrait Sculptures, 8-9; Burgess, Buddhist Cave Temples, 47, pl. 37, fig.

Aravamuthan read the prominent lower lip on the undamaged Aurangabad figures as individuation, but such faces are common at other contemporary monuments in this region, such as the murals of Ajanta's Cave I.

PORTRAITURE AS A KUSANA IMPORT? All three themes appear as early as the first and second centuries A.D. in portraits sculpted for the Kusa-na kings and their subjects, raising the possibility that portraiture was after all an idea imported to the subcontinent, but by the Kusanas who came from Central and Western Asia. John Rosenfield has demonstrated that the Kusanas did import other ideas from Western Asia including numismatic portraiture, and styles of kingship and sculpture. The Kusanas struck a great many coins with impressions of the reigning king, sometimes as a bust-length portrait, sometimes as a full-length figure, standing or seated. The confrontational manner of Iranian royal portraiture informs these Kusa-na figures' standing, splay-footed pose; their seated, spread-kneed pose; the clubs, swords and spears prominently displayed; the converging folds of their billowing equestrian pantaloons. The bust format and the use of pronounced facial idiosyncrasies on these coins are concepts probably imported from the Mediterranean, which active trade routes linked to the Kusgma empire.no Also in a Mediterranean manner, the versos of Kusana coins depict divinities on the coins' recto sides. The peculiar physiognomies on Kusana coins are just as likely as those of Roman and Greek coins to be non-mimetic.m Different portraits of a Kusana king have different individualized appearances. On some coins Huviska's face bears a close resemblance to Errol Flynn and on others an eerie likeness to Walter Brennan.' These idiosyncratic features thus appear to have functioned not as reflections of Huviska's actual appearance, but as signs, conventions, laksanas, expressing their meanings in ways that were thus not alien to Indic modes of reading them. The impact of such portraiture on later Indian numismatics was, at any rate, glancing. A numis- matic profile bust of Gautamiputra Satakarni, with a large nose and receding chin, suggests that Kusa-na styles of coinage were influential in Andhra around the first century A.D." Gupta coins did adopt full-figure, profile images of the king with legends and deities on the verso elaborating upon the king's nature. But even by the mid-fourth century, the coins of Samudragupta portray the ruler in a more relaxed pose. Royal faces no longer display peculiar features.

"1 Compare Rosenfield, Dynastic Arts, pl. 3, #74 and #67. Rosenfield notes such discrepancies too, suggesting that two different Kusa-na kings shared the name Huviska, or that such facial variations illustrate the aging process, but Rosenfield acknowledges that neither of these possibilitites can adequately explain the inconsistencies among the coin portraits: ibid., 60-65. 113 See Sir Alexander Cunningham, Coins of Ancient India from the Earliest Times Down to the Seventh Century A.D.

XII.8. 77</page><page sequence="20">fourth century, Candragupta II inaugurates the Cakra Purusa coin type in which the Gupta king identifies himself as Visnu's devotee (bhaktin), clearly subordinating himself to his god. During the mid-fifth century, Kumaragupta I presents the Apratigha ("one who is without anger") coin type in which the king gestures as if to abdicate while his son and wife beseech him to remain king. By contrast Kusana kings are depicted as maintaining a tight grasp on their weapons. Here it is the Gupta king's family that lends meaning to his portrait. The imploring queen and prince serve as emblems for the entire state in its desire to be ruled and kingship is idealized as a responsibility generously taken on by a fatherly ruler.I Pallava coinage reflects an even greater independence, and perhaps unawareness, of Kusana modes in that it does not depict the king figurally at all but rather prefers crests and emblems. Animals and Nandi in particular are the most frequent numismatic forms. Other coins feature a ship or a temple resembling the Mamallapuram Bhima Ratha.II5 The other two forms Kusana portraiture takes on, the donor portrait and the royal portrait housed in an ancestral shrine, existed in India before the Kusana period and persisted in similar forms afterward. Many uninscribed figures from the Kusaga period exhibit the donor's demeanor found earlier at Bharhut, expressing their deference through a bowed head or a body twisted attentively toward the object of devotion. They also display devotion with their hands, making offerings or placing their palms together in anjali mudrd. Such figures are considerably smaller than the objects of their adoration and they appear in the margins of sculptural compositions.n6 Three inscribed examples of this type also exist, all three found near the Kusanas' central Indian capital and not at their capital on the northwestern fringe of the subcontinent,n7 implying that artisans within India were perhaps more familiar with this mode of portraiture than artists in closer contact with points west. Distinctive physical features appear rarely in these donor portraits. When they do, as in the couple carved on an image base from Shotorak,ns they probably reflect Mediterranean traditions once again. These donor figures may have operated at an even greater semiotic distance from their subjects than the numismatic portraits did. A pedestal bearing four donor figures is inscribed as the gift of a man named Karatita.n9 A pedestal with an inscription mentioning only the gift of a Lady Vidyamati depicts five female figures and six males worshipping S*kyamuni.? A single figure at the feet of a Jain image wears the tunic, pants and wide belt of a male, but the inscription refers to the gift of a 14 My analyses of Gupta coins are based on Joanna G.

These disjunctions of number and gender suggest that formulaic donor images were carved before actual donors were found, and thus before inscriptions were added. Such confidence that donors would be found, and that donors would want themselves reflected figurally on their purchases, implies that the tradition of donor portraiture was already deeply ingrained in the Mathura region. At M-ton in the outskirts of Mathura and at Surkh Kotal, now in Pakistan, the Kusanas erected shrines to house life-sized, free-standing portraits of at least three generations of Kusana kings, a visual genealogy articulating royal legitimacy through family affiliation, in the manner of the "Pratima Nataka," Nanaghat, Mora and the later Vaikuntha Perum.l temple.m Like Kusana coins, these portraits presented an overtly alien rhetoric of kingship imported from Western Asia, visible in their confrontational stances, in the menacing way they palm their weapons, and their equestrian costumes, reminders that outsiders were in charge. Unlike the coin portraits, these stone portraits, now decapitated, probably wore impassive expressions and smooth, geometricized features.23 Pre- cedents for that treatment of the face existed in Western Asia, and perhaps in India. The laksanas appropriate to royal Kusan portraiture appear to have varied with medium. At any rate, the systematic vandalism to which the Mat images were subjected soon after the installation of the third king's portrait suggests that contemporary viewers were able to perceive the portraits' indexical re- ference toward the resented dynasts. The M-t shrine shares several features with the Pallavas' Adivaraha temple at Mamallapuram.14 Both housed a portrait of a dynastic patriarch seated upon a leonine throne and accompanied by at least one standing portrait of his descendants. All are rendered in stone, in large scale and deep relief,z with strong youthful bodies much like those of contemporary depictions of the gods. Visitors to either shrine would have found themselves flanked by these portraits and confronted by their gestures and glances.12 Given that the designers of the Adivaraha could not have known directly of the Kusana shrine, which was over one thousand miles away and had been buried under I Compare Rosenfield, Dynastic Arts, pl. 42, and the inscription published by H. Liiders, "Epigraphical Notes," Indian Antiquary 33 (1904), lo3; and El I, #11, 387. 122 My information on Mat and Surkh Kotal comes primarily from Rosenfield, Dynastic Arts, 140-51,154-163. The Surkh Kotal figures are not inscribed. At Mat, the standing figure is inscribed as Kaniska: EI 8 (1905-o6), 176; EI 24 (1937), 2II. The figure seated on a leonine throne may represent Vima Kadphises: V. S. Agrawala, "Catalogue of the Mathura Museum: Jaina Tirthaftikaras and other Miscellaneous Figures,"Journal of the United Provinces Historical Society 23 (1950o), 40-42; but see Rosenfield, 144-45. A pedestal for another standing figure probably held a portrait of Huviska: V. S. Agrawala, "Catalogue of the Mathura Museum: Architectural Pieces,"Journal of the United Provinces Historical Society 24 (I95I), 132-33; and Rosenfield, 146-47. Several scholars have noted similarities between Mdt and the "Pratima Nataka": K. A. Nilakanta Sastri, "The Cult of Devardja in Kambuja," Transactions of the Archaeological Survey of South India 3 (1957-58), 1-2; Aravamuthan, South Indian Portraits, 78-79; Rosenfield, Dynastic Arts, 150o-51. Rabe argues that the large Descent/Penance relief in Mamallapuram provides an illustration of dynastic lineage being expressed through portrait sculpture: "The Mdmallapuram PraSasti." 123 If a carved head found nearby resembles the heads once carved on the shrine portraits. For a photograph of that head, see Rosenfield, Dynastic Arts, pl. 4. 124 Aravamuthan dismissed the significance of similarities between these two monuments, but he also had underestimated those similarities, assuming as he did that the Adivardha portraits represented patrons of the temple rather than the patron's ancestors: Aravamuthan, South Indian Portraits, 79. 21 The Kusana portraits are free-standing sculptures designed to be seen only from the front where their surfaces are finished. The Adivardha portraits are carved almost fully in the round but they remain attached to the wall. 16Mahendravarman's and Simhavisnuvarman's portraits face the central space of the Adivaraha shrine from the south and north walls, respectively. Visitors enter the shrine from the west. Though excavations did not record the original disposition of any of the Mat portraits except Vima's, which faced viewers from the shrine's back (west) wall, the other figures are likely to have been arranged as they were at Surkh Kotal - on the south and north walls, facing inward. See Rosenfield, Dynastic Arts, 140-58. 79</page><page sequence="22">rubble for the preceding five hundred years, similarities between these monuments suggest that they both participated in a widespread tradition of ancestral portrait shrines. Differences between the Mat and Mamallapuram variants on this tradition imply, on the other hand, that this form did not originate or change permanently with the Kusanas. Most significant among these differences is the tone with which the portraits confront viewers. As Rosenfield has demonstrated, the signs of pugnacious demeanor in the Mat portraits derived from West Asian royal portraiture and contrasted with contemporary Andhra sculptures' emphasis on the king's protective aspect. The Adivaraha portraits revert to gentler images of kingship. Neither king is armed. Mahendravarman smiles slightly as he makes eye contact and his pointing hand seems to invite viewers deeper into the temple. Instead of sitting in the legs-pendant posture of West Asian sculpture, Simhavisnuvarman tucks one leg onto his chair in the more relaxed lalitasana found on numerous Indian representations of kings. The languorous female figures accompanying the Pallava kings read as companions; the only female figure found at Mat is much smaller than the royal figures and poses frontally with a lion at her feet.i SUMMARY Textual references and sculptural remains indicate that portraits were made on the Indian subcontinent before the arrival of the Mughals, and even before the Kusanas. Portraits executed under the Kusagas introduced numismatic portraiture and a new kind of belligerence to the ideals of kingship, and these had only a glancing impact on later South Asian portraiture. Portraiture itself was not among the alien ideas Kusanas brought to India, but was already in use there for donors and dynastic lineages, practices the Kusanas may have learned in India. In Indic portrait sculpture, individuation was not always located in the face, nor was it reserved for the representation of com- moners, as the Vaikuntha Peruma-! portraits of Pallavamalla demonstrate. And individuation was not perceived to function in opposition to information about the subject's group affiliations. Classifica- tion and individuation of the subject could contribute cooperatively to the image's recognizability. PORTRAITS IN THE KAVE RI REGION, 9TH-IoTH CENTURY Twelve relief carvings in five villages of the Ka-ve-ri delta (fig. 24) demonstrate the frequent practice of portraiture in South India between circa A.D. 870 and 970. Many similar reliefs exist throughout the region from this "Early Cola" period and later, suggesting that the practice was yet more widespread, but I have concentrated here on the twelve earliest examples that most clearly articulate the existence of portraiture. Incised into the wall beside seven of these reliefs are inscriptions identifying the represented individual by name; the other five resemble the inscribed examples substantially. I have summarized several aspects of these portraits in Figure 25. Two of the reliefs represent women, the other ten men. Three of these identifying inscriptions specify that the person represented contributed funds to build the temple his portrait adorns. The reliefs demonstrate two formats, which I have named after the towns housing inscribed examples of them: the TiruviSalur type and 117 For an illustration, see Rosenfield, Dynastic Arts, fig. 9. 80</page><page sequence="23">the Tiruvaduturai type. The Tiruvisaluir portrait type also appears at Pufijai, Cakrappalli and Tiruvilakkudi. All of these small figures take up postures of religious devotion, reflections of their inner selves, and they exhibit physical features distinguishing them from divine representations and from each other. Etched shallowly into the exterior walls of Hindu temples, they establish a vivid link between Hindu piety and the depiction of individuals. Nor can one dismiss these reliefs as products of alien cultural influence: the format of these portraits has much in common with memorial stones from the same region, and their expressive content shares deeply in the Hindu devotionalism expressed in contemporary Tamil poetry. These twelve reliefs illustrate what I define as Phase I of portraiture in the Kaveri region, which extended from the second half of the ninth century until circa 970. I will discuss the second phase, which lasted from circa 970 into the early eleventh century, at greater length in a separate study. In short, portraits of Phase I are distinguished by an encircling frame that separates them from the surrounding wall and from other sculptures, setting them in a fictive space that they share with a liigapz.tha. Portraits of Phase 2 stand free of such frames, thereby appearing to interact directly with the large, niched sculptures of the deities (devakostha) beside them. Inscriptions beside portraits of Phase I are more likely to cast their subject's identity in terms of the locality with which he or she was affiliated, whereas those of Phase 2 emphasize instead the subject's affiliation with the Cola family. As previous scholarship has only dealt briefly with these reliefs and the temples they adorn, I present below my detailed analysis of the temples' construction dates and sculptural styles. None of the portrait inscriptions I have found mentions a date for the portrait itself, but each portrait appears contemporary with the architectural fabric around it. Since I am not fully convinced by the techniques so far proposed for determining the dates of these monuments, I explain my reasons for dating them as I do and I draw at times more heavily on my predecessors' raw data in charts and appendices than I do on their interpretations of that data. TIRUVISALJR Tiruvisalur contains a highly detailed portrait in good condition and clearly inscribed (fig. 1).28 All the elements of this composition, a small figure of a man worshipping a iliga and surrounded by various implements of worship, are carved in low relief and enclosed in a small frame. This portrait adorns a subshrine of the Sivayoganatha temple in Tiruviialur (fig. 26) which I judge, on the basis of architectural style, to have been originally constructed early in the tenth century. The subshrine bearing Anantaiivan's portrait appears to have been one of seven detached, single- story subshrines (parivdrTdayas), each dedicated to one of the seven mother goddesses (saptamdtrka) that once surrounded Tiruviialur's main temple. Such shrines may not have been unusual features of Klverl temple complexes,"9 but as only a few have survived it is difficult to know whether such subshrines were a common location for donor portraits. At Tiruviialur, remnants of six of these 128 The portrait is among those noted by Aravamuthan, Portrait Sculpture, 34; and David T. Sanford, "Early Temples Bearing Ramayana Relief Cycles in the Chola Area: A Comparative Study," (Ph.D. Dissertation, University of California, Los Angeles, 1975), 80. "'9 Balasubrahmanyam found parivdrdlayas at several temples and presumed them to have once been a standard feature of temples of this period: S. R. Balasubrahmanyam, Early Chola Temples (New Delhi: Orient Longman, 1971), 327-29. Dhaky, on the other hand, believes them to have been rather rare: M. A. Dhaky, Encyclopaedia, 150o. 81</page><page sequence="24">shrines now stand in the courtyard (fig. 27) and all except the subshrine bearing Anantasivan's portrait, which is now used as a storehouse, have been substantially renovated. Siva Vinadhara occupies the niche on the east wall of Anantaiivan's subshrine (fig. 28), and Siva Bhiksatana the niche on the south wall (fig. 29). The western niche is now empty. Although the occupants of the main niches are Saiva, the shrine may have been dedicated to Vaisnavi, the mother goddess who embodies aspects of Visnu: several of the kantha panels (tiny reliefs located among the basement moldings) depict incarnations of Visnu. Narasimha appears on the south wall of the shrine, just east of the devakostha niche (fig. 30); Trivikrama is represented on the west end of the north wall (fig. 31). On the west wall, just south of the devakos.tha, is a depiction of the parinirvadna of the Buddha who is sometimes listed as one of Visnu's avatars. Anantasivan's subshrine stands south of a large pillared hall (mahdamandapa) added to the eastern end of the main temple at a later date, meaning that this subshrine originally occupied the southeast corner of the complex where it would have been one of the first spots visited during circumambula- tion of the central temple. An enclosing wall around the temple complex, also a later addition, incorporates this subshrine's south wall. The walls of Anantasivan's subshrine are interrupted on the north by a central doorway and two rough flanking niches, and in the center of the other three walls by a simply-framed large devakostha niche. The rough niche east of the entrance contains a large, fanged and chubby dwarf (bhfta) posing as a door guardian (dvdrapdla). Anantaiivan's portrait is beyond this bhita, at the eastern end of the same wall. The portrait's location is somewhat unusual. Most contemporary portraits appear on the south wall of the main temple. But on the north wall of a subshrine south of the main temple, Ananta- *ivan's portrait still greets the viewer who has just begun to circumambulate the main temple, introducing one to the experience of the temple and announcing the important contribution of a private individual. A briefTamil inscription just above the portrait reads: Hail! Prosperity! Anantaiivan, also known as Panaikkali Atika!, who belongs to the town of Mulaiyur, built this pavillion in Kuficirakkay, a place that possesses an army. Svasti! Sri! pataikol kuficirakkay imantakafi ceyvittu mulaiy irutaiyan panaikkali atika!kiya anantacivan.130 While no term for "portrait" is mentioned, the inscription's location just above the relief and the circumscribing line that links the inscription to the relief imply that the inscription refers to the relief image (fig. 32). The two parameters through which the inscription defines Anantasivan's identity are his status as an a.tikal, meaning "important man" or "chief personage,"'I and his town, '30 For assistance in translating this and other inscriptions in this essay, I am grateful to Kausalya Hart, Lecturer in Tamil at the University of California, Berkeley, for her generous assistance.

It was common practice for residents of small towns of the Kaveri area to patronize temples in other small towns of the region.32 In front of Anantasivan and at the level of his torso is a small, garlanded lifgapptha. Beneath that are a tall oil-lamp and three vessels, one of which contains a conch shell. Hanging directly above Anantasivan's outstretched hands is an elaborate arrangement of flower garlands. These elements are set within a frame that replicates, in detail as fine and in proportions as spindly as those of the composition, the modulated pilasters and projecting cornice molding of this period's full-scale temples,I3 as if we are to understand the figure as standing within a sacred structure. Anantaiivan's portrait is thirty-six centimeters high. His long form twists slightly, his shoulders tilting toward the viewer as his feet and face turn toward the lifgapitha and he advances the right foot slightly toward the object of his worship. Whereas Aravamuthan interprets the hand positions as a gesture of soliciting boons,34 I read the devotee as offering something to the lifgapitha. In the left hand Anantaiivan holds a small object, perhaps a flower. Anantasivan's simple clothing leaves much of his body uncovered. He wears a single necklace, an armlet above each elbow, and a short cloth around his hips. The thin garment clings to his legs. Anantasivan's legs are long and very slim, with some musculature indicated in the thigh. The right knee hyper-extends slightly. Except for a small roll of flesh at his waist, his torso is lean and narrow. His ribcage appears too skinny for the wide shoulders it supports, a distortion produced perhaps by the sculptor's desire to show the shoulders frontally and the ribcage twisting toward the lifgap.tha. Anantasivan's broad shoulders, narrow ribcage, the small roll of flesh above his waist, and even his hyper-extended knee are features that also characterize the Bhiksatana and Vin-dhara images on this temple. His face compares in general terms with that of Vinddhara: both faces are softly tapered ovals with low foreheads and small mouths (figs. I and 28). In this, the portrait shares in the general style of that monument and articulates the somatic bond that unites this devotee with Siva, the object of his devotion. The features of Anantaiivan's body also describe him as a specific person: the devotee who longs to join Siva's body is a particular individual. The slim ribcage establishes his particularity and perhaps the wasted body of unrequited longing for divine union. Vinadhara's features project cleanly from the masses of the face while Anantasivan's features are flattened between his cheeks. The transition from Anantasivan's forehead to his eye sockets is a blunt, rounded curve unlike the sharp brow line that marks the clean intersection of two planes on Vin-dhara's face. Anantasivan's coiffure, a small topknot with the rest of the hair shaven or pulled tightly toward the top, is more severe than the deity's flowing locks. Several other aspects of Anantaiivan's portrait distinguish the subject from the gods. The portrait is less that one-third the height of the devakos.tha figures and is carved in much shallower relief. Whereas the Siva images stand in niches framed by pilasters and an ornamental lintel, the portrait is I32 James Heitzman, "Networks of Social Control in Early South India: Lordship in the Chola State," paper presented at the 43rd annual meeting of the Association for Asian Studies, University of Wisconsin, Madison, April 1991; and "Temple Urbanism in Medieval South India,"Journal of Asian Studies 46 (1987), 791-826. '33 Elements of the columns resemble those of other Kdver! pilasters: a rounded potikai, virakantha, palakai, padma, kumbha, tati, slight kalaSa, padmabandha, and mdldsthana. The carving of the architectural members is slightly irregular, but detailed enough to include the small swags of the mdldsthdna ornament. These elements are most clearly labeled and identified by Douglas Barrett, Early Cola Architecture and Sculpture (London: Faber and Faber Limited, 1974), fig. I, 125.

Anantaiivan has two arms rather than four, and he carries none of the attributes that mark Bhiksatana and Vina-dhara. Thus he seems to make no claim to the powers possessed by the deities. He also turns more clearly away from a frontal stance than Vinadhara and Bhiksatana do, suggesting that he is worshipping rather than offering himself for worship. His ribcage twists to the right, and he reaches across his chest with a gesture that blocks visual access to himself and redirects it toward the lifigapitha. The body language with which he makes his offering is earnest and unpretentious. Where Bhiksa-tana bends easily in the leg that bears no weight, the knee of Anantasivan's free leg appears to be locked. While there is a relaxation in Bhiksatana's shoulders and an easy flow of line along his side, Anantasivan's back arches as his hips project ahead of his shoulders and his elbows drop simply from his shoulders. Inscriptions are not helpful in assessing the date of Anantaiivan's subshrine. They simply indicate a terminus ante quem of A.D. 965.135 Architectural and sculptural style are more promising sources, to which I have applied Douglas Barrett's and Gerda Hoekveld-Meijer's schemes, although neither author has analyzed this subshrine or the central temple.136 These schemes have been worked out for temples' main structures, however, and not for their subshrines which are smaller and tend to be decorated more simply. Fortunately, the main Sivayoganatha temple at Tiruviialur and Ananta- sivan's subshrine appear to be contemporary, so a date derived from Barrett and Hoekveld-Meijer for the main temple should apply to the subshrine as well. Barrett's classification of ground plans and molding types reveals one consistent chronological pattern among the architectural features he surveys: ardhamandapas with no devakostha niches at all seem to have been built only before 940 in the Ka-veri region.37 For temples from that region, he also attributes ardhamandapas containing one niche in each wall to the same early year.38 The Tiruvisalur ardhamandapa bears only one devakostha niche in each wall, and that looks rudimentary - simple holes cut abruptly into the wall, unframed by any of the usual pilasters and foliate arches (makara-torana), as if they were last-minute revisions of a plan for an un-niched ardhamandapa (figs. 27 and 33). Barrett's classification of molding combinations and ground plans invites one to believe that monuments sharing molding types or plans could be contemporary. The Sivayoganatha's combina- tion of basement moldings matches Barrett's type C.4, a type that also occurs at Lalgudi and Kiliyanur, important examples of Barrett's First Phase (866-940).39 The ground plan of the vimdna 135 An inscription on the same wall as Anantasivan's portrait records a gift made in the fifth year of Aditya II, thus in 965. That is summarized in ARSIE for Ipo7, inscription #51 of 1907; and Rangacharya, vol. 2, #420, 1284. The Tamil text appears without translation in SII 23, #51, 30-31. 136 The temple is not part of the surveys done by Barrett, Hoekveld-Meijer or the Encyclopaedia, although Hoekveld-Meijer mentions it in a footnote as one of the "renovated temples which are true copies of older ones judging by the refinement of their decoration." Gerda Hoekveld-Meijer, Koyils in the Colanamdalam: Typology and Development of Early Cola Temples (Amsterdam: Krips Repro Meppel, 1981), 324, n. 18. My impression of the building in 1985 and 199o0 was that, whenever reconstruction had occurred, it was done with stones dressed during the first three quarters of the tenth century. I37 Barrett, Architecture and Sculpture, 136. 138 Forms I.b and II.b in Barrett, Architecture and Sculpture, Appendix 4, 133-37. One-niched ardhamandapas continue into Barrett's Phase III mostly at temples located well outside the Kaveri region or at what Barrett terms Phase II temples, a classification I find unconvincing. ,39 Barrett, Architecture and Sculpture, Appendix 2, 126-30. 84</page><page sequence="27">at Tiruviialur falls under Barrett's type B.3, occurring in K-averi temples of all Barrett's phases, but especially common among those of his First Phase.o40 Hoekveld-Meijer finds three constant ratios operating throughout the development of Cola- period architecture, and two of these apply to temples built within the Kaveri region between the years 900oo and 970. The first is "a specific relation between the layout [i.e., ground plan], the height and the number of pilasters of the first tala" of the vimdna." 4 The ground plan of the Tiruvi'alur temple would fall under her classification II.2.b."42 This code signifies that the temple is two talas high (type II); the surface of its vimdna walls delineate a single plane interrupted only by one projection for the devakostha (type 2); and each of these walls is punctuated by six pilasters (type b). According to Hoekveld-Meijer's chronological mapping of the various vimdna ground plans, type II.2.b is used in the Kave-ri region between 870 and 940.43 Hoekveld-Meijer's second ratio describes the relationship between the width of the ardhamandapa and the way in which the ardhamandapa is connected to the vimdna. In this aspect, the Sivayoganatha exemplifies her type I-A-I which has one niche on each face of the vimdna (I-); its ardhamandapa is narrower than its vimdna and it joins that portion without a "false antardla" (-A-); and the ardhamandapa has only one niche on each wall (-I). Hoekveld-Meijer's survey finds type I-A-I occurring in the K-averi region between A.D. 885 and g91o only.44 The combined evidence of these two criteria would place the original construction of the Tiruvisalur temple sometime after A.D. 885 and before 91o. Barrett's and Hoekveld-Meijer's methods therefore agree on a date between g91o and 940 for the main temple at Tiruviialur.45 A contemporary date for Ananta-ivan's subshrine is suggested by similarities between the forms of subshrine and main temple. Though the subshrine's moldings are simpler, as one could expect in a subsidiary building,46 the lowest molding of each structure rises from the same ground level, a significant fact in this quickly rising alluvial plain. The friezes of playful dwarves (bhAtamdlds), for example, that run beneath the overhanging roof cornices (kapita) of both buildings display similar verve and depth of carving, despite the layer of whitewash that partially obscures the carvings on Anantasivan's subshrine (figs. 34-35). On both buildings these playful members of Siva's retinue have extremely round bellies that drag to the ground. They cavort and bounce around the temple, and their knees project as round, boneless bubbles on either side of their bellies. Their feet are rarely visible. Their faces are especially round, with swollen cheeks and prominent eyebrows. A legible portrait relief, clearly linked to an inscription identifying the image as a depiction of a specific, historical individual establishes Tiruvisaluir as a type site for other sites in the region.

Sanford, "A Comparative Study," 180. Balasubrahmanyam dates the Tiruvilalir temple to the reign of Aiditya I (reigned after 871-908 A.D.) on the basis of a high regnal date mentioned in an inscription; he dates the reconstruction to the reign of Parantaka I (reigned 90o8-54 A.D.). Part of his argument, however, is that Anantaiivan's subshrine was originally the central shrine of the place, a suggestion the shrine's orientation and plan make untenable. Balasubrahmanyam, Early Art, 170, 172, 24o. 146 The subshrine's moldings match Barrett's very basic type A.2. See Barrett, Architecture and Sculpture, Appendix z, z126-30o. 85</page><page sequence="28">Architectural and sculptural style concur in suggesting a date within the first phase of this region's stone temple architecture. PUNJAI The southern ardhamandapa wall of the Naltunai livara temple at Pufijai bears a relief of two men worshipping a liigapTtha (fig. 2). To my knowledge, no inscription at that temple identifies these images as portraits, but the features they share with the inscribed portrait at Tiruvisalur suggest that the Pufijai images are portraits as well.47 The architecture of the Naltunai Isvara temple (figs. 36 -37) suggests a date in the first half of the tenth century for the original construction of the temple and the portrait relief. The Pufijai relief, though it depicts two male figures rather than one, is a miniature scene of linga worship much like the Tiruvisalur portrait. The central figure in the Pufijai relief advances with his right leg, shifting all his weight from his left and appearing to sway toward the lifigapitha. His posture clearly identifies his role as worshipper rather than object of worship. His torso is almost frontal while his face and legs twist into profile, directing the viewer's eye from the portrait to the lifgaptha. He tilts his face reverently toward the li gapitha and raises his hands over his head in anjali mudrd. Enhancing the drama and fervor of that gesture, his hands break the frame of the relief panel. This figure is clothed as simply as Ananta'ivan though the details of his dress are somewhat different. Both wear armlets and neither wears any shirt, but instead of a necklace the Pufijai figure has a sacred thread (yaj#opavZta) across his chest. Although his hips are now obscured by the mortar used to reconstruct this temple, the bareness of his thighs implies that the carving once depicted no more than a small cloth twisted through his legs instead of the short, draped garment Anantasivan wears. The smooth, shallow hairline across this figure's forehead suggests hair cropped close to the head. The sacred thread, and perhaps also the distinctive dress and short hair, may signify that the subject was a brahmin. Pufijai was a brahmadeya, one of the tax-free villages granted to brahmin communities by Cola kings and their predecessors;148 the land-holders, temple patrons and donors in such communities were usually brahmins.49 It is likely, then, that a brahmin donor might have funded construction of the Naltunai Isvara temple and marked the monument with his portrait. These figures communicate a strong sense of their subjects' specificity. One would not readily confuse the figure closest to the lifgapitha with Anantasivan's portrait. The Pufijai image displays a rather bulbous physique. Beneath his narrow chest and shoulders spreads a buoyant, spherical belly. His thighs are fuller than Anantaiivan's and their gentle contours connote soft, relaxed flesh. His features just as clearly distinguish this figure from other figures on the Pufijai temples. His swaying form lacks the powerful solidity of the Agastya and Ganefa sculptures near him. His head is heart- '47 Sanford refers to the Pufijai and Tiruvisalur panels as "donor panels": "A Comparative Study," 178 and fig. 53.a. Barrett notes the presence of the panel, though he does not discuss it: Architecture and Sculpture, 82. Aravamuthan does not mention these images although he mentions the site by its alternate name "Kidaramkondan": Portrait Sculpture, 40. 148 An inscription on this temple refers to this village as "Tirunannipalli, a brahmadeya in Akkur-nadu:" ARSIE for p924-25, #180 of 1925, 33. I49 See Noboru Karashima, South Indian History and Society: Studies from Inscriptions (A.D. 85o-i8oo) (Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1984), I-31.

Long eye- brows reach almost to the ears, emphasizing this breadth. The portrait's lower lip is particularly full and the tip of its nose a bit squashed. Beyond these individuating details, the Pufijai devotee's form assimilates him toward the rotund images of Agastya and Ganesa with which the portrait shares the south ardhamandapa wall (fig. 38), images that lie in the path of his fervent gestures. His face even resembles Agastya's in its long, flat nose, prominent cheekbones and heavy, wide cheeks. Despite its smaller and more shallowly carved format, the portrait's body evokes the beloved divine body. Though this figure dominates the portrait panel with his active silhouette, another figure is discernible behind him. Again, the sculptor has taken pains to present him as uniquely individual. The second figure is somewhat shorter (forty centimeters as compared to forty-four centimeters) and is carved in yet shallower relief. This man sports a short beard and perhaps a moustache. His lips are thinner than his companion's and his hair is longer, tied in a knot over his left ear. He appears to wear a short necklace rather than a sacred thread. He makes the gesture of anjali mudra at his chest and he stands with his legs slightly apart. The angles of his upper body oppose those of his companion, his head tilting back and his shoulders leaning forward while the larger figure draws away from the lingapiha with his chest and bends his face toward it. Pufijai's standing figures share their square panel with a lingapptha and a tall lamp, although no other ritual implements are present. The panel is framed, although more simply than Tiruviialitr's: the Pufijai panel is a set into the face of the wall, leaving around the panel a sharp ledge unmarked by architectural ornament. Like the Tiruviialuir relief, the Pufijai panel appears to visitors at the be- ginning of the circumambulatory path (pradaksinapatha), thus addressing them as they start the process of worship. Whereas Anantasivan's panel is unusual in its placement on a subshrine, the Pufijai panel's location on the south wall of the ardhamandapa, near a devakostha niche (fig. 37), is shared by most of the portraits in this chapter. The Pufijai portraits precede the first devakostha niche. From this position, they appear to direct worship simultaneously toward the lingaptha within the small relief, the Agastya image in the adjacent devakoF.stha, and the vimdna of the temple itself. As the larger portrait figure twists his body toward the lingapfha, he draws the viewer around him, encouraging pradaksi.a and directing movement toward the vimdna. Though a regular component of the iconographic program of temples built after 970, Agastya is rarely found in devakostha niches before that. Tentative qualities in his presentation at Pufijai imply that this may have been the first such usage: as Barrett has noted, makaras are absent from the lintel of Agastya's niche only and no second niche on the ardhamandapa's north wall provides the symmetry common to most Kavari temples' programs.I5o Whether these features signal a transition toward the Sembiyan Mahadevi program (as Barrett maintains) or the varied options of dispersed, locality patronage (as I would read it), the portrait panel may have been carved near Agastya as a way of encouraging temple visitors to accept him as a new focus for worship. Beneath the portraits, with their postures of devotional surrender, two small panels among the basement moldings (fig. 39) echo the theme of submission to a new lord. The panel just below the right corner of the portrait depicts a man alighting from a chariot to throw himself at Siva's feet.II The aspect of Siva to which he 15o Barrett, Architecture and Sculpture, 8z2. ' Sanford identifies the subject as a princely figure paying obeisance to the ascetic Siva. He numbers the relief as "5.a". Sanford, "A Comparative Study," 97. 87</page><page sequence="30">surrenders himself is an ascetic one, perhaps an allusion to Agastya's asceticism. A panel set one molding layer beneath that one illustrates Vibhisana joining Rima's army,S a decision involving the demon's rejection of his previous allegiances to Ravana and his recognition of Rama's divinity. Early inscriptions at this monument are sparse and seem to post-date the temple's construction considerably. None of the compound's published epigraphs mention the date of the temple's construction or the names of people who supported that expense."53 On the Naltunai Isvara temple itself the earliest date mentioned is A.D. Ioo7, when a dining hall was added to the temple complex.I54 The Candikeivara shrine (located north of the ardhamanadapa) bears an inscription from A.D. 964, the fourth year of Aditya II C61la's reign, announcing a small gift to maintain certain rituals,155 implying that the separate shrine was already established and in worship by 964. The sculptural style of the Candikeivara image (fig. 40) is very close to that of the main temple's devakostha images suggesting that they are contemporary. In the firm lines of the chest and belly, the assertive horizontality of the shoulder, and the slightly puffy knees, the Candikesvara figure closely resembles the main temple's Lifigodbhava (fig. 41) and Brahma images.I56 Style also suggests that the two structures were completed by 964 if not sooner. David Sanford has pointed out that Pufijai and Tiruviialufir are likely to be coeval because they display similar molding combinations and stone type.I57 I have attributed Tiruviialufir to the first half of the tenth century. Although Hoekveld-Meijer's attempts to date the Punijai temple to circa looo are unconvincing and at times contradictory,I58 the information in her general summaries, independently applied to the features of Punijai, supports a construction date no later than the mid-tenth century. The ground plan of the entire temple matches her type I-B-I/2, a type she attributes to 91o to 970 around the Kaveri.59 Hoekveld-Meijer assigns to 965 the temple at Bahfir, which demonstrates the same ardhamandapa and vimdna ground plans as the Naltunai igvara.I60 Barrett remarks that the molding patterns and details of this vimdna suggest to him a date in the first half of the tenth century.I6I He views the Agastya niche as a tentative addition to a simpler plan rather than an attempt to simplify the later six-niched plan. Variants such as this were not unusual in first-phase architecture even before 940, as the Na-g-vara temple at Kumbak6nam demonstrates.

"A Comparative Study," 177. 58 At one point Hoekveld-Meijer finds stylistic support for a date between 990 and loo7 by reading what others see as early features as a later re-synthesis of forms from Aditya I's temples, and by interpreting the large pinched-arch motifs (kuitus) along the roof cornice and the fine detailing of architectural ornament as the work of sculptors who had worked on RMijaraja's temple at Tafijdvur. Hoekveld-Meijer, Koyils, 182-83. For illustrations of ornament on the pilasters, see Encydclopaedia, pl. 195. Agastya, she proposes, was retained at Pufijai because of his local popularity. Hoekveld-Meijer, Koyils, 145-47. The ornamental detail at Tafijavir, however, large and quite coarse by comparison to that of first-phase temples, reads more convincingly as a magnification of earlier forms than a source of inspiration for the delicate work at Pufijai. Furthermore, Hoekveld-Meijer undermines her argument by maintaining at another point in her text that this temple must have been built before Iooo (z64) and elsewhere (182-83) that it must have been built after Iooo or before 99o.

Barrett also alludes to the devakostha images' high quality as a sign of early date, as does Dhaky. 62 While I share their esthetic response to these images, I am uncomfortable with the assumption that masterful sculpting was restricted to the early tenth century. The features that lead Barrett to consider Pufijai a transitional structure and thus as late as circa 940, primarily the presence of Agastya, may be signs of the fluidity in the iconographic programs that I suspect to have permeated artistic production in the first part of the tenth century. The fabric of the temple at Pufijai suggests a construction date around the middle of the tenth century, perhaps as early as the subshrine and main temple at Tiruviialufir, but at any rate before 970. The inscription on the contemporary Candikeivara shrine limits the terminus ante quem to 964. The similarities between the low-relief image at Pufijai and the contemporary portrait at Tiruviialufir, in the handling of figure, format and degree of relief, imply that the Pufijai image is also a portrait. And yet the two differ in enough details to indicate that each image represents the individual identity with which each subject confronted god and local viewers. CAKRAPPALLI On the Cakravade'vara temple in Cakrappalli is a small relief of two women standing before a lingap.tha (fig. 3). The composition of this relief resembles those of the Tiruvi'alfir and Pufijai portrait reliefs, suggesting that the Cakrappalli figures too were intended to represent specific people who once lived, though I have no inscriptional evidence of this.I63 Architecturally as well, the Cakra- vade&amp;vara (figs. 42-43) shares significant features with the temples at Punijai and Tiruviialfir, and is thus likely to have been constructed during the late ninth or early tenth century. The Cakrappalli figures are important to this study because their close resemblance to the Tiruvilalir and Punijai images adds to our study one more example of this figure type. Also, female portraits are very rare throughout the tenth century and these, despite the poorly preserved condition of their faces, reveal a fair amount of detail in the rendering of female costumes and bodies. These details are essential for distinguishing the gender of portraits at other sites. The composition of a central figure (twenty-seven centimeters high) worshipping a lingapptha and attended by a subordinate figure (twenty-one centimeters) of the same sex recalls the Pufijai panel, and the central figure at Cakrappalli also makes the gesture ofanjali mudrd, although her gesture is more restrained. Her hands, parted slightly perhaps to hold an offering of flowers, meet in front of her chest. Her smaller companion lingers behind her, offering a flower garland and one loose flower. 16 The Encyclopaedia, 175-76. Hoekveld-Meijer argues that the beauty of Pufijai's sculpture is offset by the poor quality of the same temple's Sikhara. Hoekveld-Meijer, Koyils, 145-47. The jikhara, however, has clearly been renovated at some later date, so its present quality is not relevant to the date of the temple's original construction. '63 Sanford was the first to notice at this site what he calls a donor figure. Sanford, "A Comparative Study," 178. The temple is published by S. R. Balasubrahmanyam, Middle Chola Temples (Faridabad: Thomson Press [India] Limited, 1975), 4O01-o5, in an addenda to his list of early C61a temples. The inscriptions near the portrait have not, to my knowledge, been published. Several other inscriptions are summarized in the ARE for i965-66 (#308, 309). Later inscriptions dating from the reign of Rajaraja I are published in SII 2, 39; and SII 5, 611; as cited by Balasubrahmanyam, Middle Temples, 403. 89</page><page sequence="32">As at Pufijai, this liigapptha occupies the lower left corner of the relief and the relief is simply framed by the clean edge of the stone surface from which the portrait panel recedes. The larger female figure stands in quiet balance, her weight resting evenly on both feet. Her posture deflects attention from herself toward the deity with that combination of frontal and three- quarter views that characterizes the Tiruvi-alur and Pufijai portraits. She directs her gaze and feet toward the lifgapitha while her torso and thighs remain frontal. Her body addresses the viewer while her attention directs one to continue worship and to appreciate what is presumably the architectural display of her piety. Each woman wears a piece of cloth tied around her hips and draped so that its hem falls almost to her ankles. This cloth forms a repeat pattern of folds across the thighs. A floral clasp, perhaps part of a belt, fastens the upper edge of the cloth just below the belly. The jewelry of these women, more ornate than that of male portraits I have discussed, consists of circlets in the ears, a multi-strand necklace across the collarbone, armlets on the upper arms, several bangles at the wrists, and thick anklets resting across the top of each foot. The arrangement of the hair also distinguishes these female images from male portraits elsewhere. On the Cakrappalli images, long hair is parted at the center and pulled back into a large chignon behind one ear. The chignon is cinched horizontally across the middle with several bands so that it forms two full lobes of hair. The coiffure of the larger female image is further ornamented with a delicate spray of flowers, much like the strings of jasmine women wear in India today. Their upper bodies are apparently clothed only by jewelry. Their shoulders are wide but not as wide as Anantasivan's. Small breasts are clearly indicated, and beneath the narrow waists there is no roll of fat. The women's silhouettes widen at the hips, reaching their fullest breadth across the upper thighs. Their stiff-kneed posture enhances the appearance of breadth in their thighs, as they plant their feet close together and lean slightly forward from the ankle. The hyperextension of this pose distinguishes them from the figure of Durga in the north devakostha of this temple's ardhamandapa (fig. 44). Durga parts her legs slightly, her right leg relaxed as she leans easily into her left hip. These contrasts suggest the devotee's alertly attentive focus on the object of her worship and the deity's calm self-possession. As at Tiruvilaldr, the lihgapztha worshipped by these female figures is draped with a thick garland of flowers and carved with lotus petals along the moldings of the pztha. The Cakrappalli relief also depicts an umbrella flanked by two caurls (flywhisks) floating above the lihgapptha. As these are above the god's emblem, the royal connotations of the umbrella and the cauri refer here, I suspect, to the royalty of the god rather than to the status of the donor. Such emblems are not apparent over the liigapptha in the portrait panels at Konerirajapuram which is inscribed as a portrait of a C61a king (fig. 45).I64 The Cakrappalli panel also shares with its Pufijai counterpart a location on the exterior south wall of the ardhamandapa, although at Cakrappalli the relief follows instead of preceding the ardhaman- .dapa's devakostha. In both cases, the portrait panel occupies the first wall encountered during circumambulation. The figures in the panel face in the direction of circumambulation, and direct their gestures of worship simultaneously toward the lidgap.tha in the relief panel and the lingapZptha housed within the temple's vimdina. '64 Beneath that relief runs Sembiyan Mahadevi's inscription which explains that the figure worshipping at the feet of the deity represents her husband, Gandardditya Co1a: SII 3, 295-96, #146; ARSIE for Io8--op, 49, #45o of 1908. 90</page><page sequence="33">On the south wall of the temple's vimdna an inscription refers to a temple established there and in worship by the year 962.I65 The inscription also mentions that a man named Atittan Suryan alias Cempiyan from the locality of Vettakkuti had donated a subshrine to Su-rya in this temple compound during the reign of Rajaraja I Cola,I66 an act of patronage parallel to Anantaiivan's donation in Tiruviialur. Possibly the Cakravade-vara was constructed through corporate funding, as was the Manavalesvara at Tiruvilakkudi, with various individuals sponsoring the subshrines while at least one of the women in the portrait and perhaps others as well sponsored construction of the central structure. Neither Hoekveld-Meijer nor Barrett discusses this temple directly but their general criteria for determining construction dates of Kav-ri temples would place the Cakravade-vara between 875 and 940. The ground plan of Cakrappalli's vimdna and ardhamandapa (fig. 43) matches Hoekveld-Meijer's type I-A-I, a simple plan involving only one niche in each wall of the vimdna, no "false antardla" joining the ardhamandapa to the vimdna ("type A"), and only one niche in each wall of the ardhamandapa.I67 She considers this an early type of plan and assigns its manifestations in the Kaveri region to the years between A.D. 885 and 9I.I168 The Cakravade-vara's vima-na exhibits the features of Hoekveld-Meijer's type II-4-b, which she assigns to the years between 875 and 930 for temples built in the Kav-ri area.69 The Cakrappalli vimina consists of two talas (type II); a wall complicated by a projecting facet at its center and two less deeply projecting facets at its edges (type 4) and six pilasters (type b). Barrett's results suggest that the features of the ardhamandapa point toward a date before 940, the year his First Phase ends. Within the Kaveri region, ardhamandapas with a single niche (his type I.b) are most common during his First Phase; most of Barrett's single-niched examples from Second and Third Phases are from temples well outside that region.7o The Sivayoganatha temple at Tiruvisalur is also of Barrett's type I.b. The Cakravade-vara's moldings match his type A.2 (fig. 46), and its vimdna his plan D.I, both of which were used in several periods."I The same moldings are present on Anantasivan's subshrine and the Naltunai isvara temple at Pufijai. Common features of this kind could suggest a thread of continuity running through the variegated fabric of Kaveri architectural development, reflecting perhaps the use of consistent sastras and the tastes shared by certain patrons and satisfied by certain workshops early in the tenth century. Two aspects of the Cakrappalli sculptures suggest a date after 950, possibly the products of renovations. First of all, flanking the Lifigodbhava and Durga niches are small relief figures that evoke a narrative involving the adjacent devakostha images. Such "miniature narrative figures," as I have called them, are common at temples built after 970. Beside Durgd, warriors prepare to behead ,65 The inscription is from the year 988, but it describes a flood that damaged temple lands in 962. ARE for 1965-66, #308. See Balasubrahmanyam, Middle Temples, 4o2-o3. 166 This inscription is published in ARE of 1965-66, #308, 70. For a summary and partial translation, see Balasubrahmanyam, Middle Temples, 4o2-o4. 167 See Hoekveld-Meijer, Koyils, 151-53. 168 She also proposes that this plan recurred between 990 and 1Io5, a period during which she believes old forms were revived. Hoekveld-Meijer, Koyils, 155. 169 Hoekveld-Meijer, Koyils, 87-97. Hoekveld-Meijer summarizes her analyses of dating in fig. 28, 97. 170 See Barrett, Architecture and Sculpture I36. Note that the Cakravadmivara varies from Barrett's type I.b slightly, as it omits pilasters at the junction of the vimdna and ardhamandapa. 171 Type A.2 moldings occur in each of his phases of temple development. Vimdnas of type D.I occur in Phases I and III. See Barrett, Architecture and Sculpture, i26-37. 91</page><page sequence="34">themselves, offering her the supreme sacrifice (fig. 47); flanking Lifigodbhava (fig. 48), Visnu and Brahma acknowledge Siva's supremacy after discovering that he is the unfathomable pillar of flame manifest before them. Second are the devakostha figures themselves which display the compact proportions and tight modeling of second-phase sculpture. These figures are carved on separate blocks of stone that could have been inserted into the fabric of the temple wall long after the wall had been built. Note the gaps left between the image slabs and the surrounding walls (figs. 44 and 48). When compared to the fluid modelling of the Pufijai Durga's legs and torso (fig. 49) and the relaxation of its shoulders, the Cakrappalli Durga's pose displays an exaggerated isolation between her planted right hip and thrusting ribcage. The Cakrappalli piece is stylistically closer to the Durga image at Anafigur (fig. 5o), a monument inscribed as the product of Smbiyan Mahaddvi's patronage and firmly dated to the last quarter of the century.7" The two share the sharp crook of the lowered left wrist, the energy with which the shoulders pull back from the chest, and the sudden way the bent leg projects from the plane of the body. In the Pufijai figure of Durga, the bent knee enhances the pliant quality of the lower half of the body. The architectural features of the Cakravade-vara temple indicate perhaps the earliest construction date of any in this essay. Its portrait panel reveals significant similarities to those at Tiruvisalur and especially Pufijai, providing another first-phase example of what seems to be a devout portrait of one or two contemporary donors, and two rare examples of females in this format. TIRUVILAKKUDI (TIRUVLVIKKUDI) Elements that identify the Pufijai and Cakrappalli images as portraits also distinguish an image on the Manavaleivara temple at Tiruvilakkudi (fig. 4) as a representation of a specific person who once lived. This identification rests primarily on the format and placement of the Tiruvilakkudi image which closely resemble the inscribed portrait at Tiruvigalur.73 The Manavaleivara temple (figs. 51-52) appears to have been built around the middle of the tenth century, probably within Phase I of Kav-ri architecture. The sculptural program received major renovations during Phase 2. The portrait seems contemporary with the original architectural fabric. Tiruvilakkudi provides another relief that shares significant features with the Tiruvisalur portrait of Anantasivan, carved on a temple of the first-phase style. Published inscriptions from the Manavaleivara temple reveal that a collective and local system of patronage produced the temple, although I cannot yet discern in them a correlation between the various patrons mentioned and the portrait. Temple construction was funded jointly by at least 172 For the inscription stating Sembiyan Mahadevi's patronage, see ARSIE for I925-26, #75 of 1926, p. 40. Another inscription describing a gift of sheep to the temple mentions the year 979, the tenth year of Uttama C61a's reign. See Barrett, Architecture and Sculpture, 9z; Gary Schwindler, review of Early Cola Architecture and Sculpture by Douglas Barrett, Artibus Asiae 39, no.I (1977), 97; and Balasubrahmanyam, Early Temples, 185. The inscription is summarized in ARSIE I925-26, #78 of 1926, 40. It has also been published in SII 19, #267, 134-35, where the Tamil text appears without translation. 173 An inscription stating that a maydapa was built by Mitavan Tiruvaraflkatevan alias Gafnkaikondas6la-Visaiyappilan of Katalafikuti is apparently on the same wall as the portrait: ARSIE for Ip25-26, #142 of 1926, 48. The inscription mentions no date. This published notice (to my knowledge the only one on this inscription) does not mention whether the inscription is close to the portrait or, indeed, whether the mandapa bearing the inscription is the ardhamagadapa upon which it is now. The portrait is not likely to represent this individual, since its format suggests the early tenth century, and the adoption of Cl61a-affiliation titles ("Gaflkaikondasola-Vigaiyappalan") was unusual before wooo. 92</page><page sequence="35">sixteen residents of Tiruvi!akkudi and other towns who underwrote portions of the structure as modest as a single stone or as large as an entire layer (pa.tai) of the building.r74 The Cola royal family are not among those mentioned as patrons of the building's construction. The closest involvement mentioned is Sembiyan Mahadevi's donation of a silver pitcher some years after the temple was built. 75 The Tiruvi!akkudi portrait occupies the most typical location for portraits of the first phase, on the south wall of the ardhamandapa (fig. 53). Here, the image becomes visible early during the process of circumambulation, welcoming worshippers and introducing them to an individual presumably responsible for some part of the temple's structure. The relief resembling the portrait panel at Tiruvisalor consists of a male figure standing before a lifgapZTha. The figure is thirty-five centimeters high and carved in shallow relief. His hands, which face each other in front of his chest, appear to hold an offering of flowers. Through the same devices employed in the portrait of Anantasivan, the pose of the Tiruvilakkudi figure simultaneously welcomes the viewer and expresses the subject's devout submission to Siva. He bends his head toward the lihgapdpha, and the profile view of his feet suggests he is facing the lihgapptha although his torso and hand gesture are frontal as if to address the viewer. The relief panel sets this image in a simpler environment than that surrounding Anantaiivan. Of the various implements of worship in the Tiruvisalur scene, only the garlanded li gapptha is present at Tiruvilakkudi. Absent also are the umbrella and cauris that floated over the lihgapqtha in the Cakrappalli panel. The Tiruvilakkudi image is dressed quite simply. His only garment is a small loincloth. His jewelry, like Anantasivan's, is limited to armlets, bangles, and perhaps small earrings. His hair, longer than that of the Tiruvisalur and Punijai portraits, is tied into a chignon over his right ear. This chignon is a single, high knot rather than the long, double-lobed coiffure of Cakrappalli's female images. The simple costume and minimal adornment of this image suggest that the subject was, like Ananta'ivan, a man of local importance and no pretensions to royal status. His large chignon resembles that worn in Gandaraditya's portrait on the Umamahe-vara temple at Konerirajapuram, circa 970 (fig. 45), but no other similarities between this panel and the portrait of Gandaraditya C61a at Konerirajapuram substantiate Balasubrahmanyam's identification of the Tiruvilakkudi image as a portrait of that king.'r76 In contrast to royal portraits, the Tiruvi!akkudi image is simply dressed, standing to worship, and without attendants. The Tiruvilakkudi figure demonstrates physical individuation and devotional bearing comparable to the Tiruvisalur portrait. His face is distinctive in its heart-shaped outline and softly rounded cheeks and brow. The gentle curve of the jaw resolves into a soft point at the chin. His eyes are long, his nose wide, his mouth narrow, and his lips short and puffy. Slender and almost concave through the chest and shoulders, this devotee appears wasted by his unrequited longing (viraha) for god's love.

Hoekveld-Meijer classifies the temple as type I-2-a / I-B-I which she finds typical of the mid tenth century." 79Her code indicates that the vimdna originally had a single tala (I), walls with a single projection each (2) and four pilasters (a); the temple as a whole is characterized by a single devakostha niche on each wall of the vimdna (I), an ardhamandapa equal in width to the vimdna (B), and a single niche in each wall of the ardhamandapa (I).8o The five walls of the temple each have at their center a large niche framed by architectural ornament, suited to the large devakostha images found on many first-phase temples. At Tiruvilakkudi these house Daksinamfrti (fig. 54), Lifgodbhava (fig. 55), Brahma and Durga in their usual first-phase locations. The miniature narrative figures around Daksina-murti's niche are also typical of the first phase.][ In other respects, however, the program and style of Tiruvilakkudi's sculpture conform to patterns of Phase 2 of Kaveri art, the results of renovation.182 Presumably in answer to ritual demands for an increased number of image niches along the temple's exterior, two smaller figures were added on either side of the fully-framed devakostha niches in each of the ardhamandapa walls (fig. 52). Siva Candesanugrahami-rti and Bhiksatana appear on the north wall (figs. 56-57), Ganesa and Agastya on the south (figs. 58 -59). These figures are smaller than the central, older niches; all of them except Bhiks-tana occupy small, unframed niches. Whereas Ganesa would dominate this wall in a first- phase program, he has here been shunted into a subsidiary position in favor of Nataraja. During that transition, an original image large enough to fill the niche must have been removed (if one had yet been installed), and the present rather small figure inserted into the flanking niche. A total of six images is common on second-phase ardhamandapas, but the Manavalaivara also bears two figures in unframed niches on the western wall of the vimdna, unusual for first- and second-phase programs alike. Harihara and Ardhanari (figs. 6o-61) occupy these niches, in which they are rendered frontally and at barely two-thirds the size of the Lifigodbhava in the framed niche between them. Thus the composition of a full devakostha niche flanked by a pair of smaller figures is repeated on the first, third and fifth walls encountered during circumambulation (fig. 52). Similarly, Cande'anu- 177 ARSIE for 1925-26, #126-27, 129 and 131 of 1926, which discuss past funding of the temple's construction, were written during the reign ofUttama Ca1a (971-88). 178 ARSIE for I925-26, #134 ofi926, 47.

See Barrett, Architecture and Sculpture, 99. 182 Although I differ from Schwindler in dating the original fabric to the first phase and the renovations to the second phase; he attributes the original construction to after 970 and the renovations to the eleventh century. Schwindler, "Review," 98. Lippe and Schwindler view the four ardhamandapa niches as later renovations to the temple. Aschwin Lippe, review of Early Cola Architecture and Sculpture by Douglas Barrett, Burlington Magazine II8 (1976), 237. Barrett considers the entire structure a product of ?embiyan Mahadevi's phase of Early C61a architecture, basing his assessment in large part on the late style of the sculpture. He also views the molding as late because it is the same pattern used at Tafijaviir. Barrett, Architecture and Sculpture, 99-1oo.

The upper edge of Ganefa's niche, for example (fig. 58) is uneven and the unframed niches of the west wall are of markedly different heights (fig. 62). Bhiks-tana's image, not enclosed in any niche, projects directly from the wall, breaking unevenly through the projecting molding (vari) encircling the temple just above the basement moldings. The image's irregular stone mount interrupts the matrix of the wall. As part of the same renovation project, a small irregular block bearing miniature narrative images of two brahmin wives was inserted beside the image of Bhiksatana (fig. 57). Overcome by the charms of the young god, the woman closest to Bhiksatana begins to untie her garment with her left hand. The second woman proffers a flower garland, a gesture of adoration and also of union. At the feet of these women, a water pot lies forgotten, a symbol of wifely roles set aside in the god's intoxicating presence. Although infrequent on first-phase temples, such narrative embellishments become during Phase z a standard component of the increasingly complex sculptural emphasis on the devakostha niche. They are significantly smaller than the six niched figures added to the Manava!levara, they are carved in shallower relief, and they exist adjacent to the pilasters framing devakostha niches rather than in niches of their own.s Posture and gesture identify most such miniature narrative figures as wor- shippers rather than objects of worship. Another aspect of the renovation project was the insertion of new images into the five older, framed devakostha niches which had been designed for the larger images typical of first-phase temples. Lifigodbhava and Daksinamurti are clearly too short for their tall niches, and their stone backdrops look patched and poorly fitted into the niche frames (figs. 54- 55). The Durga and Brahma have been replaced yet again well after the early Cola period.I86 The image of Nataraja in the devakostha of the ardhamanadapa's south wall (fig. 63) is particularly out of place, iconographically as well as stylistically, on a first-phase temple. As Barrett has noted, Nataraja appears very seldom and only as a minor relief image on temples built before 970. The first dated example of Nataraja in a full devakostha niche occurs at Konerirajapuram on the Umamahesvara 183 On the Lifigodbhava manifestation of Siva, see T. A.

On the Harihara image type as a statement of Siva's supremacy over Visnu, see passages from the Knrma Purda, Skanda Purdia, and Sthdlapura~ia of the 9anikaranarayanakivil as cited by Marguerite Adiceam, "Les Images de Siva dans l'Inde du Sud: V. Harihara," Arts Asiatiques, 13 (1966), 84. On Ardhanari as a statement of Siva's subordination of the Goddess, see Joanna Williams, "An Ardhan-risvara Linga," Kusumanjali: New Interpretations of Indian Art and Culture, ed. M. S. Nagaraja Rao (Delhi: Agam Kala Prakashan, 1987), vol. 2, 299-306; and Marguerite Adiceam, "Les Images de Siva dans l'Inde du Sud: VI. Ardhanarisvara," Arts Asiatiques 17 (1968), I43-64. 184 Hoekveld-Meijer chooses to understand the simplicity of the six unframed niches as experimentation with new forms, and thus as evidence that even the renovations took place before 970 when the canon for that form became fixed: Koyils, I25. She is presumably comparing them to similarly unframed subsidiary niches at sites like Kumbak6nam and Sriniv-sanallfir. ,85 Hoekveld-Meijer misses this distinction when she groups this "complete set" of "attendant figures" with miniature narrative types such as representations of Brahmd and Visnu that often flank Lifigodbhava: Koyils, 273-74. 186 Barrett, Architecture and Sculpture, 99. 95</page><page sequence="38">temple, built by Sembiyan Mahadevi.87 I suspect that the Nataraja image only received this elevated status when the C61a queen Sembiyan Mahadevi, whose patronage of temple construction began circa 970, decided to deploy it as an emblem of the C61a family's affiliation with the ancient cult of Cidambaram.0 If I am correct in this hypothesis, Nataraja's prominence at Tiruvilakkudi would be further evidence that this temple's sculptural renovation took place during Phase 2. Nataraja stands in the niche from which a larger Ganesa image probably first dominated the ardhamandapa's south wall. The Nataraja is carved in a reddish stone distinct from the gray stone of the walls.19 Further- more, the style of the Tiruvilakkudi Nataraja identifies it with the representation of the same deity at Anafigur (fig. 64), on temples verifiably of the second phase. The Tiruvilakkudi figure's proportions are short and compact, its movements angular and its surfaces taut. The knees are rendered as isolated rings of flesh that do not merge organically with the thigh and calf. Perhaps the Manavilevara temple was renovated early enough in the second phase that the pattern catalyzed by Sembiyan Mahadevi's temples had not yet taken firm hold over monuments patronized by non-royal donors. The distinctly second-phase style of Tiruvilakkudi's devakosthas (excepting the later Durga and Brahma) indicate that they were added to the temple after 970. The localized and non-royal patronage revealed by this temple's inscriptions may have perpetuated the experimental freedom in iconographic programming that is manifest among locally patronized temples of the first phase. The marked consistency among the images here of Gane'a, Nataraja, Agastya, Daksinamurti, Ardhanari, Linigodbhava, Harihara, Candesanugrahamu-rti and Bhiksatana suggests that all were part of the same renovation project. These bodies are short, compact, and solidly anchored to their bases. Surfaces are firm and streamlined. The portrait relief appears to be contemporary with the original construction of the temple, rather than with the renovation program. The portrait participates in the original five-niched program at the expense of the later eleven-niched program. This worshipper faces the framed devakostha niche of that wall, which presumably once housed Gane'a, and turns his back on Agastya whose niche is actually closer to him. The clean, straight lines framing the portrait panel indicate the cutting of freshly quarried stone, in contrast to the roughness attending reworkings of stone that has been out of the earth for some time. Such roughness is evident along the upper edge of the adjacent Agastya niche (fig. 59). And whereas the irregularity of the trapezoidal stone bearing the relief of brahmin wives indicates a later insertion, the portrait is carved from a regular rectangular block that appears to have been set into the wall during the temple's original construction (figs. 4 and 57). Note also that the portrait is recessed into the surface of the stone, as are the first-phase portraits at Pufijai and Cakrappa!li. The brahmin wives are unframed figures projecting from the stone surface. On the basis of significant features it shares with the Tiruviialur portrait of Anantaiivan, this Tiruvilakkudi image may be considered a portrait. Both portraits appear to have been carved during the first phase of Kaveri art, probably within fifty years of each other. With its neat frame and its orientation toward the central niche of this wall, the Tiruvilakkudi image was part of the first stage of that temple's construction. That first stage occurred well before 970, probably by 959, and possibly even earlier. 187 Douglas Barrett, "The Dancing Siva in Early South Indian Art," The Sixth Annual Mortimer Wheeler Archaeological Lecture, Proceedings of the British Academy 62 (1976), I81-203.

Inscriptions near six of this temple's eight portraits name their subjects, apparently local citizens; two of these six contributed to the construction of the building itself. Every portrait on the temple is characterized by its physical features as distinctly individual. Since we can compare these portraits to each other, we do not depend here on comparisons to devakosthas to demonstrate individuation in these portraits. The date of these images (figs. 5-9) and of the temple they ornament (figs. 65- 66) can be fixed with some likelihood to the years around A.D. 932. I have numbered the eight portraits I find on the ardhamandapa and vimana of the Gomukt-ivara according to the sequence in which one encounters them during circumambulation. The format of the Tiruva.duturai portrait reliefs continues to distinguish them from devakostha figures, and resembl- ing the Tiruvisalu-r portrait type in their small size, shallow relief, rectangular frame, and in their facing a relief representation of a lingapptha, making the gesture of adjali mudrd. Their stances reflect devotion to Siva and welcome to temple visitors. Three reliefs at Tiruva.duturai follow the Tiruvisal ur format exactly (figs. 8-9), adding several dated examples to our list of portraits of that type. The other five Tiruv.duturai portraits (figs. 5-7) present a slight variation on the Tiruviial-tr format which I term the Tiruva.duturai type, in which a separate rectangular frame isolates each image from other portraits and from the lingapptha. Thus isolated, each portrait occupies a cellular, enclosed space rather than the continuous and slightly illusionistic space occupied by portraits and lingappthas of the Tiruvisalu-r type. This innovation seems part of an evolution toward the format of second-phase portraits in which figures are extracted even further from any suggestion of a separate interior and projected more prominently into the spatial world of the viewer. Portraits I and 2 (fig. 5) are carved into a single block on the south wall of the vimana, immediately to the right (east) of Daksinamurti's devakostha niche and at a height approximately even with the center of the devakostha figure (fig. 67). Portrait i, the figure furthest to the right, is twenty-eight centimeters high. An inscription just outside the right edge of the relief identifies this figure as Ilaiya Tiruna-vukkaraiyar, a devotee of the Lord of the Stone Temple [Karralip-Piranar].99' His stance displays that combination of profile and frontal views that has characterized other portraits of the first phase, his feet in profile as he attends to the lingapptha while his torso and face twist to address the viewer. Dressed simply in a minimal loincloth and a necklace (perhaps of rudrdksa beads), he resembles the portraits at Pun-jai and Tiruvilakkudi. His hair, like theirs, appears to be cropped close to the scalp. His face is dominated by broad, shallow planes and a long, thin nose. His physique is slender. His ribs project like those of a quickly-growing young man, as his name (I~laiya, "the younger") indicates. Caught up in fervent prayer, Ilaiya Tirunivukkaraiyar closes his eyes, arches his back and raises his hands above his head. His willowy form sways forward while the bodies of the other Tiruv.duturai portraits remain more firmly planted. Included in the narrow frame surrounding him is a padlock-shaped bag resting on a short stand. Sastri reads this as a bag of ashes.I" The linga- '90 Aravamuthan, Portrait Sculpture, 31; Sastri, Colas, 725-26, 745 n.

Carved into a separate compartment on the same block, Portrait 2 stands between Ilaiya Tirunavukkaraiyar and the lifgapitha they both worship. An inscription near this second image names the subject as Karrali Piccar.11 Other inscriptions on the Gomukti-vara describe the same man as a resident of Tiruv dutuai who gave two parcels of land and a number of small gifts to this temple. One inscription refers to Karrali Piccar as the man who had the temple built in A.D. 932.194 This portrait has some of the simplicity of Portrait I. Both figures wear the minimal loincloth and adopt a stance that simultaneously addresses the lihgapifha and the viewer. Their hair is cropped short. Over his arm, Karrali Piccar carries a bag similar to the bag beside Ilaiya Tirunavukkaraiyar. Differences between the two portraits appear in their postures and faces. Karrali Piccar's posture characterizes him as a calmer and perhaps older man than Ilaiya Tirunavukkaraiyar. He inclines his head gently toward the li ga instead of throwing his head back, and he clasps his hands in front of his chest. His hips sway only slightly toward the lihgapptha. His shoulders are broader than those of his companion and his portrait is taller (thirty centimeters). He has empty and particularly long ear- lobes. Karrali Piccar is also distinguished by his broad nose, full lips, and a sharp brow line at the base of his prominent forehead. Just beneath the portrait panel is a seated, grinning bhuta, one of the chubby dwarves who often appear in attendance on Siva. This bhdta wields one of Siva's attributes, an axe, in one of his four arms. The bhita's proximity to the portraits seems to emphasize their similarities as devotees of Siva. The location of Portraits I and 2 permits them to direct worship toward Daksinamu-rti and the bas- relief li gapitha simultaneously. At Tiruvisalu-r too, the portrait and a bhita figure shared a wall from which both regard the entrance to the subshrine. Their location on the south wall of the Gomuktilvara also permits these portraits to participate early in the worshipper's experience of the temple, as do the portraits at Pufijai, Cakrappalli and Tiruvilakkudi. At Tiruva-duturai, however, the portraits adorn the vimana rather than the ardhamandapa, perhaps a reflection of these devotees' affiliation with Daksinamu-rti rather than Ganesa or Agastya.I95 Another block of portraits (fig. 6) mirrors the first block on the opposite side of the Daksinamurti niche. Beneath this panel is another seated bh#ta, holding Siva's trident. Framed by two bh tas, two large panels carved with four portraits and two ligappthas, this devakostha niche receives considerable visual emphasis. The second panel, like the first, covers a single, wide block of stone, and one discerns a common style among the four portraits. All share a tubular quality in the modelling of the limbs and a pronounced crispness of carving. On this block the lingapitha is carved between the two portraits. The base of this liagappha is ornamented with an incised pattern of lotus petals (similar to the li gapifha at Cakrappalli), and it is 193 ARSIE for IP24-25, 27, 132 of 1925. Perhaps this was the same man identified in an inscription elsewhere as a general of Sundara C61a: EI 12 (1913-14), 122, 15. 194 ARSIE for IP24-25, 26, 126 of 1925. His gifts of land are mentioned in ARSIE for IP24-25, 26-28, #122, #125-26 and #139 of 1925. Inscriptions #14o and #142 register his gifts of cash. Inscription 139 also identifies Tiruva.duturai as his residence. 195 Sanford implies that patrons of this area, which contained many matas, may have felt a particular attachment to Siva, and wished their images to be close to his. See Sanford, "A Comparative Study," 179. On ma.tas and their proliferation during the C61a period, see Sastri, Colas, 628-34, 649-52; and Leslie C.

Otherwise the two linga representations are quite similar, with two fly-whisks and an umbrella hovering above each. The garlands over them follow the same graceful curves. Portrait 3 or Portrait 4 may represent the "Ampalavan Tiruviialu-r alias Tirun'avukkaraiyan, a de- votee of the Lord of Tiruvava.duturai" named in a nearby inscription.i96 The name he shares with Ilaiya Tirunavukkaraiyar suggests that this may have been an elder relative.I97 In the spread of his belly which exceeds that of his shoulders, Portrait 3 (on the right end of the composition) suggests a man of mature years, distinctive appearance, or the physical perfection of the prosperous. The shortness of his legs enhances his full proportions. From head to toe, this portrait is only twenty-six centimeters high, shorter than Portraits I and 2. His pose is calm, like Karrali Piccar's, with his head inclined toward the lingapptha and his hands clasped in front of his chest. He may wear a slight smile. His forehead is quite high and broad, and his cheeks are puffier than those of Portraits I and 2. Portrait 4 also wears a loincloth and makes the gesture of adjali mudra at his chest. He is full through the torso, though not as short in the leg or as plump as Portrait 3. Portrait 4 stands thirty centimeters high, and his long hair is tied into a chignon behind his right ear. Like Portrait 3 this image has full cheeks, but a longer head and more prominent nose and lips. The fifth portrait on the south side of the Gomuktisvara beyond the next pilaster is carved more shallowly and informally and can be difficult to see (fig. 7).198 The sketchy carving has left only an uneven ridge around the image, rather than a complete frame. The relief appears at the same eleva- tion as the other four portraits on this wall. In general terms, it resembles the portrait of Ilaiya Tirunavukkaraiyar. The figure (thirty-six centimeters high) is slender and he worships with his hands raised above his head. His hair appears to be cut very short. The short beaded necklace appears on his chest. He carries a bag of ashes over his right shoulder and faces yet another garlanded lingapitha. Portrait 5 seems to be uninscribed, and the condition of the carving prevents close study of its physiognomy. The west and north walls of the Gomuktisvara vima-na bear no portraits. Portraits 6 and 7 (fig. 8) adorn the north wall of the ardhamandapa where they are carved into the upper section of a pilaster, just to the left of the Durga devakos.tha. The portraits are quite high off the ground, and more remote from the viewer than the other images of this phase. This rectangular relief (twenty-four centimeters high) depicts a man worshipping a lingapptha, and a woman standing behind him. An inscription beside the relief identifies the man as "Eluvan Santiratittan of Varampu-sal, who constructed a tier (pa.tai) of the temple" and the female as "Nakkan Vannattatikal, a maid servant of the palace.''I99 This relief is of the Tiruvisalu-r type. The two figures and the lingapptha occupy a single, continuous space. The lingapp~ha occupying the right half of this relief is covered with a flower garland. The panel is framed simply by a narrow ledge of stone that is continuous with the shaft of the pilaster. Like the portrait panels at Pulijai and Cakrappalli, this one depicts two people wor- shipping a lingapptha. The poses of Portraits 6 and 7 are simpler than those of other Tiruvilalfir-type portraits. Instead of twisting to address the viewer and the lingapi.tha simultaneously, Eluvan 196 ARSIE for 1924-25, 133 of 1925, 27- 197 This connection is suggested by Aravamuthan, Portrait Sculpture, 32. 198 When I first visited this temple in 1984, this portrait had received no lustrations and was as pale as the surrounding wall. By my second visit (in 199o), the image had been darkened considerably. 199 ARSIE for Ip24-25, io6 of 1925, 24. 127</page><page sequence="70">Santirdtittan stands in complete profile while Nakkan Vanna-ttatikal's body appears in a consistent three-quarter view. The portrait of Eluvan Santirdtittan depicts him touching his forehead with the heel of his hands as he makes the gesture of anjali mudrd. His hair is tied in a knot at the back of his head. His clothing consists simply of a loincloth. Though the rough condition of the image and its placement high on the temple wall discourage a careful reading of his facial features, his ample middle and thighs are legible. Nakkan Vannattatikal's portrait carries less detailed information about a distinctive appearance. Like the figures at Cakrappalli, she wears her hair tied into a large chignon that rises above her head, and a long garment that covers her legs. She holds a horizontal object in front of her waist, perhaps a cushion supporting her gift. Gifts of jewelry were often given by women of the Cola household.'o Portrait 8 (fig. 9) appears on the front or east wall of the ardhaman.dapa, just to the right of the temple entrance, a spot of considerable importance since from here the portrait addresses the worshipper who is just about to enter the temple. Located between the door and the right-hand dvarapala (fig. 68), and carved at approximately the viewer's waist level, this portrait panel is quite prominent. An inscription to the right of the panel identifies the unaccompanied male figure, who is shown worshipping a li gapptha, as "Tatman Amalan alias Namasivayan of Sirrtti in Tirunaraiyu-r- natu.''1 This panel follows the Tiruvilalu-r format, including the pose in which the feet are in profile while the torso is almost frontal. Tatman Amalan stands on the right side of the li gapptha, his hands joined in front of his chest. Between his hands he seems to hold a small offering, perhaps a flower, as did the main figure at Cakrappalli. Tatman Amalan wears the simple loincloth and short, beaded necklace worn by Portraits I and 5. His image is slightly larger (thirty-two centimeters high) than the other portraits at the Gomuktisvara, and his coiffure is unusual. Neither very short nor tied in a chignon, his hair appears to be piled directly on top of his head. He wears a thick ring through each earlobe, whereas the figures on the south wall have long but empty earlobes. His eyes protrude somewhat, as do the full lips of his narrow mouth. His short forehead and wide cheekbones combine with the sudden slant of his jaw to lend the face a heart shape. The point of his chin protrudes emphatically. His body is long in the torso and short in the leg, narrow in the shoulders and fleshy in the belly and hips. His arms are quite short. The lihgapptha Taman Amalan worships is a fine and delicate version of those on the south wall of this temple. Under the floating arch of an umbrella and two fly-whisks, the linga is rendered on a base of several clearly cut moldings. A neatly delineated spout projects from the top level of the platform. The garland draped over the li ga is carved in quite subtle relief as if capturing the textural contrast between soft flowers and the heavy linearity of the stone emblem itself. This panel is framed by the uncut expanse of the stone block it adorns. There has been considerable debate as to who built this temple and when, debate generated by an unusually rich record directly concerning construction patronage. Different inscriptions name at least three different men as patrons of all or parts of the temple's construction. Two of these inscriptions are dated. One describing a gift made by Karlrali Piccar in 932 notes that this man built 20zoo On the donations of jewelry made by C6la queens and princesses, see B. Venkataraman, Temple Art under the Chola Queens (Faridabad: Thomson Press [India] Limited, 1976), 51, Io1, 122. zo2 ARSIE for IP24-25, 141 of 1925, 28. 128</page><page sequence="71">the temple." The inscription identifying Eluvan Santirdtittan, Portrait 6, credits him with having funded the construction of one layer (pa.tai) of the temple. A third inscription names the C61la king Para-ntaka I as the donor of 50o kalanju of gold "for constructing the temple of stone from the kuitappatai upwards.'"'? This inscription was carved in the year 945, the thirty-eighth year of that king's reign. Although Barrett takes the third inscription to refer to the construction of most of the temple that now stands, I share with Balasubrahmanyam, though for different reasons, a preference for the 932 inscription as a terminus ante quem for the first story of the building, its devakos.tha images and the portraits described above. Barrett suggests that Karrali Piccar's temple was a brick structure that superceded the present stone structure.04 Barrett bases his attribution to the king in large part on the very high quality of the Gomuktisvara's sculpture and architectural ornament, which he equates with royal patronage. Given, however, that very few projects before 970 are demonstrably the result of C6la royal patronage, ?5 this line of reasoning seems external to the circumstances of the G-mu- ktigvara's production. Another difficulty with Barrett's ascription of a brick temple to Karrali Piccar, and one that Barrett himself acknowledges, is that it requires that the brick temple be destroyed within at most thirteen years of its construction, in order to be replaced by the current stone structure. Indeed, a stone structure completed in 945 would have to have been begun almost as soon as the hypothesized brick structure was completed. Furthermore, the decision to build a brick temple may have been anachronistic by 932 when so much energy in the Kaveri area was being directed toward rebuilding ancient brick temples in stone. Also implying Karrali Piccar's responsibility for the standing walls is his portrait on those walls. None of the portraits here seems to represent a king. The only portrait on the same wall as Parantaka's inscription - the east wall - is labeled as the representation of someone else. One wonders why Para-ntaka would construct the first tier of this temple without including in it a portrait of him- self, since these walls do bear portraits of previous patrons. The Gomuktigvara bears many inscriptions describing Karrali Piccar's frequent donations to the temple, whereas Parantaka's patronage is mentioned only that once.2o6 Karrali Piccar is named as the person who had the temple built. His architectural contribution must have been substantial and must have included the portion of the temple that, according to the standards of the time, made the temple viable and complete. Presumably this included the tier that housed the main shrine, the first storey of the temple, which is also the tier bearing his portrait. The inscription concerning the C61la king's patronage, on the other hand, limits his involvement to a section of the temple above the kitappa.tai. The meaning of this term is elusive because this seems to be its only occurrence in the body of extant Tamil writing. Balasubrahmanyam took it to mean "the layer or moulding of the superstructure of the vimana below the stupi (stupika) or stupik- kudam."'z7 To him, then, the ki.tappa.tai meant the layer (pa.tai) below the crowning pinnacles 202 ARSIE for Ip24-25, 126 Of 1925, 26. This inscription refers to Parantaka I by citing the date as "the twenty-fifth year of the king who took Madurai." zo3 ARSIE for ip24-25, 143 of1925, 28. 2c4 Barrett, Architecture and Sculpture, 81. zo5 See Kaimal, "Early C61a Kings and 'Early Cola Temples'". 2o6 Karrali Piccar's other donations are discussed above. Pardntaka's gift is registered in ARSIE for IP24-25, 28, 143- z27 Balasubrahmanyam, Early Temples, 261. Karl Khandalavala agrees with him: "Early Chola Sculpture (A Review of Douglas Barrett, Early Cola Architecture and Sculpture)," Lalit Kald 19, 49. 129</page><page sequence="72">(stupikas) of the roof. Barrett interpreted the term to mean kumudappatai, "the tier (pa.tai) containing the three-faceted basement molding (kumuda),''208 meaning that Karrali Piccar built only the foundation and Parantaka built the ornate walls above. Later, Barrett revised this thesis, acknow- ledging a unity in conception between the moldings and the wall rising from them, and concluding that Karrali Piccar's project consisted of a separate brick structure that was replaced by the present stone temple.209 I propose yet another reading of the term, a reading that does not require as much deviation from the inscribed term as Balasubrahmanyam's and Barrett's do. By changing one vowel, ki.tappa.tai could read as kutuppattai, or "the tier containing the ki.tus." Ku.tu is a Tamil term for the small pinched and crested arches adorning the projecting cornices (kapota) that run above the main walls of many Kaveri temples.'o At Tiruv-aduturai, the kap~ta ornamented with kutus run above the niched wall surface of the first storey. The ceiling of a later structure built around the Gomuktisvara interrupts the original wall at precisely this point (fig. 69). This interpretation of the term would assign to Pardntaka the funding of the ardhamandapa roof and the vimana superstructure, none of which is visible any longer from ground level. Karrali Piccar and to a lesser extent Eluvan Santirdtittan would have funded construction of the walls up to that cornice at least thirteen years earlier, the walls that are now visible, the walls bearing their portraits. I take the depiction of Siva Natardja in the roundel just above the Daksindmu-rti niche of the vimana (fig. 70) as an emblem of Parantaka and his involvement in this temple's completion, even though the relief is roughly half a meter below what I take to be the ku-tappattai. I have suggested elsewhere that Parantaka catalyzed the C61a family's affiliation with the sacred center of Cidam- baram, an affiliation that prompted Sembiyan Mahadevl to publicize Natardja through the icono- graphic program of her new temples and that later Cola kings would make a centerpiece of their kingship.2 It is the only one of the four early reliefs of Natardja to depict him underneath an umbrella, commonly a royal sign in Indic art.' The Tiruvaduturai Nataraja projects further from the wall surface than its counterparts at other early temples, and further than the reliefs crowning the other devakos.tha niches at the Gomuktilvara (figs. 71-74). This relief looks to be of a darker stone than the rest of the wall. Parantaka could have had this Nataraja relief added to the finished walls of this temple when he had the superstructure built. The architectural features of the Gomuktlivara's vimdina and ardhamangdapa walls, though in some respects unusual, support a date of A.D. 932. Hoekveld-Meijer identifies the ground plan as type 208 Douglas Barrett, Early Cola Bronzes (Bombay: Bhulabai Memorial Institute, 1965), 7. z2) Barrett, Architecture and Sculpturg 81. K. G. Krishnan and M. A. Dhaky also locate the kuitappatai somewhere among the horizontal moldings at the base of the temple wall. Krishnan's interpretation is similar to Barrett's. See K. G. Krishnan, "A Review of Epigraphical Sources for the Art History of Tamil Nadu (85o-95o A.D.)," in Indian Epigraphy: Its Bearing on the History of Art, Frederick Asher and G. S. Gai, eds. (New Delhi: Oxford and American Institute of Indian Studies, 1985), 221-23. Dhaky reads kuta as a Tamil version of the Sanskrit term khura (sometimes called the jagati), the unrelieved perpendicular element at the very base of some molding combinations. On Dhaky, see K. G. Krishnan, "A Review of Epigraphical Sources," 223, n. i2. Earlier, Krishnan appears to adhere to the same interpretation: "Architectural Terms in South Indian Temple Inscriptions" in Studies in Indian Temple Architecture, Pramod Chandra, ed. (New Delhi: American Institute of Indian Studies, 1975), 3o8-o9. 2'o The Encyclopaedia defines kutu (omitting the macron) as andsikdor "horse-shoe or Chaitya-arch motif" (pp. 289, 291). Hoekveld- Meijer assigns the term the same meaning although she spells it kudu. Hoekveld-Meijer, Koyils, 4o0. The word has become standard to the vocabulary of this field but neither of the above sources cites inscriptional evidence of the term's usage in ancient times. The word kutu is defined by the Tamil Lexicon as "nest, dome, cupola." za In Kaimal, "Siva Nataraja: Shifting Meanings of an Icon". 212 The other sites at which Nataraja appears as a low-relief, small-scale image before circa 97o are Tiruccenampundi, Pufijai and Tiruverumbu-r. 130</page><page sequence="73">I-2-a, meaning a temple one storey high (I), its vimaina walls each composed of a planar wall broken only by a central projection (2), and marked by four pilasters (a).3 The simplicity of this type suggests to her a date during the reign of Pardntaka I (907-54), and in her view the archaic shape of the pan-jara elements (her "type I.a") restricts the construction date to well before the 940s. 4 Images standard to Phase I occupy the devakos.tha niches of the G6mukt-ivara ardhamandapa: Ganela (fig. 70) and Durga appear on the south and north walls respectively. These images are large and softly modeled. In their substantial height and in what Barrett calls their "ampler, laxer forms I see affinities to the early sculptural work at Kumbak6nam and Sriniv-sanallir.25 I see the configuration and treatment of other niches on the ardhamangaapa as another variant among the options used during Phase I of Kaveri architecture. On the left side of Ganesa, who occupies a niche in the center of the south wall, is a second full niche containing Agastya (fig. 72). In this respect the program resembles Punijai's, although the asymmetry that characterizes that site is minimized at Tiruva.duturai by the addition of a framed but blind niche (fig. 73) on Ganesa's left to balance the Agastya niche on his right. Two more framed and blind niches have been added to the north wall, one on either side of Durgd (fig. 74).M6 Because these three niches are present but empty, Barrett considers the G6muktisvara the next stage after Punijai's Naltunai l vara in an architectural transition between the two-niche program of the preceding phase and the six-niche program that was to follow.7 At Tiruva.duturai all six niches are fully framed and of full width, but the empty three are too shallow to have ever held sculptures. Hoekveld-Meijer points out that the blind niches do not break through the vari as do the full devakos.tha niches of this and other temples of this period.28 Is this a lack of conviction, as it were, about the iconographic need for six niches, maybe a polite adherence to the formality of the fully treated niche? This interpretation might be more convincing if Tiruva.duturai (and Pufijai) were the earliest Kaverl temples to display more than two devakos.tha niches, but ardhamandapas with four or six niches are present at Tiruppalana and Kumbakonam of the early tenth century. And since the blind niches at Tiruviiduturai do not provide a genuine oppor- tunity for the iconographic program to expand, they are just as conceptually distant from second- phase patterns as are the unframed and unconventionally peopled niches at Tiruppalana and KumbakEnam. Each design implies to me a freedom to experiment with standard forms, a freedom characteristic of first-phase temples. When architects of second-phase temples were later faced with changing devotional requirements, they may have been inspired by the solutions all four of these 113 See Hoekveld-Meijer, Koyils, 87, fig. 23. 214 Hoekveld-Meijer, Koyils, 123-26. Her typology ofpa jaras is illustrated in fig. 32, 115. While I accept the developmental sequence in figure 32, I am hesitant about Hoekveld-Meijer's thesis that "temples without pafijaras but located in the pafijara region [i.e., the area closely lining the banks of the Kavri and Kollidam] were designed either before or after the pafijara phase" (p. 117 and map 6a). She defines that phase as A.D. 886 to Ioo6 (appendix 8). I remain unconvinced that panjaras, or many decorative other features, were mandatory during this period throughout this region. 215 Barrett, Architecture and Sculpture, 8o. Curiously, Barrett himself views these features as "foreshadowing the style of [his] Third Phase," although this seems to contradict his other characterizations of that later style. z16 Although the Encyclopaedia describes an image of Bhiksatana on the north wall, no such image was present when I visited the site in 1985 and 199o. See the Encyclopaedia, 174. 217 Barrett, Architecture and Sculpture, 81. Barrett also viewed the indentation between vimana andardhamandapa, the "false antardla," as a later feature whose appearance on the Gomuktigvara foreshadowed the architecture of Sembiyan Mahlddvi. 28 Hoekveld-Meijer, Koyils, IZ6. She also, however, defines the blind niches as a devolved form of the pafjara rather than a precursor of the full niches that will occupy that location in later temples, a notion that does not convince me. 131</page><page sequence="74">temples offered, but such inspiration could have occurred at a distance of some decades. Tiruva- duturai's ardhamandapa need not have been conceived on the eve of the second phase. I have no hesitation, then, in placing the portrait reliefs at Tiruvaduturai within the first phase of Kavfri art. They adorn a wall built at least by 945, and more likely by 932. Three of the portraits are presented in the format exemplified by the Tiruvisalur portrait. The other five portraits at Tiru- vdduturai demonstrate a separate type that isolates the figure from the coherent and remote pictorial space occupied by portraits of the TiruvisalCur type. The portraits demonstrate idiosyncratic facial features and a variety of physiques and proportions, despite the general stylistic similarities that unite the images of the south wall. Through the language of the body, each image communicates a sense of the subject's piety and individual existence. Inscriptions adjacent to the portraits identify the subjects more often by their locality than through an affiliation to the C61a royal family. CONCLUSIONS The format of Kaveri-area portraits has much in common with hero stones from the Tamil region. Again we find very shallow carving, a composite perspective that resolves profile, frontal and three- quarter views into a single figure, and an interplay between sculptural and inscribed descriptions of the subject. These formal similarities suggest that the sometimes deep contrasts between hero stones and temple portraits (in subtlety of carving, subject matter, and simple as opposed to continuous narrative formats) may indicate a continuity in the practice of portraiture between the settled, agricultural plains where temples were built and the remote hill areas, often of different modes of social organization, in which hero stones have been found. Perhaps the shared visual vocabulary reflects a shared perception of worthy deeds. Spiritual devotion and defense of the village could both be framed as invitations to abandon safety (spiritual or physical) in a pledge of loyalty to another. Both such virtuous actions were then to be rewarded by greater access to the divine, and by a com- memoration of those actions in portraiture. Kaveri-area temple portraits and the bhakti form of worship they participated in may be understood as a regional variant on this form, with hero stones as a hill version, and the Vaikuntha Perumil as an urban adaptation. From one ecotype to another, one form of worship obviated others because the impulses behind such worship were essentially so similar.29 Of the three themes evident in early Indic portrait sculpture, donation as submission is a central dynamic of these portraits from the Kaveri region. Mattison Mines' research indicates that in Tamil culture generosity has long been an important mode through which people could articulate their individuality.= Mines also notes that persisting in Tamil culture was the perception that group identity and individual identity were complementary, making the Tamil region a likely place in which to find the attitudes to portraiture reflected in the early Sanskrit texts I discuss above. 2'9 K. V. Soundara Rajan perceives the worship of hero stones as the hill alternative to the low-land Tamil brahminism: "Origin and Spread of Memorial Stones in Tamil-Nadu," Memorial Stones, 69-70. M. S. Mate notes that some hero stones are made to resemble temples, with sculpture on four sides and with a/kirttimukha (leonine face) motif over niches: "Hero Stones: the 'Folk' and the 'Classic'," Memorial Stones, 81. Another study finds hero worship practiced (as Teyyam ritual) to the exclusion of bhakti worship in northern Kerala: K. K. N. Kurup, "Memorial Tablets in Kerala," Memorial Stones, 248. I would stress the concept of continuity between these alternatives, which makes me reluctant to accept sharp distinctions between "folk" and "classical" in hero stones as in any genre of Indian art. zzo Mattison Mines, Public Faces, Private Voices: Community and Individuality in South India (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1994). 132</page><page sequence="75">One gift these tenth-century donors long to make is the gift of their own bodies. Individuated physical features therefore play a significant role in rendering their portraits. As I have argued else- where, these portraits resemble contemporary devotional poetry in their presentation of the physical body as the devotional self, the soul. The body was the instrument through which one worshipped. Representation of the individual devotee's entire, idiosyncratic body was, then, entirely appropriate on the god's house, especially for a devotee who had helped to build that house. The body that bound the devotee to his god might therefore resemble that divine body in its proportions, sculptural style and even its idiosyncrasies. The portrait body also mediates a kind of somatic communication be- tween viewers and the divine, appearing near the eye level of a visitor standing before the temple, and often facing in the direction in which that visitor must to worship a devakos.tha or to approach the lihga within the temple. In that role, the devotee gestures with simple sincerity, employing a body language of direct, legible speech. Patrons appear to have preferred the south wall of the temple, east of the inner shrine, for their portraits since that location permitted the portrait simultaneously to face a relief representation of a lihgapitha, a devakos.tha and the temple's inner shrine; to introduce visitors to the monument; and to direct viewers in circumambulation. The history of Indian portraiture from the tenth to the sixteenth century surely deserves further study. A quick glance reveals that while formats and media varied widely, the themes of virtuous heroism and devotional generosity persisted among portraiture's central concerns. Also evident is a marked increase in demonstrable instances of portraiture from the tenth century onward in many regions of the subcontinent.22 Portraiture flourished with the rise of medieval Hindu kingdoms, suggesting once again that this genre need not have relied on the intervention of external visual practices in order to function meaningfully for Indian viewers. 22' For example, life-sized portraits of Nayak donors are addorsed to pillars in temple hallways: see H. Heras, "The Royal Portraits of Mahabalipuram," Acta Orientalia 13 (1934), 163, n. z. Bronze became a favored medium for portraiture by the middle of the C61a period, and entire sets of bronze portraits of the Alvavr and Aiyanar saints can be found at large temples throughout South India. The earliest of these bronze portraits date from the tenth century. See R. Nagaswamy, Masterpieces of Early South Indian Bronzes (New Delhi: National Museum, 1983), H15-29 and Aravamuthan, Portrait Sculptures, 61-66.
