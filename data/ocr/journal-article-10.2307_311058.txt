<plain_text><page sequence="1">ASPECTS OF RELIGION IN CLASSICAL GREECE W. DEN BOER EARLY in the present century, Gilbert Murray wrote a book entitled Four Stages of Greek Relzgion; in a later edition (1925) another stage was added, and the book became known throughout the world under the title Five Stages of Greek Religion. With his view of Greek religion as a progression, toward humane behavior and rationality, both ultimately doomed to succumb to foreign influences, Murray represented the spirit of his time: history not as continuance but as progress, and this process arrested only by a catastrophe too great for the people of the later Classical world. This explains why the last chapter is headed " The Failure of Nerve": people were no longer psychically capable of dealing with the difficulties, both political and spiritual. Murray is but one example among many. His son-in-law, A. J. Toynbee, drew in bold lines a view of the development of the "civilizations" of the world which is essentially the same as the one his father-in-law defined for the Greeks. This is hardly surprising, since Toynbee began his career as a classicist at Oxford as one of Murray's students. But even without this coincidence both may be said to be representatives of the post-Darwinian and optimistic concepts of progress. It was therefore virtually inevitable that many, including Murray, directed their scholarly attention to the Classical period of Greek civilization, roughly from 600 to 300 (or 400) B.C. What came after that was decay and no longer "typically Greek," whatever that might be. The title of this paper has already made it clear that I do not share this interpretation of the historical development. That is why I speak of aspects, not of (consecutive) phases of this religion. The rich diversity of the religious phenomena cannot be forced into a rigid chronological system. A distinction has been made, for instance, between periods in which objects, animals, and anthropomorphic gods were worshipped. We all know that sacred objects were worshipped in all the periods of the religion of the Greeks; we need think only of the ear of corn, the herald's staff, the umbilicus of the earth, the tree cult without which Dodona would have meant nothing. And it is sufficiently well known</page><page sequence="2">2 W. den Boer that there was worship of gods in animal form: the Artemis festival in Brauron, in which the goddess was taken as a bear and the maidens in her service were called "she-bears"; Poseidon as the horse, the bull; the he-goat, the snake as animal symbols of virility, male fertility, and therefore worshipped to insure the continuance of the community. It is almost impossible to imagine the intensity with which grain was worshipped in an infertile country; how important the procreation and fertilization could be in a community accustomed to a high mortality of its domestic animals; and the extent to which the images of a primarily agricultural life could dominate human lives: the phallos as the plough, the womb as the earth. And these were in no sense remnants of primeval images which no longer had any meaning in later times. We know that in the forties of the fifth century B.c. an Athenian cleruchy, Brea in Thrace, annually sent a wooden phallos to Athens as an offering, as a fertility stimulus or symbol; and we all know how violent a storm of religious outrage was unleashed by the mutilation of the Hermae in 415 B.C. The ithyphallic Hermes placed at crossroads or elsewhere was a sign and guarantee of the fertility, that was repeatedly threatened and always vulnerable, of the community's precarious chance of survival. Only by realizing how great child mortality was, how many women died in childbirth, can we understand why large families were always desired - albeit with limitations arising from economic circumstances. Homer is our first major source for the lives of the Greeks, and he tells little of all this. This is understandable, because his personages and public belonged to a social stratum that kept to itself, and the description of their deeds and fates in a notorious war could offer little opportunity to include the ordinary life of ordinary days, the toiling farmer's struggle for a bare existence. I say "little" opportunity rather than "no" opportunity, because Achilles' lament in the underworld, Eumaios' account of his life, and several similes in the epic reveal that this other world existed and was familiar. Other elements outside the conventional description of the Homeric hero could be mentioned: the miracle in the epic - for which I need only refer to the talking horses of Achilles and the "unsportsmanly" behavior of the gods, who in a secretive and supernatural way restore lost or damaged weapons to their favorites - to put it more generally, the divine supernatural intervention - re-affirms the fact that the epic did not remain as aloof from what we call the irrational as has sometimes been claimed. The conventional doctrine of the older historians of religion and philologists said: "Concerning the pre-Grecian religion we know nothing." In the most ancient stage, according to them,</page><page sequence="3">Aspects of Religion in Classical Greece 3 religion is that of Homeric times, and this was superseded after the disappearance of the dominion of the aristocracy. After that, a folk religion dominated; it was only thanks to the educative value of the epic and the lyric poetry it gave rise to that the gods of the heroic poem continued to be held in high honor, but then mainly in the state cult. In my opinion, all this is based much too one-sidedly on the epic.1 It is hardly remarkable that another extreme - but one also saturated with the conventional doctrine - found supporters among scholars. They argued that the folk religion existed before Homer as well and that, for example, the earth, the mother goddess and her consort, the bird as a form of the epiphany of the gods, and the tree cult, were all to be found in pre-epic remnants, not in literary but in archeological survivals. They were, furthermore, anti-rationalistic and saw epic poetry as the cause of the decline of the old religion of the Earth Mother, who was supposed to have revived after the epic period had ended. This made it possible to regard the epic (and, with these poems, the state religion, which worshipped mainly the epic deities) as the murderer of the true "folk" religion, even though the murder was not entirely successful. In this approach, too, the stages are maintained - successive stages which remain separate as in the conventional doctrine itself. I must admit that I find the second approach more congenial, because it at least takes account of the earth-religion before as well as during the time of Homer.2 But I have two objections to it: first, the use of periodization, and second, the injustice done to Homer: because this view of Homer, the rationalist and creator of the intellectual, anthropo- morphic gods, does not do justice to him; and, in addition, no attention is given to the completely individual nature of the religion of the epic. This is a serious error, especially since Walter F. Otto, in his Gltter Griechenlands (1934), opened our eyes to this religion and the authentic forms in which it was manifested. He discussed this as Die Religion der 1 One of the first to formulate the theory about the three chronologically connected phases of Greek religion was L. R. Farnell. In one of his best shorter surveys of the subject, however, he remarks: "We may regard these beliefs and practices as the deposit of an age, not indeed of pure theriomorphism -for it is very doubtful if such ever existed in the history of religion - but of one when the anthropomorphic imagination was unstable and the divinity might be conceived as embodied now in human now in animal form" (italics mine). (The Higher Aspects of Greek Religion, Hibbert Lectures I9II, London 1912, p. 3,) 2 Incidentally, it may be recalled that the name " Dionysos" occurs in the Linear-B texts, which know of an Earth Goddess as well.</page><page sequence="4">4 W. den Boer Gestalt, which was properly adopted by Van der Leeuw in his Phaeno- menologie der Religion as indication of a highly distinct and individual manifestation of religion. The only conclusion the historian can draw from the two forms - i.e. the religion of powers of the earth, dominating rural life, on the one hand, and on the other the religion of the gods of epic poetry, which, as it were, reflect the aristocratic society magnified to divine proportions - is that they existed together at one time and were seen as equally important by people in later times for which we have more sources at our disposal; it is even true that a duality, not to speak of an antithesis, in these two forms of religious experience and in their ritual was never (to the best of my knowledge) felt and put into words. The philosophers criticized both. They said, on the one hand, that adultery was taught to man by the gods and, on the other hand, they considered the blood- sacrifice for the redemption of sins - a typical feature of the religion of the Earth - as using mire to clean up mire. This criticism, directed at both forms, was expressed sometimes with affective, sometimes with rational, even rationalistic, arguments. What must be stressed once again is that this criticism held for both the Olympian religion of the epic and the folk religion. It is useful to distinguish these aspects - not in time but in value, for particular social groups - as long as no separation is made between them. And even in making this distinction great care must be exercised, because the aristocrat was often just as attached to the religion of the Earth as the poor farmer, and, conversely, the religion worshipping the Olympians did not leave the small people untouched. What one would like very much to be able to evaluate is the intensity and sincerity of their belief in their gods. This is always difficult to determine, even when it concerns our contemporaries, our friends, even the members of our own families. It is so now, it was so in earlier eras. In essence, the inclinations of the heart remain unknown to us. But this does nothing to weaken the conclusion that seems to follow from the foregoing: The religion of the Greeks - if one wishes to and may use the definite article and uses the word "religion " in the singular - remains a subject with many aspects, even if the question of the time factor is not raised. Anyone who finds this strange should remember that this same diversity of aspect is also operative in our time. For instance, Roman Catholicism offers a rich diversity. For purposes of comparison with the Greek religion, we must not think of differences in dogma and ritual, or the function of priests and their manner of living, of the priestly function of laymen and the apostolic succession;</page><page sequence="5">Aspects of Religion in Classical Greece 5 we must concentrate solely on the ecclesiastical architecture, the church itself, and its ornamentation. Suppose that three thousand years from now, in a Europe destroyed by catastrophes many centuries earlier, remains should be found of the Cathedral of Chartres and of the church of the Dominican Sisters in Vence, which the paintings of Matisse have turned into a twentieth-century work of art. Who would think that both buildings had served as places of worship for one and the same form of religion ? This is why it cannot be sufficiently stressed that - for example - the distinction made between Pre-Hellenic (sometimes called Mediterranean) and Hellenic, at least with respect to religion, is dependent on an inadequate basis and would probably not be found valid if our knowledge of Minoan-Mycenaean culture were suddenly augmented by new discoveries, such as that of the Pylos tablets in 1939 (which made Ventris's decipherment possible). Another approach to aspects of religion concerns the community and the individual. An absolute distinction between the two is not really possible. Nevertheless, the Greek religion had elements which affected the community as a whole - the state religion in all its official expres- sions. And then there was the personal religion of the individual, where differentiation can also have a clarifying effect. One of the areas in which the two meet is the religion of the family. If the father presents and carries around his child during the ceremony of the Amphidromia, this is a matter of the brotherhood (phratry) to which he belongs, but it is also a family event; it is also a proud personal event: the recog- nition of his legitimate child. And the mother? Fortunately, we cannot forget her, even though tradition conveys more about fatherhood than about motherhood. Alcestis' prayer in Euripides' play is certainly drawn from life: "Goddess, now that I am to go down to the grave, I pray to you for the last time: foster my orphan children and give my son a loving wife and my daughter a noble husband" (Alc. I63). Queen, for I pass beneath the earth, I fall Before thee now, and nevermore, and pray: - Be mother to my orphans: mate with him A loving wife, with her a noble husband. The goddess to whom she prays is Hestia, the hearth; with a capital letter or not? The commentators hesitate, and I with them. Anthropo- morphism had its limits: the hearth is the center of family life, and marriage thrives under the warmth emanating from it.</page><page sequence="6">6 W. den Boer Alcestis' wish is for the continuance of the family; her prayer is not meant primarily to insure a happy marriage for her children, although she certainly wished that for them too. To speak of marriage is to think at the same time of children. The procreative function demanded by the community and accepted by the individual does not debase marriage. The distinction we make here is perhaps not permissible with respect to the Greeks, even though a notorious speech delivered in court (Dem. Contr. Neair.) says that the wife is for the bearing of children and that love is sought elsewhere. A lawyer's plea is always to be regarded with caution, no matter what the time or place! Whatever may have been the case in the fourth century B.C., in the oldest data the procreative aspect is always represented in the sacred character of marriage. Pherekydes of Syros speaks of the marriage of Zeus and Chthonie: Zeus gave his bride a gown and pronounced a sacramental formula: "Because I wish you to be my wife, I honor you with this: 'Hail to thee, and be my wife"' (ab 38 E OL XaLp TE KTal awVLaL). The author follows this with the statement: "That was the celebration of the unveiling," followed in turn by what is for us the important conclusion: ". . . as a result of this, this custom arose among gods and men." The "sacred marriage" of the highest god and goddess was celebrated in many parts of Greece, and a much later author states that ordinary human marriage was an imitation of this divine marriage.3 By their union the god and the goddess make the earth and mankind fertile. In their marriage, men and women fulfill a divine command. This is why it cannot be said that here all that is involved is a lawyer's plea in which the legitimate wife is assigned the function of bearing legitimate children and nothing more. This pro- creative function was the proud privilege of the married woman in primitive society. Without her no society could continue to exist. Her function of bearing children was not seen as a slight but rather a divine command. Isaeus,4 the specialist in inheritance law, conveys the great importance of the continuance of the family and reports the custom by which a man who has no children adopts one and brings him to the "house chapel" of the family and presents him to his relatives. Marriage is a social institution, and nuptial customs, including the " Pherek. fr. 2 (Diels-Kranz6, I952): EK TOl7TO Uy 0 VO61O EY EVETO KaI OEOrat Kal &amp;vOpcoTrotat. Cf.

But do we also detect - and it is a legitimate question - a purely personal religion, a surrender to a personal conviction, a commitment to something religious? We can certainly find such ex- amples. We remember first of all those cases in which personal convic- tion conflicted with the general rules of the community. Antigone, who was convinced that the religious duty to bury her brother superseded the laws of the community issued by the king, is one instance of this. It could also be less violent, however. No conflict arose for the young Ion, who was a servant of the temple and experienced complete religious fulfillment in his function - an example of pure devotion. A third example is offered by Hippolytus, the son of Theseus, who refused his stepmother Phaedra when she fell in love with him. Festugibre has given a moving analysis of this personality in his Personal Religion among the Greeks (I954).5 Each year the maidens of Troizen who had reached a marriageable age - before they had lost their virginity - brought a lock of hair as offering to Hippolytus, god or hero, in his sanctuary. They thus gave something of themselves as sign and evidence that they were living in the virginal state in which he himself had lived. His "purity" was not sexual continence, and as such morally meritorious, because any young man could have a mistress or keep a slave or hetaera without parental or communal censure. He could have another boy or adult man as lover, although his partner had to come from the same social group as himself and not be "bought." Thus there was a difference between heterosexuality and homosexuality, but there was no "prohibition" concerning either of the two forms of love, and therefore Hippolytus' rejection of Aphrodite was not a sign of moral purity. The central fact is that he belonged to another goddess. This conflict between Artemis, the goddess of the hunt, whom he served, and Aphrodite, who was the ally of Phaedra, formed a new expression and continuation of the eternal quarrel between the two goddesses. A deep attachment, even (if we may believe Festugibre) a mystical bond with the goddess, had taken posses- sion of the young man, the personal servant of Artemis: he wished to devote himself solely to her.6 5 I have nothing to add to his revealing description, summarized thankfully in the text of this paper. 6 A. J. Festugiere, Personal Religion among the Greeks (Berkeley, Los Angeles 1954) 15. It must be stressed that Festugiere - in my opinion rightly - contra- dicts the two well-known interpretations of the character of Hippolytus in Euripides' play. Wilamowitz depicted him as the passionate hunter, indifferent to the soft seduction of human love, avYEaOpOd&amp;rog. Linforth made him the cham-</page><page sequence="8">8 W. den Boer I do not know whether this interpretation does not tend too far in the direction stressed in Festugiere's book: for him personal religion is almost exclusively the mysticism of the believers, whose ultimate objec- tive is union with the deity. Whether this was the case for the Hippolytus of Euripides I dare to doubt, and it is irrelevant for our subject. The main thing is that the young son of Theseus refuses to give his father's wife what she wants because he is possessed by another service, another bond - that of the pure goddess of the hunt, the virginal and formidable deity. What arouses the fury of Aphrodite is that, like his goddess, he scorns physical love. There was an extremely close relationship between personal religion and the veneration of relics. Here we have an aspect of religion that can be followed from pagan Antiquity into Christendom from its beginning to the present day. And in this too there is an element of public religion side by side with personal religion. When it was told that the remains of Theseus were transported from the Island of Skyros to Athens in 476 B.C. by the statesman and admiral Cimon, this was an act having importance for the community, for it concerned Theseus, the founder hero of the city because he had brought about the synoikismos of Attica. This belief found response in Athens: the bones transported by Cimon were part of Theseus. Very often the belief of the individual and the religion of the state were linked together by hero worship. Often the original hero was the beloved deceased whose memory was cherished in the family, but whose influence on the community increased in the course of time. We can no longer separate these two aspects. An elegant example is found in a fragment from Euripides' Antiope in which Hermes speaks: "If you pay your dead wife the last honors, you must burn her earthly remains and collect the ashes and strew them in Ares' spring, so that the spring-water pion of sexual continence. Both are wrong, I think.The word avE7rracpd&amp;0roS literally means he (or she) who misses the charms of Aphrodite, not he who does not give in to Aphrodite. On the other hand, it seems to me a thoroughly modern anachronism to suppose that young Hippolytus refused sexual intercourse because he wished to control his passions. I agree with Festugibre when he says, "All considered, I would prefer to put Hippolytus in the category of the blushing boys than admit that, being inclined toward physical intercourse with the other sex, he still represses himself. This is something I believe a Greek could not have understood" (ibid., 145). For Wilamowitz's views, see his edition of Euripides' Hippolytus (Berlin 1891), especially p. 47, and for Lin- forth's, his article, "Hippolytus and Humanism," TAPA 45 (1914) 5-16.</page><page sequence="9">Aspects of Religion in Classical Greece 9 acquires the name of Dirke and flows through the city and thus con- tinues to moisten the fields of Thebes with its water."' Here we see a personal command whose purpose serves the com- munity. It would be difficult to think of a better example of the tie between individual and community. The Christian veneration of saints very often had the same personal origin, after which the personally beloved deceased only later became a benefactor of the community. An additional factor was that during his life the saint already possessed a miraculous power. The Holy Scriptures had already set an example in the Acta Apostolorum, according to which the clothing of the Apostle Paul worked miracles of healing.8 This X'pts, this magical power, later became an element of popular religion as well as an element of political religion. Thus did the medieval kings heal the sick as soon as they had been crowned- as, for instance, the French king at Reims.9 Before we leave this aspect with its dual content, one thing should be stressed - that the miracle performed once or more than once by the beloved dead man who becomes a hero or saint, had conclusive force. For us, who are usually skeptics, what we are pleased to call a miracle kindles distrust. But in the Classical world, to the contrary, the miracle was seen as evidence of the power of gods, heroes, of deceased men and saints. Luther must teach us once again what we moderns are often in danger of forgetting: "Das Wunder ist des Glaubens liebstes Kind." Is there, we might ask, besides the religion of the individual and the community, also a religion of the upper social level and the lower social level ? The answer to this question will prove to be affirmative, although here too a differentiation must be made; a deep separation between the 7 The most important contribution to the subject is found in F. Pfister, Der Reliquienkult im Altertum, 2 vols. (Giessen 1909-1912), especially the conclusion on p. 622. Of the many books on the Greek hero cult, H. J. Rose, Gods and Heroes of the Greeks (London 1957), deserves to be mentioned as a clear and charming introduction to the subject. It is to be regretted that no special study has ever been devoted, as far as I know, to the public and personal aspects of the modes of veneration of relics and their relation to each other. Pfister does not explicitly deal with the problem, although he offers a considerable amount of material, see Der Reliquienkult 428, the fragment of Euripides' Antiope mentioned above; cf. M. Untersteiner, I frammenti dei tragici greci (Milan 1925) 95. 8 Acts of the Apostles 19.12; cf. Pfister (above, n. 7) 611. 9 M. Bloch, Les Rois thaumaturges (Paris 1924; re-edited 1961). See also O.

First of all, the differences between rich and poor were not great; 10 the landed farmer and the crofter shared in essence the same fears for their harvest, took part in the same sowing ceremonies and harvest festivals. In the sphere of Eleusis, the festivals of Demeter, the mysteries (which still baffle us), social differences played no part. Nevertheless, social conclusions have been drawn by modern scholars, and some of these deserve our attention. The first of these is that the consultation of an oracle, in Delphi, for example, was considered a "primitive" custom practiced by superstitious people and exploited by leaders of state, themselves enlightened in spirit and superior to belief in oracles, to mislead the masses. The oracles were, it was held, the work of politically trained priests, sometimes included in the literature as an aesthetic component, sometimes to create order in the material the author wished to treat, but always absolutely unhistorical and invented solely to gull the people. I have attempted elsewhere to demonstrate the untenability of this thesis in relation to the historical literature and especially for Herodotus.11 But a few words must be said concerning this classification according to a socially higher - if you prefer, richer, wealthier - group and a socially lower --if you prefer, poorer --group. Here we see the consequences of our nineteenth-century inheritance, the influence of which still persists. During that period, in the universities of continental Europe, an orthodox Catholic or Protestant was often a rara avis, and this is one of the reasons why denominational universities were founded. Religion, especially when it was not a "rational" religion, was con- sidered an incomprehensible atavism. One of Charles Darwin's grand- daughters tells, in a charming account of her girlhood in Cambridge, how alien the irrational forms of religion were to her father and his brothers. These were men of high principles, who were also completely convinced of the rightness of Christian morality - but the mystery, the intimacy of religion, sin, and mercy, all this was strange to them. And if there was still a religious sympathy (what remnants of Christian confession continued to exist we need not go into; they were there, but with individual or social differences), this was a purely private matter. Huizinga, who certainly had a keen eye for almost all forms of religious experience, subscribed to what the Darwin brothers, a generation 10 Excellent treatments of this subject are found in the dissertations prepared under H. Bolkestein in the Utrecht School of Ancient History. See especially J. Hemelrijk, "Poros and Penia" (1925). 11 Tijdschrift v. Geschiedenis 83 (1970) 504, 5o6ff.</page><page sequence="11">Aspects of Religion in Classical Greece I I before him, also found to be self-evident: "In refined company one does not speak of religion." This mentality was completely strange to the Greeks - of whatever social level - but it was smuggled uncon- sciously into the history of religion. If the Greeks remained silent concerning certain religious matters, they did so because silence was prescribed - for instance, about the appypra of the mysteries, and not because of embarrassment or lack of comprehension. It is true that older forms of religion were sometimes referred to with distaste, as was the case with respect to the myths of the gods, which offended enlightened Greeks. Aeschylus rejects vicarious punishment, Plato the "boorish wisdom" of the allegorical explanation. But these are not social prejudices, not condemnation of a group. The gods of Olympus were gods of all men; the gods of the earth were venerated everywhere and by everyone. The demons and nymphs, the satyrs and tree spirits, were believed in by people in proportion to their exposure to these forces of nature. There is no single source that says, "these gods were especially for the wealthy, these gods were venerated by the poor." The most that could be said is that farmers and seamen had other major gods whom they worshipped, but even this holds only partially. Poseidon was a sea god but also god of the land. Nonetheless, regarded in this way, there was, after all, one exceptional religious current on the periphery of Greek society, namely Orphism. If we first formulate what Orphism was, we may call it a system belong- ing to theological thinkers who embodied their ideas in poems, knew an (authoritarian) religion from sacred books, and had Orpheus as their patron. This singer, originally the servant of Apollo, is said to have adopted the ecstatic cult of Dionysus. He was, according to some (who were here following Nietzsche's well-known distinction) respon- sible for the union of Apollo and Dionysus into one concept. The Orphic theologians, so it is alleged, had characterized their old singer Orpheus in this way, and this is not what could be expected of a man belonging to the lower classes. Is this picture of the historical development plausible? The union of Apollo and Dionysus is certainly neither indicated nor implied by the fragments. We may begin with this point, and that frees us from Nietzsche's dichotomy. There are certainly elements in the Greek religion - and not only there - which to the outsider seem to be contradictory - for example, calm wisdom and wild madness, both occurring in the experience of a single individual. William James has taught us that the varieties of religious experience, particularly in one individual, can be many and also contradictory in the eyes of the</page><page sequence="12">12 W. den Boer rational beholder. But what has the religious man to do with the rational onlooker, who always remains an outsider? Nothing whatever. It seems wiser to leave out of consideration the contradictions that Orpheus, as servant of two gods, is supposed to have reconciled. His person, rising wraithlike from a mythical past, cannot clarify anything for us in this context. Let us return to the phenomena of Orphism and its adherents. They know a theogony that seems to us bizarre, perhaps because of the source, which is comic in nature: Aristophanes in his Birds. We know some- thing about Dionysus as the god of Orphism: that the Titans killed him, tore him to bits and devoured the pieces; and that mankind, the descendents of the Titans, must expiate this sin - in other words, a concept of original sin. We know of the vegetarian habits of the Orphics, which are supposed to be based on the idea of metempsychosis; it was even forbidden to wear woolen clothing, to bring the clothing to sacred places, or to use it to wrap the dead for burial. The grave is not the final end for the human soul, which, by passing through a series of rebirths, can acquire eternal salvation. Now, the question is: are we concerned here with folk religion or an invention of a higher level of society? Or, to apply the comparison drawn by one of our leading modern scholars: Salvation Army or theosophy? William Booth or Annie Besant? The arguments are not very solid on either side. I may mention one that inclines me to accept a folk religion, and that is the possession of sacred books. All other aspects of Orphism can be found everywhere, among all ranks and stations. But the sacred book implies an attitude that in the Greek world would be very hard to conceive of as belonging to a socially higher group, although I willingly admit that it remains possible. What follows here is therefore in no sense meant as a certainty but only as a hypothesis. In the first place, a sacred book implies a magic of the word. The believer takes the book or the scroll and eats it, and in his mouth it tastes sweet as honey; but when he swallows it his stomach turns sour (Apoc. 10.Io). This is not an arbitrary image but a religious experience with respect to Holy Scripture. "Nothing may be added to it, nothing may be taken away from it." 12 This sanctity of the written word is perceptible in the first legal codes of the Greeks. The period of these earliest laws lies in the seventh century, just when the written word had begun to spread on a wider scale. This is the background required 12 W. C. van Unnik, "De la regle /77E rrpoaOwEvatcC /I'r &amp;cEAEv dans l'histoire du canon," Vig. Chr. 3 (1949) 1-36.</page><page sequence="13">Aspects of Religion in Classical Greece 13 for a sacred book. A second condition is a public that can read; a universal ability is not necessary, but the written text must be accessible to a certain portion of the community. The respect for the written word of the deity is transferred to others via the Scribe or Commentator who can write down, read, and explain the word. It might seem at first sight that a sacred book could originate only among intellectuals, because we accept books as natural among this social group. But the true veneration of the book, or rather the belief in the sacredness of the book, is a religious experience belonging to a pre-literate class. It is argued that Orphism was something belonging to the little man, who would share in the blessings of the hereafter at the end of an earthly existence full of cares; and that in Attica, in the time of Pisis- tratus, this solace in the hereafter was offered to the poor countryman, and the punishment of the rich oppressor would be the sweet satisfac- tion to be enjoyed in anticipation by the souls of the poor. I think that this conclusion goes too far and is not confirmed by the sources, but I do believe that the poor Greek, at least if he were susceptible, could find solace in the eschatology of Orphism. I am inclined to see it as a sect of the lower class. If this raises the objection that the man who thought this out (the theogony as well as the eschatology, the regimen as well as the Orpheus mythology) must have been someone belonging to a higher stratum, then I should answer that it is not obligatory that the founder (or foundress) of a religious movement belong socially to the group to which he (or she) addresses himself (or herself). The poor devils who went to the Orpheotelest, like the superstitious man in Theophrastus' Character of the Bigot, did not think out this movement,13 but the entire complex of explanations, rules for living, and expecta- tions after death attracted them. By what means? We do not know, because we do not know the propagandists, not to mention the power of their words and the persuasiveness of their conviction. One thing 13 Therefore, I cannot agree with W. K. C. Guthrie when he says: "The Greek genius was not dogmatic. The Orphics were dogmatists." Both assertions are biased. Guthrie unconsciously takes the view that a book-religion is, as such, " dogmatic," which is not always so. On the contrary, some of the Christian heretics, for instance, who adhere to the letter of Holy Writ, are exceptionally undogmatic. I suppose that nineteenth-century "dogma" influenced Guthrie and others who wrote in the same vein. This dogma finds its basis in the belief that the Greeks were enlightened by philosophy and reason, and practiced their ritual according to their reasonable and personal views on cult and rite without a strictly prescribed pattern that they had to follow. This, however, tends to make the believer an individual interpreter of sacred tradition, which he very rarely was. Sacred acts in rite and cult were often circumstantially prescribed, and were based on rules of custom that the believer had to obey.</page><page sequence="14">14 W. den Boer is certain - it was not only in isolated cases that religious (and I would add, political) leaders came from a higher social level and revealed ideas that were accepted by the poor. The strength with which these ideas impressed their fascination on much wider circles in the fourth century is shown to us by the philosophy of Plato, which, in its eschatol- ogy, for instance, is related to Orphism. This development is hardly surprising. Christianity, too, penetrated from a lower level of the population to a higher one. A last objection to the view that the Orphics originally found their following among the needy is that their conception of the "wheel of births," the continually renewed existence, did not abolish the distress of the poor; it is argued that the poor would want an immediate improvement of their lot and would therefore have had no need of a religion that required, even in the hereafter, a repeated return to earthly misery. What a thoroughly materialistic argument this is, and how extraneous to Orphism as a religious movement! For, after all, if it is true that man lives under "original sin" because he descends from the Titans who killed Dionysus, his fate is predetermined by this. The believer in original sin knows that he is guilty at all times and on both sides of the grave. Just what religious guilt is will never be under- stood by anyone who does not profess a religion recognizing this guilt. That the man living under the weight of original sin has in any case one hope, and that he can indeed be redeemed, is a religious and not a social solace. In Orphism the condemnability of man was preached, and sometimes this struck a responsive chord, but usually it did not, as can be judged from the relatively scarce data, which are especially scarce as compared with those concerning other aspects of Greek religiosity.14 Much concerning Orphism remains uncertain, but I would tentatively maintain that it was one of the forms of personal religion among the Greeks. The man who lives in the world of nature, the farmer, the shepherd, the woodcutter, these have their personal religion. Satyrs and nymphs, Demeter and Eleusis, the goat and the sheep - everything has its meaning. This kind of man also lives within the community of the state, and there the personal element, it seems to us, is entirely or 14 The fragments have been collected by O. Kern in Orphicorum fragmenta (1920). Later studies were discussed by Guthrie in the second edition of his Orpheus and Greek Religion (London 1952). See also M. P. Nilsson, Opuscula selecta III 628ff; and also for a totally different view, I. M. Linforth, The Arts of Orpheus (1941). A lucid summary of the debated questions is to be found in M. P. Nilsson, Geschichte der Griechischen Religion, 12 678ff.</page><page sequence="15">Aspects of Religion in Classical Greece 15 almost entirely suppressed. But whether this is really so remains a question - I must in any case set it aside. Between the personal religion of the natural man and the farmer on the one hand and the state religion on the other, lies the wide domain of the family religion, to which brief reference has already been made. Is there more to be noted in the borderline area between the individual and the state? Magic, the influencing of the gods for ends injurious to a fellow man, the curse, the defixio, belongs here too. We know the katadesmos, the binding of the personal enemy by the magic spell.15 The frequent occur- rence of these curses on lead tablets and shards - sometimes in the fourth century carrying the well-known names of politicians - has led to the opinion that these maledictions resulted from the radical democratization of Athens. The abundance of fourth-century material may be purely a matter of chance; as compared to later times, the number of tablets is not strikingly high. It seems more likely that we are concerned here with a general occurrence of magic spells and not with a phenomenon characteristic of a given time. There is a little more still to be said about the phenomenon of magical practices. An English scholar speaks, not without irony, about "the comfortable belief in evolution" in talking of magic. He quite rightly sees the phenomenon as human effort. The magician attempts to force the supernatural powers to carry out his desires and to avert what he fears. I have as little desire as this scholar to broach a discussion of the differences between magic and religion, and wish only to conclude that my research, like his, has convinced me that the religious man submits to the deity; although he reveals his needs to his god in his prayer, he always ends with " Thy will be done." Magic, to the contrary, is a manipulation of the deity, a theurgia, to obtain fulfillment of a mortal's wish. It is certainly true that cult and rite, liturgy and the wording of prayers, contain elements pointing in the direction of magic. But, like my English colleague, I prefer to reverse the evolutionary principle that magic precedes religion and maintain that magic is a deterioration, a later degeneration of religion.16 15 R.

Theurgie.</page><page sequence="16">16 W. den Boer For the Greeks, the adoration of the image also forms an aspect of religion with which magic is sometimes (but not always) related. Hippolytus, standing before the image of his goddess, perceives her presence, experiences an intense union with her."7 To go into the essence of image worship would take us beyond the scope of this paper. Two remarks must suffice. In the state religion the image has a central function which may not be dismissed by calling it superficial idolatry. Franz Overbeck has rightly collected the signs of warm veneration for Athena Parthenos as she was sculptured by Phidias. It may certainly not be said that feelings of veneration for this image were less fervent than those for the old wooden figure, made less impressively and of a less valuable material. In the second place, the image in itself often fills a religious need. Dio Chrysostomos plumbed the deepest meaning of the human desire to worship an image when he wrote: Through their longing for the divine all people have a powerful urge to worship and serve the deity from nearby. Like children that have been taken away from their father and mother, they are filled with a strange longing and often in their dreams reach out their hands to their parents who are not there, so too do people in their love for the gods seek - and properly so because of their benefits and affinity - in all possible ways to be with them and in their company. That images had a power which resided in them often became in later times the only motive, however. Even the philosopher Plotinus, who explicitly rejected images, finally became resigned to this common experience.18 There is a misconception, inadequately disputed, that philosophy and religion are inimical to each other. This may have become so in later periods, but before that and from the very beginning, this was certainly not the case. Greek religion can, if necessary, be studied without considering philosophy, but there are parts of philosophy that cannot be understood without considering religion. Empedocles, Epimenides, the miracle-workers, shamans, and traveling "medicine men" - they are often taken as limited to the seventh and sixth centuries and then allowed to reappear in the Hellenistic period. This is in my opinion not justified; once again scholars of the last hundred years have been 17 A. J. Festugibre (above, n. 6) 15, 145. 18 Dio Chrys. XII 60; Plotinus, Enn. IV 3, ii1; cf.

Greek Piety (1948) 168-69.</page><page sequence="17">Aspects of Religion in Classical Greece 17 misled by their evolutionary dogma and once again they have simply attributed to Classical Antiquity what has happened in Western Europe since the Renaissance. The Simon Magus of the New Testament had a series of predecessors and successors respected and feared in their time. But this man, if he deserved to be called a philosopher, will certainly never acquire the distinction and fame that has fallen to Pythagoras' share through the centuries. It is difficult for us to localize in time the philosophical and political activity,19 the religious tradition of his &amp;Kov'Ualo7a, his preaching. The precepts are usually considered as popular superstition (volkstiimlicher Aberglaube)20 - I shall not go into this deprecatory judgment, a modern and perhaps rather too facile condemnation. What is important when we speak of aspects of Greek religion is that the wise man - that is, the true philosopher longing for wisdom - gave rules for living that had a religious sanction. And this brings us to another - and our last - field: law or rule and religion. We must keep clearly in mind here that it is completely irrelevant whether a rule is rationally acceptable or not. The prohibition against eating the flesh of certain animals, the sacredness of such fruits of the fields as beans, and purification rites - all have a meaning for believers; even if they seem strange to an outsider, he may not add his own coloring to the things which regulated life in the Greek world. And he certainly may not - as was done by almost all the contributors to a collective work which appeared a few years ago - set the Greek prescriptions for purification aside as older taboos of primitivism, as remnants of Oriental influences, or as barbaric customs originating from the North. All the adherents of the evolutionary dogma who see the Greek as the discoverers of the (rational) mind, progressing vom Mythos zum Logos, have shut at least the religious door that can lead to an understanding of the Greek domain (or part of it).21 The same bias can be discerned where not religious prescriptions for cult, rite, or food are concerned, but rather rules of conduct in general - in other words, the laws of the community, of the state. Most scholars make a strict distinction between morality and religion; at most, they leave room for religion as the source of sanction for the morality. Bolkenstein has even regarded this as a criterion for the distinction between Greek and Oriental: Greek law derives from man, 19 See K. von Fritz, Pythagorean Politics in Southern Italy, (New York 1940). 20 So Nilsson GGR I 662ff, esp. 667. 21 La notion du divin: entretiens sur l'antiquitd classique I. See my review in Museum 61 (1956) 91-94.</page><page sequence="18">18 W. den Boer Jewish law from God.22 And late in his life, Schwartz stated it frankly, as follows: "Anyone who wishes to approach Greek ethics, must first of all discard one universal error, according to which that which we call "morals" derives from a religious belief. In reality, at least for the ancient peoples, ethics is independent of religion and its impact is on both gods and men."23 This idea is simplistic and, still worse, wrong. A better and more subtle evaluation was arrived at by K. Latte, who pointed out that the religious movements in Greece --for instance, that of Delphi-- contributed to the formation of a persisting state of law and order. But, according to Latte, the oracles only formulated what was already recognized universally as a practical line of conduct. From this point of view, religion and law are two different (the emphasis here is mine) forms of expression of the same force that is operative in mankind. The influence of religion on the ideology of legislation extends only to the external form, as, for example, in a series of sacred features of the administration of justice and of contracts; but this process and these contracts are not affected by the religion itself. Moral problems are barely involved (in contrast to the situation for the oracles). It may even be said that the importance of these problems decreased to the same degree that the conviction became stronger among the Greeks themselves that the gods look down in wrath on violation of the law, but their intervention was not obtainable by any religious acts of any nature whatever. This is, so it is alleged, in sharp contrast to the religion of the oldest time, when the gods were more mighty powers whom man did better not to arouse, but were not yet moral powers punishing crime and wickedness without further ado.24 There is, indeed, more than enough evidence that, in the oldest Greek criminal law, the deity is the most powerful and man is "punished" even when he has no moral guilt. In fact, the difference of opinion is not on this point.25 But that the gods were first simply powers and only later became moral beings is an evolutionary view that we have already had to stigmatize several times as modern heresy. The "super-ethical" in religion is not bound to any time or place: it is Jewish and it is Greek. 22 H. Bolkestein, De godsdienst in het leven der Grieken (Haarlem I947); cf. my reservations on these views in De godsdienst van de Grieken2 (1965) 56. 23 E. Schwartz, Ethik der Griechen (Stuttgart 1951) I3. 24 K. Latte, Heiliges Recht, Unters. zur Geschichte der sakralen Rechtsformen in Griechenland (Ttibingen 1920) Iff (also in Nilsson, GGR I 607). 25 A searching analysis was given by K. Latte in Der Rechtsgedanke im friihen Griechentum, Antike und Abendland 2 (1946) 63-76 (later republished in Kleine Schriften, Munich 1968, 233-51).</page><page sequence="19">Aspects of Religion in Classical Greece 19 And the question of whether morality is linked to the powerful or the just god simply does not exist for the believer. For might is right and right is might as far as the deity, the creator, the immortal, is concerned. Man is neither creator nor immortal. This defines the "total difference" of the deity.26 In the early fortunes of man the god of Delphi did far more than just sanction existing laws; the god also points out the roads, sometimes obscure, that man must travel.27 To explain his initiative always as effect and never as cause is in my opinion prompted by a dogmatism having its roots in a certain aversion to the religious element in law- giving. It is, I think, entirely erroneous to speak of Law and Religion as parallel forms of expression of the human spirit, as Latte does. In my view, we must read the testimony as indicating that the law rested on the base formed by religion and was sanctified by it.28 What Dodds says is certainly true: "Divine law, like early human law, takes no account of motive and makes no allowance for human weakness."29 But this extremely perceptive author also sees in the humanization of the law a kind of progress, and in the agreement between the old heavenly and the old earthly laws only a similarity, not a derivation of the latter from the former. It is not my task to combat the highly esteemed scholars I have mentioned. But I should like to point explicitly to some phenomena that cannot be argued away. The founding of cities is guided by Apollo, the leader (exegetes); the new city receives its laws from Apollo (not only their ratification, as Bolkenstein claims). The law is "word," rhetra, and comes from the god; the word manteion, says Plutarch, means the same. Anyone who doubts that Plutarch was right bears the burden of proof. Such laws can be hard, like all divine words; they can even offend our sense of justice like the sense of justice of the Greeks themselves. But man must obey them nonetheless. Where ancient law prevailed, there was obedience, submission; power and discipline are the counterparts of law and rule. Even in the world of the gods, when it is projected anthropomorphically, as in the epic, 26 W. B. Kristensen, Het boven-ethische in de godsdienst (The " Supra-ethical " in Religion), in the collection of his essays Symbool en Werkelijkheid (Symbol and Reality), Arnhem 1954, 36-48. Cf. my paper "Op zoek naar de Grieken en hun goden" (Seeking the Greeks and their Gods), Forum der Letteren 2 (1961) 161-70, esp. 168. 27 E.g., Herodotus 6. 86. 28 Nilsson, GGR I 607. Cf. R.

Dodds, The Greeks and Their Gods (Paperback ed. 1957) 35-</page><page sequence="20">20 W. den Boer that which must happen, the way of Moira, fortune, is sometimes an enigma. The gods submit, like men, either willingly or unwillingly. Anyone who associates law with reason, and morality with a precise regulation of what is and what is not permissible, assumes a well- regulated constitutional state in which secularization is so far advanced that there is no longer any question of Law; instead, the individual circumstances of a guilty man standing before the law determine the judge's decision. Whether this is good or bad we need not examine. And, indeed, who could decide one way or the other, again dogmati- cally? One thing is certain, the law-giver and the judge who knows himself bound to the divine origin of the law cannot take personal circumstances into account. If, therefore, Dodds quite rightly says that the ancient law, divine or human, does not take human weakness into account, he in my opinion also indicates by these words that the origin of law must be sought in the divine inexorable pronouncement.30 There is, lastly, a reverse side to this medal. Not only is religion the basis of communal life, but, conversely, communal life is also the basis of religion. Aristotle says somewhere, 7i 1r6(Av 7roAcrUv p7TrE7TEL rtfOOlat TOVS' Eos: (only) by citizens is it proper for the gods to be worship- ped.31 And in a dialogue, allegedly by Plato, the Axiochos, there is an expression, usually held to be Orphic, man is yEVrpq 7S lTv OEW.v, that is to say, a member of the clan of the gods. It is the clan that gives rise to the ideas of blood-guilt, of blood-revenge, of retaliation, but also of redemption and atonement. There is nothing remarkable about all this, the sphere of religion and the sphere of the family are inseparable. How strongly this bond functions can be judged from philosophy. Just as Kant's ethics bear the stamp of Protestantism and of the Old Testament, so does Greek thought, in which social virtues are related to civil ideals, reflect the atmosphere of the religion of the polis, which was a unit of families and relatives.32 Above everything and everyone reigns the self-revealing deity who often leads man where he does not wish to go. But the deity also reveals himself as protector, as friend, as beloved. Wilamowitz once wished to characterize the difference between Christendom and Greek religion in the following way. The Greek religion says: Love is God; Christen- 30 The question of the extent to which "merit" and "responsibility" in- fluenced law and the practices of the law courts, goes beyond the scope of this paper. See on this point, e.g. A. H. W. Adkins, Merit and Responsibility (Oxford I 96o). 31 Politica 7, 9 (1329). 32 Cf. L. R. Farnell (above, n. 1) 73, esp. 79-80.</page><page sequence="21">Aspects of Religion in Classical Greece 21 dom says: God is Love. In this reversal of subject and predicate a deep difference between the two worlds is expressed. I do not know whether this is so. It is unquestionably true that in Christendom "Love is God" would certainly not be said of Eros. On the other hand, for Hippolytus, for example, his Artemis is indeed Love, and he will not have been an exception in the Greek world. It therefore requires courage - a courage I do not possess - to deny for the Greeks just this variety of the religious experience embodied in "God is Love." The self-revealing gods could be everything-- justice, hate, wrath, punishment, retribution - but they could also reveal themselves in loveliness, so it can be said: God is Love. There is a Christian hymn which begins with the line, "Ich bete an die Macht der Liebe, die sich in Christus offenbart." Substitute for "Christ" the name of a Greek god, and you will by doing so have put into words an experience that I believe was not denied to the Greeks. UNIVERSITY OF LEIDEN</page></plain_text>
