<plain_text><page sequence="1">S. G. F. BRANDON (ed.): The saviour god : comparative studies in the concept of salvation presented to Edwin Oliver James by colleagues and friends to commemorate his seventy-fifth birthday. xxii, 242 pp., front. Manchester: Manchester University Press, [1963]. 37s. 6d. The collection of 15 essays, more or less closely related in content to the concept of salvation, are dedicated by friends and colleagues to a scholar whose influence in the development of the comparative study of religion in this country-and further afield-- has been great indeed. The range of his interests may be seen in the list of his principal published writings from the period 1917 to 1962. The extent of his influence is outlined in an appreciation by S. H. Hooke, whose own services in the same and in related fields have also been of great significance. Anyone who endeavours to cover so much of the wide range of the study of religion is bound to meet with criticism. The documents of the religions cover a variety of languages as broad as is mankind itself, a variety which no human being could hope to compass. It has sometimes been doubted whether it is wise for a scholar to embark on studies which must inevitably mean great reliance upon the work of others, especially in the translation and interpretation of texts. Where scholars differ-as they so frequently do-in the interpretation of obscure and sometimes fragmentary texts, there is, of course, always need for caution. Some of the confident affirmations in this field a generation ago have been shown to depend upon what are now known to be faulty renderings. But there is also need, where there is uncertainty, for the application of comparative study which, judiciously used, may bring new light to obscure texts, and throw up the significance of as yet imperfectly understood allusions, and there will always be a need for scholars who can thus look at the evidence with a wider perspective and without the hindrances of a too narrow specialization. The tribute paid to Professor James by the contributors to this volume is ample testimony to the influence he has had on thinking in the field of the study of religion. The contributions themselves range over a wide field. 'Isis as saviour goddess' is discussed in a carefully documented essay by C. J. Bleeker, and Egyptian religion provides the main basis for the discussion of 'The ritual technique of salvation in the ancient Near East' by the editor, S. G. F. Brandon, in which comparisons and contrasts are made with Christian belief and practice. Islam is represented by the essays of Annemarie Schimmel and W. Montgomery Watt; Buddhism by those of Ninian Smart-in which a comparison is made with Christian belief-and of Edward Conze ; 'An African saviour god' is discussed by Geoffrey Parrinder. Other of the essays investigate matters of more general religious concern: of the nature of concepts for the description of deity-as in J. Duchesne- Guillemin's essay on 'Some aspects of anthropomorphism '; and of the relationship, surely of fundamental importance, between theories concerning creation and salvation and hence the nature of man and of his condition and relationship to the deity, discussed by H. D. Lewis. And this is to mention only a selection from an interesting and varied list, sufficiently unified by the overall pattern of the volume which gives the book more of unity than such collections sometimes possess. Only a selection of these essays is fully within the competence of the present reviewer, and among these it may be convenient to single out one for mention as being particularly penetrating, namely that of Marcel Simon, 'Remarques sur la soteriologie du Nouveau Testament' (this essay is in French, one by Angelo Brelich on ' Politeismo e soteriologia ' is in Italian; the remainder are in English). Professor Simon poses a series of questions concerning the relationships between the Christianity of the early years and the mystery religions and contemporary Greek and Jewish religion in general. Contrasting the historically based Christian religion with the mysteries, and with the allegorizing of other religious thinking, he points to the difficulties which such a historical basis makes for soteriological thinking. The timeless quality of some religious systems makes them readily appli- cable to all men and all periods; it also makes them readily identifiable with one another. Christianity faces the problem of a historical sequence before its advent which is in some sense not covered by its claims. Professor Simon points to the survival within Chris- tianity of ideas of salvation which belong to Judaism. He points to the oversimplified presentation of the contrast between Jewish and Greek religion-a matter which has been the subject of discussion in recent years also in the semantic field. He points to the variety and inconsistency of ideas concerning the</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 205 nature of life after death in the early Christian community. It is a useful comment on and corrective to those discussions which tend to oversimplify. The religious beliefs of any individual, let alone of any community, are never so completely ordered and co-ordinated as to exclude a variety of not entirely consis- tent elements. The recognition of this provides us with a richer and more colourful picture than attempts at oversystematizing what often defies system. The editor and sponsors are to be congratu- lated on an interesting and stimulating volume, worthy of the one to whom it is dedicated. P. R. ACKROYD</page></plain_text>
