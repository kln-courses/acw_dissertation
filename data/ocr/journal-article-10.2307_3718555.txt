<plain_text><page sequence="1">420 Short Notices SHORT NOTICES Professor Henry Liideke is one of the leading Continental scholars in the field of English studies. He is one of the editors of a journal which has always been respected for its contributions to the scholarship of English and valued as an important link between scholars on the Continent and in this country. It was partly on Professor Liideke's initiative that English Studies, though still published from Amsterdam, was transformed from a merely Dutch organ into a periodical which speaks for Holland, Belgium, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden and Denmark, so that it is now a fine product of the enterprising co-operation of the smaller countries of northern and western Europe. It is fitting that this journal should have honoured Professor Ludeke on his sixtieth birthday (10 October 1949) by dedicating to him its October number (English Studies, vol. xxx, no. 5. Liideke Anniversary Number. Amsterdam. 1949), in which Continental, English and American scholars have joined to pay him tribute in a series of articles which range from the Proverbs of Alfred, through Shakespeare and Johnson, to Herman Melville and T. S. Eliot. As an American citizen of German descent professing English in a Swiss university, Professor Liideke has unique opportunities and responsibilities; a charming prefatory note to this volume testifies to how well he has fulfilled them. The Modern Language Review joins with English Studies 'in wishing him many more years of fruitful activity'. LONDON C. J. SISSON (Editor) The Year's Work in English Studies (vol. xxvIII. 1947. London: G. Cumberlege, Oxford University Press. 1949. 290 pp. 12s. 6d.) continues that excellent service to scholarship which we owe to the English Association, to Dr F. S. Boas as General Editor, and to a group of authorities in the various fields of English studies. Among the principal works produced in the year under review are further instalments of major works in progress, H. S. Bennett's volume on Chaucer and the Fifteenth Century in the Oxford History of English Literature, vol. viI of Simpson's edition of Ben Jonson, containing the poems and prose, Osgood and Lotspeich's edition of Spenser's Minor Poems, vol. II, in the Johns Hopkins Variorum Spenser, two volumes of reprints in the revived Malone Society series, vol. iv of the de Selincourt-Darbi- shire edition of Wordsworth's Poetical Works, and Part XI of Craigie's Dictionary of the Older Scottish Tongue. The record of work done in the field of the English language is encouraging, not least in place-names in this country and in the United States. Miss Seaton reports (p. 51) a survey of English dialects planned and begun by the Philological Society. A series of articles of importance on Piers Plowman, again, heralds the approach of the long-awaited definitive edition of the poem. Among single works, after Rollins' great two-volume Variorum Edition of Shake- speare's Sonnets, published in 1944 but now first available for mention, T. W. Baldwin's Shakespere's Five-Act Structure takes pride of place as a study on the grand scale of Shakespeare's early plays in the light of Renaissance theories of dramatic form. Alfred Harbage's As They Liked It is a notable piece of Shake- spearian interpretation. And a valuable bibliographical survey of Studies of British Newspapers...to 1800, by K. K. Weed and R. P. Bond, is invaluable to students in that field. As in other recent volumes of this survey, complaint is to be made concerning the numerous inaccuracies in the printing and in the Index. On p. 123 and Index p. 279, A. J. A. Baldock should be A. J. A. Waldock. Under Ekwall, E., for East London read Early London (p. 281). Under Lindsay, J., for Doone and Concept of Space, 228,</page><page sequence="2">read Young and the Concept of Space, 225. On p. 231, 1. 10, opinion should pre- sumably be opium. C. J. SISSON LONDON The first volume of Tulane Studies in English (New Orleans: Tulane University. 1949. v+156 pp. $2.00) has been edited by Professors Meyer, Lumiansky and Fogle, and is offered, to quote the Foreword of Professor R. P. McCutcheon, 'as an earnest of the types of research now being undertaken by members of the Depart- ment and also as an indication of the present range of scholarly interest'. The volume includes five papers. Professor Lumiansky contributes 'A Conjecture Concerning Chaucer's Pardoner', arguing that the Pardoner starts with a subtle scheme for extracting money from the pilgrims, but bungles it by reverting in the end to the methods he uses with his peasant audiences. In 'Venice Preserv'd Reconsidered' Dr Aline Mackenzie discusses the political significance of the play in its contemporary setting, and suggests that it was laid aside for a time when half written and that the Nicky-Nacky scenes result from a later inspiration imperfectly fused with the first. Professor Meyer discusses 'The Early History of The Prelude', bringing fresh evidence to support the view that Wordsworth began the poem at Alfoxden in 1798. Professor Fogle contributes a study of Hawthorne's 'The Artist of the Beautiful', and Dr Max L. Griffin shows how Bryant's care to preserve the distinction between his poetic and his journalistic work had a special bearing upon his friendly relations with the South. We are glad to welcome this new venture. WINIFRED HUSBANDS LONDON E. von Schaubert's Bedeutung und Herkunft von altenglischem 'feormian' und seiner Sippe (Hesperia, Erginzungsreihe: Schriften zur englischen Philologie, 13. G6ttingen: Vandenhoeck and Ruprecht. 1949. 120 pp. 15 DM.) investigates the connexion between the two apparently unrelated meanings of O.E. 'feormian'-'to cleanse' and 'to feed'-and its derivatives. While earlier lexicographers claimed the existence of two distinct verbs, Miss von Schaubert succeeds, with a wealth of textual, linguistic, historical and social detail, in making it probable that the meanings of 'feormian' and its kin can be understood as developments in two main directions from an original concept of 'to remove', first in the sense of 'to put away', 'to polish', 'to cleanse', 'to expiate', 'to bury', secondly and probably contemporaneously with this first development in the sense of 'to remove (polish off) one's food', 'to eat', 'to feed', 'to feast', 'to sustain', 'to give food and shelter', 'to take into one's service'. The demonstration of these developments, amply documented by references to such varied material as O.E. charters, testaments, leechdoms and poetic texts, gains by reference to the curiously similar dialect development of German 'putzen'. While it seems difficult to disagree with Miss von Schaubert's main conclusion of the original identity of the two hitherto separated verbs 'feormian', her study (one of the few detailed and comprehensive semantic explorations of O.E. vocabulary) raises the old and hitherto unresolved problem of whether such a vague and general meaning of' feormian' as 'to remove' is preferable on theoretical grounds as a seman- tically relevant point of departure, compared with a more concrete and restricted meaning. For this reason Miss von Schaubert's very tentative explorations of the Indo-European affiliations of 'feormian', especially in connexion with the ancestor of Latin 'permeare', require further detailed investigation. IJOHN E. NHOSMAN NOTTINGHAM Short Notices 421</page><page sequence="3">422 Short Notices Although the Encomium Emmae Reginae (edited for the Royal Historical Society by Alistair Campbell. Camden Society, Third Series, Vol. LXXII. London. 1949. lxix + 108 pp.) is a source-book of medieval history, no apology is needed for reviewing it in a modern laguage journal. In the light of Mr Campbell's long and painstakingly erudite Introduction and Appendices, the Encomium has its contribution to make to the understanding of the English and Scandinavian literature relating to this complicated period. Furthermore, again largely thanks to Mr Campbell's Intro- duction and linguistic comments, the work provides a valuable medium for the study of medieval Latin, especially as the Encomiast frequently writes in the popular rhymed prose of the period, and is in fact to be rated highly among the writers who affected this style. The text is printed on the left-hand pages and on the right-hand side we have a page by page translation. The latter seems to be a clear and efficient rendering, though no doubts could arise as to the language of the original ('Everything having been thus duly settled, the king lacked nothing except a most noble wife.. '). The rendering of proper names seems to have given the editor some difficulties of principle, and indeed the problem does not admit of a simple solution, since apart from Alfred and Ethelred there are few universally accepted forms of these medieval names. Nevertheless with his Eadweard the Confessor, AEthelred and Knitr, Mr Campbell tends to carry a sort of philological accuracy to excess. Especially is this so with the Scandinavian names; Haraldr Blatonn, for example, is hardly the contemporary nor yet the modern Danish form of the name, and a thirteenth- century Icelandic form strikes one as somewhat irrelevant. One result of this system is that while the Latin (p. 34) plausibly etymologizes Hardocnuto, connecting it with the adjective harde, this correspondence is obscured in the translation: 'For indeed he was called Horthaknutr... and if the etymology of this is investigated in Germanic, one truly discerns his identity and greatness. "Harde", indeed, means "swift " or " strong ".... The book ends with a General Index, an Index to the Text, and a useful Glossary of the rarer or more difficult Latin words. RANDOLPH QTIRK LONDON In their Catalogue 79 (privately printed for William H. Robinson Ltd. 1949. xv + 24 pp.) Messrs Robinson offer for sale Phillipps Manuscript 8336, described in part by P. Meyer, 'Notice et Extraits du MS. 8336 de la Bibliotheque de Sir Thomas Phillipps', Romania, XIII (Paris, 1884). The manuscript contains a variety of minor verse in English, Anglo-Norman and French, the English entirely by William Herbert or Herebert to whom the manuscript once belonged, the Anglo-Norman partly by Nicholas Bozon, an early fourteenth-century Franciscan, as well as, in prose, Bozon's Contes Moralises, for which he is best known, William Twicci's Art de Venerie, an anonymous treatise on falconry, and other pieces of less im- mediate interest in Anglo-Norman, Latin and English. By the courtesy of Messrs Robinson I was permitted to examine the manuscript at my leisure, and was able to confirm that the general integrity of this advertisement was consonant with their reputation. Some leaves of the manuscript have been stained; elsewhere margins have been cut away, but the text is everywhere easily legible. Certainly this text is of considerable interest, since it constitutes a principal authority, as Meyer recognized, for establishing the disputed canon of Bozon's works; the book has also an added collector's interest both in having apparently belonged to a fourteenth-century English poet, however minor, and in containing poems alleged to be in his autograph. For a Latin note ascribes the English poems, principally translations of Latin hymns, to Herebert, adding etiam manu sua</page><page sequence="4">Short Notices 423 scripsit frater Willelmus Herebert. Of this ascription Meyer observed that it 'seems likely enough', although he allowed the possibility that the note itself was transcribed from an older manuscript. For its description of the Anglo-Norman, French and Latin contents the catalogue leans upon Meyer's account, as is proper. Meyer, however, was not concerned with the English contents, most of which come at the end of the manuscript, and dismisses them as des traductions anglaises de plusieurs hymnes. This catalogue is therefore a useful supplement to Meyer's description for English medievalists. Its references for the English poems are to Carleton Brown's Register of Middle English Religious and Didactic Verse; as they occur in the manuscript these poems are the following entries in the same author's more recent Index of Middle English Verse: 1213, 3405, 3872, 2241, 1968, 3700, 1054, 643, 1232, 1235, 600, 3676, 3135, 1742, 1821, 3906, 1903, 2963. There is a discrepancy of 2 between Brown's folio references and those in the catalogue, and there are discrepancies in the transcription of the first lines of 3872, 2241, 1968, 1054, 643, 3676, 3135, 1821, 3906 and 1903. Never- theless, the effort of Messrs Robinson to do justice to their manuscript is to be applauded. Taking it as a whole, their catalogue is decidedly above the average in the quantity and accuracy of the information that it provides.E GEORGE KANE LONDON Shakespeare in Spain is the subject of the Annual Shakespeare Lecture of the British Academy, given by Sir Henry Thomas (from Proceedings of the British Academy. Vol. xxxv. London: G. Cumberlege. 24 pp. 3s. 6d.). The growth of Shakespeare's reputation in Spain appears as an almost incredibly delayed process, delayed by the absence of translations, as distinct from distortions, and by want of knowledge of English in the reading public. 'Shakespeare came to the knowledge of the Spanish public late, imperfectly, indirectly, accidentally' (p. 7). The beginning of a real understanding is attributed to Menendez y Pelayo, late in the nineteenth century, and the hope of an ideal translation of the plays rests, according to Sir Henry Thomas, in Sr. Madariaga today. A full account is given of the mysterious First Folio of Valladolid, and of the well-known Second Folio once possessed by the English College in Madrid and now in the Folger Library. Sr. Astrana Marin was presumably responsible for the erroneous statement that Bellott was 'a barber' (p. 4). ~~~~~~(p.'~ ~4).'~ C. J. SISSON LONDON Peter Hausted's academic comedy Senile Odium, now edited and translated by Laurens J. Mills (Bloomington: Indiana University. 1949. 202 pp. $3.50), was first published in 1633 and was, presumably, acted in Cambridge shortly before that. It is in the familiar vein of humanistic University comedy, resembling most clearly that Italian commedia erudita which provided many of the English academic dramatists with plots; and it is a tolerable specimen of the kind. Editions are always useful; and translations are certainly not to be despised. Mr Mills's version, though far from elegant (and the occasional attempt to insert the current idiom of the streets into his far from idiomatic rendering is sadly mistaken), seems to be accurate and a useful crib. Mr Mills has added a short introductory note and a brief commentary. D. J. GORDON READING</page><page sequence="5">The Change of Crownes, a tragi-comedy by the Honourable Edward Howard, was famous in its day. When it was performed in April 1667 the comic sub-plot offended the King, the company was punished, and the play forbidden. It is now published for the first time in an edition by Dr F. S. Boas from a manuscript prompt-book (London: Geoffrey Cumberlege, for the Royal Society of Literature. 1949. vii + 99 pp. 10s. 6d.), with an introduction discussing this play and Howard's other works, short textual and glossarial notes, and a note on the actors named on the MS. as having taken part in the production. This is not a particularly good play and one shares the editor's surprise that such feeble stuff as the comic minor action of the rustic fool Asiniello and his comments on the Court should have given offence. Indeed the play is more interesting-in the form we have it-as a theatrical prompt-copy than for any other reason. The complicated state of the MS. is described by Dr Boas. Basically it is a prompt-copy prepared by a professional scribe. His text has been further prepared for the stage by other hands. The book-keeper has added a series of directions about properties, music and other details, and also warning indications preparing actors for their cues. There is also a series of place-indications at the head of scenes, and of symbols directing attention to entries. All of these features are not retained in this edition, which is conceived as being 'of literary and dramatic rather than of palaeographic interest'. The spelling and punctuation of the original are kept 'except for the omission of the points after the shorter stage directions and a few other slight changes'. Comparing the facsimile of Folio 9b reproduced here (between pp. 34-5) with the text (p. 35) I find minor errors in 11. 88, 92, 94, 97, 99, 100, 101. J GOR D. J. GORDON READING No English painter has been better served by men of letters than Hogarth. Apart from his contemporaries, amongst those who have contributed to his eulogy and appraisal are Lamb, Coleridge, Hazlitt, Thackeray, Austin Dobson and, more recently, Miss Marjorie Bowen. Mr Robert E. Moore's book, Hogarth's Literary Relationships (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press; London: Geoffrey Cumberlege. 1949. x+202 pp. 21s.), is a study of the influence of Hogarth upon Fielding and Smollett, with some introductory material on the Grub-Street writing which his famous series of prints provoked. All readers of eighteenth-century novels have come across references to Hogarth's prints and are indebted to Hogarth for making vivid the manners and customs of the Human Comedy which the novelists represent. Hogarth and Fielding, wrote Ruskin to his friend Ellis, 'pull so splendidly together, stroke and bow'. Mr Moore's book collects together much of the evidence to illustrate that statement. On matters of art history Mr Moore seems occasionally to have been led a little astray. It is wrong, for example, to disparage Smollett's taste because, in Humphrey Clinker, he highly praised William Taverner, who was, in fact, an interesting pioneer in English landscape-painting in water-colour; and to those familiar with eighteenth-century canons and conventions of taste, there is nothing remarkable in Smollett's preferring Guido Reni to Raphael. But this is a book rather for historians of literature than for historians of art. LONDON TERENCE SPENCER Three lectures, given as the Third Annual Smith College Lecture Series, make up the contents of A Method of Interpreting Literature, by Leo Spitzer (Northampton, Mass.: Smith College. 1949. viii + 149 pp.). These have in common their philological approach, the 'explication de texte' which Professor Spitzer applies to three very Short Notices 424</page><page sequence="6">different subjects. Donne's The Extasie, En Una Noche Escura by St John of the Cross, and the concluding song of Isolde in Wagner's Tristan and Isolde are the texts examined in the first lecture, the aim being to make us clearer as to the contents of these texts and to generalize a little on different types of 'ecstasy'. Donne's poem, I think, is misinterpreted here. Professor Spitzer does not like its conclusion, or the ' Gallic worldly wisdom' of Professor Legouis who interprets such a line as ' Our bodies why doe wee forebeare' in the sense in which everyone interprets it. Professor Spitzer understands 'forebeare' as 'endure', and will not allow that any 'invitation to carnality' enters into the poem. The texts of the second lecture are Voltaire's poem Les Vous et les Tu and a letter of his to Madame Necker. Here we have some acute psychological analysis arising from the 'explication de texte'. The third lecture examines the appeal of an advertisement for Sunkist oranges, for 'meditation is needed in the face of things modern as of things ancient'. Professor Spitzer sums up about this advertisement: '... in the interstices between paradisiac dreams and harsh reality, the gracious and gratuitous flowers of poetry, aware of their own unreality, spring up here and there, offering glimpses of an oasis in the aridity of a modern mechanized and pragmatic world. Thus our advertisement, designed to promote the retail sale of oranges, offers a colorful image of quiet Nature to refresh the city dwellers in their environment of hustle and drabness. GLASGOW J. W. R. PURSER The Relations of Literature and Science: A Selected Bibliography 1930-1949, edited by Fred. A Dudley with the assistance of Norbert Fuerst, Francis R. Johnson, and Hyatt H. Waggoner (Pullman, Washington: Washington State College. 1949. 59 pp. $1.00) is a very useful mimeographed list of books and articles on the relations between literature and science, 'offered', as the Foreword says, 'for the convenience of scholars interested in the literary impact of scientific thought'. It is based on the work of a Committee whose contributions have been consolidated by the Editor and his associates, and while not attempting to include the 'background' of literature- and-science studies- the history and philosophy of science proper-which is covered by the regular bibliographies appearing in Isis, it seems to cover its own particular field with some approximation to completeness. On many of the items there are brief signed comments, mostly explanatory but occasionally critical. The great majority of the works listed are in the English language, and it may safely be inferred that the survey has been much more complete in that field than in others. The publication appears to be a development of a practice organized in 1939 of issuing for limited circulation an annual list of works on the subject. About half the items in these lists have been included, and some additional ones. The material is classified in two parts; Part I contains references to general books on the subject and Part II to works dealing with particular literary figures. All interested in the relations between literature and science, which is a subject by no means over- laboured, will be grateful for this aid to their reading, and the compilers are to be congratulated on making it generally available. HERBERT DINGLE LONDON One cannot but envy a University Press which, in these hard times, has the where- withal to publish so lavishly a work of such slender merit as ' L'Histoire de Messire Guido de Plaisance et de Fleurie sa femme' and its antecedents, by Janet M. Ferrier (Publications of the Faculty of Arts of the University of Manchester, No. 2. Manchester: University Press. 1949. 53 pp.). Was it worth while taking all this Short Notices 425</page><page sequence="7">trouble to prove that an author who 'shows himself exceptionally lacking in ingenuity and subtlety' (or his versified original) retails according to the tastes and fashions of his day a spicy story well told by Boccaccio? If so, it might also have been worth while correcting the errors and/or misprints in Latin, Italian and German which besmirch these handsome pages: there are no less than fourteen from p. 8-25.. J. OUR EDINBURGH In Toponimia menor en el Alto Aragon (Zaragoza: Consejo superior de investi- gaciones cientificas. 1949. 42 pp.) Professor Elcock, reverting to the haunts of his youth, lists a great number of minor place-names, of fields, springs, bridges, etc., collected during his exploration of the Upper Aragonese dialects. The lists are preceded by a short study of the most salient phonological features exemplified in these essentially conservative names (the reduction of diphthongs and the develop- ment of -ts to [-0] are of particular interest), the lexicographical material being reserved for future exposition. Even thus restricted the 'opuscolo' is a welcome addition to the author's well-known doctorate thesis, De quelques affinites phonetiques entre l'aragonais et le bearnais (Paris, 1938).. O J. ORR EDINBURGH In the second edition of his Goethe on Nature and on Science (Cambridge: University Press. 1949. 54 pp. 2s. 6d.) Sir Charles Sherrington has revised and expanded the text of his Philip Maurice Deneke lecture of 1942. His conclusions remain unchanged: 'Goethe, though devoted to science, had not the scientific temperament.' 'Were it not for Goethe's poetry, we should no longer trouble about his science.' He sums up Goethe's scientific discoveries as follows: 'That light is not resoluble into coloured lights! an error reiterated to his life's end. That the tree is a collection of modified leaves; that the skull is an adapted piece of back-bone-two plausible though superficial conjectures, now, in the fuller light of the cell theory and embryology, set aside; the "correlation of parts", a clumsy error he misthought a "law".' Nor can Sir Charles share Goethe's emotional attitude to nature. "'Mit allen treibt sie ein freundliches Spiel"-the words seem laden with irony' when we think of subhuman nature, 'the ferret gnawing the earthed rabbit', 'the fever-fit of ague, the growing cancer'. The point is fully amplified by Sir Charles in his Gifford lectures: Man on His Nature, in the chapter 'Conflict with Nature'. It is useful to be reminded in good set terms by so high an authority that, for a scientist in the modern sense, Goethe seems to take a mythical and sentimental view of nature, 'shot through with anthropomorphism'. Goethe might have retorted perhaps, as some modern philosophers do to our scientists: 'Der Mensch begreift niemals, wie anthropomorphisch er ist.' Is it completely true to say, Goethe might have asked, that 'measurement is the beginning of human knowledge'? Or if it is conceded that scientific knowledge began in that way, is this the only valid kind of knowledge ? Philosophers like Whitehead and Collingwood say that the scientific method, of abstracting from the fullness of what nature offers us simply that which can be measured and weighed, though it has led to causal understanding and 'control' of nature, with all its immense, and now terrifying, practical conse- quences, has omitted the qualities, the values, essential to poetry and religion. We need other writers than Sir Charles, and there is no lack of them, to remind us that Goethe and German Idealism were protesting in their day in much the same way against the over-abstractness of the Enlightenment, and that Goethe's view 426 Short Notices</page><page sequence="8">Short Notices of nature is still immensely suggestive just because it is imaginative, a product of the whole man and not of the 'understanding' alone. It would be wrong to suggest, however, that Goethe's view of nature was merely romantic. The disciplinary effect of his 'conversations with things' on his whole mature philosophy is another topic to which it was in any case impossible for Sir Charles to do justice in his brief, but in its own way invaluable contribution to Goethe-scholarship. W. B- FOR EDINBURGH The Volks-Goethe established itself long ago as a fully representative and scholarly text. Its reappearance is welcome (Goethes Werke. Im Auftrag der Goethe-Gesell- schaft herausgegeben. Wiesbaden: Insel. 1949. Vols. I and II. xxxv+667 and 714 pp. DM. 7.50 each vol.) It has of course changed since it made its first bow in 1909. The new price of DM. 45 for the six volumes which are to appear causes melancholy reflexions when,we recall the original M. 6, but is not unreasonable when we bear in mind the expansion that has taken place in the venture. The two volumes received comprise the poems, Faust, and the dramas, along with Schmidt's original intro- duction. Dr Kippenberg's preface tells us that the intention is to stress Goethe as scientist, and accordingly more of the later poems and much material from the scientific writings and literary criticism will be included, as well as the Wanderjahre; the volume of dramas is extended by Die Laune des Verliebten, Die Mitschuldigen, Prometheus, and Satyros. The text has been thoroughly gone over. As compared with the pioneer issue the notes and commentaries have been much expanded. The volumes themselves, as might be expected, are becoming rather large, but no doubt this will be rectified when finer paper is available. They are clearly and pleasantly printed. All the praise that the Volks-Goethe has deservedly won for itself in its forty years of service is due to this suitably timed and happily directed revision. May the press's energy, enterprise, and foresight gain the reward they richly merit. LEEDS A. GILLIES We welcome with great pleasure Professor Hans Heinrich Borcherdt's edition of the first book of the German Romantic Movement (Herzensergiessungen eines kunstliebenden Klosterbruders, by Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder und Ludwig Tieck, edited by Hans Heinrich Borcherdt. Basle: Ernst Reinhardt Verlag. 1949. 142 pp. S.fr. 3.50). We are given a complete reprint of the text together with an extract from Tieck's preface to the Phantasien of 1814. A short commentary on each individual chapter with notes on artists and others mentioned in the text is provided for convenient reference at the end. The work is well printed and pleasant to handle and will be a useful aid to students of German in the reconstruction of German studies in Germany now being undertaken. Professor Borcherdt's notes are clear, up-to-date and to the point. We look forward to the edition of the Phantasien and the comprehensive appreciation of Wackenroder's work which he promises in his preface.. A. GILLIES LEEDS The thought and intention behind Gruss der Insel an Hans Carossa. Dem 15. Dezember 1948 (Wiesbaden: Insel. 255 pp. DM. 9) cannot but be praised, for it is to do homage to a writer and poet who by his few but always fine works and by his modest and unassuming nature has won the respect and admiration of many, both in and out of Germany. But the book itself is a poor thing. Twenty years ago, on the occasion of his fiftieth birthday, the Inselverlag published a Buch des Dankes fiir Hans Carossa. The present work tends to be, in 427</page><page sequence="9">Short Notices its plan, a weak imitation of the earlier book. Of those amongst the original con- tributors who are still alive, practically all, with the notable exception of Ernst Bertram who is still prohibited from publishing anything, have contributed to this 'Festschrift' too. There is this important difference, however: what was written in 1928 consisted largely of a song of praise, more or less spontaneous, of Hans Carossa, whilst the present publication consists chiefly of works, be they poems, essays, or stories, which appear neither to have been especially written for the occasion that they are said to celebrate, nor to have been clearly influenced by Carossa. There are, happily, exceptions here. Albrecht Goes contributes a fine appreciation entitled Zauber der Verwandlung; R. A. Schroder, who himself celebrated his seventieth birthday in the same year as Carossa, provides a poem which links the two together; and Jethro Bithell writes a valuable article on Carossa in England. Bithell is one of two English contributors, the other is B. J. Morse whose article on Osnabriick would seem to have little connexion with Carossa. The inclusion of English voices in this congratulatory volume is in keeping with tradition, for D. H. Lawrence had a contribution in the 1928 book. Lawrence passed through Munich on his way to Italy, where he died shortly afterwards, and in Munich he needed the attention of Carossa the medical man. Rilke too was one of Carossa's patients, and though he was no longer alive a contribution from him appeared in 1928, in the form of a letter dealing with Carossa and Rilke's admiration for him. In the present volume also there is a letter from a great poet, from Hofmannsthal, who had written a short appreciation of Hans Carossa in 1928. But the Hofmannsthal letter published here is about happenings in war-time Austria (it was written in 1917 to Eberhard von Boden- hausen), and seems to have nothing to do with Carossa. It was the desire of Anton Kippenberg, who edits the volume besides being himself a contributor, to include congratulations from outside Germany, and there are contributions from Holland and Sweden as from England. But they are poor and, as is the case with the entire book, the good intention has not produced any worthy results. CLAIR BAIER HULL The third edition (1945) of Mr J. Bithell's German-English and English-German Dictionary had already been adapted for use by the general reader, and in the fourth edition (London: Pitman. 1949. xiv + 1034 pp. 258.) he has rightly changed the title by dropping the word 'Commercial', although he has not sacrificed any of the valuable commerical terminology listed in the third edition. As far as can be seen from a random check of the entries, there have been no major changes in the substance of the main German-English and English-German sections, nor in the German-English Addenda, but twenty-six pages of English-German Addenda have now been included at the end of the book. The new English-German Addenda serve in part to remedy the omission of certain necessary words in the third edition, but there is also a good bulk of recent vocabulary; the selection of new technical and colloquial material has been judiciously made and the merely evanescent carefully avoided. Some of the articles (e.g. Film-) are excellent. The Table of Strong and Irregular Verbs has been moved to a more convenient place at the beginning of the Dictionary. It is pleasing to see that the fourth edition, though enlarged, is five shillings cheaper than was the third. CAM ETREVOR JONES CAMBRIDGE 428</page></plain_text>
