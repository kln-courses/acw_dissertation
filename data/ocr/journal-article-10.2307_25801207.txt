<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of World Prehistory, Vol. 17, No. 3, September 2003 (? 2003) The Italian Neolithic: A Synthesis of Research Caroline Malone1 This paper reviews the distinctive economic and social development of Ne olithic Italy and its islands, from ca. 6000b.c until the emergence of the Copper Age ca. 3500 b.c. Through a synthesis of traditional interpretations and more recent discussions relating to early farming economies, social and technolog ical developments, settlement, and landscape, the complex regional patterns are described. The development of archaeological studies in Italy, the biases in regional and chronological data collection, the regional patterns of cul tures and landscapes, and the emergence of distinctive funerary, artistic and economic activities reveal a wealth of varied and intriguing archaeological information from a wide variety of sources that link parallel developments in the Mediterranean and Europe. KEY WORDS: Neohthic; Italy; Sicily; Sardinia; farming; settlement; Mediterranean; Adriatic. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND Prehistory emerged as an impressive discipline in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in Italy and other areas of the central Mediter ranean. Pioneers, such as Ridola and Quagliati in SE Italy, Orsi in Sicily and Pigorini, Rellini and Patroni in Rome and Colini in the north, represented a remarkably active period of research and publication. Their meticulously published reports enabled Peet (1909) to write a summary of Neolithic and Bronze Age Italy, unequalled until recently. Changing political and intellec tual currents after ca. 1920 eclipsed the progress of this research, and resulted in little revision or discovery until the last three decades.

Peninsular Italian prehistory is regarded as a distinctive subject, considerably (and perhaps mistakenly) detached from neighboring areas of Europe, and also from Protohistoric and Classi cal traditions of scholarship. Regionalism dominates prehistory, explained perhaps by the short national perspective of history since 1860, and the in tensely competitive local identities that still persist throughout the country. This is reflected in the lack of syntheses, textbooks, or a comprehensive ap proach to Italian prehistory. Attempts to draw out regional archaeologies became common in recent decades (Barfield, 1971; Bagolini, 1980; Bernabo Brea, 1957; Guido, 1963; Trump, 1966b; Tusa, 1983). There are signs at last for broader, interregional syntheses (Guidi and Piperno, 1992; Tin6,1996) and greater discussion on themes like colonization, exchange, environment, and dating. This latter especially has quietly revolutionized the fundamen tal understanding of the prehistoric sequence through a recent program of dating (Skeates and Whitehouse, 1994). Absolute calibrated chronology for the region using the new Calib.3.03 program (Stuiver and Reimer, 1993) is quoted throughout as broad date ranges. The systematic application of scien tific analyses for environmental and economic reconstruction is lamentably uneven, and only research in northern Italy demonstrates the consistent application of standard methods. Increasingly, younger scholars from Italy and the Anglo-American traditions are applying theoretical approaches to prehistory, with the adoption of ideas such as gender relations, social dy namics, ideology, identities, and landscape (see, for example, Tykot et ai, 1999). Regional coverage of the Neolithic period in Italy is uneven, and dis covery has resulted from accidental encounters and individual research. In the last two decades, the trend has been totally redirected, and alongside the more familiar reports of chance Neolithic finds there are now excellent sys tematic regional surveys and field projects examining landscapes, cultures, economies, and environments. Indeed by the early 1980s, the quantity of new material available prompted the Istituto Italiana della Preistoria e Protosto ria to devote a conference and two published volumes (see Atti, 1987) to issues and new material on the Neolithic of Italy followed by similar meetings in the north and south (Biagi, 1990; Tin&amp;, 1996). At a gross level, northern Italy has always been closely associated with trends of scholarship in central and western Europe, and has long had investment in museums and research. The same is not true of the south, Sicily and Sardinia, where only recently has systematic research been undertaken, and resources are still scarce in this neglected area of Europe. A bridge from the north to south through the center of the Mediter ranean, Italy, and its islands represent a terrestial link through which</page><page sequence="3">The Italian Neolithic: A Synthesis of Research 237 Neolithic traits were adopted and spread to northern and western Europe. The proximity of peninsular Italy to the Balkans and thus to west Asia and the eastern Mediterranean are factors variously overemphasized or overlooked, depending on different conceptual approaches to diffusion and cultural movement. The bulk of agricultural domesticates and the related technological baggage that accompanied the Italian Neolithic are strongly related, chronologically and culturally, to the southern Balkans and further east. Once the transfer of material and knowledge was established in Italy, the local development of Neolithic culture and economy rapidly became highly individual, and remained that way for most of the succeeding 3-4 millennia. Land and Resources Italy is a land of great topographic contrast, from Alpine peaks in the north, to semiarid Mediterranean plains and hills in the south (Houston, 1964; Mason, 1944,1945; Walker, 1967) (Fig. 1). Over 76% of Italy is up land (41.5% is hilly and 35.5% is mountainous) dominated by the Alps and the Apennines. Sicily is mountainous in the north, with the active volcano, Mount Etna, on the east, and extensive rolling uplands throughout the is land. Sardinia is similarly elevated, its ancient granite rocks rich in minerals. Lowland was of primary importance for Neolithic farmers, and occurs in lim ited coastal strips and river valleys, the Po plain of the north, the Tavoliere in the south east and the Catania plain in Sicily and represents only 23% of the land. Neolithic village sites were typically located on light alluvial terrace soils in the lowland zone. The rugged coasts and hillsides were ex ploited instead for hunted and gathered foods, exploiting caves/rock shelters as temporary, seasonal habitation. Outcrops of hard and colorful rock were quarried for axes in many areas, flint was widely exploited, and obsidian obtained from four offshore Italian islands. Climate The climate of Italy is not typically Mediterranean, but more humid and agriculturally productive than that of typical Mediterranean regions such as north Africa, Spain, or Greece. Italy is more varied, with marked regional contrasts and gradations of climatic extreme, which result from al titude, proximity to the sea, seasonal winds, and air masses. Rainfall in the west of Italy is high (75-125 mm p.a.) but it is as low as 46-70 mm. p.a. in Apulia. The concentration of heavy rain in the autumn and winter months</page><page sequence="4">has major effects on the movement of loose soil, causing rapid terrace for mations, erosion, and alluviation/colluviation deposits. Temperatures vary enormously from warm winters in Sicily and southern Italy, to very cold and snowy conditions in the high Apennines and the Alps. The Po plain has a humid environment that maintains cold winter temperatures. Summers are invariably hot over the entire region. Vegetation Mediterranean forest covered much of Italy until late in the Neolithic, much as it did in Greece (Jameson et al, 1994; Van Andel et al, 1987), rang ing from upland pines to the mixed oak forest in the foothills and plains. Tree clearance throughout the Neolithic and later prehistoric periods is demon strated through rare pollen studies, and by the great numbers of stone axes.</page><page sequence="5">The Italian Neolithic: A Synthesis of Research 239 Where wood is preserved, as in La Marmotta (Lazio) and in northern Italy (Fiav?, Isolino) worked planks, logs and objects provide evidence of fa vored timber types. Little survives of the natural vegetation of Italy present in Neolithic times. Modern vegetation reflects introduced plants, different aridity, and marked variation between the different altitudinal zones up to 1800 m in central Italy. Clearance, soil erosion, and modern crops conceal the native vegetation, as does the "macchia-garrigue-steppe" which covers much of the denuded, arid uplands of the peninsula. Vegetation reconstruc tion is still undeveloped, and there are few examples of palaeobotanical work south of the Po valley (see Cattani, 1992, for recent summary; Barker, 1995; Drescher-Schneider, 1990; Malone and Stoddart, 1994; Whitehouse, 1968a). Soil Formation Soil formations reflect the parent rock and local ecological history (Houston, 1964, p. 420). There are four main types: podzolic (Brown For est) soils in many areas of the peninsula and derived from a range of parent rocks, organic-rich black earths in central Sicily, iron-rich Terra Rossa soils on limestones, and wet and peaty soils in the Po plain and tectonic lake basins. Prehistoric settlement was sensitive to soil type and workability, and site-catchment studies (Ammerman, 1985; Barker, 1981; Ciaranfi, 1983; Cipolloni Sampb, 1977-82; Delano Smith, 1983; Hunt et aL91990; Jarman and Webley, 1975; Kammermans et aL9 1985; Sargent, 1983, 2001) show a close relationship between soil type, workability, and early settlement. Light, fertile soils were the favored location, and heavy clays, sands, and some of the glacial deposits of the north were avoided. Reliable reconstruction is difficult since little pristine soil or its vegetation cover, survive in the heavily exploited and severely eroded landscapes of much of the region (Barker, 1995, pp. 62-83; Delano Smith, 1979; Malone and Stoddart, 1994, pp. 17-43; Vita Finzi, 1969; Walker, 1967, pp. 68-69,78-80). SETTLEMENT POTENTIAL AND LANDSCAPE EXPLOITATION The coastal plains, river valleys, and basins of Italy were the most im portant zones for Neolithic settlement across the Mediterranean, especially in the earlier Neolithic when sea levels were still much lower than today? perhaps 25 m at 5000 b.c. Not only were such lowlands very extensive, but</page><page sequence="6">240 Malone their rich and humid alluvial floodplain soils, light gravel/sand terraces and easy access to different ecozones provided most of the subsistence needs of early farming communities (Jameson et al, 1994). Local resources in cluded wild fowl, game, fish, and plants which seem to have been vital components of the economy. Primitive farming, in Italy as elsewhere, ini tially seemed to flourish on light alluvial soils and loess. The technology was inadequate for the exploitation of heavy or wet land, and there was virtually no settlement beyond seasonal camps, over 300-400 m.a.s.1. in the early Neolithic (seventh-sixth millennia b.c) in the central Mediter ranean. Plains like the Tavoliere and Catania Plain had light soils and wa ter supplies offering a combination of ecozones and local resources capa ble of supporting dense farming communities. By the late-sixth-early-fifth millennia b.c, settlement expanded from lowlands to interfluves and high terraces, low hills and the protected inland tectonic lake basins and river valleys. Soil erosion, colluviation, modern cultivation, and drainage zones hin der the location of early sites, and, while surface indications are not un common, stratigraphic preservation is rare. Well-preserved examples in clude the sand dune covered settlements of Acconia in western Calabria (Ammerman et al 1978a; Ammerman and Schaffer, 1981), the waterlogged sites of La Marmotta in Lazio (Fugazzola Delpino et al, 1993), and Isolino in Lombardy (Bagolini and Biagi, 1987a) (Fig. 2). Ditched villages in the Tavoliere, the Murge limestone of southern Apulia/Basilicata, and SE Sicily are not typical of the amorphous settlements of most of Italy, which con sist of occasional ditched and postbuilt structures and ephemeral spreads of surface material. On the Po plain, lakeside settlements of wooden struc tures and gullies are commonly found in Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna. Throughout the Neolithic, caves and rock shelters were used for seasonal settlement, burial, and cult, and are often the only surviving signs of upland exploitation. Uplands were extensions of the economic territory of lowland Neolithic communities, exploited for supplementary resources such as gathered and hunted seasonal foods, mineral resources (flint, chert, igneous, and metamorphic rock), grazing, timber and arboreal products. Islands The islands provide contrasts in cultural development, settlement, and exploitation patterns to those of mainland Italy. Their location in relation to the mainland, other islands, natural maritime routes, and diversity of lo cal resources, all influenced island developments. Sicily and Sardinia, the</page><page sequence="7">The Italian Neolithic: A Synthesis of Research 241 Trento Alto &gt;--- &gt; -" Ac Adige-; ) ?: Aosto \ - ' \~ FriulK [} LombardyV Venet^ r Piedmont (&gt;y Fig. 2. Regions of Italy referred to in the text. largest islands in the Mediterranean (each covering over 25,000 km2) have great diversity of landscapes and natural resources, which offered poten tial for independent development. The smaller islands, such as the Aeolians, had few resources and were never fully independent of developments on the larger landmasses. Malta was isolated and lacked exploitable resources, so it, conversely, may have become progressively isolated, or at least introverted, in the later Neolithic, developing a unique culture in the third-fourth mil lennia b.c (Malone, 1998). Important resources such as obsidian on Lipari</page><page sequence="8">242 MaJone and Sardinia provided a particular focus for maritime activity, and kept these islands closely linked to the mainland. Islands have long been seen as useful laboratories of culture change in prehistory (Evans, 1973,1977), since they can be viewed as microcosms of larger cultural units. However, as illustrated by discussion later, the islands of the central Mediterranean were also highly individual, and show much diversity of development. CHRONOLOGY AND THE EARLIEST NEOLITHIC The replacement or acculturation of Mesolithic hunter-gatherer subsis tence systems by food producing communities extended over 2 millennia, from before 6000 b.c in the south to perhaps 4000 b.c in remote moun tain areas of Northern Italy. Radiocarbon dates, environmental and eco nomic data, are the main evidence for the economic changes, not the indi rect indicators of pottery and artefacts, which may have been introduced into hunter-gatherer groups as gifts from farming groups (Lewthwaite, 1981; Pluciennick, 1997). The "Neolithic" covers several broad phases with much regional variation, and is traditionally broken into early or primary phases, middle or secondary, and late or final Neolithic. The criteria for these are poorly specified, and mostly based on changing pottery styles, rather than absolute chronologies, which also have considerable regional variation. The lack of dates means that there are few controlled sequences, and it is diffi cult to assess the rate of change in the regions. This is especially the case for the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition, where few (normally cave) sequences provide a consecutive dated record of occupation and economic change. Indeed, so few are the dates demonstrating continuity, than some scholars argue for a complete population and economic break between the Mesolithic and early Neolithic, and this is also suggested for the Balkans. Castelnovian and transitional deposits in caves show the presence of domesticates, sug gesting a transitional economy (Boschin et aL, 2000). Various theories have been proposed to explain this transition, the "Wave of Advance Model" (Ammerman and Cavalli Sforza, 1973, 1979) and the "Moving Frontier Model" (Alexander, 1977) are still quoted, although more recent expla nations call these colonizing models into question. In this review, I have broken the 3000-year sequence into six broad stages. The first is Mesolithic, and the last is the Copper Age, and in many respects, the four Neolithic episodes are schematic attempts to identify gradual changes over time and space. The regional breakdown (Table I) is similarly schematic, and is in tended simply to describe the gross regional patterns, rather than the mul titude of smaller geographic areas and cultural manifestations within them.</page><page sequence="9">The Italian Neolithic: A Synthesis of Research 243 Table L Chronology of the Italian Neolithic (Approximate Age Ranges From 2a Estimations) Phase Date Cultures Late Neolithic?central-Sardinia Late Neolithic-South- Sicily-Malta Middle Neolithic-North Middle Neolithic-Central-Sardinia Middle Neolithic-South-Sicily-Malta Early Neolithic-Northern Italy Early Neolithic-Central Italy Early Neolithic Southern Italy-Sicily-Malta Mesolithic 4300-3600 Chassey-Lagozza 4000-3200?

The first model of "diffusionist" colonization recognizes the physical introduction of Neolithic economic and technological elements: cereals, pottery, domestic animals?especially sheep/goat, and new tradi tions of settlement. Such ideas have a long history from Childe in the 1920s to the "Wave of Advance Model" of the 1970s promoted by Ammerman and Cavalli Sforza, (1973,1979; Thorpe, 1996, pp. 22-25,40-43). The latter model uses 14 C dates from the earliest Neolithic evidence (domesticated plants/animals, etc.), to demonstrate the steady northward and westward movement of these commodities in settled farming sites. The accepted ori gin for domesticates is the Levant and western Asia, and the model assumes</page><page sequence="10">244 Malone that they are introduced into the Mediterranean and western Europe by "farmers" expanding into new and relatively uninhabited zones. The early presence of domesticated elements in South East Italy support the "Wave of Advance Model" and the short distance between Apulia and the South Balkans, via strategically placed Adriatic islands implies direct migration from the Balkans. Many dates from agricultural sites suggest precocious farming communities exploited a specific low-altitude southern landscape from the later seventh millennium b.c. (Delano Smith, 1983; Jones, 1987; Whitehouse, 1968a,b, 1984). Similar ideas combining colonization from cen tral and Balkan Europe with local developments have been proposed for northern Italy (Bagolini, 1980). Recent work on several of the Adriatic is lands of the former Yugoslavia, such as Palagruza and Hvar (Forenbaher et aL, 1993; 1997; Kaiser, 1999) and along the coast of Dalmatia (Chapman et al, 1990) have revealed Neolithic activity in similar coastal and lowland locations. These seem to link the early Italian settlement currently under study at the head of the Adriatic (Pessina etal, 1996). Absolute dating links the early settlement on both sides of the Adriatic suggesting a very rapid and probably simultaneous colonization of the area (Brukner, 1996; Miiller, 1994), which took place between the middle of the sixth and mid-fifth mil lennia b.c. The second model (promoted by Barker, 1981; Dennell, 1983; Tusa, 1994; Whittle, 1996) presents a different scenario, although one which accepts the introduction of exotic agricultural species into the central-west Mediter ranean. Here, the continuity of indigenous Mesolithic groups is maintained through the adoption and intensification of a pastoral-based economy, em ploying seasonal transhumance, and suggests a quasi-Neolithic incipient agri culture. The evidence to support indigenous transformations is in Epipale olithic assemblages, the location of lakeside/wetland camps and settlements, the high proportions of wild game in the settlement debris, and in the case of Uzzo Cave, a gradual intensification of economic exploitation. Mesolithic Legacy and the Transition to Agriculture The "settlement" of the final Mesolithic in Italy and Sicily is charac terized by numerous caves, rockshelters, and open camps distributed from the coasts to the Alpine foothills (Figs. 3 and 4). Sometimes excavation has demonstrated the emerging complexity of these communities, with orga nized cave sites like Riparo Tagliente (Verona) (Bartolomei etal, 1982). Sea sonal exploitation of uplands for brief summer expeditions is demonstrated at high-altitude open sites, especially in the Atlantic period (mid-seventh to mid-sixth millennia b.c) at sites like Larghetto del Crestoso (Baroni and</page><page sequence="11">I-?-1 ? _ 4 .

Map of northern and central Italy showing sites mentioned in the text. Biagi, 1997). Some caves and shelters in the south and Sicily contain rock art, painted pebbles, decorated bone, and engravings associated with Epigravet tian/Tardenoisian occupation. Despite poor retrieval of economic materials, many sites contain significant signs of economic intensification (or preadap tations as some scholars claim) towards food production such as broad spectrum foraging, small mammal hunting, and an emphasis on marine and lacustrine resources. The Epigravettian seasonal and base-camp sites around the Fucine lake are good examples of seasonal movement, exploiting deer and lake resources (Barker, 1975). Riverine-lacustrine locations were cru cial in the transition to settled, permanent occupation. Many of the earli est "Neolithic" sites took advantage of locations where traditional foraging practices could be used alongside some of the new introductions of farm ing. The Vho and early Vaso Bocca Quadrata (or Square-mouthed pottery) cultures of northern Italy were a local transition in lacustrine environments.</page><page sequence="13">The Italian Neolithic: A Synthesis of Research 247 Similar lake and riverside locations were selected for primary Neolithic oc cupation by apparent Mesolithic groups , as shown by examples in Umbria (S. Marco, Gubbio), Tuscany (Petriolo III), Lazio (La Marmotta, Anguil lara), and Apulia (Coppa Nevigata). Such locations further emphasize the importance of the classic "Mesolithic" resource base of hunted mammals, fish, fowl, and collected plant foods within the Mediterranean zone. How ever, alongside the Mesolithic-Neolithic occupants of Coppa Nevigata, con temporary Neolithic groups on the Tavoliere chose locations specifically to take advantage of agricultural opportunities. Lewthwaite (1986, 1989) has argued that the climatic and vegetation climax of the Atlantic period (7000-5000 b.c) provided a short but crucial episode in the Mediterranean, during which new zones, including offshore is lands were rich in exploitable food resources. The arboreal and animal foods available to Mesolithic communities were varied and abundant, resulting in population expansion. Lewthwaite (1989) emphasizes the importance of the ecological diversity of the Mediterranean, and advocates a model promoting diversity in the adaptations to Neolithic economic and cultural manifesta tions. He suggests that some islands (his "Filter model" for Corsica and Sardinia) adopted different animals, cereals, and pottery, thus founding the varied economic and cultural responses seen in the region. However, recent studies (see Rowley Conwy, 1997, p. 187) suggest that such specialization, and also the apparent slow adoption of caprine economies suggested for southern France, Spain, and Corsica may not after all be accurate when agricultural economies were rapidly taken up across the Mediterranean. Such rapidity is borne out in the recently excavated sequence at Edera cave in the Trieste Karst of north-east Italy, where economic continuity from mainly wild to mainly caprine-dominated domestic animals is demonstrated from Mesolithic Castelnovian to the early Neolithic (Boschin et al, 2000). There has been debate engaging several scholars on the origin of indigenous west European animals suitable for domestication. For example, Bokonyi's (1988-89) suggestions for local European animal domestication, rather than the introduced domesticated stock from the BalkansAV. Asia (Bos and Sus). However, this seems unlikely in the light of new genetic research which shows that west European wild goat, mouflon, boar, and cattle were not domesticated. Transitional Mesolithic-Neolithic material culture is the focus of recent debate (Martini, 1996; Pluciennik, 1994a). Lithic studies of blade and mi crolithic techniques and typologies still dominate analysis, rather than the quest for reliable economic data, although this emphasis is rapidly changing. The calibrated 14C chronology (Stuiver and Reimer, 1993) enables iden tification of episodes of agricultural expansion, northwards and westwards through the peninsula of Italy. These take place between the earliest southern</page><page sequence="14">248 Malone episode in the late eighth-seventh and the mid-sixth millennia b.c The major islands have their own trajectories, and these are now becoming important studies with improving data and research. On Sardinia, there is growing in terest in the primary settlement of the island, with lively debate on potential Paleolithic and Mesolithic phases of colonization. The Corbeddu cave in central-eastern Sardinia contains supposed Pleistocene human remains and artefacts as early as 20,000 years old, with a likely succession of Mesolithic to early Neolithic elements from the mid-eighth millennium b.c. (Tykot, 1999). Several other sites?mostly coastal, on Corsica and Sardinia?contain Final Gravettian and Sauvetterian assemblages (for example, the Corsican sites of Curracchighju, Monte Leone, Araguina-Sennola, Longone, and Pietracor bara) and subsistence seems to have relied on the indigenous lagomorph, Prolagus sardus, and other small mammals, birds, and marine resources. The isolated nature of the island may have been problematical in maintaining vi able populations, and there is the likelihood of several separate colonizations until the full Neolithic occupation in the sixth-fifth millennia b.c The Uzzo Cave The Uzzo Cave in north-west Sicily represents a contentious Mesolithic/ Neolithic sequence. In spite of problems relating to Mesolithic cave strata with Neolithic talus deposits, the site may represent the transition between Mesolithic economic intensification and agricultural subsistence. This is demonstrated by the remarkable recovery of bones and mollusc shells, from ca. 10,000 to 5500 b.c The five phases identified provide a parallel for the sim ilar sequence from Franchthi Cave in Greece (Cassoli et al, 1987; Piperno et al, 1980a,b; Tagliacozzo, 1993; Tusa, 1985). The Early Mesolithic economy was based on deer, wild pig and fox, several species of bird which made up 30% of the bone total and molluscs. Late Mesolithic (probably ninth-eighth millennia b.c) subsistence relied on mammals (Bos primigenius, wolf and wild cat, large sea mammals) fish and the systematic collection of Patella and Monodonta molluscs. Fishing became the major food source in the Ne olithic aceramic and ceramic phases, with a reduction in sea mammals and hunted animals. As wild mammals declined so the ratio of domestic species (sheep/goat, cattle, and pig) increased. The apparent lack of local progeni tors for sheep and goat (and possibly cattle too) supports the idea that these animals were introduced fully domesticated from outside the region. Selec tive hunting strategies emphasized male culling at 3-5 years old in 60% of the deer, and wild pigs under 2 years old (Tagliacozzo, 1997, p. 242). Ne olithic domestic pigs were substantially smaller and lighter than the wild Sus scrofa, and kill patterns favored young animals under 1 year. Dogs occur, perhaps locally domesticated from wolves. The immediate environment was</page><page sequence="15">The Italian Neolithic: A Synthesis of Research 249 unsuitable for cattle and pig, and they in consequence represent only half the number of the caprines. Sheep/goat kill patterns show animals under 2 years old represented 73%, and no animals survived more than 6 years. The presence in the cave of the large sea mammals is intriguing. Either the animals were caught at sea from boats, which presupposes both navigation skills and marine technology, or butchered on the beaches after the ani mals were washed ashore. Lithic technology seems to be closely related to economic intensification, with new transverse tranchet tools made from mi croburins. New materials such as pottery and obsidian suggest the transition to a fully Neolithic economy and technology. This Neolithic economy sees the complete abandonment of many wild species in the diet at Uzzo, such as cat, deer, fox, and birds, and the introduction of some domestic animals, which included milk production from goats. The plant remains from Uzzo are currently the only significant sam ple of paleoebotanical data from Mesolithic or Neolithic Sicily and are still under study (Costantini, 1989). In the early Neolithic levels, einkorn is most numerous, followed by emmer and barley which are replaced by bread wheat, lentils, vetches and peas, and wild fruits (fig, olive, plum, and grape) in the later levels. Barley and more tender varieties of wheat only ap peared after emmer and einkorn had been established. Lack of systematic research throughout peninsular Italy means there are no parallel sequences for comparison although several Apulian sites may have had similar sub sistence transitions from the Epipaleolithic/Mesolithic to Neolithic. Early economies concentrated on hunting deer, bovids and equids, replaced in the later Mesolithic by deer and boar, and eventually, domestic animals in the early Neolithic. Grotta Marisa (LE) (Tozzi, 1996, pp. 54-55) documents this change, and Grotta della Mura (Bari) documents the faunal change from bovids/equids to deer/boar between the Romanellian and Sauveterrian phases (ca. ninth-seventh millennia b.c.) (Calattini, 1996). Terragne (TA) saw red deer decline from 40% of the fauna to 20%, as domestic animals ap peared in Neolithic levels (Di Lernia, 1996, p. 63). Central Italy represented a frontier zone between the precocious food-producing communities of the south, and the conservative (and successful) hunting groups of the north. In some isolated valleys, hunting and gathering continued long after farming was adopted nearby. Barker's study of Epigravettian-Mesolithic subsistence in the Fucine basin and central Italy documented ibex, boar, deer, cattle, mol luscs, fish, and birds (Barker, 1981). He concluded that the economy and as sociated tool kits represented an orderly exploitation of seasonal resources with appropriate technology in different locations. The Ligurian coast of fered a range of economic niches suitable for the first Neolithic settlers in the area, from Mediterranean coast to the Alpine/Apennine mountains. Interestingly, there is little evidence for a Mesolithic (Castenovian) horizon</page><page sequence="16">250 Malone in the area, and Maggi (Maggi et al, 1997, pp. 637-638) speculates that this may have been one of the attractions for incoming Neolithic pottery-using (Cardial and Impressed ware) groups. Many excavations over more than a century have located important cave sequences that span the earliest Ne olithic and, of these, the work at Arene Candide (Savona) includes recently analyzed faunal, floral, environmental material (Maggi et al, 1997). The large cave was used for penning up caprines alongside humans. The ani mals were used principally for meat, and the age profiles gained (Rowley Conwy, 1997) show all year-round occupation. Importantly, the domestic caprines (and rare domestic cattle) were more important than wild fauna (mainly deer) from the outset of Neolithic activity, and milk production was probably under way from the early Neolithic. In spite of the locally wooded environment, domestic pig was adopted very late in the Neolithic sequence, and instead wild boar was occasionally hunted alongside other fauna. Extensive hunting strategies flourished in the Alps and northern Apen nines and many Mesolithic communities oscillated between valley-lake-side base camps, and upland summer hunting sites as documented by Riparo Tagliente (Verona) and Riparo di Cionstoan (Bolzano). As the climate im proved during the Atlantic period, forest cover expanded into the moun tains reducing the potential grazing for large mammals, with a correspond ing reduction of Castelnovian hunting sites (Broglio and Lanzinger, 1990). Mesolithic sites in north-east Italy are well represented on the Friuli Plain, the Trieste Karst, and the Istrian Coast, where sites such as Grotta Bennusi and Grotta dell'Edera show specialized Castelnovian industries associated with hearths, caves, and open-air camps. Food-procurement strategies changed slowly in northern Italy, although elements of agriculture and Ne olithic technology gradually penetrated from central Europe, France, and the Peninsula during the seventh-sixth millennia b.c The Edera cave in Trieste, Fagnigola in Friuli, and Sammardenchia (Udine) (Ferrari et al, 1992) all demonstrate an increasingly domestic subsistence economy from the earliest traces of Neolithic activity in the area (mid-sixth-mid-fifth mil lennia b.c) (Ferrari et al, 1992, 2001a,b). However, a marginal site such as Grotta Degli Zingari, in the Karst of Trieste (Bon, 1994-95), contains an assemblage divided between domestic (cattle, pig, and sheep-goat) and wild species, including molluscs, young deer, and other medium-sized wild fauna such as martens and wolf exploited perhaps for their skins (Boschin et al, 2000). Inland and upland sites such as Molino di Casarotto for exam ple (ca. 5800 b.g) had an economy based on wild animals (Bagolini et al, 1973; Jarman, 1971), and even later Neolithic sites like Razza di Campegine (Reggio Emilia) maintained an economy based on red deer and pig (Sala, 1976) (see Table II).</page><page sequence="17">The Italian Neolithic: A Synthesis of Research 251 Table n.

NEOLITHIC SETTLEMENT The settlement patterns of Neolithic Italy vary across time and space, with some regions represented by distinctive settlement forms associated with particular "cultures" (Figs. 5-7). Settlement has been neglected in com parison with artefact studies, and most current knowledge is based on discov eries made since the 1940s with the advent of landscape surveys and aerial photography (Barker, 1995; Bradford, 1949,1950; Jones, 1987).

Schematic map showing the distribution of Middle Neolithic ceramic cultures in the central Mediterranean. have rarely been explored as a means of investigating the wider prehistoric world of the Neolithic, perhaps because early settlement was so ephemeral, and survives as artefact scatters and amorphous pits and depressions. Ne olithic sites were scattered throughout lowland, coastal and river valley zones, on terraces and on light well-drained workable soils over Italy and the islands. Southern Italy and Sicily The earliest Neolithic settlement of south east Italy, from the seventh millennium b.c., is still little documented, except in the contemporary caves sequences along the Apulian coast. As settlement expanded (both as caves and open sites) and became established, substantial ditched enclosures typify sites on the Tavoliere plain and in the Bradano and Ofanto valleys. Initially, these may have been terrace settlements, later enclosed by one or more concentric rings of ditches. The low-lying ditched settlement of Rendina 1 (ca. 6218-5650 b.c.) (Cipolloni Sampo, 1977-82), one of the earliest sites</page><page sequence="19">The Italian Neolithic: A Synthesis of Research 253 Fig. 7. Schematic map showing the distribution of Later Neolithic ceramic cultures in the central Mediter yet explored, was found in the Ofanto valley survey. Specific soil types ap pear to have been significant in the choice of Ofanto site locations. In the sixth millennium b.c., brown calcareous and old terrace soils were favored, perhaps for their workability, but by the fifth millennium b.c. larger and denser settlement was clustered on the brown soils and lower alluvia, which in turn became exhausted, and were abandoned by the fourth millennium b.c. Soils, hydrology, prominence, aspect, drainage, and local resources all played a part in not only the choice of location, but in determining the long term success of early settlements on the Tavoliere (Brown, 1990; Cassano and Manfredini, 1983,1987; Delano Smith, 1979,1983; Jarman and Webley, 1975; Sargent, 1983). Ditched sites (Fig. 8) varied from small-sized (less than 1 ha) sites (many of which may be early and abandoned before elaboration) to medium-sized (1-4 ha) and a few very large sites like Passo di Corvo (28 ha) with multiple ditches and outer enclosures. Many ditched enclosure sites contained numerous "C"-shaped ditched compounds, which appear to have formed the boundary of individual domestic units of huts, pens, and storage facilities. Very few have been investigated, but an example from Passo di Corvo (Tine, 1983) revealed a roughly rectangular structure of stone footings and postholes. Similar rectangular forms were found at Ripatetta,</page><page sequence="20">254 Malone 4 Fig. 8. Plans of Neolithic settlements on the Tavoliere (Apulia): (1) La Panetteria, Lucera; (2) Tavernola, Scaramella di San Vito; (3) Marana di Fontanafigura, Cerignola; (4) Passo di Corvo, Amendola. together with a long succession of daub floors (Tozzi et al, 1990); and at Lagnano da Piede (Mallory, 1984-87) the compounds were cobbled around the houses, suggesting specialized working areas. Estimates of population levels on the Tavoliere during the Neolithic suggest large communities, but precise dating and a lack of excavation prevent more than guesses. Jones (1987), drawing parallels with comparable ethnographic societies, suggested that settlements might range from 70 to 350 persons. Brown (1991) argued that if each of the 90 compounds at Passo di Corvo contained a house, then population levels might be 140-330 persons, and Tin&amp; reckoned some con temporary 30-35 households in Passo di Corvo represented a population of about 180. However, Passo di Corvo is exceptional and atypical of the settlement of the area where only 2% can be classified as very large. It was also late, and its development in the late sixth-fifth millennia b.c. coincided with an expansion of settlement beyond the plain to the Matera (or Murge) plateau and the Apennines to the west from ca. 5700 b.c, for example, La Starza (Trump, 1957,1963). The strategically located Materano sites were surrounded with impres sive and semifortified ditches. Classic examples include Serra d'Alto, Mur gia Timone, and Tirleccia (Bernabo Brea, 1987). These sites were occu pied for much longer than Tavoliere settlements, from the sixth to fourth</page><page sequence="21">The Italian Neolithic: A Synthesis of Research 255 millennia b.c, and the locations were reoccupied in later prehistory. Similar, contemporary ditched sites were constructed in south-east Sicily on the edge of the Catania Plain and on coastal and stream terraces around Syracuse. Substantial ditches up to 3 m deep and 4 m wide enclosed substantial areas of settlement. Stentinello had ditches enclosing an area of 250 m in diame ter, and Megara Hyblaea had stone walls built around the inner face of the ditches, encompassing an area 200 x 135 m (Leighton, 1999, pp. 67-70) and traces of slight postholes and domestic refuse. Ognina contained parallel rows of postholes or silos. More typical Neolithic settlements were located on terraces and hill sides, often without ditches or defence, and consisted of slight hut traces, pits, hearths, and artefact scatters. Fusaro (Avella, Campania) extended over about 1000 m2 on a dendritic talus below a cliff (Albore Livadie and Gangemic, 1987), and Leonessa di Melfi on a terrace (Bianco and Cipolloni Sampo, 1987). Defensive walls around Trasano (Basilicata) enclosed huts, hearths, and pits (ca. 6175-5278 b.c) (Guilaine and Cremonesi, 1987,1996); and Capo Alfiere in Calabria (Morter, 1990) included a stone structure 9 x 8 m, perched above the sea on the marine terrace. The Acconia survey lo cated Stentinello culture hamlets and lithic sites in sand dunes scattered along small streams as a continuous spread of occupation (ca. 5970-4404 b.c). Some individual huts were substantial and required over 1000 kg of daub in construction (Schaffer, 1983) (Ammerman, 1985; Ammerman et al, 1978a,b; Ammerman and Bonardi, 1981; Ammerman and Schaffer, 1981). Si cilian early Neolithic settlement extended along the coast and valleys, such as fourth-fifth millennia b.c Serra del Palco, Milena (La Rosa, 1987; Leighton, 1999, pp. 68, 71) which had several dwelling units, the largest (20 x 12 m) incorporating massive apsidal walls. Other structures were cut into the gyp sum bedrock, and included postholes, burnt clay floors, and multiple hearths. Expansion from lowland settlement into the hills is suggested at Piano Vento (ca. 5269-4842 b.c.) (Castellana, 1987), where the settlement included about a dozen stone and daub huts (2.5-3 m in diameter), with fire-hardened clay pebble floors, and a retaining outer wall supported several of the huts. The site continued to be occupied until the fourth millennium b.c. with smaller huts 2.20-2.50 m diameter, and included paved activity areas, stone wall footings, and a shrine with five burnt votive slots and an oblong terracotta idol. Occupation of the smaller offshore islands around Italy began early in the Neolithic. However, small size and limited natural resources meant such islands were usually settled well after mainland areas (Malone, 1999). The Tremiti islands may have represented an early land-fall for colonists from the eastern Adriatic, and several early Impressed Ware sites have been located, including huts. The Lipari Islands were occupied permanently from ca. 5000 b.c. following intermittent exploitation for obsidian from the Mesolithic. The</page><page sequence="22">256 Malone Fig. 9. Lipari Acropolis (photo by C. Malone). obsidian of Lipari provided a natural focus for settlement, and the site of Castellaro Vecchio, close to the outcrops, was an early camp and knapping floor (Bernabo Brea and Cavalier, 1960, 1968, 1980). By the fifth millen nium b.c. the islands were settled and sites like Rinella on Salina included an oval hut 3 x 2.4 m cut into rock. The continuous sequence of occupation on the Acropolis of Lipari from the middle Neolithic (ca. 5415^1223 b.c) until the present, demonstrates its ideal position guarding a small natural harbor (Fig. 9). Malta and Gozo, lying some 80 km south of Sicily, were relatively remote and inaccessible, but were nevertheless settled around 5000 b.c by groups using a local impressed pottery related to Stentinello. Neolithic set tlement is confirmed from a variety of caves (Ghar Dalam), rock-shelters around the limestone "mesa" tops (Gozo field survey data), ephemeral set tlements of huts with post structures (Tac Cawla on Gozo (National Museum of Malta, personal communication; Trump, personal communication]), and buildings below some of the later temples, as at Skorba (Trump, 1966a). Later Neolithic settlement in the south and Sicily saw the partial aban donment of the Tavoliere, Materano, and south-east Sicilian ditched sites and formerly dense settlement areas. This may have been due on the Tavoliere, to land exhaustion, ground water, and salination. Continued use of some sites is documented by Diana Bellavista burials, such as San Martino on the Materano, and Matrensa in Sicily. Settlement appears to have expanded into</page><page sequence="23">The Italian Neolithic: A Synthesis of Research 257 interfluves, higher terraces, and a much wider landscape than in the earlier Neolithic, documented by extensive spreads of distinctive, durable pottery, and lithic material. Upland exploitation continued, and caves were occu pied, perhaps by shepherds and hunting expeditions, and defensive site loca tions were sometimes used. In the lowlands, the impression is of a landscape packed with farms, hamlets, and small villages. Little settlement of the later Neolithic has been satisfactorily excavated and explored in southern Italy Sicily, and disconnected traces, huts and locations must suffice to describe a period of population and settlement expansion. The Calabrian Acconia Survey and the Stilo Survey (Hodder and Malone, 1985) made important contributions, and showed a steady increase in settlement agglomeration in the later Neolithic focused around the almost industrial reduction of obsid ian from Lipari. In an area of 13.5 km2 on the Acconia sandunes, 13 of the 23 Neolithic sites located were of the final Diana Neolithic, and one or two extended over distances of 2 km, indicating a vast size increase from hamlets to large villages (Ammerman and Andrefsky, 1982). The slopes of Mount Etna saw an expansion of "villages" moving up from the surrounding plain, documented by hut traces and numerous cemeteries. Survey in upland Sicily reveals no sustained occupation above ca. 400 m.a.s.1. until the Copper Age (third-fourth millennia b.c) (Malone and Stoddart, 2000a,b; Malone et al, forthcoming-b). Settlement on the Lipari Islands and Malta also expanded in size in the later Neolithic. The Lipari Acropolis settlement (Fig. 9) covered the hilltop and included huts, hearths, and debris. Nearby, the Contrada di Diana extended over 10 ha had evidence for huts, domestic rubbish, and querns (Bernabo Brea and Cavalier, 1980). Contemporary sites on Salina and the other islands indicate dense and intensive settlement. On Malta, a survey suggests population expansion from Grey and Red Skorba (later Neolithic) period sites. The substantial oval structures at Skorba have been interpreted as a shrine, because of their figurines, lack of access, and very rough rock floors, but they do suggest the form and scale of domestic structures. One hut measured about 8.2 x 5.6 m, the other about 6 x 3 m, both were built against a rough wall extending over 8 m. Other Grey and Red Skorba period structures were traced nearby, although the extent of the settlement could not be determined (Trump, 1966a). Central Italy Neolithic settlement in Central Italy divides between the Adriatic east and the Tyrrhenian west. In the east, farming communities through coloniza tion or acculturation expanded steadily northwards along the Adriatic coast. The west was settled in apparently random episodes from several directions.</page><page sequence="24">258 Malone Cave sites from Calabria to Liguria contain occasional finds of Cardial pot tery and traces of domesticates associated with Mesolithic occupation from ca. 6000 b.c. at Grotta di Monte Venere (Lazio) (Delpino and Fugazzola Delpino, 1987), Praia a Mare in Calabria (Cardini 1970), and Arene Candide in Liguria. Settlement inland was located close to rivers and around lakes from Campania to northern Tuscany, supported by dual economies of hunt ing and farming. Structural evidence for settlement is insubstantial and represented by suggested hut foundations or fondi di canpanne, gullies, postholes, pits, domestic deposits, artefact scatters, and middens. The Adri atic settlement is more regular and substantial, along the almost homoge nous coast and foothill landscape of the Apennines (Skeates, 1994a, 1998). Early Impressed Pottery sites include Villaggio Leopardi (ca. 5730-5249 b.c.) (Cremonesi, 1966) with a sunken domestic structure, oval daub floor and walls, and traces of wheat, barley, and querns. A similar hut at Marchinese included a stone hearth, and Capo d'Aqua at Capestrano (Radmilli, 1977) in cluded several huts and evidence for hunting and traditional Mesolithic stone industries. Further north, numerous huts at Fontanelle di Pescara (Giove Ruggeri, 1978) extended over a terrace. A second (middle Neolithic) episode of settlement is represented at Catignano (Abruzzo) and Monte Maulo (Molise) (dating from the mid-sixth to late-fifth millennia b.c with painted pottery) (Barker, 1995; Radmilli, 1977; Radmilli et al, 1978). Catignano had five semicircular structures, surround ing stone hearths, storage pits, and ovens, contained within rectangular apsed postbuilt huts about 5 x 10 m (Grifoni Cremonesi, 1987). The Molise valley survey has shown that early-mid-Neolithic settlements were often located above strategic rivers commanding agricultural catchments. This pattern of riverine exploitation is seen along the length of central Italy, with uplands taken into the annual territory of coastal communities. The Apennine chain was no barrier to settlement, and internal lake basins were settled early, fol lowing Mesolithic exploitation of these prime habitation areas. The site of San Marco, Gubbio (Malone and Stoddart, 1992,1994), reveals a picture of hamlets located on terraces and colluvial deposits, extending over several kilometers (Figs. 10 and 11). Insubstantial remains of domestic gullies and pits confirm a principally agricultural world by the end of the sixth millen nium b.c at altitudes up to 400 m.a.s.l. At low altitude, a large 650 m2 settle ment extended over terraces surrounding the Pontine Marshes at La Botte at Lago di Sabaudia (Lazio) and Setteville di Guidonia (Lazio) (Anzidei, 1987), covered a 1-ha volcanic tuff outcrop. The much excavated site of Pienza in Tuscany has revealed wattle and daub postbuilt structures with circular heaps of pebbles cemented into clay (Calvi Rezia, 1977, 1980), and Tor Vergata (Tuscany) (Grifoni Cremonesi, 1992, p. 311) utilized clay and drystone walls.

Lago Bracciano (Lazio), where remarkable preservation in the lake muds has exposed wooden posts and associated structures from a long-lived lake settlement (Fuggazzola Delpino etal, 1993,1995). Contemporary (ca. 5200 5000 b.c) with San Marco-Gubbio, Catignano, and Basi (in Corsica) the site's extraordinary organic material substantially expands knowledge of the Ne olithic settlement of western-central Italy. Remote upland cave sites in the Apennines like Grotta dei Piccioni, Bolognano (Abruzzo) (Radmilli et al, 1978), and Monte Cetona (Tuscany) testify the presence of settlement indi rectly, with their cult deposits. Similarly, in western-central Italy, dark sub terranean caves such as Grotta Bella (Guerreschi etal., 1992), Pozzi della Pi ana (Umbria) (Passed, 1970), Grotta Lattaia (Whitehouse, 1992, pp. 27-28) Sarteano, La Romita di Asciano in Tuscany (Peroni, 1962-63), and Grotta</page><page sequence="27">The Italian Neolithic: A Synthesis of Research 261 Patrizi-Sasso Fubara in Lazio (Whitehouse, 1992, p. 30) contain traces of pastoral and hunting activities alongside cult deposits. By the later Neolithic, eastern central Italy had large settlements. The type site of Ripoli (Abruzzo) was divided by an interrupted ditch over 7 m wide and 5 m deep, and extended about 300 x 120 m over a river terrace. Its long history of excavation has achieved the only extensive plan of a later Neolithic settlement in peninsular Italy (Cremonesi, 1965), which in cluded distinct areas for houses and burials. Groups of three to six huts with sunken floors made up a settlement of 50+ structures, some with internal burials (Radmilli, 1977, pp. 302-304). Other Ripoli sites like Fossacesia and S. Maria in Selva have shown that houses varied considerably in size, from 5 to 10 m long, and were divided into individual sections with hearths. En closing ditches were located at Citta S. Angelo, and Pianaccio del Tortoreto extended in a linear form with over 80 hut cavities, measuring 1.2-5 m diame ter, and with floors 0.2-1.0 m below ground level. Some huts were associated with clay pits and cobbled foundations measuring 1.2 x 6 m at Settifonti, and pits hearths and burnt areas were found at Paterno, M. Tinello, and S. Cal listo (Popoli), the latter enclosed in rectangular ditches (Grifoni Cremonesi, 1987). Comparable detail is not yet forthcoming from western-central Italy. The old excavation of Norchia (Umbria) indicated shallow hut foundations and domestic debris. More recent work in Lazio at Casale di Porta Medaglia exposed an oval structure with floors, and associated ditches, and the set tlement at Torre Spaccata had industrial areas for obsidian working asso ciated with trampled floors. Survey implies the number of later Neolithic settlements may have declined, as larger, and sometimes naturally fortified locations were increasingly favored. It is likely that later settlements from the Copper, Bronze, and Iron Ages overlie these later Neolithic settlements, as suggested by Neolithic ditches, huts, and pottery from sites like Pyrgi and Tre Erici. Sardinia The earliest Neolithic in Sardinia came to light during the 1980s and 1990s when some 15 Impressed and Cardial ware sites established that the island had been colonized quite as early as its neighbor, Corsica, in succession to Mesolithic and, indeed, Palaeolithic occupation. Material evidence sug gests links with both the Italian mainland and the Corsican-French Cardial Neolithic from before 6000 b.c. Early Neolithic (ca. 5230-4690 b.c.) occu pation mostly comes from coastal caves (Grotta Verde, Grotta Maimone di Laconi, Filiestru) (Trump et al, 1983), Perfudas nelFAnglona (Tanda, 1982), Cala Corsara di Spargi, and on the Maddalena archipelago at Capo</page><page sequence="28">262 Malone S. Elia (Ferrarese Ceruti, 1984). Open sites have been identified around the lagoon of Cagliari where ideal fishing conditions supported permanent settlement. Sardinia had middle-later Neolithic Bonu Ighinu village settlements (ca. 4934-3518 b.c.) in many different environments, from coastal and inland plains to the uplands, representing both pastoral and agricultural economies. Over 40 settlements are known, many concentrated around the Oristano plain and the M. Arci obsidian outcrops. Some sites have continuous occu pation where marine resources were abundant, as at Cuccuru S'Arriu and Conca Illonis around the lake of Cabra and the coastal site of Puisteris, where huts and graves were buried in later dunes. The late Neolithic Ozieri culture (ca. 4240-3350 b.c) represents a period of settlement expansion (Atzeni, 1987). Well-built settlements of round stone huts, some 6-7 m in diameter had sunken floors, stone walls, and wooden superstructures. Groups of as many as 60 huts have been identified at S. Germiliano, together with pits, ditches, rubbish areas, and hearths (Atzeni, 1962). A village of circular huts was located close to the contemporary early phases of the monument of Monte d'Accoddi (Sassari) (Tinfe, 1992). Although open settlement became important in Sardinia, caves and rock shelters remained important in the pas toral exploitation of the uplands throughout later prehistory. Atzeni links the increase in settlement sizes and overall number to a massive population increase in the fourth-third millennia b.c Northern Italy Settlement patterns in northern Italy have been carefully studied, and now are associated with a mosaic of distinct regional cultures based on a variety of evidence. Research has a long history in the north, and since the 1960s has built up a detailed record through combining traditions of landscape, environmental, artefactual, and economic research. The first recognizable settlements in the north of Italy occurred from the second half of the sixth millennium b.c, with marked regional pat terns developing from the outset (for reviews, see Bagolini, 1987; Bagolini and Biagi, 1987a; Biagi, 1987; Bagolini and Biagi, 1987a,b; Pedrotti, 2001; Bermond Montanari et aL, 2001; Ferrari et ai, 2001a,b). The strong pres ence of Mesolithic Castelnovian communities encouraged continuity of eco nomic practices and dictated the location of settlement, using caves from Liguria to Istria, open lakeside locations around the Po plain and Italian lakes, by mountain streams in the lower Alps and along the Adriatic coast. Continuity is also shown in raw materials, lithic techniques, and Lombardy and the southern Alps were occupied by the Isolino (ca. 4680-3980 b.c)</page><page sequence="29">The Italian Neolithic A Synthesis of Research 263 group which exploited lakeside sites, typically building wooden structures at the water's edge. Macrofossils (wood floors in oblong structures) abound from sites like Isolino at Varese and Pizzo di Bodio associated with cob bled areas and Square-mouthed pottery (VBQ). A rich area for Neolithic settlement in the late-sixth-early-fifth millennia b.c. in northern Italy lies in the southern part of the Fiorano culture area of Emilia-Romagna on the northern terrace fringes of the Apennines. Huge sites at Riolo Terme, Lugo di Romagna (Bagolini and Biagi, 1975; Von Eles Massi et aL9 1987), and Savignano (Bernabd Brea and Steffe, 1990) (ca. 5500-3990 b.c) com prise circular house depressions, postholes and 1-m diameter pits. In south east Romagna, early settlement appears to relate to the Adriatic Impressed Ware cultures, and sites with postholes, hearths, and extensive domestic de posits were found at Imola (quadrangular huts and stake holes) and the ring-ditched Fornace Cappuccini, Faenza. This latter revealed 12 structures in and outside the ditch, many of which contained ceramics and other do mestic debris (Ferrari et al, 2001b). The coastal sites of Miramare at Rimini and Misano Adriatico indicate a thickly forested landscape, with settlement along the water courses. The central Alpine fringes of the northern Po plain provided settlement locations for the Vho culture (ca. 5340-3990 b.c). These were located on terraces and hillslopes, and comprised postbuilt wattle and daub houses with irregular ditches, clay pits, and occupation debris. Invariably sites were located at the topographic junction between the plain/valley terraces and the wooded uplands, thus able to exploit a variety of rich environments. A recently excavated site at Isorella (Brescia) (Perini et aL9 2001) reveals just such a situation, on well-drained (but now much damaged) soils, close to the spring line of a terrace. An oval structure of about 20 m2 was associated with a pit containing agricultural debris. Fagnigola culture sites (ca. 5230-4780 b.c.) of the environmentally varied eastern Alpine and Venezia area were low-lying, and contain sparse struc tural evidence of pits used for grain storage, clay, and rubbish, together with spreads of burnt cobbles. Sammardenchia (Ferrari etal, 2001b) on the high Friuli plain included domestic structures, postholes, and pits over an area of 350 m2. The adoption of Neolithic traits was slower in the eastern-central Po plain and the Alpine zone, where the Gaban culture (ca. 5200-4170 b.c.) emerged, possibly at the interface between indigenous populations and in coming farming communities that merged the Adriatic Impressed ware tra ditions with the Vho and Fiorano styles (Pedrotti, 2001). Named after the eponymous rock shelter, the Gaban culture includes valley-edge or bottom and lakeside settlements such as the ditched La Vela site and more upland Altoatesino locations such as Villandro, where an apsidal house has been identified amongst the settlement remains. Pits and postholes from fragile</page><page sequence="30">264 Malone shelters/tents have been found, although domestic refuse and hearths argue for intense occupation at some sites. Settlement evidence in the middle Neolithic (VBQ - Square-mouthed pottery - ca. 4600-3800 b.c.) demonstrates expansion from the lowland pat tern of the earlier Neolithic into more varied environments, with adaptation to a wider range of economic patterns of exploitation, exploiting both caves and open settlements. On the plain, sites like Chiozza di Scandiano (ca. 4670-4040 b.c.) preserve a chaotic mass of shallow cavities and pits, and in dicate the presence of much larger structures than on earlier Neolithic sites. In the Berici foothills, Molino di Casarotto (ca. 5200-4700 b.c.) typifies lake side settlement, with oval wooden huts built on platforms of stakes driven into the lake mud. The structures show a long succession of use with stone hearths in the center of the houses, surrounded by paved areas (B agolini et al, 1973). Elsewhere, hut forms are less clear, as at La Razza di Campegine with its pits and hollows. Hilltop settlements from the middle Square-mouthed pottery period like Rocca di Rivoli (4300-3600 b.c), had scant ditches and rubbish pits, clay hearths, and dumps of burnt daub (Barfield et al, 1976). La Vela di Trento (ca. 4600-3700 b.c.) was similarly elevated at the head of a valley, and here excavation revealed the settlement's terraces, coherent structures, ditches, alignments of postholes, and cobbled areas, sometimes roughly rectangular in shape (Pedrotti, 1990). The Square-mouthed pottery phase III late Neolithic occupation (ca. 4000-3600 b.c) extended from Emilia to Veneto along the southern fringes of the Alps and plain, and favored de fensive upland settlement locations as well as lowland sites. There are clear influences from neighboring cultures reflected in site location and mate rial culture, including Rossen from central Europe, and Chassey-Lagozza from France/Alps. The isolated locations of some of these later Neolithic settlements suggest less interest in agricultural pursuits and instead a preoc cupation with defence, pastoral economies, and hunting activities. The Lagozza culture (ca. 4000-3300 b.c.) dominated most of the eastern Po Plain area and Liguria, and gradually extended across most of northern Italy. Caves continued in use in Liguria, but open sites were the main settle ments in Emilia and Lombardy. Locations varied from hilly country where sites commanded valley catchments, to "classic" lowland sites on riverbanks and lakesides. Wood platforms were built into river and lakeside, as at the typesite of Lagozza di Besnate. Located in a peat-filled moraine basin, this site consisted of large rectangular wood platforms on piles, and extended over about 100 x 30 m. Whilst wild elements were significant in the Lagozza economy, cereal farming was more important, which raises the question of the large numbers of unsuitable wetland locations for much later Neolithic settlement. Further east in Romagna, later Neolithic settlement develops in parallel with the Adriatic region and settlements around Rimini and Cesena</page><page sequence="31">The Italian Neolithic: A Synthesis of Research 265 were located on terraces or the flanks of hillsides. The Diana-Ripoli set tlement of S. Salvatore had 2-m diameter structures and was spread over a terrace. The regions of Trieste, Friuli, and Venezia Giulia were poorly known until recently, but a program of research has transformed knowledge, reveal ing new sites, sequences, and economic data. ECONOMY AND SUBSISTENCE IN NEOLITHIC ITALY Early economy was not the focus of research in Italy until recent decades when new methods and landscape approaches by palaeoeconomists intro duced more interest in these themes. Recovery methods have rarely been rigorous, and many important data have never been properly collected or analyzed from "classic" Neolithic sites, and the emphasis has been on car bonized seeds and large animal bones, rather than the broader economic environment. Reports, based on small samples, tend still to be at the listing stage rather than the analytical and interpretative. Italian archaeology, al though it had a remarkably early start with the Lake Village excavations in the nineteenth century, still lags behind many other areas of Europe in chart ing Neolithic agricultural transformation and intensification. Barker (1981) identified three basic types of economic exploitation in Neolithic Italy? mixed agriculture, pastoral, and mainly hunting, and these can be identified from zoological-botanical studies on the proportions of wild to domestic animal bones. Southern Italy and Sicily The earliest evidence for cereal farming is from the Tavoliere and SE Italy. Domesticated cereals and animals were probably introduced from the Balkans and incorporated into mixed farming economies. Early settlements were located, as discussed above, to take advantage of a range of soils and environments, enabling cereals and husbandry to flourish alongside tradi tional hunting, fishing, and gathering subsistence. Site catchment analysis has been employed with some effect to demonstrate the catchments of early farming sites (Barker, 1975; Jarman et al, 1982). Many crops were in use, and initially barley may have been more important than emmer wheat, as a more reliable crop in newly cleared land and on the salty coastal soils, al though this is not borne out on the Tavoliere. Emmer, together with einkorn, spelt and later on, bread and durum wheat became the main cereals. Other crops included legumes (lentil) and wild collected fruits such as grape and olive, and other gathered wild foods. Samples from Rendina (barley, bread,</page><page sequence="32">266 Malone and durum wheat), Scamuso, Le Macchie, Ripatetta, La Fontanelle (emmer, einkorn, and barley), and Torre Canne (lentil, wild olive, and grape) provide an indication of the variety of crops grown and collected. By the mid-sixth millennium b.c. the range of cultivated species expanded to include new cereal varieties (durum and spelt wheat, naked and hulled barley, beans (Viciafabia)). Some sites grew just one or two varieties, as at Madonna della Grazie, where the botanical samples contained 95% wheat (predominantly bread/compactum varieties), with 5% naked and hulled barley (Castelletti et al, 1987). The sixth-fifth millennia b.c. coastal economy of Capo Alfiere in Calabria (Morter, 1990) may be typical of the more marginal landscape of the south. One season's work produced almost 400 seeds, of which roughly 7% were emmer and einkorn wheat, 31% was barley, 3% broad bean, 15% pea, and about 14% other legumes. A number of weeds, herbs, and a grape pip were also represented. The later of two phases of occupation showed cereals increased as pulses declined, and sheep/goat and cattle became the dominant species by the end of occupation. The gathered-hunted wild fauna became insignificant in the diet at the site (deer, fish, fox, tortoise, and wild mammals, which had replaced earlier exploitation of birds and tortoise). Sim ilar economic changes may have occurred at the ditched Stentinello villages in eastern Sicily and Calabria, where the impression is of a predominantly domesticated economy (Villari, 1995, pp. 256-257). The importance of wild fauna declined rapidly as pastoral activities based on domestic fauna were adopted in lowland southern Italy. Rendina 1 in the Ofanto valley included 16 wild species which were nevertheless vastly outnumbered by the quantity of domestic fauna (97% of all bones). Caprines dominated the early Neolithic economy in southern and peninsular Italy (be tween 30 and 60% of all bones recovered) declining in the fifth millennium b.c. to 50-30%, as cattle increased to between 20 and 40% of bones recovered (about 30% at Passo di Corvo). Sheep/goat were, nevertheless, the dominant stock on most sites, and this dominance anticipates a comparable emphasis on pastoralism in Copper and Bronze Age economies, when extensive tran shumance strategies producing wool and milk came to dominate the econ omy (Barker, 1981; Puglisi, 1959). The later Neolithic fauna of Lipari imply that sheep/goat greatly outnumbered pig, and this pattern of declining pig exploitation throughout the south may be explained by the removal of forest cover. The rare archaeozoological studies of later Neolithic economies are from nonhabitation caves in Apulia (Grotta Pacelli (Striccoli, 1982,1988), Cala Colombo (de Lucia et al, 1977), and Ipogei Manfredi). Their unusual remains comprise feasting and prestige foods, suggesting a cult use, with an economy dominated by roe and red deer (about 60%) at Ipogei Manfredi, and a significant increase in wild animals from the mid-Neolithic (39%) to the late Neolithic (56%) at Grotta Pacelli.</page><page sequence="33">The Italian Neolithic A Synthesis of Research 267 Greater variety of crops and products were in use by the later Neolithic and deposited in settlement and nonsettlement contexts. At Cala Colombo, the graves contained pistachio with einkorn, wheat (unspec), barley, Lath yrus, lentil, and grape pips, and at Cala Scizzo traces of bread wheat and barley (H. vulgare) were extracted from a hearth in a cave. The evidence is such that it would be misleading to imply a changing economy in southern Italy and Sicily, but at a broad level, there seems to be a shift from small scale mixed farming, towards increasingly specialized economic adaptations in more marginal areas. Central Italy Subsistence in Abruzzo and Marche included various subsistence pat terns. The lowland Villaggio Leopardi was ideally located for mixed farming, exploiting sheep/goat grazing in the valley-bottom and woodland pig browse, and cultivation of emmer and barley grown under low-technology conditions on light, well-drained soils. Catignano was similar in location and economic exploitation, with the addition of nuts and (wild) grape pips showing the sup plementary collected foods at these sites. The economy was principally made up of domestic species, one variety of wheat and two of barley, a legume and wild fruits. Similar Abruzzo sites include Pianaccio, where lowland ridges were cultivated producing a mixed economy of cereals and sheep/goat. The upland caves were the focus of pastoralism (sheep/goat, pig, and a few cat tle) and deer hunting, as at Grotta dei Piccioni and Grotta Sant'Angelo. Economies focused on the Fucine basin were dominated by red deer, fish, and sheep/goat, as at Grotta la Punta. Similar patterns of herding and hunt ing existed in Marche. At the river-valley site of Ripabianca (Broglio and Lollini, 1963; Lollini, 1965), subsistence was dominated by sheep/goat, pig, and cattle, and at the wet and forested location of Maddalene di Muccia, the emphasis was on boar/red deer hunting, and caprine/cattle grazing. By the middle-later Neolithic (fifth-fourth millennia b.c) mixed farming was dom inant showing a steady increase in cattle and pig, and at many sites they out numbered sheep/goat. Later Neolithic economies became more intensive, and the mixed economy of the Santa Maria in Selva (on light well-drained soil) comprised emmer, bread wheat, barley, and mixed a stock of cattle, sheep/goat, and pig in equal numbers, supplemented by hunted red deer and boar. Cattle and pig meat production increased at later Neolithic Ripoli to a quarter each of the total fauna, with sheep/goat, red, and roe deer mak ing up the remainder. The use of bread wheat, emmer, and barley, grown on the heavier valley soils suggests improvements in farming technology, such as crop rotations and more effective cultivation methods?perhaps through harnessing draft animals to ards.</page><page sequence="34">268 Malone In the Apennine zone, the economy of San Marco at Gubbio may be typical of marginal upland zones (the site is located at 433 m.a.s.l. on the edge of a Pleistocene lake-basin). Settlement ditches produced a small but interesting sample, dated ca. 5200-4900 b.c (Malone et al, 1992). Sheep/goat dominated and were kept for meat and secondary products, and cattle, al though not as numerous, were the principal meat source. Kill patterns suggest that some animals were kept for secondary products. Pigs were well suited to the damp broadleaf woodland environment around the site, and were mostly butchered before 30 months. Wild animals represented only 12.5% of the economy, and roe and red deer were the most numerous supplemented by hare/rabbit and birds. The community cultivated several cereals types (em mer and einkorn, hexaploid naked wheat (Trit. sphaerococcum, compactum, and bread wheat), six-rowed hulled, and naked barley), and legumes (pea and Vicia/Lathyrus) which were supplemented by seasonal wilds fruits and nuts (fig, raspberry/blackberry, elderberry, grape, hazelnut, and wild plum). Weeds of cultivation confirmed the agricultural use of the area around the settlement. The contemporary Neolithic site La Marmotta in Lazio (Fugaz zola Delpino et al, 1993) also specialized in sheep/goat, pig, and cattle. Kill patterns were similar to San Marco, and from minimum numbers of 46 in dividuals, show that sheep/goat and pig were slaughtered at maximum meat production, and cattle were bred either for meat or for secondary products (Table III). Two sizes of dog were kept, and wild fauna (duck, deer, polecat, fox, wild cat, boar, otter, hare, hedgehog, fish, and turtle) was hunted in the im mediate area. The floral sample from this unique site casts light on the local environment and the great range of plant foods exploited in the earlier mid-Neolithic in central Italy. Emmer, einkorn, barley, lentils, broadbeans, hazelnut, wild fig and grape, blackberry and strawberry, flax, juniper, poppy, oak, and bracken were dominant (Fugazzola Delpino etal., 1993). The earlier Neolithic site of Pienza (Siena) had three wheat varieties (emmer, einkorn, and bread), barley, and a sheep/goat-dominated mixed stock. Kill patterns suggested that secondary products were a major concern in the animal hus bandry of the site, with many animals kept until fully mature. Typical Neolithic economies in much of central-western Italy com bined wild and domestic animals and upland herding either supplemented or Table HI.

Some sites show a gradual transformation over the Neolithic. For example, the forested upland cave of Grotta Bella di Montecastrilli (Umbria) (Guerreschi et al, 1992) containedred deer (supplemented by roe deer, wild boar, and badger), with domestic cattle in the Sasso Fiorano levels. By the mid-later Neolithic Ripoli phase, domestic pig dominated the economy (about 60%) and red deer declined to 20% (Guerreschi et al, 1992). Grotta Vannaro was sim ilar, changing from early Neolithic boar hunting to a combination of red deer hunting and domestic pig herding in the later Neolithic. Some sites were highly specialized, like Valle Ottara's concentration on sheep/goat and red deer, Podere Casanuovo and Molino S. Antonio, where pig represented 50-60% of the animals consumed, and Neto di Bolasse where sheep/goat represented almost 70% of the total fauna. Later Neolithic sites such as Norchia (Corridi et al, 1993), Grotta Cola II, Torre Spaccata, Podere Casan uovo, Molino S. Antonio, and Neto di Bolasso further supported a livestock pattern where herded and hunted stock were supplemented by mixed agri culture, an economic trend that continued into the Apennine Bronze Age. Sardinia The earliest or pre-Neolithic economy of Sardinia may have depended on hunting the last remaining indigenous "fossil" fauna of the island (e.g. Prolagus sardus) (Sanges, 1987), and scanty evidence from Corbeddu cave suggests such species were still present at the outset of the Neolithic. Early Neolithic subsistence is, however, difficult to assess. Evidence from Cardial and Impressed pottery sites include mixed hunting-gathering-fishing, pas toralism, and farming. Economic data retrieved from the rock shelters of Su Carroppu (Atzeni, 1987) and Filiestru suggest pastoral subsistence, supple mented by hunting, fishing, gathering, and limited cultivation. Sheep and goat were represented at Filiestru, and were either killed at 1-2 years for meat, or used for breeding. Pig and cattle were less frequent, together with wild fox, birds, turtle, and the rabbit-like Prolagus sardus. The subsistence data from Su Carroppu included wild boar and red deer, together with Prolagus sar dus, newly introduced domestic goat and marine molluscs, representing an almost entirely hunted and gathered diet. Filiestru included wheat (einkorn and emmer) and querns, but elsewhere, seeds have not been recovered, and farming has simply been assumed from the presence of querns and grind stones. Grotta del Guano, Oliena (Castaldi, 1987) a slightly later site, was carefully sampled, and besides a rich microfauna, produced bread wheat, naked barley, and pea, suggesting well-established farming. Other sites like the coastal cave at Cala Corsare contained evidence for gathering molluscs</page><page sequence="36">270 Malone (Patella ferunginea) and no food production. By the middle Neolithic, eco nomic intensification and landscape clearance at Grotta Filiestru (Trump et al., 1983) is implied by the increase in sheep/goats and cattle, and a reduc tion in pigs, supplemented by hunted deer, hare, and boar. More intensive typically mid-Neolithic cereal farming (in the form of durum wheat, six rowed barley, lentils, and beans) was present at the cave of Sa Ucca (Loria and Trump, 1978). Later Neolithic (fourth-third millennia) subsistence for Sardinia is lit tle known, with few published studies. The northern Arzachena culture is considered to be pastoral, with dispersed, defended upland sites overlooking grazing land. The increasing use of animal symbols in art (especially bulls heads, horns, and figurines from Ozieri tombs) may signal an increasing preoccupation with cattle and stock animals. Secondary products?cheese especially and potentially wool?were experimented with, and some sites of latest Neolithic?early Copper Age date include boiling vessels, pot stands, and strainers for cheese production in their repertoire of artefacts, although loom weights, and spindle whorls are lacking. The Copper Age Ice Man ca. 3300 b.c. only had skin clothing and not woven wool or linen, suggesting that these materials were only pioneered in the later Italian-Sardinian Copper and Bronze Ages. The elevated location of many Ozieri sites, overlooking fertile alluvial river valleys, has been interpreted as ideal for mixed pas toral agriculture, supplemented by fishing and hunting. The Ozieri levels at Filiestru continue the earlier trend of increasing dependence on cattle and sheep/goat as pig declined still further as wild boar consumption increased. Some specialized settlements concentrated on particular resources. For ex ample, hunted species (boar and deer) were important at Grotta Su Ucca, the village of S. Gemiliano di Sestu exploited 17 varieties of mollusc from the rich salt lake nearby, and at the large fishing village of Su Coddu-Selargius the economy combined fish, molluscs, and some agriculture. The impres sion gained is that the secondary products economy became important? pastoralism, transhumance, exploitation of marginal lands through hunting, and fishing, and this has been the agricultural system of Sardinia until recent times (Atzeni, 1987). Northern Italy Hunted and gathered foods were significant in the earlier Neolithic at most sites in northern Italy, and the impact of agriculture was felt much more gradually than in southern or central Italy. Regional patterns of subsistence developed, exploiting the local environment and resources, which included chamois and wild goat, boar, badger, deer, small mammals, fish, birds, and</page><page sequence="37">The Italian Neolithic: A Synthesis of Research 271 molluscs throughout the Mesolithic. Neolithic communities in Romagna and the Po plain continued to hunt, fish, and gather foods, alongside domestic stock and cereals. Fimon (Veneto) maintained a largely wild economy of 50% deer and 40% wild boar with insignificant numbers of domestic cattle and caprines until the Neolithic was well established. Along the northern fringes of the plain, sixth-fifth millennium b.c sites like Campo Ceresole (near Vho) (Bagolini, 1987c) maintained a typically broad spectrum procured economy of freshwater fish and molluscs, deer, Bos primigenius, boar, chamois, dor mouse, beaver, wolf, turtle, and plants. In the central and western areas of the Po plain and Alpine slopes the communities of the Gaban, Vho, and Square-mouthed pottery cultures similarly specialized in hunted/gathered foods, supplemented increasingly by domestic cattle and sheep/goat. Several sites such as Vh6, Riparo Gaban, La Vela Romagnano, and Mazzocorona had an economy based on wild deer until late in the fifth millennium b.c. when domestic animals and cereals eventually became significant, together with querns and grindstones. The Adige Valley site of Mezzocorona-Borgonuovo (Trento) (Bazzanella et al, 2001) was dominated by red deer hunting in the early Neolithic, together with roe deer, ibex, chamois, domesticates, fox, wild cat, badgers, beavers, and brown bear. In Venezia Giulia and Friuli in NE Italy, woodland products and vegetable foods remained important alongside precocious Neolithic trends transferred from the Balkans. Fagnigola culture sites such as Sammadenchia in Udine (Ferrari et al, 2001a,b) were located on plains, along valleys and morainic foothills, and reveal a mixed farming based on five or six varieties of cereal and pulses, together with stock farming in the mid-sixth millennium b.c. The significant increase in polished stone axes in the full or Middle Ne olithic (later fifth - later fourth millennia b.c) argues for woodland clearance and the development of extensive pastures and fields, and signals economic transformations. Hunting and gathering were replaced by a dual economy of agriculture and pastoralism, except in the remoter areas where fishing and hunting remained important. Reductions in the numbers of deer and wild boar caught (as at Grotta Vannaro) provide a further indication of woodland clearance, although fishing and limited hunting were seasonally important. Mid-later Neolithic sites like Monte Covolo (Veneto) were fully engaged in mixed farming, with high levels of sheep/goat (37%), and about half the economy devoted to pig and cattle. In the Adige, the transition to full agricul ture was complete by the mid-later Neolithic. At sites like La Vela (Bagolini, 1987; Bazzanella, 2001), red and roe deer were the predominant species in the earlier Neolithic, although over a third of the animal bones were from domestic animals they were replaced by increasing proportions of domesti cates in the middle-later Neolithic. For example, the early Square-mouthed pottery levels show 25% were cattle closely followed by caprines at 23%,</page><page sequence="38">272 Malone pigs at 14.5%, and deer at 10.4% of the bones, although this proportion changes slightly in the later Square-mouthed pottery levels to 15%. The move to full agricultural subsistence was not sustained in many areas of the north in the later Neolithic. Isolated upland sites of the later Square-mouthed pottery culture were better suited to hunting and pastoral activities. The expansion of settlement into marginal areas shows economic diversification including extensive food procurement. Lakeside and riverside lowland sites were conversely, more intensively used. At Lagozza sites, there is evidence for fishing, hunting, herding, secondary products, cereal and flax cultivation, and seasonal collecting of nuts and fruits. In general, though, like the contemporary communities of central and southern Italy, economic strategies become less intensive and more diversified in the later Neolithic with greater emphasis on herding and pastoralism. S. Salvatore (Cesena) had large cattle herds and some sheep (Bagolini et al, 1991). Fimon and Rivoli exploited their woodland browse with pig. Everywhere, sheep/goat became increasingly important during the fourth millennium, as ever larger areas of open grassland developed. In comparison with the economic specializations that developed in southern and central Italy, the economy of the north was much more mixed, and by the later Neolithic, no species represented more than about 40% of the total bone fragments (Castelletti et ai, 1987). MATERIAL CULTURE Pottery Traditionally, the cultures of Neolithic Italy have been defined through ceramics, rather than other criteria of economic, environmental, or techno logical distinction. Pottery has been divided into forms and types normally designated Early, Middle, and Late (or first, second, and final), and many styles are considered specific to time and space (Figs. 5-7). Recent absolute dating of associated stratigraphy enables the application of date ranges (Late Mesolithic?eighth-seventh millennia; Early Neolithic?ca. sixth-fifth mil lennia; Middle Neolithic - fifth millennium; Later Neolithic - fifth-fourth millennia b.c.) to material that otherwise has been difficult to date (Skeates and Whitehouse, 1994). Ceramics and, to a lesser extent, lithics provide am ple scope for involved and highly focused debates on the cultural sequence of Neolithic Italy, often without much regard to time scales. This typological research tradition owes much to the Germanic tradition of typology, and to the study methods of Classical material. However, fragmentary pottery is not necessarily the most appropriate material upon which to write the his tory of Neolithic Italy, when many other relevant factors should be included in the overall interpretation.</page><page sequence="39">The Italian Neolithic A Synthesis of Research 273 The adoption of Neolithic traits, and especially pottery, took place haphazardly over some 2 millennia throughout the Italian peninsula, with several different points of entry for exogenous Neolithic introductions. A precocious Cardial Impressed pottery, similar to west Mediterranean ma terial, appears (eighth-seventh millennia b.c.) in the southern and western zones of Italy, Sicily, Corsica, and Liguria (Lewthwaite, 1981,1986; Phillips, 1975; Whitehouse, 1968b, 1969, 1987). The presence of Cardial pottery at early shelters and caves such as Petriolo III (Donahue et al, 1992), Arene Candide (Bernabo Brea, 1946, 1956) and Uzzo (Tagliacozza, 1993; Tusa, 1997) which represent Mesolithic hunter-gatherer sites are typical of an in creasing body of information around the coasts and their hinterlands of the region. In contexts dominated by wild and hunted foods, with microlithic industries, rare sherds of impressed/incised pottery have been found, but without any supporting material or economic evidence for Neolithic com munities. Soon after the initial introduction of impressed pottery, or pos sibly alongside it, painted pottery was rapidly adopted and made through out southern Italy and Sicily. Most sites where thorough investigation has retrieved a representative ceramic sample include coarse wares alongside small quantities of fine paste (figulina) pottery. Following consolidation of pottery production in the south, pottery was adopted gradually through out the peninsula and the north. Absolute dating shows a steady expan sion of pottery use northwards along the Adriatic coast (Skeates, 1994a, pp. 61-72). Various impressed pottery styles developed across the north of Italy, influencing regional styles in central Italy. Finewares may have been transported considerable distances, with traded or imitated southern "types" found in central and northern Italy. The rare programs of systematic thin sectioning of ceramic fabrics in much of Italy leave open the question re garding the movement of finewares. The petrographic work done, for exam ple, by Skeates in central Italy and La Apulia and Mannoni in north west Italy (Knowles and Skeates, 1997; Mannoni, 1999; Skeates, 1992, 1993b) suggests rather local production and use, with little evidence yet for trade over large distances. At Arene Candide in Liguria, the ceramic group iden tified as "IV" by researchers was the only one containing calcarenite, which could have had a wider place of origin than Liguria, thus indicating possible trade. The ceramics of the middle and later Neolithic communities represent an increasingly homogenous cultural mosaic typified by painted and dec orated finewares. The large distribution zones (Figs. 5-7) were interpreted as archaeological "cultures," but increasing interregional exchange of fine pottery or its local imitation must be an equally plausible explanation. In the later and final Neolithic (fourth millennium b.c), greater uniformity in style, technology, burial customs, and exchange systems is apparent throughout</page><page sequence="40">274 Malone Italy. Ceramic styles fall into three distinct areas, the Diana in the south, the Ripoli in the center, and the Lagozza (closely associated with the French Chassey) in the north. Whilst these "cultures" evolved considerably over the half millennium or so of their existence, they maintain geographic co herence. The end of the Neolithic is a contentious issue, but alongside other changes in settlement, burial, and technology, the breakdown of the large ce ramic style zones of the classic later Neolithic cultures was marked. The new Eneolithic or Copper Age activity is represented by new, overtly regional ceramic styles, designs, metal technology, settlement types, extensive eco nomic strategies, exchange systems, and elaborate individual and collective burials. Pottery offers much opportunity to chart temporal change and spatial distribution of early cultures, and this is where it has been ruthlessly used in documenting the Italian Neolithic. However, lack of sufficient excavation of settlement and production sites hinders a deeper understanding of ce ramics and their socioeconomic role. For instance, almost no work has been done on firing methods, raw material sources, techniques of manufacture or decoration, detailed study of styles, or pottery function in Neolithic society. Italian Neolithic pottery offers a confusing picture of scholarship focussed on typology, phasing, subgroups, and the comparison of minutiae, with lit tle reference to site or assemblage. In comparison with much contemporary material from Europe north of the Alps, the pottery is a rich and exciting resource, needing larger samples from secure contexts, dates, and associ ated studies of production and use, to allow more satisfying analysis and interpretation. Ceramic Sequence Ceramics research over a century has produced a mass of typesite names (Figs. 5-7). Here it must suffice to note some of the main trends of ceramic development and the patterns that these form across the Italian landscape. The earliest pottery occurs in south-east Italy from the seventh millennium b.c, and is invariably of Impressed-Cardial style. Debate has focused on whether Impressed ware was introduced to Italy in isolation, as part of the west Mediterranean Cardial horizon, or whether it came with painted pot tery. Whitehouse has argued for both styles occurring together (Whitehouse, 1969) from the evidence of early sites in Apulia. Some sites like Rendina and Coppa Nevigata (dated 7485-5971 b.c) appear to have a "pure" Impressed phase without painted pottery (Cassano etal, 1987; Cipolloni Sampo, 1977 82). Outside south-east Italy, Impressed pottery styles were the first to be in troduced, and in Liguria, Tuscany, Calabria, and western Sicily for instance,</page><page sequence="41">The Italian Neolithic A Synthesis of Research 275 rare pots occur in presumed Mesolithic contexts, in parallel with sites in France, Spain, and the northern Balkans. Lewthwaite (1981) argued for exchange between pottery producing farmers and indigenous Mesolithic groups, but this claim has yet to be demonstrated. From the sixth-fifth millennia b.c, Italian Neolithic pottery is charac terized by regional diversity throughout Italy (Fig. 12). In the south, a mix of painted and unpainted styles, finewares, and coarsewares was character istic. Further north in the peninsula and the Po plain, painted pottery is rare or unknown, and, instead, incised and impressed decoration persisted and, indeed, became highly developed in styles such as the Vaso Bocca Quadrata (Square-mouthed pottery). In the south and Sicily, broad provinces of re gional style develop in the earlier Middle Neolithic, based on impressed and painted pottery. Southeastern Italy included Tavoliere styles such as Guadone and Matera scratched wares, with painted red, or red and white fineware. In Calabria and Sicily the Stentinello style of finely impressed or stamped pottery was dominant and clearly influenced the Ghar Dalam pot tery of early Malta in the sixth-fifth millennia. The Tyrrhenian region was characterized by Cardial pottery, then rather crude impressed wares similar to the material from the Adriatic of central Italy, as seen at San Marco in Umbria or at Santa Maria in Selva in Marche. There may be patterns of continuity concealed within these earlier "style" provinces (Malone, 1985, 1986), since in the middle to later-mid Neolithic, characteristic trichrome painted finewares distinguish the assemblages of many sites. In the south east there was the Scaloria style with geometrically painted drinking cups; in the southwest the Lipari-Capri trichrome with distinctive flame patterns on bowls and jars. In the Adriatic area, the Catignano red-painted style devel oped into the Ripoli trichrome, with its carefully executed geometric designs (Skeates, 1998). In the west, recently discovered examples of brown-painted finewares from La Marmotta, Grotta Venere (Fugazzola Delpino, 1993) and Pozzi della Piana (Passeri, 1970) argue for a Tyrrhenian style. Developing in part from these styles and, continuing alongside the later Ripoli style, was the elaborate final trichrome painted ware of the later-mid Neolithic, the Serra d'Alto. This was in use in southeast Italy, but was also popular in eastern Sicily and Lipari and found scattered at many locations throughout the peninsula and into the Po plain. This style was characterized by very fine yellow paste, painted in exquisite curvilinear-geometric patterns, with finely modeled handles and lugs of animals and bow-forms. Preliminary research suggests that the ware was probably manufactured in a number of "centers" in southern Italy, and was widely distributed from them (see below). The similarity of painted motifs over large geographic areas and their imitation in local styles and pintaderas in the north of Italy supports the notion of exchange from the south (Fig. 13).</page><page sequence="42">276 Malone Fig. 12.

The Ripoli style continued in the center of Italy, but it too was influenced by the trend towards homogenity of style, surface treatment, and form. The Diana pottery (named after the settlement site in Lipari) is especially distinctive with a red-burnished, and sometimes slipped surface, trumpet-shaped lugs, and forms that develop from high-rimmed cups and jars similar to Serra d'Alto shapes, to sharply carinated, bead rimmed cups and bowls. Whilst these are the characteristic elements, across the marginal lands of Italy and Sicily, the style was much reinterpreted, and the main characteristic of shiny red-brown surface and long trumpet lugs persist. The Lagozza style in the north was strongly linked to the Chassey of southern France and the Alps. It shares similar dark burnished surface treatment, incised zig-zags and criss cross patterns, and in particular, parallel vertical lugs known as "Pan-Pipes" and small button lugs around the rims. The forms were carinated bowls, cup, and jars. The latest Neolithic sees these "style zones" gradually disin tegrate and the distinctive ceramics merge into a mass of newly emerging regional styles at the beginning of the Eneolithic or Copper Age, at the end of the fourth - early-third millennia b.c. (Fig. 14). Beyond Ceramic Typology One of the intriguing observations that emerge is that pottery, especially fine pottery, is often value-laden with stylistic indentity which can, if con textual information is also incorporated, carry information about cultural identity, prestige, and status in an alien context. Neolithic ceramics, found far from their original area of manufacture, might well be the result of trade, exchange, or gift-giving. When found in the nondomestic contexts of graves, cult caves, and in association with other exotica, such pots signal a different value. Some Neolithic pottery in Italy does appear to carry particular value, especially the early red-painted ware, the trichrome painted styles, and the Diana. Interestingly, these are southern styles, perhaps technically superior to most ceramic production in central and northern Italy, but also from ar eas rich in other important commodities such as igneous stone and obsidian. Although studies of such associations are still relatively new, the great poten tial for increased understanding of the context and meaning of assemblages is becoming apparent (Malone, 1985,1986; Pluciennick, 1997; Whitehouse, 1992; Skeates, 1998). Like Grooved Ware in the British Isles (see Cleal and McSween, 1999) or Beakers (Clarke, 1976), the fine and painted pottery of Italy could be interpreted as one element of prestigious and symbolic goods,</page><page sequence="45">The Italian Neolithic: A Synthesis of Research 279 Fig. 14.

Exchange studies have explored the importance of ethno graphic examples as a means to explain the circulation of prehistoric goods (Bradley and Edmonds, 1993; Mauss, 1966; Sahlins, 1972, pp. 12-16), where parallels drawn with the Kula and other "primitive" gift exchange systems stimulate discussion of broader social issues. The interpretation of Italian fineware pottery rests, to a large extent, on the contexts of deposition. Initial studies suggest that there was a predominance of nondomestic sites, which included examples of the finewares, together with obsidian, greenstone axes, and other nonutilitarian materials, such as ochre (Malone, 1985). However, when such materials are quantified (a rare exercise on most sites), then the pattern may well be reversed (Grifoni Cremonesi, 1994) and sites and ma terials may not be so simply explained. Flint and Other Stone Sources and Their Exploitation Sourcing studies show great complexity of lithic exploitation and ex change in Neolithic Italy, suggesting the development of extensive inter action networks and significant developments over time (Ammerman and Polglase, 1993,1997; Barfield, 1981,1987; Barfield et al, 1979; Bigazzi et al, 1990; d'Ottaviano, 2001; Leighton and Dixon, 1992a,b; Leighton, 1989; Malone, 1985; Tykot, 1992,1996,1997, 1998; Williams Thorpe et al, 1979). The varied geology of Italy and its surrounding islands offered a plen tiful resource of igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks for chipped and ground stone tools, querns, grindstones, hammers, and building materi als. Some rocks are very restricted in distribution, such as obsidian outcrops (four islands), metal (especially copper) bearing rocks in Tuscany, Sardinia, the Alps, and possibly N. Sicily, and fine-grained attractive igneous/ metamorphic rocks (W. Alps, NE Sicily, Calabria, Campania-Basilicata, Sar dinia). Their exploitation was variously sporadic and intensive, and some types stimulated widespread trade across the islands and the peninsula. Flint and chert were the common chipped stone material throughout the Neolithic, and good sources had been exploited for millennia. However, many areas had locally poor sources of chert/flint and river cobbles, exploited for routine use, supplemented by finer imported material for particular tools. Many assemblages consist of a large proportion of inferior lithic material, often almost indistinguishable from waste, and just a small quantity of finer flint, obsidian, and colored cherts. Superior flint/chert supplies were located in several parts of the Apennines, the Gargano, south east Sicily, and the Alpine foothills. The SE Sicilian Iblei flint had excellent flaking qualities, enabling the production of large blades, often up to 20 cm in length. Tools and</page><page sequence="47">The Italian Neolithic: A Synthesis of Research 281 nodules of distinctive granular grey chert/flint are found throughout Sicily and as far as Malta, over the period ca. 5500-2000 b.c Other Sicilian flint was often highly colored fine-grained material and in some areas, some stone, such as jasper and quartz was also exploited and traded. The fine-grained honey-colored flint of the M. Lessini in the Alps was widely distributed, possibly even as far south as Malta (Barfield, 1990, personal communication) and in the kit of the Otzi the Copper Age Ice Man. Across Italy, Neolithic lithic traditions contained many indigenous el ements (such as the microburin technique, the Campignano tranchet axe, and geometric blades) which continued relatively unchanged from Epipale olithic and Mesolithic times (Palma di Cesnola, 1979). New tools demanded different qualities of flint as well as techniques which simultaneously, no doubt, developed in response to them (Fig. 15). The large nodules available from the Gargano in N. Apulia provided ideal material for the distinctive Campignano technique (Fig. 15:1) of broad bifacial flakes with a steep trans verse cutting edge. Although exploited for this industry from Epipaleolithic times to the Bronze Age, the Campignano Axe was distinctive in the Ne olithic. A very early Gargano mine at Defensola, Vieste, has recently been explored and hints at the scale of Neolithic mining operations. The flint mine had two levels of galleries and interlinked shafts following bands of flint, rather similar to the third millennium b.c Grimes Graves flint mines in Britain. In situ stone lamps, Impressed pottery, antler picks dated to ca. 6074-5480 b.c (Di Lernia et ai, 1990-91,1993) show this site to be the earli est deep flint "mine" in Europe. The Campignano technique was employed on tools (axes and blades) adapted to tree clearance and cultivation, and many axes are associated with the Tavoliere ditched villages. New chemical research is exploring the potential to identify exchange and movement in Gargano lithics (d'Ottaviano, 2001). Indigenous hunter-gatherer lithic traditions remained unbroken in many parts of central Italy, as at the site of Ripabianca di Monterado, with its microburins (Broglio and Lollini, 1963). Similar patterns of Mesolithic con tinuity continued at Neolithic sites like San Marco, Gubbio, and Petriolo III in central Italy and at Fiorano, Romagana, Gaban, Vh6, Fagnigola, and Isolino site in northern Italy. Burins, trapezes, rhomboids, scrapers, piercers, microburins, and blades were adapted to early Neolithic economies that still relied heavily on hunting and fishing. New Neolithic techniques included long, elaborately retouched blade production, arrowheads, and blade indus tries, which gradually replaced the earlier geometric traditions, together with ground and polished knives, axes, and adzes. Leaf-shaped and barbed and tanged arrowheads were common in the Lagozza and Diana cultures. Fine flint was traded over wide areas and specifically fashioned into fine objects for use as grave goods.</page><page sequence="48">282 Malone Fig. 15.

The sources varied in quality, with Lipari and the several sources at Monte Arci Sardinia providing the largest nodules for reduction as well as the largest quantities of raw material. The distribution patterns of the different sources continue to be much analyzed (eg., Cann and Renfrew, 1964; Phillips, 1992; Tykot, 1992,1996,1997,1998; Tykot and Ammerman, 1997; Williams Thorpe et al, 1979) and new conclu sions are emerging. This shows the predominantly coastal nature of earlier Neolithic obsidian distribution networks, the variability of exploitation over time at different sources, the lack of any Mesolithic exploitation, and the varied value of the material in different contexts. The high-quality source at Lipari was extensively exploited from the sixth millennium b.c. and, by the later Neolithic, it came to dominate many chipped stone assemblages of southern Italian and Sicily. The Calabrian Acconia project (Ammerman, 1985) demonstrated the redistribution and reduction process of Lipari obsid ian on individual settlements of middle and later Neolithic date on the west coast of Calabria, close to Lipari. This showed over that 90% of the lithics were obsidian and most of the other flint, chert, and quartz used was also im ported from some distance. At Capo Alfiere further away on the south coast of Calabria, 62% of the chipped stone was Lipari obsidian. Other sources of obsidian from Pantelleria in the Sicilian straits and Palmarola in the Pontine islands in the southern Tyrrhenian sea offered little competition to Liparan obsidian, being of poorer quality and limited quantity. Sourcing studies show that their material was distributed to unexpected and distant quarters, such as the Adriatic or Malta, perhaps beyond the main Lipari-Sardinian exchange networks. Recent analysis (using neutron activation analysis) of the assem blage at Arene Candide in Liguria (Ammerman and Polglase, 1993,1999) shows how, at the "tail of an exchange network," the sources of obsidian changed at the site. Early Neolithic (5800-5300 b.c) obsidian was from the relatively local Sardinia-Palmarola, with over half from Sardinia. This ratio changed to equal representation from the three sources (including Lipari) in the Middle Neolithic (4900-4300 b.c), to a massive increase to 87.5% of the obsidian assemblage in the later Neolithic (4000-3500 b.c.) from the more distant, but superior, Lipari source, and the remaining 12.5% from Sardinia. At the tail of the network, the assemblage was dominated at all stages, by finished and utilized blades, and little evidence for reworking or knapping. Studies of redistribution in Northern Italy (Williams Thorpe etal, 1979) showed how both Sardinian and Liparan obsidian were dispersed, and that expansion coincided with a settlement and population expansion in the</page><page sequence="50">284 Malone later-final Neolithic. Caches of semifinished cores and blades appear to have been gathered at strategic sites in the northern Apennines (such as Pescale) ready for redistribution. As at Arene Candide, it seems that Lipari obsidian by the later Neolithic dominated parts of the Po Valley as well as peninsular Italy and Sicily. Sardinian obsidian traffic was thus constrained and appears, on present evidence to be mostly to zones north and east of Sardinia, rarely penetrating the southern areas already well served by the Lipari source. Tykot (1992,1999) has analyzed the Mont Arci sources, of which three pro duce good obsidian ("SA, SB2, SC"), and has shown how different areas were exploited at different periods, and dispersed to different destinations, for example, type SB2 was the most common in the earlier Neolithic, and SA in southern France/NE Italy in the late Neolithic. These studies are show ing that work on obsidian is still only at the beginning, with much scope for new analysis across the central Mediterranean which will further reveal how, where, and perhaps why this material was so valued and exploited. In ad dition, other studies such as microwear and residue analysis provide other dimensions to obsidian research (e.g. Hurcombe, 1992) revealing specific aspects of function. Hard Rock and Axe Manufacture The development of ground stone technology traditionally defines the Neolithic in many areas, and Italy is no exception, with utilitarian clearance axes and grindstones. Calabria and north east Sicily were particularly important zones for the production of artefacts made from igneous and metamorphic rocks (such as amphibolites, greenstones, diorites, pyroxene granulites, nephrites, fibro lites, eclogites, and schists). These fine-grained rocks were exploited for pol ished axe production and traded over vast distances (Leighton, 1989,1992; Leighton and Dixon, 1992a,b). Areas of the western Sila may have been important extractions areas supplying southern Italy and beyond, although quarry sites are elusive, and river pebbles and boulders may represent the source of much of the material. The only competition was igneous and meta morphic rock from Liguria and the western Alps. Here, considerable pro duction stimulated widespread circulation of polished stone axes, amulets, and rings, extending from Malta (Fig. 15: 16,17) in the south to Britain in the north. Alpine material was obtained and traded to Malta and Gozo as early as 4000 b.c (Malone and Stoddart, 1995; Malone etal., forthcoming-a) as diminutive pendants, axes, and amulets, and not long after that, to Britain (cf. Sweet Track, Somerset). A further artefact made from hard rock is a char acteristic flat decorative ground stone ring, well known from mid-Neolithic</page><page sequence="51">The Italian Neolithic: A Synthesis of Research 285 Sardinia and from several contexts in northern and central Apennine Italy (Tanda, 1977) (Fig. 15: 20). These objects were usually made of greenstone (jadeite, schists, steatite, marble), and were sometimes placed in (mid Ne olithic) cult contexts, caves, and graves, such as Monte d'Accoddi and Grotta Bariles, Ozieri, Arene Candide, and Ripoli. The enduring aesthetic value, together with distance from source to destinations such as Malta, saw a pro cess of continuous reduction of exotic stone material which may explain the small size of items, and which, in their final form, had no utilitarian use (Skeates, 1995). The later Neolithic and the emerging Copper Age communities in the later-fourth-early-third millennia b.c. appear to have made the greatest use of polished stone tools and ornaments, with axes/pendants in secure contexts such as graves. This apparent increase may imply both more clearance and agriculture, and also greater access to exotic materials. Rocks for querns and grindstones included lavas from (M. Vulture, Iblei hills, Etna, Vesuvius, Sardinia, the Aeolian islands and Lazio/Tuscany, local sandstones, and other suitable rock, some of which was traded extensively). Exchange and Trade The exploitation of obsidian from the central Mediterranean islands of Lipari, Palmarola, Sardinia, and Pantelleria during the Neolithic offers an important means for examining production and exchange. Characteriza tion and reduction studies (Ammerman, 1985; Tykot, 1992,1996,1997,1998; Williams Thorpe et al, 1979) hint at the complexity of the exchange systems. The quality of material varied markedly between the sources, the best com ing from Lipari and Sardinia, where large obsidian flows were intensively exploited to supply an extensive exchange network, each source being dis tributed across broad but discrete zones. Lipari dominated southern-central Italy, and Sardinian obsidian was frequent in the north. The inferior obsid ian from Pantelleria and Palmarola had limited, local distributions except to remote places like Malta or the Adriatic seaboard, where finer obsidian failed to circulate. The restricted distribution of hard rock suitable for ground stone tool production promoted the redistribution of polished axes over vast geo graphic areas (Leighton, 1989,1992; Leighton and Dixon, 1990,1992a,b). The almost ubiquitous occurrence of flint and chert meant that, unlike Britain and northern Europe, these materials had quite limited patterns of redistribtion. Fine objects were manufactured in areas of particular good local material, such as the Monte Lessini in northern Italy, or the Campanian flint, and assemblages from these areas often lack imported obsidian or hard exotic rock. Clearly local exchange networks functioned to obtain vital materials</page><page sequence="52">286 Malone lacking in the local environment. As the discussion above suggests, rocks of many types provide a ready indication of the movement of essential utilitar ian and also prestigious and symbolic goods round the Italian peninsula and its islands. Obsidian is the most easily sourced and identified, and its traffic has been actively researched for three decades. The earliest movement of ob sidian is likely to have been in the seventh-eighth millennia b.c. Mesolithic, with evidence from Uzzo cave and Perriere Sottano in Sicily (Aranguren et al, 1996, pp. 36-37) and Arma di Stefano in Liguria. However, frequent obsidian distribution began in the Cardial/Impressed ware Neolithic, evi denced at Arene Candide in Liguria, and at early sites throughout southern Italy, dating from sixth-fifth millennia b.c By the later-mid-Neolithic, the traffic in obsidian from all the west Mediterranean sources became intense, with a peak in the late Neolithic of the late fourth millennium. The study by Williams Thorp et al (1979) charted the growing pace of exchange and trade in northern Italy. This suggested that while there were fewer late Neolithic sites containing obsidian, they contained the bulk of the material (1000+ pieces out of total of about 1200 in the study). Middle Neolithic obsidian trade in the north was dominated by the Lipari source, but this changed to Sardinian obsidian in the later Neolithic. Some of the most intriguing sites of this trade are the Apennine collecting stations/redistribution centers lo cated at the heads of valley passes. Pescale, near Modena, produced some 950 pieces of imported obsidian, specializing in Liparan with some Sardinian obsidian during the mid-later Neolithic. Such sites suggest that traffic was well organized between the source centers in the south and north, controlled perhaps, by middlemen. At the other extreme, obsidian was traded as in large cores to Malta in the mid-later Neolithic from Pantelleria and Lipari. Ex amples from Skorba on Malta suggest a high value was placed on the exotic material, with deliberate placement and ritual consumption in the Neolithic shrine (Trump, 1966a). Other materials, including Spondylus shell, are known from many sites in northern Italy, Sardinia, and the peninsula, and they imply other net works of exchange. The likely source for Spondylus is the southern Adriatic and Aegean. The rare large Triton shells which have been recorded from cult or burial contexts like Arene Candide in Liguria, Grotta dei Piccioni, Bolognano in Abruzzo, and the Brochtorff Circle, Gozo (Malone and Stod dart, 1995; Skeates, 1991b, 1995), may also be exotic. Pigments such as ochre may have been exchanged over some distance, the material not being avail able in all areas. For example, large quantities may have been imported (probably from Sicily) to Neolithic Malta, where at present, no local source has been identified. The rather vague references to "cultural influence" that pervade much of the literature are, nevertheless, important observations on what may</page><page sequence="53">The Italian Neolithic: A Synthesis of Research 287 have been strong interregional contact reflected through material culture. In southern Italy, the early Cardial-type pottery and the decorated pottery of the mid-Neolithic show strong comparison with the Balkans, such as the Danilo style. The same elements appear in northern Italy, where there is no physical boundary between the northern Balkans, the eastern Italian plain and Istria. Elements that have been identified as "Balkan" in north ern Italy include figurines, pintadera clay stamps, and pottery style such as the Vlasca Trieste Neolithic, the Vh6, and Gaban. At Edera cave in Tri este (Biagi and Spataro, 2000) a Balkan rhyton-style vase provides a recent example of these discussions. However, "influences" do not amount to phys ical exchange of imported materials, and only a few materials (for example, fine-painted figulina pottery, obsidian, marine shells, stone objects, ochre) are obviously exotic rather than locally imitated. Fine pottery is the final "exchange" item that I shall discuss, since it is a contentious topic that still needs much research. The production of fineware figulina pottery demanded high-quality clay and a particularly skilled tech nology of production, modelling, painting, and firing that appears to be re stricted to southern Italy and the southern Balkans. However, fragments of the figulina from the early-mid and later Neolithic are found in almost all re gions throughout the peninisula, from Malta to the Alps, excluding only Sar dinia. As argued elsewhere (Malone, 1985,1986; Skeates, 1998; Whitehouse, 1992), there is a significant association of fine, often painted ceramics, ob sidian, and greenstone/polished stone objects in contexts remote from the source of these materials. The interpretation of the context could, in many cases, be described as of cult or religious importance, and often may con tain burials. By the mid- and later Neolithic, networks of exchange of these prestige exotica appear to have had a wide-reaching, common value, and superficially, anyway, link many disparate regions together in exchange and cult activities. Primitive metallurgy existed in Neolithic Italy from the later fourth millennium b.c and a few rare examples of copper objects and slag sug gest experimental beginnings. There is copper slag from the Acropolis of Lipari, from a number of Lagozza sites in northern Italy and from Ozieri sites in Sardinia. The Lagozza sites of Attiggio and Isolino had copper flat axes, and new research (Pearce, personal communication) suggests that the technology may have developed significantly in the final Neolithic. Quarry and mine sites in Liguria (Libiola and Monte Loreto) and potential sources in southern Italy (Skeates, 1993b) demonstrate that Italian metal working began early. Whilst raw material may have been exchanged, as in the Li pari case; raw copper and silver were locally available in northern Italy and Sardinia and were being actively exploited by the end of the fourth millennium b.c.</page><page sequence="54">288 Malone Miscellaneous Crafts Neolithic Italian crafts and their production have been little researched, and pottery and lithics have dominated at the expense of other materi als. Bone tools for craftwork and food preparation (points, needles, pol ishers, spatulae) were present in most Neolithic assemblages. Sometimes bone points had scratched decoration (Ripabianca), and antler was used for hafting polished stone. Bone fish-hooks (Ripoli, Passo di Corvo) pro vide additional evidence for fishing. Objects made from wood and fibres are rarely preserved except in waterlogged conditions (North Italian lakes and marshes, La Marmotta). Examples include bowls, baskets, textiles, hurdles, canoes and paddles, weapons, and tool handles. Rarely preserved are leather quivers and clothing (Groenman-van Waateringe, 1999) although this mate rial must have been the main fabric off clothing until late in the Neolithic or even Copper Age, when wool and linen possibly began to be exploited. (The Ice Man's clothing was only of animal skins and vegetable fibres however.) It seems likely that the spinning and weaving of wool and flax only developed in the final stages of the Neolithic - early Copper Age, as evidenced by the appearance of spindle whorls and loom-weights at sites such as Fossacesia in the Abruzzo. A variety of curious clay objects?spoons, ladles, spouted jars, jugs with strainers, and such-like?appear in the final Neolithic (fine exam ples especially from Cala Colombo?Bari, and Bellavista?Taranto) could hint of the beginnings of the "Secondary Products Revolution" (Sherratt, 1997, chapters 6-8) exploiting perhaps milk from cattle, goats, and sheep in cheese production, or else brews of herbs and more intoxicating liquids as suggested by Whitehouse (1992, p. 74) and Trump (1966b). ART, RITUAL, AND RELIGION Research on the emerging religion and cult activities of Neolithic Italy is still at an early stage. Whilst many researchers over the decades have recognized curious contexts making use of symbolism, natural phenomena, figurines, art, and exotica, little formal study has yet been made for the region as a whole. However, there is plentiful material offering scope for investigating the spiritual and ideological world of Neolithic communities (Whitehouse, 1992). Many caves?Epipaleolithic and later?contain artistic products such as rock art, painted pebbles, spreads of ochre, especially when associated with burials, circles of stones, and other potentially symbolic arrangements. Sites like the Addaura cave in north west Sicily with incised rock art indi cate a rich conceptual world, and this is repeated in many parts of Sicily,</page><page sequence="55">The Italian Neolithic: A Synthesis of Research 289 Calabria, Campania, Liguria, and northern Italy for the final millennia of the Mesolithic (Pluciennik, 1994b). The evident continuity of these tradi tions into the early Neolithic is shown at sites like Grotta della Felci (Capri) (Buchner, 1954) and Arene Candide (where painted pebbles and symbolic objects apparently littered the occupation levels). These traditions contin ued in use at mid-later Neolithic sites like Catignano and Ripoli. Excep tional cave art at the site of Grotta Porto Badisco (Fig. 16) in southern Apu lia (Graziosi, 1980) includes two long subterranean galleries and a shorter one, painted with an intriguing sequence of figurative and decorative images. Dated from the mid-Neolithic, it seems clear the site was a cult center, though for precisely what type of cult is unclear (Whitehouse, 1992). The figurative elements show hunting scenes, often of males, associated with curvilinear maze-like patterns. Some of the patterns bear close resemblance to painted pottery motifs found in Scaloria and Serra d'Alto ceramics, suggesting a repertoire of symbols in use by contemporary communities. A great num ber of caves in Sicily, southern and central Italy, were used for nondomestic purposes, and display evidence of cult, some of them also having painted im ages dating from the Neolithic (Levanzo and north west Sicily). At Grotta Scaloria (Fig. 16) in north Apulia, the dripping water from stalagmites in the lower cave was collected in pots placed beneath them, and pots were also placed around a small pool (Winn and Shimabuku, 1980). Similar evidence may have existed at the Grotta Lattaia in Tuscany. Other natural phenom ena such as volcanic fumerole (Grottas S. Calogero, Sicily, and Latronico, Basilicata), or hot steaming springs (Palike, Sicily) were revered with cult deposits of objects, pottery and burials. At Bolognano, cult activity involved the construction of circles of stone, the burial of infants and children, or parts of them, and the incorporation of animal and bird bones (Bernabei and Gri foni Crfemonesi, 1995-96; Grifoni Cremonesi, 1994; Skeates, 1994b). Ochre was frequently used to cover bones and objects (Malone, 1985; Whitehouse, 1992), and symbolism of various kinds (orientation, location, association, color, animal bones, special objects, and selected human body parts) used to emphasize gender, age, and status in these acts of cult disposal. By the late Neolithic, there is evidence that monumental sites were specifically constructed for cult-religious activities. Outstanding examples are on islands, particularly the stone-built Maltese temples, and the extraor dinary temple platform of Monte d'Accoddi in Sardinia. This latter has un dergone much excavation since the 1950s, and reconstruction work (Tmb and Traveso, 1992) shows that the site was a stepped "pyramid" based on a 36 x 29 m stone-faced, plastered, and painted platform, linked to a 9-m high and 48-m long ramp and steps. The construction is more similar to a ziggurat than to anything known in the western Mediterranean. There were at least two major building phases which covered a late Neolithic fourth millennium</page><page sequence="56">290 Malone Fig. 16.

The platform seems to have been in use from the final Neolithic until the Copper Age Filigosa- and Beaker phases in the later third-early second millennia b.c. The Maltese temples deserve mention too, since they form remarkable late Neolithic ritual constructions such as Ggantija and Hajar Qim dating from</page><page sequence="57">The Italian Neolithic: A Synthesis of Research 291 the fourth millennium b.c (Trump and Cilia, 2002). Based on trefoil floor plans, and incorporating complex facades, entrances, passages, and a series of ritual spaces within the buildings, Maltese temples represent some of the most complex and symbolic structures of prehistory. The close association of the temples with subterranean mortuary hypogea suggests a close link between feasting and daily rituals aboveground and the cult of the dead. The art of prehistoric communities is notoriously difficult to interpret, and perhaps too much emphasis has been placed on figurines, which su perficially appear to offer easy access to the ancient mind (Holmes and Whitehouse, 1998). Recent excavations have discovered baked clay figurines (Fig. 17) at Passo di Corvo, Rendina, Gaban, and Vh6 sites, the plump stone figures of Bonu Ighinu in Sardinia and the terracotta fertility figures from Red Skorba levels in Malta. By the final Neolithic, figurative art reaches an accomplished level, with splendid examples of stone and clay objects in cluding stone figures from Sardinian Ozieri sites, schematic idols from late Neolithic rock cut tombs ca. 4000 b.c (at Arnesano in Apulia), and Zeb bug Malta. These stone idols provided the precursors to the fine terracotta and stone figures of the Maltese Temple Period. Most examples of figura tive art come from contexts (burial sites, cult caves, or domestic shrines) irrefutably ritual in character, where they functioned as attention-focusing devices. Animal art is less well documented, and apart from the rams-head handle-lugs of Serra d'Alto pottery, the animals portrayed at Porto Badisco and the friezes within the Maltese temples seem to be late Neolithic devel opments, associated perhaps with pastoral economies. The rock art of Val Camonica in the central Italian Alps mostly belongs to the second-first mil lennia b.c, but there are scenes and images that have been interpreted as Neolithic (Anati, 1964), which show sun discs, labyrinths, geometric designs, and praying figures. Possibly other images of figures, animals, and activities are also pre-Bronze Age, and if so, they also imply a sophisticated soci ety engaged in a multiplicity of domestic, agricultural, ritual, and hunting activities. Burial and Social Organization The emergence of increasingly formalized burial ritual, cemeteries, and monuments during the Neolithic reveal the importance of ancestors and the disposal of the body to Neolithic communities in Italy. Burials can pro vide considerable insight into the belief systems, gender, status roles, and identities of individuals and groups as well as ritual performance in early societies. The Italian evidence is far from ideal, since too little detail was recorded from many sites, and bones and associations are frequently lacking</page><page sequence="58">292 Malone Fig. 17.

The widespread limestone geology of Italy is rich in caves and shelters, and cave burial was a common practice in Mesolithic Italy. As caves were abandoned for open settlement in the Neolithic, they increasingly became places for ritual and burial activity, a tradition that continued until the early Bronze Age in many areas. Some Mesolithic burials were associated with ochre, grave goods, and mobiliary art from Liguria (Balzi Rossi and Arene Candide caves), northern Italy (Tagliente rock shelter), Calabria (the Romito shelter), and Sicily (Uzzo and San Teodoro caves). Some Mesolithic graves had no grave goods (like</page><page sequence="59">The Italian Neolithic: A Synthesis of Research 293 Vatte di Zambana), but others included bone points for pinning shrouds (Mondeval di Sora, Dolomites) and were decorated with shells, and beads and accompanied by lithics. Uzzo cave in Sicily revealed 12 Mesolithic buri als, mostly crouched or extended in shallow trenches, with sparse and rela tively insignificant gravegoods (Borgognini Tarli et ai, 1985,1993). Early Neolithic Burial Far less ceremony and ritual seemed to accompany the burials of early farming communities than in the Mesolithic, and most skeletal remains from the earlier Neolithic are the casual disposal of bodies on settlement sites. Caves were used, and many cave sites like Filiestru (Sardinia) have pro duced occasional disarticulated human bones within deposits of domestic refuse. Burials were generally associated with living places, and corpses were often placed in the C- ditches of the domestic enclosures and pits of early ditched settlements in south-east Italy. Skeletons were crouched or flexed, frequently without grave goods as at Rendina and Masseria Candelaro. Even well-established farming sites suggest that there was no apparent formal ity in burial practice, and no evidence for demarcated cemeteries or grave goods. Passo di Corvo, the most extensively excavated site in Apulia, pro duced only 16 partial remains of individuals located in two "C" ditches, and four human burials, three being infants (Tine, 1983) which may imply the burial of an extended family over time. Slightly later, the Materano-ditched sites include a number of pit-graves and suggest that simple cemeteries of larger numbers of burials were developing close to settlements. At Tirlec chia, one grave contained two articulated adults, male and female, without grave goods. The Grotta Funeraria at Matera (excavated in the nineteenth century) produced a large number of skeletons, and the apparent cult dis posal of skulls (Bogognini Tarli, 1978). The Stentinello sites of Sicily have been inadequately examined and burials in settlements and their ditches are little known. A small cist grave at Scalona, Calaforno (SE Sicily), contained a crouched burial, and similar slab-built cists have been found elsewhere in Sicily. Mid- and Late Neolithic Burial Mid-Neolithic cave burials sometimes had large numbers of individuals, such as the possible 34 individuals found in the upper chambers of Grotta Scaloria (dated ca. 5770-4850 b.c and possibly earlier) (Tmb and Isetti, 1975-80; Whitehouse, 1992, p. 20; Winn and Shimabuku, 1980) (Fig. 16).</page><page sequence="60">294 Malone The burials (reassessed by Robb) were not associated closely with promi nent grave goods, although fine-painted pottery of bichrome and Scaloria trichrome style, flint, obsidian, and polished stone were found within the burial-disturbed contexts. More formal burial sites, such as the 56 graves from sites such as Azzolini at Molfetta, begin to indicate the role of indi viduals and their grave goods in Middle-Later Neolithic mortuary practice (Mosso, 1910). The Impressed Ware levels at the cult cave, Grotta Latronico in Basilicata, included the burial of a young male and female (Cremonesi, 1978), followed by later Neolithic and Eneolithic burials which were accom panied by pottery, greenstone axes, and obsidian. Not obviously associated large vessels full of grain and fruits?perhaps offerings or food were found within the cave complex (Rellini, 1940). Although comparatively frequent, burials in caves have rarely been reliably excavated or the human remains adequately studied. It is astonishing how poor the data are on a large body of important prehistoric material (Robb, 1994a,b, 1996). Discrete cemeteries, rather than random disposal associated with Neolithic settlement emerged in the middle Neolithic, and with it an emphasis on the individual, the grave structure and grave goods. Few settlements have been systematically inves tigated, so the relationship between cemetery and settlement is rarely clear. At the Abruzzo site of Catignano, scarce human remains (crouched adults and juveniles) were found in pit graves (Radmilli, 1977; Tozzi, 1978). At Ripoli (Abruzzo), the cemetery arrangements and contents reflect the more structured society of the middle Neolithic, with trench graves containing between 2 and 14 crouched individuals each (a total of 46 individuals), ac companied by grave goods of pottery and bone and lithic tools (Fig. 15: 6). In Apulia, small groups of tombs suggest the emergence of formalized burial customs. Serra d'Alto and early Diana pottery was associated with cist, pit, and rock-cut graves placed around or within earlier ditched and open settle ments at La Matinelle, San Martino, Serra d'Alto, and Cala Tramontana in the Tremiti islands. Crouched burials, fine pottery and lithics, ranging from local flint to exotic polished axes and obsidian, make up the typical grave. Sometimes, ochre and rare charms such as wild boars' teeth covered the bod ies. These modest burials, always located near to moderate-sized settlements, set the trend for formal cemeteries in the later Neolithic. For example, the eight individual skeletons from Scoglio del Tonno (Taranto) were distributed between two cist and two ditch graves, which contained between one and three individuals each, accompanied by a large number of pots and lithics (obsidian, flint, stone, bone). They were located within 28.5 m of the settle ment ditch. Nearby, the site of Bellavista numbered 20 pit and cist graves over an area of 19 x 3.5 m, spaced about 2-3 m apart from each other. Al though badly damaged, it was clear that many graves contained the remains of more than one individual. Similar stone lined pit graves and slab-built cists</page><page sequence="61">The Italian Neolithic A Synthesis of Research 295 are known from sites in Calabria (Girifalco) and Lipari (Contrada di Diana, Mercurella, Predio Magna, Piano Conte, and Molino a Vento), containing crouched skeletons and ceramic grave goods. The pattern is repeated on the slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily where sites vary from random scatters of hu man bone to the discrete cemeteries of cist graves at Paterno, Biancavilla, Marmo, and Adrano. Individual graves were also associated with abandoned ditched Stentinello sites at Matrensa and Megara Hyblaea (Orsi, 1900,1921). The structure of tombs varied considerably, and while simple pits, stone lined cists and ditch graves seem to be most common, experiments with artificial caves and hypogea are known. At the site of Arnesano (Taranto) (Fig. 18:3) a single chambered rock cut aforno tomb contained, probably, the remains of a single individual, several pots, lithics, and a carved anthropomorphic idol (see above). This structure anticipates the burial monuments of the Ene olithic and early Bronze Age, where such structures become commonplace throughout the central Mediterranean (Whitehouse, 1972). Likewise, in Sar dinia the Bonu Inghinu culture at Su Cuccuru (Fig. 18:7) anticipates the use of artificial rock cut structures. These tombs were approached by a verti cal shaft leading to a small subterranean chamber, measuring about 2.2 x 1.9 m. One example contained a flexed skeleton with a typical figurine by the head together with pottery and a stone chlorite disc (Atzeni, 1977,1987). The construction of artificial caves or modification of natural caves is well represented at three sites on the Adriatic coast of Apulia, at Cala Colombo (Fig. 18: 5), Cala Scizzo, and Ipogei Manfredi (Fig. 18: 4). Cala Scizzo was a natural cave modified by human activity, and although scoured by sea water, was clearly used for burial from the Middle Neolithic to the Eneolithic. A rough stone enclosure at the back of the cave included two stone stelae, and within were Serra d'Alto and Diana style pots, a terracotta head and painted pebbles (Geniola, 1987; Geniola and Tunzi, 1980). Nearby, the larger natu ral cavities of Cala Colombo were used for burial and other cult activities from the Middle to Later Neolithic. Some 24 individuals, of which 41% were juveniles or infants, were found in two burial levels, associated with fine Serra d'Alto and Diana pottery, flint and obsidian. At Santa Barbara, the artificial cave of Manfredi (cut through an earlier ditched village) contained no human remains, but instead a mass of deer bones (37% roe deer, 21.8% red deer) and mollusc shells. Whilst this site is not a human grave, it exem plifies the complexity of the cave sites, used for burial and cult purposes, and Grottas Pacelli (Striccoli, 1982), dell'Erba, Sant Angelo Ostuni, Sant Angleo III (Cassano Jonico), and Felci on Capri are typical examples. Similar burial and associated cult activity in caves was prevalent in central Italy from early in the Neolithic sequence. Grotta dei Piccioni at Bolognano has a long sequence commencing between ca. 5480 and 4860 b.c. with red-painted and impressed ware deposits associated with habitation</page><page sequence="62">296 Malone Fig. 18.

Later Ripoli Neolithic levels included child burials set within 11 circles of stones at the back of the cave, variously interpreted as sacri fices or shrines. Bones from wild and domestic animals appear to have been carefully selected, together with potsherds and stone and bone tools, to ac company the remains. Some of the wild animal bones (duck, hare, coot) had red-ochre-stained clay at one end, indicating that these deposits may once have been displayed, and there were also red-stained pebbles and a shell trumpet (Radmilli et aL, 1978; Skeates, 1991a,b). The early Impressed ware levels of Grotta Continenza at Trasacco provide evidence for cremation rites, where the burnt remains of an adult was covered with pots, two of which were filled with the remains of two cremated children and eight others with skull fragments, ochre, and flints. Associated with this was a pit to collect dripping cave water, a heap of red ochre, and in the next level above, were further pots, human remains, and ochre. In all some 26 individuals and three cremations were found associated with sheep/goat, dog, and pig remains (Barra et al, 1992). Other caves in central Italy include Grotta Sant'Angelo, Civitella Tronto, where nine pits containing a mixture of flint and pot, wild pears, and carbonized human bone from at least nine juveniles, and could be the result of cannibalistic or sacrificial activities (Grifoni Cremonesi, 1987). At Grotta Patrizi, Sasso Fubara near Rome an adult male burial (trepanned some days before death) accompanied by grave goods and hare bones and surrounded by stones was one of seven burials in the cave. This site is the type-site for the early-mid Neolithic in central Italy (ca. 5500-4400 b.c). Of comparable date, but of exclusively cult use, is the Umbrian site of Pozzi della Piana, where deep cave galleries have produced small ceramic cups, flint, bone and stone tools, and animal remains of cattle, sheep, goat and wild boar, red deer, and hare (Passeri, 1970). In northern Sardinia, a later Neolithic burial tradition was constructed of circular stone mounds as ex emplified at Li Muri (Fig. 18:2) relating perhaps, to the megalithic traditions of Corsica and the west Mediterranean. The earliest burials in north Italy are associated with the Fiorano culture. Unfurnished crouched inhumations are known from Calerno and S. Ilario d'Enza in Emilia. The contemporary culture of Finale-Quinzano includes inhumation in small cemeteries at Molino Casarotto and crouched burials with pottery, arrowheads, and axes from Quinzano in Veneto. Cave burial was the norm for much of Liguria, and at the cave of Arene Candide at Finale (Fig. 18: 1) at least 30 burials were found and at the cave of Pollera there were some 42 burials, many of which were juveniles. Adults were buried flexed or crouched in small stone cists, and were accompanied by pottery, lithics, bone tools, and various ornaments of shell and animal teeth. By the mid Neolithic formalized burials develop (Square-mouthed pot tery). At La Vela (Fig. 18: 8) in Adige recent work revealed cist graves</page><page sequence="64">298 MaJone made up of limestone slabs, and single/double burials of adults and juve niles. These were accompanied by flint arrowheads, long blades, an axe, and scraper. Other burials indicate that the graves may be orientated NW-SE, and burials may have been placed on their left sides. In the later Neolithic, although cemeteries associated with settlements are sparse, groups of cist graves are known from several places and had much in common with Chassey sites in France. Some cemetery groups at Villeneuve, Monjovet, Sarre, and S. Nicholas had as many as 25 inhuma tions, but surprisingly few grave goods (flints, shell pendants, and rarely polished stone). The Eneolithic Remedello culture was very different in its treatment of the dead. Large cemeteries often with over a hundred buri als in collective graves were common in the Po valley. Grave goods were particularly rich and included arrowheads, flint daggers, axes, copper ob jects including bangles, awls, halberds, and pins. Pottery was rarely placed in graves. In the mountainous areas of Liguria, cave burial sometimes with about a dozen inhumations, persisted, as at Tana Bertrand and Le Camere. The recent and unprecedented discovery of the Alpine Ice Man, "Otzi" from the Otzal Alps (Bolzano) in NE Italy (Barfield, 1994; Bortenschlager et al, 2000; Moser et al, 1994; Spindler, 1994; Spindler et al, 1996) offers a remark able insight on the finding of an ice mummy from continental Europe. The preservation of so much technological detail and organic human remains from the Copper Age/Final Neolithic people ca. 3300 b.c provide the first opportunity to assess materials normally never persevered. Immense scien tific analysis has been undertaken of every organic and inorganic aspect, of the find and literature continues to emerge. Archaeologically, the details about the hafting of the copper axe, the sewn birch-bark container, the skin quiver and complete set of stone-tipped arrows, decorations and the sewn skin clothing, cloak of plaited grasses, snow shoes, string, tools, and much else reveal just how sparse is the normal prehistoric record. The Social Organization and Structure of the Italian Neolithic The funerary material and settlement evidence together give the im pression of small-medium-scale social groups over the length of the Ne olithic. There are no obviously large central places represented anywhere in Italy until later in the Bronze Age, and cemeteries exist at scales associated with self-sufficient tribal societies. Only the Maltese funerary sites with their concentrations of hundreds (and perhaps thousands) of individuals suggest a different scale, but in these small island cases, the long time-scale also needs to be taken into account. The status of individuals is also remark ably egalitarian with limited grave goods and individual and paired burials.</page><page sequence="65">The Italian Neolithic: A Synthesis of Research 299 There are marked differences in the full Copper Age cultures that succeed the Neolithic cultures discussed here, with prominent and hierarchial settle mentsites, richly endowed individuals, prestige objects and much more evi dence for trade, exchange, and accumulated wealth (see Whitehouse, 1984, 1992). CONCLUSIONS: THE BROADER PICTURE OF THE ITALIAN NEOLITHIC Barker (1981) pointed out how the world of the Mediterranean peasant farmer changed little and slowly over long periods of time (the longue duree). Traditions that developed at the beginning of farming in the seventh-sixth millennia b.c continued with little dramatic change throughout the Neolithic and Bronze Age. Gradual improvements in technology, new strategies of land management and patterns of exploitation together with the adoption and development of improved animal stock and cereals, led to both more intensive and more extensive use of the landscape. By the later Neolithic, uplands as well as lowlands were tamed into a mixed agricultural and pas toral pattern of seasonal subsistence, setting the scene for Mediterranean continuity. New evidence and improving assessment are beginning to pro vide a clearer picture of how the central Mediterranean landscape was ex ploited. However, there are still gaping holes in the evidence, such as most of the Sicilian and Sardinian Neolithic economies. Only in northern Italy have economic and environmental studies been routinely applied to prehis toric sites and landscapes, so that at last, general patterns of change can be discerned. Much criticism can be levelled at the approaches commonly used in prehistoric research in the region, especially the continuing emphasis on artefact studies. But nevertheless, knowledge of the Italian Neolithic is now comparable with that of Greece and France, and common trends, as well as the individual patterns of development form a fascinating comparative study. Of the communities of Neolithic Italy, what conclusions can be drawn about their development? The continuity of indigenous Mesolithic popula tions alongside new Neolithic groups appears more pronounced than else where in the Mediterranean. New research is being usefully directed towards understanding the transition of these groups. Once established as farming communities, the societies appear to be conservative, and often rather iso lated, except through exchange of exotica. Only in the late Neolithic is there a sense of wider identity. Conversely, however, it is at this stage of devel opment that the role of the individual also begins to become apparent. In dividual burials, limited personal wealth in the form of fine and prestigious</page><page sequence="66">300 Malone artefacts, cult sites for limited sections of society hint at the changes to come in the Copper Age. In the case of some elaborate tombs and structures like the huge mound of Monte d'Accoddi in Sardinia, there is the suggestion of corporate enterprise and the organization of labor on an impressive scale, reflecting, perhaps, emerging power structures and dominant individuals. Finally, the overriding impression of Italy and its islands is of great diversity of cultural and economic adaptation in the earlier and middle Ne olithic periods. Only towards the final Neolithic is there apparent cultural unity, when ceramics, exchange patterns, and economic exploitation become broadly similar. A further impression of the Italian Neolithic is of its great wealth of material culture. Whilst too much detail has been devoted in many reports to the description of every potsherd and flint flake to the exclusion of other data, there is nevertheless a remarkable body of data, of context, of technology, source exploitation, of settlement, and of environment and economy. It is so great, indeed, that a review paper like this can do little justice to it.
