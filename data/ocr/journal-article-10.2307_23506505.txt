<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE TREATMENT OF ANTHROPOMORPHISMS AND ANTHROPOPATHISMSANTHROPOPATHISMS IN THE SEPTUAGINT OF PSALMS* ARTHUR SOFFER, New York M1 IV /T UCH work has been done during the past fifteen years or so on -»־*-I- the attitude of Septuagint translators to their Hebrew text in relation to those terms and expressions that tended to treat God as though He were a human being. The most recent discussion of this phase of Septuagint criticism, dealing with the book of Isaiah, is that by Harry M. Orlinsky (in HUCA 27 [1956], 193-200). Reserving for another occasion a detailed analysis of the problem in general, and of the work — albeit meager — done hitherto on the Septuagint (hereafter LXX) of Psalms in particular, we turn our attention at once to the following anthropomorphisms in the Masoretic text (here after MT) of Psalms and their translation in the LXX: ,פנים, לאש שעתום, קול. פה, אז5ום עינום, :ד, זרוע, ימין, 9ף■ אצעעת, אעךה, חיק, פעמים רנלום and ענפים. To conclude this chapter we shall investigate those words which Edwin Hatch, in his Essays in Biblical Greek, has classified as "psychological terms," i. e., רוח and לב. These terms represent the borderline cases lying between anthropomorphism and anthropo pathism. They are associated in the Hebrew language with the material world or with a specific organ ; consequently they are closer to anthro pomorphisms than to the anthropopathisms that we will study in the following chapter, i. e., אף, חרון, חמה, עבךה, זעם, קצף, עעם, קנאה and שנאה. * This article constitutes the essential part of a study that was accepted by the New York School of Hebrew Union College - Jewish Institute of Religion in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Hebrew Letters (1956). The writer plans to continue with the subject so as to cover other aspects of the Septuagint of Psalms in relation to the Hebrew. Here he would express his indebted ness to Prof. Harry M. Orlinsky not only for suggesting this subject to him and for the numerous and invaluable suggestions made by him in the course of the research and the composition, but also for his constant encouragement and limitless patience. The writer should like to express his gratitude to Rabbi I. Edward Kiev, Librar ian of the New York School of the College-Institute, for his generous help in matters of bibliography and research; and to Mrs. Susan Tabor of the Library staff for her assistance in finding a number of the bibliographical items.</page><page sequence="2">86 ARTHUR SOFFER [2] Because so many of the Psalms are highly personal prayers directed at a God who is felt to be near, and because they include some of the most poetic passages in the Bible, the Hebrew text of the Book of Psalms abounds in anthropomorphisms and anthropopathisms. Since the Psalter was an integral part of the public worship, it would seem that the LXX translator would have taken great care to reproduce this text properly. It was this combination of factors that has led the writer to assume that the Book of Psalms lends itself admirably to an inquiry such as the one projected in this introduction. Chapter I. Anthropomorphisms 1. 1. (a) The פנים of the Lord appears 41 times in our Book.1 In every case but one (9.20; see below), the translator uses some form of to πρόσωπον,πρόσωπον, even in 42.6 (see below) where the Hebrew and Greek do not coincide. Typical of פנים/το προσωπον are 22.25 ולא לקתיר) פניו מ?נו)/ (ουδέ ά7τέστρεψβν) το π. αυτού άπ' έμού and 95■2 Ή? ((?.קד?ה 7)/(?תוךל)7)/(1יתוךה)τροφθάσωμεν) το π. αΰτον (έν έξομολογήσα)· We might compare the literalness of the translation in the passage just given, where it is the "face" of the Lord that is involved, with the paraphrase of a similar expression in 17.13 קךמה ?{יו_ (rrjn: 0קמ)/(קומה σθητι,σθητι, κύρΐ(.,) πρόφθασον αυτούς. Note that it is the "face" of the wicked that is paraphrased. Now let us turn our attention to the sole instance involving the "face" of the Lord which the translator has rendered without using το το π., 9.20 טו נ1לם על־?{יף?^: / κρώήτωσαν 'έθνη ένώπών σου. The sense has not been changed, על־?{יף has merely been rendered idio matically. This use of על־פני is discussed by Driver in BOB, p. 818. It is noted that this phrase may have one of three connotations: "before," "in preference to," or "in addition to." Our example falls into the first category, which, Driver says, is more definite and distinct than ל?ני. ένώπων which the translator used here, is regularly used to translate the various forms of לפני. Clearly, the translator was not anti-anthropomorphic when he chose to translate על־פניף with a word which accords more closely to the meaning of the phrase than with one that is merely literal and doesn't convey the idea. One may compare compare here πρότίρός σου for על־פניך in Ex. 33.19, where the "face" is Moses', not God's. 14-7: 9-20; 10.11 ; 11.7; 13.2; 16.11; 17.15; 21.7, 10; 22.25; 24.6; 27.8 (bis), 9; 30.8; 31.17, 21; 34.17; 42.3, 6; 44.4, 25; 51.11; 67.2; 69.18; 80.4, 8, 17, 20; 88.15; 89.15, 16; 90.8; 95.2; 102.3; 104 29; 105.4; 119-58, 135; 140.14; and 143.7.</page><page sequence="3">[3] ANTHROPOMORPHISMS IN THE SEPTUAGINT TO PSALMS 87 In 11.7: ובי־צדיק יהוה צךקות אהב) ;?וו־ ;חזו פנימו / βΰθύτητa eUev τό πρόσωπον πρόσωπον αΰτοΰ, the anthropomorphism inherent in פניטו has been reproduced literally with τό π.; but the translator has taken it to be the subject of the verb, not its object. E. Kissane2 says that "both Heb. and the Versions (except Targ.) make 'face' subject and 'upright' the object." Rashi takes פניטו to be the subject: ואוהב אותם שפניסו יחזו ישר, "He loves those whom His face sees (as) righteous." Ibn Ezra, however, points out the difficulty involved: ולא מצאנו הפנים רואים רק הענים שהם בם "We do not find (any instance of) the face seeing, only of the eyes which are in it." He also takes exception to the idea that the plural verb could possibly have the Lord as its subject. Consequently, he takes פניטו to be the object of the verb. It is apparent that the meaning of this verse is far from clear in the Hebrew; the LXX trans lator was faced with a problem that was essentially textual, not theological as others assert (e. g., Fr. Baethgen, "Der textkritische Wert der alten Uebersetzungen zu den Psalmen," in Jahrbiicher fiir protestantischeprotestantische Theologie, 8 [1882], 405-459, 593-667). The plural verb of the Hebrew suggested that פנימו be taken as the subject; its Greek counterpart, τό πρόσωπον, necessitated the singular elSev. Under these circumstances, one can hardly consider his translation to be motivated by the desire to avoid an anthropomorphism — one which he did not avoid! Nor is there any anti-anthropomorphic tendency in 42.6, 7 בי־עוד א1ךנו ;שועות פניו: אלהי / ότι 6ξομολο·γήσομαι αύτω. σωτήρων του προσώπου προσώπου μου 6 deos μου. ΜΤ פניו appears as του προσώπου μου i. e., the face of the Psalmist rather than of the Lord. However, one is not justified in jumping to the conclusion that the translator deliberately mistranslated his Hebrew text in order to avoid an anthropomorphism. Rather, it is clear that he read or understood: שועות פני ואלקי;, which (together with the entire verse) actually is the closing refrain of Psalms 42 and 43 (42.12; 43.5), מה־ת?ותויזחי נפשי ומה־תהמי עלי הוחילי לאלהים בי־עוד אוז־נו ;שועוח פני ואלקי: ΐνα τί 7repiXu7ros el,el,el,el, ψυχή, καΙ Ϊνα τί συνταράσσ6ις μ€) ΐλπισον έπΐ τον Θ6όν, 'ότι έξ ομολοΎήσομαι αύτω. σωτήρων του προσώπου μου ό 6e0s μου. In 17.15 the Greek translation does not correspond exactly with 2 Kissane, Monsignor Edward J., The Book of Psalms (Dublin 1953), Vol. I, p. 48. He adds: "But this reading is generally regarded as a correction made by the scribes for dogmatic reasons." This probably refers to the plural form of the verb, which Ibn Ezra takes as definitely precluding the idea that God's face is the subject. In spite of Kissane's assertion that 'face' is the subject in the Hebrew, the Hebrew text is still obscure.</page><page sequence="4">88 ARTHUR SOFFER [4] MT. But this cannot be accounted for by an anti-anthropomorphic tendency. For, as in 11.7, whatever the other difficulties, the anthro pomorphism is literally reproduced rather than paraphrased: אני בצו־ק אחןה פניף אעבעה בהקיץ מטינונף■: / εγώ δε ev δικαιοσύνη όφθήσομαι τφ προσώπιρ σου, χορτασθήσομαι ev τφ οφθήναι την δόζαν σον. Since the translator has reproduced פניך literally with τω ■προσώπω σου it would be strange if his rendering of רומינתף by την δόξαυ σον were motivated by an objection against attributing form to the Deity. This being the sole instance of ף1מיןה in Psalms, it would be difficult to demonstrate that anti-anthropomorphism is involved in its transla tion by δόξα. It would be equally difficult to prove the contrary; but certainly the burden of the proof does not rest on those who aren't able to see that anti-anthropomorphism is involved. The burden of the proof rests on those (such as Baethgen, p. 605) who advance that hypothesis. Methodologically, the fact that δόξα is generally used to translate בור? has no bearing on the question. The use of δόξα would be pertinent only if it could be demonstrated that the translator has used δόξα in this case of the תמונה of the Lord in stead of using another word, one which he generally uses to translate ויכונה when the Lord is not involved. Furthermore, for the evidence to be really convincing, it ought to come from the same Book, presum ably the work of a single translator. Since this is the sole instance of תסו{ה in Psalms, it is manifestly impossible to prove that anti-anthropo morphism is involved in its translation by δόξα. However, we shall still consider the possibility. Since Psalms affords only one example of תמונה, we turn our attention to the Pentateuch, where it appears 8 times. In 7 instances it is translated by ομοίωμα, ομοίωμα ομοίωμα is used to translate the תמונה of the Lord in Deut. 4.12, 15 as well as the תמונה not involving the Lord in Ex. 20.4; Deut. 4.16, 23, 25; and 5.8. It appears that the translators of Exodus and Deuteroncmy did not feel constrained to avoid the translation of the תמו{ה of God as ομοίωμα,ομοίωμα, or to choose an especially anti-anthropomorphic word with which to translate תמונה when it involved the Lord. There is, however, one more instance of תמונה in the Pentateuch. It occurs in Numbers 12.8, where God is said to have spoken with Moses "mouth to mouth," פה אל־פה אז־בר־בו ומךאה ולא בהירות יתמנת יהיה :!ייט / στόμα κατά στόμα λαλήσω αΰτω ev ε'ίδει και οΰ δι.' aiviy μάτων,μάτων, και την δόζαν κυρίου βίδβν. We might note that the use of δόξα here may have been recalled by the translator of Psalms when he came to תםוןה in Ps. 17.15; on the other hand, the similarity may be pure coincidence, both translators having independently under stood that the תמי{ה of the Lord is His δόξα. In connection with this</page><page sequence="5">[5] ANTHROPOMORPHISMS IN THE SEPTUAGINT TO PSALMS 89 use of δόξα in the Pentateuch, C. T. Fritsch (The Anti-Anthropomor phismsphisms of the Greek Pentateuch [Princeton, 1943], 9) says that "the very idea of ascribing form to God is carefully avoided in the Greek of Num. 12.8"; and he uses the latter part of the verse as his third example in the chapter on anti-anthropomorphisms, examples which he defines as instances where "in their attempt to spiritualize the conception of God, the translators of the Greek Old Testament avoided, to some extent, those representations which invested the deity with human form." Had Fritsch considered and cited the first part of the verse, where פה אל־פה אךבר־בו is literally reproduced as στόμα στόμα κατ α στόμα λαλήσω αύτώ, he could hardly interpret the use of δόξα for 1זםו{ה as an anti-anthropomorphism. To use his own phrase, "the very idea of ascribing form to God" and one of "those representations which invested the Deity with human form" is carefully reproduced in the Greek of Num. 12.8. Whatever the translator's reason for using δόξα in Num. 12.8 or in Ps. 17.15, it was clearly not anti-anthropomorphism. Moreover, we have no basis for assuming that he considered using ομοίωμα and rejected it in favor of δόξα; δόξα may have been the first word that suggested itself to him. Even if he did reject ομοίωμα, a better explanation can be found than that of anti-anthropomorphism which involves us in the inconsistency of the translator's being anti-anthropomorphic at the end of a verse in the earlier part of which he reproduced a glaring anthropomorphism literally. For instance, it may be that he felt that ομοίωμα ομοίωμα didn't properly represent the meaning of ף1מוןה in Num. 12.8, because תמו{ה here meant the very presence of God, not a representa tion. ομοίωμα does mean a representation as it is used in Ex. 20.4; Deut. 4.16, 23, 25; and 5.8. Even in Deut. 4.12 and 15, ομοίωμα may mean a representation. But in Num. 12.8 and in Ps. 17.15 1מו5ה^ means God's own physical manifestation,3 for which the translator chooses to use δόξα. Fritsch came close to the point but missed it. By using δόξα in Num. 12.8, what the translator avoided was not "the very idea of ascribing form to God," but the very idea that Moses gazed on a representation of the Deity rather than on God Himself. Similarly, in Ps. 17.15 :■אק!בעה בו^קיץ ף1מי{תף / χορτασθήσομat ev τω όφθηναι την δόξανδόξαν σου, the translator has correctly communicated the idea that the Psalmist will be satisfied when God Himself appears; not with an 3 Cf.

This is similar to that which Moses requested (Ex. 33.18), :יאמר הראני (א את־כבדך! / και \eye1. ΑεΊξόνΑεΊξόν μοιμοι την σεαυτου δόξαν, and to which God replied (v. 19), ויאמר אני אעביר כל־טובי על־פניך / και εΐπεν Έγώ παρελεύσομαι πρότερος σον TVTV δύξν μ°υ and νν. 22, 23 ,®בנקרת הצור וקבתי כ TWl ו^יה בעבר כגדי עליך על ¥בךי: והקלתי את־כפי וךאית את־אחקי ופני לא .יךאו:: / ήνίκα δ'άν παρ έλθηέλθη μου η δόξα, και θήσω σε εις όπήν της πέτρας και σκεπάσω τη τη χει ρί μου επί σε, 'έως αν παρέλθω, και άφελώ την χείρα, και τότε δψηδψη τα οπίσω μου, τό δε πρόσωπον μου ουκ όφθήσεταί σοι. In pass ing, we might note the fidelity with which the translator has repro duced the anthropomorphisms אחל ,כף and □פני in these verses from Exodus. It is also apparent that δόξα, which is used for בל־טובי as well as for בבלי, represents the נים! of God; and it is in this sense that it is used for וזמינה by the translator of Numbers (12.8) and also in Ps. 17.15. Our excursus to Exodus 33 is not so much a digression as it may seem at first. For it is in that chapter that we can find our translator's reason for rendering אחזה קני ך in Ps. 17.15 as όφθήσομαι τω προσώπω σου.σου. with the verb in the passive rather than in the active voice. Before explaining όφθήσομαι with the hypothesis of a deliberate, theo logically motivated exegesis, it is the responsibility of the scholar to exhaust the less striking possibilities. To begin with, one must recog nize that the idea of man's seeing the "face" of the Lord conflicted with the Pentateuchal theology as expressed specifically in Ex. 33.20 :יאמל לא תוכל ללאת את־פנ; כי לא־יךאני האלם נסי:נסי:נסי] / και είπεν οΰ δυνήση ίδεΐνίδεΐν μου τό πρόσωπον' ού yap μη ϊδη άνθρωπος τό πρόσωπον μου και και ζήσεται. With unmistakable reference to the first clause, the translator glossed the suffix of נךאני with τό πρόσωπον μου. The denial of man's ability to see the "face" of God is reflected in Ex. 2315,23.15, !7: 34-20, 23, 24; Deut. 16.16 and 31.11, in all of which MT vocalizes as Niphal rather than Qal the various forms of the phrase ללאת (את") פני יהוה, and the Greek appears with the appropriate form of the passive όράν (όφθήσομαι). It would still be unwarranted to conclude that the passive όφθήσομαι is used for MT אקזה in Ps. 17.15 as the result of a deliberate exegesis on the part of the translator. Even F. W. Mozley, who believes that "a neuter sense is given to the verb to avoid seeming irreverence," (The Psalter of the Church [Cambridge,1[Cambridge,1^1905], p. 30), is constrained to add immediately "but in Exod. 10.28, 29 twice out of 3 times is the same change in the case of men." Moreover, it is not unlikely that the translator un derstood the unvocalized אחזה to mean όφθήσομαι; because of the numerous precedents in the Pentateuch, concerning which he was</page><page sequence="7">[7] ANTHROPOMORPHISMS IN THE SEPTUAGINT TO PSALMS 91 in possession of the tradition of reading them as verbs in the Niphal, he may well have thought that אחזה in Ps. 17.15 was also in the Niphal.Niphal. Our translator was dealing with an unvocalized text; he could have understood the verb in either of two ways, both of which were justified by his Hebrew text. To say that he understood it in the way that presented no theological difficulties is not the same as saying that he deliberately chose one over the other (which would imply that if the sole reading justified by his Hebrew text conflicted with his theological ideas, he would ignore the text and proffer an unobjectionable paraphrase as a conscientious translation of scripture). In 63.3 we have another instance of the verb חזה being translated as a passive although it appears in MT in the Qal voice: 3ן 3קך0 חזיוזיף לךאות ^זך ילבוךןז: / oiiros ev τω ayicp ωφθην σοι του ιδειν την δύναμίν σου σου και την δόξαν σου. Here it is not specifically the "face" of the Lord that is involved, but the Lord in His totality. Before we take ωφθην ωφθην σοι as an anti-anthropomorphic paraphrase of חזיתיך (as Baeth gen [p. 420] and Mozley [p. 100] do), we should pause to recognize that this entire verse, but especially the first verb, poses a problem. The problem is one that caused difficulties not only for the LXX trans lator, but also for modern translators who were not at all concerned with avoiding anthropomorphisms. In the King James version, for example, the second strophe is made to precede the first: "O God, Thou art my God; early will I seek Thee, my flesh longeth for Thee as a dry and thirsty land, where no water is; To see Thy power and Thy glory, so as I have seen Thee in the sanctuary." The Revised Standard Version keeps the order of MT intact. However, חזיתיף appears as "I have looked upon Thee," but לךאות is reproduced as a participle, "beholding." In the Jewish Publication Society version, זזיתיף} appears as "I have looked for Thee." The problem is this: if ח!יוזיף means "I have seen Thee," then לךא1ת cannot be a complementary infinitive meaning "to see." Kissane4 solves the problem by emending חךתיך to דוךחיך$&gt;, "So in the sanctuary do I seek Thee, to see Thy strength and Thy glory." Oesterley,5 who translates חזית^ף as "I beheld Thee," had to render לו־אות as "and saw." The LXX translator of our Book solved this problem by understanding חזיתיך as ωφθην σοι, which allowed 44 Op. cit., pp. 268-9. "Heb. has 'I beheld Thee.' The text is probably corrupt The context suggests something like 'I long for Thee.' " So, in his Critical Notes, he emends to ןזחךתיףי&gt;! F. Buhl, in Biblia Hebraica3, offers: "prps 3ק' אףו1ך; melius 3.ק&lt;}!תי ןזז1^ף." As for myself, I am inclined to keep the problem, rather than try to justify such emendations. 3 W. O. E. Oesterley, The Psalms, etc. (London, 1953), p. 305.</page><page sequence="8">92 ARTHUR SOFFER [8] לךאות to appear as a complementary infinitive, ίδείν. Why he did not choose to reproduce חזיתיך with εΐδον σε, and לךאות as όφθήναι, cannot be explained with any degree of certainty. But to force an explanation based on anti-anthropomorphism would be difficult in view of the unmistakable anthropomorphisms literally reproduced in verses 8 and 9 of this very chapter: ולצל מפיך אחין: דבקה נפשי אחריך כי $מ?ה מינך:; / και εν rrj σκέ 1ןךז των 7זτεpύyωv σου άyaXλιάσoμaι. Ικο\\ήθη ή ψυχή μου οπίσω σου, έμου άντελάβετο ή δεξιά σου. Finally, as even Mozley points out (p. 30), in 84.8 the LXX is less "reverent" than MT: ךאה אל־אלקים! / όψθήσεται ο θεός των θεών. (a) The compound מפני and its various derivatives occur 8 times in our Book with reference to the Lord (9.496.9 ;9 ,3 ,68.2 ;38.4 ,־; 102.11; and 139.7). !יי every case it is translated literally από προσώ που,που, e. g., 139.7 :Π"Ρ$ ואןה / και από του προσώπου σου που φύyω; (b) The compound לפני and its various derivatives do not really fall within the scope of this paper, since they can hardly be considered anthropomorphisms; they are included for the sake of completeness in the various forms of פנים, and because of what we may learn about the style of the translator. There are 34 instances of לפני, or its de rivatives, involving the Lord. In 2 of these instances the translator uses some form of πρόσωπον: 96.13 לקני ;חוה בי בא / προ προσώπου κυρίου κυρίου ότι 'έρχεται; g8.g לפני־;הןה כי בא / GA (GB is lacking here) ά7τό προσώπου προσώπου κυρίου οτι 'έρχεται. The translator used ένώπων 22 times (18.7; 19.15; 22.28; 41.13; 56.14; 61.8; 62.9; 68.4, 5; 72.9; 79.11; 86.9; 88.3; 96.6; 98.6; 100.2; 106.23; ιι9·169&gt; 170; 141.2; 142.3b; and 143.2). In 22.28 ן;&lt;}1תוחוו לפניך כל־משפחות נוים: / και προσκυνήσουσιν ενώπών σου πασαι αί πατροαί των των εθνών, Duhm, Briggs, Oesterley, and many others, may be justified in emending MT לפניך on the basis of GBSA (αύτου), Vulgate, etc., to לפניו. On the other hand, Rahlfs, following Cyprian, reads ενώπιον ενώπιον σου. But whether αυτου or σου, the reference is still to the Lord. The translator used also έναντίον 8 times (50.3; 85.14; 95.6; 97.3; 102.ι; 116.9; 119-169; and 142.3a), e. g., 50.3 0(;בא אלהינו ואל־:סר 0 / א^"לפןיו תאכל θεόs ήμών, και οΰ παρασιωπήσεται') πυρ έναν τίοντίον αυτου καυθήσεται. There are 2 instances of periphrasis: 76.8 (:ומי־נעטד לפניך &lt;מאז אפך / και και τις άντιστήσεταί σοι (άπό τότε ή οργή σου). Similar periphrasis is found in Esther 9.2 where ואיש לא־עמד לפניהם appears as ουδείς yap αντέστη. That there is no objection to the idea involved (such as the</page><page sequence="9">[9][9] ANTHROPOMORPHISMS IN THE SEPTUAGINT TO PSALMS 93 denial of "place" to God) is apparent from the literal translation of Ps. 106.23: לולי משה בחירו עמד בפרץ לפנ^י / εί μη Mowijs ό έκλεκτόςέκλεκτός αύτούαύτού εστη έν τη θραύσει ενώπιον αΰτοΟ. The other instance occurs in 102.29: &lt;בני־עבליך לשכוני) וילש□ לפניףי 01) / !בון: υιοί των δούλων σον κατασκηνώσονσιν,) καί το σπέρμα αύτώναύτών els τον αιώνα κατευθννθήσεται. As Schleusner points out, els τον αιώνα κατευθννθήσεται is simply a free translation of the MT reading; the supposition of לעד in the translator's Vorlage (so, e. g., Buhl in BH3) is hardly necessary. (c) To translate מלפני, από προσώπου is used, the reason being that the translator wanted to render the prefixed מן as well as לפני· To have used ένώπιον or εναντίον alone would not have been enough. There are 6 instances of מלפני in which the Lord is involved (17.2; 51.13; 97.5 [bis]; and 114.7 [f&gt;i5]). Our word is reproduced literally in every instance, e. g., 17.2 מלפניך משפטי !צא / έκ προσώπου σου τό κρίμα μου μου έζέλθοι; 97-5 [δΑ]: מלפני ידעה מלפני אדון כל־הארץ /από προσώπου κυρίου,κυρίου, από προσώπου κυρίου πασής της -γης. 2.2. The ראש of the Lord occurs twice in our Book, both times in the phrase מעוז לאשי. In 60.9 it is reproduced κραταίωσις της κεφαλής μου; in 108.9, αντίλημψις της κεφαλής μου. It goes without saying that when ראש means "top," "chief," or "beginning," it is translated by άκρος (72.16), άρχων (24.7, 9), or αρχή (137.6; 139.17). As a matter of fact, in the last three instances cited, Aquila translates לאש with κεφαλή. The LXX translator used better judgment in avoiding this literalism. But note that this occurs only in passages where the לאש is not that of the Lord. 3. The שפתלם of God are mentioned twice in Psalms, and in both cases the translation is literal: 17.4 בלבד שפתיך / δια τους λόγους τών χει λέων λέων σου; 89.35 :לא אחלל בליתי) ומוצא ש?9י לא ^י1ה) / και τα έκπο ρευόμεναρευόμενα δια τών χειλέων μου οϋ μη αθετήσω. 4. The ק1ל of the Lord occurs 13 times in our Book (18.14; 29-34 י bis, 5, 7, 8, and 9; 46.7; 68.34; 81.12; 95.7; and 106.25) and is always translated literally by φωνή, e. g., 18.14 קלי W !רעם בשם!ם ,יהיה* ו^ל'י·.!) / καί καί ό 'ύψιστος εδωκεν φωνήν αυτού; 29.5 ®קול־יהוה &lt;שבל אלזי / φωνή κυρίου κυρίου (συντρίβοντος κέδρους). When the translator does, how ever, paraphrase קול — by προσευχή — the voice is the Psalmist's, not God's, e. g., 64.2 שמע־אלחים קולי בשיחי / είσάκουσον, ό θεός, της φωνής φωνής (GB τής προσευχής) μου; 130.2 אלני שמעה בקולי / κύριε, είσά κουσονκουσον τής φωνής (GA τής προσευχής) μου. Were there any strong objection to this anthropomorphism, he might well have used λόγος,</page><page sequence="10">94 ARTHUR SOFFER [10] which appears for קול in Jer. 38.2ο6 and which would have accorded well with Alexandrian philosophical terminology. It may be noted that although the attribution of speech and voice to the Lord con stitutes anthropomorphism, even the Targums do not paraphrase or employ hypostases of God when these terms are used in reference to Him. 5. There are 7 instances of the ה? of the Lord (18.9; 33.6; 105.5; 119.13, 72, 88; and 138.4) in our Book. It is regularly translated by το στόμα except in 18.9, ללה ל?ון באפו) ןאע־םפיו האבל) / (άνέβη καπνός iviv opyfj αύτοΰ,) και πυρ από προσώπου αύτοΰ κατίφλοΎίσβν. פיו appears as πρόσωπον here and also in 55.22, which is discussed in § 19 below. In MT of this verse the Lord is not the sub ject, but He is taken as such by the LXX translator, חלקו מקמאת פיו ווקךב־לבו) / δΐίμερίσθησαν από opyfjs του προσώπου αύτου (και η η η yyiaev ή καρδία αυτού). That neither anti-anthropomorphism nor any theological consideration is involved in 18.9 and 55.22 would seem clearly indicated by the literalness of the other 6 instances, e. g., 33.6 :יד־בר יהוה ?ומים נעע!ו&gt; ולרוח פיו לל־ללאם» / (τω λόγω του κυρίου οί ουρανοί ουρανοί ΐστβρβώθησαν) και τω πνεύματι του στόματος αύτου πασαπασα ή ή δύναμις αύτών. Some scholars would explain από του προσώπου αύτοΰ in these two verses as from מלפניו (for MT וטפיו), but this is not likely. (1) Two independent instances are involved, in the second of which (55.22) מלפןיו would be senseless; (2) In Prov. 2.6 (לי־יהוה ;תן וחלמה) מפיו ךעת וקובוןה is likewise reproduced by (ότι κύριος δίδωσιν σοφίαν) και από προσώπου προσώπου αύτοΰ (yνώσις και σύνβσις) —where some would assume "G י?פ{יו vel ומלכיו" (e. g., Beer, in BH3). Three such instances of πρόσωπον πρόσωπον / טפיו) render מ&lt;ל&gt;פניו most unlikely. 6. There are 11 instances in our Book of the "ear(s)" &lt;אןךאזנ:ם&gt; of the Lord (10.17; 17-6; 18.7; 31.3; 34.16; 71.2; 86.1; 88.3; 102.3; 116.2; and 130.2). It is always translated as ous-ώτα, e. g., 10.17 תק?ויב / προσίσχενπροσίσχεν τό ους σου; 116.2 לי־הטה אזנו ^י / 'ότι ίκλινίν τό 0υ5 αύτοΰ ft ft 6μοι. The verb האזין occurs 15 times in Psalms. To translate it, ένωτί {βσθαι{βσθαι is used 11 times. Of these eleven, the verb occurs with the Lord as subject 9 times (5.2; 17.1; 39.13; 54.4; 55.2; 84.9; 86.6; 140.7; and 143.1), once with man as the subject (49.2), and once, with the idols (135.17). For the remaining 4 instances of האזין, προσέχειν is 6 LXX 45.20, where מע־ןא ^קול יהוה^ appears as cucovaov tov \oyov Kvpiov.</page><page sequence="11">[11] ANTHROPOMORPHISMS IN THE SEPTUAGINT TO PSALMS 95 used. Of these four instances, it occurs with the Lord as the subject 3 times (77.2; 80.2; and 141.1) and with man as the subject, once (78.1). The following examples should suffice to illustrate: 55.2 האזיןה אלהים ובעלתי / ένώτισαι, ό 6e6s, την προσίυχην μου; 77·2 "(קולי אל אלהים&gt; והאזין אלי / (φωνη μου προς τον θών,) καΐ προσέσχίν μοι. 77τροσέχίΐν also occurs in a case involving the Lord, where the anthropomorphic verb does not appear in the Hebrew but has been added by the translator for stylistic effect: 22.2 אלי אלי למה ע1ל1ז5י / ό 0eos, ό Θ6ός μου, πρόσχβς μοι,' ίνα τί έγκατέλιπές μ6. 7. There are 12 instances in MT Psalms of the עינ:ם־ע:ן ("eyes") of the Lord. Of these, 10 are translated literally by οφθαλμός (5.6; 11.4; 17.2; 18.25; 31.23; 32.8; 33.18; 34.16; 90.4; and 139-16). Some examples are: 11.4 &lt;:0עיניו :חזו ועעעעיו ;בחנו ?ני אך / οΐ οφθαλμοί αΰτοΰ eis τον πένητα πένητα άποβλέπουσιν, (τα βλέφαρα αΰτοΰ έξατά^ι τους υιούς των ανθρώπων)·,ανθρώπων)·, 31-23 ננךןתי םג?ד / άπέρριμμαι άρα από προσώπου των οφθαλμών οφθαλμών σου. In the remaining 2 instances, both cases of prepositional עעי?, the translator correctly used the preposition ένώπιον, έναντίον: 51.6 והרע ?עיניך ע'ןויתי / καί τό πονηρόν ένώπιόν σου έποίησα-, 116.15 !,קר עיני :ה(ה (הטותה לחקיךיו):? / τίμιος έναντίον κυρίου (ό θάνατος τών οσίων οσίων αΰτοΰ). In 17.2 :עיניך תחזינה סי^ךים becomes οί οφθαλμοί μου Ιδέτωσαν ίΰθΰ τητας,τητας, and it is not unlikely that the LXX translator based his reading on an original עיני, which accords well with the context; cf. e. g., Buhl in BH}, "G עיני prb recte." 90.4, which is cited above, is an instance where the translator is more literal in rendering an "anthropomorphism" in a case involving the Lord than he is with the same phrase when God is not involved. Although עיני? is generally reproduced ένώπιον or έναντίον, in 90.4, where it is the Lord that is addressed, the figure of speech is literally spelled out: έν όφθαλμοΐς σου. Of course, in view of 51.6 and 116.15, one can hardly say that the translator is especially literal in cases in volving God; and it is hardly more than coincidence that in every instance of עיני? with reference to man the "anthropomorphism" is avoided by the use of ένώπιον (15.4; 36.3; and 72.14) or έναντίον (73.6 and 98.2). 8.

In 55·21 there is an instance of ך'ו: which the translator takes to be the hand of the Lord although it would hardly seem proper to say this of Him: (:שלח :ליו וכשלמיו הלל בריתו / έξέτεινεν την χείρα αΰτου (εν(εν τω άποδιδόναι' έβεβήλωσαν την διαθήκην αΰτου). Cf. further §5 (פה) above and §19 (לב) below. The entire passage, 55.20-22, is very difficult to understand in MT, and the pronominal references are uncertain. But the LXX translator, in trying to clarify it, seems to take the Lord to be the subject of ךיו:, and of פיו and לבו in v. 22. 9. There are 8 instances of the זרוע of the Lord in our Book (44.4b: 71.18; 77.16; 79.11; 89.14, 22; 98.1; and 136.12) and 1 instance (89.11) of מרוע עזך. In all 9 cases, זרוע is literally rendered βραχίων, e. g., 71.18 (:עד אגיד זרועך «לדור (לכל־:בוא ןבוךתך / 'έως αν άπαγ"γείλω τον βρα χίονάχίονά σου πάση τη ,γενεά; 79■11 5גךל זרועך» / κατά την με^αΧωσυνην του του βραχίονός σου; 89.11 &lt;;מרוע עזך (פ!דת אויביך / και έν τω βραχίονι της της δυνάμεως σου.

The translator always uses δεξιά, e. g., 63.9 בי תמכה ;מינך / έμοΰ άντελά βετοβετο η δεξι,ά σου; 118.16 :ימין יהוה ר1מ,מה ;מין ;דעה עשה 0:ל / δεξι,ά κυρίου ΐ'ψωσένΐ'ψωσέν με, δεξιά κυρίου έποίησεν δύναμιν. In this connection, mention might be made of a passage in which the "right hand" of the Lord occurs in the LXX and does not occur in MT: 90.12 למנות :מינו כן הולע / έξαριθμήσασθαι. την δεξίάν σου ( = ימינו) ούτος Ύνώρι,σον. 11. Reference is made to the כף of the Lord only once in Psalms: 139.5 נת?זת עלי / και εθηκας επ' εμε την χεΐρά σου. χειρ is also used for כף ip 49 other instances in Psalms, whe^e the Lord is not involved. In the sole remaining instance,-128.2, καρπός is used; but the כף is not the Lord's.</page><page sequence="13">[13] ANTHROPOMORPHISMS IN THE SEPTUAGINT TO PSALMS 97 12.

There is one instance of the אבךה ("pinion") of God: 91.4 קאבךתו 91ד לד / cp το is μεταφρένοις αυτού e7τισκιάσει σοι.. Μετάιρρενον is also used in the only other instance of אברה in Psalms, 68.14, where the reference is to a dove. 14. The חיק ("bosom") of the Lord is rendered literally in the LXX of the following verse: 74.11 (למה תשיב ;ךך וימינך) ט,קךב חיקך כלה: (Kethib = ^1n ;Qre = ) / ('ίνα τί άποστρέφεις την χείρά σου καίκαί τήν δεξιάν σου) έκ μέσου του κόλπου σου εις τέλος. 15. There are 2 instances of the עמים? ("steps") of God. In both cases, the translator has reproduced the anthropomorphism literally, though differently in each case: 74.3 קדימה ?עמיך / 'έπαρον τάς χεϊράς σου;σου; 85.14 :ו:שם לךךך ®עמיו //cat θήσει εις όδόν τα διαβήματα αυτού. Διάβημα Διάβημα is the most common translation of עמים? in Psalms (cf. 17.5; 85.14; 119.133; and 140.5. In none of these cases is the reference to God). Χειρ, usually the translation for ר;, is used not only in 74.3 but also in 58.11 (where God is not involved): ((ושמח צךיק כי־חןה נ,קם עמיו ירחץ קדם קך#ע:? / (εύφρανθήσεταו δίκαιος, όταν ΐδη έκδίκησιν άσεβων')άσεβων') τάς χεΐρας αυτού νίφεται έν τω αΐματι τον αμαρτωλού. In the Hatch-Redpath Concordance to the Septuagint, p. 1463, these instances of χειρ are followed by an obelus, which would indicate "that the identification of the Greek and Hebrew is doubtful" (ibid. vi). However, it would seem clear that the translator used χειρ in both 58.11 and 74.3 for קמים? and no Other word. We might not agree with his translation; biit we have no grounds for questioning theidentifica tion In the translator's mind. Nor is it necessary to assume כ?יו (so, e. g., Buhl in BH3) in the LXX-Vorlage in:58.11 and 74.3; ef. Schleus rter, S. χειρ, p. 515. To conclude this matter of עמים?, it might be noted that our translator also uses 7τους in 57.7. But, whether πους, χειρ;χειρ; or διάβημα; the'anthropomorphism remains. : . 16. 16. Our Book affords 3 examples of the ךנל!ם of the Lord; all of them are. literally, translated with πρύς: 18..10 :נעך&lt;£ל תחת !{ליו π^:] ט שמים·!) / κεμ■ τγνόφος■ κρΧ■ τγνόφος■ υπό του,ς. πόδας αυτού;, 99·5 !רוממי יה(ה אלהיני) והז^תחיו ך?ל?נ, J και προσκυνάτε τω ΰποποδίφ τ&lt;ψ&gt; ποδών αυτού; 132.7 :בו$ה. למ?וקנוקיו&gt; נשתח!ה. לקדם רנליו}&gt; ., προσκυνησομεν εις τον τόπον ου'έσβησαν 01 πόδες αυτού,ου'έσβησαν 01 πόδες αυτού. ,Γ .. . Both 18.10 and-132.7 should be enough to negate the premise that</page><page sequence="14">98 ARTHUR SOFFER [14] motion and place are denied God in the LXX (cf. Fritsch, op. cit., chap. IV). The entire idea is not to be included in this paper for a num ber of reasons: the ascription or denial of motion and place to God has little to do with anthropomorphism; it is patently incorrect to explain away any paraphrases by means of such an hypothesis in view of the numerous examples in the LXX of the Psalter of the literal translation of such phrases as בית יה{ה / אלחים and other instances of suffixed forms of בית, etc., where the reference is to God, etc.; cf. my "Critical Note" in JBL, 75 (1956), 144-5. 17. There are 6 references to the מפזם of the Lord in our Book, all of which are literally reproduced by πτέρνξ: 17.8; 36.8 63.8 ;ב?יל כנפיך; 57.2 ובצל ?נפ'ך / καΐ εν rrj σκέπτ! (57.2 σκία) των πτερύγων σου; 61-5 TW? בפתי / σκέπ-Q των πτερύγων σον· 91-4 ותחת מפיו תחסה / και υπό τ as πτέρυγας αύτοΰ έλπιεΐς. 18. In translating רוח the LXX generally used either πνεύμα or άνεμος.άνεμος. Άνεμος, which occurs 7 times in Psalms, and always as a translation of רוח, means simply "wind." The passages are: 1.4; 18.11, 43! 35-15; 83.14; 104.3; and 135.17. However, it must be noted that πνεύμα,πνεύμα, too, is used in passages where the meaning is obviously "wind," e. g., 11.6; 48.8; 103.16; 104.4; !07.25; and 148.8. ΐΐνεύμα is usually translated into English as "spirit." But since the meaning of πνεύμα πνεύμα includes the idea of "wind," it ought not be taken in a thor oughly non-material sense, but as, approximately, "breath." There are 5 instances of the רוח of the Lord in our Book. In every case רוח appears as πνεύμα: 51.13 (:ורוח ,קד?וך (אל־ת.קח מפני / καΐ το πνεύμα πνεύμα το αγών σου; 104.30 &lt;לח רוחך &lt;ז?1און#!? / έζαπεστελεΐς τό πνεύμα πνεύμα σου; 139-7 א;ה אלך&gt; &lt;?ייחך) / ά7τό του πνεύματος σον; 143·!0 (רוחך טובה (תנחני / τό πνεύμα σον τό αγαθόν; 147·!8 :#ב רוחי סלי 9זם:&gt; / πνεύσει τό πνεύμα αύτού. Had רוח been translated άνεμος in any of the above verses, the figure of speech would have been somewhat more material, almost pal pable. But anthropomorphic is one thing it would not have been. Let us put it this way: "His wind" (ריח / άνεμος) is in the same category as "His ice" and "His cold" (147.17 מ?וליך .קךח1 ?נפתים למי קךתו ם' :עפר:, / βάλλοντος κρύσταλλον αύτού ώσεί ψωμούς, κατά πρόσωπον πρόσωπον ψύχους αύτού τις ύποστήσεταύ), material things which are His, and which He sends to the world. But His πνεύμα, His "breath," is a part of Him. Although the figure of speech is less ma terial, it is anthropomorphic in a way in which His άνεμος is not. That is, the πνεύμα is a part of man; it is that which is present in a</page><page sequence="15">[15] ANTHROPOMORPHISMS IN THE SEPTUAGINT TO PSALMS 99 living man and departs from him at his death (146.4 תצא רוחו ;עב לאדמתו לאדמתו / έξελεύσεται τό πνεύμα αύτού, καΐ επίστρεφα εις την yfjv αύτού). It is in this sense that we can say that when the Lord is said to have a πνεύμα we have a kind of anthropomorphism, equivalent to the Hebrew רוח, which we do not have in an instance of the Lord's άνεμος. With the idea clearly in mind that πνεύμα is not the non-material "spirit," but bears the meaning "breath," we now turn to the two remaining verses in our Book in which π. bears a relation to the Lord: 18.16 :מ3עךר1ף ;ה{ה מנוכות רוח אפף / ό,πό έπιτιμήσεώς σου, κύριε, άπό εμπνεύσεως εμπνεύσεως πνεύματος όρΎης σου; 33-6 &lt;לךלר יה;ה #מים 5ןגעו) וברוח פיו כל־צלאם: / καΐ τω πνεύματι του στόματος αύτοΰ πασα η δύναμις αύτών.αύτών. The translation of אף by opyi] in 18.16, instead of ρις, will be discussed later (§20 below). The translation of 18.16 shows no sign of any anti-anthropomorphic tendency; 3עךחף is literally reproduced επιτιμήσεως,επιτιμήσεως,επιτιμήσεως, and נעמת, εμπνεύσεως. Obviously πνεύμα, rather than άνεμος,άνεμος, is used here and in 33.6 because in both passages ריס means "breath" rather than the "wind" which is not part of the Lord. We might compare the translation of ולרוח פיו in 33.6 with a similar ex pression in 135.17, where אף־איך;ע ריח לפיהם — the idols are described here — is rendered by ούδε yap εστίν πνεύμα 'εν τω στόματι αύτών. It is a sign of their nothing-ness that idols do not have a πνεύμα. To have avoided the use of πνεύμα in connection with God would have been much worse than anthropomorphism. 19. There are 2 instances in MT Psalms of the לב of God: 33.11 (:עצת ;ה;ה לעולם תעבוד) מחבבות לבו (ולדר ןלר) / λoyισμoi της καρδίας αύτού;αύτού; 2לף אמר ללי ביקעו 9נ; (את־פניף ;הנה אל^קע:) %.ך / σοι είπεν η καρδία μου μου 'Έ,ζήτησεν τ 6 πρόσωπόν μου, (τό πρόσωπον σου, κύριε, ζητήσω). ΈζήτησενΈζήτησενΈζήτησεν ... is the rendering preferred by Rahlfs. However, in Vaticanus (B) and Alexandrinus (A) the verse appears as έζεζήτησα τό τό πρόσωπόν σου, (τό πρόσωπόν σου, κύριε, ζητήσω). By taking the verb as έξεζήτησα, ή καρδία μου is to be taken as the heart of the Psalmist. Yet, inasmuch as the פנים of the Lord is literally repro duced twice (and in the first of these two instances פני is rendered to πρόσωπόν πρόσωπόν σου so that there can be no mistake as to whose "face" is meant,) it would be futile to attempt to see any anti-anthropomorphic tendency in accounting for the differences between BA and MT. In 55.22 there is an instance of לבי which the LXX translator takes to be the heart of the Lord although the pronominal reference is by no means certain in MT. This verse can be best understood in the context of the preceding verses: 55.20 יעמע אל וגענם ף0ב יקךם סלה אער</page><page sequence="16">100 ARTHUR SOFFER [16] :אין חלי3ות זלמ1 ולא יראו אלהים / είσακοΰσεται 6 θεός και ταπεινώσει ταπεινώσει αύτούςαύτούς ό υπάρχων προ τον αιώνων διά\//αλμα. ού yap εστίν αύτοις αντάλλαγμα, καΐ ουκ εφοβήθησαν τον θεόν. 55·21· ידי {?1ל&amp;יו Π!?Ψ :חלל ?ריתן / εζέτεινεν την χείρα αύτοΰ εν τω άποδιδόναι. έβεβή-έβεβή λωσανλωσαν την διαθήκην αύτοΰ. 55·22 · · · חלקו סךןמאת ?יו וקו־ב־לבי / διε μερίσθησανμερίσθησαν από opyrjs του προσώπου αύτοΰ και ήγγισεν ή καρδία αΰτου αΰτου . . . Periphrasis is apparent in 36.2, where ביקךב לבי = εν έαυτω; but it is the παράνομος rather than God, whose "heart" has been "avoided." In such a case everyone will agree that what we have here is simply good style; had the case involved God, however, it would have been an example of "anti-anthropomorphism" to more than a few. Chapter II. Anthropopathisms In this chapter we shall investigate the various instances of anthropo pathisms in the masoretic text of Psalms and their translation in the LXX. Our list includes only those words meaning "anger," "jealousy," "zealousness," and the like. We have not included the numerous refer enceS to the "benign" emotions of pleasure, gladness, etc., because there would certainly be no theologically motivated objection to them at the time of the translation of Psalms into Greek. We shall investigate the following anthropopathisms: ,ד!ךה ,א3ף ,אף ק1נאה ,קנאה ,בעס „ק?וף ,!עם ,?בדה ,90ה ,3ור1ן and 8.#א 20. There are 29 references to the אף of the Lord in Psalms: it ap pears as όργή in 2.5; 7.7; 18.9, 16; 21.10; 27.9; 56.8; 69.25; 76.8; 77.10; 78.21, 31, 50; 85.6; 90.7, 11; 95.11; and 110.5; and as θυμός in 2.12; 6.2; 30.6; 74.1; 78.38, 49; 85.4; and 106.40. אךך אפ:ם appears in 86.15; 103.8; and 145.8; and it is always reproduced μακρόθυμος.9 There is 8 Since the idea of anti-anthropomorphism is not involved in M.

Curiously, Buhl dies not make the same sug gestion for רגעי in 35.20. But Briggs anticipated the "oversight"; see ICC on Psalms,</page><page sequence="17">[17] ANTHROPOMORPHISMS IN THE SEPTUAGINT TO PSALMS 101 no instance whatever in the LXX of our Book to indicate avoidance of the obvious anthropopathisms inherent in the idea of the Lord's having an אף.

The term אף, which originally denoted "nostril," came to mean "anger" by the association of heavy breathing in connection with that emotion. This was true in all cases, those involving man as well as those in which God was involved. This development took place long before the composition of the LXX; it was part of the develop ment of the Hebrew language. No trace of the meaning "nostril" remains in such verses as 2.5 י־ובער כמעט אפו 2.12 ;אז ידבר אלימו באפו?; 6.2 קומה יהןה באפך ך.ך ;:הןה אל־באפף תוכיחני; etc. Of the 29 times that אף is used in connection with the Lord, 26 are instances where אף clearly means "anger" rather than "nostril"; and the translator has correctly used bpyi] or θυμός. The 3 other instances are: 18.9, 16; and 74.1. In the last case, to have translated the phrase עשן אפך: with pis καπνίζβιν would not have conveyed the meaning as well as does the usage which our translator did employ, viz., 74.1: (למה אלדזים !נחת לנצח) ;עשן אפך בצאן מרעיקך: / (IVα τί άπώσω, ό debs, ehτέλος,) ώργίσθη ό θυμός σου έτι πρόβατα νομής σου. Although the.anthropomorphism ("nostril") is not present here in therGreekL there*is■ ample reason to doubt that this is due to anti-anthropomorphism on ,the part of the translator. First, the absence of any evidence for' antiranthrppomor phism in his handling of the anthropomorphicdigiures of speech we reviewed in the previous chapter, e. g. "Land," 'Tyes,":"ears,", etc., and including פעמיך = xetpas in 74.3. Second,· the expression עשן אפך: is used by the Psalmist as a parallel to 5חת|; the: idea of, "anger" is much more' important to the parallelism than the literal figure of speech. Third, we are not dealing with the word אף alone, but with an idiom consisting of 2· words, ',יעשן . אפך and what is a perfectly under standable idiom in Hebrew might be far from: clearrijin Greek or any other language. Not only the LXX translator, but many other, trans la tors not concerned at all־ with the problem of. anthropomorphism have quite naturally, and correctly,'associated ,אף :with the idea of "anger" rather than literally "nostril", e. g., AV and JPS ,"why doth • - ■ X י■ JJJi: »V* "ן• ז V :•■י• יד• ו V ; ■ , P• 3'3■ Cf.

In short, the use of οργή for אף in 74.1 was motivated by stylistic rather than theological considerations. With regard to 18.9 and 16, we cannot say that other translators have used periphrasis. AV, JPS, Luther, etc., translate אף literally in these 2 cases; the LXX translator chose "anger". But that does not mean (as Flashar believes it does, Ζ AW, 21, p. 260) that anti-anthro pomorphism is involved. The contrary can be shown to be the case: in 18.7 אן{יו? was spelled out more literally than usual, eis τά ώτα αύτου; in 18.10 רגליו was reproduced literally rovs 7τόδαε αΰτου; קילו in 18.14 was also rendered without any attempt to avoid the anthropomorphism. Consequently, we can rule out anti-anthropo morphism as a factor in our translator's use of όργή for אף in 18.9, 16. But we cannot rule out style simply because modern translators have found no difficulty with a literal rendering. It is not unlikely that our translator used οργή in 18.9 to parallel ו־י־דוךה לו / ότι ώρΎ'ισθη αύτοΐς 66 debs in the preceding verse; similarly in 18.16 όργή may well have been used as a parallel to מ3עךתך / από ίπιτιμήσβώϊ σου. The above suggestions are no more than tentative, and are made only in an at tempt to find a reason for our translator's use of όργή in the very few cases where אף seems to bear the meaning "nostrils" in MT, a problem which is not really within the scope of this paper inasmuch as we have already ruled out the hypothesis of anti-anthropomorphism. In view of the entire discussion of this problem, Fritsch's observations on this problem in the Pentateuch seem colored by the need to find evi dence for anti-anthropomorphism even in places where it doesn't exist: (op.(op. cit., p. 12): "The Seventy accepted and translated the secondary meaning of this word, using the words οργή and dvpos, thus obscuring the physical association." One might wonder why the LXX translator should find it necessary to "obscure" (deliberately, one would suppose) the physical meaning of אף when, as Fritsch readily admits (idem, p. 15), "in most cases the translators literally rendered the anthropo morphisms of the Hebrew text." His other hypothesis, the "LXX's consistent adherence to a definite pattern of translation," is not valid for Psalms; where our translator felt that "nostril" was the meaning, he did not hesitate to use pis rather than οργή: 115.6 :אף לדום (לא ;!־יחון / pivaspivas ίχουσιν και ουκ όσφρανθήσονται. To have followed a "con sistent adherence to a definite pattern of translation" would have meant to use οργή here. But since this would not have provided the proper contrast with ילא לריחין / και ούκ όσψρανθήσονται, our trans lator quite naturally and correctly employed pis.</page><page sequence="19">[19] ANTHROPOMORPHISMS IN THE SEPTUAGINT TO PSALMS 103 21.

Όργί^ειρ is used also to translate the verbs עשן and ריב with the Lord as subject.10 80.5 (:ה{ה אלהיט בבאות עד־מתי עשנת ובתפלת עקך; / κύριε ό θεός των δυνάμεων, 'έως πότε opyi^r!

As with אנף the translator has used όργιζεip: 18.8 :נזתןע*»ו&gt; פי־ווךה לו&gt; / (και έσαλεύθησαν)έσαλεύθησαν) ότι ώpyίσθη αύτούς ό θεός; 106.40 יחר־אף ;ה!ה ?עפו],/ και ώpyίσθη θυμω κύριος επί τον λαόν αύτού. Note that in 18.8 the translator added αύτούς ό θεός for reasons of style, so providing the verb with a subject and an object. Clearly, the stylistic consideration was more important to him than the anthro popathism of the verb; otherwise he would hardly have gratuitously stressed stressed that its subject was ό θεός.12 A similar consideration underlies his treatment of ניזתר־אף ;ה{ה in 106.40, where he takes יהןה to be the subject rather than His אף, which he renders as 0υμφ13 (instead of θυμός θυμός κυρίου). The Targum, which usually avoids anthropopathisms, renders this verse ,Π יתקיף רוקה· We might add that the LXX transla tion of יחר־אף! as ώpyίσθη θυμω is not to be accounted for by the presence of the maqqef connecting the two words; a similar transla 10 In 104.32 and 144-5, where the subject is "mountains," ]0ע appears as xa7r viÇtiv. עען never appears with man as subject. ריב — SmàÇtiv in 35.1; 43• 1; and 74.22. But 2'l = KpLve1v in 119.154. There are no other instances of ריב in our Book. 11 11 It may be observed here that prjvitiv is also used for נטר in Lev. 19.18, where God is not involved, and in Jer. 3.12, where God is involved.

There are 5 instances of the חרון of the Lord in our Book. It is always reproduced literally, either by οργή or by θυμός: 2.5 (אז ידבר 1ליםו באפו) ובחרונו ;בהלמו:&lt; / (τότβ λαλήσει, προς αύτοΐς εν οργή αύτου,) και και εν τω θυμω αύτού ταράξει, αυτούς; 69.25 :וחרון אפף :שעם./ και ό θυμός θυμός της οργής σου καταλάβοι αυτούς; 78-49 ישלרדבם זחריו א5י / έξαπεστείλενέξαπεστείλεν εις αυτούς όργήν θυμού αύτου; 85.4 :דעשיבוות מחרין א|ך / ά7τά7τέστρεφας από οργής θυμού σου; 88.17 עלי עברו חרונ^ףי / έπ' έμε διήλθονδιήλθον αϊ όργαί σοι14.' 24. The חמה of the Lord appears in 10 instances in Psalms: 6.2; 38.2; 59.14; 76.11; 78.38; 79.6; 88.8; 89.47; 90.7; and 106.23. It is rendered οργή ך times, θυμός twice (88.8; 90.7), and ένθύμιον once (76.11). The usual translation, with חסה = όργή, may be illustrated by 6.2: :יהןה אל־באפף תוכיחני ואל־בחמתף ס:סרני / κύριε, μή τω θυμω σου έλέγξηςέλέγξης με, μηδέ τή οργή σου παώεύσης με. The same translation is given for 38.2: יהןה אל־בזקצפף תוליחני ובחמיזף סנסרני; the translator used μηδε μηδε to express the second negation which the Hebrew Psalmist simply left implied. In the following example, the translator's understanding of the syntax is different from that of MT; but the anthropopathism re mains: 59.13, 14 ומ^לה ומכחש יספרו: כלה בחמה כלה וא'נטו / καί έξ αράς καΐκαΐ \[/εύδους διαγγελήσονται. συντέλειαι έν οργή συντέλειας, και ούού μή ύπάρξωσιν. The translator uses θυμός for חסה in the following two instances: 90.7 :כי־כלעו באפף&gt; ובחמהף נבקלנו) / (ότι έξελίπομεν έν τή οργή σου,) και και έν τω θυμω σου έταράχθημεν; 88.8 עלי סמכה חמתף / έπ' έμε έπεσ τερίχθητερίχθη ό θυμός σου. ένθύμιένθύμιένθύμιον is used for חסה twice in 76.11 (incidentally the sole instances of ένθύμιον in the entire LXX): כי־חמת אךם ת1ידך, שארית חמת תלזנר: / ότι ένθύμιον άνθρωπου έξομολογήσεταί σοι, και έγκατά λειμμαλειμμα ένθυμίου εορτάσει σοι. The meaning of this verse is obscure in the Hebrew; the translation also presents problems. However, that anti-anthropopathism is no factor here can be seen in the fact that 4י In the following verse we find an anthropopathism in the LXX for which there is no correspondent in the Hebrew: 58.10 :3םו־ד1י ?:מרחרון ןק1עךנו : / wad ÇCivto.s cchael eu àpyrj KarairitTaL ùpâs. The translator fails to understand חרון as contrasting with ,PI, and gives us instead an adverbial use of 3חרון. The fact that the subject of Karaxferai is the Lord makes iv opyfj refer to Him, (though there is some possibility that it refers to the objects of the verb).</page><page sequence="21">[21] ANTHROPOMORPHISMS IN THE SEPTUAGINT TO PSALMS 105 there is no distinction in the translations of חמת אךם and the חמת with which the Lord will be girt; both are translated ύνθύμιον. 25.25. The עבךה of the Lord occurs 4 times in our Book: 78.49; 85.4; 90.9 and 11. It appears as όρ-γή in the first two of these instances, and as θυμός in the last two, e. g., 78.49 מולח־^ם חרון אפו&gt; עכךה וזעם וצך,ה:) / (έ£α7τεστειλευ els αυτούς opyr/v θυμού αυτού,) θυμόν και opyrjv και ΘΧίφιν; 90.11 :זמי־יודע ע' וליו־אחך ע3ךתף / (τις γιυώσκει τό κράτος κράτος της opyrjs σου) και ά7τό του φόβου σου τον θυμόν σου. 26.26. There are 4 instances of the עם! of the Lord in our Book (38.4; 69.25; 78.49; and 102.11); it is consistently translated opyrj, e. g., 38.4 ואין מתם כבערי) מפני !עמך / (ουκ εστιυ ΐασις ev τη σαρκί μου) άπόάπό προσώπροσώπροσώτου της opyrjs σου; 69.25 עפך עליהם זעמף / εκχεου 67r' αυτούς την την opyr\v σου. The present participle occurs once in Psalms: 7.12 (אלחים 0ופט צדיק) ואל זעם ככל יום: / (ό θβός κριτής δίκαιος,) και Ισχυρός και μακρόθυμοςμακρόθυμος μη opyrjv eπάyωv καθ' έκάστην ημέραν. While it may be true that this translation does not present the anthropopathism present in MT (i. e., ואל זעם) the difference can hardly be attributed to a deliberate change on the part of the translator (as Baethgen, p. 597; M. Flashar, pp. 264-5). Lor, if he meant to avoid or soften anthro popathisms, why should he do so only here, with the verb, but not with the nouns in the four instances of עם! cited above? A more plausible explanation may be found in his having read ואל for MT ואל, a phenomenon which also occurs in 90.2, 3: :ומעולם עד־עולם אתה אל תעב אנוע עד־ד,פא / και ά7τό του αιώνος βως του αιώνος σύ el. μη άποστρύψηςάποστρύψης ανθρωπον eis ταπβίνωσιν. 27. קצף, is attributed to the Lord 3 times in our Book; in every in stance it is reproduced literally. It appears twice as a noun, and is translated by θυμός: 38.2 ןהןה אל־בקצפף תוכיחני / κύριε μη τω θυμω σου σου ekeyfos με; 102.11 מפני !עמך וקצפף /άττό ■προσώπου της opyrjs σον σον και τού θυμού σου. In 106.32 קצף, is attributed to the Lord inasmuch as He is the object of the verb: 106.32 קציפו על־מי מריבה:] / και πapώpyισav αύτόν έ&lt;ρ' ύδατος άντιλογίας. 28.28. The כעס of the Lord occurs once in Psalms; it is reproduced literally as θυμός: 85.5 :וחפר כעקך עפנו / και άπόστρεψον τον θυμόν σου σου άφ' ημών. In 2 instances, כעס is attributed to God inasmuch as He is the object of the verb: 78.58 כעיסוהו ככטעזם!] / και πapώpyισav αύτόν ev τούς βουνοΐς αύτών; 106.29 יכעיסוהו 1ימעללי,הם (ות?דץ ?ם.!</page><page sequence="22">106 ARTHUR SOFFER [22] (:מנקה / και παρώξυναν αυτόν εν rots e7τιτηδεύμασιν αυτών, (καΐ επληθύνθηέπληθύνθη εν αύτοΐς η 7ττώσΐϊ). 29. קנאה is attributed to the Lord twice in our Book and reproduced literally: 78.58 :ולקסיליהם לקניאוהו: / καί ev τοις 7λυ7ttols αυτών παρεζήλωσανπαρεζήλωσαν αυτόν-, 79-5 :תלער לםרא&lt;2 ק?אס1ד / έκκαυθήσεται ώς 7rvp ό ζήλός σου. 30. God's אה# is mentioned, and literally translated, twice in Psalms: 5.6 :נאל לל־לעלי און!? / έμίσησας (Β, Α, κύριε) ττάντας τους epya ζουμένουζουμένουζουμένους την άνομίαν) ; 11.5 :יהןה צדיק ללחן ןך&lt;ןוע ןאד!ב קומם ק!נאה נקעו / κύριοί βξβτάζβ l τον δίκαιον και τον άσεβη, 6 δε ay απών άδικίαν μισεί μισεί την εαυτου φυχήν. The translator considered the pronominal reference of נפ0ו to be אהב חמס rather than הלה;: and he took אהב דומם to be the subject of the verb. MT ונאה? requires a feminine subject, which is supplied by However, if the translator read נא», itfpj would then have to be taken as the object of the verb, and its pronom inal reference would have to be 0אהב דומ. In any case, we may rule out the possibility of a deliberate anti-anthropopathism here in view of 5.6 above, and in view of the following instance, in which the translator takes the subject of the verb to be the Lord, as against the Psalmist who is certainly the subject in MT: 31.7 את, ה'2!םךים הללי &lt;ןןא# / εμί σησαςσησας τους διαφυ\άσσοντα$ ματαιότητας δια κενής. Buhl, in ΒΗ3, would emend as אל# on the basis of 1 Ms. and Versions. So, too, Baethgen (JPT, 8, p. 62). As he also points out in his Handkommentar, die die Psalmen (Gottingen 1904) p. 86, the second person gives more meaning to the following לאני. Whether the Vorlage was second person or first person, the fact remains that the LXX translator did not shrink from attributing the emotion of hatred to God. Conclusions A. Although there may be an exegetical pattern in the LXX trans lation of Psalms, it would seem that anti-anthropomorphism and anti-anthropopathism played no part in that pattern. Indeed, the translator usually rendered the anthropomorphisms and anthropo pathisms literally, and occasionally rendered some (such as ,לאזני מקני ,לעיני, and מלקני) even more literally than was necessary. B. It would also appear that the LXX of Psalms is the work of a single translator; we found no significant differences in vocabulary or</page><page sequence="23">[23] ANTHROPOMORPHISMS IN THE SEPTUAGINT TO PSALMS 107 style within the 150 Psalms. In spite of occasional lapses, the translator seems to have had a very good knowledge of the Hebrew language. C. The differences between MT and LXX are not always the result either of deliberate mistranslation or mistaken interpretation; in some instances they are due to differences between MT and the trans lator's Vorlage. Although great caution ought to be taken before emending MT on the basis of a conjectural reconstruction of the LXX Vorlage,Vorlage, it is not always unwarranted to do so (e. g., 42.6, 7 discussed in section la).</page></plain_text>
