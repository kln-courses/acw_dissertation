<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE MULLER AMICTA SOLE AND HER ATTENDANTS AN EPISODE IN LATE MEDIEVAL FINNISH ART* By Anthony Cutler Asin other European countries, the wall-painting of medieval Finland became the subject of scholarly attention as a result of attempts to conserve its disappearing remnants. The first accounts of this church art were written by restorers who covered the painting with plaster, copied the original on this new layer and then speculated on the style and national origins of the painters whose work they had 'reproduced'.1 Studies of the art and architec- ture of particular churches followed, written either by their restorers or in- tended as guide-books for visitors.2 But no historical study of the art of the late Middle Ages, comparable to the work of Tristram in England or Male in France, was produced until 1937 when L. Wennervirta's Suomen keskiaikainen kirkkomaalaus laid the foundations for the serious research that has been pursued since the war.3 At the same time there has begun the work of un- doing the nineteenth-century restoration that still impedes the study of such churches as Rauma (P1. 34a) and many other important monuments. No corpus of Finnish mural decoration exists.4 However, even when such a necessary tool is produced, it will be difficult to answer the stylistic questions that so greatly exercised students at the beginning of this century. The Church of Finland in the fourteenth, fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, quite apart from its participation in the ecclesiastical province of Denmark, was subject to decisions made in Stockholm, Gotland, the Hanseatic cities and the Teutonic states on the Baltic. Its art reflects all these influences, often within one region of the country, sometimes within one church. The task of unravel- ling this complex skein is not helped by random assertions of stylistic similarity between one particular group of figures in a Finnish wall-painting and some other group in Uppland, Luibeck or elsewhere until the commercial, ecclesias- tical and political relations between these regions are better understood. If, as Meinander asserted, decorations of south-western Finnish churches 'were influenced by Swedish models, even, probably, executed by Swedish artists or by Germans of the school working in Sweden',5 then explanation of the extraordinary iconographical divagations that occur in these churches has still to be found. Little attention has been paid to motifs such as God the Father or the Trinity which regularly appear in the Finnish art of this period * I am grateful to Miss Aune Krohn for help in the preparation of this paper.

Study of this iconography may perhaps provide clues to the sources of this art, where stylistic analogies remain, for the most part, unsubstantiated hypotheses. Of several themes found frequently on the walls of Finnish churches, but almost nowhere else in northern Europe, perhaps the most enlightening is the Apoca- lyptic Woman found in company with Octavian and the Sibyl (Pls. 35a and 34b) as well as with more conventional biblical and apocryphal personages. I Unaccompanied by these figures, indeed in the solitary splendour that she enjoys in earlier Finnish representations (P1. 33a-d), the Woman Dressed in the Sun (Rev. xii, I) has a long and well-documented history.6 The literary identification of the mulier amicta sole with the Virgin is at least as old as the sixth-century commentary on the Apocalypse of Primasius of Hadru- metum.7 But not until the high Middle Ages did the substitution of Mary for the figure previously held to represent the Church gain general acceptance among exegetists. The earliest examples, in manuscript illustration8 and monumental painting,9 however, represent the Apocalyptic Woman as the Virgin. The lack of any doctrinal framework within which the image might have found a place and precise significance probably contributed to the iconographical variety that attends the type before the fifteenth century. The only unvarying element is the identification of the Woman of St. John's vision with Mary, an interpretation that resulted in the adoption of several Byzantine aspects of the Mother of God. Thus, in Italian twelfth-century painting, the mulier amicta sole is frequently prostrate on a bed in an attitude resembling the Virgin of the Nativity,10 while a century later, in a Flemish miniature, she has become the Blacherniotissa, the Child in her womb surrounded by the sun's rays.11 This last example, the Woman standing on the crescent moon and sur- rounded by the sun, is recognized by Mrs. Levi d'Ancona as 'the first instance of an iconography which was to become very popular in later periods and (which) in the end was to supersede all other representations of the Immacu- late Conception'.12 But it is necessary to recall the great diversity of postures and situations in which the Woman was placed before this type became established in the sixteenth century.

The very lack of representational definition permitted eclectic borrowing of attributes from a host of sources. The opportunity for syncretistic treatment that made possible her early identification with the Virgin did not exclude other interpretations. Of these perhaps the most celebrated is Dante's midday vision of the dead Beatrice, wearing the crimson garment in which he had first seen her, but now transfigured in glory.1i Even after the late fifteenth century, when the mulier amicta sole had become an emblem of the Immaculate Conception,19 her iconographical setting, the aureole that surrounds her and the Child, are all continually transformed following, we must suppose, equally varied prototypes and models (Pls. 33b; 34a, b; 35a). The only accord between these highly diverse images of the Woman is in the absence of any sign of war in heaven. The dragon and St. Michael, major elements in the earlier, narrative accounts of the Apocalyptic scene, are here eliminated and attention is concentrated exclusively on the sun-dressed figure. That this iconographical compression was the work of Franciscan Immaculists is now established.20 From the late fourteenth century the mulier amicta sole, with no company save that of her Son, served to illustrate prayers to the Virgin Immaculate,21 and we know that the use of these prayers extended at least as far as Sweden.22 The penetration of such devotions into the northern lands was far from an accident of piety. Even before the Union of Kalmar in 1397 both the papacy and the royal house of Sweden had recognized the value of the Grey Friars as agents in the conversion and pacification of half-pagan Finland. Queen Margaret's foundation of the Franciscan monastery at Viipuri in 1403 was followed within the year by gifts to the house from Boniface IX and the appointment of its abbot as inquisitor of the entire Scandinavian province.23 From 1412 successive bishops of Turku, often in opposition to the Finnish national church, played the role of Swedish representative in their own 14 Bamberg, A II. 42, fol. 29.

But of greater significance for the history of art was their continuing relationship with continental Europe. Bishop Maunu II Tavast (1412-50) was a frequent attendant at Rome and became a supporter of the Conciliar idea at Constance. Increasing numbers of Finnish students attended French and German universities in the fifteenth century and a Finn, Olavi Maunun- poika, was rector of the University of Paris in 1436.24 As such, he represented the university at the Council of Basle in 1438, when the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception was declared a dogma of faith. Finns were as close to this aspect of Franciscan devotion as any nation in northern Europe and this is reflected above all in the decoration of their churches. The plethora of Finnish Immaculist iconography is dated, almost without exception, to within a generation of Sixtus IV's introduction in 1476 and 1480 of two Offices of the Immaculate Conception.25 The first occurrence of this theme on Finnish soil, the Apocalyptic Woman carved in birch (P1. 33a) has been assigned to the early fifteenth century. Because of its material, Jaakko Puokka has insisted on its Finnish origin on the grounds that if it were 'central European' it would have been of oak or lime.26 It would be more pertinent to inquire if the statuette were from Sweden, where birch was plentiful and frequently used in the second half of the century to make images of the mulier amicta sole. No other figure of this type is known to have been made in Sweden or Finland before c. 1460. But from the last third of the fifteenth century numerous Swedish examples exist with similar stylistic characteristics.27 The Woman, holding the naked Child in her right hand, is dressed in a maphorion and high-waisted tunic. Her head is un- naturally large (about one-fifth of the figure's overall height) and has a wide, smooth forehead below a low crown. Full drapery reaches to the feet, although a shoe is exposed and, below it, a smiling human face set in the crescent moon. This last feature is, again, distinctive: no Finnish representation of this theme has the anthropomorphic moon, although the peculiarity does appear in an altar-piece of north German workmanship of about 1420 (P1. 35b). Where the heavenly bodies do appear in Finnish wall-painting, they seem to be rendered for their value as pattern. This is especially remarkable at Finstrom (Ahvenanmaa) where the artist has obviously appreciated the opportunities for a well-balanced design offered by the moon, the sun's rays and the double aureole (P1. 2). The sunbeams form radii emanating from the focal point of 24 For the presence of Finnish students and professors at foreign universities in this period, see A.

The picture is closest, both iconographic- ally and geographically, to Scandinavian versions of the same motif. In this island church, less than fifty miles from the Swedish coast, Jesus is clothed. With the exception of the image in stained glass from Nauvo (P1. 35c), the Child is always naked in Finnish illustrations of the theme. In this detail, as in the symmetrical disposition of the Virgin within the crescent, the Finstrom fresco28 resembles such Swedish compositions as the mulier amicta sole in Hirkeberga church (Uppland) painted by Albertus Pictor about 1480.29 The dating of the Finnish picture is problematical although, on the basis of the draperies of the Apocalyptic Woman and of her neighbours, St. Catherine of Alexandria and St. Barbara, Wennervirta would relate it to the St. Anne painted in the chapel of St. Catherine in Turku cathedral before 1470.3o The Finstr6m image may well have been painted between 1450 and 1460 when Olavi Maununpoika was bishop of Turku and Swedish painting was most influential in that city and the archipelago stretching to the west. Without doubt it is a product of the period before the new Offices of the Immaculate Conception reached Finland. Strictly speaking, this doctrine has reference only to the Virgin and St. Anne and in representing it the Child is not immediately relevant.31 Yet in only one instance in Finnish painting is the mulier amicta sole portrayed without her Son. This is at Pyhtai, a church decorated throughout in a popular manner that bears little relation to the main stream of fifteenth-century painting (P1. 33c). The elegant krapukiemurat ('crayfish curlicues')32 that con- tinued to fill the interstices between Finnish vault-ribs until the Reformation have here degenerated into sets of childish scribbles. Equally naive are the figures and especially the Virgin, rendered in a purely linear manner in a crown and tunic that are travesties of the traditional representation. The rays of the sun alone-here a consequence of the fascination with geometrical shapes that characterizes the style-serve to identify the figure. The restora- tion of Pyhtai in i95i enables us to observe the folk version of a motif that occurs with increasing frequency toward the end of the century.33 The presence of the mulier amicta sole in this church permits, in addition, some estimate of the figure's popularity at this time. The representation at Pyhthia is the easternmost appearance of the Apocalyptic Woman in Finland. It is also, not surprisingly, furthest from any hint of Swedish influence. Three hundred miles to the west at Kumlinge, in the archipelago that reaches towards Sweden, she appears in a quite different form (P1. 33b). The Church of St. Anne is filled with female saints most of which, high in the vaults, escaped damage at the hands of Russian soldiers in 28 The Finstrdm fresco, as all medieval mural decoration in this country, was painted in fresco secco.

Both the iconography and the manner of these murals are exceptional in Finnish art. Nowhere else are there to be seen these tall, slender figures with their small heads and narrow hands with long fingers. The Virgin stands on a whitish moon dressed in a rose-red and violet cape lined with yellow and a white undergarment. Her crown, hair and nimbus are yellow as are the sunbeams that radiate from her. Despite her somewhat dour expression, the figure in its original state must have been a justly resplendent image of the Woman Dressed in the Sun. Dark contours define bright areas of colour, a tech- nique not unknown in Swedish painting. At Edebo, in Uppland, decorated by Albertus Pictor and Peter in i514, similar forms were created.34 But more probable as an immediate source of both the form and content of the pictures at Kumlinge is some fifteenth-century woodcut.35 The linear mannerism of Kumlinge is equally evident in the unique repre- sentation of the Apocalyptic Woman in Finnish stained glass (P1. 35c). In a fragment of grisaille from Nauvo, now in the National Museum at Helsinki,36 her waist-length hair flows over her shoulders in serpentine rhythm echoed in the sunbeams. The figure, as at Kumlinge, is excessively tall although the sumptuous folds of the drapery here suggest a fullness not present in the fresco. In both instances, the manner of rendering the shadows by means of line rather than colour suggests an origin in incunabula, an impression reinforced by the treatment of the ground. The striated lines of the window are replaced in the fresco by stylized tufts of grass no more naturalistic than the flowers growing from the parti-coloured ribs about it. A multiplicity of sources for these decorations is suggested by the variety of ways in which the Child is held. The mulier amicta sole, in almost every com- position, wears a crown over her waist-length hair. She is dressed fairly consistently in some variation of the late Gothic mantle and tunic. Yet in no two examples does she hold her baby in the same manner. The Child lies in a playful, oblique position (P1. 34a) or sits upright on the Virgin's forearm in an attitude recalling the Byzantine Glykophilousa (P1. 35c). He is held either in her right or her left arm and sometimes, especially in the later examples (Pls. 34a, b; 35a), with both hands. Similarly, the setting in which the Woman appears differs radically from one representation to another. While the sun's rays are a major element in every instance save Lohja (P1. 35a), the presence of the moon is by no means constant. But most indicative of the complex origins of the Finnish Apoca- lyptic Woman is the variety of positions which she assumes. She appears full- length or in bustate form, seated or standing, according to no fixed icono- graphical schema or chronological development. In Finland at least, the mulier amicta sole does not follow the evolution from standing figure to half- length form that has been suggested for this motif.37 This diversity is the more surprising if the contemporaneity of our last three examples is accepted. The images of the Woman Dressed in the Sun &amp; Cf. K. Asplund, Edebo kyrkas mdlningar.

It is difficult to believe, however, that the mulier amicta sole in the Franciscan Church of the Holy Cross at Rauma is not part of a larger programme. In the choir vault, the only section of the decoration that survives, she is sur- rounded by the Ancestors of Christ. Nygren has pointed to the Jesse tree as an image related to the Immaculate Conception: the vigil service for the feast in honour of this doctrine employs the text of the Messiah's genealogy (Matt. i, 2-I6).40 The Franciscan theme of the Passion as Redemption is here represented by the collection of Christ's blood in chalices,41 a scene set directly above the Apocalyptic Woman. But in churches not belonging to the mendicant order, such as Hattula, her place in the tree is taken by the Crucifixion itself, the wood of the Cross growing directly out of the sleeping Jesse;42 and here no angels gather to collect the blood of the Redeemer. Until the nineteenth-century overpainting is removed at Rauma it will be difficult to propose any convincing stylistic analogies between this church and those at Lohja and Hattula.43 Rather, iconographical similarities and varia- tions in these churches suggest a relationship deriving from the cult of St. Francis. The veneration of Christ's wounds at Rauma is replaced with the scene of the saint's stigmatization.44 And in harmony with this Franciscan emphasis is a novel concentration on the early life of Jesus and of the Virgin. These narratives supplant the more purely decorative forms of fifteenth- century Finnish wall-painting. In the south aisle of the church of St. Lawrence at Lohja the Apocalyptic Woman appears in a new guise (P1. 35a). On a wreath of clouds at the head of a cross, her half-length image with the Child in her hands is observed by two figures who salute the apparition. A similar scene occurs beside the window in the choir at Hattula (P1. 34b). The female figure, standing nearer to the Woman and Child, points out the vision to the bearded personage beside her. At Hattula the Virgin appears to rest on the sun-disk which floats above the curvature of the earth marvellously adorned with stylized vegetable forms. Neither moon nor clouds surround her yet there is little reason to doubt that this is one type of the mulier amicta sole. Historians of Finnish painting have not failed to recognize her witnesses here as Octavian and the Tiburtine Sibyl.45 This interpretation is confirmed 38 Wennervirta, SKK, p. 140; Radz-Pylk- kinen, pp. 256-9.

Anna at Venice47 and the picture painted for Catherine de Medici by Auguste Caron now in the Louvre.48 Yet the sources of these representations at Hattula and Lohja have been left curiously unexplored. This is the more remarkable in that the theme is quite unknown in Swedish art. Any determination of these sources might throw valuable light on the vexed question of the origins of early sixteenth-century painting in Finland and incidentally illuminate artistic relations between northern Europe and those southern lands where Sibylline illustration had a much older history. II More than sixty years ago, Emile Male realized that the proliferation of sibyls in European seicento art could be traced to the printed book, the only medium of artistic communication capable of producing so rapid and wide- spread a diffusion of the motif.49 He drew attention to the editio princeps of Lactantius printed at Subiaco in 1465 and to Ficino's use of this early Christian rehabilitation of the sibyls.50 A full history and description of the pagan prophetesses was provided in 1481 by Filippo de'Barbieri, a Sicilian Domini- can, who set out to reconcile the differing opinions of St. Jerome and St. Augustine concerning these 'witnesses' to the truth of the Messiah's advent.51 The employment of this source by Ghirlandaio, Botticelli, Raphael, Michelangelo and others was suggested at length by Male.52 But these works and their north European successors53 served to exploit an already subsisting interest in the seers of classical antiquity rather than to bring it into being. In fact, since the eleventh century, the theme had not been entirely absent from European art and literature.54 Representations of the sibyls at Sessa Aurunca and S. Angelo in Formis55 and a lost mosaic at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem56 owed much to Augustine's discourse on the Erythrean sibyl's prophecy of the birth of Christ57 and more to a fifth- or sixth-century sermon on the same subject falsely attributed to the saint.58 This erroneous attribution seems to have been due to the sermon's conclusion in the first lines of the Erythrean's song: 46 A.

Both these eleventh-century examples of Sibylline illustration quote from this text. But the sermon's impact was to be felt further afield than Campania. Karl Young, in his study of its liturgical application, showed that a lectio derived from the sermon was regularly recited during the Christmas office at least as early as the twelfth century and as late as the sixteenth in France, Germany, Italy and Spain.59 Nor was this lectio the final form of the prophecy in European literature. From about 1325 the mystery of the Nativit6 nostre seigneur Jhesu Christ was played at Paris every Christmas for about a hundred years. Its editor suggested that the pseudo-Augustinian sermon was as much responsible for its content as the Protoevangelium Jacobi, whose concentration on the life of Mary and the childhood of Jesus is more familiar as a source of medieval religious drama.60 From our point of view the salient feature of the play is the group of scenes which depict the emperor Caesar, his servant Sartan and the 'Sdbile' who shames them with a sun-girt vision of the Virgin and Child and prophesies the downfall of idols at the time of the Nativity.61 The play ends with Caesar's recognition that 'De moy est nez un plus grant sire' and his vow to erect an altar on the site of his vision.62 At least by the middle of the fourteenth century, then, the motif of the mulier amicta sole had merged with the celebrated legend of the Ara Coeli. The roots of the myth that Augustine was a witness to the truth of the Christ born during his Principate are difficult to discern. Suetonius63 and Orosius64 both describe the flatteries bestowed on the young ruler by an admiring Senate and people and both accounts were much studied in the high Middle Ages.65 In the East the legend was already amplified by the sixth century. John Malalas recounted Octavian's request to the Pythia concerning his successor and the response that it would be a Hebrew child.66 This story is repeated by Suidas67 and Cedrenus.68 But in the West, before the end of the twelfth century, the Mirabilia Urbis Romae recorded that the answer to Augustus consisted of the Erythrean's familiar lines 'Iudicii signum...'.69 Quite how this conflation of Augustinian quotation and familiar legend 69 The Drama of the Medieval Church, I933, pp. 125-36.

Indeed not later than the early thirteenth century, the Mirabilia was inserted as a quasi-official document in the library of the Curia.70 The Papacy in its plenitudo potestatis retrospectively took to itself both the imperial benefaction of the Ara Coeli and its Sibylline implications. While the Mirabilia's European diffusion produced chronicles in which Sibilla became a proper name,71 generally the seer was identified as the Tiburtine. Octavian's inspiration was almost universally recognized as Rome's local prophetess.72 The Christmas associations of the pseudo-Augustinian lectio were revived as German chroniclers reported how, on the night of the Nativity, this sibyl revealed to the emperor a vision of the Virgin with the Child in her arms raised above the moon.73 The legend in its most developed form-extending, that is, from an account of the Roman senate's wish to deify Octavian to his erection of the Ara filii Dei after the vision-is included in the Chronicum of Martinus Polonus written about I268.74 In the thirteenth century the name Ara Coeli was apparently not yet in use. In his researches on the history of Roman churches Huelsen was unable to find a document employing this name older than 1323. Before this, and since the seventh century, the sanctuary beside the Camera Octaviani was always called S. Maria in Capitolio.75 We are faced, then, with what appears to be a deliberate attempt to renew interest in an old legend. Some time in the course of the thirteenth century the myth was localized at the ancient church on the Capitol and, within a few generations, a body of literature concerning the cult was being produced in the north. It seems probable that this is to be associated with the Franciscan movement and particularly with the Order's reconstruction of the church in 1250.76 The task of propagating the story of Octavian's vision was performed by German versions of the Mirabilia,77 where the scene of the Sibyl's revelation was identified as S. Maria in Aracoeli. An old myth had been resurrected to create an entirely new object of pilgrimage. That the theme was not developed to its fullest extent until this date is suggested by the iconography of an early twelfth-century mosaic in the church which survived long enough for Muratori to describe and draw 7o G.

The Sibyl was notably absent and thus the scene conformed more closely to Byzantine versions of the legend than to the later, Latin account.79 The Sibyl appears but remains unnamed in the Legenda Aurea, the sixth chapter of which, De nativitate Domini, is a compilation of the myths discussed above.s0 It is, however, much more concerned than earlier versions of the story with the celestial apparition itself. Rather than expatiate on the emperor's behaviour or the Sibyl's original suggestion that he turn his eyes towards the sky, it describes the Virgin with the Child on her knees sitting on a star and visible in broad daylight. This shift of emphasis led Gregorovius to derive the name Ara Coeli from aureo caelo.81 While there is no evidence to support this intuition, certainly from about I3oo Italian artists began to associate Octavian's vision with that of St. John's mulier amicta sole. The Woman Dressed in the Sun became identified with the Virgin and an entirely new motif manifested itself in painting and, later, in book illustration. We are hindered in our understanding of this development by the loss of some important monuments. For example, Vasari records a fresco of Cavallini in the apse of the Aracoeli in Rome, 'la migliore opera che in quella citti facesse'.,2 This depicted the Virgin in a nimbus of light with her Son on her arm shown to Octavian by the Sibyl.83 In honour of this image, if not of the earlier mosaic, a special rubric was included in the daily liturgy of the church on the Capitol: Stellato hic in circulo Sibyllae tunc oraculo te vidit Rex in caelo: o mater Christi, dirige nos, et ad bonum erige pulso maligno telo. A witness to this service, visiting the church in 1906, recorded how the emperor and the sibyl still appeared among the wax figures which at Christ- mas turned the Camera Octaviani (now the Cappella Santa) into the manger at Bethlehem.84 From Vasari's description of the fresco in this chapel it seems probable that the Virgin adored by the emperor was represented as the mulier amicta sole. In France as early as the eleventh century she had appeared in this fashion.85 But in French Gothic art, it has been asserted, she is a rarity,86 while figures of Octavian and the Sibyl appear frequently. These occur on the 78 Antiquitates Italicae Medii Aevi, 1738-42, p. 878 and fig. I. The mosaic is also repro- duced in P.

In a Flemish manuscript of about 1430 in the Morgan Library, the Virgin surrounded by the rays of the sun wears a crown of stars as she sits on the crescent moon.91 A similar attitude appears in a Netherlandish block- book of the Apocalypse dated about a decade earlier.92 These examples and many others like them93 concentrate on the Woman of St. John's vision to the exclusion of Octavian and the Sibyl. To a contem- porary school of German sculpture, however, is attributed an image that associates the mulier amicta sole not only with the emperor and the Tiburtina but also with Gideon and his fleece as an antitype of the Immaculate Concep- tion (P1. 35b).9' The group, made in Liibeck about 1420, was formerly in the west Finnish church of Uusikaupunki and is now in the National Museum at Helsinki. It represents the Virgin standing on the moon holding the Child in both hands. Her cape and mantle and the sun-burst around her are gilded while the different areas of flesh are rendered in a variety of pinkish tones; her lips and those of the anthropomorphic moon are a brilliant red. At her feet, on either side of the strikingly naturalistic face of the moon, are the Sibyl indicating the vision to the heedless Octavian and Gideon with uplifted head kneeling in supplication. Two angels with outstretched arms complete the elegant triangular composition. The story of Gideon's fleece made wet with dew while the earth around him remained dry (Judges vi, 36-40) was understood by Honorius of Autun in the early twelfth century as prefiguring the descent of Grace upon Mary when the rest of the world was parched with sin.95 In Gothic typological cycles it often parallels Daniel in the lions' den and the Children of Israel in the fiery furnace.96 In a window at Laon,97 Gideon appears in armour calling 87 Male, Quomodo Sibyllas.. ., pp. 18-2I. 88 L.

By the time that this was produced, the Hebrew warrior was a commonplace in illustrated devotional works where his victory through Grace was construed as an antitype of the defeat of the dragon that beset the Apocalyptic Woman.98 The juxtaposition of these three groups of figures in our sculpture can leave little room for doubt that it is a representation of the Immaculate Conception. Compounded of images from medieval myth as well as from the Old and New Testaments, its several parts contribute analogically to the dominant figure of the mulier amicta sole.99 In a piece of Liibeck workmanship, dated about 1510 and also in the National Museum at Helsinki, the Virgin is again the centre of an elaborate composition (P1. IO). In the central panel of this altar-piece, formerly in the church at Somero, she is placed below God the Father and above adoring representatives of spiritual and temporal power.1oo These earthly figures are too generalized to be related to the Woman Dressed in the Sun in the manner of the Sibyl and Gideon in the Uusikaupunki group. The emperor and the king kneeling in the lower right- hand corner are to be dated about a hundred years later than the principal figure which is possibly from the workshop of Henning von der Heiden.1?1 The precise date or occasion for this eclectic assemblage has yet to be determined, although it may possibly be connected with the complex icono- graphy of the Virgin and her attendants. The presence of the angels bearing the instruments of the Passion and the medallions with the stigmata suggests that the scene originally represented the Virgin of the Rose-Wreath. 1?. If the sunbeams were later substituted for a garland or rosary, then the group may have contained a reference in its figure of a pope to Sixtus IV, whose devotion to this particular image is well-documented.103 No certain representation of the Virgin of the Rose-Wreath survives in either Finnish painting or sculpture. As in late medieval Sweden, the Imma- culate Conception received its most distinct expression in the mulier amicta sole, although this is more apparent in art than in literature. While no specific reference to the Woman of St. John's vision is to be found in the writings of St. Bridget, the Revelationes of the most important figure in Swedish monasticism are filled with allusions to the purity of Mary and of the marriage of which she was the issue.104 The Virgin is identified as 'the rod which Isaiah foretold would come out of the root of Jesse' and foreknowledge of the Immaculate Conception is said to have comforted Adam, Abraham and the Prophets.1?5 98 E.G. an English Prayers to the Virgin, British Museum Add.

Although these both come from Finnish churches, it is by no means certain that they crossed the Baltic before the end of the sixteenth century.10s The earliest Finnish representa- tions of the Ara Coeli (Pls. 35a and 34b) were painted nearly one hundred years earlier, while examples of the mulier amicta sole (Pls. 33a and d) anticipate Swedish representations by half a century.10s Evidently it is not to St. Bridget and Scandinavian church art nor to north German sculpture that we must look for the sources of these themes in late medieval Finnish painting. III The iconographical and stylistic problems posed by this decoration are bedevilled by the entanglement of the Finnish church in both Swedish and Papal politics. This involvement began long before Innocent II placed the Church of Finland under the archbishopric of Uppsala in 1216. But the act served to throw into relief the attachment of Christians in a largely pagan country to a formerly autonomous Ecclesia Finlandiae. Further, it exacerbated the situation of the bishops of Turku, torn between their ecclesiastical duty to a foreign superior and their native loyalties.110 Until after the Reformation the Church was coterminous with the bishopric of Turku and from 1385 the see was always occupied by native Finns. The cosmopolitan artistic atmosphere of the country in the fifteenth century can be attributed in part to the interests and learning of men such as Maunu II Tavast and Olavi Maununpoika, bishops of Turku between 1412 and 1450. While the Swedish king exerted pressure upon their cathedral chapters in an attempt to bind Finland more closely to the Union,111 they travelled to the European centres of ecclesiastical culture to bring back silks, reliquaries and vestments.112 The brass sarcophagus of St. Henry at Nousiainen-the focal point of the national cult of Finland-was the product of such contacts. Depicting the miracles and passion of St. Henry with Maunu Tavast genu- flecting to the martyr, it is a work of the highest quality probably of French or Flemish origin.11l 106 Ibid., pp. 34-37. 107 Founded in 1440 on the rule of the Bridgetine monastery of Vadstena. 10s Pylkkinen, Alttarikaappi, p. 26. 109 See p. 121 supra. 110 While the ecclesiastical organization of Finland was technically under the arch- bishopric of Lund until 1216, the Church remained virtually under the control of local bishops appointed by Rome.

The brickwork gables that characterize the churches of Uusimaa (around Helsinki), Hame (the region about Hattula) and even Satakunta (the coastal province north of Rauma) have no counter- part in fifteenth-century Sweden. Where these are not purely indigenous, they are forms borrowed from the Baltic lands to the south.114 Sculpture in wood, the antecedents and contemporaries of our two altar- pieces with the mulier amicta sole (P1. 35 b and e), reached the rural churches of Finland above all from the Hanseatic towns115 and thus travelled the same routes as visitors from Paadiste and other monasteries in Estonia whose land- grants included much Finnish territory.116 These grants were, for the most part, conveyances made by the Swedish Crown and reflect the continuing efforts on the part of the Union monarchs to encourage monastic and ecclesiastical bodies whose administrative facilities might be used to royal advantage. King Eric (1412-39) made two journeys to Finland to reward the regular clergy for the efforts on his behalf; otherwise, he relied on the talents of the Cistercians and the mendicant orders to influence an unwilling people.117 The need for such help increased after the partial dissolution of the Union in 1437, when Norway was lost, and in the face of the intermittent wars with Denmark and the Hanseatic towns that lasted through the century. Frequent regional revolts in Finland served as a constant reminder of the tenuous links that bound the country to Sweden.11s While it would be rash to surmise an articulate political nationalism before the Reformation, Finnish popular feeling declared itself in a number of local cults. These were practised always within the framework of the Catholic church but in a spirit deliberately independent of Swedish authority and its representatives in the mendicant orders. In opposition to such foreign devo- tions as the imitatio Mariae pursued at Naantali and the order of the Sisters of St. Anne,119 the idea of a Finnish patria under a national patron developed about the semi-legendary figure of St. Henry.120 The cult found expression in sculpture,121 metalwork122 and wall-painting:123 the variety of manners in 114Jaakkola, SMK, pp. 320-2.

St. Henry's martyrdom seems to have provided a focus for Finnish identity in contrast to the Swedish pieties which Eric and his predecessors attempted to foster in their troublesome possession to the east. The encouragement given to the spread of Bridgetine mysticism in Finland124 and the favour shown to monastic houses by the Union government125 suggest the political importance attached to religious organization by the Swedish king. The secular clergy received similar support. Consisting of only forty parishes at the beginning of the fourteenth century, the Church of Finland contained more than three times this number at the Reformation.126 It is against this background that the advent of the Franciscan order must be seen. The arrival of the Grey Friars in Finland occurred much later than in the Scandinavian countries. While they were established in Denmark and Norway by 123O, their first monastery in Finland was not founded until 1403. This is the more surprising in view of the early Franciscan custodies of Luibeck and Bremen.127 But with royal support by the middle of the fifteenth century they had houses in Finland at Viipuri, Rauma and Kokar. From this date, too, wooden images of St. Francis began to appear.12s But the major artistic success of the Franciscans is recorded in the wall-painting of churches, both those belonging to the order as at Rauma (P1. 34a) and in villages such as Finstr6m, Pyhtai and Kumlinge. These decorative programmes, as a whole or in part, reflect the mendicants' achievement of preaching in the language of the country.129 Themes such as mulier amicta sole (P1. 33a, c, d), the suffering of the Crucified130 and the stigmatization of St. Francis131 occur with increas- ing frequency after the middle of the fifteenth century and fill the country churches of Uusimaa and Hiame with the Franciscan iconography that hitherto had reached no farther than the southern shore of the Baltic.132 Outstanding among the new motifs introduced in this fashion is the Ara Coeli which is found in continental block-books from about 14OO133 but quite unknown in Swedish painting or sculpture. 124 Jaakkola, SMK, pp. 264-5. 125 The first Dominican house in Finland was founded as early as 1249.

For a</page><page sequence="20">MULIER AMICTA SOLE 133 The role of the Speculum Humanae Salvationis in bringing this iconography to northern Europe was pointed out at least as long ago as I912.*13 But its influence on Finnish painting was not noticed until Nygren drew attention to similarities between the illustration of the Ara Coeli in the eighth chapter of the work and the representations at Lohja (P1. 35a) and Hattula (Pl.34b).135 Although the Speculum was a Dominican composition of about 1324,136 by the beginning of the fifteenth century its illustrators had appropriated the Franciscan motif of the Ara Coeli as an antitype of the Nativity.137 In this typological arrangement of the origin of sin and the salvation of humanity by Christ, the vision of Octavian parallels the dream of Pharaoh's butler (Gen. xl, 1-23) and the flowering of Aaron's rod (Num. i, 1-8) as tokens of the truth of prophecy. Where the mulier amicta sole appears in versions of the Speculum, she serves, together with the Ark brought home and Bathsheba set by Solomon at his right hand, as an antitype of the Coronation of the Virgin.138 Aaron's rod is the analogue of the Ara Coeli (P1. 35d) in a Speculum printed at Utrecht in 1469 and now in the Royal Library at Stockholm.139 The upper third of the page is occupied by a Gothic architectural frame with ogee arches within which the two scenes are set. An oblique line of recession connects the kneeling emperor with the Sibyl gesturing towards a bustate Mary surrounded by clouds. The perspective is well handled as are the details of the scene: Octavian has dropped his sceptre and raises his hands in adoration, while the Sibyl kneels beside a river presumably identifying her as the Tiburtina. The accompanying legend reads 'Sibilla vidit v(ir)gine(m) cu(m) puero'. None of these narrative elements accompany the scene of the Ara Coeli at Lohja and Hattula and there is no reason to connect these representations with the particular Speculum at Stockholm. The head-dress and clothing of the figures in the Finnish representations differ radically from those in the block-book and the landscape setting is not suggested in these painted vaults. Yet no other illustrated source for the myth of Octavian's vision is known to have circulated in northern Europe before the Reformation. The Uusikau- punki group (P1. 35b), with its triple allusion to the Immaculate Conception, is almost certainly a conflation from some Speculum containing images of the Ara Coeli, Gideon with his fleece and the mulier amicta sole.14? The Apocalyptic Woman dominates this composition from Liibeck as she does at Hattula and Lohja. Her long history as an Immaculist emblem general discussion of the many known examples of the book, see J. Lutz and P. Perdrizet, Speculum Humanae Salvationis, texte critique, 1907. a'4 L.

I 18. 136 Lutz-Perdrizet, op. cit., p. 55. 137 Berenson and James, loc. cit., suggested that the motif was taken from the Chronicum of Martinus Polonus and thus indirectly from the Mirabilia Urbis Romae. Its universal use is suggested by the same motif to be found in versions of the Speculum from Germany, Vat. Palat. Lat. 413 and France, Bibl. Nat. MS. Lat. 9584, as well as the Netherlandish codex under discussion. 13s E.g. in the continuation of the Paris copy cited in note I33 supra, chapter xxxvi, fol. 3r. The Apocalyptic Woman, who occurs much more rarely than the Ara Coeli in versions of the Speculum, here stands on the crescent, with the sun behind her and six stars about her head. She has two large wings and her hands are joined on her breast. '39 No. 989, fol. 41. 140 Unlike the Speculum at Stockholm, Paris 9584 with its continuation contains all three motifs.</page><page sequence="21">134 ANTHONY CUTLER suggests that when she crossed the Baltic and appeared in Finland, at first alone and ultimately in combination with Octavian and the Sibyl, she travelled as an emissary of the Franciscans. The role assigned to the mendicants by the Swedish Crown and by Rome serves to confirm this belief.</page></plain_text>
