His distinction between "shifting agriculture" and "bush-fallowing rotation" parallels Conklin's (Hanun6o Agriculture, 1957) "pioneer swidden farming," where climax forest is cleared, and "established swidden farming," where fallowed secondary vegetation is periodically recleared. Barrau arranges his agricultural types into an evolutionary sequence which purports to represent stages in the development of Melanesian agri- culture. Barrau is at his best when describing the food plants grown in Melanesia. This section provides a useful introduction to tropical root and tree crops. Here, in present- ing an interpretation of the root-crop agriculturist's reaction to European-introduced grains, the author does not neglect the outlook of the Melanesian farmer. In the final section Barrau considers the adequacy of Melanesian agricultural tech- niques and the sufficiency of the Melanesian diet. He feels that both can be improved and that such improvement is necessary for the "economic and social progress which is, in my opinion, inseparable from sedentary agriculture" (p. 77). His suggestions are cautious (e.g., give them "sturdy hand implements," not tractors), and he recognizes the practical difficulties and dangers involved. Barrau concludes that the improvement of food resources "is only one aspect of progress; and it may well prove ineffectual, at worst even dangerous, if it is not conceived in relation to the new society which will develop in Melanesia" (p. 102). Readers bent upon improving Melanesian agriculture, as well as those with less ambitious interests, will find here a broad introduction to the subject. For more inten- sive studies, which place agriculture in sociocultural as well as ecological contexts, they must look elsewhere. Coral Island: Portrait of an Atoll MARSTON BATES and DONALD P. ABBOTT. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1958. 254 pp., 64 illustrations, 2 maps. $4.95. Reviewed by JOSEPH E. WECKLER, University of Southern California This book is a popular account, written by two naturalists, of a 1953 expedition to Ifaluk atoll in the western Carolines. The authors were members of a team which included specialists in anthropology, biology, geology, hydrology, ichthyology, and zoology; the leader was the late Ted Burrows. The general purpose of the research was to study the relationship of man to his environment in an island society minimally affected by Western civilization. Ifaluk was the fourth atoll to be studied by such an interdisciplinary team in the wake of the Coordinated Investigation of Micronesian Anthropology, initiated in 1947. Like the former studies, this was sponsored by the National Science Board and supported by the Office of Naval Research and other government agencies. The engaging narrative describes the life of the expedition members and of the natives. It describes the variety of projects and investigations by which various specialists sought to solve their particular problems. There is also a good deal of specifically anthropological information about the Ifalukians: their daily life, tech- niques of fishing, gardening, and otherwise utilizing the available natural resources. Throughout the book the authors gratefully point out the whole-hearted hospitality of the people of Ifaluk and their intelligent interest and skillful cooperation in helping the members of the expedition to secure information. It is an excellent discourse for lay readers on the modus operandi of a diversified team of scientists working on a common</page><page sequence="2">708 American Anthropologist problem in a remote corner of the world, and it clearly points out the indispensable con- tributions of the local population to the solution of the problem. To one who has lived on a similar atoll, the account arouses memories too nostalgic to contemplate. A ku-Aku: The Secret of Easter Island. THOR HEYERDAHL. Chicago: Rand McNally and Company, 1958. 384 pp., appendix, 5 drawings, 2 maps, 61 photographs. $6.95. Reviewed by ROLAND W. FORCE, Chicago Natural History Museum Thor Heyerdahl is no stranger either to American readers or to success. His Kon- Tiki, the account of a voyage on a raft, was a best seller here and abroad. The film of the voyage was widely distributed and is currently being shown on television. Now Aku-Aku, riding on the crest of the earlier book's popularity, will probably set new sales records. The fact that its main thesis-that the Pacific Islands were settled pri- marily from the New World-rruns counter to current scientific thinking is apparently beside the point. Whatever else it is, A ku-Aku is not a scientific book. This in itself is insufficient grounds for criticism. There are many excellent nonscientific books-and regrettably quite a number of poor scientific ones. The lamentable fact about this particular work (a Book-of-the-Month) is that a wide reading audience will probably accept it as con- siderably more than it is. Though it purports to convey scientific facts, it is in fact an adventure story. Unfortunately, the public at large will probably give undeserving credence to its sensationalized contents. To the man on the street, who has had no occasion to read any of the excellent scientific investigations of Easter Island such as those by Thomson, Dixon, Metraux, Shapiro, and Lavachery, the impression conveyed by Aku-Aku will probably be that for more than a century anthropologists have been unperceptively sitting on their hands, while it has remained for Heyerdahl alone to display the insight and peculiar acumen sufficient to fling aside the obfuscating impediments to understanding and to set the record straight once and for all. Easter Island, lonely, isolated, and barren, forms the easternmost apex of the equi- lateral triangle which encompasses the vast area of the Pacific Ocean known as Poly- nesia. The grassy slopes of this volcanic island are studded in some places with giant anthropomorphic stone figures with elongated ear lobes, over-thrusting brows, and prominent noses. Some of these massive sculptures lie toppled over, the rock platforms on which they once stood crumbling away. It is on this tiny dot of land 2,000 miles from South America, and almost as far from its nearest Polynesian neighbor, that most of the adventures recounted in Aku-Aku transpired. Easter Island was named to commemorate its discovery by the Dutchman Rogge- veen on Easter Sunday in 1722. In the years that followed, various explorers and othel voyagers such as whalers and castaways paid occasional visits. As with so many other Pacific island peoples, contact between Easter Islanders and the outside world boded ill for the natives. Uncounted numbers succumbed to communicable diseases for which they had developed no selective immunity. Others were simply shanghaied and died as slave laborers on the guano islands off the coast of Peru. By 1872 the native population had diminished to a mere 111 persons. In 1934 there was only one individual who had witnessed any functioning native culture. She was over 100 years old and her recollec- tions were so poor as to make her of no value as an informant. Thus the society of Easter Island today is so far removed from its precursors that what remains is far from a valid representation of precontact native life. For this [61, 1959]</page></plain_text>
