<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rel. Stud. 6, pp. 359-368 PETER C. APPLEBY Assistant Professor of Philosophy, The University of Utah ON RELIGIOUS ATTITUDES I When Christians worship God, their cultic activities display, in widely varying combinations, attitudes of fear, respect, love, trust, awe, deference and obedience. They worship the Lord with all their heart, soul and strength, confessing their own insignificance in comparison to God, yet expressing confidence in the divine mercy which they believe will assist them through the trials of this life, toward a joyful existence beyond the grave. In the liturgical churches, the dominating mood varies according to the tables of feasts and fasts: Christmas and Easter are times for joyful song, brightly coloured vestments and festive activities. Ash Wednesday and Good Friday are days of penitence, sorrow and sombre hymnody. ('Remember, Oh Man, that dust thou art . . .') Throughout the year, the houses of worship are places of bowed heads and lowered voices, of respect and sobriety, and sometimes of veneration for icons and the objects used in worship. The inventory of revered objects varies considerably, as do the activities thought to be appropriate in this connection, ranging from the Low Protestant's respectful handling of the Bible to the High Churchmnan's prostration before the Monstrance, in the Benediction of the Holy Sacrament. But it is clear that divine worship normally involves reverence and awe and that it usually involves some form of self-abasement (bending the knee before). In the course of his well-known attempt to disprove the existence of God,' J. N. Findlay presents a discussion of religious attitudes which deserves more critical attention than it has so far received in the journal literature. Professor Findlay argues that religious attitudes, like all others, 'presume characters in their objects' and that the presence or absence of these char acters is a crucial determinant of the appropriateness of an attitude in a given case. An attitude of fear, for example, would be appropriate or 'justified' in the presence of a maniac holding a loaded shotgun, inappropriate or unjustified in the presence of a mouse. According to Findlay, 'an implicit reference to some standard object-which makes an attitude either normal or abnormal-is part of what we ordinarily mean by all our names for attitudes, and can be rendered explicit by a simple study of usage'. Applying this principle to the case of religious attitudes, he contends that 'To feel religiously is . . . to presume surpassing greatness in some object. . . .' For 1 J. N. Findlay, 'Can God's Existence be Disproved?', Mind, I948. Reprinted in Flew and MacIntyre, New Essays in Philosophical Theology.</page><page sequence="2">360 PETER C. APPLEBY only a being which far exceeds human levels of power, wisdom, love and other respected qualities would be an appropriate object of the deference, awe and devotion involved in religion. Whether or not reference to standard objects is part of the meaning of terms used to refer to attitudes, Findlay seems to be right in maintaining that there are criteria of appropriateness for the objects of attitudes and that religious attitudes are not exceptional in this respect. But his position becomes less tenable when he argues that reflection on the object of religious attitudes leads 'irresistibly' toward the view that the deity is unsurpassable in every respect, that the divine nature towers infinitely above all others, and that God is the necessarily existing source of all other existence. We are led in this direction, he contends, when we realise that it would be 'anomalous to worship anything limited in any thinkable manner. For all limited superiorities are tainted with an obvious relativity, and can be dwarfed in thought by still mightier superiorities, in which process of being dwarfed they lose their claim upon our worshipful attitudes'. Eventually, it is argued, we must arrive at something very much like Anselm's conception of God if we are to avoid the error of devoting our religious attentions to an unworthy object. Findlay goes on to contend that Anselm's idea of God involves a combination of properties which could not possibly be instantiated, and the religious man is apparently left with an unhappy choice between idolatry and the worship of an impossible deity. The paper ends with a curiously favourable comment on the 'atheistic religious attitudes' of Fichte, Erigena and Alexander, but the obvious conclusion to be drawn is that there are no appropriate, normal or justified instances of religious attitudes. It is not my intention in this paper to engage in a discussion of the merits of Findlay's attack on Anselm, though I find his argument very interesting. Instead, I will raise some objections against his treatment of religious attitudes and offer some general suggestions regarding criteria of appropriateness or adequacy for objects of worship. The line of reasoning outlined above seems obviously fallacious to me, but it, or something like it, seems to have persuaded a number of contemporary writers in the philosophy of religion. Norman Malcolm, for example, agrees with Findlay on religious attitudes while attacking his conclusions concerning the ontological argument.' Paul Tillich seems to think that the First Commandment defines the range of acceptable objects of worship, limiting that range to one 'God-beyond-God'.2 And Charles Hartshorne agrees with Tillich concerning the limits imposed by the Commandment, though he also argues that the divine nature can 1 Norman Malcolm, 'Anselm's Ontological Arguments', The Philosophical Review, Vol. LXIX, No. I.

A fourth example is Terence Penelhum, who refers approvingly to Findlay's criteria in a discussion of 'the only God in whose existence we can evince interest .... The consensus seems clearly to be that the worship of any deity of lesser stature than the High God of classical monotheism would be a mistake of the same kind as the fear of nocturnal air, which used to cause intelligent people to close all their windows at night, even in warm weather, as a precaution against disease. The most obvious mistake in Findlay's reasoning, it seems to me, is the assumption that imaginary deities could and should take precedence over actual deities, when decisions are made regarding the appropriateness of worship. It is clearly argued that we ought to abandon the worship of any deity whose powers can be 'dwarfed in thought by still mightier superiorities'. Findlay would probably not want to modify his claim with a qualification to the effect that such mightier superiorities must be shown to exist, since this adjustment would destroy the structure of his main argument against theism. But it seems clear that such a modification must be made, for the rejection of an actual god just because a greater one could be imagined would be as foolish as abandoning one's fear of the madman with an actual shotgun on the grounds that one could imagine him holding a flame thrower instead. The ancient Hebrews believed that Jahweh was a very powerful god, with a particular concern for one group of people and with absolute control over a very limited geographical area. Surely they could have imagined or thought of a deity whose power extended further, even one who ruled the universe, as is shown by the evolution of their thought on the subject. But until they had some reason to suppose that there was such a deity, their allegiance to the local divinity of Mount Sinai was not misplaced, at least for the reasons Findlay suggests. In this connection, what can or cannot be dwarfed in thought is, at most of secondary importance to the question of what can be dwarfed in reality. Furthermore, unless all forms of polytheism are simply ruled out without a hearing, Findlay's point must also be modified to include consideration of the relevance of possible alternative gods to the concerns of any given community of worshippers. Deities with territorial and/or functional limitations are certainly not popular in sophisticated societies any more, but it does not seem obvious to me that a person would be doing something stupid if he worshipped a variety of gods with differing territories or domains of competence, assumning there were reasons for believing in the reality of such deities. Perhaps, as in ancient times, the god of one's native country or special concern would be entitled to a loyalty which would rule out anything more than politeness and deference to other gods, but I can see 1 Charles Hartshorne, The Logic of Perfection (Open Court Publishing Co., LaSalle, 1962), p. 40. 2 Terrence Penelhum, 'Divine Goodness and the Problem of Evil', Religious Studies, Vol. 2, p. 99. C</page><page sequence="4">362 PETER C. APPLEBY nothing in Findlay's argument to show that even unqualified devotion to one deity must involve the worshipper in denying the existence of others. I suppose that we have abandoned polytheism because the beliefs held by our ancestors turned out to be false, or because, as Hartshorne suggests, polytheism can never build up a sufficient inventory of deities to fulfill religious needs, without becoming chaotic.' These reasons, however, have little to do with anything being 'dwarfed in thought' or the sudden rejection of all limitations. Instead, they seem to me to involve refuted theological claims, disappointed expectations, and the crowded confusion of places like Olympus. If the universe were in fact arranged as Homer and Hesiod thought it to be, the limited superiorities of the Olympians would not and, I suggest, should not prevent us from worshipping them, for Findlay has given us no reason for requiring that all divine functions must be united in a single object of religious comrmitment. Perhaps this objection will not be regarded as a serious one, since poly theism is not a live option for most of us nowadays. But reflection on the practices of ancient or unsophisticated people can, I believe, illumiinate the picture from another perspective. It was mentioned earlier that divine worship often involves expressions of such attitudes as trust, respect and love. This list might be expanded to include gratitude, repentance, filial piety, and others which are appropriately directed only toward a being who is capable of responding to these manifestations in a personal way. Prayer and praise, petitions and thanksgivings, and appeals for forgiveness are addressed to gods who are thought to hear the voice of worship and to make some reply, for God is worshipped as 'our help in ages past, our hope for years to come'. It would be anomalous to pray to Aristotle's Unmoved Mover or to the One of Plotinus, since they, like the remote deities of Epicurus, have nothing to do with any of the more immediate and urgent longings of the human spirit. Wordless ecstasy, awe and wonder might well be in order, but surely not love, for who could love the Absolute? In matters of personal piety, it seems to me, a little bit of transcendence goes a long way. But it also seems to me that in advocating the Anselmian deity as the only adequate object of religious attitudes, Findlay comes very close to arguing that the only appropriate object of worship would be one to whom the addressing of prayers would be entirely pointless. For it is an open question whether the unlimitedly perfect, omniscient, omnipotent and immutable High God of classical tradition in theology and philosophy can be identified with the deity of Christian cultic practice. It is a familiar complaint that the gods of philosophers are not the gods of religious faith, and this charge may well seem justified by the many unsuccessful attempts in the history of philosophy to deal with the problem of theophany. I am 1 Charles Hartshorne, Man's Vision of God (Willett, Clark and Co., New York, I941), p. 5.</page><page sequence="5">ON RELIGIOUS ATTITUDES 363 by no means convinced that it would not be a waste of effort to address the Lord's Prayer to an immutable deity, many or all of whose properties were thought to be non-contingent in some vay, though I admit that the failure of the classical theologians to develop a religiously satisfactory account of such a god does not demonstrate the impossibility of providing one. Findlay lists some of the major difficulties in the classical conception of the divine nature, and he includes the problem of immanence and transcendence among these difficulties.' Yet he does not seem to see the bearing of this problem on his own analysis of religious attitudes, for he makes no mention of the possibility that a god might become so exalted as to be entirely irrelevant to the concerns of faith. If it is to be shown that the only adequate object of worship would be a being than which nothing greater can be conceived, reasons must be given for thinking that such a being could and would engage in at least some of the activities which the unsophisticated believer's faith affirms of God. Finally, it may be worth mentioning that if I am right in thinking that Anselm's God is not the object of the ordinary believer's worship, it will follow directly from Findlay's analysis that most religious people are in fact idolaters, for most of them will turn out to be directing their religious attentions to unworthy objects. This seems to me to be a most bizarre result, notwithstanding Findlay's distinction between unreflective and reflective ways of speaking about these matters.2 I agree with him that philosophical analysis often legitimately leads to modifications of widely held beliefs, and I have little confidence in appeals to common sense as a means of resolving disputes in philosophy. But the difference of opinion between the ordinary believer and people like Anselm and Boethius is not, in my view, just the difference between pre-reflective and reflective theologies. I think the ordinary believer might well examine the classical analyses of the divine nature and reflectively reject them because the deity they portray is too far removed from the common concerns of religious faith. If this were to happen, the burden of proof would devolve upon the philosopher of Findlay's persuasion to show that it vas the believer who was in error, and not the classical theologian. So far I have seen very little which would support such a conclusion. III Turning to the more general problem of criteria of adequacy or appropriate ness for objects of religious attitudes, we find our task immediately com plicated by the vast array of activities which are properly regarded as religious practices. Religious attitudes, like the attitudes of fear or affection, come in a variety of types and degrees, and the list of manifestations of 1 J. N. Findlay, op. cit., p. 52. 2 J. N. Findlay, op. cit., p. 50. C</page><page sequence="6">364 PETER C. APPLEBY these attitudes is virtually without end or limrit. (Here it may be useful to remember the little boy who exhibits his affection for his first love by pelting her with snowballs.) Surely we can see the vanishing points of religious attitudes in the humanistic Unitarian's substitution of a lecture on nuclear physics for the traditional Sunday sermon, or in the magical practices of Ruth Benedict's Dobuans.1 But it is equally clear, after the failure of many great efforts in the philosophy of religion, that no adequate 'all and only' definition of the religious attitude is forthcoming. Because these considera tions rule out a more rigorous approach, perhaps the best we can do is to ask what a reasonably intelligent and well-informed inhabitant of a modern, scientifically sophisticated society would worship, if he were to worship anything at all. Answering this question will, I hope, lead us to some defensible, general conclusions about criteria of appropriateness for objects of religious attitudes. In the first place, it seems clear that the object of worship must be a personality of some kind, though not a human being. The liturgical practices of religious communities normally involve expressions of love, petitions for assistance, entreaties for forgiveness, and hymns of praise and thanksgiving, virtually all of which would lose their point if they were not directed to a personal being. (Imagine, for example, giving thanks without thanking someone, or addressing the 'Kyrie' to the Platonic Demiurge.) These activities derive their meaning and significance in the lives of the faithful from the belief in a God who hears and responds to the voice of prayer, who is pleased or grieved by the actions of men, and who manifests loving concern for the well-being of the creatures of his domain. In short, to worship is to worship a personal God. If it is argued against this view that the mystic in his wordless ecstasy worships a God to whom no personal predicates literally apply, the initial response will be that the disciplines used to bring about mystical experiences are not obviously instances of worship. Of course the discipline may involve worship, as it did in the cases of St Thersa and St Bonaventure, but it need not, since contemplation, fasting, rigorous physical training and narcotics all may be used as means to the desired end. Recitation of the sacred syllable 'Om', meditation on a Zen Koan, and the ritualised consumption of lysurgic acid can hardly be regarded as acts of worship, except in the attenuated sense in which anything a believer does reverently can be called an act of worship. Furthermore, the pronouncements of the mystics about their experiences are often of such a nature that if they were true, most of what we ordinarily call worship would be pointless activity. The objects of mystical experience are many and varied, but the mystic's 'One', like the Absolutes of metaphysical systems, is only very loosely related to the gods of common piety. Thus, if worship involves prayer and praise, petitions and thanks I Cf. Ruth Benedict, Patternis of Culture (New American Library, New York, 1934), Chapter V.</page><page sequence="7">ON RELIGIOUS ATTITUDES 365 givings, as I think it does, it appears that the object of worship must be a personal deity, one which is neither completely ineffable nor completely transcendent with respect to the categories of interpersonal communication. On the other hand, it also seems clear that the object of religious attitudes cannot just be a human being, even one of very unusual abilities or accom plishments. For the attitude of worship involves a kind of homage which would never be appropriately displayed by one human toward another. Respect, admiration, fear, and perhaps even awe are attitudes which people normally exhibit toward other persons under various circumstances, and these attitudes are also characteristic of the religious posture toward God. But it would be morally demeaning for persons to address a fellow human being with the words of the Anglican 'Prayer of Humble Access', saying, 'We are not worthy so much as to gather up the crumbs under thy table, but thou art the same Lord whose property is always to have mercy'. No disparities in rank, stature or accomplishments could justify obeisance of this kind, for deference here gives way to the abandonment of virtually all claims for respect. There are, of course, highly anthropomorphic conceptions of God, for example, in the faith of the Mormons, and there are, as was noted earlier, widely varying degrees of homage paid to the objects of religious attitudes. But the deity who is worthy of worship must be a super human personality, simply because it would be morally degenerate for one man to pray to another. Deference and respect are often appropriate attitudes in human relationships; total self-abasement is never justifiable in this context.' Historically, many religious communities have humbled themselves before deities whose most evident superhuman characteristic was sheer power. The gods of ancient cultures were often tyrants whose capricious dispositions and devastating anger kept the believers in a constant state of anxiety. The fear of the Lord, or Kali, or Quetzalcoatl was indeed the beginning of wisdom for people who lived in the presence of a deity like the one who struck Uzzah dead for touching the Ark of the Covenant.2 Jealous, vengeful, bloodthirsty and malicious, these primitive gods exacted grim tribute from the worshippers who grovelled before the thrones of uncontrollable, irra tional power. But as our ancestors' understanding of their environment and their moral sophistication increased, the character of their gods tended to improve. Socrates and Plato inveighed against the attribution of immoralities to the gods, the prophets of the later books of the Old Testament began to 1 I state this point quite strongly, not only because of the anomalies which result from the contrary opinion (e.g. the worship of Father Divine), but also because I believe that respect for persons, including oneself, and the adoption of a principle of fairness are fundamental elements of any defensible moral perspective. This latter claim is, of course, controversial, but I believe it can be supported by arguments drawn from Kant, Mill and a number of contemporary philosophers. 2 Cf. II Samuel 6: i-II, I Chronicles 13: I-I4.</page><page sequence="8">366 PETER C. APPLEBY see Jahweh as the divine judge of the worth of men, and the wvriters of the New Testament believed in a deity who tempered justice with mercy and love. Of course the moral progress of religious belief has not been unin terrupted, as the Book of Revelation, the crusade movement, and the sermons of Puritan preachers clearly indicate, but the modern believer seems more inclined to worship God for his moral superiority and power together, than for his power and dominion alone. The Fundamentalist continues to predict hellfire and damnation for his theological opponents, but the trend seems to be toward religion as 'devoted love for a being regarded as super latively worthy of love'.' In my opinion, this progression reflects the fact that the only divine attributes which could justify the attitude of worship on the part of the believer are those related to God's goodness and love for his creatures. I am not confident that the extremes of self-abasement before God are ever justified or appropriate, even in the context of the Pauline and Augustinian notions of human sinfulness, but if they were, it would be because God is perfectly good, not just because he is extremely powerful. Coerced obeisance is significantly different from deserved adoration, and only the latter is worthy of consideration in connection with the appropriateness of worship. Power as such must be respected and carefully dealt with, but not wor shipped. Thus the twentieth-century believer tends to offer religious devotion only to a deity whom he conceives to be supreme in benevolence as well as power, and he rightly rejects the servile worship of immoral or amoral gods. He will not always claim to understand God's purposes in particular cases, but he will be unfavourably disposed toward the view that God's ways are basically unintelligible to man or that God's purposes can conflict in fundamental ways with the well-being of men. (The current controversy over the Papacy's stand on birth control and the decreasing popularity of racist theologies are examples of this trend.) For these reasons, I think it safe to conclude that a being worthy of worship must have moral goodness as one of its leading attributes, along with the great power which religious people have always imputed to their gods. It was argued in the first section of this paper that considerations regarding the appropriateness of religious attitudes do not rule out polytheism, even though belief in a multiplicity of gods is not widely popular in Western civilisation nowadays. This means, I believe, that the specific extent of divine power cannot be determined by reflection on the attitudes involved in worship. To pray to God is obviously to believe that God has sufficient effective power to respond in the desired ways, but it does not necessarily involve the belief that God's power is without conceivable limits, or that God has unlimited sovereignty over the entire universe. Popular piety is interested in a deity whose dominion includes the horizons of the worshipper's 1 Charles Hartshorne, op. cit., p. 3.</page><page sequence="9">ON RELIGIOUS ATTITUDES 367 existence and concerns, whether these horizons embrace the entire universe, the earth and its environs, or more limited areas. Therefore, the attitude of worship itself requires only that God's power be very great, perhaps without limit in some particular area, but not that he be omnipotent in the theo logian's technical sense of the term. Similar considerations apply to the technical notions of divine omniscience, perfection, eternity and immutability, as well as to the theologian's idea that all of God's attributes are in some way necessary. The religious attitude probably requires that the divine knowledge and understanding be very extensive and penetrating, but not necessarily that they include, for example, every detail of the future of the entire universe. The God 'unto whom all hearts are open, all desires known, and from whom no secrets are hid' is not necessarily the timeless contemplator of the panorama of world history envisaged by Boethius. Faith also probably requires steadfastness of purpose and consistency of character in the object of worship, but it is not clear that it demands immutability or that every proposition that is true of God be necessarily true. On the contrary, as Hartshorne and others have pointed out, it seems to require a deity who is capable of creative and novel responses in changing situations, a being who is active in the life of mankind. And if religion sees God as perfect, the divine perfection will be described in terms of infallible judgment, unsurpassable goodness, and pure love, but not necessarily in terms of the static excellence of ideal forms. Finally, the question of God's eternity furnishes an instructive example of the disparity between popular and technical conceptions of God and the confusion which can be generated by the failure to keep these categories distinct from each other. It seems to me that if we asked our modern believer what he thought it meant to say that God is eternal, his reply would very likely be that God has existed forever and that he will continue to exist forever. Perhaps he might quote the farmiliar words of the Psalmist, who says, 'from everlasting to everlasting thou art God'.' In other words, his conception of eternity is that of endless duration, possibly conjoined with the idea that nothing caused God to exist and nothing could cause him to cease to exist. Atemporality would not enter the discussion unless the believer had had some technical training in the field of theology or the philosophy of religion. The contrast between eternity and endless duration is developed in the works of Boethius, Augustine, Schleiermacher and other philosophers, but it is not, I suggest, a distinction which is clearly reflected in the ordinary discourse of popular religion. Thus the timeless God of theology is not necessarily the eternal deity of religious faith, and philo sophers such as Malcolm and Plantinga are mistaken when they argue that 'our ordinary conception' of God renders senseless such questions as ' "How Psalm go, verse 2.</page><page sequence="10">368 PETER C. APPLEBY long has He existed?" " If our believer thought this question at all odd, he would probably think it childish, but he would also be prepared to answer it very simply. Of course it is not my intention to deny or disparage the importance of the considerations which have led philosophers and theologians to the kinds of conclusions they have reached about the divine nature. But I do think it is an important mistake to confuse 'ordinary' and technical conceptions, especially when the confusion results in conclusions like those drawn by Findlay. It seems reasonable to suppose that an adequate object of religious attitudes would have to be an eternal existent, in some sense, and one whose continuation in existence was not contingent upon the kinds of conditions which affect the lives of finite beings. A deity who could be here today and gone tomorrow, or one who could perish of malnutrition, would be no appropriate object of worship. But it does not follow that religion requires Spinoza's distinction between eternity and endless duration, or that a believer would be naive or foolish if he rejected the theological application of this distinction. If the theologian or the metaphysician wants support from the religious community for a certain conception of God, he will have to be more careful about it than he has been in the past, for Hume and Kant have clearly shown the dangers involved in the facile use of expressions like 'this everyone understands to be God'. The conclusion to be drawn from all this, I believe, is that the criteria of adequacy for objects of worship, such as they are, do in fact define a limited range of religiously acceptable deities, but one which is much broader than many philosophers have realised it to be. I have argued that if a reasonably intelligent and well-informed inhabitant of a modern civilisation were tempted to worship anything, he would require a deity of great power, knoweldge and goodness, one who is not subject to the usual vicissitudes of time, and one who is capable of personal communication with humans. These considerations rule out gods who are feeble, stupid or malevolent, and the ineffable Absolutes of many metaphysical systems. But they leave open a broad range between the outer limits of immanence and transcendence, a range which cannot be further restricted by analysis of religious attitudes alone. The conflicts between finitist and traditional theologies, between the theory of divine immutability and process meta physics, and between monotheism and polytheism will have to be resolved on other grounds. And so will the question whether there are in fact any appropriate objects of the attitudes of worship. 1 Cf. Alvin Plantinga, God and Other Minds (Cornell University Press, Ithaca, I967), pp. 88-9o. In this passage, Plantinga quotes a paragraph from Malcolm in which this view is advanced and expresses his own approval of it.</page></plain_text>
