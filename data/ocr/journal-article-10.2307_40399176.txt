<plain_text><page sequence="1">DIALECTICS: GENERAL PRINCIPLES Marx and Engels made fundamental criticisms of Hegel but they also acknowledged their indebtedness to him. "The real significance and the revolutionary character of the Hegelian philosophy is that it put an end to the notion that the attainments of human thought and action have final character" (Engels, Ludwig Feuerbach) . But they could accept neither the mysticism nor the anthropomorphism of the doctrine. "Hegel's dia- lectic," wrote Marx to Kugelmann, "is the fundamental principle of all dialectic only after its mystical form has been sloughed off. And that is precisely what distinguishes my method." "The mystification which dialec- tic suffers in Hegel's hands, by no means prevents him from being the first to present its general form of working in a comprehensive and con- scious manner. With him it is standing on its head. It must be turned right side up again, if you would discover the rational kernel within the mystical shell" (Marx, Preface to the Second Edition of Capital) . Nor could Marx and Engels accept the supremacy of Reason in nature. They could not conceive nature in the image of man's highest quality - of reason (and this quality, in its turn, in terms of God the creator of all things) . As true scientists they insisted on comprehending nature as it is, material and prior to human thought. "There could be no question of building the laws of dialectics into nature, but of discovering them in it and evolving them from it" (Engels, Anti-Dühring) . As a result of this development - which, incidentally, exemplifies the nature of dialectics - Marx and Engels established dialectical materialism. Once more we ask: What is dialectics, from the materialist's point of view? Many of us are able, no doubt, to answer this question by citing numerous instances from the field of social relations and perhaps also from other fields. Thus we may become convinced that dialectics is not an invented</page><page sequence="2">COMMUNICATIONS 5 2 1 hypothesis, but a rule of facts. However, the concept is broader than that. It constitutes the theoretical foundation of Marxism, a method of thought and action. In the following lines, let us attempt to sharpen this tool of under- standing and practice, by giving precise meaning to every term used in this connection. Let us, namely, formulate a statement of general principles - fourteen in all - with explanatory comments and quotations. II PROPOSITION I. Everything real is a complex of processes. Reality as we know it does not remain identical with itself for more than a moment. It is characterized by transitional character of all things. It is in flux. Common sense may assume that there are objects which change and move and also those which neither change nor move. Scientific investigations could not, however, discover objects of the latter kind. Neither in physical nature, nor in life, nor in man's thought do we find permanent things. Some thinkers, following Plato, have assumed nevertheless that there must be a transcendental reality in which "Ideas" remain unalterably and eternal- ly the same. Yet they have failed to provide any reliable evidence of this. The great basic thought that the world is not to be comprehended as a complex of ready-made things, but as a complex of processes, in which the things apparently stable no less than their mind-images in our heads, the concepts, go through an uninterrupted change of coming into being and passing away. (Engels, Ludwig Feuerbach) . PROPOSITION II. Process is not to be confused with change, in the absolute sense of the word. It is a continuity of becoming, a flux. In other words, it is characterized by both persistence and change, that is, by altera- tion. Generally speaking, every object undergoes change. Yet some aspects of it pass away, others persist. Apart from persistence, no development, no history could be possible. No object could endure. It could not be recognized as the same object in its two successive states. Thus, a man remains the same yet not quite the same man through all his experiences. A social order may exist for ages, despite its continual modifications. The sun shines every day upon the earth, yet in the course of ages its strength is slowly diminishing. All nature, from the minutest particles to the largest bodies, from a grain of sand to the sun, from a protozoon to a man, is ... in constant flux, in continual motion and alteration. (Engels, Dialectics of Nature) . Everything in nature happens dialectically, not metaphysically; it does not move in an eternally uniform, reiterating circle, but has a veritable history. (Engels, Anti- Dühring) .</page><page sequence="3">522 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY PROPOSITION III. No change can occur apart from adequate causes or actions. In our interconnected world, every change implies the existence and work of material forces. This principle has been familiar in scientific circles ever since Leukippus said that "nothing happens by chance, but everything through a cause and of necessity." But it is not always con- sistently applied by learned men. Many a mystic scholar - of whom we still have quite a few - tried to account for change through "Divine inter- vention," but they failed to provide any scientific confirmation of their contentions. Faith may resort to supernatural explanations, but it is no knowledge, in the scientific sense of the word. To those who deny causality, every law of nature is a hypothesis. . . . How shallow is the mentality of those who are satisfied with this! (Engels, Dialectics of Nature.) Causes and effects are thus moments of the universal inter-relationship among events. (Lenin, Leninsky Sbornik, IX, 161.) PROPOSITION IV. Persistence signifies the inadequacy or absence of forces acting in a particular respect; change, on the other hand, occurs when they are adequate. The difference between change and persistence, in their particular manifestations, can be due only to the uneven distribution of forces in the world as well as to the unequal and dissimilar reaction of things to these forces. Were causes and effects uniform throughout nature, all objects would change in all respects, and there would be neither variety nor persistence. Such a supposition is contrary to everyday observation and knowledge. Persistence underlies clearly all development and maturation. But it is contrasted to such basic changes as revolution in social develop- ment or mutation in biological evolution, although even in these cases a certain degree of persistence is undeniable. All motion by inertia, too, is characterized by persistence in time. PROPOSITION V. Change, as distinct from persistence, manifests transition of quantity into quality, or vice versa. Thus, the temperature of water can be raised only to the point when water, as a fluid, passes into steam; and its temperature can be lowered only to the point when it is transformed into ice. Paper or wood can be subjected to heat without burning; but at a certain moment, when the heat is strong enough, paper or wood bursts into flames, and its composition is appreciably changed. The human organism can withstand increasing amounts of poison, say of strychnine, but when one takes a large enough dosage, death ensues. The class struggle and class consciousness can be intensified for a considerable length of time; then a revolution breaks out, and society is qualitatively changed.</page><page sequence="4">COMMUNICATIONS 5^3 The quantitative change in molecular composition produces at each step a qualita- tively different body. (Engels, Anti-Dühring, 145.) Thus, it is impossible to alter the quality of a body without adding to, or sub- tracting from, matter some motion, that is, without quantitative modification of the body. (Engels, Dialectics of Nature.) PROPOSITION VI. Realities are subject to interaction of forces com- ing from outside as well as from inside a given pattern of existence. It is obvious that change can occur in a body not only as a result of outside interference, but also as a manifestation of inner structure or development - of its own nature. Inner forces do not exclude, of course, the simultan- eous action of outside forces; the latter may actually contribute to the manifestation and direction of the former. In other words, realities form structural complexes, such as society, class, organism, mind. Each of these complexes may be called a "pattern of existence," or structum. The proper- ties of each structum depend on its organization, from such complex patterns as the state to such comparatively simple patterns as a molecule. CH2O2 - Formic acid C2H4O2 - Acetic acid. C3H6O2 - Propionic acid C4H8O2 - Butyric acid CßHioOa- Valeric acid and so forth, up to C^H^O«, - Melissic acid. (Engels, Anti-Dühring.) PROPOSITION VII. Wherever and whenever a pattern of existence manifests continual changes due predominantly to forces contained within it, we speak of self-development. This is particularly evident of structa with a considerable degree of persistence, such as is observed in organic evolution, in institutions of society, in classes of people. They follow the line of development inherent in them and adjust themselves to given conditions. To be well understood in their functions, such structa require a study of their nature as well as of their environment. That is why we inquire into man's heredity, abilities, psychology. That is why we investi- gate the historical growth of private property, technology, class conscious- ness. PROPOSITION VIII. The conflict of inner forces is called a contra- diction. The word "contradiction" is used by Marx and Engels in a specific sense, distinct from mere "logical contradiction" by virtue of which two contradictory statements cannot be both true. In the terminology of dialectical materialism, the two factors of a contradiction can co-exist: they are both true. Nor is contradiction, in this interpretation, confined</page><page sequence="5">5^4 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY to the mental world. It is found in society, life and nature. It is not only thinkable: it is objectively real. And finally, contradiction so understood is not something that cannot be resolved or explained. Among things, it stimulates change. In thought, it provokes and demands its solution. Con- trary to "logical contradictions," a dialectical contradition is intelligible, whether it can be resolved in the immedate practice or not. The Marxists should not drop their hands, therefore, every time they face a contradiction in life or in theory. Invariably it is a clue for action or thought. In reality, it will be resolved one way or another. In thought, it can be resolved. It is neither a fallacy nor an eternal mystery. Quite the contrary, contradic- tions are of everyday occurrence; they are implied in such processes as history or life. Life is therefore also a contradiction which is present in things and processes them- selves, and which constantly asserts and solves itself; and as soon as the contradiction ceases, life too comes to an end, and death steps in. (Anti-Dühring, 138.) PROPOSITION IX. The factors of each contradiction are two; they are technically known as thesis and antithesis. They constitute the two phases or poles of inner development. The factor generating the conflict is thesis. The factor arising in conflict is antithesis. The former may be called positive; the latter, negative. The outcome of the disturbance created by a contradiction depends on many conditions and takes numerous forms, according to the type of phenomena and to the given confluence of forces. The antithesis may be suppressed, in which case the thesis will persist till a more serious or mature contradiction brings it to an end. Or else the thesis may be overcome, thus leading to a new pattern of existence. Private property, as such, as wealth, must preserve its own existence and, therefore, the existence of its opposite, the proletariat. This is the positive side of the contradiction, the self-satisfied private property. On the other hand, the proletariat, as such, is forced to reject itself and, consequently, also the conditions determining its opposition, making it the proletariat - private prop- erty. This is the negative side of the contradiction, its disturbance within itself, the self- abolished and self-abolishing private property. . . . Within the limits of this contradiction, the property owner represents the conservative side; the proletarian, the destructive side. From the former proceeds action aiming at the preservation of the contradiction; from the latter, action aiming at its abolition. . . . In being victorious, the proletariat by no means becomes an absolute side of society, as it can win only by abolishing itself and its contradiction. With the victory of the proletariat, disappear not only the proletariat itself, but also the contradiction determin- ing its existence - private property. (Marx and Engels, The Holy Family, v, III.) PROPOSITION X. The factors of a contradiction are not opposites in any absolute sense: their mutual dependence and interpénétration con-</page><page sequence="6">COMMUNICATIONS 525 stitute a unity. Separately, they have no existence: their natural rôle is to act upon, and to react to, each other. Take, for instance, the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. How could the former exist without profiting by the labor of the latter? How could the proletariat remain oppressed, if there were no class to oppress it? This characteristic of contradictions is known as the identity of opposites, or, preferably, as the unity of opposites. Thus, both conflict and unity are the necessary traits of a contradiction. In a closer study, we find that the two poles of a contradiction - the positive and the negative - are as inseparable from each other as they are opposed, and that, despite all their contradictoriness, they interpenetrate each other. (Engels, Anti-Dühring.) Not only does every unity contain within itself polar opposites but these internal opposites are mutually connected with each other; one aspect of a contradiction cannot exist without the other. (A Textbook of Marxist Philosophy, 162.) PROPOSITION XL The resolution of an inner conflict leads to a basic change in the structum, and the new state is called synthesis. A syn- thesis eliminates the previous contradiction, but this fact does not signify necessarily the completion of self-development. The emerging structum may be, in its turn, subjected to the influence of outside and inside forces. The former will partially modify the pattern of existence, with all the minor alterations this may imply; the latter will determine its further development and thus produce a fresh conflict, a new thesis and antithesis. PROPOSITION XII. Synthesis is by no means identical with anti- thesis freed from opposition. When an antithesis overcomes in struggle its own thesis, we observe the negation, or elimination, of the latter. Then the resolution of the conflict leads to a new direction of self-development. Thus, the victory of the proletariat, as the class of the oppressed, will remove the opposing class and result in a re-orientation of the victors, whereby they will abolish themselves as the oppressed. This constitutes the negation of the negation, which is precisely the meaning of synthesis. To negate does not mean, in dialectics, merely to say "No" and to declare a thing non-existing; nor to destroy it arbitrarily. As Spinoza said, omnis determinatio est negatio - all limitation is also a negation. And furthermore, the method of negation is determined, first, by the general nature, and second, by the specific nature of the given development. (Engels, Anti-Dühring.) The negation characteristic of, and essential to, dialectics - which certainly contains the element of negation, its most important element - is not outright negation, superfluous negation, skeptical negation, or hesitation; it is an aspect of connection, an aspect of development, which retains everything positive. (Lenin, Leninsky Sbornik, IX, 285.) PROPOSITION XIII. The final solution of a contradiction results</page><page sequence="7">5^6 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY when persistence arid change become one, that is to say, when self-develop- ment is no longer handicapped by a basic contradiction. Thus, in a class- less society progress will no longer be resisted, and no class will insist on the perpetuation of past ways and institution. Society as a whole will be free to advance according to its needs, advantages and possibilities of improve- ment. To apply this proposition to the field of knowledge, the correct ex- planation of first principles - such as causality or time - lies in comprehend- ing, or resolving, the contradictions underlying them and in demonstrating the ultimate necessity or unity of persistence and change. PROPOSITION XIV. The law of dialectics implies material opposi- tion in process, not verbal or logical opposition of static character. When we mistake the latter for the former, we have a misinterpretation of dialec- tical materialism. Thus, Plekhanov fell into this fallacy by deriving dialec- tics from logical opposites represented by "yes" and "no." Such pairs as being and non-being, human and superhuman, material and immaterial, temporary and eternal, thick and thin, black and white, etc., are not good examples of materialist dialectics, as they do not involve a real process. The simplest rule for recognizing a dialectical pair of opposites consists in that they belong to one process in which thesis stands for, calls for, or seeks persistence, while antithesis represents, leads to, or demands change; change itself, as passing of quantity into quality, or vice versa, is a sign of synthesis. In agreement with the above rule, a few examples of true dialectical processes can be given: Physical nature is based on the principle of causality, with inertia and action as the opposites. Life is based on the principle of motivation, with pleasure and pain as the opposites. Both terms are used here in a broader sense, the former standing also for satisfaction and approval; the latter, for dissatisfaction and disapproval. Mental life is based on the principle of experience, with the object and the subject as its opposites. Political society is based on the principle of class struggle, with two classes as the opposites. At the present moment, these two classes are the reactionary and the progressive forces. Art is based on the principle of creative activity, with imitation and originality as its opposites. RALPH B. WINN</page></plain_text>
