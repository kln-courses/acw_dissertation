<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Book of "The Awakened Ones91 of Cyakanyi Clementine M. Fatk-Nzuji Translated from the French by Allen R Roberts Let us begin with a smaall ivory tusk decorated with the figure of a walking human figure, its wide-open eye made from the head of a copper nail (Figs. 1-2). Aside from this figure and the serpents coil? ing about the base and point of the tusk, the object is covered with graphic symbols. Henri Morlighem bought the tusk between 1932 and 1938 in a small place called Panga-Ilunga in the lands of the Kalonji kaa Cimanga clans, 15 kilometers (about 9 miles) from Lake Munkamba in the East? ern Kasai administrative area of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC; see Fig. 3). Morlighem made his purchase while he was conducting research about Luba-Kasai cosmology and working with important initiates. He also photographed various subjects, such as the female initiate in Figure 4, without being aware, it would seem, of the relationships that existed among the ivory object, Luba cosmology, and the scarification motifs of the woman in his phorograph. Among populations of the Luba/Luluwa culture complex liv? ing in a vast region of south-central DRC, there exist mystical initiatory traditions important to politics, the economy, religion, esoteric thought, and other domains. Known by the generic term cyak?nyu these most significant institutions are composed of individuals who have distinguished themselves in their respec? tive domains of endeavor and who offer their communities the fruits of their success. The ivory tusk presented here is among the educational objects of cyakanyl initiation. To better under? stand the essential purpose of cyak?nyi and the nature and prob? able uses of this ivory tusk, one must begin with bakole, the people who constitute most of the adepts of this institution.1 BUKOLE: A SOCIETY OF GENEROSITY Bukole is a polysemic term signifying "a performance with results that are visible in concrete actions."2 The word desig? nates a social status to which a person may accede who has been economically successful and who addresses the develop? ment of the community with the results of such success. Bukole (pi. bakole) is open to men and women, with candidates exam? ined on the basis of wealth acquired through personal qualities such as physical strength, moral qualities, work and multiple professional abilities, cleverness, thriftiness, etc. The status of a mukole (a person of the society) is often acquired late in life due to the time needed to amass a fortune, but someone can become very wealthy and yet be refused access to bukole because of avarice or egotistical behavior. Virtually any pro? fession can lead to bukole if the candidate fulfills the required conditions, but most bakole are farmers, merchants, hunters, herders, blacksmiths, and healers. Among the gestures and achievements to be demonstrated by aspirants to bukole are protection of the community against harmful forces through offerings and sacrifices to ancestors and invisible beings; con? tributions to the growth of the community, clan, and family by providing bridewealth to orphans so that they may marry and have families; and helping group development by granting free access to lands so that people may farm.3 Desire to become a mukole may arise when someone feels she has amassed sufficient fortune to join this social class, but some? times a person is "called" to bukole by the ancestors, independent of the individual's will. In such a case, several sorts of mysterious events may presage such a call. Among the most common are dreaming of ancestors who ask for sacrifices and offerings, suf? fering from an illness difficult to identify, experiencing abnormal or inexplicable attacks, or becoming the victim of incomprehen 72 I africanarts winter 2010</page><page sequence="2">sible failures in endeavors in which she ordinarily excels. Neigh? bors or family members may also have bizarre dreams about the person. In short, her life is unsettled. If these phenomena persist, the aspirant will discuss what is happening with family and close friends and request their coun? sel. On the advice of a community elder or the village chief, the person will consult a diviner, who generally confirms that ances? tors are causing these problems, for they have chosen a future mukole. As a result, the individual may ask to be admitted to the ranks of the bakole. Again seeking the wisdom of elders and oth? ers, the aspirant will find a mukole who has been a member of the society for a long time and ask that the ritual be initiated that will make the aspirant a mukole as well. The officiant must be a mukole who sees to sacrifices and possesses a special knife for the purpose, received when he was admitted to the society as the ultimate symbol of social ascension.4 The ritual begins at dusk. The candidate invites members of her family, friends, and people already invested with the title of bakole to join the proceedings at her home. As each of these people arrives, he or she is given a small gift as a symbolic "ransom" that will "release [decrocher] the title." The officiant comes bringing his 1-2 Elephant tusk inscribed with mnemonic constellations of signs associated with cyak?nyl initi? ation, collected by Henri Morlighem in Panga-llunga, Belgian Congo (now DRC), c.1935. Front and back views. The tusk measures 65cm (251/2H) on the con? vex side, and 59cm (23%") on the concave side. The circumference is 20cm (8") at the base, 15.5cm (6") at the center, which is the point marked by the eye of the 4.8cm (2") tall carved human figure, visible in the middle of Fig. 1. It is 27.5cm (103/4M) from the base of the tusk to the figure's left foot and 30.2cm (12") from the base to the top of the figure's head.

This circle stands for plenitude, protection, and the state of perfection to which the would-be mukole aspires. The candidate enters this circle as the officiant invokes ancestors and other spirits friendly to the family. After prayers and invocations, the candidate is removed from the chalked circle and a first ritual meal is served to the officiant and his assistants, who may pass the night at the candidates or return to their own homes if they live nearby. winter 2010 alrlcanarts 73</page><page sequence="3">0 KD MO MO 400 600 law 1 ^^^L^L^H^L^Lp**" _ United*pravtne? 4inim m ^^^Hlf _ UnMdodMrtet &gt;WM - UMMiwitonllotra ? *" ?Oha Nondvvtto 3 Map of DRC.

FROM THE ATLAS DE L'ORGANISATION DE LA REPUBLIQUE DEMOCRATIQUE DU CONGO (2005) BY LEON DE SAINT MOULIN AND JEAN-LUC KALOMBO TSHIBANDA, CENTRE D'ETUDES POUR L'ACTION SOCIALE (CEPAS), KINSHASA, WITH PERMISSION That same evening, to assure that ancestors will watch over the proceedings with benevolence, the aspirant and officiant must abstain from sexual relations or other acts susceptible of "wast? ing energy." Already, women of the village have begun to prepare food for the next day. They must be careful to see that all prod? ucts of the earth are represented, recalling the first sowing seeds as per origin myths. Finally, all participants are invited to pay close attention to their dreams that night, for a nightmare con? cerning the ceremony would be a sign that the ancestors do not approve of the investiture and will not participate in it. The pro? ceedings must be stopped immediately should this occur, even if it seemed that the ancestors were the ones calling for the initia? tion in the first place. If the night reveals nothing in particular, people are again given small gifts as they reassemble, as material signs of the prosperity and largesse of the future mukole. Two or three bakole are sent to obtain a cutting from a sacred tree where benevolent spirits dwell.6 This will be planted at the close of the ceremony to mark the event. The task is accom? plished in silence to and from the place where the cutting is taken, and the branch is held respectfully in the arms, taking care that it not touch the ground. During the ceremonies, the cutting is placed on a mat reserved for the purpose. Beside this are placed the tools of all bakole present: hoes for farmers, anvils for blacksmiths, trophies and guns of hunters, various goods for merchants, as well as axes, arrows, harvesting baskets, gourds, and the like. The owners of these objects remain around them as the ritual proceeds through four stages: presentation of those participating, sacrifice of a chicken, homage to the elders, wel come of the candidate. Sometimes there is a fifth step: the return of the sacrificial knife. In the first stage, the officiant speaks before the assembly, explaining the state of his own wealth and enumerating all his great achievements, explaining through what personal means he has accomplished them. Then the candidate speaks about her wealth and what she has done with it, swearing that this fortune is exclusively the fruit of her own labor. Next, the officiant cuts the throat of a chicken with his sacrificial knife, then releases the fowl so that its death throes may be observed. The moment of death is significant, for the ceremony's next steps depend upon it. If the chicken falls with its breast to the ground, it is understood that the ancestors do not accept the ritual and all activities must cease. It is a good omen if the chicken lands on its back or either side, how? ever, for this means that the proceedings have been sanctioned by the ancestors. One can then begin homage to the elders. As this next step begins, a goat and other sacrificial animals are slain with the special knife. The officiant places the contents of the goats stomach in a hole in the ground prepared for this purpose, where the cutting of the sacred tree will be planted. During this time, women prepare the meat of the sacrificial animals. When the meal is ready, the officiant prays to the Supreme Being and gives the first food to the paternal grandfather of the candidate. If this person is living, the officiant puts a little of each food in his hand for him to chew and swallow. If he has already died, similar pieces of food are placed on the ground and the spirit of the grandfather is invoked to consume them. Only after this homage to the elders will the officiant direct his attention to the aspirant. This process was established by the ancestors at the beginning of time, and must be scrupulously respected, for we must first honor those who have given us life before we take care of ourselves. The investiture of the mukole is achieved through a particu? lar ritual called kudiisha mukole, or "invest or feed the new mukole" who must "swallow" and so integrate her new status. The officiant chooses the principle tool of the candidate from those amassed and places a piece of food on it, which the candi? date should take with her teeth and swallow without touching it. Next he runs everywhere in the village, the candidate following behind. He suddenly stops, puts another small piece of food on the candidates tool, and the act of swallowing without touching is repeated. This is done repeatedly, while the officiant calls the persons names, "X, son or daughter of Y, get up, hurry up! Your friends are already awake with the dawn, come quickly! It is time to collect your things." The running about continues for some time, and finally the officiant stops back in the candidates own courtyard. It is then that the cutting is planted that will become a spirit tree, the dwelling of ancestors, under the branches of which the mukole s family will hold important events?alliances, meals of communion with the ancestors, rituals of reconciliation, and the like. The festivities may now begin with songs exalting the newly invested mukole as well as panegyrics recalling the illustri? ous men and women of her lineage. In her new social status, a mukole may choose to become an officiant who sacrifices as a gauge of prestige. She will ask to receive a sacred knife for this, which is given by the officiant who, in total silence, obliges the new mukole to swear never to use the knife to let flow human blood, for the blood of the animals sacri 74 J alrtcamrts winter 2010</page><page sequence="4">need has replaced it. Thereafter, the new mukole can participate as an officiant in rituals requiring the sacrifice of an animal. It is upon accession to the status of mukole that a path begins lead? ing to the "awakening" of mystical initiation in cyakanyi.7 Bukole status is prestigious, but for personal evolution and to increase ones influence in the community, one may decide to go farther through the spiritual quest and deepening of the self that brings one to cyakanyi. CYAKANYI, A STATE OF AWAKENING AND HARMONY The conceptual field of the word cyakanyi is vast, coming from the verb -akan- meaning 'to adjust or adjust oneself, to be or to put in order, to be in agreement or concord, to adapt, harmo? nize or harmonize oneself, to complete oneself.' In the specific context of this article, however, several usages stand out: the act of being accomplished, in harmony with ones nature, in accord with one interior person, while the word may also suggest that which permits attaining such a state. Anyone who approaches the philosophical ideal of cyakanyi is called a mut?nga (pi. bat?nga), an accomplished or well-adjusted one, and an initiate or mutabala (pi. batabala), one whose eyes are open, one who is awakened. Those bakole who are initiated into cyakanyi continue to be known as bakole as well, and in this way the word is some? times used as a synonym for the initiated. Finally, the cyakanyi, as an initiatory institution, is associated with the cyanda or place of transformation. The verb root -and- signifies ?to transform, change, become something else,' which is the principal goal of an initiation. Within cyakanyi, such transformation involves the philosophical, religious, and social aspects of those engaged. Cyakanyi is a mystical initiation of a high order, an individual progression chosen freely, and this even if the initiated is a mem? ber of another initiatory institution. It is open only to men and women who personally ask to join. It does not demand special seclusion, but members regularly organize empowering retreats in secret places known to their closed circles. When I explain the institution of cyakanyi to members of Congolese ethnocul tural complexes other than Luba-Kasai, they affirm that under local names and specificities tied to systems of kinship and the sociopolitical organization of each ethnic group, traces of the same philosophical ideal as that of cyakanyi are to be found as well. Many initiatory institutions have not survived the collapse of the animist religions that fostered them. When one asks of great initiates what cyakanyi might be, the response is rapid and to the point: "Cyak?ndi is our humanity." Such an assertion does not offer the precise sense of the word, but speaks to the state of being that one pursues by engaging this path. A diversity of objects associated with cyakanyi, including the ivory tusk we began by considering as well as the composition of scarified signs, constitute genuine mementos recapitulating cosmogony and cosmic laws. At the level of cyakanyi initiation, the objective is no longer to socialize or to lend responsibility to someone; the principal characteristic is no longer "to die a symbolic death so as to be reborn"; rather, one seeks to attain an elevated ideal, a level of spiritual perfection that "adjusts" the ini? tiate, bringing her interior person into agreement with the sur? rounding world so as to create a microcosm in the image of the universe itself. The process undertaken leads the person through 4 Photograph of woman's torso bearing scarifica? tion patterns associated with cyakanyl initiation, taken at Panga-llunga, Belgian Congo (now DRC), by Henri Morleghem, c.1935. PHOTO: WITH PERMISSION stages similar to the great steps of creation, so as to open the ini? tiate to the comprehension of herself and to knowledge of the cosmogony of the group.8 Such is the plural itinerary recalled in the ivory tusk presented here. When the great initiated ones of cyakanyl receive a new mem? ber, they welcome him or her with this little passage: The child is asleep. Lying down. She sits on one buttock. Falls. Sits on the other. Falls again. She seeks to sit again. Wobbles. Finally, she sits. Remains a long time in this position while hitting the earth with the palms of her hands. One day, she extends her arms forward. Pushes the hands on the ground. Bends the knees. Lies on the stomach. The guardian arises again. The child tries again. And again. And here she is, advancing on all fours. She moves all around in this position. In a relaxed way. For a long time. One day, she tries to stand up. Cannot do so alone. The guardian offers her two hands, makes her walk a few steps toward her.10 Lets go of one hand, then the other. Left to him- or herself, the child staggers, falls, staggers again, seeks something to hold onto. She stands. Staggers. Staggers again. Here she is, walking. Alone. And so begins her wandering. From the last lines to the first, in five sequences, the welcoming text reminds the candidate that the path that she has engaged is similar to that taken by a human being, from first coming into the world to adult age: (1) To be sleeping lying down: innocence, igno? rance, hence lack of consciousness, a sentiment of security; (2) to winter 2010 afrlcan arts | 75</page><page sequence="5">5-8 Instruments of work, hunting, ritual, and battle of the sorts displayed during cyakanyi initiation.

TEACHINGS OF MYTH The person invested in cyakanyi seeks to harmonize her per? sonality, to adjust the social person to the interior person. She wishes to reconstitute her equilibrium and to rediscover her ini? tial state as a creature, that is, that of a total being with multiple complementary poles. In her evolution toward harmony, myths of creation guide her quest step by step, allowing her to discover the hidden side of things. Little by little, this will give her a par? ticular vision of the world and determine her relationships with the things and beings that inhabit this world. Below we shall derive a few lessons from myth from among those that seem the most essential with regard to the initiatory ideal of cyakanyi. When it seems helpful to comprehension, these materials are accompanied by practical examples. The universe is ordered by a system of analogies and mir? rors, the cosmic world being similar to the visible, but inverted. Knowledge flowing from this teaching is made practical by, for instance, healers, because sick people are considered to possess a "disadjustment" [desajustement] between physical constituents of the person (that have their basis in the material body) and their doubles (who have their realm in the cosmic world). The world is governed by a system of correspondences. All things that exist in the universe of creatures have correspond? ing things in the cosmos among spiritual beings. This teaching is made practical, among other ways, by herbal healers. Their actions are based upon a belief that the Supreme Being has put at the disposition of mankind all things that may resolve prob? lems of health through a system of correspondences: the ear has its correspondent in such-and-such a plant, whose sap can be used to treat the ear if it is sick. The stomach has its correspon? dent in such-and-such a root; stomach upset can be healed if one drinks an extract of this root constituted of elements related to those of the stomach, etc. The supernatural world intersects with the human world in a hierarchy that places above all things a Creative Principle, fol? lowed by spirits, and then the ancestors, thanks to whom life is transmitted to each person.11 The great priests and officiants scrupulously respect this teaching when they preside over ritu? als. Above, we saw that an homage to the elders constituted an incontrovertible stage in the investiture of a mukole. The officiant is obligated to render homage to the Creator, then to make an offering to the grandfather of the postulant, and only then turn to the candidate herself. Every creature is a totality constituted by four poles (princi? ples) that are complementary and crossed, of which two, in the horizontal plane, are male and female, and two, in the vertical axis, are elder and younger. In the populations that concern us here, such an hierarchical conception accords great importance to primogeniture and to older persons in the political, social, and family organization?ancestors who are founders of lin? eages, eldest sons, etc. The same model is at the origin of certain rituals for which the goal is to "specify the sex" of an individual, who must take her or his place without ambiguity as a woman or man in the community. In the universe, all is related and interdependent. Creatures are related to their Creator and amongst themselves. This teach? ing explains the respect for nature shown by the populations 76 j afrlcanarts winter 2010</page><page sequence="6">that concern us here: to interfere with some element of nature without valid reason is to destabilize the order of things, and amongst these "things," the individual him- or herself. From this come various rituals and prayers preceding the clearing of fields, fishing, hunting?in brief, any act that risks budging something from its place. The whole universe is governed by an uninterrupted action of forces and energies. This vision leads to the recognition in cer? tain persons of special powers of a spiritual order that predispose them to lead the community. Such is the case of the Awakened Ones of Cyak?nyiy the case of those who read the invisible, of those who protect against the forces of evil, of those who have the power of political decision and, also, of those who manipu? late wicked forces and against whom one must protect oneself. That which is within is more powerful than that which is exte? rior. This teaching underscores the superiority of interior life over "visible" life, for it is interior life that helps one learn to identify many alliances as destructors of life?and so from this, the importance given to certain categories of persons.

The first five, starting at the base and leading toward to tip, correspond to human development and the stages of the world's creation as recounted in cosmogony. In Cyakanyi, the sixth and seventh steps refer to the last words of welcome to the postulant, "Here she is, walking. Alone. / And so begins her wandering." They are reserved for personal inner development that is not discussed in detail in the present article. Associa? tions among the welcoming words, origin myth, and graphic symbols permit the reading of inscriptions such as those shown here. opment of interior life has made some the allies of life and the denunciators of those who destroy others. It is a matter of, for instance, therapeutic healers who create remedies and who care for the sick, or diviners, mediums, geomancers, and others who identify and drive out [debusquer] sorcerers and other malevo? lent persons who may do harm. Nothing is static. Everything evolves in perpetual movement. Given the interactions and interrelationships among things, the nature of a thing (a situation) constantly changes to engender something else, and this without end. This teaching is made practical, for example, in the case of marriage ceremonies in which the paternal aunt plays the role of the father. Everything has already existed; everything returns. There is nothing new on earth; the grass that we feel under our feet has already preceded us. All is cyclical, whence, among other things, conception, through which certain deceased family members return through new births. Nothing is really free of cost [gratuit], what one gains replaces what one gives up; to possess something, one must winter 2010 afrieuarts 77</page><page sequence="7">get rid of something else. Harmony {cyakanyl) is maintained through sacrifice. Real transmission is progressive. Knowledge should be trans? mitted progressively, for not everyone has the same capacity to understand, nor at the same moment. INITIATORY WISDOM: THE INSCRIPTIONS OF AN IVORY TUSK These mythical teachings and many more are inscribed on the ivory tusk of the Awakened Ones of Cyakanyl and on the body of the great initiate in the form of graphic symbols. The person who respects these teachings and integrates them into her life will distinguish herself through remarkable qualities such as moderation, humility, generosity, compassion, self-control, tem? perance, equity, sharp intuition, and the like. In the ideal phi? losophy of cyakanyl, to live according to the teachings of myth is to adjust the constituent parts of ones person to meet the image of the universe articulated by myth and to make all ones enter? prises correspond to such an adjustment. It is to make ones con? science correspond to the cosmic conscience. Turning again to the ivory tusk, different forms of spiral cover a large part of the surface. They alternate with sequences of cisaka, or signs of the Guide (see below), set off by horizon tal lines as markers of stages. At the base (Fig. 10) one finds the stylized sign of the water serpent, with a figurative rendering of the same snake at the tip of the tusk (Fig. 11). In the center, an initiate with its one visible eye wide open is depicting walking forward (Fig. 12). The spiral is a cosmic sign bearing rich and powerful symbol? ism referring to, among other things, first creation, the setting in motion, conception, gestation, birth, cyclical movements of life, and so forth. In the context of cyakanyl teachings, the spi? ral suggests an initial state from which a consciousness of being will be born, as well as vital movement?in other words, the state in which the postulant finds herself during cyakanyl and all the states to be passed through each time a stage of the ritual process is achieved: a fetal state, the beginning of new cyclical movement in life, elan for and in a new life. The double spiral refers to the androgynous original status, when a male/female god proceeded to the creation of things, each possessing unto itself both mascu? line and feminine principles. A candidate for cyakanyl does not begin initiation in a profane state, nor does she die in a "profane" status to be reborn through ritual. Rather, she advances from an already advanced summit to a superior status by beginning at the lowest level of this next pro 78 I alrtcanarts winter 2010</page><page sequence="8">/./ iU ! ???????? gression. In this way, mystical initiation to cyakanyl is cumula? tive, for one does not efface the other forms of initiation through which one has passed. This principle is revealed in a sequence from the welcoming text as one discovers those close around oneself, and the child moves to a vision of the environment that is more extensive than that understood before. Cis?ka?"signs of the Guide"?are derived from the verb kus?ka that signifies, among other things, "to guide, push ahead, lead, fall in with the mood of something [mettre au diapason], frame or define." As this name implies, cis?ka motifs between the sequences of spirals of the tusks engraved surface recall the importance of "framing" [encadrement] the initiate at each new stage of her evolution. In the text of welcoming, this principle is contained in the lines, "One day, she tries to stand up. Cannot do so alone. The guardian offers her two hands, makes her walk a few steps toward her. Lets go of one hand, then the other." The serpent as a symbol among the tusks inscriptions refers to the rich symbolism of Luba origin myths, which is so complex and ambivalent.11 As a prefiguration of the human being, the ser? pent permits the perfection of creation, for it was created as an hermaphrodite and held something of all terrestrial species to be created after the snake itself. The serpent symbolizes revelation (opposite page, l-r) 10-11 Details of spirals, serpents, connect? ing motifs, and an open-eyed initiate among the symbolic inscriptions on an elephant tusk associated with cyakanyi initiation collected by Henri Morlighem in Panga-llunga, Belgian Congo (now DRC), c.1935.

PHOTO: PRIVATE COLLECTION, WITH PERMISSION. of the secret and the progression of humanity; it informs of the secrets of creation, bringing forth mankind from a state of igno? rance. But the serpent is also a symbol of disorder, for the secret it reveals introduces disorder and rebellion of man against Maweeja Nnangila, its creator. Yet the serpent saves humanity, for during the period when it begins to endlessly rain upon the lands inhab? ited by people, it is the breath of the male and female serpent that forms mwanza-nkongoloy the rainbow that terminates the storms. Again as the welcoming text has it, "Left to herself, the child staggers, falls, staggers again, seeks something to hold onto. She stands. Staggers. Staggers again. Here she is, walking. Alone. And so begins her wandering." To attain a certain level within cyakanyi initiation does not mean that the person has achieved the status of someone who knows, who has "arrived." On the con? trary, it is at this precise moment that her consciousness opens to new realities heretofore unsuspected. New questions arise that put the candidate on a path through a succession of tentative steps, teachings, and new progressions. This is the way the path of accomplishment will continue until death itself. The "book" of cyakanyi?that is, its teachings through inscrip? tions and ritual processes?contains many other messages con? cerning the symbolism of numbers, as abundantly represented on the surface of the ivory tusk; but these cannot be broached here. As with other objects used in the great Luba initiatory institu? tions, the "book" is a means and "place" for the transmission of memory; again, this subject cannot be considered here (but see Roberts and Roberts 1996). QUESTIONS OF METHOD Let us end with a consideration of methodology. Semiological analysis of an ivory tusk has been undertaken through application of "the theory of four criteria" discussed in my earlier publications (Faik-Nzuji 1992, 2000) and outlined again below. This approach is based upon the following principle: In a homogenous cultural con? text, four criteria permit an understanding of the logic of a sym? bolic system found in such a context and the deciphering of such symbols. The more elevated the number of criteria applied, the more one approaches "truth" from the perspective of those holding such knowledge. But the present state of my knowledge of African cultures and symbols leads me to broaden this theory to include other cultural facts while remaining within the same logic. For example, to understand a cultural composition of whatever sort so that one is as close as possible to the way that the people themselves understand the matter, such a composition must be understood through a progression of these points: WINTER 2010 8tMean IMS 79</page><page sequence="9">1. as a composition isolated from said culture, outside of any particular context; 2. in the relationships this composition has with other traits present in the same context, with these latter also examined as aspects of the culture in question; 3. in the relationship between this composition and the rest of the culture, keeping in mind the context and the motivations of its use, so implying a "cultural competence" on the part of the researcher; 4. taking into consideration the linguistic implications of terms that designate the cultural composition, within con? ceptual fields to which they belong and in the functioning of language in its different aspects (current, figurative, etc.), so implying the "linguistic competence" of the researcher. Basing these reflections on my earlier studies, we can suggest that combined with other approaches of the humane sciences, this "theory of four criteria" will reveal elaborated structures as governed by rules responding to logical codes illuminating a coherent grammar of cultural compositions. Several research tools are indispensable to such an approach. At first I felt intuitively that a form of cultural competence was necessary to an understanding of thought and the psychosocial life of those sharing it; and now, as I have increasingly advanced my discoveries in African thought, I am convinced that this is the case.121 come to this sense of "cultural competence" from the perspectives of "linguistic competence" that are well established. This implies that the researcher must be imbued, in one way or another, with the culture under study, whether this is from birth and having lived concretely within the cultural environment, or by observing this culture in its natural milieu as a participant for a long period. The degree of cultural competence must be suf? ficiently high so as to permit the researcher to be able to distin? guish a fact that is specific to the culture rather than being more ordinary; to possess implicit extra-contextual knowledge that will assist in recognizing and understanding the internal logic of a cultural act; and to be able to establish the links, on the one hand, between cultural acts realized in different contexts, and on the other, between a cultural fact and others related to it, how? ever near or distant. Despite the great qualities of certain scientific studies concern? ing African languages and cultures, those knowing African cul? tures best are to be found in their own natural milieus, where they are known as such by those turning to them for just such knowl? edge in their lives as lived. To possess reliable tools concerning fundamental cultures of Africa consists, when possible, of refer? ence to local savants and philosophers, to oral narratives and all the other ways of access to knowledge presented on the continent. In a way, knowledge of Africa comes from two complementary visions of knowledge, one through classical scientific traditions, born in an historical context and in geographical spaces other than African, the other based upon modes of conservation, trans? mission, and circulations of knowledge specific to Africans. This demands that researchers, over and above theoretical knowledge of their discipline, must possess certain linguistic tools and an important cultural "baggage." Certainly, the path can prove long? like that of the initiatory quest. Such is the journey to be related next, concerning my own work leading to the present article, as an illustration of such a process of discovery. RESEARCH BY TENTATIVE STEPS1* 1992. I met Marie-Jeanne Morlighem when, having retired, she had the intention to reedit Une bible noire (1973) written by her father. 1994. Marie-Jeanne Morlighem took a course on African lin? guistics that I was teaching at the Catholic University of Louvain, in Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium. Little by little, a relationship was established between us, and Ms. Morlighem told me of research notes left by her father from his studies of traditions and customs of the Luba-Kasai between 1927 and 1965, when he was work? ing as a medical auxiliary. She wished to assemble these notes into a document so as to conserve them. It was also at this time that she showed me the ivory tusk discussed in the present arti? cle, that had belonged to her father and that she had inherited at his death in 1982. Knowing that I was interested in symbolic traces and scarification, she gave me copies of photographs taken by her father in different regions of the Kasai. That same year, Mabila Kalanda came to Belgium; he had had a long correspon? dence with Morlighem about Luba-Kasai cosmogony and had undertaken research among initiated people who had worked with the latter. I expressed my intuitions concerning the links among cosmogony, inscriptions upon the tusk, and the photo? graph of a woman's scarification. Mabila Kalanda also noticed the resemblance but could not explain the function or significa? tion of the inscribed signs of the woman's scarification patterns, nor could he establish a link between these and cyakanyi 1996. When I was invited to Kinshasa to offer a symposium on religious symbolism at the African Institute of Mission Science of the Congregation of Oblates of Mary Immaculate, I brought along a photograph of the initiated woman and a drawing of the tusks inscriptions in order to find out if, among elderly Luba Kasai people living in Kinshasa, there might be someone who could explain them to me. Other than a unanimous sense that both were associated with cyakanyi as a world of transformation, I could gain no other explanations. 2003.1 was invited to offer an inaugural conference at the Sym? posium of the Fourth Panafrican Festival of Music (FESPAM) in Brazzaville and Kinshasa, after which I traveled to the Kasai to conduct genealogical research in Boya, the village of my father bringing with me the photo of the scarified woman and the draw? ing of the inscribed tusk. I found five people versed in genealogy within the great cultural complex practicing cyakanyi: Mukendi Nkonku, Tshibamba wa Kabengele, Kand? wa Mwamba, Kany ind? wa Mulumba, and Mbiya Lus?ng?. Although they were all well known throughout the region as connoisseurs of tradi? tion, none would speak to me alone, for all wished to be pres? ent to confirm each other. After asking all my questions about lineage genealogy, I took out my photo and drawing. Without hesitation, the honorable Mukendi Nkonku asked me, "Where did you find these things of bukoleV" He looked at them again and said "Yes, these are marks practiced in cyand?, the place of 8o I africanarts winter 2010</page><page sequence="10">transformation." There followed a long discussion in which the pieces of the puzzle I had been pursuing for ten years began to take their places. The culmination came as one of the wise men recited the text of welcoming for a postulant to cyakanyl that I had never heard before. When he pronounced the last phrases, "Left to herself, the child staggers, falls, staggers again, seeks something to hold onto. She stands. Staggers. Staggers again. Here she is, walking. Alone. And so begins her wandering," the stages of initiation, symbols, and the entire cosmology became evident, as though my own eyes were opened for the first time. In effect, knowing the names of signs in Ciluba (the language of Luba-Kasai people) permitted me to explore the lexico-semantic fields necessary to know the function and signification of these symbols. The theory of four criteria made me understand the link between the social institution of bukole and the iniatiatory institution of cyakanyl. The woman's scarification seen in the photograph confirmed in a concrete manner how cyakanyl was open to both men and women. Knowledge of graphic and verbal symbols helped me to discover the laws of teaching inscribed on the ivory tusk. I understood why the personage on the tusk is represented as walking with large feet and why his one wide eye is enormous, disproportionate to the rest of his body. 2009. Since my return from the Congo, I have carefully pre? served these discoveries, allowing more than five years to flow between the emotions of my research in the Congo and the release of these fragments of knowledge to these pages.

Notes Thanks are extended to Ms. Marie-Jeanne Morlighem for making her late fathers research notes available to me, to the current owners of the ivory tusk for permission to illustrate it here, to Leon de Saint Moulin for permis? sion to publish the map accompanying this article, and to the director of the Centro Saverliano Animazione Missionaria of Parma, Italy, for permission to publish photographs of objects in their collections. 1 It is only after several years of research that I have become able to "read" and understand a significant number of the messages transmitted by this tusk. The method that I follow is explained in the last section of this article. Data gathered in the Congo have been complemented by the cosmogony gathered by Fourche and Morlighem and published as Une bible noire (1973), as well as Morlighems notes on initiatory traditions of the region; the results of surveys about cosmology conducted among wise elders of cyakanyi by Mabika Kalanda and published as La Revelation du Tiakani (1992); anthropological research on bukole undertaken by Bamuinikile Mudiasa Mukala and presented as a BA thesis at the National University of Zaire, Lubumbashi (1975); and my own knowledge of initiation symbol? ism and traditions obtained throughout my career, and more specifically during research in the DRC in 2003. 2 Translator s note: Bukole is the society in ques? tion, with the stative prefix suggesting an order or inclu sivity. One member of bukole is a mukole, while two are bakole, following the singular and plural prefixes denot? ing life in central African Bantu languages. Follow? ing the author s choice, the terms bukole and cyakanyi will not be capitalized, although they might be when referring to the names of specific initiation societies, following anglophone conventions addressed to central African societies. 3 Translators note: The author writes in the pres? ent tense, presumably because reference is made to generalities rather than to any particular performance event. Both men and women may become members of bukole, but pronouns in Bantu languages are not gendered, so that one can only know if one is speaking about a male or female subject through further elabora? tion. To avoid the awkward "s/he" and "his or her" in English, female pronouns will be used in this transla? tion, in accord with the fact that the first allusion to a initiate, via Morlighems photograph of a scarified torso, is to a woman. 4 Translator s note: As an arbitrary choice to dis? tinguish the role from the candidate, the masculine pro? noun is used with regard to Bukole officiants, although it is possible that women may serve or have served in this role. 5 Translator s note: Although the author uses the French word kaolin, the likelihood is that the substance in question is chalk rather than the far rarer kaolin, with the two minerals differentiated chemically. 6 Translators note: The author refers to this tree as pignon d'Inde, or "Indian pinon"; it is not clear to what sort of tree this might refer in English. 7 Because mukole status is based upon personal success the fruits of which are directed toward service to the community, neither the title nor the insignia of power associated with bukole may be inherited. The only privi? lege of children of a mukole is to participate in the meals of bakole to which their parents are invited. Translator s note: The French verb eveiller in this sentence and the title of the present paper means "to awaken" but with an added sense of cognizance and vigilance. 8 Translator s note: Those familiar with the dilem? mas of translation between French and English will know that words for "knowledge" in English gloss the more particular senses of words like connaissance and savoir in French. 9 Translator s note: The term la gardienne is used by the author here, specifically in the feminine, with le gardien the masculine in French. 10 Translators note: The authors phrase here is Principe createur, hence Creative Principle rather than Principal Creator. Upper case is the author s. Later in the same passage, the term Creator is used, presum? ably with reference to the Creative Principle already mentioned but lending a more anthropomorphic sense to almighty power. 11 Translators note: Discussions of Luba origin myths readily available in English include Reefe 1981, Heusch 1982, and Mudimbe 1991. 12 See, for example, Faik-Nzuji and Ngonga-ke Mbembe 2004, and Ngonga-ke-Mbembe and Faik Nzuji 2008. 13 Translator s note: The author uses the term t?tonnement here and at several other points in the text, as a word that has a spread of figurative meanings derived from the more literal sense?with an ono matopoetic sense as well?of a sight-impaired person tapping a stick as an unknown place is explored. The term can mean "groping about, feeling ones way," make a "tentative effort" or "experiment by trial and error," but with an added sense of "staggering," "fumbling" or "groping" (Dubois et al. 1981: 723).
