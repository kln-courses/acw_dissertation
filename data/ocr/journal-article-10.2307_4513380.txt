Dodd, Mead &amp; Company, New York 10003. 192 pp. $22.95 (hardcover), $12.95 (paperback).-This is a book of discoveries, discoveries by the author and artist, Clare Walker Leslie, and discoveries by the reader. That is the wonder of drawings, you can look and appreciate what the artist saw and drew, but you can also see relationships of which the artist was unaware, and you can look through the entire book only to return later and discover in the very same drawing something entirely new. Leslie's sketches are deceptive. They appear simple, yet they capture the essence of her plant, animal, and human subjects. The pencilled notes that accompany the sketches call attention to particular details, actions, or questions that lead to a particular sketch. These same notes cause one to stop and study the sketch or, in combination with the sketch, to recall a similar incident from one's own experience. There is a lot of joy in shared experiences and the balance between sketches and brief, suggestive notes is just enough to evoke one's own memories without overwhelming them in the author's own words. This is not a coffee-table book to be shown to impressionable friends. It is a book to be enjoyed in a quiet hour when you can turn your imagination loose and let the sketches and notes come alive in your mind's eye.-Edward H. Burtt Jr. 66. Last of the curlews. F. Bodsworth. 1987. Dodd, Mead &amp; Company, New York 10003. 160 pp. $17.95 (hardcover), $8.95 (paperback).-As scientists we discuss the plight of vanishing species in professional journals, report our findings to government in environ- mental impact statements, or, occasionally, talk to reporters who occasionally write or talk about endangered species in newspapers or on the local news that whets our appetites for Tom Brokaw, Peter Jennings, or Dan Rather. We rarely use fiction to put the case of an endangered species before the public, yet that is exactly what Bodsworth has done in "Last of the curlews." Don't get the wrong idea. This is not a cute, anthropomorphic story. The central character is a male Eskimo Curlew endowed with believable characteristics by a narrator who remains omniscient and objective. The book opens on the Arctic tundra, in the territory of a male Eskimo Curlew who awaits the arrival of a mate and occasionally courts female Hudsonian Curlews, but never for long. For the fourth year no female arrives and the male eventually heads southeast to Labrador where it fattens before the long journey to South America. We follow him to the pampas, where he explores its estuaries, its grassland, and turns west to begin his spring migration. After crossing the Andes . .., but you will not enjoy the story if I continue my summation. Bodsworth's prose is superb. Biological details come alive before your mind's eye and you look at familiar phenomena with a new perspective. For example the over water migration of the curlew accompanied by a flock of Black-bellied Plovers: The flock slogged on, a few feet above the sea, struggling laboriously over each crest and snatching a few niggardly seconds of partial rest in the quieter, protected air of each trough. Once a long trough lifted into a seething comber many feet higher than those preceding and the spray of its crest lashed the curlew's wings. The curlew had to battle a maelstrom of air currents for several seconds to keep airborne. When the wave passed two more of the plovers failed to re-appear. But the spray melted much of the snow clinging to the curlew's wingtip feathers. For a minute his unburdened wings could bite into the air with all their old power. Scientific detail is presented concisely and accurately, but one hardly thinks of that as you picture the elemental struggle. Here is natural selection. Here is a perspective on migration and fitness that I knew existed, but had never had so graphically portrayed. Bodsworth has further heightened the tension of the book by interspersing his fictional account with published scientific reports of the curlew's biology and decline. These come at intervals, like news flashes, and, like news flashes, they contribute to a mounting sense of despair. The effect is stunning. The book, originally published in 1954, is republished by Dodd, Mead &amp; Company as part of its Edwin Way Teale Library of Nature Classics. The book is superbly illustrated by T. M. Shortt, whose illustrations graced the original edition, and Michael McCurdy, whose wood engravings were commissioned for this special edition. The publisher, author, and artists are to be congratulated on a work that seeks to awaken our sensibilities to the world around us and the desperate need for preservation of our vanishing wildlife.</page><page sequence="2">426] Recent Literature J. Field Ornithol. Autumn 1988 In keeping with Bodsworth's use of scientific reports I close optimistically with the following account: The eskimo curlew (Numenius borealis) has been thought by some people to be extinct or nearly so. A flurry of observations in coastal Texas in the early 1960s raised speculation that the bird still survived at that time. But few observations were made in the following years, and hopes again diminished. In the 1980s, however, there have been several observations of this species on migration in the central and southern United States and in several areas of Canada. One bird was reported on the Platte River in Nebraska in mid-April 1987. At least two more were reported along the Texas coast in late April and early May 1987. Finally, in late May, Canadian Wildlife Service biologists found a pair in the Canadian Arctic. Preliminary reports indicated that a nest may have been located. In response to the increased number of observations of eskimo curlews, a group of shorebird specialists from the United States and Canada at the recent American Ornithologists' Union meeting in San Francisco met to discuss ideas for recovering the species from the brink of extinction. Among the ideas mentioned were increasing public awareness that the species is not extinct; characterizing migration, winter, and nesting habitat; and protecting and managing known migration stopover areas (Endangered Species Technical Bulletin 12, 1987).-Edward H. Burtt Jr. 67. Inventory of bird egg collections of North America, 1985. L. F. Kiff and D. J. Hough. 1985. American Ornithologists' Union and Oklahoma Biological Survey, Norman, Oklahoma. 259 pp.-The Inventory contains information on 72 collections that contain 463,000 sets of eggs, over 93% of the sets in the known egg collections of North America. The book consists of two tables in which the sets of eggs are listed by species and collection, the 36 largest collections in Table 1 and 36 smaller collections in Table 2. The systematic listing is the same used for the skeleton (Wood, Zusi, and Jenkinson. World inventory of avian skeletal specimens. American Ornithologists' Union and Oklahoma Biological Survey, Norman, Oklahoma, 1982a) and spirit inventories (Wood, Zusi, and Jenkinson. World inventory of avian spirit specimens. American Ornithologists' Union and Oklahoma Bio- logical Survey, Norman, Oklahoma, 1982b). The number of sets of eggs and the number of species represented are given for each collection along with the name and address of the curator. Thus the Inventory should promote use of the collections by making them, their holdings, and addresses known to ornithologists throughout the world. Since most egg sets contain information on clutch size, nest site, and often contain information on fertility and date of laying, the records that accompany the eggs may yield valuable information on changes in the breeding biology of species over the last 100 yr. In addition we know little about geographical variation in eggs, changes in shell composition, or the function of colors and surface texture in eggs. The Inventory alerts ornithologists to the existence of suitable study material and the means for gaining access to that material.-Edward H. Burtt Jr.</page></plain_text>
