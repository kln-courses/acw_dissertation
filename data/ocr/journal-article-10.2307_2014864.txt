<plain_text><page sequence="1">VOL. XXVI, No. 25. DECEMBER 5, 1929 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY ART AND CULTURE I THINK it was only four years ago that I discovered how anthro- pologists use the word "culture," though I had been long familiar with the term Kulturgeschichte. Culture in the old acade- mic sense of the word, something acquired in nice families, in good society, in college, at a university, the polish of intellectual con- servatism, the pattern of a tradition, academic good form, was an old story. But the culture of the Esquimaux, of the Etruscans, of the Pueblo Indians, and in the same sense, of the world of Middle- town, of France, of Scotland, that was an idea that first came to me when I read Wistler's Man and Culture. There may be some who are still as retarded as I then was. Of course, I write largely for my own clarification. The Kultur or culture of a particular people at a particular time is a complex of industries, commerce, occupations, techniques, habits, adjustments to soil and climate, history real or imagined, folklore, superstitions, mythology, religion, war, ceremonial customs, etc.: all that is blended together to make a tribe or a nation what it is. Each of these distinguishable aspects is called a trait; a culture is a com- plex of interlocking traits. Religion is one of these traits, philosophy is another, art is another, and as a trait it more or less interlocks with other traits, more or less at different times, and, it is safe to say, now more with one trait, now more with another; now more with religion, now more with history, now more with the interest in nature. A group of interesting writers have put together a book on a most interesting theme, Art and Civilization.' We are told in the preface that, like its seven predecessors, the book resulted from a conference, the seventh, at the Unity History School held in Vienna in 1923. Mr. Marvin's introduction aims to show to the unspecialized reader that civilization is a unity of human enterprise where different parts work together, and that any war between the parts is in essence a civil war. In this setting, a book on art and civilization might be expected to aim at an account of the contributions and effectiveness of art in helping this human enterprise to progress and success. This theme is very new; the history of art has not been studied that way. So it is not surprising that a reader learns much less about the sociological functioning of art than he had hoped to. 1 Art and Civilization. Essays arranged and edited by P. S. Marvin and A. F. Clutton Brock. Oxford University Press. 1928. 673</page><page sequence="2">674 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY The word "art " is ambiguous. It may be used in a very wide or in a very narrow sense. The writers of Art and Civilization use it in the narrow sense of fine art and not all of that; architecture, sculpture, and painting are about all that is mentioned. Such topics as the Iliad-and the editors will not have forgotten Macail's phrase "When Homer came Hellas "-the Divine Comedy, the superb old choral compositions of the church, receive no attention. Poetry, as some one says in the volume, has been abundantly written up, and we are growing more and more accustomed to understanding it as one of the voices of its day. A few references are made to music, and there is a most amusing discussion of furniture and interior decoration of the nineteenth century. This is not said in reproach. The book is a series of lectures or talks and the whole subject is far too great to be even sketched in the time that was probably available. But I suspect the editors of the book did not grasp the real magnitude of the subject. Not all the lectures are included and some new matter has been added. But all the contributors have kept one point in mind and they estimate their success by the degree to which they have illustrated the point in question. "They are all convinced that art is an essential ex- pression of the spiritual activity of any civilized community and has intimate links with other sides of its activity." Accordingly a com- munity without art is hardly civilized, and the part played by art in the collective living, the ways it functions, the influence it exerts, has much to do with the kind of community it is. If this is true, and I agree that it is, in our study of the past, particularly at well-equipped universities, an acquaintance with and an appreciation of art, and of art as part of history, should find much more recognition than it does. With this I cordially agree; but I feel that Mr. Marvin touches upon something that he hardly penetrates, and that the reasons for his own position and effort are far more important and profound than he or any of the contributors suggest. This is a point, however, which I can not take up in an account of the work from which I have learned so much, and from which I would like to quote so many sentences and paragraphs-more than there is space for. It is, how- ever, a subject which seems to me of great importance and to which I will try to return later on. It is an inquiry to which the subject "art and civilization" inevitably leads, and the points I would call attention to seem to me all on the side of what the Unity History School hopes, in some measure, to accomplish. One of the factors today which makes it difficult for art to play the role it should is the great interest in science and technique. We are accustomed to say that science is power: may we also say that art is power? The writers do not put it just that way, but their guiding</page><page sequence="3">ART AND CULTURE 675 faith is that in a well-balanced civilization art is power not to be lost. And I do not mean the power to proclaim the importance of a person or of an institution; I have a vague notion of something far more elusive. Duccio, Cimabue, Giotto, Fra Angelico, Piero della Francesca, Mantegna, and their host of co-workers kept a world of myth and tradition concretely and full of color before the eyes and imagination of a mass of citizens, helping them greatly to have all together the same world of organized esthetic superstition become what we call art, and to be, as it were, citizens of that world of the collective imagination. From the mosaics at Ravenna to Michel- angelo, or nearly as long as that, to what extent and in what ways was art a power in its world of life and institutions ? It is not a student of the history of art, but a sociologist, that might answer that question. And I am inclined to say that without bearing this ques- tion constantly in mind we can not write the history of art at all. In the introduction, Mr. Marvin proceeds to sketch what is to follow with some analysis of its general purpose. The story itself is begun by Elliot Smith. In the chapter on the origin of art, Professor Smith discusses first the biological problem of how our ancestors acquired hands to form, and curiosity to handle and examine things around them. Thus they learned to care about form and to fashion materials. In his handling of the word "art" he quotes and follows Solomon Reinach, who distinguishes sharply between art and tools. Art is, says Monsieur Reinach, "the expression of a free and disinterested activity that aims not at satisfying an immediate necessity but at awakening a sentiment, a lively emotion-admiration, pleasure, curi- osity and sometimes terror" (page 20). On the whole, this is the right way to distinguish the instruments of esthetic value from those of practical value. And I think that using the word "art" in this sense there was no "art" at all, meaning conscious and intended art in the paleolithic time. Cave-paintings, though having a subtle beauty of the rarest sort, but set far back in the absolute darkness of caverns, except for fire-and often in places difficult to get at-must have been tools of imitative magic. It was a culture of hunters. Grotesque representations of "fat women" seem to have been the first efforts to reproduce the human form, the female form, so as to em- phasize and exaggerate all the visible signs of reproduction (page 39). There is no reason to suppose that interest in beauty or decora- tion had anything to do with these primitive figurines. The power they gave was all that counted. What we call jewelry was worn for its magic efficacy. Yes, no doubt. But neither is there any reason to suppose that the sense of beauty was not alive and stimulated whenever a medicine-</page><page sequence="4">676 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY craftsman designed or painted with what seems to us such rare and sensitive skill. And I think we have no right to assume that any but a very practised hand could have that skill; and that must have been the hand of the person whose special business it was to draw on the cave walls, sometimes on top of other drawings, the pictures of the kind of game they lived on, showing the animal sometimes penetrated by a weapon, or being attacked and killed. This remark is not an objection to Monsieur Reinach's point of view; it is only made to suggest that we must not take his statement too literally. For a work of art, especially in those centuries when, according to Mr. Marvin and his co-workers, art seemed more natural than it does to-day, was rarely so without the tool character, as the statement (Apollo, page 1) might lead some of us to believe. Every piece of architecture is an example; the bronze seated St. Peter of the Vatican is a tool in one respect and a work of art in another. In Egypt the making of mummies was to prolong the existence of the spirit; in time came life-size portrait-statues by the endurance of which life after death was indefinitely prolonged. Prehistoric art is described by Dina Partway Dobson. Her illus- trations are charming, and the story with which she begins is charm- ing too. It is taken from Spencer and Gillen and shows how far some of our ancestors may have been from the vegetarian faith. A group of damsels "went to the river to bathe, and turning upon one of their number, slew and devoured her. This act was performed from no mean motive of personal dislike or animosity, nor from carnal greed, but was due to the fact that she was possessed to no ordinary degree of the beauty of fatness, and this beauty her com- panions desired to incorporate in themselves, so that they too might abound. " The bronze age is best known through Homer. The early iron age was essentially a celtic world of longheaded Aryan people. In paleo- lithic times man was an individualist in his picture-magic. He did not, as a rule, portray groups. The single animal, the hunter's game, sufficed. In neolithic times husbandry and communal life left little time for artistry. What patterns there were, as on pottery, were for decoration alone. Accordingly the reader infers that the sense of beauty has been discovered and that respect is paid to it. "Art" has begun. Next comes "The Greek Revelation," a title which one illustra- tion seems to justify, a cheek piece thought to be from the helmet of Alcibiades. Mr. Holroyd has made an extremely interesting contribution. Very usefully for the outsider he sketches the progress in Greek archeology through the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. As Mr. Marvin puts it (page 14), in the eighteenth century "the greatest</page><page sequence="5">ART AND CULTURE 677 mass of works of ancient art which have ever been given back to the world were unearthed at Herculanaeum and Pompeii. Most of these -were discovered in the first half of the eighteenth century, while Winckelmann, who was to stir the modern world to a sympathetic interest, was still a young man." And turning to Mr. Holroyd: "The predecessors of scientific archeology, men like Winckelmann and Lessing, in the eighteenth century, had to formulate their criteria of Hellenic beauty from what we should now consider degraded works of a tasteless and decadent age-such as the Laocobn-or at best from indifferent copies of such statues, themselves comparatively late, as the Apollo Belvedere and the Apoxyomenus" (page 73). Between the culture from the Aegean and classical Greece was a gap in art respects of several centuries, and this was "not merely an empty void but a gap filled by an alien and intrusive geometric style of art. . . . 'In the escape from this geometric prison, which took place about 700 B.C., at the very period when Greek pirates, traders, and colonists were covering the waters of almost the entire Mediterranean, the artists of old Greece were preceded by those of the Ionian and other Greek settlements on the Asiatic coast of the Aegean." A little later Ionia was ahead, but not far ahead, of AEgina, Corinth, Sicyon, and the cities of Eubcea. "The sculptors, painters and potters of different cities competed for the local and ex- port markets, for Greece was already becoming what it remained till the later fifth century, the great manufacturing region of the Medi- terranean world. By the seventh century Greek wares were being bought eagerly everywhere from Spain and Etruria to the Crimaea" (page 77). Early in the fifth century began that competent idealization of the human form that is the great achievement of sculpture in Greece. Farnell in Greece and Babylon says that the perfect humanity of gods and goddesses made mysticism impossible. Thus were Apollo, Artemis, and Demeter and not otherwise-the noblest human speci- mens the imagination could conceive. Phidias and his contempo- raries combined and fused the accomplishments of earlier schools. "By doing this and, at the same time, increasing and deepening their predecessors' study of nature, they reached those truly sublime con- ceptions of godlike beauty which were to dominate all the future artistic achievement of antiquity'" (page 80). This sounds mid- Victorian but, after all, it is true. Very interesting is the sketch of conditions and circumstances favorable to the rise of Greek art. Until the invasion by Persia Greece was nevet seriously threatened by attack from without. "The Greeks of the Archaic period were known all over the eastern Mediterranean, and even in South Italy, Spain and Gaul, as pirates and adventurers bent on conquest and colonization as well as on</page><page sequence="6">678 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY commerce and plunder. For about six hundred years, in fact until the Roman conquest, the Greeks were by far the best soldiers and sailors round the Mediterranean. " And the city state was a forcing- ground of art as it was in northern Italy of the Renaissance. Poets and artists had a singularly beautiful mythology to use and illus- trate, which, of course, they helped create; athletic contests which, like tragedy at Athens, were parts of important social ceremony. But "the fine flower of art can only" bloom to perfection under the most favorable conditions, "and seldom wholly survives any great social convulsion." It is astonishing that the war with Sparta did not wreck Athens and the rest of Greece more than it did. The first period of high achievement was the time of Pericles; the second was that of Alexander, and Mr. Holroyd writes that Eng- lish historians, Grote above all, led by a great admiration for demo- cratic Athens, have clouded our appreciation of what was here pro- duced. Sir Walter Raleigh, however, in his History of the World, devoted three quarters of his account of Ancient Greece to the time of Alexander and of his successors. "Monarchy is less popular now than in that great Age of Princes, the Renaissance; but if we have gained much by the change we have lost something too" (page 98). Greece was fortunate in that her conquerors, first the Mace- donians and then the Romans, were deeply impressed by what they conquered, and did their best to preserve and extend it. And the old city autonomy lived on partly because after Alexander's death the rule was distributed between three or more independent and mutually hostile realms giving Greek diplomats the chance to play one adroitly against another. As a result Rome was able to pose naturally as the protector of the city-states. In architecture, the great impression is of perfect competence and power in the building of walls, aqueducts, and roads. Wherever we find it wall-building is the same, of gigantic solidity and strength, "quite unlike the delicate and scientific power of Greek wall-build- ing." In the history of the "Ancient World" this brings us to the year 276 A.D. From the time of the conquest of Gaul, the Roman world stood firm for three centuries. Along the Rhine, the Danube, and in dis- tant Armenia the armies held the frontiers. But in 276 the line was broken and "the whole complicated machinery of administration suddenly brought to an end." In the fourth century land was partly brought back to cultivation, towns rebulit on a much smaller and poorer scale. The old government was gone and the Christian Church, now the official religion, largely took its place. Another race with other ideas and habits seems to occupy the scene. It was a different state from that of Augustus and the Antonines. "From top to bottom it had been converted into a</page><page sequence="7">ART AND CULTURE 679 mediaeval caste-bound autocracy. The emperors from Diocletian down, were hedged about with that quasi-oriental state and almost superstitious awe that still casts its glamour, or did until the late war, about an emperor and his court" (page 117). But law sur- vived, and where the empire survived through the dark ages, (be- tween the fifth and the eleventh centuries) it maintained some order in a chaotic world. Art changed, of course, in proportion. "For a thousand years" painting and sculpture had taken truth to nature as an indispensable condition of high achievement. This "scientific " interest in the object represented is the characteristic trait of Greek workmanship. In the fourth century came what Mr. Holroyd calls the anarchic period (later Gallo-Roman art in the Treves Museum), hair as heaving surging clots, eyes hollowed deep into the head. But sane portraiture came back, good portraits of Constantine and his con- temporaries; and some reliefs of the earliest Byzantine period have a charm of their own. The Arch of Constantine, in architectural design the finest in Rome, was decorated by its builders with reliefs taken from earlier monuments. Along with this sudden collapse of sculpture we find the greatest capacity in structural architecture. "The Roman buildings of the age of Diocletian and Constantine are among the finest of all; and their style, though new in some ways is nevertheless in the clearest sense classical" (page 120). But how explain the collapse of sculpture? The explanation suggested is to me of particular interest because Male in his volume on French ecclesiastical art of the twelfth century points out that sculpture disappeared at about this time, and he believes that the earliest relief sculpture over old French church portals was copied from illustrated manuscripts. But why sculpture disappeared Male does not say. Mr. Holroyd suggests that "in the economic chaos which over- whelmed most parts of the civilized world at the end of the third century, the classes upon whose patronage the sculptors depended sank into poverty without leaving any nouveaix riche successors imbued with similar tastes. Certain it is that in Rome itself, the art of figure sculpture did actually die out at about this very period" (page 119). I deeply regret that Mr. Holroyd felt he could not include the coming of the great new non-classical style of Asiatic Greece, what we call Byzantine: nor the growth of basilica churches of the north and churches of Saracenic style in the east and south out of the architecture of the old Roman law-courts. Old Christian art, according to 1Ir. Strzygowski, who writes about it, owes a great deal to Asia, and the next chapter is on the art of Asia by Mr. Lawrenace Binyon; for a beginner in this field it is of great value.</page><page sequence="8">680 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY More and more the art of ancient Egypt reveals itself as some- thing of the rarest beauty and dignity. It is perhaps outside the line of influence and inheritance that our book deals with, and to include it would have required much space and a competence that but few possess. This remark is meant to bear upon Mr. Binyon's first sen- tence: "The art of Asia presents the only other body of mature art in the world which may be compared on equal terms with the art of Europe." He explains that one is justified in speaking of the vast continent as having something like a single art. "In this art at any rate India, Persia, China, Japan, and the other far eastern countries are united by currents of actual influence and there are certain features which the arts of all these lands have in common" (page 124). We soon discover how much of Indian inspiration lies behind the art of China. Mr. Binyon says many things of the sort I am looking for-about the collective mentality that finds expression in its art, and which, it seems to me, must grow more conscious of itself through the picturing of its own imaginative world of deities and powers. I must quote most of a paragraph. "But first let us recall a momentous event in human history which has left a deep impress on the life of both Europe and Asia-the conquest of Alexander. There have been few more significant moments than when the Greek con- queror, radiant in his youth, his beauty, and the splendour of his achievements, burst on that ancient, teeming, meditative world of India. The spirit of the West and the spirit of the East encountered each other for the first time. Alexander conquered; but his conquest was of materials only. The Indian mind refused to be impressed. The Olympic games, the Attic stage, were presented by the con- querors as a spectacle of the glory of Greece before this eastern world. The Brahmans were indifferent or disdainful. Why this exaltation of the human body, the irksome and transitory lodging of the spirit? or of human action and human passion, both equally dis- turbing to the ideal life of contemplation? Here already in an ex- treme form we meet with a contrast in the conception of life and the universe which we shall find again and again expressed in Asian art. To the west, man is the hero of existence, the centre of the universe, in him the divine is revealed; and in western art the nude human body is the supreme means of expression, the most significant of all symbols. In the East man is but one link in an infinite and contin- uous chain of existences; and in the most typical works of the mature art of Asia man is set against a vast background in which he takes his place but which he does not dominate" (page 125). Charac- teristic of Asia is the absence of that interest in accuracy of observa- tion which goes with what we call the scientific attitude. The monumental art of Assyria and ancient Persia does not come into the story. "Roughly we may take as our starting-point a date</page><page sequence="9">ART AND CULTURE 681 corresponding to the Christian era. What was the state of Asia in the first century A.D.? " "Just as the history of European art is bound up with the history of Christianity, so the history of Asian art, at least of the Farther East, is bound up with the history of Buddhism.... Buddhism died out of India, but it gave an enduring inspiration to the thought and the art of all the Farther East." But there is evidence "that in India as in China the art of paint- ing on the walls of palaces was practised at least some centuries B.C. There still exist in India, in Orissa, paintings on the walls of a cave which date from the second century B.C. "-and of which the tech- nique reminds us of the prehistoric paintings of Spain and south- western France. "The traditions of craftsmanship in the East are fixed and per- sistent. Everywhere in India, in Turkestan, in China, in Japan we find the same method of fresco-painting with a strong expressive outline and clear coloring. . . . It is from this primitive style, we may presume, that the various countries of Asia developed each a national style of art, always, however, retaining a common base of character." And, as the writer puts it; "art works from within" meaning, I suppose, that in earlier stages at least, the purpose is rather to present an established subject-matter than originality of technique. How long it took for this native style to become "mature" we do not know, but "in the greatest series of early Indian frescoes art has become mature." The frescoes range from the first to the seventh century A.D. "In a remote ravine among the mountains of Haiderabad a great scarp of precipitous rock sweeps in a horseshoe curve above a stream. It is a place of solitary and wild beauty." "All along the surface of the cliff, the rock has been hollowed out into what are often called eaves but are really spacious halls elaborately hewn in imitation of actual structure. There are twenty- nine of these, four being churches, the rest monastery dwellings. Many of them contain paintings." The paintings are all Buddhist in subject, and the most characteristic have to do with the lives of the Buddha in his previous incarnations. One story "is of the great white elephant, also an incarnation of the Buddha." The one just told about was a deer. The hunter in pursuit fell into a pit of water; the deer, in compassion, stopped and drew him out. But the elephant: "owing to a spite conceived in a former existence, a young queen desired to rob this king of elephants of his tusks, and sent a hunter to procure them. The hunter, after surmounting incredible obstacles, found his victim, but was unable to saw off the tusks himself. The elephant then took the</page><page sequence="10">682 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY saw in his trunk and cut them off himself, knowing well why and for whom the thing was done. " The queen died of remorse. "The group of the dying queen surrounded by her attendants is one of the most beautifully conceived in this whole series of frescoes, or indeed, in the whole of Indian art. We note too the masterly drawing of the elephant." The sentiment or doctrine here needs no analysis. "The secret of this art is a deep recognition of the spiritual element in man, con- ceived not as an essence to be cloistered and protected from the material world, but as something pervading and refining all the actions and events in which men and women take part, coloring with its own tinge even the unconscious life of nature" (page 132). To one interested in the continuity-and this is my own claim- that links together primitive mana and animism, magic, the waukanda of American Indians, Dionysus, Demeter, Jawe, the argu- ment from design, and much of recent and even some of contem- porary metaphysics, this way of describing a central feature of the art of India is significant. It may point to that diffusion through time of what we now call supernaturalism, which goes back to what we call the animism of certain stages of primitive culture, out of which the collective imagination of social groups wrought, without ever meaning, to, a world of deities and powers and institutions of a social and historical importance hardly to be exaggerated. And most of us, I fancy, were trained up in the apologeties of that tradi- tion and its institution. And if the spirit of Asia is something like what Mr. Binyon says it is, it is not surprising if the primitive con- sciousness of kind should have persisted there incorporated in art, institutions, and philosophy. Moving northward and eastward, and bringing with it a baggage of Indian imagery, Buddhism came to China. Apart from bronze vessels and incense burners little is left of Chinese art before this extraordinary diffusion of a faith. But the Chinese made Buddha a Chinaman. He and those with himn "were portrayed as Chinese not only in type and figure but in every detail of costume. " The Chinese write with a brush. Recently discovered letters of the first century A.D. show as much mastery of the brush as any later writing. Thus it happens that the Chinese regard painting as something akin to handwriting. "Instead of the impression of mass, proper to sculpture and its material, the fine writing line on the smooth silk is used to express human character with singular subtlety and intensity." "The great draughtsmen of Europe have, for the mlost part, been distinguished by their searching grasp of structure and their power of suggesting roundness and mass. They have seconded their powers by close studies of anatomy. The Chinese recall rather exceptional artists like Botticelli, with whom the love</page><page sequence="11">ART AND CULTURE 683 of sinuous rhythmical line is an inborn passion, and whose instinct for representing movement became at last a mannerism." "The conviction that life consists of change, that without change and with- out movement there is no life, this conviction seems to be ever pres- ent in Chinese art, underlying even its chosen patterns of deco- ration. " "But while the Indian spirit accepts the fact with resignation and pines always for a place of rest from the endless chain of ex- istence, the Chinese spirit seems rather to be exhilarated by the con- sciousness that every life is part of this streaming, ever-changing energy of the universe. " What interests me here is what Mr. Binyon, concentrated upon description in terms of esthetics, seems not to think of, though it would, I think, so well suit his purpose, part of which is to argue the independence of Asiatic art. But if this sense of continuity with nature, of participation everywhere in a common stream of living, is, as I suggest it is, a diffusion through time of animism, it was helped by what Mr. Binyon calls a philosophy of life. In the age of Sung (tenth to thirteenth centuries), from which Mr. Binyon takes his examples, Buddhism had blended with the doctrines of Lao-tzw, "the contemporary and rival of Confucius, to create a certain school or sect called the Sect of Contemplation. And the peculiar ideals of this sect inspired much of the art of the Sung era." The writer does not say whether or not the possession of art that was beautiful and symbolically expressive helped to make the "philosophy of life" seem natural and true, but that is just what I would like to ask. But he continues: " The more imaginative minds of China lived in reaction from the Confucian system with its ideals of social order and service. Their ideal was personal and intellectual free- dom. The sect of contemplation treated ceremony and ritual, sacred images and even sacred scriptures as valueless in themselves. On one side it resembles Puritanism but with nothing of Puritan morose- ness. On the contrary, the human spirit was to cultivate a blithe unworldliness, to ally itself with the freedom and fluidity of winds and streams and birds and flowers. . . . A bird oln a bough, a spray of flowering plum, or bamboo trembling in the wind, could be as significant to the spirit as the forms of deity or angel" (page 139). Wherever the supernatural was born it had long been growing at- tenuated and less and less important. It is hard to me to understand how anyone living in the modern culture of the modern world should not easily, inevitably outgrow that tradition. Yet the world around us is full today of apologetics that have the marks of superstition. Whether it is a good thing for a particular people at a particular time to outgrow a particular superstition is another question. MIr. Binyon writes: "It was with a devastating sense of disillusion that science at last in the nineteenth century brought home to man his true place in</page><page sequence="12">684 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY the universe. There is an impressive prose-poem of Turgenev's in which Man confronts in some central cave of earth the brooding spirit of Nature. He sees the preoccupation of her brow and asks eagerly and confidently what new triumphs, what new glory, she is preparing for his destiny. She interrupts her thoughts to answer him. She is not thinking of him at all. Some little equilibrium in her vast economy has been disturbed; she is seeking for a device to strengthen the muscles on the thighs of the flea. To this shock of humiliation Chinese thought as expressed in art is a stranger" (page 139). And this brings us to old Christian art, a chapter in which Mr. Strzygowski makes out an excellent and very interesting case for indebtedness to Asia. There was in the fourth century A.D. a pilgrim's itinerary to Jerusalem for the whole Roman Empire. "It gives us the first direct evidence that (for the Christian imagination at least) Jerusalem was the centre of the Roman sphere. As early as the fourth century Jerusalem takes for Christians the place of the old 'caput mundi,' Rome. Just as the aim of every Moslem's life to-day is to reach Mecca, so Christians from the time of Constantine until the end of the Crusades were drawn by a similar yearning toward Jerusalem. It thus becomes a new capital beside Rome and Byzantium, a focus for the Christian world. It superseded Alexandria and Antioch as a centre of art, and led its pilgrims through countries in which art was more dependent on the Hellenistic-Persian culture in the East than that of the Mediterranean" (page 152). It is probably difficult for us to understand what it meant in those days for a religion to be adopted as a state religion. But there had been transition, especially in the East; and "there must also have been artistic works in Alexandria and Antioch, and in those political organizations such as Osrene and Armenia, which had embraced Christianity as their state-religion before the time of Constantine." Ecclesiastical architecture shows variety and independence. "The types are so various and the individual characteristics so numerous that we cannot but suppose that a vigorous, innovating and creative force was already at work by the time of Constantine quite opposite to the uniformity of the ecclesiastical architecture of Rome." The most ancient types of the representation of Christ bear out the same contention. The Roman-Hellenistic type "is of a beautiful youth with curling locks; the Aramaean a bearded man with smooth parted hair. The difference between Greek and Oriental taste is also evident in the attention paid by the Greeks to the human form and the greater prominence given by the Easterns to ornament." The final result is a combination. The human figure of the Greeks moved farther and farther east, and the eastern taste for ornament</page><page sequence="13">ART AND CULTURE 685 came west. And "we cannot to-day imagine Christ other than as a bearded man" (page 154). It was between the fourth and the sixth centuries that "artistic types were crystallized into forms which held good during the thou- sand years that followed. . . . This is the period when Jerusalem and Nisbis became the Christian centres, and Constantinople arose as a new metropolis beside the old ones. These three cities were at that time the poles of the eastern world, which stood firm amid the flood of peaceful commerce and monastic development on the one hand, and the threatening waves of the migration of eastern peoples westward on the other. . . . One thing is clear; the peculiar features of oriental decorative art extended then over a vastly larger area than in the Roman period." "In the singular decoration of Byzantine capitals and silks we find elements from a pre-Christian religion of the East, the Iranian Mazdaism which once in the form of Mithraism overspread the Roman world. From this source comes what is called the Hoarenah motif, the Glory and Majesty of God. This was the best possession of the home, averting evil, giving increase of prosperity. It appears sometimes as a bird in flight, sometimes as a swiming or diving crea- ture, sometimes in other animal forms like the goat or the ram. Plants and animals, on palace fagades, as at Mschatta, or on cos- tumes are symbols of Hoarenah to protect the inhabitants or the wearer. " With the decline of decorative sepulchres, and the advance of monumental church architecture of pictorial style, the didactic and historical methods of the East took the place of the older symbolism. An example is the Christ in the mosaic of the Good Shepherd in the Mausoleum of Galla Placidia at Ravenna. It is a typical landscape, a geometrical one with Biblical scenes and figures. But "this type of landscape we know from all parts round Iran in China, as well as in India and the West. It is the old Mazdean Hoarenah landscape, composed from nature, but symboliz- ing God's power that makes the running water gush from springs, plants sprout from the soil, winds blow the clouds, and men come to birth. Hoarenah governs the courses of sun, moon, and stars, it permeates the whole country-side and particularly the land of Seistan through which the river Helmand flows (pages 158, 159). In early Christian architecture Mr. Strzygowski considers only the barrel-vaulted romanesque, and this barrel-vaulting came from the east. He cites what seems abundant evidence. "The offshoots of the eastern monastic orders, the Gothic migration, commerce, and the constant pilgrimages to Jerusalem continued the fusion of Celtic and Hellenistic culture " (page 161). Mr. Strzygowski continues with the chapter on medieval art. His way of approach is very interesting.</page><page sequence="14">686 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Medieval art is, he says, "rather a complex of essential traits than merely the art of a certain period of time." Viewed historically, he holds that it "appeared in European history as a development of the art of ancient Northern Europe and Asia between A.D. 400 and 1400. . . . Its most essential characteristic is that Mediaeval art knows no naturalistic foundation, and unilike the art of our own time can be understood only as a building or as the decoration of a build- ing. It has as its centre some architectural symbol, not a stone statue symbolizing a god, not a picture painted on a table" (page 163). "It is not yet a hundred years since people began to speak of Mediaeval art. " Yet in spite of the Renaissance, the school of Palladio never destroyed the link in England, and it goes back be- yond the Norman conquest. It is in fact the development of the old art of the North after the decline of romanesque, and its true home is northern France, Germany, and England. Mr. Strzygowski has in mind primarily the gothic of the twelfth and thirteenth cen- turies; and he thinks of it as a system and style that grew out of timber-construction. This is why its birthplace was in the north. "If one looks round Europe from Vienna westward and from Rome and Milan northward to Upsala and Trondhjem in Scandinavia, one has the impression of an enormous independent northern move- ment which first represents a purely Western European unity in art, while the romanesque style is rather imported into Europe from the Asiatic East as we saw in the last chapter " (page 164). What he calls his thesis is stated at the beginning of the section on old Chris- tian art: "We have rather to think of antiquity and the middle ages in the realm of art as two parallel streams, the antique arising as the last stage of the paleolithic South, and the mediaeval as coming much later and being the consummation of the neolithic North." I cite these lines more because they are in the text and for their picturesque suggestiveness than because I have much confidence in what they say. Aside from the argument that Gothic architecture is the transla- tion of timber into stone-some of early Greek architecture was that too-interesting things are said. "In the romanesque style and period the monks counted for most; in the gothic the cities. The former wished to teach and used pictorial arts for those who could not read. The latter embodied the abundance of handicraft in the cathedral which represented the whole commulnity " (page 172). "The [earlier] movement from thc South to the North is a mission- ary onie, not only in relig,ion, but also in all humanistic wisdom. But in the formation of the gothic style the North was the decisive factor and when it was established in its northern home it made its way to Italy also. " And that, I suppose, is true. The reader sees and regrets that these two chapters on medieval</page><page sequence="15">ART AND CULTURE 687 art are devoted largely to the discussion of historic origins. That, lhowever, is not the way to become acquainted with what it was on the soil that took it over, and what were its social values and results for the people that set it up and used it. But this is a question not for an archeologist or an esthetician. We reach the Renaissance and the whole scene changes. From Dante to Michelangelo is a long step. And I am thinking chiefly of the worlds they lived in. Mr. Glueek, who writes this chapter, is chiefly concerned to show that the period called the Renaissance might better be called by some other name so far as art is concerned. "Vasari, who wrote long after the beginning of the period which bears the name, was the first to use it. From him the word 'rinacit'a' passed into French and all other European languages, and, with the point of view which it denotes, has held sway down to our own time" (page 174). I must quote the last paragraph: "To sum up briefly, the Renaissance in art was not a movement which arose only in Italy and from classical sources. The classical element is due to Italy where it had never vanished. What was new about it in Italy at that time was the con- scious reintroduction of classical elements, stimulated by the hu- manist spirit in literature. The vital movements took place in the North, in France and Germany, and in the East, in Byzantium, and Islam. Through these new developments which converged on Italy, she obtained her high rank in art at that time, for she was a natural link between the Western and Eastern Evolutions." The next chapter, however, "Italian Art of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries,'" by Mrs. Arthur Strong, contains much that is to the point. "Art, " Mrs. Strong says, and she should say instead "much art," "is the expressioni of ideas, and can only be explained in relation to the current of religious and speculative thought which inspired it." Nowhere is this acquaintance with the artist 's real subject-matter "more necessary than in the period of Italian art be- tween Michelangelo's ceiling frescoes in the Sistine Chapel and the death of Bernini in 1680. It was a period rich in new spiritual ex- perience; it was also the last time in European history that art appears as an essential ally of the Church, and the faithful inter- preter of religious thought" (page 183). Although early Christian art owed so much detail and style to Asia, the temperamental mentality of Asia and Europe were, as Mr. Binyon explained, very different. As Mrs. Strong puts it: "Where Eastern art has been mainly inspired by a religion of immanence and passivity, the art of the West tended from the first toward the ex- altation of humanity. Greek anthropomorphism, by giving a human form to the gods, had allowed man to reign supreme over Greek art. " And Roman art was a more realistically human handling of physical</page><page sequence="16">688 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY humanity. And, of course, Christian art grew up in Western Europe out of a culture enriched by an enormous diffusion of ancient habits and traditions. As Mr. Glueek affirmed in the previous chapter, the classical element (of the Renaissance) is due to Italy, where it had never vanished. But for a time the Judaic prohibition of graven images was fatal to sculpture. "It accounts for the almost total disappearance of sculpture in the old Pagan centres during the first centuries of the Christian era" (page 184). This should be remembered in connection with the explanation suggested by Mr. Holroyd (page 119). Sculpture was perhaps, as Mrs. Strong holds, dangerously associated with the pagan gods; but, though she does not say so, picture-mosaic became early a sanctified style and this may have had much to do with the great use of fresco and other painting. And Mrs. Strong does state that "painting, recognized as materially incorporeal, found favor in their eyes on account of what we may call its more mystical quality" (page 184). This is, of course, the theory of Hegel. The ideal of asceticism, too, was an obstacle to the spirit of humanism. It was in the sixteenth century that painting made what many pious medievalists might call its great renunciation, when it no longer sought its subject-matter naively in Christian mythology, meta- physics, and institutions, and consequently ceased to function so- cially, as it had previously done, by becoming a work of art in the modern esthetic sense. We may insist that the work of Giotto is far more beautiful than the exquisite work of Tiepolo. My point is that they belong to different worlds and ought not to be compared. The doctrine of the Eucharist is of central importance in the history of the Christian imagination and of the crisis or episode that we call the Reformation. The shifting from Giotto to Paolo Veronese was through a period of dramatic change. The attitude in art was "tempered to an individual consciousness which toward the close of the Quatrocento was becoming pronounced in artists of the type of Signorelli and Piero della Francesca." The preaching and burn- ing of Savonarola are of this time. Julius II aimed to "restore the earthly prestige of the church," and he recognized in Michelangelo "the man who was likeliest to make manifest the new intellectual and spiritual needs which, how- ever mutely as yet, were stirring in the church." The story of the creation in the Sistine Chapel was executed between 1508 and 1512, and here Michelangelo "appears not merely as a great decorator but as expressing the ideas which were at the very root of contemporary thought" (page 187). And Mrs. Strong continues: "Twenty-three years after the ceiling, when the world was shaken by deepening troubles and the church had seen one part of Europe withdraw from its spiritual empire, Michelangelo was again summoned, this time by Clement VII, to formulate a second version of universal order.</page><page sequence="17">ART AND CULTURE 689 "And as already upon the Sistine vault, so in his Last Judgment he exploits the human form, but advances beyond his first conception in availing himself of all the terrific splendor of the nude, and in so doing far outstrips even the audacious inventions of Signorelli in the Capella Nuova at Orvieto. To his mind the nude alone could express a sublime catastrophe on a cosmic scale. . . Besides the Virgin, who appears clad in her traditional blue, there is only one clothed figure in the whole composition. This is the cowled friar Savanarola seen on the left, as he rises from the grave to witness the fulfillment of his prophecies." Meanwhile Raphael was painting, also for Julius II, the fresco that is called the Disputa del Sacramento, far less dramatic than the Last Judgment but more philosophical, and showing, in its way, "the eternal mission of the church symbolized in the central dogma of the Catholic faith and resting upon the three legacies of antiquity: jurisprudence, philosophy, and poetry." And now we are at the end of that chapter of the history of paint- ing and sculpture with which I am myself concerned. "At the close of the sixteenth century a reaction took place. It amounted to a reversal of the functions of painting and sculpture as the result apparently of the liturgical regulations of the Council of Trent." In his chapter on the art of the Renaissance, Mr. Glueek, begin- ning with the fourteenth century, writes: "Let us now turn and con- sider the art itself in its elements. What were its subjects? The most frequent were Christian ideas, the holy persons of the Gospels, and the legends of the saints." And Mr. Glueek has painting chiefly in mind. But after Michelangelo, through the dominance of the Counter- Reformation, sculpture became the more distinguished handmaid of the church. The exquisite tombs belong here. But painters found other things to think about and other people to work for. The liter- ary renaissance revealed other scenes and other divine personalities. Raphael's exquisite little painting in the Louvre, Apollo and Marsyas, is an illustration, and Titian painted visions drawn from Greek mythology. Or if they repeated the old Christian subjects, it was in a new spirit-the decoration of a dome or ceiling by Tiepolo -another world and atmosphere from the frescoes at Padua and Assisi. This movement was focussed, we are told, in the work of Bernini (1599-1680) about whom taste seems to have largely changed. "Bernini, like Michelangelo, was a born sculptor, but more fortunate than his predecessor he was able to use the medium that best suited his genius right through his long life." "He is the leader and chief figure of the movement still labeled as Baroqute, which, whatever the precise original meaning of the</page><page sequence="18">690 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY word, suggests something eccentric and bizarre, the fruit not of tra- dition but of reaction "-reaction, i.e., against a long-established and authoritative tradition, fortified at the end by a reactionary church council. The Baroque "burst like a rocket all over the civilized world; it affected every Latinized country of Europe from Poland to Por- tugal, and outside Europe made itself felt even in far-off Mexico, while the art of Protestant countries-and no less so that of Eng- land-surrendered to its spell. Wherever it penetrated we find that same passionate respect for the human form and all that this can give to architecture and design, that same conviction that everything based on this form has a greater nobility than that which is not" (page 199). But the great master of this was Michel- angelo. It was a return to classical objectivity. What had hap- pened in Greece was happening in Italy. The craftsman serving a faith is transformed into the artist. With the eighteenth century we are yet farther away from the world of earnest or living Christian doctrine, from the animistic inheritance, from primitive culture. It seems hard to believe that Tintoretto, "the last of Italy 's great religious painters," lived until 1594. About this period Mr. Clutton-Brock has written a very interesting chapter, though it is far from being anything like a general account of those two centuries such as would be found in any history of art. The Seicento is rather a province of Mr. Fry, and he has dealt with it in Transformations. Mr. Clutton-Brock will comment only "on a few of the greatest artists of the time, the Baroque painters-Rubens, El Greco, and Rembrant, and a few others, such as Poussin and Velasquez." The spirit of these men was not that of Giotto and of the early Sienese. There is not now a continuance or development of High Renaissance, but "a complete change of point of view. There is a new visual realism, there is the discovery of the third dimension which was the peculiar contribution of Italian art; the "conceptual idea" gives way "to the purely visual, for in the Seicento, painters came to rely more and more upon the evidence of their eyes alone." Very interesting is the analysis of Baroque. Its chief character- istic is the attempt at complete unity of design. It was felt that a facade composed of three distinct stories, three rows of windows, was broken iip into three different strips. A mass of ornament was used to overcome this visual division into stones and to unify all of them into one more unified composition. " So also were Baroque pictures conceived as a complete unit, the design being meant to strike the eye from the very first with a rapidity which was not hitherto attempted." Such pictures "must be observed at one rapid coup d'oeit; there is no dwelliing upon parts of the</page><page sequence="19">ART AND CULTURE 691 whole possible, and there is no resting-place for the eye, which must take in everything or nothing" (page 208). The most un- compromising Baroque painter is perhaps El Greco. In contrast to this is the "classical kind of design," where we find "figures posed, each in itself elegant, connected in a slow rhythm, and per- haps set in space with a fair amount of empty space about, as in Raphael's Marriage of the Virgin" (page 207). Poussin, a great painter, well versed in the Baroque manner "returned deliberately to the slower harmonies of Classical or Renaissance art." Des- cartes, with his insistence on order and clarity, seems to have been an influence here. About the eighteenth century surprisingly little is said. In architecture "correctness" was a general aim. The style of Pal- ladio was an influence comparable, the writer says, to the style of Poussin in painting. The eighteenth century broke away from "the central tradition of European painting" so long controlled by the Italians-a study and handling of "complex formal qualities." Sensibility counted for much. Chapter XII, "The Nineteenth Century," also by Mr. Clutton- Brock, is most entertaining. "I propose first to consider the causes of the ugliness of the minor useful arts-furniture, ornaments, the inside decoration of houses, and the like. The ugliness of these is probably the first stone that anyone will throw at the nineteenth century. " So much was relegated to machinery that the habit of careful handwork largely disappeared. The ambition of one class to imi- tate the class next above it in the social scale (the spirit of empir- ical democracy) to a great extent killed the interest in beauty. What might be works of art are symbols of social quality. Or it was so in the days of George Eliot. Today it is not much better. Buyers are not so anxious to proclaim their social rank, but they wish to "show their good taste "-a self-advertising comparable to the other. But where the socially higher class "acquires its taste is a difficult question, but it may be conjectured that it comes directly or indirectly from artists and authors. Thus Wilde and Whistler were responsible in part for the fashion for old furniture, for Eastern blue china, and Japanese prints." There are excellent remarks about "romantic emotion," the pre-Raphaelites, Whistler, Pater, and Wilde. Perhaps the greatest artist of modern times is Cezanne. It is interesting that Cezanne and most of the artists of the very recent movement " in no way took any real part in the life of their times, that they were often isolated from everything that was going on around them to a degree that would have seemed fantastic to any artist of the Renaissance" (page 246). It might have been psychologically impossible at the</page><page sequence="20">692 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY time of Giotto and Cimabue when the world of a social imagination was to such an extent a world of Christian doctrine, and the artist depended for his subject-matter almost wholly upon that world of functioning dreams. About the final chapter, "Art in a Modern Democracy," I have said what there is space for. It is to this chapter, I fancy, that all the rest of the book leads up. The presence of beauty in the culture of a century is a very important quality of it. Some cen- turies have been more richly endowed with it than others. What can be done to bring back into modern living, particularly in Eng- land, an interest in the beauty of buildings, of streets, of interiors and, so far as possible, of all the instruments of normal life? But this theme calls for a considerable essay. The bibliography at the end of each chapter is short and ad- mirable. There is no index. WENDELL T. BUSH. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY.</page></plain_text>
