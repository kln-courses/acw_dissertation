<plain_text><page sequence="1">THOUGHTS ON SUNDAY ?AMONN GAYNOR PENTECOST The feature of the second Vatican council most remarked upon by journalists in Rome last year was the diversity of languages spoken by the assembled Fathers. And this reminds us at once of the first Pentecost, when the visitors of all nations in Jerusalem at the time marvelled at hearing the apostles preach to them each in his own tongue. The apostolic gift of languages was miraculous however, part of the Holy Spirit's endowment of the Church, while the present-day gift must be acquired by human effort. Does this argue for a dim inution of the power of the Holy Spirit in the Church and more reliance on human effort? In the life of the Church what are the respective roles of the Holy Spirit and of man ? The Holy Spirit is always with the Church and will even work miracles where this is necessary to supplement human effort, as He did for the unlettered apostles and has done in every age since then. Normally, however, he does not work independently of human effort but through it, the effectiveness of His power depending on the quality of the effort, just as the effectiveness of electric power depends on its conductor. Thus, while He gave the unlettered apostles the gift of languages, which they could not have acquired for themselves, He did not spare them the necessity of preaching, of travelling far and enduring great hardships, of doing all those things necessary for getting a great movement under way : if they had laboured less or to less good purpose, the growth of the infant Church would have been correspondingly less. Human effort is the conductor of the power of the Holy Spirit and the life of the Church in any particular age depends on the quality of the effort. When we pray for the success of the Second Vatican Council we do not pray for an increase of the power of the Holy Spirit, for there was but one Pentecost, when a vast reservoir of power was made available to the Church, more than enough to meet its needs in all ages. We pray rather for human effort that will match that-of the apostles: and for the kind of legislation that will make such effort possible.</page><page sequence="2">THOUGHTS ON SUNDAY 383 TRINITY SUNDAY When Colonel Glenn returned from his much-publicised jaunt round the earth last year he spoke of his achievement with startling modesty: imagining the earth on the scale of the average school globe, he had risen above it to a height of about one inch! Ironically, the more we discover about the universe in which we live, the more we find there is left to discover. With a bit of luck we will have reached our nearest neighbour, the moon, within the decade and other planets before the turn of the century. But even if we are thus far successful, we know there are other planets still within our system so remote that we could be launched towards them as babies and, at present speeds, we would have died of extreme old age before we could reach them. And outside our system there are other systems that the mind can barely imagine. . . . If each new discovery in space leads us to realise how little we really know, it should also give new meaning to the exclamation of the apostle: "How deep is the mine of God's wisdom, how in scrutable are his judgments, how undiscoverable are his ways!" (Rom. 2:33-36). But does it? A less sophisticated age identified God with the sun and they had a glimpse of the truth in so far as they realised the immense life-giving power of God. More recently, men have identified Him with the stream of universal consciousness into which we, specks of consciousness, will be absorbed when we die and here again they have a germ of truth. Men tend to look upon God today as the master-scientist, who holds the key to the solution of all the complex problems that each new discovery brings us. Never before has human knowledge enabled us to realise so clearly the infinite power of God. And yet, while each new discovery in space brings home to us our own inadequacy, as far as God is concerned, do we not tend to regard ourselves more and more as self-sufficient and less and less dependent on Him? And while we hang on the words of every astronaut who brings back a tittle of information from outer space, do we not ignore the one authentic picture we have of God, given us by Christ Himself, of a Father Who cares for even the most prodigal of His children, of a Brother Who laid down His life for us, of a Lover Who longs for our love and seeks to love us in return. "God is love; he who dwells in love dwells in God and God in him" (1 John 4:16).</page><page sequence="3">384 THE FURROW CORPUS CHRISTI The supper at Emmaus was the first Sunday Mass in history. Present were the two disciples who on that Easter Sunday morning had set out from Jerusalem downhearted at the death of their master and confused and even frightened at reports that His tomb was now empty and that He had risen from the dead. And then there was the Stranger who had fallen-in with them and who had so enthralled them by His company and conversation that they pressed him to stay with them for supper. That supper was a heartburning experience for the disciples as they confided their doubts and fears to the Stranger and were comforted and enlightened by His exposition of the Scriptures. As any supper should be, it was a true communion of souls. And when it was over, the stranger took bread and blessed and broke and gave to them and immediately He was gone and they recognised Him as the Lord. How does our Sunday Mass compare with Emmaus? We have the same blessing and breaking and giving of bread. Have we the communion of souls? Are our people drawn to Mass as the disciples were drawn to supper with the stranger, or are they but half-willing guests who are present because it is their duty? And if they are not drawn is it not because they have no active part to play in the Mass ? Is not the average Mass as dull and unattractive to them as the supper filled with bored and uncommunicative guests? How different Emmaus would have been without the communion of souls! It is our duty as priests to draw our people into full and active participation in the Mass, into true, corporate communion of souls. And then and only then will the Mass become for the whole con gregation, for ourselves and for our people, the same heartburning experience it was for the two disciples in Emmaus. SECOND SUNDAY AFTER PENTECOST Holiness is living our lives in harmony with God and the first step to such harmony is devotion to our daily work. All of us, no matter what our vocations, have talents given us by God in the first place and provided we devote ourselves to our work, using those talents well and in the manner God intended, we are in close harmony with God. If we neglect our work, failing to use our talents or using them in opposition to God, we can never be</page><page sequence="4">THOUGHTS ON" SUNDAY 385 holy. First step to holiness is devotion to daily work; without it, no further step is possible. Christ warns us,'however, that there are further steps not to be neglected by pre-occupation with the first. And in particular we must commune with God in prayer to prepare ourselves more fully for that final communion in heaven for which even our work is a preparation. He condemns those men who excused themselves from the lord's supper because of their business, one to look after a new farm, another some new oxen, a third a new wife. If necessary we must drop some work to make time for communion with God. No amount of work excuses us from prayer. Christ did not say, however, that prayer excuses us from work: if we neglect our work no amount of prayer can make us holy. He did not abolish the first step to holiness. He simply warned us against pro-occupation with it to the exclusion of the others. THIRD SUNDAY AFTER PENTECOST Anthropomorphism is a theological term for equating God with a human being, in particular attributing to Him those limitations that are peculiar to ourselves. An example is placing God's forgiveness on a par with our own. I once asked a man to return to Mass after he had been away for a long time. His answer, quite sincere, was most revealing: "If I came back after all those years, Father, the church would fall down!" And I'm sure he had good reason for feeling that way. He was ashamed of approaching God, as he would be of approaching a fellow-human whom he had seriously wronged. There was a barrier of shame between him and God, God has removed that barrier however. Christ tells us that instead of remaining aloof, waiting for the sinner to crawl back in shame as an offended human might do, He seeks him out with His forgiveness, as the shepherd seeks the lost sheep. And having found him, instead of making sure he is thoroughly ashamed of himself before forgiving him, He simply takes him on His shoulder rejoicing. God, unlike most humans, has removed the barrier of shame. Shame is a good thing. It should never come between us and God, however, no matter what we have done. The prodigal son was ashamed to beg for a living: he was not ashamed to return to his father.</page><page sequence="5">386 THE FURROW FOURTH SUNDAY AFTER PENTECOST How satisfied the apostles must have been, returning home with ships laden with fish and how they must have looked forward to being fishers of men, anticipating the same spectacular results. "And having brought their ships to land, leaving all things, they followed him". It is easy being a fisherman when catches are good. And it is easy being a priest when there are visible results. How satisfying the life of the priest, whose every minute is taken up with helping the unfortunate, converting sinners, attending the sick, instructing those in need of instruction, preaching. He docs wonderful work and, of course, we all admire him. Let us spare a thought, however, for his less fortunate brother who seldom sees any results from his labours, who is never called upon to do anything spectacular, who keeps plodding along in spite of disappointment after disappointment. He needs greater dedication to his vocation. His great glory is that in spite of the lack of human incentives he makes himself available to Christ. ?AMONN GAYNOR Kilmaley, County Clare</page></plain_text>
