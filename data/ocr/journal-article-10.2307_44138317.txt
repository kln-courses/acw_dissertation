<plain_text><page sequence="1">A NOTE ON THE PROTOHISTORIC BURIAL URNS D. K. Chakravarty ( Calcutta ) In the funeral hymns of the Kigveda (X, 15-18) and specially in a single funeral hymn (X, 18) burial of uncremated body seems to have been mentioned. R. P. Chanda1 after quoting the Âêvalãvana-grihya sūtra (4, 5, 7- 10) 2 is of opinion that the hymns mentioned above refer " not to the burial of the uncremated body, but to the burial in a cinerary urn of the bone relics of a body that has already been cremated." It has been pointed out by the present contributor3 after adducing the evidences adumbrated in the Vedic literature that the views expressed by Chanda seem to be untenable. In the present context we are concerned with the ceremony of burying the bones as described by Âhalãyana (4, 5) : - 1. The gathering (of the bones is performed) after the tenth (Tithi from the death), (on a Tithi) with an odd number, of the dark fort- night, under a single Nakshatra. 2. A man into a male urn without special marks, a women into a female one without special marks. 5. With the thumb and the fourth finger they should put each single bone (into the urn) without making noiseś</page><page sequence="2">ANCIENT INDIA 41 6. The feet first, the head last. 7. Having well gathered them and purified them with a winnowing basket, they should put (the urn) into a pit with the verse, 'Go to thy mother earth' (Rigveda 10, 18, 10). 8. With the following (verse) he should throw earth (into the pit). 10. Having covered (the urn) with a lid with (the verse), ťI fasten to thee' (Rigveda 10, 18, 13), they then should go away without looking back, should bathe in water, and perform a Šrāddha for the deceased." The terms Kumbha (male urn) and Kumbhī (female urn) are worth noting; which however has been interpreted and explained by the commentator Nârâyana as stanarahita (male urn without female breasts) and stanavatī (female urn with female breasts). Rajendra Lai Mitra however understands that the 'female urn' refers to an 'urn with spout' and the 'male urn' an 'urn without spout'.-4 In the Kaūsikasūtra 5, 86 (8 &amp; 10) a manual connected with the Atharvaveda the ceremony of the interment of the bones has been described which however prescribes that the bone relics should be gathered on the third day after cremation (82, 25-26). The fragments are then deposited in a jar ( Kalaśa ) which is buried under a tree (82, 31-32). Subsequently the bones are taken out of the Kalafa and re-deposited in a pit where these are arranged in the form of a human skeleton (85, 19-25) in accordance with the instructions specified in the Atharvaveda (18, 4, 52), "collect thy body according to its joints; I arrange thy members with brahman" .6 The Śatapatha brahmano1 also refers to some interesting burial practices. Here (13, 8, 2, 1) it is stated that "that gods drove out the Asuras, their rival and enemies, from this world; whence those who are godly people make their sepulchres so as not to be separate (from the earth), whilst those (people) who are of the Asura nature, the Easterners and others, (make their sepulchral mounds) so as to be separated (from the earth), either on a basin or on some such thing." As regards the shape of the burial mound the Śatapatha Brãhmana (13, 8, 1, 5) further adds "the people who are godly make their burial places four cornered, whilst those who are of the Asura nature, the Easterners and others, (make them) round, for they (the gods) drove them out form the regions." The custom of burying the dead and specially of the children in an embryonic position with in the belly shaped urns or the urns resembling very much the abdomen of a preg- nant female as observed in such sites at Harappa Cemetery H Area (Late Period), Pandu Rajar Dhibi, Nagarjunakonda, Brahmagiri, Tekkalakota, Hallur, Nevasa, Chandoli, Tekwada, Daimabad was perhaps practised for the purpose of faci- litating the rebirth of the child and symbolically affording the re-entry" into the maternal womb, the idea of which possibly germinated during Neolithic times and was associated with the fertilising aspect of the Mother Earth. The present contributor has demonstrated8 from the evidences gathered from the 6</page><page sequence="3">42 INDIAN HISTORY CONGRESS 1969 literary sources as well as from the existing archaeological records that the practices of complete or fractional burials of uncremated bones in urns seems to be the traditional practice of burials existing among the autochthonous population of India and more specially of the people inhabiting the Eastern region of India. The funeral rituals as followed by the followers of the Krishna Yajurveda school are described in the Pitrimedhasūtras of Baudhâyâna, Hiranya- keśin and others. These texts prescribe different modes of disposal of the bone relics of different classes of men. Thus Hiranyakeśin writes (13) : tc athaikesham Kumbhãntam nidhãnamanãhitagneh štrivāšcha " (Then among indi- viduals burial in the urn is provided for one who has not established sacred fires and for woman"). In the Vitrimedhasūtra of Gautama associated with the Samarediv school, the interment of the jar containing bone relics at the root of a tree is prescribed (1, 5, 34) and it has been added that " Yãvadasthi Kiñchiddhriyate tãvat svarge loke mahīvate (As long as there remain traces of the bone relics (in the jar) the deceased enjoys heaven"). Mention has been made about the interpretation of the terms ' Kumbha (Male Urn) and Kumbhī (female urn) by the commentator Nãrãyana and scholars like R. L. Mitra. Let us observe and find from the reports furnished by the archaeo- logists in their respective excavation reports whether any burial or burials have been found associated with urns having the shape of female breasts ( stanavat! ) or spouted pots. In one of the big pots illustrated by Allchin in his "Piklihal Excavations report (PL 27, Fig. 376) there are two small bosses of applique clay in addition to a finger tip decoration. A similar decoration has been observed on two large urns containing the disarticulated bones of an adult at Tekkalakota. Drs. Kennedy and Malhotra who have studied the skeletal remains from Tekkalakota have suggested "that the clay protuberance are symbolic representations of female breasts". In this context it is interest- ing to note that jars reminiscent of types from Brahmagiri with their incised oblique and criss-cross lines and chain pattern occur also at Bahal with applique work, finger-tip decoration and female figurines, which can be seemingly associated with the burials noticed at Brahmagiri and Tekwada (opposite Bahal). Spouted pots with its variants lipped bowl or channel spouted bowls have been found associated with the burials at such sites e.g. Nagarjunakonda,10 Brahmagiri,10 Piklihal,10. T. Narasipur,10 Tekkalakota,10 Daimabad,11 among others. At Piklihal the burial of an adult female includes a spouted pot and a deep (?) milking vessel12 as funerary articles which strikingly corroborates the burial rites adumbrated in the Āšvalājana grihjasūtra as discussed above. Incidentally it may be mentioned that channel spouted bowls of different shapeą having the cutaway splayed spouts of different shapes have been found at Pandu Rajar Dhibi in different levels in profuse numbers. Of course these were not found directly associated with any of the burials disinterred there.</page><page sequence="4">ANCIENT INDIA 43 It may not be improbable that these types of bowls have also been menti- oned as c utsopamam kalasarrì (a jar resembling a fountain) in the Atharvaveda with which funeral oblations were poured in the mouth of the dead or his osseons remains. Outside India the burial of the dead in a jar originated in pre-Hellenic times and examples of it have been noticed in the Aegean cults of the Bronze Age. It probably came from Asia Minor where at Yazilikaya Hittite burials of the second millennium B.C. have been exposed by Dr. Wincklar and Dr. Bittel.13 Here 'a number of large pots (ivithoi) laid in pairs mouth to mouth and within these several smaller vessels containing cremation-ashes' have been unearthed by Dr. Winckler. "On the other hand both at Alishar and at Boghaz- koy numerous inhumations were found by the excavators, the body being laid either in a pair of pithoi placed mouth to mouth or simply in the earth grave ; at Boghazkoy the earth graves were usually in the houses themselves". Garney14 has described in details the funeral rituals of a Hittite king or queen as recorded in the tablets unearthed at Boghazkoy which are quite interesting. Noumann15 has drawn our attention to the custom of the burial of the dead in a jar in ancient America and observes that "it is still practised in South America which confirm the view that the jar receiving the dead belongs to the archetypal symbolism of the Feminine". He has illustrated (Fig. 37) a burial jar from Nazareth, Palestine in which the dead man is laid as a child in the attitude of an a embryo. Those exemples reveal the Archetypal Feminine in the form of a burial vessel or urn who as goddess of death takes back the dead into the urn for recreation. Noumann16 has drawn our attention to a different type of urn designated as "face urns" found from Hisaarlik, associated with the ancient site of Troy and also an effigy vessel of clay dated circa VIII-IV century B.C. and a clay cult figure holding a jar of about IX-VII century B.C., both found from Prussia in Eastern Europe. It has been observed that the accentuation of face and sex is more typical on the urns from Troy, while the specimens from the eastern European countries reveal the accent tends on the necklace and girdle. 'A significant symbolic feature of some of the primitive "woman jars" is the ab- sence of a mouth; however on which breasts are accountuated, these being symbolic of abundance and nourishment. Another group of effigy vessels of terracotta unearthed from Troy IV stratum and illustrated by Neomann (PL 27a) depict the life-naval and the arms as handles and 'is only one example of the world-wide identification of the goddess with the 'poť, the belly symbol par excellence", while the applique bosses representing the accentuated breasts recall these applied on the burial urns from Tekkalakota and Piklihal from Mysore, India, and remind us about those urns ( Kumbhï ) mentioned in the A.SV al ãvana grihyasütra which has been explained as stanavatī by the com-</page><page sequence="5">44 INDIAN HISTORY CONGRESS 1969 mentator Nãrãyatia discussed earlier. Thus the Indian references to the 'female urns' ( Ķumbhī ) are not quite exotic in the light of the world context, rather through these objects feminine elementary character is manifested; the idea of which perhaps originated in Neolithic times. In Cyprus pots called Kernophorai 17 were also worshipped goddesses, but the identification of the Mother Goddess with the pot is not limited to the ancient Mediterranean culture. G.E. Smith18 has rightly said : "The Mother Pot is really a fundamental conception in all religions, and is almost world-wide in its distribution. The pots' identity with the Great Mother is deeply rooted in ancient belief through the greater part of the world". Kosambi19 has kindly drawn our attention to the legends associated with the birth of Vasishtha and Agastya. It is said that Vasishtha was born of a jar which received the combined semen of the two gods Mitra and Varuņa. "Agastya, founder of another major brahmin clan group still extant was similarly born of a jar. The jar represents the womb and thereby the mother goddess. The adoption of such 'jar-born' seers into the high Aryan priest hood was a fundamental innovation. By such recombination of Aryan and autochthene, a new class of specialists developed - the brahmin caste". Pot (Kumbha) worship, a survival of the animistic beliefs of the primitive people, was faily popular and wide spread in the Deccan during the early mediaeval period. R. N. Nandi20 has discussed all such esxamples in an interesting arti- cle. There is a reference about ten Kumbha-devatãs who were actually ten mother goddesses, both benign and malignant worshipped in the temple of Chāmuņdešvari at Kolar in Mysore. Whitehead21 has also drawn our atten- tion to a group of seven goddesses ; possibly Saptamatrikas worshipped in the shape of seven pots in South India. Feminine elementary character is amply manifested through a vessel, kumbha otghata and in our daily worship it is an essential adjunct during which the ritual ghatasthãpana (installation of a vessel) is compulsory under all cir- cumstance which basically represents the deity. In this case the jar becomes the holy abode of the gods or goddesses thereby auspicious, sacrosanct and been bestowing... a symbol of fertility and prosperity to the worshippers. The traditional anthropomorphic ritual vases of Bengal represented only by their heads or faces placed or painted on the symbolic pedestals looking like a belly- shaped ghata bespeak about the ancient custom and reveal their auspicious character. S. K. Roy22 has given a number of illustrations of such anthro- pomorphic ritual vases where the feminity of the deities like Manasā and Sitala has been indicated by the egg-shaped bottom of the pot or a round ball. Mention has been made of the spouted pots or vases being associated with some proto-historic burials. These bowls or vases re-christened as 'channel- spouted bowls', "lipped bowls' or ť Kosīpaatra ' (in Bengali) suggest a form of arghapatta or female genital organ symbolic of fertility. Ray23 has suggested</page><page sequence="6">Ancient ìndia 45 that the shape of such ritual vessels like Kosā-Kusī has been 'copied from Kosa (cover) of fruits of the coconut or betel nut tree. In pre-metal age people probably used to drink water out of these Kosas and in the copper age, for religious purposes, particularly for ancestor worship (tarpana) such familiar 'botanic' instruments had to be modelled in copper". I.K. Sarma24 has drawn our attention to the channeled bowl or vase known as Gokarna (as it resem- bles the ear of a cow) is still very much in use in Andhra-Karnataka in metal. Sites like Patapadu, Pasalapadu, Singanapalle have yielded profusely painted and unpaintd channeled bowls. Sarma has observed that these bowls exhi- bit an evolution from the preceding lower Neolithic of the region itself and certainly earlier than the Malwa Ware Sites like Navadatoli. Incidentally it may be mentioned that Pandu Rajar Dhibi has yielded a profuse quantity of channeled spouted bowls of different types both of painted and unpainted variety. In such a context it may not be improbable that from eastern India such type of bowls originated which later on inspired the chalcolithic settlers of different regions of India. A chalcolithic site at Mahisdal in Bitbhum district where channel spouted bowls recalling the specimens from Fandu Rajar Dhibi occur, has now been dated by C14 method giving a date of 1380 B.C.25 Summing up all the evidences gathered here it may be deduced that the urns associated with the protohistoric burials either in the form of a 'woman jar' or spouted bowls represent then archetype female and can be associated with the fertility cult. The origin of Mother worship can be traced in the line drawings in white pigment consisting of seven rows aář painted inside the chan- nel-spouted bowls from Pandu Rajar Dhibi (Period III) as discussed by the present contributor.25 Notes 1.
