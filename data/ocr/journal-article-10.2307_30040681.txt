STYLE GUIDE FOR AUTHORS The "Style Guide for Authors" covers the for- mat and language to use when preparing manu- scripts for the Academy of Management Journal (AMJ). A different document, "Information for Contributors" (front of each issue or http://aom. pace.edu/amj/submission.html) describes desir- able content. Look for "Style Guide for Authors" on the Web at http://aom.pace.edu/amjnew/styleguide.html and in the February, June, and October issues of AMJ. Manuscript Submission and Length Submit manuscripts electronically to the editor at amjtlee@u.washington.edu following the instructions for electronic submission at http://aom.pace.edu/ amj/electronic.html. Full articles should not ordinarily' exceed 40 pages of double-spaced, 12-point type. Research notes should not ordinarily exceed 25 pages. Publication Process AMJ is not printed directly from authors' files. Accepted manuscripts are copy-edited and re- typed. You will be asked to review edits and to proofread your publication. Although your keystrokes are not preserved, you can smooth the publication process by observing the conventions described and illustrated in this "Guide." Front Pages Address. Under the title of your work, list au- thors' names, affiliations, and complete addresses and contact numbers. Example: AN EXCELLENT STUDY A. MANAGEMENT SCHOLAR Current University School and/or Department Building and/or Street City, State, Zip Code Telephone: (000) 000-0000 Fax: (000) 000-0000 e-mail: scholar@fam.edu The details of your address do not appear in AMJ, but we need them to keep in touch with you. Please keep the editor's office informed about job changes and long absences. Acknowledgment. If you wish to acknowledge financial support or other assistance, add a note at the bottom of page 1, your title page. Abstract. Your abstract and the title of the work go on page 2. Your abstract should be only about 75 words long. Back Pages Group references, appendixes, tables, and figures at the end of your manuscript. Continue your page numbering. Put hard page breaks between these parts. For instance, the references should begin on a new page, not on the last text page. Headings and Sections AMJ uses only three levels of headings. Headings indicate a hierarchy. Main headings have to pre- cede second-level headings, which precede third- level ones. Please do not skip steps and, for in- stance, begin a section with a second-level heading before you have used a first-level heading. Also, whenever you divide a section, use two or more subsections. Main headings. These designate your major sec- tions; three or four main headings should be enough in most cases. Center your main headings and type them in bold capitals. Example: METHODS Second-level headings. Type these flush with the left margin, in bold type, but beginning only major words with capitals. Example: Data and Sample Third-level headings. Indent, use bold italic, be- gin only the first word with a capital, end with a period, and continue immediately with your text. Example: Manager sample. Respondents consisted of a random sample of 300 managers.... Hypotheses Fully and separately state each hypothesis you tested separately. Give it a distinct number or number-letter label. Set hypotheses off in indented blocks, in italic. Example: 118</page><page sequence="2">2003 Volume 46, Number 1 119 Hypothesis l a. Concise writing has a positive relation- ship to publication. Hypothesis lb. Following AMJ's "Style Guide for Au- thors" has a positive relatlionship to publication. Language Technical terms. Help your work to be accessi- ble to AMJ's wide-ranging readership. Define key technical terms. A technical term is a word that is not in a general-use dictionary with the meaning you (or even you and other published scholars) ascribe to it. Quotes can replace defining for tech- nical terms that are not key to your work. Example: We noted several instances of "voluntary turnover," but these were outside the purview of this study. Abbreviations. Avoid using abbreviations for the names of concepts. Names of organizations and research instruments can be abbreviated, but give the full names the first time you mention these. Use ordinary words for variable names-not code names or other abbreviations. Use the same name for a variable throughout your text, tables, figures, and appendixes. Reporting math. Do not "talk in math" in regular text. Use words. For instance, "We surveyed 100 employees," not "We surveyed n = 100 employ- ees" and "We used a chi-square test to evaluate the models," not "We used X2 to evaluate the models." Do use mathematical symbols and numbers to give formulas and to report illustrative results. Ital- icize letters that are customarily italicized-p, r, b, n, F, Z, and so forth. Use bold italic to designate vectors. Use spaces around equals signs. Illustrative results go in parentheses. The text introducing them should be a complete sentence. Example: One coefficient for the multiplicative interaction was significant (model 3: 3 = 0.06, p&lt;.05; model 5: p3 = 1.01, n.s.). Formulas' presentation depends on their role in your research. In general, present those you ob- tained from previous works in parentheses. Example: We used Craig's (1992: 20) distance formula (d = xyz). Formulas that are key to your work may be dis- played-set off, centered, and numbered (in paren- theses, on the far right). Example: [e- x(xt)(x)Yt] Pr(Yt - Ytxt) = Yt! ' (1) where Yt is... Your explanation of each term follows. The equations you used to estimate regression coefficients do not typically need to be displayed. Sexist and biased language. Avoid language that might be interpreted as denigrating to ethnic or other groups. Be particularly careful in dealing with gender, where long-established customs, such as the use of "he" as a generic pronoun ("a manag- er... he"), can imply gender-based discrimination. Using plural pronouns-changing "the manager... he" to "managers... they"-usually helps. Active voice and first person. Put sentences in the active voice ("I did it"; "They did it") instead of the passive voice ("It was done") to make it easy for readers to see who did what. Use the first person ("I" or "we") to describe what you yourself, or you and your coauthors, did. Examples: Passive (less desirable): Two items were found to lack factor validity by Earley (1989). Active (more desirable): Earley (1989) found that two items lacked factor validity. Third person (avoid): The author developed three new items. First person (preferred): I developed three new items. Anthropomorphism. Avoid describing inani- mate entities (models, theories, firms, and so forth) as acting in ways only humans can act. Appendixes Present long but essential methodological details, such as explanations of the calculation of measures, in an appendix or appendixes. Presentation should be concise. If practical for your purposes, make your appen- dix read like regular text. Avoid table formats and reproducing the format of a survey. Look at pub- lished AMJs for models. Multiple appendixes are called APPENDIX A, APPENDIX B, etc. Tables that are parts of appen- dixes are numbered "Table A1, B1," and so forth. Tables and Figures Useful tables and figures do not duplicate the text; they supplement and clarify it. Please carefully con- sider what each table or figure adds to your work. For each table or figure, center "TABLE" or "FIG- URE" with a number (1, 2, etc.) at the top of the page. Put the title under this, also centered and bold.</page><page sequence="3">120 Academy of Management Journal February Number tables and figures consecutively (one se- ries for tables, one for figures). Group them at the end of the manuscript as described under "Back Pages" above. Indicate the position of each in the text as follows: Insert Table 2 about here Each table or figure must have a sentence in your text that introduces it. More on tables. Use more than one page if needed for a neat, readable presentation. Do not squeeze material onto one page by shrinking type or abbreviating. Spell out the names of variables. Do not use codes. Example: Yes: Profitability No: PRFT Each table should report one type of analysis (which is identified in the title), and each vertical column and horizontal row should contain only one type of data. Label the data across the top or down the far-left side, not in the body. Please don't add labels in the body. Report only two decimal places for statistics. In a correlation matrix, the correlations should fill the lower-left corner of the table. For general footnotes to tables, use letters. For significance levels, you may use a summary foot- note: "aAll values greater than . . ." Or use this format: * p &lt; .05 ** p&lt; .01 *** p &lt; .001 The single asterisk should always match the .05 level. More on figures. Figures (unlike tables) have graphics. If possible, our printer scans figures di- rectly from your manuscript into the publication. So make sure your figures will print out crisp and clear. Avoid "stacking"-write all words horizontally, not vertically. Use the same full (not abbreviated) variable names you used in the text and in the tables. Look at figures in published AMJs for format ideas. Citations Citations are your in-text identifications of the work you drew on in your research. Every work you cite formally also needs to have a reference (see below). Minimize self-citations that would reveal your manuscript's authorship to protect the double-blind review process. To cite, enclose authors' names and the years of works in parentheses. Example: Several studies (Adams, 1974; Brown &amp; Hales, 1975, 1980; Collins, 1976a, 1976b) support this conclusion. Alphabetization. Order citations alphabetically. Two or more works by one author (or by an iden- tical group of authors) published in the same year should have "a," "b," and so forth added after the year. No author? For an article in a periodical with no author, cite the periodical it is in as the author: (Wall Street Journal, 1990) For reports, handbooks, and the like, cite the "cor- porate author" that produced them. Example: "... forecasts of increasing service jobs in the U.S. Industrial Outlook (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1992)... An alternate way to provide this information is to give it in running text: ". . . forecasts of increasing service jobs in the 1992 U.S. Industrial Outlook from the U.S. Department of Commerce." No corre- sponding reference will then be needed. Page numbers. To cite a direct quotation, give its page after the year, separated from it by a colon and a space. Example: Adams has said that writing a book is "a long and arduous task" (1974: 3). Also cite page numbers when you paraphrase or summarize others' specific arguments or findings. Multiple authors. If a work has two authors, give both names every time you cite it. For three through six authors, give all names the first time, then use "et al." Examples: First citation: Few field studies use random assign- ment (Foster, Whittington, Tucker, Horner, Hubbard, &amp; Grimm, 2000). Subsequent citation:.., even when random assign- ment is not possible (Foster et al., 2000). For seven or more authors, use "et al." even for the first citation. (But the corresponding reference should give all the authors.) Electronic sources. Treat these as regular cita- tions if you can identify an author of one of the</page><page sequence="4">2003 Volume 46, Number 1 121 types noted above (human, periodical, or corpo- rate). If not, you may just give the Web address that was the source of the information in parentheses. No corresponding reference need then be used. References References are your entries in the alphabetical list at the end of your article or research note. This list includes only work you have cited. Order. Alphabetize references by the last name of a sole author, a first author, or an editor, or by the name of a corporate author (for instance, U.S. Cen- sus Bureau) or periodical (such as the Wall Street Journal) if there is no human author or editor. Or- der works by an identical author by year of publi- cation, listing the earliest first. If the years of pub- lication are also the same, differentiate entries by adding small letters ("a," "b," etc.) after the years. Repeat author's name for each entry. Book entries.

Paetzold, Texas A&amp;M University BACKGROUND Goffman originally defined stigma as a distinguishing characteristic or mark that leads to the devaluation of the individual. Goffman saw abominations of the body, blemishes of individual character, and tribal identities as the three categories of stigmatizing conditions. More recently, Jen- nifer Crocker and colleagues have argued that "visibility" and "controllability" are the most important dimensions of stigma, be- cause visible and controllable stigmas are the most damaging. Stigmatization has been the subject of in- tensive research in a variety of settings by social psychologists. There has been a rela- tive neglect, however, of stigmatization in organizational and work settings. The roles that people occupy at work, their experi- ences while performing these roles, and the groups and organizations with which they are affiliated all serve as potentially power- ful sources of stigma. Stigmas that originate outside the organization intrude upon and influence what happens inside the organi- zation. Stigmas that originate in the work- place are important to control processes in organizations and affect other spheres of an individual's activities outside of work. This special issue will build on the psychological and sociological work on stigmas to explore the relevance of this work to individuals and groups within organizations. The expecta- tion is that stigmatization in organizations requires a reconceptualization that incorpo- rates dynamics that operate beyond the level of the individual. Although not inclusive, the following set of research questions includes issues that could be addressed: * Individual-level stigma. Is stigma a property of the individual in the organi- zation, or is it constructed by the per- ceiver? How does an individual in an or- ganization come to be stigmatized? How do individuals in an organization over- come stigma? What goals are served by the stigmatizer? What factors affect the stigmatization process? What factors out- side of the individual (organization level or group level) affect stigmatization of the individual? Are there positive outcomes of stigmatization for the organization? To what extent are stigmas, or stigmatiza- tion, universal? To what extent are they culturally bound? How does stigmatiza- tion differ from deviance, prejudice, and discrimination? * Internal organizational functioning. How does the person-job or person- organization fit model relate to and in- fluence stigmatization? Do performance appraisal, selection, compensation, and other HR functions lead to stigmatiza- tion? Is stigmatization on the basis of dishonest or ineffective behavior crucial to maintaining organizational control? How does stigmatization af- fect efforts to achieve continuous im- provement in organizations? Does a strong organizational culture necessar- ily involve stigmatization of those who do not conform to the culture? Does di- versity increase tolerance for differ- ences in organizations, or does it allow stigmatization to transmogrify into something else? * Group-level stigma. How does occupa- tion tarnish or stain the individual who is a member of that occupational group? Which occupations are more stigmatizing and why? How does the trend toward team management relate to and influence stigmatization? Can social group stigma be "undone" in the workplace? * Organizational-level stigma. What does it mean for an organization to be stigmatized? What are the processes by which an organization becomes</page><page sequence="6">stigmatized? How can organizational reputation be stigmatizing? How do organizations confront potentially stigmatizing events and situations? How do stigmatized organizations en- gage in impression management for external and internal constituencies? How can organizations use stigmas to their advantage? What are the ante- cedents of organizational stigma? What are the organizational conse- quences of stigmatizing events? How can organizations and their members predict, cope with, and overcome or- ganizational stigmas? * Methods. How do we measure stigma? What are the particular concerns of multilevel approaches to the study of stigma? Does the construct have the same meaning across levels?

Anand, and Jos6 Luis Alvarez Cultural industries involve a wide range of contexts that create products providing a range of aesthetic, emotional, and intellectual experiences. The view generally seen in the popular press is that cultural industries comprise people in creative roles who voice their unique talents and desires through the creation of a cultural product - be it a song, a character in a play, a film, a research agenda, a book, a painting or piece of sculpture. We understand creative voice in terms of an individual's ability to resolve problems in unique and distinctive ways. The public is drawn to these people for their "authenticity" - that is, their intrinsic drive for genuine self- expression. In the book "Creating Country Music," the sociologist Richard A. Peterson describes how cultural industries attract consumers by manufacturing authenticity--by carefully cultivating the impression that a cultural product is "authentic" in the way it gives voice to individual self-expression. Indeed, his "production of culture" approach claims that conglomerate firms manufacture authenticity strategically by first identifying consumer preferences and then developing appropriate "products" to tap into these tastes. Therefore, a creative voice that is held up as authentic is often the product of carefully intended organizational processes. So, how is creative energy harnessed for corporate profit? What is the interplay between creative self-expression and corporate marketing strategies? How does a cultural product come to be seen as authentic? We offer a special issue and seek empirically based submissions exploring manufactured authenticity and creative voice in cultural industries. We invite submissions that explore - but are not limited to - issues such as: * How is the creative expression of gifted individuals mediated by masterful corporate strategies to create "authentic" cultural products? What are artists', producers' and distributors' strategies for creating, and defining authenticity? How does corporate strategy shape our understanding of what is authentic? * Who are the gatekeepers defining whose voices are heard and what is authentic? How does collaboration occur among and between artists, producers, and distributors in crafting an authentic creative voice? * What is the role of cultural understandings and institutions in defining exemplars of authenticity? What case studies can help us understand how judgments are made about "authentic" cultural voices? How do judgments about Pier Paolo Passolini (an Italian gay film director who focused on marginality and discrimination in his films) differ from that of Rock Hudson (an acknowledged Hollywood star of his time whose carefully cultivated screen persona was radically different from his personal life) as "authentic" cultural voices? * Where does authenticity originate? Does originate among mavericks pursuing innovations at the margins of a cultural industry? Or: is it established professionals who create authenticity by carefully choosing among the range of cultural innovations on offer? * What field- and organization-level processes contribute to the manufacturing of authenticity? How are claims contested and by whom? Why is one claim to authenticity given credence within a field while others dismissed? How does a cultural product come to be institutionalized as authentic within a field? * What is the role of technologies, both old and new, in defining authenticity and voice? Do new technologies ease or hinder authenticity? Do these technologies institutionalize and shape whose claims to authenticity are heard? Papers should advance our theoretical and/or empirical understanding of the manufacturing of authenticity and creative voice in cultural industries. To be considered for publication, manuscripts should be received by September 2, 2003. All papers will be double-blind reviewed following the Journal's normal review process and criteria.
