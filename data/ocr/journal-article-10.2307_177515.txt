<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ecology, Vol. 81, No. 12 writing." I concur. The authors provide such worldly advice that the book could easily be subtitled "Recommendations for proposal writing from the School of Hard Knocks." In a very small space, the monumental task of writing a grant proposal is reduced to a series of smaller jobs that can be completed in an orderly and timely manner. This, along with the recommended exercises for developing writing skills, make this an exceptional handbook for first time authors, or as a text for a graduate level course in proposal preparation. My copy of Writing successful science proposals is already worn. The authors recommend reading the book in its entirety before beginning to write. I did. Twice. During the first read- ing, I referred to it to make comments on a draft of a col- league's proposal. During the second reading, I began jotting notes for my next proposal. Putting the seat of my pants in the seat of my chair has become a bit easier (much to the chagrin of my pets) since my introduction to Friedland and Folt. This exceptionally useful and affordable handbook will serve as a refresher to seasoned writers and as a guide and source of encouragement for first-time authors. It will likely find its way to a large host of bookshelves, but has already been borrowed from mine. C. L.

The destruction of the bison: an environmental history, 1750-1920. Studies in Environ- ment and History. Cambridge University Press, New York. xii + 206 p. $24.95, ISBN: 0-521-77172-2. The American bison, also known as the American buffalo, became the dominant large herbivore on the Great Plains of North America after the extinction of the Pleistocene megafauna. Whereas mammoths, horses, camels, rhinoceroses, sloths, and other large herbivores were extirpated or became extinct as the glaciers receded, bison survived and thrived. Before humans of European descent began to exert their influence on the biota of North America, the number of bison living here periodically may have approached 30 million. A little more than a century later, fewer than 1000 bison remained. Numerous books have been written about the destruction of the bison, but most attempt to place the blame on just one or a few causes. So far as we are aware, no previous book places a multitude of historical events into a complex eco- logical framework as a means of explaining the demise of the bison. The author of this book, Andrew Isenberg, is a historian at Princeton who had no formal training in ecology or conservation biology. His knowledge of history is un- questioned, but he admits (in personal communication) that he had reservations about his lack of background in conser- vation biology. He therefore both studied the literature of conservation biology and asked ecologically astute col- leagues to preview his text in order to avoid technical errors. Isenberg evidently understands the fallacy of searching for just one cause for a phenomenon as complex as extinction. Instead, he attempts to explain how, with respect to the bison, historical events upset the precarious balance of a dynamic ecological system, resulting in a crash. Isenberg's thesis is that the near extinction of the bison was the eventual consequence of cultural and ecological en- counters between Native Americans and Euroamericans on the Great Plains. Bison populations were dynamic and un- stable, fluctuating in response to the availability of adequate food and water, weather conditions (especially drought), pre- dation (by as many as 1.5 million wolves, not to mention Native Americans), competition (with horses and, later, cat- tle), prairie fires, accidents (such as drowning), and disease (culminating with diseases transmitted to bison by introduced cattle). Various combinations of these factors initially may have served to prevent overpopulation of bison but caused extreme volatility of bison numbers. However, until the nine- teenth century, the resilient bison seemingly always recovered from depressed population numbers and reestablished its dominance in the region. The arrival of horses on the Great Plains between 1700 and 1750 upset the precarious ecological balance that served to maintain bison populations. Isenberg explains how horses transformed several Native American cultures to a nomadic lifestyle that was essentially dependent on the bison. Cultural encounters between Native Americans and Euroamericans led to the development of trade for bison robes. Isenberg docu- ments the fact that Native Americans did much more to dec- imate bison populations than much of the published literature suggests, and when Native Americans were eliminated as a serious impact they were replaced by Euroamerican buffalo hunters. Market hunting, coupled with the effects of a major drought, diseases transmitted to bison by cattle, winterkill, and other factors, decimated the vast herds of bison. It is noteworthy that Euroamericans anticipated the extinction of the bison but regarded the disappearance of the herds as a triumph of civilization over savagery. Isenberg debunks numerous myths regarding bison, most notably the romantic notion that Native Americans practiced sustainable husbandry with respect to the herds of bison. In fact, commercial exploitation of bison by Native Americans both transformed tribal culture and exhausted the natural re- source on which the tribes depended. Obviously, the same thing is happening today in many areas of our planet. 3550 BOOK REVIEWS</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS There are minor mistakes scattered throughout the text. For example, Isenberg misuses scientific names in several places, sometimes failing to capitalize generic names, once or twice using wrong specific names, and at least once failing to ital- icize a scientific name. We noted one particularly naive and anthropomorphic statement: "Northern herds assembled for the rut later than those to the south, perhaps to ensure that calves would not arrive until late in the succeeding spring ...." Additionally, we found the method used to cite published literature to be especially onerous. Citations are listed as footnotes only; there is no section in which all the cited references are listed. This makes it difficult or impos- sible for a reader to quickly scan the cited papers of a par- ticular author. Finally, there are a few misspellings, and it would have been helpful for non-historians if the author had included more maps showing the locations of forts, posts, and other places mentioned in text. According to the author, the text of The destruction of the bison originated as a series of individual papers published in scholarly journals. As might be expected, the book therefore suffers from disjointed organization and contains unnecessary repetition. For example, Isenberg discusses the relatively short roots of native grasses in dry areas of the High Plains on page 18 and again on page 141. A biologist or student who wishes to compile dates, numbers, and other information from the book thus will find it difficult to do so. However, the persistent re- searcher will be rewarded for his or her efforts. Conservation biologists and ecologists concerned with ex- tinction, its causes, and its prevention, will find this history book informative, enlightening, scholarly, and thorough. To avoid repeating history, we must strive to understand it. JERRY R. CHOATE EUGENE D.

Munawar, M., T. A. Edsall, and I. E Munawar, editors. 1999. State of Lake Erie: past, present and future. Backhuys Publishers, Leiden, The Netherlands. xvi + 550 p. $140.00, ISBN: 90-5782-018-8. Some people may remember the television special in the 1960s that proclaimed, "Who Killed Lake Erie" and stim- ulated the environmental movement. Some people still be- lieve that Lake Erie is dead. Good news! Lake Erie has been revived-not from death but from a critical illness. In fact, researchers say that Lake Erie now is experiencing oligotro- phication and some think that nutrient loading was reduced too much or at least too quickly. Lake Erie is one of the best documented cases of human abuses of an ecosystem, ecosystem changes, and restoration. Its case history is important because it shows that humans can drastically alter huge ecosystems and that the same things that happened to Lake Erie are happening to an enormous number of lakes. We should be able to learn from Lake Erie and be encouraged that humans can reverse the degradation. A difficult problem for people interested in Lake Erie is that scientific information is scattered in scientific journals and buried in agency reports. The first effort to concentrate man- uscripts on physical, chemical, and biological aspects of Lake Erie occurred in 1976 in the Journal of the Fisheries Research Board of Canada (volume 33). This issue documented the eutrophication and drastic changes in species composition of Lake Erie. Unfortunately, no one has compiled a collection of scientific papers that document the changes and processes that have occurred in Lake Erie after the nutrient reduction program until now. If you would like to quickly learn about the changes in Lake Erie over the past two decades, consult a book called State of Lake Erie: past, present and future. The book is a collection of manuscripts from a symposium at the 39th In- ternational Association for Great Lakes Research conference in 1996. Although laypersons may find some valuable infor- mation, the manuscripts are technical and scholarly works. The symposium was dedicated to two renown Lake Erie sci- entists, Joseph Leach and Henry Regier, who were retiring. Dr. Leach wrote the first chapter and presented a historical overview of the major changes in Lake Erie, the key research programs and researchers, and important policies. This paper set the stage well for more in-depth papers. Dr. J. J. Kay and Dr. Regier wrote the last paper. They summarized the changes in Lake Erie by a "two-phase attractor" model that suggests that an aquatic ecosystem may alternate between dominance by the benthic and pelagic regimes. This paper is thought- provoking and should stimulate future research. The papers in the book are grouped into four sections: the changing ecosystem, invasion of exotics, contaminants, and emerging approaches and techniques. There are twelve papers in the first section and the papers intensively cover changes in the major components of the Lake Erie ecosystem. This section contains an excellent collection of papers on changes in sediments, water quality, invertebrates, phytoplankton, and fish. The second section contains five papers. The first paper by Hugh MacIsaac is a survey of biological invasions in Lake Erie. I recommend this paper to anyone interested in invasive species. It is a thorough review of the origins, modes of invasion, and significance of invasive species in Lake Erie. Furthermore, he discusses 31 species that are likely future invaders of Lake Erie and their likely modes of invasion. The December 2000 355 1</page></plain_text>
