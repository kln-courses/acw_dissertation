<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHURCH HISTORY perhaps influenced by his reading of Ignatius-he said that even the Father "experiences human passions." In the extant Latin version this is humanas sustinet passiones, equivalent to the Greek paschein or pathein ti anthropinon, as in the Commentary on Matthew 15.16 and 16.1; patiens aliquid humanum in Latin there. In other words, the ancient differentiation of anthropomorphic/ nonanthropomorphic does not fit either scripture or Origen's thought- which was something in motion, not fixed. As for Epiphanius, it is significant that he drags up charges against "Gnostics" and applies them to certain "Origenians," even though he admits he has no ideas who that "Origen" might be (Heresies 63). For the real Origen he supplies even more scandal than the absurd story Clark criticizes (p. 91): his patron Ambrose, they say, was a Marcionite or a Sabellian, while there are those who claim he took drugs to improve his memory (Heresies 64.3.1,12). In social history, I found especially interesting Theophilus's claim that Origenist monks opposed his attack on the temple of Serapis (p. 109, n. 183, citing Jerome Epistles 92.3.2). (Epiphanius had said that Origen attacked this temple, Heresies 64.1,4.) Unfortunately Jerome's editor Hilberg marked what they said as "gravely corrupted." But at least Theophilus thought the monks could be accused of such disgraceful moderation. We also note Clark's suggestion (p. 104, n. 145) that when the enigmatic Joseppus locates Anthro- pomorphites at Eleutheropolis in Palestine he is veiling an attack on Epipha- nius. This may be so, but Joseppus owes an immense debt to Epiphanius for his information about oriental heresies, not to Epiphanius directly but to whoever wrote the rather vapid summaries of each chapter. Chicago, Illinois ROBERT M. GRANT Rufinus of Aquileia and the "Historia Ecclesiastica," Lib. VIII-IX, of Eusebius. By TORBEN CHRISTENSEN. Historisk-filosofiske Meddelelser 58. Copenhagen: Kongelige Danske Videnskabernes Selskab, 1989. 339 pp. DDK 450,00 paper. This work by Torben Christensen is a posthumous contribution to the study of both Eusebius of Caesarea and Rufinus of Aquileia. Christensen has built upon the critical studies of Eduard Schwartz and Richard Laqueur in his investigation of books eight and nine of Eusebius's Ecclesiastical History. Both earlier scholars recognized and demonstrated the textual problems presented by Eusebius in these two books. Clearly, this section of the Ecclesiastical History has been reworked repeatedly by its author. Christensen was convinced that what was needed was a thorough internal criticism of Eusebius's text. His methodology was as follows. First, he would seek to discover the connection between individual sections. Then he would endeavor to establish whether these sections displayed features suggesting 380</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS that they belonged together originally. Finally, he would seek to determine whether these sections represented specific traditions-either written or oral sources-and how they were related to each other. As he proceeded with his methodology, Christensen came to the conclu- sion that Eusebius's account in books eight and nine was the product of his constant adaptation of the material. Some of the adaptations were due to additional information which Eusebius wanted to include. Others were to correct obvious discrepancies. The second part of Christensen's investigation dealt with Rufinus's Latin interpretation of the same portion of the Ecclesiasti- cal History. Using the principles of internal criticism, Christensen analyzed Rufinus's version of the appropriate section of Eusebius, indicating which passages were simple reproductions and which diverged from the original. The purpose of this analysis was to discover motives which inspired Rufinus to differ with Eusebius. Unfortunately, this textual comparison was never completed for book nine before Christensen's death in 1983. In his introduc- tion, Christensen indicated his hope that this line of study, begun, but not completed, would inspire future research on both Eusebius and Rufinus. In book eight of the Ecclesiastical History, in which Christensen did complete his critical analysis, he proceeded in a careful and intensive manner, chapter by chapter, and often line by line, noting Rufinus's divergences from Eusebius, and seeking to explain them as he went along. A conclusion to the book is provided by a monograph which Christensen published shortly before undertaking his larger work, and which bears the same title as the book. It is Christensen's judgment that Rufinus deviated from his source in three respects. Stylistically, he sought to make a clear Latin translation by breaking Eusebius's long sentences into short, succinct ones. With regard to content, Rufinus endeavored to correct wrong and mislead- ing historical information by supplying additional background material. He further sought to create a continuous account emphasizing the religious and moral lessons which make up the history of the church. Christensen concludes that Rufinus's reworking of the Ecclesiastical History, books eight and nine, clearly indicates the "patchwork" nature of the origi- nal. Rufinus was less interested in providing a literal translation than in bringing out the sense of the work. In Christensen's judgment Rufinus's translation is a valuable source for his own theological thinking. Through the translation, Rufinus has proved himself to be a competent scholar and independent thinker. Incomplete though it is, Christensen's work needs to be taken into account in any future textual criticism of Eusebius's Ecclesiastical History, as well as in any evaluation of Rufinus. 381 Bend, Oregon DONALD KRUG</page></plain_text>
