<plain_text><page sequence="1">NORTHWESTERN AUSTRALIA AND THE QUESTION OF INFLUENCES FROM THE EAST INDIES D. S. DAVIDSON UNIVEUSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA SINCE THE early days of speculation on the peopling of the Australian continent the northwest coast has been frequently sug- gested as the region of original entry of either the aborigines them- selves or of subsequent non-Australian visitors to whom have been attributed various culture traits now of major or minor significance on the continent. Two distinctly different problems thus are in- volved, each of which must be treated separately in any objective consideration of the theories advanced. The theory that the Australians first reached their continent by a journey in canoes or other forms of watercraft from Timor or other islands in the Sunda chain to the northwest coast was a fairly popular one during the 19th century at which time questions of racial or cultural derivations were often answered without due regard to facts or probabilities, or in spite of them. Culture and race were confused as one and the same and whenever necessary to the arguments being advanced specific culture traits were assumed to have been in existence at the requisite time, and to have occupied the proper distributions suited to the theory being propounded. Thus if it were taken for granted that sea-going watercraft capable of reaching Australia were available in the Sunda Islands at the time the Australians migrated it was convenient to conclude that they came by the most direct route from Asia, via Timor to the northwest coast.1 In more recent years evidence which throws definite doubts on such a theory of maritime migration has been slowly accumulating. In the first place it seems quite likely that Australians have in- habited their continent since early Recent times, if not since late in the Pleistocene period, and we can be quite dubious that water- craft capable of crossing from Timor to Australia, whatever the 1 Such an opinion has been expressed by several early writers, for instance, Eyre, II, p. 405 (1845), who specified 12'-16'S. as the area of arrival; Prichard, V, p. 214 (1847); Smyth, I, p. lxiii (with some reserva- tions) (1878); Curr, I, p. 190ff. (1886); Mathew, (a late wave) (1889). 61</page><page sequence="2">62 D. S. Davidson distance may have been under changed conditions of sea level, were employed anywhere in the world at that early time. Indeed the available data suggest that craft suited for distant journeys on the open sea may have been unknown in the major islands of the East Indies until possibly late in the first millennium B. 0.2 Secondly, in so far as the Australians themselves are concerned, there is no evidence to indicate that they ever were seafarers. Ocean going craft not only -are still unknown to them but the most advanced types of craft they possess, the ordinary dugout and the dugout with outrigger attachment, were introduced into North Australia and the Cape York Peninsula respectively, apparently within the past 150 to 200 years. We can trace the 600 mile west- ward diffusion of the dugout from Clarence Strait, North Australia, to the Prince Regent River, Western Australia, since 1837, and also the recent spread of the triangular raft which preceded the dugout along this coast.3 Thus, except for crude rafts or swimming logs, there is no evidence to suggest that the aborigines of the northwestern costal regions ever were acquainted with watercraft until the twentieth century. For the remainder of the western and southern coasts of the continent as far east as the mouth of the Murray River in South Australia no watercraft of any description are reported for ocean use. Nor is any employed on the rivers, except crude rafts or swimming logs in a very few localities. It seems useless to discuss the point whether the Australians of this extensive western and southern coastal region may once have possessed watercraft. It is true that much of the western coastal country is not particularly inviting to seafarers, yet there are numerous regions where a knowledge of watercraft would be such an advantage, particularly in view of the forbidding hinterland of much of Western Australia, that there can be no logical basis for a supposition of watercraft degeneration or extinction in this region. The ready acceptance of the dugout canoe along the Kimberley coast within the past few years and its rapid assimilation in the 2 All early migrants into the Pacific, the Tasmanians, Australians, Pygmies, Melanesians, and Indonesians seem to have confined their atten- tions to the more or less contiguously distributed islands few of which require more than 50 miles of sea voyaging at present sea level. See Davidson, 1937 B. 8 See Davidson, 1935 A, p. 45.</page><page sequence="3">Northwestern Australia 63 local culture indicates the importance which watercraft can have in this region if known. Indeed the raft and dugout have become so thoroughly integrated in certain regions where it is known that they were lacking a few years ago that if historical records of their recent introduction were not available some, on the basis of their close integration in local culture at the present time, might be inclined to argue for a much greater antiquity. Porteus 4 recently has revived the theory of an original landing of aborigines on the northwest coast and even specifies the area be- tween the 15th and the 20th degrees of latitude as the place of entry. His main argument is that if the aborigines first reached fertile northeastern Australia they never would have moved into the inhospitable central and western regions of the continent. The fallacies of such an argument are numerous. In the first place we have no right to assume that the desert regions were always as inhospitable as they are at present. Indeed, the circumstantial evidence of man's antiquity in Australia coupled with geological and palaeontological considerations suggest that man may have occupied what is now desert country at a time when climatic condi- tions were much more favorable. Secondly, we cannot admit that population had not reached its optimum in the congenial eastern area as he claims. It seems not unlikely, generally speaking, that the native population in all parts of Australia had reached the maximum possible under the Australian system of economy. Thirdly, and his point seems to be generally misunderstood, it is we, not the aborigines of the desert regions, who regard their habitat as unfavorable. The exigencies of life require a smaller population spread over a larger territory but this is considered normal by them. The inhabitants of the interior do not think in terms of the Queens- land coast or of other more favorable regions unknown to them but only in terms of conditions among their more or less immediate neighbors who occupy at best only a slightly different environment. Any people tends to regard as satisfactory a region which furnishes sufficient food to provide what to them is an abundance of food in good years, a bare sufficiency in poor years. Furthermore, in view of the fact that the aboriginal population in northwestern Australia seems to have been from 15 to 40 times more dense than in the ' Porteus, 1931; reiterated 1937.</page><page sequence="4">64 D. S. Davidson desert interior 5 one could employ Porteus' logic to maintain that if Australians arrived on the northwest coast they would have been no more likely to move inland than if they had first gone to the northeast, but could have absorbed the small percentage of excess population now found in the interior deserts or through the pre- vailing custom of infanticide could have maintained population at the saturation point, as in historic times, thus eliminating any need of migration into the interior. Porteus hypothecates the routes of ethnic movements not only for the northwest but for the entire continent. Since it probably never will be possible to throw light on such movements, even though we could determine the approxi- mate antiquity and could secure evidence of climatic conditions of that early time, his map can be considered worthless. The most recent discussion of a northwest coast entry is that of iHaddon who follows the suggestions of Taylor that in late Pleisto- cene times the continental shelf of Australia extended to within 80 miles of Timor. That the ocean level was lower during the glacial periods than at present is generally accepted; however, in order to reduce the gap between Australia and Timor to 80 miles a drop of 600 feet in ocean surface must be postulated, whereas probably few geologists would be willing to admit that the evidence indicates a change in sea level of more than from 200 to 300 feet. But long before the ocean surface could have dropped to the 600 foot level it would have been increasingly easy for man to have moved on from island to island until New Guinea was reached. New Guinea is now separated from the Cape York Peninsula, Australia, by only the 100 miles of Torres Strait, which not only is studded with islands but is only 60 feet deep. Thus there seem to be no good grounds so far advanced for the belief that migrating Australians arrived on the northwest coast from the Sunda islands. This leaves as the only plausible avenue of migration the New Guinea-Torres Strait-Cape York Peninsula route to which the early writers seem to have objected principally because Australians had not been identified in New Guinea. How- 5Radcliffe-Brown, p. 688, estimates that the density of population in the Gascoyne area is 1 to 5 square miles. It is probable that in the Kimberley there was 1 person to 10 square miles. It seems likely that between 150 and 200 square miles are required to provide subsistence for one aborigine in the desert areas.</page><page sequence="5">Northwestern Australia 65 ever, Howells recently has summarized the information to show that mixed Australoids are not only present in New Guinea but in other parts of Melanesia. This finding, combined with the probable relatively great antiquity of occupation of Australia, the probable relatively recent appearance of sea-going watercraft in the East Indies and Melanesian areas, and the unlikelihood of any sufficiently narrow strait between Australia and Timor within the proper time interval to warrant the suspicion that such a strait could have been crossed on crude craft, would seem to establish the Cape York route of entry as the only plausible one which the early Australians could have followed. The question whether subsequent peoples came to the north- western coastal districts, either by accident or by design, to settle in that region or to visit the area, introduce blood or elements of culture and then return to their home lands, is quite another problem which at the moment admits of no satisfactory conclusion. The theory that one or more such movements have occurred has been advanced variously by several of the older writers." But none has presented a strong case for his inductions and in most instances the arguments given are decidedly weak or fanciful. In order to demonstrate that non-Australians have come to northwestern Australia we need to find either non-Australian skeletal remains or evidence to show definite miscegenation in the present population, or localized specific elements of culture which can be identified with appearances in some foreign region. As is well known, Australian racial features are marked by such general homogeneity that any intermixture with other races should be either obvious in first or second generations of mixed bloods or demon- strable by statistical analysis for later generations, providing the miscegenation is more or less general in a given region. Apparently no one would insist that there has been a large scale migration of non-Australians to these shores but at the most only small groups of occasional visitors. Thus it can be rightfully maintained that if a very small hypothetical non-Australian group arrived in north- western Australia several generations ago they may have been so completely absorbed that indications of their presence in the present population might not be detectable. Hence it follows that the lack 6 For various theories and discussions see Mathew, 1889, 1893, 1910; Curr, I, p. 190ff.; Howitt, 1898, 1904, p. 1 et seq. 5</page><page sequence="6">66 D. S. Davidson of definite indications of mixture cannot in itself be considered actual proof that non-Australians have never visited the northwest. Various claims of the presence of natives showing slight indica- tions of Malay features have been advanced, but as yet they have not been substantiated by anthropometric studies. In view of the fact that the aborigines in coastal North Australia, where Malays are known to have visited over a period of several generations, show virtually no indications of intermixture, we cannot pass judgment on the validity of such statements for the northwest until detailed investigations in this area have been conducted. At the moment claims of foreign racial features in this part of the continent must be regarded as still unsupported by tangible evidence, but we have no reason to believe that foreign visitors, if they actually came, had any profound effect on Australian racial features. Australian culture also is characterized by homogeneity in general, although there are various distinguishing traits of local or sectional provenience which serve to set off the culture of one part of the continent from that in another. The presence of localized traits in the southern half of the continent would generally be considered without hesitation as examples of local origin, for the question of foreign introduction along the southern coast would hardly arise. For the northern coast, on the other hand, the possibility of non- Australian derivations cannot be ignored; hence we should examine those aspects of culture peculiar to the northwest with the view of determining whether there is evidence either to demonstrate or to suggest their local origin, or to furnish proof for, or to warrant the suspicion of, foreign derivation. As known at the moment there are only a few culture traits which are prominent in the northwest but lacking in, or at'least not reported as present for, other parts of the continent. These include: (1) bark buckets; (2) the angular meander design; (3) woondjina paintings; (4) profusely decorated pendants of pearl shell; (5) stone artifacts of phallic shape; and (6) stone spearheads manu- factured by pressure flaking. However, none of these traits is of such a character per se that suspicions of a non-Australian origin come to mind. If they were found localized in some southern district, there undoubtedly would be little hesitancy in regarding each of them as an example of local invention or of local elaboration from some simpler and more</page><page sequence="7">Northwestern Australia 67 widespread appearance. It is principally because they are confined to the northwestern area within about 350 miles of Timor that the possibility of foreign derivation warrants consideration. However, it is important to note that on the basis of available information we either have definite suggestions that these traits are indigenous to the northwest or no evidence which would indicate a derivation from some overseas region.7 7Bark buckets. These pail-like containers of paperbark seem to be restricted to the Kimberley coast. At present there is no evidence either to suggest a point of origin outside of this coastal area or to indicate their antiquity in this region. Since they are not reported from the East Indies, it seems not unlikely that they are of local origin in the Kimberley region. For a more detailed discussion see Davidson, 1937 C. Angular meander design. This designation has been applied to a varying series of designs ranging from an interlocking key pattern to ordinary zigzags which merge with herring-bone designs, also present in the same region. Aside from an occasional application in paint to such objects as boabab nuts the angular meander motif is strictly associated with the incising of hard surfaces, as hardwood shields and pearl shell, which by their nature would be more difficult to engrave with rounded designs. Although it is conceivable that a perfected interlocking key pattern could have been introduced into this area and subsequently combined with old local designs to produce varying appearances it also seems apparent that the more perfected designs could have been developed from old herring-bone and zigzag patterns applied in the incising technique. Neither angular meanders nor interlocking-key designs have been found, in so far as I am aware, in nearby Malaysia. Hence, at the moment, we have no reason to suspect a foreign derivation. For details on Australian design motifs see Davidson, 1937 A. Wondjina paintings. The Kimberley district is the center of a most impressive type of rock painting called by local aborigines wondjina. Anthropomorphic in character these paintings consist of a face and bust and occasionally of a torso, arms, and legs. The face is characterized by wide open eyes and a nose, but the mouth and chin are consistently lacking. Surrounding the sides and top of the head is a horseshoe-shaped band from which fine radiating lines emanate. The body, when shown, usually is filled with vertical solid lines or lines of dashes. First noticed in 1838, this type of painting has since been subject to endless discussion by various writers who have attempted to demonstrate the derivation as Sumatran, as Malayan-Sumatran, as belonging to " Red Sea Merchants," as Chaldaeo-Phoenician, as representative of Iiva (Mahadeva) of the Hindus. In some instances such theories are based upon the various interpretations of a few marks, assumed to be alphabetic characters, associated with a single painting, seen in 1838, of which we have no photograph but merely a sketch. The band and radiating lines</page><page sequence="8">68 D. S.

Recent ethnological investigations, however, have shown that these paintings are thoroughly integrated in aboriginal culture. Each year the paintings are retouched during important religious ceremonies associated with food increase rites and the return of the wet season. The " halos " are identified as head-bands portrayed in a flat and circumscribing position because of the lack of knowledge of the principal of perspective. The radiating lines portray the hair. The marks and lines on the body represent falling rain or the chest. Stylistically these paintings are similar to appearances found throughout the continent and characterized by (1) lack of mouth and chin, (2) hair shown by lines radiating from the scalp, and (3) lines on the body to show body decorations. Hence we have no reason to regard the wondjina appearances as anything other than the local elaboration of a style of portrayal with widespread distribution on the continent. Of quite a different character are some paintings along the Prince Regent River, Kimberley district, sketched and painted but not photographed by Bradshaw. These portrayals show considerable divergences from the usual run of Australian rock paintings but since the European character of Bradshaw's reproductions may be the result of distortions of the originals we should not give further consideration to these paintings until photo- graphs are available. For illustrations and a more detailed discussion of the wondjina paintings and those by Bradshaw, see Davidson, 1936A. Profusely decorated pendants of pearl shell. Typical of the Kimberley coast are pendants of pearl shell elaborately decorated with incised de- signs, the furrows of which are rubbed with red or black pigment to give a vivid contrast to the natural luster of the shell. There seems to be no reason for regarding this appearance as other than indigenous. Un- decorated pearl shell ornaments are found variously in northern Australia, hence the Kimberley specimens differ principally in that they are profusely decorated. The designs employed are widespread in the Kimberley area, inland as well as coastal, and are associated with various other objects. Since pearl shells are particularly abundant in the Broome region, one of the famous commercial pearl shell centers of the world, it should not be considered surprising that local aborigines evinced an interest in this beautiful material and applied local designs to it. Any theory that foreigners introduced the appreciation of the obviously striking qualities of this material cannot be given credence without tangible supporting evidence. For further discussion and illustrations see Davidson, 1937 A. Stone artifacts of phallic shape. In the northwestern area in general</page><page sequence="9">Northwestern Australia 69 western coast. Of those which seem to be of non-Australian origin, the Cape York Peninsula is consistently indicated as the point of entry. Those which apparently are of Australian origin seem to be still lacking in several coastal districts in the northwestern several stone artifacts of phallic shape have been collected. Mjoberg, p. 86 f., describes three specimens. Other examples are in the Western Australian Museum. Characterized by a completely polished surface, these nicely made objects stand forth in decided contrast to the partially polished stone axes of this region, the only major class of stone artifacts to which the polishing technique is locally applied. At first glance the superior quality of workmanship shown in the phallic stones and the fact that they seem to be restricted to the Northwest might induce one to suspect a non-Australian character. However, when the various available facts are taken into consideration it seems quite clear that these objects represent an indigenous development in the Kimberley area. First, their manufacture is reported for the Upper Levarynga district, although this fact does not prove that they are indigenous in concept. However, most examples are characterized by subincision which in its most extreme application is performed by slitting the penis from the meatus to the scrotum to lay open the urethra. This operation is a widespread initiatory rite in Australia but is lacking in the East Indies. From a technical point of view it should be noted that since partially ground stone axes in the Kimberley appear to be the results of a relatively recent diffusion from North Australia, it would seem that the phallomorphs may represent a very recent local elaboration in stone working, the antiquity of which cannot be greater than that of the introduction of the polishing technique. Thus, although satisfactory information is not available there are sug- gestions that these objects may have been developed even within historic times, in which case the question of foreign derivation would not arise. It is not known whether they occur archaeologically. However if it could be shown that specimens from stratigraphically lower deposits lacked subincision or preceded partially ground stone axes the question of non- Australian origin would need to be reconsidered. Stone spearheads manufactured by pressure flaking. Also confined to the Kimberley area is the manufacture of stone spearheads by a pressure flaking technique, although as the result of trade the distribution of use of these spearheads is much more extensive. Since the archaeology of this region is unknown, we can say nothing about the antiquity of this class of object or the possibility that the pressure flaking technique was previously associated with some other type of artifact such as adze points. On the basis of present evidence the Kimberley type spearhead seems to be manufactured only by inland tribes who barter their product to sur- rounding areas. The development appears to be quite recent and unless subsequent archaeological investigation demonstrates older appearances in the coastal country, we will have no alternative to considering the industry as of local origin.

Davidson regions and to have diffused from interior areas to those coastal localities in which they are found.8 At the present time the only specific evidence which indicates contact between the natives of the northwestern coastal districts and non-Australian visitors consists of three examples of highly and completely polished chisels which have been collected in three widely separated localities in Western Australia (Malcolm, Warrawoona, and Yandil Station).9 Beautifully executed in gabbro and green- stone, these three odd specimens, which differ considerably in size and shape, do not conform even remotely with any type of artifact now known from any other part of the continent. Equally strange is their appearance in regions where partially ground stone axes seem to be lacking or to be of very recent introduction. The nearest class of objects with which the specimens can be compared, although there are numerous differences in details, are the stone axes de- scribed by ileine-Geldern for the East Indies and southeastern Asia. It is important to note that at the moment we know of only these three specimens from widely separated localities. We have no definite evidence to show that any of the three was made in the locality where found or indeed that the specimens are even Austral- ian in manufacture. We have no information to suggest whether these artifacts are employed by the aborigines and integrated in local culture or are merely " curios " which came to the areas where found as the result of barter with other tribes. If these specimens represent classes of objects made and used by Australian tribes, it is very strange, indeed, that other specimens have not come to light. For the moment, therefore, it seems desirable to regard these three specimens as apparently of non-Australian origin and to con- sider the East Indies as a likely place of manufacture. Such a derivation, however, by no means permits us to assume that they came to Australia in prehistoric times. With modern vessels con- stantly plying between the northern ports of Western Australia and the Orient it is possible that these objects were secured as curios in the East Indies and traded to the aborigines by sailors in recent years and that they eventually were passed on from tribe to tribe 8 For discussions on the diffusions of various Australian traits see the papers by the author on special subjects, as listed in the Bibliography to this paper.

On the other hand it would also be plausible to suspect that they may have found their way to Western Australia by similar agencies in prehistoric times if it could be shown that Malays or others actually came to the area between Northwest Cape and Broome in that period. It is to be hoped archaeological investigation will throw some light on this interesting problem. Taking all facts and factors into consideration it must be recog- nized that we have as yet no specific reason to demonstrate that non-Australians have ever settled in the northwestern portions of Australia or exerted any noticeable cultural influence upon the aborigines of this region. At the same time we cannot deny that there may have been occasional visitors, especially within the past few centuries, although that is still sheer conjecture. Our data certainly are most emphatic in denying that any major aspect of culture came to the continent in this region, and at the moment we have found no reason to believe that even minor culture traits of local provenience in the northwest are to be attributed to foreign visitors. In all instances we have noted that an indigenous origin is either definitely suggested or indicated as more plausible than a foreign derivation on the basis of the facts at hand. The only tangible suggestions of non-Australian derivations in culture are the three odd stone chisels. If it could be determined that they were made in Australia and are representative of a great class of objects, the question of foreign influences in industry would be of prime interest. At the moment they cannot be ascribed to any intensive foreign influence in culture, but at most can be attributed to chance foreign contacts, historic or prehistoric as the case may be. THE MALAYS IN NORTH AUSTRALIA By way of contrast to the situation in Western Australia where, as we have seen, there is no satisfactory evidence of foreign influences, let us turn to North Australia, formerly known as the Northern Territory, where Malays are known to have visited. When Sir Matthew Flinders, the first European to explore the coasts of this region, arrived in 1802, he found Malays from Timor Laut or their camp sites in what are now the Wellesley Islands, Pellew Islands, Arnhem Land and the English Company Islands.'0 Moti- 10 Flinders, II, p. 172 et seq.</page><page sequence="12">72 D. S. Davidson vated by the desire to secure local products such as trepang, sandal wood, and pearl shell, which were traded westward to reach eventually the Chinese market, these sailors and entrepreneurs came to North Australia annually, remained for several months, and then returned to their homes. The influences of these Malay traders upon the aborigines of northeastern North Australia have been well described by Warner. Coming as annual traders they did not establish any permanent settlements and apparently never brought their own women. Although such a situation would ordinarily imply that the visitors would seek temporary alliances with native women, these seem to have been very seldom the case. Not only are the tribes in this area extremely pugnacious in questions regarding their women, but it seems that the Malays themselves recognized that amicable and profitable business relations with the aborigines were impossible if the hostility of the latter was aroused. In spite of the fact that some miscegenation took place, it is interesting and important to note that out of several hundreds of Murngin natives Warner in 1929 found only two individuals who showed any definite traces of Malay ancestry. For Groote Eylandt on the other hand Tindale found evidence of Malay paternity somewhat more pronounced. Malay influences in aboriginal culture for the most part seem to have been extremely weak. Many of their introductions were trade goods which, since they could not be produced locally, were at best of temporary character. Such goods include molasses, tobacco (although natives, at least in recent times, are acquainted with various wild native tobaccos), cloth for sarongs and belts. Of some- what more lasting value were knives and tomahawks. There are a few traits, however, which have become integrated in Murngin culture. These include the dugout canoe (with mast and pandanus sail), the Malay type of pipe, cutting of the beard in Van Dyke fashion and an appreciation of metals (nails for fish- hooks, etc). The pods of the Malay tamarind trees which grow wild around old Malay camps now furnish the aborigines an addi- tional source of food. In social culture Malay influences are even less marked but nevertheless are discernible. Many, but by no means all, males in the coastal tribes speak a pidgin Malay; many personal and place names are of Malay origin; the aborigines now perform a mast-</page><page sequence="13">Northwestern Australia 73 raising ceremony similar to part of the Malay ceremony of the same type; a mourning ceremony is of Malay derivation; and there are various additional fragmentary traits such as folk tales and the like. This summary of Malay influences in northeastern Arnhem Land is instructive in several respects. This region is known to have been visited by Malays annually for about a century. The relations between the Malays and the aborigines seem to have been fairly amicable. Yet the cultural influences of the former on the whole are quite negligible and are confined entirely to the coastal tribes. At the same time we must recognize that there is no confusion in differentiating the Malay elements from the aborginal. Both can be clearly ascertained. Although the Malays undoubtedly explored along the northern coasts in search of natural resources suited to their trading interests, it appears that they found no area which compared favorably with northeastern Arnhem Land and Groote Eylandt. At least we have no data at present to show that they returned annually, or at any time in large numbers, to other parts of the northern coasts. How far east and west of Arnhem Land they explored or occasionally visited cannot be stated, but it appears that the farther from Arnhem Land, either east or west, the less are the indications of their former presence. For instance, it is known that they visited Melville and Bathurst Islands but their influences there were few. Their relations with the natives of these islands apparently were never friendly, which fact may partly account for the lack of prominent influences in this area; nevertheless, it is possible if not probable that these islands were not far from the western geo- graphical limits of the Australian coast as known to the Malays who came to Arnhem Land. Although the inhabitants of Melville and Bathurst Islands were acquainted with tomahawks when the Europeans arrived,:" it is important to note that even in recent years the dugout canoe has not succeeded in replacing the aboriginal bark canoe at Melville Island, whereas on Bathurst Island dugouts were extremely uncommon as late as 1911.12 Since dugouts in 1837 were not known west of Clarence Strait, which separates these islands from the mainland, but since that time have diffused 600 miles westward as the result of aboriginal and not Malay activities, it may be that the use of dugouts on Melville Island is as much if 11 King, I, pp. 111, 121. 12 Basedow, pp. 303-305.</page><page sequence="14">74 D. S. Davidson not more the result of recent influences from the aborigines of the mainland than the result of Malay contacts. In other words it seems clear that certain elements of Malay culture which have become integrated in aboriginal culture in Arnhem Land seem to have spread to many localities which Malays are not known to have visited, as well as to various places where Malay visits were infre- quent or of minor significance. It cannot be doubted that some Malays may have journeyed westward perhaps as far as Cambridge Gulf, but we have no evidence to show that they went farther. Certainly it would seem that they did not reach the western Kimberley coast, for in view of their great interest in pearl shell we would expect to find them in even greater numbers there than in Arnhem Land if they had ever chanced to reach the former locality. That Arnheim Land was the general center of Malay activities in North Australia, rather than just one of several regions of temporary occupation, seems also indicated by the natural factors which governed their voyages. The northwest monsoon in the Timor Laut region blows directly to Arnhem Land and according to statements given to Flinders it was this wind which in driving one of their prows across the Arafuru Sea had led to the discovery of North Australia. Apparently they followed the same route each year and voyaged east and west along the coast from an Arnhem Land base. The beginning of the Malay excursions to North Australia, according to one of the chiefs, Pobassoo by name, met by Flinders, was about 1780. This informant, who commanded six prows, had made six or seven voyages to Australia and claimed to have been one of the first to come. How truthful his statement may be we have no satisfactory means of determining. That Malays may have been acquainted with northern Australia in earlier times would not be surprising since they were able navigators in the East Indies. At the same time it must be recognized that the islands with which they were acquainted in home waters are quite close together, that they seldom were required to cover distances out of sight of land equal to that from Timor Laut to Arnhem Land, and that such distances represented short cuts between islands well known to them, which they probably had formerly visited by more circuitous but safer coastwise voyaging. We have no evidence to indicate that</page><page sequence="15">'ig. 1. Jade statue found in Darwin, North Australia, in 1879 during excavations for a road (from Worsuop). Hei-ht-about 41/. in.</page><page sequence="16">Northwestern Australia 75 the Malays sailed very far eastward along the southern coast of New Guinea which was within easy reach from Timor Laut; hence it seems not incredible that the Malays may not have known of any lands southeast of Timor Laut until relatively recent times. Per- haps Pobassoo was in error in attributing the Malay discovery of Arnhem Land to about 1780. On the other hand we have no reason to believe that the development of Malay trade and influences in North Australia requires the allowance of a greater time period. Certainly at the moment we have no evidence which would lead us to assume that the Malays had any interest in, or that they even knew of, Australia many generations before Flinders' time. Nor have we any satisfactory proof as yet to demonstrate that any other non-Australian people visited North Australia in pre-European times. If such visits took place, the evidence for them either has not been presented or is insufficient for this conclusion. Of particular interest in this respect is a small Chinese jade statue found in Darwin, North Australia, in 1879, during excava- tion for a road (Fig. 1). Reported as coming from a depth of about four feet in the roots of a large banyan tree 13 it would seem at first glance that it could not have been lost by Chinese laborers who had been brought to the region in 1874. On the other hand since the excavators apparently had no training or experience in archaeology they probably would have been unable to recognize a cache if for some unknown reason the object had been secreted in the soil beneath the tree at some time between 1874 and 1879. The likelihood that the object may have been cached seems enhanced by the fact that no other artifacts were found with it, nor were any evidences of occupational debris reported. The statue itself throws no light on the question of its presence in North Australia or of its antiquity there. In so far as it is possible to draw conclusions solely from examining a photograph, the discernible features suggest that it belongs to either the late T'ang or early Sung dynasty,'4 that is at the earliest late in the 9th century or at the latest early in the 11th century of the Chris- tian era.

Examination of the specimen probably would permit a more accurate determination of the period of manufacture.</page><page sequence="17">76 D. S. Davidson How it reached Australia is the problem. There seem to be only three reasonable hypotheses; that it was brought either by (1) sailors of unknown but non-Malay nationality, (2) Malays who visited North Australia during the eighteenth and ninteenth cen- turies (or earlier), or (3) the Chinese laborers who arrived in Darwin in 1874. At the present time there is no evidence to indicate that Chinese or other non-Malay sailors ever reached North Australia in pre- historic times. Indeed it has not been established that the Chinese had any direct knowledge of Timor until recent centuries, although they probably knew of it by name in the 13th century and possibly in the 12th century. Before this period, it appears that Chinese junks seldom sailed east of Java, Borneo, and the Philippine Islands, and for later times it seems not unlikely that visits to such distant islands as Timor were never more than casual.'5 For 'r I am indebted to Dr. H. Y. Feng for information from old Chinese sources on this point. It is interesting to note that the Chinese apparently knew of Java early in the middle of the 3rd century, AD., under the name of Chu-pu although the earliest authentic account of the island seems to be that of Fahsien (5th century) who used the Sanskrit name of Yeh-p'o-t'i (Yavadvipa). Shb-po also was employed for Java in 433 and 435 A. D. when Javanese visited the Chinese court. There is no information to sug- gest that the Chinese were directly acquainted with the islands east of Java at this time. In the Lin-wai-tai-t'a (answers to queries about Canton and the countries beyond, by Chou Chfi-fu, 11th century) is mention of a kingdom of women east of Java where the ocean flows downward and, still further to the East, of the island of Wei-li, the end of the habitable world. The remarks about these localities are fanciful and suggest that the Chinese secured their information by hearsay. The account relates of savage cannibal robbers known as Ma-lo-nu southeast of Java. The earliest mention of Borneo, Po-ni (probably North Borneo), seems to be in the 9th century book of Man-shu, Book of Barbarians, by Fang-cho, although direct or indirect Chinese influences undoubtedly had reached this island long before this time. A suggestion that the Chinese may have known of Timor during the 12th century is found in Chu-fan-ch'ih (Accounts of various foreign peoples, by Chao Ju-kua) in the mention of Ti-mbn. The identification is not quite certain, for Ti-m6n is said to be near P'o-ni (Borneo). However, Timor was definitely known during the Ming period (1368-1628) by the names of Chi-mbn and Ki-li-ti-miin and was considered as a dependency of Java. There seem to be no satisfactory data to indicate that Chinese junks visited Timor during the 12th and 13th centuries and no direct evidence to suggest that any direct contacts in the immediately succeeding centuries were ever</page><page sequence="18">Northwestern Australia 77 instance, even in Flinders' time (1802-1803), as already noted, the Chinese seem seldom to have sailed east of Macassar where the Malay traders met them. However, even though they occasionally may have visited Timor there is no reason at present for suspecting that they ventured further east. Thus it would seem unlikely that they could have brought the statue to North Australia in pre- European times. That the Malays may have been responsible for the appearance of the statue in North Australia can be admitted as a possibility although there is no satisfactory supporting evidence and certain considerations oppose this hypothesis. In the first place they ap- parently did not frequent the Darwin region, although they prob- ably visited there at various times. In Arnhem Land where the Malay camps were concentrated no Chinese objects of any descrip- tion have been found. Certainly the odds are very great against the probability that the one object of Chinese derivation which has come to light would have been lost or buried only at a place infre- quently visited. However, if we could assume that the Malays are responsible for the appearance of the statue in North Australia, the available evidence would suggest that they brought it in a rela- tively recent period. As already pointed out there seem to have been few direct contacts between Timor and China until relatively recent centuries. If we should think that the statue has been traded from group to group in the East Indies, it would seem necessary to allow at least a few centuries for it to reach Timor or other nearby islands. Thus it probably could not have reached Timor by such indirect agencies at the very earliest before the 14th or 15th cen- turies. This likelihood, coupled with the apparently relatively recent voyages of Malays to North Australia, would seem to indicate that the date of arrival in North Australia was probably quite late. The possibility that the modern Chinese in Darwin are responsible for the statue must not be underestimated. Whether nineteenth century migrating Chinese laborers would be likely to possess a statue seven or more centuries old cannot be profitably discussed. Surely the possession of an old Chinese statue by modern Chinese more than casual. F. Hirth and W. S. Rockhill, who translated Chu-fan- ch'ih (12th century), St. Petersburg, 1911, p. 157, believe Si-lung refers to Serang and Ceram but this opinion has not yet been substantiated by other evidence.</page><page sequence="19">78 D. S. Davidson seems more likely than the possession of such an object by natives of Timor or some other distant region. The very fact that the statue came to light in a settlement already containing several hundred Chinese undoubtedly may impress many individuals as hardly a coincidence. However, if it could be shown that Chinese objects of a kindred type or of similar antiquity are not infrequently found in the eastern islands of the East Indies, the possibility that the Malays brought the statue to the Darwin area would be con- siderably increased. But even so, such a possibility would not neces- sarily indicate that it has reposed in Australian soil since much before the arrival of European explorers in this region. CONCLUSIONS On the basis of evidence available at the present time the question of foreign influences on the northwestern coast of Australia can be summarized as follows: 1. The theory that the Australians originally came to Australia via the north-western coast not only cannot be supported by any direct or indirect evidence but all considerations vigorously oppose such a possibility. 2. There is no satisfactory evidence to indicate that any major trait in Australian culture was introduced via the northwestern coast. 3. There is no evidence to demonstrate that any minor culture trait localized in the northwest is of non-Australian derivation, nor have any reasons been presented to warrant the supposition that the character of any local trait necessarily suggests a foreign origin, although it is to be admitted that conclusive proof of the indigenous origin of certain traits has not been clearly established. 4. There are no data to indicate that Malays or any other peoples to the west regularly visited any part of Australia much before the end of the 18th century. If Australia was visited by them in earlier times we are led to believe that such visits apparently were quite casual and infrequent. At least we have no evidence to indicate any perceptible foreign influence on Australian race or culture prior to the latter half of the 18th century. 5. The only satisfactory evidence of foreign visitors to the north- west coast are three stone chisels which presumably come from the</page><page sequence="20">Northwestern Australia 79 East Indies but we have no facts at hand which establish a likely date of introduction and at the moment it seems no more likely that they came in prehistoric times than within the last century. 6. The only satisfactory explanations for the presence of the small Chinese jade statue found archaeologically in Darwin in 1879 are that it was brought by Chinese migrants in 1874 and buried by them, or that it came in the custody of Malays who had secured it by trade and who buried it or lost it on some visit in relatively recent times.
