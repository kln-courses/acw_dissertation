<plain_text><page sequence="1">ALAN BEWELL Keats's "Realm of Flora" An obvious feature of Keats 's poetry that has often been noted, both by his contemporaries and modern critics, but has not been adequately studied, is his extensive use of floral imagery. It is hard to miss in the early poetry, the Poems of 1817 and Endymion, where poetry is likened to a luxurious bower where the poet can feed at leisure on floral pleasure. In "On Sleep and Poetry," Keats's early poetic manifesto, the "realm of Flora" is depicted as a space of poetic beginnings, one that must be passed if he is to write a greater poetry that deals with "the agonies, the strife / Of human hearts" (124-25). This description has often been used as a template for understanding Keats's progress as a poet. We speak of the unrestrained floral imagery run riot of Endymion and of the Spenserean "budding" ephebe giving way to the "more naked and grecian Manner" of "Hyperion" and the controlled ambiguities of the Odes.1 And with this shift, a poetry of flowers gives way to a verse influenced by Milton, Shakespeare, and Dante. We speak of a passive, weak, poetry of sensual excess?viewed as "effeminate" by Keats's con temporaries?as being displaced by a more serious, more masculine, philosophical poetry that seeks to master literary traditions. As adoles cent sexual fantasy gives way to mature poetic desire, the decorative and ephemeral floral imagery of pastoral is superseded by the authority of monumental verse. This perspective on the role of flowers in Keats's poetry has two major related weaknesses. The first is that Keats's later poetry does not so much move beyond floral symbolism as use it differently. Keats shows a deepening, more ambivalent, understanding of how the "realm of Flora" can be used to speak about human suffering, division, and loss. In The Eve of St. Agnes, Porphyro's stratagem for escaping the dangerous ascetic fictions of medieval romance and, at the same time, gaining access to Madeline, appears "sudden . . . like a full-blown rose / Flushing his brow" (136-37).

And even in this poem, in the copy Keats sent to his brother and sister-in-law, he falls back upon the floral style of Endymion, apostrophizing Psyche as being "O Bloomiest! though too late for antique vows" (Letters 2: 107; my italics). In the abandoned bower of The Fall of Hyperion, the floral Underworld of "Ode to a Nightingale," the pastoral scenes of Lamia, or the "mellow fruitfulness" of "To Autumn," Keats continues to use floral imagery almost as frequently as in his earlier poetry. Yet what he says through flowers changes. Our lack of an understanding of the nature of this change leads me to my second point: we do not understand this change because we do not understand, with any historical accuracy, what it meant for a male poet, during the Regency period, to write poetry in which floral imagery functions as the main discursive component. Most critics vaguely recognize the traditional association between flowers, poetry, sex, and women. What has not been adequately understood, however, are the specific ways in which Keats draws upon these ana logues and the ways in which his floral style reflects his changing con ception of his sexual and poetic identity. As many of his contemporaries recognized, Keats's use of floral im agery is quite different in its sources and character from Wordsworth's. There can be little doubt that he wished to be regarded as a "poet of nature," in the tradition of Wordsworth. His close friend J. H. Reynolds, in a review of the Poems of 1817, attempts to establish this link when, after extolling the verse, he argues that "this youthful poet appears to have tuned his voice in solitude.?to have sung from the pure inspiration of nature."2 Keats may have wished to "tune his voice in solitudes," but he did not Uve in the Lake District. And, except for the Northern England and Scotland excursion with Charles Brown from June to August 1818, Keats's poetry was written either in London and Hamp stead or at various popular holiday resorts, such as Margate, the Isle of Wight, Burford Bridge, and Winchester. Keats was quite different from the first-generation romantic poets, because he was a poet of the suburbs, a member, as Byron deprecatingly remarked, of the "Suburban School" of poets. "He took the wrong line as a poet," writes Byron in another letter, "and was spoilt by Cockneyfying and Surburbing [sic]."3 Whereas Wordsworth's plant imagery reflects a daily contact with nature and 2.

Fur thermore, Keats very much belongs to an incipient Victorian culture. Keats and his circle, like their Victorian counterparts, saw botany and gardening as hobbies, as being intrinsically linked to pleasure and the leisure-time escape from the demands of city life. Charles Cowden Clark, his childhood friend, later wrote a children's book entitled Adam, The Gardener (1834), and Clarke's brother-in-law, John Towers, whom Keats knew, wrote The Domestic Gardener's Manual (1830).4 Leigh Hunt was also interested in botany. His sister-in-law, the botanist Elizabeth Kent, lived with him in Hampstead. Her Flora Domestica, or the Portable Flower Garden (1823) and Sylvan Sketches: or a Companion to the Park and Shrubbery (1825) were both published by Taylor and Hessey, who were also Keats's and John Clare's publishers.5 In Keats's poetry, one can see the beginning of what was to become, in Lynn Barber's words, the "heyday of natural history," as middle-class Victorians combed the En glish countryside looking for plants. In The Victorian Fern Craze (1969), David Elliston Allen describes how, at the height of this plant mania, the popular craze for plants literally transformed the English landscape (along with many colonial landscapes) as whole species of plants dis appeared under the onslaught of weekend botanists and gardeners.6 Whereas the eighteenth century was the great age of nature produced, the nineteenth century was the great age of nature commercialized. It saw the emergence of an enormous project of textualizing nature, as the urban middle-class bought anything?from books, to dishes, to wall paper?that had a flower on it, a flower in it, or a flower pressed between its leaves.7 Like his contemporaries, Keats linked excursions into nature with collecting. At the end of Endymion, the hero, who has frequently been identified with Keats, calls himself "a lord / Of flowers, garlands, love-knots, silly posies, / Groves, meadows, melodies, and arbour roses" (IV-937~39), thus linking poetry, in the anagrammatic pun on "poesis" in "posies," not only to botany, but also to the kind of use made of flowers?"garlands, love-knots, silly posies"?that we have come to 4- See Stuart M.

As Donald Goellnicht has insightfully shown, Keats displays an extensive knowledge of botany in his poetry, derived from his education as an apothecary at Guy's Hospital (see Goellnicht 84-119). An equally im portant force shaping his floral rhetoric is his participation in the pro duction of a nascent Victorian culture of flowers, in which floral imagery was produced for an urban public, who saw flowers as eminently aes thetic and decorative objects, linked to leisure, recreation, wealth, and a nature that was no longer a part of everyday life. Flowers had become preeminently marketable and collectable?they were produced to be consumed. Keats directly links poetry and flowers when he argues that "the Lovers of Poetry like to have a little Region to wander in where they may pick and choose, and in which the images are so numerous that many are forgotten and found new in a second Reading" (Letters 1: 170). Two points are worth making here. The first is that Keats understands a poem as being a textual equivalent to a garden, as it offers its readers a luxurious abundance of images from which to "pick and choose" and to which they can return repeatedly, finding new images on each return. The second is that Keats is here describing not only how readers should read his poetry, but how he himself read other poets. The early Keats, especially, read poetry with the eye of a poet-nurseryman, someone who makes it his business to find, produce, and sell flowers?the flowers found either in nature or in literary texts. Here we see a quite radical difference between Keats's and Words worth's understanding of a poem. Whereas Wordsworth viewed it as a representation of human beings and their relationship to their environ ments, Keats sees nature as something that is purposefully gathered, planted, and arranged for display and pleasure. It is a social product. From this perspective, Keats's poetry is actually much closer to Erasmus Darwin's botanical verse in The Loves of the Plants than it is to Words worth's Michael. In the "Ode to Psyche," Keats provides an allegory of the genesis of "nature" in his poems. There, he celebrates not only love, but also the power of "the gardener Fancy" (62)?the poet as horticul turalist?to build a garden "in some untrodden region of my mind" 8. Some of Keats's early poetry was copied by thirteen-year-old Mary Strange Mathew into an album of poetic effusions entitled The Garland (Robert Gittings, fohn Keats [1968; Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1971] 76).</page><page sequence="5">KEATS'S "REALM OF FLORA" 75 (51). Starting with Wordsworth's nature?"Far, far around shall those dark-cluster'd trees / Fledge the wild-ridged mountains steep by steep" (54?55)?Keats landscapes it, populating this wild setting with the fa miliar figures of Keatsean imagination, with "zephyrs, streams, and birds . . . bees" and "moss-lain Dryads" (56-57). Having turned Words worth's nature into a garden or park, Keats then constructs, "in the midst of this wide quietness"?that is, the textual space opened within his own revisioning psyche?a "rosy sanctuary" with "the wreath'd trellis of a working brain" (58-60). To underscore the fact that this garden is a textual product, rather than a representation of nature, Keats insists that the flowers to be found there are not like those in common gardens because they are all botanical hybrids: they "never breed the same." Where Wordsworth would have emphasized "common nature," Keats is concerned with nature as a product of art and labor. The garden, as a place where nature meets culture and is socially transformed, is an appropriate symbol for Keats's understanding of poetry. Gardens are also expressions of power, of "nature controlled to human satisfaction, " whether it be the power to dominate and transform nature (as in the formal gardens of Europe) or to utilize nature by working out relationships of cooperation and accommodation (as in the landscape gardens of the English gentry or the cottage garden).9 Equally importantly, gardens have always served as the insignia of social class and status. In "Ode to Psyche" and the previously cited "little region" passage, Keats represents the poem as being analogous to a pleasure garden, a landscape-garden, or botanic garden, the terms not being mutually exclusive. One of the more obvious features of these gardens is that they were produced by and for the leisured classes; they were embodiments of social status and power. Janet Browne, in her excellent discussion of Erasmus Darwin's The Loves of the Plants, notes that For Darwin, as for other members of the intellectual leisured classes, reference to a botanic garden evoked a constellation of ideas and emotions that combined scientific purpose with recreational plea sure. Gardens glorified both the practical expertise of horticultur alists and the serious activities of taxonomists and medical person nel. National pride was reflected in the breadth and variety of such collections, each plant representing geographical explorations in the past and the nation's political allegiances and commercial intentions. 9- Robert B.

Hester, Jr. (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1990) 5</page><page sequence="6">76 ALAN BEWELL Gardens were also obvious repositories of "nature," a display of plants outside their usual geographic boundaries conjuring up no tions of an untrammeled, fecund world.10 Over the course of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, a powerful association was thus forged between gardens, leisure, geographical ex ploration, and commerce. In fact, especially in the case of Cooke's first voyage, exploration was as much driven by the search for plants as for gold.11 That Keats conceives of his poetry as a textualized version of such gardens suggests, then, a form of social aspiration. To Keats, the long poem was equivalent to a landscape garden: it was the embodiment of wealth, power, leisure, and the authority associated with them. But such gardens were quite removed from Keats's own world. Though he would have been familiar with botanic gardens from his medical training, and though he may have visited some of the many private botanic gardens in the London area, Keats probably had little immediate familiarity with the landscape gardens maintained by the gentry, which were difficult to gain entry into. What Keats did know a good deal about was "town gardening," the gardens that had become popular with the rising urban middle-class. Such gardening was done on a small scale, because land in urban areas had become quite expensive over the course of the eighteenth century. On April 12, 1819, when Keats was living at Wentworth Place, he wrote to his sister Fanny, declaring that "I ordered some bulbous roots for you at the Gardeners, and they sent me some, but they were all in bud?and could not be sent, so I put them in our Garden There are some beautiful heaths now in bloom in Pots?either heaths or some seasonable plants I will send you instead? perhaps some that are not yet in bloom that you may see them come out" (Letters 2: 51). Here we see a poet who frequents local nurseries, businesses that had become increasingly prominent over the previous fifty years and were about to become a familiar part of the urban landscape.12 Three weeks later, Keats writes to Fanny that he plans to io.

(Letters 2: 56). Keats's mention of "some beautiful heaths now in bloom in Pots" should remind us that the early nineteenth century saw the full-scale emergence of container gardening. One of the best-known authorities on this subject was, in fact, Elizabeth Kent, whose Flora Domestica, or the Portable Flower Garden (1823) set out to supply "such information as should be requisite for the rearing and preserving a portable garden in pots."13 In her preface, Kent observes that people "condemned to a town life" frequently lack a portion of ground in which to cultivate a garden, so a "portable garden" can serve as a substitute (Kent xxxii-xxxiii). She quotes The Task, where Cowper observes that these gardens indicate that man still retains His inborn, inextinguishable thirst Of rural scenes, compensating his loss By supplemental shifts, the best he may. (iv. 766-69) A problem that emerges when one recognizes that flowers in Keats's poetry are primarily cultural products or "supplemental shifts," part of the burgeoning Victorian commerce in flowers, rather than, as in Words worth, elements drawn from nature, is that it is often difficult to know whether Keats's floral imagery derives from natural observation or from textual sources, such as book illustrations, botanical prints and engrav ings, literary sources (notably Spenser, Dray ton, Milton, Wordsworth, and Hunt), botany manuals, or the increasing use of plants in the textile and decorative arts. As Geoffrey Hartman has noted, rarely do we look on a Keatsean landscape without feeling that, to some degree, we are seeing it artistically framed.14 Even when, for instance, Keats does speak of observing nature, he generally does so with a view to reproducing it in textual form. Writing from Dean Street to Joseph Severn, Keats declares that "all the Week" he has been particularly looking forward to Saturday because he "want[s] to look into some beautiful Scenery?for poetical purposes" (Letters 1: 115). The phrasing "look into" makes this weekend outing in nature sound much more akin to finding nature in a 13.

And the language of "poetical purposes" is that of the poet /nurseryman, who reads a text not only for pleasure, but also for gain. When, in Sleep and Poetry, Keats imagines himself being enticed by a young woman to journey through almond blossoms and rich cinnamon Till in the bosom of a leafy world We rest in silence, like two gems upcurl'd In the recesses of a pearly shell (118-21) one senses that this "leafy world" is not natural, but textual, its floral elements, like the "spiced dainties" (line 269) that Porphyro offers Made line in "The Eve of St. Agnes," are sights, drawn from exotic bookish regions, to be seen more than eaten. John Gibson Lockhart, in his attack upon the poetry of the "Cockney School of Poetry, " indicates the manner in which the suburbanism of Keats's poetry was perceived by his contemporaries. Though few are likely to agree with Lockhart's biases, his criticism does provide us with access to some of the more distinctive contemporary features of Keats's poetry. He complains that despite the fact that Leigh Hunt and Keats raved about nature, "about 'green fields,' 'jaunty streams,' and 'o'er arching leafiness,'" they do so "exactly as a Cheapside shop-keeper does about the beauties of his box on Camberwell road. " "Mr Hunt, " he writes, "is altogether unacquainted with the face of nature in her mag nificent scenes; he has never seen any mountain higher than Highgate hill, nor reclined by any stream more pastoral than the Serpentine River. But he is determined to be a poet eminently rural, and he rings the changes?till one is sick of him, on the beauties of the different 'high views' which he has taken of God and nature, in the course of some Sunday dinner parties, at which he has assisted in the neighbourhood of London."15 The "Cockney School of Poetry," it seems, had produced a 'Cockney nature,' a floral diction that Lockhart associates with middle class, urban commercial culture, the language of the "Cheapside shop keeper" in speaking of "the beauties of his box on Camberwell road." Cockney poets are small-minded, it would seem, because nature in the suburbs is small. In an article written a year later, Lockhart applies the same criticism to Keats, arguing that he is a little-minded poet who engages in "laborious affected descriptions of flowers seen in window 15- Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine (October 1817): 39.</page><page sequence="9">KEATS'S "REALM OF FLORA" 79 pots, or cascades heard at Vauxhall."16 For Lockhart, if poetry is to be likened to gardening, Keats is not the Capability Brown of romantic verse, but instead a suburban pot-gardener, whose knowledge of land scapes is limited to Vauxhall Gardens. We need not fully agree with Lockhart's claim that there is no nature in Keats's poetry, that it is no more than an urban commodity, to recognize that Keats's poetry characteristically produces a sophisticated and often disturbing dioptric play between nature, culture, and social class. His floral imagery points in two directions: even as flowers em body social aspiration in their metaphoric link to values implicit in the idea of the landscape garden (those of leisure, wealth, and, as will become clear, eroticism), they equally draw attention to themselves as signs or substitutes?"supplemental shifts"?for that world. Flowers never lose their textual and ornamental status, as cultural artifacts on display. But they are inherently contradictory in meaning, as they point both to their origin in worlds that are removed from the aspiring poet and to the suburban commercial world of poet, who values them par ticularly because they give him entry into those worlds.17 A passage from "I stood tip-toe upon a little hill" provides a good example of these stylistic dualisms: For what has made the sage or poet write But the fair paradise of Nature's light? In the calm grandeur of a sober line, We see the waving of the mountain pine; And when a tale is beautifully staid, We feel the safety of a hawthorn glade: When it is moving on luxurious wings, The soul is lost in pleasant smotherings: Fair dewy roses brush against our faces, And flowering laurels spring from diamond vases; O'er head we see the jasmine and sweet briar, And bloomy grapes laughing from green attire; While at our feet, the voice of crystal bubbles Charms us at once away from all our troubles: i6.

The dioptric quality of Keats's verse?its ability to point to the erotic elements it is concealing?is central to Christopher Ricks's excellent study Keats and Embarrassment (Oxford: Clarendon, 1974).

(125-140) Initially, Keats seems to assert the priority of nature as the source of poetic inspiration; it makes "the sage or poet write." With the mention of a "sober line," however, the priority is reversed, as it seems that the "line" produces, almost by the necessities of rhyme, the need for a "mountain pine."18 In the "tale" that is "staid," we see a "hawthorn glade"; the tale "moving on luxurious wings" produces the "pleasant smotherings" of "dewy roses." With the mention of "luxury," flow ering laurels "spring from diamond vases." Here, the dioptric qualities of this verse are clear, for this is a nature that offers us cut flowers. This superimposition of the natural and the artificial carries over from the "diamond" (that is, the 'cut glass') vases, to the "voice of crystal bub bles." Again, one wonders whether Keats is finding nature epitomized in crystal, or whether his luxury-driven imagination is not attempting to find something approaching "crystal" in nature. The echo, in these lines, of the valentine written earlier that year, "Hadst thou liv'd in days of old," confirms that these floral images are less representations of nature, than substitutes for social and erotic desires. Keats describes Mary Frogley's hair as resting in a casque O'er which bend four milky plumes Like the gentle lilly's blooms Springing from a costly vase (53-55) Poetry, nature, gardens, wealth, women: since each, in Keats's poetry, is analogically related to and superimposed upon the others, metaphors drawn from one usually carry the trace of their associative link to the others. The special semantic effects of Keats's verse lie in this carryover of meaning, not as a symbolic accumulation, but instead in the slight disjunction, dislocation, or skewing of the image that such carryovers produce. Looking at nature or flowers through Keats's eyes, we begin to see a woman; the desire for nature and to be a 'poet of nature' fuses with erotic desire and masculine authority: his bees "wrestle" with flowers, his heroes sleep with nature, his eye ranges among flowers in a desire to possess them. "A dimpled hand" hangs from Calidore's 18. John Wilson Croker, in his criticism of Endymion, went so far as to claim that Keats was "amusing himself and wearying his readers with an immeasurable game at Bouts rim?s" (Quarterly Review 19 [1818]: 205-6).</page><page sequence="11">KEATS'S "REALM OF FLORA" 81 shoulder like "the drooping flowers / Of whitest cassia" and is "fondled" by his "happy cheek" ("Calidore" 95-97); nature becomes a "swelling leafiness" ("Calidore" 34); a woman's "honied voice" ("Hadst thou liv'd" 24) is implicitly likened to the nectary in the "throat" of a flower, a throat of "bubbling honey" ("Lamia" 1.65); the "graceful bends" of a woman's "dark hair" become "leaves of hellebore" ("Hadst thou liv'd" 13-15); a bee "buzz[es] round two swelling peaches" ("Calidore" 66); and Zephyr, "ere Phoebus mounts the firmament, / Fondles the flower amid the sobbing rain" (Endymion 1.330-31; my italics). Yet desire stems from want or absence, so even as Keats seeks to fuse an analogical link between poetry, nature, gardens, and women in a poetry equivalent to a "Store / Of luxuries" ("Sleep and Poetry" 346-47), his poetry also points to the fact that he stands outside of or distant from these ideali zations. Each can be mutually substitutable, because each is but a sign of aspiration and desire. Once one recognizes the play of dioptric, anamorphic transformations within Keats's verse, one is in a position to recognize, as did Shelley when he urged Keats to avoid "system and mannerism," that though Keats draws extensively from Wordsworth, he does so as a literary mannerist, his style being much more attuned to the work of Robert Herrick or Andrew Marvell than to other English romantics.19 Keats, in fact, is probably best understood as constituting, with Hunt, the School, not of Cockney Poetry, but of Romantic Mannerism. Reading Keats is an exercise in image collation: as images slide beneath each other, they do not fuse, but instead produce a slight disorder. Natural images are distorted as they are recast as products of urbane Regency London culture, while poetic ornament attempts, disturbingly, to be come nature: "Vermilion-spotted" and "crimson-barr'd" the snake Lamia smiles, but with "a woman's mouth with all its pearls complete" (1.60). This dioptric quality is especially clear in the ways in which Keats juxtaposes sex and botany. Probably the best instance of this is in "Sleep and Poetry": First the realm I'll pass Of Flora, and old Pan: sleep in the grass, Feed upon apples red, and strawberries, And choose each pleasure that my fancy sees; Catch the white-handed nymphs in shady places, 19- The Letters of Percy Bysshe Shelley, ed. Frederick L. Jones, 2 vols. (Oxford: Claren don, 1964) 2: 221.</page><page sequence="12">82 ALAN BEWELL To woo sweet kisses from averted faces,? Play with their fingers, touch their shoulders white Into a pretty shrinking with a bite As hard as lips can make it. (101-9) As Ian Jack has noted, this reflection is occasioned not by nature, but instead by Poussin's painting The Realm of Flora, which Keats saw in Leigh Hunt's study.20 The passage, then, is not describing a poet's perception of a natural scene, but instead his response to an engraving of a mythical world into which he desperately wants ingress. Unlike Poussin, and writers such as Erasmus Darwin and Blake, who saw the "realm of Flora" as a state, not a gender, as a world ruled by a goddess and the pleasures she provided, Keats renews its traditional identification with women. In Rousseau, Erasmus Darwin, or Blake, flowers can be either male or female: in Keats, they are almost exclusively female. Entrance into the realm of flora thus constitutes both a poetic and a sexual act, a point that is allegorized in this passage. Beginning with a blurred distinction between human culture and the world of plants, as the poet enters the scene to sleep in the grass or feed on apples or strawberries, Keats speaks of catching "the white-handed nymphs in shady places." The slight dioptric skewing that I have been suggesting as being characteristic of Keats's mannerist style occurs with "shady places," because we are not sure whether the location that is being referred to is geographical or bodily. And matters are not simplified by the recognition that the word "nymphs," at this time, was also an anatomical term, which Keats would have known from his medical studies, referring to female genital labia. Similarly, when he then imag ines himself biting into "their shoulders white," he reinvokes the pre vious botanical imagery of feeding on apples and strawberries, so that a semantic or metaphoric overlay occurs. Hungry for pleasure, having intensely imagined himself into an erotic world where plants and women are the same?all being daughters of Flora?Keats is not fussy where his next meal comes from. Ovid's idea of myth as a poetic means of linking the human and natural spheres plays a major role in Keats's poetry, especially as meta morphosis provides an interpretive framework for understanding the identity underlying the dioptric skewing of images. "I stood tip-toe," which is Keats's Ovidean manifesto, provides an extended reflection on 20. Ian Jack, Keats and the Mirror of Art (Oxford: Clarendon, 1967) 136-40.</page><page sequence="13">KEATS'S "REALM OF FLORA" 83 the poetic possibilities in the mythological interplay between the floral and the human spheres. The poem opens in the following manner: I stood tip-toe upon a little hill, The air was cooling, and so very still, That the sweet buds which with a modest pride Pull droopingly, in slanting curve aside, Their scantly leaved, and finely tapering stems, Had not yet lost those starry diadems Caught from the early sobbing of the morn. (1-7) A striking feature of this passage is its fusion of an uncommonly deco rative or ornamental style with overt erotic intent. Though superficially, the passage has affinities with the floral personification that one associates with Albert Grandville's Les Fleurs Anim?es,21 it is actually much closer to being a verbal equivalent of The Temple of Flora, a lavishly illustrated coffee-table style of book produced by the botanist Robert Thornton, who taught at the United Hospitals just before Keats began courses there. Even as Thornton's flowers retain their autonomous beauty?and are not personified?, they nevertheless serve as idealized figures of erotic desire.22 In "I stood tip-toe," Keats emphasizes the sexuality of flowers, their "modest pride, " which powerfully links the traditional association of female modesty, innocence, and chastity with "sweet buds" even as it employs the language of sexual freedom (perhaps, too, there is a sense of the Elizabethan meaning of "pride" as sexual desire, especially female heat).23 Keats is interested here less in the scientific understanding of the sexuality of flowers than in the erotic possibilities of overt anthropo morphization; we are asked to project a powerfully amatory image onto these "scantly leaved" sweet buds with their "finely tapering stems." Keats focuses on the ways that plants provide him with an opportunity for sexual my thmaking and for talking about aspects of human life that would not, otherwise, be easily addressed. If the landscape of "I stood tip-toe" is charged with eroticism, it is not by accident; it is the poetry of a speaker who knows that he is deliberately seeing human sexual life in flowers.24 21. J.

In the valentine written to Mary Frogley, Keats draws on the same analogy, only</page><page sequence="14">84 ALAN BEWELL A less successful example of this process can be seen in Keats's de scription of sexual defloration. Having heard how "a spring-head of clear waters," babbles "wildly of its lovely daughters / The spreading blue bells," we are told that this same spring may haply mourn That such fair clusters should be rudely torn From their flesh beds, and scattered thoughtlessly By infant hands, left on the path to die (42-46) The passage is a parody of the kind of moralized reflection on flowers that became popular among women writers during the early part of the nineteenth century. Yet the moral of this tale is not at all clear. Given the homonymie play on "belles," the word "spreading" is vulgar, while the addition of "fresh" to the obvious pun on "beds" is all too graphic. Thus, the analogy between the sexuality of plants and of human beings, basic to this popular form of moralistic tale, provides the generic un derpinnings of this passage, culminating as it does in the image of the fallen flowers "left on the path to die," even as Keats self-consciously subverts this genre. Other examples of the anthropomorphic sexualization of flowers might be noted, for instance, the poet's appeal to "ardent marigolds" to "open afresh your round of starry folds" (47-48). One further example, however, will help clarify the ways in which Keats's "realm of flora" represents a mannerist reworking of botanical analogy: Here are sweet peas, on tip-toe for a flight: With wings of gentle flush o'er delicate white, And taper fingers catching at all things, To bind them all about with tiny rings. (57-60) Here again one is given an image of an animated nature, as the flowers of the sweet pea, with their lateral petals or "wings," to use the botanical term, seem as if they are about to take flight. The tendrils of the plant, evoking the idealized tapering of women's fingers, are actively sexual and totally impartial in their embraces?"they catch at all things"?yet, like the umodest pride" of the "sweet buds" (3), they are also marriage rather than transforming flowers into women, with "finely tapering stems," he turns Ms. Frogley's legs into "twin water lillies, born / In the coolness of the morn" ("Hadst thou liv'd in days of old" 26-34).</page><page sequence="15">KEATS'S "REALM OF FLORA" 85 minded, bent on binding "all about with tiny rings." The "gentle flush o'er delicate white," at once a color and a feeling, suggests the passion that motivates their embrace. As John Barnard has noted, the passage "means to overleap any concern for conventional verbal decorum in its eager excitement to catch a physical sense of the flower world."25 Donald Goellnicht has observed that the scientific source of the metaphor derives from the fact that the sweet pea belonged to the class of flowers termed "papillionacious," because their "four petals," as Robert Thornton noted, "resemble a butterfly on the wing."26 The passage, then, consti tutes a metaphoric cultivation of the analogy between the flowers of the sweet pea and butterflies "on tip-toe for a flight." Two quite interesting things emerge from this recognition. The first is that what is being described here is truly a sexual embrace, an embrace so close that we cannot distinguish the wings and "taper fingers" of the butterflies from the wing petals and taper tendrils of the sweet pea. The idea of the mutual sexual pleasure of butterfly and flower was a favorite of Keats. In "Sleep and Poetry," he describes "A butterfly, with golden wings broad parted, / Nestling a rose, convuls'd as though it smarted / With over pleasure?" (343-45). Here one cannot tell grammatically whether it is the insect or the rose that is in the state of sexual ecstasy. In a letter, Keats again uses the relationship between insect and flower to develop, in ways similar to eighteenth-century radical botanical writ ing, both an idealized version of what human sexual pleasure can be and a theoretical argument for what constitutes true poetic inspiration: It has been an old Comparison for our urging on?the Bee hive? however it seems to me that we should rather be the flower than the Bee?for it is a false notion that more is gained by receiving than giving?no the receiver and the giver are equal in their bene fits?The fjljower I doubt not receives a fair guerdon from the Bee?its leaves blush deeper in the next spring?and who shall say between Man and Woman which is the most delighted? Now it is more noble to sit like Jove that [than] to fly like Mercury?let us not therefore go hurrying about and collecting honey-bee like buzz ing here and there impatiently from a knowledge of what is to be arrived at: but let us open our leaves like a flower and be passive and receptive?budding patiently under the eye of Apollo and tak ing hints from every noble insect that favours us with a visit?sap 25- John Barnard, John Keats (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1987) 16. 26.

(Letters i: 232) Here, flowers provide Keats with a language for talking about a world where love is freely enjoyed by both sexes?and, by women, perhaps even more than by men. Claiming that poetic authority would be wiser to model itself upon female passion, Keats suggests that Wordsworth's "wise passiveness" should actually be understood as wise receptiveness.27 Keats's willingness to maintain male-female gender distinctions?the male is a bee, the female, a flower?while simultaneously associating "negative capability" with a feminized poetic?is a complex issue to which I will return. For now, it is enough to recognize that the image of the sweet peas, standing "on tip-toe for a flight," constitutes a meta poetic figure for the poet's own pleasure in the text, his relationship to the "flowers of rhetoric" that constitute the poem, for he too is de scribed, at the beginning of the poem, as being "tip-toe upon a little hill." This figurai repetition serves an important purpose, which critics have failed to recognize. It suggests that the poem has an overt mannerist intention in that it is implicitly structured from the point of view of a poet/butterfly, surveying a vast field of flowers, intending before night fall to visit them all. Where Milton represents the poet's inspired flight using the spiritual symbol of the dove, Keats, in a much earthier fashion, consistently portrays the poet's imaginings in terms of the flight of a butterfly/bee, whose honeyed song is the product of his sensual, wres tling play with flowers?that is, with poetic metaphors and metaphor ized women.28 Having, in true mannerist fashion, shrunk the world to 27. For an alternative reading of this passage, see Margaret Homans, "Keats Reading Women, Women Reading Keats" SiR 29 (1990): 341-70. 28. Keats's mannerist revision of Milton, replacing the dove with the butterfly, is indicated in his choice of a passage from Spenser's "Fate of the Butterfly" as an epigraph for the 1817 Poems: "What more felicity can fall to creature, / Than to enjoy delight with liberty." In a letter to Fanny Brawne, dated July 1, 1819, Keats writes, "I almost wish we were butterflies" (Letters 2: 123). Many other examples of Keats's identification of the poet with a bee or butterfly might be noted. For instance, in Endymion, the seasonal progress of the poet's song is linked to the floral activities of bees: "ere yet the bees / Hum about globes of clover and sweet peas, / I must be near the middle of my story" (1.51-53). In The Fall of Hyperion, the poet enters the realm of Saturn after drinking "a cool vessel of transparent juice, / Sipp'd by the wander'd bee" (1.42-43). In the "Ode on Melancholy," pleasure turns "to poison while the bee-mouth sips" (24). And the song of "To Autumn" emerges from the poet's recognition that the songs of summer, like the honey that "o'er brim[s]" the bee's "clammy cells" (11), must give way to a new music, that of the "small gnats" mourning "Among the river sallows" (27-28). The centrality of the language of</page><page sequence="17">KEATS'S "REALM OF FLORA" 87 microscopic proportions, to the world as it appears through the eyes of an insect, Keats delights in the possibility of enjoying a sexual / poetic fantasy acted out on an epic scale. "There was wide wand'ring," he says, "for the greediest eye, / To peer about upon variety; / Far round the horizon's crystal air to skim" (16-18). Likening himself to the winged Mercury, his "thought a pair of little wings" (cancelled lines, Draft, following line 122), he tells us that many pleasures to my vision started; So I straightway began to pluck a posey Of luxuries bright, milky, soft, and rosy. (26-28) In the play on "posey" and "poesy," and Keats's almost complete in ability to see flowers in any way other than in a sexualized manner?as dimorphic figures of women?we see how closely poetry, sex, and botany are linked in this poem. The poet's "honied lines" ("This pleasant tale is like a little copse"), in fact, are the product of such visionary pleasures: "O for three words of honey, that I might / Tell but one wonder of thy bridal night!" (209-10). It is difficult to know what kind of audience Keats envisioned for "I stood tip-toe. " Like Erasmus Darwin's The Loves of the Plants, published as part of his Botanic Garden, the poem would seem to require a sophis ticated and urbane audience, conversant with botany and willing to enter into the play upon the analogy between the sexuality of plants and people. Also like Darwin, Keats is interested in transgressing accepted sexual mores, in pointing to the sexual desire that underlies and shapes the conventions of social life. The poem also has affinities with eigh teenth-century "botanical pornography," a popular form of writing, the most notable of these being James Perry's Mimosa or the Sensitive Plant (J779)? which drew upon the analogy between plants and sexual organs. Most of these works are satires, however, and usually are little more than catalogues of overworked metaphors and puns about bodily parts. In Keats's early poetry, the engagement with flowers is much more intimate, as flowers have become the very language of pleasure: most of the intensity, in fact, in Keats's portrayal of sexuality, derives not from the description of human lovemaking, but of the floral bowers within which this activity takes place. At times, for instance in the flowers in Keats's understanding of his relationship with Fanny Brawne is equally explicit, as in the letter where he declares, "I kiss'd your writing over in the hope you had indulg'd me by leaving a trace of honey" (Letters 2: 127).</page><page sequence="18">88 ALAN BEWELL vegetable striptease of the opening lines of "I stood tip-toe," the poetry even verges on what might be called "botanical voyeurism." The bower of Adonis in Endymion, the "cool-rooted flowers" and "bedded grass" of the bower in "To Psyche," are typical in this regard, as is the bower that Keats describes in his epistle "To George Felton Mathew," where intertwined the cassia's arms unite, With its own drooping buds, but very white; Where on one side are covert branches hung, 'Mong which the nightingales have always sung In leafy quiet: where to pry, aloof, Atween the pillars of the sylvan roof, Would be to find where violet beds were nestling, And where the bee with cowslip bells was wrestling. There must be too a ruin dark, and gloomy, To say 'joy not too much in all that's bloomy.' (43-52) In this poem, the universal sexuality of nature has not yet been my thologized, made into an idealized mirror of human life through Ovidian metamorphosis, yet one nevertheless can recognize the ground from which such sexualized metaphor grows.29 It would be relatively easy to argue that in his early poetry, Keats was writing floral erotica for himself and other men, using flowers as sub stitute textual pleasures. However, this view misses the importance of the fact that, during the opening decades of the nineteenth century, popular botanical literature was primarily the domain of women, a literature being written by women for a female audience.30 One of the reasons why many of Keats's contemporaries, among them Hazlitt, 29- Marilyn Butler places Keats's interest in love and pagan mythology within a context of radical speculation, by people such as Erasmus Darwin, Richard Payne Knight, Shelley, and Peacock, in primitive myth as an expression of early mankind's perception "that the natural world was driven by sex" (Romantics, Revels, and Reactionaries: English Literature and Its Background, 1760-1830 [Oxford: Oxford UP, 1981] 130). 30.

In her introduction, we are given the basic fiction of the book, drawn, like Keats's early poetry, from Ovid and Darwin: Oft, to beguile the sultry hours, In thought I've animated flowers, Enlivening every walk; And though no botanist professed, Their reasoning powers have shrewdly guessed, And longed to hear them talk. (o She tells us how one day in June she pronounced this wish aloud only to be surprised by a female fairy emerging from a pansy. The pixie flies to her ear and in a language previously unknown, speaks the following words: 'Flora,' it murmured, 'grants thy prayer, Long have her treasures been thy care, Receive thy recompense.' This said, she vanished from my sight, And since, with ever new delight, I tend my fragrant hoards; No solitude exists for me, Since every flower and shrub and tree, Society affords. (2) 31. In the conclusion of his essay "On Effeminacy of Character, " Hazlitt cites Keats's poetry as an example of "effeminate style," a style that is "all florid, all fine." Such poetry, he argues, is deficient "in masculine energy of style, " for "all is soft and fleshy, without bone or muscle" (The Complete Works of William Hazlitt, ed. P. P. Howe, 21 vols. [London, 1930-34] 8: 254-55) 32. Mrs. Montolieu, The Enchanted Plants: Fables in Verse, American ed. (New York: David Longworth, 1803).</page><page sequence="20">90 ALAN BEWELL The book consists of a series of poems written on various moral subjects, such as ambition, prejudice, envy, love, and so on, which arise when the author listens in on the conversation of flowers. The poem entitled "Scandal; or the Painted Lady Sweet-Pea" is representative of the book as a whole. It seems that two botanical luxuriants, "Gay Anemone, daughter of Art" and Ranunculus have been gossiping about the sweet pea: 'Look there!' said the fanciful flower, (By whimsical botanists dressed) 'How yon vain youthful plant of an hour, Smiles and flaunts like a beauty professed. Though with us in the garden displayed, Unimproved her corollas remain, Still blushing, unformed, unarrayed, Like cousins who bask on the plain.' (22-23) As a luxuriant, Anemone is a product of botanical "fancy," a horticul tural "whimsy, " and she demeans the "unimproved" features of Sweet Pea. Ranunculus responds by suggesting that this plainness is itself a form of art; he has heard Daffodil assert that the Sweet Pea only pretends to blush: 'And you know on those subjects she's wise, That this innocent paints red and white.' While her exquisite honeyed perfume, For which the bees tease her to death, They found too, and so I presume, Is fictitious ... to cover her breath. (23) Lucky for Sweet Pea, Sweet William is nearby, and he defends her in knightly fashion, attacking the other two flowers by calling them gos siping spinsters, who have been made sterile and deformed by the cultivation of petals at the expense of the organs of generation: Doomed malicious old virgins to fade, Whom multiplied petals deform, While she her soft banner displayed, Soon will shelter her fruit from the storm.</page><page sequence="21">KEATS'S "REALM OF FLORA" 91 The ladies felt something like shame, And indignant, were ready to cry, They e'en vowed no more beauties to blame . . . That is . . . when Sweet William is by. (25) Moralistic and stylized, the poem is hardly equivalent to some of the more complex uses of botanical imagery, such as in Charlotte Smith's Beachy Head. Here, the botanical analogy is being used, as increasingly came to be the case, not in order to call into question gender roles, but instead to reaffirm conventional ideas about the proper role of women in society. Keats, in writing "I stood tip-toe, " was clearly aware of this kind of moralistic writing. At one point, describing the blades of grass carried slowly on the surface of the stream, he alludes to this literature: Why, you might read two sonnets, ere they reach To where the hurrying freshness aye preach A natural sermon o'er their pebbly beds. (69-71) Here, rather than simply alluding to William Paley, Keats is ironically citing those moralistic sonnets on natural history that had been the eminent domain of women for almost thirty years. Other poems in the 1817 collection exhibit what amounts to a form of genre "cross-dress ing." There is a sonnet entitled "To a Friend Who Sent Me Some Roses." In "To Some Ladies," written to Caroline and Ann Matthews, Keats reworks Coleridge's "This Lime-Tree Bower My Prison," arguing that though he cannot join them on their natural history outing, "the won ders of nature exploring" (1), he nevertheless can be with them imagi natively. He even envisions that moment when they stooped "to pick up the keep-sake intended for me," a curious shell. No other present, he argues, would create "a warmer emotion" (a phrase particularly resonant of the female literature of sensibility), not even if a cherub had brought a gem from heaven along with the blessings of Mary Tighe, the author of Psyche. The subsequent poem in the collection, part of a poetic dialogue between Keats and the Matthew sisters, is entitled "On Receiving a Curious Shell, and a Copy of Verses, from the Same Ladies. " "To Some Ladies, " with its mention of Mary Tighe, suggests that Keats was acquainted with the concerns characterizing early nineteenth century "ladies verse," and it appears, at least in this poem, that he adopted it, as did many women during the time, in order to talk dis</page><page sequence="22">92 ALAN BEWELL creetly about sexuality.33 At one point, he imagines the Matthew sisters "mark[ing] the clear tumbling crystal, its passionate gushes, / Its spray that the wild flower kindly bedews" (7-8). The same idea is reworked in more explicit terms in "I stood tip-toe," where Keats speaks of the "interchange of favours" between the cresses and the brook: The ripples seem right glad to reach those cresses, And cool themselves among the em'raid tresses; The while they cool themselves, they freshness give, And moisture, that the bowery green may live: So keeping up an interchange of favours, Like good men in the truth of their behaviours. (81-86) Keats is, as he suggests, following the contemporary practice of using analogies drawn from nature to instill moral values, to "preach a natural sermon o'er their pebbly beds." However, it is not at all clear that the brook actually serves as an exemplum of male fidelity?"good men in the truth of their behaviours." Keats draws our attention to "the swarms of minnows" that "ever wrestle / With their own sweet delight, and ever nestle / Their silver bellies on the pebbly sand" (72-77). The fact that the image is explicitly sexual (the sand is a "pebbly bed") makes it clear that the lesson being taught in "I stood tip-toe" is that life is universally engaged in seeking "sweet delight." In a letter to J. H. Reynolds, Keats explicitly has recourse to botany, as a kind of insider language, which he and women share: "Will you have the goodness to do this? Borrow a Botanical Dictionary?turn to the words Laurel and Prunus show the explanations to your sisters and Mrs Dilk and without more ado let them send me the Cups Basket and Books they trifled and put off and off while I was in Town" (Letters 1 : 133; my italics). Anticipating the Victorians, Keats adopted the "lan guage of flowers," assuming that some things could be said through them that could not be said otherwise. It is worth noting, in this con nection, that it appears that homosexual males, during the Regency period, when prosecutions for homosexuality had increased, equally had recourse to botany as an encoded sexual language. Byron, while trav elling to the East, writes to his Cambridge friend Charles Skinner Mat thews, that "we are surrounded by Hyacinths &amp; other flowers of the 33- For a study of the ways in which 19th-century female writers confronted ideas of female propriety, see Mary Poovey, The Proper Lady and the Woman Writer: Ideology as Style in the Works of Mary Wollstonecrafi, Mary Shelley, and fane Austen.

One specimen [whom he later refers to as "Abb? Hyacinth"] I shall surely carry off, but of this hereafter. "34 That Matthews understood Byron's meaning is clear from his own letter, where he declares that "as to your Botanical pursuits, I take it that the flowers you will be most desirous of culling will be of the class polyandria and not monogynia but no gynia." He thus encourages Byron to collect polyandrous flowers, those with an indefinite number of "males" or stamens, to collect flowers with "no females" (i.e. "wogynia"), while avoiding flowers that are mono gynous, having a single female. He goes on to add: "However so as you do not cut them it will all do very well. A word or two about hyacinths. Hyacinth, you may remember was killed by a Coit [punning on quoit and coit(ion)], but not that 'full and to-be-wished-for-Coit.' Have a care your Abbey Hyacinth be not injured by either sort of coit. If you should find anything remarkable in the botanical line, pray send me word of it, who take an extreme interest in your anthology; and specify the class and if possible the name of each production. "351 do not want to claim that either Matthews or Byron?or for that matter Keats? are being particularly original in using botany as an encoded language of sexuality. Shelley, for instance, uses it equally successfully in "The Sensitive Plant." The fact that these metaphors emerge so easily in an epistolary context suggests that, at least during the Regency period, they were ready to hand. The frequent claim by Regency critics that Keats's poetry was "effeminate" points out the degree to which Keats's contem poraries saw in his floral style an appeal to an audience that was not obviously male and heterosexual. It should be stressed, then, that the chameleon poet Keats found his own style not only by adopting the language of Spenser, Hunt, Shake speare, Milton, Dryden, and Wordsworth, but also by drawing largely on the language of contemporary women's poetry.36 Though social class certainly played a role in the antagonism of the contemporary reviewers toward Keats's early poetry, an even greater source of antagonism lay in Keats's stylistic cross-dressing. A reviewer of the 1817 Poems, though willing to concede that Keats was a "poet of promise," was highly 34- Byron's Letters and Journals, ed. Leslie A. Marchand, 12 vols. (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard UP, 1973-1982) 1: 206-7. 35. Cited in Louis Crompton, Byron and Greek Love: Homophobia in ?gth-Century England (Berkeley: U of California P, 1985) 128-29. 36. Marlon B. Ross makes a similar claim in The Contours of Masculine Desire: Roman ticism and the Rise of Women's Poetry (Oxford: Oxford UP, 1989) 155-72.</page><page sequence="24">94 ALAN BEWELL critical of certain phrasings, which he considered to be both affected and feminine. "'Leafy luxury,'" "'jaunty streams,'" "'lawny slope,'" "'the moon-beamy air,'" '"a sun-beamy tale,'" he argues, "these, if not namby-pamby, are, at least, the 'holiday and lady terms' of those poor affected creatures who write verses 'in spite of nature and their stars.' . . . This is worthy only of the Rosa Matildas whom the strong-handed Gifford put down."37 Lockhart, in suggesting that Keats suffered from "metromanie," not only placed his poetry in the class of "farm-servants . . . unmarried ladies, . . . and superannuated governesses," but also adopted a term that had traditionally been used as an alternative name for female hysteria, that is, mania caused by the matrix ("Cockney School of Poetry, no. iv" 519). One effect of the antagonism expressed in the 1817 and 1818 reviews of Keats's poetry is that it split the poetry along gender lines. The fundamental unresolved conflict of Keats's later verse lies in his struggle, often against his own better poetic instincts, to distance himself from the intimacy with women and women's floral style that he sought in his earlier poems. Keats's remark, reported by Richard Woodhouse, that "he does not want ladies to read his poetry: that he writes for men" should not, therefore, be taken simply at face value, for it is less a statement about his poetry as a whole, than about his intentions in reaction to the reviews (Letters 2: 163). Keats set out to write like a man, to pass beyond the feminine style, which he associated with the "Cham ber of Maiden Thought. " Keats's answer to this gender conflict is to enact it within the later poems themselves as a matter of revision. In these poems, Keats con sistently rewrites the conflict between women's literature and the male visionary tradition as a conflict between his earlier and later self. The floral poet of the 1817 Poems and Endymion is continually conjured by these poems, but as a ghost to be exorcised. "Ode to Psyche" is typical of this revisionary strategy as it summons up the early Keatsean poet, wandering through a forest "thoughtlessly" and "fainting with surprise" to find two lovers embracing "beneath the whisp'ring roof / Of leaves and trembled blossoms" (10-11), only to replace naive pleasure with a poetry that embodies the work ethic and a new emphasis on the priority of mind over body. In "Isabella," the floral language of the early poetry reappears as Keats describes the love of Isabella and Lorenzo growing "like a lusty flower in June's caress" (72). The remainder of the poem represents a grisly parody of urban horticulture and of poetic 37- The Scots Magazine (October 1817): 257.</page><page sequence="25">KEATS'S "REALM OF FLORA" 95 creation reduced to pot gardening, as both the poet and the heroine Isabella seek to recreate a green world out of "wormy circumstance" (385). In "To a Nightingale," Keats returns to the poetic bower, but the bower is now linked to death, situated in the Underworld. He can no longer "see what flowers are at my feet," but in this "embalmed dark ness," he can guess "each sweet": White hawthorn, and the pastoral eglantine; Fast fading violets cover'd up in leaves; And mid-May's eldest child, The coming musk-rose, full of dewy wine, The murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves. (41-50) The bower is still redolent with sexuality, as it is presided over by the "coming musk-rose." The sexual symbolism of the "musk-rose," with its "dewy wine," is reinforced by the word coming, which, as Eric Partridge indicates in his Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English, would have meant "wanton" or "forward" when applied to a woman. Traces of the early Keatsean figure of the desiring poet as a "butterfly/ bee" also appear in the figure of the rose as "the murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves. " However, the sexual symbolism of these scents has given way to the more powerful language of death, as the musk rose womb, becomes a tomb, a place of decaying flesh. And the figure of the poet, embodied in the poetic song of the "butterflies" or moths, is literally displaced, in ways that anticipate the gnats of "To Autumn, " by a song integrally bound up with death, the haunting murmurs of flies, which traditionally were understood as embodying the souls of the dead. This shift from eros to thanatos is further emphasized by the dom inating presence of the Virgilian symbol of the "bird" as the poet's guide to the Underworld. The haunting presence of Keats's early floral rhetoric in the later poetry, as a dead language that it actively incorporates in order to revise, could be discussed in other poems: in the desolate bower at the beginning of The Fall of Hyperion, in the poisonous catalogue of plants in "Ode on Melancholy," or in the lillied brow and "fading rose" cheek of the knight in "La Belle Dame sans Merci. " In these poems, floral language is linked to death, as Keats talks directly, often through the figure of sacrifice, of the need to produce and the cost of producing a more "manly," less smokable, style. Another way in which this revisionary activity is man ifested is in the figurai association between sexuality and defloration. In many of the later poems, poetic maturity is to be achieved only through a masculine deflowering of the self. The seduction narrative thus becomes,</page><page sequence="26">96 ALAN BEWELL for Keats, a narrative that speaks of the cost of a new style. Though "Eve of St. Agnes," for instance, is explicitly about the physical deflow ering of Madeline, it is, even more importantly, a poem about the defloration of Madeline's and Porphyro's dreams. At the beginning of the poem, the idea of sex blossoms in Porphyro's mind "like a full blown rose, / Flushing his brow" (136-37). By the end of the poem, however, the early Keatsean fantasy that sexual bliss.might be embodied by botanical metaphor, as a "solution sweet," the "rose" blending "its odour with the violet" (3?0-22), has been relegated to the sphere of Romance. It is under constant threat of destruction. In "La Belle Dame sans Merci," seduction is similarly linked to poetic defloration: "the sedge has wither'd from the lake, / And no birds sing" (3-4). Lamia begins by invoking the mythological link between flowers and sexuality. And it culminates in sexuality and metamorphosis. At the touch of Hermes, Keats writes, the "bland" eyelids of the Cretan nymph like new flowers at morning song of bees, Bloom'd, and gave up her honey to the lees. Into the green-recessed woods they flew; Nor grew they pale, as mortal lovers do. (1.141-45) But this world passes out of existence and is "heard no more" (1.170), to be replaced by the commercial urbanism of Corinth. There, love is inseparably linked to jealousy, rivalry, money, and power. Lycius resorts to floral language in speaking of his love for Lamia: 'My silver planet, both of eve and morn! Why will you plead yourself so sad forlorn, While I am striving how to fill my heart With deeper crimson, and a double smart? How to entangle, trammel up and snare Your soul in mine, and labyrinth you there Like the hid scent in an unbudded rose?' (2.48-54) Here floral metaphor is permeated with violence?the "deeper crimson," the "double smart"?as love is transformed into a sado-masochistic struggle, a "striving" for power over another person. Having lost his virginity, Lycius longs to recover his "maidenhood" through possessing Lamia, "Your soul in mine," labyrinthed "like the hid scent in an un budded rose. " In Lamia, poetry is viewed as a commercial substitute for lost floral pleasures. At the banquet, each guest is provided with the object of his desire:</page><page sequence="27">KEATS'S "REALM OF FLORA" 97 Soon was God Bacchus at meridian height; Flush'd were their cheeks, and bright eyes double bright: Garlands of every green, and every scent From vales deflower'd, or forest-trees branch-rent, In baskets of bright osier'd gold were brought High as the handles heap'd, to suit the thought Of every guest. (2.213-19) Keats points to the cost and conditions of this art: it exists because of "vales deflower'd" (Lycius' and Lamia's defloration being an expression on the private level of a cultural event), and it continues to destroy these vales in its effort to recover those lost pleasures. Keats's most pessimistic expression of the conflict he felt between the floral, feminized ideal of his earlier poetry and the demands of a mas culine tradition is to be found in the sonnet "On Fame." Poetry and sexuality are once more fused in this poem, as Keats draws on the language of sexual perversion in order to call into question such de mands. Poetic maturation is again symbolized by defloration; here, how ever, the focus is upon self-seduction, the poet's fevered rape of his maidenhood: How fever'd is the man who cannot look Upon his mortal days with temperate blood, Who vexes all the leaves of his life's book, And robs his fair name of its maidenhood (1-4) In the first quatrain, Keats's deliberately emphasizes maleness?"the man," "his . . . days," "his . . . book," "his . . . name"?in order to foreground what male conceptions of fame deny: the female component of a "fair name. " In seeking fame, men rob their names of their "maid enhood. " It is a sterile form of narcissism, a perversion of sexual love into self-love, an onanistic pleasure of "vex[ing]" of "the leaves of. . . life's book. " In the next quatrain, Keats provides analogies of what such striving would be like in the realm of flora: It is as if the rose should pluck herself, Or the ripe plum finger its misty bloom, As if a Naiad, like a meddling elf, Should darken her pure grot with muddy gloom. (5-8)</page><page sequence="28">98 ALAN BEWELL The vulgarity of this passage is part of its message: nature does not "meddle" with itself; female masturbation, for Keats, is not only un natural, but unnecessary. In this regard, it is worth noting that Keats is just as antagonistic towards "male" readers, as females, and in describing his poetry, he characteristically views it as feminine. He writes in a letter that he would prefer "to avoid publishing?I admire Human Nature but I do not like Men?should like to compose things honourable to Man? but not fingerable over by Men" (Letters i: 415). In the sestet, as an alternative to the masculine conception of fame as "fierce" rivalry, a "miscreed," punning on the meaning of screed as a long, monotonous harangue, Keats reaffirms the ideal of floral sexuality, of a world of mutual satisfaction: But the rose leaves herself upon the briar, For winds to kiss and grateful bees to feed, And the ripe plum still wears its dim attire, The undisturbed lake has crystal space; Why then should man, teasing the world for grace, Spoil his salvation for a fierce miscreed? (9-14) Keats is a unique poet because he continued to draw upon the tradi tional link between flowers and pastoral poetry long after floral imagery had come to be seen as primarily the poetic discourse of women. At a time when women were both adopting and attempting to escape the constraints imposed upon them by the notion that they were flowers, at a time when floral imagery of all kinds was the appropriate medium of female communication and the epitome of feminine beauty, at a time when botany had become the most popular of female scientific occu pations, Keats's wholesale adoption of a highly decorous floral imagery in order to talk about sexual desire and to communicate it to others raises problems concerning gender and its boundaries that are less fre quently raised by other male romantic poets. Keats was pressured by the reviews to regret the voice he had adopted in his early poetry, and in the later poetry one can discern his attempt to adopt alternate, more overtly masculine voices, distancing himself from a feminized poetic without disowning it. Floral imagery, in the later poetry, is thus very much a register of the poet's increasing recognition of and discomfort with contemporary attitudes toward gender and with the ways in which the age demanded that an author's gender be expressed in a specific style.
