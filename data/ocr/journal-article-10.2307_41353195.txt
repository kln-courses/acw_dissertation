Just before sunset on a hot August day in Los Angeles, we sat in a nearly empty hotel restaurant awaiting the arrival of one of the most influential husband-and-wife intellec- tual teams in history: Alvin and Heidi Toffler. They may be octogenarians now, but pick up a copy of the Tofflers' most famous books - Future Shock (1970) and The Third Wave (1980) - and you will quickly wonder why anyone bothers to write the redundant meta social and political commentaries that drown us today. These books, written when we were children, contain such stunning and prescient insights, encapsulated in elegant yet racing prose, that they ought to be essential reading four de- cades onward. Indeed, you couldn't be blamed for thinking they had just been published this year. Terms and concepts that are on the tip of everyone's tongue today leap off the pages: the crisis of industrialism, the promise of renewable energy, ad-hocracy in business, the rise of the non-nuclear family, technology-enabled telecom- muting, the power of the pro-sumer, sensors embedded in household appliances, a gene industry that pre-designs the human body, corporate social responsibility, "information j overload" - and yes, right there on p. 292 of The Third Wave , the phrase Wired magazine can't get enough of today: "diy Revolution." No wonder the book has been dubbed the "classic study of tomorrow." (Of the very few things they seem to have gotten wrong, or at least not yet right, is wide- spread polygamist communes.) In person, the Tofflers were just as insightful, making con- nections between America's congressional deadlock, Asians' obsession with high technology, and the inertia of Mideast politics. But what's so extraordinary about the Tofflers is not what they told us in that restaurant, but their long-ago insights about today's society that seem so relevant now, es- pecially considering that many were not at all obvious at the time. Where conventional wisdom of the era saw mass industrialization turning common citizens into straitjacketed "mass man," the Tofflers saw stratification and functional differentiation generating a superindustrial society with a "quilt-like" diversity. And where the public was either ig- norant or complacent about the far-reaching effects of ad- vanced communications technology, the Tofflers foresaw telephony and virtual worlds that would force us to devise ever more creative ways to avoid overstimulation and pre- serve our privacy.

In this ognize that even diseases would be technologically new era, human evolution has become human- generated. The Tofflers' "future shock" is at once a technology co-evolution: We're becoming part of sickness and a way of life. the machine, and it is becoming part of us. Clearly, the Tofflers - now writing one last There js no adequate word in English to capture book, their memoirs - still have cutting-edge ideas this complex entanglement of humans and technol- to offer.

Forget about the Internet: As scientific fields ranging from neuroscience and biology to mathematics and phys- ics mingle and mate, they'll produce new technological offspring capable of unimagined prowess. Already, the Hy- brid Age is moving us well beyond information technology into entire new sectors like biotechnology, nanotechnology, clean technology, artificial intelligence, and robotics, as well as invigorating traditional ones like industrial manufactur- ing and energy production. The falling cost of computing has unleashed collaboration across scientific fields and giv- en rise to whole new arenas of invention. Biomechatronics, for example, brings together biology, electrical engineering, and physics to create lifelike prosthetics that are almost as good as our natural human limbs. Lastly, the Hybrid Age is not only one of increasing technological presence, but also technological disruption. Brian Arthur, a professor at the Santa Fe Institute, writes in The Nature of Technology that unlike humans, tech- nology can mature, diversify, and scale at an accelerat- ing pace. The more technologies that exist, the greater the number of combinatorial possibilities, resulting in ever newer and more complex products that revolutionize in- dustries. This has already happened with jet engines and semiconductors and is now under way with software and carbon nanotubes, whose combination of strength, elastic- ity, and thermal-conduction properties could revolution- ize everything from bone repair to batteries. This means we will constantly witness technologies blowing apart old business models as they come to market faster than ever. And it's not just business models that will be affected. Take the coming advent of do-it-yourself manufacturing. At first blush, the United States' first-mover advantage in developing these affordable designer devices will empower its mom-and-pop shops to tailor-make niche products at cut-rate costs, threatening China's manufacturing base while reviving the U.S. economy. But if China suddenly loses revenue to America's heartland, how will it continue to recycle its vast foreign exchange reserves into U.S. Trea- sury bonds? In the end, one technological innovation in the United States could lead to its interest rates skyrock- eting and economy tanking (again). Be careful what you wish for: The Hybrid Age is also an age of disruption.

We don't live in different places so much as we live in differ- ent stages of Technik. In the 1970s, the Tofflers estimated that several million people were living "in the future" due to their de- gree of technological connectedness and faster pace of life. Today several million people in Tokyo alone live "in the future." Japanese society has robots teaching classrooms</page><page sequence="5">72 Foreign Policy of teenagers, robo-pets monitoring and providing compan- ionship to the elderly, and a cutting edge of young people with virtual avatars as lovers. The conventional analysis of Japan is that the country is "dying" because of its sharp demographic decline, but it is every bit as much evolving. Even a country still as overwhelmed by poverty as India is finding that it can elevate its Technik through high mobile-phone penetration, a biometrie national identity card scheme, digital kiosks in dusty villages, and a sophisticated Right to Information Act that requires publishing all laws on the Internet. As we move into the Hybrid Age, whoever has the ca- pacity to manage the intersection of technology, capital, and identity can become a pole of power. Politics will be re- centered on not just the state, but four diverse, overlapping Cs: countries, cities, companies, and communities. Already we see the narrative shifting away from 19th-century dog- mas such as "governments provide security and prosperity" toward a recognition that most governments are at best regulatory. Instead we hear that the private sector generates growth and prosperity, which in turn create stability. Gov- ernments range from those that have the resources to remain active shapers of political and economic identity (Singapore, China) to those where public and private are struggling to find a workable division of labor (Europe, the United States) to those that seem to do little at all (much of the post- colonial world). Employees of Facebook or Google can spend their days on campuses that are effectively full- service communes; the same is happening in companies in Russia, India, and China. One day a corporate passport might afford them greater freedom of mobility than their national citizenship. In the Hybrid Age, we may all be suffering from a new kind of identity crisis. Instead of a world of West vs. East and democracies vs. dictatorships, we will be in a more com- plex reality where actors ranging from cities to diasporas to corporations to cloud communities struggle and compete to boost their Technik. Some governments will provide Tech- nik for their citizens; others will fail. Megacorporations may gain loyalty and constituents by offering affordable Technik. And those that fail to do so will fall behind. What truly differentiates the Hybrid Age from previ- ous revolutionary periods is that it will become global very quickly. Billions of the world's poor from Africa to India are already participating in technological experimentation and have themselves become innovators of paradigm-shifting services. In India, about 10 million new mobile connections are activated every month. In Kenya, local engineers devel- oped the mobile-phone banking system Safaricom that made many traditional banks in the country immediately redun- dant. Chris Anderson, curator of the ted conferences, calls such disruption "crowd-accelerated innovation." Thus the poor will play an unexpected role in the Hybrid Age, using technology to create opportunities for themselves and dis- ruptions for the developed world. And yet we have not even begun to grasp the implica- tions of human-technology co-evolution. Are you sure that studying insane hours for years on end in medical school is such a good idea when already 75 percent of prostate-cancer surgeries in the United States are robot-assisted? How about the impact of life-extension treatments when governments have yet to adjust their retirement and pension policies to a world in which life expectancy in wealthy societies crosses 75 years, let alone 100 years?
