Weiss In the primordial mud of existence, an exhumed doll, a miracu- lated body soaked with tears. - Michel Nedjar THE SITES OF AESTHETIC DISCOVERY are as varied as our passions, and our fears. The objects of our fascination, the raw matter of our arts, are sometimes familiar and reassuring, sometimes bizarre and uncanny. Some- times such things lead us back to our childhood, sometimes forward to the moment of our death. On certain rare occasions, birth and death are con- flated, and we are privy to the internal workings of the cosmos, revealing the very origins of our being. In Nadja (1928), Andre Breton recounts that he would often go to the flea market at Saint-Ouen, just outside of Paris: ...I go there often, searching for objects that can be found nowhere else: old-fashioned, broken, useless, almost incomprehensible, even per- verse...(52) These objets trouvis are emblematic of the Surrealist aesthetic: manifesta- tions of "objective chance," they not only correspond to the dreams of the flaneur who discovers them, but they furthermore create reveries, that key feature of Surrealist poetics. In the already standardized commercial culture of Paris in the 1920s, the flea market was the rare place where such found objects-whether objets naturels or objets perturbis-might still be discovered. Once recycled in the context of the flea market, these objects-the refuse of history-are disposed in a sort of unorganized, unconscious collage, a mixture of epochs, places and styles where the centuries collide and exotic cultures infiltrate our own. The attraction, as Breton explains in L'amourfou-where he tells of yet another trip to the same flea market in 1934, this time with Alberto Giacometti-is that of the jamais vu, of the absolutely unique and unknown (42). Such "oneiric" objects play the role of poetic catalyst, where the imagination becomes a function of the aesthetic de-realization of SubStance #65, 1991 21</page><page sequence="2">22 Allen S. Weiss the everyday world, leading towards the re-creation of the cosmos as thoroughly marvelous. Jean Dubuffet, too, frequented the flea markets of Paris, but for quite different purposes, albeit ultimately aesthetic ones. In his article "Saint- Ouen - Le Marche" (1944), he tells of his fascination with this place. But rather than vaunting the rare, the unusual, the marvelous, his is a celebra- tion of the commonplace, of "man settled into his presence, fully accessible, a radiously open mold [....] Man, oh my feast!" (P-I, 108). Shortly after founding La Compagnie de l'Art Brut--dedicated to collect- ing those works of Art Brut (created by the insane, the eccentric, the iso- lated) which Dubuffet initially saw as stemming from the impulses of the common man, untainted by cultural conventions-Dubuffet took yet another trip to the flea market at Saint-Ouen (June 1948). He went at the suggestion of Andre Breton (one of the charter members of the Compagnie), to purchase some of Maisonneuve's masks that Breton had discovered there. Unlike Breton's, Dubuffet's visits were not primarily inspired by the search for the unknown, but motivated by the project of collecting objects of Art Brut-objects as marvelous as any that Breton had previously dis- covered. And yet, these trips would have another effect: it is precisely the banal textures and forms, objects and images of the everyday world that Dubuffet would ultimately recuperate into his own works of art, into his own aesthetic. Dubuffet's radical attraction to pure, unadulterated, base matter is allegorically exemplified in a letter to his friend Jacques Berne, on May 15, 1949: I was enchanted by the crayfish, which pleased me greatly, and I thank you. It is a very rich food. Almost too rich. Too rich! I often tell Lili that her cooking is too rich--cream, butter, etc. I much prefer grass, or earth, which seems to me to be much more sumptuous. To eat earth, now there's a rich dish! (P-II, 433-434) In a letter to Gaston Chaissac, on June 24, 1947, he is equally explicit about the use of diverse matires primaires on the aesthetic level: It would greatly please me to use cow dung. In the Sahara, when the Arabs have something to putty or a hole to stop up, they use a paste formed by kneading dates with goat dung and a bit of sand. That's an ingredient which greatly moves me, and which I fully expect to use one day. (P-I, 466) Here is an aesthetic desire working against itself, moving towards an anti- aesthetic--or perhaps more accurately a counter-aesthetic-procedure. In other words, Dubuffet proposes what amounts to a de-sublimatory aes- SubStance #65, 1991</page><page sequence="3">Primacy of Matter 23 thetic in opposition to the sublimatory exigencies of what he refers to as the "cultural arts." (And these arts most certainly included Surrealism.) Such a de-sublimation is evident in his celebration of pure living matter itself. This materiological, indeed scatological, aesthetic recalls the psychoanalytic understanding about the origins of works of art. Lexical considerations are highly revelatory in this regard: Le Petit Robert tells us that matter signifies the "indeterminate ground of being," the chaotic, unor- ganized stuff of existence; and by ellipsis, matter can signify fecal matter- this latter lexical transformation, or euphemistic dissimulation, is an allegory for the process of sublimation itself. Psychoanalytic theory descri- bes the complex set of unconscious symbolic relations whereby for the infant, the feces are equated with gift, child and penis. Excrement-as pure formless matter, as pure body-functions as both good and bad object, as gift or weapon. Infantile play with the feces prefigures the artistic activity of sculptural production. In the process by which the infant is socialized, the first exclusion demanded of the individual body by the body politic is that of excrement: simultaneously the sign of our guilt (bad object, weapon, stain) and the sign of our power (good object, gift, magical talisman, artwork). Here, all nonproductive expenditure is abolished and dissimu- lated in the symbolic machine of cultural activity. This exclusion, this destruction of our primal sovereignty, is the very origin of sublimation. Excrement-as an image of death, as pure, formless, heterogeneous mat- ter-is excluded from the symbolic order. All culture is the sublimation of this primal creative activity-and as anality is the mark of death, all sub- limation is somehow the projection of the instinctual life of the repressed body into dead things, into cultural artifacts. De-sublimation is achieved in those rare instances when adult social production takes the inverse route back towards the body, breaking the significative chain of quotidian exist- ence by inaugurating a return of the repressed. In moving towards such dark, asymbolic doubles, the long-repressed horror of death is revealed as the underside of the instincts, desires, and culture.1 We find the limits of scatological creativity in certain Art Brut crea- tions of the mentally ill. Note the work of Georgine Hu (found in the museum L'Aracine), a patient in a psychiatric hospital just outside of Paris.2 Her art consists in part of false banknotes created on toilet paper, with which she often attempted to pay her psychiatrist! Here, the scatologi- cal significance of money-the link between excrement and filthy lucre-is symbolized in a de-sublimated creativity, where the humor and irony of the situation call into question both the economic and psychological aspects of creativity and artistic endeavors. But it is not only in the art of SubStance #65, 1991</page><page sequence="4">24 Allen S. Weiss the mentally ill that expression rediscovers its primal, scatological, cor- poreal component. If Dubuffet's art was indeed influenced by those creations of Art Brut which he collected, it was more in terms of the use of inhabitual materials and techniques than in formal innovations. Indeed, Dubuffet's entire artis- tic enterprise was more concerned with material than formal causes and effects. Michel Thevoz explains in his detailed study, Dubuffet, the contrast between the formal and material characteristics of art: Matter, to the contrary, is the immediate, the unformed, the unnameable, what has neither identity nor determinations nor the civil status of Being. It does not lend itself to differentiation or to organization or to delimitation; or, what amounts to the same thing, it lends itself to all this much too complaisantly...(41)3 Dubuffet's varied series of works-Texturologie, Topographie, Giogra- phie, Materiologie, Pdtes Battues-all exemplify his passion with raw matter by proffering pure textures without representational significance. But in fact, all of his work is a celebration of matter. Such "inspiration" by matter is the ultimate localization and particularization of the aesthetic object, hence the ultimate degree of anti-influence. It is an aesthetic detotalization, where signifier and signified are perpetually conflated, and where artistic creativity is closest to its material-and thus cosmological--origins. This opposition of matter to form-with pure matter as zero-degree form-leads directly to the problematic of the formless in art. This issue was already evident in the modernist discourse, being at the core of the rupture in the Surrealist movement around 1930, especially in the polemic between Andre Breton and Georges Bataille.4 Breton's poetic, idealized, sublimated mode of art was criticized by Bataille as being "pretentious idealist aberrations," and "nauseating utopian sentimentality." In opposi- tion to Breton's dialectical idealism, Bataille proposed a sort of non-dialec- tical materialism, a desublimatory heterology guided by sovereign wasteful expenditure, by transgression and excess. This position was im- plicitly an anti-aesthetic, as exemplified by Bataille's dictionary entry in the journal Documents for the word "informe" (formless), which ends with the claim: "...affirming that the universe resembles nothing and is only formless amounts to saying that the universe is something like a spider or spit" (31). Dubuffet too broke with Breton, in 1951, though for very different reasons than Bataille (related to the dissolution of the Compagnie de l'Art Brut); Dubuffet's artistic position was also diametrically opposed to that of Breton. In that same epoch (Dec. 21, 1952, letter to Michel Tapir), Dubuffet spoke of his own work in terms of an "informisme," "vehe'mentisme," and SubStance #65, 1991</page><page sequence="5">Primacy of Matter 25 "eclaboussurisme" (P-II, 308), and one of his earliest written texts, "Notes pour les fins-lettr6s," (1946) begins with the subheading: "Partant de lin- forme" (P-I, 54), where he argues that pure material itself is in fact already a language. Dubuffet also stresses the importance of chance as a function of the particularities of the materials employed in the work of art.5 Whence the importance of aberrations in the work of art: much later, Dubuffet will generalize these notions and claim that art itself is "a department of aber- rations" (P-I, 468). The tradition of discovery in the context of the flea market continues today in Paris, manifested in the life and works of the artist Michel Nedjar. But unlike Breton and Dubuffet, who were finally only visitors to that place, Nedjar is integrally involved in the flea market at Clignancourt. Nedjar's maternal grandmother was a rag-picker (chiffonikre); his father a tailor; he himself was trained to be a tailor and designer, yet abandoned this profession to travel, discover himself, and create his art-finally earn- ing his living by working in the flea market several days a week. As he describes in an article entitled "I Am Tied to the Threads of the World," My maternal grandmother used to buy up old clothes from middle-class homes. She would sell them at the Malik market. They were the schmates. The great times of the '50s. She was a ragpicker... The schmate really was my granny. In her shop, she would bury herself in them, she had them all over her and all around her; it was her whole life. She was completely crazy about them, she lived on them: old rags. She would never throw out the slightest scrap, or if anyone else did, she would go and recover it from the garbage bin, saying: "I'm sure I can get a price for this schmate." It's grandmother for the fabrics and father for the needlework which pulls the pieces together. The ragpicker and the tailor: it's strange how I com- bined those two things, to give birth to a little creature. The dolls I make are really their child: the central point where my grandmother's and my father's energies flow together. (53-54) We find here the biographical foundation of Nedjar's aesthetic, the very mati&amp;re primaire of his art. The sources of his artistic material are both the flea market, where he found many of the rags which he transformed into art, as well as an even more primal source of waste material-garbage cans: SubStance #65, 1991</page><page sequence="6">26 Allen S. Weiss Michel Nedjar: "Doll" Photo: David Boeno Continuity: because I never throw out any rags--that would be cruel-I risk being immersed altogether. Every week I bring them home from the flea market. The solution I've found is to transform them. A rebirth through my work with old rag For me, the garbage bin has something magical about it. It's so beautiful, the inside of a garbage bin, all those things gleaming up at you. (55-56 Nedjar speaks of "the nostalgia of worn fabric," of the fact that, "the schmate is not an appearance; already it's closer to death, wearing out, old age. When it starts to glisten..." (54). Beyond the collage aesthetic of the Cubists, beyond Duchamp's anti-aesthetic of the "readymade," beyond the "found object" aesthetic of the Surrealists, and beyond Dubuffet's radical celebration of a newly created "materiology," Nedjar's work entails the total resuscitation of waste material into the art object. Yet this is an object which maintains its specific material and formal relations to the once-aban- doned rags, earth and waste matter of which it is made, all the while becoming a new sort of mythical, magical entity. SubStance #65, 1991</page><page sequence="7">Primacy of Matter 27 Michel Nedjar: "Doll" Photo: David Boeno The title of one of Dubuffet's texts is, "RWhabilitation de la boue" (1946). If mud were ever "rehabilitated" in the history of art, it is in the work of Michel Nedjar: If I were to bury my dolls, it would be in order to dig them up again. The emotion of things decaying. Decaying material, the way the earth sets to work, the earth gnawing away, the moldiness. The doll is transformed just as the body is undoubtedly transformed beneath the earth. For me, there is no frontier between decay and its opposite. I need a full transformation. I use cold dyes. That's the effect which the earth would have produced, and it's the effect that I achieve by putting it on the fabrics. Because I touch; I make a dough. It resembles mud. (55; augmented translation) SubStance #65, 1991</page><page sequence="8">28 Allen S. Weiss For Nedjar, the matire primaire of his art is identified with terra firma, especially in its amorphous state of mud-literally, "la nostalgie de la boue." Mud, shit and blood--these are the sources of both life and art for Nedjar: The dolls represent the beginning of the world: they are animal, stone, woman, man, the universe--the primeval fundamental material. That's an extraordinary experience. It was terrible and at the same time extraordi- nary. I covered my dolls over with soil and blood and it was a very power- ful thing-I thought I was going mad. (6) In short, as Nedjar claims in "L'Art des transformations," "What's dirty is alive" (21). Or as Dubuffet insists: Mud, refuse, and filth: these are man's lifelong companions. Shouldn't they be quite dear to him, and wouldn't it be doing him a favor to remind him of their beauty? (P-II, 66) Thinking back to Bataille's choice of the spider to symbolize the un- formed, we can understand in part why Michel Nedjar chose the spider as his personal symbol. (It appears as the "star" of one of his films, A quoi reve l'araignee? [1981-1982]; a plastic spider is to be found among his collection of magic dolls; its image protects the entranceway to his apartment; and it adorns his letters and post-cards in the form of a rubber-stamped image.) As the symbol of the unformed at the root of all formations (i.e., the ugly, terrifying spider spinning the archetypal natural aesthetic form, its beauti- ful web), as the chaos at the core of the cosmos, the spider symbolizes primal matter and creativity, as well as ultimate death. For Nedjar, as we have seen, this primitive composition of creation is the combination of rags and mud. Yet the differences between Nedjar and Dubuffet are apparent: while for Dubuffet the celebration of matter is ultimately a pragmatic means of discovering new effects (be they aesthetic or anti-aesthetic), for Nedjar matter has a magical, even mystical quality. Despite occasional superficial formal similarities, it would be more precise to say that Nedjar's relation to Dubuffet is to be found on deeper levels. First, both of their oeuvres instan- tiate the hyperbolic instance of the modernist quest for accentuating the materiality of the artwork. (Though every artist is somehow concerned with the materials at hand, most dissimulate the material base of the work in favor of its formal effects). Second, it may be said that Dubuffet-who in fact chose Nedjar's dolls for inclusion in the Collection de l'Art Brut at Lausanne--was the first artist whose "tradition" was constituted by the heterogeneous non-tradition of Art Brut. Michel Nedjar-who is a co- SubStance #65, 1991</page><page sequence="9">Primacy of Matter 29 founder of L'Aracine, France's first museum of Art Brut-can also be said to have engaged Art Brut as his own tradition, once he discovered certain formal, material and spiritual affinities between his own work and that of many Art Brut creators. Yet this fascination with material is in fact directly related to the need for expression. Perhaps we may ascertain the very origins of art in the nexus of zero-degree matter and zero-degree expression. In Artistry of the Mentally Ill-among the most influential studies of the art of the mentally ill, which by extension has also revealed the mainsprings of art in general, beyond the restricted realm of the psychopathology of expression-Hans Prinzhorn describes the crucial, central role of scribbling in the creative act (14). Scribbling is understood to be the key structural feature underlying the expressive gestalt of all artistic forms. Such "unobjective disordered scribblings" bear a chronological and structural primacy within expression: not yet a "language," such pure expressive traces are signs of corporeal activity, limited by the very nature of the materials at hand. (And we might add that, mutatis mutandis, this schema also pertains to the most basic sculptural activity.) A fundamental, pre-formal figuration of the psychic Gestalt, their expressive efficacy is lost as soon as the world is thematized, as soon as the world is categorized and denominated within the mimetic formalization of objects. These figura- tions then become the prime formal features of works of art, within repre- sentational schemes of resemblance and appearance. Thus, even if matter itself is a language, as Dubuffet claims, there is a primal moment of creativ- ity at which we still cannot quite speak through it. Here, it is the body that speaks-the troubled, awkward gesture paradoxically manifests an ade- quate expression of the spirit. Dubuffet-whose final series of works, Mires (1983-1984) and Non- Lieux (1984), were a return to scribbled forms-was always concerned with what Thdvoz refers to as our "psychic prehistory": The plane surface, the stroke that is repeated, the form that is drawn, are all foreign to the natural world. They are not constitutively devoted to mimetic representation; they only open up the symbolic register in its antefigurative polyvalence. (36) And as Dubuffet explains his own project: My apparatus functions as a machine to abolish the names of things, to collapse the walls that the mind sets up between diverse objects, between diverse systems of objects, between the different registers of facts and of things and the different planes of thought; a machine to scramble the entire order instituted by the mind within the walls of phenomena, and to erase SubStance #65, 1991</page><page sequence="10">30 Allen S. Weiss with a single stroke all the paths traced out there; a machine to defeat all reason and to reinvest all things with equivocation and confusion. (P-II, 148-149) It is precisely these deformations stemming from expression-yet guided by the contingencies of matter-which effect a transformation of the aesthetic field. Dubuffet consciously puts these effects to work in con- stituting an anti-aesthetic art, a contestation of the established modernist aesthetic domain. Yet this project remains sublimatory, even if only in the profoundly dialectical relation between cultural art and Dubuffet's anti-art. On the contrary, Nedjar profits from a fascination with matter and the traces left by (de)formative gestures to engender a de-sublimatory crea- tion-anterior in time (his dolls harken back to the first playthings of childhood); regressive in matter (using the primordial mud, blood and excrement of mythopoeic creation, as well as working with his ancestral materials of rags); reclusive in space (secluded in his atelier, yet influenced by magical dolls from around the world, i.e., by arts whose formal aspects are ultimately subservient to their sacred potential.) In La terre et les reveries de la volontd, Gaston Bachelard reveals the imaginary and symbolic relations between human creativity and the earth. In a chapter entitled "La pate," he recounts a dream from Hans Carossa's book, Une enfance: In a nighttime dream, recounted at length, the book's hero sees an uncle appear who tells him point-blank: "Are you there, master modeler?" And the uncle places "three pellets of a reddish white mixture" in the hand of the young dreamer, suggesting that he "make a beautiful child." We should immediately understand that from the beginning of this oneiric story we are in the presence of the archetype of matter. These three pellets are really the primitive loam, the primal earth, the necessary and sufficient matter needed to "make a beautiful child. To create-in the strong sense of the word-is to create a child. In the dream, words often find their profound anthropomorphic sense. Besides, we should note that uncon- scious modelling is not of things, but of animals. A child, left to himself, makes a chicken or a rabbit. He creates life. But the dream works quickly; the sleeping modeler soon ends his oneiric tale: "I worked and kneaded the dough for a while, and suddenly held in my hand a marvellously beautiful little man." The kneaded homonculus will no doubt incite facile psychoanalytic commentaries. But for us, as the rest of the tale will prove, it is here the sign of a profound aesthetic impulse. (96) This tale might serve as an allegory for the creations of Michel Nedjar, works also born from a family drama, in the direct lineage of his father and maternal grandmother. Yet rather than learning to create by modeling, SubStance #65, 1991</page><page sequence="11">Primacy of Matter 31 Nedjar needed to learn how to "unsew," as he says, in order to produce his dolls. In a totally different context, the philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty, in developing an ontology of the human body, explains that the body is "that strange object which uses its own parts as a general system of sym- bols for the world" (237). This is a theory of sublimation. Conversely, we might say that for Michel Nedjar, the symbols and matter of the world are those strange entities which he uses to form his specific representations, indeed deformations, of the human body-his dolls. This is a process, a poetics, of de-sublimation. And yet, their ultimate effect depends upon whether we consider them to be merely art, or something else, something closer to our own doubles, to the hidden side of our soul.

Dubuffet and Bataille probably met, before the actual beginning of either of their careers, in 1922 at the rue Blomet studio of Andrd Masson, which they both frequented. This meeting place was the rendezvous of many writers and artists--in- cluding Artaud, Leiris and Limbour-who were to later align themselves against Breton and mainstream Surrealism. 5.
