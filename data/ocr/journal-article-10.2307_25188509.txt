<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Medieval Critique of Anthropomorphism. Ibn al-Jawzi's Kitab Akhbar As-Sifat. By M. Swartz. A Critical Edition of the Arabic Text with Translations, Introduction and Notes, pp. 330 and 116 pages Arabic text. Leiden, Brill, 2002. DOI: 10.1017/S1356186305244917 The problem of anthropomorphism was raised by the first rational theologian of Islam, Wasil ibn cAta? (699-748), by doing so the founder of the Muctazilite school of theology, was the first to deny the existence of divine attributes, joining al-Jahmiyya. The question of attributes remained one of the central problems of Muslim theology for centuries and was closely connected with the problem of the literal or metaphoric interpretations of the Quran. In spite of the classical treatments of the question1 (mainly from the angle of the Muctazila) and the large number of articles devoted to details of varying importance, no comprehensive survey of the problem in its complexity has been made so far. What has been said just recently about the question of attributes in general, is valid for the Hanbalite school of law as well. It is well-known that this school rejected any analogical interpretation of the Quran, but even a literal approach admits several methods of interpretation in detail and nuance. This amounts to saying that even the Hanbalite school was not necessarily united in every respect, including the important question of divine attributes too. The great merit of Swartz is that he edited an important and formerly unknown text (Preface, p. x), which sheds new light on the old problem. The book consists of two parts. The second (pp. 1-116) contains the edition of the Arabic text, with the first consisting of a study on Ibn al-Jawzi (where he was introduced in various settings: as being a member of a famous family, a prominent Hanbalite scholar in the last century of the golden age of Baghdad, the alleged author of the work under consideration, etc.; pp. 3-70) and of the translation of the Arabic text with commentary in the notes (pp. 77-297) and a bibliography with an index (pp. 299-318 and 319-330). 1 A.

He has detailed knowledge of Ibn Jawzi's works and all the relevant texts of the Baghdad Hanbali school of the epoch. His vast knowledge comes in useful when he examines the question of authorship: Ibn al-Jawzi is indicated as being the author of the book on the title-page of the manuscript, but the work cannot be found in any list of Ibn al-Jawzi's writings (p. 33). Relying on cross-references in Ibn al-Jawzi's works and contemporary writings by other Hanbali scholars Swartz convincingly proves that Kitab Akhbar as-Sifat (KAS) is one of Ibn Jawzi's latest works, which is known under two different titles in a shorter version too. An Appendix (pp. 282-297) contains the English translation of Abu 51-Fadl al-cAlthi's response to Ibn al-Jawzi's KAS. In addition to the relevance of the treatise as to the question of authorship Swartz is enabled by it to arrive at the conclusion that Abu 'l-Fadl al-cAlthi might have been one of the orthodox Hanbalite scholars who secured the apprehension and banishment of Ibn al-Jawzi. In Swartz's erudite explanation the seemingly unimportant hints in the text appreciate in meaning and become telling sources of new knowledge of Ibn al-Jawzi's life story. My aim with these randomly selected examples is to attempt to convince the interested reader that the book is rich in new results complementing Ibn al-Jawzi's biography, his scientific activities and the history of Hanbalism. As long as Swartz moves in the realm of his research, all his results are reliable and convincing. One of the main aims of the book is to show that when learning to be a scholar Ibn al-Jawzi received a traditional education in rhetoric film al-wacz). Nearly all his life his education determined his attitude to religious sciences on the one hand and his activities as a professor, author of books and a preacher on the other. Nevertheless, as a person who devoted most of his life to his studies and reflection, he gradually changed his attitude towards some crucial questions, including his original negligence of ci7m al-kaldm. Taking KAS as a basis the author proves that Ibn al-Jawzi took a growing interest in rational theology and methods as he was getting on in age. He remained a layman in that field, but his new knowledge changed his view of the traditional Hanbalite doctrines. While giving the most profound characterisation ever of Ibn al-Jawzi and his intellectual development suggesting that the main changes in his attitude are due to the interest he took in rational theology, Swartz fails to raise the question of what made Ibn al-Jawzi turn to rational theology. In note 136 (p. 113) Swartz makes the following comment: "... the kaldm of Ibn al-Jawzi's time was in the process of undergoing something approaching a paradigm shift as a result of the infusion of Avicennian ideas into kaldm, ..." etc. Nevertheless, he himself does not take his own remark seriously and consequently leaves philosophy out of consideration. In paragraph 6 the following translation of the corresponding Arabic text appears: "The Creator of the universe must be an existent (mawjud), for existence and non-existence are polar opposites (mutaqdbildn) between which there is no intermediate mode of being (wdsita). Since it has been established that things must have a cause (fdcil), it is necessary that it be both existent (mawjud) and eternal (qadim), for a [first] cause must be antecedent to what is caused, necessary to its existence and without beginning, for if it had a beginning in time it would itself require a cause (muhdith) and thus form a regressus ad infinitum (tasalsul).^ This passage clearly refers to Ibn Sina's philosophy. The three terms, muhdl al-wujud, mumkin al-wujud on p. 83 of the translation and p. 3 of the Arabic text and wajib al-wujud in the text quoted (mistakenly translated as ''necessary to its existence") is the famous tripartite division of existence serving as starting point for Ibn Sina's metaphysics. Taking the philosophical background to the text into consideration one cannot be sure what the right translation of mutaqdbildn is. The term is well-known in logic as well, having the meaning 'diametrically opposed (contradictory) to each other'. In this case the expression 'between which there is no intermediate mode of being (wdsita)' should rather be explained as a reference to Aristotle's excluded</page><page sequence="3">98 Reviews of Books middle, without any immediate bearing on a Muctazilite or Ashcarite doctrine of existence. The view that a cause (fdcit) is prior in time to its effect is a well-known conviction of the Greek and Arab philosophers.2 Taking Avicenna s philosophy as background to the text into consideration I propose the following translation: "The Creator of the world exists, because existence and non-existence are contradictory to each other without having a middle [term] between them. Since it has been established that He is the maker of things, one necessarily has to say that He exists and He is (...) eternal, because the cause has to precede its effect; He is the Necessary Existent without beginning (of his existence) (in medieval Latin terminology: he is the necessary existent and eternal a parte ante),^/br if He were created, He would need a Creator and so ad infinitum." "The infusion of Avicennian ideas into kaldm\ as Swartz puts it, is not merely a possible footnote in a book, but an all-embracing process in the culture of Islam that resulted in deep changes in all fields of knowledge.3 This change can be observed in Ibn al-Jawzi's text as well. His knowledge of Ibn Sina and his philosophy seems to indicate that his turning to the rational theology was motivated by his growing interest in philosophy and the philosophical ways of argumentation. The differences between the translations as shown above have led to far-reaching consequences. Accepting Swartz s translation one has to identify with his consequences as well: Ibn al-Jawzi did not know philosophy, he merely became an adherent of kalam. Accepting my suggestion one is to take a different approach with the concomitant conclusions: Ibn al-Jawzi became acquainted with philosophy, adopted its rational methods of argumentation, but remained basically suspicious towards kaldm (as it is proved by his text: paragraphs 23-29). This is a hypothesis that should have been raised and examined in the book. One has to bear in mind that Ibn al-Jawzi, the faithful adherent of the traditionalist Hanbalite school, apart from having absorbed self-evident and acquired knowledge,4 ascribes great importance to revelation (naql) and generally accepted tradition (tawdtur)5 as two reliable sources of true knowledge (paragraphs 12-15). In the first chapter of the work, which consists of three parts, the author treats the question of the nature of knowledge. When doing so he adopts many views of the philosophers together with the appropriate terminology,6 but here he adds naql to the sources of knowledge. Naql has no counterpart in philosophical works. He says that caql and naql should be in harmony. In the second and third chapters he examines two kinds o?naql: the relevant passages of the Quran and the Hadith literature. The texts quoted are analysed with rational methods. When elaborating on the proofs of God's existence Ibn al-Jawzi thought that reason was important, but after having accepted his existence, his revelation becomes more important, reasoning appearing to be acceptable only if it does not contradict revelation. This view is similar to that of Ibn Taymiyya on the one hand, and to that of Yehuda Hallewi, on the other. In spite of the calamities he was to face as a person Ibn al-Jawzi paved the way for incessive Hanbalite Muslim theologians and traditionalist Jewish scholars.
