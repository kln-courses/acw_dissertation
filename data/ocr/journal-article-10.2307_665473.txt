<plain_text><page sequence="1">Excavations at Wari, Ayacucho, Peru. WENDELL C. BENNETT. ("Yale University Pub- lications in Anthropology," 49.) New Haven, 1953. 126 pp., 21 figs., 12 plates. $3.00. (Bound with No. 50.) The large habitation site of Wari lies in the Montaro drainage 25 kilometers north of Ayacucho. In recent years there has been an increasing need for an investigation of Wari because it appeared to be the most important center in one of the six major high- land basins of the Central Andes and because of the possibility that it was the center of dispersion for Tiahuanaco influences in the Coastal and North Highland regions of Peru. In 1950 the late Wendell Bennett spent four months making test excavations at Wari and at two related sites on the outskirts of Ayacucho. This report, published</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 647 posthumously, describes and analyzes what he found. Wari covers an area of about 2.25 square kilometers. The extensive refuse deposits containing great quantities of plain and decorated pottery indicate a large resident population. Constructions consist of subterranean chambers of dressed stone associated with walls of split stone; dressed stone alignments; rough stone mounds or platforms with interior open-roofed rooms or courts; stone-faced terraces; large enclosures of rough stone; and rough stone defense walls. Eight anthropomorphic sculptures of stone about a meter high are connected with the site. These statues, the dressed stone work and the mounds with sunken courts are similar to Tiahuanaco sculpture and stone con- structions in Bolivia. The ceramics excavated by Bennett in the Wari refuse fall into the Wari series of plainware, polished redware, smoked blackware, and polychrome wares-including Wari Polychrome Fine, which has clear Tiahuanaco affiliations; Ayacucho Polychrome, which affiliates with the Nazca Y style on the coast; and the Huarpa series, containing Black-on-White and other substyles. Seriation of the pit levels at Wari and the other two sites indicates that the Wari series is earliest, Ayacucho Polychrome overlapping but slightly later, and the Huarpa series post-Wari in time. Bennett prepared a very useful comparative section which shows that the Wari Polychrome Fine style is essentially the Tiahuanacoid style of the Peruvian coast and the Callejon de Huaylas, but that the other ceramic styles of the Wari series are not found associated with the Tiahuanacoid style in other parts of Peru. The Ayacucho Polychrome style is found in the Callejon de Huayles and on the South Coast, particu- larly in the Valley of Nazca. Bennett concluded that the Tiahuanacoid aspects of the Wari style fall in the Peruvian division of Tiahuanaco rather than the Bolivian division or a stylistically intermediate position. He believed that the Wari style developed locally with some Nazca influence, was later strongly influenced by Tiahuanaco, probably through conquest, and that the Tiahuanaco style, as modified at Wari, was then spread to the Coast and North Highland of Peru, in great part through the medium of textiles rather than ceramics. Bennett proposed several lines of research to resolve the Tiahuanaco distribution problem and to clarify the historical position of Wari: (1) a survey of the Montaro Basin to determine the distribution of Wari culture and to find evidence of pre-Wari cultures; (2) a search for Tiahuanaco or Tiahuanaco-influenced sites in the northern Titicaca and Cuzco basins; and (3) the excavation of habitation sites of the Tiahuanaco horizon on the coast in search of evidence on the nature of the cultural processes in- volved in the Tiahuanaco spread. To these may be added the need for additional inves- tigation and excavation at Wari in order to produce a more adequate site map than Bennett was able to obtain, to learn more about the nature and arrangement of the houses, and to recover more information on the nonceramic aspects of Wari culture. A survey of the territory between the Montaro Basin and the Valley of Nazca would also be illuminating. DONALD COLLIER, Chicago Natural History Museum</page></plain_text>
