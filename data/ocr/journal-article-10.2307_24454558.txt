This collection of reflections on nationalism in Ireland, Britain, and further afield represents a record and summation of the evolving thought of the author—a historian so deeply rooted in the English, Irish, and now American academies that his fundamental originality and iconoclasm have sometimes been obscured. The first two essays set the tone for the entire volume and signal the author's deter mination to subject every tradition and interpretation to withering scrutiny. Some will feel uncomfortable, and like Fr. John Ryan, SJ, leave the room (291). In the opening essay, Hugh F. Kearney charts his own intellectual evolution via Peterhouse (Cambridge); University College (Dublin); the Universities of Manchester, Sussex, and Edinburgh; and most recently, the University of Pitts burgh. In the second, Kearney reviews the current state of scholarly writing about nationalism in order to discover models and methods through which to under stand the Irish experience. Kearney will not allow readers to sidestep comparisons with other national experiences by invoking an Irish exceptionalism. Together these two essays constitute an introduction, and the essays which follow are divided into two sections—"Contested Ideas of Nationhood" and "Contested Ideas of National History." Kearney is clearly influenced, but apparently not limited, by the work of Benedict Anderson, Eric Hobsbawm, and Ernest Gellner. Missing in the work of these scholars is a recognition of "the role played by individual decision making" (31). An acknowledged influence on Kearney's thinking is the work of Rogers Brubaker whose 1992 Citizenship and Nationhood in France and Germany proposes contrasting models of civic and ethnic nationalism, a distinction that is central to the author's understanding of the course of modern Irish history. One assertion likely to be particularly unpalatable concerns the claim that Irish nationalism has frequently been dependent on British originals, and that "ethno culturalists in Ireland followed the example of their counterparts in England" (73). When it comes to the "Faith and Fatherland" paradigm of Irish nationalism, so central to Eamon de Valera's Ireland, Kearney exposes this as a construct that emerged in the 1870s, particularly during the 1875 O'Connell centenary celebra tions. Having recognized the achievement of Emmet Larkin in demonstrating the central role of the Roman Catholic Church in the making of modern Ireland, Kearney clearly sees the Catholic Church as one of the "groups who fought" over the memory of O'Connell in the 1870s, and were thus "guilty of trying to use the past for their own purposes" (94).</page><page sequence="2">418 TheHistorian Kearney's sharpest barbs are reserved for Fr. Brendan Bradshaw, whose claims that Catholicism provided the basis for a nationalist ideology from the 1570s are shown to be far from "irresistible" (98). For Kearney, the problem with nation alist history is its need for a "total emotional commitment," thus placing it in polar opposition to academic history, which is open to "a variety of hypotheses" (109). Kearney is at his most pugnacious in the 1994 essay, "The Irish and Their History." Bradshaw is once again taken to task for apparently justifying the dissemination of "bowdlerized history of a paternalist kind" on the grounds that it represents a beneficent legacy (204, 205). Perhaps Kearney is incensed at the attempt to appeal to his own former mentor, Herbert Butterfield, in order to create an Irish version of the Whig interpretation of history. In an essay on "Mercantilism and Ireland, 1620-1640," Kearney criticizes the tendency of some Irish historians to ascribe personality to England and Ireland, rather than recognizing that these were "complex, articulated societies in which different economic interests could create tension" (221). Such anthropomorphism together with the tendency to see English policy as always motivated by "calcu lated Machiavellianism" is "superfluous" to say the least. This varied collection of Hugh Kearney's ruminations on Irish history and the troubled course of Irish historical writing will shed much light—and perhaps also some heat.
