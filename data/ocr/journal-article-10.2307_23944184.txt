<plain_text><page sequence="1">EMOTION, APPETITION, AND CONATUS IN SPINOZA by LEE C. RICE î. Introduction Spinoza's metaphysical system was not a philosophical exercise in its own right. Its motivation was rather that of determining a consistent scientific structure which would include as its substructures both physics and psychology, unified under a single methodology and vision of nature. That the Ethica (') was cast by its author more geometrico should not blind us to the fact that much of its argumentation is programmatic in nature, subject in its completion to the unearthing of further facts (empirical stage) and the subjection of these to the analysis of clear and distinct ideas (analytic stage). The exegesis of Spinoza's system generally proceeds in one of two distinct ways : ex trapolation (whereby the systematic claims are transposed or trans lated into a contemporary philosophical context in order to be con fronted with a ceontemporary problematic) and historical in terrogation (which poses its problems within the philosopher's text, and seeks their resolution within the same text). Recent examples of the former approach are available in the studies of Curley (J), (1) I employ throughout the standard English abbreviated references. "E2P13 Schol." is Ethica 2, Prop. 13, Scholium.

Of the latter approach the earlier works of Hallett (6) and the ongoing work, of Guéroult (7) provide excellent examples. The textual studies reveal a grouping of specific types of questions (without strict segregation) around what Collins calls (8) "two basic poles of historical interrogation" : a fundament which deals with the creative center founded in the work of the in dividual philosopher, and a series of interrelations, these being the thematic contexts of problems determined by other source philo sophers (Descartes being a primary example in Spinoza's case). In this study I wish to analyze and situate a number of central con cepts which arise in Spinoza's development of the origin and nature of human emotion (E3), specifically the concepts of affectw and conatus and the correlative doctrine of appetition which Spinoza sees as following from (or at least consistent with) these. My approach will avoid extrapolation wherever possible, and I shall also avoid the temp tation to integrate the various points of the interpretation into a more global construction within Spinoza's metaphysics. Spinoza's analysis of human appetite follows his treatment of god-nature (Ei), the nature of mind and cognition (Ea), and a brief discussion of the first principles of physics (E2P13, lemmas 1-7) ('). A number of interpretative points aris ing out of these discussions are surveyed below. Though I believe them to be defensible, I shall not here engage myself in their support ; but mention them only as contextual assumptions. An important element of Spinoza's problematic (or its interrelations, to use Collins' distinction) is posed by the Cartesian system. The mechanical physics of Descartes offers an ontology of inert matter (conceived as res externa rather than actio extendendi (l0) whose principle (3) Gail Belaief, Spinoza's Philosophy of Law (Paris: Mouton, 1971).

PPC 2</page><page sequence="3">EMOTION, APPETITION, AND CONATUS IN SPINOZA 103 of motion is always external. Opposed to the inert extension of mat ter, in which only efficient causes operate, thinking substance has its principle of motion within itself ; and, as soul, possesses self determined agency, will, and freedom. Spinozistic monism is achieved by making matter an active principle of explanation, and by extending the model of material efficient causality to that of ideation. At the level of extension the causal interaction of boedies becomes (or is identical with) the implicatory relation among ideas of those bodies. The cause of an idea is the idea of a cause ; or, as Spinoza prefers to say it, "Effectus cognitio a cognitione causae dependet et eamdem in volvit" [E1AX4]. Agency and being are now coextensive, and is nothing the being which does nothing : "Nihil existit, ex cujus natura aliquis effectus non sequatur" [EP136]. It is from this conception of universal agency in Ei that Spinoza develops the schemata of parallelism for ex tension/thought in Ei and E2, however this extensional isomorphism must ultimately be explicated. To be an individual for Spinoza is to be a center of action connected in various ways to a network of individual centers. Being a locus of causal efficacy is a sufficient condition for entering into the network, and the network determines the necessary conditions for being this or that determinate individual. Spinoza develops this causal structure through his analogy of the worm in the bloodstream (Ep. 32) ("), and it commits him to something of a double-standard for causal explana tion. First, causal relations occur among individuals occupying a net work, individuals operating at the same level of complexity ; and we can call this 'parallel causality'. The second, or 'perpendicular', causality is determined by a set of nomological statements whose reference is the whole of which a given individual is a part ; and Spinoza seems to view propositions about the nature of individuals which constitute (and are constituted by) this whole as deductive con sequences of this set (12). These concepts of causal connexivity, agency, and dual causal orders will underlie a number of the more troublesome points which Spinoza must make in his explanation of human interaction.

"Spinoza on Individuation" (op. cit.), 650-653. (12) Ibid., 654-655.</page><page sequence="4">104 L. C. RICE 2. The Affects in General Having completed in E2 a general analysis of the human individual as a mind-body correlation, Spinoza moves in E3 to apply his notion of agency to this finite individual. "I call a cause adequate whose effect can be clearly and distinctly perceived through the same cause ; and inadequate or partial, whose effect cannot be understood the cause alone" [E3D1]. One may object that in this sense only substance is properly the adequate cause of anything, but such an objection misses Spinoza's central point — adequacy refers to parallel orders of causal connection, and not to perpendicular orders. A finite individual is said to be in act when an effect occurs, either internal or external to this individual, whereof it is the adequate cause (,3). The model is that of deductive explanation, Hempel's model in effect : to explain an in dividual event is to posit antecedent events from which the given event may be deduced. The cover laws used in any Hempel model would constitute perpendicular explanation. No individual may wholly determine the nature of another individual, since this other is equally a center of causal efficacy, but a change or effect within an individual may be determined either wholly or partially by another individual ; and one may accordingly make a distinction between the being as agent and the effect as agency. Spinoza tells us that any relatively com plex individual is such that its parts undergo various alterations and interchanges without change in the complex individual (u). Such a change is called an 'effection' by Spinoza, a term which he applies both to any attribute and to the modes comprising an attribute. The term is thus wholly general, but must be carefully distinguished from 'affect' (affectus). By an 'affect' Spinoza wishes to indicate an affection of a body vhereby the agency of this body is either increased or diminished, abetted or coerced ; and the term applies equally to the ideational (13) "Nos tum agere dico, cum aliquid in nobis aut extra nos fit, cujus adaequata sumus causa ... At contra nos parti dico, cum in nobis aliquid fit, vel ex nostra natura aliquid sequitur, cujus nos non nisi partialis sumus causa" [E3 Def. 2]. (14) "Retinet praeterea Individuum sic compositum suam naturam, sive id secundum totum moveatur sive quiescat, sive versus hanc sive versus illam partem moveatur, dum modo unaquaeque pars motum suum retineat, eumque uti antea reliquis communicet" [E2P13, Lemma 7].</page><page sequence="5">EMOTION, APPETITION, AND CONATUS IN SPINOZA 105 correlate of these C5). If we can be the adequate cause of the affect, then by the previous definition of adequacy, the affect constitutes ac tion, otherwise passivity.('*). The English translation of 'affect' as 'emotion' (e.g., by Elwes ; while White preserve the cognate 'affect') encourages two sorts of confusion. First there is the suggestion, Car tesian or even Stoic in origin, that emotions result from body-mind in teraction. Secondly, 'emotion' may suggest passivity, while an affect may be active as well. This second confusion is even aided by Spinoza, who later speaks of the affect as a pathema animi, a restriction to the mind alsoC7). Another question emerges from a critical reading of Spinoza's definitions. If agency and essence are synonymous in Spinoza, augmentation or diminution of the agency or power of an individual would seem to reconstitute a new essence. How, then, can one in dividual (mind or body) be said to be more or less active? I suggest that this question is nothing less than that of the possibility of moral judgement in Spinoza. On Spinoza's own terms there can be no bifurcation of perfection into metaphysical and moral : such is the up shot of thé Appendix to Ei, with its virulent attack on final causes and anthropomorphism. Spinoza's entire problem consists of making in telligible the Ought (augmentation of perfection) and Ought-not (diminution) of the moral project in the context of the Is(necessity) of essence-as-action. The ultimate vindication of the Ethica as ethics would accordingly arise in the transition from E5 to E5. Having formulated it here, I shall have no more to say of it. The notion of 'affect' can be applied directly to the human mind. Thought causes only thought, and consequently the mind must be con ceived as an agent whose action is expressed solely through ideation : idea as agency, opposed to the notion of idea as image ("). Insofar as (15) "Per Affectum intelligo Corporis affectiones, quibus ipsius Corporis agendi poten tia augetur vel minuitur, juvatur vel coërcetur, et simùl harum affectionum ideas" [E3 Def. »]. (16) "Si itaque alicujus harum affectionum adaequata possimus esse causa, tum per Affectum actionem intelligo ; alias passionem" [ibid. ). (17) "Affectus, qui animi pathema dicitur, est confusa idea, qua Mens majorem vel minorem sui Corporis, vel alicujus ejus partis, existendi vim, quam antea, affirmat, et qua data ipsa Mens ad hoc potius quam ad illud cogitandum determinatur" [E3, Explicatio]. (18) Cf. E2 Def. 3.</page><page sequence="6">106 L. C. RICE this agency is adequate (i.e., to the degree that the mind is active), its effects will be correspondingly adequate : it will have adequate ideas ("). There is really nothing to demonstrate here, since everything follows from the definition of adequacy and the notion of all-pervasive agency. The clumsiness of Spinoza's attempt in E2 to characterize the adequate idea arises from the fact that he cannot do so there in terms of the requisite notion of agency. "Per ideam adaequatam intelligo ideam, quae, quatenus in se sine relatione ad ad objectum con sideratur, omnes verae ideae proprietates sive denominationes in trinsecas habet" [E2D4]. What these properties or denominations may be is not mentioned, and there lies the rub ; for it is not until Spinoza reaches E3 that he can delineate them as causal relations. An adequate cause determines its effect, and an adequate idea is deductively fruit fuKproductive of ideas of its appropriate effects). Translated to the level of scientific methodology one may speak with McKeon of Spinoza's deductive pragmatism (20). Finally, the adequate ideas (in sofar as the mind is their adequate cause) are equally adequate in the infinite intellect ; while those which are inadequate in one finite mind are also adequate in the infinite intellect, since this infinite whole con tains within it the adequate cause of any idea which is inadequate in any finite mind (21). Spinoza is not saying that my adequate ideas are adequate in the infinite intelect because this intellect is their cause, but rather because they must have a finite cause within their own order of causation (finite), and this entire order is constituted within the infinite intellect. The appeal to the infinite intellect, as well as the complexity of the general explanations which open E3, are understandable if we realize that Spinoza is here preoccupied with avoiding the temptation to ac count for inadequacy of cognition in terms of corporeal passivity. He (ig) "Mens nostra quaedam agit, quaedam vero patitur ; nempe quatenus adaequatas habet ideas, eatenus necessario agit, et quatenus ideas, eatenus necessario agit, et quatenus ideas habet inadaequatas, eatenus necessario patitur" [E3P1]. (20) Cf. Richard McKeon, "Causation and the Geometrie Method in the Philosophy of Spinoza, " The Philosophical Review XXXIX (1930), 293-294. (21) "Ideae autem, quae in alicujus Mente sunt adaequatae, sunt in Deo adaequa tae ... et quae deinde inadaequatae sunt in Mente, sunt etiam in Deo ... adaequatae, non quatenus ejusdem solummodo Mentis essentiam, sed etiam quatenus aliarum rerum Mentes in se simul continet" [E3P1 Dem.].</page><page sequence="7">EMOTION, APPETITION, AND CONATUS IN SPINOZA 107 would be ready to attest a one-one mapping of the two passivities, but to confuse this mapping or correspondence with the cause of the inadequacy is to revert to Cartesianism ; and it is precisely this con fusion of which he accuses both Descartes and the Stoics in the Preface to E5. At this point in E3 he merely reinforces his own position by reiterating it ("Nec Corpus Mentem ad cogitandum, nec Mens Corpus ad motum, neque ad quietem, nec ad aliquid (si quid est) aliud deter minare potest" [E3P2]). Contrary to Barker's objection ("), there is no "glorification" of body here ; but rather an insistence on Spinoza's part that the logical analysis of causal chains should not degenerate into nonsense or mystery. Anticipating Hume's own critique of the Car tesians, Spinoza declares that any attempted explanation which relies on psychophysical interaction will be empty of meaning : no clear idea of what 'interaction' would mean in this instance is possible in prin ciple ("). Again anticipating Hume, Spinoza notes that the theory of interaction rests ultimately upon an appeal to ignorance : since one cannot fix any limits to the body's power, one merely assumes that such limits would be unable to account for at least some nonempty set of activities going on within it (24). Moreover, if such an interaction were even conceivable, it would wreak havoc with the concept of causal connection ; for, at the level of bodies, causality is a temporal process. But the very simultaneity of corporeal and mental acts would cause the total collapse of any mechanistic account of human be haviour which admitted the existence of mind (25). (22) Cf. H. Barker, "Notes on the Second Part of Spinoza's Ethics," Mind, XLVII (1938), 422. (23) "Deinde nemo seit, qua ratione, quibusve mediis Mens moveat Corpus, neque quot motûs gradus possit Corpori tribuere ... Unde sequitur, cum homines dicunt, hanc vel illam actionem Corporis oriri a Mente, quae imperium in Corpus habet, eos nescire, quid dicant, nec aliud agere, cum speciosis verbis fateri, se veram illius actionis causam absque admiratione ignorare" [E3P2 Schol.]. (24) "Verum ego jam ostendi ipsos nescire, quid Corpus possit, quidve ex sola ipsius naturae contemplatione possit deduci, ipsosque plurima experiri ex solis Naturae legibus fieri, quae nunquem credidissent posse fieri nisi ex Mentis directione" [ibid..]. (25) "Quae omnia profecto clare ostendunt, Mentis tarn decretum, quam appetitum et Corporis determinationem, simul esse natura, vel potius unam eandemque rem, quam, quando sub Cogitationis attributo consideratur, et per ipsum explicatur,..., Deter minationem vocamus" [ibid.].</page><page sequence="8">108 L. C. RICE 3. The Concept of 'Conatus' Each being, to the extent that it exists, is active ; and that act which constitutes its formal essence is the same as that by which it is con served. The peculiar status of 'essence' in Spinozistic metaphysics is that, while requiring a causa existendi by which it comes to be, it then holds its esse in its own right (26). To the formal actuality of an in dividual insofar as it strives for its maintenance within a causal net work (in suo esse perseverare), Spinoza gives the general name of 'conatus' [E3P6]. Between the actual essence and the conatus there is only a distinction of reason (27). Since the finite individual is determined through its interaction with other individuals at a given level of natura naturans, and since finite agency always expresses itself durationally, conatus always involves temporality or duration (J8). We shall shortly examine a number of misinterpretations which result from a failure to appreciate this point. Within Spinoza's physical system conatus is related to the Hobbesian concept of instantaneous motion through a point, whose (great) grandchild will be the Newtonian fluxions (or, more proximately, Leibniz's infinitesimals). Spinoza's physico mathematical intuitions are not as finely developed as Newton's are to become, though he does see (as Hobbes apparently did not) that cor poreal conation is indifferent to the motion or rest of a body. As early as PPC2 Spinoza had urged this point for corporeal action generally. There it is argued that force is no less required for rest than for motion, since no less force is required to move a body than is required to bring it to rest(29). The argument is fallacious, since it depends upon equating explanations of rest with explanations of coming-to rest (cessation of motion). Here, as elsewhere in his physical ex ( 26) Spinoza discusses this point in his example of giving a causal explanation of the existence of twenty men : cf. E1P8 Schol. 2. (27) "Conatus, quo unaquaeque res in suo esse perseverare conatur, nihil est praeter ipsius rei actualem essentiam" [E3P7]. (28) "Conatus ..., nullum tempus finitum, sed indefiniium involvit" [E3P8]. I here take 'tempus' as duration, in keeping with Spinoza's distinction between time (imaginational), and duration (real). That he himself usually ignores the distinction once made is another of many indications that his treatment of temporality is at best incomplete or hesitant. (29) One form of the argument is given in the discussion of local motion which follows PPC2 Def. 8.</page><page sequence="9">EMOTION, APPETITION, AND CONATUS IN SPINOZA 109 planations, Spinoza is on the right track, but supports a sound initial intuition with a poor argument. The Spinozistic concept of 'rest' is not the Aristotelian 'absence-of-motion', but rather the notion of a body maintaining its equilibrium within a closed system (plenum). Insofar as the human mind is identical with its reflexive idea, its proper conatus is a conscious one, and is expressed through its agency, be it adequate or inadequate. The main purpose of Spinoza's use of the term 'conatus' (instead of essentia actualis or vis existendi) seems to be that of underlining the fact that, since finite agents(individuals) are reciprocally determining, their agency always expresses itself in endea vour (it is sometimes successful, sometimes not) ; and this endeavour is, in the words of Hallett (30), durational and fragmentary. Following Ri vaud, we can say that conatus expresses the durational agency of naturated substance : Il y a donc, en chaque être, un point par lequei l'existence et l'essence se touchent. La durée indéfinie, le conatus ... sont les expressions de l'essence où, devenant existence, elle se manifeste dans la durée ... Il entend par là l'essence, pour autant qu'elle est, en chaque être individuel, un principe de vie, une force qui lui assure, autant que le permet l'ordre des causes, une permanence relative (31). Rivaud is correct in drawing from this analysis the conclusion that conatus is always and by its nature finite ("). Lasbax, taking a Platonic turn, tries to speak of a conatus which, meeting no obstacle, is infinite and divine ("). This turn not only violates the spirit of Spinoza's ter minology, but is contrary to his doctrine in its claim that human (or any finite) activity could be 'obstacle-less' : "Vis, qua homo in exis tendo perseverat, limitata est, et a potentia causarum externarum infi nite superatur" [E4P3]. Delbos attempts to read the principle of inertia into the concept of 'conatus' (34), an interpretation which is criticized (30) Cf. H. F. Hallett, Benedict de Spinoza : The Elements of his Philosophy (London : Athlone Press, 1957), 47-48. (31) A.

Delbos, Le spinozisme (Paris: Vrin, 1950), 118-123.</page><page sequence="10">110 L. C. RICE by Darbon (35). Though perhaps Darbon overstates his case, there is this much to be said in its favour : the law of inertia is a cover-law of Spinozistic and Cartesian physics, and as such it is derived from the nature of substance as simple (36). There may be a point to Delbos' parellel, however ; since Spinoza's exposition of centripetal motion (in stantaneous deviation from the tangent), which does utilize the law of inertia in PPC, surely constitutes a physical model of conatus quite analogous to the model proposed by Hobbes ("). There is one additional query which can be raised concerning Spinoza's introduction of 'conatus' ; and that is whether, having rejec ted finality or teleology as a principle of explanation, he is not now reintroducing it trough the back door. Such is the charge offered by Darbon (38). Siwek, in apparent response (39), develops at some length the distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic finality ; and concludes that Spinoza's attack in the Appendix to Ei is directed wholly at the latter. Siwek appears to believe that his own interpretation is sup ported by Spinoza's refusal to predicate either conation or finality to god-substance, but the parallel (or, rather, non-parallel) will not hold. Spinoza refuses to predicate conation of substance simply because, as we have seen, conatus implies duration (40). The entire debate seems ill-conceived, for the ambiguities are not in Spinoza's us of 'conatus', but in the concept of teleology. Causal explanauon for Spinoza, and conatus by extension, is mechanical in this somewhat trite sense : it ex plains an event through its antecedents (i.e., in terms of where it has been, and not where it is going). If one wants to call that 'teleological', then so much the worse for teleology, insofar as it now becomes con sistent with any mechanical explanation whatever. It seems to me that any respectable teleologist would want to deny just this assertion of explanatory isomorphism (as Aristotle was at pains to do) ; and, if this is correct, then conatus is not a teleological concept.

The Theory of Appetition Conatus, the endeavour for self-preservation taken in the widest sense of this term, may be predicated of bodies, of minds, or to body minds (human individuals). For the latter two cases Spinoza provides specific terms : when referred to the mind alone conatus is called 'will' {voluntas), and as applied to body-mind it is called appetite (4I). There follows the celebrated passage on desire (cupiditas) which forms both the nucleus of Spinoza's theory of appetition and the battlefield for generations of commentators : Deinde inter Appetitum et Cupiditatem nulla est differentia, nisi quod cupiditas ad homines plerumque referatur, quatenus sui appetitus sunt conscii, et propterea sic definiri potest, nempe Cupiditas est appetitus cum ejusdem conscientia. Constat itaque ex his omnibus, nihil nos conari, velle, appetere, neque cupere, quia id bonum esse judicamus ; sed contra, nos propterea aliquid bonum esse judicare, quia id conamur, volumus, appetimus, atque cupimus. [E3P9 Schol.]. The terminological shifts which Spinoza is here making have their historical antecedents. Wolfson, for instance, documents Hobbes' usage of cupiditas and voluntas as synonymous with appetitus, and the lat ter as a special case of conatus (42). Further, in the Appendix to E4, Spinoza identifies cupiditas with conatus and refers both to the mind alone. The particularistic sense of voluntas is classical Latin (it occurs, for instance, throughout Cicero's De Finibus) ; and, in both Cicero and Spinoza, this use is indicative of the absence of a faculty-psychology. It is one and the same mens which wills, thinks, imagines, etc. Terminological parallels and shifts aside, however, Spinoza is of fering a substantive theory of appetition ; and his underlining it at this stage in his definitional exposition clearly indicates that he believes it to depart from the received view of human appetite. Common parlance has it, for instance, that men deliberate by contemplating a variety of alternadves, are attracted by elements of some and repelled by still others ; and that the choice in favour of one is determined by an understanding (decision?) of its overall attractiveness vis-à-vis the (41) "Hic conatus, cum ad Mentem solam refertur, Voluntas appellatur, sed cum ad Mentem et Corpus simul refertur, vocatur Appeitus ..." [E3P9 Schol.]. (42) Cf. H. A. W01.FS0N, The Philosophy of Spinoza (N.Y. : Meridian, 1958), II, 203-204.</page><page sequence="12">112 L. C. RICE other possible choices. Broad claims that Spinoza is simply reversing this causal model (43). According to Broad, Spinoza's claim is that we do not desire things because the prospect of them attracts us, but rather that the prospect of certain things attracts us because we are already impelled by them ; and still other things repel us because we have an impulse contrariwise. Of course Broad's reading could mean no more than that the source of attractiveness or repulsiveness lies on the side of the object (i.e., certain elements, parts, properties which it has) ; but, since this would reduce to the ordinary reading, he must have something else in mind. A clue is provided in his remark that the same theory has recently been proposed by contemporary psycho analysis as a new discovery {**). The psychoanalytic version usually espouses some version of epiphenomenalism ; but, shorn of this dubious explanatory ingredient, it goes something like the following. Some interactions occur in which the person is passive (or un conscious) ; and, as a result of this, additional trigger mechanisms arise which direct the subject to certain goals. Motivational explanation of these goals is rationalization, since the goals are determined by non motivational (subconscious) mechanisms. It is difficult to see how this model can be transplanted into Spinoza's system and remain in telligible (assuming even that it is intelligible before the transplant) ; for what would these causal mechanisms be in the absence of psycho physical interaction? The difficulty lies in the way that Spinoza relates his two terms : the judgement ("id bonum esse judicamus") and the appetition. What he wants to deny is that the judgement is the cause of the appetition : it is not the case that "appetimus, quia judicamus. " What is asserted is that "judicamus, quia appetimus." If the second ywM-clause denotes a causal sequence (the converse of the one denied by Spinoza in the first quia-clause), then Spinoza is asserting body-mind interaction and deny ing mind-body interaction ; but either alternative is flatly inconsistent with his insistence that the two orders of extension and ideation are (43) C. D. Broad, Five Types of Ethical Theory (Patterson : Littlefield, Adams and Co., '959&gt;. 24-26. (44) Ibid., 24 : "It is amusing to notice that this is precisely the theory which Mr. Ber trand Russell puts forward in his Analysis of Mind as a wonderful new discovery which we owe to the Psycho-analysts".</page><page sequence="13">EMOTION, APPETITION, AND CONATUS IN SPINOZA 113 each closed (causally) and complete) (in the order of explanations). A reading which is more consistent with the general direction of Spinoza's anti-interactionism would see the quia-clause as being in ap position : not a causal link, but rather an equivalent expression. Under this proposed reading, Spinoza is saying that the relation between the judgement (i.e., the idea of this or that as a good) is not the cause of the appetite (the corporeal conation with its corresponding ideate), but that the two are simply equivalent in their reference : both refer to one and the same activity, one in the order of thought and the other in the order of extended being. Ideational conation (in this case, the judgement that something is good) is conscious and has as its causal antecedents other ideas (whether these be conscious or not) ; whereas extensional conation, the attraction of the body to another body in ac cordance with the laws of motion and rest, is always caused by the ideates of the ideational causes (never by the ideas themselves). Under such a reading we get the attractive consequence that some motiv ational explanations (those which proceed from adequate ideas) are adequate, and others (proceeding from inadequate ideas) are ration alizations. A rationalization, however, is a false statement arising out of inadequate ideas, not a meaningless statement arising out of the myth of mind-body interaction. This interpretation of Spinoza is similar to Skinner's reinterpretation of James (45). The analogy is not accidental ; since Skinner's point, which I hope to have shown con sistent with Spinoza, also strikes me as clearly correct. The Spinozistic affect is a passage from one quantitative degree of perfection to another. I have argued elsewhere (46) that the quan titative measures imposed by Spinoza upon perfection or being should be taken in the strictest possible sense, as indicative of the inner struc ture of reality ; since this shift from qualitative structure (Aristotle) to the quantitative is at the heart of the new Galilean method partially (45) cf. B. F. Skinner, Beyond Freedom and Dignity (N.Y. : Alfred A. Knopf, 1972), 13 : "... we do not run away because we are afraid, but are afraid because we run away. In other words, what we feel when we feel afraid is our behavior ... But how many of those who have considered James's argument have noted that no antecedent event has in fact been pointed out? Neither 'because' should be taken seriously. No explanation has been given as to why we run away and feel afraid."

Note, then, in accordance with the preceding analysis, that appetite, desire, or will may denote passage from lesser to greater quanta of perfection, or from greater to lesser (augmen tation or diminution). It is of cardinal importance here not to confuse the concept of augmentation of perfection with Spinoza's concept of 'action' ; for this latter concept is characterized in terms of whether or not the subject is the adequate cause of the effect, not whether that ef fect is augmentative in nature. A clear reading of the distinction be tween action and augmentation would, I suggest, shed considerable light upon Spinoza's discussion of servitudo (in the Ethica and in the political tractates) as well as the Spinozistic conception of the structure of moral judgement. To the passive state wherein the mind passes to a greater perfection Spinoza gives the name 'pleasure' (laetitia), and to its converse 'pain' (tristitia). To their corporeal equivalents he in turn gives the names titillatio or hilaritas, and dolor or melancholia, noting also that the first elements of these pairs may also be used to refer to passages involving segments of the body and excluding other parts (47). Beyond these three primary affects, Spinoza tells us that he recognizes no further primary passions [P3P1 iSchol]. It would be incorrect to assume from this statement that he here opposes Descartes, who recognized six sim ple and primitive passions (l'Admiration, la Haine, le Désir, lajoye, la Tristesse, l'Amour) (48) since it is primitive, passive affects with which Spinoza here deals, and not affects in his more general sense of this term. In E3P1 iSchol Spinoza makes a point of mentioning this, while in the Appendix to E3 he simple refers to them as primary affects without further qualification (49). We have already seen his tendency to take 'affect' in its narrower sense as pathema animi. In the wider sense of the term, there will be additional primary affects (active) ; and (47) "Per Laetitiam itaque in sequentibus intelligam passionem, qua Mens ad majorem perfectionem transit. Per Tistitiam autem passionem, qua ipsa ad minorem transit per fectionem. Porro affectum Laetitiae, ad Mentem et Corpus simul relatum, Titillationem vel Hilaritatem voco ; Tristitiae autem Dolorem vel Melancholiam. Sed notandum, Tiüllauonem et Dolorem ad hominem referri, quando una ejus pars prae reliquis est af fecta, Hilaritatem autem et Melangcholiam, quando omnes pariter sunt affectae" [E3P11 Schol.].

The above considerations also provide a resolution to an objection presented by Bidney, based upon Spinoza's identification of desire with conscious conation. "At the same time, however, Spinoza also regards desire as one of the three primary affects or passions. The question now arises, if desire is the essence of man how can it also be an affect?" (50). The answer again lies in Spinoza's terminological shifts. Conatus as desire is identified with human nature insofar as this desire is active (in the degree whereof man is its adequate cause) ; but, as a passion, it is not identified with human nature, nor with conatus ; since essence or nature is always for Spinoza, as we have seen, essentia actuosa. My own conjecture is that this identification also explains the terminological shift in the meaning of affect' ; since Spinoza would probably say that desire, insofar as it is not identical with the nature of man, is by that very fact passive. If desire as active (i.e., conatus) is expressed in the continuous effort of the individual to conserve itself, then in at least one sense conation is directed less at augmenting perfection than at maintaining a given level. This is Hallett's conclusion (51) : Conscious of its finitude each fluctuating mode suffers continual change, which it as continually resists so far as it can, i.e., so long as it exists. This change and the striving against change are experienced as joy or sorrow and desire respectively. Yet the sequence of propositions in E3 finds Spinoza claiming that conatus tends to promote the continuance of pleasure and to resist pain. There is, accordingly, in the dialectic of human action and reac tion a continually accumulative or augmentative drive. Hallett's point would have been more correctly made by stating that this accumula tive drive (pleasure), while maintained by agency, may itself be passive. In a context other than that of Spinozistic metaphysics, this latter claim impinges upon the nonsensical. That it is not so for Spinoza brings one face to face with his general conception of human nature and action, a few remarks about which may be made in closing. (50) D.

RICE The historical context against which Spinoza operates, and which he criticizes at numerous points in the Ethica, is the vision of man as microcosm — the Stoic inner man clothed by Descartes in Galilean robes. Under this vision man achieves through independence from other agencies operative in the universe. Against this positioning of man against the environing universe Spinoza notes that : 1) the model is cosmologically unsound, for man is but a part of nature and is deter mined to be and to act by the environing universe, and 2) the model leads to an ethics of separatism and ultimately despair (since it coun sels the impossible). Human action for Spinoza (and accordingly human nature) is accumulative and interactive, and the finite mode which is human 'stuff is what it is through the determining conditions which surround it. Action is possible within this matrix of deter minations only by being passive with respect to those conditions whch augment the finite quantum of energy (motion/ rest) by which relative auto-determination becomes possible. The physical concept of rest as equilibrium has its correlate in the notion of the human person as a lo cus of power or agency which 'holds its own' within the determining matrix which Spinoza calls nature. Perhaps ultimately there is a sense in which this conception of human striving and interaction can be called teleological ; and, if it arises out of his conception of universal agency, perhaps Spinoza was indeed the first genuine teleologist. Given the fact that much of contemporary philosophy still moves un der the notion of will as autonomous, free, or independent (what Spinoza would call a 'microcosmic' view), it may well be that he was also the last.</page></plain_text>
