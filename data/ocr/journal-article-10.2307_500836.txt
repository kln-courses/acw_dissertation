<plain_text><page sequence="1">American Journal of Archaeology Vol. 56, No. 1 (January, 1952) ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS THE NEAR EAST, 1950-1951 WILLIAM STEVENSON SMITH, Editor PLA TES 1-4 THE preparation of the "Archaeological News" has been taken over from Miss Ann Perkins in the summer of 1951 while the new editor was in Cairo as Director of the American Research Center in Egypt. Consequently it has been possible to write of certain things from first hand experience. Circumstances have not been so favorable for obtaining information from other parts of the Near East. It is hoped that a better balanced distribution of news can be achieved in the next report. EGYPT At Saqqara Jean-Philippe Lauer, Architect of the Department of Antiquities, has nearly completed the reconstruction of the entrance gate to the Step Pyra- mid complex. The visitor now driving along the dike road approaching the desert escarpment gains an impression of how the enclosure wall stood up against the sky line with the Step Pyramid towering above it. This has long been evident from Lauer's ingenious drawings but can now be experienced to a considerable extent in actuality. Lauer has finished some subsidiary clearance work in connection with the pyramid of the first king of Dynasty V, Weserkaf, which stands at the north-east corner of the Step Pyramid enclosure. The temple was excavated by Cecil Firth in 1927-1928 but the re- covery of the original plan was made difficult by several huge Saite tombs which had been cut into the site. Lauer has been preparing this Saite material for publication and in 1947 it was possible for him to publish an augmented version of the Weserkaf temple plan (ASAE [Annales du Service des Antiquites de l'Egypte] 46 [1947] 251). He has now succeeded in determining the arrangement of the entrance system on the east and the relation of the south-east corner of the badly ruined pyramid to the temple and to a small chapel which lay in the middle of the east face of the pyramid. A number of fragments of the temple reliefs have been added to those found by Firth, and a few blocks which were discovered during the war. The present writer has been engaged in drawing these reliefs for a publication which is projected by the Antiquities Department. In spite of their fragmentary nature they contain a variety of lively details em- ployed here for the first time. Several recently dis- covered pieces can be reconstructed as a large boat propelled by groups of men who raise and lower their paddles in rhythmic order. Birds and trees are wonder- fully depicted in an orchard scene. The workmanship continues the finest traditions of Dynasty IV. The material supplements the better preserved reliefs of Sahura, Unas and Pepy II and may prove of assist- ance in identifying the Old Kingdom blocks built into the pyramid of Amenemhat I at Lisht. It is pleasant to be able to report that other monu- ments at Saqqara are receiving the attention they deserve, although the excavated material is so great that it will be long before it can be adequately re- corded and published. The Sixth Dynasty mastaba of Khenty-kha, otherwise known as Ikhekhy, has been completed in the spring of 1951 for the Egypt Ex- ploration Fund by Michael Apted and T. G. H. James with the assistance of draughtsmen of the Depart- ment of Antiquities. The Department is having draw- ings prepared of the painted reliefs of the Vizier Mehu whose tomb was found by Zaki Saad during the war near the causeway to the Unas Pyramid. Early in 1951 Jean St. Fare Garnot of the University of Paris began a study of the Pyramid Texts in the tomb of King Tety. With Lauer he completed the clearance of the outer chamber. Many new fragments of the texts were recovered. It is hoped in a future campaign to clear away the debris which is still piled high in the burial apartment leaving only a portion of the sarco- phagus visible. Finally, Lauer has examined a group of monuments so different in spirit that one comes upon them with startled surprise in the sand of Saqqara. These are the statues which in classical times lined the entrance to the Serapeum. With the processional way of sphinxes and a structure erected by Nectanebo in Dynasty XXX these first indicated to Mariette the location of the now much visited catacomb which con- tained the burials of the sacred Apis bulls. Mariette first excavated these statues in 1851. They were cleared again in 1938-1939 by R. Macramallah only to be covered once more by the sand. Recently Lauer 39</page><page sequence="2">40 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [AJA 56 discovered in the Paris Bibliotheque Nationale the plan of the dromos on which Mariette had indicated the position of the various statues. This had not been available to Maspero when he published Mariette's papers on the Serapeum after his death. Since the statues were illustrated only by drawings in this publi- cation, Lauer undertook to clear and photograph them for a study which is being prepared by M. Charles Picard of the Academie des Inscriptions et Belles- Lettres. Pl. 1,A illustrates the exedra, emerging from the sand under Mariette's old house, with its group of famous Greek men of letters, including Pindar, Homer, Protagoras and Plato. P1. 2,A shows a Dionysus astride a lion flanked by peacocks which, with their spreading tails and bunches of grapes, seem to epitomize the frivolity and fantastic luxury of the Ptolemaic court, even more sharply by contrast with their desert setting. On the bench which stood on the opposite side of the paved way was a figure of Cerberus (pl. 1,B). As Lauer points out, the presence of Dionysiac processions and a group of philosophers illustrate the efforts toward syncretism on the part of the Ptolemies who endeavored to create a divinity as much Greek as Egyptian. They combined Osiris- Apis with the Serapis of Sinope on the Black Sea--a god considered by the Greeks to be Dionysus and, in the Hellenistic Period, a patron of intellectual life. Dr. Ahmed Fakhry has taken up the direction of a project to study the Old Kingdom pyramid fields which the late Abdessallam M. Hussein initiated by the excavation of the valley temple of Unas, the identifi- cation and clearance of the pyramid of the Dynasty V king Zedkara-Isesy and the investigation of the in- terior of the two stone pyramids at Dahshur which were for the first time certainly identified as being the work of Sneferu, the first king of Dynasty IV. Dr. Fakhry, who has for some years been concerned with a survey of the oases of the Western Desert, published early in the summer of 1951 a work of great interest to students of early Christian architecture and paint- ing: The Necropolis of El-Bagawat in Kharga Oasis. He has also completed for publication the results of a survey of the monuments of southern Arabia which he made in the Yemen in 1947, as well as a study of the important rock inscriptions at the amethyst quarries of the Eastern Egyptian Desert in the Aswan region. In the spring of 1951, Fakry began the clearance of the area at the foot of the east face of the so-called Bent Pyramid at Dahshur, the southern of the two pyramids of Sneferu. Almost immediately he came upon the remains of a small brick temple enclosing an altar covered by a roof supported by heavy stone walls. Behind this construction, on each side, are the bases of two stone monoliths, the whole arrangement sug- gesting the small temple at Medum with its round- topped stelae in a court at the base of the pyramid. Inscribed fragments giving the name of Sneferu in huge hieroglyphs were found near the surface above the monoliths. The inscriptions on two offering basins of a later date give evidence of a cult of Sneferu. The brick rooms and the covered altar were clearly modi- fied at a later time but the date and purpose of this re-building remain obscure, especially since the pottery found in the rooms seems to be of the Fourth Dynasty. It is also difficult to suggest what was the original position of the inscribed fragments, although it is tempting to try to place these as the upper part of two huge round topped stelae with the Horus frame con- taining the king's name. However, part of his car- touche name also exists and the titulary would have been more developed than the simpler representations on the much smaller round topped stelae of Dynasty I. It is to be hoped that next season's excavations within the enclosure will throw some light on these problems. One also looks forward eagerly to the prom- ised excavation of the valley temple, the site of which has long been known. The Bent Pyramid continues to prove itself one of the most enigmatic structures of the Old Kingdom. However, like the whole Dahshur region, it promises to reward excavation by providing vital evidence for the very important period of transi- tion between the civilization of Dynasty III, as illus- trated at Saqqara, and the fully developed Fourth Dynasty at Giza. In the cemetery west of the Great Pyramid at Giza Abdel Monem Abubakr Bey, with the assistance of Sami Shenouda, continued during the winter of 1950- 1951 the clearance of the area which lies to the north- west of the former Harvard-Boston excavations. He was rewarded by the discovery of important objects and well preserved examples of architectural detail. Particularly interesting was the identification of the large stone mastaba of Persen which had been partly cleared by Lepsius in the last century and then buried again. The bold reliefs in the chapel have been hitherto known only from rather summary sketches. Around the tomb is a complicated series of subsidiary constructions inside a panelled enclosing wall laid out in a manner with which one has not been familiar at Giza (pl. 2,B). From one of these subsidiary tombs came the statue of an Old Kingdom scribe. It is of exceptionally fine quality and the painted surfaces are perfectly preserved (pl. 3,A). This statue and the reliefs on two limestone false-doors found in a previous season's work add significantly to the important body of sculpture from the Giza cemeteries. The carved stone decoration let into the brick mastabas in this area is consistent in style with that in neighboring parts of the field excavated by Fisher, Junker and Reisner. Beginning, apparently, late in the Fourth Dynasty these reliefs conservatively carry on into a fairly late period of the Old Kingdom an almost</page><page sequence="3">1952] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS 41 archaic manner of carving and representation. They also exhibit unusual hieroglyphs and rare word forms. Immediately across the river from Saqqara, between the Wady Hof and the modern town of Helwan, is a region which has for a number of years become in- creasingly important for the early history of Egypt. A long sequence of man's development has appeared in a series of Palaeolithic and Mesolithic stations,' a prehistoric village and cemetery,2 and the remarkable cemetery of the First and Second Dynasties at Ezbet el Walda. In the peculiarly dry Helwan air, the imagina- tion is both stimulated and staggered by the immense time range presented by the topographical features visible from the prehistoric village site of El Omari. Standing under the eastern cliffs one looks down the gently sloping desert ground across the Early Dynastic Cemetery of Ezbet el Walda, then over the river and the palm groves that conceal ancient Memphis to the Step Pyramid at Saqqara and, a little to the south, the Dahshur Pyramids. A rocky promontory divides El Omari from the Wady Hof, beyond which to the north lie the Turah stone quarries and a large pre- historic village site at Maadi. Zaki Yusuf Saad has carried out another season's work at Ezbet el Walda in the winter of 1950-1951. This year he has been fortunate in finding a few of the superstructures of the tombs which, although not preserved to a very great height, show that the large Dynasty I tombs were panelled in a form well known at this time. In one case the thick retaining wall for the gravel filling has this so-called "palace-fagade" panelling on the outside and a series of simple support- ing buttresses on the inside. The burial chamber had been covered with wood over which were laid small roofing slabs of stone. Another mastaba has a plain niche at the southern end of the western face which served as the offering place. There are several other interesting pieces of evidence for the origin of the offering chapel which make one hope that more traces of the superstructures of these Dynasty I and II tombs will be found. The publication of the 1945-1947 season's work in the royal excavations at Helwan appeared in the spring of 1951 as Cahier No. 14, Supplement to the Annales du Service des Antiquite's de l'Egypte, and Zaki Saad is at work on a publication of the inscribed tablets with a scene of the owner of the tomb seated at a table of bread. These are dated by him to Dynasty II and were found in the burial chamber fitted into the mouth of a tiny vertical shaft that ran up to the surface of the ground. In form and subject matter they resemble the inscribed tablets called by Reisner "primitive niche stones" which were used in the offer- ing niches of the early brick mastabas at Saqqara and seem to anticipate the tablet of the traditional false-door. Some fifteen of these have now been found at Helwan and form the largest group of such archaic inscriptions known. They are only a part, however, of the fascinating objects-for example a very large crystal bowl and a small carving of a Min-emblem with a pair of sacred eyes placed sideways on its central round element-which continue to appear in these important excavations. Fernand Debono worked again in the spring of 1951 on a section of the prehistoric village site of El Omari. This consisted of small semi-circular sleeping shelters of matting erected on wooden stakes and accompanied by granaries sunk in the ground. A num- ber of graves appear to have been dug in the emplace- ments of the huts after these had fallen into disuse. The body lay in a contracted position with the head to the south and facing west. Only one small pot was placed in the grave near the face. In several places there is clear evidence of two periods of occupation. In the floor of the Wady to the north a layer of a much larger village has been revealed in a section cut away by water which runs down after the rains in the winter. At Heliopolis, to the north of Cairo, Debono con- tinued in the summer of 1950 to clear the prehistoric cemetery which was reported in our last issue. It had been discovered near the north-east corner of the race-course during the construction of some new build- ings. This work was carried out under the supervision of Zaki Nour, Keeper of the Pyramids Cemetery. In this case the bodies lay in oval graves with their heads to the north and the face east. On the edge of the cemetery were several graves of dogs, almost as though they had been placed there to guard it. Burials of gazelles were accompanied by pottery vessels. Amongst other objects found was a small ledge- handled vessel of basalt. The importance of this ceme- tery lies in its evidence of the occupation in Pre- dynastic times of a site later so important in Egyptian religious history. It also adds welcome material to the as yet little known early culture of the Delta. In the eastern Delta Prof. P. Montet conducted another of his many campaigns on the great site of Tanis. He worked also at Behbit el Hagar (Iseum) on the Damietta Branch of the Nile. He was joined toward the end of the 1951 spring season by J. Leclant who had assisted him for a part of the previous season. In the region north of Assiut, some twelve kilometers from the town of Manfalut on the edge of the Western Desert, J. Vercoutter has taken up the work at Dara initiated by Raymond Weill3 in a preliminary survey in 1946 and a season's excavation in the winter of 1946- 1947. Vercoutter was assisted by Fernand Debono. A number of late Old Kingdom tombs were excavated. From these came characteristic objects: head-rests,</page><page sequence="4">42 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [AJA 56 small statuettes and several stone cases in the shape of birds, made to contain food offerings. In the Fayum a joint expedition of the University of Geneva and the French Institute at Cairo exca- vated a large Roman fortress at Qasr Qarun (Dionys- ias) at the south-western corner of the lake.4 The work was under the direction of Prof J. Schwartz with the collaboration of Alexander Bedawy of Fouad Ist Uni- versity who is undertaking the study of the archi- tectural material. His plan and drawings show a fortress somewhat similar to that investigated at El Kab some years ago.5 The building is of the time of Diocletian. Its peculiar feature is a colonnade which leads from the entrance gate to a raised shrine with an apse against the southern fortress wall. This shrine contained a statue of the Tyche of the Emperor. The whole suggests an anticipation of the nave and apse of an early Christian church and in plan closely re- sembles a basilica. The colonnade, however, was prob- ably open to the air and is like the columned streets found in Syrian cities. Two richly ornamented com- posite capitals were found which should prove im- portant for the study of Coptic architectural sculpture. Significant also in the field of classical remains in Egypt is the work which Farouk Ist University at Alexandria is carrying on at Hermopolis (Eshmunein) in Middle Egypt. The site is inevitably less spectacular in appearance than the cemetery of Hermopolis (Tounah el Gebel) where Prof. Sami Gabra of Fouad Ist University in Cairo is still continuing his investiga- tions. Unlike the marvelously preserved brick struc- tures in the desert at Tounah, the buildings at Her- mopolis are badly ruined. Prof. Alan Wace has been engaged in the study of the basilica there. Like the buildings in the Agora and the earlier structures of Dynastic times, this presents difficult problems of reconstruction. At Dendera F. Daumas of the French Institute, with the assistance of the draughtsman, Mme. Lamon, continued during the winter of 1950-1951 to record the Temple of Hathor. The drawings of the Birth House of Nectanebo have been collated, the texts of the Roman Birth House copied and the drawing of the scenes commenced. Work on the crypts of the main temple has gone forward, Chassinat's manu- script being checked with the original. The result is that Vol. VI of the Great Temple is now ready, while the manuscript of the Nectanebo Birth House is com- plete and the text of the Roman Birth House finished. Various inscribed stones in the temple enclosure have also been photographed. These go back to the Old, Middle and New Kingdoms and support statements concerning the age of the temple in the Ptolemaic texts. One fragment of a seated statue of Pepy I has carved in bold relief on the back of the throne a Horus frame containing the royal name. This reminds one of the similar decoration on the back of the alabaster statuette of the same king in the Brooklyn Museum. For Dendera and the following sites in Upper Egypt a great part of the information has been drawn from a detailed report which M. Jean Leclant of the French Institute in Cairo has been good enough to supply again this year. At Assuan, Labib Habashi, Chief Inspector of An- tiquities, while clearing the stairway approach to the tomb of the Caravan Leader Khunes, discovered a painted tomb of an Overseer of Foreign Lands, Setka, amongst a number of other tombs of the First Inter- mediate Period. It contains, besides the more usual scene showing the owner and his wife inspecting their estate, a representation of Nubian warriors and a hunter with gazelles and wild asses. Restoration work has also been undertaken in the tomb of Heqa-ib and in his sanctuary on the Island of Elephantine where it has been decided to leave in place the remarkable group of statues discovered earlier. At Luxor, H. Chevrier, director of works in the great temple of Karnak, has continued to add to the number of blocks from earlier structures which have been sorted and arranged in the vast space north of the first court and in the magazines south of this court. The thousands of inscribed stones from a temple of Akhenaten which have been drawn out of the Second Pylon in previous seasons, and the numerous reliefs, particularly of Hatshepsut and Amenhotep I, have now been increased by many more pieces from the Third Pylon belonging to buildings of Sesostris I, Amenhotep I, Tuthmosis II, Tuthmosis IV and Amenhotep III, as well as fragments of a new stela of Ahmose. There has been some clearance in the area of the Middle Kingdom court where several blocks from the granite sanctuary of Philip Arrhidaeus were found. However, the chief work of the 1950-1951 season was undertaken inside the eastern gateway around the colonnade of Taharqa and north of this in the north- east corner of the brick enclosure wall of Nectanebo. The approach to the Osiris temple built against this wall was found to be lined with chapels in the same manner as the way from the Hypostyle Hall north to the Temple of Ptah. All this area was devoted to Osiris, the chapels being dedicated to different aspects of the God. The buildings seem to range from about the reign of Osorkon II, whose grandson named Takelot decorated one of the chapels with interesting reliefs, into the period of the Divine Consorts of Amen of Kushite (Ethiopian) and Saite times. Late in the spring of 1950 the study was completed of the so-called building of Taharqa which adjoins the sacred lake on the south of the main temple. It has been established that this was constructed of stones re-employed from a building of that king's predecessor, Shabako. The original building was connected by a</page><page sequence="5">1952] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS 43 court with a stairway leading down into the lake with an inscribed gateway where Shabako's name and double uraeus have been erased by Psamtik II.6 Also belonging to this structure was the covered and in- scribed staircase descending to water level at right angles to the lake and mis-named a "Nilometer." A. Varille has been engaged in clearing the small temple of Epet beside the Khons temple. Here blocks have been re-employed from earlier buildings ranging in date from Tuthmosis III to Taharqa. The Ptolemaic crypts have been cleared for photographing and it has been determined that the western forepart of the temple probably dates from the XXXth Dynasty. At North Karnak C. Robichon, assisted by J. Leclant and P. Barguet, has continued the patient dissection of the various levels under the northern part of the Ptolemaic structure of the Temple of Montu down to the gate of the building of the time of Amenhotep III. This work of Robichon's for the French Institute has for some years provided a model of ingenious excavation technique for the recovery of architectural evidence. The foundations for the Ptole- maic portico consist of re-employed blocks packed into trenches cut through older structures (pl. 3,D). Earlier, Taharqa had laid down two masses of similar foundation blocks for his colonnade. The drums of the columns from this structure were in their turn used to fill the Ptolemaic trenches. A number of fine pieces of sculpture were found in the area along the axis of the entrance to the temple. Among others were a kneeling statue of the Middle Kingdom King, Amenemhat III (pl. 3,B), a seated figure of Amenhotep II (pl. 3,C) and a cubical squatting figure of Mentuem- hat, Governor of Thebes at the time of the Assyrian invasion, whose tomb in Western Thebes is at present being cleared. The foundations this year were not productive of blocks from the building of the Kushite princesses, but there were parts of a delightful scene of dancers and musicians in a papyrus thicket which are reminiscent of the Kushite reliefs found at Medamud in 1930. The way leading up to the Ptole- maic portico which covered the obelisk bases and pylon of Amenhotep III was lined with sphinxes set against brick walls. Here, amongst other remains of New Kingdom statues, were found many pieces of two quartzite figures of Amenhotep III. In the autumn of 1950, Zakaria Goneim, Chief Inspector of Antiquities, took up again the clearance of the forecourt of the Luxor Temple which Nectanebo I had laid out in front of the pylon of Ramesses II. In January, 1951, were laid bare a fifth pair of the human headed sphinxes which Nectanebo had erected to form an avenue leading to Karnak (pl. 4,A). In the north-west corner of the brick forecourt was excavated a peripteral chapel on a brick platform which constituted a small Serapeum containing a statue of Isis, a headless figure of Serapis and a Canopic Osiris. Nearby was found a stela of Tiberius, while a lintel bore an inscription dated in the tenth year of Hadrian, recording a restoration made by Gaius Julius Antoninus in honor of the Emperor. In front of the Ramesses II pylon the foundations of the Paris obelisk were examined, while a granite pavement was found, leading to the entrance in the pylon, which had supported a "kiosk" of the Kushite king Shabako. Elements from this colonnade were used to pave the first vestibule of the sanctuary at the south end of the temple in Roman times when the flooring was raised and the building used first as a kind of imperial chapel and later as a Christian church. These re-employed materials have been identified and are being recorded by Mlle. L. Lamy. Evidently Shabako's "kiosk" resembled the well known colonnade of Taharqa in the forecourt of the Karnak temple, as well as the two others which have been mentioned earlier, one inside the eastern enclosure wall and the other in front of the Temple of Montu. In the Theban Necropolis Zakaria Goneim con- tinued, in the winter of 1950-1951, to work on the clearance of the enormous tomb of Mentuemhat, the Governor of Thebes at the end of the Ethiopian period. About fifteen Carian graffiti were discovered, a few on the statues of the owner and his wife in the south niche of the east wall of the court but most of them on the north side of the court on the lower part of the stems of the huge carved papyrus flowers which are such a distinctive feature of this part of the tomb. Copying of the scenes and texts is being undertaken by Goneim, Barguet and Leclant with a view to publication. M. B. Bruybre has completed the huge collection of ostraca which he has been extracting from the great pit at Deir el Medineh since 1949. During the season of 1950-1951 he also excavated on the side of the hill of Qurnet Murai facing the Ptolemaic Hathor temple. This part of the cemetery was first occupied in the reign of Tuthmosis I and continued to be re-used and despoiled down into Coptic times. From about a dozen tombs and houses cleared here were recovered fragments of hieratic papyri and some 270 Ramesside ostraca which complement the material in Turin exca- vated by Schiaparelli in this area in 1905. M. A. Stoppelaijre, assisted by Ahmed Youssef Moustafa, Rushdi Hassanein and Aly Bahgat have carried forward their work of consolidation and clean- ing in the Theban tombs. Walls have been strength- ened, fragments replaced and the paintings cleansed of layers of dirt in the tombs of the Vizier Rekhmira (No. 100), in Panehesy (No. 16), Userhet (No. 51), Nakht (No. 52), Khaemhet (No. 57) where casts supplied by the Berlin and Boston Museums were fitted into place, and Amenuser (No. 131).</page><page sequence="6">44 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [AJA 56 The vast walls of Ramesses the Third's temple of Medinet Habu still occupy the greater part of the efforts of the staff of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago under the direction of Dr. George Hughes. Work is also continuing on the decora- tions of the Bubastite Gate at Karnak. Charles F. Nims has found time to photograph in color many important details in the Theban tombs. Nims has also photographed astronomical ceilings in the royal tombs of the Valley of the Kings, as well as in the huge and difficult private tomb of Pedamenope. This was part of a project to study astronomical material which Richard A. Parker was undertaking during a leave of absence from Brown University. Parker, accom- panied by Nims, also examined the material at Dendera and at Salamfini near Sohag where five un- recorded zodiacs of the first or second centuries A.D. were added to the growing body of evidence. In this vital field of recording Egyptian monuments should be mentioned A. Piankhoff's study of the re- ligious texts and scenes in the Valley of the Kings, particularly concentrated upon the tomb of Ramesses VI. In conjunction with the French Institute he has also completed for publication the religious texts on the shrines of Tut-ankh-amen. S. Sauneron of the French Institute has commenced work on the in- scriptions of the Temple of Esna. P. Gilbert and A. Mekhitarian of the Fondation Reine Elisabeth in Brussels, after spending some time working over ma- terial from previous seasons' work at El Kab, devoted a part of their visit to photographing details in the Theban Tombs. In the Cairo Museum, Mrs. Nina de Garis Davies worked for part of the winter copying material in the Tut-ankh-amen collection. SYRIA Dr. Claude Schaeffer has sent the following report on the 1950 season at Ras Shamra: The excavations have continued on a pre-war scale, the expedition having been granted a new permit by the Directorate of Antiquities of the Government of Syria. The main effort of the season's work was de- voted to the continuation of the excavation of the palace of Ugarit. Several vast halls were found and two inner courts, one of which was entirely paved with heavy stone slabs. The remains of the contents of the palace were scanty but rich in quality. There were fragments of gold covered furniture, of ivory and stone statues. Further tablets were found in the palace and administrative archives, scattered during the pillage and before the building was burned. According to the decipherer of the new documents, Dr. Virolleaud, some of the texts contain lists of corporations, each of which has to pay a certain amount of tax in silver to the treasury or to equip archers for the army and bodyguard of the king. In another text the Goddess Anat is found under the name Antou, the writer having been confused by the name of the Babylonian goddess, the wife of the god of the heavens Anou. On the other hand the god Ecamoun, later identified with Asklepios, is mentioned in a Ras Shamra text under the name of Azmoun. The etymologies hitherto proposed for the name of this god will therefore have to be corrected. The palace of Ugarit is entirely built of stone, and so far as it is excavated, seems to be the greatest building of its kind hitherto known during the second mil- lennium in Palestine and Syria. In the latest level was found an important stone slab of a Hittite king of the fourteenth century B.C., whose personal representative resided at that time at the court of Ugarit. In the south-east part of the Tell, on its summit, was found an extensive building of the sixth and fifth centuries B.C., with rich finds of Attic and Ionian provenance. There is no doubt that Minet-el-Beida, the ancient port of Ras Shamra-Ugarit, was known to the Greek Sailors under the name of Leukos Limen as suggested in the Stadiasmus.7 In the eastern part of the site, a new quarter of the town was discovered and explored to the level of the period of the Egyptian Middle Kingdom. A mutilated statue of an Egyptian priest has been found there. The inscription seems to point to the time of Amenem- hat III and the personage is apparently a high digni- tary of Heliopolis. In the lower town, among the houses of bronze- smiths and workshops of various trades, was found an atelier of a maker of jewelry and cylinder seals with interesting half finished objects. They date to the fifteenth-fourteenth centuries B.C. The excavations are to be resumed in the autumn of 1951. LEBANON The Emir Ch6hab, Director of Antiquities in the Lebanon, writes that archaeological research in 1950- 1951 has been concentrated at two main points- Byblos and Tyre. At Byblos M. Dunand has been commissioned by the Lebanese Antiquities Service to continue his ex- cavations in the "Aeneolithic Necropolis." Under this cemetery he has discovered a Neolithic installation characterized by pottery that is finer than that of the Aeneolithic level. It is incised in a considerable variety of patterns. This level also produced many fine Neolithic pieces of pottery which have the surface entirely polished. At Tyre, the Emir ChEhab is continuing the excava- tion of the portico reported last year. This has now been cleared for a length of 175 meters. The cipolin marble columns recall those of Cyrenaica, both in</page><page sequence="7">1952] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS 45 material and size. It is pointed out in this connection that Septimius Severus, a native of Leptis Magna, raised Tyre to the rank of a colony. Further clearance in the neighboring rectangular stepped monument has now freed it of the Arab and Byzantine workshops built on top. At three points channels for water have been found which may throw some light on the purpose of this structure which has such a strange plan. The vaulted cells which were built against the outside of the building have now been found on the inside and seem to belong to an earlier stage of construction. In the cemetery of Tyre the excavation of marble sarcophagi of the late Roman and Byzantine periods continues. Some have escaped plunder and contain a few small pieces of jewelry, glass vases and coins. TURKEY Mr. Seton Lloyd has sent the following report on the joint excavations of the Turkish Antiquities Depart- ment and the British Institute of Archaeology at Ankara, in the district of ancient Harran. The expedi- tion was in charge of Bay Nuri G6kge, the Director of the Hittite Museum in Ankara and Mr. Lloyd, Director of the British Institute. The Expedition undertook a two months season of excavations in April and June of 1951. Efforts to locate the famous temple of Sin, the Moon-God of Harran, which was suspected to lie outside the actual city, brought the expedition to Sultan Tepe which is about ten miles from modern Urfa (Edessa) on the old Harran road. The greater part of the season was spent in making preliminary soundings in this remark- able mound which has hitherto received no attention from archaeologists. Sultan Tepe, which stands over fifty meters above the surrounding cultivated plain, represents one of the highest accumulations of occupational debris in the whole North Syrian and Mesopotamian district, and for many thousands of years, previous to the foundation of Edessa in Hellenistic times, must have been the administrative center of the Jullab Valley. The new soundings soon located a very large building of the late Assyrian period, occupying the greater part of the summit of the mound, at a height of about forty- three meters from the plain, and having the character either of a palace or a temple. Elsewhere at the sum- mit, the entrance to the citadel was marked by three gigantic column bases of basalt, measuring nearly two meters square, now displaced or overturned by the erosion of the ground beneath them. In spite of the accumulation of later remains above, the conformation of the mound made it possible partially to clear half-a-dozen chambers of the building, separated by walls two meters thick and, in some cases, paved with baked bricks. The great quantity of pot- tery vessels and other small objects thus obtained, made it easy from the beginning to attribute to the building a date somewhere in the seventh or eighth century B.C. The early discovery in one chamber of a handful of cuneiform tablets confirmed this con- clusion. Finally, with only two weeks of the season remaining, a chamber, apparently outside the area of the actual building, proved again to contain tablets, but this time in very large numbers. A half-circle of large wine jars seems to have been arranged against the wall and the space thus enclosed was stacked with tablets, sculptured vessels and other objects to a height of about seventy centimeters. Only a very small section of the hoard could be cleared in the time re- maining on account of the difficulty of handling clay tablets in an unbaked state. But even so, the major parts of more than a hundred and fifty documents were extracted, ranging from small private letters to heavy official records from twenty to thirty centimeters in length. The hoard was then sealed and the archive, whose extent is unknown, will remain to be cleared at some future date. Directly above the Assyrian building appeared the first traces of Roman occupation, suggesting that the summit of the mound must have remained unoccupied throughout the whole of the Persian and Hellenistic period. But the Roman occupation itself appeared to be of extremely long duration and of a richness and extent somewhat surprising in view of its proximity to Edessa. From a modest beginning at a time when Hellenistic coinage was still in use, the settlement evidently reached its maximum prosperity in the late second or third century A.D. when the occupation was characterized by the extensive use of fine terra sigillata pottery. It now extended from the foot of the mound several hundred meters into the plain; and here on its outskirts the remains of a very perfect miniature Roman bath were excavated during the course of the season by two British members of the expedition, Mr. and Mrs. Michael Gough. The central hall was orna- mented with an unusually fine mosaic pavement, in- corporating at one end a five-line Greek inscription recording the dedication of the bath to Aphrodite. An attempt during the first weeks of the season to investigate a moon-shrine at the village of Agaki Yarimca, where a stela dedicated to Sin of Harran had been found in 1949, was thwarted by the great depth to which the Assyrian remains were here buried be- neath later rebuildings of the shrine by the Sabians. The stela itself proved to have been preserved and re- erected in Roman times in a paved courtyard, flanked by a columned stoa in classical style. The final re- building of the shrine by the Sabians was dated to the ninth century A.D. by a hoard of Islamic pottery vessels, one of which bore a Kufic inscription. While work was in progress at Agai Yarimca, a small independent excavation was conducted at Har-</page><page sequence="8">46 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [AJA 56 ran itself by Dr. D. Storm Rice of the School of Oriental and African Studies in London University. Dr. Rice directed his efforts to the partial clearance of the eastern gateway of the castle, to which Mr. Seton Lloyd had drawn attention in a previous survey. A unique piece of mediaeval architecture was re- vealed. The gateway, which was entirely built of basalt, was ornamented beneath the springing of the arch on either side with two sculptured panels, each depicting a pair of hunting dogs with their collars and chains. Fallen from above were fragments of a monumental Kufic inscription giving the date 451 A.H. (A.D. 1059) and the name of a contemporary Arab Emir of the Numairid family which ruled at Harran from 380-479 A.H. (A.D. 990-1086). The inscription is being transported to the Ankara Museum. Dr. Helmuth Th. Bossert writes that in 1950-1951 only a small advance could be made in the excavations at Kara Tepe and at the neighboring Domuz Tepe on the banks of the Ceyhan River on the eastern edge of the Cilician Plain. Six rooms of a palace at Kara Tepe have been partially cleared and it is planned to con- tinue the work in the autumn of 1951. He reports in July, 1951, that there has appeared the third part of the Journal which he edits: Jahrbuch fiir Kleina- siatische Forschung as well as his new volume Altsyrien. With the expected appearance in the summer of 1951 of the first number of a new journal of the British Institute of Archaeology at Ankara: Anatolian Studies, the heightened interest in the archaeology of this part of the ancient world becomes plain. Dr. Bossert also reports on further survey work in the region bordering on the Gulf of Iskenderun, as well as in the Kayseri district of Central Anatolia.8 In August, 1950, Karata5 was again visited to plan the remains of the ancient harbor of Magarsos and if possible clear up the problem of the location of the town of Mallos. The mounds examined in the neighbor- hood of Karata? were found to show no traces of pre- Iron Age pottery. In a village (Kizil Tahta) south of the Dede Dagh was found a Flavian marble inscrip- tion naming the city of Mallos as having erected a Heroon in honor of Flavia Procla. This inscription is thought to come from the ruins on the right bank of the Pyramis (Ceyhan) nearby where there are re- mains of a Roman bridge repaired in Islamic times. Thus it is believed that Mallos can be located here and that Alexander's route from Magarsos through Mallos to Aigai (Ayas) near the upper end of the Gulf of Iskenderun can be followed on a modern map. Pot- sherds indicate that the site identified as Mallos was important in Roman and Byzantine times. As at Magarsos, there is no town mound here which suggests that both towns can hardly have been of any im- portance before the Greek period. Earlier in the summer of 1950 Kirgehir was visited to study a Hittite inscription found in 1947 and ex- amined again by Gtiterbock in 1948. This contains the name of a Prince Malkaya and is written on four sides of a free standing block. It appears to be a road inscription of the time of the Hittite Empire. The nearest Hittite settlement is the town of Kirgehir where soundings produced pottery of the time of the Hittite Empire. Fron Kergehir the party moved to Kayseri and then to a place called Pazar6ren. Twenty-five kilometers north of it is the village of Tagin and about a kilo- meter and a half still further north-west of this was found a rock inscription beside a spring which still continues to flow in the summer months. The in- scription, certainly connected with the spring, gives the names of two kings, father and son. Due to the condition of the stone it was impossible to suggest a provisional restoration for the inscription or to de- termine whether the king belonged to the time of the Empire, although it was thought that it is of the second millennium. Members of the Research Institute for Ancient Ori- ental Cultures and Languages had by this time ex- amined all the sites in the Kayseri Plain which were known to contain Hittite inscriptions, with the ex- ception of Ekrik6y. Here no new inscriptions were found but it is thought that the inscription in the Kayseri Museum does not come from this village itself but from the mound that lies south-west of it. Pottery examples from this mound were collected for further study. Sir Leonard Woolley writes that his field work has come to an end at Atchana. His letter brings the welcome news that the publication of the whole work is in the press in the summer of 1951. It will be re- membered that in his article in the Antiquaries Journal 28 (1948) 1 ff. were described a group of fresco frag- ments from upper rooms in the palace which Woolley dates to the middle of the eighteenth century B.C. Cretan analogies suggested by the architecture of the palace at Atchana are particularly evident in these paintings which will be illustrated and discussed in the forthcoming volume. This is strikingly evident in the photographs which Sir Leonard has allowed the writer to see. Grasses blown in the wind are rendered naturalistically against a Pompeian red background on one piece. On two others where this red ground joins a white surface it is given a wavy edge outlined by a greenish-gray stripe in a manner most suggestive of the backgrounds of Cretan wall paintings. Two other pieces with a white background are divided into horizontal registers by yellow and blue bands outlined in black and on one of these is the horn of a bull. It should be remembered that in the same building was found an earlier example of an "architectural" design which has again been compared to similar material</page><page sequence="9">1952] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS 47 from Knossos. The technique is said to be that of true fresco in all these fragments, identical with that at Knossos, while chemical analysis shows that the pig- ments are also identical. The style, so far as the avail- able fragments allow one to judge, is just the same. It would appear that one can look forward with the liveliest interest to the publication of these fragments along with the rest of the very important material at Atchana. They are unfortunately very fragmentary but it is a miracle that they have survived at all to fill out the gradually growing body of wall decorations from Western Asia. IRAQ Two famous sites in Iraq have been under investiga- tion during the winter season of 1950-1951. The Parthian city of Hatra, far out in the desert south- west of Mosul, is being excavated by Fuad Safer and Mohammed Ali for the Directorate of Antiquities. The work has resulted in the discovery of a quantity of remarkable sculpture showing a mixture of Greek and oriental influences. The figures are particularly interesting because of their costume and the well preserved painted detail. Again in the north, Prof. M. E. L. Mallowan has dug again in the Assyrian mound of Nimrud for the British Museum. This resulted in the discovery of a deposit of unusually fine ivories belonging to the same group which has long been in the British Museum from excavations in the last century. Robert J. Braidwood of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago has sent the following report on work completed in the spring of 1951 in northern Iraq: Archaeological excavations on four prehistoric sites in Iraq, covering a time range from approximately 100,000 years ago to about 7000 years ago, have just been completed after eight months of digging. The earliest antiquities indicated a culture which on typo- logical grounds may be as early as any hitherto found in western Asia. The latest group of materials-con- servatively dated to about 5000 B.c. by the radioactive carbon test-showed the most ancient fully established village community yet to have been scientifically excavated. The expedition had, as its central problem, an examination of the evidence for cultural change, from the time of the end of the cave-dwelling stage to that when fully established village life flourished. It was during this period of revolutionary innovation and experiment that the foundations of the great urban civilizations of the ancient world were laid. The expe- dition chose to work in the grassy uplands above the modern oil-producing town of Kirkuk because it was here on the hilly flanks of the "Fertile Crescent" that the first phase of the revolution in food-getting habits and established community living took place. It was also in this "nuclear area" that the cultures of villages developed into those of towns and spread rapidly to become the basis for the earliest of the great urban civilizations, ancient Mesopotamia. The expedition, directed by Professor Robert J. Braidwood, represented the work of three scientific organizations, the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, the Baghdad School of the American Schools of Oriental Research, and the Directorate of Antiquities of the Iraq Government. The work on the established village site, Qalat Jarmo, was a continuation by the Oriental Institute of preliminary soundings made in 1948. The greater part of the expedition's efforts were concentrated on Jarmo, which yielded approximately 150,000 artifacts, a bulk of animal bones, grain, charcoal, and soil samples, and in which a variety of house plans and architectural details were exposed in almost 500 square meters of total area. The Oriental Institute's staff at Jarmo consisted of Dr. and Mrs. Braidwood, Miss Vivian Broman, Robert M. Adams, Jr. (on a grant from the Department of Anthropology of the Uni- versity of Chicago), Miss Elizabeth West of the Museum of the American University of Beyrouth, and two Oriental Institute part-time volunteer gradu- ate students, Cornelius Hillen of Rotterdam and Gustavus F. Swift, Jr., of Chicago. The excavation of an earlier settlement showed that the germ of village life was already in existence perhaps several thousand years before Jarmo. This earlier site, Karim Shahir, lay over a mile upstream from Jarmo, and was situated (like Jarmo) on a hill over- looking a deep wadi (gully). The expedition worked Karim Shahir on behalf of the American Schools of Oriental Research. The School's staff consisted of Braidwood, Bruce Howe of the Peabody Museum of Harvard University and Frederick Barth of the Ethno- logical Museum of the University of Oslo, Norway. Dr. Howe, the Baghdad Fellow of the American Schools for 1950-1951 and on grant from the Ameri- can Philosophical Society, was in charge of the opera- tions at Karim Shahir. The expedition also had with it Professor Herbert E. Wright, Jr., of the Department of Geology of the University of Minnesota, on leave through the cooperation of his University and with a Viking Fund, Inc. post-doctoral fellowship. It was Wright's function to correlate the work of the expedi- tion, in its different phases, with the features of the Pleistocene and recent geology of the area. The School's staff also did an investigation of a cave on the Kirkuk-Sulimaniyah road, some ten miles from Jarmo. This cave, called Palegawra, was apparently occupied some 10,000 to 12,000 years ago, and yielded a flint industry perhaps slightly later in time than</page><page sequence="10">48 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [AJA 56 that found by Prof. Garrod at Zarzi, nearer Sulimani- yah (cf. BASPR 6 [1930] 9-23). With the Palegawra cave material, the sequence which the expedition had set itself to recover was completed. The Palegawra antiquities indicate the level of culture toward the very end of the cave- dwelling stage, the Karim Shahir open site shows the first steps men took towards the new kind of life in a food producing village, and Jarmo illustrates the blossoming of culture in an established village com- munity. As corollary to its geological investigations, the ex- pedition worked on a much earlier site. In 1949, the Directorate of Antiquities of the Iraq Government, under whose intelligent aegis all the expedition's work flourished, had discovered an early Pleistocene site in the vicinity, Barda Balka (Sumer 5, pt. 2 [1949] 205-6). At their request, Howe and Wright were ap- pointed by the Directorate to do a geological-archaeo- logical investigation at Barda Balka. This fruitful collaboration between Dr. Naji al-Asil, the Director General of Antiquities, and Howe and Wright for the American Schools, resulted in the discovery of charac- teristic Acheulian type hand-axes, pebble-tools and small flake-tools in geological context in the gravel bed from which they were being weathered. This in situ, geological situation, taken with the study of the bones of extinct animals, will eventually allow a more pre- cise dating for the site. At the moment, the deposits are believed to fall at the beginning of the last great glacial phase, perhaps 10,000 years ago. The expedition also gathered other important evidence of a geological- archaeological nature, some of it bearing on marked climatic fluctuations down into historic times. Much of the expedition's findings must await de- tailed elucidation by specialists in botany, zoology, sedimentology and other sciences, as well as in con- centrated archaeological study. A tentative picture of the results can be drawn, nevertheless. The Barda Balka finds indicate a time when the man who made the simple but utilitarian flint and limestone hand- axes, choppers and scrapers lived a catch-as-catch-can existence along with now extinct elephants and great deer, in a landscape which must have been much different from the now almost treeless hills. Surface materials indicate a continued occupation in the area during the long gap in the expedition's sequence be- tween Barda Balka and the Palegawra cave. The Palegawra cave-dwellers were very efficient makers of flint tools. They knew how to produce long parallel- sided blades, chisels and minute microlithic tools which must have been hafted, perhaps as harpoon or arrow points. The Palegawra cave dwellers were suc- cessful hunters of wild horse, deer, goat, gazelle, sheep and pig. The open site of Karim Shahir seems to have flourished, for a short time only, about eight or nine thousand years ago. A more exact date will be available on the basis of the examination of charcoal and shell from the site by means of the new radio-active carbon test developed in the University of Chicago. It is not clear just what kind of structures the Karim Shahir people lived in. The expedition found only rough stone floorings of irregular shape, clusters of hearth stones, and a pit apparently meant for storage. The entire settlement covered an area of almost two acres. Its people had abundant meat, almost half of the animal bones were of domesticated or at least potentially domesticable species. Evidence for grain is not yet available. It may turn up in the charcoal or soil samples. However, the Karim Shahir people had some sickle blades, milling stones and chipped-and-ground stone hoes, all of which may suggest incipient agri- culture. Flint was still the predominant material for tools, and microlithic bracelets were commonly made, but some finer stones were ground into beads and bracelets. In every way, Karim Shahir seems to indi- cate a cultural stage midway between the Palegawra cave and the Jarmo village, and a time when men were making their first tentative experiments with agri- culture, animal domestication and village life. Viewed from the perspective given it by Barda Balka, Palegawra and Karim Shahir, Jarmo is a large and spectacular village establishment. Yet it is the earliest village site yet to have been scientifically exca- vated in the Near East. None of its tools are of metal, and portable pottery is available only in the uppermost third of its range. Its people lived in mud-walled houses of several rooms each. These houses were pro- vided with ovens complete with chimneys, and floors seem to have been made of clean mud packed over reeds. The site covers more than three acres. It may originally have had as many as fifty houses in it, for avilla ge population of perhaps 300 people. The cata- logue of objects recovered at Jarmo, in chipped and ground stone, bone, shell and clay, is too elaborate to detail here. The place of portable pottery was antici- pated by fine stone vessels and also by baked-in-place clay floor basins. Clay was used plastically, mainly for figures of animals and for markedly pregnant "mother-goddesses." Flint still bulked large in the assemblage, microliths were still produced and the imported obsidian group had now become very large. Over ninety per cent of the animal bones were in the sheep-goat, pig, cattle, small horse category. Only five per cent were of definitely wild species. There were at least two kinds of wheat and some form of legume. Apparently a balanced type of peasant economy had been reached, but there was great interest in and experimentation with the different simple crafts. Village life had begun in earnest, and with it, the germs of the economic, political, social and moral</page><page sequence="11">1952] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS 49 orders which were to blossom into the earliest civili- zation. IRAN From Susa Dr. R. Ghirshman reports as follows on the 1950-1951 season of excavations. The work of the preceding season had established the destruction of City IV by Shapur II following upon a revolt of the Christian inhabitants in the first century of the Sassanids. Susa recovered with diffi- culty, as is shown by the poverty of the upper levels previously excavated. In place of the ruined Susa, Shapur II erected a new town some fifteen kilometers upstream from Kerkha and on the opposite bank. The ruins now bear the name of Eiwan-&amp;-Kerkha. Thanks to the interest which the Archaeological Service of the Iranian Empire takes in all research concerning the history of the country, the French Mission was able to undertake a preliminary study of the site in November and December of 1950. The site of Eiwan-&amp;-Kerkha covers an area about a kilometer in width and four in length. It is surrounded by a strong enclosure wall. The royal quarter covers a huge space one kilometer square in the southern part of the town. Following a system known earlier in Assyrian towns, the palace had been constructed across the line of the enclosure wall so that its face which looks out over the plain has the appearance of a fortress wall. The Mission has cleared about 200 meters of its length. Built of baked bricks and mortar, it is pierced by two superimposed ranks of loopholes and flanked by round towers, some of which are as much as eight meters in diameter. Another sector of excavations was opened in a mound which appeared to cover a triple Iwan-recep- tion-hall situated in the middle of the garden facing the southern town gate. The central room, measuring twelve by eight meters, seems to have been entirely decorated with frescoes. The preliminary excavation cleared only the upper two meters of the walls on which remained only traces of paintings in blue, yellow and red, washed away by the rains. However, it is to be expected that the lower parts of the un- excavated walls may retain their decoration more or less intact. In December, 1950, the Mission returned to Susa where its first work was to recover the frescoes of an important building in level IV of the "Ville Royale" which had been cleared in the season of 1949-1950 (pl. 4,C). One of the walls of this building, decorated with paintings on a layer of mud, had fallen in one piece inside the room and with the painted face against the ground. This was cut into small panels so that it could be turned over. Although badly damaged, this painting, after it was copied, could be recognized as a hunting scene in which the men and animals were twice life size. The building seems to have been a sanctuary with a room fourteen meters square. The ceiling was sup- ported by two rows of columns. This hall opens onto a porticoed esplande. The fagade is pierced by three entrances corresponding to the three aisles of the hall. The latter is surrounded on three sides by corridors. The plan is that of a fire temple like that excavated by Ghirshman some years ago at Bishapur. The sub- ject of the fresco is the same as the hunt of Mithra discovered at Dura-Europus which would suggest that this sanctuary is a Mithraeum. The town of the Fourth Level was removed and that of the Fifth, which dates from the Parthian Period, cleared during the course of the winter of 1950-1951. Its plan is in great part different from that of the preceding level. Trails of cinders and stone balls, projectiles from siege machines, were met with in several places. It would seem that Town V was destroyed in the course of an assault, but the date of the event still remains uncertain. The clearance of Town V has produced a certain amount of Parthian pottery, glass and objects of bronze and iron. One of the buildings was a bath, with the floor covered by a mosaic made of smoothed black and white pebbles. The poor condition of this did not allow identification of the subjects which were com- posed in black on a white ground, except for the remains of an inscription which seems to contain the name of the town of Susa. Work was again undertaken in the second sector, the "Ville des Artisans," where new Parthian-Seleucid tombs were cleared (pl. 4,B). However, the principal aim followed here was the extension of the work under this cemetery to more ancient constructions which had been identified toward the end of the preceding season. These comprise a village built in the seventh century B.C. One house, thirty meters long by ten meters wide, has several rooms and everything points to this being a building inhabited by a clan or large family such as has been observed recently among the Iranian tribes of Chorasmia of the seventh-sixth cen- turies B.C. The evidence drawn from the construction of this building indicates two or even three periods of repair which would show that it had been used for a long time. This is in conformity with the objects re- covered from these dwellings. The lower levels pro- duced pottery very close to that of the Necropolis B at Sialk. The upper levels, on the other hand, con- tained pottery, fibulae and arrow heads with trilobed sockets identical to those from the American excava- tions at Persepolis. Thus the discoveries of the 1950- 1951 season support the theory formulated the pre- ceding year that this installation served as habitation</page><page sequence="12">50 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY for the first Iranians who settled around the Elamite town of Susa.

The results of excavations made before 1947 have been published and new investigations have been made or are under way. Quiet progress is marked by the fact that all excavations of value have been made by the same museums and institutes which have been working in archaeology for the last thirty years. The only new foundation is a chair in prehistory and an institute for practical work established at the Uni- versity of Arhus under the leadership of Professor P. V. Glob. In Denmark there is a marked tendency to organize new societies of amateur archaeologists to work in collaboration with the museums and for information among the members. This is an extension of the close collaboration between the scientists and amateurs which is characteristic of Scandinavia, es- pecially of Denmark. It has led to remarkable results, particularly in the study of the Stone Age. In the previous survey of Scandinavian archaeology in the Journal' it was pointed out that during the war years the employment authorities placed large staffs of workers at the disposition of archaeologists and that valuable finds resulted from the intensive digging for peat. Both these characteristics have now disappeared with the recurrence of full employment and the in- creased importation of fuel. The most interesting trend of recent years is the developmenc of international co- operation. Danish archaeologists have been partici- pants in Norwegian and Swedish excavations, and Swedes and Norwegians have been guests at Danish excavations. The large scale, common Scandinavian excavations on Vallhagar, Gotland, in which English and American students also took part, have left their mark in methods of field work, and in ways of co- operation, as well as in personal contacts across the borders. All these arrangements have been ot great value for the younger generation of Scandinavian archaeologists of whom a large number are coming forward in field work and publication. There has been activity in nearly every period and with every group of material so that this survey must limit the treatment of individual items for the sake of the whole picture. In the notice of excavations which follows, the number in parentheses after the name of the site is a reference to its situation on the map (fig. 1). For the relationship of the various periods see the chart (fig. 2). Mesolithic Bromine, Zealand (1). The palaeolithic dwelling place mentioned in the previous report2 has been pub- lished. Th.

The deepest stra- tum of this site revealed a Tardenois dwelling place, a culture new for Denmark: the east German, so- called "Diinen-Tardenoisien," dominated by micro- liths, but totally lacking axes. Neolithic habitation was also found (see below). The site was excavated by C. J. Becker in 1948. Alajairvi, Osterbotten (3). In 1947 a dwelling place of the hitherto little known Quartz-culture was exca- vated. This culture had been earlier discovered at Rengen (4) in the border district between Norway and Sweden.

The front wall was built of mud on a plaiting of branches and the roof was of turf. To be published in Arb. f. nord. Oldk. Skal, Jutland (8). In 1950 P. Simonsen excavated a group of very primitive, open, flint pits in the old chalk rock; they date from the Ertebolle culture and thus are presumably the oldest excavated mines in Europe, as well as the most primitive. To be pub- lished in Atrb. f. nord. Oldk. Biickaskog, Skine (9) and Lummelunda, Gotland (10). Two graves with skeletons in a squatting position and with mesolithic grave-gifts were excavated in 1939 at Backaskog and in 1947 at Lummelunda. A careful publication of this hitherto unknown type of burial is given by Althin, but Rydbeck considers that the finds are neolithic and the grave-gifts retarded types. G. Arwidson, "Stendldersfynden frin Kams i Lum- melunda," Gotldndskt Arkiv 1949, 147-60 (in Swedish); C. A. Althin, Bdckaskog och Lummelunda 1950 (in Swedish with an English summary); 0. Rydbeck, "Om nordisk StenAlderskronologi och gravar med sittande Hocker," Fornvdnnen 1950, 281-308 (in Swed- ish with a German summary). Neolithic Hjuleberga, Narke (11). This find, excavated several years ago, is now seen to originate from the Swedish, non-megalithic, early Neolithic period, well known as the Vrd-culture. The pottery is very important for understanding the relations between this culture and its contemporaries, the Megalithic culture, the "Dwel- ling Place" culture, and, perhaps, the Boataxe culture. It is also important for Swedish Stone Age chronology: A. Bagge, "Sn6rkeramikboplatsen vid Rosenlund, Hjuleberga, Ekers, Narke," Fornvdnnen 1949, 131-51 (in Swedish with an English summary). Barkaer, Jutland (12). This early Neolithic village, mentioned in the previous report,3 has now been pub- lished: P. V. Glob, "Barkaer, Danmarks aeldste Landsby," Nat. Mus. Arbejdsm. 1949, 5-16 (in Danish). Knardrup, Zealand (13). The results from Barkaer have been amplified by the excavations of K. A. Larsen in 1949-50 at Knardrup. A paved street be- tween two rows of so-called "chain-houses" (Kaede- huse), not, as in Barkaer and Troldebjerg, "row- houses" (Raekkehuse) has been discovered. The exca- vation, from the Dolmen period, is being continued. Salten, Jutland (14). An early Neolithic earth-grave with metal has been found. C. J. Becker, Mosefundne Lerkar fra yngre Stenalder. Trelleborg, Zealand (15a). The rubbish pits from the Passage Grave period, excavated in 1937 under the Viking castle, have been published. This is the largest Neolithic house site on Zealand and the pottery, in particular, is of great value. Th. Mathiassen, "Stenalderbebyggelsen paa Trelleborg," Nord. For- tidsm. 4 (1948) 215-22 (in Danish). Alstrup, Jutland (16). In 1950 P. V. Glob excavated at Alstrup, south of Arhus, a large and wealthy dwell- ing place with farm sites from the Passage Grave period. It is remarkable that, for the first time in Scandinavia, bell-beaker sherds were found in a dwell- ing place. Gronhoj, Jutland (17). The passage grave of early type excavated in 1940 has been published. Pottery of the same age was found in layers outside and inside the chamber, while some of the types from within the chamber are later. The author discusses various theo- ries to account for the fact and considers that sacrifices were made at the tomb. K. Thorvildsen, "Gronhoj ved Horsens, en Jaettestue med Offerplads," Aarb. f. nord. Oldk. 1946, 73-94 (in Danish with French summary). Norre Sandeg.rd, Bornholm (2 b-c). The second stratum at Nr. Sandegird is of the South Swedish, pit-ceramic "Dwelling Place" culture not previously found on Bornholm, although expected. It was not a pure culture, but was mixed with Swedish Boataxe culture. The third and latest settlement on the site, with cremation burials, was from the late La Tbne period. Rispebjerg, Bornholm (18a). In connection with the excavation of O. Klindt-Jensen and P. Kjaerum of the Iron Age castle, Ringborgen, a large dwelling place of the Bornholmian variety of the South Swedish "Dwell- ing Place" culture with pit-ceramic, was discovered. Oddemes, West Agder (19). In 1947 the find of a dwelling place was made on Gimleveien; its importance lies in the fact that Boataxe and Slate cultures were here mixed, the former being represented by three flint axes, a blade-arrow, etc., the latter by two slate arrows. Univ. Oldsakssaml. Arb. 1945-48 (Oslo 1950) 255-56 (in Norwegian). Hautaketo, Osterbotten (20). The rich ceramic ma- terial, excavated in 1946, indicates that the normal comb-ceramic stylistic development was limited to south Finland and, because of cultural retardation in north Finland, that the early comb-style endured much longer there (the same was true of northern Norway: see G. Gjessing, Yngre Stenalder i Nord- Norge). C. F. Meinander, "Der steinzeitliche Wohn- platz Hautoketo in Veterli," Suomen Museo 1946, 1-14 (in Finnish with a German summary). Roikamtiki, Finland (21). The results of the excava- tion in 1947 of this typical comb-ceramic dwelling place are published. C. F.

Skovbakken in Alborg, Jutland (22). In 1950 C. J. Becker and others excavated a number of mine shafts with horizontal galleries in the chalk, hewn out to procure the flint. The type is well known in England, Belgium and France, but hitherto not discovered in Denmark. The technical progress in relation to the mines at Skal is very marked. The Skovbakke shafts date to the Dagger period. Bronze Age Landskrona, Skine (23). In 1948 M. Magnusson excavated a rubbish layer in Landskrona, dateable to the early Bronze Age. Among the finds were many flint implements of degenerate Neolithic types, pot- tery and bones of a large breed of cattle, until now unknown in prehistoric times. This is the first dwelling place of the early Bronze Age in south Scandinavia. M. Magnusson, "En BronslIdersboplats i Lands- krona," Fornvdnnen 1950, 25-35 (in Swedish with an English summary). Harreby, South Jutland (24). In 1948 a man's grave of the early Bronze Age was excavated. H. C. Broholm, "Et s nderjysk Gravfund fra den aeldre Bronzealder," Nat. Mus. Arbejdsm. 1950, 28-33. Karis, Nyland (25). Three barrows were excavated in 1938-1945; the material has greatly enlarged our sparse knowledge of the south Scandinavian Bronze culture in Finland. O. av Hillstr6m, "Nagra bron- sIldersgravar i Karis," Finsk Museum 1948, 27-43 (in Swedish with a German summary). Midskov, Fyn (26). In 1948 seven gold bowls, of similar type, were found. It is a well known type from Denmark and central Europe, presumably manu- factured in the area of the Lausitz culture in the late Bronze Age. H. C. Broholm, "The Midskov Find," Acta Archaeologica 19 (1949) 189-204; E. Albrectsen, "Guldkarrene fra Midskov," Nat. Mus. Arbejdsm. 1949, 84-90 (in Danish). Abildholt, Jutland (27). In 1942 a large bronze cauldron was found in a West-Jutish peat-bog. It is now recognized as a very important piece since it is the first of the large cauldrons of the Irish Bronze Age found on the European continent. They are manu- factured in a curious and unique technique of mixed casting and hammering. C. J. Becker, "An Irish Bronze Cauldron found in Jutland," Acta Archaeo- logica 20 (1950) 265-70. Vekterli, Tryndelagen (28). In 1946 the Museum in Trondheim received a mould for casting spear- heads from Vekterli near the Swedish border; it is an addition to the Ananino finds in northern Scandinavia and indicates (along with four earlier casts) that east European bronzes from the area of the Slate-culture in the late Bronze Age are not necessarily imported, but can be of local manufacture.

In connection with the publication of some rubbish pits from the pre-Roman period, excavated under the Viking castle, C. J. Becker makes an analysis of the La Tene pottery in Den- mark; the pottery is divided into three groups and is further treated in his study, "Die zeitliche Stellung des Hjortspringfundes," Acta Archaeologica, 19 (1949); see also Becker, "Den tidlige Jernalders Bebyggelse paa Trelleborg," Nord. Fortidsm. 4 (1948) 223-40. Gording Hede, Jutland (30). In 1949 K. Thorvildsen and H. Andersen excavated some farm sites of the pre-Roman period. New knowledge of Iron Age house construction was obtained, not based on unusual finds, but on the unusually specialized and intensive exca- vation technique. Vae, SkAne (31). In 1945-46 the first large Iron Age village was excavated in Skane, with at least ten houses, some built of mud on a plaiting of branches, others of timber. A large number of artifacts dated this town from about the birth of Christ to ca. A.D. 1100. At about that time Vae was moved farther east to its present location. The main body of the material is from the Roman period and can be com- pared with that from Bornholm and east Germany. B. Stjernquist, "Eastern Influences in the Roman Iron Age Settlement at Vae," Meddel f. Lunds Univ. 1947, 49-82; idem, Fornvdnnen 1947, 179-80 (in Swedish with an English summary). Lundsgaard, Fyn (32).

Among the finds were fifteen solidi of the fifth century. Vallhagar, Gotland (35). This village of the period of the Migrations, is mentioned in the previous report.4 M. Stenberger, Fornvdnnen 1948, 48-50 (in Swedish with an English summary). Asrall, Telemarken (36). In 1948-50 A. Hagen and A. Listol excavated a large farm of the Migration period on Asrall. The construction shows interesting parallels to the previously mentioned houses from the islands in the Baltic. Gamleborg, Paradisbakkerne (37) and Ringborgen on Rispebjerg, Bornholm (18 b). On the island of Bornholm there are eight circular or semicircular ram- parts to which many local tales and legends are at- tached. They had never been investigated, but in 1949-50 P. Simonsen and P. Kjaerum investigated Gamleborg and in 1950 0. Klindt-Jensen and P. Kjaerum, Ringborgen. Both were found to have origi- nated in the Migration period when peasants built them as refuges. No permanent houses were erected in them. Under Ringborgen was the Stone Age settle- ment previously mentioned. Horns, Vdisterg6tland (38). A large cremation ceme- tery of the late La Tene period was excavated at Horns; the material is published by Sahlstr6m and Gejvall, who use new methods for the classification of the cremated bones by sex and age. Moberg has correlated the material with Swedish late La Thne and with the history of local settlement. G. Sahlstr6m och N.-G. Gejvall, "Gravfaltet pi Kyrkbacken i Horns socken, Visterg6tland," Kungl.

Moberg, "Kyrk- backen i Horns socken f6rre och efter Jarnalderens tredje period," Fornvdnnen 1950, 73-94 (in Swedish with an English summary). Bjunrum, Visterg6tland (39). In 1946 a cremation grave of the first century B.C. was found in a gravel pit at Stora Bjurum. Among the grave gifts are im- ports from eastern Germany, a bronze pail which contained the ashes, an iron spearhead, an iron sword and a bronze dagger. Other finds from Visterg6tland show this same east German influence. M. Stenburger, "Bjurumfyndet och dess datering," Fornvdnnen 1948, 193-210. Dollerup, Jutland (40).

Rich finds were made and the excavation will be continued in 1951. Himlinggje, Zealand (42). In 1949 some inhumation graves were excavated in the well known cemetery of Himlinggje. They dated to the third century A.D. and contained Roman imports (glass, bronze vessels, pearls and a silver coin) and local gold and silver trinkets. H. Norling-Christensen is continuing the excavations. Regnemark, Zealand (43). In 1950 a cemetery of the late Roman Iron Age was discovered which adds to the large group of similar cemeteries already known in east Zealand (Himlinggje, Varpelev, Valloby, Stroby, Udby, Hastrup, etc.). The cemetery was prob- ably in use during the period A.D. 100-600. Vaerlose, Zealand (44). In 1944 during work on the German fortifications at Vaerlose Airfield near Copenhagen an inhumation grave of the late Roman period was found. It contained imported Roman bronze vessels, local pottery and trinkets, among which was a silver fibula bearing the woman's name, "Olgod," "beer friend," in runes of the elder Futhark. C. L. Vebaek, "En Sjaellandsk Kvindegrav fra 3. Aarh. e. Kr.," and A. Baeksted, "Vaerlose Runefibula," Arb. f. nord. Oldk. 1945, 74-91 (in Danish with a French summary). Odemotland, Rogaland (45).

In 1946 an unusually finely furnished woman's grave of the Migration period was excavated by J. Bee. It was a chest made of stone slabs containing four fibulae of bronze, one of which was gilded, eleven gilded bronze buttons, a bronze belt buckle, fragments of woven cloth, an earthen jar, and several iron implements.

In a peat-bog in central Zealand a wooden box with a runic inscription in the elder Futhark was found. The type of the runes and the box date to the Migration period. The word, "tavido," here used has thrown light on the famous inscription on the golden horn from Gallehus: A. Baek- sted, "The Stenmagle Rune Box and the Golden Horn Inscription," Acta Archaeologica 18 (1947) 202-10; C. L. Vebaek, "En Traeaeske med Runeindskrift fra en sjaellandsk Mose," Nat. Mus.

Ullern, Oslo (50) and Hov, Hedmark (51). In 1947 and 1948 at two different spots in eastern Norway about 200 iron bars of the Merovingian period and the Viking Age were discovered. The publication discusses trade and metal-techniques in the late Iron Age. T. Dannevig-Hauge, "To Pengedepoter fra Oldtiden," Viking 1949, 25-30 (in Norwegian). Bragdavellir, Iceland (52). Three Roman bronze coins, A.D. 270-307, were found at this site on the east coast of Iceland. It is probable that a Roman ship discovered and visited Bragdavellir ca. A.D. 300, five hundred years earlier than the discovery of the island according to written sources. Kr. Eldjarn, "Fund af romerske Monter pi Island," Nord. Numism.

The castle at Trelleborg, excavated in 1942-43, has now been published. The citadel contains an inner castle protected by a circular rampart with four entrances and a ditch, and an outer castle around which there is a semicircular rampart and another ditch. In the inner castle three small and sixteen large houses of a hitherto unknown type were excavated. In the outer castle fifteen similar houses and a cemetery of 135 inhumation graves were found. The artifacts from the houses and graves originate in the late Viking Age, ca. A.D. 1000. The whole construction is of particular interest because of the mathematical accuracy of the survey. Rubbish pits from the pre-Roman Iron Age were found below the castle and, below them, pits from the Passage Grave period, as described above. P. Norlund, Trelleborg, with contributions from K. Jessen, N. E. N rlund, G. Knudsen and M. Degerbol, Nord. Fortidsm. 4 (1948) 7-214, 241-96 (in Danish with an English summary). Aggersborg, Jutland (53). In 1945 excavations were started on a north Jutish citadel, Aggersborg, similar to Trelleborg, but much larger. Inside a circular rampart with four entrances and a ditch there were found forty-eight houses of the Trelleborg type and artifacts dating from A.D. 950-1086. It is known from the literary sources that Aggersborg was destroyed in war in that year. Below the castle the site of a merchant's town was found. The houses were simpler and seem to be a prototype of the Trelleborg type. The artifacts from this level date to the ninth century. The diameter of the outer ditch, ca. 285 m., gives some idea of the size of the establishment; excavation is still progressing. C. G. Schultz, "Aggersborg, vikingelejren ved Limfjorden," Nat. Mus. Arbejdsm. 1949, 91-108 (in Danish). Klauhaugene, Rogaland (54). This Viking town was excavated in 1947 and has been partially published. It consists of a number of houses radiating from a central court. J. Petersen, "Oldsakssamlingens tilvekst 1947," Stavanger Mus. Arb. 1947, 59-62; ibid. 1948, 14-16; ibid. 1949, 19-21. Storhagen, Aland (55). Between 1942-45 a large farm of the period A.D. 800-1100 was excavated. It consisted of seven houses and fourteen small grave barrows. The houses had a stone found ation but their walls were of mud on a plaiting of branches. The artifacts are numerous. The interest of the excavation lies in its relationship to the many earlier excavated sites on Aland of the early Iron Age. E. Kivikoski, "Husgrunderne i Storhagen, Kulla, Finstr6m."

An important contribution to the discussion about the settling of northern Europe and especially about the dating of the enigmatic north Norwegian Komsa culture (67). The author demon- strates convincingly that this culture, as well as the related finds from the Fosna culture (68) in southern Norway and the dwelling place Sandarna (69) on the west coast of Sweden, originated in the Early-Atlantic climatic period, ca. 4500 B.C.

Neolithic C. J. Becker, "Mosefundne Lerkar fra yngre Stenal- der," Arb. f. nord. Oldk. 1947, 1-318 (in Danish with an English summary). This doctoral thesis publishes 152 ceramic finds of early Neolithic date from bogs (106 of them are from the peat digging, 1940-47). On this basis the Dolmen period in Denmark can be divided into a series of chronological and topographical groups, the dependence of which on western and eastern central Europe is closely discussed. The book also describes an earth burial at Salten in Jutland (14) in which was found the oldest known piece of metal from Scandinavia, a copper trinket in the form of a disc, imported from the Proto-Aunjetitz culture. Univ. Oldsakssaml. Arb. 1945-48, 272-75 and 281- 84. In 1948 Erling Johansen investigated ten houses of Neolithic date, most of them on the island Krikeroy in Ostfold. Most important is the locality Rodsmyra (71), where coarse pottery, flint and slate implements were found together in three late Neolithic houses. M.

"Buplass-Kulturen pa Morekysten i Dolktida," Viking 1948, 89-132 (in Norwegian with a French summary). New knowledge has been obtained from an investigation of the houses from the dagger period on More on the west coast of Norway which may result in a more accurate dating of the slate culture. New light is also thrown on the immigration of the peasants to this district, the relations between the two cultures and the gradual creation of a mixed culture in which hunting and fishing are quite as im- portant as cattle breeding, while agriculture is of less importance; to this day such a type of culture is characteristic of several Norwegian valleys.

Here for the first time are published a succession of sledge and ski finds from Finnish and North Swedish peat bogs; we get a wide cultural picture of Stone Age communica- tion and means of transportation. Bronze Age H. C. Broholm, "Anthropomorphic Bronze Age Figures in Denmark," Acta Archaeologica 18 (1947) 196-202. A short survey of the hitherto little noticed, half naturalistic, human sculptures from the Bronze Age, especially a series of small, female bronze idols. S. Marstrander, "Jylland-Lista," Viking 1950, 63- 85 (in Norwegian). The theory of the Bronze Age as a very pronounced class society, advanced in Denmark, is here taken up in connection with Norwegian ma- terial. The upper class appears to be a bronze-owning clan of great merchants and landowners along the south coast. The lower class was composed not only of the ethnically different hunting and fishing tribes, but also of the corn producing inhabitants of the interior of south Norway; these inhabitants are par- tially descended from immigrants who came to Nor- way with the upper class (74). P. V. Glob, "Bornholms Helleristninger," Nat. Mus. Arbejdsm. 1948, 83-91 (in Danish). The agricultural rock carvings on Bornholm dating to the late Bronze Age form a separate group which is here described and illustrated. The dominating motifs are ships and wheel-crosses (75). E. Johansen, "Nyoppdagete jordbruksristninger i Ostfold," Viking 1948, 63-87 (in Norwegian). In the much explored district of Ostfold (76) the author has discovered a group of carvings with new motifs and has observed traces of red paint in the carved lines; thus the usual differentiation between rock carvings and rock paintings is no longer valid. Iron Age M. Hald, "Olddanske Textiler," Nord. Fortidsm. 5 (1950) 496 ff. (in Danish with an English summary). About fifty finds of clothing have been made in the Danish peat-bogs and others in graves. This material is here published and throws valuable light on Iron Age fashions, tailoring and weaving technique through the author's analysis of the weaving and description of the patterns. It is the author's thesis for the doctorate. C. Blindheim, "Drakt og Smykker," Viking 1947, 1-139 (in Norwegian). An up to date survey of the Norwegian Iron Age textiles with a description of the use of textiles and trinkets for a reconstruction of Iron Age dress. K. A. Larsen, "Bornholm i aeldre Jernalder," Arb. f. nord. Oldk. 1949 1-214 (in Danish with an English</page><page sequence="23">1952] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS 61 summary). Due to its isolated position the island of Bornholm (77) has always differed in culture from the rest of Denmark. This difference justified the work of E. Vedel on Bornholm in 1886-95 and it has been studied afresh by the author of this book, following up the work of Vedel, but with a modern point of view. Important parallels and lines of evolution have been found although no new material has been published. E. Albrectsen, "Fyns Bebyggelse i aeldre Jernalder," A rb. f. nord. Oldk. 1946, 1-71 (in Danish with a French summary). This paper is partly a publication of the site of Lundsgaard near Odense (32), partly a general survey of the process of settlement in the district. New knowledge has been added of the house-types of the Roman Iron Age and it is shown that the Iron Age communities were divided similarly to the ad- ministrative districts of the Middle Ages; they also correspond to the dialect districts and distribution of place names in the present; these phenomena evidently originated in the early Iron Age. 0. Mollerop, "Brannflakgraver pa Vestlandet i eldre Jernalder," Stravanger Mus. Arb. 1950, 38-45 (in Norwegian). A round barrow was excavated on Ode- motland in 1949 which contained a cremation of the "pyreplace" grave type: the barrow was built on the very place of the pyre. It dates to the fourth century A.D. and is the oldest one of this type in west Norway. W. Slomann, "Medelpad og Jamtland i eldre Jer- nalder," Bergens Mus. Arb. 1948, no. 2, 78 pp. (in Norwegian with an English summary). From an in- vestigation of the finds of the first six centuries after Christ the influences of Norway, Uppland, Gotland and Finland on northern Sweden can be traced and, at a later date, those of Uppland on Trondelagen. We can thus see the great importance of the mountain road from Trondheim Fjord to the upper end of the Rivers Indalselv and Ljungan (78). E. Kivikoski, Die Eisenzeit Finnlands, I (1947) (in German). This book is a classification of the artifacts of the first eight centuries after Christ and in its arrangement is a parallel to Almgren and Nerman's books on Gotland. It supplements the standard work of Hackman, Die ditere Eisenzeit in Finniand, pub- lished in 1905, but the second volume will be of very great use since it will deal with the period A.D. 800- 1200, which has never been thoroughly treated. C. J. Becker, "Die zeitliche Stellung des Hjort- springfundes," Acta Archaeologica 19 (1949) 145-87 (in German). An analysis of the La Thne pottery in Denmark and an attempt to classify it in three divisions like the metal types. As a result the dating of the two large finds of weapons from Hjortspring on the island of Als (79) and Krogsbylle on Fyn (80) has been changed by the author. See also Trelleborg above. O. Klindt-Jensen, "Foreign Influences in Denmark's Early Iron Age," Acta Archaeologica 20 (1950) 1-229 (in English with a Danish summary). The imports into Denmark, from the late La Thne and early Roman periods, of Roman, Gallic, Gallo-Roman and German material have been thoroughly examined. Particularly emphasized are the finds from Kraghede in north Jut- land (81), not previously published, the Dejbjerg cars (82), about which the place of manufacture as well as the reconstruction is discussed, and the Gundestrup cauldron (83). The cauldron is related to some hitherto unnoticed sculptural finds from north Italy and south- eastern France by which its style and place of manu- facture are fixed. The author also offers a new and interesting explanation of the replacement of Etruscan culture in the Po valley by a Gallic culture. The work is a doctor's thesis. H. Arbman, "Gundestrupkitteln, et gallisk arbete?," Tor (1948) 109-16 (in Swedish). This short paper dis- cusses the same theory as advanced by O. Klindt- Jensen (above) in connection with the cauldron. N. Breitenstein, "De romerske Montfund fra den sjaellandske Ogruppe," Nord. Numism. Arsskr. 1946, 1-34 (in Danish with an English summary). The author, in continuation of his publication of the Roman coins from Fyn and Bornholm (ibid. 1943 and 1944) describes forty-two finds of Roman coins from the islands Zealand, Lolland, Falster and M en; most of the coins are of Flavian and Antonine date. Kr. Eldjarn, "Fund af romerske Monter pa Island," Nord. Numism. Arsskr. 1949, 1-8 (in Danish with an English summary); H. Shetelig, "Roman Coins Found in Iceland," Antiquity 1949, 161-63. Finds of three Roman bronze coins, dating A.D. 270-307, make it more than possible that a Roman ship visited Brag- davellir on the eastern coast of Iceland (52) ca. A.D. 300; this is five hundred years earlier than the dis- covery of the island according to literary sources. J. Werner, "Zu den auf Oland und Gotland gefun- denen byzantinischen Goldmiinzen," Fornvdnnen 1949, 257-86 (in German). The author correlates the finds of solidi from Oland and Gotland (84-85) with the history of the period, thereby throwing light on the destruction of the islands by wars ca. A.D. 500 (the so-called "Catastrophe theory") and on the archi- tectural similarity of the peasants' castles in the Baltic area (see Gamleborg and Ringborgen) and the Byzantine fortresses. A.-M. Tjernberg, "Valsgirde 20," Tor 1948, 49-64 (in Swedish). Another find from the famous Valsgairde cemetery is published. It is the oldest, dating ca. A.D. 400. This chamber tomb is probably that of the first ruler of the Valsg~irde dynasty (86). H. Norling-Christensen, "Germansk Jaernalders Begyndelse i Norden," Viking 1949, 1-16 (in Danish). A chronological study in which the author attempts to push back the limit between the Roman Iron Age</page><page sequence="24">62 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [AJA 56 and the Migration period farther than the usually accepted time. Thus new groups of local artifacts will be contemporary with the latest imported Roman articles; the import of glass in particular will be put in a new light. H. Christiansson, "Gravklot och gravoffer," Tor 1948, 123-31 (in Swedish). In a short essay on the stone balls on barrows and grave sacrifices the author throws light on the connection between Roman re- ligion, Scandinavian pre-Christian cults and Swedish folk superstitions of later times in out of the way districts. The findings are an excellent starting point for further studies. H. Arbman, "Verroterie Cloisonnee et Filigrane," Meddel. f. Lunds Univ. 1950, 64-100 (in French). A brief summary of cell-work and filigree in Scandinavian Iron Age goldsmith and jeweller handicraft, restudied after the publication of the rich Sutton Hoo finds. Viking Age H. Shetelig, "The Norse Style of Ornamentation in the Viking Settlements," Acta Archaeologica 19 (1949) 69-113. An account of the mixing and creation of styles as the result of the meeting of the Normans with western Christianity on the British Isles and of how the new style-elements found their way back to Scandinavia. Motifs are not discussed. H. Shetelig, "Religionshistoriske drag fra Vikin- getidens stilhistorie," Viking 1950, 49-62 (in Nor- wegian). In a description of the imagery in the art of Scandinavia and its colonies in the west the author emphasizes how greatly religious symbolism and magic determine the choice of motifs; how this imagery changes when the religion changes, first in the colonies, later in Norway and Denmark and lastly in Sweden. S. Lindqvist, "Osebergmdistarna," Tor 1948, 9-28 (in Swedish). A re-study of the relations between the four great artists whose works we find on the Oseberg grave. It is suggested that they are contemporaries, influenced from different sources and developing in various degrees from their original peasant milieu, rather than that they are of different periods. A. W. Brogger og H. Shetelig, Vikingeskipene, 1950 (in Norwegian). This is a major work in the history of sailing by the two doyens of Norwegian archaeology. It is a general account based on the literary and archaeological evidence of ship construction, naviga- tion, the boat graves, and many other problems aris- ing from the earlier investigations of the large ship graves in Vestfold. S. B. F. Jansson, "Sirmlindska Runstensfynd," Fornvinnen 1948, 282-314 (in Swedish with an English summary). Since the appearance in 1936 of Siderman- lands Runindskrifter by E. Brate and E. Wess~n, not less than fourteen new runic stones have been found in this district. They add greatly to our knowledge of culture in the Viking Age and to the study of the ornamentation on the runic stones. S6rmland is the center for this art of ornamentation (88). J. P. Bjernum, "Vikingetidens Handel og dens Betydning for Nordens Folk," Arb. f. nord. Oldk. 1948, 294-303 (in Danish with an English summary). The author proves that in the Viking Age trade actually existed, pace H. Pirenne, and that it was entirely of a luxury character since each district was self-supporting in necessities. This type of trade stimu- lated the piracy which was so dominant a feature of the society. Ed. Sturms, "Schwedische Kolonien in Lettland," Fornvdnnen 1949, 205-17 (in German). The author surveys Scandinavian immigration to Letland before A.D. 1050, now proved by about thirty finds. It was divided between a peaceful period, 650-850, with Grobin and Vindau as the chief towns (89) and a more warlike period, 850-1050, which left its main traces along the Rivers Venta and Duna, the routes to inner Russia. G. H. Rundquist, "Tv&amp; silverskattar fran Vikin- gatiden," Nord. Numism. Arsskr. 1946, 35-74 (in Swedish with an English summary). This paper dis- cusses the two large and four small finds of Viking Age coins from Kronoberg Ldin (90), made in the nineteenth century. All six hoards were buried in the middle of the eleventh century. H. Salmo, "Deutsche Mtinzen in vorgeschichtlichen Funden Finnlands," Finska Fornm. foren. Tidsskr. 47 (1948) 435 pp. (in German). Although the contents of this large volume fall partly outside the realm of prehistory, dealing as it does with the period 800-1300, it is an important book for archaeologists since Salmo in his synopsis mentions all coin finds from the Viking period, not only the German, and deals with the prob- lems connected with the Aland isles (92). POLAND BY LOUISE LLEWELLYN JARECKA Prehistoric Period. The first mention in European chronicles of Poland as an existing sovereign power was made in A.D. 963. Preparations are now in progress to celebrate the one thousandth anniversary of this date in 1963; the systematic research in which Polish prehistorians are engaged will throw new light on the genesis and organization of the state. It was discussed whether to adopt the policy of thoroughly investigating the site of each prehistoric settlement, one after another, or of taking soundings first of as many as possible to de- termine the order and degree of their importance. It was decided to follow the latter course, in view of the very large number of known sites, and to prepare</page><page sequence="25">19521 ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS 63 a preliminary map of all existing sites to be published in 1955. This is designed to furnish a correlation of the prehistoric and early historic defence systems which will be of inestimable value in determining the emer- gence and growth of the Polish state. Meanwhile, in a recent issue of Z Otchani WiekOw (Abyss of the Centuries) covering the activity of Polish prehistorians for the post-war years, Professor Andrew Zaki of the University of Krakow makes a report on excavations in Malopolska. This area embraces the territory of southwestern Poland, including roughly the basin of the upper Vistula, thus taking in the ancient city of Krakow, Rzesz6w, and Kielce. The beginning of human culture in Polish lands, writes Professor Zaki, reaches back to the Third Glacial Period, about 200,000 years ago, tangible evidence of which is found only in Malopolska. Pri- mordial man, in fact, made his first appearance on Polish territory in this region. Although no skeletal remains have been found, and no proof exists of whence he came, from western Europe or Asia, his presence is attested by stone implements of Levallois industry found near Krakow and some later, still undetermined, findings from the district of Olkusz. During the last great Baltic glaciation Malopolska was inhabited by people using implements of the Acheulian and Micoquian, early and late, Mousterian industries, traces of which were found near Krakow in Piekary, Ojc6w, and in the city itself. That popula- tion led the nomadic life of hunters in severe natural conditions. In the first interglacial Baltic period thriv- ing Aurignacian industries developed in Malopolska, known from artifacts found in caves and on open sites. Valuable material throwing light on climatic and cultural conditions of those times was found in the excavations on the camp of the mammoth hunters in Krakow and its outskirts. At the same time other finds and observations of the loess layers permitted a more precise determination than has hitherto been possible of the beginnings of the late Paleolithic, and of the climatic fluctuations and sedimentation of the loess in the final phases of the Ice Age. Much new material comes also from the investigation of late Paleolithic sites in the vicinity of Ilza in 1947, which is as yet unpublished. In this period there appeared in Malo- polska the first, very modest, art objects: an Aurig- nacian plaque of ivory with holes and small im- pressions and early Magdalenian objects of notched bone and horn. Possibly a sort of zo5morphic relief on a flake and engravings on bone found in Krakow are also to be regarded as art objects; both are Aurig- nacian. From the time of the third Baltic glaciation the climate became slowly, but considerably, warmer, with resulting changes in flora, fauna and cultural condi- tions. In the basin of the Vistula appeared the Epi- Paleolithic peoples using microlithic instruments which have been found in great numbers in the sand dunes near Krakow. Their raw material, a chocolate-colored flint, was brought partly from the mines near Radom. About the middle of the third millennium B.C. im- portant economic changes ushered in the Neolithic period with its agricultural type of life. Malopolska was the first to develop the new cultural achievements which came from the Danube with the bearers of the engraved ribbon ceramic culture. Thanks to investigations of newly discovered settle- ments in Zofipole on the Vistula, in Targowisko on the Raba and in Boguchwala on the Visloka we have be- come better acquainted with the dimensions, plan and locations of the dwellings and refuse dumps. Ceramic material found in these settlements makes it possible to distinguish a whole series of containers of rich linear ornamentation, sometimes with incrusta- tions, engraved and plastic. Various new varieties of handles have been observed and a skeleton in a grave has been found. It is probable that a short time after the coming of the bearers of the engraved ribbon cul- ture there appeared the culture of pricked ribbon ceramics. It may be a stylistic development rather than the trace of a new migration from beyond the Carpathians. It shows many characteristics in com- mon with its predecessor and, like it, appears ex- clusively on fertile lands, principally loess. In Zofipole were found earthworks and dumps with shells of fresh water molluscs, sherds belonging to both cultures, fragments of stone, flint and obsidian implements. The other two cultures of the ribbon cycle, Cisian and Moravian, appeared in the second period of Polish Neolithic, occupying fertile lands on the left bank of the Vistula. The south Moravian culture was profuse in rich forms: goblets on bases, decorated with black meander-like motifs against a red background, and bowls with plastic knob ornamentation. These types had not as yet been found in Poland and do not seem to have an analogy elsewhere; thus it is necessary to classify the Zofipole ceramics as a separate type, possibly, after further investigation, as a separate cultural group. Somewhere during the third Neolithic period there was formed, it may be from mainly local elements, a ray ceramic culture, the last of the ribbon cycle. Among the newly discovered localities of that culture the settlement at Igolomia appears to be very im- portant; it is the largest after that of Modlnica near Krakow and investigation has shown a denser con- centration of earth dwellings. Contributing to the formation of the ray ceramic culture, besides a direct heritage from the ribbon culture, was an influence of northwestern elements, especially the culture of funnel-shaped goblets. Deriving from Jutland it ap- peared in Malopolska at the end of the second Neo-</page><page sequence="26">64 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [AJA 56 lithic period, or the beginning of the third. It not only occupied the loess soil, but spread to inferior land. Investigation in the centers of this culture, particu- larly in the Opatow district, where the population exploited the striped flint from the large mines (about 700 pits are known), yielded many valuable arti- facts. Raw material from these mines travelled by commercial routes over the whole of Poland and as far as Bohemia and Germany. A second wave of population from the north was made up of the bringers of circular amphoras. While no new graves have been found at the source of the Vistula, new arguments have been developed to sup- port the theory that this culture probably belonged to central Europe and not to the north; it should be regarded as the first wave of the Pre-Indo-European peoples moving to the east. After this wave was to come a much stronger one which led to the final Indo- Europeanization of Polish lands. It was an expansive movement of the nomadic bearers of corded ceramic culture and, in the territory of Malopolska, had a greater extent than any previous culture. According to the latest research it reached deeply into the Car- pathians of the Rzesz6w district, and, moving along the River Dunajec in the region of Krakow, it passed beyond the Tatras. Mixing with local elements and absorbed by them it slowly changed from a nomadic to an agricultural character and formed two groups: the Krakow and the Zlota people (named from a cemetery near Sandomir). Since the war a large ceme- tery has been discovered near Krakow which contains typical flat graves with flexed skeletons. This has not yet been fully investigated. A certain role, though presumably not a large one, was played by the Pre-Finno-Ugrian culture from the northeast and that of bell goblets from the Iberian peninsula. Their influence, however, was very slight, for it seems that participation of the Finno-Ugrian culture in the formation of the late Trzciniec culture has been too strongly emphasized, at least in Malo- polska. Our knowledge of these cultures, however, is very limited and there has been no additional work on the already known sites. At the beginning of the Bronze Age in the eight- eenth century B.C. the evidence does not permit of a clear picture. The corded ware culture is discernible and at the same time elements of the agricultural, ribbon and ray ceramics persist. On the basis of the corded ceramics there was formed the culture of Mierzanowice in the district of Opatow to which twelve localities belong. It is also argued that the Trzciniec culture in the region of the upper Vistula dated from the earliest period of the Bronze Age. This gradually absorbed all the various local elements in the second period of the Age. About forty sites are known, mainly settlements, on the left bank of the Vistula. When this culture was at its zenith there appeared at the western end of the source of the Vistula the Pre-Lusatian culture, known at present from one locality only, but strongly affecting its eastern neigh- bors. Until recently this was regarded as the trunk from which sprang Lusatian culture. In the light of present research, however, it seems that Lusatian culture probably developed from the growing cultural unification of the period, mainly between Trzciniec culture and the Pre-Lusatian. Since Malopolska lay at the crossroads of these two cultures it was prob- ably a part of the cradle of Lusatian culture and not merely a colonial area of Silesia and Moravia. One result of post-war excavation and study is the dis- covery of the oldest local links with the Lusatian culture: the characteristic knob ceramics, clay saucers of the earliest Lusatian period, hitherto known from the Hallstatt province, and other forms showing clearly the heritage from the Trzciniec and Pre- Lusatian, and indirectly from the ray ceramic. After the third period of the Bronze Age (1300-1100 B.C.) there persisted in Malopolska for an entire mil- lennium only one culture, the Lusatian, which may be identified as the oldest Pre-Slavic. The settling of the Lusatian population quickly occupied the whole terri- tory of Malopolska. In the fourth period and, in part, already in the third, it reached in many places beyond the fertile left bank of the Vistula up to the mouth and middle of the River San. This fact contradicts the localization there of the separate culture known as the Tarnobrzeg. This appeared only later, and faintly, at the foot of the Carpathians, so that the acceptance of a Thracian settlement seems to be excluded. Traces of open Lusatian sites in Malopolska are quite rare, in distinction to the fortified sites of which we know about twenty. They may have been founded in the fourth Bronze period, but can be definitely placed in the fifth. The most numerous remains of the Lusatian culture are the cemeteries established in the third and fourth periods, usually on loess land, as at Zofi- pole, and later on the sands. Cremation finally pre- vailed and inhumation was sporadic. The cenotaph known in Zofipole in the third period of Polish Neo- lithic again became a familiar feature. It consisted of five small vessels placed around one large container ornamented with rays; it was either a sort of substi- tute grave in honor of a person who died outside the country or a relic of some other religious practice connected with a cult of the dead, a prehistoric All Souls Day. The material culture made undoubted progress: pottery making was on a very high level, the smelting of bronze and lead was carried on; per- haps some of the metal came from the Olkusz mines,</page><page sequence="27">1952] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS 65 although many bronze products were imported by the Carpathian roads from Hungary and Slovakia. The decadence of Lusatian culture came at the beginning of the Iron Age. There ensued an era, which lasted many centuries, of disturbances, invasions, and conquests. It culminated in a historical migration, starting with a predatory expansion of the Scythians and the political expansion, as it seems, of the Pom- eranian and Celtic cultures. The burned remains of settlements, large and small, in Malopolska testify to the tragic defence of Lusatian culture; other archaeo- logical evidence shows its impoverishment and eco- nomic decline. New cultures of the box grave and bell grave peoples mingled with the Lusatian culture and the autochthonous element seems to have taken prece- dence over the intruders from the north. The Celts experienced the same disappearance. Wandering eastward in larger groups and remaining distinct for a time they were swallowed up in the sea of regional, presumably Slav, people. The lack of Celtic strongholds and of traces of the famous oppida, which appear in the territories occupied by the Celts, raises doubt about the thesis of their presence as a ruling class in Malopolska. Investigations now being carried out at such strongholds at Tyniec near Krakow may, of course, yield some Celtic artifacts. The thesis of a mixed Celto-Slav group also does not have much foundation, although Celtic influences on the local culture were considerable, for example, in metallurgy. New light should be thrown on the period by study of the material from the cemetery of Przeworsk and of the Venedian people. The new material from Zofi- pole is rather later in date than this. Roman Period In the first centuries of our era the level of culture of the population rose, thanks to the influence of the Roman provinces; this is apparent, not only in pottery shapes adapted from provincial forms, but in numerous Roman imports, such as bronze utensils, sigillata ware, and coins. In the third century there is per- ceptible improvement in the production of local Malo- polska ceramics. In addition to hand made pottery there is grey, wheel made ware from industrial es- tablishments with many kilns. A large production center including several such establishments was dis- covered on the left bank of the Vistula near Igolomia. The cause of its destruction is not known. As yet the period of crystallization of the mass of the Slav population on the Vistula is not known to scholars. The answer to the question where the capital of the first Polish state was located, whether at Krakow or Tyniec, is now being sought. In a few years, when the results of all the archaeological in- vestigations have been gathered and published, we shall be in possession of a picture of Malopolska's prehistory. One thing is certain, that the strong agri- cultural foundation, upon which the autochthonous and infiltrating elements merged into a Pre-Slav (Lusatian) culture, was the enduring rock which sus- tained the Pre-Slav and Slav peoples and the forms of their socio-political life in the face of calamity. Excavations carried on since 1940 on the left bank of the Vistula have revealed kilns in Zofipole which show that pottery production there was on a large, industrial scale. It is probable that these were only part of a greater center, but, even so, the Zofipole factory is the largest of its type found in Poland and, so far as is known, in Central Europe. The material from the potteries in the Rhine area presents the best parallels. In the Zofipole material there is great variety in the sizes of the jugs, pots, bowls, mugs, small dishes; also found were miniature heads of bison, bulls, horses and warp weights. The colors are greyish, brown or black. Some of the vessels are complete. The kilns are of clay construction without the addition of sand, but many are so burnt from long use that they could not be removed for reconstruction in a museum; they have been protected by shelters on the spot erected under the direction of Professor Zaki.</page><page sequence="28">........ . . . . . .i: l:ii:- -i ?:-i: ?i ?? . . . . . . . . . .~~_- ' ~~::~i:: ;. ............ ....... ......:- - .......... ... ..... .. . .... .... ... .. . j::I'~:~:':;'~~::~jj' ~j~:~~:~~~~::. ~ ~ 1:8~ ................ go, am,,,,l~ i;I .. ... ..... . ....
